[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]
Friday you first in...

[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.580]
In Cyclopedia films proudly present

[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.240]
Easter around this big blue marble we call Earth

[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.640]
Tyrion North America

[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.520]
Children await a visit from the Easter Bunny

[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.960]
while in San Francisco

[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.460]
Gaili dressed and color coordinated celebrants

[00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.880]
Hide their eggs where you never think to look

[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.320]
Giving no meaning to the working like rabbits

[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.820]
In India, Mohandas Bunny

[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.880]
is actually an emissiated five-foot cow

[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.520]
who delivers baskets filled with pestilence and famine

[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.080]
while blaming it on the thermonuclear aspirations

[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.320]
of those rancid Pakistanis

[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.560]
in Iran, these turbanny known as

[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.060]
Haji the Magic Bunny

[00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.820]
who clears the fields of mines before the spring plantings

[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.360]
Oh, a rabbit's foot!

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.820]
In North Korea, Peter Cattentale

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.740]
known only as Kim Chi-wan

[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.420]
is sometimes mistaken

[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.800]
Therefore, for as he comes

[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.220]
Hup-hup-hup and down the bunny trail

[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.600]
Meanwhile, in sweltering Africa

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.360]
Children visit the zoo

[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.840]
to Toskuri's at Ibu-to-the-Eastern Chimp

[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.640]
believing whomever is it by what Ibu-to-throws back at them

[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.200]
will have good luck all year

[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.720]
So there you have it

[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.620]
whether you believe in the Easter Bunny

[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.380]
Ibu-to-the-Eastern Chimp

[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.180]
or Mohandas-the-emissiated Eastern cow

[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.420]
Say the Magic of Easter, be yours

[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.480]
as you enjoy this special holiday

[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.720]
around the world

[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.840]
Maybe precious can be a Louisa's Easter Chimp on passions

[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.280]
which George didn't watch yesterday

[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.080]
he taped it basically

[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.920]
What I got, I watched it

[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.860]
Where you get with it

[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.080]
I watched one on the fourth in July last night

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.720]
I know, I know, yeah

[00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.360]
Well, that was depressing

[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.320]
Not what we were, but it was very depressing

[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.880]
especially in the timing was perfect

[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.640]
It was good that I put it up until right now

[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.120]
Because what it points out

[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.260]
and just perfectly is the way that

[00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.420]
everything gets sanitized

[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.100]
and especially now the media

[00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.840]
but they did the same thing in the early days of Vietnam

[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.120]
they sanitized it all

[00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.020]
Everything is just a list

[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.020]
a list of names and statistics

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.040]
Was it like this?

[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.320]
Was it this efficient?

[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.980]
This perfect?

[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.940]
Oh yeah

[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.360]
And it was easier to do it

[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.020]
because they didn't have any embedded journalist

[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.260]
they didn't have any of the Southern crap

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.560]
you didn't by accident see any of the fallout

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.560]
because we didn't have the technology back then

[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.680]
They didn't have that great instant satellite technology

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500]
So it was only years later

[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.880]
after all the protests started building

[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.720]
and building and building

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.280]
that we started to get the pictures back

[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.640]
of film footage

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.520]
of all the naked, just

[00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.940]
a bloated, rotoscope images

[00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.060]
little children and the women

[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.260]
all the other stuff that was going on

[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.780]
But at any rate

[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.120]
Thousands in Baghdad by the way protesting this

[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.720]
are the biggest protests in SWW2

[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.720]
against what they call foreign occupation

[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.260]
I just mentioned that in passing

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.740]
because the big news right now of course

[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.440]
that all of these channels are creating breathlessly

[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.920]
here on Good Friday

[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.860]
is the new pictures of clowns Sodom

[00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.760]
Yeah

[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.700]
Abu Dhabi TV had the original pictures

[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.860]
and of course all the other

[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.160]
I bet you're right now as I speak

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.180]
let me turn over to CNN

[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.100]
I bet you're saying that

[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.060]
we got the press briefing

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.880]
we got the propaganda briefing

[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.360]
but they all headed on there

[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.140]

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.040]
supposedly April 9 which is what

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.820]
a week ago Wednesday

[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.500]
and there was a Sodom

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.680]
and even Kusay

[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.280]
one of the sons

[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.200]
they were creating around

[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.980]
in one of the parts of the city

[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.400]
Kusay, not Kusay

[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.800]
Kusay, and Kusay

[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.200]
and they were like doing their thing

[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.940]
and everybody's like

[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.320]
oh I have to check this out again

[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.380]
I wouldn't be surprised

[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.460]
just like Sandy Claus

[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.140]

[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.760]

just to be effing with us

[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.200]
you know what I mean?

[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.960]
We effed with them

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.240]
and other effing back with us

[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:33.700]
Speaking of that

[00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.560]
let me give the plug

[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080]

but only 12.2%

[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.860]
in fact if you add

a lot more votes if they

[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:21.420]
knew what it meant

[00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.940]
if they understood the

[00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:23.380]
significance

[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.980]

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.140]

[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:17.640]
wow!

[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.620]
have you know that

[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.300]
guys like him?

[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:20.300]
take it from me.

[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.100]
I'm a survivor you know.

[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.480]
from a

[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680]
dancing train camp.

[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:24.580]
yeah, but that was no

[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.140]
game show.

[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.160]
how do you survive that?

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.060]
I was with the

[00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.560]
golden, a sundaer

[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.260]
commando.

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.700]
hello?

[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:32.100]
hello, it was like

[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:33.620]
it was me and the

[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:34.320]
airy flychers

[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:34.680]
grandfather.

[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:35.800]
and we had to

[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.660]
I remember it like it

[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.220]
was yesterday

[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.820]
today.

[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.260]
it was 1942.

[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:42.140]
it was a commando

[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.920]

[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:43.800]

[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.240]
hi, I'll

[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:48.520]
bone.

[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:49.600]
I'll

[00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:50.360]
comadante.

[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.500]
where is

[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.200]
flychers?

[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:52.840]
well, he went under

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.620]
the covers and turned in

[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:54.700]
more than the certain

[00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:54.980]
you.

[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:55.920]
very well then.

[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.600]
and what information have

[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.400]

[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.220]
well, I got

[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.140]
Rosenblatt, that guy there

[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.640]
is a jume.

[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:02.600]
you can have him.

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.320]
and that low-instein

[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:04.660]
brought.

[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:05.820]
there's one for you.

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:06.720]
can help my happy

[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.300]
stack now.

[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.400]
I use it to wipe my

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:09.920]
boots.

[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.020]
well, that's it.

[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.780]
but your efforts will not go

[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:13.700]
unrewarded.

[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.560]
the fjor is pleased with your

[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.320]
cooperation.

[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:17.680]
and he will be visiting

[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.460]
this office once he concludes

[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.260]
his meeting with

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.200]
fresh danbush.

[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.340]
I don't know about you,

[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.280]
but I use his meat

[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.080]
tender risers.

[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:24.780]
knock on!

[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.780]
I hit up!

[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:26.520]
where are my dros?

[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.480]
hey, they're head off.

[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:28.160]
what do you know?

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:28.660]
what do you say?

[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.780]
either the gandishan

[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.360]
of garlic.

[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.680]
he says you have a nice

[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:31.940]
back.

[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:32.380]
he's fired.

[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.120]
he needs anything.

[00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.840]
now, he wants you

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.840]
to bend over.

[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.620]
see here.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.340]
I'm just

[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.200]
a guy.

[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:40.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.740]
I'll

[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:41.880]
I'll

[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.820]
I will

[00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:44.720]
take the last

[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.060]
time.

[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.020]
who's your

[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:47.420]
fjora?

[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:48.960]
who's your fjora?

[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.080]
and that is when

[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.200]
the chud's came at me.

[00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:52.660]
I wonder if

[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.680]
it all uses meat tender

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.360]
as a run-mo.

[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.860]
919 at 560

[00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.080]
is a special Easter

[00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.080]
a good Friday treat.

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.280]
we have March 24th, 1964.

[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:02.600]
New York Rangers

[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.160]
at the Toronto

[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.040]
Maple Leafs in the

[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:04.900]
Lou of our show today.

[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.080]
he's hit by a

[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.360]
shack.

[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.260]
we're wearing a

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.660]
barn.

[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:09.520]
let's take a look at

[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:10.660]
the audio from this

[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:11.160]
hockey game.

[00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.040]
please.

[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:12.780]
getting an uphill

[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:14.000]
suspect down the

[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.300]
any single-a-ranger zone.

[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:16.400]
I think it's a good idea

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:16.820]
to build a

[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:17.460]
huge hill.

[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.080]
and then, of course, we

[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:18.880]
could also place them in a

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.800]
highlights from a racing

[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.600]
where else is racing

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:20.880]
from.

[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:21.520]
there's the

[00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:21.980]
metallands.

[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:23.120]
all you got to know is

[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.640]
Jackie Mo.

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.980]
I guess we won't do that.

[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.160]
it's a possibility, though.

[00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:27.640]
I just feel like we're

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.500]
always getting screwed on

[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:28.920]
these days.

[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.220]
you know?

[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:29.820]
no.

[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.280]
because everybody else takes

[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.260]
off to park a lot of

[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:32.560]
Zimtie.

[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.440]
it's a big must-man's

[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:33.680]
holiday.

[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:34.200]
Mo.

[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:35.100]
who don't do a damn thing

[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.040]
anyway, takes off.

[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:36.900]
oh well, it comes in

[00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.640]
yesterday to give us a

[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.780]
tearful goodbye for a few

[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:39.000]
days.

[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:40.180]
he'll be back on Tuesday.

[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:41.900]
yeah.

[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.180]
Tuesday.

[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:43.320]
I already want to tell you

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:43.900]
what's going on in the

[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.700]
other room with the log

[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.800]
and all the red and the

[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:46.680]
yellow on the autolog.

[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:47.540]
and he's got nobody to

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.240]
talk to about it.

[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:49.580]
why is that?

[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:50.500]
because everybody's gone.

[00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:51.200]
yeah.

[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.620]
but what's happening with it?

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.680]
there's some spots are not

[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:53.960]
there.

[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:54.740]
some right of date.

[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.680]
we don't know whether we

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.420]
should play them or not.

[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:57.440]
hey, don't start making

[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.060]
trouble now.

[00:16:58.220 --> 00:16:59.360]
it's the QAMF in

[00:16:59.360 --> 00:16:59.500]
way.

[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.380]
that's just the way we do

[00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:00.620]
things.

[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:01.640]
yeah, the way we do things.

[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:01.680]
let's do it.

[00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:02.820]
let's do it.

[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.320]
let's put on a hockey game.

[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.840]
in Colorado.

[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:05.660]
oh.

[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.200]
here's the poll for today.

[00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:09.640]
this is a tough one.

[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:09.880]
you're right.

[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:10.640]
and the only reason it's

[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.040]
such a serious poll is

[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.780]
because it's your fault.

[00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:13.860]
yeah.

[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:15.280]
because you got me to walk

[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:15.900]
said, born on the

[00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:15.960]
floor.

[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.000]
I was going to be the

[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.780]
last night, which I'm

[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:18.320]
glad I did.

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.400]
great job by Tom

[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.100]
cruising that too.

[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:22.340]
I was back before it

[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:22.720]
became my

[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.260]
right.

[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:23.780]
everything

[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.680]
whatever he is now.

[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:25.720]
just a...

[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.100]
what was the worst

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.000]
champion American

[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.880]
history is the poll

I've got, let's see,

[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:32.280]

[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:33.440]
ten, and a dozen good

[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.900]
choices.

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:35.160]
slavery.

[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:36.880]
oh, it's already

[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:37.200]
up there.

[00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.040]
slavery's got six.

[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.780]

[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:52.140]
Monica Gate.

[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.260]
I would call it penis

[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.280]
gate, but Tom

[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.640]
cruises mom in born

[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.040]
on the 4th of

[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:57.300]
july.

[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.680]
don't say penis.

[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:01.120]
and they say it's

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.560]
screaming out.

[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.920]
fn big penis.

[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:05.800]
it's screaming out.

[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:05.800]

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:05.940]

[00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:05.940]

[00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.240]
great.

[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.720]
and she's just having

[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.620]
a nervous breakdown.

[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:09.700]
especially on good Friday

[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.420]
don't say penis,

[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.040]
whatever you do.

[00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.260]
don't say it.

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.240]
don't even look at it.

[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:13.820]
that's supposed to have

[00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:13.980]
me.

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:15.980]
because that's what the

[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.000]
Catholic Church is all about

[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.140]
after all is, anyway.

[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.220]
what was the worst

[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:19.940]
chapter in American

[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:20.800]
history, Rascode,

[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.280]
Anya Rajus.com, and it's

[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:22.640]
up to you.

[00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:23.500]
it won't be an easy

[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:23.900]
choice.

[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.520]
what they'll do, I vote

[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.380]
for. I don't even know

[00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.140]
which one I voted for.

[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:27.780]
I'm troubled and

[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.260]
agonized.

[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.380]
I think I voted for the

[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.040]
assassinations.

[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.740]
by the way, the

[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:34.000]
assassinations of the 60s,

[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.740]
there is no doubt in my

[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.780]
mind now we're all done

[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.700]
by the military

[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:38.780]
industrial establishment.

[00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:40.500]
okay.

[00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.280]
oh yeah, because, first

[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.200]
of all the Kennedys, we're

[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.960]
going to change the

[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.520]
Senate's goal.

[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:45.280]
of course, Martin Luther

[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.600]
King rewonded to change the

[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.440]
racist institution of the

[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.100]
American government.

[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.760]
and they didn't fly too

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.680]
well for those folks.

[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:53.400]
it interfered

[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.960]
screwed up all their

[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.400]
plans.

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.560]
like Tessio said,

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.880]
excuse up all my plans.

[00:18:58.140 --> 00:18:59.200]
the worst chapter in

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:18:59.680]
American history.

[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.880]
slavery, civil war,

[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.460]
depression,

[00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.160]
W-W-W-W-W-2,

[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.480]
assassination of the 60s,

[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.960]
JFK, MLK, RFK,

[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.640]
watergate, Vietnam,

[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.260]
Gulf War I, 2000 presidential

[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.280]
election, the attack on a

[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.960]
black or monocogate known

[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.360]
in some circles as

[00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:18.040]
penis gate in some

[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:18.500]
circles.

[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.040]
anyway, we kind of glossed

[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.600]
over and I think it's

[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:20.980]
really bad.

[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:21.860]
we ought to have a lot of

[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:22.620]
calls today from

[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:23.560]
Actions people.

[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:23.980]
don't you think?

[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:24.500]
sure.

[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:25.580]
they just had a story I was

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.880]
flipping.

[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.820]
and you mean the Sodom

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.640]
and Ouss, Ouss they were

[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.040]
going to?

[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:31.700]
no.

[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:32.960]
oh no.

[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.480]
well, why did they keep,

[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.540]
well, I already know.

[00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:37.420]
and you people in the

[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:38.540]
media, by the way, I want

[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.680]
to, isn't it interesting?

[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.960]
all of these great,

[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.040]
bedtime stories that we

[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.880]
have on our website and

[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.560]
that we get to read

[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.100]
thank goodness,

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.200]
because we still have

[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:45.840]
freedom of the press.

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.440]
in the print media,

[00:19:48.580 --> 00:19:49.200]
that's where you find

[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:49.400]
them.

[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.040]
in the American

[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:51.680]
electronic media,

[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.260]
forget about it.

[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:53.960]
you won't see it.

[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.080]
you won't see it.

[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.780]
and you want to know why?

[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.320]
because the FCC has no

[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.660]
power over the print media.

[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.740]
they have no thank goodness.

[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:01.820]
they don't regulate the

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:02.300]
print media.

[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.220]
they don't license or

[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:05.000]
regulate the New York

[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.820]
Times and Washington

[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.520]
Post or any of the

[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.800]
websites, especially on

[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:09.400]
the internet, they have

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.660]
no camera.

[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.180]
they have no control over

[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:10.680]
them yet.

[00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:12.320]
as opposed to the broadcast

[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.040]
media, what, wow, you

[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.960]
better do what's right

[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.420]
because, you know, Michael

[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.760]
Powell is doing this and

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.740]
Michael Powell is doing that.

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.580]
and if you want to have

[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.520]
a control of the entire

[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.460]
media, you better

[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:22.240]
be nice to us.

[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.960]
you better be as much

[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.240]
fox-like as you possibly

[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:24.600]
can.

[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.360]
so that's the big difference.

[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:28.100]
that's why if you really

[00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.000]
want the truth, go to the

[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:29.700]
internet, go to our

[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.500]
website or a bunch of

[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.560]
other good websites, and

[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.320]
start doing a little bit of

[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.340]
reading because you sure

[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.140]
is how won't get it on

[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.580]
television.

[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.700]
you're going to hear that

[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.160]
right now.

[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:39.620]
you might get some

[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.640]
replays or some old hockey

[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.300]
games.

[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:45.520]
oh, ready to go for that

[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.020]
case of

[00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:46.240]
up.

[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.300]
come on, let's just put the

[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:47.860]
whole thing on it.

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.220]
what do you say?

[00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.140]
take a little day off.

[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.060]
get the spot in.

[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.640]
I think that's good for the

[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:52.640]

[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.940]
the goose is good for the

[00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:54.200]
gander.

[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.480]
you say that as if it's a

[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.240]
foregone conclusion.

[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:56.880]
we're going to get the

[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.380]
spot in.

[00:20:58.640 --> 00:20:59.440]
what do you mean by that?

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.480]
because there's no one to

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.360]
consult with about it.

[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.680]
listen, look, we'll do the

[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.260]
best we can.

[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:04.960]
that's all we can do.

[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.360]
don't worry about them.

[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.260]
they have no clue what's

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:07.540]
going on.

[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.880]
the sales of people...

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.520]
they've just...

[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:10.380]
they've been

[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.240]
scottled with the cash,

[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:11.640]
okay?

[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.420]
maybe they were over in

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:14.300]
bagged-ed, stealing all

[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:14.940]
the stuff out of the

[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.240]
museum.

[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.160]
I have no idea, but

[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:16.680]
they sure is how

[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.360]
aren't they doing their

[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:17.620]
job.

[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:20.380]
all I got to do was just

[00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:21.660]
leave town the first day I'm

[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.440]
gone or right away to say

[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.360]
like a bunch of little rats

[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.040]
start playing their

[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:24.640]
games in the

[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.240]
schroin, of course.

[00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:26.140]
she still passed out

[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:26.700]
under her desk.

[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.780]
they're trying to scraper

[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.100]
the road or router got

[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.140]
a get their scraper

[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:30.900]
rashed off of there.

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.160]
they're just a scraper

[00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.500]
ass.

[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.200]
maybe elegant or

[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:34.500]
rosy-

[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.480]
and scraper rashed

[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.120]
or something that the

[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.100]
soap made from Jews.

[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.880]
anyway, diet guru

[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.840]
atkins dead at 72 and they

[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.820]
had quite a bit of

[00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:42.660]
stuff on him yesterday.

[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.200]
and I never really

[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.040]
thought about it that

[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.720]
much, but it's true.

[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:47.420]
because he was...

[00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:48.520]
he's a good guy, but he

[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:49.060]
was boring.

[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.100]
he was... not everybody

[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:50.600]
can have a great

[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:51.180]
personality.

[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.580]
but he was...

[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.120]
you know, kind of a

[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:54.520]
boring guy.

[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.340]
but the fact of the matter

[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:56.260]
is he had big balls.

[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.060]
that's the thing.

[00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.920]
and all of those 30

[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:00.260]
years that he had his

[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.060]
diet plan, his

[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:03.920]
concept going of low

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.280]
carbs, he took nothing

[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:05.840]
but crap.

[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:06.720]
I mean, this guy took

[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.640]
more crap than we do.

[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:08.300]
right.

[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.120]
just on and on.

[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.240]

[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.040]
the so-called medical

[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:11.760]
establishment.

[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:12.940]
and you see, by the way,

[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:13.900]
walking around all over

[00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.100]
America, the great job, the

[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.220]
medical establishment is

[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.580]
doing... keep everybody

[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:18.500]
in real good shape.

[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:19.580]
especially at 2am.

[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.420]
we're like the

[00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:21.260]
prostitute child or

[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.160]
American fat.

[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.040]
so we really did take a

[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.420]
lot of crap.

[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.120]
and then, of course, his

[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.700]
time went on.

[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.700]
and even recently, I

[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.520]
guess if there's anything

[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:30.540]
positive to say that is

[00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.340]
before he died, at least he was

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.280]
vindicated to a large

[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.300]
degree body studies that

[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.180]
came out in last year.

[00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:36.760]
and he said, guess what?

[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.260]
not only do you lose more

[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:38.960]
weight on the

[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:40.200]
atkins on the low carb diet,

[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.680]
but also your cholesterol

[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:43.140]
and your blood, your blood,

[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.080]
the lipids go down.

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.820]
they get better, your

[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.520]
triglycerides, your

[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:45.920]
cholesterol.

[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:46.720]
how about that?

[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:47.420]
yeah.

[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.440]
because he poo-pooed the

[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.400]
establishment this whole

[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.680]
concept about, wow, you

[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.000]
got to eat pasta and rice

[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.160]
and bread and vegetable.

[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.520]
well, of course, pasta and

[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:56.140]
rice and bread.

[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.320]
that's pure refined

[00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:57.900]
carbohydrates.

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.040]
makes your blood sugar

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:00.560]
skyrocket and makes you

[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.540]
Ph.A.T.

[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.400]
but the pyramid says,

[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.500]
and go ahead, took it away

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.020]
from him.

[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.340]
they're going, took it away

[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.780]
from him.

[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]
see he's talking about good

[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.140]
Friday again.

[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.280]
26 past nine at five, 60

[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:15.800]
WQM on our really great day.

[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.240]
the staff is out, the log is

[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.200]
screwed up and it's just the

[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.240]
way we like it at a QAM.

[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.640]
we're real excited about it.

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.780]
Moe Meister pretty week show

[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.700]
this morning, Moe.

[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.860]
and seriously, get him a

[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:24.060]
clock.

[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.120]
why is he running over every

[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:25.880]
days? the clock in there

[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.760]
like a screwed up?

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.180]
Robert insists we're off

[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:28.860]
even though.

[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.100]
I hate to break the news to

[00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.640]
you, Robert.

[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.920]
I go by the city

[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.000]
post digital clock.

[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.120]
it's like connected to the

[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:36.160]
world, atomic clock.

[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.300]
and when I tell you it's

[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.700]
nine o'clock on a, it's

[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.260]
not a clock.

[00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.100]
and for business, I gave

[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.240]
Carlos one of those watches

[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.320]
that updates itself with

[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.340]
the atomic clock by

[00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:44.820]
satellite.

[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:45.360]
right.

[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.000]
so he's right if no one

[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:47.680]
else is.

[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.260]
I'll tell you what time it

[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:50.260]
is exactly right now.

[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.440]
it is 92717.

[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:54.940]
that's what he's got exactly

[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.360]
to the side.

[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.180]
9279.

[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.680]
there's no doubt about it.

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.160]
I'm looking at the

[00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.840]
digital readout here on

[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:00.780]
city post 24.

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:01.760]
they don't make mistakes,

[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:02.140]
they.

[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.400]
and of course, Robert being

[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.280]
that hard-ass little

[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.480]
subhating right-wing Jew

[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.180]
that he is, you know.

[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:08.620]
stick to the politics.

[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.640]
okay, stick your right-wing

[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.040]
politics.

[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.100]
we'll take care of the time.

[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.440]
okay.

[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.580]
stick to time magazine.

[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.220]
we'll take care of the

[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:13.660]
real time.

[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.020]
you silly person you.

[00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.180]
maybe he'd like to

[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.060]
be a lote with George Will.

[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:17.840]
I think they have a great

[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.460]
time to get it.

[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:19.800]
we're going to go to a

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.220]
ballgame.

[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.040]
27 past nine at five 60.

[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:23.600]
WQM.

[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:24.300]
here's something that's

[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:24.480]
great.

[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:27.600]
I skip you's not there today.

[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.380]
I left them a note.

[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:29.500]

ascending liberals still choose to

[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:04.480]
drive.

[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:06.260]
so are you happy now?

[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.880]
fill her up with arabico type 0

[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.980]
and fly in a flag proudly.

[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.400]
you can expect more from arabico

[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.820]
and you'll get it when you put a

[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.360]
dead child in your tank.

[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.800]
he was passed by the first

[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.160]
overmover bus speed bomber.

[00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.740]
how yet dude out there

[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:24.460]
springs out from the pocket trip

[00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.240]
and switch plate is coming

[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.860]
through in between horses.

[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.380]
we outwired for nuclear

[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.860]
sun bus speed bomber to a heavy

[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:32.280]
drive.

[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.260]
how about some racing from

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:33.780]
mohawk George?

[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:34.760]
okay.

[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.940]
i'm all for it.

[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]
that's going to be the poll

[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:38.860]
question.

[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.600]
what would you rather hear the

[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:40.560]
rest of the day racing from

[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.740]
last night's mohawk or

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.120]
leapson arrangers 1964.

[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.380]
anyway, what do we got here?

[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.260]
24 votes for slavery already.

[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:50.840]
12 for the 2000 presidential

[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:51.860]
election that was stolen very

[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:52.260]
clearly.

[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.800]
see what really pisses me off most

[00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:54.420]
about the media?

[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.560]
is because they sanitize.

[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.120]
i mean it's grotesque.

[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.440]
they have the ability to really

[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.140]
show us these images.

[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.200]
but you notice on the American

[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.620]
electronic media they don't want

[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.240]
us to see them.

[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.340]
and rumsfeld in his crowd.

[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.380]
they definitely don't want us to

[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:08.260]
see them because that would be

[00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:08.960]
really bad.

[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.120]
you know, is that the best

[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:10.740]
they can show us?

[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.560]
one of the show us something good.

[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.580]
yeah.

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:14.340]
show us.

[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:16.780]
such a pile of crap.

[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.680]
and i'm going to say it again.

[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.520]
you people in the electronic

[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.920]
media just about all of you.

[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.700]
you got to hang your heads

[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.580]
and shame your disgrace.

[00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.880]
and they had a piece last night

[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.980]
the guy in the, they had a

[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.120]
roundtable about the media

[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:26.820]
and the way that covered us

[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.660]
was on the cbc.

[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.680]
i wish i would have taped it.

[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.600]
because the one reported they

[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.740]
had over there who was one of

[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.180]
the several.

[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:34.420]
he was talking about the fact

[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.340]
that he was not embedded.

[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.040]
and that at the Kuwait

[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.740]
Kuwait city,

[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:38.480]
what it were, could have let

[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.360]
him in there for a love or

[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.280]
money because the Americans

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.060]
naturally after liberating Kuwait,

[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:42.920]
the Americans are the ones

[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:43.800]
that were calling the shots.

[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:45.140]
so they didn't want to let him

[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:45.680]
in there in the beginning.

[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:46.960]
he had like sneak his own way in.

[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.160]
but he talked about how the

[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.460]
embedded thing was a total

[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:50.880]
failure.

[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:52.740]
because these people were being

[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:54.440]
protected by these 1920-year-old

[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:54.660]
kids.

[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.980]
so naturally they owed their

[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.620]
lives to them.

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.020]
and they only reported

[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.880]
whatever the hell was politically

[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.320]
correct.

[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.000]
they weren't going to pee on

[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.160]
anybody's parade because their

[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.140]
lives depended on them.

[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:07.020]
and so we got this jaded view

[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.340]
of everything that was going on

[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.600]
and basically that was it.

[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.800]
although the good news is we got

[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:11.700]
kuse and sada.

[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:12.940]
and every street corner,

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:14.040]
it's a little suspicious

[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.980]
when they were in four different

[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.400]
street corners at the same time.

[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:16.920]
yeah.

[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:17.820]
we're starting to wonder

[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:18.480]
about that.

[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.220]
maybe even a Pentagon,

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:21.440]
all those great think tanks

[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:21.800]
over there,

[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:22.340]
some of those people,

[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.620]
you know, that don't look kosher

[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:23.840]
to me.

[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.700]
oh shinsa, that.

[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.580]
kosher probably wasn't the

[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.160]
appropriate word.

[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.120]
well let's take a few calls

[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.520]
here today.

[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.420]
they're ringing off the hook.

[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.320]
wqa m.

[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.520]
Georgia.

[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:33.320]
yes.

[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.520]
hey,

[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.740]
you left the slaughter

[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:37.720]
of the American Indians

[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.380]
off the list.

[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:40.400]
okay.

[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.220]
i think that should be

[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:42.700]
on the list.

[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.140]
that's why we're all

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.140]

[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:43.420]
okay, thanks.

[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.640]
we'll take you.

[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:44.880]
we'll take you.

[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.040]
we'll take you.

[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.040]
well we probably especially

[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.600]
ought to do that.

[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.500]
i'll call up Jeff DeFo

[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.340]
to see what Jeff says.

[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.420]
see what DeFo says about that.

[00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.380]
huh?

[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:52.980]
i'm just kidding.

[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.880]
DeFo is okay.

[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.780]
if big improvement over

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:55.680]
what we got there now.

[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:56.460]
pop had jenko.

[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.700]
look what we got in the morning.

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:59.000]
look what we got for a lead-in.

[00:28:59.300 --> 00:28:59.980]
i would wish our lead-in

[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:00.400]
on Hitler.

[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:01.720]
what do you think?

[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:02.540]
slaughter of the Indians?

[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.820]
yeah, sure.

[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.140]
i mean it was awful.

[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.820]
what about the rent-socks?

[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:11.020]
redskins.

[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.940]
oh and i don't start that.

[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.480]
redskins and pale skins and

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.080]
pail skins and seminals are

[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.040]
going to come get your ass in the

[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.060]
bingo anymore.

[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.100]
chiefs.

[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.060]
let's go over there and spin the

[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:19.720]
wheel this weekend.

[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.140]
what do you say?

[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.120]
i'll even fly down for that.

[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.200]
let's all go over and spin the

[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:22.440]
wheel.

[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.500]
are you weren't at that thing?

[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:25.200]
yes i was.

[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:25.780]
were you?

[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:26.740]
yes i was with the world.

[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.500]
we never got started.

[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:28.860]
we were talking to chairs over trying to

[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:29.140]
get the kids.

[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.420]
that's right.

[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.420]
we were the youngest people there

[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:30.840]
that day.

[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.780]
you were the youngest person there.

[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:34.960]
they said are you guys old enough

[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.620]
to be in here?

[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:36.300]
by a margin.

[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:38.120]
and then i brought out i had

[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.600]
barbed most bang for that.

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.700]
and when he saw his bang.

[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.280]
which reminds me of some of those

[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.880]
scenes in 4th of july which i don't

[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.360]
want to discuss.

[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:47.260]
you know the ones i'm talking about.

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.260]
oh the bed pan scene.

[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.040]
oh brother.

[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.760]
oh brother what the hell went on

[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:54.240]
over there.

[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.780]
and of course like i said it was just

[00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:56.500]
the body count.

[00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:57.040]
yeah.

[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.620]
they didn't give us honest body

[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.280]
counts and then even afterward

[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.260]
and we talk about well 58,000

[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.400]
kids came back in body back.

[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.020]
you know something?

[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:05.700]
those the ones who came back in

[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.940]
body bags were a hell of a lot

[00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:08.380]
better off than the ones who came

[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:09.280]
back in other form.

[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:09.860]
that's a deep shame.

[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.400]
but those were the lucky ones.

[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:11.780]
yeah.

[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:14.200]
58,000.

[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:17.540]
i grew up i went to high school

[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:18.860]
in little town of st. New York

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.320]
canaday when the earth the population

[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.360]
men for i graduated in 1960.

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:25.520]
1960 the population was 10,000

[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:25.800]
people.

[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.840]
43 years ago the population is

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.140]
still about 10,000 people.

[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.600]
it's not a place that tourists

[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.440]
like you know go about rushing

Americans are just alone in Vietnam.

[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:47.460]
not to count the hundreds of

[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:48.500]
thousands of Vietnamese.

[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.240]

and we just got through

[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.800]
doing the same thing again.

[00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:06.000]
and we got all these people

[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:06.820]
out there goose stepping

[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.880]
just like the Germans

[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.440]
goose step during WDW2.

[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.260]
how do you got to do is

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:11.100]
look at any of that documentary

[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:11.540]

[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:12.080]

[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.280]
they sucked up to a man they

[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.020]

[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.980]
to each land uber alas what

[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.680]
could be more appetizing than

[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:22.880]
that.

[00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:23.520]
we're the best.

[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:24.280]
we're number one.

[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:24.940]
yeah.

[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.260]

[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.180]
face of the globe that don't

[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:28.340]
like.

[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.900]
we're number one.

[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:30.680]
right.

[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:31.860]
here under the collective

[00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:32.560]
egos.

[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.500]
the jingoistic mentality of

[00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:34.900]
the public.

[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.180]
no matter where it is.

[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:38.760]

and that's basically what

[00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.320]
this whole pinnack thing is

[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.700]

[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:23.400]
more we just talking about

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.300]
former secretary of state

[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.040]

yesterday and the bechtel.

[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.480]
the initial award by the U.

[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.480]
s agency for international

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.720]
development was for 34.6

[00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:32.980]
million.

[00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:34.120]
all of the contract could be

[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.940]
worth up to 680 million over

[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:36.700]
18 months.

[00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.480]
the larger amount would be

[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.820]
this of some of the congressional

[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.140]
approval several democratic

[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:42.380]
lawmakers have complained the

[00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.500]
Bush administration did not

[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:45.200]
allow open competitive bidding

[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.800]
but rather invited a small

[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.980]
number of firms to submit

[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.700]
proposals a small number of

[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.240]
their buddies.

[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.240]
in addition to work on the

[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.420]
utility systems the contract

[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.740]
also provides for rehabilitation

[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.100]
repair of airport facilities

[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:56.840]
and dredging repair

[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:58.140]
and upgrading of the

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.060]
uncaused or seaport

[00:32:59.060 --> 00:32:59.860]
in cooperation with other

[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:00.500]
contractors.

[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.080]
bechtel may also have a

[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.520]
role in repair and reconstruction

[00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.060]
of hospital school, select

[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:05.760]
the government ministry

[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.720]
buildings, irrigation

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.960]
facilities and transportation

[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:08.400]
links.

[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.420]
in other words we went in

[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.320]
there and blew it all up and

[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.380]
now we're going to give them

[00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:12.800]
a whole crap load of money to

[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.120]
go back there and rebuild it.

[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:15.120]
what's up with that?

[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.200]
the agency said bechtel

[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.840]
would probably hire subcontractors

[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.060]
from any of the projects to

[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.000]
all of its activities and

[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:22.820]
would also engage the

[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:24.920]
Iraqi population and work

[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.640]
to build local

[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.400]
capacity right.

[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.420]
there you go.

[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:28.800]
bechtel, haliburton,

[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:31.760]
shell, exon,

[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.180]
they'll all be in there

[00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.560]
with their hands out.

[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.340]
because just like that bit

[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.200]
we played and just like

[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:37.900]
that scene in network,

[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:38.840]
the world is a business

[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.540]
vestibule.

[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:40.460]
that's what that baby said

[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.840]
and he was absolutely

[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:42.760]
correct.

[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:43.260]
right.

[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:45.040]
so all of this bullcrap

[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.300]
about the liberation of the

[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.400]
Iraqi people from this

[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.840]
evil dictator and weapons

[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.100]
of that.

[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:50.000]
by the way how many weapons

[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.060]
of action we find

[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:51.360]
yesterday.

[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:52.840]
oh, one is the big

[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.160]
oh.

[00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:55.660]
yeah.

[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:56.380]
let's see.

[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.280]
let's put that hockey game

[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:57.440]
on.

[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:57.980]
get depressed.

[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.020]
941.

[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.000]
that's on the good clock

[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:00.420]
by the way.

[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.380]
I'm 560QM.

[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:02.100]
not on most clock.

[00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:04.420]
560s.

[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:06.740]
there are all your

[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.240]

not only are some

[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.240]
american idol contestants

[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.700]
facing legal trouble.

[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.320]
now news reports are

[00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.560]
beginning to filter in

[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.300]

[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.980]
pulled from the throat to

[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.700]
Randy Jackson, an only

[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.220]
suffered minor abrasion.

[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.580]
later that same year,

[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.160]
Randy Jackson was charged

[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.980]
with reckless behavior after

[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.400]
attacking the manager of a

[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.740]
sizzler restaurant in

[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:18.860]
Tera Hoat, Indiana.

[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.880]
Jackson's stomach had to be

[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.420]
pumped and doctors reported

[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.800]
finding 300 shrimp and two

[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.860]
bags of buffalo bones.

[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.640]
1986, American Idol judge

[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.080]
Paula Abduel was charged

[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.800]
with public loonness after

[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.160]
incident at a Los Angeles

[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:35.480]
Lakers team van.

[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.120]
later that same year,

[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.800]
Paula Abduel was arrested

[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.180]
outside her ex-boyfriends

[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:40.640]
apartment.

[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.020]
This abduel allegedly

[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.220]
spray painted the words

[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.860]
cold-hearted snake on his

[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:45.420]
DeLorean.

[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.220]
947 at 560 WQM.

[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:49.900]
were you following all of

[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:50.040]
that?

[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:50.920]
Nope.

[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:51.760]
Good.

[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:53.320]
What was the worst

[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.000]
champion of American

[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.240]
history?

[00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:55.000]
I notice we haven't

[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:55.920]
put the slaughter of the

[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:56.680]
Indians on here.

[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.640]
Are we going to do that or

[00:35:57.640 --> 00:35:57.840]
not?

[00:35:58.980 --> 00:35:59.640]
Call us.

[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:00.700]
We are?

[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:02.560]
Well, what are we going to

[00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.180]
see it on there?

[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.200]
Well, I thought it could

[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:04.700]
do with the military.

[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.960]
No, that's not an answer to

[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:07.400]
my question.

[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.280]
When are we going to see that

[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:08.640]
on there?

[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:09.740]
You think Eric's busy again?

[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.580]
It is good Friday.

[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.380]
He's probably having some

[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.300]
macaroni and cheese for

[00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:12.840]
breakfasts.

[00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.900]
About 30 seconds.

[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:14.960]
How many?

[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.440]
About 30, man.

[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.320]
Slavery 44 votes.

[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:19.640]
The 2000 presidential

[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:20.860]
election 24, which

[00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:21.640]
of course bogus.

[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:22.220]
You know what?

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:23.900]
What?

[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:25.780]
I was thinking last night.

[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:26.960]
So many things came to my

[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.940]
mind as I was watching it.

[00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.060]
Born on the 4th of July.

[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.980]
And I was thinking about the

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:33.960]
course Kent State really was

[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.260]
a nauseating, grotesque

[00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:35.560]
chapter.

[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.300]
And then we saw the...

[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:37.480]
Oh, and also talk about my

[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:38.240]
psychic powers?

[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.720]
What town did I mention on

[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.080]
the year on Wednesday?

[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:43.980]
On the show.

[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:45.500]
Right out of the blue.

[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:45.940]
I don't know.

[00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.820]
And keep in mind I've

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:47.820]
never seen born on the 4th of

[00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:48.140]
July.

[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:49.800]
I had no idea where he was

[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:50.100]
from.

[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:50.720]
I don't know.

[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:51.080]
I forgot.

[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:51.400]
I do it.

[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.460]
Massive people along Iowa

[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:53.160]
on the same day.

[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.720]
I don't know why I was just

[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.140]
kidding around.

[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.640]
And come to fight out where

[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:57.500]
did his family live?

[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.640]
Massive people in New York.

[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.440]
My friend in college,

[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.560]
Pete Stassu, was from Massive

[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.140]
people in New York.

[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:03.800]
How do you like that?

[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.640]
I'm Long Island.

[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.000]
His family was in a

[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.460]
fur business.

[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.180]
They had a lot of money.

[00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:08.540]
They ever heard from him again.

[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:11.140]
At any rate, how do you like

[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:11.320]
that?

[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:11.920]
Huh.

[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:13.340]
But I was thinking about that

[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.860]
thing in Dave County, the

[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:17.840]
2000 election, that group of

[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:21.620]
people who were out there

[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.380]
from outside the Florida.

[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:24.840]
And they're all out there

[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.460]
pounding out there.

[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.480]
What else in?

[00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:27.380]
What else in?

[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:27.580]

[00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:28.340]
That's what I thought of when

[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:28.840]
they were shown in 1972.

[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:30.600]
Republican Convention on

[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.100]
Miami Beach.

[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:31.820]
I was thinking of these

[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:32.840]
assholes that were out there

[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.820]
because they had the

[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.460]
fiction, baby.

[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.480]
The whole thing was

[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:36.260]
orchestrated.

[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:38.860]
And then when they finally

[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:39.920]
when they started counting the

[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.220]
votes again, that last time

[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.280]
and start getting really

[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.660]
close, and the margin was

[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.220]
down to just a small handful

[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:45.920]
which some of us can

[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:46.360]
relate to.

[00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.420]
A small handful.

[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.500]
Then all of us said the

[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:49.080]
sub-decipient courts

[00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:49.880]
right in there.

[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:52.200]
Oh well, you know.

[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:55.420]
One of them things.

[00:37:57.540 --> 00:37:58.820]
I said, oh, we don't want to

[00:37:58.820 --> 00:38:00.000]
recount anymore votes because

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.360]
it could turn out bad.

[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.400]
Just like Lou Dobbsen,

[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:04.120]
the other night.

[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:05.720]
Yeah, I prefer to look at the

[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.620]
glasses half full.

[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:08.780]
What was the worst

[00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:09.900]
chapter in American history?

[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:10.680]
We asked, we will put

[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.700]
slot of the Indians on there

[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.720]
because that is embarrassing

[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:13.920]
and grotesque and humiliating

[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:14.840]
and on behalf of all

[00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:15.620]
Americans we want to

[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:17.400]
apologize, although it's

[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.500]
four on the red.

[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.080]
Huh?

[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:21.960]
Where's the four on the

[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:22.160]
G?

[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:22.720]
I don't know.

[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:25.620]
Slavery 45, 2000 presidential

[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:26.660]
election 25.

[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:28.540]
It is graceful chapter.

[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.220]
It happened right in front

[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:29.700]
of your post.

[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:31.540]
Assassinations of the 60s,

[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.300]
JFK, MLK, and RFK17, which

[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.000]
to me was, that was the last

[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:36.380]
chance.

[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.660]
After that, that's it.

[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:38.740]
Game over.

[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.660]
Civil War 16, Vietnam 13,

[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.140]
attack on Iraq 8, the

[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.360]
Prussian 6, Monica Gate

[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:47.380]
3, Watergate 2, and the

[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:47.380]

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.700]
Gulf War 2 has got one, and

[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.040]
the Gulf War 1 and World War

[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.920]
1 each have zero.

[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:54.600]
But it's interesting that

[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.420]
those three events only

[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.320]
have one vote, and I don't

[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.080]
even know why they vote

[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:58.800]
for those, but I had to

[00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.220]
put them on there.

[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.220]
But attack on Iraq

[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:00.920]
so it's already got eight.

[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:02.040]
Get it?

[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:02.760]
Got it.

[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.020]
Here's the fact from

[00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.640]
all the Indians here, if you

[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:05.780]
lose usually, run on it.

[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.540]
But he says, you might want

[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.400]
to consider the American

[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.060]
revolution, which basically

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.080]
was the starting line for

[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.920]
the power grab race in this

[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:13.680]
country, which has never

[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.220]
been interrupted.

[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:15.280]
No.

[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:17.300]
Although then he goes out

[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.080]
and there be even self by

[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.580]
saying, my vote goes to the

[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.000]
assassinations of the 60s since

[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.340]
the signal, the existence of

[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.240]
the previously hidden power

[00:39:23.240 --> 00:39:24.820]
agenda, at that point in time,

[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:25.300]
the myth of constitutional

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.900]
guarantees was shattered.

[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:29.040]
The power structure changed

[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.240]
the course of politics in this

[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.420]
country forever, not just

[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.940]
of politics, but in life in this

[00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:33.920]
country forever, Wally.

[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.320]
If anyone dared to lead with a

[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.400]
different agenda, he would end

[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.160]
up with the ultimate

[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.540]
sacrifice, and I should point

[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.460]
out, speaking of born on the

[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.560]
fourth of July, that Eisen

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.260]
hour sent the first

[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.700]
advisers to Vietnam, Kennedy

[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:47.280]
sent others, but he all

[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:48.760]
had made very, very clear he had

[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.720]
made a pledge that by

[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.280]
January 1st to 65, that all

[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.280]
the advisers would be brought

[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.100]
home from Vietnam.

[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:55.780]
January 165.

[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:56.880]
Well, guess what?

[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.180]
He wasn't around to see

[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.360]
January 165.

[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:01.020]
I just mentioned that in

[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:01.720]
passing, okay?

[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.900]
And if anybody really

[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.360]
believes in Lee Harvey Oswald

[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:07.260]
Bullcrap and the Sirhan

[00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.860]
Sirhan Crap, and who's the

[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.760]
guy that shot MLK

[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.740]
allegedly who just died?

[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:12.260]
Oh, a block-shock

[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:12.580]
Sharok.

[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:13.160]
What was his name?

[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:13.880]
No, come on.

[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.820]
It's good, serious.

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.200]
Right here.

[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.560]
James Earl Ray.

[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:19.880]
James Earl Ray.

[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:20.700]
I thought he did the

[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:21.480]
voices on CNN.

[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.640]
This is James O'Jodes.

[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.180]
Here's one that says if you

[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.960]
read it, oh, this is

[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:26.740]
depressing, but of course

[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.200]
it's in Rupert Murdoch right

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200]
when New York Post, they're

[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.260]
probably felling from it.

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.520]
On page 11, the

[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:34.840]
page 6, actually they call it

[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.160]
the entertainment gossip

[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.340]
stuff in New York Post

[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:40.460]
today, they have a new

[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:40.820]
website.

[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.160]
We've got the Oscar.com.

[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:43.080]
These people want to take

[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.300]
away Michael Morzansker for

[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.040]
his movie, bowling for

[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.980]
Columban and they tell why in

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.760]
the article, did you read the

[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.480]
book, Pig at the Trap?

[00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:49.020]
No, I did not.

[00:40:49.260 --> 00:40:50.080]
And also don't want to see the

[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:50.480]
New York Post.

[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:51.820]
They want to take away his

[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.020]
because they didn't like what

[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:53.460]
he said.

[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.140]
So it was a great movie and

[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.140]
he deserved the Oscar if he

[00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.760]
would have just kept his

[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.160]
mouth shut.

[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:58.300]
I mean, what are we talking

[00:40:58.300 --> 00:40:59.520]
about here, boys and girls,

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:40:59.820]
huh?

[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.280]
What are we talking about?

[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:02.740]
Talk about politically

[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.100]
correct and taken into a new

[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:04.420]
level.

[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:06.860]
Your work is great, but just

[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.360]
dummy up.

[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.160]
Don't mention nothing about

[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:08.940]
that we don't like.

[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.760]
Otherwise, we'll take your

[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.580]
statue away.

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.920]
Ooh, top.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.060]
Like we did in Baghdad,

[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.400]
we took their statue away.

[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.920]
Oh, now if you read our

[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:18.800]
website yesterday, there was

[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.700]
all stage just like I

[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:21.640]
commented at the time.

[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:22.420]
It seemed like there was a

[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.640]
very, and I'm only was at

[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.760]
stage, but those people were

[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.440]
brought in too.

[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.300]
They were brought in.

[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.820]
This is a disturbing thing.

[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.700]
Oh, by Robert Novak, that

[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:33.620]
amazing.

[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.840]
The ultimate right-wing

[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.940]
asshole, but never less than

[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.340]
Chicago sometimes today, or

[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:40.220]
he writes, or yesterday, coinciding

[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.220]
with the Bush administration's

[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:42.800]
tough talk about Syria, a

[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.040]
senior Israeli official

[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.760]
Monday exposed a smoking gun.

[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.160]
Defense Minister Sha'ul Mofa

[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.600]
told the Tel Aviv newspaper, Ma

[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.060]
Reeve, we have a long list of

[00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:51.840]
issues we're thinking of

[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.220]
demanding the Syrians, and it

[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.180]
would be best done through the

[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:54.620]
Americans.

[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:55.840]
In other words, like it says

[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:57.480]
here, strike on Syria while they

[00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:57.960]
are in hot.

[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:58.920]
You already got the tube

[00:41:58.920 --> 00:41:59.820]
so, but let's go in.

[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:00.280]
What do you say?

[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:01.240]
All right.

[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:02.500]
I like what Lawrence Eagle

[00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:03.360]
Barrier said a couple of days

[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:03.640]
ago.

[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.900]
But if you think about going

[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:06.500]
in here, he ought to be

[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:07.060]
impeached.

[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:09.480]
That's what I'm thinking.

[00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.040]
Stuttering Girlen Homestead,

[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:12.340]
who's another one of our

[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.020]
chronic regulars, but we

[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:16.080]
are pretty good.

[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.060]
Of course, that's what you

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.800]
only said to ones that are

[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:17.980]
good.

[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:18.260]

[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:20.520]
He says, how about your

[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:21.680]
rank Comptor scandal with

[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.180]
Ali North?

[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.580]
Well, you know, it was

[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:24.760]
embarrassing and asked you

[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:25.720]
et cetera, but not in the

[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.740]
category with these others.

[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:27.280]
All right.

[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.020]
Small potatoes.

[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.220]
That's what Ali said on his

[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:30.760]
radio show.

[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:32.880]
Also, you asked yesterday if I

[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.000]
was already into one and that

[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.040]
other is Stuttering Steve

[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.240]
guy.

[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:35.980]
And morning show on the

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.680]
answer is no.

[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:37.600]
Well, thank goodness for

[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.880]
Stuttering Girlen Homestead.

[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:39.720]
There's no relation to Girl

[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.540]
Segal from the Kamilahs house.

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.860]
5 6 7 0 5 60 on some more

[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:45.560]
bad news.

[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.360]
I don't want to do this on

[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:46.780]
good Friday.

[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:47.640]
It's a holiday weekend.

[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:48.460]
Everybody's supposed to be in

[00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.120]
a good mood whether you

[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:49.660]
want to be or not.

[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.940]
The warning is down to yellow.

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:54.420]
Bush Cultural Advisors quit

[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.700]
over Iraq Museum theft.

[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:56.280]
Oh, no.

[00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.560]
Now it says two, but this was

[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.040]
time when I was yesterday.

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:01.540]
I have no one.

[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.000]
I got this, but later on, three

[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.140]
cultural advisers to the

[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.020]
Bush administration have

[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.820]
resigned and protest over

[00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.360]
failure of US forces to prevent

[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:09.540]
the wholesale looting of

[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.580]
priceless treasures from

[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.520]
Baghdad's antiquity.

[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:13.820]
The

[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.800]
former president of the

[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.780]
United States, the

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.780]

[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:16.800]
United States, the

[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:16.800]

[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:16.820]
United States, the

[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:16.820]

[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:16.940]
United States, the

[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:17.440]
former president of the

[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:17.500]
United States, the

[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:17.580]
former president of the

[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.280]
United States, the

[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:18.580]
former president of the

[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:18.840]
United States, the

[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.480]
former president of the

[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:19.880]
United States, the

[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:20.800]
former president of the

[00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:21.720]
United States, the

[00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:21.980]
former microphone on

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:21.980]

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:27.020]
We don't know the crop

[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:34.960]
action, but we know the

[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.420]
suits, but it's just

[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.940]
a story.

[00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.600]
We get any calls about Dr. Bob yet?

[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:43.780]
No.

[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:45.020]
Dr. Rackens, come on.

[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.600]
You on grateful bastards out there.

[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.360]
This man probably is responsible for a lot of you people

[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.780]
who will be still be alive since I helped popularize

[00:43:51.780 --> 00:43:53.400]
the Atkins diet down here in South Florida.

[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.560]
One of my great claims to fame besides Wilka Burgers

[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.980]
and was in the fish food.

[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.900]
I guess that's about it in 27 years.

[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:01.480]
Can't have everything.

[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.560]
Well, you beat the Penny sales tax, too.

[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.900]
And the Penny sales tax?

[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.440]
That's right.

[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.680]
Yeah, let's get our call from my what's his name?

[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:08.700]
Dave the Attrophic guy.

[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:09.180]
What's his name?

[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:09.420]
Dave.

[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.340]
What does he mean?

[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.880]
I can't remember his name.

[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:14.440]
Slater.

[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:14.920]
Mark Slater.

[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:16.280]
Slater.

[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:17.260]
Dave Slater.

[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:17.660]
Very good.

[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:19.040]
And Mark Friedman with a bad haircut.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.320]
Richard Friedman.

[00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.120]
I'm sorry, Richard.

[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:21.700]
Sorry, Dick.

[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.340]
And don't be singing on more songs, Dick.

[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:23.800]
It's embarrassing.

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.800]
Anybody that goes out there in public with a hair piece?

[00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:27.760]
That'd be a good pull someday.

[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:28.620]
Who's got the worst hair piece?

[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.360]
Richard Friedman or Moe with a Moe Meister?

[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:32.720]
I'd like to see a battle between those two muskrats.

[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.300]
We talk about watching a muskrat ramble.

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:41.560]
We're supporting you 560, QAM.

[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.600]
Friday, you bastard.

[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:49.120]
My religion's better than your religion.

[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.060]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:54.700]
My beliefs are what's required.

[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:56.660]
You avoid a lame of fire.

[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.040]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.160]
My religion's better than your religion.

[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.980]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.380]
My religion is to help keep the big'sry and racially

[00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:12.920]
my religion is better than yours.

[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.400]
My religion's better than yours.

[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.660]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:23.880]
What we like about this best time for boys коi is

[00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:25.560]
an wear the dress for my religion.

[00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:26.840]
Five keyed wedders than yours.

[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.760]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.000]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.140]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:40.720]
We have no respect for women's driver cap to make a living by religion better than yours.

[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.140]
My religion better than yours.

[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.800]
My religion better than yours.

[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.300]
My religion better than yours.

[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.740]
Chupa hapras, kuki ghost, we slaughter pigs and dogs and goats.

[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.740]
My religion better than yours.

[00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.460]
My religion better than yours.

[00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:03.780]
My religion better than yours.

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:06.900]
We were teeny-sententic children, never ever pay me sale.

[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.220]
My religion better than yours.

[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.460]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.960]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:20.880]
We knock on doors to bother you like former brushless URU.

[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:22.720]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.620]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.940]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:35.040]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and get to very lots of wives.

[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.040]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.840]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.200]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.940]
We don't want to use our brains for mindless living, operate.

[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.480]
My religion is better than yours.

[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.040]
Happy Easter, happy paysocks, on happy good Friday, whatever the news.

[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.640]
Bad here in Toronto, man, they can't kiss the chalice.

[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:03.060]
I mean, they can't kiss the, uh, and they can't, what was that line this morning before the show?

[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.520]
They can't take communion on the tongue.

[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:07.740]
On the tongue, they can't take it on the tongue.

[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.900]
And the altibor said that I'm too happy about the, uh, rectum, either.

[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.800]
Footage appears to show Sodom who say in his final public appearance.

[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.440]
Here's the story in print from the Boston Globe, which of course is right on top of things.

[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.440]
Boston.com for anybody who wants to really see what's going on like currently.

[00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:32.620]
Abu Dhabi TV aired pictures today of what it said was Iraqi leader Sodom who stayed on the streets of Baghdad last week being greeted by cheering crowds of Iraqis.

[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.180]
Last Wednesday's matter, fact.

[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:39.040]
Abu Dhabi TV said the film was shot April 9th and the US forces moved into Baghdad.

[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.580]
The footage of authentic would mean an April 7th American bombing him to killing Iraqi president was unsuccessful.

[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.920]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of that, they had on news last night that they did go in there and they went through the rubble.

[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.640]
Did they find him?

[00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:48.920]
No.

[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:49.200]
No.

[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.620]
Not even his foot.

[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:54.360]
Not a foot, not a toe, not the, I put it here enough is tash.

[00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:55.380]
Nothing.

[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.080]
Oh, and the neighbors there said, oh, they were at the wrong house.

[00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.720]
He was, he was seen at the house next door.

[00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:02.500]
Oops.

[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.200]
He said, oops, our bad.

[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.120]
There were people in there, but it was a family.

[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:09.740]
And of course, you know that they dragged bodies of young children or other, etc.

[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.640]
But we just seem to be having these misfires.

[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.120]
They were close, but no cigar.

[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.100]
I'm starting up again.

[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:14.620]
They didn't miss.

[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:16.420]
The US said it was studying the tape.

[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:22.220]
However, in a Iraqi envoy, loyal to Saddam said Friday he was confident that Iraqi president was killed by the coalition bombing of Baghdad.

[00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:26.240]
I know his character, Iraq's ambassador to Belgrade, Sami Sadun.

[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.880]
I thought he played for Ottawa.

[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:30.600]
I know he plays for the flyers now.

[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.620]
Sami Sadun told the AP and the interview, the defensive Baghdad would not have collapsed so quickly if he wasn't dead.

[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.460]
I thought the defense collapsed because they made a deal.

[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:40.600]
Can you see Mali Hall in there?

[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:41.180]
Right.

[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:41.860]
Door number three.

[00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:43.560]
Yeah, door is number one, two and three.

[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.020]
Oh, that's right.

[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:45.740]
There's all those artifacts behind door number three.

[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.380]
We'll take those.

[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:47.680]
So there you go.

[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:54.060]
Anybody believes that that Saddam and Kusay, both of them, of course, we know had 85,000 plastic surgeries and about 450 doubles.

[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.980]
Even Pete Rosenow had as many doubles.

[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:03.060]
This is a good article on our website, but unfortunately I noticed in passing here that there's a word missing.

[00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.540]
So I had to go back and I found the word.

[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.660]
We apologize for that, but it's short.

[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:14.680]
No president should be above criticism by Dennis McWilliams and the Zainsville Times recorder.

[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.000]
Zainsville, Ohio, you've been there?

[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.120]
No, don't.

[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.080]
I've never been there either.

[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:19.540]
Huh?

[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.200]
Cleveland.

[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.800]
You've been there?

[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.100]
Yeah.

[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:23.400]
What do you like you are?

[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.680]
Anyway, Dennis McWilliams says, as I read some of the mail, I repeatedly recognize recurring themes.

[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:30.560]
Idol worship.

[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:34.600]
I bizarre mixture of fundamentalism, radical right wing politics and veneration of politicians.

[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:39.680]
I'm sorry, but no president of the U.S. is a candidate for beatification or a sainthood.

[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:44.720]
A recent letter stated it's also brought to light some serious flaws in the moral fiber of our country.

[00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:50.440]
Much of that is reflected in the hideous display of disrespect to the office of the president and the man who not occupies that office.

[00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:57.180]
This writer remarkably equates our constitutionally guaranteed freedom of political dissent with serious flaws in the moral fiber of our country.

[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:57.940]
Strange.

[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.320]
On the contrary, I suggest someone study a little American history.

[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.780]
George Washington was called a jackass in a number of opposition newspapers.

[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.460]
Every president since has been called names a lot worse than jackass.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:13.260]
To say that the president should be beyond criticism is both absurd and un-American.

[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.340]
Contrary to some of his partisan wishes, George the tooth is not our king in order to his touch-heal disease.

[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:25.780]
In addition, contrary to the belief of some of the members of his cult, George W. Bush is not anointed by God, not even by...

[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.420]
Still God.

[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:27.640]
...and especially not by...

[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.340]
Still God.

[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.580]
...in 1912, Theodore Roosevelt wrote,

[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:34.580]
The president is merely the most important among a large number of public servants.

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:39.620]
He should be supported or opposed exactly to the degree which is warranted by his good conduct or bad conduct,

[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:44.360]
his efficiency or inefficiency in rendering loyal able and disinterested service to the nation as a whole.

[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:49.360]
Therefore, it is absolutely necessary that there should be full liberty to tell the truth about his acts,

[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.020]
and this means that it is exactly as necessary to blame him when he does wrong as to praise him when he does right.

[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.380]
Any other attitude in an American citizen is both base and survival.

[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:02.440]
To announce that there must be no criticism of the president that were to stand by the president right or wrong,

[00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.380]
is not only unpatriotic and survival, but is morally treasonable to the American public.

[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.280]
Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or anyone else.

[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.680]
But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant and unpleasant about him than about anybody else.

[00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:16.280]
Dennis McWilliams goes on to write,

[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:20.680]
in my view, the statement that any president was appointed and anointed by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

[00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:23.780]
for such a time as we now face, contains a whiff of blasphemy.

[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.380]
It is so disgusting, your concept, the whole name of Jesus Christ without a politician,

[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:32.440]
it is also repugnant to the constitation of the Constitution of the United States of America.

[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:33.060]
I don't know like that.

[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:34.360]
I caught a whiff.

[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:35.720]
You get a whiff of it?

[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:36.720]
Ooh.

[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:40.700]
So someone as notorious as Teddy Roosevelt writes that, huh?

[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:41.040]
Yeah.

[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:45.680]
And he sure had his critics, including some of the Indians and the Filipinos.

[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.360]
Who cares about them?

[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.680]
We did put the Indians on air, by the way that God was right, he had a good point.

[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:51.380]
We left one off.

[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.860]
But this isn't the list we need to build.

[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.660]
I don't think there's anything else needs to be on here unless we really screwed up.

[00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:56.380]
We've got the big ones.

[00:51:56.740 --> 00:52:01.400]
What was the worst chapter in American history we asked on neo-roger.com today, 189 votes,

[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:07.740]
slavery 57, a 2000 presidential election 34, a total fraud,

[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:13.440]
Civil War 22, the assassinations of the 60s, also 22, Vietnam 20.

[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.360]
How can Vietnam only have 20 votes?

[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.860]
See, I was thinking about this also watching Born on the Fourth of July.

[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:21.620]
I guess I was doing a lot of thinking last night.

[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:22.940]
Yeah.

[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:29.580]
And that is that unless you're at least 40, you don't understand what was really all about.

[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.120]
You have no concept of what Vietnam was all about and what we just got through doing last month.

[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.700]
You have no concept of it.

[00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:35.020]
Right.

[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:41.680]
Because the war ended in 1975 finally, thanks to enormous public pressure,

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.860]
thanks to the fact that the media finally caught on and we started seeing some of the grotesque horrendous,

[00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:53.060]
acceptable images from there and getting the stories of the me, my massacre and the other amazing things that were going on there.

[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:55.120]
Just, I didn't want to talk about them.

[00:52:55.980 --> 00:53:00.800]
Only 20 votes for Vietnam, but unless you're like, so let's see, 25, that's 20 years ago.

[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.620]
So I'm being generous when I say 40, because if you were 12, you wouldn't even give the gist of it.

[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:07.200]
How old would you have to be like 15, 16?

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:08.440]
At least.

[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:09.740]
I mean, I was aware.

[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.960]
I was up to date. I saw TV.

[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:12.860]
Yeah.

[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.600]
But not a lot of people around me were.

[00:53:14.740 --> 00:53:18.860]
So unless you're at least in your 40s, you know nothing about so all these other punks that are out there running around.

[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.800]
Wow, we had to go in there and kick his ass and they haven't got any idea what they're talking about.

[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.780]
They're entitled to their opinion. They'll get me wrong, but they're full of crap.

[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.880]
Vietnam 20, the Depression 12.

[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:30.480]
How is Heber Hoover doing, by the way?

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:36.620]
The attack on Iraq 8, Monica Gate 7, slaughtered the American Indians up to 5 already a late addition.

[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:37.700]
Default called it in.

[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:43.120]
Watergate 3, W-W-W-2 had won. W-W-W-1 has 0 and Gulf War 1 has 0.

[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.140]
And there you go. That's where it's at.

[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:51.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60. On the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.820]
Don't forget George with those bigger appearances today and tomorrow.

[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:54.360]
Oh yeah.

[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.640]
And I know he's really looking forward to me. He needs the cash.

[00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.800]
Okay. In fact, bring him a suitcase full of money.

[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.020]
Please.

[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:01.040]
We didn't have to keep going out and dehumanizing himself.

[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:03.400]
So he can spend some time with his family at home. Right.

[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.120]
W-W-Q-A-N.

[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:06.100]
Nail.

[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:06.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.640]
I know you said you didn't want a list build.

[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:12.420]
But what about the internment of the Japanese American starring World War II?

[00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:13.700]
That was pretty nasty.

[00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:14.500]
Yeah.

[00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:19.020]
It kind of reminds me of what they're doing with these so-called interviews with the Iraqi Americans right now,

[00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:19.960]
the last few weeks.

[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.140]
And no question.

[00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:22.740]
10,000 of them, you know, less.

[00:54:22.900 --> 00:54:23.220]
Exactly.

[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:25.860]
No lawyer, no getting out of jail free.

[00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.120]
Yeah, that should be on there. You're right.

[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.380]
What else was I going to talk to you about?

[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.760]
What else was I going to talk to you about?

[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:38.580]
You know, we were talking, you were talking about how, you know, the Iraqi minister of propaganda was so laughable.

[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.280]
Mm-hmm.

[00:54:39.620 --> 00:54:44.300]
Well, I tuned over because of the Marlins pregame show yesterday to your good fed buddy.

[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.200]
And he's just a big deal.

[00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:48.340]
We have people who believe him.

[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:50.800]
So, I mean, I guess it's sort of he's like the right-wing version.

[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.300]
Yeah, but at least the Iraqi Information Minister was humorous.

[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.180]
Laradass ain't funny. He's just dangerous.

[00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.680]
I could have a point there.

[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.940]
Because at least the Iraqi Information Minister, we knew he was full of crap.

[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.520]
And he knew that we knew he was full of crap.

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.240]
But would Laradass, the ditto heads all believe whatever the hell he said, if he farted, they stick their nose in it.

[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.140]
One more thing.

[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.840]
Why is it that we're boycotting all French stuff, but not German stuff?

[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:14.400]
And they're just against this as the French.

[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:16.140]
Because we like our Venus knitzel.

[00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:18.000]
And our American pal.

[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:18.560]
Yep.

[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.040]
See ya.

[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:20.440]
Okay. What do you say?

[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.800]
So let's see.

[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.740]
Let's put that on there too.

[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:24.380]
You got a Carlos.

[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:25.700]
I don't want any dirty, dally.

[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.200]
And it sure took us a long time to get the start of the American Indians out there.

[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.080]
That's already up to seven.

[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:32.140]
The internment of Japanese Americans during WDW2.

[00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:33.140]
Got it?

[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:34.560]
We got it.

[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:35.300]
Got it.

[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:36.600]
That was unbelievable.

[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.020]
But we just don't trust anybody.

[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:40.920]
You know, they probably were all a bunch of spies.

[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.320]
Just like all you schmatteds out there.

[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:44.880]
All must be a bunch of spies.

[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.820]
And John Asgroz is going to come knocking on your door about three o'clock in the morning.

[00:55:48.020 --> 00:55:50.840]
And the worst part of his, Xavier Suarez is going to be standing with him in his bathroom.

[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:51.840]
Yeah.

[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.820]
Wait, ain't got nothing else to do these days.

[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:56.960]
He's just looking for votes.

[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.540]
He wants to see if he has any dead people hidden in the back.

[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.360]
He can put their name on list and get his vote next time he runs for office.

[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.440]
Because it's the same bunch of been animal people anyway.

[00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:06.700]
Keep running for office and date County over and over again.

[00:56:07.700 --> 00:56:10.400]
When's the last time that we had somebody in office who didn't have a,

[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.080]
I'm not talking about in the city of Miami whose last name didn't end in a Z.

[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:15.740]
Joe Caldera.

[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:16.560]
That's it.

[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:18.000]
So I say bring them back.

[00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.240]
Right?

[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.600]
You got many D.S.?

[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:22.800]
Yeah.

[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.400]
And sit for Nandes.

[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.860]
And Roderick Es, George Roderick Es.

[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:29.640]
Of course.

[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.820]
I mean, we're getting tired of this whole zebanus.

[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:35.820]
Let's bring back Joe Caldera, who's named it in the big,

[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:37.420]
I think he was fun, you know,

[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.360]
had his tea bag kept getting grabbed.

[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.900]
From minutes after 10 at five, of course, I guess he wishes his wife would have kept grabbing his tea bag,

[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.220]
but didn't work out when it got to work out.

[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:50.680]
And by the way, is what's his name any speaking of Fernandez?

[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:51.420]
What was it?

[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:52.040]
Oh, yeah.

[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:53.320]
Was it Fernandez?

[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:53.860]
Fernandez?

[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:54.160]
Okay.

[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.200]
One of those E people's three.

[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.760]
And his wife was banging his attorney.

[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:58.800]
Right?

[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:00.260]
While he was in a slamer.

[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:01.220]
Yeah.

[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:03.420]
The attorney was slamming her and he was in a slamer.

[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:03.760]
Wow.

[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:06.440]
Pretty amazing stuff goes on here in Dade County.

[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:09.620]
And the good news is, if you think we're going to like dwell on this war stuff all day,

[00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:10.340]
you're wrong about that,

[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:13.120]
cause as we're way ahead of you with these tabloids up here,

[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:15.180]

[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:16.900]
all the new tabloids are out.

[00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:21.040]
The April 29th edition is including an OJ shocker who says,

[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:23.280]
I want Sydney his daughter to disappear.

[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:24.140]
Woo!

[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.160]
How Dr. Laura's mom really died?

[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.480]
Snoop Doggie dogs, Rachi video could cost him his life.

[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.000]
Dr. Fills' keen sex shame.

[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.440]

[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.120]
He's not gay.

[00:57:42.220 --> 00:57:43.700]
Ozzie's wife beaten up in a restaurant.

[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:46.040]
How come we haven't any calls about passions yesterday?

[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:47.160]
I give up.

[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:49.360]
Oh my god, talk about the booze boards.

[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:50.120]
That was the best.

[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:52.980]
I've watched the, before I watched the new one yesterday at 330,

[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:57.540]
Stop it.

[00:59:57.700 --> 00:59:59.760]
It's sake, you she's fresh meathouse.

[01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:02.200]
You'll never eat beef the same way again.

[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:05.560]
Kind of a cross between Bubba the Loves Bunch and Aaron Chef, wouldn't you think?

[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.040]
I think.

[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.140]
10, 18, at 5, 60 W to QYM.

[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:14.040]
And those pictures we have on a website, which are even more gruesome than just the couple we had on there before.

[01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:14.920]
And I'm very proud of that.

[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:17.720]
That's what we ought to be seeing on the Nightly News every night.

[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.240]
If we would have seen that during the early days of Vietnam, it would have stopped in a real hurry.

[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:23.460]
Believe me.

[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.400]
Yeah, but that's a bummer.

[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:28.620]
That means it's a bummer, but it happens to be the truth.

[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:29.240]
It's reality.

[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.660]
Like I said before, if we would have seen it in the beginning,

[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:33.640]
Vietnam would have been over in about six months.

[01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:38.560]
Here's the fact that it says the worst chapter in America may be written in the very near future.

[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:42.620]
If the Bush Junta is able to maintain control of the White House, it's snatched from the American people in 2000.

[01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:47.780]
In the Supreme Court led coup.

[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.420]
If this travesty comes to pass, it'll make all others in your pool, paled in comparison.

[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.800]
George W. Bush campaigned 2000 quoted as saying, I'm a united, or not a divider.

[01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.280]
And it says, Bush has united the world against us.

[01:00:59.420 --> 01:00:59.720]
Very good.

[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:00.960]
Very good, sir.

[01:01:01.180 --> 01:01:02.380]
And I would hand them the bed.

[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.480]
56670560, pound 560.

[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.120]
Slavery seems to be the winner.

[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.680]
66, so at least so far.

[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:10.740]
A long way to go all weekend.

[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.720]
The 2000 presidential elections got 46.

[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.040]
Vietnam has still only got 23 votes.

[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.320]
What is wrong with these people?

[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:18.160]
Huh?

[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:19.320]
I don't know.

[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:22.540]
That's why I think they all need to see Born on the Fourth of July again over the weekend.

[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.420]
Get the DVD and put on your BVDs and believe me, you'll need to.

[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.920]
We'll probably be filling them up several times watching that.

[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.820]
And then think about it.

[01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:31.620]
Thinking.

[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.440]
What happened to the phone here?

[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.160]
We're doing screenless, I should point out.

[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.160]
So if you don't continue right away, just, uh, tough to do.

[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:37.920]
Just hang on.

[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.240]
56670560, pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.060]
One call on screenless.

[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:45.660]
WQIM.

[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:48.360]
Hello.

[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.780]
Like I said, one call was left on screenless.

[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:53.860]
They're not even there anymore on.

[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.580]
Wow, what the hell just happened?

[01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.820]
Maybe, huh?

[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:57.820]
I'm just checking.

[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:00.440]
I was on a right line, line 4, okay?

[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.800]
I know what to be going on here.

[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:02.420]
I was on line 4.

[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:03.360]
WQIM.

[01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:04.380]
Neil.

[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:05.140]
Yes, sir.

[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.280]
Good morning.

[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.920]
It's, um, it's funny that you were talking about Born on the Fourth of July in MassPickle Park

[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:22.160]
because I grew up there and, uh, went to MassPickle High School and Ron Covec graduated from that high school some years before me.

[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:28.940]
But, um, originally that movie, they started filming in, I think it was 1979.

[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:30.800]
That was the year that I graduated.

[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.820]
And Al Pacino actually started to make the movie.

[01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:43.800]
And it was all a hubbobbing town and he had rented a house and they closed down the local movie theater and they were filming here there.

[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:45.420]
They were filming in my high school at night.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.220]
And it's went on for a couple of months and then they stopped making the movie and to just stay, and I'm 42.

[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.940]
And I was 17 back then.

[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:58.500]
I never found out why the hell the movie never ceased without Pacino.

[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:05.880]
So if any of your listeners knows the answer to that, I've been dying for like 20 years to find out.

[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.940]
What's the thing that you made an offer?

[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:07.640]
He couldn't refuse.

[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:08.780]
I guess so.

[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.540]
Hey, um, you know, I've been listening to the theater.

[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.240]
Yeah.

[01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:17.900]
I've, um, I really appreciate the articles that you read.

[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.140]
I used to be vehemently opposed to the bedtime stories.

[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:27.640]
However, with everything that's been happening in the articles that you've been putting, that you've been reading and post-

[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.840]
occasionally listen to Rush Limbaugh to the point of where I'm about to lose my lunch.

[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:44.240]
And the amount of hate that that man spews out of his mouth and just the complete rise that he tells,

[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:51.060]
and few people out there, your audience, really needs to wake up and they need to read really what the hell is going on.

[01:03:51.120 --> 01:04:01.800]
They had a piece on ABC News last night about the mental institutions and how they were, the women in there were raped and they showed you videos of these people.

[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:03.440]
No food, no water.

[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.220]
I mean, it was just horrible.

[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.720]
And, and, and, and Rumsfeld, Rummy sits there and he writes this all off as well, you know, the, the looting, it just kind of happened.

[01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:15.960]
And it's probably untightiness of war, you know, untightiness.

[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:27.560]
You know, when you, when you invade an unarmed country and you basically take away electricity and water, people's just livelihood in general,

[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.980]
what the hell did you expect? I mean, if they did it in LA over Rodney King, I mean, they'll do it anywhere.

[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:45.640]
So, you know, it's just the stories that you've been reading. I mean, I, I tried to read as much as possible and it's just, it, it really is just sickening in that huge contract that was awarded.

[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:48.940]
I read that this morning. I could barely even keep my breakfast down.

[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:52.760]
You know, I love you. Have a great weekend. So, Leafs go.

[01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.180]
Okay, thanks. Bye.

[01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:57.700]
Leafs will not lose tonight. By the way, George, I'll bet your life in Carlos's too.

[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.660]
Okay, betcha buck.

[01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.580]
They're not playing.

[01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:01.080]
Oh, playing tomorrow, three.

[01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:02.660]
Game five and Philadelphia.

[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.800]
Eddie DeBiegel, by the way, I don't want to go into it.

[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.620]
Make all the good saves.

[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:11.480]
Okay, Eddie, don't let a few greasers in. This is the playoff. Somebody tell him, whisper in his ear.

[01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.660]
Good news is, Almo is okay. McGurley, he'll be back.

[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.180]
Here's the fact. There's a good story for once.

[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.500]
I was listening to the world at one on BBC Radio 4 this morning.

[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:24.980]
They led with a story about how saved the children has been trying for six days to fly a plane of food

[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:29.940]
and that could feed 40,000 people, but the US wouldn't let the plane in supposedly for safety reasons.

[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.380]
Within 15 minutes, they had a US military mouthpiece on the earth,

[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.120]
assuring the British public that the plane would be laid in within a day or two.

[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:41.700]
The best part was when the host Nick Clark told the US spokesman that the save the children organizer was standing at the airport

[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.100]
as they spoke and hadn't heard any gunshots for days.

[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:45.660]
Talk about power of the press.

[01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.980]
You know, we're not all that concerned if they get fed.

[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.740]
Okay, and if not that many fewer people don't have to worry about, right?

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:58.260]
It gets to be untidy when you got that many miles of things.

[01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:58.940]
Oh, untidy.

[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.820]
Part of that whole untidyness is the whole thing.

[01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:03.700]
Let me say it again. It wasn't a, this has not been a war.

[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:10.300]
This was an illegal invasion. A war is when there are two combatants who are fighting over something.

[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:13.720]
Just like that story about Penaq and about how they had selected Iraq ahead of time

[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.880]
because they knew it would be an easy, easy knockover, like a walkover.

[01:06:17.300 --> 01:06:20.660]
Right. They already eliminated like two-thirds of his army 11 years ago,

[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.240]
like what they'll do, they think he was going to have back.

[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:27.720]
And then of course, when they're making deals behind the scenes to make sure we can roll into Baghdad virtually unchallenged,

[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.780]
it really wasn't going to be much of a contest.

[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:36.040]
And so if we dropped the photo as J. Dan's and at one house, and it turned out to be a couple of doors down the street,

[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.360]
it wasn't a right one or a whole bunch of dead people in a rubble,

[01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.640]
and it wasn't who we were looking for.

[01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:41.940]
Well, untidy, you know, right.

[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:46.980]
How anybody can defend this just beats the crap out of me.

[01:06:47.100 --> 01:06:49.700]
Just amazing to me. Like that asshole that calls you the other day,

[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.300]
can there anything good you can say about this war? No.

[01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:57.800]
No, there is absolutely, positively nothing good that I can say about it. Nothing's zero.

[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.440]
And there isn't any reason why any of the people who were injured,

[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.900]
main butchered in this invasion,

[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.340]
shouldn't still be alive in a one piece today. There isn't any good reason.

[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.560]
We accomplished nothing.

[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:14.200]
Yeah, but Sodom's gone. Yeah, and what do we got? We got a mess.

[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.380]
Just like the mess we have in Afghanistan now, and it's festering again and worse than was before,

[01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:20.820]
what are we going to have now?

[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:25.660]
And while we're showing these comical pictures because they've got them from Abu Dhabi TV,

[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:29.180]
and so they got them so the Pormano over and over again of Sodom and Kusay

[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:31.680]
of their body triples,

[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:36.520]
how about the pictures of all those the biggest protests since WW2,

[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:45.440]
thousands and thousands of Zidians of people in Baghdad protesting yesterday against what they call illegal occupation by foreign power.

[01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:48.160]
There was a protest there. Huh? There was a protest?

[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:52.680]
Haven't you seen the pictures? No, neither were I. And you won't.

[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:56.380]
Because we have a selective media that just shills and sucks along.

[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.540]
It's not just Lou Dobbs and Moultblitz Grieg and all these other assholes.

[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.480]
It's the network. It's at the very top of the network because they're scared crapless.

[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:05.160]
They're under the thumb.

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:12.620]
If only, just if only the people could see the CBC. That isn't all that revolutionary.

[01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:16.260]
It's a little on the stayed side, a little on the boring side. But you can just see that.

[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.040]
There are ally.

[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:22.580]
No, not this time. That's why W.A. coming here until he's put it off for a little while.

[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.800]
Although he does want to come up and get a little smoked meat month.

[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:27.580]
I mean, that's smoked meat in the meat.

[01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.020]
26th pet better have a check first of you.

[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.560]
I have a check first of the way things are going on.

[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.720]
26th past 10 at 5.60 QAM.

[01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:40.820]
Line in local. Here's 4th video. 5.60. See you at 6.00 a.m.

[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.320]
Friday you bastard.

[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:51.560]
Tonight, P.N.E. goes undercover to reveal a frightening aspect of who could be the next president of the United States.

[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.140]
George Bush is the antichrist.

[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:59.120]
Of course, I care about all the issues facing America.

[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.380]
And your mother is hung like a Oceogal.

[01:09:01.860 --> 01:09:04.340]
Like all candidates, I support term limitations.

[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:08.640]
For check, Cecil. The new millennium is home, mind.

[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:13.040]
Unlike the previous administration, I'd bring dignity back to the Oval Office.

[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:17.380]
Yeah, after I rip off your skin and smack on your balls.

[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:21.260]
Join Sam Neal, your host for tonight's A.N.E.

[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.180]
George Bush, the antichrist.

[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:24.840]
1031 at 5.60.

[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.720]
I'm going to QAM. Don't forget. Join George today.

[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:28.120]
What is it? 2-4.

[01:09:28.980 --> 01:09:31.160]
2-4. 4. Lauderdale, Harley on Federal Highway.

[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.120]
Just south of Oakland Park.

[01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:35.340]
Boulevard stopped by to win some of our free aircraft that Miguel is trying to get rid of.

[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.780]
And enjoy free food from Atlantic City subs where the bread and iron make the difference.

[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:39.840]
And then tomorrow noon to 2.

[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.760]
George will be at Bill Siles Boulevard of Savings on Northwest 36th.

[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.680]
And they still have no idea who he is over there.

[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:49.220]
No. Just west of 27th Avenue, mind me, I'll have some prizes.

[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.060]
Atlantic City subs will be there with more free food so get there early noon to 2 tomorrow.

[01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.600]
They call me a Sanctuary guy when I show up.

[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.260]
Oh, the sandwich guy. He's a sandwich delivery guy once a month, right?

[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:04.300]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:10:05.700 --> 01:10:06.140]
WDQAM.

[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:07.680]
Neil.

[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:08.540]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:09.500]
How you doing?

[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:10.280]
OK.

[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:12.760]
I've been listening for weeks to you.

[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:18.520]
And I got to tell you I've never heard more anti-American Canadian comedy craft.

[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:21.240]
Yeah, that's anybody in the history of radio.

[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:21.740]
Yeah.

[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:27.400]
And, you know, you know, where Canadians would be without the USA protecting them.

[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:28.800]
Who's talking about Canadians?

[01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:30.540]
We're going to have a reason to come on.

[01:10:30.700 --> 01:10:33.360]
They would have taken the bite out of Canada for weather for USA.

[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.160]
Yeah.

[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:37.440]
And this bush guy may be crazier than the Christmas turkey.

[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:45.840]
And he's setting himself for the biggest disaster, but at least he had the balls to go out there and do what he wanted to do.

[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:47.520]
And who, if we call for a way?

[01:10:47.540 --> 01:10:52.040]
Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, again, this time, so did Napoleon go out there and have the balls to do what he wanted to do.

[01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:52.680]
Does that make it right?

[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.160]
It will be...

[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.760]
So did Hitler go out there and do what he wanted?

[01:10:55.800 --> 01:10:56.400]
Sure, you're an idiot.

[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.540]
OK, he had the balls to go out there and do what he wanted to do.

[01:10:58.680 --> 01:10:59.860]
I don't talk to idiots like you.

[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.720]
I'm talking Canadian craft because my ass is sitting in Toronto.

[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.980]
I'm talking Canadian craft.

[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:05.540]
You're an imbecile.

[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.360]
That's just like that's what we're dealing with.

[01:11:08.660 --> 01:11:10.160]
You know, he may be the biggest disaster.

[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.900]
You should have stopped at that point because I think he's already got a good start.

[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.940]
What an imbecile.

[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.520]
And, you know, I'm sitting here, I'm willing to listen, but who's going to listen to that?

[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:23.040]
He's got the balls to do what he wanted to do.

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:23.920]
That's hyperbure.

[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:26.500]
That's what Sodom did when he went into Kuwait.

[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:27.120]

[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.920]
He had the balls to do what he wanted to do.

[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:30.420]
Stolen.

[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.560]
That's what every maniacal lunatic in a history of mankind has done.

[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.020]
Had the balls to do what he wanted to do.

[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:35.620]
Didn't make it right.

[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.000]
Didn't mean we should support it.

[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.920]
All of this guy's been listening for weeks.

[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.000]
Well, how do you know you, sir?

[01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:44.840]
I'm sure you'll continue to listen with your ear glued to the radio and your hand firmly on your joystick.

[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:45.960]
What the hell you can?

[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:46.980]
Schmuck.

[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:49.540]
WDQ-YM.

[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.060]
WDQ-YM, hello.

[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.260]
Yeah, how you doing?

[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:53.960]
OK, sir.

[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.700]
You know, it's this guy who just called a little bit ago.

[01:11:56.820 --> 01:12:00.300]
He's the reason, in my opinion, you need to read these bedtime stories.

[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:00.760]
Yeah.

[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:03.540]
Because the guy like this is a guy like this is a guy.

[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:06.760]
Yeah, but he's not going to go read anything.

[01:12:07.180 --> 01:12:08.900]
So the only way you're ever going to get through that.

[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:12.620]
I could read, I could read, I could sit here and reread these same things.

[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.900]
50,000 times it'll never penetrate his skull.

[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:16.200]
He's an imbecile, don't you get it?

[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.460]
If I had a feel that my doing this here was to try to get to the people I came, I wouldn't waste my time.

[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:27.700]
But the people who are marginal, the people who are not sure are the ones that you can get through.

[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.020]
That's those are the ones you can get through.

[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.440]
That's why I'm doing it.

[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:33.160]
I'm trying to make a little tiny bit of difference.

[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:36.360]
That old thing about throwing the stone into water, making a little ripple.

[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.520]
I'm trying to make a little bit of difference and make at least one or two voices in the country

[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.800]
that aren't just go stepping along.

[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:42.740]
Somebody's got to do it.

[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.740]
You have the voice to make a lot of difference.

[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:45.120]

[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.820]
You know what they started from?

[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.920]
They started from the land of the walking dead.

[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:51.560]
Well, I listen to Russia occasionally.

[01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:53.620]
You know what amazes me?

[01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:57.460]
Everybody who calls this show, or at least today so far, I listen to Russia.

[01:12:57.660 --> 01:12:59.520]
And my question would be, why?

[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.520]
What is it that you hear that you don't know exactly what you're going to get?

[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:04.020]
Why would you waste your time doing that?

[01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.940]
Because I want to hear what he's saying.

[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:06.440]
Why?

[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.080]
I want to hear the garbage, the crap.

[01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.700]
Why? Why do you want to hear garbage?

[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:13.040]
It's like saying that I'm going to go into the dumpster and see if I can find me a good dinner.

[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240]
You know what's in there?

[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.440]
I totally disagree.

[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]
You've got to know what your enemy is doing.

[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.440]
Let me say this to you.

[01:13:20.540 --> 01:13:24.020]
In all honesty, when you know it's going to be the same swell over and over again,

[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.180]
we already know what he's doing.

[01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:27.020]
You know what that's... I mean, do what you want.

[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:27.760]
It's a free country.

[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:34.420]
But I can't imagine why any person who's got anything less than a lot too much time on his hands would waste their time listening to that garbage.

[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.740]
Can I make my point about him?

[01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:36.740]
Go ahead.

[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:42.980]
What he does, which is so dishonest and so dangerous, is he'll come out and he'll say,

[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:49.000]
I was reading an article, and you know how he always bangs the desk, you know, I was reading the article.

[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:52.100]
What was the name of that article, or who was the one who wrote it?

[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:58.020]
And then he'll say, well, I'll look up in a little bit, and then he'll spout some absolute garbage.

[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:58.880]
Lies, yes.

[01:13:58.940 --> 01:14:00.260]
Lies, total lies.

[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:00.580]
Right.

[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.100]
Yeah, what he's doing is he's not saying where he came from.

[01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.040]
He's not saying where he read it.

[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.540]
He's making the stuff up.

[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:13.600]
And unfortunately, his people then turn around and spout the garbage that he puts out.

[01:14:13.940 --> 01:14:15.560]
Yeah, but like I said, we are...

[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:20.000]
I read zillions of different websites every day here on a computer, okay?

[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:24.560]
On the internet, I don't waste my time going to newsmax.com or frubertpublic.com

[01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:28.240]
because I know the kind of right-wing insanity I'm going to find there.

[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.520]
I wouldn't waste my time reading that.

[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:31.840]
What would be the point when there are only so many hours in the day,

[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:33.620]
and I want to get some information and learn something.

[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:34.820]
You're not going to learn anything from him.

[01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:40.200]
I understand, but the bottom line is you've got to know what this guy's saying,

[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:45.540]
because the stuff he's saying is the stuff that when you address somebody who's won his phone,

[01:14:45.540 --> 01:14:46.860]
his followers, they bring up.

[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.660]
So if you don't know what they're saying and you don't know where they're coming from,

[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.300]
you don't know how to counter it.

[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.660]
I mean, some of this stuff is just absolutely ridiculous.

[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:58.020]
Always has been and always will be doing it.

[01:14:58.060 --> 01:14:58.680]
Have a great day.

[01:14:58.820 --> 01:15:01.680]
Okay, there's a guy who's got too much time on his hands. Talk show groupie.

[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.900]
Well, some people like to chew on kinkersaures too.

[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.320]
Oh, no, seriously, I don't understand it. I don't get it.

[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.980]
And I guess most of our people, the talk show groupie crowd,

[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:12.200]
oh, well, we do listen to Russian, and see what he's saying.

[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:16.080]
Why? It's got to be the same right wing garbage, the same lies,

[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.840]
about the Clinton's killing people, and about the...

[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.880]
I told you that thing about the weapons of mass destruction they allegedly found.

[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.080]
That was weeks ago, remember that?

[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.100]
Right. The article he was quoting that non-existent article from the Southern

[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.300]
Existing Australia newspaper.

[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.540]
Oh, I guess what? Did we find it?

[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.780]
No, no, didn't find squat.

[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.640]
And he just makes it up. And again, because he's got his centaurian voice,

[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.340]
and he's got all these ditto heads, and he's on 80 billion clear channel stations

[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:40.140]
all over the country.

[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:42.300]
The idiots out there, they believe it.

[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:44.540]
I don't need to hear it to know what he's doing.

[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:48.480]
If I had time to listen to that crap, I would jump right out the window and kill myself.

[01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.840]
I would know I had too much time on my hands. I had no life.

[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:56.460]
And with all the amazing stuff that's on there, just look at the links on our website.

[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.080]
And we also need to put a couple more links on there.

[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:00.640]
Beener Boy.

[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:01.300]
Okay.

[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:04.700]
Buzzflash.com. I know Lens got a link to that. That's excellent.

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.000]
Buzzflash.com.

[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.420]
And what's the other one I'm thinking about?

[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.100]
It'll come to me.

[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.900]
But there's so much great stuff on there every single day.

[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:15.840]
Smirking tip.

[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:19.360]
Yeah, that's the one. Smirkingchimp.com. Let's get a link to that.

[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.640]
There must be 50 different websites at least.

[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.720]
I mean, I don't have time to waste it in here.

[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:30.940]
Look at on right wing Wackel websites that twist them and implement and distort the truth.

[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:32.500]
Why would I waste my time doing that?

[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:34.600]
I know what they're spewing. I've seen and heard enough of it.

[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:38.020]
If I want to get something into my mind, if I want to learn something,

[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:40.520]
then I have some information to pass along, just for my own benefit.

[01:16:40.820 --> 01:16:43.460]
I'm not going to listen to Hermann Gehring Jr. Spout it.

[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.860]
But nevertheless, it's a free country, at least to this point.

[01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:50.800]
You will not be allowed to be listening to this show after the next six months.

[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.180]
I'm sure.

[01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.640]
56670560.com.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. WQAM.

[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.820]
Hey, I got to speak to Neil.

[01:16:59.220 --> 01:16:59.540]
Speaking.

[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.320]
God bless Texas. You got left this level.

[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:05.860]
Oh, go away. You idiot. Same jackass. That's his third time.

[01:17:05.860 --> 01:17:11.020]
God bless Texas. You left this. That's his line. That's his whole repertoire.

[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:12.620]
Why doesn't he live there?

[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:15.700]
Yeah, that's right. They probably kicked his ass out.

[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:18.660]
WQAM.

[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:19.580]
Neil.

[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:22.520]
You think your leaves are going to be filly and filly?

[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:25.500]
Do I think my leaves are going to be filly and filly?

[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:28.540]
I don't know, but we'll find out probably by about six o'clock on Saturday afternoon.

[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.360]
Do you think your leaves are going to be filly and filly?

[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.400]
There already one one game there. It seems to me.

[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:38.060]
There already one one of the first two games in filly, but you never know.

[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.020]
Call one of the sports shows with a brilliant comment like that.

[01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.800]
Okay, so a brilliant question. Call up the Humper. He knows is a hockey.

[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.060]
Call up by the mad dog. He knows his hockey stuff.

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.820]
He's still thinking of Redwings are going to win it.

[01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.720]
56670560.com.560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.100]
You know what I would like to outlaw?

[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.440]
Set. Sports talk. Call it.

[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:00.680]
I'm not a fan of my life.

[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.240]
I'm a low-cost six-his-for-dreo-five-six-team.

[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.080]
You weigh in two-way-and-

[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:08.820]
You might mention my name's Rites Master Gary.

[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.120]
I am so sorry.

[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:18.220]
From our bomb-down studios in beautifully-smart-filled bagad, it's the I-Racky View.

[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:26.400]
Our current champion who's same-femmly, Saddam, Use, Q-Sey, No-Sey, and on the leg.

[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.540]
Today's challenges. Come on, Mark out. It's the Blink-Wink family.

[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.180]
And now your host, Tracy Sleabock, and the William Mama.

[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.700]
Thank you to the three of us here on the I-Racky Sewn.

[01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.300]
We put a gun to the head of 100 loyal I-Racky patrons.

[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.600]
And as an old picture, you have most of in your home.

[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:47.880]
Slingling family, your goats have sounded first.

[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.880]
Oh, yeah, your family.

[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:49.900]
Serve it, say me.

[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:52.240]
Well, same family, you can still point now.

[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.560]
All loyal I-Rackies have picture of Saddam.

[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.340]
That is connected to the number one answer.

[01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.320]
Most picture of Saddam.

[01:18:58.860 --> 01:19:00.280]
Who would have ever seen such a thing?

[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.380]
Oh, what the fuck? Who would have ever picture that of a mother fucker of their wall?

[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.980]
You must be quite incidental. Those checks about best would not be tolerated.

[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:07.740]
Yeah, I'm just kidding.

[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.240]
Okay, we point the same gun at the same 100 loyal I-Racky patrons.

[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.340]
And we ask him this question.

[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.620]
Who's chief like Saddam? He's out of the way out of town. We've got to go.

[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.020]
1044-560-WQM.

[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.620]
I'm sorry. I just can't stop thinking about that. Got a call to the cons.

[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:23.880]
Yeah.

[01:19:24.600 --> 01:19:30.120]
That we just absolutely have that would be like my watch and Fox News to get information to see what they're saying.

[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:33.500]
I really know what they're saying. I really know what they're up to.

[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:36.680]
Just like during the break, I turned on for a couple of seconds MSNBC.

[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:38.020]
What are they talking about?

[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.480]
Oh, well, there's just tons of talk today about these pictures.

[01:19:41.660 --> 01:19:44.380]
These new pictures of Saddam who say it in the sun, whether they're real or not.

[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.720]
Same as the last time we had the Chubby clown out there, high-fiving the little kids and running around in the middle of the crowd.

[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.140]
This is a guy who doesn't even let people anywhere near him much less touch him.

[01:19:56.380 --> 01:20:00.780]
He's almost like Howard Hughes. He's got like a fetish about washing his hand.

[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.560]
He doesn't want anybody touching him much less than any other scrap.

[01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:05.920]
And he's out there shaking hands and schmosen.

[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:08.060]
There's no question it was one of his doubles.

[01:20:08.100 --> 01:20:11.180]
He looked about as much like him as Greg Reed looked like him.

[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.760]
In fact, if Greg put on a mustache,

[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:15.340]
we did have a better haircut than Greg.

[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:18.480]
And that's what they're talking about at MSNBC.

[01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:21.820]
So what's the point when you already know what you're going to get?

[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:25.700]
So I thought a serial lets you hate.

[01:20:25.900 --> 01:20:28.660]
Well, I bought another box of it to just to see what it tasted like,

[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:30.080]
just to make sure my memory was correct.

[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:31.920]
It tasted like crap.

[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.340]
I don't get it. I don't get it.

[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.320]
I'll never get it.

[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.500]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:20:41.340 --> 01:20:42.620]
Neil, why could you cut me off?

[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:42.860]

[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.440]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:45.520]
Yeah, Neil.

[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:48.140]
I'd like to just ask you a couple of questions.

[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.060]
I have the direct TV and I've been watching a little bit of the CVC on there.

[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:55.240]
But any other better ways that I can get news,

[01:20:55.980 --> 01:20:57.420]
because ever since I've been listening to you,

[01:20:57.500 --> 01:20:59.540]
I've always been hoping about different areas.

[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.480]
And I don't want to get sucked into the MSNBCs and the CVS that are out there.

[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.260]
Do you have anything to use as a suggest?

[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.040]
Internet.

[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:07.540]
Internet only.

[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:08.960]
Okay, I appreciate it.

[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:11.920]
You won't get it on TV on American TV. I guarantee you that.

[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:12.720]
Okay.

[01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.900]
I'm going to check with the satellite. I'm pretty much stuck in.

[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.920]
So I just stick to the Internet site's having going to.

[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:18.800]
Trust me.

[01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:19.700]
Thank you, buddy.

[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.220]
Okay.

[01:21:20.260 --> 01:21:20.600]
Hang in there.

[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.300]
5670560, 0.560.

[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.640]
You know, you see, the guy with the Leafs game at the M-line 9,

[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:28.740]
that was the, what have I done?

[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.560]
What did I do to, whatever that was?

[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.340]
Yeah, what did I do?

[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:31.920]
That was that guy.

[01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:35.600]
So that's why immediately, soon they even heard the voice of the finger was on it and the button too.

[01:21:36.420 --> 01:21:38.620]
Get yourself a life, okay, sir. Get a life.

[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:39.100]
Get lost.

[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:41.560]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.220]
Yes, Mr. Rogers. I was just like to weigh in with all these, uh,

[01:21:46.580 --> 01:21:48.520]
these burning bushes, if you will.

[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:54.280]
When I see the wise blotting out of my TV set of other wonderful things in Iraq,

[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:58.820]
destroying power, destroying water, it reminds me of when I draw a PP,

[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.200]
does not make it to her little pad.

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:02.800]
And...

[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:09.140]
5670560, 0.560 on the AT&T, and Verizon Marvellous Line.

[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.660]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:14.760]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.040]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:18.740]
Neil.

[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:19.500]
Yes, sir.

[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:22.440]
Uh, you know you were talking about Vietnam earlier.

[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:26.560]
Did you see that quote by this guy, Grarner, who is going to be the head guy, the...

[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:27.640]
The fight warrior.

[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.540]
Yeah, they hit him like poison by the way, yes.

[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:33.340]
But did you see that quote where he said that if W would have been president,

[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.900]
we wouldn't have lost the Vietnam War?

[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.220]
No, he did not see that.

[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:39.500]
That was in the Harold, uh, day before yesterday, I believe, or yesterday.

[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:43.660]
Now that's a frightening quote, it means that these people have learned nothing.

[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.280]
And that, W, uh, if he'd have been in there, he'd have won that war for him.

[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:53.960]
Well, what do you expect coming from one of his disciples, okay, from one of his hand-picked right-wing disciples?

[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.300]
What do you think he was going to say?

[01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.180]
Well, that's the first time I had heard that.

[01:22:58.400 --> 01:22:58.580]
Yeah.

[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.700]
And I understand why they hate him like poison, and they just trust him totally,

[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:04.560]
because he's good friends with Ariel Sharon, and the right-wing in Israel,

[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:05.500]
so are they really...

[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.100]
They're joined at the hip, and I just wanted to how long it's going to take for people to, um,

[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.260]
to wake up to that fact that this is the, uh, this is the guys are Ariel Sharon's butt body.

[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:16.940]
Yeah.

[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.520]
But let's go.

[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:21.680]
Maybe that's why they're having those massive protests in the street of Baghdad

[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:22.500]
that we're not seeing them.

[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:25.340]
I'm too busy trying to figure out if these pictures are really sawderminous on.

[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.060]
Have a great day, sir.

[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:28.040]
Happy, uh, circus.

[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:31.900]
Big Arnie affects how do these people listen to Russia?

[01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.220]
I've listened to them all how he David had before.

[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.340]
I've listened to Russia's what he said.

[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.140]
Although they are Canadian.

[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:41.020]
He also says, what a jerk the guy who said Bush had balls to do what he wants.

[01:23:41.140 --> 01:23:41.740]
That's what Hitler did.

[01:23:41.820 --> 01:23:42.240]
That's correct.

[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.460]
That's what I said, I think, Arnie.

[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.100]
Then here's the facts from, uh, where's this Palm Beach?

[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.340]
Oh, Palm Beach provisions.

[01:23:48.460 --> 01:23:49.460]
You know who that is, don't you?

[01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:53.060]
That's the same asshole that was on here this morning, so around a promo anyway.

[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:57.780]
That's, uh, the, uh, Mark the Jets fan, and his good boy friend, Richie from Borshead.

[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.400]
Palm Beach provisions.

[01:24:00.840 --> 01:24:06.160]
If we had cowards like you in George back in WW1, we'd all be speaking German, you comey bastard.

[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:08.820]
Very cute, Mark the Jets fan, and the Richie from Borshead.

[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:09.700]
Oh, my dear.

[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.140]
I heard that they were, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, you're loping this weekend.

[01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:13.780]
Oh, limping.

[01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:19.360]
Let's see, originally Al Pacino was set to star as Ron Covick with Brian to palm attach to direct.

[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:22.280]
However, the project felt true due to financial problems.

[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:26.380]
Ten years later, the film was made with Tom Cruise's Ron Covick and Oliver Stone directing.

[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.900]
That's another thing that amazed me that I really enjoyed that movie tremendously, is that Oliver Stone directed it likewise.

[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.000]
Which goes to show that nothing's, nothing's perfect.

[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:40.140]
I mean, he is so, wrote tests, so ordinarily, but he did a good job, given credit.

[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.100]
He did two good movies that I know of.

[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:43.480]
And the other one was?

[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:44.280]
Platoon.

[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.040]
Oh, I didn't see it.

[01:24:46.220 --> 01:24:46.820]
Oh, very good.

[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:47.540]
Great.

[01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:52.220]
Oh, the review of Platoon was pretty lukewarm compared to the one I read in my review book about born on the 4th of July.

[01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.580]
So, I'll stick with this one.

[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:54.080]
I eat.

[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:00.160]
Vietnam has only got 35 votes, 10% of the total on it, which is so, it's just, it's pathetic.

[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.980]
It's, it's unspeakable.

[01:25:02.380 --> 01:25:04.120]
American people know nothing about history.

[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.200]
They've got no concept of the value of human life.

[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:09.540]
And like I've told you a million times, no point in my getting excited about it.

[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.820]
You know, easy, come easy, go.

[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:15.580]
They see this crap there, and it's like numbers on a page.

[01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:16.900]
That's all, just more statistics.

[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:20.260]
Like stepping on a cockroach, sportscores.

[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:21.620]
There you go.

[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:22.800]
Now you're going to have a duty stuff.

[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:24.320]
And what do you think about that game on Saturday?

[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:26.080]
I think the lethal win.

[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:29.600]
313, as a matter of fact, I think I had the right idea before.

[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.320]
You know what, I mean, what the hell's the point?

[01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:33.560]
Spent it my least at my leafs.

[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:35.300]
That's too much highlight.

[01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:38.080]
There you go. Let's get Frank Mahabalitz to take care of all of this.

[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:45.100]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the A and T and, what ever lie?

[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:46.820]
Moxapista delivery.

[01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:49.540]
Don't put him on the air.

[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.360]
Anybody home here for delivery?

[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.200]
Don't put Jeff Cohen on the air.

[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.240]
Okay, he's off.

[01:25:55.460 --> 01:25:57.480]
No, seriously, he's been horn us enough already.

[01:25:57.620 --> 01:25:59.840]
Okay, I know he's got the real problems in that other joint,

[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.340]
but that's his problem.

[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.680]
I told him to open the other location.

[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:03.480]
And listen to me.

[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.560]
He's got problems in his joint.

[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.740]
I think it's about to fall off is what I'm hearing.

[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.540]
Disease from youths.

[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.940]
Jeff Cohen is there from the pizza love with Moxapista and Moxapolizania

[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:14.420]
for a little bean of boy and George.

[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.620]
Did he bring Moxapolizania also?

[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:16.220]
Just the pizza.

[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:16.980]
He brought him both.

[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:18.500]
Great, nice go on there, Jeff.

[01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:19.540]
Do not put him on the air.

[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:23.920]
Okay, until he starts giving him a 100% off, he's pretty upset

[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.640]
that he's only getting 50% discount into computer there.

[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:30.520]
I'm actually paying Jeff to keep the rumor status of the way it is.

[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:31.200]
Good.

[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:33.760]
The way things are in that plantation location,

[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.400]
you better start charging double.

[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:36.960]
And he says the other joint is doing great.

[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:37.760]
No, it's not.

[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:39.920]
Every time I drove by there when I was home, there's nobody there.

[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.400]
That's in the middle of the afternoon.

[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040]
Get some people in there.

[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.000]
Okay, it's great food.

[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:44.660]
It's a good place,

[01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:45.860]
but you can't see it from the street.

[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.560]
And Jeff really is afraid to go under there.

[01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:50.840]
What was the worst champion American history we asked?

[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:54.820]
Look at this, the opening of the second-powered pizza love is all moving up the list.

[01:26:56.980 --> 01:27:00.680]
Slavery 78, 2000 presidential election 68,

[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:02.600]
the Civil War 50.

[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.620]
Oh, speaking of rumors.

[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.820]
Yesterday, because the leaf game went to 1230 in the morning the other night,

[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.740]
three over times, so I got very little sleep.

[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.360]
So, you know how you try to compensate?

[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.280]
So, I take passions yesterday and line there, taking a nap,

[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:17.920]
I'm as sound asleep as a little baby, okay?

[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:21.400]
Line up my sofa, just cut in the ziz, you know, cut in the ziz,

[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:21.800]

[01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:25.080]
And the phone rings and guess who it is?

[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.800]
Ha, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:28.580]
Will you leave me the hell alone already?

[01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:29.720]
Rumors say, yeah, yeah, I am.

[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.760]
And then five minutes later, the phone finally air.

[01:27:34.660 --> 01:27:37.560]
Leave me alone, you're the vein of my existence already.

[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:41.440]
Okay, you're a good guy, rumor, but in small doses, just leave me alone.

[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.340]
Ha, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma.

[01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:44.340]
Just go away.

[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.240]
I'll see you when you get up here.

[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.000]
By the way, we got something special waiting for you.

[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.340]
It's an isolation at the hospital.

[01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:54.680]
What was the worst chapter in American history?

[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:58.080]
Slavery 82, rumors phone calls to neo in 110.

[01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:03.100]
2000 presidential elections 70, Civil War 50, Vietnam 36.

[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.040]
Slot of the American Indians 32.

[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.940]
The assassinations of the 60s, 29.

[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.120]
The depression 17, the attack on Iraq 16,

[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:20.640]
Monica gate 12, Watergate 4, World War II 2, World War 1 1, World War III 3,

[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:21.660]
World War 4 4.

[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.580]
In terms of Japanese Americans during WW2 1,

[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:28.680]
and the Gulf War 1 has no votes.

[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:30.040]
I'll tell you that.

[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:34.160]
I mean, we got a ton of votes on there, but you look at that and tell us.

[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.860]
Tell us maybe we need some serious help.

[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:36.200]
Yeah.

[01:28:36.940 --> 01:28:37.600]
Serious help.

[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.800]
Sure wish I had some of that at MOTSA pizza,

[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.880]
but I don't have that here, so I had MOTSA balls soup yesterday.

[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:42.200]
I don't know.

[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.640]
It was damn good, too.

[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.940]
How did you eat the balls and the noodles?

[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:45.940]
I ate the balls.

[01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:48.100]
WQIM.

[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:51.420]
QIM, hello.

[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.980]
God damn it, rew...

[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:55.280]
WQIM.

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:56.760]
Neo, what are you doing?

[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:58.000]
What am I doing?

[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.140]
No, how are you doing?

[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.320]
I'm doing fine.

[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.840]
Listen, yesterday you were talking about 10 Robins

[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:06.800]
and how he's not given his personality right and so forth.

[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:09.540]
I think you're being a little hypocritical with that.

[01:29:09.640 --> 01:29:11.320]
When you yourself...

[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:14.120]
Yeah, at two points on this, you yourself give a lot more air time

[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.340]
to people who agree with you and who don't agree with you.

[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.960]
Sure, that is a total fabrication.

[01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.420]
Now, give you all the air time you want if you want to say something.

[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.980]
The people who disagree with me generally just call either

[01:29:22.980 --> 01:29:25.180]
take a personal shot or make some stupid comment about

[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:27.140]
Texas is great in the screw-candidate.

[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:27.580]
Well, what...

[01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.600]
You've heard it this morning, so you're full of crap.

[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:30.820]
All right, I'll give you that.

[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.400]
If the people on the other side could call and make rational arguments,

[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:37.500]
whether it's about the war in Iraq, whether it's about religion,

[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:40.420]
whatever we talk about on the show, I'm more than delighted to listen to him

[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:43.020]
because it's a lot more interesting, but they can't or they won't do it.

[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.120]
The other thing was you should make it clear to your college

[01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.000]
that the first amendment does not guarantee the right to be heard.

[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:49.200]
It's the right to free speech.

[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:51.080]
You don't have the right to be heard.

[01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:52.840]
What does that mean?

[01:29:53.380 --> 01:29:54.240]
What do you mean to what does that mean?

[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.280]
You don't have the right to call out to me.

[01:29:56.540 --> 01:29:58.740]
That isn't the issue at this.

[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:02.160]
Sir, what are we talking about?

[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:05.800]
Say what we like, who step along and do and say what we like,

[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.700]
otherwise we're going to punish you.

[01:30:07.700 --> 01:30:11.840]
My life and local, this is 4356.

[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:13.700]
You're way too way.

[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:17.880]
Don't you go back to Canada, you stupid bastard?

[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:22.560]
Al Jazeera, none of us fear you.

[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.260]
How can you call this the news?

[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.860]
You speak in a language we don't understand.

[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:29.040]
Flying and hiding the truth.

[01:30:29.100 --> 01:30:30.940]
And evident, bla bla do.

[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:33.300]
Mohammadah, mula bee.

[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:36.120]
Your turman is hanging over your eyes.

[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.220]
You're lovely, pal.

[01:30:37.620 --> 01:30:38.140]
You're lovely.

[01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.840]
And just say it, we don't appear that you know what thing about rules.

[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.540]
And your agenda is really quite clear.

[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.580]
Paging America, creating democracy, creating the US and Jews.

[01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:53.580]
Happy pre-stopping.

[01:30:53.700 --> 01:30:54.940]
Wait, it's 11.156.

[01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:56.860]
If they're sure learned a lot from that last call, I was good.

[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.180]
We have freedom of speech, but not their right to be heard.

[01:30:59.300 --> 01:30:59.400]
Yeah.

[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:03.920]
Uh, between false and the woods, and nobody hears it, does it have a right of speech?

[01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:04.620]
There's a very fart.

[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:06.760]
What is that, man?

[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:08.760]
Pup, pup, pup, pup, pup, pup.

[01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:10.820]
Himmurmous home number, okay, we'll keep them both busy.

[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.900]
Here's the fact that says I'd come to believe the reason people listen to them

[01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:18.160]
believe the mass media dribble is because there's no need for prerequisite knowledge.

[01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:21.680]
One needs no historical perspective, one needs no sense of logic,

[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.760]
one needs no recollection of connected events,

[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.360]
one needs no morality, one needs no sense of compassion,

[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.540]
one needs not have a suitable level of comprehension.

[01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:31.760]
It's the ultimate shortcut to life and a Rush Limbaugh School of Broadcasting

[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.580]
is the conduit for this mental process.

[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:35.640]
And you are absolutely correct.

[01:31:35.860 --> 01:31:36.400]
Right on it.

[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:36.900]
That's right.

[01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:40.440]
And just look at our poll today, even our astute audience,

[01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:43.540]
obviously has a very serious lack of understanding of history.

[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:49.100]
And of course these guys, well, you know, at least he has the balls to do what he wanted to do.

[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.760]
What does that have to do with what I've been talking about?

[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.900]
What does that have to do with all the innocent people?

[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:54.880]
And then women and children that were butchered and vied not?

[01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.800]
And how is that a necessarily good thing in a person?

[01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:59.020]
And what does that have to do with what we just got through doing the last month

[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.360]
and all the innocent people who live in butchered?

[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:00.760]
You know what I say?

[01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:02.360]
Never make any reference to that, never.

[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.900]
Because it would be the rum spread answer.

[01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:06.000]
Well, it's untidy, it's collateral damage.

[01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:08.160]
Schmidt happens, you know, the same old crap, you know.

[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.360]
You've got to break a few eggs.

[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.060]
As though we're just talking an abstract,

[01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:15.480]
not talking about real lives and real pain and real grotesque barbaric stuff,

[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.400]
we're just talking an abstract, you know,

[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:18.640]
we're reviewing it from afar.

[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:23.100]
From the comfort of our living rooms and our little 17-inch TV,

[01:32:23.240 --> 01:32:25.440]
or our big 62-inch HD TV,

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:29.740]
watch in the pre-packaged, orchestrated crap,

[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:32.020]
the three-wing circus that the media puts on for you.

[01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.400]
The comparisons to Wagged the Dogs is this fact has been overused the last few years,

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:40.060]
but this war with the Rackens exactly what the characters and movie Wagged the Dog did.

[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.760]
They filmed exactly what we wanted to see.

[01:32:41.820 --> 01:32:43.680]
Of course, no one died in their war because it was fiction,

[01:32:44.020 --> 01:32:46.100]
and they used the so-called victims over and over again.

[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:49.280]
Then we see pictures of the same man over and over again in different crowds

[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.460]
in different places in our newspapers.

[01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:52.260]
In fact, we're seeing him on TV today.

[01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:55.100]
Then we see only the feel good stuff.

[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.380]
Aren't our guys the good guys all the time no matter what?

[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.420]
How many times are we going to see that soldier getting kissed?

[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:02.600]
This is the perfect Wagged the Dog after all we have proof.

[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:05.440]
Carl Rove said to win the play the war card,

[01:33:06.580 --> 01:33:08.140]
do we need any more proof than that?

[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.220]
When they go out to rent Born on the 4th of July,

[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.540]
get a copy of Wagged the Dog to it.

[01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:13.540]
Okay, there's a good keeping busy over the weekend.

[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.640]
Wagged your dog on the 4th of July.

[01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.040]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60,

[01:33:22.340 --> 01:33:25.840]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.440]
Then I already had this story about the sap guy.

[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:30.380]
I had this on yesterday that we just had this facts.

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:33.220]
No, I don't want the other pages because I had this story on yesterday.

[01:33:33.540 --> 01:33:36.080]
The Arabic secret deal between the West and the Bath Party

[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.820]
and to hand over back them with us, rolled them down.

[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:38.900]
I already had that on there.

[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:40.040]
Way ahead of you. Thank you anyway.

[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:43.920]
WQIM.

[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.080]
Neil.

[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:45.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:50.380]
You know what I really find unbelievable is this,

[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.320]
this uses that they made to go in there like the Republican Guard.

[01:33:54.740 --> 01:33:57.560]
The Republican Guard killed anybody in the last 12 years?

[01:33:59.340 --> 01:33:59.780]
Probably.

[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.440]
They had all the information to go in there.

[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:04.160]
Yeah.

[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:08.600]
The point is they weren't a threat to us.

[01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:10.540]
It's got nothing to do with how many people they killed there.

[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:13.120]
There were plenty of people being putured all over the world.

[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:14.660]
There were no threat to us.

[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.500]
There were no threat to England.

[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.120]
There were no threat to anybody quite frankly.

[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.580]
But don't confuse anybody with the facts because we did a good job.

[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:22.840]
We went over there and we kicked that.

[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:25.720]
We kicked them schmataezas and now what?

[01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:28.420]
Now we're going to Syria and we'll go over to how we feel like going.

[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:29.920]
Because we're number one baby.

[01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:33.060]
We're the biggest and the best and by far the most dangerous.

[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:37.300]
Just like Jeff Cohen says, we're the biggest and the best and the most dangerous.

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.600]
How's that Mons of pizza by the way?

[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:40.360]
It's spectacular.

[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:42.560]
The Mons of pizza from the Mons of Klee's stuff.

[01:34:42.660 --> 01:34:43.100]
Best ever.

[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:44.780]
I don't know if you remember the first time that he made it.

[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.460]
It was a little imperfect.

[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.380]
Was it really?

[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.180]
It was good but it's so much better now that made it a player.

[01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:51.400]

[01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:52.260]
That's what it is.

[01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:53.440]
Rumors said about it too.

[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.180]
He said the food was great but it was a little imperfect because they actually charged me a few bucks.

[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:56.900]
Oh god.

[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.120]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:58.980]
Nothing's perfect man.

[01:34:59.080 --> 01:34:59.640]
Just pay it up.

[01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:00.080]
Pay it up.

[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:01.600]
Okay. You cheap Canadian Jew bastard.

[01:35:02.020 --> 01:35:02.360]
God.

[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:03.940]
Charge him double Jeff.

[01:35:05.920 --> 01:35:06.280]
WDQAM.

[01:35:07.060 --> 01:35:07.780]
Hey Neil.

[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:08.620]
Yes sir.

[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.600]
Happy paystock by the way.

[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:12.380]
And back to you.

[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:13.320]
Happy your good Friday.

[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:14.120]
Thanks.

[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:21.980]
Just so you know I agree with your friend that called earlier that said yeah we all have the right to free speech but we don't have the right to be heard.

[01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:29.640]
I mean I have the right to say whatever the hell I want but you don't have the right to put me on the phone or something you don't want to.

[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.540]
You have that right to not broadcast my opinion and I don't have that.

[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:36.460]
That has to do with the talk show has got nothing to do with the constitution.

[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.800]
I mean well what does that mean?

[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:39.520]
You don't have a right to be heard.

[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:42.020]
Well what does that mean?

[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:46.540]
I was just telling you you asked what does that mean?

[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:51.020]
What did he mean by you have to speak but not the right to be heard?

[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:54.020]
That's what it's that's what he wasn't talking about talk shows.

[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:55.660]
He was talking about Tim Robbins.

[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:56.760]
He wasn't doing a talk show.

[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.240]
He was just going to make an appearance.

[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.400]
If they didn't want to put Tim Robbins on they had every right to not put him.

[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:05.840]
But the problem being that they did it for the wrong reasons.

[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:10.300]
Don't you understand they're excluding him they're taking baseball which is supposed to be a national treasure.

[01:36:10.480 --> 01:36:15.120]
He's once upon a time it was and they're turning the hall of fame into a political form which it has no place to be in.

[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.400]
Absolutely that is absolutely wrong.

[01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:17.720]
I totally agree with you.

[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.660]
Well so what's the what's the what why even waste time talking about that?

[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:24.560]
I'm just explaining I was just explaining it.

[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.800]
It just seemed like the the opinion I just wanted to to to.

[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.460]
So what you're interpreting for him is that what you're doing?

[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.560]
Just a little bit.

[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:35.360]
Okay thanks for the interpretation.

[01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.020]
No we need interpreters on this show.

[01:36:38.160 --> 01:36:38.440]
Wow.

[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:43.820]
I didn't know that we needed to dignify somebody who says oh you have the freedom of speech but not the right to be heard.

[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:45.760]
I mean what does that really mean?

[01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.000]
What does that mean?

[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:49.160]
And please don't anybody else try to tell me I don't want to know.

[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.180]
Wow.

[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:57.020]
Five and the midst of all the other things I'm talking about to be dwelling and thinking on that.

[01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:59.500]
What does that have to do with what's going on in the world today?

[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:08.040]
This is the problem with talk show callers man like I've always said you take some little minutia some little piece of crap like that and go into a big solid answer.

[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:11.300]
Well in addition to which who the hell is he got to like to defend the other guy.

[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.740]
The other guy made an answer I mean spoke for himself.

[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:21.320]
Give me a lecture on who I leave on and how long get your stopwatch out okay Pally and you can start timing all the calls.

[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.600]
You can start keeping track.

[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:26.940]
Like all those great little calls you're on Russia show every day right.

[01:37:27.180 --> 01:37:31.440]
Like all the little commentators you'll hear on Fox News right.

[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:37.980]
See this is disturbing to these people the fact that we actually have somebody on here I'm not going to waste my time with right wing assholes.

[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:38.720]
How do you like that?

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.920]
You already got 99% of the air waves you want 100% or that's what I thought.

[01:37:43.620 --> 01:37:48.880]
They can't handle the fact that there's somebody else out here that really wants to promote a different point of view because there actually is one.

[01:37:49.820 --> 01:37:51.040]
Oh you can't do that.

[01:37:52.060 --> 01:37:52.960]
WQ I am.

[01:37:53.480 --> 01:37:54.860]
I'm not going to.

[01:37:55.240 --> 01:37:56.120]
WQ I am.

[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:57.380]
Hey how are you Neil?

[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:58.220]
Okay sir.

[01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.940]
Happy Passover and happy Easter sir.

[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.740]
Happy food supply.

[01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:02.740]

[01:38:03.040 --> 01:38:11.820]
Neil I agree with you with the embedded reporters deal I have a big problem with that the Marines the Army guys they can't just go all out and shoot everybody.

[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:14.280]
I guess opposed to because of these damn reporters.

[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:18.700]
They're both white there is out Marine Corps good point.

[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:23.340]
Yeah kill them all that God taught about here's what it says to try to get Michael Morzaskar away from him.

[01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:27.820]
Yes look at the New York Post if you have a strong stomach but they have no problem with Roman Polanski keeping his.

[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:33.020]
No it was just a 14 year old girl that has been offered Jerry Lee Lewis was enough Roman Polanski.

[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:39.000]
How can this administration export democracy you can't export things you don't have very good facts excellent good point.

[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:48.560]
In honor of today's winner the winner of today's pool can you play good chip I'm a I'm a study I can't always cracks me up especially the line your pillow is a rat.

[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:55.440]
Polka Brian's a genius is there any hope of a CD release of his greatest since including the ones no longer allowed on WQ I am.

[01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.280]
Oh no.

[01:38:57.560 --> 01:38:57.980]
Condoleezza.

[01:38:58.480 --> 01:38:58.900]
Condoleezza.

[01:38:58.900 --> 01:38:59.100]
Condoleezza.

[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.660]
Careful no I don't think so.

[01:39:01.100 --> 01:39:01.940]
Not this week.

[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:11.580]
Not that there's any censorship you're going on because you do understand we have right a freedom of speech unless of course we're picking on the wrong people unless we're picking on people from the.

[01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:16.740]
Boond from the fourth right whatever the hell this is that's that's right that's right.

[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:27.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T I guess I must have rattled some nerves out there talking about that movie born on the fourth of July it's your fault sorry.

[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:47.080]
Excellent movie this really needs to be seen I think it's sounding if the truth itself from a clockwork orange prior everybody's eyelids open and forced them to watch remember how many years of July especially right now because it says nothing to do with my recommendation has nothing to do with this right now I've been bugging you for years about it but it has to do is the butchery that we are you know we're pointing the finger

[01:39:47.080 --> 01:40:08.980]
everybody else in the meantime the butchery that this country is participating in and has done in a past is so grotesque and all this talk about loving freedom and loving democracy and exporting democracy like this fact just pointed out what a cracker crap exporting death and suffering that's what we're doing a great job of exporting death and importing of innocent people have nothing to do with 9 11 or anything to do with being a threat to us.

[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:15.960]
But we had to get somebody to make the public feel better about everything and that's that's what it was all about we had to get somebody an easy target that we get it.

[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:18.680]
We got a statue w.

[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:18.840]

[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:18.900]

[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.120]
I am.

[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:23.600]
Yes sir.

[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:29.020]
Hey it is an entity from New Jersey gang by W.

[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:29.240]

[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:31.360]
Yes sir.

[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:36.400]
All you have to do is remember that the the other term that power corrupts.

[01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:38.220]
Okay thank you w.

[01:40:38.380 --> 01:40:38.600]
Q. I.

[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:38.820]
M.

[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:41.880]
W.

[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:42.100]
Q.

[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:42.300]
I.

[01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:42.520]

[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:46.520]
W.

[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:46.740]
Q.

[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:46.960]
I.

[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:47.920]
I.

[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:56.180]
Like I mentioned the clinton years everybody said all he did was say I'm out of the Lewinsky all the military we have now.

[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:56.400]
Hello.

[01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:58.040]
I'm here I'm listening.

[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:07.580]
All we have now is the military that the clinton had this is in push military so there's a lot of we've been through that a million times.

[01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:10.640]
First boring from it has passed 11 at 560 W.

[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:10.840]
Q.

[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:18.240]
I'm they can't respond to what I'm talking about because we got a bunch of mouth reading idiots out there number one because I got too much time on her hands because it's another one that was a great holidays.

[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:25.380]
And number two they got that they can't respond to it because it's to embarrassing to think about their speechless plus what they know about history.

[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:27.320]
You could stick in a thimble and put it all up there.

[01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:27.460]
Correct.

[01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:36.700]

Now Mark the Carle here gonna help you brush up on your swagger.

[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.500]
That's right Mr. President our consultants at the Rending Group have assured us that arrogance and John Wayne swagger will endear it to the rest of the world.

[01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.540]
Well let's roll up my swagger.

[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:55.300]
Oh nothing sir it's just you're gonna have to do a little more than just lean on your elbow.

[01:42:55.500 --> 01:42:56.760]
Oh I should.

[01:42:57.860 --> 01:43:02.640]
Now if you'll just step over here Mr. President, stirat the coal, operate the boom box.

[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:06.060]
Or you need a boom box for it's just wrapped this pair.

[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:07.580]
Oh to set the mode.

[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.720]
Okay let's roll.

[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:11.920]
Here let me help you wipe this with a towel.

[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:15.160]
Here here here here here here here here here here.

[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:16.780]
Oh no!

[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.760]
Here let me help you wipe this with a towel.

[01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:20.220]
I'm all right.

[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.820]
Perhaps the meat was wrong.

[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.700]
Let's try a different song this time Mark.

[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:24.600]
Go ahead.

[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:27.160]
Oh no.

[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:32.840]
Here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here here.

[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:37.240]
Get Jackie Perl and here I haven't had my daily dose of Jew yet.

[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:38.580]
He's not available sir.

[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:40.060]
Perhaps we could get a refliger.

[01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:41.900]
I need a swagger not float.

[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.480]
Okay one more time sir.

[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:45.240]
All right.

[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.540]
You know what I mean?

[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.240]
Should I hold airport after me?

[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:52.840]
Oh yeah.

[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:53.460]
Oh yeah.

[01:43:53.460 --> 01:43:54.040]
Oh yeah.

[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:56.420]
Oh yeah.

[01:43:56.620 --> 01:44:00.220]
1117 at 560 WQM we got 416 votes on the pool.

[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:04.480]
Which of these was the worst tamper in American history slavery?

[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:05.880]
95.

[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:09.680]
2000 presidential election is moving up on a slaves 81.

[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.600]
Which is kind of ironic because of the dark folks that weren't allowed to vote in that election either a whole bunch of men are foreigner.

[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:16.380]
A Civil War 52.

[01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:17.840]
See how this is all time together?

[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:18.900]
Yep.

[01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:20.080]
Vietnam 48.

[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:21.860]
Slot of the American Indians 47.

[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.320]
The assassinations of the 60s.

[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.900]
JFK MLK RFK 36K.

[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.040]
Attack on Iraq 26.

[01:44:29.300 --> 01:44:30.100]
Depression 20.

[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.260]
Monika gate 13.

[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:32.700]
Better known as penis gate.

[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.520]
But don't say penis.

[01:44:34.300 --> 01:44:42.320]
Not this autorgate for WW222WW11 in terms of Japanese Americans during World War II 1.

[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:44.640]
And Gulf War 1 is still got the big O.

[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:46.340]
Which I think we can understand.

[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:47.180]
Here's the facts.

[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:50.100]
Happy holidays in QA and pump up the wattage or something.

[01:44:50.220 --> 01:44:52.140]
It's the best signal I've ever heard all the way up in Palm Beach.

[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:52.640]
Keep it up.

[01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:54.260]
Listening loud and proud.

[01:44:54.260 --> 01:44:55.900]
The audience is clear as well in Palm Beach.

[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:56.500]
How do you like that?

[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.400]
I guess we'll have to tell them that Bob Vermuth is in town when I'm out in Pete on the tower.

[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:03.780]
That's the deal.

[01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:10.140]
Bob Vermuth, our corporate chief engineer, when I'm there, is driving up 441 really pissed off about the crappy signal the other day.

[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.560]
So when I'm out there and Pete on the tower for hours, on the tower of power, with Bobby Brown.

[01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.880]
And had himself a hell of a good time.

[01:45:17.980 --> 01:45:19.400]
And now that signal is just sensational.

[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.320]
Maybe nice going for both.

[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:23.840]
WQAM.

[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.280]
QAM.

[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:29.420]
Not there.

[01:45:30.420 --> 01:45:31.380]
5607-0560.

[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.340]
Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlos line. WQAM.

[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560]
Hello there. How you doing?

[01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:37.360]
Okay, sir.

[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:42.800]
I found a... I saw a bumper stick yesterday. I thought it might be interested in it.

[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:43.200]
Okay.

[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:46.480]
Yeah.

[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.580]
It says it was no more and I'll spell the last part of it.

[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:51.320]
No more.

[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:54.880]
B-U-S-H-I-T.

[01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:56.000]
Right. Yeah, that's old.

[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:58.140]
Yeah. I've never seen it before.

[01:45:59.360 --> 01:46:00.080]
All right.

[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:01.840]
Let's get a lot of them. Spread them around.

[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.060]
Yeah. Have a good time.

[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.880]
Thank you. Because he sure spread plenty of it around himself.

[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.360]
Child casualties fill the rack hospitals.

[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.080]
The appalling injuries suffered by Ali Ismail Abbas are not unique.

[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:13.500]
Is an aid worker who's visiting Mosul's hospitals.

[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.720]
The 12-year-old, as we know, who's on our website.

[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:17.700]
And they've been a whole lot of hearts and flower stories.

[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:18.740]
It's a horrible story.

[01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:22.480]
12-year-old lost both his arms and received extensive burns during US bombing raid.

[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.840]
He's been airlifted to a hospital and can wait for emergency surgery.

[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:27.660]
However, Brendan Patty of the AIDS charity saved the children

[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:32.380]
who's working in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul says he has seen dozens of similarly injured children.

[01:46:32.380 --> 01:46:34.400]
His flight has not attracted the same amount of attention.

[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:38.740]
He said the injury tool was reducing experience medical staff to tears.

[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:44.380]
He told the BBC in the hospitals the doctors have struggled very bravely to keep things running during the bombing.

[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:47.480]
They were having to do amputations on children all the time.

[01:46:48.340 --> 01:46:52.180]
Every day that they're having to confront that kind of thing they were broken up about it when they were speaking to us.

[01:46:52.580 --> 01:46:54.760]
These were medical professionals on the verge of tears.

[01:46:55.020 --> 01:46:56.840]
Unfortunately, Ali is by no means unique.

[01:46:56.840 --> 01:46:59.840]
He said the staff had been funding off looters with their bare hands.

[01:47:00.780 --> 01:47:03.000]
Yeah, see, nobody responds to any of this and you want to know why?

[01:47:03.060 --> 01:47:03.920]
Because it's too embarrassing.

[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:08.860]
They want to put their hands over their ears like that little monkey, you know, a senoevo, here in the weevil, etc.

[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:11.140]
And just pretend this didn't really go on.

[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:14.300]
This didn't happen. It's just propaganda.

[01:47:14.740 --> 01:47:16.340]
It's just Sodom's propaganda. That's all.

[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.720]
You're just getting sucked in by that.

[01:47:18.060 --> 01:47:19.080]
I'll just zero propaganda.

[01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:20.180]
Right.

[01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:27.240]
560-560, panel 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line. WQAM.

[01:47:27.860 --> 01:47:28.520]
Hey, how's it going?

[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:29.260]
Okay.

[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.420]
I wanted to talk to you.

[01:47:30.860 --> 01:47:31.140]
Speaking.

[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:32.900]
Hey, how you going now?

[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.120]
I wanted to find out what are the chances maybe to tell damage control and such.

[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:44.200]
What are the chances of bush actually getting reelected?

[01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.320]
What are the chances?

[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:46.840]
Yeah.

[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:50.140]
Based on the possibility that the Democrats have to run against them.

[01:47:50.180 --> 01:47:52.560]
I'd say they're pretty damn good as chances are going to reelect it.

[01:47:52.580 --> 01:47:53.000]
That's crazy.

[01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.620]
Well, who's going to run against them?

[01:47:56.400 --> 01:47:58.200]
I think we can do a dog right now.

[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:00.480]
Okay, well, maybe that's what you're going to get.

[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.180]
That's what you're going to get, King.

[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:07.060]
Sure beats a lot of the names I'm hearing.

[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:08.800]
Drupedoggy dog.

[01:48:09.120 --> 01:48:10.280]
Right. Drupedoggy dog.

[01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:18.140]
560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.540]
The drooper.

[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:21.540]
Remember that win one for the Gipper?

[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:22.800]
How about win one for the drooper?

[01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:27.200]
Or the droopers are real troopers when I'm hearing WQAM.

[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:28.960]
Oh, that's lovely.

[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:29.760]
I like it a lot.

[01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:31.740]
Let's put that on with a hockey even in the background.

[01:48:32.580 --> 01:48:32.940]
WQAM.

[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:37.660]
Yeah, Neil, you know when you dial a station, it only rings for two minutes and it hangs up.

[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:39.160]
Yeah, I'll call it again.

[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.240]
It'll keep you busy.

[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.140]
Just keep dialing, man.

[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.280]
We like to keep you occupied.

[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.760]
That guy who called up about Toronto, I got news for you.

[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:46.220]
That's a bell for us, man.

[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:46.900]
He's looking good.

[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:49.880]
If he ain't the hottest school, he's the guy's man on him.

[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:51.260]
I mean, you know, it might be an all-can.

[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.200]
What are you talking about?

[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:54.360]
He's letting you through the list of his and history of the game.

[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:54.920]

[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:58.000]
Oh, I want to say, bell for us.

[01:48:58.400 --> 01:48:58.960]
Pretty good, man.

[01:48:59.740 --> 01:49:01.060]
Let me say it again, sir.

[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:03.980]
He led in three of the greasiest goals I've ever seen in my life.

[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:05.540]
That game should end at two-nothing Toronto.

[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:07.040]
You have no clue what you're talking about.

[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:11.300]
He made a Zidian good saves, but he made a three-oh-horrible cheesy goals.

[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:14.900]
They wrote about it in the papers here and they know a little bit more about it, probably, than you do, sir.

[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.180]
Good, Gawin, Miss Malin.

[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:19.300]
There's another one of our good South Florida hockey calls.

[01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:19.960]
All right.

[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:23.920]
When I could, yeah, it was the best.

[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:24.620]
And no one would be...

[01:49:24.620 --> 01:49:32.380]
And the alarming trend, the United States military continues to discharge lesbian, gay, and bisexual linguists despite a critical need for language specialists.

[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:44.920]
As originally reported by an Nathaniel Franklin in November 18, 2002 issue of New Republic, service members legal defense network SLDN provided legal assistance to nine linguists trained in Arabic and Korean during the fall last year.

[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:50.900]
Today, the Washington Post reports that SLDN is now assisted 24 linguists targeted under Don't Ask Don't Tell.

[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:57.040]
Nine of those assisted have been trained in Arabic, eight were Korean language specialists, and three were trained to speak Farsi.

[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:01.220]
SLDN has also provided assistance to two Chinese and two Russian linguists.

[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:17.960]
Our nation faces a serious shortfall in the number of trained professionals who can speak into separate languages, critical to our national security, said SLDN executive director, C. Dixon Osborne, the continued firing of lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans who are trained in those languages, underscores the detriment of Don't Ask Don't Tell in our nation.

[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:28.500]
According to a government accounting office, a GAO study released in January, 2002, the Army faces a critical shortfall in linguists needed to translate intercept and interrogate suspected theorists.

[01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:36.580]
The report concluded that staff shortfalls have adversely affected agency operations and compromised US military law enforcement intelligence, counterterrorism and diplomatic efforts.

[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.380]
But if they're gay, just go away. Oyee.

[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:49.740]
Kathleen Glovery recently discharged Arabic linguist wrote in the moderate, Harold newspaper that the fear that we all feel in these hostile environments is a constant presence.

[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:59.060]
It drives some of us into severe depression that others of us to seek discharge in order to protect ourselves. This is the only way we can ensure our safety since the upper ranks of the military refuse to do so.

[01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:10.480]
Senator Russ Feincold of Wisconsin recently remarked on the Senate floor that not only does the Don't Ask Don't Tell policy waste time money and linguistic skill, it also initiates discrimination against those who simply want to serve their country.

[01:51:10.900 --> 01:51:16.240]
Representative Barney Fag, a Frank of Massachusetts called the Discharges a new height of stupidity and he is...

[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:17.700]
Absolutely correct.

[01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:21.220]
I don't know.

[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:26.520]
Wasn't that one of the reasons that they gave first September 11th we had the information we didn't have it up in turpidors.

[01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:33.940]
We didn't have it up in Arabic, we were getting all that chatter but we couldn't interpret it. We couldn't put our spies in over there because we didn't have the right people to speak the right languages.

[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:41.680]
But God forbid should they be homosexual man. The same kind of right-wing lunacy continues going on and never going to change with this crowd.

[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:49.940]
That's all they know. That's all they know is pandering to the same. Nero-minded, sick, twisted, hypocritical right-wing assholes. That's what you got.

[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:58.380]
That's the crowd that's stored your election folks and in the meantime we got a whole bunch of Americans sitting back on like that which is really un-American to say that, didn't it?

[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.800]
Yeah. Ditto, ditto, ditto. Dumbledumbo, dumbledumbo.

[01:52:03.300 --> 01:52:13.320]
No, that's so un-American, no it's not. It's just the truth. In fact, we got so many stupid uneducated people running around. That's not un-American to talk about it. It's not American to allow it. That's what's un-American.

[01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:15.740]
To sit back and allow it and to think it's a big joke.

[01:52:17.620 --> 01:52:23.140]
And of course when you're dealing with people who think that whoever wins a golf match is what's important in life then you know what you're dealing with. You know what I'm saying?

[01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:24.020]
What do you think?

[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:29.600]

What did I say was yesterday? Whatever it held is fancy, schmancy facts. On this crap that you just sent me about Robert Fisk.

[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:33.860]
I don't know.

[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:38.560]
For more encroached this is the worst piece of soil I have ever read in my life.

[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:42.560]
What's the piece of right wing propaganda? Please don't do this again.

[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.340]
Carlos get ready for that seat next week.

[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:47.860]
You're getting it fitted. Get your ass fitted.

[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:53.780]
That's what Moe was asking about. He said can we get Carlos's ass fitted? I'm not sure we was talking about it.

[01:55:55.260 --> 01:55:55.980]
560-560.

[01:55:56.720 --> 01:56:02.520]
On 18 and T for eyes of Marvel's line George knew a two to four for Lauderdale Harley this afternoon on federal dissent of Oakland Park Boulevard.

[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:08.700]
And then noon to two tomorrow Bill Sidel's Boulevard of Savings on Northwest 36th Street just west of 27th Hagel and Miami.

[01:56:09.420 --> 01:56:12.040]
Stop by and take a look at him.

[01:56:13.020 --> 01:56:15.700]
I mean I don't know what they're going to do there. What are they going to do there?

[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:16.320]
They're going to chat.

[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:18.460]
Chat. Try to grab up some of the free food.

[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:20.480]
Of course George needs the money. That's what he's saying.

[01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:26.860]
I mean it's a holiday weekend probably not too many people will show up but George keeps these little scams going because he's not getting paid too much.

[01:56:26.940 --> 01:56:29.380]
And so we need to see it there.

[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.060]
I don't know why that line keeps drinking because I'm never going to answer it.

[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:33.100]
WQ I am.

[01:56:34.100 --> 01:56:37.240]
I love McDonald's and I love eating my fries like the German.

[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:39.420]
Yeah okay eat this. WQ I am.

[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:40.920]
Hey how you doing?

[01:56:41.540 --> 01:56:41.540]

[01:56:42.480 --> 01:56:46.800]
Oh hey you know I say send all the punks back to be forms for.

[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:55.280]
Hey you know the other path you can in thing is amazing to me how now you look at his what he says and that's he starts to make sense.

[01:56:55.440 --> 01:56:57.320]
He's starting to be very moderate that's right.

[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:05.500]
Well he's been saying pretty much the same things but now the problem is that if you look at the last point of view and you look at the right point of view

[01:57:05.500 --> 01:57:07.420]
neither one really has the answer.

[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:12.760]
If you leave it alone it's going to blow up on our face at some point because we've been in bed with him for how many years.

[01:57:12.760 --> 01:57:17.240]
And if you do what the right says we put ourselves into a war that's going to last the rest of our lifetime.

[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:22.220]
But if we would isolate ourselves and say you know what let those people play with their own bond.

[01:57:22.260 --> 01:57:25.380]
No I'm not agreeing with the path you can on that.

[01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:28.100]
You can't isolate yourself in the world of weight is today that's ridiculous.

[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:32.480]
Well it's too late that's why it's too late to do that now because we're already in bed with everybody.

[01:57:32.800 --> 01:57:37.760]
But it was always too late it was always too late you can't do that in the world the way the way the

[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:40.560]
way it's become it's just the world is too small now you can't do that.

[01:57:40.960 --> 01:57:43.720]
Yeah but I mean what I was you know which way is the right answer though.

[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.640]
The right answer is not to be military adventurous than to start trying to colonize the world that's the right way.

[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.640]
Yeah but if you split the start taking care of our own people here first before we're going to go over there and rebuild the democracy there.

[01:57:56.740 --> 01:57:59.420]
Let's start to go worried about getting democracy back here first.

[01:57:59.760 --> 01:58:00.800]
You don't think it's too late for that?

[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.620]
No I hope not.

[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.320]
What does that mean? In other words we're not going to have any more elections.

[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:12.800]
But you're talking about just back it off and saying you know what we're not going to do anything about anything that happens over there.

[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:15.720]
We're just going to sit back on our hands and let everything happen.

[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.880]
Is that what I just said?

[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:19.300]
Does that what I just got through saying?

[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:20.460]
What it sounded like to me?

[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.900]
Sir get the wax out of your ears okay please.

[01:58:25.380 --> 01:58:25.880]
Is that what I said?

[01:58:27.340 --> 01:58:27.700]
What did you say?

[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:34.840]
Bill and Miami who's getting to be really it's getting a little boring to hear all these people whining about the freedom of speech.

[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:41.240]
Tim Prickestan the baseball Hall of Fame for can understand and Tim stood up and spoke in response to what he felt was unjust and he has every right to do so.

[01:58:41.420 --> 01:58:45.020]
If you have something to say that it's important you have people that are willing to listen to all this on whatever whatever.

[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:49.120]
Whatever you say in Bill and Miami is becoming very chronic he means well but a little bit curious away with him so.

[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.020]
Pontificates.

[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.820]
Just calm down Bill okay cut back on the faxes to 15 a day.

[01:58:54.800 --> 01:59:02.660]
Here's what it says from a lady in Hollywood I want to thank you profusely for the bedtime stories lady if I kept reading the bedtime stories these last several months I'd have been out of business already.

[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:07.180]
I always enjoyed hearing them and now yeah you enjoy them and the beener boy.

[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:11.780]
And now the links they provided just to tremendous wealth of information thank you.

[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:15.820]
Well that's good see there on the website for those who care to read them or have somebody read them to them.

[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:20.340]
I saw Boeing for Columbine yesterday he should be it should be required to be in Paris American if you've seen it.

[01:59:20.340 --> 01:59:23.820]
I'm glad you're a minest I'm going to go out and get a copy this weekend is available right on DVD.

[01:59:24.340 --> 01:59:30.600]
Yes regarding the PNAC website I guess there are many right wing Yahoo's that would agree with the agenda of the US world domination.

[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:38.220]
I could possibly be persuaded that you I should take on world leadership role however sending intrus to Maine and kill instant people is no

[01:59:38.220 --> 01:59:55.740]
anything way to lead didn't we fight a word to prevent a certain European dictator from doing the same thing you're correct about Vietnam remember some 40 years old my brothers served four tours I was one of those children who asked for world peace for Christmas if the Republicans get their way and I can't read this next line new generation of these children as we go step toward perpetual aggression.

[01:59:57.180 --> 02:00:10.960]
He has tired of holding for over 30 minutes had to give up well sorry lady and Hollywood but thanks for the facts okay see how easy it was for the facts and as opposed to hanging on waiting for me to answer the phones we wouldn't be doing a screenless but Georgia's taught Carlos very very well and Carlos refuses to answer the phones.

[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:17.900]
The 5 6 7 0 5 2 well he don't want to talk to those people out there and you know something I can't blame him when you come right down to who now does.

[02:00:17.900 --> 02:00:21.580]
I mean there's a few of them I'd say what percent would you say been good calls today.

[02:00:22.660 --> 02:00:31.640]
Now to agree with that and then we got 70% mouth readers because it's a holiday and a punk's got nothing better to do and they're going to call up I like my time also we got the little Cuban circles here.

[02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:47.880]
They're there in a feeding frenzy a day about a beep but you know as usual almost nobody responding to any of the things that I'm talking about I started the show talking about watching the movie born on the 4th of July with Tom Cruise last night and about how the timing of my watching is so perfect for what's going on right now and we've just finished with all this book.

[02:00:47.880 --> 02:01:11.740]
I'm not approaching the last 4 weeks does any as one person addressed that today no no because they can't just talk about a lot of generalized horse crap like this last guy's going to be a lecture well you're soon we should just sit back and I didn't say that that's what Papu can and is saying about isolating ourselves from the rest of the world you can't do it but we need different leadership not a bunch of corrupt allunatics that are controlled by big business.

[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:28.020]
I mean how stupid can a public be well let's do the trickle down again okay Reagan was able to push down we got a little one in there let's get another big fat one for all our good buddies big business okay more tax cuts for the rich Robin Hood and reverse and a public sits back like that.

[02:01:29.260 --> 02:01:38.040]
Man you talk about rape you know most always talking about gang rape is fine must be because the biggest gang rape I've ever seen is going on right now in this country gang rape is fun.

[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:48.900]
Yeah it's a panic but it must be enjoyed it they must like being on a receiving end if you know I mean back home WQ I am Q a M.

[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:51.760]
Yeah speaking the ill please speaking.

[02:01:52.660 --> 02:02:01.140]
Hi Bill two things last week you had a story about this reverend who had all this water and you couldn't take a shower and live.

[02:02:01.140 --> 02:02:07.720]
Right I'm just converting you couldn't you couldn't have any water you couldn't drink or do anything unless you would be baptized.

[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:21.220]
Well if you know I'm that guy would have been dead in the day I would have been amazing how actions happen but I just can believe that when I heard that if it's on news obviously people

[02:02:21.220 --> 02:02:25.460]
there know about it. What kind of people we got run stuff today.

[02:02:25.940 --> 02:02:31.760]
Luna six just like just like Franklin Graham and his Baptist friends that want to go to their convert all these schmathads to Christianity.

[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.300]
Yeah well lots of luck to them.

[02:02:34.740 --> 02:02:35.280]
Yeah exactly.

[02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:36.660]
All right thanks.

[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:37.460]
Hang in there Pali.

[02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:51.200]
Yeah that's right we're not only going to export democracy our kind of democracy with the off mod Chalabi and with Jay Garner and all these people that you don't want any part of all these people that either never would ever before in their lives or haven't been here in 40 years and people that don't have your best interest.

[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:58.780]
And not only that but we're also going to send some evangelists over there and take away your your grotesque infidel attitudes right they'll be better off.

[02:02:59.100 --> 02:03:05.380]
That's right we're going to make you offer it's kind of like crusades part two is what it's like part five well hundred.

[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:12.940]
We're going to Christianize baby we're going to spread the gospel accordion George W that's what we're going to do.

[02:03:13.880 --> 02:03:18.540]
Christianize all of them damn heathens because you know what Franklin Graham said it's a nasty bear or in this religion.

[02:03:18.640 --> 02:03:22.540]
And so we're going to like install it there what you want it or not.

[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:27.380]
And then of course the Catholic church will want their peace but then the Pope will create screwed up yet his chance.

[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:29.820]
Yeah really screwed up on the wrong side this time.

[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:38.700]
He wants a peace five six seven oh five sixty of course it's good Friday so we can't criticize the Pope today can we?

[02:03:38.700 --> 02:04:00.520]
We can that's silly old man in a dress and hear all over the world that they've got these millions and millions and millions of people all these get skis running around going here and all of these silly things with a cross and with the all these other ornaments and this these rituals that they're going through because the public this is the way the power structure or wanted boys and girls they want you to be a bunch of lemmings a bunch of sheep.

[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:07.440]
And just go in there we cite a bunch of gobble they got that was written by a bunch of superstitious the end of the thousands of years ago.

[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.580]
Thousands of years ago kind of like when they were making those artifacts that we just got through destroying an Iran.

[02:04:13.980 --> 02:04:17.600]
I am Lord this is 420 or 560.

[02:04:18.020 --> 02:04:18.920]
You am.

[02:04:20.180 --> 02:04:22.200]
Am I Junior honey?

[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:22.320]
No.

[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:28.760]
Oh.

[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:32.200]
Oh.

[02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:32.440]

[02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:34.700]
Oh.

[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:43.320]
Oh.

[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.340]
Oh.

[02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.840]
Oh.

[02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:51.880]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:51.920]

[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:51.940]

[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:51.940]

[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:51.940]

[02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:06.920]
It's 1145 at 560 W.

[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:07.340]
Yeah.

[02:05:07.380 --> 02:05:08.800]
It's just going to drop something in there.

[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:09.320]
I can't find.

[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:09.700]
Oh, there it is.

[02:05:11.720 --> 02:05:21.920]
So speaking of these siaf you do understand that one of the reasons we went back from orange to yellow alert is to convey the message to the American public that see now that we just conclude that it's very quick victory over there.

[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:26.020]
And this wonderful restored democracy to a country that hasn't had it in a zillion years.

[02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:29.200]
Now we feel a lot safer.

[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:29.780]
Right.

[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:30.740]
The chatter was down.

[02:05:31.020 --> 02:05:34.260]
And then what happens on the news last night now they're talking about his ball again.

[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:35.020]
Yeah.

[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:37.920]
And now maybe his ball is really going to pull some crap.

[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:42.500]
Wasn't Bobby Graham our very own VDI Senator Bobby Graham who would get my vote by the way in a heartbeat.

[02:05:43.200 --> 02:05:44.920]
Wasn't he screaming about this months and months ago?

[02:05:45.140 --> 02:05:45.280]
Yes.

[02:05:46.240 --> 02:05:51.440]
While we were talking about al-Qaeda and zirwing in on Sodom where we know we don't have any weapons of mass destruction.

[02:05:52.240 --> 02:05:54.380]
Hezbollah was like they're the Chigren of Woodpile.

[02:05:55.940 --> 02:05:58.080]
So immediately on the heels of lowering the alert to yellow.

[02:05:58.580 --> 02:06:00.760]
They said, well, you know, they're big trouble.

[02:06:02.660 --> 02:06:06.940]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:08.580]
WQAM.

[02:06:12.780 --> 02:06:13.180]
Hello.

[02:06:13.700 --> 02:06:14.020]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:14.460 --> 02:06:15.420]
Hey, Neil, how are you this morning?

[02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:15.700]
Okay.

[02:06:16.520 --> 02:06:22.280]
I'm just amazed that when you do the screen list of the amount of morons that come out of the well part of the experience in the clock.

[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.240]
That's what's out there, man.

[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:24.900]
Oh my gosh.

[02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:27.240]
I mean, people just don't have any intelligence to say.

[02:06:27.480 --> 02:06:28.020]
No, they don't.

[02:06:28.060 --> 02:06:31.120]
They just call up and they do the little lululu and they try to throw a customer away.

[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:31.120]

[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:31.820]
That's it, especially.

[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.040]
Like you don't stop it.

[02:06:34.660 --> 02:06:36.440]
I mean, these people are obviously they're not new.

[02:06:36.500 --> 02:06:39.060]
They've listened to your show before and they know you have a dump button.

[02:06:39.420 --> 02:06:41.080]
But their brains have been dumped, obviously.

[02:06:41.080 --> 02:06:43.420]
Well, sir, there are a lot of people out there who enjoy that.

[02:06:43.540 --> 02:06:45.220]
Okay. So we have a little something for everybody.

[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:48.580]
People with an IQ larger than 50, a IQ lower than a minus column.

[02:06:48.780 --> 02:06:50.660]
We have a little something for everybody. It's like a smorgasbord.

[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.080]
It's an amazing program to listen to when you're up here.

[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:57.980]
I'm up in Fort Lauderdale. I'm just amazed at everything these days.

[02:06:58.060 --> 02:07:00.080]
Well, I've been doing it for 27 years in this town.

[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:01.400]
So you can imagine how amazed I am.

[02:07:01.700 --> 02:07:02.580]
I'm real amazed.

[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.660]
Just take a deep breath and we all just lay down and go to sleep.

[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:06.420]
There you go.

[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:06.820]
Okay.

[02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:07.720]
Have a good weekend, Neil.

[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.520]
Seth, you learn. Okay.

[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:13.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.

[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:16.320]
What's this? You just facts me? Unfriking believable.

[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:17.760]
It says Newsweek story.

[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:23.520]
Baker and bots, the law firm defending the Saudis and lawsuit filed by victims of 9 11.

[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:25.980]
The Baker and oh, no, no.

[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:28.940]
This is going to ruin my whole weekend.

[02:07:29.100 --> 02:07:31.360]
Sorry. Baker and bots.

[02:07:31.480 --> 02:07:34.800]
They're defending the Saudis and the lawsuit filed by victims of 9 11.

[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:38.960]
The Baker in this law firm is James Baker the turd.

[02:07:40.220 --> 02:07:41.100]
You turd.

[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:47.020]
Who's also the leading counsel for the Carlisle group and was the point man for George Bush during the election in a 2000 recount.

[02:07:47.780 --> 02:07:51.780]
Remember him from a Bush one, of course, when we were talking about those damn Jews on foot for us anyway.

[02:07:51.940 --> 02:07:57.800]
See, just another piece of the 9 11 puzzledly liberal media will never touch liberal, of course, in quotes.

[02:07:58.980 --> 02:08:03.160]
Just think about it. You're nearest and dearest to an incident that the president doesn't prevent.

[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:09.520]
You sue the parties responsible and your president's lawyer defends them defending the Saudis.

[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:18.720]
15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi Arabian and the victims of the atrocities are suing the Saudi government.

[02:08:19.080 --> 02:08:22.880]
And the meantime, James Baker the third in his law firm are defending the Saudis.

[02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:30.260]
The leading counsel for the Carlisle group, of course, Bush and it been lodged and all these far-bitching agglomine business together.

[02:08:30.260 --> 02:08:32.160]
One, there you go. But don't confuse us with the facts.

[02:08:32.180 --> 02:08:33.360]
Okay, we don't want to hear this stuff.

[02:08:33.780 --> 02:08:36.500]
Comey. Right. This un-American stuff.

[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:40.220]
See, this is the reason why it was so easy for them to do it.

[02:08:41.100 --> 02:08:48.160]
Right in public view, not behind closed doors, not in the darkness of night, but right out there in public right in front of everybody's nose.

[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:51.460]
Just take away the election and to steal back the controls of the government.

[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.420]
That's been taking away from them for eight long years.

[02:08:55.180 --> 02:08:57.020]
They were just forming them out to get back in.

[02:08:57.260 --> 02:08:59.460]
It was kind of like those same guys they sent down there, Dave County.

[02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:02.800]
They were practically standing out the side of the doors at a white house banging on the door.

[02:09:03.060 --> 02:09:06.780]
Let us in! Let us in! It was the same thing. And they found a way to get back in.

[02:09:07.980 --> 02:09:08.720]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:11.100]
Q-O-R-L.

[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:12.180]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:13.660]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:14.260]
Okay.

[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:18.820]
By the way, Boeing for Carlisle mine is not coming out on DVD for quite a few months.

[02:09:19.640 --> 02:09:23.420]
It was supposed to come out in April, but because of the awards they're going to be releasing the theaters.

[02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:24.900]
How about it?

[02:09:25.100 --> 02:09:26.180]
It's like now in video tape?

[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.980]
No, it's not. It will be up for you.

[02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:31.240]
Like late August or November or even, you know.

[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.600]
I thought it was supposed to be this month. They pulled something.

[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:38.280]
It was supposed to, but they pulled the release or delayed the release because they're going to be releasing the theaters.

[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.260]
Because of the awards, because of the one award.

[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:41.040]
Okay.

[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.100]
So yeah, I had a pre-order for DVD and got notified.

[02:09:45.760 --> 02:09:47.660]
Anyway, and also one more thing about your site.

[02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:49.480]
I got the pictures of the kids.

[02:09:50.600 --> 02:09:54.120]
A lot of my friends are, you know, going to site and you kind of pass it with that.

[02:09:54.440 --> 02:09:58.460]
But, you know, I want to commend you if you have an accursed put that on there to show you the side of the war.

[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:02.300]
Because I'm not sure what ever happened with all this peaceful descent of the war.

[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:05.260]
I mean, you know, you need to get out there and, you know,

[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.900]
let people see what's going on over there.

[02:10:07.120 --> 02:10:10.740]
You know, it's not all happy cheering and, you know, throngs of bush supporters.

[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:15.440]
So, you know, a little commendation to you for having a courage put that on there.

[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:16.700]
Okay. That's right, sir.

[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:18.160]
I think it's important to see.

[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:19.480]
Amen. Thanks a lot.

[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:21.560]
Let me show NIO and keep it a good work.

[02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:22.180]
Thanks.

[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:22.620]
Bye.

[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.720]
56670560.560 on the AT&T Horizon Wireless Line.

[02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:30.020]
Oh, but you didn't see those wonderful demonstrations.

[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:31.920]
I had to put them down. That statue of the Orca.

[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:34.180]
I mean, it's just amazing how many stories there are.

[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.160]
And they're available.

[02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:38.340]
It's not like some secret dark place that you have to go and run and find them.

[02:10:40.060 --> 02:10:43.340]
All of this orchestrated, manipulated bull crap for public consumption.

[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:44.340]
Of course, very willingly.

[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.440]
There's CNN, MSNBC, and Fox foaming at the mouth.

[02:10:48.660 --> 02:10:50.860]
So they can show the propaganda of the American public.

[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:55.060]
Just like the generals used to lie through their teeth night after night during Vietnam,

[02:10:55.060 --> 02:10:58.160]
went on for years during the military briefings.

[02:10:58.520 --> 02:11:01.080]
And oh, we only had four American casualties this week.

[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:02.580]
And we killed 50,000 of them.

[02:11:02.660 --> 02:11:03.580]
Goops and blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:11:03.780 --> 02:11:04.880]
We did this and we did that.

[02:11:05.240 --> 02:11:06.260]
And let Kissinger was saying,

[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:09.320]
in pieces in our hand, yeah, piece on you, Henry.

[02:11:10.400 --> 02:11:11.420]
You not see bastard.

[02:11:13.440 --> 02:11:14.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.760]
I still think that the guy from the exorcist ought to go after him.

[02:11:19.220 --> 02:11:19.620]
Sir.

[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:20.340]
Father, Father Mary.

[02:11:21.100 --> 02:11:26.220]
Not the priest, the one the director, the one that fell out the window in the bird.

[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:27.180]
His name was bird.

[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:27.960]
That fact director.

[02:11:28.200 --> 02:11:28.300]
Right.

[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:28.960]
Directing movies.

[02:11:29.900 --> 02:11:31.380]
Got a little bit of tipsy there.

[02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:32.300]
He's happy to be a drunk.

[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.300]
I tipsy at the party.

[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.000]
You not see bastard.

[02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.200]
You don't remember that scene in the kitchen?

[02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:36.720]
It was great.

[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:37.480]
Of course I did.

[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:41.120]
The spirit of Christ compelled him to fall right outside that window

[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:42.640]
and his head twisted around like a pretzel.

[02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:44.640]
W-Q-A-M.

[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:46.060]
Yeah, hi, Neil.

[02:11:46.220 --> 02:11:46.720]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:49.820]
Tell me about got this take on what's happened correctly.

[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:54.440]
Over half a million people voted for Gore, but Bush got in.

[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:55.780]
Half a million more.

[02:11:55.980 --> 02:11:56.240]
Yes.

[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.240]
Voting for Gore.

[02:11:57.580 --> 02:11:57.700]
Yes.

[02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:58.760]
Even though he was a Gore.

[02:11:59.820 --> 02:12:00.400]
And now we're sore.

[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:01.440]
Yes.

[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.140]
So what's this in America, lore?

[02:12:03.140 --> 02:12:05.460]
They say, uh, for us.

[02:12:05.880 --> 02:12:06.120]
Yeah.

[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:08.660]
And then the three branches of government.

[02:12:08.700 --> 02:12:09.560]
And then we went to war.

[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:13.060]
Uh, and I'm pretty sore about that.

[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:15.140]
Uh, the three branches of Gore.

[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:17.440]
Because this president is rotten to the core.

[02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:21.140]
And, and what more can we say?

[02:12:21.260 --> 02:12:23.460]
And James Woolsey says we're in World War four.

[02:12:23.700 --> 02:12:24.300]
But anyway, I'm sorry.

[02:12:24.460 --> 02:12:25.460]
I'm rising poetic.

[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.440]
So the three branches of government are taken over by the Republicans.

[02:12:29.640 --> 02:12:29.780]
Right.

[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:32.240]
So that leads up forth to state the, the press.

[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:32.820]
Right.

[02:12:33.040 --> 02:12:36.520]
The press is now taken over by, so that's all four branches of government.

[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:40.660]
Well, the electronic media anyway, because like I said at the beginning of the show, they're regulated by the FCC.

[02:12:40.780 --> 02:12:42.700]
And of course, Michael Powell is chairman of the FCC.

[02:12:43.220 --> 02:12:44.600]
And they got everybody shaking in their boots.

[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:45.880]
And so they're go stepping in line.

[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:49.760]
Because they want to get the right approval for buying up whatever TV stations they can.

[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.280]
And so they don't want to offend anybody.

[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.800]
So they're like go stepping right along.

[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:53.880]
So that's a done deal.

[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:57.120]
So that's the only, the only hope like I said we got is the print media,

[02:12:57.120 --> 02:12:58.200]
which you can find on the internet.

[02:12:58.200 --> 02:12:59.540]
There's plenty of great information on that.

[02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:05.820]
But it also leaves the Democratic Party, which traditionally there's always been opposing political party.

[02:13:06.020 --> 02:13:06.600]
And where are they?

[02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:07.940]
You tell me.

[02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:09.380]
That's what I don't get.

[02:13:09.900 --> 02:13:11.140]
In fact, I got a great column here.

[02:13:11.260 --> 02:13:13.820]
Howard Dean, who was you know is running, who's a good guy.

[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:14.320]
Howard Dean.

[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:14.620]
Yeah.

[02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:17.040]
He says, bush, bush, it's not just his doctrine.

[02:13:17.180 --> 02:13:17.380]
That's wrong.

[02:13:17.460 --> 02:13:18.140]
I think I'm going to read that.

[02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:19.480]
You inspired me after the break.

[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:20.140]
Okay. Great.

[02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:20.700]
Thanks.

[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:21.480]
Thanks.

[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:23.300]
Howard Dean.

[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:24.880]
I think he's akin to a timid Dean.

[02:13:25.700 --> 02:13:26.580]
I sure like his sausages.

[02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:27.240]
I'll say them.

[02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:31.180]
So the Amatsapizza was a success from Jeff Cohen.

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:34.600]
We had him on the air for a few seconds here, but I started getting nervous because when he comes in, man,

[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:38.200]
he just like sitting down there and taking over and start telling all his pornographic stories.

[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:38.580]

[02:13:38.800 --> 02:13:40.780]
We just can't handle that, especially on Good Friday.

[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.900]
It would be a very bad taste.

[02:13:42.040 --> 02:13:42.500]
It was so good.

[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:43.300]
I eat too much.

[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:44.160]
Did you really?

[02:13:44.300 --> 02:13:44.460]
Yeah.

[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:45.460]
And how about being her boy?

[02:13:45.540 --> 02:13:46.020]
Did he like it?

[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:46.760]
Because he don't like anything.

[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:48.260]
I haven't tasted it yet.

[02:13:48.500 --> 02:13:50.460]
I ate, but he brought me something just for me.

[02:13:51.720 --> 02:13:52.100]
Talked it?

[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.000]
Yeah.

[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.420]
What did he bring you?

[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:57.360]
Veal for the heathen.

[02:13:57.500 --> 02:13:58.260]
Oh, try the Veal.

[02:13:58.360 --> 02:13:59.160]
It's the best in the city.

[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:03.140]
So you don't want to go that's right.

[02:14:03.220 --> 02:14:05.080]
He would need the Amatsapizza because it's ju-food.

[02:14:05.300 --> 02:14:06.000]
And isn't that funny?

[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.200]
I just mentioned timid Dean.

[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:11.040]
God, it's just amazing how I weave all of this into one big ball of crap.

[02:14:11.200 --> 02:14:11.500]
You know what?

[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:13.240]
I just amazed myself sometime.

[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:14.140]
How full of it I am.

[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:16.760]
Just like the thing about massive pequa.

[02:14:16.980 --> 02:14:19.480]
I was thinking that while I was watching it, in fact, in the beginning of the movie,

[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:23.380]
they showed it a flashback when he was a little kid growing up in school.

[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:25.900]
And it says, Massapique were long Ireland.

[02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:28.740]
I thought I just got through talking about Massapique one year two days ago.

[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:30.280]
It's all psychically connected.

[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.180]
Oh my God.

[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:32.900]
I'll put that damnness clear to shame.

[02:14:33.140 --> 02:14:34.620]
Neal psychic, a hotline, baby.

[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:36.020]
Make some reels every day.

[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:37.980]
Talking to about 50% of these.

[02:14:38.180 --> 02:14:39.000]
But the guy was right.

[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:40.340]
That's the way it is.

[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:41.840]
That's the show.

[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:43.240]
Okay. And that's what they want.

[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:45.740]
You know, we've tested this out for a hundred years.

[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:46.800]
And that's what they want.

[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:48.140]
They want a little bit of serious stuff.

[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:49.400]
They want some comedy bits.

[02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:50.820]
They want some idiots on the phone.

[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:53.360]
They want, you know, just the way to kill them.

[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:53.880]
They want to kill four hours.

[02:14:54.020 --> 02:14:55.740]
That's all we're not going to save the world in South Florida.

[02:14:55.980 --> 02:14:56.900]
The land of the walking dead.

[02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:59.000]
We can smell the death in the Toja in the year.

[02:14:59.240 --> 02:14:59.480]
We're not.

[02:15:00.520 --> 02:15:01.060]
Aren't we?

[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:02.260]
I thought we were.

[02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:03.480]
Well, if we don't do it, Randy will.

[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:03.780]
Wow.

[02:15:04.080 --> 02:15:04.860]
But she'll save the world.

[02:15:05.080 --> 02:15:05.960]
Come on, Randy. Do it.

[02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.360]
She said next week, she's going to do it.

[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:10.540]
Don't be knocking to God.

[02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:11.980]
It's okay. She's doing her best.

[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:13.260]
She's doing her little part there.

[02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:13.520]
Okay.

[02:15:14.360 --> 02:15:16.140]
Now if you can just hear that station anywhere.

[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:17.880]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:15:20.040 --> 02:15:20.760]
Hold on.

[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:21.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:23.180]
A long time.

[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.380]
This is the first time call.

[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:25.300]
Okay, man.

[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:28.660]
You should be the president.

[02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:31.900]
Why are you doing one election in the next election coming up?

[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:32.600]
Yeah, okay.

[02:15:32.740 --> 02:15:33.140]
Thank you, man.

[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:33.540]
Okay.

[02:15:37.380 --> 02:15:37.660]
Okay.

[02:15:40.200 --> 02:15:40.500]
There you go.

[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.540]
That's the kind of call we like.

[02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:42.760]
Man, I'm going to.

[02:15:42.940 --> 02:15:45.780]
Let me scrap myself down in the seat because the next section that comes like that will just

[02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:46.780]
pull me right out of the chair.

[02:15:47.340 --> 02:15:48.960]
I haven't got up out of the chair once today.

[02:15:49.020 --> 02:15:49.440]
I better get up.

[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:50.460]
You're going to get a blood clot.

[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:52.140]
Yeah, I'm going to get an oil clot.

[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:53.540]
Now, do I have any live spot?

[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:54.380]
This next break, do I?

[02:15:54.620 --> 02:15:55.680]
Because I already threw the long away.

[02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:56.760]
I beg your pardon?

[02:15:57.380 --> 02:15:57.500]
Nope.

[02:15:58.620 --> 02:15:59.800]
I wasn't asking you.

[02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:00.180]
Okay.

[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:01.080]
I was asking George.

[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:01.680]
Nope.

[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:06.980]
Well, he's been getting a little bit out of control since he's doing such a good job on a

[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:07.300]
website.

[02:16:07.740 --> 02:16:08.940]
And I've been talking about that a lot.

[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:09.440]
Which is true.

[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:10.980]
He's doing a phenomenal job on a website.

[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:15.800]
And I always got Eric all, you know, depressed and his ego is wounded more so than usual.

[02:16:16.400 --> 02:16:17.960]
And now he's starting to move in on Georgia's territory.

[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:21.540]
So he's getting as asphited for George's chair and the rest of the very transparent.

[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:24.660]
Transparent attempt for another bloodless coup.

[02:16:24.980 --> 02:16:25.040]
Okay.

[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:26.800]
And I guess he's been watching his recent history.

[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:28.500]
Live and local.

[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.940]
We're sports radio five sixties.

[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:31.300]
You a.

[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.200]
You a.

[02:16:33.760 --> 02:16:35.060]
I'm from our alien.

[02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:36.660]
Ross.

[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:41.520]
Ladies and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels.

[02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:44.200]
And listening to the near rocket.

[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:45.420]
I'm going to use the hour.

[02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:45.420]

[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:46.180]
Take care!

[02:16:47.260 --> 02:16:48.600]
Sit down.

[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:49.900]
All right.

[02:16:49.900 --> 02:16:53.980]
music

[02:16:53.980 --> 02:17:19.540]
W

[02:17:21.940 --> 02:17:25.260]
You understand the rest of the story of everyone.

[02:17:30.440 --> 02:17:33.120]
You must have been a space to be respected.

[02:17:33.120 --> 02:17:36.620]
You must have been a space to be respected.

[02:17:38.880 --> 02:17:39.860]
Very good.

[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.240]
Let's continue.

[02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:10.120]
Stoicri.

[02:18:12.900 --> 02:18:17.120]
Stoicri.

[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:33.620]
Stoicri.

[02:18:33.620 --> 02:18:33.620]

[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:44.640]
Okay.

[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:49.700]
We got the Mad Dog.

[02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:52.000]
It's a one to hump or hank or burger tree.

[02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.540]
And then Marlon's on Dreck.

[02:18:57.980 --> 02:18:59.820]
Maybe some of the meds fans.

[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:06.740]
This article about Jim Baker.

[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:09.420]
James Baker the turd.

[02:19:09.420 --> 02:19:09.740]
Yes.

[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:12.520]
It's one that's defending these Saudis.

[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:13.860]
It's very long.

[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:22.500]
It's recent alumni including Robert Jordan.

[02:19:27.420 --> 02:19:29.520]
What a series of coincidences.

[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:35.380]
Anyway, how are Dean from Vermont?

[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.880]
He's not running for president of the whole US just from Vermont.

[02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:39.960]
No, seriously, he's a good guy.

[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:43.360]
He writes, bush, it's not just his doctrine that's wrong.

[02:19:44.820 --> 02:19:49.200]
He says after reading a recent article I called into question my opposition to bush doctrine of preemptive war.

[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.000]
I wanted to state my opposition clearly to set the record straight.

[02:19:52.760 --> 02:19:55.660]
I appreciate the editors of common dreams that give me this opportunity.

[02:19:56.500 --> 02:20:00.680]
When Congress approved the president's authorization to go to war in Iraq no matter how well intentioned,

[02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:04.020]
it was giving me green light to the president to set his doctrine of preemptive war in motion.

[02:20:04.020 --> 02:20:06.820]
It now appears that Iraq was just the first step.

[02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:11.800]
Already the Bush administration is apparently eyeballing Syria and Iran as the next country's on its target list.

[02:20:12.180 --> 02:20:13.860]
The bush doctrine must be stopped here.

[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:17.640]
Many in Congress who voted for this resolution should have known better.

[02:20:18.140 --> 02:20:26.200]
On September 23, 2002, Al Gore cautioned in his speech in San Francisco that if the Congress approved the Iraq resolution just proposed by the administration,

[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:31.980]
it simultaneously creating the precedent for preemptive action anywhere anytime this or any future president so decides.

[02:20:32.720 --> 02:20:37.600]
And that is why it was such a big mistake for Congress to allow the president to set this dangerous precedent.

[02:20:38.340 --> 02:20:39.520]
Too much is at stake.

[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:48.120]
We've taken decades of consensus on the conduct of foreign policy, bipartisan consensus in the U.S. and consensus among our allies in the world community, and turned it on its head.

[02:20:48.900 --> 02:20:56.220]
It could well take decades to repair the damage this president and his cohort of right wing ideological advisers have done to our standing in the international community.

[02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:59.700]
There is a radical view of our world in the world.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:07.880]
The president who campaigned on a platform of a humble foreign policy has instead begun implementing a foreign policy characterized by dominance, arrogance and intimidation.

[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:18.140]
The title wave of supporting goodwill that engulfed this after the tragedy of 9-11 has dried up and been replaced by undercurrents of distrust, scepticism and hostility by many who had been among our closest allies.

[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.800]
This unilateral approach to foreign policy is a disaster.

[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:31.420]
All of the challenges facing the U.S. from winning the war on terror and containing weapons of mass destruction to building an open world economy and protecting the global environment can only be met by working with our allies.

[02:21:31.960 --> 02:21:36.400]
A renegade, go at a loan approach, will be doomed to failure because these challenges no no boundaries.

[02:21:37.340 --> 02:21:42.160]
The largest most sophisticated military in the history of the world cannot eliminate the threat of sleeper terrorist cells.

[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:45.760]
That task requires the highest level intelligence cooperation with our allies.

[02:21:45.760 --> 02:21:53.240]
Even the largest most sophisticated military in the history of the world cannot be expected to go to war against every evil dictator who may possess chemical weapons.

[02:21:53.960 --> 02:22:03.920]
This calls for an aggressive and effective diplomatic effort conducted in full cooperation with a united international community and preferably with the backing of multilateral institutions we helped to build for just this purpose.

[02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:11.300]
This challenge requires treaties such as the nuclear non-proliferation treaty that this administration sometimes treated cavalierly.

[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:15.860]
In any case, war should be a last resort or an option to be used in the face of an imminent threat.

[02:22:17.600 --> 02:22:24.740]
The UN Charter specifically protects the right of self-defense against armed attack and most agree that action against imminent threat is also justified.

[02:22:25.440 --> 02:22:37.360]
As president, as has been the case with all previous presidents, I will not hesitate to use our military might to protect our people or nation from imminent threat, but you will not find a dean administration turning to the option of force in the first instance as this president does.

[02:22:38.220 --> 02:22:44.600]
The immediate task in hand of the next president will be to begin rebuilding our relationships with our allies so we can work in concert tackling these challenges.

[02:22:45.120 --> 02:22:54.060]
The next president will need to undo the work of this band of radicals currently controlling our foreign policy, who view the Middle East as a laboratory for their experiments in democracy building, where no such traditions exist.

[02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:58.100]
Their approach will drastically change the view that the world has had of the U.S.

[02:22:58.740 --> 02:23:10.120]
Our nation should be viewed as a moral and just power, a power that seeks to do good, one that's led by example with a spirit of generosity, and one that works with the world community in advancing the ideals of human dignity and rule of law across the globe.

[02:23:11.020 --> 02:23:19.220]
The people of this country must understand that this administration is a far different concept of the role of America in the world, this concept involves imposing our will on sovereign nations.

[02:23:19.680 --> 02:23:27.540]
This concept involves dismantling the multilateral institutions that we've spent decades building, and this concept involves distorting the world of law to suit their narrow purposes.

[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:32.580]
When did we become a nation of fear and anxiety when we were once known the world around as a land of hope and liberty?

[02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:41.460]
On day one of a dean presidency, I'll reverse this attitude, I'll tear up the bush doctrine, and I'll steer us back to the company of the community of nations where we'll exercise moral leadership once again.

[02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:49.540]
And not only will I seek to heal the divisions the presidents caused in the world community, but also begin the process of healing the divisions he's exploited here at home.

[02:23:50.040 --> 02:24:06.780]
This president shamelessly divides us from one another, he divides us by race as he did when he claimed that the University of Michigan uses quotas and its law school admissions, he divides us by class by rewarding his campaign donors with enormous tax cuts, while the rest of us are deprived of affordable health care, prescription drugs for our seniors and good schools for our kids.

[02:24:06.780 --> 02:24:19.580]
He divides us by gender by seeking to restrict reproductive choice for women, he divides us by sexual orientation by appointing reactionary judges to the bench, and as he didn't text us by refusing to sign the hate crimes bill of included gay or lesbian Americans as potential victims.

[02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:24.480]
It's a bush doctrine of domestic division, and I want to be the president who tears that doctrine up too.

[02:24:24.980 --> 02:24:31.400]
I want to restore a sense of community in this country when it's not enough to worry whether your own kids have health care, but whether your neighbor's kids have health care.

[02:24:32.200 --> 02:24:41.540]
I want to go to the south and talk about race while white southerners have been flocking to the Republican Party in recent years, but I want to offer them hope that their children will benefit from better schools and affordable health care too.

[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:52.500]
The Republican Party has done nothing for working people black or white, and we need to remind southern white folks that the only hope for better schools and better job opportunities and health care is that that is affordable as a democratic president.

[02:24:53.560 --> 02:25:04.200]
I'm what is commonly referred to as a social liberal and physical conservative, I'm proud of the fact that as governor, I routinely balanced the budget, which it was not required to do by Vermont's Constitution, and paid down our state debt by nearly a quarter.

[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:14.040]
I had to make tough decisions, and I'll admit that some of them didn't make the progressive community happy, but I made those decisions because I have a guiding principle that social justice must rest upon a foundation of fiscal discipline.

[02:25:14.040 --> 02:25:22.100]
Because of that approach to the governance, Vermont today is not cutting education and is not cutting Medicaid, despite the perilous economic times brought on by the Bush fiscal policies.

[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:34.960]
One of my goals as a presidential candidate is to represent the democratic wing of the Democratic Party, aligned made popular by the late Paul Wellstone, some of question why would so closely align myself with the politician whose politics were considerably more liberal than mine.

[02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:42.900]
The fact is that I admired Paul Wellstone greatly, not only because of his politics, but because he stood up for his beliefs and fought for them until the day he died.

[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:48.780]
I can only hope that someday people will say the same about me, that I too remain true to my core principles no matter what.

[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:58.360]
I believe that the democratic party needs to stand for something if we want people to vote for us, and by standing against the Bush doctrine of preemptive war and domestic division, we may yet rediscover the soul of our party.

[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:04.320]
Right, how we're dealing with them and being a part of them. I was going to have my vote for five of them.

[02:26:04.320 --> 02:26:05.860]
You hit the lobby, great, and he's got my vote.

[02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:11.840]
During that reading, social liberal fiscal conservative, right? That's it. That's what we want.

[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:15.580]
As opposed to right wing, fanatic lunatic, which is what we got.

[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:21.620]
Hey, speaking of fanatic lunatic, yes, the beast just waddled through the door.

[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:26.000]
Psychic powers again. I lost 1.9 pounds in Monday.

[02:26:27.380 --> 02:26:33.660]
190.5 on my scale. What do you got? That's all you tub. He's going through the procedure.

[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:39.560]
And what's the look on his face as he giving that kind of like real time. He's grinning. He's always smiling. He's a happy man.

[02:26:39.780 --> 02:26:42.880]
There's a bit of confidence. Is there really a new candy bar?

[02:26:42.940 --> 02:26:47.680]
Maybe he picked up an erasure spat challenge this week, especially when on the day after Dr. Bob died.

[02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:52.840]
Is he on a scale yet? No, he's still unbiting.

[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:57.000]
No, no, I know he was already doing the purge and puke in the tea room.

[02:26:57.100 --> 02:27:00.740]
Okay, he's not fooling me. He was doing the old purge and puke. Let's go. Let's get on a scale.

[02:27:01.280 --> 02:27:02.920]
Comey. Comey.

[02:27:03.100 --> 02:27:04.260]
Drum roll. Really long.

[02:27:06.320 --> 02:27:09.860]
Here goes walking past the pizza box. There goes the belt.

[02:27:12.120 --> 02:27:14.360]
You can put a screen up if you want to take your hands off.

[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:18.720]
He's on the scale.

[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:32.180]
And two.

[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:33.020]
Balance.

[02:27:36.260 --> 02:27:37.340]
That's an improvement.

[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:38.880]
Four times we lost last time.

[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:44.400]
He's lost 62 pounds and balanced for life the beast.

[02:27:45.340 --> 02:27:46.740]
Is there an improvement you're getting there?

[02:27:47.220 --> 02:27:49.380]
I'm waiting for my glass.

[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:52.380]
You're still full of crap. Put away the monsters. All carbohydrates.

[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:53.760]
Okay, all carbs.

[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:54.920]
But it's, it's Pesah.

[02:27:55.460 --> 02:27:59.080]
You know something you got more guidance excuses than fat boy. That's what you got.

[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:01.400]
No more excuses, okay?

[02:28:01.660 --> 02:28:03.080]
Candy to 11 bread. It's Pesah.

[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.120]
No more excuses. You can't eat any bread. You can eat the bitter herbs.

[02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:11.200]
Yeah, we got some bitter herbs for it. They're going to come over and beat the crap out if you don't get with it.

[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.720]
You fat tub. If we try to save your life in spite of your hurricane allegiance.

[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:17.440]
Okay. Can he eat the gefilted fish jelly?

[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:22.520]
It's quite the fact that Mo had a fire your ass off that morning show because you were so guided and unprofessional.

[02:28:22.840 --> 02:28:24.740]
Oh, by, by the way, I'd like to ask this question.

[02:28:25.140 --> 02:28:27.340]
We do have that promotion coming up about the hot couples again.

[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:28.720]
We're going to do that again in May. Yes.

[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:36.300]
Now, is any is anybody working on that? I saw that memo from McGellia today, but it didn't smell too good.

[02:28:37.220 --> 02:28:39.800]
I mean, what's the story? Are we working on a way we're going to do this?

[02:28:41.760 --> 02:28:45.280]
It's only April 18, but I'm just worried about how it's going to appear on a website.

[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:48.900]
When it's going to happen, it will appear and it will happen.

[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:53.800]
I was thinking Monday to put something up so people can start getting accommodated and start getting the pictures ready.

[02:28:54.220 --> 02:28:56.340]
Very good. It'll be the same kind of a thing like that.

[02:28:56.340 --> 02:28:59.620]
No, today's picture is the contest at theorodgers.com. That sort of thing.

[02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:02.360]
Okay. Now, don't let me forget after the break, we got to do the OJ story.

[02:29:02.660 --> 02:29:04.140]
I might just do a whole lot of bedtime stories.

[02:29:04.180 --> 02:29:05.780]
Okay. Okay. Okay. All my tabloids here.

[02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:08.420]
I think we already pressed the callers to their limit today.

[02:29:08.900 --> 02:29:10.780]
We had a few good ones in here.

[02:29:12.640 --> 02:29:16.680]
About 30 bad ones and about 5 good ones. That's okay. It was all right.

[02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:21.220]
It was our kind of a day. Okay. A little bit like I said, the smorgasbord on your radio, a little bit of everything.

[02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:22.780]
As opposed to that right wing fanaticism.

[02:29:23.480 --> 02:29:30.000]
Are you sure that you hear so much of like 99% of the time, including from people you never would have expected it from people sold out?

[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:32.700]
I don't want to mention no names. People are totally so rough.

[02:29:32.700 --> 02:29:35.000]
Yeah, but wait a second. Forget about it too late.

[02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:41.180]
1213 and 560 WQM ever thought about getting you a wireless phone. Absolutely. Everybody does.

[02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:47.140]
You know how valuable it is to keep in touch with your business associates during the day, as well as being connected with your family all the time.

Wireless city or team mobile authorized either call them today, 1, 888, like the beast did all week long, 888, 221, 80, 80.

[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:43.420]
My name is Michael. This is 430560. We are in the way.

[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:46.760]
Why are you testing?

[02:30:46.760 --> 02:30:58.760]
distributing

[02:31:08.640 --> 02:31:15.500]
Count the vote, count the vote, baby, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote

[02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:20.800]
Are you ever since this presidential race began?

[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:24.220]
Live often wondered who was going to win?

[02:31:25.440 --> 02:31:29.080]
Some palm-reach people went to do their voting chore

[02:31:29.800 --> 02:31:34.120]
So count up all the ballots and find out who's gotten more

[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:40.220]
Those hope folks seem to have one thing in common

[02:31:40.220 --> 02:31:46.520]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes too Patrick, you can end

[02:31:48.700 --> 02:31:52.320]
So I'd like to know who won the election

[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:56.800]
Yes, I'd like to know who won the election

[02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:03.380]
Count the vote, count the vote, baby, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote

[02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:08.880]
Count the vote, baby, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote

[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:14.460]
The final tabulation started coming in

[02:32:15.280 --> 02:32:18.420]
Then I saw a new splash on Channel 10

[02:32:19.420 --> 02:32:23.160]
Some angry people all together been a bunch

[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:28.160]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a punch

[02:32:30.400 --> 02:32:34.220]
Those hope folks seem to have one thing in common

[02:32:34.220 --> 02:32:40.160]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes too Patrick, you can end

[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:46.340]
So I'd like to know who won the election

[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:50.760]
Said I'd like to know who won the election

[02:32:51.460 --> 02:32:55.080]
Oh, I'd like to know who won the election

[02:32:55.780 --> 02:32:59.480]
Yes, I'd like to know who won the election

[02:33:23.880 --> 02:33:29.460]
Count the vote, count the vote, baby, count the vote, count the vote, count the vote

[02:33:29.460 --> 02:33:34.920]
protest signs, drop bush, knock bombs. Who would have thought W's did for war?

[02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:38.280]
This is kind of cute. I'll save it. There are 65 and all. Hold on to the others.

[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:39.240]
Really? Yeah.

[02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:45.980]
Summer. Okay. I said we can use that all next week. Sounds good to me.

[02:33:46.580 --> 02:33:50.460]
OJ Shocker. This is in the national inquiry. So there's a pretty good chance some of it might be true.

[02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:55.720]
OJ Shocker. I want Sydney to disappear. How do you like that?

[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:04.600]
Why? Poor Sydney. There's a picture of Sydney. By the way, it looks pretty good in that picture. Yeah.

[02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:11.180]
OJ Simpson stunned bar patrons in Miami as he complained bitterly about a 17-year-old daughter and then made what someone

[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:15.000]
that's took as a thinly veiled threat on her life. The inquiry was learned exclusively.

[02:34:16.100 --> 02:34:23.360]
Two eyewitnesses described the shocking sense scene where they saw OJ also made it that he's beaten Sydney and while trying to get patrons to do drugs with him,

[02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:27.440]
he confessed that he'd stalked his girlfriend, Christy, Prody, the same way it stalked. That's life Nicole.

[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:34.040]
But the most stunning part of OJ's outst, our birth was when he said I wish Sydney would disappear just like her mother did.

[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:34.520]
Oh my God.

[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:40.580]
I couldn't believe it when I heard a one witness told the inquirer after taking in Simpson's comment about Sydney at the stake in Al Barr.

[02:34:40.860 --> 02:34:44.460]
It was absolutely disgraceful. It sounded me like he wants her dead.

[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:49.800]
Another Shocker bar patron declared when those words passed his lips, I immediately got sick to my stomach,

[02:34:49.800 --> 02:34:52.720]
and then to make matters worse, he let out this steep, hearty laugh.

[02:34:54.260 --> 02:35:00.740]
I've always felt that he probably killed Nicole, but after hearing that I fear for Sydney's safety now, so does Nicole's sister, Denise Brown.

[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.880]
OJ murdered my sister and the mother of his children. He's capable of anything that he's told the inquirer.

[02:35:06.900 --> 02:35:11.220]
When I heard those words about Sydney disappearing like her mother, it sent chills down my spine.

[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:15.200]
I just hope and pray it doesn't do the same thing to her they did to my sister. He could snap again.

[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:20.680]
I wouldn't put anything past him. I'm concerned about Sydney all the time, but she knows we're always there for her.

[02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:25.700]
And when she turns 18 and can legally move away from her father, she knows she always has an open door in our home.

[02:35:26.300 --> 02:35:33.140]
But a friend defends Simpson maintaining that when he says he wishes Sydney would disappear like Nicole, he doesn't necessarily have murderous intent,

[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:38.300]
but rather he's looking forward to that they see he leaves home as Nicole did following their marriage break up.

[02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:41.420]
Maybe he just wants Sydney to get out of the house and stop driving him nuts.

[02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:44.560]
It's still not a very nice thing to say about your daughter, the friend said.

[02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:49.960]
Simpson revealed his sick plot to make Sydney disappear at the end of a tirade he launched about his teenage daughter.

[02:35:50.660 --> 02:35:55.320]
He was sitting at the bar at a stake in a restaurant near his house in Kendall, said the eyewitness,

[02:35:55.680 --> 02:36:00.380]
who along with the other page and asked that their names not be published for fear, Simpson could target that for revenge.

[02:36:01.500 --> 02:36:07.480]
He was downing Mondrick after another complaint bitterly about Sydney. He said they're constantly fighting, can hardly control her anymore.

[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:14.640]
He called Sydney a real nasty bitch and my burden, he said he hates her. He also meant that he's hit her more than once.

[02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:19.940]
OJ banged his fist on the bar and told me the only way I know how to deal with her is to yell on the screen matter.

[02:36:20.340 --> 02:36:23.700]
I don't know any other way to exert any type of control over her, I just can't handle her.

[02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:29.000]
She wants to move out the day she turns 18. Trust me, when that day comes I'll pull the door wide open.

[02:36:30.060 --> 02:36:36.580]
Simpson said the pair recently had a vicious fight. OJ said she started yelling at him and said, stay the F out of my life.

[02:36:37.060 --> 02:36:41.960]
Throughout his drinking session Simpson tried to find somebody to smoke marijuana with him, the eyewitness revealed.

[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:48.120]
OJ spent most of the night looking for somebody to party with. He asked several people if they wanted to go burn a joint in his truck.

[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:51.060]
He asked me too but I don't think drugs said this, whoever.

[02:36:51.880 --> 02:36:53.780]
The other bar paid for a woman told the inquirer.

[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:58.400]
OJ asked me if I wanted to smoke some marriage with him, I politely turned him down.

[02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:04.180]
When contacted by the inquirer to comment on our story Simpson insisted that Sydney is like any other girl her age,

[02:37:04.180 --> 02:37:07.120]
and she's just fine Simpson said he didn't have threatening Sydney.

[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:10.900]
But in the bar OJ did admit stalking his girlfriend Christy Proty.

[02:37:11.620 --> 02:37:17.200]
He said he's been having problems with Christy the eyewitness disclosed. He said I was once crazy for her but she's full of problems.

[02:37:19.080 --> 02:37:26.920]
When I asked him what kind of problems he meant he said cocaine she does way too much cocaine.

[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:34.140]
He then said that more than once he's disappeared for days at a time eventually he said he'd have to go find her and he always knew where to go.

[02:37:34.420 --> 02:37:39.500]
He always found her at a particular drug dealer's house. She'd be there for days doing cocaine nonstop he said.

[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.080]
Then OJ said something shocking that reminded the eyewitness of the night in the colon around Goldman were murdered the eyewitness said.

[02:37:45.380 --> 02:37:48.040]
He turned to me and said you know what I'd have to do to get her out of that drugie's house.

[02:37:48.460 --> 02:37:53.960]
I'd have to sneak out of his property so nobody could see me then slicker around the backyard till I could make my way up to the house and get her.

[02:37:53.960 --> 02:38:03.780]
I've hidden in that fool's yard more times than I can remember when he said that all I could think of was how they accused him of sneaking around the Coles property before the killings and peeping through the windows peeping through the keyhole.

[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:11.140]
To hear him talk about doing practically the same thing to his girlfriend was chilling says this story in the April 29th National Inquirer.

[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:11.320]
Oh!

[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:13.420]
Jay, how do you like that?

[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:14.380]
Chilling.

[02:38:14.840 --> 02:38:15.600]
It is chilling.

[02:38:16.240 --> 02:38:17.900]
To be talking about his chilling that way.

[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:21.380]

[02:38:22.200 --> 02:38:24.680]

[02:38:40.120 --> 02:38:41.560]

A thousand hidden Easter eggs.

[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:15.120]
I'd settle for those Cadbury eggs.

That's what Joey Kerr would say.

[02:39:26.100 --> 02:39:26.480]
See him lately?

[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:27.120]
Not lately.

[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:27.620]
Good.

[02:39:28.040 --> 02:39:32.280]
Pompato Park, don't forget the action live Wednesday Friday and Saturday post time 91715.

[02:39:32.580 --> 02:39:34.360]
A block south Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[02:39:34.460 --> 02:39:35.660]
Bring a briefcase full of cans.

[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:37.520]
My life and loco.

[02:39:38.040 --> 02:39:39.700]
This is sports real five six.

[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:41.660]
Way to way.

[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:43.800]
You'll look old.

[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:51.420]
He's been through the keyhole watching mom and dad.

[02:39:51.920 --> 02:39:55.600]
He's been through the keyhole the most one we ever had.

[02:39:56.200 --> 02:39:59.460]
Mom and dad were playing tag by fair on the bed.

[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:03.440]
Mommy used her boobies as a teleport daddy's head.

[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:05.640]
Mommy's head was bobbing.

[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:07.400]
She almost got whiplash.

[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.120]
I don't know what she was drinking but you got a lot more stash.

[02:40:12.300 --> 02:40:15.680]
They've been through the keyhole and sure what I see.

[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:19.300]
But I'm sure you like it more than anything on TV.

[02:40:20.240 --> 02:40:23.640]
Mommy and dad were hooked together like my went in wands.

[02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:25.900]
Last time I saw something like that.

[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:27.480]
Mom was yelling at the dog.

[02:40:28.040 --> 02:40:29.420]
Dad was breathing heavy.

[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:31.460]
Mom was on her knees.

[02:40:32.140 --> 02:40:35.700]
He must have had a poopful cause she kissed him where he pees.

[02:40:35.700 --> 02:40:39.660]
He's been through the keyhole watching mom and dad.

[02:40:39.900 --> 02:40:43.580]
He's been through the keyhole the most one we ever had.

[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.520]
But we watched a little longer and I started to get sick.

[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:51.540]
If daddy's name is Albert, one mom asked for dick.

[02:40:52.120 --> 02:40:53.980]
Daddy grounded his eyes broke back.

[02:40:54.240 --> 02:40:55.400]
Mommy wanted more.

[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:59.520]
She went back on top of him but all he did was snore.

[02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:03.460]
He's been through the keyhole at the minutes pass.

[02:41:03.460 --> 02:41:05.900]
I can't wait to try this out.

[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:07.560]
I'm so good in my class.

[02:41:07.800 --> 02:41:09.920]
Well, I can't wait to try this out.

[02:41:10.040 --> 02:41:11.540]
I'm so good in my class.

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.460]
From 32 to a 560 WQIM.

[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.040]
Ryan Seacrest, I'm not gay.

[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:18.420]
He says this is in one of these rags.

[02:41:18.560 --> 02:41:19.360]
Which one?

[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:21.300]
The glow by believe.

[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:23.000]
Anyway, who cares which one it's in?

[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:27.520]
He says I'm not gay but Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are hotties.

[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:28.100]
You're gay.

[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:32.540]
American Idol Pretty Boy host Ryan Seacrest says he's not gay.

[02:41:32.540 --> 02:41:35.560]
But he still thinks Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are a couple of hotties.

[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:38.300]
Many guys won't say it but I'll just say it.

[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:40.520]
Look at him. That guy's absolutely beautiful.

[02:41:40.620 --> 02:41:41.060]
You're gay.

[02:41:41.280 --> 02:41:42.880]
28-year-old Ryan said in the frank interview,

[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:47.440]
he's never been in love with a woman and can understand why he seems to turn them off.

[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:51.800]
He's never been in love with a woman and thinks Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise are beautiful but he's not gay.

[02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:52.400]
You're gay.

[02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:56.000]
Look, if I see Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise walking down the street in my head as a man,

[02:41:56.500 --> 02:41:58.760]
I can look at them and say that guy's good looking.

[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:02.040]
He says by saying those things people think I'm gay.

[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:03.060]
But I'm not trust me.

[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:05.660]
If I were gay, I'd be getting more action than I'm getting now.

[02:42:06.500 --> 02:42:10.060]
As for admitting he's never been in love despite having dated such beauties as Playboy,

[02:42:10.060 --> 02:42:12.020]
playmate Brandi Robrick.

[02:42:12.860 --> 02:42:13.580]
Ryan explained,

[02:42:13.700 --> 02:42:16.020]
I think it has to do with my idiosyncrasies turning women off.

[02:42:16.120 --> 02:42:19.320]
Look, a lot of women be turned off hearing me say how hot I think Brad Pitt is.

[02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:19.740]
You know what I mean?

[02:42:19.980 --> 02:42:21.460]
So it probably doesn't help my cause.

[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:23.240]
Yeah, if he'd quit saying it over and over again.

[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:25.340]
It's kind of like a message.

[02:42:28.800 --> 02:42:30.280]
Just not getting them the right message.

[02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:35.280]
Speaking of weird people, somebody we despise,

[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:38.380]
Dr. Phil's teen sex shame.

[02:42:39.240 --> 02:42:40.560]
This also in the globe.

[02:42:41.880 --> 02:42:44.100]
TV shrink hits below the belt to boost ratings.

[02:42:44.300 --> 02:42:46.240]
He's exploiting kids and there's no excuse for that.

[02:42:46.880 --> 02:42:50.960]
Dr. Phil McGraw is so greedy for ratings that he's turned his TV talk show into a cultural cesspool

[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:54.300]
that is exploited in sexuality of young girls say sources.

[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:54.860]
All right.

[02:42:55.460 --> 02:42:57.040]
I think George is going to start watching.

[02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:58.140]
I'm telling you.

[02:42:58.880 --> 02:43:04.520]
Oprah Winfrey's spin off prodigy recently featured anguished moms and their trampy daughters on a syndicated show.

[02:43:04.640 --> 02:43:13.420]
One girl was just 11 years old the other 13 and leering camera angles shamelessly focused on their scabbly clad butts and crotch areas as they cavorted around.

[02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.620]
Like I said, bring it up.

[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:25.100]
Many Dr. Phil staffers consider that I were to be the lowest kind of freak show and we're hoping that the series won't become more like Jerry Springer reveals a show insider.

[02:43:25.100 --> 02:43:31.160]
I don't think Oprah would approve she's always taken a higher road and would probably be shocked to learn how taudry we've become.

[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:33.540]
Goodlady how taudry.

[02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:41.920]
On the show 13 year old Ashley's mom complained that her daughter had trampy taste and dress like a whore and admitted to calling the girl a bitch and a slut.

[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:47.200]
During the interview the camera showed Ashley checking out her figure in a mirror, zeroing in on her butt and crotch.

[02:43:47.580 --> 02:43:51.680]
They also pictured her thong underwear with a dollar sign on the crotch and pockets for condoms.

[02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:57.520]
George is checking the TV guy to see what time this one's on.

[02:43:58.220 --> 02:43:58.800]
There you are.

[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:07.920]
The camera of crew followed mom and daughter on a shopping street picking into a dressing room to reveal Ashley trying to pair of sexy lace up panties.

[02:44:08.440 --> 02:44:09.640]
Oh she's 13 years old.

[02:44:10.020 --> 02:44:10.880]
That's exactly.

[02:44:10.880 --> 02:44:21.840]
Once again the camera brazenly zoomed in on the girl another segment 11 year old Victoria rolled up the legs of her boxer shorts and turned on the waistband to reveal her hot pink thong underwear which had her mother Sally seeing red.

[02:44:22.380 --> 02:44:24.720]
The camera lingered on a close up of the young girls behind.

[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:37.120]
This was double exploitation child rights advocate I lean King tells the globe they exploited the children on the year and they did more damage by adding sexual innuendos and sneaky camera angles to make them look even more sexually provocative.

[02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:44.280]
King regional director of the Washington DC based justice for children pegs the 52-year-old TV shrink as a hypocrite.

[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:49.260]
Dr. Phil says he tried to expose the problem and protect these kids when in fact he's exploiting them she blasts.

[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:54.000]
These are pre-pubescent children whose private parts are being exploited by his camera crews and there's no excuse for that.

[02:44:55.500 --> 02:44:58.620]
Another expert says Dr. Phil made boost ratings but at the girls expense.

[02:44:58.620 --> 02:45:06.400]
Shame on Dr. Phil for falling for the ratings game rule that sex cells and Dr. Louis Muller a psychologist who specializes in adolescent behavior.

[02:45:06.900 --> 02:45:13.680]
Once these youngsters go back to school they'll attract attention and while the boys will be after them for sex their female friends will present them for the newfound stardom.

[02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:17.300]
Eventually they'll have no friends in their self-respectful tumble even farther.

[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:20.500]
Muller ads that troubles at school may turn out to be the least of the girls problems.

[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:26.800]
I really fear for them because once they've been exposed on national TV it's almost impossible to regain any semblance of a normal life she says.

[02:45:26.800 --> 02:45:30.420]
Muller also says that Dr. Phil must say gold an opportunity to do some good.

[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.580]
What the girls needed to hear was how true love his distinguished from sex he says they didn't need to be exploited like underrated girls in a porno flick.

[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:38.260]
How do you like that?

[02:45:38.300 --> 02:45:38.740]
All right.

[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:42.220]
Man, be a new boys waiting to get home to see Dr. Phil.

[02:45:42.580 --> 02:45:43.220]
What channel?

[02:45:45.340 --> 02:45:46.220]
Snoop Dogg.

[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:49.800]
Snoop Dogg-y dogs' raunchy video could cost him his life.

[02:45:50.160 --> 02:45:53.640]
Fury over topless teens eyed in shooting attack on the rapper.

[02:45:56.160 --> 02:45:59.960]
Snoop Dogg may have been the target of a drive by shooting carried out by an angry father or boyfriend.

[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:04.880]
One of the teens exploited in the hip hop stars sorted new girls gone wild video friends say.

[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:14.040]
The 31-year-old rapper was unentering when a passenger in a dark colored sedan recently peppered his convoy with semi-automatic handgun fire as it traveled under an LA freeway.

[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:17.860]
Bullets stuck three of the rapper's cars and wounded one of his eight arm bodyguards.

[02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:25.200]
Three of hip hop's biggest stars, Tupac Shakur, notorious B.I.G. and run DMC's Jam Master J, have murdered in the past.

[02:46:25.800 --> 02:46:30.980]
But the embarrassing G.G.W. videos in which college age girls bear their breast and more.

[02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:32.540]
Now, George is looking for those.

[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:33.220]
Mm-hmm.

[02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:34.260]
Probably has them all.

[02:46:34.740 --> 02:46:35.260]
Have ticked off.

[02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:38.860]
A couple of people notes a source and Snoop hawks a new video that he directed in the late night in commercial.

[02:46:39.300 --> 02:46:42.200]
I mean, there are a lot of people really upset by these things as a Snoop pal.

[02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:46.240]
Let's face it, some of these fathers don't want to see their little girls tapas on some raunchy video.

[02:46:46.240 --> 02:46:48.940]
They wouldn't mind seeing somebody else's girls on there.

[02:46:49.780 --> 02:46:52.500]
Snoop who's new single beautiful is currently ranked in the top 10.

[02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:56.280]
I thought I thought beautiful was Christine Aguilera.

[02:46:56.520 --> 02:46:57.040]
I have no idea.

[02:46:59.500 --> 02:47:01.740]
But what is he who is starting that today?

[02:47:01.840 --> 02:47:03.760]
I know she does have a song beautiful.

[02:47:03.860 --> 02:47:04.660]
Maybe he's got one too.

[02:47:04.820 --> 02:47:05.260]
Yeah, I know.

[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:05.620]
How the hell are you?

[02:47:06.080 --> 02:47:07.760]
Snoop doggy doggy singing beautiful.

[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:08.700]
Maybe.

[02:47:09.060 --> 02:47:09.460]
I don't know.

[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:11.460]
Carl was just checking it.

[02:47:11.880 --> 02:47:14.160]
Snoop who's new single beautiful is currently ranked in the top 10.

[02:47:37.780 --> 02:47:44.140]
He's been feuding with death row records founder su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-su-

[02:47:44.140 --> 02:47:59.480]
The one-18-year-old woman who appears in one of the videos, all of us make mistakes and do something bad, but not everyone's had a video to continue to remind them about it. And Snoop was real name is Calvin Brottis. They have found himself on the firing line because of his infomercial says the source. Snoop is the one face associated with these videos as a pal points out.

[02:48:00.060 --> 02:48:06.980]
People are wondering if some angry father or boyfriend of one of these girls decided to give and take a shot at him. If someone's angry enough, he just don't know what they'll do, they say.

[02:48:06.980 --> 02:48:14.860]
I do like that. Wow. Let's see here's that. I think the Snoop might drop a poop or two.

[02:48:15.060 --> 02:48:23.720]
You don't forget, join George today, known to 2-4. What time is it? 2-4 for Lottordale Harley. That says Harley like in a guiding light.

[02:48:23.720 --> 02:48:29.160]
Look at it on the federal highway just south of Oakland Park Boulevard, some free air crew on Crapio and Prizes.

[02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:39.240]
And enjoy free food from Atlantic City subs. Then tomorrow noon to 2. George will be out of Bill's side with Boulevard of Savings. On Northwest 36, he just west of 27. I have a new mind. You'll have some prizes at Atlantic City subs.

[02:48:39.300 --> 02:48:41.320]
And wait till you meet the crowd that shows up to see George.

[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:46.240]
Find a local of these cities five cities. The radio's all yours.

[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:48.380]
You win!

[02:48:50.200 --> 02:48:52.580]
Try the U.S. Day.

[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.800]
You're a bad girl.

[02:48:54.120 --> 02:48:58.800]
Girl's Gone Wild is the video that shows real girls fleshing their goods during spring break week in Florida.

[02:48:59.420 --> 02:49:02.340]
But what about the hotties who spend the whole year in Florida?

[02:49:02.780 --> 02:49:06.920]
Now they've got their own video. It's Golden Girls Gone Wild!

[02:49:07.180 --> 02:49:07.560]
Who's here?

[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:12.740]
Why it's all your favorite Golden Girls? Dorothy Rose, Blanche and they always said I'm this Sophia.

[02:49:12.900 --> 02:49:14.520]
I sure it's a sequel to Sunday that trip.

[02:49:14.620 --> 02:49:23.040]
Well, you won't have to think because Golden Girls Gone Wild is two full hours of these ravenous retirees showing loads of wrinkly skin.

[02:49:23.160 --> 02:49:26.400]
I am the most attractive and available woman in all of Miami.

[02:49:26.620 --> 02:49:33.620]
Golden Girls Gone Wild! These hotties with hot flashes are going topless every chance they get. Except when their arthritis plays out.

[02:49:33.620 --> 02:49:35.680]
I'm going to be able to open my blouse again.

[02:49:35.840 --> 02:49:42.100]
It doesn't give any sexier than this. But they'll take our word for it. Listen to what the Golden Girls are saying about each other.

[02:49:42.320 --> 02:49:43.340]
She looks like a phagodon.

[02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:47.680]
It's Golden Girls Gone Wild! Watch it just one time and you'll agree!

[02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.180]
No, the dark day in the history of mankind.

[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:52.460]
Golden Girls Gone Wild! Go now!

[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:57.700]
Wow, this is something. This is the thing about all the memos from the major American television networks.

[02:49:57.920 --> 02:50:00.240]
I didn't even finish reading it. I could have went to stick it in the facts machine.

[02:50:00.760 --> 02:50:04.680]
I don't want to jump into it because we only got a couple minutes left so I'll save it.

[02:50:04.800 --> 02:50:12.400]
I'll pour it over the weekend and save it. But it's got a whole bunch of memos near, at least, quotes from memos that were sent by American TV networks.

[02:50:12.880 --> 02:50:14.060]
You can give the site out.

[02:50:14.900 --> 02:50:16.240]
Up on the website is...

[02:50:17.860 --> 02:50:19.120]
Up on the website.

[02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:20.400]
Oh, here it is.

[02:50:22.280 --> 02:50:24.260]
What is that? TBR, I can't even read it.

[02:50:24.460 --> 02:50:25.520]
TBR news.org?

[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:25.940]
Yes.

[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:27.000]
Slash archives.

[02:50:28.760 --> 02:50:29.900]
Oh, it says too.

[02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:31.640]
Yeah. Well, whatever. TBR news.org.

[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:32.760]
Yeah, read it.

[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:35.760]
Anyway, I'm going to save it. Let me forget I'm Monday.

[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:40.120]
This other piece, though, by that phagodon, I mean, Michelangelo, is seen you really in New York press.

[02:50:40.940 --> 02:50:43.440]
Slams and smears by grow put rock on a block.

[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:48.500]
Like most guys in common, it's the Washington Post-Loyed Grow, which is political as any DC operative.

[02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:50.660]
He certainly knows what he can get away with smearing and whom he cannot.

[02:50:51.440 --> 02:50:55.920]
It's a fine line. You've got to show you have some balls, but go too far and you'll have those balls cut off.

[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:59.900]
In this context, someone like David Brock is an easy, virtually cost-free target.

[02:51:00.340 --> 02:51:03.220]
An individual, few among the current regime in Washington, would shed a tear over.

[02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:08.420]
Surely there's no lawful love-lost either between Brock and Groves editors at the post either.

[02:51:09.180 --> 02:51:14.820]
The author of Best Selling Blinded by the Right After All did make fools of so many journalists in that time, revealing that he's...

[02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:23.240]
...and that his supposed exposés about Anita Hill and Bill Clinton's stories with its journalism packed dutifully and sensationally ran, were mostly based on fabrication, distortion, and half-truths.

[02:51:23.720 --> 02:51:28.200]
It was no great surprise then when Groves smeared Brock last year after the publication blinded by the right,

[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:32.960]
floating a piece of Mac Rudge inspired dirt about Brock and his column attempting to discredit him.

[02:51:33.260 --> 02:51:42.040]
Nor was it a shocker when Groves went back for a second helping, two weeks ago, slamming Brock and the item about a star-studded DC party, celebrating the publication of the paper-back edition of the book.

[02:51:42.380 --> 02:51:44.880]
Groves once again offered up the Dudge Sludge on Brock.

[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:49.100]
He also quoted a negative review of the book from last year out of scores of positive reviews,

[02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:55.140]
and ridiculed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, and Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid for hosting the release party.

[02:51:55.460 --> 02:51:59.160]
Well, that's what goes, okay? Any friend of Mac Rudge ain't no friend of ours except for Lynn.

[02:51:59.440 --> 02:52:02.660]
We'll make an exception in your case, but only you, and it's about time you wise up, sweetheart.

[02:52:04.020 --> 02:52:14.300]
God, Mac Rudge, just a self-hating screamer, man, just makes my skin curdle, makes my blood boil, makes me nauseous, makes me want to...

[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:44.280]
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush

[02:52:51.040 --> 02:53:00.180]
Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush! Hush!

[02:53:00.180 --> 02:53:03.380]
frame recorded a song called Bisexual Chick and Lisa Marie was spotted

[02:53:03.380 --> 02:53:04.880]
hang out in a gay bar.

[02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:09.000]
Friends worried that the singer's bitter divorce from Nick Cage could

[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:10.580]
send her reading emotionally again.

[02:53:11.860 --> 02:53:14.560]
Sources set the record straight on Lisa Marie's trouble life after

[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:16.860]
she reveals she had an affair with another girl as a teenager.

[02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:19.680]
Around the time she attended boarding school she insisted it was a

[02:53:19.680 --> 02:53:23.480]
one-time fling, but Lisa Marie 35 was heading for her third divorce,

[02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:27.080]
admits she still attracted to women and sources of senior Ed lesbian bars.

[02:53:27.800 --> 02:53:31.500]
On the April 8 Howard sperm show Lisa Marie confessed to America's

[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:34.060]
most famous shock shock and expert at getting celebrities to spill their

[02:53:34.060 --> 02:53:37.660]
secrets that she lost her virginity at 15 and had relationship with

[02:53:37.660 --> 02:53:39.660]
under girl when she was 16 or 17.

[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:43.900]
As whether she dabbled with chicks Lisa Marie replied there was just one.

[02:53:44.180 --> 02:53:46.720]
But the stunning singer who's getting raves for a new album told

[02:53:46.720 --> 02:53:49.760]
Stern it's not like I haven't had an urge to be with women but I just

[02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:51.560]
I'd like to keep it at gay a bay.

[02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:54.060]
I do like that.

[02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:57.120]
She likes to keep it over there on Bay Street is what she's saying.

[02:53:57.260 --> 02:54:00.540]
She'd sell more records if she you know can out with that.

[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:04.220]
And what a shame we got all this good stuff that I guess we'll also have to wait for next week.

[02:54:04.600 --> 02:54:07.460]
How Dr. Lewis mom really died by cops say it wasn't murder.

[02:54:08.700 --> 02:54:12.480]
Ozzy's wife beaten up in restaurant and this thing you just fact me is just amazing.

[02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:17.280]
It's long been a strong belief of many Americans that their print and

[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:20.680]
television media subject to certain government oversight and finally control.

[02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:23.820]
Recently a middle-level executive of one of the three major American TV

[02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:30.520]
network said over 1500 pages of memos from the corporate offices of his network in New York to the head of their division their TV news division.

[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:37.220]
These mimos contain a multitude of instructions concerning the presentation of national and international news for the network's viewers.

[02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:43.560]
Corporate is obviously subject to the opinions of various pressure groups to include those of official Washington and the Jewish community.

[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:48.020]
It would be impossible to show all these revealing documents but selections are certainly possible.

[02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:53.060]
What is not possible is to reveal either the name or conscience strict immediate executive or the company that

[02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:59.180]
employs him. These comments there for can be accepted or rejected by the reader as they fit but if the shoe fits where it.

[02:54:59.900 --> 02:55:08.600]
For example March 22 it's not conducive to maintaining an overall neutrality in the Palestine uprisings to show any pictures of the American

[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:11.100]
peacenick that was run over by the Israeli Army bulldozer.

[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:16.860]
This is only a dimension is a tragic accident for which the IDF is truly saddened.

[02:55:16.860 --> 02:55:24.300]
February 10th it's not permitted at this point to use a refer to any film clip stills or articles eminating from any French source whatsoever.

[02:55:26.800 --> 02:55:33.160]
February 26th it's expected that coverage of the forthcoming Iraqi campaign will be identical with the coverage used during desert storm.

[02:55:33.620 --> 02:55:40.220]
Shops of GI's must show a mixed racial combination any interviews must reflect a youthful and idealistic not the cynical point of view.

[02:55:40.520 --> 02:55:45.660]
The liberation of happy enthusiastic Iraqis can best be shown by filming crowds of cheering citizens waving American flags.

[02:55:46.380 --> 02:55:55.160]
Also indicated would be pictures of photogenic GI's fraternizing with the Iraqi children and handing them food or other non controversial presents like candy for example which we've seen numerous times.

[02:55:55.280 --> 02:56:02.840]
The shoulder should not show examples of violent death also indicated would be brief interviews with English speaking Iraqi citizens praising American liberation efforts.

[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:08.260]
All such interviews must be vetted by either the White House or Pentagon before public earring.

[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:11.240]
Oh my god. How do you like that?

[02:56:11.960 --> 02:56:15.480]
And that's just getting started on the rest of the Monday. Okay a little a little tease.

[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:20.520]
Oh no you're wrong Neil you're on that liberal media that's that poisoning everybody's mind.

[02:56:21.080 --> 02:56:23.080]
My beautiful girl.

[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:25.760]
Here's sports radio 5 6 o'clock.

[02:56:25.960 --> 02:56:26.900]
She way am.

[02:56:32.520 --> 02:56:40.920]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to the domic people killed with the gas that we sold him.

[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:50.960]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's going now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing forget about Korea.

[02:56:52.200 --> 02:57:00.700]
The nooks there's no to namba right wing is drilling it over and over into our head.

[02:57:01.120 --> 02:57:06.980]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:57:17.720 --> 02:57:23.940]
3,000 people killed are now forgotten let's exploit them instead.

[02:57:24.180 --> 02:57:34.260]
Hey there's oil to be counted going after sent down to play kato sama there's no longer mention of the name in lot.

[02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:54.120]
But no it seems concerned all comfy and complacent to leave in every word of this cartel administration that control this by fear for media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over into our heads.

[02:57:54.680 --> 02:58:00.300]
That Iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:21.200]
The last civil rights is the price that we're paying we're all suspects now that the ash crop is saying I have nothing to hide.

[02:58:21.400 --> 02:58:27.320]
Table talkers all are saying like no media can't hold on has any reservations.

[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:31.800]
Out of robo battle and world annihilation.

[02:58:32.120 --> 02:58:37.820]
