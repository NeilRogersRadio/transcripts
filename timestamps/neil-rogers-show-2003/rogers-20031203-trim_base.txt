[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980]
I'm going, girl. You're a man, baby.

[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.980]
What a schedule we got today, huh?

[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.660]
Ah! I know what we knew.

[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:08.280]
That was mo!

[00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.200]
I think I've heard these.

[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.840]
Well, congratulations. Get a life.

[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.740]
You fell in love with her when she was exploited for reasons of the version on the evening news.

[00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.420]
And now, Terry Shiveaux is back, singing holiday favorites.

[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.260]
The whole family can enjoy, even if you don't have one.

[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.860]
Terry! Terry!

[00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.240]
The whole family can enjoy dancing, where she can get a clean shot of that way, bal正, jいう dirgy,bourne, wha wahешekah...

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:56.840]
But it's not possible for us to experience such Infinite IoT fields or around the world in such time as your native,

[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.840]

[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.600]
Let's Harry put you in a coma with this insipant standard.

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:44.920]
What are your Harry Shimon holiday CD today and with happy holidays on the half of yellow

[00:01:44.920 --> 00:02:03.760]
list everywhere. Happy birthday, Terry, such as it is. Today's your 40th birthday. Aren't you

[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.020]
excited about that? And I wasn't invited to the party. And of course, great minds work

[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.600]
alike. George's birthday is on Saturday, December 6th. Just a whole bunch of other people

[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.980]
in the building on December 6th. We don't know who any of them are, but at least this week. But anyway,

[00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.740]
that should cover it. Happy birthday to all and to all of good night. Good night. Good day. On the

[00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.540]
eva Terry Shavos 40th birthday last night, the independent guardian appointed for the Florida

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.720]
woman at the center of her right to die controversy said in his court order report that she is in a

[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.560]
persistent vegetative state. Kind like Greg Reed would know likely to have improvement. Kind of like

[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:49.300]
Greg Reed. Dr. J. Wilson, the guardian odd lead him. Did you ever hear that before? Nope. Well, that

[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.880]
means legal advocate. I said and the reason I know that is because it says so in parentheses. Dr. J.

[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.220]
Wilson, the legal advocate for Shivos submitted his report to Florida governor, Jeb Bush yesterday.

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.860]
On Monday, findings made public yesterday. Wilson also recommended that more testing be done in the case

[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.660]
to satisfy the contentious nature of the litigation. Shivos husband, Michael Shivos says he's following

[00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.080]
his wife's wishes to let her die while her parents Bob and Mary Shivos are fighting to keep their

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.860]
daughter alive. Keep that tube going, baby. Keep the old tube shooting. The doctor writes that all the

[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.440]
evidence in Shivos file supports the contention that she cannot take oral nutrition or hydration and

[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.740]
cannot consciously interact with her environment. Kind like Greg Reed. But he does not directly recommend

[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.660]
the governor rescind his executive order that reinserted Terry's feeding tube. Bush said in the

[00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.620]
statement after he reviewed the report, nothing in Dr. Wilson's report leads me to believe that the

[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.080]
state should be lifted at this time or that Mrs. Shivos should be deprived of her right to live.

[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:50.080]
Her right to live. Oh brother. It's just pathetic is what it is. You need a little bit of a crazy

[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.460]
people. Yeah, like that asshole in Ohio, which is now not just happy going after the interstate,

[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.940]
but is also targeting elementary schools and what do I tell you, America? Crazy people with guns.

[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.380]
Crazy people with guns. 111 votes on a poll yesterday. Now before we get to the poll result,

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:13.740]
I would like to say this that we have a checkered schedule today. Would that be a kind way of

[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.580]
putting it? What's going on in that place? Before we do that, here's our usual call on line 9.

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.860]
No, good morning. I take it out. Take it out now.

[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.560]
Oh, Terry, happy birthday, sweetheart. Anyway.

[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.020]
Right. Oh, this is so cruel, you know, because it's not a funny story, but you might as well laugh.

[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.380]
What are you going to do? Sit down and cry. She's in bad shape to put it mildly.

[00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.280]
Anyway, speaking of bad shape, that'd be a good poll question. What's in bad worst shape? Terry Shivos

[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:55.760]
are scheduled today on QAM. First of all, the moment was out again this morning and we're having

[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.900]
an investigation of that. He's got the crud again, I believe. Absolutely. And he was in

[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.320]
no show. You think it was something we said? Like what? Oh, I don't know what we ever say or do.

[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.020]
Joe Rose was there this morning between eight and 10 and we're here today between 10 and two.

[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.880]
And of course, being Wednesday, it's really like that phone. He wanted two hour. And then things

[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.780]
start taking a turn for the bizarre Curtis Stevenson does a damn good job. But he's on two to four.

[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.700]
Nobody has any idea where mad dog. He's in hiding. All right. Four to seven. The booster is on.

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.500]
In place of the Humper. And all I can say is we like for. Yeah, we do.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.760]
So Blue Shambi would be on four to seven. And it's very appropriate. Duff was rationalizing that

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.680]
whole deal because a lot of Marlon news last few days. And the Marlon's actually flying in the face

[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.740]
of the usual criticism of South Florida, the resigning cast, Theo and this one and that one of

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.180]
the red river and the Mike Lowell and now they're on a verge of resigning. They don't want to send

[00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:06.000]
Pudge packing. Right? Yeah. No, that's the worst incident. Pudge packing. So they're working on Pudge now.

[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.220]
And so it looks like the Marlon's are going to keep most of the team together. So I'm sure the

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.160]
booster will have lots to talk about that. Plus his orange hair and his observations about Hank's

[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.100]
breast reduction and his predictions for success or failure. 111 votes on our poor yesterday. Who

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.920]
would you like the most scene retire already? That was our poll question. I think a pretty good one.

[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.440]
Moe Howard David and Larry King were in a just in a lip lock there for the longest

[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.460]
damn time. You know what? They were neck and neck nose to nose, hair piece to the hair piece,

[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.480]
a spender to suspender, checkered pant to checkered pant, lime green, they were lemon yellow.

[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.840]
And all of a sudden Moe pulled away like Larry was just laying out. Who would you like most

[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.940]
to see retire already? Moe Howard David 314 votes. Absolutely. Wins by a mile. Larry King did well,

[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.940]
though 193. I'm coming in a very respectable, especially after we left him off for a long time,

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:04.420]
a respectable third. I miss this a boring Don I miss a dead man in a chair. I don't know if they

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:07.880]
got me. They got to have somebody watching sometime on MSNBC in order to justify keeping

[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:14.100]
that thing on the air. Don I miss 139 Jerry Lewis 114. Hey lady, my face is so fat.

[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:20.580]
I think Goldberg speaking of fat has had 63. Bob Barker 58. John Madden speaking of fat 49.

[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:24.520]
The O'Rider speaking of fat 44. I was like kind of in mid-pack.

[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.880]
Yeah, he pointed one percent. Mid-packing. Barbara Walters 41. I edged her out barely.

[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.740]
Paul Harvey 27. Regis Filvin 22. Dave Van Hornley had 19. Now that goes to show that there's

[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.160]
no interest in the Marlins. And Dan Moreno 18. Danny Boy coming in last place. Nobody don't like Danny.

[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.640]
But Dave Van Hornshut ahead. He probably should have beat out Moe when he came right down to it.

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:53.080]
That call on the Marlins win in the World Series is so egregious, so unacceptable, so grotesque,

[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.620]
so bush-league, so pathetic. Even the rim man who's a friend of Dave Van Horn,

[00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:01.360]
even he said it was just awful when he called me yesterday, written in the middle of passions.

[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.280]
Quick call me in the middle of passions. Okay, it's on 330 to 430 here, remember every day.

[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.560]
Don't be called me in the middle of passions. Call me any other time except during the show

[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.120]
when I'm awake. But other than that, is that 330 to 430 Canadian time?

[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.980]
A. Oh, you remember that expression? It's A. Okay. Yeah. Well in Canada we say it a little bit

[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:26.520]
different. We say it's okay. A. Okay. But anyway, now River Clawden, he was distraught over the fact

[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.940]
that I'd forgotten entirely about the Panthers being in Montreal over the weekend and the fact

[00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:35.000]
that he was there and he was sitting his hotel room all a block away from my hotel. I'm being

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.540]
else to eat the one of us Saturday afternoon waiting for the game just sitting there twiddling

[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:43.900]
his thumbs, bored his crap, whether it was horrible. He said we could have gone to lunch. Well, I did

[00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:47.180]
go to lunch as a matter of fact, but I've been friend of my way out. We had a lot of great meals.

[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:52.720]
Oh, speaking of meals last night was my big kind of like mini reunion and you know what, it was great.

[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.700]
I've no regrets, no complaints. I must confess. See now a lot of people, if you have any,

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.260]
if you're vain like somebody we know, then you'd be concerned to see somebody 43 years later

[00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:07.760]
when they see how old and fatter and uglier you got. But I don't, I'm not concerned about that.

[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.540]
That was the least of my concerns because obviously he had dressed and looked away. I do. He can't be

[00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:16.660]
concerned about any of that. But I don't know. I just was worried after all these years. What are you

[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:21.520]
going to have in common with anybody? Sit and talk about for hours and hours, three hours and 15 minutes

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.380]
later we left and concluded a fabulous dinner at Ruth Krischstakehouse, which I bought last night.

[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.400]
Yeah, I bought dinner. Remember it was great. Man, I had maybe the best ribeye I've ever had in my life.

[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.420]
You're going to tear them apart. What? You're going to crush them. Who?

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:39.200]
River. Why do you say that? That's two meals in Miss Town. I told them that yesterday.

[00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:43.280]
I already said, Oh, which one? I said there's only one. It's the one in the Hilton Hotel downtown.

[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.040]
They're really good one. Oh, it's a beautiful joint.

[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.400]
And the check with tip came over 400 bucks. Can you name it?

[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.840]
And that's okay. I can handle it. I bought. I told them up front. I bought. And there was

[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.280]
nice of them because they didn't go whole hog. You know, I said order anything you like.

[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:08.320]
And whatever you want. And they both got the petite filet. And then we did have dessert. Oh,

[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.780]
man, did you ever have the banana cream pie Ruth Krischstakehouse? I might have. I had something

[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.280]
that I forgot what it was. It just like got the bananas are like glazed. You know what I mean?

[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:21.940]
Ugh. And it's not really traditional pie. It's got like a round pie crust underneath it. Oh,

[00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:28.520]
I should have eaten that if I did. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Seriously. Ruth Krischstakehouse is outstanding.

[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.960]
I you know, you can give me a solid dance. All you want about shulas and I know we make a lot of

[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.120]
money from shulas. So we love shulas restaurant. But but the fact that the matter is I don't want to

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:41.500]
eat in the steakhouse where the menu is on a football. Okay. It's just a little bit too sportsy even

[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.680]
for me. You know, even for even for a jock sniffer like me. It's a little bit too with the menus on

[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.360]
a football. Yeah. When you're supposed to go ahead and say to the waiter, give me the ball. Give me the

[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.740]
ball. Give me the ball. I just can't do that. They throw it at you from the other side. As opposed

[00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:59.220]
to the beautiful ambiance of Ruth Krischstakehouse and believe you meet a one here is just oh,

[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.660]
gorgeous. Well, they all are. They're all nice looking. But the atmosphere is great and it's not

[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.820]
pretentious or stuffy. You don't have to go dressed up in a zoot suit. You know, and it's just

[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:15.880]
so anyway, these are two of my high school friends. Dave and Jenny that I haven't seen in 43 years

[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.060]
and we've been communicating on the wicked web on the internet. And they happen to be in town to

[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:24.800]
see a play and they said, Hey, let's get together. I said, sure, I'll buy a dinner at a great restaurant

[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.200]
which come to five hours only a block away from the hotel. They were staying at the Sheraton Center.

[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.500]
And so we meet at seven o'clock last night. Like I said, three hours and 15 minutes later, we had

[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:38.200]
the talk we had dissected and chewed up everybody that we ever were in class would. And it was great. It

[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:45.320]
was a fun time. I enjoyed it. And we'll do it again. You know, I mean, I see not having ever

[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:49.520]
gone to the reunion. See the reunion people. I've been going to reunions a lot for years. But

[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.040]
having never gone to any of those and then also having seen the pictures that Dave emailed me as

[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:59.740]
some of my classmates who could have passed for 7580 easy. You know, I was a little bit trepidated.

[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.020]
In fact, I want to play the trepidation contest. But it turned out great. So don't have any fears

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:09.240]
unless you're a vain asshole out there and you're worried about, well, what do they think about the way

[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.700]
I'm going to look? And they looked okay. They looked older to me, which is not a lot older, but a little bit

[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:19.380]
I would say, which may be feel a little bit better. I'm fairly well preserved for an old fart pickled.

[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.000]
I'm pretty well pickled as a matter of fact. I am going in for my breast reduction next week.

[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:29.680]
First, I want to see how it works out for the Humphrey today. See if his settle into place.

[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.960]
10-12, we got a couple of good polls for you today. And let me just alay some of the fears and

[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:40.300]
rumors and the hysteria and hopes. But I don't really know. Did you get any response yet from our moles?

[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:46.560]
No. Okay, well, while we're waiting for that, about the FRL rumors, we don't want to talk about it too much.

[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.920]
I'm hearing that that's bogus. Now the reason we'll tell you when we come back, why that morning show on 9-40 is off,

[00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.740]
we finally got the MS on that. 10-13 is 5-60 WQM. Big news, big important news. How the Pontiac GMC is now,

[00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.480]
Auto City Pontiac GMC of Pinecrest, but the San Great deals have no fear because they're still here.

[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.240]
Our friend Tom Lamanate there, no more. He sold the dealership to Lumberto Perez of Auto City,

[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:14.380]
view of Pontiac GMC of Homestead, but General Sales Manager Joe Prieto, a great guy,

[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.060]
still in charge. And that's what you ought to be concerned about. Stop by Auto City Pontiac GMC of

[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:24.940]
Pinecrest for great Neal Rogers deals on all makes and models in stock. Take advantage of 0% financing

[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:29.660]
for up to 72 months or save up to 9 grand with rebates and incentives. That's correct. You heard

[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:34.620]

My CTS needs a new hit life. You mind if I borrowed your veins tonight.

[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:58.980]
There's another line that goes here. But I'm not allowed to measure it with our fluid.

[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:05.260]
As a movement, Mo-How we're not keep faster. Now speak cranky bit.

[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:10.600]
Turn it in. You turn over the cover.

[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:15.740]
10-17 happy holidays from all your good friends at QM. Those of us who are working today about 3.

[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.340]
And that's about it. And the Josh. That's about 4. And the Beast. That's about 5.

[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.880]
Well, it's just one of those days. Just about 4 in the middle of the week.

[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.520]
Huh? What? Nothing. That's about 6.

[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.460]
Oh, that's right. The Beast. That's about 8. He ate it.

[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.760]
Here's our first poll today. If Scott were on and this is based on a lot of these rumors that

[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.360]
are being circulated. Let me tell you the real reason. What's that guy's name?

[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.640]
Carl? What's he that was on the mornings on 9.48? Maybe Josh. No. I'm the last one that'll know.

[00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.040]
Carl Schmendrick? I don't know. He don't know. He was looking at all the other.

[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.800]
Carl Marks. Carl Marks. Anyway, I guess because you know he was buying his way on the

[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:55.640]
year with that deal. Kind of like Mr. Ego. No, I didn't know that. Well, he was. He was

[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.460]
brookering the time. And most of his sponsors, I guess, were those offshore gaming things,

[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.160]
which come to find out that nobody can put on here anymore, at least for the time being.

[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.640]
These those his name. Carl Foster. Carl Foster. Was he came to Bud Foster?

[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.960]
I've been Foster. Foster Hewitt. Foster Hewitt. And what about the Steven Foster?

[00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.560]
What did Steven Foster write? What was the song? I don't know. Oh, some great American song. Come

[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.080]
on Steven Foster. You don't know what song he wrote? Say it if you know it.

[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:30.660]
It didn't it didn't it. I don't know. Some great Americans talking to the midi in the other room there.

[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.900]
Anyway, there's a committee doing what? Trying to think of the name of that song.

[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.960]
Oh, I don't know what it is. Oh, you've got me. That's just embarrassing. It's like it's

[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:44.660]
American example pie. It's like see the USA in your share. Oh, what's that one?

[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.780]
I'll share really an apple pie and hot dogs. They kind of go together and dine ashore.

[00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:52.500]
She's still dead by the way. And she was still Jewish even though she didn't want nobody to know it.

[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:55.560]
That was that was kind of embarrassing that you but not you but your life.

[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.000]
This is your life with Ralph Edwards. I told you that a million times. Her name was Fanny Rose Shore.

[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.480]
Okay. And when they brought her relatives on there and talked about her real name,

[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:08.140]
and it became obvious that she was a Jew. You know what I was that real honeydripping Southern accent she had?

[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.400]
What do you know from Dynasture anyway? What's on my talking about? See, I coast to show out. You know what?

[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.340]
You know what caused me to do that? That reunion last night. I see. Because now that I'm old and I'm hanging out

[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:22.500]
with my old friends for my old days in school 100 years ago. Now I'm like talking about old crap.

[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.580]
Pretty soon we're going to be talking about old people who died. What we do that every day anyway?

[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:30.320]
You're in a time of a Gertrude enterley. Oh, Steven Foster. I'm going to have to look it up.

[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.520]
What is it? I said I'll look it up. Nobody knows that. Nobody around but like you mentioned before,

[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.700]
no one's in the building. Well, like the mad dog and the Hank would know that was Hank might know it.

[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:50.160]
Thanks a man of letters. Steven Collins Foster, a versatile town professional songwriter.

[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:57.080]
Well here, let me check this out. Oh, this is WPBT. There he is. God, Dan, he was ugly.

[00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:03.100]
But anyway, let's see. What are you right? Swany River. Did he write that?

[00:18:05.740 --> 00:18:10.320]
I don't know. Oh no. Is there a movie called Steven Foster? I don't know.

[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:17.400]
Oh, come on. Apparently you can get you can get Viagra Online from Steven Foster. Can you?

[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:24.920]
Wow. Get a rise out of that. American experience, Steven Foster. The Steven Foster, the musical.

[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:30.760]
Steven Foster, home pages. Oh, Jesus. Do I hate the internet or what? The music of Steven Foster.

[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:36.580]
That's the one. America's famous folk songwriter died in New York, New York, January 13th, 1864,

[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:41.160]
just before the end of the Civil War. Okay, here's the music of Steven Foster. Do you think this one

[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.120]
will be it? Are you looking at the same thing? I am looking at search results and yeah, nothing.

[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:52.340]
Let's see. The most popular songs are, oh, here we go. Oh, Susanna. Oh, Susanna. But that's not what I was

[00:18:52.340 --> 00:19:01.900]
thinking about. The camp town races. Hey, it wasn't that it? Sure. Old folks at home. My old

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.860]
Kentucky home. Oh, man. Now you see if you are a horse racing person and you went to the Kentucky

[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:09.740]
Derby, they played my old Kentucky home before they put on the post break. They made us play it on

[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.560]
the recorder. She was like, Brown here. He didn't say where the hair was. General Annie,

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.120]
beautiful dreamer and the voices that are gone. Now, which one of those is the one I was thinking

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:26.980]
about? It certainly wasn't the Ossuzanna or camp town races. Must have been camp town races.

[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:32.780]
Get out of town. Maybe it was the my old Kentucky home. That must have been it. Anyway, how do we get

[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.680]
into that? Oh, because Carl Foster was the guy doing the mornings on the 940 and lost all of

[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.240]
his sponsors basically so that he couldn't afford to keep the thing going. That's the rumor.

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:46.520]
So a lot of other people have started the rumors since they've been running ESPN radio or some

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:51.660]
crap in the morning and Louis of a morning show. And the rumor being that for now and still

[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:55.240]
gots are going to be doing mornings over there. Well, I mean, the idea of still gots doing a show

[00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.520]
anywhere. So just tragic. Although we'll fit right in over there in the home of the revolving

[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:04.540]
radio shows all the who the hell are we to talk today. But nonetheless, so here's the pool today.

[00:20:04.780 --> 00:20:08.740]
If Scott for well one on the year on mornings on another station, how would that affect your

[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.500]
listening? Now, this is kind of kind of alluded. I think you're going to have to look at your

[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:17.740]
computer at your monitor screen and you're going to have to like absorb the choices. Okay?

[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:23.140]
Well, no, you know what I'm saying? How would that affect your listening? I'd still listen to Moe. I

[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:29.120]
don't listen to Joe. I'd still listen to Moe Anjo Rose. I'd listen to Forrell Anjo. I'd listen to

[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:35.520]
Forrell not Moe or Joe and no change. I'd listen to QM before 10 anyway. See what I mean? Very complicated.

[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:39.240]
Which I like. It'll make him. It'll get your juices flowing a little bit. Okay? Everyone

[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:42.080]
actually getting their juices. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Glowing a little bit, especially early in the morning.

[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:59.080]
That's like that. Rubs fell rap with the no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. We know what we didn't know.

[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.960]
I don't listen to Joe. I'd still listen to Moe Anjo Rose. Moe Joe. I'd listen to Forrell Anjo. I'd

[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.560]
listen to Forrell not Moe or Joe. See, I can't even keep up with this and I wrote the poll.

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.320]
No change. I don't listen to QM before 10 anyway. That's a fabulous poll. The second poll will

[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.840]
take later is about that big fat dark guy that the police often since an anti. Which we do have

[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:26.800]
more on that later. Another dead GI in Iraq. A US military spokesman reported that a soldier

[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:30.640]
died yesterday after an explosive device hit his convoy is that a mate continues about the

[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:35.880]
number of Iraqi casualties resulting from US forces response to weekend ambushes. That whole thing,

[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:43.060]
you know, in the Samara. They got about 45 different stories about that. The soldier's convoy,

[00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:47.320]
the one who was killed yesterday from the 555th engineers group of the Fourth Infantry Division

[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.760]
initially called in the wrong location. Delaying the arrival of a medical team to evaluate and

[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:55.880]
evacuate the soldier. Coalition official said the soldier was dead on arrival at nearby medical

[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.640]
facility. The incident took place south of Samara 75 miles north of Baghdad. The same location

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.320]
as the weekend ambushes. Tuesday's death was the 441st fatality of US members in Iraq,

[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.600]
the 303rd and 3rd in hostile actions. 441. Now what number do we need to get to? A thousand,

[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:18.260]
two thousand before you people finally wake up and say, this is madness. This is lunacy. These people

[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:23.160]
are dying. Oh, freaking weapons of mass destruction. Not only were they not involved without

[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.680]
a kind of before, but now they are. And we've stood up the hornets' nest and now Iraq,

[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.800]
which before was nothing to worry about as far as terrorism was concerned. Now it's a hotbed of

[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.700]
terrorism and lunatics of fanatical groups and they're like coming from everywhere on the planet.

[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.340]
And we got Sirus, baby, in addition to which our people are dying every day for no reason at all.

[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.260]
I just mentioned that in passing. This in case anybody cares. You think most people care? No.

[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.240]
Unless it's somebody they know, unless it's a family member, a loved one, a friend, whatever.

[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.160]
They don't care. And that's why it's going on because the public doesn't care. Oh, but the economy

[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:58.360]
is going so good and the market is up again today. And Ted Davids out there since it's a good buying

[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.600]
opportunity. Yeah. See, if that's how self-esteem American people will come that they don't have any

[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.600]
value on human life of their own people, much less those poor bastards, Iraqis who were supposed to

[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:11.720]
be emancipating. What do I tell you? We emancipate by decapitation. We emancipate by elimination.

[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:16.700]
We're freeing them from life. And like my mother says, there ain't nothing like elimination.

[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:24.140]
All in case says, I'm often amused when I listen to your Miami bashing rhetoric. I guess in

[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:28.600]
part because I've always worn rose colored glasses. After hearing from my 10-year-olds son,

[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:31.700]
what happened in public school recently, I see where you're coming from. Well, I'm going to read

[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.620]
the rest of this after we come back from the break. Then that like me lead you right to the edge of your

[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:41.640]
seat. Nice teaser. Yeah, little teas. When in doubt, tease it out. Just like mom, maybe I'm always

[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:46.040]
busy teasing his piece before we couldn't come to work this. Absolutely. Yeah, we got a very

[00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:51.020]
screwed up schedule today. No mad dog, no Humper, Humper's in there for the gigantic breast reduction.

[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:57.540]
Yeah, I can't wait to get to report tomorrow. What do you, what do you, it looks like after it gets

[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.020]
all finished? Because I might just go for it, you know? Well, let me to buy you a card. You know

[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:06.260]
what they tell me it does? It puts an ocean in the basket. That's what I'm hearing. And there's

[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:13.080]
nothing like putting the lotion in your basket. That's what Pavell told me. Or on it. 27 past 10 at 560 WQAM.

[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.020]
It's the most wonderful time of the year. Who sings that? That's the one.

[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:22.540]
Jesus. Johnny Mathis. Was it the African queen? I know he's saying a lot of Christmas songs.

[00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:26.460]
Johnny Mathis sang it's the most wonderful. He had the most famous recording on that. I think

[00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:30.820]
Stephen Foster wrote it. Ding. Don't. Unless it's not so great if you hate to crowded

[00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:35.140]

[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.540]
the year every year. So make your gift giving a little bit easier this year for you and your

[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:16.140]
And proud of it. It's hard to be a Jew on Christmas. My friends call them each

[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:24.820]
on in any games. And I can't sing Christmas songs or decorate a Christmas tree or leave

[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:32.680]
water out for a root all cause there's something wrong with me. My people don't believe in Jesus Christ

[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:49.160]
is in a king. No. I'm a Jew, I'm only Jew on Christmas. Honoka is nice but why is it?

[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:58.540]
That's set up past over my house every year. And instead of eating and my house you

[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:06.640]
eat kosher like these. Instead of siren, I'd unsteady new hafto coffee. And what the

[00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:15.200]
f*** is up with lighting on these f***ing candles? Tell me please. I'm a Jew, I'm only Jew.

[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:23.700]
I can't be married cause I'm ebrew on Christmas.

[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.120]
Hey little boy I couldn't help but hear you feeling left out of Christmas cheer.

[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:42.900]
I've come to say that you shouldn't be sad. This is the one month that you should be glad.

[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.520]
Cause it's nice to be a Jew on Christmas.

[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.740]
Alright. You don't have to deal with the season.

[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:04.160]
Hello. You have to be on your best behavior or gifts of charity. You don't have to go to

[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:11.580]
Grandma's house with your alcoholic family. And I don't have to go to make Santa's class and have a

[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:25.000]
treat. That's on you. That's right. You're a Jew. I'm styling you. It's a good time to be a Jew.

[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.980]
Oi! Honkristen.

[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.240]
Yeah.

[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:49.840]
Oh I thought that he did something at the end of that. That's why I was waiting. Huh? No.

[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.600]
That's why the Merry Christmas era is something like that at the end. I'll be there.

[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:57.880]
Must have the wrong bit. I see. Well nonetheless we got to hear the end of that nice and clean.

[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.320]
1034 or 560. Getting back to Alan Kay's oboe before we do. Before we get back to the facts which I'll

[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.040]
read in its entirety. Cause it's very distressing and disturbing and typical.

[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.660]
Uh this poll is shaping up as a real barn burner. You know what? 78 votes real quick like.

[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.400]
And it is the last where I'll pull we'll ever take until the next one.

[00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:19.620]
If Scott fell on the air mornings on another station, how would that affect your listening?

[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:23.700]
78 votes. No change. Hadn't listened to QNB410A in any way. 38.

[00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:29.100]
I don't know if I phrased that right today. What do you mean? I don't know.

[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:34.260]
I listened to Pharrell not Moor Jo 20. I listened to Pharrell and Jo 17.

[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.700]
I'd still listen to Moor Jo rose three and I'd still listen to Moor but I don't listen to Jo

[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:45.700]
has got. Oh! Rhymes with Moor Jo the big O. Wow out of 78 votes.

[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:52.960]
That is just a barn burner right there now. You know yesterday he won the retire poll by a wide

[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.960]
margin over lyric King. Now maybe that was the deal this morning. Maybe we've always finally decided

[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:04.420]
in a rare act of decency to give everybody a break and retire and just stick with his

[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:08.360]
dolphin games and get out of everybody's face. You know just just take the mind of the bank

[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:16.520]
would be good. Sure. What? You don't think? No. I mean if I'm looking at especially if I had

[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.860]
a gigantic eagle like he does and I'm looking at this poll today if they put Pharrell on against him

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.040]
which is the rumor we're starting big time now actor. See if the poll result even though I don't

[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:32.560]
think it's going to happen. I'd still listen to Moor I don't listen to Jo 0. 0. It's just changing

[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:38.900]
again. Maybe he hopped on his computer. No he's still out of 91 votes. He's still got the big none.

[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.020]
Oh you want to know why? I was singing that song because I saw the biography show on Andy Williams

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:50.780]
a few days ago. Remember I told you? Yes. The most wonderful time in the

[00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.720]
year. I couldn't think of it but yeah. And the most wonderful time of your

[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.180]
career was sung by Andy Williams. It said I would listen to

[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.760]
this is a fabulous fact. Thank you so much for putting a smile on my post-todden Hollywood.

[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.920]
Chronic. PS I would listen to Conor Red before I listen to Moor.

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.340]
Absolutely.

[00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:18.420]
Listening to Conor Red is kind of like watching the test pattern. Same thing.

[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.660]
And of course you're not old enough to remember the test pattern. Sure hey,

[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:27.600]
Heather. What would you like to do? Remember the test pattern? Not first hand.

[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.220]
I'm back in eight days. It's television but there was only like two networks I think. I think like

[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:37.960]
CBS and Dumont I believe. I don't know. But at any rate some of us

[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.940]
networks didn't come on until I three, four in the afternoon until it was how

[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:43.900]
do you duty time when we kids got home from school you know we said how do you

[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:51.180]
do duty. And before that there was just that test pattern was on all day. Is that the one with the

[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:58.860]
engine on it? No. I saw the one with the engine. The Indian? Yeah. What one with the Indian?

[00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.500]
There was a test pattern with an engine head on it. Get out of here you're thinking of those Buffalo

[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:08.620]
head Nichols. Trust me. Anyway, Alan cases them often used when I listen to your Miami

[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:13.080]
bashing rhetoric. It's not rhetoric, Alan, as you're discovering. I guess in part because

[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:17.380]
I've always worn rose colored glasses. After hearing from my 10 year old son what happened

[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.700]
him in his public school recently I see where you're coming from. Yes, Toronto A.

[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.900]
Recently my son's class at a public school in Coral Gables was asked to write a short essay

[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:31.940]
other feelings about Christmas and presented to the class. My son who is Jewish.

[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.380]
Never less completed the assignment and during his presentation said among other things he did

[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:43.880]
not think Santa Claus was real. How revolutionary. With that the outrage teacher banished him from

[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:49.880]
the classroom and directed that he write an essay on his behavior. Thankfully my son stood firm

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:54.340]
refusing to believe that his statement about Santa with some high behavioral problem. In his essay

[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:57.980]
he wrote that he didn't think he should change his belief because that was the way he felt.

[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.380]
Since when in this day and age are children in public schools required to write a

[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:06.660]
and talk about Christmas and punish for stating their beliefs. Can you recommend a good place to

[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.580]
live in Toronto A. regards Alan K. Hey. Good luck Alan. See you at the border.

[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.600]
We'll get you in we'll get you past that Sarza thing. Sarza Gate. There's a similar story that I

[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.460]
would print up in fact to you but for some reason this computer hasn't been printing. Has him in

[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.780]
behaving right. Well I think it's the I don't know there's something wrong with the connection. I

[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:29.360]
think since you start looking for them Steven Foster songs and that the the camp town races came up

[00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:37.080]
if I'm like a shut down. But there was a similar story that that made the news saying one.

[00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:43.720]
Oh there's a vote for I'd still listen to Mo but I don't listen to Joe. One out of 122 go ahead.

[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:48.800]
Oh I'm waiting for it to come up because I can actually read it off of here it's short. About some

[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:55.100]
Jewish kid being uh having his boss. Broward County. Oh and Broward County. How many of the kids?

[00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:59.760]
You got to be kidding me mister. Broward County school officials have arranged for a visit from

[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.320]
Santa after a teacher told students he was not for real. School officials said that a teacher

[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:09.080]
a see at a see peri elementary was discussing childhood favorites like the two fairy with her

[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.020]
students when she was asked about Santa Claus and she told them don't be discussing fairies with

[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:19.880]
those kids teach he doesn't exist. The teacher has since received counseling and being more sensitive

[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:25.080]
to students. Broward officials made an emergency phone call and it have arranged for Santa to visit

[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:31.400]
the cath the cath the classroom on one day at 9 30 a.m. to help relieve the students concerns.

[00:34:32.100 --> 00:34:37.940]
This is a public school in Broward in Broward County right and they're bringing in a fake Santa

[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:42.440]
to bring us to students that is a Santa's for real and don't be so concerned and don't have

[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:46.560]
an overshmit and it's said to be so to set them up for a big letdown later and I'm glad you

[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.340]
reminded me of that because every year at this time I enthusiastically and emphatically announce

[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:54.340]
even other kids are in the school now but I announce very loudly and clearly hey kids if you're

[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:58.380]
listening if you're out sick today like more there's no Santa Claus it's a fairy tale it's not a lie

[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:05.260]
your parents told you it's like the god bull crap the two fairy Santa Claus God all of these things

[00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:09.080]
just lies that your parents made up because their parents told them lies before them

[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:14.400]
and don't stop perpetuating I think there's a public service on issue we deserve the honest

[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.820]
deserves better than more lies so while you 30 and 40 and 50 year olds out there I hate to

[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:22.660]
break the news to you there ain't no sandy claws okay there's plenty of fairies running around but

[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.520]
no sandy claws

[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.800]
don't you go back to Canada you do bastard the holiday season everyone loves Christmas

[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:41.600]
carols but until now no one has ever written holiday songs about that other big holiday this time

[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.780]
of year that's right I said until now introducing Panicca Carols on CD

[00:35:48.160 --> 00:36:04.620]
Panicca Carols on CD spins like a cradle as it gives you powers and hours of holiday music to get

[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:11.520]
you into the other spirit of the season on V-day's ray of carnivore my mother gave to me eight pounds

[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.800]
traditional song the holiday's here's the whole new tradition you'll get tired of almost before you know it you better buy gifts

[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:31.060]
again to my sale you know how we paint you pay retail

[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:40.500]
time that car is coming to town Panicca Carols on CD it's the holiday collection you just can't pass over

[00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:45.980]
and 45 at five sixty WQA and once Hanukkah start December 19th or something like that I believe

[00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:49.980]
and I could look at a calendar look behind you there Josh if you got one of them Jew calendars

[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:55.780]
on a wall back then look on the 19th there look at the art print and what does it say we're waiting begins

[00:36:55.780 --> 00:37:02.480]
at sundown like the 19th yes well it's even 19th is two weeks from tomorrow from a Friday right

[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:08.980]
5th 1219 twist from Friday at sundown on Shabbos no life oh Chanukkah now you're going to be

[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.400]
spinning your draodles I hope you know it eating canadels and spinning your draodles and

[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:19.640]
having sex with young maidels lighting them in the door panthers bid to refinance arena debt delayed

[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.800]
the brown County Commission yesterday referred until later date a request by the floor of Panthers

[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:31.340]
to refinance the debt on the office depot center in sunrise no reason was immediately given

[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:35.200]
why the matter was pushed back although I think the store we had yesterday should give you some

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:40.680]
pretty good ideas they've got some great preputation about that too the Panthers say we financing

[00:37:40.680 --> 00:37:43.540]
the arena's debt would provide the team in the county with an immediate one-time payment of

[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.900]
$12.6 million since they got a real cash flow problem over the evidently the team proposes

[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:54.340]
is keeping 60% or about 7.6 million, with a county receiving the remaining 40% however,

[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.180]
the county would contribute 1.9 million of that 5 million in chair for a re-name improvements

[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.160]
under the Panther Plan.

[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:03.640]
So in other words, the county gets pretty much squat like they're getting all along

[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.640]
anyway, and the Panthers would get the Lions chair.

[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.440]
Our shouldn't have said Lions chair.

[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:09.880]
Roy!

[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:15.140]
Broward County sold $184 million in bonds to fund construction of the Re-1996, and you know

[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:15.280]
what?

[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.180]
It was a bad idea.

[00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.460]
It's a beautiful building.

[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:20.460]
You ever been there?

[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:21.340]
Yeah.

[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.780]
You have for what?

[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:23.500]
Monster trucks.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.660]
See, there you go.

[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.620]
George goes there for the Monster trucks, and there's some concerts in there.

[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.740]
It's a beautiful building, but it was a bill of goods that they sold the public playing

[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:38.920]
on the euphoria of that big Panther Santa Cup final season that won glorious season in

[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.660]
the history of the franchise.

[00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:43.540]
By the way, how about them leaves some first place in the division and almost in first

[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:44.100]
in the conference?

[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.340]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.500]
Six wins in a row.

[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.900]
How do I have no idea?

[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.820]
Here's another chronic.

[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.800]
Can you please play the South Park Mary F. In Christmas song?

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:54.220]
Well, we'll do that in a one to two hour.

[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:54.720]
How about that?

[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:55.120]
A.

[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.500]
What about putting Carlos Arruca?

[00:38:58.780 --> 00:38:59.700]
No, his name is not Carlos.

[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.060]
It's Francisco Arruca.

[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:01.300]
See?

[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.180]
Or maybe this is a different one.

[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:04.440]
No, no, it's Francisco.

[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.000]
He's confused.

[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.640]
The Cuban Communist on the Maxi 790 Mornin's 8-9 on your list.

[00:39:08.800 --> 00:39:11.740]
I found myself listening to the little socialist bastard from time to time.

[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.800]
Says this chronic factor.

[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.540]
Francisco Arruca.

[00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.220]
See?

[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.300]
Have you ever heard him?

[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:22.180]
Yeah, he just rips the exiled community, the right wing exiled.

[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:22.920]
He's like him already.

[00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:24.160]
He just rips them constantly.

[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.640]
That's all he has.

[00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:27.120]
Francisco Arruca is the best radio show I am.

[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.740]
What time is he on?

[00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:29.900]
I don't know.

[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.780]
And he sounds like Ricky Ricardo, but his English is perfect.

[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.220]
Oh, so typical of these South Florida, no speaking English community, man.

[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.380]
Don't confuse them with the facts.

[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:40.820]
I don't know what time he's on, but he's really great.

[00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.360]
I've never heard his show, but he's really great.

[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.320]
And he had a Francisco Arruca.

[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.440]
If that bitch had heard his show, she wouldn't have been touting him.

[00:39:47.620 --> 00:39:48.640]
Yeah, well, you know what?

[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.340]
You know what he was probably too busy listening to?

[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.680]
I give up.

[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:52.920]
I'll give you a little hint.

[00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:53.340]
OK?

[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.340]

[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:54.460]
It's an 80.

[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.700]
It's an 80.

[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.240]
And when the lads say the lads, the lads are the lads.

[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:01.680]
All right.

[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.480]
I want to tell you what.

[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.060]
I want to tell you what.

[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:04.520]
I'm begging on TV.

[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.620]
I want to tell you what.

[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.500]
I want to tell you what.

[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.060]
Sweet.

[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:09.500]
Oh, and it's now official.

[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.720]
Senior Cruz was a guy.

[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.860]
It's just official.

[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.020]
I just got the word came in right across my table.

[00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:14.740]
I'm so redeemed.

[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.800]
170 votes on this poll today and things

[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.880]
ain't looking too good for Mona.

[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.080]
What are he down in the dumps?

[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:21.000]
You think of something we said?

[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.740]
Well, now, speaking of something, somebody said,

[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.000]
where have you got that Joe Rose thing?

[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.300]
Because I don't have it for me yesterday.

[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.400]
Oh, on me.

[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.580]
You got it on you?

[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.460]
Well, while I'm looking for it, thank you

[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:33.240]
to whoever faxed in the test pattern,

[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.120]
what the engine on it?

[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.060]
Like I kept trying to tell you.

[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.280]
Well, my test pattern, long before you were born,

[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.400]
didn't have no engine on it.

[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.420]
It just was like a round circle with things sticking out

[00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:43.800]
from it.

[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.420]
And it just, and that was it.

[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.720]
Maybe you just didn't notice the engine.

[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:47.680]
Howard from Boca.

[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:48.860]
Oh, wrong one.

[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.700]
One last thing we all like to.

[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.600]
Howard, don't let Barry Jackson and this stuff about your show

[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:56.180]
is not entertaining.

[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:57.080]
Get to you, man.

[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.520]
I hate seeing you making comments about it every day

[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:01.140]
on your show.

[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:02.640]
Let it go, man.

[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.120]
It's OK.

[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.980]
You don't have to go around calling Barry Jackson.

[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:06.580]
All right.

[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.780]
I know he's not listening because when he's off the air,

[00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.720]
he goes up to Boca and he's steady dead and listen anymore.

[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.420]
So it's OK.

[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.440]
It's OK.

[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.320]
I'm listening.

[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.000]
Uh oh.

[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:15.520]
OK.

[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.560]
I think you're in hot water now, Joe.

[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.780]
Anyway, 173 votes.

[00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:23.160]
If Sky for RL went on the air mornings on another station,

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.280]
how would that affect your listening?

[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.360]
No change.

[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.220]
How do I listen to QM before 10 AM anyhow?

[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:27.620]
74.

[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.740]
That's 42.7% of this audience.

[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:30.720]
Holy crap.

[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:33.320]
I listen to Forail and Joe Rose.

[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:33.920]
45.

[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:35.060]
Now that's pretty good.

[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.160]
They listen to Forail like from 6 to 8.

[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.180]
And then Joe Rose 8 to 10.

[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.320]
We'll take that right?

[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:39.920]
Sure.

[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:40.700]
What about that?

[00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:42.760]
I listen to Forail not Joe or Moe.

[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.720]
Either one of them 39.

[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:44.480]
We don't like that.

[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:47.340]
I still listen to Moe and Joe Rose 12.

[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.980]
In other words, they'd stick with us all away from 5 and AM

[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.640]
to 10.

[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:52.360]
And I still listen to Moe.

[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.860]
I don't listen to Joe three.

[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.360]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:55.980]
Three.

[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.720]
That's 1.7%.

[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.640]
So you got one.

[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:00.380]
Rich 173 votes.

[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:00.800]
One.

[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:03.760]
Paul De Nguyenland Patriot guy, which I'm embarrassed about that.

[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:04.880]
And who's the other one?

[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.440]
Oh, it's Stuttering Steve, the Marlin guy.

[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.180]
And then of course Richie from Bore's head.

[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.000]
Although they listen all day long because they're chronic.

[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:12.420]
Mark the Jets fan.

[00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.720]
And a bunch of other goiim.

[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.360]
And anyway, that's a deal.

[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.320]
It's not looking to do promising.

[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.480]
And maybe some people in the audience have got some more scuttle

[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.800]
about what's going to be on 9.40.

[00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:24.040]
Not that anybody cared until this day because Carl Foster

[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.120]
was on her singing Dixie or whatever he was singing for my old

[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:27.780]
Kentucky home.

[00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:31.660]
But once he lost his internet gambling, his offshore gambling

[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.180]
deals, he just ran out of business and he couldn't afford to

[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.800]
keep that thing going.

[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.360]
I guess that's what I'm hearing.

[00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:36.980]
That's alleged.

[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.860]
I don't want to say that is fact because we hear a lot of crap.

[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:43.900]
But I have that from a pretty good inside source.

[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.940]
Here is something really shocking.

[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.660]
But before we do it, better take a call or two because they

[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.940]
might have the information we're looking for.

[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:51.760]
WQM rumor line.

[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:52.920]
You son of a bitch.

[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:54.400]
Nah, nah, nah, nah.

[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.860]
And I must have been the teacher from that guy's kid and

[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:57.260]
Carl Gables.

[00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.320]
WQM.

[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.220]
They had you doing get a star report.

[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:01.920]
OK?

[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.040]
You're wrong, please.

[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:05.320]
Speaking.

[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:07.400]
Woody.

[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:13.760]
If he could, but he can't say what he killed.

[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.500]
What if he had the chance if he could?

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.500]
Now, how do you like that?

[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.040]
And you're telling me what were you saying about him?

[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:19.780]
I thought he was wrong.

[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.360]
I thought he was a crap.

[00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.800]
He's much see Reverend Jones on occasion is amusing, even

[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.720]
though you can't stand him.

[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.220]
He on occasion is somewhat amusing.

[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.160]
All right.

[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:29.280]
He is.

[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:29.720]
OK.

[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.080]
Even though he overdoses it by a mile, when he says, you're

[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.880]
I mean, that's kind of right in itself as a.

[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.180]
Woody has never made a call that was interesting, amusing,

[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.220]
desired, anything.

[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.040]
And all the years that I've been doing this, 100 years I've

[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:42.660]
been doing this crap.

[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:44.400]
He's just an asshole.

[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:44.920]
That's all.

[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.820]
So you never saw him.

[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.220]
I did.

[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.460]
Remember when we were doing, of course, taking up that

[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:50.380]
asshole's parking spot?

[00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:51.380]
But what's funny is he's funny.

[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.120]
One day I'm driving out of there at 2 o'clock.

[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.160]
And here comes this car around a corner.

[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:56.640]
And he rolls down the window.

[00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:59.020]
And I, oh, hi, me.

[00:43:59.220 --> 00:43:59.580]
Woody.

[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:00.040]
Woody.

[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.180]
It's Woody.

[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.480]
And as much of an asshole as he is on a phone, that's

[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.020]
exactly what he is in person.

[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.740]
What you see is what you get.

[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.120]
Major, major asshole.

[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.160]
And right now he's squeezing himself because I'm talking

[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.500]
about him and you're responsible for that.

[00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.260]
So nice going, George.

[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.320]
Panelist Indian baby born in Bethlehem draws crowds.

[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:22.780]
But before we get that story, this goes to show you all

[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.740]
you religion is out there, especially at this time of

[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:24.820]
the year.

[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:26.440]
It's a good time to be passing along this message.

[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:28.020]
What a pile of crap it all is.

[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.680]
And fairy tales and silly garbage.

[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.720]
And people all over the world are killing each other because

[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:32.260]
of it.

[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.660]
Did you see in India again in Kashmir and

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:36.080]
Kashmir and Taukhas there in Kashmir?

[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:38.660]
They had another big incident just a couple of days ago.

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.020]
The Hindus and the, who is it?

[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:41.000]
The Muslims?

[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.420]
It can only be.

[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:43.140]
Yeah.

[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:47.200]
The Hindus and the Muslim Muslims were like killing each

[00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:50.580]
other because they just can't get their stories straight.

[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.980]
A baby born in Bethlehem is drawn crowds by the thousands,

[00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.700]
even more than at Rosalope's house.

[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:00.660]
Palestinians in West Bank town revered by Christians as

[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:04.020]
Jesus' birthplace had been thronged a little

[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.280]
town of Bethlehem.

[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:06.180]
That's Johnny Matriss.

[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.260]
He sings that to in any way.

[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:08.200]
All the going.

[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:11.820]
Revered by Christian as Jesus' birthplace had been

[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.580]
thronged into the adjacent Aida.

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.740]
Aida refugee camp for a glimpse of the 11-day

[00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.940]
old infant, many are calling a miracle baby.

[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:19.560]
Oh my God.

[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:20.020]
Wow.

[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.640]
The boys gained attention from being born with a large

[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:26.080]
birthmark across his cheek that roughly forms an

[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.660]
Arabic letters, the name of his uncle, Allah, a

[00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.940]
Hamas militant killed by his ready troops after he was led

[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.280]
to a plan to suicide bombing.

[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:36.460]
The family devout Muslims called it a divine message of

[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.880]
support for the Palestinians against Israel, though

[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.220]
some local Christians preparing for a subdued

[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:42.480]
Christmas observance have quietly

[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.860]
dismissed as laughing any religious significance.

[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.640]
Yeah, these are probably the same people that are

[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:49.580]
squeezing the shroud of Turin and are running a

[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.020]
shlup and over to see that burial box would

[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.380]
geogimmy Christ in it.

[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:54.880]
When I was in Jimmy Christ.

[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:55.280]
That's right.

[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.500]
Jimmy Christ, are you back again?

[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.580]
The Israel just doesn't have the same impact, you know?

[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.540]
Jesus Christ, are you calling again?

[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.340]
Jimmy Christ, it leaves you limp, you know?

[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.140]
And Brad Pitt still wants to know what's in it.

[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:11.360]
The Israeli army declined comment, but one

[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.280]
security source said it sounds very freaky.

[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:14.820]
The family denied any hoax.

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:15.720]
Wow.

[00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.560]
The security source said the baby's uncle was shocked

[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.460]
at eight months ago with suspected of masterminding

[00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:22.600]
a bombing that killed 12 people on a Jerusalem bus

[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:25.660]
in November 2002, cradling the baby in her arms,

[00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.960]
the infant's grandmother, Aisha Ayad, 58, said her son

[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:31.360]
secretly joined the Islamic group Hamas, shortly

[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.900]
after he was beaten by Israeli soldiers.

[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.480]
She said the birthmark was assigned the soldiers

[00:46:35.480 --> 00:46:37.400]
can kill our sons, but not our spirit.

[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:40.040]
Remember spirit, I got a sign on you.

[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:40.920]
Yep.

[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.000]
On your face.

[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:45.280]
Oh, I got a line on well, whatever line across your

[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:45.520]
post.

[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.720]
He voiced hope Israelis and Palestinians would make peace

[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.980]
and allow her grandson to grow free from violence.

[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.760]
As she spoke, as she spoke, I guess that road map

[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.000]
is still a little rocky and Israeli army patrol

[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.160]
fire tear gas that stone throwing youths nearby.

[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.400]
Just kind of like in a background.

[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:01.040]

[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.660]
Now makes good footage on nightly news.

[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:08.300]
We're five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T

[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.120]
in Verizon wireless line.

[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:13.060]
So all about your fairy tales, all your kids out there.

[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:15.080]
OK, don't listen to all those lies.

[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.220]
A lot of people who lie.

[00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:19.080]
The day we share it in an important accomplishment.

[00:47:19.240 --> 00:47:21.720]
There's another one chronic liar, even worse than Greg

[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:22.120]
Reed.

[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:24.780]
WDQ I am.

[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:26.960]
Oh, hello.

[00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:27.820]
Yes, sir.

[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.880]
I was looking at the old chronic.

[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:30.360]

[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:42.980]
Oh, man.

[00:47:43.980 --> 00:47:46.200]
Oh, I just want to sit and hold my head.

[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:47.280]
I'm sitting in my hands and cry.

[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.180]
Sit and hold it.

[00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.540]
I told you at least he's amusing at times.

[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.340]
In a bizarre way, I like him.

[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.180]
OK, you remember in the hitcher that thing with Rucker

[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.960]
Howard and C. Thomas L and it was like something going on

[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:00.160]
there.

[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.640]
Mm-hmm.

[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:05.700]
Reverend Jones, it's the same thing.

[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.560]
I'd like to wipe the smile off his face.

[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:08.800]
You're like with a baseball band.

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:13.220]
I know this is for 2020.

[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:15.180]
QAM.

[00:48:17.160 --> 00:48:19.320]
Riddians, dumb ass girls.

[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:23.140]
This ex-mus, you don't want to offend anybody

[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.640]
on your holiday gift list.

[00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.900]
Give them the new politically correct

[00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:29.920]
non-denominational holiday record.

[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:33.360]
We wish you a merry non-denominational celebration.

[00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:36.920]
We wish you a merry non-denominational celebration.

[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.760]
We wish you a merry non-denominational celebration.

[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.160]
And a happy change of the calendar.

[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.100]
Who could possibly take issue with songs like these?

[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.360]
I'm dreaming of all the wise, my kid is in love.

[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.420]
Yes, we've taken the unomorrow out of Christmas.

[00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.680]
We're terribly in a rush, oh, we're terribly in a rush.

[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.700]
Make everybody happy.

[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:07.280]
Get your copy of the non-denominational holiday record today.

[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.140]
I'm never happy killing the blind.

[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.020]
Oh, right.

[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:11.960]
Well, I don't know what I want.

[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:13.360]
It's 560 WQM.

[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.040]
Now we're getting some people going to the internet

[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:16.880]
and getting pictures of these test patterns.

[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.860]
Who can believe that we get so much respost about test patterns?

[00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:20.260]
Not me.

[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.180]
Now here's the one from KTWU in Topeka.

[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.420]
And this one has your Indian on it, right?

[00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:27.280]
He got a man of 11 in Topeka.

[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.580]
But my test pattern, I'm telling you,

[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.580]
is more like this other one, the WHM and Rochester.

[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.180]
Channel 6, you notice there's no Indian on it.

[00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.840]
The only Indian on it was Chief Thunder Thought,

[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.260]
who used to be on Howdy Doody.

[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.440]
Do you remember Chief Thunder Thought?

[00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:40.940]
No.

[00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.800]
And Princess Summer Fall Winter Spring and Mr. Bluster?

[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:44.180]
No.

[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.440]
And Dayton Allen?

[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.380]
Why not?

[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.220]
Boka Brian does.

[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.620]
Because he's an old far like me.

[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.180]
Anyway, WHM TV, Channel 6 and Rochester,

[00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:53.860]
a Stromberg Carlson company.

[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.840]
I bet you never had a Stromberg Carlson TV.

[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:56.840]
No.

[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:57.960]
Well, you're lucky.

[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.480]
I've told you this before, but it's worth,

[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.660]
oh, and here's another one.

[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:04.540]
WTVJ Miami.

[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:05.200]
Right.

[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.640]
And it's got like a railroad crossing thing on it.

[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:09.560]
Stop, look and listen.

[00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:10.180]
That's cute.

[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.480]
WTVJ, first, mine is kind of dark.

[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:15.520]
Mine is flurid.

[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.060]
And there's no Indian on it.

[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:17.620]
No.

[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:18.800]
But there's a poem, three.

[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.120]
Channel 4, it is like a very bad looking palm tree.

[00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.160]
And then there's the railroad crossing signal there.

[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.200]
Stop, look and listen.

[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.120]
WTVJ, of course, used to be Channel 4,

[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.300]
and then it became Channel 6.

[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.520]
And Channel 4 became WFOR for why we don't know,

[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.740]
for some reason.

[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:36.900]
Just bizarre.

[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.360]
So anyway, that's the deal there with the test pattern.

[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:42.760]
One of them had the engine and everyone's did not have.

[00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:44.240]
Right.

[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.460]
And probably the guy in Rochester

[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.540]
who put together that test pattern, he was probably a...

[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.020]
So that's why I wasn't on the test pattern.

[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.100]
pound 5, 60 on EAT and T in Verizon Wireless Lime.

[00:50:58.100 --> 00:51:00.220]
And when you see the results of this pull man, you're going to schmit.

[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.460]
You're going to drop gigantic loads all over that chair.

[00:51:06.320 --> 00:51:09.300]
If Scott Furell went on the year mornings out in other station in town,

[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.260]
which there's a lot of people spreading rumors about that,

[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.560]
but we're finding out it's highly unlikely,

[00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:13.820]
how would that affect your listening?

[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.380]
221 vote.

[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.400]
No change.

[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.500]
I don't listen to QM before 10am, any house?

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:21.920]
98, 44.3%.

[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.300]
44.3% of the Nearoges audience says,

[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:27.760]
we don't listen to QM before 10am, morning anyway.

[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.900]
That is... that's scandalous, isn't it?

[00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:31.020]
No.

[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:32.900]
Now do you remember when Furell was doing...

[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.940]
And I'm not not good joke, because Joe is the man, you know?

[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:36.980]
Joe Rose, who's thinking he made to a permanent, maybe not,

[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.580]
and him and Geltie, and give it to somebody.

[00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.840]
But at any rate, that's a quedend indictment,

[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.080]
because remember we took the pull when Furell was on?

[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:44.500]
Mm-hmm.

[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:45.960]
And it was a much smaller number.

[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.700]
But nevertheless, I listened to Furell and Joe,

[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:53.800]
which will take half a loaf as better than on 57,

[00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:57.160]
I listened to Furell, not Mo or Joe 51.

[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.480]
21.6%.

[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:00.680]
A precipitous decline I think would occur.

[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.660]
I still listen to Mo and Joe Rose 16.

[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.560]
16 would forego the pleasure of hearing,

[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.600]
wa-ha-ha-ha-ha-la-ha-ha-ha-ha-da....

[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.040]
Big, rag, big, rag, big D...

[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.880]
Our friend Furell, most former friend.

[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.960]
And I'd still listen to Mo, I don't listen to Joe four.

[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:16.620]
One...

[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:20.160]
1.6% out of 236%.

[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:21.740]
You think it was something we said.

[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.020]
You keep...

[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.120]
5.670560.

[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:29.780]
the pound five sixty on the eighteen to the sun is shining here man it is

[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.840]
toasty and throughout all

[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.340]
for you people want to get out of south Florida with all his nasty hateful

[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:35.020]
angry people

[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:39.500]
it's already a toasty minus five Celsius and going up to a high of minus one

[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:40.360]
today you know what that is

[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.000]
with a sunny and no snow no rain no craps is nice sunny and crisp

[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:48.940]

[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:07.320]
right the same song well how come that was enlisted on that the thing that i

[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.700]
read their own the internet

[00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:11.360]
that got me it should be a bit of that

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:13.340]
the parentheses that they're also known as

[00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:14.840]

yep thanks palie

[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.300]

the world's biggest turkey goes and visits direct

[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:25.360]

yet it were uh... i don't want to go back to that thing again okay just so it's

[00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.800]
nauseating the fact that anybody buys into that i mean such an obviously

[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.660]
staged event just like him a race you have not even been politically partisan

[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:40.620]

[00:53:44.580 --> 00:53:48.420]
i still say that tells us that uh... they're crap in their pants about her

[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:53.140]
uh... seriously right i know that we both have difficulty understand why but

[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:54.380]
she's the dark horse man

[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:58.580]
she's got a just like a print sources about uh... what's your name what is her

[00:53:58.580 --> 00:53:59.080]

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.300]
parker bowls

[00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:02.600]
apart her goals

[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.880]
he worked out and she goals but that she does well mean game she probably has

[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:09.060]
about a two thirty average

[00:54:10.760 --> 00:54:12.960]
but anyway a hillary she just uh... you know

[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.960]
they got upstays there by the bush might because she's got the brainers

[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:19.180]
so he had a like a way and now they're saying that the british airways thing

[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.460]
that was all made up there's no

[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.920]
uh... british airways investigated unless the guys just absolutely terrified

[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:27.200]
not their pilots confirms any of that about spotting your first right

[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.320]
that's pretty those rivers or about the conversation any of these things

[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.100]
that that our government would like to us we know that

[00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:38.320]

[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.440]
and jesus and abberhan and moses and no hard day but it looks like that

[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.680]
ancient things like that

[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:50.160]

so he's and he's done some very nice things for me to know he probably didn't

[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:16.540]
intend to

[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.840]

now what were to come from

[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:34.020]
all right sitting here looking at the view it's just a beautiful uh... you know

[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.180]
life is more than weather boys and girls i'll tell you that two things right

life is more than just a goddamn weather

[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.140]
like some famous philosopher i think it was uh...

[01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:47.260]
Henry Theroux once said

[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.160]
the great poet

[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.480]
he said if it's uh... good i know it

[01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:53.220]
what did he say

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:54.700]
no so a confucius said

[01:07:54.700 --> 01:07:58.360]
he said there's no such thing as whether that's too cold or people who are under

[01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:58.780]
dressed

[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.220]
was it something like that

[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.000]
did he say that

[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.380]
i thought it was out for a while

[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.300]
no is bob weaver

[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:10.180]
below our few excerpt from a terrific uk side by darren meldram t-need

[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.600]
test patterns from around the world

[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:14.560]
they're inside includes test patterns from the bbc

[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.020]
and you see if you were a right right here right now you could turn on your

[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:18.840]
original cable

[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:21.860]
and they were difficult is a transport for players

[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:27.540]
the future is already looking right for iraq ranked number fifty two in the

[01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:30.960]
world they've already been sincere and maroqo on their way to live in the

[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:33.040]
prince up the look up in south arabia

[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.820]
he had it like that things are going well the soccer team in a rack there's the

[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:38.000]
bbc for your right there you want it you got it

[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:38.580]
not amazing

[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:40.760]
after we wanted to see that

[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.080]
uh... probably the most famous american black and white test pattern like i

[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.760]
told you was the so-called indian head monoscope pattern

[01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:51.860]
and it shows it right there with the i-c-i never saw that i don't know maybe i

[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:53.020]
did but how do i know

[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.800]
i don't know that pattern was originated by rc a nineteen thirty nine it was

[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.860]
designed to be generated using a special tube called a monoscope

[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:02.580]
a c-r-t which had a metal plate target

[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.800]
on which the pattern was printed same that'll play the dot zimmer's got in

[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:06.260]
his head now

[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.760]
the black lines of the pattern would interrupt current flow as the pattern was

[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.360]
scanned to provide the desired video output

[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.880]
these tubes can handle only black and white no shades of gray

[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:19.200]
hence they had to be simulated either with a half-tone dot pattern or patterns of

[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.220]
fine lines

[01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:24.200]
the nbc test pattern is dated nineteen forty seven but actually dates back to

[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:24.660]
forty one

[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:28.740]
when commercial tv broadcast began in america nineteen forty one

[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.040]
and we didn't get our first tb said because i was important nineteen forty one

[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.180]
uh... our first tb until a nineteen fifty two i believe

[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.900]
and i never did tell you about the stromba cross and with a horizontal

[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:39.880]
that would be a whole

[01:09:42.140 --> 01:09:44.760]
was either a stromba cross and a rwesting house

[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:49.480]
and then it was a nice piece of furniture with beautiful wooden cabinet and

[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:53.580]
you would lift the the tv screen up out of the air cavity on the sand

[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:57.180]
you would lift uh... with like a little handle and you looked at the proper

[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:58.140]
up you can't and

[01:09:58.140 --> 01:09:59.260]

because i had my gun under the pillow when i found the roof i heard something

[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:32.100]
thorn Christopher was here and he brought the loot as i drew out my gun and hid by the bed

[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:35.540]

marry friggin christmas the world and your butter show some respect

[01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:00.120]
let me thirty one twenty nine till note at five sixty w two and so here's this story

[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.480]
uh german i'll read the whole thing in germans have been both repulsed and irresistibly

[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.180]
attracted by the story of arman news this country's first recorded cannibal ever since the news

[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:14.660]
broke out about his unique and bizarre alleged crime and the seven in the media is increased

[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:18.500]
in the final days leading up to the trial which was supposed to start today and seen as how it's

[01:16:18.500 --> 01:16:22.540]
4.30 in the afternoon it's probably going on right now perhaps the biggest scoop uh

[01:16:22.540 --> 01:16:28.860]
fell to develop on the sundaeg the world on sunday i see a newspaper which incredibly

[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:33.160]
claimed to have gained an interview with mr muas himself i have intense and positive memories

[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:36.680]
of burned the victim he was quoted as saying by the paper i guess mr burned got burned

[01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.700]
and i don't need to have anyone else inside me he said huh

[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:42.440]
i

[01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.340]
welcome i see in a further spine chilling comment

[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:51.440]
he was said is saying i have his face permanently before me that's the sign of a friendly

[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:55.860]
relationship the paper also reported that he received many visitors and went for a walk an hour

[01:16:55.860 --> 01:17:00.080]
a day as he waited his judgment meanwhile a german tv station ran an interview with his former

[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.380]
girlfriend of the the former girlfriend of the victim who said he had no inkling of his wish

[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:10.880]
to be eaten i thought most guys wanted to be eaten right we had a normal sex life she said well

[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:15.180]
burned would never have allowed himself to be killed it was murder she said

[01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:19.260]
art their criteria one of germanese leading criminal psychologist already has an

[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.820]
explanation for the way for ventures in the case we thought there was a strong taboo against

[01:17:22.820 --> 01:17:27.420]
cannibalism it was reality in tribes and former stages of human development he says but what we'd

[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:33.400]
seen is that this taboo is weaker than we thought the case is also grabbed attention because

[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:37.100]
of the legal difficulties in encompasses cannibalism is not on the german law books and the

[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:41.780]
apparent willingness of the victim to die is an added complication the defenses line will be

[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:46.020]
that the victim wanted to be treated like this that it was his own wish to be killed says berlin

[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.760]
lawyer philis hardenberg therefore they'll try to get the defendant a lighter sentence a maximum

[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:54.380]
of five years without the chance with the chance that he'll be let out after three years probation

[01:17:54.380 --> 01:18:00.060]
so we can have a few more good meals of course the prosecution will argue that mr. mues deserves

[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:03.400]
a life sentence on the grounds that he's just too dangerous ever to be released kind of a

[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.100]
lector and Jeffrey don't see him no more and anything less would certainly cause a huge scandal

[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.700]
so the case is being closely watched the courtroom packed with journalists they're packinan

[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:18.020]
among the highlights will be the two-hour video that mr. mues took the whole thing of uh oh jeez

[01:18:18.020 --> 01:18:23.240]
took her the whole thing on his cancorder the public probably won't be excluded from this part of

[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:27.560]
the proceedings we have a tradition of open trials as mr. hard on burger but the panel of judges

[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:33.860]
will only show the relevant parts you know like legs thighs nuts what the victim is saying in

[01:18:33.860 --> 01:18:38.480]
doing before and during the killing mr. mues has said that after his trial he intends to pass the

[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:43.000]
time in jail if convicted or writing his memoirs judging by the interest in his grizzly case that

[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:47.720]
it's provoked here that could turn out to be a best seller all right how do you like that time for lunch

[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:32.660]

[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:36.720]
audience so they thought it was a courageous act of bolster troop morale and of course we don't

[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.200]
have no 22% of bush supporters in this audience so that goes to show you some of the unsuspecting

[01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:46.660]
morons out there who we thought were really on to him and all a bull crap other it's 20% of people

[01:23:33.020 --> 01:23:41.120]
the farting up into a wind storm there's absolutely no reason for anybody to be dying over

[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.960]
there and it's not part of the war on terror it has nothing to do with terrorism except for the

[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.820]
fact that it's not a fanning and spawning it but the other night it's got nothing to do with the

[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:54.120]
war on terror and he keeps saying that and because he keeps saying it a lot of war on's out there

[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.460]
feel that that makes it so just like oh it's autumn i had something to do with nine eleven

[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:03.240]
no he didn't oh yeah but i heard that i heard it i never shade it and then of course don't

[01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.380]
forget that uh you know all those meetings in Prague and all those hanky-panky with al-Qaeda and

[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:16.080]
and the raki's never happened but yeah well why bang your head against the wall there's nothing

[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:19.840]
you can do you dealing with a lot of uneducated idiotic people who have no idea where a raki's on

[01:24:19.840 --> 01:24:24.920]
they haven't got a freaking clue politically partisan right wingers so all they care about is

[01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:28.400]
their damn fetuses and their bullcrap and gay bashing that's about all they know

[01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:31.540]
well what what's not to like you know what i'm saying that's it

[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:37.360]
appealing to that base of the end of thaws in oklahoma and texas and arkansas and uh

[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:44.780]
arizona and utah and yoming and nabrasca and north dakota at south dakota and north korelana at south

[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.960]
korelana and georgia and alabama and mysticpy and florida

[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:55.420]
have you anybody out? love that covers it i think virginia

[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:59.500]
why what's the little this is for real by sicky?

[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:01.340]
with our virginia.

[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:01.900]
a

[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:17.360]
I used to think that I could not be home.

[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:26.160]
I'd say we're key quiet because I'm a star.

[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:33.320]
And now the years are fast for copying fields.

[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:42.700]
As long as grass is on the plate, you can feel it.

[01:25:42.700 --> 01:25:49.560]
And if I can see it, then I can do it.

[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:57.720]
If I just believe it, then there are my jaw hairs.

[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.420]
I'm a big pedophile.

[01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.360]
I believe I can touch my thigh.

[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:09.660]
You can see it on video tape.

[01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.560]
Don't give a more than try to rage.

[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:17.820]
If a parent's come home.

[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:21.260]
You've seen me running through that open door.

[01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:24.440]
I'm a big pedophile.

[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:25.960]
Yes.

[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.380]
That's a movie.

[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.120]
I'm a big pedophile.

[01:26:33.620 --> 01:26:35.640]
I have a attorney's defending R&B star.

[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.520]
Our Kelly gets child pornography charges.

[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:43.460]
It's filed a host of motions, including one containing the alleged victim could have been old enough to legally consent to sex.

[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.800]
Also included in the 11 motions.

[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.700]
Kelly's attorney filed Monday and Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago.

[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:55.120]
It was the argument that the case should be dismissed because prosecutors fail to specify the date of the alleged crime in their indictment against Kelly 36.

[01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:56.960]
Kelly's first name is Robert.

[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:04.500]
Was arrested in June 2002 after a videotape surface that allegedly showed the Grammy having sex with a girl, the Grammy Weenner.

[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:09.980]
By alleging that the illegal acts happened between November 97 and February 2002, Kelly's attorney's argue.

[01:27:10.340 --> 01:27:12.720]
The girl could be anywhere from 13 to 17 years old.

[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:16.540]
If she was 17 at the time, she'd have been old enough to consent to sex.

[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.200]
All right.

[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:22.920]
Further they argue, such a large window of time makes it impossible for Kelly to mount a fair defense.

[01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:35.740]
It's no secret that Mr. Kelly's well-known musician who frequently travels the motion says by failing to narrow the date that charged of the charged defense, Mr. Kelly is wholly deprived of the opportunity to bring an alibi defense.

[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:39.720]
I think that's supposed to say the charged offense, but what does ABC News know?

[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.880]
The attorney's also raised questions about the law that allows the four men to have sex with girl 17 older, but illegal the videotape, such acts with girl 17 and younger.

[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:54.820]
It is a logical irrational and disproportionate subject to a criminal conviction for taking pictures of conduct that does not otherwise violate the law.

[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.200]
They said, you know what that tells me?

[01:27:56.660 --> 01:27:56.800]
What?

[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.900]
He did it.

[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:58.800]
Of course he did.

[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:06.680]
Defense attorney Edward Genson said he could argue the motion is early as Kelly's next schedule, Court of Parents, February 6th, prosecutors would come in any of the motions.

[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:09.680]
Ready for that?

[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:12.200]
I think it was the mother and child reunion.

[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.680]
That was the motion that they were talking about.

[01:28:16.180 --> 01:28:17.580]
What is this thing you just facts?

[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:23.660]
The US military house gay conelinguists, in case you missed it, and I didn't fact you all ate pages like they did to us.

[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:29.800]
Kathleen Glover was cleaning the pool at the Sri Lankan Ambassador's residence recently, which you heard the sound of Arabic drifting through the trees.

[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.960]
Glover earned $11 an hour working for a pool maintenance company, skimming leaves and testing chlorine levels in the backyards of Washington.

[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:40.400]
No one knew about her past, but sometimes the past found her, and that's all you fact.

[01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.980]
Don't tell policy needs to outstair Arabic speakers.

[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.960]
This is a today's story, but this has been going on all along.

[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.320]
There have been several of these.

[01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:59.780]
So in other words, as soon as they find out that even though they have this desperate, desperate need of Arabic speaking interpreters, if it comes out to find out that they're fag,

[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:00.660]
well, bye bye.

[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:01.180]
Right.

[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:02.800]
When a dad were going to kick you ass out.

[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:06.420]
So it's obvious that the security of America is really what's important.

[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:08.680]
And by the way, Gilbert, we're going to put your ass in jail for the holidays.

[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:11.460]
Ooh, can I help you asshole?

[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:14.140]
You simple didn't you misfit you disgusting piece of crap?

[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:18.160]
Iraqi council head demands direct vote.

[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:28.420]
The head of the Iraqi government council renewed his demand today that a proposed traditional transitional legislature be elected by Iraqi voters, a move opposed by US occupation officials.

[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:31.560]
Abdel Aziz al-Hakim on before.

[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:32.980]
Oh, you know something?

[01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:33.980]
No, I know nothing.

[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:34.840]
You know what I forgot before?

[01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:35.480]
I gave up.

[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.640]
And I already smit candid.

[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:41.420]
Uh oh, because it was part of the story about the latest US soldier that got killed yesterday.

[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.300]
Later on, it told about the fact that Saddam's right hand man, we were here in all those breathless stories yesterday.

[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.660]
He was either dead or alive or killed or not killed or encusted or not.

[01:29:51.860 --> 01:29:52.880]
Well, it was all a bunch of bull crap.

[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:55.200]
Nothing to it.

[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:56.220]
Absolutely untrue.

[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:02.720]
And they put that like a little teeny tiny letters on the whatever the wire service story was, which is why I missed it.

[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:16.980]
Anyway, Abdel Aziz al-Hakim, a Shiite Muslim clerical recently has been a vocal critic of American plans for restoring sovereignty of Iraqis, holds the rotating presidency of the US appointed council for the month of December, his assumption of the post could point to rockier relations with American administrators.

[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.800]
It also highlights the transformation of Iraq since the fall of Saddam.

[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.940]
Iraq's Shiite majority were pressed under Saddam's regime, particularly religious leaders.

[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:31.320]
Al-Hakim holds clerical status unlike Afmai Chalabi, the secular Shiite, who held the presidency earlier this year.

[01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:40.760]
On November 15, agreement between the council and Paul Bremmer, the chief US administrator, calls for caucuses in Iraq's 18 provinces to select the transitional legislature.

[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:45.720]
But Al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, has insisted on a vote.

[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.160]
The assembly will be elected by the Iraqi people, he said.

[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.780]
This is what we're trying to achieve and that was God willing will happen, he said today.

[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:56.600]
So the conditions continue being rockier and rockier.

[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.680]
Like I said before, we shouldn't be there in the first place, you got no business being there, absolutely none.

[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.300]
The only people that have business are Bechtel, Halaburtin and Nosgoem and Chevron.

[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:07.540]
It was grave robbers.

[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:14.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.100]
If Scott were on the year mornings on another station, how would that alter your listening?

[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:23.380]
46 for 45.2% say no change out of listen to QM before 10 AM.

[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:25.200]
165 out of 365.

[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:27.920]
I'd listen to Furell and Joe Rose 82.

[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.900]
I'd listen to Furell but not Moor Joe 80.

[01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.460]
I'd still listen to Mo and Joe Rose 33 to vote him.

[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.720]
I'd still listen to Mo but I don't listen to Joe 5.

[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.200]
1.3% 5 out of 365.

[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:42.660]
He sure got that big exclusive QM there, don't he?

[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:43.400]
Yeah.

[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.400]
5.

[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:46.740]
So far.

[01:31:47.060 --> 01:31:48.060]
But it's a loyal 5.

[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:49.020]
That is correct.

[01:31:50.060 --> 01:31:50.500]
WQAM.

[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:52.020]
Hello.

[01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:52.880]
Yes.

[01:31:53.200 --> 01:31:54.000]
Hi, good morning.

[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:58.620]
Do you know if Furell is coming back in any other station for a fact or maybe?

[01:31:59.020 --> 01:31:59.920]
Are you listening to the show?

[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:00.740]
Yeah.

[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.280]
And what did I say?

[01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.540]
But you don't know if he's coming back or not.

[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.140]
Right.

[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:07.960]
Okay.

[01:32:08.180 --> 01:32:08.820]
I thought you knew.

[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:09.820]
Okay.

[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:10.540]
I don't know.

[01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:11.420]
You don't know?

[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:12.220]
No.

[01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:12.920]
I don't know.

[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:14.380]
I don't know.

[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:17.140]
Have you ever read that?

[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.580]
I was to hit your meters.

[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:20.080]
Wow.

[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:20.680]
Do you know?

[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:21.780]
Yeah.

[01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:24.260]
5.670560.

[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:27.780]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:29.300]
We're doing a little screenless here through the end of the year.

[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:29.820]
It's the holidays.

[01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:30.420]
Let's face it.

[01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:32.500]
We're just all faking our way through evidently.

[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:35.220]
I thought that was over as of this week but evidently not.

[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:35.640]
Surprise.

[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.600]
I thought that yesterday we kind of reached that turning point.

[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:44.040]
After Monday the day after Thanksgiving weekend people put their lives back together again.

[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:45.960]
I thought yesterday we kind of like turned a corner.

[01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:46.780]
Did we turn it?

[01:32:46.900 --> 01:32:47.060]
No.

[01:32:47.060 --> 01:32:47.380]
No.

[01:32:47.560 --> 01:32:47.740]
No.

[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:50.080]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:32:50.780 --> 01:32:52.760]
We want people no more.

[01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:53.880]
I don't know.

[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.900]
W-Q-A-M.

[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.400]
Q-A-M.

[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:03.820]
Turn it up a little bit louder.

[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:06.240]
I thought we had a time-tunneler when yesterday but it didn't work out.

[01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.480]
Q-A-M, Ola, last chance.

[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:10.160]
Last chance for greatness.

[01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:11.220]
Too late.

[01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.600]
W-Q-A-M, hello.

[01:33:14.540 --> 01:33:14.940]
Congratulations.

[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:15.880]
Congratulations.

[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:16.860]
Congratulations.

[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:18.860]
Yeah, Mr. Rogers.

[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:20.100]
Hello.

[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.500]
What can I do for you, sir?

[01:33:21.660 --> 01:33:22.280]
How are you today, sir?

[01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:22.680]
Great.

[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:23.360]
Sensational.

[01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:26.340]
I'm sorry, I had some speaker phone that I'll take you off now for a minute.

[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:29.580]
That gentleman before and you've had an absolutely correct, sir.

[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.700]
There's no reason why we're over there and the people just don't...

[01:33:32.700 --> 01:33:33.240]
They don't care.

[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:34.340]
I didn't mix me mad.

[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.060]
Yeah.

[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:39.300]
I said this before and I'll say to you, misogers, there's two things I'm sure of in my life time.

[01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:43.800]
One, that OJ killed those two people and two, that they stole that election.

[01:33:44.540 --> 01:33:44.760]
Right.

[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:45.660]
And it's sad.

[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:45.720]
It's sad.

[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:46.460]
It's sad.

[01:33:46.460 --> 01:33:47.220]
No doubt about it.

[01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:47.660]
It's sad.

[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:50.080]
But I'll look for it to border pal, have a good trip.

[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:55.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT and T and Verizon Wireless Live.

[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:59.840]
We got 42,905 through yesterday for abandonment, pet rescue with our best and the emerging dice.

[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:02.120]
We got a van hit tomorrow between noon and two.

[01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:03.120]
We don't know where yet.

[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:03.440]
No.

[01:34:03.820 --> 01:34:04.620]
Some random place.

[01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:09.160]
And the good news is we're sending Scott Jr. out there in the van and he'll probably...

[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.560]
He probably knows what's going on with Ferrell.

[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.120]
He won't tell us, but he might tell you and then you can tell us.

[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.260]
That good idea?

[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:14.680]
Sure.

[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:15.620]
Don't pump him.

[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:17.060]
Don't pump him a little bit.

[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.740]
He probably enjoy it.

[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.580]
He'd have his head like way up in here anyway.

[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.400]
Kind of like stirring at the moon.

[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:24.200]
WQIM.

[01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:25.820]
Yeah!

[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:28.420]
WQIM.

[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.280]
Son of a...

[01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.080]
WQIM.

[01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:31.260]
Hello.

[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.760]
Fox Sports should go ODE's.

[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.440]
ODE's will be good, Mike.

[01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:36.100]
They'll be really good.

[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:36.980]
Happy holidays, Mike.

[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.220]
They'll never call us again till we let you know the coast is clear.

[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:43.860]
And they can hire him to be a DJ.

[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.980]
They can hire Mike Wants to be on air.

[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.540]
You can play some nifty jingles and it would be great.

[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.620]
What's the thing?

[01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:50.760]
Yeah.

[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:53.800]
Let's bring back audio QAM jingles and...

[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:55.960]
It's big!

[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:56.860]
Yeah, like those.

[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:58.460]
That's an idea.

[01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.260]
That's a thought, Mike.

[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.180]
Sure, they couldn't get any worse numbers than they got already.

[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:03.840]
Nice going, Pete Boulder, with that 50,000 watts in the middle of the dial.

[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:06.940]
That you people have turned into a toilet, a cesspool on a radio dial.

[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:08.120]
Shame on you, Pete.

[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:09.020]
You suck whole.

[01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:09.600]
You idiot.

[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:10.680]
You cypilled him.

[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.740]
See how I didn't even mind hearing from Wyne Mike now.

[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.580]
Because it's the holidays.

[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.960]
You're just too much of a hard-ass.

[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:17.780]
Yeah, which point?

[01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:18.740]
The lighten up a little bit.

[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:22.660]
In addition, which keep this in mind, as much as little as you're making, as much as I'm making,

[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:25.280]
it doesn't change regardless of who's on the other end of the phone.

[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:26.080]
Oh, I know that.

[01:35:26.380 --> 01:35:26.880]
Never the last.

[01:35:27.100 --> 01:35:29.720]
See, I was telling my friends that are three hour dinner last night at Ruth Chris.

[01:35:29.940 --> 01:35:34.220]
I was telling them that, you know, really when you come right down to what I've adopted several months ago,

[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:35.720]
and I'm just ecstatic that I have.

[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.480]
I think being here much of the time is helping to do that.

[01:35:38.900 --> 01:35:42.300]
But I've got just a completely totally different attitude than I used to have before.

[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:47.600]
And my only regret is that I didn't adopt this attitude a long ago, much, much longer ago than I did.

[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.980]
Because it just doesn't make any difference.

[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:56.940]
Whether we have a one share, a ten share, a thirty share, whether we have great calls, horse crap calls,

[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.540]
a bunch of chronic, I mean, crop share.

[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:00.660]
It makes no difference.

[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:01.160]
I know.

[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:04.120]
Do you follow what I'm saying?

[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:06.940]
No, I'm talking about what you're doing to do your best every single day.

[01:36:07.060 --> 01:36:10.000]
And if the audience is typical, it's, it's, who cares?

[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:11.640]
Both of us already know.

[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.920]
Soon, it's Wednesday.

[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:14.720]
We got the big one to two comedies.

[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:15.640]
It's our, it's Wednesday.

[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.960]
Oh, we got to, forget all about that.

[01:36:17.420 --> 01:36:18.960]
We got to lick, we're licking it.

[01:36:19.960 --> 01:36:21.020]
Any chance I get?

[01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:22.960]
W-Q-A-M?

[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.460]
Yeah, Mr. Rogers.

[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:25.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:26.360]
How you doing today?

[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:27.800]
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.640]
I'm doing fantastic.

[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:29.280]
Thank you.

[01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:34.540]
I just wanted to know if you have a chance yesterday to read a column on Paul Kruzman in the meantime.

[01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:35.800]
It was on our website.

[01:36:35.960 --> 01:36:37.200]
You know, I'm glad you mentioned that.

[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:39.940]
I'm glad you mentioned because I was going to read it on the ear yesterday,

[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.220]
but I'm going to do it now because you inspired me to do it.

[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:42.720]
Hacked the vote.

[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.440]
Exactly. Please do because, you know, I don't know what to expect anymore,

[01:36:46.580 --> 01:36:47.940]
but I don't think we're going to win no more.

[01:36:48.380 --> 01:36:49.260]
The fixes in, baby.

[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:49.760]
I think you're right.

[01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.080]
I can see that coming.

[01:36:51.260 --> 01:36:51.460]
Okay.

[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:52.400]
Thanks for having me.

[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.320]
We're going to do the next hour.

[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:53.660]
Thank you.

[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:54.020]
Thank you.

[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.740]
I got it right here.

[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:57.680]
And it is on our website.

[01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:59.560]
I put it on today, which I should have had it on yesterday,

[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.020]
but I screwed up all the way around.

[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.620]
Well, I had a big pile of crap here yesterday.

[01:37:02.740 --> 01:37:03.100]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:04.080]
I cleaned it up, though.

[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:04.680]
Good.

[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.320]
Paul Kruzman in the Times, Hacked the vote.

[01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.700]
I'll get to that, like, almost immediately following the break.

[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.540]
In other words, when I get around to it, pretty soon.

[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:14.960]
Also, courtiers arguments over slot machines in South Florida.

[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:15.740]
Wow.

[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:16.780]
Well, I bet you didn't take fine, Brigadier.

[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.920]
My friends at Pompedo Park are just hanging on the edge of their seats.

[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320]
It's the only hope we got, baby.

[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:23.540]
The only hope we got.

[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.280]
Get the slots.

[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:27.680]
Get quit with all that Bible thumping, right-wing lunatics that make Florida

[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:29.180]
the end of the thought place that it is.

[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:31.000]
I'm going to find the local office.

[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.380]
This is Vice City.

[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:34.120]
The radio's on your side.

[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.160]
You in!

[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.020]
Power to Davidity.

[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:42.860]
The only thing funny and then rape of it is that pipe smoke is 12-1 hour.

[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:49.280]
Welcome back to the smegmov, and not a victorious firing thanks to the mohawada David issue.

[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:54.340]
Hey Mo, what kids with a groucho have?

[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.020]
Groucho have.

[01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.740]
Are you insane, the Aiden, that I'm an old Jew?

[01:37:58.220 --> 01:37:58.880]
Why you?

[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.660]
My hair's not back from the tailor yet, yet suckling.

[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:02.680]
The tailor?

[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.460]
Yeah, I'm having it a hem, a hem, a hem, a hem.

[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:09.560]
Besides, it's it, it's now, it's today.

[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:12.860]
Why you haven't even noticed my big baggy low-crouch pants here?

[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:14.100]
Yes, it's a good one.

[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.160]
I can lose too.

[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:16.240]
See that?

[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:17.680]
I'll go to my bedroom.

[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.020]
I do have for the king.

[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.160]
Thanks for your one a sing.

[01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:23.740]
Bring, bring, bring, bring, bring.

[01:38:24.300 --> 01:38:26.800]
I'm going to have me a hypnotic and a henna-seeing.

[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:27.840]
Henna-seeing.

[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:28.740]
Henna-seeing.

[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:30.680]
It wasn't that Jackie Cooper.

[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:32.460]
Now my hips, the man.

[01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:36.640]
I've got a dou-wa-tetti, dou-wa-ditty, tang-planet.

[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.540]
And a dou-gu-gu-gu-gu-my-panet.

[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.240]
And a wily bag, I got a go-gu-gu-panet.

[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.020]
And that puts my skills in the middle of my isch-gibble.

[01:38:47.360 --> 01:38:51.060]
I got more than a cos-benza than a mitzigena.

[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.420]
Missile, missile, missile, grab it on my balls.

[01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.920]
That ain't all of it.

[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:58.240]
But I want a doll.

[01:38:58.240 --> 01:38:59.720]
And his bag sure sizzles.

[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:03.140]
It's 1205-60-WDQM-396 votes on a pool.

[01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:04.960]
Here's our first pool.

[01:39:05.080 --> 01:39:05.460]
This is it.

[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:06.580]
We're changing pools right now.

[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:07.600]
Okay, we're hopping on the other one.

[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:08.160]
Okay.

[01:39:08.620 --> 01:39:09.320]
First one's kind of limp.

[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.840]
If Scott were all on the air mornings at another station,

[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.180]
how would you that affect your listening?

[01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:14.260]
No change.

[01:39:14.420 --> 01:39:15.780]
I don't listen to QM before 10 AM.

[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:16.620]
178.

[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.460]
45.1%.

[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:20.740]
I listen to Farrell and Joe.

[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:21.380]
90.

[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:22.440]
23%.

[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:24.520]
I listen to Farrell not more Joe.

[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:25.100]
86.

[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:26.260]
No mojo.

[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.200]
21.5%.

[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:28.680]
We'll say that.

[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:30.920]
I'd still listen to Mo and Joe Rose.

[01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:31.700]
35.

[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:33.100]
As opposed to Farrell.

[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:34.340]
That's 9%.

[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:35.840]
And I'd still listen to Mo.

[01:39:35.980 --> 01:39:36.700]
I don't listen to Joe.

[01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:37.180]
5.

[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.080]
The same 5.

[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:39.520]
I don't really 400 votes.

[01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:40.260]
1.2%.

[01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.300]
Mo's exclusive QM.

[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:46.260]
1.2.3.

[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:52.220]
You got the one from Werbred Helles from Little Savannah.

[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:54.540]
You got Stuttering Steve de Marlon's guy.

[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:55.840]
You got Mark DeJets fan.

[01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.120]
You got Paulie, Miss Fit, The Wingland Patriot guy.

[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:00.280]
And Richie from Borussia.

[01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:00.880]
That's 5.

[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:03.480]
You know, with all those chronics who need to host?

[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:05.060]
And of course Dennis in the closet.

[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:06.280]
Oh yeah.

[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:07.480]
Paul Kruglin right.

[01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:08.200]
Oh, here's the new pool.

[01:40:08.780 --> 01:40:09.340]
Excuse me.

[01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:10.720]
Coach is clear Eric.

[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:11.640]
We can change the pool.

[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:13.800]
Pool number 2.

[01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:19.940]
What's your take on the Black Man, the Daniel Jones, who died in Cincinnati after a confrontation

[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:20.660]
with the police?

[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.760]
For five choices, they should have had taser guns.

[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:26.260]
And let me ask you this.

[01:40:26.340 --> 01:40:27.540]
Why didn't they have taser guns?

[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:30.800]
I think there was one taser.

[01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:31.220]
Taser.

[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:32.800]
A teaser taser?

[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:33.320]
No.

[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:35.480]
They should have had taser guns.

[01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:36.760]
They overreacted.

[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:38.020]
They were defending themselves.

[01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.280]
He deserved it or it's a racial thing.

[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.900]
I think that covers a disease, don't you?

[01:40:43.100 --> 01:40:43.280]
A disease?

[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:48.740]
What's your take on a Black Man, the Daniel Jones, who died in Cincinnati after a confrontation

[01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:49.160]
with police?

[01:40:49.320 --> 01:40:53.160]
And we got a group of professional Black agitators there in Cincinnati, one of whom she

[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.360]
so liked, complicate, she makes Michael Jackson look dark.

[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.960]
They're like already starting to want to get the mayor fired and start a whole big

[01:40:58.960 --> 01:40:59.180]
sentence.

[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:00.440]
What the was that?

[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:01.100]
Oh, so did.

[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.680]
They should have had taser guns.

[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.620]
They overreacted.

[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:05.560]
They were defending themselves.

[01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.680]
He deserved it or it's a racial thing.

[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:10.160]
Now today, they're finally showing a lot more of the tape.

[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.340]
And we'll get to that in a minute.

[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:14.520]
Because there's more to it than meets the eye.

[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:17.820]
And also the thing about slot machines and stuff for it.

[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:18.800]
Come on, let's go.

[01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:20.200]
You idiots, you clowns.

[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.640]
Let's move south forward to the out of the dark ages.

[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.500]
All these Bible thumpin' redneck, right wing assholes.

[01:41:26.780 --> 01:41:28.900]
You got every kind of gamut that's ever been invented already.

[01:41:29.060 --> 01:41:30.380]
What the hell could possibly be wrong?

[01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:35.060]
Oh, the evil slot machines that extract the herald and the sunsend will have a nervous

[01:41:35.060 --> 01:41:35.820]
crap about it.

[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:37.240]
God, they make me sick.

[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:42.480]
You know, the media, I don't care what anybody, you can argue with me all you want.

[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:46.360]
The media leads the public in America by the nose and they lead them right into the toilet.

[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:47.400]
We're going to have to lead them.

[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:50.580]
That's why they hold bush that farcey pull down Thanksgiving.

[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:55.940]
If it weren't for the way the media presented it, I was watching CNN the moment that they

[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:56.620]
got the announcement.

[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.760]
And what else that Jack asked his name that they got under all weekend long?

[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:03.240]
Oh, gee, what the heck can see them now?

[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:04.580]
I can't see them.

[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:08.240]
But anyway, ask blind Mike see if he can see them now.

[01:42:08.900 --> 01:42:13.040]
But he was sitting there and just telling, oh, well, this totally takes us by surprise.

[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.060]
Here's the breaking news.

[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:18.860]
Low row comes on, you know, and the president has arrived in Iraq for a surprise visit.

[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.800]
Nobody knew about this.

[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:22.820]
Niyadi, Niyadi, and of course by the time they announced it, he already left.

[01:42:23.180 --> 01:42:23.280]
Right.

[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:25.840]
He had already high-tailed it out of there.

[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.720]
And they presented it like this was the most glorious.

[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:33.460]
And I'll say it again, the media and the weak need Democrats who just continue having

[01:42:33.460 --> 01:42:35.920]
no balls at all, no cahons.

[01:42:36.700 --> 01:42:40.060]
Oh, and of course it was a very courageous thing for the very wonderful thing for the

[01:42:40.060 --> 01:42:40.700]
morale of the troops.

[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:41.520]
Bull crap.

[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:42.820]
It was just another photo op.

[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.900]
Just like yours, Hillary, you bitch.

[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.960]
Just another phony photo op.

[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:51.380]
All these people are dying over there every day for no reason whatsoever.

[01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:53.140]
And you people are worried about ball games.

[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.580]
That's what makes me nauseous about WQA.

[01:42:55.680 --> 01:42:56.460]
It makes me embarrassed.

[01:42:56.780 --> 01:42:57.660]
I'm humiliated about it.

[01:42:57.700 --> 01:42:58.340]
I still take the money.

[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:01.520]
But I'm embarrassed to be a part of this thing.

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.180]
This sports sickness.

[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:04.220]
It's like an illness.

[01:43:04.500 --> 01:43:06.240]
It's one thing to be a sports fan, which I am.

[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.560]
I watched a bit of the after my eight hour dinner last night, a little bit of the

[01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.700]
least ranger game.

[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:13.880]
Glad to see him when they're six.

[01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:14.480]
And that's nice.

[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:17.200]
But I've got it like in a compartment of my life.

[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:19.820]
It's over like a little pie part of my interest.

[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.580]
You see what I'm saying?

[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:21.640]
Yes.

[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:26.240]
As opposed to being my whole existence revolves around, well when's Alexander Mugione coming

[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:26.560]
back?

[01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.720]
And how about Gary Roberts injured again, a.

[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:30.200]
And all of this other crap.

[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:32.360]
God.

[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.600]
Well, there's that Alfonso Rodriguez Jr.

[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.520]
Be the convicted kidnapper and the rapist that they let out probably way too soon.

[01:43:39.540 --> 01:43:41.200]
And he's the one responsible for that.

[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.460]
The shoulder young girl, moon face beater.

[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:46.540]
Yeah, one of your people, Rod Reed.

[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:47.580]
No, no, thank you.

[01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:51.840]
One of your people, Rod Reed, he's up in your family tree along with a key from entry

[01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.380]
at the beastly.

[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:52.620]
He's there.

[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.660]
They're all the same tree.

[01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.480]
He's strumming on it right now.

[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:56.240]
No, it's not happy.

[01:43:56.240 --> 01:43:57.820]
He's going to be in the mummers parade this weekend.

[01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:58.920]
Anyway.

[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:02.840]
Paul Krugman writes, hack the vote in New York Times yesterday.

[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:04.780]
It's not that long.

[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:09.060]
In fighting bush supporters to a fundraiser, the host wrote, I am committed to helping

[01:44:09.060 --> 01:44:11.660]
Ohio deliver its electoral votes to the president next year.

[01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:12.960]
No surprise there.

[01:44:13.400 --> 01:44:17.440]
But Walden O'Dell, who says that he wasn't talking about his business operations, happens

[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.700]
to be the chief executive of Diebold Inc., whose touchscreen voting machines are an increasingly

[01:44:21.700 --> 01:44:23.300]
widespread use across the US.

[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:29.520]
For example, Georgia, where Republican Scrooze Spectacular upset victories in the 2002

[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.640]
midterm elections, realized explosively on Diebold machines.

[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:37.260]
To be clear, though there were many anomalies in that 2002 vote, there was no evidence that

[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:40.640]
the machines miscounted, but there's also no evidence the machines counted correctly.

[01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:43.340]
You see, Diebold machines don't leave no paper trail.

[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:48.220]
Representative Rush Holt of New Jersey was introduced to be over requiring that digital

[01:44:48.220 --> 01:44:52.500]
voting machines leave a paper trail, and that their software be available for public inspection

[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:56.340]
is occasionally told that the systems lacking these safeguards haven't caused problems.

[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:57.680]
How do you know he asks?

[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.900]
What we do know about Diebold is not inspire confidence.

[01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:04.820]
The details are technical, but they add up to a picture of a company that was at the very

[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:08.820]
least extremely sloppy about security and may have been traveling and trying to cover

[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:09.800]
up product defects.

[01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:15.140]
Early this year, Bev Harris, who's writing a book on voting machines, found Diebold software,

[01:45:15.260 --> 01:45:18.640]
which the company refuses to make available for public inspection on the grounds that

[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.200]
is proprietary, on an unprotected server where anyone could download it.

[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.840]
The software was in a folder titled robjorget.zip.

[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.880]
RobDashGeorged.zip.

[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:33.540]
The server was used by employees of Diebold election systems to update software and its

[01:45:33.540 --> 01:45:34.000]
machines.

[01:45:35.300 --> 01:45:39.200]
This in itself was an incredible breach of security, offering someone who wanted to hack

[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:41.900]
into the machines both the information and the opportunity to do so.

[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:47.440]
An analisation of Diebold software by researchers at Johns Hopkins and Rice University's found

[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:49.640]
it both unreliable and subject to abuse.

[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.240]
A later report commissioned by the state of Maryland apparently reads similar conclusions.

[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.920]
It's hard to be sure because the state released only a heavily redacted version.

[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:02.200]
Meanwhile leaked internal Diebold email suggests that corporate officials knew their system

[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:05.360]
was flawed and circumvented the test it would have revealed these problems.

[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.860]
The company hasn't contested the authenticity of these documents instead it's engaged

[01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:11.780]
in legal actions for a vendor dissemination.

[01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.800]
Why isn't this front page news?

[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:19.000]
In October of British newspaper the independent ran a hair-raising investigative report on

[01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.040]
US touchscreen voting.

[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:24.180]
But while the mainstream press has reported the basics, the Diebold affair has been treated

[01:46:24.180 --> 01:46:27.900]
as a technology or business story not as a potential political scandal.

[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:33.220]
This difference because the treatment of other voting issues like the Florida Pellan purge

[01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:37.160]
that inappropriate-appointed many citizens from voting in the 2000 presidential election.

[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:42.360]
The attitude seems to be that questions about the integrity of vote counts are divisive

[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.540]
at best paranoid at worst.

[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:48.560]
Even before advocates like Mr. Holt make a point of disassociating themselves from conspiracy

[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:52.480]
theories instead they focus on legislation to prevent further future abuses.

[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:57.260]
But there's nothing paranoid about suggesting that political operatives given the opportunity

[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:58.640]
might engage in dirty tricks.

[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.440]
Indeed given the intensity of partisanship these days, one suspects that small dirty tricks

[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:03.960]
are common.

[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:09.060]
For example, or enhanced the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee recently announced

[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:13.120]
that one of his aids had improperly accessed sensitive democratic computer files that were

[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:13.860]
leaked to the press.

[01:47:14.460 --> 01:47:18.960]
This admission, contradicting an earlier declaration by Senator Hatsett, a staff of

[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:22.880]
and clear of culpability, came on the same day that the Senate police announced that

[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.800]
they were having a counter-espionage expert to investigate the theft.

[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.780]
Republican members of the Committee have demanded that the expert investigate only how

[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:33.080]
those specific documents were leaked, not whether any other breaches took place.

[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:33.920]
I wonder why.

[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:38.140]
The point is that you don't have to believe in a central conspiracy to worry that partisans

[01:47:38.140 --> 01:47:43.220]
will take advantage of an insecure, unverifiable voting system to manipulate election results.

[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:44.540]
Why expose them to temptation?

[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:49.240]
I'll discuss what to do in a future column, but let this be clear, the credibility of

[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.940]
U.S. democracy may be at stake.

[01:47:51.100 --> 01:47:55.200]
Right, Paul Kroen, in yesterday's New York Times, it's on our website today on theoranges.com.

[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:55.880]
You go Paul.

[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.300]
You go Paul is right.

[01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:01.320]
And the public sits out there, and just like I've called me for it, there's no question,

[01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:03.020]
just like we know OJ killed the two people.

[01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:07.640]
Even more positive we are that the 2011 election was rigged in every possible way under the

[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:07.860]
sun.

[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:11.740]
Forget about the butterfly ballot.

[01:48:12.020 --> 01:48:15.280]
Forget about the fact that the Supreme Court, that his buddies on the Supreme Court stopped

[01:48:15.280 --> 01:48:18.980]
to vote count when Gore was munching into that margin.

[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:19.960]
He was munching it.

[01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.200]
Forget about that.

[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:25.000]
You just take the people who were illegally and improperly deleted from the voter rolls

[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:25.500]
like he says.

[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:27.020]
There was so-called felons who weren't.

[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:29.280]
Most of whom were blacks.

[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:30.760]
Most of whom were voted for Al Gore.

[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:34.580]
And we're talking hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands of voters who were disenfranchised

[01:48:34.580 --> 01:48:35.660]
and prevented from voting.

[01:48:35.660 --> 01:48:37.940]
Remember the stories we had about people that were turned around?

[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.360]
Oh, you're not going to be allowed to vote.

[01:48:39.680 --> 01:48:39.800]
Right.

[01:48:40.540 --> 01:48:41.860]
By the FHP?

[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:42.240]
Mm-hmm.

[01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:45.880]
I mean, you talk about the fix was ends to anybody who wonders why Jeb Bush had three

[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:49.180]
o'clock in the morning while the networks were crappin' in their pants changing the announcements

[01:48:49.180 --> 01:48:50.200]
of who won and who lost.

[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.080]
Three o'clock in the morning calls up brother W and says, don't worry, you won.

[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.260]
Duh.

[01:48:56.860 --> 01:48:57.400]
But yeah.

[01:48:59.140 --> 01:48:59.500]
Boy.

[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.080]
And the public sits back and.

[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:04.580]
It's just it's frustrating.

[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:05.280]
It's frustrating.

[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:05.760]
It's pathetic.

[01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:06.460]
It's embarrassing.

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:08.820]
It's humiliating and degrading.

[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:13.800]
It's like going into your backyard and finin' four pounds of Todd Rex body left over after

[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.520]
he was mauled by 16 pit bulls.

[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:16.060]
Imagine that.

[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:18.340]
Imagine this on your next mortgage.

[01:49:18.540 --> 01:49:23.180]
Imagine zero closing costs, zero application fee, zero credit bureau fee, zero discounted

[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:23.460]
points.

[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:24.880]
It's the last mortgage you'll ever need.

[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:29.640]
It's the revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group now with an interest rate

[01:49:29.640 --> 01:49:31.120]
at just 1.95%.

[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.740]
That's only if you have a $200,000 loan per example, $738 a month your payments.

[01:49:36.220 --> 01:49:39.600]
And once you refinance or obtain a new home mortgage from financial group, you'll never

[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:40.920]
pay closing costs again.

[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:42.120]

1-800-940-Lind.

[01:50:15.020 --> 01:50:19.920]
The Renekville Housing Lender restrictions apply rate subject change monthly 5.19 APR.

[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.560]
Always love them pit bulls.

[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:27.760]
We are support radio 560-UAM.

[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.560]
We're not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:37.560]
Think the moneys, moneys who we care in their own mothers.

[01:50:39.340 --> 01:50:44.120]
I'll bet you're gonna save that when a gun's at your back if they take your board that

[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:44.560]
train.

[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.960]
Right, we're not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.860]
Well, it just ain't enough.

[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.220]
Just have luck.

[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:55.540]
Feelin' the airways with hatred.

[01:50:56.060 --> 01:51:00.820]
The radio was permeated with the likes of Dr. Laura Bill, Henry, and Michael Reagan.

[01:51:01.560 --> 01:51:06.060]
They call the clear channel cost are clearly out to make the message clear.

[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:06.740]
Are you sure?

[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:10.420]
They're right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:15.720]
They're all right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:21.240]
For all the table-talking idiot to root and get any dumber.

[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:27.880]
That or not, we do whatever they are told to believe and worship Georgia's their king.

[01:51:28.860 --> 01:51:32.120]
Right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:38.660]
Well, the Democrats who crap their pants like a child that is scary-moving.

[01:51:39.300 --> 01:51:43.500]
Have Terry McCullough who should go home and shut up, but he don't have a clue what he's

[01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:43.940]
doing.

[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:50.280]
The Democrats have a death wish when it comes to deciding who they will run, and you

[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:51.880]
can color them done.

[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:54.340]
If they run jolly, they're mine.

[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:59.060]
Boy, right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:52:00.260 --> 01:52:04.580]
They're all right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:09.660]
Who get indignant if it isn't them that's getting a juicy hammer.

[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:16.600]
Just remember what I said when it comes to your back as they make you or that train.

[01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:20.520]
Right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:26.000]
They're all right winged not zebra-bubblekin' mother f**kers.

[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.740]
From 16 to 5, 60 of you who are my second pollers on what you'd take on a black man in

[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:36.600]
Daniel Jones who had died in a Cincinnati after that little concert-tops after the confrontation

[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.180]
with the police.

[01:52:38.020 --> 01:52:38.820]
69 votes.

[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.620]
They were defending themselves 18.

[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:43.280]
He deserved it 18.

[01:52:44.040 --> 01:52:45.460]
They should have had taser guns 14.

[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:46.200]
That's what I voted.

[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:48.460]
They overracked it 14.

[01:52:48.680 --> 01:52:49.960]
It's a racial thing 5.

[01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:52.100]
Do you think it's a racial thing?

[01:52:52.380 --> 01:52:52.540]
No.

[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:53.200]
No.

[01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:54.320]
You either do why.

[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:55.460]
That's any racial thing.

[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.220]
Should have had taser guns.

[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:59.900]
I mean he was out of control and we got more on the story in a bit here, but you know,

[01:53:00.820 --> 01:53:01.680]
he didn't do anything.

[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:03.520]
He deserved to die for.

[01:53:04.020 --> 01:53:04.220]
See?

[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:07.200]
Well, he put himself at risk.

[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:08.400]
Let me see it again.

[01:53:08.540 --> 01:53:10.800]
He didn't do anything that I can see that he deserved to die for.

[01:53:11.020 --> 01:53:14.140]
If they would have had taser guns, they could have subdued him without all the crap going

[01:53:14.140 --> 01:53:16.160]
on and we would have all this, uh, semis.

[01:53:16.580 --> 01:53:16.880]
Mm-hmm.

[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:19.300]
Speaking of semis, Mark faxes us this.

[01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.060]
This is from a website.

[01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:29.220]
It says, a must see, uh, objective dot jesus saver save dot us slash kids dot html.

[01:53:30.300 --> 01:53:35.060]
It says scroll down to the spiritual safety tip and click on old mister grouse head and

[01:53:35.060 --> 01:53:37.220]
see what he says almost died laughing says market.

[01:53:37.220 --> 01:53:39.360]
Here it is spiritual safety tip.

[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:41.680]
Now what is that?

[01:53:41.720 --> 01:53:42.900]
Is that like a picture of an envelope?

[01:53:42.900 --> 01:53:43.820]
What is that thing?

[01:53:44.620 --> 01:53:45.000]
I don't know.

[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:45.760]
It's a box.

[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:46.860]
It's a box.

[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:47.840]
Well, what's in the box?

[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:49.720]
It says what you do if you find an atheist.

[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:55.880]
If you find an atheist in the neighborhood, teleparent or a pastor right away, you may

[01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:58.180]
move to try and witness these poor law souls yourself.

[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:00.180]
However, avoid talking to them.

[01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.980]
Atheists are often very grumpy and bitter.

[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:06.120]
Well, lash out at children.

[01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:08.700]
They may even try to trick you in in neglecting God's word.

[01:54:09.780 --> 01:54:12.760]
Very advanced witnessing techniques are needed for these grouches.

[01:54:13.100 --> 01:54:14.240]
Lift the adults, handle them.

[01:54:14.580 --> 01:54:18.780]
So on your kids out there, if you see an atheist call a parent or a pastor right away.

[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:20.700]
Oh my god, daddy.

[01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:21.300]
It's an atheist.

[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.340]
Oh jeez, that's run for the hell.

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:28.320]
Man, thanks, Mark.

[01:54:29.860 --> 01:54:31.840]
Most amusing and most typical.

[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:36.480]
Now, we got the new tape, which I'm sure many of you have seen several times today,

[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:40.040]
about 30 men of a Nathaniel, whatever's name was, Jones.

[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.440]
New video released yesterday showed a man who died shortly after violent confrontation

[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:48.260]
with the police, dancing and marching around a restaurant in the parking lot before officers

[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:49.040]
arrived on the scene.

[01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:53.100]
The video shot from inside and outside the white castle restaurant.

[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:56.200]
See, when that guy called up, was he yesterday or Monday?

[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.020]
The first call.

[01:54:59.420 --> 01:55:00.500]
He did have a good line.

[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:03.600]
The only problem is he's so chronic and is always starting a racial crap that as soon as

[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.680]
I heard his voice, I never even got to that part.

[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.500]
So you understood what he was saying, the branch line, I didn't get to that.

[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:11.940]
He was saying, what was this black guy acting up outside of white castle?

[01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:14.040]
Something like that, right?

[01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.200]
Sure to get beaten.

[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:19.220]
The video shot from inside and outside the white castle restaurant showed Nathaniel Jones

[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:22.600]
greeting her friend inside the restaurant early Sunday morning and then dancing briefly.

[01:55:22.860 --> 01:55:23.660]
One of the guys got rhythm.

[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:25.900]
He then went into the parking lot.

[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:29.960]
When you listen, he then went to the parking lot where continued to dance in March like a soldier.

[01:55:30.660 --> 01:55:32.400]
Maybe he was just practicing the old goose step.

[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:34.240]
Now, he knows the votes are fixed.

[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:36.880]
Later, he fell down and rolled down a hill.

[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:39.140]
Kind of like Jack and Jill, who gave him a thrill.

[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:41.140]
But he took too many pills.

[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:46.880]
Restaurant employees called the fire department at 545 and to report his bizarre behavior.

[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:50.220]
The tape also shows another view of the altercation with the police.

[01:55:50.380 --> 01:55:54.820]
And Jones is seen lunging at one officer as he is on the squad card dashboard videotape.

[01:55:55.160 --> 01:55:55.960]
He lunged at him.

[01:55:57.340 --> 01:56:01.820]
Jones who weighed 350 pounds died at a hospital shortly after the police beating with metal

[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:02.980]
night sticks to subdue him.

[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:07.680]
The Hamilton County Corners office said Monday in autopsy show Jones 41 had an enlarged heart

[01:56:07.680 --> 01:56:10.980]
and cocaine and PCP or angel dust in his system.

[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:13.820]
An official caused a death expected to be issued today.

[01:56:14.140 --> 01:56:18.120]
The Corners office yesterday said Jones had bruises on his legs, but no sign of injuries

[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.380]
to his internal organs.

[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.120]
Police later found about a third of a gram of powdered cocaine and two cigarettes dipped

[01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:28.740]
in Angel dust in Jones car.

[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:32.880]
The Corners office said preliminary test showed a presence of both in his system like I said.

[01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.820]
At about a third of a gram of powdered cocaine and two cigarettes dipped in Angel dust.

[01:56:38.380 --> 01:56:39.640]
I didn't think he could get that anymore.

[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:43.520]
Maybe he was listening to rush.

[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:48.000]
I was early in the morning maybe he was getting ready to listen to rush or getting one.

[01:56:48.780 --> 01:56:51.840]
So now he's dead and of course they're the same usual agitators.

[01:56:51.940 --> 01:56:52.800]
Now sometimes they're right.

[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:54.100]
Sometimes it's a racial thing.

[01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:56.180]
And how many people say so far in our poll?

[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:57.020]
It's a racial thing.

[01:56:58.340 --> 01:56:58.720]
Seven.

[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:04.260]
Out of 92 votes which means we got seven dark folks who voted that way.

[01:57:04.400 --> 01:57:06.820]
I don't think any white people would say it's a racial thing to you.

[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:07.120]
Nope.

[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:07.740]
No.

[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.420]
No, not even the ACLU types are saying that.

[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:15.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.560]
Wireless line.

[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:17.720]
Let's get these phones spoken.

[01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:20.920]
Maybe we only got the 39 minutes here to solve the problems of the world.

[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:22.060]
Let's get with it.

[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.080]
WDQIM.

[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:24.360]
Yeah, I go to New.

[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.460]
Yes sir, speaking.

[01:57:25.940 --> 01:57:26.640]
Oh well, sorry.

[01:57:27.180 --> 01:57:27.940]
Don't be sorry.

[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:29.680]
Two quick things.

[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:32.760]
Number one, for all not be on the air over at Fox.

[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:36.580]
Apparently it's going to be a final cast from Orlando with Dan Silio.

[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:38.820]
So another sports hole from out of town.

[01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:41.220]
So however it's for all is this is official now?

[01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:46.140]
It's pretty close to being so yeah, you can go to the bank or at least it's the same time.

[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:47.480]
Now who's this ass on?

[01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:48.980]
I mean, who's this guy that's putting on from Orlando?

[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:51.000]
People like a sports version of Chinat.

[01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.500]
See the reason that they're doing that is because it's not going to cost them any money.

[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:55.500]
They just open up a pot.

[01:57:56.340 --> 01:57:57.840]
It's another cheap channel way to like a...

[01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.680]
This is where the airwaves are.

[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:00.860]
So much too expensive.

[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:01.580]
You bet.

[01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:06.560]
And I guess you know for the 100,000 wherever he is demanding they're just saying that thank you.

[01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:11.360]
There may be some local host co-hosting but they're not sure whether that's going to happen or not.

[01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:12.260]
Still gots.

[01:58:12.680 --> 01:58:15.700]
No, no, it would be someone who gets to speak English and put two cents on their.

[01:58:16.840 --> 01:58:17.720]
The co.

[01:58:19.940 --> 01:58:24.920]
The other thing is that on that video we can't see the first what two minutes, right?

[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:25.420]
Right.

[01:58:25.420 --> 01:58:28.860]
So we really don't know if the guy did anything to provoke.

[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:35.360]
I mean, anytime you whack a cop, especially if you're high on PCP, you've got to believe that you can end up in a bad way.

[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.240]
The problem is...

[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:40.520]
And especially when you're stoned on your ass, like you said, and especially when you weigh 350 pounds,

[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:44.640]
and especially when you've got a bad heart and you're like probably on the verge anyway from pulling yourself with drugs.

[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:51.000]
There's one thing that the cops down here and other places have run into is that there does come a point in time when

[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:55.540]
they deal that they have at least if not the guy in the control of the situation, they're controlled.

[01:58:55.540 --> 01:58:56.340]
They're not in danger.

[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:58.400]
So they're whacking them with the batons.

[01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:58.820]
Right.

[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:01.060]
May have not been the best idea at that point.

[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:02.780]
Of course, the best thing would have been to have tasers.

[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:03.540]
That's what they're there for.

[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:04.480]
That's what I said.

[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:05.120]
That's what I voted.

[01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:08.720]
But with those stun guns around, they felt they were in danger and I guess the guy would do

[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.320]
fat to get his arms behind his back.

[01:59:10.820 --> 01:59:12.200]
And that's the other thing that we're trying to do.

[01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:13.600]
So it's going to be a close call.

[01:59:13.700 --> 01:59:16.940]
But the problem is since any cops have killed like seven or ten people in the last.

[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:19.880]
Yeah, they seem to have like a little epidemic going on there.

[01:59:19.880 --> 01:59:21.120]
Yeah, a little bit of a problem.

[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:22.100]
All right.

[01:59:22.200 --> 01:59:22.440]
Good luck.

[01:59:22.560 --> 01:59:23.200]
Nice for the info.

[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:24.060]
Kyle, have a great day.

[01:59:24.120 --> 01:59:24.540]
I'm here for you.

[01:59:24.820 --> 01:59:25.300]
That was good.

[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:26.320]
But that was a good call.

[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:26.900]
That was great.

[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:27.240]
I feel it.

[01:59:27.780 --> 01:59:29.380]
He sounded like an insider to me.

[01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:30.460]
Who was that best bet?

[01:59:30.640 --> 01:59:31.100]
I don't know.

[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:31.720]
We don't want to.

[01:59:31.780 --> 01:59:32.420]
We don't want to.

[01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:32.920]
We don't want to.

[01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:33.220]
We don't want to.

[01:59:33.220 --> 01:59:33.260]
We don't want to.

[01:59:33.300 --> 01:59:34.040]
We're not going to tell.

[01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:35.580]
He's the mole.

[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:37.260]
But anyway, there is the story.

[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:39.880]
For now, I wanted over there at Fox in the worst way.

[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.520]
Get right back on the ear and Chief Channel said, no, we ain't going to pay out no money.

[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.840]
See, this again, I want.

[01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:48.700]
And that's not going to make any difference because it's just like the bush thing.

[01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:51.440]
No matter what you say, but at least you got to say it.

[01:59:51.460 --> 01:59:52.900]
At least you feel like you got a clear conscience.

[01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.380]
You've said it and you hope you penetrate some of these brains.

[01:59:56.080 --> 01:59:58.540]
This is why this whole grotesque thing

[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:02.360]
that the Republicans and Bush and the right wingers have gotten together and done with the

[02:00:04.020 --> 02:00:08.800]
FCC regulations on ownership of radio stations and TV stations and newspapers.

[02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:12.520]
This is why it's so grotesque because this is what's going on.

[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:16.600]
You've got via comment and Chief Channel, who of course are both now stuck

[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.240]
on up to the right wing.

[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:19.140]
Well, Chief Channel has been part of it for a long time.

[02:00:20.900 --> 02:00:24.620]
But then again, you saw the Reagan miniseries being shipped off the showtime where nobody watches.

[02:00:24.760 --> 02:00:27.000]
Anyway, because of the pressure and then they lied about it,

[02:00:27.340 --> 02:00:28.160]
both the right wing.

[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:32.180]
Because they wanted to get that deal that compromised through there.

[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:36.220]
So they could keep their 39 stations, the 39 TV stations.

[02:00:36.940 --> 02:00:37.720]
And guess what?

[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:39.000]
That was the compromised number.

[02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:42.140]
Not 35, like it was supposed to have been due like it was before.

[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.500]
Not 36, 39.

[02:00:45.320 --> 02:00:47.220]
And we believe that that number just came out of thin air.

[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:48.640]
No, because we had the story the other day.

[02:00:48.780 --> 02:00:49.640]
That's magic number.

[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:52.820]
Yeah, I remember they pulled out of their ass just to satisfy their people

[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:55.220]
and buy a comm CBS slash your all the other assholes.

[02:00:55.680 --> 02:00:59.100]
And Chief Channel, they're not going to put anybody under the they have to pay money for.

[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:00.760]
Because that's not their philosophy.

[02:01:00.980 --> 02:01:04.660]
Their philosophy is to buy up as many radio stations as they can in as many markets

[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.840]
and it's a numbers game.

[02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:09.080]
Oh, we're going to deliver your clients 70% of the local audience.

[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:12.520]
Because we own 70% of the goddamn radio stations.

[02:01:12.600 --> 02:01:14.000]
Or whatever the hell percent it really is.

[02:01:15.460 --> 02:01:19.920]
In spite of the fact that they got like each station got a 1.2 share and a 0.5

[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:21.240]
and whatever else they got, you know.

[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.820]
I mean, what do they really got when you come right down to it?

[02:01:25.740 --> 02:01:28.460]
And I'm not talking about the fact they've stuck Howard Stern on some of their stations.

[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:29.540]
They're the fact that they've got Rush.

[02:01:29.880 --> 02:01:34.000]
But I'm talking about what do they got that they have invented that they originated that they

[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.620]
created that's really got a number.

[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:37.380]
The Schmidtmeister, I'll give them that.

[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:39.200]
All the wisdom numbers are declining rapidly.

[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.140]
What have they got?

[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:42.100]
What have they put on there?

[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:47.380]
It's just a bunch of pipe and syndicated crap that have turned your radio into a cesspool.

[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:49.860]
You can't complain about the choices on radio in no more.

[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:50.800]
Because there aren't any.

[02:01:51.760 --> 02:01:54.980]
And that's what these grave robbers and your federal government have done now.

[02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:56.040]
And it's getting worse every minute.

[02:01:57.180 --> 02:01:59.700]
So all you people to think that, oh, this is just wonderful.

[02:02:00.600 --> 02:02:01.780]
This is great.

[02:02:03.200 --> 02:02:05.620]
Halle, Louie, man, it's trickling right down your leg.

[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:06.060]
That's right.

[02:02:06.160 --> 02:02:06.840]
That old trickled out.

[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.740]
This is Reagan Part II all over again.

[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:09.940]
Only he forgot about Part I.

[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:13.040]
Part II, it's the same crap all over again.

[02:02:13.100 --> 02:02:13.960]
And the same, of course.

[02:02:14.140 --> 02:02:14.140]

[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:14.720]
Suspects.

[02:02:15.220 --> 02:02:16.320]
Wait, what's the same baloney?

[02:02:18.480 --> 02:02:22.040]
Why are they spinning all of this time on the Lacey Scott Peterson case?

[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:23.240]
Why are they doing this to us?

[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:23.960]
It's important.

[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:24.820]
What have we done?

[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:25.380]
What is not important?

[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:27.600]
Or else it is not important.

[02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:28.080]
Yes, it is.

[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:28.320]
Okay.

[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:28.360]
Okay.

[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:32.600]
In fact, I think what's more important is the Senator's Panthers game.

[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.360]
And good, you know, even though I still have to have like a compartment of our mind for the sports stuff.

[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:38.140]
But that's more important to me tonight.

[02:02:38.960 --> 02:02:40.260]
And we got it after the booster.

[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:44.040]
Seven o'clock Panther preview Ottawa Senators at the Panthers 739.

[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.960]
Ottawa, they're stumbling and bubbling at the beginning of their exciting team to watch.

[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:48.120]
So especially Marty Hamlet.

[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:48.920]
And anyway,

[02:02:49.740 --> 02:02:52.660]
any case on after the hockey game in June, Mark overnight, two to five in the morning.

[02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:56.100]
We certainly hope that Moe is back in one piece tomorrow and back on the year.

[02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:56.460]
Absolutely.

[02:02:56.460 --> 02:03:00.080]
Because we got that humongous dolphin at the Wimbledon game coming up this weekend.

[02:03:00.140 --> 02:03:00.500]
Absolutely.

[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:04.660]
We want to get the audience all primed and ready to rock and roll for that with a Moe

[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:04.800]
Myster.

[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:08.620]
What are your voice over that often such as he is with all those mistakes he's been making lately?

[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:10.080]
Maybe that's why he took the day off.

[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:11.200]
Don't try to unscramble his brain.

[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:12.320]
No.

[02:03:12.660 --> 02:03:13.540]
He said there were a lot of stress.

[02:03:13.700 --> 02:03:15.120]
Well, you think maybe we're something we said?

[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:16.340]
Slippin' Joe said.

[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:17.620]
Probably Joe.

[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:18.220]
Joe Mama.

[02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:19.640]
What did Joe say?

[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:20.400]
No, don't play that again.

[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:20.980]
That would be bad.

[02:03:21.140 --> 02:03:22.600]
All of one last thing to Howard too.

[02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:26.220]
Howard, don't let Barry Jackson and this stuff about your show's not entertaining.

[02:03:26.220 --> 02:03:26.980]
Get to you man.

[02:03:27.320 --> 02:03:31.040]
I hate seeing you making comments about it every day on your show.

[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.520]
Let it go man.

[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:33.000]
It's okay.

[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:34.880]
You don't have to go around calling Barry Jackson.

[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:36.460]
All right.

[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:39.340]
I know he's not listening because when he's off the air he goes up the boat.

[02:03:39.500 --> 02:03:40.600]
He's steady done listening anymore.

[02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:41.340]
So it's okay.

[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.540]
I know this is me.

[02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:46.020]
Moe and Stereo.

[02:03:47.260 --> 02:03:48.580]

[02:03:48.600 --> 02:03:50.060]
I'll tell you great place all you guys are there.

[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:50.840]
Want to look snappy?

[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.400]
Shelley Bloom's fashion clothingers.

[02:03:52.620 --> 02:03:55.680]
They've been serving the guys in South Florida for 40 years from the same great location.

[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.800]

[02:04:12.180 --> 02:04:12.980]

[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:16.840]

You pay only 795 bucks at Shelley Bloom's fashion clothing.

Shelley even offers a fantastic selection of Italian suits starting at just

[02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.600]

Shelley Bloom's fashion clothing no matter where you be, it's well worth the trip.

[02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:25.620]
Wonderful WQAM!

[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:32.040]
Justin time for the holidays, the most unusual Christmas album ever.

[02:05:32.260 --> 02:05:34.660]
All-grow Winfrey burps the Christmas classics.

[02:05:55.420 --> 02:06:00.260]
All-grow Winfrey burps the Christmas classics, available in the freezer section at RELPS.

[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:04.540]
Oh, speaking of people who fart bad, can you imagine over farting in an elevator?

[02:06:04.820 --> 02:06:09.640]
Oh my god. I don't know why the hell I came to mind, but since something about passing the

[02:06:09.640 --> 02:06:16.800]
chance, wow, the thought of that is just grotesque. 122 votes, what's your take on a black man,

[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:20.340]
the Daniel Jones who died in Cincinnati after that confrontation with police, which we've

[02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:27.200]
seen at video a thousand times already just today. 122 votes, they were defending themselves 33.

[02:06:27.720 --> 02:06:31.980]
They should have had taser guns 27, which is clearly the correct answer, even that caller before said.

[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:36.520]
They overreacted 27. He deserved it 26 and it's a racial thing.

[02:06:36.860 --> 02:06:38.460]
Nine, nine people said it's a racial thing.

[02:06:39.460 --> 02:06:42.040]
How about Robert Greeper voted for that just to be an asshole, you know?

[02:06:42.620 --> 02:06:44.920]
Hey Robert, you're an asshole man, though he's our best friend.

[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:47.940]
I didn't say we didn't like him, we like a lot of assholes.

[02:06:48.160 --> 02:06:50.260]
Why is that? Oh, he got us that tape?

[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:02.300]
That's okay, he doesn't care. He's not. He doesn't give a crap. He's got a lifetime job there,

[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:05.800]
as long as he and clearance are still doing it man. He's got a job for life. He don't give a

[02:07:05.800 --> 02:07:08.480]
crap. It is the fact that he hates Mo as much as everyone else does.

[02:07:08.620 --> 02:07:12.020]
Right, oh, we all know that. I'm sure in the back of his mind, whatever's left of it,

[02:07:12.140 --> 02:07:13.720]
Mo knows it. Absolutely. Sure he knows.

[02:07:14.920 --> 02:07:17.560]
See Mo, I want to, I know you're listening right now, okay?

[02:07:18.020 --> 02:07:21.920]
I'm listening. I want to say this to you, not as a friend because I need to test you like poison,

[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:25.800]
but just as one human being do another and I'm using the term very loosely in your case.

[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:32.660]
When you work at all of these different places in every single place that you go, virtually

[02:07:32.660 --> 02:07:38.740]
everyone that you work with and around and near despises you like poison, hates you and wishes

[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:44.600]
you an evil, evil faith. There must be something about you that causes it. It isn't accidental.

[02:07:44.900 --> 02:07:48.240]
It's not that the whole world is out of step and you're in line. So that's not the way it works.

[02:07:49.160 --> 02:07:53.780]
There must be something about you and you're evil, evil backstabbing behind the scenes,

[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:57.920]
scenes, machinations and threats and bullcraft. All of these things that cause people to hate you

[02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:02.680]
like poison. Absolutely. I'm just saying that. Now in his case, once you reach 90, it's probably

[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:08.140]
too old to change. But what's it? Huh? What's your reach? 89. It's not going to be generous.

[02:08:08.380 --> 02:08:15.520]
Newty's a tool to change. But I mean, good, Gali mismolly, when I can't even imagine working

[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:21.060]
in an environment when every single person around me detested me. Say, I can't imagine it.

[02:08:21.060 --> 02:08:25.600]
I know there's people in the station that don't like me hate me like poison. That's fine.

[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:30.320]
That's fine. It doesn't bother me because I'm not there most of the time anyway. But even if I am,

[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:35.420]
I'm not there to win a popularity contest. But if everybody despised me, it would be so uncomfortable.

[02:08:35.420 --> 02:08:41.740]
I feel so squeamish just being there. I couldn't show up every day. Right. I'd probably have

[02:08:41.740 --> 02:08:45.740]
haven't built me a studio out of town or something or out of the country, out of the country even.

[02:08:47.300 --> 02:08:51.180]
Overseas, maybe like an Amsterdam, maybe in Cologne, Germany. Let me say it again,

[02:08:51.260 --> 02:08:53.980]
the meal at Ruth Chris was outstanding. Thank you, Neil. You're welcome.

[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:59.960]
See, the Ruth Chris here, unlike, and I'm not knocking on ones there, but this one, the menu,

[02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:04.560]
has got more things on it. I don't know why that is. Ruth Chris here. It's far more diverse

[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:08.260]
and perverse the menu here. And I don't know if they do have the banana cream. Why they probably

[02:09:08.260 --> 02:09:11.880]
have that? Because I never get to serve to Ruth Chris because you got to be a real pig to

[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:16.340]
get dessert. Because of the fact that my friends ate the patit fillet and they didn't want to

[02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:19.500]
overdo it. And thank God they didn't because it was still cost an arm and leg. But,

[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:28.240]
and so we had dessert. Ginny had the, what's how they call that, sinfully chocolate,

[02:09:28.700 --> 02:09:33.960]
something like that. Oh God. Just looking at it made my blood sugar grow up to 420.

[02:09:34.760 --> 02:09:40.560]
Then that banana cream, I'm telling you, you should get that. Next time somebody takes you to

[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:46.160]
that lunch. Get that banana cream pie. It is, oh, cheese. It's beyond the, it's not, it's not, it's

[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:50.440]
that's just your plain pedestrian banana cream pie like cold. It's like heated and glazed. You

[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:55.260]
know, the bananas are like glazed and like the little toasting in her eyes. I'm eating. Wow.

[02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:59.000]
Corn here's arguments over slot machines in South Florida. Oh!

[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:04.860]
A proposal that South Florida voters decide if they want to allow slot machines that tracks

[02:10:04.860 --> 02:10:09.760]
and highlight frontons is good for the 2000 for a ballot lawyer told he's super in court yesterday.

[02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:14.480]
Florida's high court will review the proposed constitutional amendment to determine whether

[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:18.460]
the wording of the amendment is 30 voters and to ensure that it only deals with one subject.

[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:22.980]
The Citizens Initiative, pushed by a group called Floridians for Level Playing Feel,

[02:10:22.980 --> 02:10:26.780]
was organized by South Florida race tracks, must be approval by the court and get nearly

[02:10:26.780 --> 02:10:31.540]
a half a million signatures to go before voters next November. Local election officials have

[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:36.480]
notified the state that some 80,000 participants have been verified already. If approved statewide,

[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.540]
the measure would allow governing boards in Broward and Dade. You got this? If I'd

[02:10:41.540 --> 02:10:44.900]
already dade to ask voters if they want to allow slot machines that race tracks and highlight

[02:10:44.900 --> 02:10:50.440]
frontons, it would also earmark any tax revenue earned by the state to education. Florida voters have

[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:55.380]
rejected gambling measures three times in last quarter century. And of course, I'm about

[02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:59.480]
have the same group had their proposal struck down in 2002 because of the wording and had more

[02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:04.700]
than a single subject on it. Yadi, yadi, yadi. Stephen Grimes, a former Supreme Court justice

[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:08.760]
representing the sponsors, pulled the current justice is that the new version was designed to

[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:13.280]
satisfy the problem cited by the court last year. Opponents to the measure include,

[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:18.140]
oh wait a year this, opponents to the measure include the American Society for the Prevention

[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:24.360]
of Cruelty to Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, an anti-cicino group of

[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:30.180]
Bible thumping assholes called no casinos and opponents to Greyhound Racing called Grey2KUSA.

[02:11:31.220 --> 02:11:34.820]
Their attorney Mark Herring agreed that the new version may have dodged some of the flaws of

[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:38.780]
the original, but he also argued that the proposal qualified his classic log rolling,

[02:11:39.100 --> 02:11:43.520]
the practice of connecting a popular proposal such as school funding to a controversial proposal

[02:11:43.520 --> 02:11:49.020]
such as slot machines in order to win approval of the controversial item. The single subject

[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:53.980]
requirement is intended to shield voters from log rolling. Ever a roll a log? All the turn?

[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:59.720]
Drop on. All right, I think of that. Mel Gibson, he's rolling it. He puts passion on hold.

[02:12:00.180 --> 02:12:06.140]
Not passions, but passion. Mel Gibson has pulled his movie, The Passion of Christ from a Vatican

[02:12:06.140 --> 02:12:13.720]
sponsored film festival, all Vatican sponsored film festival, holy crap. Depicting the son of God

[02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:19.980]
on the screen because he says it's not ready. The unreleased but controversial movie about the

[02:12:19.980 --> 02:12:24.300]
final hours of the life of Jesus was scheduled to be shown yesterday to a select group of Roman

[02:12:24.300 --> 02:12:29.740]
Catholic officials as part of the Christ and the cinema festival. But Gibson had second thoughts

[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:33.120]
about some of the scenes and his re-editing the film, the movie producer Nick Hill wrote in

[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:38.560]
letter to the organizer Andrea Piersante. The former actors written in his co-producing the film said

[02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:42.300]
he'd be happy to schedule a preview in the Vatican once the movie is finished, the letter added,

[02:12:42.600 --> 02:12:46.800]
once the Holy Father's finished with the last altar boy. The festival screening was supposed

[02:12:46.800 --> 02:12:50.660]
to have been for a very restricted group to have included Cardinal Paul Pupard. I do like his

[02:12:50.660 --> 02:12:54.920]
mustard though. Head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, Archbishop John Foley,

[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:58.660]
president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications and various religious experts

[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:01.700]
from the Roman Catholic University's based in Roman Apartment of Parachute.

[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:10.980]
Organizer Piersante and Cardinal Dario Castrion Hoyos sounds like a spict to me. Prefect of the

[02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:14.660]
congregation for clergy is already viewed in earlier versions of the movie. The film is already

[02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:19.800]
coming for criticism from some Jewish and Roman Catholic groups who are concerned it will fuel anti-semitism.

[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:26.160]
Others including fundamentalist Christians and media names such as columnist Cal Thomas and

[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:31.320]
Jewish web personality Mad Drudge have said the film is beautiful and magical. You know it's

[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:35.400]
thinking a beautiful and magical misplugged. How does it feel to be sitting there? You self-hating

[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.380]
faggot looking in the mirror knowing that you're a sellout to the right wing and I'm going to say it

[02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:43.400]
again. Other people have had the balls to come forward and say, hey, guess what? I've been used

[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:47.920]
and abused. I have no conscience. You're a piece of crap. You're human garbage on two legs is what

[02:13:47.920 --> 02:13:52.160]
you are misplugged. I don't care if you get 50 billion hits today and you're sticking as colorless

[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:56.860]
website you're a piece of garbage. What are you trying to say? He sucks.

[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:07.660]
Know that the Lord even loves neo-rodgers. Go to hell.

[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:28.420]
Yeah. Little scum back won't get no pull roll. It's time to deep friendly boy now.

[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:36.960]
They got injections and a lethal. People are waiting for them on their own.

[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:44.480]
But I don't think that that's the way to go. No. I say we deep friendly boy now.

[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:48.640]
Okay. Let's send a deep friendly boy now.

[02:14:57.540 --> 02:14:58.020]
Oh.

[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.580]
It's time to deep friendly boy now.

[02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:04.260]
I think just like oh, Jay and Michael Jackson is the racial thing myself.

[02:15:04.680 --> 02:15:07.780]
Uh, 10 people say that about the Nathaniel Jones and Cincinnati.

[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:12.380]
159 votes. What's your take on a black man who died in Cincinnati after that confrontation

[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:17.520]
with Polis in a white castle parking lot? He probably should have got the order to go

[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:20.060]
don't you think it's an advanced in a right and drive through that's what that's for.

[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:25.800]
They were defending themselves 44. They overreacted 36. They should have had taser guns 35.

[02:15:26.200 --> 02:15:31.520]
He deserved it 34 and it's a racial thing. 10. 10 be saying that crap. A piece of Josh.

[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:36.600]
A bigger party. You heard of a piece of ass. This is a piece of junk. Now this is a really

[02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:43.380]
pressing story. Young woman saves sperm of dying husband. From the moment they met his young teens,

[02:15:43.380 --> 02:15:48.120]
Joshua Garvin city was going to marry Amanda Elliott, his sweetheart at Heritage High School in

[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.800]
littleton, Colorado. Last year to the light of both their families, the couple both in their early

[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:57.580]
20s married in a fantasy fulfilling wedding. The newlyweds worked hard with Joshua Plot as a

[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:01.900]
mechanic at a local Cardi Lyship and Amanda who was by Mandy working as a beautician.

[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:05.940]
From the beginning their sure goal was to start a family but before those dreams could come true

[02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:10.940]
tragedy struck. October 12th, Josh Garvin was riding his dirt bike when he crashed his blocks

[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:14.820]
from home. His wife had to be driving home and was one of the first people at the accident scene.

[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:20.000]
I pulled up to the side as I got closer. I saw Josh lying on the ground. Mandy told

[02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:23.980]
good morning America. He had flipped over to handle bars and spacked on his head. He lost control of

[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:28.060]
the bike. I said, babe, don't leave me and wait for the ambulance. Her husband was conscious and

[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:31.640]
even feisty. He didn't want to go to the hospital but Mandy insisted to turn out that Josh,

[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:36.980]
who was not wearing his helmet, suffered a severe brain injury. In the hospital he slipped in and

[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:41.120]
out of consciousness for about a week. Josh's brain swelled and while he knew his family he seemed

[02:16:41.120 --> 02:16:45.660]
as though he were unaware of his surroundings. Speaking as though he were in church or out dirt biking.

[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:52.320]
Speaking as though he was in church. Mandy Garvin recalled that her husband still looked

[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:57.140]
handsome even with a swollen head but then things got worked. Worst, surged relief pressure on Josh's

[02:16:57.140 --> 02:17:02.000]
brain did not go well and the 24-year-old was left brain dead. Mandy just 22 face-to-night

[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:05.420]
murder saying goodbye to the man she loved. But before I'm plugging the ventilator that was

[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:09.880]
keeping Josh alive, Mandy Garvin asked doctors at Swedish Medical Center for a husband's sperm be

[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:14.240]
harvested so that someday she might fulfill their dream of having a baby to go on with myself.

[02:17:14.400 --> 02:17:18.860]
I need a piece of Josh. Mandy Garvin said, I know that I have a piece of him but I need more.

[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:25.900]
But a Colorado sperm bank in an organ donation agency rejected a request. The sperm bank said it

[02:17:25.900 --> 02:17:30.080]
was against its licensing rules and that she needed donors written consent clearly impossible.

[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:34.120]
Josh Garvin's designation as an organ donor on his driver's license would not enough.

[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:38.960]
The organ donation agency said his mission was harvesting organs, not reproductive cells to save lives

[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:44.440]
had no specialists to help. Mandy Garvin was frustrated and upset. We were running out of time. She

[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:48.360]
said the hospital was great. The nurses were trying to find a place to store the sperm. The harvesting

[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:54.180]
wasn't a problem. It was the storage. Don't say anything. However, the family soon learned that a

[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:58.720]
California company would store the sperm and a urologist in Denver would do the procedure. Josh Garvin

[02:17:58.720 --> 02:18:03.840]
sperm and his organs were harvested and California cryobanks stored the sperm. Did they use international

[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:10.140]
harvester? Yes, they did. Squirt, squat. The tractor pull that you saw at the macaroni?

[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:13.260]
It's a detractable. It's not a funny story. It's very sad.

[02:18:13.460 --> 02:18:17.960]
You know? Oh well, at least his mammary lives on and that's right. That's a good part of

[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:25.520]
having him ending an otherwise very depressing disgusting story. 5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T

[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:30.360]
and Verizon wireless line. We got our big one and two hour coming up and then at two we got a

[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:35.240]
whole bunch of surprises for you. Curtis Stevenson from the Mad Dog at two, the booster for the

[02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:39.580]
Humper at four, Panther people at seven, Ottawa Senators at the Panthers. You better go to the

[02:18:39.580 --> 02:18:43.720]
game that I taught you hockey fans all the ten of you because we're going to lose that franchise.

[02:18:43.860 --> 02:18:46.760]
If you people don't start supporting the team and getting with it, okay? I'm just telling you

[02:18:46.760 --> 02:18:50.800]
that right now. Don't forget I told you that right here on this show. That franchise is going

[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.480]
on by by unless they start getting some real serious asses in the seats and I'm talking

[02:18:54.480 --> 02:18:57.460]
about people paying for the tickets. Now free loaders like me.

[02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:01.580]
Although somebody paid for mine anyway. W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:02.880]
Which budget is for?

[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:08.240]
No, no, no, no. Yeah, your calls are for me. You're pathetic. You're tragic. Get a new voice.

[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:11.980]
Come up with something original, okay? Like, like that would be good. You're tragic.

[02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:20.060]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Whatever the hell it is. Man.

[02:19:20.800 --> 02:19:21.820]
W-Q-I-M.

[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:23.320]
Hey Neil, how are you?

[02:19:23.520 --> 02:19:24.000]
Okay sir.

[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:29.480]
Hey, you know I noticed something. I'll bring to your attention. I noticed this big spin with our new

[02:19:29.480 --> 02:19:31.920]
American mascot, Toby Kees.

[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:34.800]
What is it?

[02:19:35.220 --> 02:19:37.600]
Toby Kees. You have the guy on the Ford commercial.

[02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:39.620]
Yeah, they're right winged. Asked what about him.

[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:45.660]
Yeah, I will basically I never heard of him until he was like high five and with Dan

[02:19:45.660 --> 02:19:50.720]
Rather and George Bush. Yeah, well he's the right wing Yahoo country assholes. What he is.

[02:19:50.720 --> 02:19:53.120]
And I figured and I was watching his board.

[02:19:53.460 --> 02:19:55.140]
And I was watching his board.

[02:19:55.720 --> 02:19:56.120]
And I was watching his board.

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:56.120]

[02:19:56.120 --> 02:19:58.080]
Yeah, he's getting the NASCAR vote. But not from Joe Castello.

[02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:04.940]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T, the NASCAR vote. Oh god. Don't get me started on that crap man.

[02:20:05.100 --> 02:20:06.640]
Go ahead. Don't get me started. Yeah.

[02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:08.260]
Boy.

[02:20:09.940 --> 02:20:12.340]
The US doesn't, they won't even let that crowd into entry.

[02:20:14.180 --> 02:20:17.740]
I remember you saw them old beat up cars. There was an accident, but nobody got hurt.

[02:20:17.780 --> 02:20:19.340]
Eh? How many QAM?

[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:20.600]
QAM, hello.

[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:23.700]
How I think there's a homo sexual.

[02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:25.160]
WQAM.

[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:27.060]
Hi, what did it talk to Neil?

[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:28.620]
Sounds like Sunny Fox.

[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:29.860]
Neil.

[02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:31.220]
Is this Sunny Fox?

[02:20:31.700 --> 02:20:32.260]
No, it's not.

[02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:33.640]
Oh, you sound just like him.

[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:35.260]
The old Tony Fox.

[02:20:37.740 --> 02:20:39.040]
And old washed up DJ.

[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:40.620]
Well, it happens.

[02:20:40.980 --> 02:20:41.540]
You know, it does.

[02:20:41.780 --> 02:20:42.240]
Who's that?

[02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:45.040]
Go ahead. Speak to him.

[02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.200]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:48.200]
You had a call earlier.

[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:51.060]
It said something about no member of Congress.

[02:20:51.260 --> 02:20:52.980]
Like their children are serving.

[02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:55.880]
There is only one and he's a Democrat.

[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:57.600]
Who's that?

[02:20:58.000 --> 02:20:59.680]
Senator Tim Johnson from South Dakota.

[02:20:59.880 --> 02:21:01.480]
His son has been the 101st Airborne.

[02:21:01.660 --> 02:21:03.000]
He was a dentist and a fan.

[02:21:03.880 --> 02:21:06.020]
And he shipped states out for the house.

[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:08.300]
He's last year and then he, I think he's back in Iraq.

[02:21:09.520 --> 02:21:12.700]
So, you know, I mean, I don't mean there is, you know,

[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:14.420]
be it dick about correcting in the actor.

[02:21:14.480 --> 02:21:15.200]
No, that's okay.

[02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.660]
It figures that the only one is actually certain.

[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:19.520]
I think the point he was about here is well taken though.

[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:21.860]
And that is that none of the grand sons are the sons of people

[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:23.920]
like Rumsfeld and Cheney, all these other grey robbers.

[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:25.800]
No, they're up here and they're over there fighting.

[02:21:26.240 --> 02:21:28.760]
That's not a control in the Democratic population, my friend.

[02:21:29.880 --> 02:21:31.800]
You know, going them off in wars.

[02:21:32.420 --> 02:21:32.620]
So.

[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:34.380]
Okay, probably every day.

[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:35.020]
Good luck to us.

[02:21:35.720 --> 02:21:36.900]
I'll say it again, voids.

[02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:39.720]
You get that word that five letter word draft going again.

[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:41.640]
And boy, all of a sudden the whole generation of people

[02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:43.460]
who couldn't give a flying crap less right now.

[02:21:43.660 --> 02:21:44.740]
They'd be saying, oh, wait a minute.

[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:46.700]
Maybe we ought to start paying attention to all of this.

[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:50.720]
DRAFT, a five letter word that'll,

[02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:52.060]
then they will fear you, man.

[02:21:52.100 --> 02:21:52.920]
I'm sorry about that right now.

[02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:54.820]
Then people start peeing in their pants.

[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.660]
1251 at 560 QAM.

[02:21:57.780 --> 02:21:59.540]
My life and local.

[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:03.160]
This is 430560 QAM.

[02:22:06.180 --> 02:22:06.740]
1254 now.

[02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:08.480]
You notice how I like back myself into a corner.

[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:10.080]
But it was 24, but that's okay.

[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:12.380]
No, but this was by interior, believe it.

[02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:12.840]
No, no.

[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:15.740]
Well, I just forgot about our big one, two hours.

[02:22:15.900 --> 02:22:19.960]
But that's okay because it gives me time to like sneak a couple of things in here.

[02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:23.620]
Good because on Monday, we've paid, now you may reference to this before,

[02:22:23.660 --> 02:22:24.760]
but a lot of people haven't seen this.

[02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:28.120]
A comment last year by the Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on the hunt for a

[02:22:28.120 --> 02:22:31.380]
racks weapon to mass destruction was awarded the foot in mouth prize

[02:22:31.380 --> 02:22:33.480]
Monday by Britain's Plain English campaign.

[02:22:34.900 --> 02:22:37.560]
Rumsfeld, renowned for his uncompromising, tough talking,

[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:40.920]
received the prize for the most baffling comment by a public figure.

[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:45.680]
Reports that say something hasn't happened are always interesting to me because as we know,

[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:48.560]
there are known knowns, there are things we know we know,

[02:22:48.780 --> 02:22:49.840]
Rumsfeld, who are news briefing.

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:51.940]
We also know there are known unknowns.

[02:22:52.540 --> 02:22:54.940]
That is to say, we know there are some things that we do not know,

[02:22:55.200 --> 02:22:58.660]
but there are also some unknown unknowns, the ones we know we don't know.

[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:01.980]
Now let me say it again, but the ones we don't know we don't know.

[02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.120]
Oh, that's great.

[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:04.260]
I don't know.

[02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:06.920]
The ones we don't know we don't know.

[02:23:07.480 --> 02:23:09.780]
John Lister spoke to him for the campaign, which strapped

[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:12.200]
that public information delivered in clear straightforward English,

[02:23:12.720 --> 02:23:15.600]
said we think we know what he means, but we don't know if we really know.

[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:22.060]
Although Rumsfeld's comments were made at a news briefing in February 2002,

[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:23.580]
they were nominated for this year's award.

[02:23:24.040 --> 02:23:27.440]
Rumsfeld, whose boss president bushes often singled out by language critics

[02:23:27.440 --> 02:23:29.880]
for a sometimes unusual use of English,

[02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:31.760]
defeated actor turned politician,

[02:23:31.940 --> 02:23:33.600]
Arnold Schwarzenegger for the Booby Prize.

[02:23:34.240 --> 02:23:35.940]
The new California governor said,

[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:39.280]
I think they've gave marriage to something that should be between a man and a woman.

[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:41.980]
That's what Arnold said.

[02:23:42.880 --> 02:23:43.360]
I don't get it.

[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:45.640]
Previous holders of the award include US actors,

[02:23:45.740 --> 02:23:48.140]
Lister Silverstone, and British Chancellor Gordon Brown.

[02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:51.240]
Last year's winner was actor Richard Geer.

[02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:52.700]
Y'all.

[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:53.560]
Wow.

[02:23:54.700 --> 02:23:55.700]
How do you like that?

[02:23:55.700 --> 02:23:57.600]
Oh, they didn't tell you what they said.

[02:23:58.220 --> 02:23:58.480]
No.

[02:23:59.180 --> 02:24:00.920]
Oh, I mean, I'm sure there was a lot more than that,

[02:24:01.040 --> 02:24:02.980]
but it's, you know, when it doubts, just chop it out.

[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.680]
We don't have a whole whole day here to fart around with that.

[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:06.760]
We only got like three and a half minutes

[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:09.160]
until I big one or two.

[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:11.100]
We might even take another call or two if we had them.

[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:11.900]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[02:24:12.580 --> 02:24:12.860]
Hello.

[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:14.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:15.160 --> 02:24:15.940]
Hi, is this George?

[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:16.720]
Yeah.

[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:17.820]
Hey, George.

[02:24:18.100 --> 02:24:18.920]
It's Billy from Shulers.

[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.220]
Hey, Billy, how are you?

[02:24:20.500 --> 02:24:21.200]
Good. How you doing?

[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:21.800]
Pretty good.

[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:23.420]
Hey, I just wanted to ask you that.

[02:24:23.420 --> 02:24:27.820]
Did you guys ever find another distributor for Champion Light?

[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:30.600]
I hadn't heard you mention that in a while.

[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:33.240]
Delights in Westbroker, one of our sponsors,

[02:24:33.380 --> 02:24:33.940]
has got it again.

[02:24:33.980 --> 02:24:35.780]
I don't know who the distributor is, but Delights can tell you.

[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:36.600]
Okay.

[02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:36.960]
Oh, no.

[02:24:37.220 --> 02:24:39.600]
I just wanted to find out an outlet because I found another one

[02:24:40.460 --> 02:24:41.740]
in Ford Lauderdale.

[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:42.400]
Right.

[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:47.420]
It's Chesapeake Bagel over there on commercial and East 15th Avenue.

[02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:48.180]
Okay.

[02:24:48.800 --> 02:24:49.200]
Do you want to see that?

[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:50.240]
But they're back in business.

[02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:51.320]
What's that?

[02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:53.260]
I say they're back in business, Champion Light.

[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:54.200]
Oh, okay.

[02:24:54.300 --> 02:24:55.400]
I didn't know they were out.

[02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:56.040]
Yeah.

[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:57.020]
Okay.

[02:24:57.620 --> 02:24:58.100]
All right.

[02:24:58.280 --> 02:24:59.160]
Hey, I get a package.

[02:24:59.320 --> 02:25:02.560]
I'm just sending off the photo from Amsterdam too.

[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:07.060]
So, uh, also I wanted to send you guys a check for the, uh,

[02:25:07.780 --> 02:25:08.360]
the, uh,

[02:25:08.720 --> 02:25:09.540]
abandoned pepper rescue.

[02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:10.220]
Yeah.

[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:11.220]
Do I just make it out to them?

[02:25:11.660 --> 02:25:11.900]
Yeah.

[02:25:12.300 --> 02:25:12.660]
Okay.

[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:13.360]
Great.

[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:13.700]
Thanks.

[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:14.380]
Thanks a lot, Billy.

[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:15.320]
Talk to you soon.

[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:15.900]
See you.

[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:17.300]
Who was that, George?

[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.400]
Uh, Billy from Shulers.

[02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:19.180]
Apparently.

[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:23.220]
Oh, I thought I always liked Shulers even though they do have that, uh,

[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:24.140]
menu on a football.

[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:25.600]
Hey, I got news for you.

[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:26.540]
I'm sure it's very fine.

[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:27.700]
A Humper who knows his meat.

[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:28.860]
He said it's excellent.

[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:31.120]
But I, I just, I'm just a Ruth's Chris guy.

[02:25:31.140 --> 02:25:31.860]
It's all I can tell you.

[02:25:32.460 --> 02:25:33.860]
I mean, what's not to like, right?

[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:35.200]
Broccoli.

[02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:37.520]
In addition to which we don't have no Shulers restaurants in Toronto.

[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.100]
Well, we do have a Ruth Chris in a Hilton hotel right in the middle of downtown.

[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:41.720]
And it's a pretty damn good.

[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:44.380]
It was damn good last night.

[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:44.880]
Remember damn.

[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:45.200]
I'm sorry.

[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:45.820]
You missed it.

[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:47.340]
God, he would have loved that.

[02:25:48.340 --> 02:25:50.540]
A steak that would have just put you into orbit

[02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:53.000]
that fantastic banana cream pie for dessert.

[02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:55.320]
There was stuffed mushrooms with crab meat.

[02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.280]
There was fantastic sauteed mushrooms with the steak.

[02:25:58.500 --> 02:25:59.500]
Oh my God.

[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:01.600]
Anyway, yeah.

[02:26:01.620 --> 02:26:04.260]
Oh, I can't feed the whole world, you know.

[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:05.540]
I haven't seen these people.

[02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:07.640]
And you notice nobody even called about that today.

[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:08.200]
About that.

[02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:10.300]
Well, I mean, it's a good topic though.

[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:12.060]
We've talked before on the show about, you know,

[02:26:12.220 --> 02:26:14.240]
class reunions, do people go, they, you know,

[02:26:14.300 --> 02:26:16.220]
have a nervous breakdown about the, what they,

[02:26:16.420 --> 02:26:19.680]
see, I didn't care what anybody looked like because we're all in even footing, you know.

[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:21.560]
And I'll say it again.

[02:26:21.560 --> 02:26:24.060]
I think I looked a little bit younger than them and they, they look fine.

[02:26:24.160 --> 02:26:24.840]
I'm not knocking them.

[02:26:24.920 --> 02:26:25.860]
They were there nice people.

[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:28.740]
But it's not like, like, I look like a

[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:32.420]
daughtering old man like you're always seen and they look like a teenager, something like that.

[02:26:34.060 --> 02:26:36.300]
194 votes on here and you notice he didn't say a word.

[02:26:36.880 --> 02:26:39.160]
You notice that Josh, when I said he's always sent him a daughtering old man

[02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:40.780]
because he knows that Saturday is his birthday.

[02:26:42.180 --> 02:26:45.460]
And whether or not he gets that usual birthday check from somebody,

[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:47.800]
probably depends on his response to that.

[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:49.460]
So the less said the better.

[02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:50.380]
You're a spring chicken.

[02:26:50.980 --> 02:26:51.380]
Yeah.

[02:26:51.680 --> 02:26:51.900]
Hawk.

[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:55.180]
What's your take on the black man, the

[02:26:55.180 --> 02:26:58.700]
thank you Jones who died in Cincinnati after his confrontation with the police?

[02:26:58.960 --> 02:26:59.800]
196 votes.

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:02.700]
They were defending themselves 51.

[02:27:03.700 --> 02:27:05.660]
They should have had taser guns 49.

[02:27:06.300 --> 02:27:07.520]
He deserved it 44.

[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:08.760]
Now one, what does that mean?

[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:09.840]
I mean, I know I put it on there.

[02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:10.440]
What does that mean?

[02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:11.100]
He had a color.

[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:12.020]
He was a scumbag.

[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:12.560]
That's right.

[02:27:13.120 --> 02:27:14.620]
Are they overreacted 42?

[02:27:14.780 --> 02:27:15.740]
And it's a racial thing.

[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:18.440]
10 out of 196 votes.

[02:27:20.380 --> 02:27:21.140]
Well, I got a really good.

[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:23.020]
I got a bush bashing as we boring.

[02:27:23.200 --> 02:27:23.700]
You know, that's right.

[02:27:23.800 --> 02:27:24.340]
Off-read the cent.

[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:24.680]
Right.

[02:27:25.440 --> 02:27:26.280]
Americans who hate their president.

[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:28.460]
We had this on our website either today or yesterday.

[02:27:28.600 --> 02:27:29.140]
I believe yesterday.

[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:30.060]
Still on there.

[02:27:30.300 --> 02:27:32.220]
You can go back into the archives if you missed stuff on there.

[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:33.160]
It's really good and important.

[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:35.960]
But I just don't have time.

[02:27:36.940 --> 02:27:38.920]
Also your friend Alfonso Rodriguez Jr.

[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:40.300]
He waived extradition.

[02:27:41.940 --> 02:27:44.980]
So he's going to be sent to North Dakota with a banjo on his knee.

[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:46.160]
Okay.

[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:47.480]
With a Veneron is knee.

[02:27:47.480 --> 02:27:50.780]
I think we did a pretty good job there.

[02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:52.400]
We got all the we touched all the bases.

[02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:53.040]
We covered it all.

[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:56.960]
We had those horrible, horrible Dave Van Horen clips in those smart land spots.

[02:27:57.120 --> 02:27:57.880]
Let me say it again.

[02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.160]
All you Marlon people was very.

[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:00.760]
It's really a promising thing.

[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:03.020]
They're signing all the high pay talent again to bring them back.

[02:28:03.180 --> 02:28:03.940]
They're not pulling away.

[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:05.740]
And I think they're not just madling the team.

[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:06.980]
They're not doing all those things.

[02:28:07.120 --> 02:28:09.300]
But if you're going to run spots and try to get people out of there,

[02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:10.100]
please leave.

[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:11.460]
What's his name?

[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:13.380]
Maybe they hear peace off.

[02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:14.060]
Dave Van Boring.

[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.840]
He's an embarrassment to the human race.

[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:17.440]
It's not just the one to two hour.

[02:28:17.880 --> 02:28:18.820]
It's a phenomenon.

[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:23.300]
Oh, heard there is no Christmas in the silly middle east.

[02:28:23.660 --> 02:28:23.760]
No.

[02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:24.420]
No trees.

[02:28:24.580 --> 02:28:24.860]
No snow.

[02:28:25.060 --> 02:28:25.880]
No Santa Claus.

[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:27.560]
They have different religious beliefs.

[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:31.680]
They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday.

[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:35.800]
And so every December I go to the middle east.

[02:28:36.340 --> 02:28:40.100]
Hey, there, Mr. Muslims.

[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:41.640]
Merry fucking Christmas.

[02:28:41.960 --> 02:28:44.840]
Put down that book to Koran and hear some holiday wishes.

[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.140]
In case you haven't noticed,

[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:49.500]
if Jesus says, Bartite,

[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:52.860]
soak it off your knees and muzzle a massive fucking cell of rite.

[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:57.980]
There is no holiday season in India.

[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:02.380]
I've heard they don't hang out their stockings and that is just absurd.

[02:29:03.020 --> 02:29:04.380]
They never read a Christmas story.

[02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:06.060]
They don't know what Rudolph is about.

[02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:10.620]
And that is why in December I'll go to India and China.

[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:14.380]
Hi, there, Mr. Hinduist.

[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:15.780]
Merry fucking Christmas.

[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:18.800]
Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the bed.

[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:21.960]
They case you haven't noticed.

[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:23.340]
If Jesus says, Bartite,

[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:25.300]
soak it off your heath and Hinduism.

[02:29:25.640 --> 02:29:26.620]
Fucking cell of rite.

[02:29:28.660 --> 02:29:32.100]
Now I heard that in Japan everyone just lives in sin.

[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:35.500]
They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.

[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:38.860]
On December 20th, all they do is eat a cake.

[02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:43.840]
And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and cry.

[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:47.260]
Hi, there, Mr. Hinduist.

[02:29:47.500 --> 02:29:48.580]
Merry fucking Christmas.

[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:51.760]
God is gonna kick your ass you into the lake to take and scum.

[02:29:52.860 --> 02:29:54.480]
In case you haven't noticed,

[02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:55.820]
there's best of things to do.

[02:29:56.160 --> 02:29:57.620]
So let's all rejoice for Jesus' merit.

[02:29:57.840 --> 02:29:58.660]
Fucking Christmas you.

[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:02.340]
On Christmas Day,

[02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:05.700]
I travel around the world and say,

[02:30:06.500 --> 02:30:09.200]
now it's Christmas bonus and all you ACS-2.

[02:30:09.760 --> 02:30:12.040]
Merry fucking Christmas.

[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:15.180]
So yeah.

[02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:29.020]
Oh, it's still the rain.

[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:31.820]
Almost a night.

[02:30:35.700 --> 02:30:37.900]
Gonna change my mood.

[02:30:38.260 --> 02:30:39.160]
Gonna make a defense.

[02:30:39.660 --> 02:30:43.120]
Gonna be your wife.

[02:30:44.880 --> 02:30:47.580]
As I turn on the baby,

[02:30:47.860 --> 02:30:48.320]
oh,

[02:30:48.620 --> 02:30:50.540]
sing up my mood.

[02:30:51.060 --> 02:30:53.560]
This blues is blowing my mind.

[02:30:54.640 --> 02:30:57.000]
I'm talking to kids, my kids.

[02:30:57.520 --> 02:30:58.820]
Been alive in me.

[02:30:59.400 --> 02:31:01.100]
Can't deny you're my guide.

[02:31:01.420 --> 02:31:03.400]
Defending for the teddy.

[02:31:05.700 --> 02:31:07.340]
Gotta think for time.

[02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:09.740]
And plasticity lies.

[02:31:10.340 --> 02:31:12.380]
Come on, man, we sure.

[02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.060]
I follow it by tomorrow.

[02:31:16.820 --> 02:31:17.920]
Here it goes.

[02:31:18.760 --> 02:31:21.780]
I knew I know where I'll go.

[02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:24.100]
And the next thing you know,

[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:28.060]
I'm looking at the man in the prison.

[02:31:29.240 --> 02:31:32.640]
He's asking me to bend the way.

[02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:36.380]
And now I'm as good a thin,

[02:31:36.700 --> 02:31:37.940]
and he clear it.

[02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:39.280]
If you wanna make it world,

[02:31:39.620 --> 02:31:41.580]
I bet to please Michael Drop the soul,

[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:43.000]
and bend this way.

[02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:43.500]
Welcome.

[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:46.740]
Hey kids,

[02:31:47.160 --> 02:31:49.640]
Saturday morning TV is about to get a makeover.

[02:31:49.900 --> 02:31:51.960]
It's Queer Eye for the Popeye.

[02:31:52.860 --> 02:31:54.640]
Well, never be timbers.

[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:56.880]
You must be the fads-cphys.

[02:31:57.000 --> 02:31:57.980]
Go, go, go, go, go.

[02:31:58.540 --> 02:32:00.820]
Boy, it's gonna look at what he's wearing.

[02:32:01.380 --> 02:32:02.380]
Failure that fit.

[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:04.520]
So, where's the rest of the village people?

[02:32:05.480 --> 02:32:06.780]
I'm not gonna break this.

[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:09.400]
Queer Eye for the Popeye is the fab pives

[02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:11.140]
most animated project yet.

[02:32:11.240 --> 02:32:13.120]
Popeye, what would you like to prepare

[02:32:13.120 --> 02:32:14.940]
for your big dinner date with Olive Boy?

[02:32:15.020 --> 02:32:15.980]
Rather, rather,

[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:17.500]
I feel this spinach can,

[02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:18.700]
and it's gonna come out.

[02:32:18.940 --> 02:32:21.500]
There's only one thing that's good in the can, honey,

[02:32:21.720 --> 02:32:22.980]
and it ain't spinach.

[02:32:23.660 --> 02:32:25.340]
How about if we throw sweet peat in stash?

[02:32:25.600 --> 02:32:26.060]
Sweet peat?

[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:28.340]
Well, I looks like a cannibal.

[02:32:29.060 --> 02:32:30.240]
Wait until you see how

[02:32:30.240 --> 02:32:31.880]

[02:32:34.940 --> 02:32:36.020]
Okay, Popeye.

[02:32:36.300 --> 02:32:37.200]
Pop your eyes open.

[02:32:37.660 --> 02:32:37.660]

[02:32:38.320 --> 02:32:39.660]
Well, close me down.

[02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:41.680]
Well, hello, sailor.

[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:43.560]
Easy, fellas.

[02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.160]
It's just an expression.

[02:32:46.160 --> 02:32:47.660]
Queer Eye for the Popeye.

[02:32:47.800 --> 02:32:50.400]
Saturday mornings right after while Yukio were out.

[02:32:56.840 --> 02:32:57.680]
Oh, right.

[02:32:57.960 --> 02:32:59.100]

Blocking out your boat.

[02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:25.840]
George Bush is a liar.

[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:29.940]
It's point nine eleven for a global empire.

[02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:32.440]
George Bush is a liar.

[02:33:33.100 --> 02:33:36.440]

[02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:31.040]
George Bush is a liar.

[02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:32.280]

That's just about

Searching for our pieces for an assault

[02:37:29.360 --> 02:37:37.180]
Some people claim we got your spurs to blame and you're right

[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:40.800]
It's how George Bush is found

[02:37:56.440 --> 02:38:01.240]
You and I went to the bar we drank some whiskey from the jar

We got drunk all over town then I asked you to go down you go to

Now you're saying you're queasy it felt good just like it should but then it's done

[02:50:12.720 --> 02:50:15.240]

[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:09.580]
Here's the deal you have nothing loose

[02:51:09.580 --> 02:51:15.000]

[02:52:31.720 --> 02:52:33.840]
Spring of a food stand

[02:52:33.840 --> 02:52:34.960]
True

[02:52:35.720 --> 02:52:39.320]
The electronic monitoring device on your leg is impossible to break off

[02:52:39.320 --> 02:52:46.200]
But that won't stop you from spreading to the liquor store for a bottle of thunder bird in a carton of luckies

[02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:51.020]
If there's a fence you'll jump it if there's a bike you'll steal it

[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:56.900]
Just as long as you get back to the double wide when that damn thing starts to beat

[02:52:56.900 --> 02:52:58.940]
So we salute you

[02:52:58.940 --> 02:53:01.120]
Mr. House arrest guy

[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:02.660]
Your ankle bracelet

[02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:04.240]
Your parole officer

[02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:05.820]
And your mullet

[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:10.280]
You are a real American N****hole

[02:53:10.900 --> 02:53:12.600]
Now from random thoughts publishing

[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:15.700]
It's Ozzy Osborne's new children's book on tape

[02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:17.900]
Mother******** Goose

[02:53:17.900 --> 02:53:21.880]
Kids will love all their favorites done as only Ozzy can deliver

[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:24.640]
Like the classic Jack Sprat

[02:53:24.640 --> 02:53:28.740]
Jack Jack Sprat could eat no f***ing fat

[02:53:28.740 --> 02:53:30.600]
His wife could eat no name

[02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:33.720]
And so be Twix and both you see

[02:53:33.720 --> 02:53:36.020]
They f***ing lick the product clean

[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:39.380]
And the time was favorite three men in a tub

[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:45.340]
Robert Dub Dub three men in a tub

[02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:48.440]
And who do you think they be?

[02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:52.140]
The butcher, the biker, the candlestick maker

[02:53:52.140 --> 02:53:56.340]
She's s*** what the f*** are these three men doing in a f***ing tub together

[02:53:56.340 --> 02:54:00.520]
I'm surprised one of them wasn't a f***ing f***ing fat come man

[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:04.380]
Over 100 nursery rhymes interpreted and read

[02:54:04.380 --> 02:54:06.480]
By the prince of f***ing darkness

[02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:08.000]
Ozzy Osborne

[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:10.740]
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe

[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:14.020]
What the f*** she doing living in a shoe

[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:15.980]
This makes no sense at all

[02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:17.700]
Sarah! Sarah!

[02:54:18.960 --> 02:54:20.080]

There's a tape in it's her for sure

And naked as can be

[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:49.620]
Power shielding can take direction that's what we see

[02:55:49.620 --> 02:55:53.260]
And she's this right applicant

[02:55:53.260 --> 02:55:54.280]
And the rock

[02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:56.220]
Wow, come on, yay

[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:04.500]
She starts it all because herself on rings

[02:56:05.260 --> 02:56:09.380]
That's the best shield done

[02:56:09.380 --> 02:56:11.580]
Really loves to fall

[02:56:11.580 --> 02:56:16.460]
Yeah, but it's a shield done

[02:56:16.460 --> 02:56:18.760]
Really takes it all

[02:56:18.760 --> 02:56:25.460]
And that bad shield done is a party girl

[02:56:25.460 --> 02:56:29.820]
And now we need naked

[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:36.680]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:37.440]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:56:37.440 --> 02:56:39.200]
Let me really love to fall

[02:56:41.160 --> 02:56:44.360]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:46.400]
We really take it all

[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400]
Yeah

[02:57:58.420 --> 02:58:02.200]
I'm a ding-dong-banny man. I'm really dead.

[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:06.000]
I buy a radio any one I want. I don't care.

[02:58:06.420 --> 02:58:09.020]
But believe me, they make me flip my wig made a smelly green hair.

[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:12.260]
I got fired myself and even happens to the greets.

[02:58:12.580 --> 02:58:14.940]
Westwood once said you'll get out of here or else we break your legs.

[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:16.380]
So now I sit by the floor and I'm going to get out of here.

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:16.380]

[02:58:16.380 --> 02:58:17.860]
Oh, life's as good as it gets.

[02:58:18.500 --> 02:58:21.200]
With my paladin cocktail, placing bets on the gins.

[02:58:22.320 --> 02:58:24.840]
Paradise. Paradise. I don't kiss nobody's hair since paradise.

[02:58:25.520 --> 02:58:28.700]
Go go go go. I'll be sure I've enough screwkins when I get the gins.

[02:58:28.880 --> 02:58:30.780]
But the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants.

[02:58:31.080 --> 02:58:31.760]
How long does it take?

[02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:32.840]
Kelsi calling the plate.

[02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:35.140]
It was just a little thought. So what I left this day.

[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:37.560]
I think that's funny one. I'm not gonna sell it buddy.

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:39.820]
I can do what I want. What the management loves me.

[02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:42.060]
Can I tell you something? Oh, something you ought to know.

[02:58:42.200 --> 02:58:44.380]
But the longest time I wanted you to be my home.

[02:58:44.380 --> 02:58:46.740]
You wipe my tight bow. Now I have straight bow bow.

[02:58:47.340 --> 02:58:47.440]
Oh, no.

[02:58:47.440 --> 02:58:48.240]
Oh, pretty with bow.

[02:58:48.240 --> 02:58:49.280]
I won't take no for an answer.

[02:58:49.540 --> 02:58:49.600]
Put it out.

[02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:50.620]
But it's bad.

[02:58:50.700 --> 02:58:51.160]
Not you.

[02:58:51.460 --> 02:58:52.160]
Get out of here.

[02:58:52.320 --> 02:58:52.480]
Put it out.

[02:58:52.880 --> 02:58:54.000]
Put it out.

[02:58:54.980 --> 02:58:55.740]
Put it out.

[02:58:56.120 --> 02:58:57.420]
Put it out.

[02:58:57.420 --> 02:58:58.580]
Put it out.

[02:58:59.020 --> 02:59:00.160]
Put it out.

[02:59:04.700 --> 02:59:08.840]
No one embodies the holiday spirit better than Gordon Lightfoot.

[02:59:09.780 --> 02:59:10.280]
Really?

[02:59:10.280 --> 02:59:10.900]
You bet.

[02:59:11.500 --> 02:59:14.080]
And now Gordon Lightfoot takes his best known song,

[02:59:14.420 --> 02:59:16.120]
The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,

[02:59:16.380 --> 02:59:20.540]
and Giff wraps it around your favorite carols to create his new holiday album,

[02:59:21.060 --> 02:59:22.760]
Gordon Lightfoot sings Christmas.

[02:59:23.300 --> 02:59:26.520]
You better watch out and you better not cry.

[02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:28.540]
You better not cry.

[02:59:30.440 --> 02:59:35.740]
Yes, Gordon Lightfoot is coming to town with a sleilot of songs like this.

[02:59:35.740 --> 02:59:42.400]
The first day of Christmas, my true love, give me a heart, raise it in the face.

[02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:46.420]
It's Gordon Lightfoot sings Christmas,

[02:59:46.880 --> 02:59:51.240]
and you'll want a beat-a-market drum when you hear his rendition of the little drummer boy.

[02:59:51.520 --> 02:59:55.560]
Who come later will be heard of Oop-Oop-Oop-Oop.

[02:59:55.560 --> 02:59:59.500]
Play a new born king to see the love of Oop-Oop-Oop-Oop.

[02:59:59.540 --> 03:00:02.920]
Gordon Lightfoot has compiled the holiday music collection.

[03:00:02.920 --> 03:00:05.620]
And you'll wish with sync to the bottom of Lake Superior.

[03:00:05.900 --> 03:00:10.600]
Take the hoes with the holy poly-

[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:10.600]

[03:00:10.600 --> 03:00:10.920]

[03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:12.760]

[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:12.920]
poly-

[03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:19.500]
Your friends and family will pray for a silent night when you put on Gordon Lightfoot sings Christmas.

[03:00:21.900 --> 03:00:23.640]
Return to Santa

[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:27.400]
Return to Santa

[03:00:27.400 --> 03:00:31.580]
I got a sweater from my grandma

[03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:35.360]
It was pink and black

[03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:39.100]
But don't worry be a heartbeat

[03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:42.600]
With printed on it back

[03:00:42.600 --> 03:00:43.780]

[03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.160]

[03:01:13.900 --> 03:01:16.060]
Return to Santa

[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:19.860]
Who needs this truck

[03:01:20.860 --> 03:01:23.600]
But this is Christmas

[03:01:24.860 --> 03:01:27.160]
But really it's done

[03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:28.780]
He wrote a bonnet

[03:01:28.780 --> 03:01:30.980]
Return to Santa

[03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:34.860]
Don't need to be rude

[03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:38.880]
But this is Christmas

[03:01:40.860 --> 03:01:42.620]

[03:01:47.860 --> 03:01:49.140]
Return to Santa

[03:01:49.140 --> 03:01:49.560]
What's the deal?

[03:01:49.640 --> 03:01:50.580]
What's shocking news?

[03:01:52.240 --> 03:01:54.200]
That's the smoking gun

[03:01:55.580 --> 03:01:57.660]
Wow that is unbelievable

[03:01:57.660 --> 03:01:59.840]
We got the Curtis Stevens

[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:02.160]
He has no slouch

[03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:03.480]
And we got the booster

[03:02:05.980 --> 03:02:08.020]
He's getting dressed in pants today

[03:02:09.560 --> 03:02:11.280]
And we got the Panther game

[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:13.100]
All of that stuff is starting with a pregame at 7 o'clock

[03:02:13.100 --> 03:02:14.120]
Go to the arena tonight

[03:02:14.120 --> 03:02:15.080]
Okay you ought to go to

[03:02:15.080 --> 03:02:16.920]
Everybody should be going and support the Panthers

[03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:17.440]
Come on

[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:20.280]
Let's go

[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:21.800]
We're gonna lose our hockey team, Danit

[03:02:21.800 --> 03:02:22.640]
If you don't get with it

[03:02:22.640 --> 03:02:24.040]
Hey you know what's that time of the year again

[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:25.840]
Everybody's gonna be stopping by your home for the holidays

[03:02:25.840 --> 03:02:27.560]
Not too late to call dry concepts

[03:02:27.980 --> 03:02:30.340]
And read your carpets of all the germs and schmutz

[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:31.360]
That's sitting deep in here

[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:32.740]
That they can't I cannot spy

[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:34.360]
Take care of those carpets

[03:02:34.360 --> 03:02:36.360]
Clean them fast and clean it right by calling my good friends

[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:37.040]
And dry concepts

[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:40.000]
The only people in the world who dry clean your carpets

[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.920]
So don't trust anybody else because nobody can do it like they can

[03:02:42.920 --> 03:02:45.700]
That's why I've been using dry concepts for over 20 years in my home

[03:02:46.100 --> 03:02:48.320]
When you finish carpets smell lemony fresh

[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:49.360]
It looks just like brand new

[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:50.320]
They're drying a couple of hours

[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:53.580]
And you're ready to rock and roll for all your holiday traffic in no time at all

[03:02:53.580 --> 03:02:54.380]
So call today

[03:02:54.380 --> 03:02:57.420]
Ask the folks at the dry concept to put you understand by list

[03:02:57.420 --> 03:03:01.580]
And you can say 15% off the regular already low reasonable price of that job

[03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:04.380]
And don't forget they give you a written guaranteed price up front

[03:03:04.380 --> 03:03:06.340]
Before any worth that you have them do for you

[03:03:06.340 --> 03:03:07.940]
You have enough to worry about during the holidays

[03:03:07.940 --> 03:03:09.700]
So leave your carpets to dry concepts

[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:12.740]

It's launching fun for everyone.

[03:08:00.120 --> 03:08:02.440]
NYPD Blue, the Christmas special.

[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:06.220]
Tonight, right after Luther Campbell's Christmas Carol on ABC,

[03:08:07.620 --> 03:08:09.060]
147. Here's some depressing news.

[03:08:09.240 --> 03:08:10.840]
I don't want to say the American public are stupid,

[03:08:10.840 --> 03:08:11.500]
but you know what?

[03:08:11.700 --> 03:08:12.940]
What? They're stupid.

[03:08:13.120 --> 03:08:13.180]
Oh.

[03:08:13.960 --> 03:08:16.720]
President Bush is standing with the public has improved since his surprise

[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:19.680]
thanks, giving trip to Iraq amid signs of a stronger economy

[03:08:20.180 --> 03:08:22.920]
and following congressional passage of prescription drug benefit

[03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:23.560]
under Medicare.

[03:08:23.700 --> 03:08:24.940]
You know the one that's going to screw everybody?

[03:08:25.040 --> 03:08:25.320]
Yeah, I know that.

[03:08:25.320 --> 03:08:25.980]
Presently, you know folks.

[03:08:26.840 --> 03:08:29.700]
Bush's job approval was at 61% of the National

[03:08:29.700 --> 03:08:32.540]
and in burgulations survey conducted four days after the holiday,

[03:08:32.820 --> 03:08:35.440]
up from 56% during the four days before Thanksgiving.

[03:08:36.060 --> 03:08:38.940]
Disapproval of the president dropped from 41 to 36%

[03:08:38.940 --> 03:08:40.900]
according to poll released yesterday.

[03:08:42.220 --> 03:08:44.620]
Bush is visibly the troops in Baghdad thanksgiving.

[03:08:44.800 --> 03:08:46.960]
I was a move that even one praise from political opponents.

[03:08:47.400 --> 03:08:50.540]
We need political opponents public opinion about Bush personally

[03:08:50.540 --> 03:08:54.180]
also improved during the four day post holiday span with an increase in the new number

[03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:58.500]
who view in favorably from 65 to 72%.

[03:08:59.440 --> 03:09:01.020]
Oh my god.

[03:09:01.020 --> 03:09:02.240]
Oh my god.

[03:09:02.240 --> 03:09:06.760]
Republican shifted from 83% favorable view of Bush personally to 94%

[03:09:06.760 --> 03:09:09.460]
Democrats 46 to 55%.

[03:09:09.460 --> 03:09:12.580]
Public opinion on the war in Iraq did not shift does significantly.

[03:09:12.840 --> 03:09:15.700]
However, people about evenly split on whether the war in Iraq was worthwhile

[03:09:15.700 --> 03:09:17.220]
before the holiday and again after.

[03:09:18.300 --> 03:09:19.660]
It goes to show you man.

[03:09:20.980 --> 03:09:23.340]
All it takes is a little one little dog and pony show.

[03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:24.280]
Yeah, man.

[03:09:24.380 --> 03:09:24.960]

[03:09:25.140 --> 03:09:25.720]
He the man.

[03:09:28.280 --> 03:09:31.160]
I hate to say it, but there ain't no Chinatowns chance in hell.

[03:09:31.160 --> 03:09:34.320]
You see barring some miracle or you know, Chinatowns chance in hell.

[03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:36.760]
The his week need opponents have got a shot.

[03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:39.420]

[03:09:53.120 --> 03:09:53.640]

We're like to like the lower legs and the shorter.

[03:09:55.740 --> 03:09:57.320]
Now, it didn't harm any of his internal organs.

[03:09:57.500 --> 03:09:58.480]
So the cops didn't kill him.

[03:09:58.540 --> 03:09:59.080]
So they say.

[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:01.440]
Would you expect otherwise?

[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:02.840]
No.

[03:10:04.080 --> 03:10:04.980]
It's a lot of luck.

I'm so cold I can't licks him.

[03:12:00.920 --> 03:12:04.500]
Let's be called it zero baby.

[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:10.900]
And I cannot feel my thoughts.

[03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:12.600]
There's no more yelling here.

[03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:24.400]
There's a tingling in my fingers and my pride that parts are broken.

[03:12:28.260 --> 03:12:34.720]
Oh my nose is about to fall off.

[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:42.800]
There's a cloud every time that I call and my hands are blue.

[03:12:44.220 --> 03:12:46.000]
They are turning on.

[03:12:47.000 --> 03:12:52.940]
They might have you take my thoughts.

[03:12:55.380 --> 03:12:58.920]
Let's be called it zero baby.

[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:05.400]
I can barely move my mouth.

[03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:11.680]
I'm a red hot black tin lover.

[03:13:12.680 --> 03:13:19.000]
But first I need to be thought out.

[03:13:19.680 --> 03:13:25.400]
Yes I need to be thought out.

[03:13:26.480 --> 03:13:31.220]
That's because it's zero.

[03:13:32.320 --> 03:13:33.640]
That's it for you.

[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:55.880]
Every time I have you look at the floor.

[03:13:55.900 --> 03:13:57.800]
I can't upload it.

[03:13:57.980 --> 03:14:00.200]
How much peace, Lord's heart.

[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:03.880]
All that you'll gain, brought in this brain.

[03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:08.240]
Inside the door, nothing else remains.

[03:14:08.240 --> 03:14:11.120]
The name of the name of the confident.

[03:14:13.420 --> 03:14:19.820]
That's why George always Lord, he has no name of the confident.

[03:14:22.020 --> 03:14:26.840]
He bought a team to inhale the third day's life.

[03:14:34.440 --> 03:14:39.020]
He was born into money but he's so kind and dumb.

[03:14:40.300 --> 03:14:43.340]
Without his evil it'd be a homeless bum.

[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:47.780]
Life of the party is college days.

[03:14:48.160 --> 03:14:54.360]
Left it with two cells for a brain and a baby positive.

[03:14:57.060 --> 03:15:00.740]
That's the reason he's forever weak.

[03:15:01.020 --> 03:15:03.100]
He had no days of positive.

[03:15:05.580 --> 03:15:10.640]
I thought my ticket then I'm holding my passport tight.

[03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:48.540]
Oh right.

[03:16:10.140 --> 03:16:18.160]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:18.160]

[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:18.160]

[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:18.160]

[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:19.040]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:19.660 --> 03:16:24.340]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:32.200 --> 03:16:33.680]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:33.680]

[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:33.680]

[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:33.680]

[03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:33.700]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:33.700 --> 03:16:45.360]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:46.200 --> 03:16:53.900]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:53.900 --> 03:16:57.000]
I'm not going to be a good guy.

[03:16:57.260 --> 03:16:59.580]
You can do in the behind.

[03:16:59.620 --> 03:16:59.960]
Welcome.

[03:17:00.360 --> 03:17:04.540]
Put a cigar in her vagina she don't mind.

[03:17:06.900 --> 03:17:13.340]
All people feel that Hillary has been made a fool of by her husband.

[03:17:14.340 --> 03:17:19.640]
Feel that Hillary was wronged.

[03:17:19.640 --> 03:17:29.840]
Up in the linking bedroom, she was moaning, moaning, how gore was doing her with Bill's old bond.

[03:17:32.640 --> 03:17:36.460]
Bill's cigars and monikers, the Giner.

[03:17:38.620 --> 03:17:41.160]
She let's out of Giggle.

[03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:45.140]
Every fricking time he makes it, we go.

[03:17:45.140 --> 03:17:47.940]
Monika is not the pie.

[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:55.380]
You can do it in the behind, but us, car and her vagina she don't mind.

[03:17:55.980 --> 03:17:57.960]
Oh candy, you say?

[03:17:58.720 --> 03:18:02.580]
I'm a demon, yeah, just master, it's faster.

[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:10.340]
Oh yeah, what you gotta do is take a tip of real love.

[03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:14.600]
And put it in a frown, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

[03:18:15.020 --> 03:18:20.340]
Oh yeah, what you gotta do is take a tip of real love.

[03:18:21.100 --> 03:18:24.480]
I'd want the unnew house instead of following advice.

[03:18:24.760 --> 03:18:28.080]
Though it may not have been wise at least the house is nice.

[03:18:28.460 --> 03:18:31.860]
At the painting and rewiring the wall, but that's not all.

[03:18:32.140 --> 03:18:35.580]
On the hammock, like this they were read upon my balls.

[03:18:35.580 --> 03:18:36.500]
Ow.

[03:18:37.180 --> 03:18:40.920]
Bye bye bye!
