[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.380]
It's wider, you bastard.

[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.440]
And the mother's day, my mother calls me home.

[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.820]
She says my day's coming up and I don't want to stay at home.

[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.300]
And then she says I need something much more than a hard guy.

[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.060]
Listen up, cause the same very hard guy.

[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.760]
Home arrester running for the city of the world.

[00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.720]
It's a honesty and I don't want to cook now.

[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.020]
My mother told me, you better take me out.

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.840]
Don't forget, you better take me out.

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.460]
Take me out.

[00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.760]
If she said it's not a joke, no, my aim be it for me.

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.360]
Take me to a place that doors got some money.

[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.260]
If there's a mother's song, expect it from now.

[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.120]
I'm gonna move back in, please do now.

[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.460]
My mother told me, you better take me out.

[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.460]
Take me out.

[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.300]
You better take me out.

[00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.620]
Take me out.

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.380]
You better take me out.

[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.960]
Take me out.

[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.800]
Okay, I'm reaching back here in a fags machine.

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.400]
So just don't get into a cold sweat.

[00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.540]
I would play that song while you look at that.

[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.800]
You wanna play it now?

[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.360]
People see us everywhere.

[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.380]
They think you really care.

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.400]
No.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.280]
But myself I can't to see.

[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.540]
I know it's only make believe.

[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.300]
Are you sure?

[00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.140]
Get off your duck.

[00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.020]
Let's go and get on with your mouth.

[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.300]
I wanna know only prayer.

[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.660]
Is that someday you'll care?

[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.720]
My hopes, my dreams come true.

[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.300]
I know.

[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.140]
I know.

[00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.940]
I will never know how much I love you so.

[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.980]
My only prayer will be something that you care for me for the time.

[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.760]
God, did I walk you just before?

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.640]
Oh, Ryan.

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.920]
Your prayer hopes, my dreams come true.

[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.720]
My life, forget for you.

[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.380]
Okay, that's enough.

[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.840]
I know I don't wanna lose the audience.

[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.200]
I mean, it's not art kind of music.

[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.040]
But that's a great job.

[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.380]
That's it.

[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.120]
And didn't I tell you?

[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.920]
You were playing at this morning about 10 minutes ago.

[00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.840]
And I'm sitting here listening.

[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.860]
And I said, that sounds like duck.

[00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.300]
Right.

[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.840]
Wow.

[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.820]
That's our program director, definitely.

[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.780]
You obviously missed his calling in life.

[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.480]
It's not too late.

[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.720]
Now he's not really that old.

[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.360]
He's old, but not old like me.

[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.560]
If I was him, man, I'd be, well, plus that kind of music doesn't sell anymore.

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.320]
Yeah. I mean, Conway Twitty was good in his day, but that was 50 years ago.

[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.940]
45 anyway.

[00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.740]
But he's got a great voice.

[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.300]
He's been doing a karaoke stuff.

[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.660]
He's a neurotic guy because he's worked for Greg Read on and off for a long time.

[00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.480]
It's just like when we first came to the station.

[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.700]
Remember I was talking to the day about Hank is different now because I mellowed him out.

[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.320]
Yeah. But when we first came there, Hank was like a raving lunatic.

[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540]
And he was just brow beating.

[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.280]
Everybody just can't tanker us.

[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.780]
I mean, more so than ever.

[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.780]
Can't Hanker us?

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.440]
Hank Tanker us.

[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.820]
Hey, stupid.

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.620]
Yeah, he was Hank Tanker.

[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.880]
Well, he's still a little on the tanky side.

[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.160]
But at any rate, and I kind of like brought him back to Earth a little bit, bitched him out a little.

[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.560]
And the same with Muff.

[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.840]
And I was just saying about Muff before I got off in the Hank.

[00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.200]
What a good singer he is.

[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.000]
Now I was saying about how neurotic he is.

[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.220]
Oh, chicken and the egg thing was he neurotic first before he worked for Greg?

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.000]
Or did Greg make him into the basket case that he is today?

[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.360]
That's the obvious question.

[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.120]
He's got a great voice.

[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.320]
And keep in mind that was Tommy engineered that thing and it sounded pretty good.

[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.260]
You know, the karaoke deal.

[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.740]
But can you imagine like in a real recording studio?

[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.100]
Right.

[00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.860]
I mean, they can make a singer out of just about anybody when you come right down to it.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.620]
But I've heard Duff sing live and let me tell you.

[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:10.920]
But that's what I'm saying.

[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.960]
I was knocking him.

[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.580]
I was just saying.

[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.760]
But so with a little added accoutrement during the real studio, he could sound great.

[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.860]
He could hear.

[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.260]
He's wasting his time, you know, footloat around under the radar at the QAM.

[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.220]
By the way, Jim Sarni, you were an asshole.

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.280]
I'm not going to waste any time because a guilty took a career this morning.

[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.360]
Let's see.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.020]
Women are all bitches and what's the other thing we're supposed to say and screw you.

[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.520]
F you.

[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.000]
We all want to be outrageous and the rip women on QAM.

[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.380]
You know, you're such an asshole.

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.580]
I guess if I was to suck me as you, Sarni, and I'm not.

[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.140]
I'm ugly, but not even in your league.

[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.820]
Man, if I looked in the mirror and saw that every day, I'd probably be leashing out too, you know, which he's doing.

[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.580]
It's stupid as calm.

[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.100]
And speaking of the sun, sentlin' stupid people, Tom Jik is going to be up for etiquette tonight, 10.30.

[00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.620]
Now, maybe you want to call Tom, ask him, A, why there's no article on the radio ratings again, as usual, since he isn't town now.

[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:09.620]
B, how come neither one of the newspapers including the one that he works on has come central decided that it was a major story that Broward County Commission passed that resolution about the Patriot Act.

[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:19.780]
All of these things, you know, and about how 99% of what he writes about is about network TV shows and nothing about the local scene since I'm supposed to be out of touch sitting up here in Sars country, you know.

[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.300]
God, what a...

[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.620]
But they won't do it. I looked at the letters to the editor in both newspapers this morning.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:34.400]
And I went back a couple of days just to make sure, because this episode happened on Tuesday, with that commission meeting, was it Tuesday or Wednesday?

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.460]
Tuesday, huh?

[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.420]
Whatever it was, I went back a couple of days to make sure I didn't miss anything.

[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:47.080]
There wasn't one letter to the editor from anybody, or at least if there was, they didn't print it, either paper about the Broward Commission in that resolution against the Patriot Act.

[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.420]
Nothing.

[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.880]
So it's like it never happened. The Sun Sentinel puts out on their 11.59 at night on their website for one minute.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.400]
And then they bury a little tiny paragraph in a story about Miriam Elephant.

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.700]
And that's it.

[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.820]
It's a major new story.

[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:10.320]
Every other place in the country where they've had a similar resolution passed big front page story, it's all over the websites, not in South Florida.

[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.680]
Man, you talk about go stepping and pandering. What about it, Tommy? How you bald headed geek?

[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:21.880]
I hope they call his ass tonight and rip him a major ass go and they won't. But if anybody deserves it, it's a little Tommy jica.

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.560]
You're so off-fought out of it. And he'd say, well, gee, I wrote that story defending, Neil, I don't need no defending.

[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:34.340]
All he did was shine a spotlight that we let a word loose. There are any big deal like that. So it's like there's an issue about it. Is there any issue?

[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.800]
No.

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.900]
Did anybody say anything about it? No.

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.320]
And just in which he writes a whole column and he's afraid he's terrified because he's been so intimidated.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.480]
He's scared to death to put a wacky Jackie's name in there for your fear that he'll start up with them all over again.

[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.320]
Which I can understand that but nevertheless, why write the column in the first place if you don't want to put any names in there, Tommy?

[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.300]
You little pussy. He's been crucified, jica. That's his problem. Pusify.

[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.560]
We have one more movie pool today since we've been moving intensive all week, but we'll get to it momentarily.

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.780]
It's going to take me about an hour and a half to get through yesterday's poll result.

[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.180]
Before we do that, on the front page of the hero speaking of your local fish wrappers,

[00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.000]
you might draft the resolution to take control of a wacky oil. I just mentioned this in passing.

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.960]
The Bush administration's, oh, it's payday today, by the way, clearance. I just mentioned that in passing too.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.300]
Okay. So I sure hope there's something big and fat in my mailbox.

[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.200]
The Bush administration circulated a draft resolution among key security council members yesterday calling for the elimination of more than a decade.

[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:41.180]
Of international sanctions on Iraq and granting the United States broad control over the country's oil industry and revenues until a permanent Iraqi government is in place.

[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.480]
How many years could that be?

[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.260]
Yeah. I got to read that last part again.

[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:53.980]
Granting the United States broad control over the country's oil industry and revenues until a permanent Iraqi government is in place.

[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.260]
The resolution which was to be presented the 15 nation body today,

[00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:08.160]
the security council would shift control of Iraq's oil from the United Nations to the United States and its military allies with an international advisory board having oversight responsibilities, but little effective power.

[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:15.380]
A transitional Iraqi government which US authorities have said they hope to establish within weeks would be granted a consultative role.

[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:24.360]
The proposed resolution would give the Bush administration far greater authority over Iraq's lucrative oil industry than US officials have previously acknowledged.

[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.280]
And I should just point out what I do with that article.

[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:45.840]
Oh, we got that great story. You fact me about the toilets in France, such as they are, but newsmax.com, which is about as far to the right as you'll find any website in the universe.

[00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:50.440]
There we are got an article in here ripping Bush. See the right wingers are getting pissed off with him too.

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:57.980]
Didn't we have the thing on yesterday about the porn against her pissed off because they're not coming down the hard enough on the homos wasn't that on yesterday.

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:08.740]
Well, today and of course then the story came out last night on the news that the NRA is really foaming at the mouth because of the assault rifle bill and they have a ban on the assault weapons.

[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:15.580]
And so now they're just turning on them like a wreck because that's what the see if you get if you're not way over to the right.

[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.220]
If you're not 50 yards to the right of a till of the hunt, then you're not far enough to the right for these people.

[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:28.560]
So I will get into that briefly about the Bobby Graham's that evidence that Bush blew 9-11, but he ain't letting it off because of security reasons because well, look at him that.

[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:41.080]
I just mentioned that in passing to OK. So it's not just Connie Pinko left this liberals who are dismayed and disgusted with this administration with these goose stepping Nazis, but now from all sides he's getting it to which I say.

[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.420]
Yeah, anyway, nice job, though. He's damn good.

[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:51.780]
Well, can you imagine if he was as good as radio administration is is that singing he'd be we'd be we'd be number one half, you know.

[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.800]
What's the thing?

[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:58.480]
I thought I'm picking on him because he's going on vacation next week, but I'm just picking on him because he's going on vacation.

[00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:04.400]
He should be in the strong way we enthusiastically recommended that he watch Requiem for a dream. See.

[00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:11.060]
Especially that part where they start popping all them pills where she starts on the diet pills watch that very closely.

[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.380]
I just mentioned that in passing. I say that is a friend just watch that and keep an open mind. OK.

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.260]
See where I'm coming from. No, I get it.

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.820]
Hope he does. So George wanted to get happiness and they can't find a damn movie three places, three strikes.

[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:35.700]
Oh man. That's depressing. Yeah, that's unhappy. This can't find happiness. Of course, that's South Florida. It's a syndrome.

[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:44.600]
Can't find no happiness in South Florida. And don't get any of these movies we've been talking about all we can blockbuster because you probably get a watered down version and probably like a Bambi.

[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.520]
You'll be in the middle of the movie no matter what it is.

[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:52.860]
I heard that the version of the godfather they sell blockbuster instead of a horse's head. It's Bambi.

[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.700]
Yeah, well, I mean, even though it's, you know, protest. I think you chop Bambi's head off and put it in somebody's bed.

[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.300]
But nevertheless, it's more cutesy than that horse head, you know.

[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.960]
When it lightened up just a notch or two. Don't be going to blockbuster. OK, because they censor your movies.

[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:16.860]
Everything in America is censored now. You know what I'm saying? I don't care how many day go get any what grease ball. Come on. Come out of the woodware. Yeah.

[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:24.760]
Well, get the results yesterday's pool and no 600 movies on there that have the best or more shocking ending. It wasn't even close sixth sense.

[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:32.400]
I got to see that. Is there anywhere I can watch that? Do they have a thing on the DVD where you can like block out one actor actress that you don't want? No, that's not it. That would be great.

[00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:41.440]
Wouldn't that be dynamite? Oh, or it would change it to somebody else. I don't want to see Bruce Willis. He makes me physically ill. I have to go to the turret and he even puke and do all kind of things.

[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:53.120]
I just I just there's something about him. In fact, of all the people in the movies, he's the last one I would watch a movie in his Bruce Willis. He just even worse than Richard gear. Yeah, yeah, much worse than Richard gear.

[00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.360]
Worst what a thousand times worse. At least Richard's got an active.

You're not a fool, but her hair is gray

[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.640]
To me she looks just the same

[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.240]

[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.540]
She looks at me and smiles, use my baby day

I told her I turned 37 yesterday

[00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.520]
But you make me feel like I'm eight

[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.640]

917-560 WDQM

[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.300]
Happy Mother's Day to all you mothers out there

[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.980]
And where we should have a lot of mothers in this audience

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.280]
I can almost think about that

[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.540]
Anyway speaking of that

[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:22.160]
You know, that thing about Duff

[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.340]
I bet you we had people inside the building just shocked

[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.420]
Who had never heard him do the karaoke thing before

[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.980]
Right, we all saw it at that party

[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:28.560]
Heard him

[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.420]
But even so, I mean hearing that on the ear like that

[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:32.780]
Like a real professional record

[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.120]
In fact, I bet you Duff's got a lot of hidden talents that

[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.740]
The general public doesn't know about yet

[00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:40.060]
Anyway don't forget to join Joe Costello

I guess it all went

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.180]
About the tickets to the world of the All Star game

[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.680]
And the box

[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.400]
Well, I don't know I'm just reading what it says on here

[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.760]
And of course Miguel made it up so

[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.340]
Yeah, probably it's gonna be too good

[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:11.860]
Our hot couples contest is heating up the deadlines next

[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:12.800]
Third day May 15th

[00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.200]
And we're starting to get some interesting work in people now

[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.520]
You notice?

[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.720]
Yeah, I noticed

[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.740]
We really are

[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.660]
In fact, I'd say like the last three couples in a row have been pretty them

[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.920]
But again, I don't want to like influence the outcome

[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.760]
Which I won't but I will say this

[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.440]
What was her name Aaron's a lady friend?

[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.720]
Amy?

[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.860]
Amy, Amy and Aaron from yesterday

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.740]
So, being her boy emails me the pictures

[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.320]
And when he emailed me the pictures of Aaron, it says I think he's better looking than she is

[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.960]
And I say that with a flawless flawless in capital huge letters

[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.760]
A flawless record at heterosexuality

[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.740]
Is what he said

[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.340]
You think he was protesting too much?

[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.420]
No, just right

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.560]
And then of course they're both models and here's a bunch of pictures from muscle dreams

[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.920]
Magazine and of course you can click on the pictures naturally and enlarge them

[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.080]
And there's that one, well I can't I can't look at that during the show

[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:10.400]
Okay

[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.840]
You know the way to which picture I'm talking about?

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:15.600]
No

[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.500]
I mean what is that?

[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.760]
I mean don't say the word what you think it might be but what is that in there?

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.240]
How that can't be what I'm thinking it is

[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.760]
I don't know what you're talking about

[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.240]
I'm talking about the one that he's got that

[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.240]
The banana in his pants

[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.600]
We standing there with him buying with a shorts on?

[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.540]
Are you looking at these pictures now?

[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.600]
No, no I'm not

[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.800]
Yeah you are, it's the middle group there

[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.060]
The third one from that

[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:39.040]
I don't even know where you're looking

[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.920]
Oh okay, well forget about it, you don't need to be looking at him anyway

[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.340]
It's bad enough that you're here boy starting to hear him, his image is getting ruined too

[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.940]
Don't forget log out to our website, neo-riders.com

[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.420]

The male and male female and female or whatever

[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.180]
A boy and his dog, not just a joke

[00:16:58.180 --> 00:16:59.340]
Don't get all the banana shape

[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:03.180]
And you have till next Thursday May 15th and then starting next Thursday

[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.680]
We'll put the pictures up on the web for a week and people can vote which is the hottest couple

[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.100]
And Thursday May 22th the couple with the most votes wins

[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:15.340]
And the top prize is a 3 day 2 night stay for two with the moral voices resort in casino and in Bahamas

[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:20.540]
With round trip airfare on Lake Arir and the runner up couple gets dinner for two at the prestigious pizza lot

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.100]
Here's the results yesterday's poll

[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.840]
What movie had the best or most shocking ending?

[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:28.360]
The sixth sense, 225

[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.280]
And I think it was really good enough that my distaste for Bruce Willis I would overcome it

[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.240]
No, no

[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:37.780]
In fact just because movie had a great ending this mean it was a great movie

[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.900]
I pointed that out correct

[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.860]
It's fine, it's a good movie

[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:41.580]
It's okay

[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:44.340]
But not great

[00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.060]
Usually suspects 115 which was a strong second but I mean 225 is almost double

[00:17:49.060 --> 00:17:51.740]
And a much better movie with a much better ending but what do I know?

[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:53.880]
Oh, Planet of the 8th 98

[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.020]
Shawshank Redemption 80 which George will tell me this morning forget about it

[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.940]
American Beauty 56, Fight Club 43, 741

[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.560]
7 at 41 votes

[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.060]
That's well we put this on that

[00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:11.420]
A lot of light and spacing movies on this list I just noticed up at the top

[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.440]
What's in the box?

[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.500]
Seriously if they were just if why don't they just redo?

[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.380]
I mean they can do that they make different endings

[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.800]
Why don't they just reshoot that one scene or eliminate it or you know do something?

[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.760]
I'll get right on it

[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.460]
In fact they what's his name?

[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.500]
Because Lawrence Olivia has been dead for a long time

[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:32.160]
Was Lawrence Olivia in Spartacus with Tony Curtis or who was it?

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.660]
I think he was one of them

[00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:39.160]
Yeah, so they had to have Tony Hopkins this so this last night they on some of them were those E kind of channels

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.400]
And because they had originally limited the home or erotic scene there in the original movie

[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.300]
It's back though you'll be pleased to know

[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.260]
I will not be pleased ever want to see Tony Curtis naked but they put it

[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:55.040]
But the point being that they had a they they lost the dialogue so they had to have Tony Curtis and Anthony Hopkins

[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.780]
Do the dialogue for that scene

[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:04.060]
He was 741 easy writer 31 no way out had 31 Arlington Road at 31 Chinatown 30 Primal Fear 28

[00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:07.420]
Last American Virgin 27 Dr. Strange love 25

[00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:13.640]
Soil and green 24 carry 23 the others 22 Jacobs ladder 20

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:23.140]
A boy in his dog 17 deliver in 16 the game 15 angel art and happiness and body heat and witness for the prosecuting chat 14

[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:30.260]
The fact that happiness only at 14 votes tells me that either a the audiences got tasted their tush or be nobody saw it

[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.240]
Nobody saw it

[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.740]
No well they better

[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:37.000]
In fact what they're doing is they're going that's why George can't find a copy of it because all over town

[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.760]
He's going to all these damn stores. You can't find it because there's a run on it

[00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.400]
There's a run on happiness in South Florida

[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.220]
But it's it's worth seeing identity and frailty three frailty

[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.700]
What movie have you watched the most times now that I did put a first category around here

[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.080]
I've never watched any movie more than once do you think there's anybody in this audience who will vote for that?

[00:20:55.080 --> 00:21:03.220]
No well yeah they'll vote for it no no but I mean honestly vote for that no no well how can I still got these pictures of Aaron on here

[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.240]

[00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:26.800]
And this is one they can only put one okay there's no way you can give us a list of five on this even though they'll probably try

[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:33.540]
Well here's movies I watched a whole bunch of these men no not not not how many movies have you watched several times and not how many times did you watch?

[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.460]
That's great but we don't have any way to like quantify that okay that's not the point

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:45.480]
Godfather one which would be mine certainly I mean God I can't even count the number of times that I've watched a Godfather one

[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.940]
The thing you've brought it brains all over you nice time leaks suit

[00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:52.200]
A cook of cook who's nest gone with a wind and a clockwork orange which were judges

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.760]
Toilet chic emerges from a whole underground although it might be toilet chick emerges from a whole underground but I don't think so

[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:30.600]
I knew her yeah to the old toilet chick ask any tours to describe a Paris cafe laboratory and prepare for a tow curling account of the horrors of squatting over an impossibly small hole in the floor of a squalid cupboard sized cubicle

[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:36.680]
And here to think that I only thought that they did this in like 18th world countries I read that into squatting

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:46.720]
The smell and fear of splashes the lack of soap or towel the timer light that leaves you in the darkness after a minute have left a mark of generations of visitors of France

[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:51.920]
The time well they're they're frugal but you understand I had no idea

[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.080]
Yeah and 10 seconds of light goes off and you're in the dark and you hope that you don't go into the hole

[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:10.760]
Fritz people please me yeah but a handful of imaginative young decided to decide to confront the issue using custom built steel fittings and everything from cheeky people to live goldfish

who's bought five Paris cafes instead of fortune jazz fortune jazzing updated washrooms

[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:36.440]
Paris toilets have a reputation for being disgusting when really they should be at least as clean as the kitchen

[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.560]
They're also the one place that's truly private so there's scope tabs and fun with them too

[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.680]
I bet you there's plenty of people have fun on the turlits that I heard

First time or to the toilets in the trendy at twam on Kanté missing star cafe in the bulber quarter generally come up looking shocked

[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:02.680]
Shaps of light flood down from a holes in the ceiling of dim little laboratories where everything from the walls to toilet bowls to sinks is crafted from steel

[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:10.780]
In a window between male and female cubicles the view cut off by a lit up screen showing an apartment block by night a model train chugs by

[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:17.220]
The commas broken by panic as you glimpse yourself on a television screen cut by hidden camera beneath the mirror oh no

[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.900]

president want to be gram i'm evidence that bush blue nine eleven of this is

[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.260]
written little bits are cast because of course it is in newsmax dot com which is

[00:27:58.260 --> 00:27:58.440]
a

[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.040]
ultra ultra right wing website but

[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.860]
that is where i got it because i never checked that thing it was on uh...

[00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:06.400]
we're going to have a lot of us flash i believe

[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:10.720]
so that makes it even that much more amazing the fact that this isn't from

[00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.660]
some comi pinko left this website

[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.120]
president want to be gram i'm evidence that bush blue nine eleven democratic

[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.520]
presidential hopeful senator bob gram is reportedly

[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:22.020]
sitting on damaging evidence that the bush administration could have prevented

[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.200]
the nine eleven attacks but it hasn't released information yet because it's

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.820]
classified

[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:31.240]
i think bob gram has a smoking pistol on the bush administration congressional

[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.560]
quarterly's craved crofford

[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:36.140]
told wabc radio's john bachelor and paul on the xander late Tuesday

[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.620]
crofford explained that gram's mystery evidence has to do with their failures

[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.340]
especially intelligence failures before nine eleven

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.080]
in recent weeks senator gram the senior democrat on the senate intelligence

[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.940]
charge repeatedly that bush bungle the war on terrorism but the explorer

[00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:52.780]
governor is never publicly suggested that he thought the president left

[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.000]
america vulnerable to nine eleven attacks nevertheless

[00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:58.840]
crofford has been covering the four democrats presidential runs in the

[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.680]
gram obtained the bush nine eleven evidence while serving as the ranking

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.860]
democrat on the senate intelligence committee the problem is that what gram

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:05.240]
knows

[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.400]
and he knows some very damaging stuff about the bush administration's failures

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.280]
before the nine eleven uh... to prevent it he can't talk about because it's

[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.400]
classified he explained

[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.460]
another reason for gram's silence republicans would likely complain

[00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.000]
that he's abused his position on the intelligence committee by turning into a

[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.640]
tool for opposition research still

[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.620]
gram has been publicly hitting it what he knows without going into detail who

[00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:29.940]
quoted a recent speech in which the senator claimed i know first hand is

[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.560]
former chairman of the senate intelligence committee how little the

[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.500]
administration is done to provide real security at home while it's directed

[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.540]
its attention away from the war on terror broad

[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:40.760]
crofford said that the presidential hopeful is trying to figure out a way to make

[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.100]
the nine eleven evidence against bush public without violating the secrecy rules

[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:46.340]
on the intelligence committee how do you like that

[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.380]

it's it's it's it's just they just they just they can't thank for us is what they

[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.480]
are you know they just can't go along with it whatever it is like a bunch of

[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.120]
overgrown children

[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:11.060]
what one movie what single movie not which two not which ten not which i'm

[00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:15.320]
third man no now i can't cut it either what movie have you watched the most

[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:19.580]
times i mean there many movies have watched multiple times i can mention i

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.740]
watched the fan again on tv with loren bacalde that was a good movie i've seen

[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.760]
maybe three four times

[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:25.760]
but

[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:30.360]
there's the how many movies can there be that you watch zillions of times how many

[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:34.520]
those could they're possibly possibly not third man like i said i see i

[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.800]

[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:42.960]
i mean godfather one i have seen all three of them multiple times but godfather one

[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.500]
especially so many times i couldn't even count the number of times a hundred or more

[00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:51.060]
maybe zillions that that would be my answer how many times you seen it zillions of

[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:53.320]
time

[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.500]

[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.840]
i'm german irish well let me tell you something my crutch

[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.180]
mitt friend i'm gonna mix so much code for you you'll know what it was come

[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.680]
the lawyer i have not threatened i know almost every big lawyer in new york who

[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:26.000]
who the hell are you exactly nine fifty three at five sixty we're having a good time we

[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.380]
understand what it's all about the audiences have an over having a little communications problem

[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.800]
probably because we're on a m you have sure let's start some rumors that we're going on fm one

[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.820]
don't you think it's time to get rid of that country crap on kiss that stuff is such garbage you

[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:42.880]
know that stuff is so bogus especially now that they're not playing the dixie chicks yeah now that

[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.360]
they stop playing the dixie chicks i think that we ought to move in there and in fact what we'll

[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.920]
do is like in the middle of all the shows will play this each a quick record one half hour

[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:52.900]
playing the dixie chicks the other half hour played duff only that it's suck

[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.520]
and that's an interesting point because i don't like country music generally

[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.620]
although shaniya twain of course she's Canadian a yeah shaniya's country and she's great she's

vennapflex no they're having two houses built and they're not going to be staying the same way

[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:34.900]

[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.920]
plantation in johger where we had one for her and one for mat daemon and uh also uh elton john and

[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:11.180]
Although they philosophy for an expert on Plato and Aristotle rarely addressed current events in his writings

[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:18.400]
The most prominent is deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz now seen as the Wolfowitz of Arabia for his obsession with ousting

[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.060]
You know Iraq Sodom Hussein as the first step in transforming the entire Arab Middle East

[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.540]
Wolfowitz is also seen as the chief architect of Washington's post-September 11 global strategy including its controversial

[00:56:29.540 --> 00:56:30.800]
preemption policy

[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:36.920]
Two other very influential Straussians include weekly standard chief editor William Crystal and Gary Schmidt

[00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.680]
founder chairman and director of the project for New American Century

[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:47.060]
P.N.A.C. a six-year-old neo-conservative group whose alumni include vice-president Dick Cheney and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld

[00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:51.680]
As well as a number of other senior foreign policy officials and I should mention our governor Jeb Bush

[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:57.460]
P.N.A.C.E early prescriptions and subsequent open letters to President George W. Bush and how to fight the war on terrorism

[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:03.820]
Have anticipated to an uncanny extent precisely what the administration has done must be just a coincidence don't you think?

[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:11.020]
Crystal's father Irving the godfather of neo-conservatism who sits on the board of the American Enterprise Institute the A.E.I

[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:19.640]
Were a number of prominent hawks including former defense policy board chairman Richard Pearl are based has also credited Strauss with being one of the main influences on his thinking

[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:24.460]
While a New York Times article introduced readers to Strauss and his disciples in Washington

[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.880]
Interest was further peaked this week by a lengthy article and they by the New Yorkers legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersch

[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:37.500]
No relation to Sonny who noted that Abram Schulzky a close-prol associate who's run a special intelligence unit in Rumsfeld's office is also a Straussian

[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.940]
His unit according to Hirsch reinterpreted evidence of a rags alleged links to what some have been lodged

[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:49.160]
Al-Qaeda terrorist network and possession of weapons of mass destruction to support those in the administration determined to go to war with Baghdad

[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:56.980]
The article also identified Stephen cam bone one of Rumsfeld's closest aides went to the new post of undersecretary defense for intelligence as a Strauss follower

[00:57:57.460 --> 00:57:58.300]
In his article

[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:01.900]
Hirsch wrote that Strauss believed the world to be a place where isolated liberal democracies live in

[00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:09.340]
Constant danger from hostile elements abroad and where policy advisors may have to deceive their own public and even their rulers in order to protect their countries

[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:11.740]
Shady a jewelry author of

[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.220]
1999 glio Strauss and the American right says that Hirsch is right on the second cup

[00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:18.000]
But dead wrong in the first Strauss with neither a liberal nor a democrat

[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.540]
She said in the telephone interview from her office at the University of Calgary in Canada

[00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:27.920]
Perpetual deception of the citizens by those in powers critical and Strauss's view because they need to be led and they need strong rulers to tell them

[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:34.380]
What's good for them the Vi-Mar Republican Germany was a model of liberal democracy for which he had huge content at a jury

[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:38.800]
Liberalism in Vi-Mar and Strauss's view that ultimately the Nazi holocaust against the Jews

[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:44.340]
Like Plato's Strauss taught that within societies some are fit to lead others to be led

[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:50.840]
According to Dury but unlike Plato who believed that leaders had to be people with such high moral standards that they could resist the temptations of power

[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:57.240]
Strauss taught that those who are fit to rule are those who realize there is no morality and that those only one natural right the right of the

[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:59.100]
Superior to rule over the inferior

[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:04.720]
For Strauss religion is the glue that holds society together said Dury who had to that

[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:11.140]
Irving among other neo-conservatives has argued that separating church and state was the biggest mistake made by the founders of the US Republic

[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:17.540]
Secular society in their view is the worst possible thing because it leads to individualism liberalism and relativism

[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:23.740]
Precisely those traits that might encourage descent which interred could dangerously weaken society's ability to cope with external threats

[00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:29.720]
You want to cry that you can manipulate like putty according to Dury and it goes on you can be the whole article on the website

[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:35.540]
Yeah, well, that's what's happening man. You see it. You see it. It's right there in front of you

[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:37.220]
either you know either

[00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:41.460]
Get upset about it do something about it. What get whipped up to a frenzy or just

[00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:44.960]
Keep going like that. Yeah, it's all right out there

[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.180]
And we had another article which I'm not gonna waste the time reading or at least I probably won't

[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:55.460]
About the fact that this whole thing coming up on June 2nd with the FCC. It's already a done deal

[00:59:56.740 --> 01:00:02.420]
The FCC's media bureau has vetted staff recommendations for changes to a string of media ownership rules with all five commissioners

[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:06.740]
And the chosen proposals have been broadly endorsed by the commissioners three Republican members in other words

[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.340]
It's you know, it's treated to the Republicans have the edge on the FCC. It's a done deal

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.780]
While the recommend the bureau's recommendations weren't finalized latest today

[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:21.540]
AIDS expected the process to be completed by Monday the AIDS a there's wide agreement among the Republican majority over the biggest issues

Ferris Bueller's they off

[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.200]
Okay, see I mean why am I passing judgment on these huh?

[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.200]
So how you work?

[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.880]
Yeah, I'm a judgmental prick. That's right. It was okay. I seen the movie. It was all right. By the way

[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:55.300]
Did you know that he killed the he ran it? I didn't even know that story about Matthew Bronerick

[01:03:55.300 --> 01:04:00.320]
What about it? I saw in the tambourines this week. This happened some time ago like four or five years ago

[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:05.500]
He ran into a family over in England or somewhere in Ireland and cure like two or three people had no idea

[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.880]
God, I didn't know anything and come with Rick Sanchez

[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:16.980]
I just mentioned that in passing and they rich-packed to see of all people they just this is starting to get me really aggravated

[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.940]
He's got one two three four four of them and he says I've seen each of zillion times or maybe

[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.460]
Yeah, I can't handle that in fact

[01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:30.520]
I'm not gonna put any of them down just simply because I can't well, what am I gonna do put them all on there?

[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.520]
We're gonna have a list of 40,000 on here. The question is just it's simple. Okay

[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:43.920]
What movie have you watched the most times not as a child not as a nodal in your life in your life? You got it in your life

[01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.700]
How many can we pick?

[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.520]
About third man

[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:51.840]
One

[01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:58.940]
Put your finger in your nose get it way in there and pick one good one. Okay. That's my suggestion to you

[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:01.120]
Okay, put down first viewers. They are

[01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:04.760]
That was okay. I mean look if you like it you like it

[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.820]
What about who what what how might I say right

[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.560]
Sean and Hollywood's out of control says if I could afford it

[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:15.980]
I would have a chip implanted my front alone playing the Maltese Falcon on a continuous loop

[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:22.960]
If only to hear Sam Spade having Bogart say to Peter Lori Joel Cairo when you're slapped you'll take it and like it

[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:26.360]
Yeah

[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.840]
You cannot like a man!

[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:29.540]
What the hell would you?

[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.900]
Even if the slapping doesn't cause the effeminate carer to act like a man.

[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:37.120]
I've seen it more times than Charles Manson has seen the Perule Boards as Sean and Hollywood.

[01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.860]
Okay, let's get that on her Maltese Falcon. That was a great movie.

[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:43.260]
It was okay, I only thought once.

[01:05:44.420 --> 01:05:48.500]
I... I don't know how many times I saw, but I mean not one that I would watch a lot.

[01:05:49.100 --> 01:05:50.480]
See, this is an interesting thing.

[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.100]
Because when you come right down to it, like, you know, songs if you like a song,

[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.740]
you want to hear it over and over and over again.

[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:59.740]
Song lasts like three, four minutes, whatever it is.

[01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.580]
It used to be like two minutes.

[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.540]
But with movies, I mean movies is an investment of time.

[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.700]
I want to have two hours long movies somewhere like even up to three hours, maybe even more.

[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.040]
I'll tell you one, I can't find that really pisses me off that I would like to see again on DVD.

[01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.180]
Once upon a time in America.

[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:15.680]
Yeah.

[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:17.740]
I'm sure it's out there.

[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.060]
That's an underrated movie.

[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.980]
And then, like I said, the only frustrating thing about it is the ending is so bad.

[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:28.020]
Because you get to the ending and then you read that crap about, well, you know, the director said that, you know,

[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.560]
there was an opium trip or something.

[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.720]
In other words, it didn't even really happen.

[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:32.620]
Right. Don't you hate that?

[01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:33.440]
Yeah.

[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.820]
And you feel like in the movie it lasts about forever.

[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:37.840]
About 30 minutes.

[01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:38.520]
30 hours.

[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.440]
It's, well, maybe one of the longest movies ever made.

[01:06:41.560 --> 01:06:43.340]
The uncut, the original director's version.

[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.860]
They edited and they chopped the way down because they don't want to put like three and a half hour movies in the theater.

[01:06:48.740 --> 01:06:51.680]
In fact, do you remember when Godfather was a Godfather too?

[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.520]
Was that the one that was real super long?

[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.080]
There was an intermission in that movie.

[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:56.560]

[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.080]
Now, back in the old days, I mean, real old before you were born.

[01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.480]
But back in the good old days, they used to have intermissions in movies frequently.

[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:05.480]
Right.

[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.160]
Although the intermission wasn't between parts of a movie, the intermission would be between the main features.

[01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.240]
You'd go and you'd have your cartoon, I don't remember what order they were.

[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:20.120]
You'd have your cartoon, your 15 minutes serial like Rocket Man or Zorro or Superman or Cody.

[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.300]
Oh, I love that.

[01:07:22.420 --> 01:07:23.820]
That was Rocket Man, Commander Cody.

[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.880]
And the news reel, which would be, you know, five or ten minutes.

[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.900]
And then you'd have your first feature and then there would be an intermission.

[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:35.000]
And then between you'd have like another cartoon or some and previews.

[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.220]
You have previews of coming to fractions.

[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.180]
And then you'd have a second full feature.

[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:42.300]
So back in those days, it was like a day at the movies.

[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:42.680]
Right.

[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:47.400]
As opposed to now where you go into these multiplexes and there's like 75 different, well at least.

[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:48.340]
About third man.

[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:48.840]
The theaters.

[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.380]
And, you know, it's an hour and a half flick and each one is showing a different one.

[01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:52.840]
And that's it.

[01:07:54.020 --> 01:07:54.820]
Sure, sure.

[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.280]
How don't you know cartoons anymore?

[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.020]
No.

[01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.800]
You don't see any news reel. That's for damn sure.

[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.680]
Although, you know, something, don't tell this administration about that.

[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.900]
They'll be putting pom-pom scenes with the, you know, the troops returning with them holding the babies again.

[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.960]
Every time you go to see a movie, you'll be watching oscens again.

[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.120]
That's just a sublimal.

[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:16.220]
I wouldn't surprise me if they do the sublimal thing and they're like they travel to cove spice and the popcorn thing.

[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:17.060]
Remember that?

[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:17.480]
Uh huh.

[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.580]
When did they stop doing that?

[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.660]
In fact, maybe they never stopped.

[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.240]
That's right.

[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:29.940]
They started doing that with a subliminal advertising where they would put in little clips of popcorn and soda and candy.

[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.740]
And you didn't even realize they were in there, right?

[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.340]
No, it's just product placement.

[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:41.780]
And the purpose being to like subliminally make you hungry so that you'd run, you'd go rushing out to the counter, buy a bunch of crap and make all your teeth fall out.

[01:08:41.980 --> 01:08:42.240]
Popcorn.

[01:08:42.980 --> 01:08:45.200]
Popcorn, right? They would, popcorn candy.

[01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:49.020]
That would be a great pull to take some.

[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:49.880]
Did we ever do that?

[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:51.500]
Favorite theater food?

[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:52.780]
Yeah, favorite food.

[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:52.940]
No.

[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:53.860]
Did you ever do that?

[01:08:54.020 --> 01:08:56.120]
Nope. That would be a good one to take, like maybe Monday.

[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:58.220]
Sure will have people faxing.

[01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.660]
I like steak. I like fish kebab.

[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:00.600]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:02.400]
How about some pizza would be good, huh?

[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:06.080]
Pizza is a nice good thing to eat at the, uh, or how about Kentucky fried?

[01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:11.000]
How about like a nice big bucket of Kentucky fried at your favorite theater would be good.

[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:14.660]
Just ate the same no more man, just ate the same.

[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.340]
It's a whole different experience.

[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:18.200]
I just like the thing with the DVDs now.

[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.100]
I mean, why the hell would you waste your time going to movie theater when you can get these things on DVD?

[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:25.600]
Not that long after they came out, right?

[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:26.780]
With all these extra's.

[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:29.520]
Sure, with all the extra good stuff and then the Easter eggs.

[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:29.820]
Oh.

[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:31.120]
God.

[01:09:31.780 --> 01:09:33.500]
I can't wait to figure that out.

[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:35.000]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:36.420]
Hello.

[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.240]
Yes, sir.

[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:37.880]
Neil.

[01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.420]
Yes, I got, I got a movie today.

[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:42.880]
My favorite movie is Fast Times at Ridge Mill High.

[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:50.340]
And yesterday's poll, I was wondering what the movie that I thought was the, the should have been on there was the crying game.

[01:09:51.980 --> 01:09:52.880]
It was on there.

[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:53.700]
Was it?

[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:56.860]
It wasn't on there because it wasn't the end of the movie.

[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:58.100]
It was the first 20 minutes of the movie.

[01:09:58.100 --> 01:09:58.720]
Oh, that's right.

[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.160]
Yeah, somebody suggested that.

[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:02.280]
It was not there because the ending wasn't what was great.

[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:02.880]
I'm blonde.

[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.020]
I didn't get it till the end.

[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:05.820]
Okay.

[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:06.820]
All right, Neil.

[01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:07.580]
Have a good one, man.

[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:08.840]
You too, pal.

[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:09.220]
Thanks.

[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.720]
Fast Times at Ridge Mill High.

[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:11.680]
How about your pardon?

[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.160]
The penis didn't tip him off, I guess.

[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:14.680]
The penis?

[01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.520]
Yeah, penis.

[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.580]
Oh, she was a guy.

[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.120]
Right.

[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:22.880]
I didn't see that movie the crying game.

[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:23.380]
Oh, okay.

[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.540]
I'm not in those pervert kind of movies.

[01:10:25.540 --> 01:10:27.560]
I like something like, you know, Alison Wonderland.

[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.020]
Something really normal like Alison Wonderland with a mad header in the chisher cat.

[01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.560]
All the header old stuff.

[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:35.660]
Right.

[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.020]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:44.160]
What movie have you watched the most times?

[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:45.900]
Now, see what that also be.

[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:46.700]
What's your favorite movie?

[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:47.840]
Not necessarily.

[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:48.560]
No.

[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:52.060]
Because I still think, and it's difficult.

[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.080]
It is so hard.

[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:55.640]
But I think that my favorite movie is still network.

[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:57.080]
I'm as mad as hell.

[01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:58.720]
Or I just couldn't take this anymore.

[01:10:58.800 --> 01:10:59.000]
Oh!

[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:02.400]
Like I told, I just watched about two thirds of it again the other day.

[01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.160]
But you know when you watch the movie too often,

[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.700]
when you can't watch it all the way through,

[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.860]
because you just know what's going to happen.

[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:10.120]
Right.

[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:10.780]
You don't buy rope.

[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.900]
But there are certain parts of it that you're just so obsessed with.

[01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.100]
You cannot turn it off.

[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.100]
I'll get back to you.

[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:16.780]
Diana.

[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:21.920]
The scene in his office where she's pitching to put

[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.840]
a beer back on the air.

[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:27.360]
And he says, you're talking about putting a manifestly irresponsible man on

[01:11:28.060 --> 01:11:29.200]
national network television.

[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:30.560]
And she stands there with her birthday.

[01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.580]
She's nodding her head.

[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.640]
It's just sensational.

[01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:38.280]
Well, I'd have to run it by what it stands for practices.

[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.320]
And Mr. Ruddy will want to know about it.

[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.540]
But I'll get back to you, Diana.

[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.100]
I think that's my favorite movie.

[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:47.040]
But I have not seen it anywhere near as many.

[01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:49.540]
Well, first of all, it's almost never on television.

[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.400]
One of the reasons being that network television probably is like a little bit of

[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:58.140]
verse to putting it on there because it's an indictment of exactly what they become.

[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.000]
But the Godfather, I mean, every time you turn around, there it is.

[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:02.600]
There is the man.

[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.920]
I'm not going to need it because you can't turn it off.

[01:12:05.340 --> 01:12:05.660]
Right?

[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:06.520]
Just like this show.

[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.460]
Just like the people that claim that they hate this show.

[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.160]
They may hate it, but they can't turn it off.

[01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.720]
1026 at 560 QM.

[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.760]
I see pomp and a park spot here, but I don't have any copies.

[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:17.640]
So I'm just going to win it.

[01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:18.300]
Right.

[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:22.260]
Well, no, because it's unfortunate because I'm sure that Steve Wolf and our close personal

[01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:24.620]
friend Troy Stratford would like me to know what's going on there.

[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.400]
Anyway, the Panthers and the Heat are well done for the seasons.

[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.640]
Thica forking them they're done.

[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.300]
And college basketball, finito, the dolphins don't get started for another three months.

[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.480]
But there's still some great live action going on where you can be a big winner.

[01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.460]
Pomp and O Park is open three nights a week for great live harness racing every Wednesday, Friday,

[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.240]
like the night, and tomorrow every Saturday.

[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.560]
First post time, 715 in the PM General Parking admission is free.

[01:12:45.180 --> 01:12:49.900]
I bet you they got some special stuff from other day too, maybe tomorrow, but I don't know what it is because I have no copy.

[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:52.020]
Come out to Pomp and O Park and enjoy great racing.

[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:54.140]
And of course, every day, seven days a week starting in noon, you've got

[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:58.100]
cymbal casting from all over North America through a bread racing, highlight harness racing from

[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:59.880]
the best tracks all over North America.

[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.260]
Every Wednesday at Pomp and O Park is dollar night for draft beer hot dogs, sodas, and lots more.

[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:10.500]
And I'm assuming I'm positive that coming up on Saturday, May 17th, that's a week from tomorrow.

[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.820]
They'll be featuring cymbal casting of the pretens dates from Pemlico and early bird wagering will start.

[01:13:15.020 --> 01:13:16.860]
I do believe next Friday the 16th and 1 PM.

[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.520]
I'm pretty sure of that, but I don't have it a copy.

[01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:20.020]
Don't hold me to it, but I'm positive.

[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.400]
Watch wagering, join the crowd.

[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.620]
Next Saturday, May 17th, the second leg in turbo-derasing triple crowded Pomp and O Park.

[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.040]
By the way, Emerald, what's the horse that was posted when?

[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:29.740]
Everlopsey.

[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.960]
No, certainly the favorite in the Derby.

[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.080]
Whatever was, he's skipping the pretens.

[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:36.140]
Really?

[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.900]
So I'm going to pick funny side when Dave Johnson will just speak to him next week.

[01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.580]
Pomp and O Park are blocked south Atlantic Boulevard on Power Line Road.

[01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.880]
Don't forget, live racing tonight, great harness racing in the space.

[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:46.980]
Post-time 715 at Pomp and O Park.

[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.220]
I'm on my own.

[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.420]
This is between your bike city and your way out.

[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:55.800]
Oh boy.

[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.460]
I'm a cat that can go.

[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:05.160]
The White House issue of statement today.

[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:08.800]
I'll phone your trip you can at a ride away.

[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:12.840]
It's not your left, it's just like safe.

[01:14:13.120 --> 01:14:16.660]
They're not a lot of power coalition anyway.

[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:19.460]
The Navy is a got the sauce.

[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.180]
Knowing that we'll bring you home.

[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:26.900]
The Navy is a got the sun.

[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.160]
The Navy in one few.

[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.400]
The Navy is on black light cars.

[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:39.200]
Oh baby, listen and get off that bus.

[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.040]
More planning things this falls right in line.

[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.500]
And it do it.

[01:14:44.780 --> 01:14:46.720]
And that a better time.

[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.480]
The Navy is a got the sauce.

[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:53.340]
Knowing that we'll bring you home.

[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.020]
The Navy is a got the sauce.

[01:14:57.740 --> 01:14:59.360]
The Navy in one few.

[01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:10.280]
The Navy is a got the sauce.

[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.320]
I'm on my own.

[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.120]
1032.5.

[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:15.880]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:18.260]
It sounds like a little gg.

[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.400]
That the power of Christ compels you.

[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.560]
The power of Christ compels you.

[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.580]
The power of Christ compels you.

[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:31.060]
Somebody says the exercise is the course.

[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.180]
I've seen that several times.

[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:47.440]
I've seen that several times.

[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:53.320]
I haven't been assigned that.

[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:54.760]
There are constant mistakes.

[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.240]
I'm not on arage of Godfather.

[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:56.240]

[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:01.720]
Is that so?

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.160]

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.160]

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.160]

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:02.160]

[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.700]
You'll shoot your eye out

[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:10.140]
Never saw it. It's like a 40s 40s movie. It looks like a movie for go him

[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.380]
It's a wonderful life seven. Oh, it's speaking of a beener boy rumor

[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:18.040]
I heard there was that you know Aaron that sent us those pictures yesterday Amy and Aaron

[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.180]
I heard that he got Aaron's number. I couldn't be wrong about that. But that's the rumor going around a building

[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:29.900]
In fact that what I heard the actual the whole story was I heard that he and muffled like wrestling and a hive and like a brawl this morning

[01:16:30.800 --> 01:16:34.320]
And it came to find out they were Aaron muff was trying to get the phone number away from him

[01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.460]
It's a wonderful life seven never watched any movie more than once for see I told you

[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.120]
National amputation three gone with a win three life of Brian three

[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:52.000]
2001 space Odyssey three clockwork orange appear jaws two ten and then from there on does it mattering?

[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.720]
Did we put deliverance on there?

[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:58.300]
Not yet. Well, why not? No, what's that yet? Well, we'll wait till somebody says it

[01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:03.330]
Because if I do that then I'll have put on more than one myself and we're only allowing one in fact

[01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.730]
Here's another one JK from Hollywood. We love you JK

[01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:09.690]
But you got like a whole is plus. He's got the first one fast time a rich months high

[01:17:10.750 --> 01:17:12.870]
Which that's gonna get a bunch of votes because here's another fact

[01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:16.630]
So I've seen that one easily two thousand times and somebody called it and fast times a rich month high

[01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:19.070]
So we'll put that on there. But if you put like a whole bunch of them

[01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:22.630]
I'm just gonna smit can your facts, okay? Because they what's the point?

[01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:25.150]
Right I get to name a bunch of movies

[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:30.590]
That's like asking me what's my favorite flavor flavor of ice cream and I list you every flavor

[01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:35.150]
It's every hour like butter pecan vanilla chocolate is pretty I like rocky road

[01:17:37.810 --> 01:17:44.970]
It's just not that difficult. I understand that we're requiring you to make a judgment make a pick one make a judgment

[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:49.550]
But every pool that we take where we let the audience you know kind of like build the pool

[01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:53.570]
Which is great because it kills time in the audience in spite of the fact that they claimed on that one pool

[01:17:53.570 --> 01:18:00.630]
We took that day believe me. This is their meat and potatoes man. This is what they can sink their teeth in who just keep that in mind

[01:18:00.630 --> 01:18:07.410]
Mm-hmm. It's better all the miles. Oh, no, that's the last thing we want to hear is these long ponderous pool. No, it's not you love it

[01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:11.090]
Plus I sneak in my bedtime stairs. We get all the good stuff in there

[01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:15.630]
Don't forget Joanne Jokostello who used to be a hell of a good broadcaster

[01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:20.410]
Joanne Jokostello today noon to two the Verizon wireless through a 33 33 North Federal Highway in Palpatau

[01:18:20.410 --> 01:18:25.050]
Stop by to get some free Marlon's tickets for tonight's game against the Colorado Rockies and

[01:18:25.050 --> 01:18:31.090]
Registered when tickets from upcoming home game. I still we're confused them. What happened with the all-star thing? Maybe it's a promotion that's over

[01:18:33.050 --> 01:18:38.370]
Or maybe Doreen took Miguel's toys away. I don't know what the deal is Bill and for a lot of the else says star wars

[01:18:38.370 --> 01:18:41.510]
Absolutely positive without an equic is answering star wars

[01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:45.170]
Episode four a new hope the real well. Oh, wait a minute

[01:18:47.330 --> 01:18:52.290]
So this is gonna be like Godfather where we're talking about oh

[01:18:53.190 --> 01:18:58.510]
The movie Lucas made when he was broken talented before he sold a soul to the devil for it's beyond his wildest dreams and started to

[01:18:58.510 --> 01:19:01.690]
Oh, that's right because all the other stuff is that's like that retro crap right

[01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:04.590]
Now we don't want no retro crap. Okay, thank you Bill

[01:19:04.590 --> 01:19:09.550]
Steve and Mimey says Neil George and Beener boy and Ace Ventura wanted a list

[01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:13.710]
He's seen it a whole bunch of times and he says

[01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:16.390]
Third man, okay got it Ace Ventura won

[01:19:17.650 --> 01:19:22.330]
Got it. I don't even know what the hell I did. Ace Ventura pet detective. Oh

[01:19:22.330 --> 01:19:24.990]
Okay, what were I having oh yeah, I didn't carry it surprisingly

[01:19:24.990 --> 01:19:29.510]
Yeah, didn't suck and the second one was even better. You know, I liked him carry a lot

[01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:34.750]
Yeah, but it's the movies he makes that I don't like I understand the second movie was actually funny

[01:19:35.210 --> 01:19:37.950]
Was it really it was I was the product your word for it

[01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:40.690]
I listen at me over at this stage of the way things are going

[01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:44.370]
I'm not gonna have time left in my lifetime right to watch all the movies that I got on list now

[01:19:44.370 --> 01:19:48.470]
Even the ones I got in the other room sitting there all the BVD's and my DVD's

[01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:55.510]
Here's one that says if you like Motown music which I do love check out the documentary standing in the shadows of Motown

[01:19:57.150 --> 01:20:03.830]
It's about the funk brothers Motown's sessions musicians have played more I'm more hits than Elvis the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined

[01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:08.690]
It says like you and George I've seen the Godfather dozens of times

[01:20:08.690 --> 01:20:14.870]
Especially parts one and two I won't forgive Robert Duval for doing days of Thunder instead and

[01:20:15.570 --> 01:20:23.090]
Winona Ryder to be your boyfriend Johnny to be with her boyfriend Johnny Depp for leaving Godfather to and giving us George Hamilton and Sophia Coppola

[01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:25.810]
Pop had Tom Hagen and Connie look what we got

[01:20:25.810 --> 01:20:29.230]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ah

[01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:32.890]
And then he's got a list of 75 other movies he's seen many many times, but

[01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.830]
And it says if you had young children you saw the Lion King a little mermaid a lot also

[01:20:38.170 --> 01:20:41.930]
But Godfather one I'm assuming after star wars in his case got it

[01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:46.550]
Got all these got Godfather one cook who's nest gone with a wind clock recordings life of Brian

[01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:52.650]
It's a wonderful life a Christmas Carol oceans 11 Beetlejuice national lamp wind vacation 2001 the space Odyssey

[01:20:52.650 --> 01:20:52.710]
We're going to see.

[01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:55.910]
What's that one with us?

[01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:58.530]
Two thousand on a space travesty with Leslie Nielsen?

[01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.950]
Right.

[01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.090]
That's been out a few times, but I haven't watched it yet.

[01:21:01.230 --> 01:21:01.670]
Can you see it?

[01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:01.950]
No.

[01:21:02.810 --> 01:21:03.470]
Can't be bad.

[01:21:04.010 --> 01:21:06.430]
There's Leslie Nielsen ever been in a bad movie, I don't think so.

[01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:08.870]
He's Canadian, eh?

[01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:12.570]
We're going to see, Christmas story, JAWS.

[01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:13.670]
You don't like Leslie Nielsen?

[01:21:14.350 --> 01:21:15.150]
Of course I do.

[01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.630]
It was kind of a pause.

[01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:17.270]
You know what it's called?

[01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:18.630]
It's like a long pregnant pause.

[01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:19.150]
Like, eh.

[01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.210]
That's what he was talking to me.

[01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:22.350]
Interferring again?

[01:21:23.610 --> 01:21:24.550]
No, it was important.

[01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:26.350]
It was important.

[01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:28.030]
Yeah, we were discussing Oceans 11.

[01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:29.670]
I don't remember anybody saying that neither does he,

[01:21:29.770 --> 01:21:30.690]
but nevertheless it's on there.

[01:21:32.970 --> 01:21:34.690]
Oceans 11 was on a phone call.

[01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:36.450]
Somebody did mention Oceans 11.

[01:21:37.890 --> 01:21:38.170]
Oh yeah.

[01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:39.010]
Yeah.

[01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.970]
See, this is what I put up with, folks.

[01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:44.670]
I got the two beaners there in this studio.

[01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:44.970]

[01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:46.390]
And they just, and the reason they pulled us

[01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:48.210]
and always come out the way you think it's going to come out

[01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:50.030]
and things disappear, things get added in.

[01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:52.510]
It's because I'm doing one show, and then the two of them

[01:21:52.510 --> 01:21:53.370]
are doing another show.

[01:21:53.890 --> 01:21:56.070]
Somebody called in and said, Oceans 11.

[01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:58.850]
Now maybe you're hearing, maybe you have Rush Limbaugh disease,

[01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:00.650]
maybe you're hearing is going to Bodia?

[01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.070]
What?

[01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:02.350]
See?

[01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.450]
A Christmas story, JAWS, fear and loathing in Las Vegas,

[01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:07.990]
canty-shack airplane, which was hysterical.

[01:22:09.610 --> 01:22:11.390]
They're having a sale at JC Penney's.

[01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:12.130]
He was the best.

[01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:14.130]
That fruitcake, he was hysterical.

[01:22:14.650 --> 01:22:14.910]
Leon.

[01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:16.670]
Was that his name?

[01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:17.170]
Mm-hmm.

[01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:18.910]
He was a panic.

[01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:21.610]
And also what's his name?

[01:22:21.650 --> 01:22:22.130]
Lloyd Bridges.

[01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:24.310]
He was sniffing glue.

[01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:28.510]
It kind of reminded me of the momeister, you know?

[01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:31.630]
I'll get to it.

[01:22:31.670 --> 01:22:32.070]
I'll find it.

[01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.090]
It isn't here somewhere.

[01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.050]
I picked a bad date of quitsnith and glue.

[01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:35.310]
Right.

[01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:39.330]
Lloyd Bridges was upside down in that one scene.

[01:22:39.790 --> 01:22:40.910]
Oh, first-buehler's day off.

[01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:41.190]
Yeah.

[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:42.270]
A mouthy-style.

[01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.770]
And fast times at rich man high,

[01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:44.750]
it's going to get a lot of votes.

[01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:48.650]
The exorcist network, and a spent-year-old one.

[01:22:49.510 --> 01:22:51.750]
Is that actually the name is spent-year-old pet detective?

[01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:53.370]
It's been-year-old pet detective.

[01:22:54.830 --> 01:22:56.070]
Well, put on it, what I've been told you.

[01:22:56.150 --> 01:22:56.870]
Like, I don't know what it is.

[01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.650]
How about JC Penney's?

[01:22:59.070 --> 01:23:01.770]
How about that MSNBC in the JC Penney's?

[01:23:01.930 --> 01:23:03.550]
Well, you talk about embarrassing.

[01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:05.610]
Have you noticed what you probably don't watch it?

[01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:06.770]
And I almost never do anymore.

[01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:08.450]
I don't watch CNN, under penalty of death.

[01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:12.050]
But if I ever flip it around, I get to MSNBC.

[01:23:12.450 --> 01:23:14.910]
They keep changing the times of the show.

[01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:16.630]
It reminds me of the old PD Boulder thing.

[01:23:17.310 --> 01:23:20.510]
When I was doing the last gasp of their talk format,

[01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:22.350]
before they sold out and became Fox Sports,

[01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.990]
with their marginal of fractional numbers.

[01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:28.010]
And they're doing the same thing.

[01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:30.350]
And they move a Ville press and a pet you can in.

[01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:31.010]
They're on like five.

[01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:31.830]
I don't know.

[01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:33.990]
Nobody has any idea what time those shows are on.

[01:23:34.350 --> 01:23:36.410]
The Big Fat Noctment, I think they just took him off

[01:23:36.410 --> 01:23:37.590]
to the fat farmer or something.

[01:23:39.170 --> 01:23:40.850]
And that's their new deal on there now.

[01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:42.910]
So anyway, JC Penney, I don't think that show is ever

[01:23:42.910 --> 01:23:43.770]
going to see the light of the day.

[01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:48.670]
I think that when he did the interview with the soldiers,

[01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:49.710]
I think that was it.

[01:23:49.770 --> 01:23:50.790]
That was the nail in the coffin.

[01:23:50.950 --> 01:23:51.590]
That was the one show.

[01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:54.090]
This is what we put you on the ear for.

[01:23:54.170 --> 01:23:54.490]
Was that?

[01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:55.670]
And I think that was the end of him.

[01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:56.630]
Awful.

[01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:59.630]
We're lucky, Jesse, but get a life.

[01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:00.050]
Get a life.

[01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.410]
Find a real job.

[01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:01.110]
Go back to wrestling.

[01:24:01.150 --> 01:24:01.810]
That's his thing.

[01:24:02.750 --> 01:24:04.410]
1041 at 560 W to kill me.

[01:24:04.410 --> 01:24:06.010]
You know, Mother's Day is only the day after tomorrow.

[01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.870]
It's just two days away.

I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders!

[01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:30.730]
10.47 at 5.60, that's killing a man, Godfather one!

[01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:34.050]
Now look at this, somebody just faxed me some of my mohawk racing stuff!

[01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:35.270]
Yeah!

[01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:38.670]
What do you say it would say, just stain?

[01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:40.310]
Oh, is that how it sounded?

[01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:45.110]
I mean, if I can't get pomp and a park copy, I can just get mohawk or race stuff!

[01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:48.030]

[01:28:04.850 --> 01:28:05.610]
Chris Christopher, son?

[01:28:06.510 --> 01:28:10.390]
Uh, let's see, here's one that says, maybe we should say comedy or drama?

[01:28:10.530 --> 01:28:12.730]
Or maybe we should make this a 40 part?

[01:28:13.090 --> 01:28:15.010]
What comedy did you watch more than A of the movie?

[01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:16.090]
What drama did you watch?

[01:28:16.330 --> 01:28:17.470]

[01:28:17.670 --> 01:28:19.170]
No, no!

[01:28:20.010 --> 01:28:20.150]
No!

[01:28:22.110 --> 01:28:24.690]
You know what, no matter what you do, like I've always said!

[01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:29.210]
It's never the right thing. It's kind of like with my mother, you know, no matter what you do

[01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:32.990]
It's not the right thing. It's not the way you should have done it. He didn't ask the right question

[01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:36.790]
Baba, Baba, Baba Too bad, but she was a nice girl. Why did you like her?

[01:28:37.710 --> 01:28:39.010]
No, my mother never said that.

[01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:47.030]
Good morning and we'll be I can watch over and over again Mel Brooks Spaceballs. Okay, we got space balls on there. We do that

[01:28:48.730 --> 01:28:51.950]
How about springtime for Hitler? Oh, the producers

[01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:58.790]
Look at this. I wrote space for space for Hitler. Well, it's a lot of Hitler talk these days for obvious reasons

[01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.430]
Spaceballs. Okay, Jane are

[01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:07.230]
Listener and four-letter deal Jane says just to prove your point about censorship in USA and NPR this morning

[01:29:07.230 --> 01:29:11.190]
They had their letters from listeners the announcer admitted they'd received a flood of letters about a story

[01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:16.150]
They did about how a Burton's did bid free government contract, but the only letter they read was from a one who said

[01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:18.130]
What other company can handle the job?

[01:29:18.670 --> 01:29:21.970]
Then they went on to read two letters about Mr. Hooper on Sesame Street

[01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:24.330]
Is that incredible?

[01:29:24.870 --> 01:29:30.210]
No, very good. We have watched the most and I can still say enjoy it is blues brothers. Let's get that on here. Okay?

[01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:35.090]

[01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:37.850]
How's John doing these days?

[01:29:38.130 --> 01:29:38.570]

[01:29:39.550 --> 01:29:43.650]
Poor John Belushi, huh fat lots of drugs did

[01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:48.710]
Just I was wondering if you may know whatever happened to a newscaster on CNN named David Gutteneau

[01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:49.670]
What?

[01:29:50.770 --> 01:29:54.690]
And she goes on I have no idea who that is. Yeah, I hope he's working in cannibal good lucky Jane

[01:29:55.230 --> 01:30:00.110]
Jane's great, but she always put something on there that I have no idea what she's talking about I saw gaslight Jane, okay

[01:30:00.850 --> 01:30:04.330]
Believe me. You're not fooling this kid. Although I do feel a little like Ingrid Bergman today

[01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:07.470]
Like maybe today for lunch I'll go and give me a good steak

[01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:10.210]
Well, didn't they burn her at the steak

[01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:17.510]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 team maybe even looking not quite as much as Ingrid Bergman

[01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:22.450]
Here's a lady in Boyton Beach. Hello. Hello. Yes, man

[01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:28.110]
Hi, I was just wondering if I could just breakfast at Tiffany's how many times you see that oh

[01:30:28.110 --> 01:30:30.330]
Probably at least three dozen times

[01:30:31.970 --> 01:30:37.810]
Okay, you got it. Okay, thanks. Thanks. Bye. Bye. I'll keep listening. Okay. Thanks. Thanks

[01:30:37.810 --> 01:30:42.550]
She's listening. I'm talking breakfast at Tiffany's Audrey Hepburn. I told you she was beautiful in Sparrow

[01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:45.590]
You said she was scrawny. She was ruining bird lady

[01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:52.010]
I'll tell you who else is scrawny is Jared Lido from Requiem for a dream. He's could use a couple of sandwiches. I was all know that smack

[01:30:52.710 --> 01:30:56.530]
Well, okay, is that the idea that he had like a buck down right for that movie?

[01:30:56.530 --> 01:31:01.370]
We might have a point there. Maybe he's not really that slim because I'll be honest a picture that you emailed me

[01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:04.510]
See this isn't gonna go well for George's reputation

[01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:08.890]
Which is already suffering from all the years he's been on this show. It's like marginal invest whatever

[01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:12.670]
But when he and Carlos are both emailing me pictures of villain guys

[01:31:14.930 --> 01:31:16.750]
Let's see where is the picture?

[01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:22.350]
Where to go there he is. Yes, he don't look like real scrawny in that picture

[01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:24.310]
No, so we probably like bulk down

[01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:26.570]
He probably went like on a Karen Carpenter diet for a couple of weeks

[01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:30.370]
Because he had looked like real anorexic because when you're doing his many drugs

[01:31:30.370 --> 01:31:32.150]
Oh, we shouldn't be saying all these things. We'll give it away

[01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:38.130]
When you're doing as much of that crap as he was doing and then he had that arm problem to you know

[01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:39.470]
Oh

[01:31:40.570 --> 01:31:42.070]
Talk about purple

[01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:45.630]
Man, poiple veins

[01:31:45.630 --> 01:31:52.070]
Mm-hmm purple veins not just your ordinary kind of like purplish but real purple veins and purple arm and purple

[01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:53.970]
Well, I don't have that problem anymore with that arm

[01:31:55.070 --> 01:32:00.650]
Just waiting for scenes with Lee Marvin one the best actor for this movie was worth watching this movie at least 80 times

[01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:04.210]
He's hilarious as a drug and gunslinger and cat blue

[01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:05.890]

Smoking smoking lung cancer heavy smoker heavy heavy duty

[01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:23.630]
It says the scene at the end when he was supposed to rescue cat from the gallows the Indian phantom on his drunken horse

[01:32:23.630 --> 01:32:27.750]
The horse leaned against the mercantile building with its leg crossed said your eyes

[01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.830]
Marvin said what's wrong with my eyes Indian they're all red bloodshot

[01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:32.770]
Marvin you ought to see him from my side

[01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:34.870]

Let's see movies broadcast on TV you bet of course

[01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:44.910]

[01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:13.310]
Whether you want to or not. I mean it like for the two weeks before Christmas. That's not every five minutes

[01:34:14.070 --> 01:34:18.950]
In fact, I think it's a law now since Bush got in every year. They have to show it a whole bunch of times every Christmas

[01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:20.890]
But third man at least that's the minimum

[01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:26.710]
National ampune's vacation seven ten commandments six got six votes like I just said

[01:34:26.710 --> 01:34:31.550]
Joss six caddy check five never watched any movie more than once five I

[01:34:32.490 --> 01:34:33.870]
Mean you know to reach its own

[01:34:35.850 --> 01:34:40.790]
Now you know, I'll tell you another aspect of this which I'm sorry that I brought up but since I fax about the

[01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:46.010]
Look at this Neil Hector says a friend told me the scene of the parting of the red seat was done with Jell

[01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:51.870]
Let's ask Charlton you son of a bitch. Oh, that's ready probably forgot

[01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:55.730]
That's that's terrible or he looked really bad and that

[01:34:56.210 --> 01:35:02.730]
Remember last week we both some on the news where he was doing that parting thing at the NRA daughtering he looked really shot

[01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:06.110]
That he looked really bad horrible

[01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:14.090]
But the point of making movies that you saw in the movie theater more than one now

[01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:20.290]
That's not the pull questions. Yeah, I shouldn't even mention it because that'll cloud the issue which they're already trying to murky murky the waters up anyway

[01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:28.110]
You see I mean obviously there are movies that are that great that when a first came out back in those days anyway back like in the seventies

[01:35:29.010 --> 01:35:31.490]
You never saw the movies on TV for years if ever

[01:35:32.290 --> 01:35:35.830]
I like it is now we didn't have no showtime and HBO all this stuff

[01:35:36.850 --> 01:35:41.770]
So if you want to see movie again, you'd go back and see it again like sometimes the next day was so good

[01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.170]
I can't think of any of that I ever did that one, but there are people who did I

[01:35:47.330 --> 01:35:50.610]
Think that there were people went to see the exercises again, right?

[01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:55.170]
Just didn't get their fill a pea soup the first time I

[01:35:56.770 --> 01:35:57.930]

[01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:38.850]
Where the hell is it

[01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.450]

And he made the comment that was the lowest budget ratings party he'd ever seen

[01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:23.830]
It was a low budget place and it was really crap and he was a moment grown

[01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:30.170]
Now was he bonding with Mo with that party or not Hank was entering as I was leaving so I didn't see what happened once

[01:37:30.170 --> 01:37:36.230]
He got in there. Oh you miss all the good stuff. That's what you want to hear about. Sorry. There's already a cheese

Alec Baldwin should have continued the time fancy series instead of that lame old Harrison Ford

[01:42:51.450 --> 01:42:57.550]
I don't think pick it on Harrison Ford. He's you know, he knew Alec Baldwin, but he's pretty good. He is layman old though

[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:02.350]
What's the movie we were talking about yesterday with Harrison Ford that was so damn good?

He's beneath more lives beneath that's the one and he's right. He's getting a little old and what he said old and lame

[01:43:12.210 --> 01:43:13.430]

Doing like everybody else is doing Godfather one will be number one network would be number two

[01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:26.330]
And I think excesses would be number three. I watched it again like go about a month ago

[01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:31.590]
When I first got the DVD player three weeks is that the one with the missing scenes or the added yeah

[01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:35.570]
I'd say added to the one where she comes down the stairs backwards or hit us like best

[01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:41.250]
That was the only one that I really thought did anything for it all that super imposed Pazuzu I could have done without

[01:44:43.190 --> 01:44:45.670]
Pazuzu that was that demon that they kept showing oh

[01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:49.430]
Yeah, that was no big deal, but once you came down the stairs backwards

[01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:54.150]
That's kind of the thing with her hands like arms were like over her

[01:44:54.150 --> 01:44:56.330]
I don't know how to explain it backwards. Yeah

[01:44:57.750 --> 01:45:03.670]
She was great nobody gives her any credit for that. I know bad whatever happened. She's like huh, but James gave her a lot of credit

[01:45:09.130 --> 01:45:13.150]
Yeah, yeah, no they were doing it for a while there a lot

[01:45:14.610 --> 01:45:20.670]
They were doing it a lot they were doing everything. How do you know that big news? Right?

[01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:24.470]
What what am I missing what I

[01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:30.750]
I'm gonna say hot and toward thing they both how do you know they were doing it a lot? What is that they said? How many times a day?

[01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:34.650]
What are we talking about they were doing it a lot yeah?

[01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:36.330]
That's what they said

[01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:41.470]
Well, great. I'm more ecstatic for them. I'm pleased this punch that they were doing it a lot

[01:45:42.170 --> 01:45:45.690]
But seriously whatever happened her she vanished. She just disappeared

[01:45:45.690 --> 01:45:48.390]

As a matter of fact the spoof of the exercise right that was cute repossessed was that it right? That's right. That was good

[01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:56.110]

If they reach out and just slap them in a head

[01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:55.390]
Like El Martino that's kind of a quiet slap on her too. Yeah

[01:46:55.390 --> 01:47:03.650]
I guarantee if synophrough would have been a room he'd have probably slapped him a lot harder in a cell right on the top of the head

[01:47:04.290 --> 01:47:05.790]
Or had somebody else to do it for him

[01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:11.630]
Here's a lady in Cooper City. Hello. Good morning Uncle Neil. How are you good? How you doing? I'm doing really well

[01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:16.830]
I have seen ghost busters a Gillian times. I can do the dialogue. I love them

[01:47:17.710 --> 01:47:24.030]
It's just one of those movies that stays with you know you can just crack off a line from the movie in any situation

[01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:27.230]
I I vote for that one hands down

[01:47:27.230 --> 01:47:29.730]
Okay, thanks have a great day you too

[01:47:29.730 --> 01:47:33.270]
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm an envious to say this because I pride myself

[01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:35.830]
I know in so much of the dialogue from all three of the godfathers

[01:47:35.830 --> 01:47:41.070]
But that line that she brings back in God's father three that I'm always chance-tizing with Connie says Michael

[01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:44.550]
Now they will fear you now where do they actually say that in the first one?

[01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:48.310]
Think of now they will fear you

[01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:56.270]
Ha got you I'll get somebody in this audience will know we have a lot of godfather experts out there somebody will know

[01:47:56.270 --> 01:48:02.190]

[01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:20.810]
But you're just a little bit. We don't have too many 10 year olds listen three four in the morning, okay?

[01:48:21.570 --> 01:48:25.390]

[01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:21.910]
Yeah, a line one that got the answer to the

[01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:27.250]
To where that line came from you forgot about the Afro man movie with the Jay and Silent Bob in it

[01:49:29.130 --> 01:49:32.030]
The Afro man movie the video I

[01:49:33.970 --> 01:49:36.170]
Never saw the video sure you did

[01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:42.190]
Where do you think we got the audio from mr. Well, I got it. He's he's doing so many of it

Here's somebody with the answer to our question. Hello. Yes, hi. Yeah, are you great?

[01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:54.930]
I have to answer your question. Okay. The opening scene when he's dealing with the

[01:49:56.110 --> 01:49:57.050]
Undertaker and he wants

[01:49:58.030 --> 01:49:59.510]
Any Undertaker wants to

[01:50:00.090 --> 01:50:01.270]
Now have the you know

[01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:09.090]
Retribution for what was done to his daughter and he said if you had come to me to the police and the few

[01:50:09.090 --> 01:50:10.850]
Right, you know when he

[01:50:10.850 --> 01:50:16.310]
He said then they would fear you yeah, and then they would fear you then they would fear you not now

[01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:20.050]
Right then they would fear you see and I should know that cuz I just got through playing

[01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:26.050]
When he says how much do I pay you and he says what have I ever done? Yeah?

[01:50:27.230 --> 01:50:29.910]
Thank you not pounding you have a good day. Thank you so much

[01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:34.730]
Ronald saved me from the whole weekend because we had the line wrong anyway, although that's what that's what she says and

[01:50:34.730 --> 01:50:41.330]
Got father three kind of says Michael now they will fear you and he turns around looks at her and says maybe they should fear you and then it's so

[01:50:41.330 --> 01:50:47.170]
Oh, it's so lame. It's so sad and you want to cry? I mean I still say it's a highly underrated movie

[01:50:47.170 --> 01:50:48.550]
It's got a lot of good stuff in there

[01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:52.790]
It's got too much of the truth that the people like Dennis can't handle but it's just really great

[01:50:53.310 --> 01:50:57.850]
But it but they did so many things to try to destroy it and I think effectively they did a good job

[01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:01.290]
Including her with a big schnauz

[01:51:02.330 --> 01:51:08.710]
And the corny lines and bring it back lines. We've been through this a million times bring it back lines from the other two that don't fit in at all

[01:51:11.070 --> 01:51:12.910]
Maybe they ought to fear you and

[01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:19.050]
See that that's part of his you know his stick again where he does stuff. It's just so so lame, you know

[01:51:19.530 --> 01:51:25.330]
He can be so brilliant and then another hand do things that he just says it in such a way like like we're watching a comedy movie

[01:51:25.330 --> 01:51:27.830]
You know, hey, here's the funny. Yeah Godfather

[01:51:28.570 --> 01:51:30.910]
Here's the comedian gangsters. They're a panic

defour Joey sucked

[01:53:36.930 --> 01:53:52.750]
If you do your job, pose bye-bye, hit say, when I come in a room you leave it you leave without turning around.

[01:53:53.890 --> 01:54:00.310]
It's no wonder they deal as that long.

[01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:05.890]
Your smile is the most difficult of the job.

[01:54:06.630 --> 01:54:09.470]
Pose these five guys their job.

[01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:14.250]
And now they're suing you when you're white.

[01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:17.090]
Your smile is the most difficult of the job.

[01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:19.850]
And keep you speak to me, it's mom.

[01:54:20.630 --> 01:54:23.330]
So that your back slows your guard.

[01:54:24.050 --> 01:54:27.650]
This kind of treatment just ain't right.

[01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:31.110]
You slice the low.

[01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:34.030]
See somebody says Rocky, let's get Rocky on the list.

[01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:36.770]
A lot of people are also talking about Tadja Shire, so why not?

[01:54:36.890 --> 01:54:37.270]
About Connie.

[01:54:38.390 --> 01:54:40.550]
Put Rocky on there, then they will fear you.

[01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:42.970]
Somebody says the sound of music.

[01:54:44.130 --> 01:54:47.010]
The hills are alive with the sound of music.

[01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.830]
Never saw it.

[01:54:48.350 --> 01:54:49.130]
I'm making fun of it.

[01:54:49.170 --> 01:54:49.630]
Never saw it.

[01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:50.770]
And either of them.

[01:54:50.890 --> 01:54:52.430]
I don't watch musicals.

I got no baggage in my life without certain watch music.

[01:54:56.550 --> 01:54:57.250]
Oh, rain man.

[01:54:57.610 --> 01:54:58.690]
I've seen that a couple of times.

[01:54:58.950 --> 01:54:59.430]
Fear for.

[01:55:00.110 --> 01:55:01.190]
Thought third man.

[01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:02.650]
No, but by the way, yeah.

[01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:04.730]
By the way, something.

[01:55:04.910 --> 01:55:07.530]
Yeah, thank you, South Alcone for bringing us some more water.

[01:55:08.130 --> 01:55:08.610]
Thanks, Sal.

[01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:13.950]
Let's see, I understand that old fags and young beaners don't like westerns,

[01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:15.250]
but I vote for tombstone.

[01:55:15.250 --> 01:55:17.110]
Have a nice day in paradise, it says.

[01:55:17.990 --> 01:55:18.790]
From Howard.

[01:55:21.810 --> 01:55:22.690]
Oh, that's cute.

[01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:24.310]
Tombstone.

[01:55:24.590 --> 01:55:24.830]
Okay.

[01:55:25.290 --> 01:55:25.930]
Perfect remote.

[01:55:26.050 --> 01:55:26.630]
I don't put that on.

[01:55:26.710 --> 01:55:27.070]
It's a joke.

[01:55:27.370 --> 01:55:27.650]
I say.

[01:55:28.290 --> 01:55:29.930]
And why did you fast me the gym, Sarni thing?

[01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:32.970]
I already mentioned at the beginning of the show that they wasted a lot of time talking about this,

[01:55:33.070 --> 01:55:34.450]
and Gully was hyperventilating this morning.

[01:55:35.650 --> 01:55:37.550]
Why would he even dignify this with a response?

[01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:38.970]
So I'm not going to talk about this.

[01:55:40.150 --> 01:55:42.250]
About QM personalities and about outrageous.

[01:55:42.590 --> 01:55:44.670]
Hey, Sarni, like I said, you're ugly or an idiot.

[01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:47.690]
You wouldn't know a radio show if they stuck it up your ass, but we'll give it a shot.

[01:55:47.690 --> 01:55:48.570]
Okay, get lost.

[01:55:49.230 --> 01:55:52.710]
Go right about something you know about, which certainly has nothing to do with the broadcasting.

[01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:54.330]
Well, what a different way.

[01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:56.070]
I mean, why even talk about it?

[01:55:56.610 --> 01:55:58.970]
The broadcast columns and the sports broadcast columns.

[01:55:58.970 --> 01:56:02.430]
They have in the newspapers here as opposed to the juvenile sophomore at Crap.

[01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:03.670]
You're reading South Florida.

[01:56:05.290 --> 01:56:07.450]
Here we got four major daily newspapers.

[01:56:07.930 --> 01:56:12.310]
South Florida's got two marginal papers that the parakeets jump out of the cage when you try to put it in there on the bottom.

[01:56:12.570 --> 01:56:13.270]
They jump right out.

[01:56:15.150 --> 01:56:17.310]
Got five or one 57 votes.

[01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:19.090]
Star Wars 32.

[01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:21.330]
Wizard of Oz 24.

[01:56:22.490 --> 01:56:23.630]
Christmas story 16.

[01:56:24.070 --> 01:56:25.510]
I'm only going to give the ones with ten or more.

[01:56:26.090 --> 01:56:28.710]
Caddy Shack 13, airplane 13, jaws 12.

[01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:31.790]
It's a wonderful life 11 and the 10 commandments has 10.

[01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:33.690]
So you'll be benefit of that.

[01:56:33.810 --> 01:56:35.490]
Commandments are like 12.

[01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:38.110]
Well, or nine.

[01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:40.610]
That would be really bad, but it's got 10.

[01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:47.130]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:56:47.610 --> 01:56:49.950]
What movie have you watched the most times?

[01:56:50.170 --> 01:56:58.490]
What one movie have you watched more than any other movie in your life in the theater on TV on an airplane as a child?

[01:56:58.810 --> 01:57:04.530]
As a child, as an adult, as a human being from the time you were born until this moment right now, until a second.

[01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:07.130]
Got it? Have I made myself clear?

[01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.550]
No.

[01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:08.630]
Well, let me try it again.

[01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:12.230]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:14.110]
Hey, me. How you doing?

[01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.850]
Okay, sir.

[01:57:15.770 --> 01:57:18.650]
How about the Josie Wells out low Josie Wells?

[01:57:19.170 --> 01:57:19.490]
Excellent.

[01:57:20.370 --> 01:57:20.810]
I'm really.

[01:57:22.210 --> 01:57:23.910]
I think I ever saw it.

[01:57:24.650 --> 01:57:25.510]
Do you never saw it?

[01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:26.610]
No, I don't believe.

[01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:28.610]
Oh, man.

[01:57:29.010 --> 01:57:30.110]
George is probably seeing it.

[01:57:30.190 --> 01:57:31.690]
Like 20 times, at least.

[01:57:32.530 --> 01:57:33.470]
5, 30, man.

[01:57:33.930 --> 01:57:35.170]
Okay, man. Sonner, thank you.

[01:57:35.170 --> 01:57:36.130]
Oh, Lord of the Rings.

[01:57:37.730 --> 01:57:40.210]
Like I said, it's on there. Thank you.

[01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:43.290]
He's starting to move on to other Lord of the Rings. He's moving on to other names now.

[01:57:44.250 --> 01:57:46.290]
See, I was so impressed there because you said, yeah, absolutely.

[01:57:46.670 --> 01:57:48.290]
And then he's starting with a directive.

[01:57:48.290 --> 01:57:49.990]
I'd let him on. He'd probably name another one's now.

[01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:53.150]
What one movie have you seen more than any movies?

[01:57:53.410 --> 01:57:55.230]
What one flavor of ice cream?

[01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:59.690]
Oh, good. God. It's so hard.

[01:58:00.090 --> 01:58:03.590]
It's just, it's mind-boggling how difficult it is.

[01:58:03.590 --> 01:58:04.830]
It's so hard.

[01:58:04.970 --> 01:58:05.630]
You're right, sweetheart.

[01:58:06.190 --> 01:58:07.130]
Hard is a rock.

[01:58:08.410 --> 01:58:10.090]
Don't start talking about that Aaron again now.

[01:58:12.850 --> 01:58:16.090]
I think that being a word probably blushes every time I mention that name.

[01:58:16.190 --> 01:58:18.590]
I can't see from here, but I almost can.

[01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:21.710]
The infrared glow coming from his pus.

[01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:24.450]
Do you really expect people to believe?

[01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:25.370]
Yeah.

[01:58:27.950 --> 01:58:32.350]
5607-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Light.

[01:58:32.350 --> 01:58:33.670]
He broke this too much on that thing.

[01:58:34.730 --> 01:58:35.690]
Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.430]
Tamarack.

[01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.270]
Hello?

[01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:40.150]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:44.310]
Yeah, I didn't understand the question, Neil, but I had it.

[01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:48.190]
I've done, no one's going to beat the Godfather.

[01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.790]
There's nobody.

[01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:50.270]
No one's going to beat that.

[01:58:51.610 --> 01:58:54.770]
I know you're going to puket with, if I say Billy Bob Dort,

[01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:58.470]
and I didn't even know who he was, but Slim Blade was my first,

[01:59:00.270 --> 01:59:02.210]
before that other call, I said, a bunch.

[01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:05.910]
But I would say the most I'd say is one of the first Columbus,

[01:59:06.570 --> 01:59:11.570]
which ties in with Leslie Nielsen, in a sense that I've watched it so many times.

[01:59:11.570 --> 01:59:12.610]
It puts me to sleep.

[01:59:15.830 --> 01:59:18.370]
But Slim Blade, I've watched so many times,

[01:59:18.370 --> 01:59:23.290]
that it's just fascinating to see.

[01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:23.590]
See.

[01:59:24.850 --> 01:59:26.050]
Okay, thanks.

[01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:41.890]
Oh, we're fine.

[01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:45.550]
Now, what do you say?

[01:59:46.730 --> 01:59:47.630]
Sting Blade.

[01:59:50.410 --> 01:59:53.530]
560-560 on the AT&T in Verizon, Marvellous Line.

[01:59:55.330 --> 01:59:56.570]
Here's a call from Crayl Springs.

[01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.890]
Hello?

[01:59:57.410 --> 01:59:57.710]
Hey, Neil.

[01:59:58.150 --> 01:59:58.550]
Yes, sir.

[01:59:58.750 --> 02:00:00.210]
Listen to you, and what about Blazing Saddles?

[02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:02.310]
What about it?

[02:00:02.370 --> 02:00:02.750]
Is that yours?

[02:00:03.190 --> 02:00:04.470]
Yeah, that's my favorite one.

[02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:05.450]
Do we have that on there?

[02:00:05.530 --> 02:00:05.690]
Georgia?

[02:00:05.690 --> 02:00:06.630]
I thought we had that on there.

[02:00:06.730 --> 02:00:06.910]
We do.

[02:00:07.210 --> 02:00:07.790]
Oh, it is on there.

[02:00:08.490 --> 02:00:09.450]
Okay, I didn't hear it before.

[02:00:09.590 --> 02:00:09.890]
That's why.

[02:00:10.190 --> 02:00:10.750]
What about one more?

[02:00:10.830 --> 02:00:11.390]
Can I ask for one more?

[02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:12.110]
No, no.

[02:00:13.690 --> 02:00:14.570]
What do they do?

[02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:17.590]
What is wrong with you, people?

[02:00:17.690 --> 02:00:19.470]
Don't you understand the answer is,

[02:00:19.630 --> 02:00:21.590]
you can't do more than one.

[02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.510]
Pfft.

[02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:35.490]
Crank it up.

[02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:41.250]
It's enough to drive you up, Ian.

[02:00:46.970 --> 02:00:48.430]
I hate this place.

[02:00:48.930 --> 02:00:50.690]
Nothing works here.

[02:00:55.130 --> 02:00:55.690]
Pfft.

[02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:59.430]
Can I add one more?

[02:00:59.750 --> 02:00:59.930]
No.

[02:01:00.530 --> 02:01:00.950]
Two more?

[02:01:01.130 --> 02:01:01.310]
No.

[02:01:01.570 --> 02:01:02.190]
Five more.

[02:01:02.650 --> 02:01:03.110]
How many more?

[02:01:03.190 --> 02:01:04.030]
Not third, man.

[02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:05.390]
He'll still be.

[02:01:08.690 --> 02:01:10.650]
Have you noticed I should point out?

[02:01:11.410 --> 02:01:12.150]
It's Friday.

[02:01:12.710 --> 02:01:12.950]
Yeah.

[02:01:12.950 --> 02:01:15.850]
Have we had one person, well, I'm not talking about that.

[02:01:16.130 --> 02:01:18.530]
Obviously, I've noticed very alertly and enthusiastically.

[02:01:18.930 --> 02:01:21.690]
Having had one person call it and said they saw a Requiem for a Dream,

[02:01:21.930 --> 02:01:23.270]
which we just planned some music there,

[02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:27.570]
or happiness, as a result of us talking about this.

[02:01:27.570 --> 02:01:27.650]
Right.

[02:01:28.150 --> 02:01:30.030]
Gully, what are some of the other ones we've talked about?

[02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:31.770]
Memento, which I still haven't watched,

[02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:32.790]
and one guy says,

[02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:34.870]
if you get through the first 15 minutes, it'll be a miracle.

[02:01:36.130 --> 02:01:37.930]
How about the Minnesota Wild, by the way?

[02:01:38.050 --> 02:01:38.150]
Oh!

[02:01:38.290 --> 02:01:38.990]
He's going there, boys.

[02:01:40.150 --> 02:01:41.030]
If you'd mentioned that,

[02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:42.310]
I know you're very hockey intensive,

[02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:43.310]
Wild Up Sets Vancouver.

[02:01:43.310 --> 02:01:45.930]
Right there in Vancouver last night coming from two bulls down,

[02:01:46.270 --> 02:01:47.170]
and went in four to three.

[02:01:48.490 --> 02:01:51.410]
And they're going to the semi-finals, the conference finals.

[02:01:51.930 --> 02:01:53.470]
Boy, the networks are crap in their pants.

[02:01:53.670 --> 02:01:54.270]
Oh, brother.

[02:01:54.930 --> 02:01:57.930]
The Minnesota Wild, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Ottawa Senators,

[02:01:58.090 --> 02:01:59.930]
and the very terminally boring New Jersey Devils.

[02:02:00.190 --> 02:02:01.190]
That's the final four.

[02:02:01.830 --> 02:02:04.050]
The ratings are dropping like a rock.

[02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:05.810]
Man.

[02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:09.130]
NHL is in big, big trouble, deep crap.

[02:02:09.130 --> 02:02:10.530]
You can smell it.

[02:02:10.770 --> 02:02:11.710]
It's very sad.

[02:02:12.330 --> 02:02:14.410]
Great sport, but badly to shift Gary Bettman,

[02:02:14.970 --> 02:02:16.530]
Bob Goodenheim, all a bunch of idiots.

[02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:18.890]
A lot of greedy goofballs out there.

[02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:21.150]
Guys that'd be out there shoveling snow

[02:02:21.150 --> 02:02:22.290]
in the middle of July somewhere,

[02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:24.710]
way to hell up north by the Arctic Circle.

[02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:27.890]
These guys are getting paid $78 million a year.

[02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:31.050]
Couldn't spell Georgia's name if they're like dependent on it,

[02:02:31.330 --> 02:02:33.070]
with a G-O-R-J, or an H.

[02:02:34.210 --> 02:02:35.190]
And there you go.

[02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:37.090]
Not kidding enough.

[02:02:37.090 --> 02:02:39.010]
Well, we don't want no salary cap.

[02:02:39.010 --> 02:02:41.030]
We don't want him by telling us a limit on what we can make.

[02:02:41.130 --> 02:02:42.470]
Okay, whatever you guys say, okay.

[02:02:42.650 --> 02:02:43.370]
Good luck to you.

[02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:44.630]
Good luck to your shoveling crap.

[02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:47.250]
How do you like that?

[02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:49.390]
A qualifying race in 151 and 1.

[02:02:49.590 --> 02:02:50.250]
Can you believe that?

[02:02:51.850 --> 02:02:52.050]
What?

[02:02:53.050 --> 02:02:53.770]
20-Sit.

[02:02:53.970 --> 02:02:55.430]
Go talk to Chris Christophe Robota.

[02:02:55.590 --> 02:02:57.230]
Maybe Randy Welfl, who he pulls us straight now.

[02:02:58.470 --> 02:03:01.010]
26 past 11 at 560 WQM.

[02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:02.750]
The Neal Deals just keep rolling along.

[02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:04.490]
Just like in the case of Ahns,

[02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:06.070]
go rollin' along so to the Neal Deals.

[02:03:06.590 --> 02:03:09.410]

current and form a military personnel, get an additional $750 rebate from your friends at Halip.

[02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:48.550]
trucks and SUVs that you'll fall in love with, and if other car dealers say you're credit sucks,

[02:03:48.890 --> 02:03:49.310]
they don't care.

[02:03:49.470 --> 02:03:52.430]
Halipane will cut you deal some way somehow, even if you want a new Defo.

[02:03:52.830 --> 02:03:57.290]
Don't forget to stop by Halipane Test Drive, the all new and powerful Pontiac Grand Prix wider at it too.

[02:03:57.290 --> 02:04:01.570]
Halipane X GMC, they're unbelievable, they're unbeatable, they're 134-1,

[02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:05.930]
South Dixie Highway in their open seven days a week too, that's US-1 right across from the falls.

[02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:12.150]

Halipane X GMC, we're supporting you on 5.60, 2am.

[02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:32.090]
Come on, too long.

[02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:33.470]
Get taken a staring person.

[02:04:44.570 --> 02:04:50.430]
They watching the shows, so stupid everyone knows

[02:04:51.430 --> 02:04:53.650]
that the driver was first.

[02:04:53.670 --> 02:05:02.230]
The first analogy might be the worst, but I gotta tell you, I sat and watched it in his way.

[02:05:07.290 --> 02:05:13.730]
I hope the fast-slow Grand Prix might not even stay.

[02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:26.230]
I think I got a truce, a truce, a free-assity TV, what I see,

[02:05:26.930 --> 02:05:34.590]
to this day that's on MTV, video, the poll of American Idol,

[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:40.530]
say, a friend, find out they should wear their pants.

[02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:50.810]
I'm praying at church, don't let them cancel their search,

[02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:58.870]
but say, my soul, I even like an anicole, extreme week over,

[02:05:59.870 --> 02:06:07.210]
show me your air and lie your heart, don't need no actors,

[02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:11.790]
don't need no script, don't need no parts.

[02:06:14.510 --> 02:06:20.730]
I think I got a truce, a truce, a free-assity TV,

[02:06:21.610 --> 02:06:26.730]
meets my folks, Monday that's on MTV's page,

[02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:31.830]
I'm so sure, I'll be watching big brother,

[02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:37.830]
sick, upscrew, just give me women, I don't.

[02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:40.790]
Oh, number 33, 27, I'll know in five, 60.

[02:06:41.050 --> 02:06:44.070]
In Candy's check, I do like to see where he and Bob Barker get into that brawl.

[02:06:44.410 --> 02:06:46.830]
I don't know, golf course, is that Candy's check?

[02:06:47.410 --> 02:06:48.910]
Isn't it? No.

[02:06:50.770 --> 02:06:53.630]
That's an out of his handler movie, that's a happy Gilmore you're talking about.

[02:06:53.710 --> 02:06:55.870]
Oh, happy Gilmore, like I said, happy Doug Gilmore.

[02:06:55.870 --> 02:06:58.250]
Hang it up by the way, Dougie, enough's enough.

[02:06:59.410 --> 02:07:01.530]
What am I getting confused about the golf movie, see?

[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:02.430]
Right, they're all the same.

[02:07:04.030 --> 02:07:05.790]
Now, here's one, how about Animal House?

[02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:08.710]
We better get that on there right away, because certainly on QAM,

[02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:10.950]
I would say Animal House, if we had the sports arts voting,

[02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:14.290]
Animal House and Candy's check, just beat everything else hands down.

[02:07:16.190 --> 02:07:17.150]
Right? Okay.

[02:07:17.470 --> 02:07:19.390]
Because if you tune into any of our sports shows,

[02:07:19.670 --> 02:07:20.870]
anytime that they're talking movies,

[02:07:21.290 --> 02:07:22.650]
they don't talk about the Godfather,

[02:07:22.830 --> 02:07:23.810]
they're certainly not about network,

[02:07:23.810 --> 02:07:25.430]
any of the stuff we're hearing about today,

[02:07:25.630 --> 02:07:28.850]
they talk about Animal House and Candy's check,

[02:07:29.530 --> 02:07:30.890]
and maybe on Happy Gilmore.

[02:07:34.170 --> 02:07:36.670]
You'd be unhappy too if you tore up your knee in the first game back.

[02:07:37.770 --> 02:07:39.990]
Anyway, here's one, going my way with Bing Crosby.

[02:07:40.290 --> 02:07:42.010]
Oh, I watch it every year at Christmas,

[02:07:42.170 --> 02:07:43.450]
and I cry every time.

[02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:45.490]
Got it going my way?

[02:07:45.730 --> 02:07:45.930]
Okay.

[02:07:47.850 --> 02:07:49.210]
Don't sound hostile now.

[02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.550]
I'm not.

[02:07:50.130 --> 02:07:51.230]
Yes, you are. Is he hostile?

[02:07:52.010 --> 02:07:52.370]
Yes.

[02:07:53.530 --> 02:07:56.870]
In your pool, why is there an apostrophe in the Blues Brothers?

[02:07:57.130 --> 02:07:58.150]
Oh, I don't do the spell.

[02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:59.330]
It says the Blues with the...

[02:07:59.330 --> 02:08:02.090]
Because Eric's an idiot, or probably Beanervoy done it.

[02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:03.310]
Huh?

[02:08:04.030 --> 02:08:04.730]
Sure, why not?

[02:08:05.610 --> 02:08:07.550]
Who's responsible for the spelling on that?

[02:08:08.570 --> 02:08:10.750]
There's no apostrophe in the Blues Brothers.

[02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:13.130]
Singing the Blues with an apostrophe?

[02:08:13.610 --> 02:08:15.530]
The St. Louis Blues with an apostrophe?

[02:08:15.750 --> 02:08:16.190]
Come on.

[02:08:17.210 --> 02:08:20.690]
It says, is Eric an illiterate check-ass or just a Schmidthead?

[02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:22.750]
Well, we'll take a poll.

[02:08:23.610 --> 02:08:24.770]
Or is it Beanervoy?

[02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:26.070]
Like I said, we'll take a poll.

[02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:28.910]
Now, Eric's very fussy about the spelling.

[02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:30.330]
Even though he screws it up most of the time.

[02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.070]
So he don't mind being corrected on that.

[02:08:32.290 --> 02:08:33.270]
Unless it's Beanervoy that's directing.

[02:08:33.710 --> 02:08:34.650]
Then he gets really hostile.

[02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:37.890]
It starts eating just frustration, eating just jammed it down his push.

[02:08:39.050 --> 02:08:41.610]
Here's one, Bachelor Party, since Peter and Miami Beach,

[02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:44.450]
Bachelor Party with Tom Hanks never saw it, never heard of it.

[02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:47.310]
But Peter says he's seen it.

[02:08:47.310 --> 02:08:48.250]
About 30, man.

[02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:49.130]
A zillion times.

[02:08:49.710 --> 02:08:50.430]
You seen it?

[02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:51.550]
I've seen it.

[02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:52.630]
And it was okay.

[02:08:52.830 --> 02:08:55.390]
I can't imagine seeing it more than, uh...

[02:08:55.930 --> 02:08:56.290]
Why?

[02:08:56.550 --> 02:08:56.730]
Whatever.

[02:08:57.390 --> 02:08:57.650]
Okay.

[02:08:58.330 --> 02:08:58.970]
Now, Slangblade.

[02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:01.630]
Now, we already had Slangblade from that inquirer in call or moments ago.

[02:09:01.770 --> 02:09:03.170]
But here's the, uh, monkey around, man.

[02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:04.870]
Maybe that was him before doing a voice.

[02:09:05.730 --> 02:09:06.250]
The monkey, man.

[02:09:08.070 --> 02:09:10.110]
Slangblade is, as I've seen it, about 100 times.

[02:09:10.230 --> 02:09:12.350]
Billy Bob Thornton, he wrote, directed, and started a movie.

[02:09:12.590 --> 02:09:13.930]
Where it says, here, stared in the movie.

[02:09:14.630 --> 02:09:17.110]
It's fantastic, movie, heartwarming, and compelling.

[02:09:18.610 --> 02:09:20.130]
Go see it, superb.

[02:09:20.490 --> 02:09:21.610]
What do you mean, go see it?

[02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:22.450]
Go see it.

[02:09:23.590 --> 02:09:24.650]
Where am I going to go see it?

[02:09:24.710 --> 02:09:25.390]
Living room over there.

[02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:26.490]
Oh, okay.

[02:09:27.790 --> 02:09:28.550]
Is that count?

[02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.550]
Sure.

[02:09:30.550 --> 02:09:32.090]
Okay, we got that on there, Slangblade.

[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:34.130]
I'm not, like I said, I'm even writing to many of these now,

[02:09:34.190 --> 02:09:35.630]
because the list is out of control now.

[02:09:35.910 --> 02:09:36.570]
Started out with...

[02:09:36.570 --> 02:09:37.390]
Not 30, man.

[02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:38.410]
And now it's more like 300.

[02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:39.990]
But that's okay.

[02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:41.490]
I knew there'd be a lot on here.

[02:09:43.030 --> 02:09:44.250]
Different strokes for different folks.

[02:09:44.730 --> 02:09:45.370]
325 movies.

[02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:46.690]
I mean, votes.

[02:09:48.770 --> 02:09:50.830]
Look at the list of ones that don't have any votes yet.

[02:09:51.150 --> 02:09:52.090]
Which I have for the life of me.

[02:09:52.190 --> 02:09:53.730]
Oceans 11, and somebody did say that.

[02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:55.290]
You listen to the goddamn tape, okay?

[02:09:55.530 --> 02:09:57.190]
I think you're a teaming up with Tom Jerker.

[02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:00.350]
Trying to get him to write something about you.

[02:10:01.810 --> 02:10:03.130]
Did he ever write anything about you?

[02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:06.610]
Oh, remember there was that one article

[02:10:06.610 --> 02:10:09.610]
where you were grooming me, because the show is like Fitty Fitty now.

[02:10:09.710 --> 02:10:10.730]
Oh, yeah, oh, I got it.

[02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:11.230]
Wait a minute.

[02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.990]
I got it here.

[02:10:16.430 --> 02:10:17.110]
Oh, yeah.

[02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:25.850]
Now maybe I finally schmit came.

[02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:26.890]
I must have tossed it over.

[02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:28.930]
We're getting real yellow and still kind of like Tom's head.

[02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:32.170]
And that's right, I'm grooming George to like fill it.

[02:10:32.170 --> 02:10:34.370]
And I'm just going to call in this show for many more around a world.

[02:10:34.530 --> 02:10:35.470]
It's the mood strikes me.

[02:10:35.610 --> 02:10:35.830]
Right.

[02:10:36.330 --> 02:10:36.870]
And they're going to pay.

[02:10:37.030 --> 02:10:39.550]
And then there was that the same story about Greg ought to have,

[02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:41.650]
you know, how he ought to have sleepless nights,

[02:10:41.650 --> 02:10:43.370]
because he's never going to know what I asked for next.

[02:10:43.370 --> 02:10:44.310]
That was the same column.

[02:10:44.510 --> 02:10:44.670]
Right.

[02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:48.730]
What I'm going to demand, excuse me, not ask for what I'm going to demand next.

[02:10:48.850 --> 02:10:50.450]
Did I demand this studio here?

[02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:50.690]
No.

[02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.950]
No.

[02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:56.410]
Tom, it's just amazing to me the lack of concept you have of what,

[02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:57.610]
well, why haven't I go into it?

[02:10:57.690 --> 02:10:59.170]
You know, he just, it's so frustrating.

[02:11:00.130 --> 02:11:02.070]
Which is why I won't talk to those vosos anymore,

[02:11:02.170 --> 02:11:04.350]
because you tell them one thing, you try to split it into me,

[02:11:04.370 --> 02:11:05.730]
you try to be like, you know, right up front.

[02:11:05.930 --> 02:11:07.810]
And then they write something, whatever they want to write anyway.

[02:11:09.670 --> 02:11:11.410]
Oh, gee, but I wrote nice things about you.

[02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:13.610]
But how about write something accurate for once, okay?

[02:11:13.830 --> 02:11:15.130]
Just write that I'm a miserable prick.

[02:11:15.310 --> 02:11:16.310]
That would make me happy, Tom.

[02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:21.110]
Write something about the guy they win a rating book.

[02:11:21.210 --> 02:11:21.710]
You're in town.

[02:11:22.190 --> 02:11:25.090]
Why not write something that somebody would give somebody some information

[02:11:25.090 --> 02:11:27.390]
unlike Kevin Bastard, who just writes about,

[02:11:27.390 --> 02:11:28.750]
here's the top 10, 12 plus.

[02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:30.970]
Wow, that's having pretty heavy duty.

[02:11:31.130 --> 02:11:32.450]
Hey, Joyce, this is Tom Tricker.

[02:11:32.690 --> 02:11:34.250]
Would you just pass along to the LNM,

[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:36.410]
but the reason I call was that I thought maybe you could help me out.

[02:11:36.570 --> 02:11:38.230]
I've been trying to get those goddamn ratings.

[02:11:38.230 --> 02:11:40.010]
Jeff Lindsay's going home sick.

[02:11:40.250 --> 02:11:42.650]
Josh Darryl says he doesn't have the authority to give them to me.

[02:11:43.090 --> 02:11:43.850]
You know, I'll call Greg Reed.

[02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:44.710]
I couldn't get him.

[02:11:45.210 --> 02:11:48.050]
So, you know, and then the last number they gave me was to call you.

[02:11:48.170 --> 02:11:49.850]
If somebody would get me the goddamn ratings,

[02:11:50.090 --> 02:11:50.710]
I'll tell you what you think is going on.

[02:11:50.710 --> 02:11:51.190]
Quit swearing Tom.

[02:11:51.870 --> 02:11:54.770]
Anyway, I'm only kidding, but that is the problem

[02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:56.250]
and I do want to do a story on it.

[02:11:56.250 --> 02:11:57.530]
And I'm just having trouble getting them.

[02:11:57.610 --> 02:11:58.450]
So I'll talk to you.

[02:11:58.570 --> 02:11:58.650]
Bye.

[02:11:58.870 --> 02:12:00.130]
Yeah, we'll talk to each other.

[02:12:00.250 --> 02:12:02.590]
Tom will be on a 10-30 night after the Marlon baseball game.

[02:12:02.590 --> 02:12:04.090]
I hope you people give him what for, okay?

[02:12:04.290 --> 02:12:04.830]
Let him have it.

[02:12:05.250 --> 02:12:06.030]
Let him have it.

[02:12:07.650 --> 02:12:09.550]
Tom, that we're all fired up and pissed off

[02:12:09.550 --> 02:12:11.870]
about his refusal to deal with the fact.

[02:12:12.130 --> 02:12:13.590]
I mean, Moe finally had a decent book.

[02:12:13.810 --> 02:12:15.850]
Finally, we've been waiting over a year for this.

[02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.850]
They're all my, yeah, a year.

[02:12:18.390 --> 02:12:20.010]
Finally, has a decent book there in the morning.

[02:12:20.690 --> 02:12:22.110]
The Humper went back up a little bit.

[02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:24.030]
You're pretty good, although the Schmidt,

[02:12:24.050 --> 02:12:25.870]
the Schmidt, mysterious, just beat the Schmidt out of me.

[02:12:25.930 --> 02:12:26.150]
You know this?

[02:12:26.530 --> 02:12:27.330]
Yeah, well, wartime.

[02:12:28.050 --> 02:12:28.330]
Mm-hmm.

[02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:30.690]
War time, rush time.

[02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.610]
But anyway, there's a lot of stuff going on.

[02:12:33.610 --> 02:12:35.210]
But little Tommy, you'll never get it from him.

[02:12:35.210 --> 02:12:37.990]
You'll never get it from these two newspapers in South Florida.

[02:12:38.210 --> 02:12:39.150]
You can bet your life on it.

[02:12:39.270 --> 02:12:41.010]
You can bet Tom Jek is life on it, okay?

[02:12:43.690 --> 02:12:46.330]
And I'm telling you, even the guy that introduced

[02:12:46.330 --> 02:12:48.310]
the resolution of the Brown Commission who called us,

[02:12:48.410 --> 02:12:49.730]
Randy, whatever his name was, the lawyer,

[02:12:49.850 --> 02:12:51.270]
which he's probably busy with a life.

[02:12:52.390 --> 02:12:54.610]
But you would think that he would have written him a letter.

[02:12:54.810 --> 02:12:55.730]
Letter to the editor saying,

[02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:57.590]
how come you buried this story?

[02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:58.410]
You didn't put it in.

[02:12:58.470 --> 02:13:00.190]
It's a major story into all the other newspaper.

[02:13:00.650 --> 02:13:01.650]
How come that's not in there?

[02:13:01.810 --> 02:13:02.970]
Who's to say that he didn't?

[02:13:03.210 --> 02:13:04.090]
I don't know if he said that.

[02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:05.130]
That was going to be my next point.

[02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:06.350]
In fact, maybe he did.

[02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:08.810]
And they're just selectively not putting letters in there.

[02:13:09.110 --> 02:13:09.310]
Shh.

[02:13:10.090 --> 02:13:12.390]
You talk about managing and burying the news.

[02:13:12.530 --> 02:13:14.170]
And I don't give a crap what anybody tells you.

[02:13:14.430 --> 02:13:15.510]
That's a major story.

[02:13:16.890 --> 02:13:19.170]
It's a hell of a lot bigger story than some Jackass

[02:13:19.170 --> 02:13:21.290]
loud mouth talk show host with a gigantic ego

[02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:23.350]
is getting maybe tossed off and maybe not

[02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:26.270]
from the diversity board, which has got a whole bunch of members on it.

[02:13:26.290 --> 02:13:27.090]
Not third of me.

[02:13:27.210 --> 02:13:28.810]
Yeah, which doesn't do a damn thing anyway.

[02:13:28.890 --> 02:13:30.230]
It was just a figurehead bunch of crap.

[02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:32.130]
Got little Brian Craig on there.

[02:13:32.130 --> 02:13:33.950]
Oh, Steve, can I be just like you?

[02:13:34.210 --> 02:13:37.370]
Steve, can I be a right wing hateful piece of crap like you, Steve?

[02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:40.570]
Oh my god.

[02:13:41.210 --> 02:13:41.570]
Scandalist.

[02:13:42.610 --> 02:13:44.490]
Scandalist, but that's the level they deal on.

[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:46.430]
You know, it's just that's the level they operate on.

[02:13:47.250 --> 02:13:49.670]
Two of the worst god damn newspapers in the history.

[02:13:49.930 --> 02:13:51.010]
You know, what was his name?

[02:13:51.150 --> 02:13:52.850]
Gutenberg invented a printing press, right?

[02:13:53.290 --> 02:13:54.390]
He would take it back.

[02:13:55.550 --> 02:13:56.430]
He'd say, you know something.

[02:13:56.570 --> 02:13:59.050]
If I knew that they were going to put two newspapers out like that,

[02:13:59.090 --> 02:13:59.930]
I would hide it.

[02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.530]
I'd bury it.

[02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:02.210]
I'd put it right down to basement.

[02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:05.010]
There was a spaceship at Tommy's house, Tom Walling's house.

[02:14:07.450 --> 02:14:08.970]
By the way, don't forget this Tuesday night.

[02:14:09.490 --> 02:14:12.230]
All you perverts out there, Tuesday night, it's the flesh night.

[02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:13.990]
And actually he was kissing Lon on a preview.

[02:14:14.110 --> 02:14:14.730]
It's about time.

[02:14:14.970 --> 02:14:16.110]
Talk about a little bit slow.

[02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:21.290]
I think even in my lifetime, I kiss more girls than Clark Kent.

[02:14:21.570 --> 02:14:22.230]
I'm telling you.

[02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:24.590]
And if I fact, I know it for a fact.

[02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:28.550]
You know, don't just stand there holding your hand, Clark.

[02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:31.950]
I mean, just looking at any eye, just reach over and give her a little peck on a cheek.

[02:14:32.110 --> 02:14:32.310]
Something.

[02:14:32.830 --> 02:14:33.570]
It'll be super.

[02:14:35.650 --> 02:14:36.030]
Man.

[02:14:37.650 --> 02:14:40.110]
Now is there a comment that he has a wife you know?

[02:14:41.050 --> 02:14:42.070]
Who does, Tom Walling?

[02:14:42.670 --> 02:14:43.170]
He does?

[02:14:43.470 --> 02:14:43.690]
Yeah.

[02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:45.470]
Since when? He must have just got married.

[02:14:46.070 --> 02:14:46.410]
I don't know.

[02:14:46.450 --> 02:14:48.050]
It wasn't one of those inquires, the latest ones.

[02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:49.390]
Are you serious?

[02:14:49.630 --> 02:14:50.550]
That's fucking bad.

[02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:51.350]
Oh no!

[02:14:51.930 --> 02:14:52.830]
That fucking bitch.

[02:14:53.230 --> 02:14:54.650]
I wonder why they don't talk about that a lot.

[02:14:56.870 --> 02:15:01.990]
For the same reason, they don't talk about Josh Morris got a wife now too since Dan Stewart was on our show that day.

[02:15:02.190 --> 02:15:03.250]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:07.950]
Hey, for Mother's Day and he's got a wife and babies popping out of there like crazy, like two every five months.

[02:16:04.730 --> 02:16:07.710]
You know how they have these...well, you know score bars. Right?

[02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:16.230]
How they have these bags of like Reese's peanut butter...what do they call those things? They're like M&M's, they're like in plastic bags.

Myzner.

[02:17:20.350 --> 02:17:21.290]
Mr. Mouse.

[02:17:21.930 --> 02:17:25.050]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[02:17:25.830 --> 02:17:27.030]
What do you mean sir?

[02:17:27.310 --> 02:17:31.270]
Why am I reading in the paper? You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:33.490]
Well sir we're just scouting locations.

[02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:37.590]
Jesus I'm scouting CEOs you are killing me.

[02:17:37.870 --> 02:17:41.830]

[02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:43.950]
Hey no I'm screaming.

[02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.750]
I'm screaming.

[02:17:46.570 --> 02:17:47.570]
I'm crying off the vacuum.

[02:17:47.810 --> 02:17:50.590]
I'm screaming. Get that blue bird out of here.

[02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:51.470]
Okay boss.

[02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:56.810]
Myzner but sir look what we don't admit down man had 40 seconds reason incredible.

[02:17:57.050 --> 02:18:00.730]
I don't know what publicly I supported that but you took all the porn away.

[02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:03.350]
You're killing me. I'm going through Gavoscow like kids.

[02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:06.550]
We're just scouting areas calm down.

[02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:09.070]
Listen to me but much don't tell me to calm down.

[02:18:09.070 --> 02:18:10.810]
We got lucky with Lee Rowan's stage.

[02:18:10.990 --> 02:18:11.950]
$128 million.

[02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:14.910]
Now you're trying to ruin the whole network.

[02:18:15.230 --> 02:18:17.070]
What kind of programming are you running?

[02:18:17.210 --> 02:18:18.770]
I'm in my way.

[02:18:18.790 --> 02:18:19.690]
Hang on a minute.

[02:18:19.970 --> 02:18:22.050]
Three months.

[02:18:22.670 --> 02:18:26.170]
You got blue bird crap all over your shoulder.

[02:18:26.810 --> 02:18:29.290]
It's playing yourself up for heaven's sake.

[02:18:30.750 --> 02:18:32.550]
And head off the vacuum cleaner.

[02:18:32.690 --> 02:18:33.550]
Okay boss.

[02:18:34.130 --> 02:18:35.070]
Look God.

[02:18:35.570 --> 02:18:37.350]
Sir the network is fine.

[02:18:37.350 --> 02:18:39.230]
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:42.070]
Good God you're still running James Bond movie.

[02:18:42.330 --> 02:18:43.970]
They're 60 years old.

[02:18:44.170 --> 02:18:47.130]
Why don't you just put steamboat really on and be done with it?

[02:18:47.450 --> 02:18:47.810]
Please don't.

[02:18:47.930 --> 02:18:49.610]
I'd make a couple of damn dollars.

[02:18:50.310 --> 02:18:52.330]
Well the movie division's fine.

[02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:53.830]
You mentioned Lee Rowan's picture.

[02:18:54.030 --> 02:18:57.170]
Now we have the new M Night Shummel on movie coming out later this summer.

[02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.930]
Oh it has signs.

[02:18:58.210 --> 02:18:59.350]
What the hell does that mean?

[02:18:59.670 --> 02:19:00.930]
Stop sign yields sign.

[02:19:01.470 --> 02:19:04.090]
You've got to start swinging some of these titles past me.

[02:19:04.090 --> 02:19:04.930]
Please.

[02:19:05.410 --> 02:19:07.110]
Oh what is it?

[02:19:07.790 --> 02:19:08.310]
Remus.

[02:19:09.970 --> 02:19:10.490]
Remus.

[02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:12.050]
Here you go.

[02:19:12.710 --> 02:19:14.250]
I know you can't hear me.

[02:19:14.670 --> 02:19:15.190]
Remus.

[02:19:15.570 --> 02:19:16.010]
Yes sir.

[02:19:16.170 --> 02:19:17.350]
I'm on the backup planet.

[02:19:18.050 --> 02:19:19.410]
Here's a number of them.

[02:19:19.550 --> 02:19:19.970]
Run the van.

[02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.850]
Get on here.

[02:19:21.070 --> 02:19:22.570]
Remus and take that blue bird.

[02:19:23.790 --> 02:19:24.830]
All right.

[02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:25.730]
Yes sir.

[02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:29.530]
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car.

[02:19:29.690 --> 02:19:30.170]
Why were you?

[02:19:30.410 --> 02:19:31.330]
What do you mean?

[02:19:31.510 --> 02:19:32.350]
I'm about done with you.

[02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:32.710]
What?

[02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:33.590]
Bad done.

[02:19:34.190 --> 02:19:36.190]
I'll put Hannah Starr in your job.

[02:19:37.230 --> 02:19:38.030]
You're terrible.

[02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:38.730]
I'm sorry.

[02:19:38.930 --> 02:19:40.430]
I put Remus in there.

[02:19:40.810 --> 02:19:41.310]
I don't like it.

[02:19:41.370 --> 02:19:43.030]
They present it at Disney Remus.

[02:19:43.630 --> 02:19:44.430]
Oh my.

[02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:46.170]
What a wonderful day.

[02:19:46.650 --> 02:19:47.410]
Get on here.

[02:19:47.530 --> 02:19:48.210]
You're not back.

[02:19:49.230 --> 02:19:50.330]
That's still the best one.

[02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.530]
No doubt.

[02:19:52.390 --> 02:19:53.570]
The problem is still new and boring.

[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.210]
We got faxes up the ass here now.

[02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.910]
Can we say a.

[02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:56.690]
Go with the ass.

[02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:57.810]
I did something terrible.

[02:19:58.030 --> 02:19:58.950]
I hate to admit this.

[02:19:59.110 --> 02:20:00.870]
And I wouldn't have to tell you because you never know.

[02:20:01.830 --> 02:20:02.270]
Yeah.

[02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:06.750]
After that came into my mind again about these score bites is what they're called.

[02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:07.110]
Yeah.

[02:20:07.550 --> 02:20:08.550]
I went into the other room.

[02:20:08.690 --> 02:20:09.870]
I went into my trash bag.

[02:20:10.410 --> 02:20:13.550]
And I dug down to the bottom and here's the I mean it's empty of course.

[02:20:14.210 --> 02:20:15.770]
But here's the package.

[02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:23.030]
A score bites is what they're called buttery toffee crunch enrobed in rich milk chocolate enrobed.

[02:20:23.350 --> 02:20:24.350]
It's not a good one.

[02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:26.430]
Score bites.

[02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:27.590]
You've never had these?

[02:20:28.210 --> 02:20:28.590]
No.

[02:20:28.590 --> 02:20:29.330]
Don't start.

[02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:31.870]
You can take fish food.

[02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:33.930]
You can take Nestle's a turtle.

[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:38.650]
You can take all those other things and toss him down that hole in the floor in Paris in your hotel.

[02:20:38.850 --> 02:20:39.990]
That hole in the flow.

[02:20:41.510 --> 02:20:42.830]
Because score bites.

[02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:44.810]
Oh god are these.

[02:20:45.090 --> 02:20:50.050]
They're so rich and so you know how score and heath bars are like very very rich real sweet.

[02:20:51.170 --> 02:20:52.450]
Well that's what these are.

[02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:58.230]
And what makes it even worse which I also don't have to admit but I'm.

[02:20:59.230 --> 02:21:00.350]
Are you looking at him?

[02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:01.690]
No I'm sniffing it.

[02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:03.030]
What?

[02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:05.410]
No it's still got to smell of that stuff in there.

[02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:06.510]
Are you kidding me?

[02:21:06.710 --> 02:21:08.370]
It was only from two days ago.

[02:21:10.930 --> 02:21:11.730]
The aroma.

[02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.670]
Wow.

[02:21:16.890 --> 02:21:17.510]
I'll tell you what.

[02:21:18.130 --> 02:21:20.250]
I'll just tell him it's a it's a SARS mask.

[02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:22.330]
It's a fancy.

[02:21:23.570 --> 02:21:26.470]
In fact if you turn it around it's just silver on the inside.

[02:21:27.090 --> 02:21:28.670]
That's my SARS mask.

[02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:31.190]
Oh my god is that.

[02:21:31.730 --> 02:21:33.270]
I'm gonna get rid of it okay.

[02:21:33.510 --> 02:21:33.770]
All right.

[02:21:33.850 --> 02:21:36.290]
Until one o'clock when I'm gonna go run out and get about four bags more.

[02:21:37.290 --> 02:21:38.330]
Okay back to our poll.

[02:21:38.490 --> 02:21:40.090]
The poll question is which I forget already.

[02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:44.530]
What movie have you watched the most time and you know something I have a red this article be I'll save the facts for a minute.

[02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:46.250]
A nation of cowards.

[02:21:46.650 --> 02:21:47.330]
Oh please.

[02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:48.070]
Yeah.

[02:21:48.070 --> 02:21:48.570]
Told you.

[02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:53.470]

[02:21:54.970 --> 02:21:57.790]
Sydney Hall Jr. is a poet and publisher who lives in New Hampshire.

[02:21:59.150 --> 02:22:00.950]
And he writes a nation of cowards.

[02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:05.290]
For a brief moment after 9-11 we recognize some genuine heroes in our midst.

[02:22:05.490 --> 02:22:07.570]
Those who put their lives on the line to rescue strangers.

[02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:11.010]
And those who put their own needs in the back of needs of others in the middle of tragedy.

[02:22:11.690 --> 02:22:15.230]
The celebration of this heroism may have become a little gaudy but it was sincere.

[02:22:16.010 --> 02:22:19.530]
Since then we seem to have become a nation of cowards celebrating illusions.

[02:22:20.270 --> 02:22:27.610]
There was a precedent who in reaction to the devastation of 9-11 does not act with four barons curiosity to understand the root cause and as a world leader.

[02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:31.150]
Instead he lashes out at blurry targets with more force than we were met with.

[02:22:31.570 --> 02:22:32.930]
This is not the act of a brave man.

[02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:34.010]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:22:34.710 --> 02:22:37.990]
There is a senator who sees his country yawing dangerously off course.

[02:22:38.370 --> 02:22:41.690]
And for the first time in its history of using its power openly and shamelessly.

[02:22:41.690 --> 02:22:47.950]
The senator says nothing though he knows better because he's afraid of an emotional backlash if he engages in rational discussion.

[02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:49.870]
He's afraid he'll lose the next election.

[02:22:50.090 --> 02:22:51.010]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:22:51.770 --> 02:22:53.550]
There's a citizen who's unable to think.

[02:22:53.990 --> 02:23:01.770]
He succumbs to fear believes every scary story he hears buys duct tape for his doors and windows when a bit of thinking would tell him he's in more danger from getting into his car.

[02:23:02.210 --> 02:23:03.330]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:23:04.010 --> 02:23:10.890]
There is a journalist who knows there were young children dying in hospitals in Iraq where their body is horribly disfigured as the result of our country's doings.

[02:23:10.890 --> 02:23:15.470]
And he will not show pictures of these children so that people can weigh the consequences of war for themselves.

[02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:21.010]
He shows pictures of massively armed Americans and reports every coalition news release as gospel truth.

[02:23:21.350 --> 02:23:22.470]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:29.230]
There is an attorney general who's so scared by events that he's willing to subvert the very essence of what we would normally be fighting for.

[02:23:29.530 --> 02:23:32.010]
He wraps his subversive activities in a cloud of confusion.

[02:23:32.430 --> 02:23:33.470]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:23:34.370 --> 02:23:40.870]
There's a citizen who hangs a flag out on his house as a sign proclaiming that he cannot think that it's enough to support our troops whether what they want to do.

[02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:43.370]
What they're doing is right or wrong. This is the act of a coward.

[02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:50.030]
There's the soldier who fires into an oncoming vehicle carrying a family with women and children because he thinks they're coming after him.

[02:23:50.350 --> 02:23:51.390]
This is the act of a coward.

[02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:57.750]
There's another soldier who fires into a crowd of civilians when somebody throws a sandal at him.

[02:23:58.270 --> 02:24:01.570]
Sure is young scared of death by the situation he's been unfairly drawn into.

[02:24:01.890 --> 02:24:04.710]
But he doesn't wait for a real reason to fire. This is the act of a coward.

[02:24:05.290 --> 02:24:10.810]
Another soldier trains the barrel of his tank on a hotel full of journalists and fires. This is the act of a coward.

[02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:17.950]
A soldier stands by while hospitals and museums are looted and anarchy descends on a great city. This is the act of a coward.

[02:24:18.510 --> 02:24:23.370]
Many of these are scared kids put into an impossible place we should pity them, but that doesn't make them heroes.

[02:24:24.130 --> 02:24:31.430]
There's a reporter who for a forbearance to report how scared and unnerved these kids are for fear he might undermine his president. This is the act of a coward.

[02:24:32.090 --> 02:24:39.490]
A member of the U.S. Congress goes into his cafeteria and renames French fries, freedom fries, because he's unable to take any criticism from another country.

[02:24:39.830 --> 02:24:45.390]
Even the country that helped pave the way for American freedom in the first place is it's the act of a brave man. No, this is the act of a coward.

[02:24:46.310 --> 02:24:54.250]
A scholar who advises the White House concludes that force and fear are the only way to win the cycle of terrorism that perpetuates itself because of force and fear.

[02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:59.190]
He doesn't even think about finding the reasons for the problem or the solutions. This is the act of a coward.

[02:24:59.870 --> 02:25:06.570]
And the president comes forth smirking and swaggering, dressing in military garb and gloating. We've seen him from the worst of world leader.

[02:25:06.690 --> 02:25:14.350]
We've seen this from the worst of world leaders before, the stallions and hitlers, and though our president may not rise to the same level of evil, he resembles them uncomfortably.

[02:25:14.910 --> 02:25:19.910]
They are the leaders that did what they did and smirked and swaggered while they did it because they were essentially cowards too.

[02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:28.790]
We have it seems at last become a nation of cowards. Cowardists has woven itself right into the fabric of our lives. A nation of cowards except those who aren't and there are many.

[02:25:29.430 --> 02:25:34.130]
And the heart of every American there is a bravery waiting to emerge if someone would come along who'd call on that bravery.

[02:25:34.510 --> 02:25:41.290]
If another Martin Luther King came suddenly to our midst, you'd see bravery flower everywhere overnight. We are all of us after all just human.

[02:25:42.470 --> 02:25:43.150]
Sydney Hall, Jr.

[02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:47.310]
Pretty damn good stuff. It's hard to take.

[02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:52.270]
But it is absolutely correct sir.

[02:25:52.470 --> 02:25:57.330]
Okay, here's some facts. It's unlike some of your polls where I find it hard to narrow it down. This one's easy for me. The Great Escape.

[02:25:58.810 --> 02:26:04.350]
This movie was my favorite when I was six years old. Still enjoyed today a tremendous cast when their sighting story loosely based on fact.

[02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:09.970]
Whenever it's on the cable, which is often I'm sucked in the same issue with a godfather, I started watching the Great Escape many years earlier.

[02:26:09.970 --> 02:26:11.790]
Lot of years. Right.

[02:26:13.110 --> 02:26:21.090]
TR in Hollywood says how about the Matrix? Watched it a couple of dozen times. It's in the VCR in the spare room all the time turning on and watch forward, backward upside down whatever.

[02:26:21.090 --> 02:26:29.110]
I'm in there. Got it. Also TR said you'd notice they moved crossfire to 430 for only a half an hour because there was too much liberal talk. Right.

[02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:32.490]
And an obscure time when the latent drive time when nobody's watching.

[02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:38.010]
Yeah, no great loss though. You know. It's hard to see that bow tie.

[02:26:39.270 --> 02:26:42.470]
Kind of hard to choke a guy when you get pissed off at him if he's wearing a bow tie. You know.

[02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:50.590]
Or pick up the TV. Richard's alive. I'm guiding light. Just in case anybody came to watch in the last couple of days. Richard's alive.

[02:26:51.430 --> 02:26:52.990]
That's going to be a tough one to explain away.

[02:26:54.990 --> 02:26:59.550]
Reve went to jail for turning off the life support after got into a car wreck and he died months ago. Okay.

[02:26:59.550 --> 02:27:02.490]
Now all of a sudden only on the soap operas. He's alive. He's back.

[02:27:03.850 --> 02:27:09.230]
U H F by weird on the anchor. Somebody says features local girl Victoria Jackson. You got U H F got it down.

[02:27:10.050 --> 02:27:13.650]
It gets funnier each time I see it and I've seen it a lot much of time.

[02:27:13.690 --> 02:27:16.410]
Dr. D man. Side splitting fall off your seat funny.

[02:27:17.570 --> 02:27:23.550]
Here's another one from somebody trapped in Boko says I have a movie you might might not be familiar with, but you should watch it if you get a chance.

[02:27:23.550 --> 02:27:29.510]
This is spinal tap is probably one of the funny movies ever made. It's a documentary about a fictional 70s English group.

[02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:38.330]
What was the movie that the ruttles Zeptomani Python one? Yes. The ruttles Rob Reiner wrote directed and started.

[02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:43.710]
This is spinal tap a spoof about the music industry since you're in the entertainment visual appreciate themes of censorship.

[02:27:44.130 --> 02:27:50.210]
Soul and ego is like Moe and general chaos. I've seen this movie about a hundred and about 30 man times man.

[02:27:50.890 --> 02:27:55.890]
We enjoyed a hell out of your show list as much as we can for once for the bedtime stories. We wouldn't know what was going on out there.

[02:27:56.370 --> 02:28:03.210]
Also Georgian Weston says growing up in the late 60s early 70s the movie MASH would be up there also Mr. Poies today.

[02:28:03.370 --> 02:28:08.290]
But a movie I think you enjoyed might enjoy is Roman Polanski's the tenant very bizarre movie with a very bizarre ending.

[02:28:09.730 --> 02:28:15.090]
I says you in Georgia you didn't mention being a boy because probably the Roman Polanski's movie so being a boy in order for that.

[02:28:15.090 --> 02:28:28.150]
Yeah right. But yeah got MASH on the list would do now MASH it Godfather one what movie have you watched the most times in your life not as an adult not as a child in your lifetime since the day you were born broadcast TV.

[02:28:48.310 --> 02:28:52.650]
Now the reason I couldn't do that happy Gilmore thing I can't stand what's his name that punk fits in Adam Sand.

[02:28:52.650 --> 02:28:55.470]

I think my purpose is right.

[02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:42.710]
Hover and hussar is burning right through my role.

[02:29:45.130 --> 02:29:48.930]
Push push push push why we said fight every other.

[02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:57.410]
I don't know which way to go.

[02:29:58.930 --> 02:30:01.610]
The explosion burning swarper.

[02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:03.370]
Thanks the truck.

[02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:10.210]
Burmose.

[02:30:11.970 --> 02:30:15.010]
Just a bridge of what's a bird must.

[02:30:15.970 --> 02:30:16.890]
Burmose.

[02:30:25.890 --> 02:30:26.810]
Burmose.

Calling give me some answers to some questions that he's avoiding innovating they won't do it.

[02:30:40.810 --> 02:30:44.570]
They won't do it anymore than the even read letter to the editor in a and either one of our newspapers.

[02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:48.190]
Can you believe that nobody wrote letter about that Broward commission of resolution.

[02:30:48.410 --> 02:30:50.070]
I don't know about the Patriot act.

[02:30:50.290 --> 02:30:54.690]
I can't believe it. I think you people are suppressing the news at the sunset on the goddamn Miami hero.

[02:30:54.690 --> 02:30:57.630]
Okay, I think that's what you're doing trying to cover your tracks.

[02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:59.350]
Oh, that's not a story.

[02:30:59.730 --> 02:31:04.970]
Let's put it about 40,000 more words about Mr. Ego and about about Miriam elephant.

[02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:07.210]
Okay. That's all people care about.

[02:31:09.450 --> 02:31:09.890]
Jesus.

[02:31:10.230 --> 02:31:10.690]
K Christ.

[02:31:10.890 --> 02:31:11.610]
You know what I'm thinking?

[02:31:12.210 --> 02:31:12.310]
What?

[02:31:12.470 --> 02:31:14.190]
Nestle's turtle ice cream in a big bowl.

[02:31:15.530 --> 02:31:20.650]
Melted down in the microwave for a few seconds with scores bites and with cream on.

[02:31:20.650 --> 02:31:22.650]
They're not forget about and marshmallow on top.

[02:31:24.370 --> 02:31:25.690]
Drizzled with hot fudge.

[02:31:25.930 --> 02:31:27.810]
Oh, stop and cherries.

[02:31:28.150 --> 02:31:31.170]
Oh, and some of the cherry some of the cherry juice from the bottles.

[02:31:31.170 --> 02:31:32.350]
You know, drizzle around the edges.

[02:31:34.290 --> 02:31:37.150]
Oh, I think I'm my blood sugar just one up 80 points.

[02:31:37.390 --> 02:31:39.790]
Maybe not 80, but a lot.

[02:31:40.150 --> 02:31:40.910]
30 minutes.

[02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:44.950]
Oh, stop it.

[02:31:45.510 --> 02:31:46.870]
You ever had scores bites huh?

[02:31:47.170 --> 02:31:47.490]
Not yet.

[02:31:47.810 --> 02:31:50.510]
How about being one thing I was seeing being a woman and everybody like chocolate.

[02:31:51.390 --> 02:31:53.170]
Your taste is in your Tush man.

[02:31:53.230 --> 02:31:53.890]
That's what Muff said.

[02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:58.110]
That's what he told me.

[02:32:00.210 --> 02:32:01.850]
He said pretty tasty.

[02:32:03.250 --> 02:32:03.610]
Tush.

[02:32:04.570 --> 02:32:07.630]
What movie have you watched the most times in your life?

[02:32:07.790 --> 02:32:08.570]
That's our full question.

[02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:11.910]
We're spending half the time on a show trying to explain the question, which is good.

[02:32:11.930 --> 02:32:12.630]
It kills him good time.

[02:32:14.910 --> 02:32:18.790]
And then once we once they understand what the question is, then they say, oh, well, we'll get back to you.

[02:32:20.510 --> 02:32:26.330]
Godfather 169 star wars 43 was it about 32 airplane 22 and then you look from there.

[02:32:27.750 --> 02:32:32.330]
5 6 705 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and see if we rise from wireless line.

[02:32:33.250 --> 02:32:39.430]
I think what I'm going to do is if I'm if I can't have because I don't want to sit around here on a Friday night listening to a stim stupid show.

[02:32:39.670 --> 02:32:42.550]
I think I'll tape the jitter thing while he's on.

[02:32:43.550 --> 02:32:51.510]
I want to hear his lane answers his lane excuses for why he does such a piss poor job covering what's happening in the local media this time.

[02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:54.430]
Oh, I'm sure he'll address all those issues.

[02:32:54.470 --> 02:32:59.010]
Well, in other words, no, now one person's going to have the foot spot the balls to call in and put them on the spot about it.

[02:32:59.750 --> 02:33:00.670]
Oh, geez.

[02:33:01.850 --> 02:33:03.570]
Maybe didn't talk about the dog track.

[02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:05.530]
Here's my any hello.

[02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:07.470]
Okay, sir.

[02:33:08.090 --> 02:33:13.230]
Did anybody answer your Godfather question about and the Godfather one when did they say?

[02:33:14.090 --> 02:33:14.930]
Yes, he did.

[02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:18.130]
Bono said that was the beginning of the movie.

[02:33:18.410 --> 02:33:22.230]
I know you probably might not agree with it because I don't think you like it.

[02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:24.450]
Well, it's got nothing to do with it.

[02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:28.350]
I know, but it's one of the movie that I've seen probably the most in my life.

[02:33:28.530 --> 02:33:29.070]
It is the major.

[02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:31.530]
Okay, I think we got that on there.

[02:33:31.570 --> 02:33:32.730]
No, we just put it on there.

[02:33:33.030 --> 02:33:34.310]
We just we just stuck it on there.

[02:33:34.570 --> 02:33:34.910]
All right.

[02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:40.670]
I'll put you have a good day and you two see whether I agree with it or whether I like to or not is totally irrelevant.

[02:33:40.850 --> 02:33:42.270]
That's what makes this so easy.

[02:33:42.770 --> 02:33:44.190]
You're not going to have to convince us of anything.

[02:33:44.290 --> 02:33:47.730]
If that's the movie you've watched 50 million times, that's what we want to know about.

[02:33:47.730 --> 02:33:51.570]
That was a question of whether George agrees with you and I didn't have to get his seal of approval today.

[02:33:51.650 --> 02:33:55.810]
I'm like most other pulls when if he gives a look at your cross, I forget it.

[02:33:55.810 --> 02:33:57.930]
He gives like just the wrong sound like it.

[02:34:00.190 --> 02:34:01.130]
Come on, get on there.

[02:34:03.350 --> 02:34:04.530]
Come on, let's hear it.

[02:34:07.470 --> 02:34:12.250]
Oh, and those people that are waiting for the mad dog and that were you a drudge packing.

[02:34:12.390 --> 02:34:14.350]
Now do we have the one that he did that we couldn't use?

[02:34:14.350 --> 02:34:16.870]
We have the not yet heard new one.

[02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:18.370]
Were you drudge packing?

[02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:19.330]
Oh great.

[02:34:19.770 --> 02:34:21.610]
Well, what have we been holding back on that for?

[02:34:21.970 --> 02:34:22.510]
We were just told.

[02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:27.130]
You mean to say that my psychic powers kicked in again?

[02:34:27.350 --> 02:34:27.890]
You got it.

[02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:29.470]
I just loaded up right now.

[02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:32.670]
No, three minutes ago during the last break as a matter of fact.

[02:34:32.850 --> 02:34:33.830]
Are you shmitting me?

[02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:37.030]
I'm telling you seriously, I'm not using my psychic powers to the fullest.

[02:34:37.190 --> 02:34:40.170]
If I would really put my head to it, I could just say, hey, screw everybody.

[02:34:40.530 --> 02:34:41.710]
Hey, Greg, have a nice life.

[02:34:41.710 --> 02:34:45.450]
Go get a haircut and I could just put my go to the track or do something.

[02:34:45.670 --> 02:34:50.050]
See, my problem is when I go to the track, I allow myself to be influenced by certain other people.

[02:34:50.370 --> 02:34:50.690]
You know what I mean?

[02:34:50.830 --> 02:34:51.650]
I don't want to mention no names.

[02:34:51.730 --> 02:34:53.390]
Now, certain other people.

[02:34:53.690 --> 02:34:54.850]
Oh, the forearm's up great.

[02:34:55.990 --> 02:34:58.350]
It's all a crap about who warmed up like this, you know.

[02:34:59.370 --> 02:35:00.670]
You could be the gypsy queen.

[02:35:01.450 --> 02:35:02.850]
Yeah, or at least part of that.

[02:35:03.570 --> 02:35:04.990]
Were you drudge packing?

[02:35:07.530 --> 02:35:08.250]
It's great.

[02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:09.610]
Oh.

[02:35:10.110 --> 02:35:11.370]
That is sensational.

[02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:15.870]
I like the enthusiasm puts in it.

[02:35:16.030 --> 02:35:17.290]
In fact, wait a minute.

[02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:18.910]
Let's play these back to back.

[02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:22.650]
Let me play this one first because this one isn't quite as mighty.

[02:35:22.770 --> 02:35:25.030]
I mean, it's fine, but were you fudge packing?

[02:35:25.390 --> 02:35:26.650]
Were you drudge packing?

[02:35:27.150 --> 02:35:28.970]
Yeah, see that one has just a little bit more enthusiasm.

[02:35:29.690 --> 02:35:30.590]
That's called mad dog.

[02:35:30.590 --> 02:35:30.990]
Thank you.

[02:35:31.010 --> 02:35:31.990]
See, he's always there for us.

[02:35:31.990 --> 02:35:32.750]
He always obliges.

[02:35:32.930 --> 02:35:34.610]
He's got a sick twisted sense of humor.

[02:35:35.410 --> 02:35:36.590]
And then of course, there's the hump.

[02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:42.030]
I still want to get a fireport how the hump are bonded with Mo with the ratings party the other night.

[02:35:42.150 --> 02:35:44.090]
That must have been really, really something.

[02:35:45.390 --> 02:35:49.230]
Probably what started off on her on the right note was when Hank walked in and looked up at him and said,

[02:35:49.390 --> 02:35:50.150]
you asshole.

[02:35:50.430 --> 02:35:52.130]
They probably put on a good footing right off the bat.

[02:35:52.930 --> 02:35:54.490]
Those two don't get along to them.

[02:35:54.570 --> 02:35:58.670]
In fact, I think there's probably even a worse strain between those two than there is between me and Mo, you know.

[02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:59.130]
You think?

[02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:03.470]
Well, at least Mo agreed to let us do that keychain thing.

[02:36:03.470 --> 02:36:05.610]
The warrior somebody says, okay, you got that.

[02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:06.150]
The warriors.

[02:36:06.650 --> 02:36:08.850]
Now let me ask you, how come you're faxing me all of these?

[02:36:09.050 --> 02:36:09.390]
Why not?

[02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:11.470]
What couldn't you just read it?

[02:36:11.550 --> 02:36:13.390]
I could, but who the hell wants to hear me talk?

[02:36:14.270 --> 02:36:15.070]
That's a good point.

[02:36:15.170 --> 02:36:16.270]
Like I said, keep faxing him.

[02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:18.210]
Otherwise that one guy of quality.

[02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.710]
Wasn't that yesterday?

[02:36:21.150 --> 02:36:21.450]
That was yesterday.

[02:36:21.630 --> 02:36:22.890]
It was great. He was sucking Carlos's ass.

[02:36:23.170 --> 02:36:25.290]
Unfortunately, he agreed with everyone else.

[02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.870]
Five, six out.

[02:36:28.010 --> 02:36:28.470]
He was...

[02:36:29.470 --> 02:36:31.210]
That guy was on Carlos's ass too.

[02:36:31.890 --> 02:36:32.630]
That's a boy.

[02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:33.450]
Popular ass.

[02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:36.810]
Like that one bit we got, it's yours getting pretty crowded back then.

[02:36:38.970 --> 02:36:42.850]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:36:43.030 --> 02:36:44.530]
And Verizon, that's that Casey crazy bit.

[02:36:46.210 --> 02:36:47.530]
Here's a call from Poor Lauderdale.

[02:36:47.690 --> 02:36:47.810]
Hello.

[02:36:48.390 --> 02:36:48.930]
A cool meal.

[02:36:49.230 --> 02:36:49.790]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.870]
Hi, how you doing?

[02:36:51.250 --> 02:36:51.450]
Good.

[02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:54.230]
I've got one movie for your poll.

[02:36:54.730 --> 02:36:55.030]
This one.

[02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.170]
Okay.

[02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:57.710]
And I'm really surprised that nobody's mentioned this before.

[02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.290]
All right.

[02:36:58.290 --> 02:37:00.010]
The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

[02:37:00.270 --> 02:37:00.810]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:01.270 --> 02:37:03.470]
Something that was just on a...

[02:37:03.470 --> 02:37:04.810]
I mentioned I saw a few days ago.

[02:37:05.110 --> 02:37:07.930]
And there are people who have gone to that every Saturday night.

[02:37:08.170 --> 02:37:08.390]
Right.

[02:37:08.770 --> 02:37:11.650]
Like a church meeting for years.

[02:37:12.550 --> 02:37:16.230]
There are people in America who've watched the Rocky Horror Pictures show more times

[02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:17.350]
than they watched The Nightly News.

[02:37:17.770 --> 02:37:18.030]
Right.

[02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:22.530]
And if they're honest with you, I think that a lot of people love for that.

[02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.250]
Amen.

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:24.670]
So I wanted to have that to your poll.

[02:37:25.010 --> 02:37:25.350]
Thanks a lot.

[02:37:25.350 --> 02:37:25.830]
Have a great week.

[02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:27.850]
And I love the Dutch packing.

[02:37:28.490 --> 02:37:29.110]
That's great.

[02:37:29.390 --> 02:37:31.250]
I think it's...

[02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:32.610]
That's priceless.

[02:37:32.990 --> 02:37:33.290]
Thanks.

[02:37:33.450 --> 02:37:33.950]
Have a good weekend.

[02:37:34.350 --> 02:37:34.630]
You too.

[02:37:35.330 --> 02:37:36.370]
Now what's this movie?

[02:37:36.490 --> 02:37:36.970]
Nagasaki.

[02:37:39.330 --> 02:37:40.290]
Instructions were precise.

[02:37:41.050 --> 02:37:43.390]
To the north, Japan's greatest torpedo plant.

[02:37:43.930 --> 02:37:48.470]
To the south, steel, and arms were located in the heart of the city.

[02:37:49.230 --> 02:37:53.150]
The bomb was aimed midway between the two plants to cause greatest possible damage.

[02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:56.810]
Because the plants were located in a valley surrounded by...

[02:37:56.810 --> 02:37:58.390]
Yeah, but you're not getting that good stuff down here.

[02:37:58.470 --> 02:37:58.590]
No.

[02:37:58.670 --> 02:37:58.670]

[02:37:58.830 --> 02:38:00.370]
And that channel we see we for madness.

[02:38:03.350 --> 02:38:04.350]
And what's that other one?

[02:38:04.810 --> 02:38:05.870]
Oh, the F word.

[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:06.350]
I told you.

[02:38:07.910 --> 02:38:09.650]
Every now and then you see the video from that.

[02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:11.150]
And then see the original one.

[02:38:11.230 --> 02:38:12.050]
I mean, it's the God, the voice.

[02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:12.990]
Lots of work came from.

[02:38:13.130 --> 02:38:13.570]
How do you like that?

[02:38:14.090 --> 02:38:15.070]
You're not going to see it there.

[02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.410]
Sure.

[02:38:15.630 --> 02:38:17.270]
For a school for news is in pre-16.

[02:38:17.730 --> 02:38:18.350]
Oh, there's a...

[02:38:18.350 --> 02:38:18.750]
There's a...

[02:38:18.750 --> 02:38:21.350]
There's a...

[02:38:21.350 --> 02:38:22.570]
Oh, a nasty.

[02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:23.490]
Have you ever seen the other one?

[02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:24.350]
I don't want to go into it.

[02:38:25.330 --> 02:38:26.290]
And there's Robert Duval.

[02:38:26.450 --> 02:38:28.430]
Dr. Angus must have hit his grin.

[02:38:29.090 --> 02:38:30.330]
And so doing against...

[02:38:30.330 --> 02:38:33.170]
He sees the tango and gets hooked on it, which is a different animal to him.

[02:38:33.470 --> 02:38:34.530]
And he gets hooked on the tango.

[02:38:34.570 --> 02:38:37.270]
Yes, so it's a kind of a connection of the two cities that way.

[02:38:38.370 --> 02:38:39.370]
You know who you are?

[02:38:39.530 --> 02:38:40.150]
You're my brother, right?

[02:38:40.990 --> 02:38:41.430]
You're my brother.

[02:38:41.430 --> 02:38:41.590]
You're my brother.

[02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:42.190]
I'll be honest.

[02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:49.710]
Everybody wants to say anything about it.

[02:38:49.710 --> 02:38:51.470]
We look to you.

[02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:56.850]
This will go from here, us, to that, to the big screen, complete screen, but credits.

[02:38:57.330 --> 02:38:58.570]
But what are we talking about?

[02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:59.790]
Let's go to one.

[02:39:00.210 --> 02:39:00.730]
I ain't like that.

[02:39:00.850 --> 02:39:03.850]
Robert Duval, one of the great ones, the unsung hero is of our lifetime.

[02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:05.770]
Just love Robert Duval.

[02:39:05.810 --> 02:39:06.930]
But the guy was right about the facts.

[02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.670]
He should have...

[02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:09.330]
You know, that would have money, okay?

[02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:10.890]
Right.

[02:39:11.010 --> 02:39:11.390]
Don't you think?

[02:39:11.770 --> 02:39:12.130]
Absolutely.

[02:39:12.650 --> 02:39:14.490]
He should have been Godfather II and III.

[02:39:14.750 --> 02:39:16.350]
Why does everyone have to be a freaking mercenary?

[02:39:16.790 --> 02:39:17.030]
Right.

[02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:18.290]
Like I said, screw him.

[02:39:18.350 --> 02:39:18.550]
Okay.

[02:39:18.610 --> 02:39:19.770]
Good actor, but screw him.

[02:39:20.130 --> 02:39:21.490]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:22.190]
Here's Bokeh.

[02:39:22.270 --> 02:39:22.390]
Hello.

[02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.470]
Neil?

[02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:25.290]
Yes, sir.

[02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:26.490]
Good afternoon.

[02:39:27.070 --> 02:39:27.770]
And Boen is here.

[02:39:28.010 --> 02:39:36.810]
My favorite movie, the movie I've watched the most, and the movie with the best ending is once upon a time in America, a long version.

[02:39:37.170 --> 02:39:37.370]
Right.

[02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:46.370]
And the reason why I'm so intrigued by that is because at the end, after Max jumps into the dumb truck, it flashes back to noodles.

[02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:47.630]
And the opium then.

[02:39:48.130 --> 02:39:48.910]
And he's smiling.

[02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:52.790]
And the question is, is he smiling because he has all the money?

[02:39:53.050 --> 02:39:56.170]
Or is he smiling because he knows that Max is still alive?

[02:39:56.770 --> 02:39:59.190]
I think he's smiling because the Kishka just thought I thought out.

[02:40:02.110 --> 02:40:02.850]
No, you're right.

[02:40:02.990 --> 02:40:03.410]
It's a good point.

[02:40:03.490 --> 02:40:03.950]
Because of what?

[02:40:04.910 --> 02:40:05.650]
Oh, cool.

[02:40:06.350 --> 02:40:07.950]
Yeah, somebody's Kishka's just spilled out.

[02:40:08.190 --> 02:40:08.810]
Yeah, I thought that...

[02:40:08.810 --> 02:40:11.270]
You could see the Zitz flying from James Woods' face in that scene.

[02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:12.750]
Right on the garbage truck?

[02:40:14.010 --> 02:40:17.010]
Yeah, but when they flashed in the long version, they flashed back.

[02:40:17.570 --> 02:40:18.930]
Yeah, no, I understand what you're saying.

[02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:19.950]
Just joking, yeah.

[02:40:20.390 --> 02:40:23.510]
Yeah, if you recall, if you they flashed back to him, they were killed.

[02:40:23.690 --> 02:40:25.950]
After he saw the bodies, they had to, they were in the flame.

[02:40:26.530 --> 02:40:26.670]
Right.

[02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:29.810]
And he goes to the opium then and then he's smiling.

[02:40:30.190 --> 02:40:30.990]
And he's making happy.

[02:40:31.690 --> 02:40:31.930]
Yeah.

[02:40:32.090 --> 02:40:35.510]
But the question is, did he know that Max was alive?

[02:40:36.010 --> 02:40:36.210]
Right.

[02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:37.530]
Good question.

[02:40:37.810 --> 02:40:38.290]
What is that?

[02:40:38.970 --> 02:40:39.890]
We'll never know the answer.

[02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:41.470]
That's why I keep watching it.

[02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:43.630]
I just see if we can figure it out.

[02:40:44.010 --> 02:40:44.250]
Okay, pal.

[02:40:44.310 --> 02:40:44.830]
Have a great day.

[02:40:45.130 --> 02:40:46.090]
Thank you.

[02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:47.350]
What's upon a time in America?

[02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:48.130]
Let me say it again.

[02:40:48.230 --> 02:40:49.430]
A really very good movie.

[02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:51.870]
Great cast.

[02:40:52.450 --> 02:40:53.070]
Robert De Niro.

[02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:54.250]
James Woods.

[02:40:56.110 --> 02:40:57.350]
You want to punch in toughest?

[02:40:59.770 --> 02:41:00.290]
Remember that?

[02:41:00.470 --> 02:41:00.590]
Yeah.

[02:41:01.090 --> 02:41:02.390]
Although I think he said, took us.

[02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:04.930]
You could tell us the boy he's trying to play a Julian on.

[02:41:05.070 --> 02:41:06.110]
Jews don't say took us.

[02:41:06.250 --> 02:41:06.810]
Who said that?

[02:41:07.450 --> 02:41:10.370]
He said it took us five years to make this freaking movie or something like that.

[02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:11.410]
James Woods said that.

[02:41:11.550 --> 02:41:12.170]
Oh, he said too.

[02:41:12.810 --> 02:41:13.670]
James Woods is Jewish?

[02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:14.450]
Oh, God.

[02:41:14.690 --> 02:41:16.330]
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

[02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:18.750]
You know, who else he played?

[02:41:18.830 --> 02:41:19.990]
He played the right coin.

[02:41:20.410 --> 02:41:22.470]
Speaking of where you are, a drug packet.

[02:41:23.770 --> 02:41:25.330]
1213 and I see great similarities.

[02:41:25.330 --> 02:41:26.210]
There were only right coin.

[02:41:26.210 --> 02:41:27.010]
At least it was an attorney.

[02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:29.250]
1213 at 560 WDQM.

[02:41:29.430 --> 02:41:32.310]
Hey, Richard Mellon's scape is, uh, where the hell did I have that?

[02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:34.810]
I've got some really great story about Richard Mellon's scape.

[02:41:34.810 --> 02:41:35.390]
A great website.

[02:41:35.730 --> 02:41:36.910]
Maybe we'll do that over the weekend.

[02:41:37.450 --> 02:41:38.410]
Send it along to Beenerboy.

[02:41:39.550 --> 02:41:43.250]
We'll put that on there so people really get the history behind the story of who's pulling the strings

[02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:45.830]
and pumping all the money and all this right wing crap that's going on.

[02:41:46.050 --> 02:41:47.910]
All this propaganda machine that's going on.

[02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:49.770]
Richard Mellon's scape.

[02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:51.570]

You way, you way.

[02:43:05.570 --> 02:43:09.250]
I wouldn't believe a word Neil said if his tongue was notarized.

[02:43:16.630 --> 02:43:28.470]
We'll meet again if we don't wind up dead from the bush cartel that left us all this way.

[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:34.390]
We'll meet again.

[02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:12.470]
We'll meet again with a whole that by then civil rights will be restored one sunny day.

[02:44:13.450 --> 02:44:15.370]

[02:46:11.370 --> 02:46:13.270]
I think it was George Dunnett, didn't he?

[02:46:13.430 --> 02:46:19.810]
Right. 5.670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:46:20.730 --> 02:46:27.790]
I mean this is a very scientific thing. When we get that one this pull on Monday we want to make damn sure that it's right on the money.

[02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:30.690]
Here's a call from Daniel. Hello.

[02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.830]
Hi, how are you?

[02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:32.450]
Great.

[02:46:32.890 --> 02:46:36.190]
I have a list of a bunch of them but I'm going to have to go with Pope Diction.

[02:46:36.930 --> 02:46:37.250]
Okay.

[02:46:38.370 --> 02:46:39.350]
You don't like full fiction?

[02:46:40.670 --> 02:46:42.590]
I don't have to like it for it to be on the list.

[02:46:42.830 --> 02:46:43.830]
Okay. Can it be on the list?

[02:46:44.570 --> 02:46:46.290]
It's on the list right now because you said it.

[02:46:46.410 --> 02:46:48.350]
Okay. Wonderful. Thanks. Have a great day.

[02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:53.910]
You too. See she's upset because I didn't like it. See it just because I mean you might not like scores bites.

[02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:56.230]
Carlos don't like it. He don't like chocolate.

[02:46:58.550 --> 02:46:59.850]
That means more for me.

[02:47:01.290 --> 02:47:06.070]
I see I don't understand that. I know that everybody's got different tastes but I get for the life of me.

[02:47:06.430 --> 02:47:10.490]
How can anybody not like chocolate? That's the first I've never met anyone.

[02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:12.090]
Have you ever heard of anything like that?

[02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:17.630]
Nope. I just can't even envision it. I can't imagine. I only wish that it was me.

[02:47:18.070 --> 02:47:25.450]
I thought that was a universal tie that I wish I didn't like anything sweet and I didn't like pasta or any kind of a tad in food like pizza.

[02:47:25.450 --> 02:47:28.210]
If I didn't like any of that stuff, you know how many pounds that weigh?

[02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:30.290]
About third man.

[02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:34.410]
Pops soaking wet. See how more evolved.

[02:47:35.190 --> 02:47:38.190]
You're what? I'm more evolved. I'm the next step in the human evolution.

[02:47:39.270 --> 02:47:40.630]
He's a mutant is what he's trying to say.

[02:47:40.730 --> 02:47:44.450]
A mutant illegal alien which is a special category.

[02:47:46.450 --> 02:47:51.230]
56670560, pound 560 on a AT&T and say you're going to have a webfoot dry foot policy for them.

[02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:54.390]
Yeah. No. In his case, it's the wet back dry back policy.

[02:47:55.450 --> 02:47:58.590]
Or when when duck gets older, it's the old bear back policy.

[02:47:59.190 --> 02:48:03.770]
We just got a call from a friend of yours that uh that agrees with me that he doesn't like chocolate either.

[02:48:05.230 --> 02:48:05.470]
Moses.

[02:48:08.250 --> 02:48:08.650]
Yeah.

[02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:10.950]
So there's two of us mutants.

[02:48:11.210 --> 02:48:12.990]
Yeah, but there's one big difference. He looks good.

[02:48:14.570 --> 02:48:16.810]
He can afford to like whatever he wants. Okay.

[02:48:16.810 --> 02:48:20.170]
In your case, your options are very limited.

[02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:22.030]
Here's Bokeh. Hello.

[02:48:22.390 --> 02:48:29.070]
Yeah, I need a lot of sound now, but um I got a movie, but I'd like to comment on that uh editorial.

[02:48:29.070 --> 02:48:31.130]
A sound editorial. You read it a while.

[02:48:32.290 --> 02:48:33.450]
Which one is that?

[02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:40.890]
Yeah, you're breaking up a little bit. Which one?

[02:48:40.890 --> 02:48:42.610]
Um, that is an edit.

[02:48:42.890 --> 02:48:43.530]
Early read.

[02:48:46.050 --> 02:48:50.930]
Uh, I can't hear a damn thing. You're saying call me back or I'll come back to town.

[02:48:50.930 --> 02:48:53.310]
Okay. He's on this way to hope son. Could you understand what you say?

[02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:55.350]
The uh coward article is what he was talking about.

[02:48:55.470 --> 02:48:56.550]
Yeah, but I couldn't hear what he was saying.

[02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.970]
Could you? No.

[02:49:01.490 --> 02:49:03.910]
Oh, 560708. Now somebody's going to say, see he'd wanted to disagree.

[02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:05.450]
I don't know whether he agreed or disagreed.

[02:49:05.490 --> 02:49:07.790]
I don't know what he wanted to say, but I couldn't uh can't leave it on here.

[02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:09.030]
Get a real phone palette.

[02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:11.270]
It when it works like more than 10 miles about.

[02:49:12.670 --> 02:49:14.710]
Here's a North, North Miami. Hello.

[02:49:15.470 --> 02:49:16.810]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[02:49:17.350 --> 02:49:21.870]
Yeah, I got a my favorite movie of all time. I've seen it about 30 times.

[02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:22.410]
Yeah.

[02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:26.570]
All right. All Newman, George Kennedy and Strabber Martin and cool hand Luke.

[02:49:27.330 --> 02:49:28.510]
Cool hand Luke was great.

[02:49:29.250 --> 02:49:30.210]
That's a great movie.

[02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:32.710]
Okay, you got. All right. Thanks.

[02:49:33.070 --> 02:49:34.790]
Yeah, cool hand looks on the list.

[02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:37.670]
Do we have a Rocky or a picture show on her yet?

[02:49:38.750 --> 02:49:39.830]
I don't see it.

[02:49:41.530 --> 02:49:46.090]
I know it's in the middle of one of Eric's lunches right now, but I don't see it. Do you?

[02:49:46.090 --> 02:49:48.690]
No. Did you pass it long, beater?

[02:49:49.250 --> 02:49:50.510]
Yes, sir. That one and a whole bunch of others.

[02:49:51.390 --> 02:49:55.010]
You know that brother also, my mentioned him the Blue Brothers still has an apostrophe on it.

[02:49:55.070 --> 02:49:59.730]
We don't want to leave it like that all weekend long because people will start making all kinds of cracks about you and Eric all weekend.

[02:50:00.430 --> 02:50:01.610]
For days and months to come.

[02:50:01.930 --> 02:50:04.690]
Let's get the apostrophe out of the Blue Brothers.

[02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:08.690]
How do you put an apostrophe in the Blues Brothers Carlos?

[02:50:11.070 --> 02:50:11.590]
My bet.

[02:50:12.510 --> 02:50:14.670]
How do you do such an idiotic illiterate thing?

[02:50:14.890 --> 02:50:17.130]
Probably too busy looking and pictures of Aaron to get it right.

[02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:21.730]
See how many months has he been working on this show and it's already staring to rub off?

[02:50:22.850 --> 02:50:25.890]
It's either that or it's because he's Cuban. I think probably the latter.

[02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:33.030]
5 6 7 0 5 60. Well, see at least he can say here's a good looking guy without getting all uptight about it and all concerned.

[02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:38.090]
Although we did put in gigantic letters about his heterosexuality, humongous letters.

[02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:41.990]
And you know something I think in your case is probably a good thing.

[02:50:43.150 --> 02:50:44.430]
Here's Al Portell. Hello.

[02:50:44.550 --> 02:50:45.150]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:50:45.310 --> 02:50:46.050]
Pretty good, sir.

[02:50:46.350 --> 02:50:50.830]
A movie like the lady said the Rocky Horror Woodstock was the one I've seen the most because of the movie.

[02:50:50.830 --> 02:50:51.150]
Oh, really?

[02:50:51.370 --> 02:50:54.490]
Midnight movies for a buck and back then there was no music video.

[02:50:54.670 --> 02:50:56.450]
So you could see people performing in it.

[02:50:56.750 --> 02:50:58.450]
I've seen it probably about 150 times.

[02:50:58.890 --> 02:51:00.370]
And had to be stolen every time you watched it.

[02:51:00.970 --> 02:51:01.370]
I'm sure.

[02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:02.050]
Right.

[02:51:03.150 --> 02:51:09.130]
This week since you were talking about movies, you brought something to my mind because you always talk about network, life and matating art.

[02:51:09.630 --> 02:51:12.530]
There's another movie like that being there.

[02:51:13.050 --> 02:51:17.190]
If that's not frigging chancey garden in the White House, I'll kiss your pimple fat ass.

[02:51:18.030 --> 02:51:18.430]
Okay.

[02:51:18.630 --> 02:51:19.790]
Later, Neil. Thank you.

[02:51:20.210 --> 02:51:22.690]
I don't have a pimple ass fat. Yes, not pimple.

[02:51:22.810 --> 02:51:24.210]
Not yet. All the way to minute.

[02:51:24.210 --> 02:51:28.330]
Oh, five six seven oh five 60 is called like a pimple.

[02:51:28.730 --> 02:51:30.210]
Pound five 60 on a game.

[02:51:30.330 --> 02:51:34.410]
Maybe it was a, uh, a squirt's bit on a way out.

[02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:37.230]
Hmm. God.

[02:51:37.610 --> 02:51:42.090]
Why do I do that? I apologize for doing that because now a whole bunch of people and then they'll blame me.

[02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:44.350]
Right. Remember when I was talking about smarties?

[02:51:44.630 --> 02:51:44.930]
Mm-hmm.

[02:51:45.350 --> 02:51:48.630]
Smarties are okay. They're like sweeter M&Ms. They're better in M&Ms.

[02:51:48.810 --> 02:51:53.810]
But, uh, these things make, make smarties and M&Ms taste like dog crap. Okay?

[02:51:56.010 --> 02:51:56.410]
Wow.

[02:51:56.930 --> 02:52:00.710]
No, I wouldn't know firsthand, you know, but for those people who have had dog crap.

[02:52:01.350 --> 02:52:05.630]
Five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60 on a AT&T and Verizon line.

[02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:06.970]
Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello.

[02:52:07.670 --> 02:52:09.270]
Neil, what's going on? Yes, sir.

[02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:12.330]
Move you have seen 20,000 times.

[02:52:12.550 --> 02:52:13.930]
Will he walk in the chocolate factory?

[02:52:14.850 --> 02:52:16.570]
Will he walk his chocolate factory?

[02:52:16.770 --> 02:52:18.170]
Don't say that with the Carlos. Listen.

[02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.950]
Are you serious?

[02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:23.010]
One for you with your lover boy, Johnny Depp.

[02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:25.010]
Nightmare on M Street.

[02:52:25.490 --> 02:52:26.450]
Oh yeah, I love that.

[02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:28.310]
I love it. Okay, thanks.

[02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:30.470]
Yeah, Johnny Depp hits the ceiling. Squirt Squirt.

[02:52:30.510 --> 02:52:31.830]
That movie would blood, unfortunately.

[02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:33.670]
You saw it, right? Sure.

[02:52:34.270 --> 02:52:35.450]
Nightmare on M Street, part one.

[02:52:35.570 --> 02:52:36.230]
It was okay.

[02:52:37.390 --> 02:52:38.850]
I don't think I'd ever watch it again.

[02:52:41.250 --> 02:52:43.010]
Especially now, I haven't seen Donnie Brasco.

[02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:44.890]
I got my Johnny Depp fixed from Donnie Brasco.

[02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:45.870]
That was a really good movie.

[02:52:46.010 --> 02:52:48.090]
Even though we had like almost no calls about it, that's okay.

[02:52:49.710 --> 02:52:51.110]
Nobody went out and saw happening.

[02:52:51.110 --> 02:52:53.290]
You get a call or a fax about that.

[02:52:53.490 --> 02:52:55.190]
Although they must be on a verge of watching it

[02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:56.710]
because all the copies have been gobbled up.

[02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:58.430]
He says they're talking about it.

[02:52:58.750 --> 02:53:00.570]
Here's one that says there are a lot of movies I've seen.

[02:53:00.690 --> 02:53:02.910]
A lot of times, but the one that I've seen even more than

[02:53:02.910 --> 02:53:04.830]
a godfather is, Casablanca.

[02:53:07.030 --> 02:53:08.730]
You must remember this.

[02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:10.550]
Let's hear a duff singing it, huh?

[02:53:12.190 --> 02:53:13.790]
People see us everywhere.

[02:53:14.230 --> 02:53:15.350]
Ah, play it.

[02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:18.050]
They think you really care.

[02:53:18.050 --> 02:53:18.110]
Yeah.

[02:53:19.450 --> 02:53:21.970]
But myself I can't to see.

[02:53:22.270 --> 02:53:23.770]
Duff, get off this incident.

[02:53:24.030 --> 02:53:26.750]
I know it's only make believe.

[02:53:28.990 --> 02:53:29.850]
Poor Duff.

[02:53:31.210 --> 02:53:33.410]
Poor neurotic, unappreciated Duff.

[02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:35.850]
I want an only prayer.

[02:53:36.410 --> 02:53:36.630]
Oh!

[02:53:38.450 --> 02:53:42.150]
I hope my dreams come true.

[02:53:42.530 --> 02:53:42.870]
Roll!

[02:53:44.690 --> 02:53:45.570]
Oh!

[02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:47.530]
No, I will never know.

[02:53:48.230 --> 02:53:48.550]
No.

[02:53:48.790 --> 02:53:50.450]
How much I love you so.

[02:53:51.370 --> 02:53:52.170]
Okay, that's enough.

[02:53:56.210 --> 02:53:57.010]
Poor Duff.

[02:53:57.230 --> 02:54:01.310]
Poor unappreciated Duff who is so desperately looking to fight his real nitch in life.

[02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:02.990]
He's just doling around right now.

[02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.730]
Can you see I haven't noticed?

[02:54:06.090 --> 02:54:06.570]
Yeah, I love it.

[02:54:06.570 --> 02:54:08.030]
Did we put Casablanca on there?

[02:54:08.250 --> 02:54:09.610]
We did not. You must remember.

[02:54:09.870 --> 02:54:10.970]
Also, I never heard whether you say,

[02:54:10.970 --> 02:54:12.790]
I prefer Godfather 1 over Godfather 2.

[02:54:12.890 --> 02:54:13.390]
I like to combine.

[02:54:13.690 --> 02:54:16.070]
Yes, I do like to combine the trilogy as a matter of fact.

[02:54:16.330 --> 02:54:19.030]
But Godfather 1 is far. I don't care what anybody says.

[02:54:19.490 --> 02:54:23.510]
Godfather 1 is far superior to Godfather 2 except the course for the Myrlansky

[02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:24.570]
business, the Hymen Roth part.

[02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:25.110]
That was good.

[02:54:25.770 --> 02:54:27.470]
The Hot Pills here are empty.

[02:54:28.070 --> 02:54:31.030]
I mean, now things are coming back.

[02:54:31.210 --> 02:54:32.190]
That's a good news for Toronto.

[02:54:32.410 --> 02:54:33.290]
It's coming back, baby.

[02:54:33.730 --> 02:54:35.310]
We're SARS-free pretty much.

[02:54:35.850 --> 02:54:37.710]
A couple of people in the hospital don't want to give it up.

[02:54:37.710 --> 02:54:38.770]
But other than that, we're okay.

[02:54:39.330 --> 02:54:41.490]
And Mike Myers will be on the Earth sticking in your face on Leno.

[02:54:42.630 --> 02:54:43.930]
28 past noon at 5.

[02:54:43.970 --> 02:54:44.530]
60 W.

[02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:46.970]
You know, Steve Wolf must have bailed out of town too.

[02:54:47.090 --> 02:54:48.850]
And Dick Feinberg and Troy Stratford.

[02:54:48.930 --> 02:54:50.070]
They're all out of town together probably.

[02:54:50.690 --> 02:54:52.850]
Maybe they're worth a qualifying race at Mohawk this morning.

[02:54:53.230 --> 02:54:55.790]
Because they still haven't fixed me any new Pompa-Dopark copy.

[02:54:55.970 --> 02:54:56.850]
So I'll just make some up.

[02:54:57.890 --> 02:54:59.850]
Don't forget, we got a live racing at Pompa-Dopark.

[02:55:00.130 --> 02:55:02.170]
Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, three nights a week, seven,

[02:55:02.310 --> 02:55:03.010]
fifteen, and fifteen tonight.

[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:04.690]
General parking is free. Admission is free.

[02:55:04.690 --> 02:55:06.710]
Every Wednesday at Pompa-Dopark is dollar-night.

[02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:09.010]
Dollar draft beers, hot dogs, sodas, and lots more.

[02:55:09.630 --> 02:55:12.630]
And we can actually come out any day of the week, seven days starting at noon for a

[02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:16.670]
Simal Casting from tracks all over North America through a bread harness and highlight as well.

[02:55:17.250 --> 02:55:18.610]
And don't forget, we got the Freakness.

[02:55:18.650 --> 02:55:21.370]
I mean, the Freakness coming up from Pimpleco next Saturday, May 17.

[02:55:21.970 --> 02:55:24.930]
And Pompa-Dopark will be featuring Simal Casting of the Freakness as we do every year.

[02:55:25.250 --> 02:55:26.370]
Early bird weightiering is starting.

[02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:28.390]
I'm just saying this, I don't know.

[02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:30.670]
But I'm assuming, based on what we did for the Derby.

[02:55:31.210 --> 02:55:33.930]
Friday, May 16th at 1 p.m. next Friday.

[02:55:33.930 --> 02:55:36.530]
Watched Wage Re-Enjointed Crowds on Saturday, May 17.

[02:55:37.010 --> 02:55:39.930]
For the Freakness from Pimpleco in Baltimore at Pompa-Dopark.

[02:55:40.050 --> 02:55:42.690]
Pompa-Dopark, I'm a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[02:55:42.930 --> 02:55:46.690]
Don't forget, great live racing, 7.15 tonight every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

[02:55:46.850 --> 02:55:50.970]
My and Low. This is 4.2560.

[02:55:51.490 --> 02:55:53.330]
You weigh 2 a.m.

[02:55:55.070 --> 02:55:56.770]
The Canada you do, bastard.

[02:56:03.930 --> 02:56:04.950]
And it's in.

[02:56:09.570 --> 02:56:12.350]
Well, everything's as I most has been burned in the shine.

[02:56:12.730 --> 02:56:15.610]
This is right all in palaces and blue on this yacht.

[02:56:16.250 --> 02:56:19.150]
No more idle Lord, these are not shit for the fools.

[02:56:19.470 --> 02:56:21.930]
They'll be no more who's safe and ladies to stay crows.

[02:56:22.850 --> 02:56:26.910]
Good day. Call your brother, could you stay?

[02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:30.090]
Tell him that there's no way.

[02:56:32.250 --> 02:56:35.750]
No way they'll be going on a spanked cruise.

[02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:39.530]
Six-two-guided men is the jiffy star.

[02:56:39.650 --> 02:56:42.510]
Hey! What are you doing to my yacht?

[02:56:42.790 --> 02:56:46.270]
All the crew could do was watch the birds.

[02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:48.670]
Hey! Watch out, smart car, go away.

[02:56:48.990 --> 02:56:51.810]
People we built on Van Dyade was told to be safe.

[02:56:52.310 --> 02:56:54.650]
Now it looks even worse than the Titanic.

[02:56:55.730 --> 02:56:58.090]
One new engine, decay their research news.

[02:56:58.130 --> 02:57:01.890]
There'll be no more who's safe and ladies to stay crows.

[02:57:02.250 --> 02:57:06.330]
Good day. Call your brother, could you stay?

[02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:09.690]
Tell him that there's no way.

[02:57:10.530 --> 02:57:15.030]
Oh my God, no way they'll be going on a spanked cruise.

[02:57:15.330 --> 02:57:19.050]
Six-two-guided men still sitting in the smile.

[02:57:20.190 --> 02:57:21.650]
I thought they hit that star.

[02:57:22.290 --> 02:57:25.670]
One new highway, staying with the spanked man.

[02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:28.130]
I can't get out.

[02:57:29.090 --> 02:57:31.250]
Everything's in double, says we've burned up a shot.

[02:57:31.690 --> 02:57:34.950]
This trend all is bad, this isn't blue, I'm just yachts.

[02:57:35.130 --> 02:57:38.010]
No more wilder, these are the shippled fools.

[02:57:38.490 --> 02:57:41.330]
They'll be no more who's safe and ladies to stay crows.

[02:57:41.750 --> 02:57:45.810]
Good day. Call your brother, could you stay?

[02:57:45.930 --> 02:57:48.950]
Tell him that there's no way.

[02:57:50.050 --> 02:57:51.330]
Tell him that there's no way.

[02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:54.230]
No way they'll be going on a spanked cruise.

[02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:55.070]
Oh, listen to him.

[02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:57.330]
Drop in the proverbial bucket.

[02:57:58.070 --> 02:58:00.230]
We're gonna live it up, we're gonna wail, dog.

[02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:04.130]
No, this money goes for buying plans without the city manager.

[02:58:04.590 --> 02:58:07.090]
The rent? You know, for a run.

[02:58:07.630 --> 02:58:08.510]
Which way is sweetheart?

[02:58:09.130 --> 02:58:14.030]
Drive straight out along short island sun to the old criminals home.

[02:58:14.490 --> 02:58:17.230]
Oh, I love to see Commissioner Gordon space now.

[02:58:19.750 --> 02:58:20.310]
Incredible.

[02:58:20.310 --> 02:58:21.810]
Yeah, absolutely.

[02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:23.630]
That's what Commissioner Gordon said.

[02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:27.150]
Well, I'm sure glad they put this on at this time now.

[02:58:27.350 --> 02:58:29.470]
Batman's usually on in the afternoon back to back episodes.

[02:58:31.370 --> 02:58:33.790]
1234, here's a horrendous story, and I'm not gonna believe this.

[02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:38.090]
129 sucked out of the rear door of an airplane over the Congo.

[02:58:41.570 --> 02:58:43.370]
Do you hear such a thing? Yeah, just now.

[02:58:44.150 --> 02:58:48.210]
The rear door of a Russian-built cargo plane burst open as the aircraft carried police officials

[02:58:48.210 --> 02:58:52.510]
and their relatives across Congo and 129 passengers were sucked out.

[02:58:53.230 --> 02:58:54.030]
That sucks.

[02:58:54.630 --> 02:58:59.230]
The defense minister, Oroheng Awan, confirmed there was a technical problem with a plane's rear door.

[02:58:59.410 --> 02:58:59.630]
You think?

[02:58:59.730 --> 02:59:02.910]
Provided no details did not confirm any deaths among the 200 people on board.

[02:59:03.230 --> 02:59:04.090]
This is what I don't understand.

[02:59:04.950 --> 02:59:07.630]
After the accident occurred some 45 minutes into the flight,

[02:59:08.490 --> 02:59:11.450]
the pilot managed to turn back and land a plane in Kinshasha,

[02:59:11.810 --> 02:59:15.610]
Awan said, the plane with its rear dormant and could be seen on the airport tarmac.

[02:59:17.450 --> 02:59:21.890]
Two officials at the OIC, two officials in the International Airport in Congo's capital, Kinshasha,

[02:59:22.330 --> 02:59:25.910]
independently told the Associated Press that 129 people were fear of dead.

[02:59:26.890 --> 02:59:29.610]
Nine survivors were being treated for minor injuries and psychological trauma.

[02:59:30.610 --> 02:59:33.810]
How is it possible that nine people could survive getting sucked out of a plane?

[02:59:34.210 --> 02:59:37.270]
I mean, if it's 45 minutes into the flight, those are the ones that weren't sucked out.

[02:59:40.810 --> 02:59:41.610]
Are you sure?

[02:59:42.490 --> 02:59:42.950]
I'm pretty sure.

[02:59:44.790 --> 02:59:45.590]
Are you sure?

[02:59:46.170 --> 02:59:50.250]
It says 129 passengers were sucked out and 129 people were fear of dead.

[02:59:50.530 --> 02:59:52.870]
So we have to assume that nine survivors are the ones that weren't sucked out.

[02:59:52.990 --> 02:59:53.950]
And that what you just said?

[02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:54.990]
That's what you're saying.

[02:59:55.430 --> 02:59:56.190]
Well, I don't know.

[02:59:56.270 --> 02:59:58.850]
It just came across the wire to just sout it and grow test.

[02:59:59.230 --> 03:00:02.350]
And when I first looked at it, it looked like the headlines said, over Chicago,

[03:00:02.650 --> 03:00:06.390]
when it says Congo, and I thought, holy crap.

[03:00:08.470 --> 03:00:12.070]
Greg and Sunrise is my single most watched movie is Raiders of the Lost Ark.

[03:00:12.070 --> 03:00:14.810]
Not necessarily my favorite, but I've seen it about 30 times.

[03:00:16.030 --> 03:00:20.370]
Also, I missed your favorite saying's pull, you know, that ain't my favorite is why don't you go back to Canada, you Jew bastard.

[03:00:20.690 --> 03:00:22.510]
I go to Hollywood quite a bit, so is it pretty often?

[03:00:22.990 --> 03:00:24.350]
He goes to Georgia's neck of the woods.

[03:00:25.590 --> 03:00:28.510]
In fact, if Greg from Sunrise ever sees Georgia, probably say,

[03:00:28.530 --> 03:00:31.010]
Why don't you go back to Canada, you Jew bastard?

[03:00:31.770 --> 03:00:34.210]
And we didn't even know George was Jewish, like Dave Johnson.

[03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:35.530]
I'm taking classes now.

[03:00:36.150 --> 03:00:38.890]
Break down Kurt Russell and Liar Liar, Jim Kiri.

[03:00:38.890 --> 03:00:41.530]
Here's somebody sneak two on of this. I wish we wouldn't want to put on either one.

[03:00:42.630 --> 03:00:42.990]
Whatever.

[03:00:44.030 --> 03:00:45.510]
Well, we can't put them both on.

[03:00:45.810 --> 03:00:46.230]
The first one.

[03:00:46.370 --> 03:00:47.230]
Let's not put either one of them on.

[03:00:47.370 --> 03:00:47.590]
Okay.

[03:00:48.630 --> 03:00:49.550]
The other one is good.

[03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:50.950]
They're not going to get any votes.

[03:00:51.330 --> 03:00:53.930]
What movie of watch the most times in your life?

[03:00:55.350 --> 03:00:57.110]
Godfather 177, Star Wars 51.

[03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:58.690]
I told you this morning, Star Wars.

[03:00:59.010 --> 03:00:59.230]
Did I?

[03:00:59.890 --> 03:01:00.090]
Yep.

[03:01:00.590 --> 03:01:06.270]
Wizard of Oz 39, airplane 25, Christmas story 22, clockwork or it was Georgia's.

[03:01:06.350 --> 03:01:07.490]
I voted for the Godfather.

[03:01:08.430 --> 03:01:10.950]
Now, how come nobody has said Godfather to?

[03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.850]
Good, Kurt.

[03:01:13.870 --> 03:01:15.130]
Should we put that on there?

[03:01:15.550 --> 03:01:15.750]
Sure.

[03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:19.010]
Because there are people who do like it better in spite of my opinion.

[03:01:19.070 --> 03:01:20.490]
My opinion doesn't count on this poll.

[03:01:20.670 --> 03:01:22.310]
I need to be yours, being her boy.

[03:01:23.430 --> 03:01:28.010]

Never watched any movie more than once still in E5.

[03:02:00.350 --> 03:02:01.430]
Why do you think that would be?

[03:02:02.310 --> 03:02:02.890]
They lie a lot.

[03:02:03.890 --> 03:02:07.150]
No, I think maybe because they just never saw that could have a movie.

[03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:10.750]
They've got to be movies that you want to see more than once if they're really great.

[03:02:11.250 --> 03:02:13.610]
Or maybe they don't have a TV, maybe they don't get out much.

[03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.250]
Yeah.

[03:02:15.150 --> 03:02:15.930]

[03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:51.290]
This is spinal tap.

[03:02:51.510 --> 03:02:52.810]
And what's the part of time in America?

[03:02:53.510 --> 03:02:56.290]

The Rocky Horror Picture Show don't have any.

[03:03:02.690 --> 03:03:03.370]
I know it just went up.

[03:03:03.570 --> 03:03:04.270]
I don't have any yet.

[03:03:05.690 --> 03:03:06.750]
Are you smitten me?

[03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.190]
Nope.

[03:03:08.930 --> 03:03:09.990]

But they will.

[03:03:16.370 --> 03:03:17.570]
This is the Polish Friday.

[03:03:17.610 --> 03:03:18.770]
So it'll be up there all weekend long.

[03:03:18.850 --> 03:03:20.210]
The votes will come pouring in now.

[03:03:20.290 --> 03:03:22.370]
Not that they finally got something that tickled their fancy.

[03:03:22.470 --> 03:03:24.210]
You think they'll come pouring and you watch.

[03:03:26.490 --> 03:03:26.810]
22.

[03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:27.750]
I wanted 5.

[03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:28.550]

[03:03:28.730 --> 03:03:29.530]
Mother's Day is Sunday.

[03:03:29.670 --> 03:03:30.250]
Let me take a drink.

[03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.590]

[03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:34.270]
Ah.

[03:03:34.450 --> 03:03:34.450]

[03:03:34.970 --> 03:03:38.350]
In fact, what I should do before this spot is I should sniff some more of that package.

[03:03:38.550 --> 03:03:39.310]
It's in the trash again.

[03:03:40.290 --> 03:03:40.610]
Hmm.

[03:03:41.890 --> 03:03:42.630]
Mother's Day is this Sunday.

[03:03:42.730 --> 03:03:46.490]
The good news is that there's still time to send your mom, wife, and grandma something extra special this year.

[03:03:46.730 --> 03:03:47.730]
How about we send something to her?

[03:03:47.790 --> 03:03:48.230]
What's your name?

[03:03:49.130 --> 03:03:50.350]
Gold, uh, Sarah Gold Farm.

[03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:51.790]
Yes, she needs something.

[03:03:52.150 --> 03:03:52.790]
Some pills.

[03:03:53.350 --> 03:03:54.190]
Show them how much you've got.

[03:03:54.190 --> 03:03:56.150]
I appreciate them by sending an authentic Vermont teddy bear.

[03:03:56.270 --> 03:04:01.710]
She'll receive a beautiful bear personalized just for her and delivered with a free card and gourmet candy and a colorful gift box.

[03:04:02.130 --> 03:04:07.390]
They've got great bears like the spa mob bear, the mom's biggest fan bear or the new queen for a day bear.

[03:04:07.770 --> 03:04:09.050]
And please keep in mind, dads.

[03:04:09.130 --> 03:04:11.450]
It's your job every year to get a gift from their kids to mom.

[03:04:11.810 --> 03:04:13.450]
And the mother and cubset is a neat idea.

[03:04:13.450 --> 03:04:16.350]
Add as many little cubs you need with her names embroidered right on the outfits.

[03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:18.210]
They've got guaranteed Saturday delivery.

[03:04:18.430 --> 03:04:21.430]
So her bear will still arrive in time for Mother's Day if you act today.

[03:04:21.430 --> 03:04:25.290]
It's a lot more creative and thoughtful than flowers which die and wilt in no time at all.

[03:04:25.610 --> 03:04:26.770]
And this gift lasts a lifetime.

[03:04:26.970 --> 03:04:29.770]
So call 1-800-829 bear in a friendly bear counselor.

[03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:35.110]
We'll have you tell her a bear just for her social know you put some real thought into your gift this year ordering as quick as a piece of cake.

Self-hating homeowner, he's got a marriage.

Don't stand up the white house, oh mo'er.

He's a fairness, that hooded smoke with a blow of dawn.

Of young as strong, does what he stole for.

[03:06:41.670 --> 03:06:49.230]
Fancy brown hole, and he never eats tuna on a roll.

[03:06:49.930 --> 03:06:55.390]
There is a screaming, lifting fairy's hoots.

What about close encounters of the worst time?

[03:07:29.550 --> 03:07:31.270]
Close encounters, let's get that on there.

[03:07:31.930 --> 03:07:33.450]
Don't get started on the score.

[03:07:41.130 --> 03:07:43.330]
There are some people who never had a score bar.

[03:07:46.050 --> 03:07:48.450]
That's right, if you want to become like Sarah Goldfarb,

[03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:51.850]
instead of popping pills in your post, you'll be popping score bits.

[03:07:53.850 --> 03:07:56.030]
SKOR, I can't believe nobody ever had a score bar.

[03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:57.830]
Now, being a boarder like you, because it's a candy bar.

[03:07:58.010 --> 03:08:00.230]
Is there any kind of candy that you do eat?

[03:08:01.850 --> 03:08:02.290]
Skittles?

[03:08:03.310 --> 03:08:05.990]
Oh, geez, that's nasty stuff.

[03:08:06.090 --> 03:08:07.590]
That's for little kids, spittles.

[03:08:08.130 --> 03:08:09.410]
Yeah, he eats spittles.

[03:08:09.650 --> 03:08:10.410]
That's what Duff said.

[03:08:13.650 --> 03:08:17.450]
Oh, my God.

[03:08:18.450 --> 03:08:21.250]
Why do you hear that thing about singing for your supper, haven't you?

[03:08:22.310 --> 03:08:23.910]
That's where that song came from.

[03:08:27.670 --> 03:08:31.570]
That seriously isn't there any kind of real candy you like beside chocolate?

[03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:34.550]
There's like, help me out here.

[03:08:34.650 --> 03:08:38.750]
What other, like, those slices, those fruit sliced things in the sky.

[03:08:41.570 --> 03:08:42.710]
I like that.

[03:08:43.090 --> 03:08:43.490]
I like that.

[03:08:46.210 --> 03:08:47.210]
I like that.

[03:08:47.210 --> 03:08:48.730]
I like that.

[03:08:49.190 --> 03:08:49.190]

[03:08:49.970 --> 03:08:49.990]
I like that.

[03:08:49.990 --> 03:08:50.030]
I like that.

[03:08:50.030 --> 03:08:50.050]
I like that.

[03:08:50.050 --> 03:08:50.210]
I like that.

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.210]

[03:08:50.210 --> 03:08:50.230]
I like that.

[03:08:50.230 --> 03:08:50.230]

[03:08:50.230 --> 03:08:50.890]
I like that.

[03:08:51.550 --> 03:08:53.770]
I like that.

[03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:07.590]
I like that.

[03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:15.590]
I like that.

[03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.590]

[03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.590]

[03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:17.410]
This is almost as good as farting in the shower.

[03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:19.110]
Almost.

[03:09:21.130 --> 03:09:27.470]
Let's see, Todd and Hollywood says, speaking of the Taste of Dogcraft, the second most ultimate midnight movie is Pink Flamingo's with Divine.

[03:09:27.690 --> 03:09:29.070]
But that's not his choice for the list.

[03:09:29.470 --> 03:09:34.490]
His choice is, it's a mad, mad world because it came out when he was a kid, he unleashed the 30 times.

[03:09:35.790 --> 03:09:38.790]
Also, it's his, he has its obvious to me why Joe Costello sucks now.

[03:09:38.930 --> 03:09:39.370]
He got married.

[03:09:39.550 --> 03:09:42.910]
Every married guy knows an effing idiot including me, so Todd and Hollywood.

[03:09:43.130 --> 03:09:43.230]
See?

[03:09:43.730 --> 03:09:44.650]
That's what happened to poor Joe.

[03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:45.450]
He used to be pretty good.

[03:09:45.550 --> 03:09:46.810]
Not great, but he was, he was coming along.

[03:09:47.090 --> 03:09:49.730]
And now he got married and his whole act is gone.

[03:09:50.530 --> 03:09:51.350]
And you warned him.

[03:09:51.630 --> 03:09:52.070]
Didn't you like that?

[03:09:52.070 --> 03:09:52.430]
I tried.

[03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.930]
Oh, yeah.

[03:09:53.070 --> 03:09:53.470]
And you know what?

[03:09:53.530 --> 03:09:54.430]
It's not too late for Miguel.

[03:09:54.670 --> 03:09:55.290]
I keep warning him.

[03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:58.190]
Oh, is he going to get married to that fine-year lady?

[03:09:58.370 --> 03:09:58.530]
Yeah.

[03:09:58.570 --> 03:09:59.070]
It's too late.

[03:09:59.610 --> 03:10:00.210]
No, it's not.

[03:10:00.650 --> 03:10:01.070]
He'll tell you.

[03:10:01.230 --> 03:10:01.650]
It's too late.

[03:10:02.030 --> 03:10:02.690]
What do you mean by that?

[03:10:03.390 --> 03:10:04.070]
Well, they're engaged.

[03:10:04.070 --> 03:10:04.710]
You already cut him off?

[03:10:06.090 --> 03:10:07.390]
Oh, they're engaged in a fee.

[03:10:07.490 --> 03:10:09.410]
It doesn't go follow through then she will cut him off.

[03:10:09.570 --> 03:10:10.170]
Well, yeah, we'll see.

[03:10:10.350 --> 03:10:10.990]
Here's my thing.

[03:10:11.090 --> 03:10:13.890]
What is a guy like him after we're about being cut off by some broader?

[03:10:14.210 --> 03:10:16.810]
I mean, she may be very, very nice, but he can get pretty much whatever he wants.

[03:10:16.970 --> 03:10:17.030]
Right.

[03:10:17.050 --> 03:10:17.870]
What if she cuts it off?

[03:10:18.450 --> 03:10:19.130]
Well, there you go.

[03:10:20.450 --> 03:10:22.430]
Here's the fact from Wally and Broward who says,

[03:10:22.430 --> 03:10:25.690]
I'd like to respond to the fact that we proclaim Catch 22 to be a great movie.

[03:10:25.890 --> 03:10:30.050]
Catch 22 is a perfect example of great novels that don't translate to the screen.

[03:10:30.570 --> 03:10:35.910]
And I will say this 99 times out of 100, the book is better than the movie, including Godfather.

[03:10:37.610 --> 03:10:41.390]
Joseph Heller wrote Catch 22 and arguably is one of the great modern American novels,

[03:10:41.890 --> 03:10:42.470]
Sucked as a movie.

[03:10:42.970 --> 03:10:44.790]
Way too complex to capture Hell's message.

[03:10:45.210 --> 03:10:48.090]
Thankfully, no one made Hellers second novel, something happened into a screenplay.

[03:10:48.410 --> 03:10:49.410]
Talk about your one-hit wonders.

[03:10:49.570 --> 03:10:51.870]
It says, I've reread Catch 22 numerous times over the years.

[03:10:52.210 --> 03:10:53.270]
Maybe that's a future pull.

[03:10:53.470 --> 03:10:55.470]
Now Wally then comes back to a sense.

[03:10:55.570 --> 03:10:57.230]
It says, no, then the audience, I have to read books.

[03:10:58.030 --> 03:10:59.970]
He wants to nominate Song of the South.

[03:11:01.730 --> 03:11:03.170]
Song of the South for the pull.

[03:11:03.310 --> 03:11:04.170]
How do you like that?

[03:11:05.250 --> 03:11:05.970]
I, Snorke!

[03:11:06.050 --> 03:11:07.370]
Keep that blue bird out of here, Wally.

[03:11:08.510 --> 03:11:10.390]
And, John and North Miami Beach.

[03:11:11.410 --> 03:11:12.290]
Did you read this thing?

[03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.390]
Did I?

[03:11:13.710 --> 03:11:15.150]
About the censored bits in the CD.

[03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:17.430]
The answer, John, is to make a long story short.

[03:11:17.810 --> 03:11:17.850]
No.

[03:11:18.790 --> 03:11:19.850]
Can we be intimidated?

[03:11:20.170 --> 03:11:21.530]
Can we be put in our place?

[03:11:21.690 --> 03:11:22.910]
Yes, we need the work.

[03:11:24.470 --> 03:11:26.030]
What's some of this other stuff we can, whatever?

[03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:28.850]
And plus John North Miami Beach has got three on here.

[03:11:28.930 --> 03:11:29.310]
The warriors.

[03:11:29.310 --> 03:11:30.390]
Did we put that on here already?

[03:11:30.550 --> 03:11:30.730]
Yes.

[03:11:30.970 --> 03:11:31.950]
Yes, that's on here.

[03:11:32.950 --> 03:11:34.290]
Grease and murder by death.

[03:11:34.350 --> 03:11:36.770]
Let's put murder by death because Grease is John Revolta.

[03:11:37.330 --> 03:11:38.990]
And even if he has seen it a whole bunch of times,

[03:11:38.990 --> 03:11:39.950]
who else is in Grease?

[03:11:40.290 --> 03:11:41.190]
Olivia Neutron-Bom.

[03:11:41.710 --> 03:11:42.990]
Oh, Olivia's Neutron-Bom?

[03:11:43.350 --> 03:11:43.450]
Oh.

[03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:45.710]
You know she was very de-Mantla-Panzi.

[03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:46.450]
I guess you do know that.

[03:11:46.710 --> 03:11:48.430]
Oh, now there is a movie I've seen several times.

[03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:49.990]
I thought that it's in a running with Godfather.

[03:11:50.670 --> 03:11:51.230]
My tutor.

[03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:52.310]
Okay.

[03:11:52.670 --> 03:11:54.910]
It's a QC movie and Matt Latanzi looks real good.

[03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:57.850]
And so did what's her name, whoever they plays the tutor.

[03:11:58.350 --> 03:11:58.650]
Yeah.

[03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:59.830]
You know that movie?

[03:12:00.270 --> 03:12:00.610]
I know it.

[03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:01.110]
I'd tutor.

[03:12:01.930 --> 03:12:03.690]
It's a you tutor, yeah.

[03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.650]
I'm sure you would.

[03:12:05.230 --> 03:12:07.210]
And of course he's running out like mostly naked.

[03:12:07.210 --> 03:12:08.270]
Most of the movie, Matt Latanzi.

[03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:09.450]
What ever happened to him, huh?

[03:12:10.190 --> 03:12:10.430]
Age.

[03:12:11.510 --> 03:12:13.030]
Very Malphia Newton, John.

[03:12:13.330 --> 03:12:13.930]
Oh, geez.

[03:12:14.190 --> 03:12:16.010]
You know, I really do need to read that speak of that.

[03:12:17.430 --> 03:12:19.230]
Nick Kristall started holding the New York Times today.

[03:12:19.330 --> 03:12:20.290]
No time to get squeamish.

[03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:22.730]
At least part of it.

[03:12:23.250 --> 03:12:25.730]
Because it should give you an idea of just how I'm not exaggerating.

[03:12:26.450 --> 03:12:28.290]
It's getting more and more frightening by the day.

[03:12:28.430 --> 03:12:32.350]
And if people would just open up their eyes and ears and listen and do a little reading of their own,

[03:12:32.430 --> 03:12:35.710]
and they're posted like reading the two crap fish rappers down there,

[03:12:36.070 --> 03:12:37.730]
they'd be starting to get pretty nervous too.

[03:12:38.450 --> 03:12:41.050]
He says most AIDS scientists are terrified of these days.

[03:12:41.170 --> 03:12:44.170]
They describe which hunts by neo-Puritans in and out of the Bush administration.

[03:12:44.670 --> 03:12:48.850]
And many are so nervous that an email and research app strikes the avoid using words like gays,

[03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:51.370]
homosexuals, amelsex or sex workers.

[03:12:51.370 --> 03:12:56.490]
So scientists that the National Institutes of Health and Elsewhere are devising their own secret code.

[03:12:56.710 --> 03:13:01.750]
I won't give it away, but one term stands for gay or homosexual, another for anal sex and so on.

[03:13:02.430 --> 03:13:06.150]
I would recommend avoiding all electronic communication to any NIH office,

[03:13:06.470 --> 03:13:10.010]
one scientist born in one of many emails, no, it's buzzing among AIDS researchers.

[03:13:10.530 --> 03:13:12.870]
Phone communication does not appear tapped at this time.

[03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:19.370]
Even so, I'm advising staff to speak in code unless an NIH staff member indicates you can speak freely.

[03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:23.990]
In short, assume you're living in Stalinist Russia when communicating with the US government.

[03:13:24.750 --> 03:13:28.810]
As my time's colleague, Erica Goodnode, in breaking the story last month,

[03:13:29.190 --> 03:13:34.170]
researchers have been told by NIH project officers to avoid sensitive language and grant applications.

[03:13:34.670 --> 03:13:39.590]
A University of California researcher, for example, was told to cleanse the abstract of his grant proposal

[03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:42.570]
of words like gay, homosexual and transgender.

[03:13:43.270 --> 03:13:46.590]
Since his research was on HIV and gay men, this was a challenge.

[03:13:46.590 --> 03:13:51.470]
How can scholars investigate how AIDS spreads without using words that make the religious right blush?

[03:13:52.430 --> 03:13:54.490]
Perhaps this seems like an obscure issue, it's not.

[03:13:55.050 --> 03:13:58.610]
The fundamental question is whether elements of the Bush administration are politicizing science,

[03:13:58.930 --> 03:14:04.270]
using budgets advisory committees in the fear of embarrassment to chill the way that science is conducted in America.

[03:14:05.990 --> 03:14:07.050]
And then it goes on.

[03:14:07.410 --> 03:14:09.990]
In fact, one more sentence, if I can, can I do it? Please.

[03:14:10.370 --> 03:14:14.770]
He says, especially in the case of AIDS, which kills more people in two hours than SARS has killed in total,

[03:14:14.770 --> 03:14:19.750]
vast numbers of human lives are at stake in America alone, 12,000 people by every year of AIDS,

[03:14:19.870 --> 03:14:24.510]
the difference between solid scientific research and pseudoscience will be measured in millions of lives saved.

[03:14:24.850 --> 03:14:25.590]
There you go.

[03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:29.410]
Yeah, but careful the word you say because we don't want to alleviate the Christian right,

[03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:30.930]
they're very sensitive and touchy, etc.

[03:14:31.190 --> 03:14:32.590]
It's still killing mostly faggots, right?

[03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:34.390]
Oh my God.

[03:14:34.990 --> 03:14:37.490]
12.54 at 5.60 wqam.

[03:14:37.830 --> 03:14:40.530]

[03:14:40.530 --> 03:14:42.750]

And don't forget it is Mother's Day.

[03:14:59.930 --> 03:15:06.990]
The Sunday Barbecue's Lord has got incredible gifts for mom, everything from a new grill to backyard accents that will make it a nicer place for the family to spend time together.

[03:15:07.450 --> 03:15:08.110]

[03:15:40.650 --> 03:15:41.770]
It's you AM.

[03:15:43.270 --> 03:15:45.290]
Thank you, Miss Mary, for your service.

[03:15:48.150 --> 03:15:56.890]
The Middle Eastern World will be exploded to dom at people killed with the gas that we sold in.

[03:15:56.890 --> 03:16:05.190]
First time aggressive nation and the only one that's growing, now more blood will be spilled to get that oil going.

[03:16:05.610 --> 03:16:10.930]
Forget about Korea and the notes they're talking about are right.

[03:16:11.290 --> 03:16:19.830]
We is drilling it over and over into our hips, okay, that iraq has some.

[03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:24.710]
Memphis of master's structure, dirt.

[03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:39.870]
3000 people killed, I'm now forgotten, let's exploit them instead,

[03:16:40.390 --> 03:16:44.510]
Ate their oil to be cotton, going after satan to,

[03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:50.270]
Plankato, Samma, there's no longer mention of the name in law,

[03:16:50.410 --> 03:16:54.930]
but no one seems concerned of me and complacent,

[03:16:55.190 --> 03:17:04.270]
believe in every word of this cartel of administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right.

[03:17:04.650 --> 03:17:10.110]
Wean is drilling it over and over into our hips,

[03:17:10.110 --> 03:17:16.310]
that iraq has some weapons of master's structure.
