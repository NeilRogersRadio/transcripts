[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]
I think that you see Russia speech at the nab I saw like about ten seconds of it

[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:12.660]
Oh, I guess he he was asked about the drug case and he said that he doesn't know anything about any investigation

[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.780]
But he will cooperate when he's asked. Oh, yeah, I saw the clip and but he didn't deny it though

[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.220]
You know, no, he didn't deny poppinos 80 million pills and about the feeling her upper any wires on her body

[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.480]
It's that her. Yeah, that's what our old was doing out there in California was feeling all those bros up to see if they were if they were wired

[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.720]
Yeah, that could be that might be it. He looks like he's wired

[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.980]
He you know, I know this way he walks he doesn't I was watching the newscast last night and he walked into a building with a bunch of people and I swear to you

[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.660]
They were goose stepping hmm

[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.100]
You can hear that you can hear that exactly

[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.980]
Hairman's fourth dagger of course the fact that his father was a Nazi in Austria. We supposed to overlook that too

[00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.580]
You know, yeah, we all have skeletons somewhere. Yeah in our closet like rush with all in my bottles of pills

[00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.080]
Couldn't couldn't have it a more deserving guy now

[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.160]
What do you think about poor for all the way that they're brow beating him now? I don't know what happened with

[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.680]
I just walked in here. I was listening to him this morning and sounds like he's going through the usual

[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.440]
Yeah, Georgia will tell you the judge will fill you in on the blanks. Okay. It's the usual Ojoan provocateurs

[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.940]
You know the other thing rush said was that he didn't say anything at all

[00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.940]
This is really insane, but this is what he does with his radio shows and everything else he does

[00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:35.260]
He makes crap off spins crap, you know, and what he said was he didn't say anything about Macnav he was talking about the media

[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400]
Oh right sure sure

[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.800]
But I can tell you this his resignation was forced. Oh, no question about it. Absolutely. Yeah

[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.900]
Just kind of like a dumb Shula. I'm sorry, but at any rate

[00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.900]
Well, I'll say first of all listen, you know, I mean I'm a football fan to a point

[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.380]
I like you are because it's your livelihood, but I don't disagree with you. No, that's exactly what happened

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.760]
Anybody who would say that Donovan McNabb is is

[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.780]
Overrated in the media have this desire to prop him up like it said any article in the daily in whatever paper was this morning

[00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.060]
Seven starting quarterbacks Sunday were black two others were injured or there would have been nine and the media got some kind of

[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.000]
It's an issue that died 10 years ago right exactly

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.600]
Like right should have I'll tell you what happened by a way a little bit of insight. Okay, okay?

[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.100]
Okay, the first week he was on the first show he talked about the failed

[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.840]
Affirmative action policy in the NFL for coaches and then he did a little thing about that and they told him after that

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.800]
That they want him to spark controversy, but they want him to stay away from the politics

[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.780]
Yeah, okay, so what does he come back and do three weeks later exactly what they told him not? Yeah, well

[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.060]
It was a bad mistake like I said before would be like if NBC fired Tom Brokhan put Ozzy Osborne on to do the nightly news and

[00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.580]
When the first 30 seconds he said drop the F bomb about six times and they got all done out of shape and act like they were surprised

[00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.660]
You know they got exactly what they should have known they were gonna get and it's a tourist yep

[00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.500]
Good here Friday now. What are you doing in there? You're not working today? I'm working on a project for somebody that requires some research

[00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.900]
So I'm in your working some research. Hey listen don't overdo it man. I won't don't worry about that

[00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.660]
I like your schedule this week you're starting to make me jealous

[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.240]
Exactly that's what I'm talking about take care of back Tuesday, and you'll see you then

[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.360]
More pay less work that's the QMF in way hey, let me tell you were the one who told me a year ago, okay?

[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.960]
You said just ride this gravy train and don't worry about it

[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.980]
Did you not tell me that absolutely? Thank you you bet and I'm I'm congratulating you

[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.180]
You're doing a hell of a job and a mad dog too. He works about two days a month

[00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.800]
It's not a bad deal all again. No. I'll take it anyway. We're like about five minutes behind one o'clock at 5'60 WDQ
