[00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.320]
Anyways, he on there. Can I talk to him?

[00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.960]
Oh yeah, I'm just practicing. He's just cleaning his torso.

[00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.560]
Oh, just cleaning out my pipes.

[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.300]
I was gonna do this. Is this true? You just don't leave this hanging out.

[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.200]
You're telling everybody that guilty is the build out?

[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.620]
It's obvious. I mean the guy just did a pull the no show.

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.520]
I mean, he just did it. I mean, who just doesn't show?

[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.220]
A guy that can't handle his partner anymore.

[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.580]
Probably, and he's probably off having an interview.

[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480]
He's probably in Los Angeles as we speak.

[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.360]
You do understand that since the Howard started like,

[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.340]
which is a year ago March, since he started a guilty was the only one that held on and held on.

[00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.980]
You know, for some preservation, say, I guess.

[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.760]
And he finally just ran out of patience.

[00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.080]
His wife stopped. No, Mo. His wife stopped smiling.

[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.360]
She used to smile. I started to go alternative and she looked like she had barbed wire on her lips.

[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.900]
She had a sour look on her face. She just wish. I think she met me.

[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.140]
And her forehead had a red light going off like a hooker house.

[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.820]
So how does this, so how does this a boat for next week?

[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.400]
Now, what's the schedule going to be? You're going to come in early now and hold Mo's hand because the old man.

[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.680]
I mean, you've got to get up three in the morning. He can't. He can't cut the whole three hours alone.

[00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.680]
I think he hates everybody. All I know is that I went free here.

[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.680]
It is Jewish golf club. That's all I go out there. I just want to play free golf.

[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.120]
Yeah. That's all I do.

[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.780]
Well, guarantee you the minute you walk in the door, boy. His face is going to let up like a goddamn pinball machine.

[00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.860]
Can you see tomorrow I'm going to a four dealership. I'm going to look like a big chocolate dildo sitting in a dealer car dealer for two hours.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.040]
What am I going to do there? I'm going to try to kidnap children or something.

[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.100]
You know how he's changing the subject, but that's okay.

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.100]
No, listen, I don't want to. It's good. But he is just going to build up a little suspense for Monday and the audience can tune in and find out who shows up.

[00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.080]
Why don't you come home or something? Why are you in like that 70 cent whorehouse up there?

[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.880]
Get your ass back down here. Why not?

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.800]
You keep saying that because it's it. I mean, I love it. I'm jealous. You've got the life of Riley.

[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.840]
Well, your psychic powers are kicking in because I'll be seeing you on Monday.

[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.920]
So my pirate, as he coming down here.

[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.940]
Yeah. Oh, that is sweet. So my pirates just to see you.

[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.560]
My pirates were up there this week.

[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.620]
We didn't got their asses kicked.

[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.500]
Who doesn't kick the pirates ass?

[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540]
And the best news of it is that seven that you don't even know this yet.

[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.520]
Seventh inning stretch that came on the is of the 22nd.

[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.680]
Yeah, that you're giving the tickets away. They hate the Metsonite.

[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.340]
Seventh inning stretch. That's the night that right at home plate.

[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.380]
The beast is going to get done all fours and the clearest is going to mount the beast right in the middle of the morning.

[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.360]
You got some nasty pictures of all four of Moe in that website of yours. That is some horny stuff.

[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.480]
I'm throwing out the first pitch on the 22nd, which is Sunday, I think.

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.580]
But I'm doing the Wednesday night. I hate the Metsonite.

[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.480]
And then my next event is going to be the, but I'm throwing out the first pitch Sunday.

[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.720]
And then the following week, the Braves are in. I'm having John Smoltz's Jesus night.

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.500]
So yeah, you know, I'm really one that's ever going to be, I know what you think of tomorrow.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.560]
And I listen to you and you think it's like an abortion.

[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.360]
But I'm going to revolutionize it. You're the new kid. Oh, yeah.

[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.440]
I guarantee it. You're going to see next Wednesday night.

[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.260]
You were doing so good right up until now. I will have two sections in a film dream world.

[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.380]
Listen to me. I will have two sections filled with big, huge rack.

[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.620]
Well, great. I got every horn stop. He even pickets away. Man, no problem. You'll fill a whole ballpark. Are you giving away?

[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.680]
I always told my mom and dad I'd have friends if I had three things to give away.

[00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.280]
Everyone's my especially in this town. Trust me. I'm bringing the hammer.

[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.460]
We're going to go to to season. Hit on some skanky flesh from 530 to 7.

[00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.540]
And then we're going over to that wretched ballpark and we're just going to cry.

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.780]
We're going to abuse the match so bad that I believe one of them will jump into the stands and kill the scurvering about another week.

[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.600]
Skanky flesh is what this audience wants to hear about. Not about the Marlins.

[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.880]
But you'll find out for yourself. I have both ends of it covered. I got the Marlins and the skanky flesh.

[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.720]
That's what Clarence said. He's got both ends of it covered.

[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.960]
You know, do you think Beast will ever get laid?

[00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.680]
No. That's why I'm trying to do this.

[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.700]
The Beast and Clarence either want them to get laid and amped to them.

[00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.300]
And that's why we're hooking them up together.

[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.600]
You know, you know, your studio in here is like a pharmacy.

[00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.040]
I walked through there. I mean, I went in there. I didn't even have to stand in line.

[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.560]
There's stuff coming.

[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.340]
No, it's not like a pharmacy. It's like a restaurant now because you guys, I mean, don't be a pussy.

[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.820]
Okay. If they put a memo out like that, tell them like this.

[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.180]
Yeah. Don't believe that. Crap. Just eat what you want.

[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.260]
Just eat what you want. Don't be in the question.

[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.300]
Just stare back in his bags right now. Get ready to go to Omaha to hang out with a bunch of red necks and cow tippers.

[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.260]
You you ever been in Omaha? That chicks would no teeth.

[00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.780]
Have you ever been in Omaha? I I got to be dead.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.080]
No, Omaha's actually a pretty great place. The people there are beautiful because it's like corn fed Midwestern.

[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.180]
I did the college world series five years in Robert Hurricanes, which you probably don't even know that.

[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.920]
College of it. Now I explain to me how does a college baseball coach?

[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.860]
I don't care if he's got a 40 foot long. I just see make a million dollars.

[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.100]
Jim Morris is making a million dollar.

[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.960]
That's why everyone's telling me this gets a million. He makes a million of your coach in the college. He was aluminum bats.

[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.300]
I'll be damned. I mean, that's what makes the things.

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.680]
Don't you like to plank? It's kind of like planko on a price.

[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.000]
Let's see. Right. It makes that plank up next to you.

[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.520]
What do you make about five million a year? So I mean, I just don't understand how a baseball coach of any kind.

[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.260]
You think Jack McKee is actually one of Madame Chordos waxed all.

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.920]
He's on social security. Forget about this. He's got some power seats hanging on his.

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.880]
That's where Marlon's brought him. He works cheap. He's collecting social security.

[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.520]
Well, listen, it's four minutes after ten or three weeks.

[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.140]
Hey, can you ask your last week? Can you sleep with your eyes open?

[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.860]
Yes, thank you. Have a good weekend.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.560]
See you Monday.

[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.440]
Friday, you bestie.

[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.320]
Do do do do do.

[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:22.400]
Five, six, eight, W, U, A, M, R, S, W, Q, A, M, full caps.

[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.660]
Starting Harvey, high, S, E, S, R, T, Bill, tenor.

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.800]
Robert Green has her old Gregory.

[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.300]
Held his letter and Jeff divorce.

[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.260]
And Andy Dick has driving the blinsey.

[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.340]
What's your problem, Lindsay? I can't get my hemlines straight.

[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.100]
What? Get out there on the grind.

[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.000]
Okay. What? I mean, yes sir. Step nimbley on those heel-sister.

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.160]
Step nimbley on those heel-sister.

[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.800]
Step nimbley on those heel-sister.

[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.520]
Step nimbley on those heel-sister.

[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.120]
Hey buddy, I got a hot tip on the boys.

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.400]
The whole deep hole.

[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.800]
I heard that private defile.

[00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.400]
Oh, I guess I...

[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.020]
The point to Colonel Reeves' office on the double.

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.460]
Why, yes, certainly.

[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.740]
For a port and a zorted vinyl reef.

[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.740]
Well, that is private.

[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.560]
Thanks sir.

[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.640]
And now look it.

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.300]
There's a mole in the company.

[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:22.980]
A mole sir?

[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.980]
Yes. And I'd like to know who that might be.

[00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.860]
Well, I...

[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:28.780]
I think it's you sir.

[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.540]
Oh no.

[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.500]
Oh no.

[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.140]
They'll never know it's me.

[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.300]
I'll run away.

[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.780]
Everybody!

[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.500]
I don't think they're visible.

[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.840]
You can't hide it.

[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.340]
You can't hide it.

[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.120]
I don't know what I've been told.

[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.980]
I don't know what I've been told.

[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.940]
Big leg is moving in just no soul.

[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.720]
Big leg is moving in just no soul.

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.720]
Whole catgo, catgo, catgo.

[00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:05.920]
Linux Super Engine

[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.840]
No, not that way!

[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.220]
No! On top of Carol!

[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.960]
Ah!

[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.880]
Yeah!

[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.020]
Oh, no!

[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.900]
Ah!

[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.880]
Oh, no!

[00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.800]
Anybody want me to open the barracks and even do twins?

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.280]
That's your paid off big time, didn't it?

[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]
That's QA and Bootcamp!

[00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:22.560]
No!

[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.520]
I almost forgot about that whole episode, you know?

[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.100]
Oh, how could you?

[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.000]
I've been trying to push it back out of my mind,

[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.080]
kind of like the way we're pushing Mo back into the middle of the night.

[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.700]
So we got a major development at QA and...

[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.860]
So, and I, and again, I'm only quoting Farell because we don't know he might just be a troublemaker, although I don't think so.

[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.460]
But the guilty evidently not only was absent this morning, but AWOL, he just called inside, I'm not coming.

[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.280]
I'm not gonna be there.

[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.200]
Not like I'm sick, not like my wife is sick, or the baby is puking a green smegma,

[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.800]
but I'm just not gonna be there.

[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.020]
And according to what I'm hearing from Bienerboy,

[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.640]
although I don't want to mention getting into personalities,

[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.160]
but Bienerboy has been telling me that guilty and Mo have been like any to their throat,

[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.340]
literally on the early, look, last week has gotten really intense.

[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.840]
The tension is palatable.

[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:06.440]
Palatable.

[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.200]
Really?

[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.140]
In other words, it's thick.

[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:10.860]
It's really thick.

[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.040]
Seriously, I don't know what...

[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.200]
I mean, you know, Farell's a hoot, but once he's given an opening, you know?

[00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:22.300]
Man, he's a wild man, he just can't shut him up.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.380]
Which I don't really care because it kills him good time,

[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.840]
but we gotta get our breaks in, you know what I'm saying?

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.080]
Maybe we just ought to hold him over.

[00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.800]
Not over what?

[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.300]
Flane, a barrel?

[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.000]
That's gonna be great watching Clarence.

[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.140]
I want to be in town to see that when Clarence mounts the beast, right at home plate.

[00:08:39.540 --> 00:08:40.860]
I don't get a crown out there.

[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.620]
I guarantee you that.

[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:45.480]
Poor, well, Farell will learn a hard way, you know?

[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.820]
Given the thick tickets away, oh yeah, I'll take six.

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:48.500]
I'll take five.

[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.000]
And then he'll find out that most of those people aren't gonna show up anyway,

[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.900]
even for free.

[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:52.900]
They won't show up.

[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.680]
You remember years ago, maybe it was even before your time.

[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.540]
I think with the Panther Dallas game, I remember specifically,

[00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.600]
it was against the Dallas stars.

[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.380]
And it was like, I think the second year we had a hockey team in town.

[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:03.680]
Before my time.

[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.920]
And it was part of the fundraising thing, and like a schmuck,

[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.440]
I'd already given my donation.

[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.620]
But I came, you know, I forked over another one or two grand,

[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:13.620]
and I bought the tickets.

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.060]
I bought a whole bunch of Panther Dallas, you remember that?

[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:17.680]
Of course.

[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.520]
And gave them away with some difficulty, and we gave them away.

[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.480]
And then lo and end, they were all like in one session.

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:26.620]
Go to the game, and none of the people that we get the tickets

[00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:29.200]
who are there, in fact, most of the people who were sitting in the section,

[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.140]
which was fairly empty, but the ones who were there,

[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.440]
they didn't even know who the hell I was or what the show was all about,

[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.260]
or I never heard of it.

[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.260]
Because come to fight out that what the people did when they got the tickets,

[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.540]
a whole bunch of them sold them.

[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:39.820]
Right.

[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.080]
You know, like they were $30 tickets or whatever at that time.

[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.740]
So they sold them for like five bucks a piece.

[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.200]
Well, what would you do?

[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:46.220]
Sell them.

[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:47.820]
Burn them.

[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.140]
I mean, that's just what it is.

[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.040]
It's a free load in town.

[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.960]
But you know, you continue.

[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.040]
Another month or so, and then they'll wear off,

[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.920]
and he'll realize that it's a lost cause.

[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.820]
I'm glad he's enthused about the Marlins and all that other bull crap,

[00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.780]
but it's nobody cares.

[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:02.900]
Nobody cares if it's a bottle head dollar, something else for free,

[00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.260]
they'll be packing it, but other than that, forget about it.

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.480]
So Gelly may have been pushed over the edge by Moe,

[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.200]
which would be, he would be the last holdout.

[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.080]
Because we were talking about this before the show.

[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.660]
Everybody else that Moe is encountered that he's worked with.

[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.880]
His first was Kirlin, and then it was the Beast,

[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.820]
although I understand that.

[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.740]
And then it was, uh, who else?

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.020]
I mean, everybody that's been involved with him has just run,

[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.120]
shrieking and screaming from that studio.

[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.040]
They can't deal with him.

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.860]
He is impossible.

[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.980]
And Gelly's been the holdout cause he needs the job.

[00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.040]
He's got the wife and a kid.

[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.140]
He needs that paycheck.

[00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.940]
You know what that talks about?

[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.580]
A paycheck.

[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.100]
But sometimes you push people a little bit too far,

[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:43.840]
and even with that squeaky voice, I mean, Gelly's been around for a while now.

[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.560]
He can probably, you know, he's probably got some context.

[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.820]
And wasn't it here just a few weeks ago that the rumor was he was out at ESPN

[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.480]
looking for a job last time he didn't show up?

[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.240]
Wasn't that the rumor?

[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:51.700]
Yes.

[00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:52.640]
That was a rumor.

[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.880]
So now, Ferrell, and of course, uh, now look at it the other way,

[00:10:55.880 --> 00:11:01.040]
maybe Ferrell is hoping it might be wishful thinking because this might be the opening that he's looking for, you know.

[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:05.680]
Because he might just kind of move in there between six and eight, like join Mo,

[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.340]
and then of course Mo just kind of like fade off into the woodwork after about a week of that.

[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:09.820]
Huh?

[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.100]
Well, no, he'll just beat up on the old man enough so he just won't be able to handle it anymore.

[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.080]
And that'll be the end of that.

[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.120]
Well, I'm guaranteed.

[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:16.840]
Stay tuned.

[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.420]
Stay tuned because the QM soap opera gets more interesting by the minute.

[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.420]
Here's our pull from yesterday.

[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.400]
We had a thousand some odd votes.

[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.480]
Worst or most disappointing movie ending ever was, and I'm only going to read the ones in double digits.

[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.040]
Blair Witch Project, boy, look at it.

[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:31.660]
Not even close.

[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.320]
Pulled away 244.

[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.500]
Matrix reloaded 150.

[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.980]
Vanilla Sky 71, cast away 66.

[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.820]
AI 52.

[00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.440]
Plenty of the 851.

[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.380]
Contact 50.

[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.120]
That was the ajoity foster piece.

[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.140]
Yes, piece of crap.

[00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:49.520]
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 41.

[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.580]
Science 35, Hannibal 34.

[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:54.560]
Last American Virgin 31, Magnolia 30.

[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.200]
I don't, you did that.

[00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.200]
Yeah, I creeped it.

[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.240]
You, no, no, you talked him into it.

[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.800]
Holy Grail 28.

[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.600]
I mean, see, the ending in Magnolia was strange, but that wasn't the question.

[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.200]
Worst or most disappointing ending.

[00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:09.600]
Strange, bizarre.

[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:10.700]
Disappointing.

[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:11.460]
No.

[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.860]
I thought it was very funny.

[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.580]
What about you, being a boy, did you think it was very funny?

[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:17.400]
Yeah.

[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.260]
Unbreakable 22.

[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.400]
Let's see, weren't very enthusiastic, the way you said that.

[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.820]
Come on, whip it up.

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:23.800]
Well, I'm a little busy over here.

[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.760]
I'm like running around from one.

[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.980]
I've got to run to the mic.

[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:27.940]
Yeah, it was great.

[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:36.120]
Unbreakable 22, Monsters Ball 19, Minority Report 19, Fight Club 16, 1-hour photo 16, Xanadu 15,

[00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:38.080]
and Donny Darko, that was my vote, had 11.

[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.840]
Horrible ending, just unacceptable.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.180]
Okay, we got two polls today.

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.820]
Gregory Peck is dead at David Brickley or dead.

[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.760]
Same day.

[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.640]
Oh, brother.

[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.860]
We talked about the David Brickley thing, and then I get off the ear, and I'm, I'm prusing

[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.320]
on the internet, and I see Gregory Peck.

[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:54.780]
It's guy.

[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:55.540]
87.

[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.000]
Don't you think that's a shame that we lose two big people like that on the same day?

[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.900]
Yeah, but, you know, they hadn't been active for a while.

[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:08.720]
What do you mean by that?

[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.100]
It's not like they're going to stop performing.

[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.640]
Well, first of all, you don't know David Brickley from, uh, to Christie Brickley number one,

[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.240]
and number two, uh, Gregory Peck.

[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.220]
I guess you did probably see some Gregory Peck movie.

[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.300]
Sure, as a matter of fact, that reminded me that I wanted to put Moby Dick on the movie list.

[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.280]
Yeah.

[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:27.900]
Moby Dick.

[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:28.600]
Moby Dick.

[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:29.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.520]
I liked it.

[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:31.020]
It was good.

[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.640]
As opposed to like to kill a mockingbird or a gentleman's agreement to overrated to kill a mockingbird.

[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.420]
Or spellbound.

[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:36.700]
Right.

[00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:38.780]
Moby Dick.

[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:39.480]
Moby Dick.

[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.640]
1013 at 560 WQAM.

[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.880]
If you run the Atkins, don't any other low-carb sugar free diet.

[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:46.880]
You walk into your supermarket.

[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.080]
They got like one half of one, uh, shelf that's got just a swan handful of items that are low-carb.

[00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.700]
And the rest of the stuff in the store as you know are loaded with carbohydrates and forget about it.

[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.520]
Nothing for you to buy.

[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:58.580]
That's why you love shopping at Delights of West.

[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.380]
Not too far from Mocha's house.

My name is El Mar.

[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.200]
We are sports radio fighters.

[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.740]
2 AM.

[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.480]
For an abandoned the butt, honey.

[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:11.940]
Okay.

[00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:16.900]
Michael Iser.

[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:18.360]
Two rings, Iser.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.640]
It took two rings to answer.

[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:22.980]
What are you doing over there?

[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:25.500]
I'm sorry, so I just couldn't reach the phone.

[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.200]
I couldn't reach the world.

[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.580]
One ring, Iser.

[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.620]
We've been over this.

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.600]
I'm sorry.

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.980]
Get on the ball over there.

[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:32.340]
Okay.

[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.860]
We all hung over out with your mighty dicks.

[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:35.420]
Who, sir?

[00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:36.680]
The hockey kid.

[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.560]
Oh, the Anaheim mighty duck.

[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.000]
Oh, what a successful story that's been...

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.900]
I don't want to ever sell it.

[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:42.580]
Sell it.

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:42.660]

[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.340]
Now that team are terrible.

[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:46.180]
So they're in the Stanley Cup finals.

[00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.460]
What does that mean?

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.900]
Well, they're in the championship of the national.

[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:52.500]
I say that I'm not in the sports anyway.

[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.780]
I'm one of a porn miles.

[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:54.780]
I'm porn-mass.

[00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.140]
Forget about the ducks.

[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.720]
It's a stupid name anyway.

[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.920]
Who came up with it?

[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.340]
Well, I did, sir.

[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.260]
We remember we had that.

[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.500]
Oh, it's terrible.

[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.260]
And I see you hanging out with that straight brim on your hat.

[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.600]
You look like a moron next to Charlie Sheen.

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.200]
No, no, no, no.

[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:12.360]
That was Emilio Estabez, the star of the mighty duck.

[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.040]
They did.

[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.120]
It's the same kid.

[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.040]
Terrible.

[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.180]
The mighty duck hit.

[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.640]
I mean, they really are entertaining.

[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.040]
It's a great family value.

[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.720]
I don't care about the dick.

[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:21.620]
What?

[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:23.180]
Hang on a minute.

[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:23.980]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:25.900]
Oh, oh, oh.

[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.540]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.540]
What the hell is wrong with you, Ravens?

[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.440]
I'm not feel well, boss.

[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.100]
You're almost white.

[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:36.940]
Yeah, I'm pale, boss.

[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.900]
Oh, has some bad Chinese.

[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.020]
Some bad Chinese.

[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.740]
Yeah, middle-town town, boss, Lane.

[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.240]
Lane's a panda.

[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:48.020]
Whatever, boss, I've got to go.

[00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:49.100]
I'll get away from you.

[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.940]
Think like a brewery.

[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.380]
Oh, my God.

[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:53.120]
Good God.

[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:53.960]
I'll cover you.

[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:54.460]
Come on.

[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.160]
I, sir.

[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:55.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.400]
Well, things are going very well over here.

[00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.420]
You know, we have the mighty ducks in the Stanley Cup Final.

[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:00.460]
Terrible, so, um.

[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.900]
And we also have the Finding Nemo movie, which is doing very, very well.

[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.840]
Yeah, I'm in Viva.

[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.940]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:06.300]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:11.560]
Why do I have a check for $4 million on my desk and the thing made $70 million?

[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.820]
What kind of deal do we have with Pixar?

[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.640]
Well, we sort of...

[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.480]
Bring it on.

[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.100]
Did you do it?

[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.100]
I think I put myself off.

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.100]
You're put yourself...

[00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.840]
Viva, get out of the office.

[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:30.700]
We are...

[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.240]
My own money.

[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.300]
My own money.

[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:33.760]
My own money.

[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.600]
My own money.

[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.920]
I need a disc up in here.

[00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:37.780]
I, sir.

[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.160]
Prepare after me.

[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:41.280]
I...

[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:42.720]
I...

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.040]
Am...

[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:43.880]
And idiot.

[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:44.560]
And idiot.

[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:45.500]
Goodbye, I, sir.

[00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.460]
Okay, well, sir, would you like to take it to the mighty ducks?

[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.120]
I told you to sell the ducks.

[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:50.960]
Docks?

[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:53.020]
Change the name of that thing anyway.

[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.440]
Change the name of the...

[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.520]
Yeah, we gotta keep it.

[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.660]
Make it the leases.

[00:17:57.100 --> 00:17:57.720]
The leases.

[00:17:57.980 --> 00:17:58.640]
What are leases?

[00:17:59.300 --> 00:17:59.740]
Leases.

[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.920]
More than one mouse.

[00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:02.340]
That's just mice.

[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:02.920]
Yeah.

[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.860]
Are you correct, and leases?

[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.780]
No, sir.

[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:06.320]
That's good.

[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.020]
I hate it.

[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.420]
I hate it.

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.400]
Walk, balls.

[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:12.460]
My, oh my.

[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.280]
10-21 and 5-60 W-Q-I-M.

[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.280]
So the new, the first poll we got, two polls today, we got like part one and part two.

[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.360]
I think we ought to do that every day, don't you?

[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.140]
Although, my kid Eric a little bit bent out of shape.

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.720]
That should make any difference though, once Beener Burgerts control the whole thing.

[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:30.980]
Now, are we gonna have Scorley Moe on the website over the weekend?

[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:31.960]
Yes.

[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.700]
If you like the Mozo and the other Moe pictures and the other ones have, uh,

[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.840]
of course me and Moe asked to ask, if you like those pictures on our website,

[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.720]
wait till you see Scorley Moe.

[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:42.640]
Even the beast liked it.

[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:43.580]
I love eating nuts.

[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.460]
Yeah, wait till you see those swinging nuts.

[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.700]
Moe and his swinging nuts.

[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.360]
Scorley Moe.

[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.380]
So what's gonna be on our website any moment as a matter of fact,

[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.080]
here's the fact that it says, Neil, I hate you.

[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.080]
I cursed today you said, Roger's chocolates on the ear.

[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.100]
I'm on my second box.

[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.620]
As I grow fat, I spit on your name.

[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.920]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.060]
Oh, don't forget that, Roger's chocolates.com.

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.120]
Almond Brittle.

[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.800]
I wish I wouldn't have said that.

[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:07.920]
I can't find any place that sells it here anymore.

[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.440]
I'm glad that I had to find that out.

[00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.060]
Although you can't order it right off the internet.

[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:14.040]
Like George did.

[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.260]
No, I, uh, a nice listener brought it to an appearance.

[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:18.480]
Oh, really?

[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:19.700]
I thought you said you ordered it.

[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:20.560]
No, somebody brought it.

[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.020]
Oh, that Roger's almond brittle, man.

[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.900]
That's some of the best stuff that will send you into orbit.

[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.500]
Okay, here's pull number one with Father's Day coming up on Sunday.

[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.820]
We've discussed this many times in the past,

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.080]
although we never get a call on it.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.060]
And why should that be different from anything else I bring up?

[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.080]
Uh, the fact is that a lot of Father's Suck, you know?

[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:36.860]
Yeah.

[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.300]
Mother's generally, if one parent is gonna be good,

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:41.240]
and the other one is gonna be bad, it's generally.

[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.340]
The mother is a better, more conscientious, more loving, more caring.

[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:49.840]
A more likable person than the father who's usually cold and distant,

[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.960]
and hostile and afraid to show his emotions.

[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.040]
You know, you know what I'm saying?

[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:53.280]
Right.

[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.180]
Of course you do.

[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:54.780]
This is true.

[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.460]
So here's the pull from now until noon,

[00:19:57.460 --> 00:19:58.520]
and then we'll put up the other one,

[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.200]
in which we're gonna build.

[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:00.220]
If we're gonna build a pool,

[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.740]
I say in the first couple hours, or at least the first hour,

[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.520]
we have something else to keep the market putt.

[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:05.300]
Keep them off the street.

[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:06.600]
Twenty-fifthotes already.

[00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:08.240]
How would you rate your parents?

[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.080]
Both great ten.

[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:10.980]
Oh, all right.

[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:11.700]
Let's hear it.

[00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.940]
Both great ten.

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:13.700]
That's excellent.

[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.780]
I feel so good for those people, don't you?

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.020]
Yeah, that's level.

[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:19.700]
Both okay, seven.

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.560]
Not great, but-

[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:21.800]
Okay.

[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.260]
Both of disaster five.

[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.860]
Mother good, father lame, one.

[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.960]
Father good, mother lame, zero.

[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:33.780]
See now, maybe I'm wrong about that.

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.620]
About the father thing.

[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.400]
Maybe it was just-

[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.940]
I don't think so.

[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:40.380]
Huh? Maybe it was just my fistful.

[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:41.400]
Although, you know what I said,

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.400]
Magnolia, every father in that movie sucked.

[00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:44.880]
Right.

[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.000]
Every one of them was a bad father.

[00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:49.100]
We had the one who was like doing the incest thing,

[00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:51.980]
and then we had the other one who was like just abandon his kid.

[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.720]
Mm-hmm.

[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.400]
And every father was a piece of crap.

[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.660]
Although, at least in the end, they died a wicked death.

[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.420]
I should say that.

[00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:01.900]
Not enough of them.

[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.280]
Here's the fact that says there's a link on Drudge today.

[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.040]
Oh, I miss Fudge.

[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.300]
An article about Ashcroft pushing Patriot Act 2

[00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.460]
and the Secret Police Empowerment Act that makes every crime including speeding,

[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.860]
maybe an act of domestic terrorism.

[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:18.800]
It also allows the Justice Department to revoke anyone's citizenship

[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.440]
and then treat them as an enemy combatant.

[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.740]
He's the most dangerous man in America.

[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:24.560]
John and Port St. Lucie says.

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:26.980]
I don't know if he talked about Miss Fudge or about John Ascroft.

[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.400]
Actually, the only reason John Ascroft is dangerous is because somebody else put him in there,

[00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.680]
which makes the president the most dangerous.

[00:21:52.700 --> 00:22:00.080]
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.560]
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.340]
You know what I'm saying.

[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.000]
Oh, here's a bunch of them for you.

[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.520]
Now, see, we're requiring you to make a choice.

[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.400]
These people, a lot of them, remind me of, like, Muff, who's sitting in the toilet, you

[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.500]
know, and he has to get on the intercom with Duff.

[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.580]
He has to call Duff on his cell phone to find out which hand to wipe with, you know?

[00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:41.100]
Who'd I say has to call Greg or himself?

[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.260]
The worst acting performance ever in a movie was, and my choice is Eli Wallach and

[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:48.060]
Godfather III.

[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:52.060]
I can't imagine a worst performance.

[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.980]
Now, I know somebody.

[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.400]
It shouldn't be me also write the other one down because it's going to be obvious.

[00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.280]
What other one?

[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:57.840]
Sophia Coppola.

[00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:59.300]
Oh, oh yeah.

[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.820]
Also in Godfather III.

[00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:04.580]
I don't know the name of the actor, but in that same movie, but he was small potato, so

[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.320]
he's like, he's been worth mentioning, so I don't know why I'm going to.

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.240]
The guy that played Anthony, the son, the opera singing son.

[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.420]
What was wrong with him?

[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.380]
He was just his brother.

[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.540]
He was only there for three-sacral identity problems.

[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:17.240]
What was wrong with him?

[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.380]
He was okay.

[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.140]
You're putting him in the same category with Sophia with a big schnauzon.

[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:23.320]
No, it was just all bad.

[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.240]
Dad, don't spend it all in one place, Dad.

[00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:27.900]
Oh, brother.

[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.760]
There's one of the worst cases of nepotism in the history of the human race.

[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.920]
Francis Ford Coppola taking all of his other brilliant work and just shoveling it right

[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.540]
down the toilet by putting his daughter in there in that role and then Eli Wallach.

[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.040]
I thought we could reason together.

[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.340]
His waving the arms around like he's got St.

[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.220]
David, every line that he said in it was like so overdone and so cornball.

[00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:50.480]
Just awful.

[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.180]
Oh, you'll leave.

[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:54.940]
You know, the thing where he's going to get in the hitman, he's having a hitman in his

[00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:55.660]
mulee son there.

[00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.340]
I love him.

[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:57.860]
He was great.

[00:23:59.160 --> 00:23:59.720]
Mulee son.

[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:01.020]
You know, the one I made the mule the year.

[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:02.860]
That's it, not bad.

[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:08.360]
1027 at 560 W2QM, the Neil Deals just keep on smoking from Tom Lehman and Joe Prieto

[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.640]

[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.020]
Why are you bastard?

[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.240]
Warning, we have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement

[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.280]
or permission from those depicted.

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.980]
It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous

[00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.560]
as possible.

[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.800]
We hope we reach that goal or at least major laugh.

[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:48.520]
On tonight's action news, Hillary, congratulations, your book is out and it's flying off the

[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:48.820]
shelf.

[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:49.580]
Thank you.

[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.520]
So when did you start having group sex?

[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.880]
30 years ago.

[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:54.920]
So who are you and Bill swinging with?

[00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.740]
Bill and Al and Chipper and I.

[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.540]
Did you know that sometimes Bill had sex with Betty White?

[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.440]
I find that absolutely unbelievable.

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.240]
I know, I just made it up.

[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:06.660]
On tonight's action news.

[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.200]
Hillary, what was your favorite place to have sex?

[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.020]
For me, love behind.

[00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:12.120]
Blackdome.

[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.700]
1032 at 560 W at QAM, maybe the Beast can get some pointers.

[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.960]
Here's our first response on a poll.

[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.580]
It looks like it's going to be pretty weak which means I could read some real good bedtime

[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.380]
stories all day today which is fine with me.

[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.940]
But the second, but the second poll will put up there from noon to two.

[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.240]
But in the meantime, we're going to try to build it in these two hours.

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.460]
But you know, maybe it'll work.

[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:29.880]
Maybe not.

[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.060]
Maybe they don't want to play the game today.

[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.200]
The fact is, Vodera can Tarzan.

[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.780]
That's Tarzan, the 8 man and I concur.

[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.500]
Okay.

[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.520]
Tarzan, the 8 man.

[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:39.820]
Vodera.

[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.160]
The worst acting performance ever in the movie was we got only three nominees so far.

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.560]
Eli Wallach and Sophia Coppola and Godfather 3.

[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.840]
Vodera can Tarzan.

[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.620]
560, 560, 0560, 0560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:56.120]
This should be a piece of cake, man.

[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.260]
It should be like 600 nominations for this.

[00:26:58.340 --> 00:26:58.680]
Don't you think?

[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000]
Yeah, but should be.

[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.500]
Well, they're just, it's Friday.

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.880]
It's to the kids around a school.

[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.440]
They're off on a busman's holiday now for whatever the reason.

[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:06.880]
Plus, we got no free tickets to give away.

[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.460]
Well, 100 votes on a poll.

[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.140]
Our first poll.

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.100]
How would you rate your parents?

[00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:11.760]
And this is good.

[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.500]
Both grade 44.

[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.880]
Both okay.

[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:15.540]
27.

[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.260]
Mother good father lame.

[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:18.120]
15.

[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.820]
Both a disaster.

[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:20.540]
10.

[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.620]
And father good mother lame only four.

[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.440]
Only four people say that their father was a good parent and their mother's sucked.

[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.260]
So far.

[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.660]
560, 7.

[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.700]
0560, 0560.

[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:34.040]
We have been aboard.

[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:37.020]
We'll get to that phone eventually where he just won't get paid on the 25th again.

[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.700]
And he won't pay George back and he'll just be like a snowballing.

[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.400]
It'll be like, oh, in the mob money, you know.

[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.560]
The company store.

[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.120]
You'll just never catch up.

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:48.800]
Oh, and let me just also mention, I should have.

[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.060]
I should have cussed his ass out.

[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:54.160]
Did I mention it when Ferrell was doing his little 20-minute crossover about the eating

[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.420]
thing?

[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.360]
I did tell him that.

[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.540]
Don't be a pussy.

[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:58.280]
Don't believe all these memos they put.

[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.760]
Oh, no food is allowed.

[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:00.600]
No smoking.

[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:01.620]
No farting.

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.240]
No talking.

[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.460]
You know, what kind of crap is that?

[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.560]
See, this is parents again.

[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.700]
Try to be a butch guy.

[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.740]
Try to push everybody around because he can't get laid because he's got a real inferiority

[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.980]
complex because he's got a penis like a little girl.

[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.360]
And therefore, no seriously, so therefore he's trying to flex his muscle and he's going

[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.720]
to show them you'll notice he doesn't include our studio in it because he knows I tell

[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.960]
him to stick it up his ass.

[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.600]
No chance, clearance.

[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.640]
And when I'm going to be there next week, in fact, maybe I'll be there for a couple of

[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.220]
weeks and it all depends on how I can handle it.

[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.020]
But if you think we're not going to be eating at least bacon or whatever we feel like at

[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:36.860]
a studio, I got news for it.

[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.180]
We're dreaming, sweetheart.

[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:39.320]
Let's have a feast.

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.420]
Yeah, an excuse being able to solve his answer on a building.

[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.340]
Well, maybe if Greg wasn't such a cheap bastard and they don't even have to spend money,

[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.200]
they could trade it out.

[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:51.480]
They could just do it for a few mentions or good, but he's Steve from ATM alternative

[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.520]
termite management.

[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.220]
Is that what it is?

[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:53.920]
That's what it is.

[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.460]
They're the best.

[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.660]
They're the best.

[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.920]
Just a few mentions, he'd come in and clean that then building out and get rid of all

[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.580]
the pests and the bugs too.

[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.420]
Work with Geldie so far.

[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.540]
Boy, that's really interesting.

[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.300]
That's a pretty, uh, going to keep our eye on that.

[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.320]
On that Geldie situation, he might be bailing.

[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.680]
Here's Miami.

[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.020]
Hello.

[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.640]
Hello, this is a really so cool.

[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:15.240]
How you doing?

[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:15.980]
Okay.

[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:16.940]
What?

[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.940]
I have a 10, 10 father for, for, for a month.

[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:20.960]
Okay, great.

[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.100]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:27.000]
And Verizon wireless.

[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.040]
What kind of stories will you be sharing with us today?

[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:29.940]
A whole bunch of them.

[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.900]
It looks like many.

[00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.160]
Here's Kendall.

[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:32.520]
Hello.

[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:34.480]
This is so name.

[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:36.280]
Oh, Jesus Christ.

[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.820]
Yeah, lame is the word, man.

[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.460]
That's you.

[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.100]
Look at the mirror.

[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:39.660]
Lame.

[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.700]
This is what happens when they got no material.

[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.900]
When they have nothing to bring.

[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.520]
And they make it so easy for a man.

[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.780]
And he's doing a little megaphone thing again.

[00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:54.420]
Let me say it again.

[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.320]
You're there every minute of every day.

[00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:59.500]
As full as you think that there's anybody stupid enough to buy into your crowd.

[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:00.360]
Of course not.

[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.380]
Because after they hear the, it doesn't even make any difference what the words are that follow.

[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:05.360]
It's just a sound.

[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.620]
The sound of the God damn Campbell soup cannon from your ugly poest.

[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:09.860]
Man.

[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:12.580]
Get some freaking material as whole.

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:14.400]
Here's Miami.

[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:14.740]
Hello.

[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.680]
Hey, Neil.

[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:16.780]
What about the North?

[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.820]
He's the worst actor in the world.

[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.620]
I don't know the name of any of his movies, but he.

[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.240]
Who is it?

[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:23.360]
Chuck Norris.

[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:23.700]
The Crow.

[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.580]
Chuck Norris.

[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:24.940]
Yeah.

[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.580]
Yeah, he was the worst.

[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:26.980]
No.

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.080]
No, you're not listening to me.

[00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:29.880]
You don't understand the pull.

[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.700]
Not the worst actor or the worst actress.

[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.460]
The worst acting performance ever in a movie.

[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.940]
Yeah, he's a kid.

[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:36.920]
He's a nutcative.

[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:37.200]

[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:38.480]
Yeah.

[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.280]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.360]
Ha ha ha.

[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.740]
You know something that one guy was right long ago.

[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:46.540]
He was right.

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.200]
Make it simple.

[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.140]
Paper or plastic, you know.

[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.400]
Jesus Christ.

[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.340]
It wouldn't matter.

[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:56.960]
It's just amazing.

[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:58.020]
It's shocking to me.

[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.020]
It is shocking.

[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:03.060]
And you wonder why South Florida is the intellectual toilet that it is.

[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.360]
In fact, it makes that toilet in trans spotting look lovely by comparison.

[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:10.860]
Look appetizing.

[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.240]
Oh, well, we don't understand why you wouldn't want to be here all the time.

[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:16.380]
Neil, it's such a paradise.

[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound.

[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:21.000]
We still don't have one on the phone yet.

[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:21.260]
Do we?

[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.920]
Don't we have the one that came in on the facts machine?

[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:23.780]
And that's it.

[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.800]
Well, this is good at this rate.

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.400]
If I bought four four into 30 this afternoon, we might have like five or six.

[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:31.840]
How would you rate your parents?

[00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:32.460]
Both great.

[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.620]
And this is because Father's Day of Summit.

[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:35.900]
This is just something to kill some time.

[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:36.200]
Okay.

[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.400]
128 votes.

[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.380]
Both great 60.

[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:39.660]
Both okay 33.

[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:42.240]
Mother good, Father lame 18.

[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.320]
Both of disaster 12.

[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.220]
And mother, Father good, and mother lame only five.

[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.840]
Following that and keeping track of those.

[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.560]
We're learning a majority.

[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:52.420]
I'm a minority.

[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:53.120]
Quite a minority.

[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:54.280]
What do you mean we?

[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.300]
Not now you're going to tell the audience how we voted.

[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.420]
Both lame.

[00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:00.940]
When my mother is listening to the show and probably is too.

[00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.880]
Does your mother listen?

[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.360]
Well, she has a spy that reports due to the late.

[00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:06.540]
Well, guess what spy?

[00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:07.460]
George said your lame.

[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.620]
Your lame mom.

[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:09.940]
Your mama.

[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.000]
Eat to mama.

[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:11.480]
Tambien.

[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.420]
That's right.

[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:13.600]
Here's Miami.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:13.920]
Hello.

[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:15.600]
Hello.

[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.380]
Yes, sir.

[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.840]
Yeah, I was calling for a suggestion for the worst acting performance.

[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:20.640]
Okay.

[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.460]
The kid who played young Darth Vader in this most recent Star Wars movie with the album.

[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.000]
He didn't work.

[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.620]
Oh, you're picking on poor Hayden Chris.

[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.540]
It was the first one.

[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:31.720]
The little one.

[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:37.720]
Well, he was bad too, but this last one was the most nonmenacing person I've ever seen in my life.

[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:38.180]
Both of them.

[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.640]
I don't have trouble choosing.

[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:40.420]
Yeah, he did.

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.700]
He was a little light in the loafers.

[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.280]
Hayden, he was pretty, but he was light.

[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.560]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pali.

[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:45.200]
Bye.

[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.060]
Now, what is Star Wars?

[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.320]
What?

[00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.720]
I don't know the second one.

[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.640]
I'm trying to block it out of my head.

[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760]
Episode two.

[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:53.680]
Star Wars two.

[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:53.980]
Okay.

[00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:55.220]
Hayden Christian, Pali.

[00:32:55.440 --> 00:33:01.280]
He's not in a pretty little Hayden Christian, so he's pretty, but he was a little bit of a fortune in that movie.

[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:06.560]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.400]
Who was the worst actress in history?

[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.480]
That's our pull question today.

[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:10.840]
Isn't it?

[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:14.880]
Who was the worst newscaster next to David Brinkley?

[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:18.360]
Boy, they sure went whole-hob on Adidas.

[00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:19.640]
Did you see that all the networks?

[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:21.000]
Not just on the CNN.

[00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:21.580]
Yeah.

[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:23.380]
And what's it called?

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.920]
I was having to even watch King No Mo.

[00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:25.620]
Uh-huh.

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.140]
Because I don't watch CNN.

[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.480]
I refused to watch it.

[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.740]
My microwave oven was showing highlights of David Brinkley.

[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:31.900]
Yeah, he was all over the place.

[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:32.600]
Good night, Chet.

[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:33.380]
Good night, Chet.

[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:34.080]
He kept saying it.

[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:34.500]
Good night, Chet.

[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.600]
I mean, I liked David Brinkley, okay?

[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.440]
And of course, he got that thing with that archer Daniels Midland.

[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.900]
Remember that big scandal about that?

[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:44.000]
Got into kind of a kind.

[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.860]
And then all of a sudden, very shortly thereafter, he vanished from our TV screens, never to return.

[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.180]
I thought it was good when he was on Sunday mornings on this week.

[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.960]
At least he counterbalanced that obnoxious George Will and the anxious San Donaldson and at nasty herpes that kept sliding around.

[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:06.180]
But then once his eyeball, that left eyeball started to slide down on it, was cheeked during his closing when he started yuking it up during those commentaries.

[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:08.940]
I think that's when he decided that was time to ship him off to the farm.

[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.440]
Poor David.

[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.600]
David Brinkley is dead.

[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:12.620]
It's a close of a great chapter in American Newsmen.

[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.560]
When we still have like real news people, I know that comes the shock audio punks out there.

[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:21.860]
We used to have like real news people on here like Chet Humbly and David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite, John Chancellor.

[00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.700]
And John Cameron Swazie, it takes a lickin' and keeps on ticking just like the beast.

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.340]
1040, 20 to 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.240]
Let me tell you about something you ought to be lickin' right now.

[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:34.700]

Plus there are 14 different ol' you might formula to choose from each one combining.

[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.580]
Farmaceutical grade olive oil with vitamins, minerals, and herbals.

[00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.960]
This supports specific health needs.

[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.060]
From your bones, to your blood pressure, to your immune system.

[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.520]
All you do is just pick out the formulas that I'm right for you and pop it every day.

[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.920]
Right in the old poos.

[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.740]
And now you got three new olio-meda formulas.

[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:13.040]
One to help your sleep, one to help you control your weight, and cell Q10, which contains coq10 for your heart.

[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.820]
Pick some up while you're doin' your shop in a day because it's all over town.

[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:21.540]
Pick up olio-meda, publics, records, wall greens, whole food markets, nvarros, and sadanos, order it online, if you like.

[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:43.380]
My, my, and local, I'm your sports radio five-sixies, you a-c-u-a-m.

[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.140]
Holy s**t dude.

[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:55.760]
From the network that brought you NBC, C-N-B-C, and MSNBC, comes the greatest channel in the history of broadcasting.

[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:05.300]
Vs-NBC, tonight at A-B-M on softwall, Phytos Press Secretary R.A. Flasher tells Vs-NBC why the mush-tax cut will actually help poor people.

[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:12.920]
Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge will show you how duct tape and plastic sheeting will keep you 100% safe from chemical and biological attacks.

[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:19.920]
Then, at 9, Vs-NBC investigates, brings you an exclusive interview with Scott Peterson who'll prove he's totally innocent.

[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:25.920]
Remittain Ryan Williams and a panel of absolute geniuses, blow the lid off the Sars hoax.

[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.800]
And later, your wife will tell you that it happens to every guy and size does it matter.

[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:36.780]
All this, a-s-I'm-as in the morning. On the most watched, most busted, most defendable, most honest, new channel in the history of journalism.

[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:38.580]
Vs-NBC.

[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:43.740]
1045, you need a search party to find MSNBC's audience, let's hear that right now. Is Donnie Houston on there?

[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:46.780]
How about that great new show with Jesse Ventura that started yet?

[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.420]
How about, uh, what's his name? Who's that fat-headed guy that had on a fiber clock?

[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:57.600]
That awful newspaper guy that, uh, Jerry, uh, Jerry the dead guy.

[00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.160]
Oh, I think he died or something, he's gone.

[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:05.140]
And now, they really, to show you the desperation, not only they put these right wingers on, they got that Keith Overnon man.

[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:11.980]
He make-he gives me spielkeys, man. This is the guy who takes himself very seriously, who's made a career out of picking himself seriously.

[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:16.700]
And he was on ESPN, they blew him off, and he was on MSNBC, they blew him off.

[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.780]
Anyway, the fox in they blew him off. Now he's back on MSNBC with his point to share whatever he's got. Keith Overnon.

[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.640]
He talks in a very serious voice, like he's- he really believes he's gonna change the world.

[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:29.620]
Like he's gonna- he's got all the answers, he's gonna solve the problems for the world.

[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:33.340]
And you just look at him and you laugh at him. He's a silly person. He's a sports nerd.

[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:42.340]
It would be like- it would be like clearance going on CNN to solve the problems with the road map in the Middle East.

[00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.520]
See what I'm saying? What do you say?

[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.860]
Oh, here's the good news. No, no WHO travel advisory for Toronto.

[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:55.080]
They were peeing into their pants here about that, you know, because of that one exported case to Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.640]
That'll teach that guy who came up here. Don't be coming up here and visiting people in hospitals and nursing homes.

[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:05.260]
You asshole. Jesus Christ. Then he goes back and infects a couple of his coworkers.

[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.800]
That'll teach you. You idiot. God.

[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:13.300]
Hey, don't forget, join Joe Costello today from Noondil II at the Verizon Wireless.

[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:18.700]
At 329 Arthur Gottfried Road, Mami Beach, stop by to win our usual low-of-budget QA and prizes.

[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:21.640]
And some Marlon tickets. Wow, what an incentive that is, huh?

[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.840]
Joe Costello, our close personal buddy, Noondil II today at Verizon Wireless.

[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:29.720]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hello.

[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.960]
Yes, sir. Neil. Yes.

[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.800]
Worst performance, Darrell Hannah in the band.

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.900]
Clant of the Bayer or something like that. Clant of the Cave Bear.

[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.960]
Yeah. Yeah. Terrible.

[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:42.720]
Clant of the Cave Bear?

[00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:45.340]
Yes. Darrell Hannah.

[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:50.280]
Okay, we got you down, pal. Thanks a lot. Sounds fishy to me.

[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:54.720]
I like Darrell Hannah, but that doesn't mean she couldn't put in a bad performance.

[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:59.480]
Well, it was so long ago I can't even remember. She was probably better in the bathtub.

[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:04.720]
She was fine in that movie. It's just that that movie was just her, her acting was,

[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:10.500]
that was the dialogue. What was it again?

[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:20.300]
Oh, man, since your ATM card, Guttie, and you just have been the same, you know,

[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.460]
between, between not getting paid on payday and then in the same week like a couple of days later,

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.200]
the machine eats his ATM card because his bank is a piece of crap.

[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.320]
So the little money is again, make Atlantic, they suck.

[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.040]
All the banks and stuff, Florida suck.

[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:31.680]
Oh, yeah.

[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.680]
And especially, watch over your money, bank man, they make me puke.

[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.060]
God, are they bad?

[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:41.120]
It's like they're all having a contest with each other to see how little service they can give you,

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.080]
how they can screw you over and make your life miserable and keep bouncing your checks

[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.140]
and screwing up your deposits and eating your ATM cards.

[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:49.540]
And just, just in general, making your life a piece of crap.

[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.640]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:54.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.100]
Yeah, you got an?

[00:39:58.540 --> 00:39:59.300]
I beg your pardon?

[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:00.120]
You got an?

[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.520]
No, I don't have any an, they got an an in the studio.

[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:07.480]
An an in the studio. I want to send you some free samples of the great ant faith that it's not a poison to people.

[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:08.180]
Yeah.

[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:13.520]
No, well, listen, send us some that's not a poison, then send us some other ones that mark them up that are a poison.

[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:14.520]
We'll put them in most studio.

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.460]
Good deal.

[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:17.480]
You going to send it?

[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.100]
I'm going to send it, Gabby. Have you got to give me your address?

[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:21.120]
Okay, hang on a second.

[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.620]
Okay, give that guy as a raise free, so we'll take it.

[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.140]
Okay, Greg, we'll be having to take that.

[00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:27.040]
If it costs us any money, we won't do it.

[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.700]
I mean, you talk about cheap. Come on.

[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.520]
How many times have I talked about that?

[00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.040]
Not only are there ants in there, but there are like little things.

[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:35.720]
There are about a half a dozen different kinds of creatures flying.

[00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:38.160]
Some have wings, some have legs, some have, you know,

[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:43.620]
every kind of insect that's ever been invented is flying around an adult building because they're too cheap.

[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.420]
First of all, the building is a toilet.

[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.200]
The elevator is a joke.

[00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.200]
I think they had to bribe somebody to get this certificate in there to approve it.

[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.740]
Everything in there is a goddamn joke.

[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.200]
And then we can't get an exterminator when they're even for a couple of trade-outs spots.

[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.400]
What this kind of goes to show you, the kind of a concern Greg has for the people that work there.

[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.360]
It's in none.

[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.300]
Which is why in the beginning, you guys were in a trailer and at the condemn of a trailer.

[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.320]
I'll never forget that day.

[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.360]
I went in there to pick you up to take you down to a kindle Toyota.

[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.440]
And I'd walk in that place and I look around.

[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:16.040]
I thought, you know what that place reminded me of?

[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.900]
The toilet in train spotting.

[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.460]
And all of that building reminded me of.

[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.300]
In fact, I wouldn't have taken a crap in that building.

[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.240]
That's how that was.

[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:25.500]
Seriously, when you walk into a place and you say,

[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:30.460]
this place looks so filthy and so grotesque, I wouldn't take a crap in here, then you know.

[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.800]
That's what it was.

[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:34.900]
We had carpeting on the walls and there was mold and mildew growing in it.

[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.920]
And then, then I remember before starting at QA,

[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.400]
a normal camp brings me in here to take the tour of the QA and build it.

[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.360]
And the walls are stained and a carpeting looked like people had mungled all over

[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:48.440]
like there'd been like series of orgies on them.

[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.380]
And we're just disgusting.

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.280]
Yeah, all mail.

[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.800]
And that's Greg Reed.

[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:57.240]
Look, I've told you many times I'd sure hate to see what the inside of his house looked like.

[00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.460]
Here's a whole bunch of fashions.

[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:03.800]
Let's say you said bad acting and the first name that popped up was Vin Diesel for a fast and furious.

[00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.020]
It said, I'm sure someone is worse, but that's what I got to see.

[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.260]
Well, what's wrong with that Vin Diesel?

[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:09.760]
Nothing.

[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:10.400]
I'll write this.

[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.540]
I'm writing it down.

[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.540]
I don't have to write these.

[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:12.800]
Do I?

[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.120]
No.

[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:13.760]
No.

[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:13.820]

[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:14.160]
No.

[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.220]
That's a tough question.

[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:16.220]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.140]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:17.320]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:17.320]

[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:17.360]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:17.440]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:17.700]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.220]
Why do I write them down?

[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:20.060]
Here's one from Joe.

[00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:21.740]
I don't understand.

[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.040]
I can't think of the title of the movie.

[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.760]
Dolly Parton tries to teach Slice the Loan to be a country singer.

[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:26.160]
Right.

[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:27.380]
What is it?

[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:28.080]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:29.400]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.020]
The vote is Slice the Loan in Rhyne Stone.

[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:32.640]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:32.700]

[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.420]
Cowboy, wasn't it?

[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.820]
Am I going to have to look this up?

[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:37.480]
I'll look it up.

[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.800]
I can do a quick search.

[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:46.740]
Slice.

[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:49.820]
Stallone.

[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:51.400]
I can handle it.

[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.720]
I got my computer over here.

[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:55.100]
I can type in the stick it up my nose.

[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:58.220]
So that's just the law.

[00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:58.820]
Here you go.

[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:00.920]
Come on.

[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.660]
It's only a four-hour free-con show.

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:03.780]
We don't have a ball game today.

[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.040]
But that Marlon game yesterday, that kill us or what?

[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:06.660]
Wow.

[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:08.420]
That was shocking.

[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.580]
Slice the Loan.

[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:12.920]
Okay.

[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.620]
You want to know all the names of his movies?

[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:15.160]
No.

[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:17.620]
Oh, Shade Taxi 3.

[00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:18.220]
Liberty's kids.

[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:19.080]
What's the one we're looking for?

[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:20.140]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:21.960]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:22.520]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.040]
Rocky V.

[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.200]
Tango and Cash Rambo 3.

[00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:26.460]
Nighthawks.

[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:27.280]
Victory Flitters.

[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.040]
Rhyne Stone.

[00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:28.760]
That's the name of the movie.

[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.680]
I stay corrected.

[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:30.720]
Asshole.

[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:31.240]
I thought you were stupid.

[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.320]
See, I had to waste all of that time.

[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:35.940]
The audience is probably pissed off at Carlos now too, because I had to waste all of that time

[00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.920]
because you would listen to your...

[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:38.100]
See, one thing about Beener Boy.

[00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.480]
You know something.

[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.380]
He knows better.

[00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:44.440]
No matter what it is, if you know, just like with poor Eric up there, who's probably having a nervous breakdown?

[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.200]
Well, I had looked it up a lot faster than you were.

[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.520]
Eric was an expert computer nerd, but I hate Beener Boy.

[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.880]
He's a better computer nerd.

[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:53.340]
As long as we all understand that we'll get along just fine.

[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:53.700]
Okay.

[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:54.880]
And let me ask you this.

[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.980]
Is there a squirrely ammo up there yet?

[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.620]
Well, what do you want up first, the stories are the squirrel.

[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:02.480]
Both.

[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.360]
Or the pole.

[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:04.840]
You can take it on the pole.

[00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.440]
I'm doing the stories.

[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.320]
What do you mean you're taking down the pole?

[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.160]
What do you mean you're taking down the pole?

[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.460]
He's writing it.

[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.940]
I'm writing down the suggestions.

[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.360]
I thought you were taking down the pole.

[00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.800]
It's supposed to be up there till noon, in which case you had gotten probably fired.

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.600]
How would you rate your parents?

[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.880]
186 votes already.

[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:21.960]
Both great 89.

[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.300]
Let's share it for those people.

[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.180]
I am so jealous of those people who I like.

[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:25.800]
Two good parents.

[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.720]
They're one of the so much better adjusted than I am.

[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.200]
And then George, wow.

[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.480]
Yeah, we are.

[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.820]
Both okay, 41.

[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.660]
Mother good father lame 27.

[00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:37.940]
See, I think this is making my point because father good mother lame only eight.

[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:38.440]
Right.

[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.080]
Oh, I agree.

[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.500]
And both a disaster 21.

[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:43.580]
Oh, geez.

[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:44.960]
So 48 56.

[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:51.740]
So 56 out of 186, which is about 30% about 30% who've had the parent problems.

[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:52.640]
Well, you know, not everybody.

[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.500]
I think people should have a license not to get married, but to be a parent.

[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.200]
Yes.

[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.280]
Oh, yes.

[00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:58.740]
Because not everybody should be a parent.

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:01.420]
Yeah, almost anybody can make a baby, but that's not the trick.

[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:01.800]
Okay.

[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.320]
Making a baby even monkeys can do that.

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:04.680]
Okay.

[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.360]
Even gerbals can do that.

[00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:11.880]
But being a parent, being a responsible loving, caring, thinking parent, that requires a license.

[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:12.840]
Out of the allow.

[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:13.580]
Right.

[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.540]
Plus, unless you look pretty good.

[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.200]
You know, who's got beautiful kids?

[00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:19.820]
Who the hell was that?

[00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:20.940]
I forget who that was.

[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:25.080]
Somebody on the other night, the on biography has just unbelievably good looking kids.

[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.600]
It'll come back to me.

[00:45:27.140 --> 00:45:27.760]
I was shocked.

[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.240]
And oh, I know who it was.

[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.360]
It was Jose Santos, the jocky.

[00:45:32.460 --> 00:45:34.720]
His wife is unbelievably beautiful.

[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.840]
He's got a kid as son and a daughter and they're just knockout.

[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.920]
They're just beautiful kids.

[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:41.800]
It sounds a little bit young for a Carlos.

[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.920]
That's certainly a really beautiful family.

[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:48.000]
And I sure didn't come from Jose with all the apologies of him.

[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.540]
And we're sorry to him in the triple crown.

[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.940]
Worth acting performance ever, Shaquille O'Neal and Kazam.

[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:54.620]
Got it?

[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:56.180]
Shaquille O'Neal or anything.

[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:57.880]
Well, there you go.

[00:45:58.060 --> 00:45:59.260]
We got something specific.

[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.640]
It's time for another Shaquet test.

[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:02.240]
Hey!

[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.720]
Kristen and Lentanis.

[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.700]
We're getting this going now.

[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.700]
They're finally catching on.

[00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:07.480]
They're not all as stupid as a couple of more.

[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.180]
Like that mouth breather.

[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.820]
Oh, Jesus.

[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.780]
I'd like to get a goddamn baseball bat.

[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:14.880]
You know, my last show.

[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.640]
The last show that I do.

[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:18.560]
I'd like to get a baseball bat.

[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.840]
With or without corking it.

[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.520]
And just line those bastards up.

[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.560]
You know the ones I'm talking about.

[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.220]
Oh, magnificent.

[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:25.100]
Doesn't.

[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:26.340]
Just a dozen of, right?

[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.860]
And just beat the snot out of every one of them.

[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.320]
That did.

[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.180]
Oh, man.

[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.240]
What a great way that would be to go out.

[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.780]
Oh, we're getting excited.

[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:36.880]
Be excited.

[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:37.740]
Be be excited.

[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.180]
Kristen and Lentanis.

[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.740]
My, my suggestion is Nicholas Cage in Moonstruck.

[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.280]
She says I wanted to cut off his other hand

[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.940]
and maybe some other appendages as well.

[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:48.640]
Oi.

[00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:50.040]
Thanks, Kristen.

[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.220]
You got a down to close cage.

[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:51.940]
I don't like him.

[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:52.980]
Never saw that movie though.

[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.100]
Oh, I don't like him.

[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:55.200]
There's just something about him.

[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.220]
I don't think he's a good actor.

[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:56.700]
He looks.

[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:58.400]
There's something about the way he is.

[00:46:58.420 --> 00:46:59.500]
His whole ambiance and appearance.

[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.760]
He just bugs me.

[00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.700]
Can you think of one good movie he has been in?

[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:03.600]
Leaving Las Vegas.

[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.180]
Okay.

[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.860]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.780]
Pound 5, 60 on a 18.

[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.360]
See, I'm, I'm going to step all over you if you try to say any.

[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.980]
Because already for well talk about the first 80 minutes of the show.

[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:14.600]
Which is fine.

[00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.320]
But boy, he, he's like a, he's like a machine.

[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:17.820]
Right.

[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:20.620]
He's just like a talking, squeaking, grappling machine.

[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.320]
Just wind him up.

[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:22.880]
He just, ah.

[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.800]
So if I was more, I'd be real nervous now if Geldy doesn't show no more.

[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:32.580]
Because once for well starts moving down that territory,

[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.420]
I won't get in there.

[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.240]
Nothing edge wise.

[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.840]
And then he'll start going back and up till about 3 30 in the morning.

[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:39.020]
Here's a call in four lottery.

[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.360]
Hello.

[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:40.980]
Hey, what's up?

[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:41.760]
How you doing, sir?

[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.180]
Hey, did you get my pictures?

[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:43.800]
I sent you?

[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:45.480]
Of what?

[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.400]
I think that's the, ah, squirrely picture of Mao and Mao and Geldy.

[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:51.900]
And then one of you was the Neil God.

[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.380]
Oh, they, those came from you.

[00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:54.300]
Well, thank you so much.

[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:55.020]
Yes, I did get them.

[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.980]
And they're all a beautiful thing.

[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:56.820]
Okay.

[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:57.760]
Now, I'm not sure.

[00:47:57.860 --> 00:48:00.240]
I have another one of the Neil God that's an X-ray the version.

[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.120]
I don't know if you want that.

[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.580]
I've photoshopped out a particular thing for you.

[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.460]
Why do you consent to us?

[00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.480]
We won't put it on your website because we don't want no X-ray to crap on our website.

[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:09.640]
I figured that you didn't.

[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.020]
That's why I did that particular version.

[00:48:11.100 --> 00:48:13.580]
But I don't know if you had to hang that picture up somewhere in the studio just for fun.

[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:14.100]
Okay.

[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.000]
Well, the squirrelymo is going on a website as of a little later today and we appreciate it very much.

[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.600]
Oh, actually, I've said new more stuff.

[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.260]
I got a lot of time to waste today.

[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.060]
He always said that he had swinging nuts and I think he had a point.

[00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.580]
Well, if he is, he has a squirrel on top of his head too, so I figured that's a double entendreter.

[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:28.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:29.380]
Thanks, Pally.

[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:30.500]
Take it easy, man.

[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:31.020]
See ya.

[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.200]
I was that up there yet or not.

[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:33.260]
Get in there.

[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:39.420]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:43.560]
Although, as much as I like the Mozo and Squirrelymo, I think the ass that I have,

[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:45.660]
is just, you know, a...

[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:47.320]
Beautiful thing.

[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.240]
My, my, my and loco.

[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.500]
This is Sports Radio 560.

[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.760]
You, A-M.

[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:59.740]
Radio weekend on 560 WQ-A-M.

[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.740]
New from Ronco, the burry Manlo Bedroom GPS and Compass.

[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.860]
Never get lost in your own bedroom again.

[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:12.360]
Your burry Manlo Bedroom GPS and Compass will lock on the six strategically located satellites maintained by the US Government

[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.300]
and will warn you before you walk into your walls.

[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.580]
How could you possibly survive without it?

[00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.960]
Imagine never having to use your own sense of direction again.

[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.000]
You can stop using your brain completely

[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.360]
and still find your way through your own house.

[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.880]
The very Manalo Bedroom GPS and Compass from RUNCO.

[00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.680]
Don't stay home without it.

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:33.180]
It's 1101 at 560 WQAM.

[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.500]
We got the mad dog at 2.

[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.780]
From Hooters and Pemberpines, you got to Humber at 4.

[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.080]
Full three hours today, Hank.

[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:40.620]
Everybody assignment.

[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:41.720]
4 to 7.

[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.580]
That was probably...

[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.820]
7 o'clock, you got QAM Rewound, the best of QM.

[00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.760]
To kill a half an hour, because we got no Crow, no Mo.

[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.800]
He's over on a competition.

[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.360]
On the stiff competition, Marlon's on deck 730.

[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:53.000]
Marlon's at the Texas Rangers.

[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.420]
With a $25 million man, it's him.

[00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.400]
It's like about 100 games under 500.

[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.680]
Man, looks like last place for Texas again.

[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.960]
It's your Marlon's at the Rangers 805 tonight.

[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.500]
Fomored by the 80K show and ESPN radio overnight

[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.640]
because we get it for free.

[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.340]
Now, you're keeping a list so I can't...

[00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:11.760]
Because this is the list that's going to go up and noon

[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.860]
and I really boxed myself into a corner.

[00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:15.040]
But that's okay because you can read them.

[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:15.740]
We can read them.

[00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.620]
Before we speak of a Viking read them,

[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.480]
I guess we have to address a fax or a notorious fax around the year

[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:22.760]
because I can't fax back to them.

[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.340]
And they're very well intended.

[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.520]
They fax like 20 pages at a time.

[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:30.840]
None of this fax is our legible at all ever.

[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.460]
And they're just constantly faxing all day long.

[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.180]
So the person...

[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.180]
What is he faxing about?

[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.200]
Well, about anything and everything.

[00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:38.520]
But the last fax that he just said,

[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:39.920]
acting performances by musicians

[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.160]
and they've got a whole list here of really bad

[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:43.600]
acting performances by musicians.

[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.640]
By musicians?

[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:45.840]
By musicians.

[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.120]
In other words, like Brittany, people that are musicians

[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.000]
that become actors.

[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:49.920]
You mean like Jelo?

[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.060]
For example.

[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.200]
Anyway, this...

[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:53.480]
So this person knows who they are.

[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:54.900]
I tried to fax back.

[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:55.720]
You know who you are.

[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.400]
Leave us alone.

[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:57.660]
Quote wasting our fax paper.

[00:50:57.940 --> 00:50:58.480]
We can't read any of them.

[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.740]
We can't read any part of it from this person.

[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.060]
Go on and meet you a new toner.

[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.300]
Go steal one somewhere.

[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:04.680]
Just stop faxing place.

[00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.100]
Schmuck.

[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.160]
Okay, the worst acting performance ever in a movie was

[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:09.880]
Eli Wallet, Godfather 3.

[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.160]
Sophia Coppola, Godfather 3.

[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:12.940]
Dad.

[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.180]
Dad.

[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:15.400]
Dad.

[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.140]
Dad.

[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.940]
A Bo Derek Tarzan,

[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.600]
Hayden Christiansen, Star Wars 2, I like them.

[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.840]
Oh, he was kind of like, I don't know.

[00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.400]
He might have been a little on the fruity side.

[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:27.620]
Darryl Hannah,

[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.360]
clan of the cave bear.

[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.220]
And that's as far as I got out.

[00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.180]
And you've got the rest of them.

[00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:33.880]
Right.

[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.700]
What are they?

[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.800]
I'm not a boarder Darryl Hannah,

[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.520]
clan of the cave bear.

[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.560]
Nicholas Cage, moon struck.

[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.260]
Tom Hanks, Joe versus the volcano.

[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:41.960]
Right.

[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:43.700]
And Van Diesel for what?

[00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:45.860]
Van Diesel for the fast and the furious.

[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:46.580]
What did I call it?

[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:47.320]
Van.

[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:48.200]
Van.

[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:48.360]

[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.320]
Diesel van.

[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.380]
Diesel van for the fascist of what?

[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:54.260]
Of Eastwick.

[00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:54.900]
The fascist.

[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:55.100]
Okay.

[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.040]
So us are still on an rying stone.

[00:51:58.800 --> 00:51:59.200]
Yo.

[00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.440]
And Shaquille O'Neal and Kazam.

[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:02.960]
Shaq for a chasier.

[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.040]
We're not too big in this shack, okay?

[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:08.660]
I'm very upset that Joe versus the volcano made her not to this list.

[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:09.260]
Why is that?

[00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:10.220]
Is that one of your favorites?

[00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.600]
That's one of my, I'm embarrassed to say

[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:16.140]
it's one of my favorite cheesy movies.

[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.720]
I see it was as good as kids.

[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.160]
I don't know.

[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.780]
Well, actually, no, kids is the one that I have seen.

[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:23.620]
Better than bully?

[00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:26.080]
That one, I don't know.

[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.540]
That's George, that's one of his favorites.

[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:29.640]
Here's a call from broken, hello?

[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:30.360]
Hi, Neil.

[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.360]
Yes sir. Hi, how are you? Great. Just called with the choice for the poll. Okay.

[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:42.440]
Keanu Reeves the Matrix. Okay. All right. I almost anything you would have followed Keanu Reeves with. I'm sure we'd all agree.

[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:48.760]
This is actually a good movie despite him. Okay. Thanks a lot, Pat. I think I'm kind of stood out. We got you down. All right. Thanks a lot.

[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.980]
Keanu Reeves, man. He couldn't act as wet of a paper-freaking sack, you know what?

[00:52:53.540 --> 00:53:00.180]
Whoa. If we're going to put Keanu Reeves, I mean point break. I'm an FBI agent.

[00:53:01.300 --> 00:53:09.920]
But Keanu and Dangerous Leazons. Whoa. What for sake or not saying, dude. Yeah. And don't forget the one that I just watched, which you didn't see because it's a

[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.920]
Fag movie that when that's why he's in it on my own private Idaho.

[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:22.080]
Very, very lame. Just lame. Awful. In fact, the whole movie is pretty awful, but River Penis. See, they write about how good

[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:28.100]
River Penis was in that movie. It's not that he was so good. It's that Keanu Reeves was so bad. Hollywood, community college is

[00:53:28.100 --> 00:53:34.400]
proud to present act like a pro. Yes, with our act like a pro workshops, you can learn the techniques of your

[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:42.080]
favorite Hollywood stars and how to duplicate their success. This week our special instructor, Keanu Reeves. Yes, Keanu Reeves can

[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:51.460]
teach you all the range of emotions from excited. Excellent. To fight. Happy to depress and even startle.

[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:57.400]
I know come. Plus, he'll also teach you how to speak in a foreign accent. I go to the cost of rock.

[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:03.940]
You're on. So, no, and this week in Hollywood community college for your special guest lecturer, Keanu Reeves. And you too will be saying.

[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:12.160]
You know, he must have administered a lot of oral in order to get to where he is today. No doubt it. And maybe anal as well.

[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:17.000]
So there you go, Beast. There's a guy to guy to the top. All of quite frankly, you looked a little bit better than the Beast.

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:23.280]
I had a laugh this morning when I guess he's trying to like, you know, be nice to him. Maybe he's trying to like psychoanalyze the kid a little bit.

[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:31.500]
When Ferrell was talking about the Beast, you know, being fat, everybody's making fun of how fat he is. And about that's his personality. That's what makes him so great.

[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:39.660]
Is this because a little round tub of crap, you know what I'm saying? No. Which is probably a way of encouraging to keep eating and maybe like,

[00:54:39.660 --> 00:54:44.720]
he can get a new producer or something like that. But we'll find out in time because this some momentous stuff

[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:49.960]
happening with that most show again, it just keeps it's always in the state of flux. You notice always in the state of flux.

[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:55.580]
Never comes down to the ground ever since Greg's true, but a morning show. It's never quite come back down and hit the ground.

[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:02.780]
Here's our pool number one. It'll be up there this hour and then that noon. No, we put up the other one. How would you rate your parents?

[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:08.960]
Father's Day is this Sunday. Here's a chance for people with really crappy father's defense. Or both.

[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:14.460]
How would you rate your parents? Both grade 115 49 and a half percent said I have great parents.

[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.540]
Oh, and that doesn't it just tug of your heartstrings? Yeah.

[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:28.640]
Both okay 50. Mother was good or is good father lame 32. Both of the disaster 26. Father good mother lame nine.

[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:33.960]
So you see that 32 to nine where they thought the mother was a good parent but the father's suck was a piece of crap.

[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:37.300]
Cold, this did obnoxious disgusting walking ice cube.

[00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:43.440]
Yeah, that should have been my father's nickname Mr. Warmth.

[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:51.140]
Man. 232 votes on there not too shabby in the first hour. Don't forget Jo and Joe Costello noon to two today.

[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:57.120]
Verizon wireless 329 Arthur got he wrote on the beach and he just wants to see it because we don't have a lot for it.

[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:02.580]
We got some of our usual low budget QM prizes and some Marlon tickets. No, everybody's giving away Marlon tickets for

[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:04.500]
all everybody else. Anybody want them? No.

[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:11.700]
5 6 7 I mean if ever there was a case of trying to force feed something to the public that they don't want that's it.

[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.160]
Panther tickets and Marlon tickets.

[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.420]
If we had some dolphin tickets then you'd see the phones go crazy. Then you'd see people like lining up at the door.

[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.260]
We'll take them. Oh, I'd speak into that.

[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.360]
Now I'm kind of curious is a beenaboy there are you a football fan?

[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.880]
Yes, I am. Are you a dolphin? Yes, I am.

[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.380]
Because I have those will be coming probably in the next month or two.

[00:56:33.960 --> 00:56:39.100]
I would imagine my dolphin season tickets and the last couple of years of the row I've given them to a Joe Costello.

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:44.720]
But I was thinking about this the other day since Bonerboy does so much work there and we don't have you know.

[00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:48.760]
When you think absolutely. I mean Joe love Joe.

[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:54.020]
Well, I love Joe. Joe's a good friend. I like Joe Costello. Well, he calls up here every once in a while to see how I'm doing.

[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:59.420]
I'm a little bit but I think really Joe is huh we have to grease our own wheels.

[00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:04.940]
We got to grease our own guys. I'm pretty greasy as it is but that's what the beast said this morning.

[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.640]
That was unbelievable. That was I mean what a line that was. I think he wants it. You know something I think he's getting excited about it.

[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.240]
See everybody else in the building thinks I'm joking about about having clearance mount the beast since neither one of them can get any.

[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:22.240]
But I think that they're both like relishing it. I think they're going to do it with relish.

[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:29.980]
So say so keep on and follow olive oil you got there. Oh god. That's a gallon. No, sir. He's not yesterday.

[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:35.120]
He said he would do it for like six figures and then what do you say today? Just for a race. Any kind of race.

[00:57:35.200 --> 00:57:38.200]
Yeah, just for a race like a quarter for six or four quarter a week.

[00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:47.320]
Back to him and he said he's already comes pre-loved. You know what is extra virgin? This jug of olive oil we have in here.

[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:56.840]
Fits right in. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line. Here's the pompino. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:00.980]
Yeah, I got a selection for your worst performance in a movie. Yes.

[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:06.900]
The name of the movie is Body of Evidence and a greater performance that she's ever had was Madonna.

[00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:12.460]
Oh yeah. Absolutely horrible. I mean the worst movie maybe a full time also.

[00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:18.500]
Okay. Oh, I don't know how. What was the phone? Joe Montenna, you ever gotten that movie?

[00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:23.380]
They must have owned somebody such a big favor to risk their careers to being a movie with.

[00:58:23.580 --> 00:58:28.180]
I mean the worst movie and without question the worst performance. Okay, pal, they got you down.

[00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:33.140]
Okay, and just to let you know you're right about the quality of broadcasts.

[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:38.040]
Work as journalists in the world today. I mean maybe just three or four good ones maybe.

[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.480]
The rest of it nothing more than just props or anything else. I mean it's terrible.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:47.800]
I don't even bother watching the news. I go online to a web page called it.

[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.260]
L dot O R G. You bring up any newspaper in the country even in the world.

[00:58:52.260 --> 00:58:55.940]
Right. It's something you should check out. I know you would appreciate it. What is it? What is it again?

[00:58:56.320 --> 00:59:03.200]
It's I K L. Stanford Internet Public Library Rory dot O R G. Okay. You can bring up magazines,

[00:59:05.420 --> 00:59:09.720]
newspapers, all different types of records material. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.620]
Okay, have a good day. You too, bye bye.

[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:16.280]
I P L dot O R G. Okay, we'll check that out. Seriously, if you really want to know what's going on in the world

[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.260]
and have any concept, I mean if you care, I mean a lot of people don't care.

[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.640]
But if you do care, you've got to go online. You have to go on the internet because you're not going to get it from

[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:29.160]
the network news or the talking head networks. You're just going to get propaganda, fluff, BS and crap.

[00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:34.040]
That's all you're going to get. Right. As far as the American networks are concerned anyway,

[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:41.120]
you're just going to get a flag waving, flag waving, pom, pom tossing and garbage, which is why,

[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:44.840]
you know, in Britain at least they're having a big upper or a Tony Blair. They're holding his

[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.620]
feet to the fire and how come you lied to us and you made up all these stories and you embellish

[00:59:48.620 --> 00:59:52.640]
them and told us all of this bull crap when you was all a freaking lie. But here it's like, oh,

[00:59:53.180 --> 01:00:00.120]

Barbecue's galore.

[01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:30.360]
My, my, and local. This is sports real by sick.

[01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.280]
You ain't way too way.

[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:39.620]
Oh, you're so old. Now usually I don't do this, but let me tell you a little bit about the

[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:45.200]
wheels that I drive to work in. Now I'm not trying to be rude, but you can really get screwed

[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:50.880]
by those dealers trying to sell you automobile brand new. See, I don't need the fancy grills,

[01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:56.160]
all those new cosmetics. I've had my baby 20 years shifting on those stripped out gears

[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:03.400]
to the hongo and the hongo. It got a four on the floor. It got all four of its doors,

[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.600]
but not a hell of a lot more. It needs a brand new ignition. It got a broken transmission.

[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.080]
It got some holes in the body. It got front and rear fenders. Missing leaks like a ton of a gun,

[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:19.080]
but I'm like so hot across. It's a piece of, you know what, baby, but at least it's paid for.

[01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.960]
That's an honor of a motorboy's great car and that he's got air conditioning in now.

[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.340]
Let's hear it. He's really moving up in the world. Woo-hoo. Yeah, he's dangerous now. He's got AC

[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:32.720]
in that piece of crap. See, I thought he should go down to hell and he would have talked to me.

[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.320]
If he would have talked to me, I should have. He got another station sponsor though.

[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:46.120]
Who's that? Power 96. Oh yeah. No, what's the name of the place? The

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:51.420]
hongo, Rick case hongo. Right, this is another one of our stations. He's had another station,

[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:56.880]
so that's why I was like looking like a part of another station sponsors. 258 votes on

[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.780]
pull number one. How would you rate your parents in honor of fathers days someday? Both parents

[01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:11.660]
grade 125, 40 and a half percent. Both okay, 54. Mother good father lame 38. Both the

[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:19.360]
zaster 30 and father good mother lame only 11. See? A lot of good mothers out there. Fathers.

[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.340]
Here's a facet to speak of the fast and furious Vin Diesel's coaster. Paul Walker gave the

[01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:30.180]
worst acting performance I've ever seen. He's like the new piano reaves. One part stoner, one part

[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:37.460]
stone. My vote is for Paul Walker in the fast and furious and what is that? And two fast,

[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.420]
two furious to get off. Okay, well, the fast and furious is good enough. Paul Walker got it.

[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:48.620]
Got it. Nobody wrote that down. Madonna's not doing too well. A lot of hostility. Any movie with

[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.940]
Madonna and JLo, you know it's going to suck right off the bat. In fact, some of them have been

[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.740]
so bad that they won't even release them in the theaters. Right. Especially JLo, her and Ben

[01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:01.980]
Aflac and everybody's going, oh yeah, right. I believe you guys. They're getting a big plantation

[01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:09.020]
in in Georgia somewhere in Atlanta or outside of Atlanta. And there's going to be like two houses

[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.440]
under plantation. She's going to be living in one. He's going to be living in the other one. And

[01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:17.840]
then there's like a guest house for Matt Damon. Madonna and Shanghai surprise. Are we going to put

[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:24.000]
all these Madonna ones down? That's not. Well, why not? And it probably is difficult to discern.

[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.120]
You have to be a real movie buff to be able to differentiate between like which was the

[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:34.120]
all-time worth. But that's what the essence of the poll. All right. Sweeped away.

[01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:38.560]
Shanghai surprise. We already got body of evidence. Who's that girl?

[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:44.920]
Bloodhounds have brought way. The next best thing and dangerous. Where are you going? Come back,

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.580]
Carlos. Where are you going? What? How about just Madonna and any movie? No, that's not the poll.

[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.580]
See, again, he's trying to change it. No, no. He's trying to be able to type these or answer the

[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:02.220]
phone. He can't do both. Well, I thought you're writing these down. I'm writing them down,

[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:06.380]
but he has to type them up. They don't. But this poll doesn't go up until noon. He's got plenty of

[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.580]
time. Just relax. Just take a chill pill, okay? Or take a purple one like Sarah would do. Just relax.

[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:17.360]
God. You're starting to get a little bit like Eric now. And I understand you got a lot of other

[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.440]
more important fish to fry. Don't forget we want lots of extra bacon in there. In fact,

[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.620]
we can have like Niels diner in there next week when I'm there. We'll bring it grill. Yeah,

[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.600]
we'll bring we get barbecue. So Lord, we're bringing a grill. We'll grill in Cybert's, of course,

[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.280]
as highly illegal. But what are we here? Oh, I got a little bit of grill at home. In fact,

[01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.640]
I'm probably the people in our neighborhood think that the new Pope is being picked because

[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.980]
they'll be like smoke coming out of the top of the building. But that's okay, because we got

[01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:45.080]
the fire department right down the street. Nobody cares about us. Boy, they must hate us like poison.

[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:50.600]
Yeah, we have like a for real fire alert about a year or two years ago and at the end of that

[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.500]
in that building. And the bells are ringing and the whistles are going off and the lights are

[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:58.000]
flashing and they never showed up. They're busy playing Pinochled on the street there. They were

[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.600]
watching it though with binoculars and laughing. Yeah, they were going like, oh, right.

[01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:09.160]
Maybe they just don't like sports. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a 80 or maybe they just don't

[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:13.700]
like the Marlins. That might be it since this station is so freaking Marlin intensive.

[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.900]
Here's Miami. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah, your movie intensive again. I guess.

[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:26.640]
Can I tell you? Okay. Worst performance has to be Elizabeth Barkley in show group.

[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:35.040]
Berkeley. Berkeley, I'm sorry. With that. Okay. Let me ask you a question. You're always talking

[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.820]
in the movies, but if always English movies are English speaking movies. Do you ever get into

[01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:46.860]
foreign films or? You mean foreign films with subtitles? Yeah, such as. I don't know. There's a lot

[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:52.920]
like Spanish movies, lob desire, all those kind of movies. No, I want to do it real well. That's

[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:59.140]
a really interesting. No. Okay. But yeah, whatever her last name is has to be one of the worst.

[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.460]
Barkley, Berkeley. Okay. Pal, we got you there. Now what was that the Italian movie?

[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:10.040]
That very famous Italian movie that I finally saw here a few weeks ago. My life. No, you know,

[01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:15.740]
huh? Like the one about the cinema, the cinema birdie show. That's the one. That was a good movie.

[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:20.800]
Yeah, depressing. Mm-hmm. That was pretty good. Had PP in it. PP?

[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:28.280]
Any movie with PP in it can't be all that bad. And then, and like I said before,

[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:32.660]
I mentioned that yesterday. But then again, that's a Fag movie. Somebody can watch a Fag movie on that.

[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:39.600]
It transcends a Fagory transcends five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T

[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.580]
in Verizon Wireless line speaking of Verizon Wireless. Don't forget. Join Joe Castello in order to

[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:47.540]
give him a big buildup, especially since he's not getting the dolphin tickets. Break it to him gently.

[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.600]
Oh, he's probably on his way driving it right now. You know what? He's probably just bitching me

[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:56.840]
out and muttering under his breath. Cleansion his teeth grinding his teeth like Sarah.

[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.080]
So, what caused Joe? He got a lot, you know, how many two, three years in a row at least?

[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.480]
Maybe more than maybe four. That I give him those dolphin season tickets, which I was pleased to do,

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:09.480]
because he's a good guy and he gets underpaid and gets treated like crap. But he's got his own show

[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.920]
now and he's a superstar and he will get that five to six hour back once a forever gets more

[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.020]
out of the building, which the way it sounds like soon. Boy, Gildi, we're not too sure if you'd tune

[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:23.940]
this delay. Gildi was a no show this morning. He was a wall. He just said, I'm not coming in.

[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:30.740]
Not I'm sick. Not the wife has got the flu. Not the kid is crap in their pants. But I'm just not

[01:08:30.740 --> 01:08:39.180]
coming in for his pants. Is it in the boy he's got? Yes, Jake. Jake with his snake. So the anticipation

[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:44.800]
is now the speculation is that Gildi may have flown the coop. That's what for all is starting

[01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:49.560]
anyway. And of course, if that's the case, it might just be because of this five to eight thing,

[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:54.220]
because Gildi is sharp enough to see the handwriting on a wall, whereas Moe continues being in denial.

[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:58.720]
You know, I guess when you get in your 80s, you start denying a lot of things. Anyway,

[01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.280]
you'll be noone to two at the Verizon Wireless 329 Arthur Gaffey Road Mime Beach. Stop by and

[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.760]
console him. In fact, maybe bring him some dolphin tickets. That would be good. And we got our

[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:12.940]
usual two enterprises and some free Marlins tickets. Here's a call from Papa. No, hello.

[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:22.680]
Papa. No, yes, sir. Yeah. I got the worst picture and the worst performance ever in history.

[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:27.540]
Yeah, Frank, Frank Sinatra in the mid 40s when the MGM and first signed him, they had to put them

[01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:32.340]
into something. They put them into the thing called the gay culture or the gay Cavalierre or

[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:37.320]
something like that. They dressed them up like Zorro, put a patient a mustache on his face,

[01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:43.980]
and he spoke with a Mexican accent. Oh, I got to see that. I mean, I mean, look it up in your book.

[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:50.200]
I understand that he spent a small fortune trying to buy the rights to it and picking up all

[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.380]
the prints and everything. It is the worst that you've ever seen. Okay, we got you down.

[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:58.240]
Okay, thanks. Thanks. I'm looking it up now.

[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.220]
You're supposed to make some sound.

[01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:11.880]
Oh, I did. Oh, jeez. Scooted up. Oh, no. Scoot up the thing. The thing.

[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:17.180]
Well, I described the made a misprint on here. Okay. I'm just got to put in Frank Sinatra movies.

[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.760]
Okay. Because I just put on Sinatra and we'll get a bunch of this stuff that passed for music,

[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:25.480]
even though it never was. Compare prices on Sinatra DVDs.

[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.400]
Find Frank Sinatra movies. Okay, here we go. MovieTaggery.com.

[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:45.780]
That's entertainment. Some came running. It happened in Brooklyn. Never so few.

[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:54.080]
Paris-Wennett Sizzles anchors away. Van Rien's express from here to eternity in the tender trap.

[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:00.940]
I don't know when he's talking about soundness list. So during the break, I'll scour. Okay, because it's obviously not on.

[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:05.420]
In fact, it might be my maybe he did buy it up. Maybe it doesn't exist anymore. What do you say the name for was?

[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.520]
I forgot. Oh, oh, here it is. I forgot.

[01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:11.860]
5.670560.

[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.720]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.040]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Any how you doing? Pretty good.

[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.720]
Actually, I think two colors back together called about a little bit sparkly.

[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:25.180]
Right.

[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:27.140]
Two girls. Really bad performance.

[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.700]
And there was a movie. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr. fan.

[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:36.320]
But those were movies that he did that he plays like a serial killer.

[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:43.380]
That is gotta be the worst acting. You can't believe him as a serial killer at all.

[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:46.760]
It looks like a druggy. And you're expecting to be intimidated by a dog.

[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.400]
What a surprise.

[01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:54.040]
And I think it's a I think it is a sturdy foster and he has like apples in the movie. It's a crazy movie.

[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.360]
But it's really bad movie though.

[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.000]
Okay, let me let me while how am I going to know the name of the body?

[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:07.120]
I guess it's not a duty foster. It's something with dreams in it.

[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:07.520]
I forget.

[01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:09.340]
He dreams. He's just generally bad.

[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.820]
Well, something with dreams. Well, I'll check those both through in the break.

[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:12.960]
Just relax. We'll get them both.

[01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:15.260]
We'll get this in after one in a Robert Downey Jr. one.

[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:17.140]
Because I don't want Bonerboy to have to check it out.

[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.740]
Because he's he's overburdened already.

[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.700]
He's got a lot of stuff. He's got a full plate in there.

[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:25.640]
27 past 11 at 5.60 QAM.

[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:40.360]
Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story.

[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.740]
They were a very weird band.

[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:45.880]
But they were from Canada. So there you go.

[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:48.960]
They were crash test dummies.

[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.320]
I never thought I could get into music, you know.

[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:59.420]
Back then, growing up in Winnipeg, there weren't many places.

[01:13:00.720 --> 01:13:03.320]
We'll arrive there. This interview's over.

[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.040]
What the hell?

[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.040]
Inside the behind's cameras kept rolling.

[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:10.080]
As an irate George W. Bush, dressed in some half-assed uniform,

[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.100]
which suggested that he himself had actually fought in the war,

[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.760]
stormed into our studios.

[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:17.740]
Winnipeg, huh? That's in Canadian, ain't it?

[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:20.320]
Lots of French people in Canadian, ain't there?

[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.060]
Well, as a matter of fact, Winnipeg does have the largest French-speaking

[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:27.080]
population in the Western part of Canada, but I don't see how that...

[01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:28.500]
Shut up with your French talk.

[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:29.820]
But I'm speaking English, ain't it?

[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:30.880]
That's how you fool us.

[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.380]
Lazy French people.

[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:33.720]
What they ever do for us.

[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.360]
Well, they helped you win a couple of wars.

[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.960]
Gave you the stature of liberty.

[01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:37.980]
They're bunch of losers.

[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.400]
They don't even shower, and their women don't shave their underarms.

[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.520]
Damn, I wish they had some oil.

[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:45.380]
I'd bomb their French asses.

[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:48.000]
Look, Mr. Bush, I'm with the crash test dummies.

[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:49.680]
We're just trying to do an interview here.

[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:53.180]
And another thing, the name of your band is now the Freedom Dummies.

[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:55.380]
We don't even have the word pensioner name, eh?

[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.240]
It's close enough.

[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:57.520]
Freedom dummies.

[01:13:57.740 --> 01:13:58.120]
You hear me?

[01:13:58.300 --> 01:13:58.840]
Whatever, eh?

[01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:00.860]
The crash test...

[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:02.620]
I mean, the Freedom Dummies.

[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.700]
If you don't like it, it's tough luck.

[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.500]
It's a big, juicy, shopping-wet-looking show business tonight.

[01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.940]
On inside the behind.

[01:14:10.260 --> 01:14:12.060]
That W, he sure knows his dummies, you know?

[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:13.040]
It wasn't 32 or 5.

[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.740]
Sixty-now-the-yes, and after thing, I couldn't find the one he's talking about.

[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:16.640]
Because he said it right.

[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:17.480]
He called first, huh?

[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:18.820]
I don't think it exists.

[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.580]
Gays something, and the only one that had anything...

[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.360]
There's one movie he made called A Salt on a Queen.

[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:25.320]
Okay.

[01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:29.520]
Well, he made a crampload of movies, did you know that?

[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.060]
Yeah, I did.

[01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.380]
The only ones that I would say that were like,

[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.980]
Manchurian candidate was a great movie.

[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:34.380]
Yes, it was.

[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:35.880]
And man with a golden arm.

[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.040]
Never saw it.

[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.880]
Other than that, forget about it.

[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.020]
You didn't like it from here to eternity?

[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:41.220]
No, I'll pick it.

[01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:42.940]
And the original, um...

[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.140]
Ocean's Leaven wasn't too bad.

[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.340]
Now Robert Downey, Jr.,

[01:14:49.340 --> 01:14:50.320]
you're gonna have to have me with this,

[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.080]
because I don't know.

[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:52.740]
Wonderboys, I got a list.

[01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:54.000]
They're all bad.

[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:54.720]
He's bad.

[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:56.500]
No, no, but that's not the one we're talking about.

[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.120]
There was a specific one this guy called,

[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.660]
they were not doing it.

[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:01.420]
See, you're doing what the collars do now.

[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.960]
You're trying to change the other thing.

[01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:05.120]
And by the way, to change it, just a more Wonderboys was good.

[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:07.260]
Weird science.

[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.940]
Chaplain, which wasn't Chaplain.

[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.420]
In Dreams,

[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.520]
Air America,

[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.040]
Chances are...

[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:13.040]

[01:15:13.460 --> 01:15:13.860]
In Dreams?

[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:14.540]
There you go.

[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.220]
Let's hear it.

[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.160]
Uh-oh-oh-oh!

[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:18.240]
See, that wasn't so hard.

[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.540]
Put it down.

[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:22.620]
56670560,

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:25.660]
pound 560 on EAT and T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:27.120]
Father's Day is Sunday.

[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.100]
We're asking today.

[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.960]
How would you rate your parents?

[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.240]
We won't tell them.

[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:32.980]
309 votes.

[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:33.800]
Both great.

[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:34.660]
152.

[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.300]
49.1%.

[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:38.960]
Both okay, 65.

[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:40.980]
Mother Good,

[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:43.220]
Father Lane 47,

[01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:44.980]
47 lame fathers.

[01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:47.480]
Both in a disaster, 33.

[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:49.180]
And mother Good,

[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.160]
or Father Good,

[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:51.600]
Mother Lane will need 12, see?

[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.260]
Most of the mothers are not too bad.

[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.660]
George and I, of course, didn't get too lucky, but

[01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.140]
that was perfect.

[01:15:59.520 --> 01:15:59.960]
56670560,

[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:02.820]
pound 560 on EAT and T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.360]
Worst acting performance ever

[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.060]
in a movie by an actor actress.

[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:07.640]
That's it.

[01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:08.160]
It's very simple.

[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:12.820]
Here's a call from somewhere.

[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:13.180]
Hello.

[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:14.300]
Yeah?

[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:16.220]
Yes, Malphore Drummond says.

[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:16.840]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:19.140]
Well, I wasn't for Drummond for me on a whole.

[01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:21.720]
I'm in Orlando now.

[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:23.600]
I have a good one, George.

[01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:25.280]
I hope George can help me out with it.

[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.600]
It was shot in Miami ahead.

[01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:29.120]
Sharon Stone and it.

[01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.200]
It's just alone.

[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.580]
And then a single mafia guy.

[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:33.820]
That's sliver sliver.

[01:16:34.300 --> 01:16:37.640]
The guy I'm nominating is the old man who is fitting and saying,

[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:39.140]
you, you stupid.

[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.520]
You know what I mean?

[01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:42.020]
No, I never saw that movie.

[01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.440]
And that's Sylvester in it.

[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.660]
Sharon Stone hired Sylvester

[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.860]
to put a hit on this guy.

[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:49.480]
She got her an hour.

[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:50.560]
I never saw it.

[01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.560]
He's covered in hair and cuba.

[01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:55.180]
Well, we'll put down sliver and then somebody will call

[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.340]
and tell us what you're talking about.

[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:56.660]
All right.

[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.980]
Well, can I have one more in case if no one remembers that?

[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:00.860]
Go ahead.

[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:03.140]
Demi Moore in strip T's.

[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:05.760]
Okay.

[01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:06.940]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:07.620]
You got it.

[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:07.980]
Thanks.

[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:08.540]
Okay.

[01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:09.180]
Bye.

[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:11.080]
Demi Demi.

[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:11.640]
Get it right.

[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:12.600]
More in strip T's.

[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:13.620]
Now, here's one.

[01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:14.880]
How do I have forgotten this?

[01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.360]
Well, I was so carried away with Godfather

[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.680]
sent a woman, El Pacino.

[01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:23.080]
Not just a bad performance and embarrassingly bad.

[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:24.800]
He gets an Academy Award for it.

[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.820]
That's the best part to share what political

[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:27.820]
much of crap that is.

[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.680]
I mean, you talk about overacting and just

[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.740]
bizarre his whole, the whole ambiance of his character,

[01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:37.420]
the whole movie was just unacceptable.

[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:38.760]
Unacceptable.

[01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.700]
We got something on our website.

[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:43.680]
How about your point?

[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.240]
We got something you want to know

[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:46.360]
on our website.

[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.120]
Oh, it's up there now.

[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:48.300]
Something a little squirrely.

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.340]
Oh, the audience needs to see this.

[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.000]
Let me see.

[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:54.320]

[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.360]
Oh, God.

[01:18:00.780 --> 01:18:01.500]
Now, let me out.

[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.360]
So this one, the balls aren't swinging.

[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.360]
They're just like, uh,

[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:06.560]
they're stationary.

[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.600]
Oh, they were swinging.

[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:09.060]
My aren't swinging.

[01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:10.420]
My balls aren't swinging, man.

[01:18:10.580 --> 01:18:12.060]
No, I didn't know they were swinging at all.

[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:13.680]
Was that how the original picture turned out?

[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:13.760]

[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.100]
Yeah, the ball swing.

[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.420]
I need to edit it a different way.

[01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:16.760]
I'm sorry.

[01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:18.440]
Anybody can have balls that just the

[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.380]
uh, the uh, sacked that just hangs down there.

[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:21.640]
But they have swinging balls.

[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.000]
They'll be swinging.

[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.300]
Is that what more told you that the

[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:26.580]
Teema? This is the amazing true story.

[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.800]
Moe Howard David, it is in their Tink and Leake

[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:31.700]
while Beanor Boy is taking his bath in the

[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.400]
sink this morning in a QM T room.

[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:37.220]
And most is to, uh, he's telling the story

[01:18:37.220 --> 01:18:38.920]
about he, he's coming to work this morning

[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.720]
and he sees this Cuban guy getting

[01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:42.300]
head in his car in a way to work.

[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:43.540]
In his car?

[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.940]
In the car next to him on a highway.

[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:48.540]
Shmuck.

[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:54.900]
And he was obviously obsessed with this because he talked about it at length this morning

[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:55.420]
from what I heard.

[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:56.640]
That's about all he was talking about.

[01:18:56.700 --> 01:19:00.620]
He said he was going to, because there was a tie up on 95, he was going to take the

[01:19:00.620 --> 01:19:05.300]
turnpike going home and he was going to see if he could find a Cuban guy, which you

[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.640]
can interpret that any way you want.

[01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:08.260]
Maybe he wanted to be the next in line.

[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:13.360]
So he's trying to show a beener boy just a look on the guy's face as he looks over

[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:17.420]
this next car and the guy had a big smile on his foot as he's getting ahead as he's

[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:18.000]
driving to work.

[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.040]
Now what did he say to you?

[01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.380]
Look, look.

[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:22.680]
And I was like looking down at the sink.

[01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.640]
He's like, no, he's standing.

[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:26.800]
He's standing at the urinal taking a leak saying, look, look.

[01:19:27.380 --> 01:19:29.000]
And I'm like, no, I get it.

[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:29.300]
I get it.

[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:30.240]
He's like, no, no, you've got to look.

[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.800]
See, if I'm standing there and Moa's standing, look, my thought is, I don't think so.

[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.320]
I don't think so.

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:36.760]
Yeah.

[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:42.320]
So the gallery of the weird, the squirrely Moa is right next to the Mozo, which you can

[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:43.900]
pick your whichever one you like the best.

[01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.980]
And I have a feeling you'll be able to know what's that thing underneath it there.

[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:50.200]
Yeah, I got to put that picture back.

[01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:51.320]
I must have taken it down by accident.

[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:53.120]
What, the feral picture?

[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:54.640]
Right, because I resized it.

[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.980]
Yeah, make his package a little bit smaller.

[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:59.860]
Okay, it's too intimidating for most of the rest of us.

[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:03.600]
Pedro Miami says, here's one Nicholas Cage in Con Air.

[01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:07.620]
It was so bad that it made Kiana Reeves in Dracula look good.

[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:08.680]
Wow, thanks Pedro.

[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:09.500]
Got that down.

[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.860]
Nicholas Cage in Con Air.

[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:11.360]
Got it.

[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.160]
Nicholas Cage was worse than face off with John Travolta.

[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.480]
Well, put it down.

[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.240]
Nicholas Cage in John Travolta.

[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.120]
Oh my god.

[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.560]
Mm-hmm.

[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:24.740]
I'd rather watch the rest of the train spotting for a second before I'd watch that.

[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.500]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:31.760]
We promised this is our last movie show, at least until Monday.

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.500]
We've been overdoing this for like the last year or four weeks now, very movie intensive.

[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:37.760]
And we apologize, don't we?

[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.080]
No.

[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:40.560]
Don't we want to apologize to the audience for getting like two one dimensional?

[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:40.760]
No.

[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:41.520]
We don't want to do that.

[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.280]
We'd rather give away some Marlon tickets.

[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.620]
It'll take for all of our another week and then he'll understand.

[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.920]
In fact, once they come back home and he starts going to a few more games and realizes

[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:53.800]
that he's got his own section.

[01:20:54.340 --> 01:20:54.520]
Yeah.

[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.720]
He'll begin to realize, and especially once we get to the dog days of July and August,

[01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.660]
when it's 100 reasons to shade the mosquitoes or his biggest baseballs and they're

[01:21:02.660 --> 01:21:03.780]
ain't nobody there.

[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:08.960]
He'll start saying, gee, I think this was a bad move on my poor killer for hopping on this gland wagon.

[01:21:13.140 --> 01:21:14.560]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:14.880]
Hello.

[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:18.520]
Hi, my name is Rosemary, first of all.

[01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:19.560]
Hi, Rosemary.

[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.340]
I have a request for you.

[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.860]
Can you play in my religion as better than your religion?

[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:27.600]
Any special reason?

[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:32.740]
My wife says it's a good song and I want to hear it.

[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:34.680]
Okay, Rosemary, you got it.

[01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:35.920]
All right, thanks a lot, Neil.

[01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:37.020]
Have a great weekend.

[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:38.000]
You too, honey.

[01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:38.860]
Bye-bye.

[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.320]
See, another woman wanted something.

[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.500]
Right, I just mentioned that in passing.

[01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:44.600]
I'll be glad to play it for you.

[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:45.220]
It's a great bit.

[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:51.080]
Yesterday, though, just coincidentally, but I'll be delighted to play it, but another female

[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:52.500]
caller who wanted something.

[01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.860]
We're supporting you five to see you.

[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.040]
2 a.m.

[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:01.440]
Hammer.

[01:22:01.540 --> 01:22:02.040]
The hammer.

[01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:03.280]
Hey, Goldberg.

[01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.300]
How many games did he miss in the last three years?

[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:10.080]
I'll give you an over under a 12 for a thousand dollars.

[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.240]
I'll say over 12.

[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.780]
Hey, me.

[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:14.720]
Hey, me.

[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:16.020]
Hey, me, me, homie.

[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.120]
Hey, hey, hey.

[01:22:17.260 --> 01:22:18.440]
Support for you five to 60.

[01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.420]
2 a.m.

[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:21.540]
You're a bastard.

[01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:40.300]
3 a.m.

[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.660]
пошes like that.

[01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.400]
I guess this part was implicitlyopian.

[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:44.400]

[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:44.400]

[01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:51.520]
IRL but this piece, cues, and music.

[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:51.520]

[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:51.520]

[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:53.700]
I'm religion's better than your religion.

[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.540]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:59.580]
But we like about it best.

[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.360]
I find the boys in wear red dress.

[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.580]
I religion's better than your mother-o-sook.

[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:04.860]
God!

[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.660]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.220]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:10.940 --> 01:23:11.660]
I should think of it.

[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:13.640]
We had no respect for women.

[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.360]
Driver, time to make a living.

[01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:17.360]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:24.700]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:26.720]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:27.880]
I human heart for us wooby-goosuh.

[01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.480]
We slaughter pigs and drop in votes.

[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.640]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.380]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:38.680]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:42.360]
We lotonies, I can tell their temper.

[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.680]
I religion's better than yours.

[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:50.180]
My religion is better than your religion.

[01:23:50.620 --> 01:23:52.700]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:56.860]
We not endorse a bother like overbrushed,

[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.660]
to spew our views.

[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.460]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:00.900 --> 01:24:03.340]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.600]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:11.720]
We wear ties and ride our bikes and gets to marry lots of wives.

[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.740]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:17.560]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:18.620 --> 01:24:21.080]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:24.980]
We don't want to use our brains for pointless living,

[01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:25.800]
so we're late.

[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.280]
My religion is better than yours.

[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:31.280]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.520]
Good old time, religion, baby.

[01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:33.200]
That's what's doing.

[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.540]
And we got that road map to peace.

[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:36.640]
Oh, we love each other.

[01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.320]
11.45, 15.til noon at 5.60.

[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.700]
QM 347 votes on poll number one.

[01:24:42.220 --> 01:24:43.140]
How would you rate your parents?

[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.020]
And I think we're proven our point.

[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:46.500]
Are we not?

[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.100]
Yes, we are.

[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.020]
Both great 175.

[01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:51.060]
That's over 50% of this audience.

[01:24:51.140 --> 01:24:51.620]
Oh, right.

[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.100]
That's herod.

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:54.680]
Lucky bastards, because you can pick your nose.

[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:57.240]
You can fit seeds out of your ass, but you can't pick your parents.

[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.160]
Both great 175.

[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:00.700]
Both okay 70.

[01:25:01.900 --> 01:25:04.560]
Mother good, father lame 54.

[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.100]
Both of disaster 36.

[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:09.860]
Ma.

[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.800]
And father good mother lame only 12.

[01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:15.240]
See that 54 to 12?

[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.960]
54 to 12.

[01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:21.520]
With a good mother and a really crappy father.

[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.140]
A lame father, an emotional cripple.

[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:25.860]
A basket case.

[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:27.940]
A cold as ice stone man.

[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.380]
A piece of turd.

[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.200]
A distant nasty miserable hostile prick.

[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:36.920]
You got it?

[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:37.800]
I think we made the point.

[01:25:37.980 --> 01:25:38.680]
Yeah, we got it.

[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.580]
So is worthwhile.

[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.620]
And in the meantime, we're building the other pull.

[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:42.260]
We should go up at noon.

[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:43.640]
It'll be up on air all weekend long.

[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.820]
The worst acting performance ever in a movie was.

[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:48.760]
And so far we got Eli Wallach, Godfather 3.

[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.920]
Sophia Coppola, Godfather 3.

[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.420]
Bo Derek and Tarzan.

[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:54.060]
What's the name of that movie with Tarzan?

[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:54.240]
What?

[01:25:54.520 --> 01:25:55.720]
Tarzan the ape man.

[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:59.260]
Oh, hey, then, Christensen, poor little Hayden.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:25:59.880]
Come on, Hayden.

[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.760]
Let me pat you on the head.

[01:26:00.900 --> 01:26:01.940]
It'll be everything will be okay.

[01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.240]
Star Wars 2.

[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.500]
Darryl Hanna, in Clanda the cave bear.

[01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.840]
And then you've got the rest of the list.

[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:09.340]
Oh, geez.

[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.960]
Well, that's the only ones that wrote down.

[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:13.360]
You say you don't have to write them down.

[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.860]
So, thus, there's the load in rhinestone.

[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:16.900]
Tom Hanks and Jovers of the volcano.

[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.040]
Nicholas Cage and Moonstruck.

[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:18.840]
Now, wait a minute.

[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:19.320]
Wow.

[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.520]
Now, why are you reading the...

[01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.560]
See, this is like what you do with the spots for treasure violence.

[01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:26.080]
Like you're making an announcement.

[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:26.880]
Do you understand?

[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.000]
Corny.

[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:28.680]
I'm trying.

[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:30.160]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.080]
An affected voice.

[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:34.920]
Why can't you read the rest of the list just the same way you were talking to me before that?

[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:37.220]
I'm trying to give you like a little broadcast etiquette here.

[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:39.280]
Okay, don't be cute.

[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.600]
Just read them.

[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:41.520]
Like in your natural voice.

[01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.400]
In fact, maybe you want to read them in Pharrell's voice.

[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.140]
Oh, yeah.

[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:47.640]
Then down on the fast and the furious.

[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.480]
It was neither of the above there.

[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:50.480]
I should kill him.

[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.380]
Neon Kazam.

[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:53.520]
He's not making enough money.

[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.400]
He has to make Kazam.

[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.180]
I can't do reason the matrix.

[01:26:56.740 --> 01:26:57.140]
Reloaded.

[01:26:57.540 --> 01:26:58.680]
Or either one of them, I guess.

[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:02.080]
Madonna, on a long list of these movies,

[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.240]
I only wrote half of them down.

[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.020]
So Venus, boy, you got the right body of evidence,

[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.760]
sheying high, swept a hoos of blood.

[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:08.660]
Elizabeth, Berkeley, and showgirls.

[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.420]
I didn't know anybody was supposed to be acting in that.

[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.640]
Presidents after we're never going to find out the name of that other movie.

[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840]
Robert Downey, Jr.

[01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:16.420]
Whatever.

[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.420]
In dreams.

[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.860]
Nicholas Cage, Conair, Demi Mordes.

[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:20.940]
Oh, sorry.

[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.600]
Demi Mordes, Triptes, Al Pacino, and Stench of a Woman.

[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:26.540]
And Nicholas Cage and get that face off.

[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:31.640]
Now, I just want to ask Bonerboy if he agrees with me.

[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:34.940]
When you do that voice, not only you sound better,

[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:37.060]
but you all of a sudden you acquire the same

[01:27:37.060 --> 01:27:38.300]
that Ferell personality.

[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.140]
You're actually funny.

[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.180]
He's infectious.

[01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.440]
Oh, my God.

[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:46.140]
Am I right?

[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.440]
Yeah, he forgets to be himself.

[01:27:48.700 --> 01:27:48.920]
Right.

[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.380]
But he becomes, he's morphing into a Ferell Jr.

[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.380]
I should see it as a visual thing, too.

[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:55.420]
Many Ferell.

[01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.540]
In fact, probably when his package grows a little bit.

[01:27:57.900 --> 01:27:58.540]
You should see it.

[01:27:58.540 --> 01:27:59.480]
Okay, let's see.

[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:01.560]
Now, Silver Chair, it was at the name of that movie.

[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:02.380]
So I'll sliver.

[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:03.760]
We don't know.

[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:04.560]
For real.

[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.120]
She wanted the name of the old guy in it.

[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.840]
I won't ever find it.

[01:28:08.980 --> 01:28:13.040]
It's never a movie that is about a hotel and one of the...

[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:14.380]
Yeah, it's a Picking Tom movie.

[01:28:14.820 --> 01:28:14.820]

[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:15.720]
Really?

[01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:17.440]
That has nothing to do with it.

[01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:18.520]
Picking through the P hole.

[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.080]
Is that in there?

[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:21.640]
In other words, we have absolutely no idea what movie she was talking about.

[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:24.120]
Well, she gave us the Demi Mordes to cover her ass.

[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:24.880]
So we got that on there.

[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:25.540]
Got it?

[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:27.360]
Did you do that when you went on the...

[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.520]
Did you do a set of old movies?

[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.560]
I don't know with Al Pacino.

[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.220]
Yes, I did.

[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.340]
I called it Stenchable Woman though.

[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:32.520]
Oh, it was...

[01:28:33.940 --> 01:28:35.620]
I don't care what...

[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.820]
How do I keep doing that?

[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.520]
I don't care how anybody tries to tell you that that's a good movie.

[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.020]
In fact, I wish you would see it.

[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:42.040]
I've been begging you to see that.

[01:28:42.120 --> 01:28:43.920]
Then you'll say, how can that be anybody?

[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.260]
Can't it be an award for that?

[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:45.920]
I don't want to.

[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:47.600]
What a performance.

[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.720]
And talk about an ending.

[01:28:50.660 --> 01:28:53.320]
At the end of the movie, he goes back home to...

[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.100]
I don't know if it's his wife or his sister.

[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:56.540]
I don't know who the hell it is.

[01:28:56.540 --> 01:28:57.640]
Because we never find out.

[01:28:58.340 --> 01:29:00.600]
And he goes and he walks in and he's like this...

[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:03.480]
...commudedly nasty prick who wanted to kill himself

[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:05.800]
and everybody hates him and he's like...

[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.220]
I don't know, he just wanders in and that's it.

[01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:12.680]
They don't tell us who it is or what the relationship...

[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:13.320]
I mean, that's it.

[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:15.420]
And you say, oh, thank God it's over anyway.

[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:16.820]
We don't need a good ending.

[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.260]
Just an ending would be good enough.

[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:19.460]
Awful movie.

[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.000]
Here's a cop from Jupiter.

[01:29:22.200 --> 01:29:22.340]
Hello.

[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:23.320]
Daniel.

[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:24.180]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.680]
George is getting pretty good at that for Elle, boys.

[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:26.980]
That's fair.

[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.440]
I think that's magnificent.

[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.400]
It sure is how beats just be in George.

[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:33.360]
I tell you what, speaking of for Elle,

[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:36.460]
that crossover segment that you do when you talk to each other...

[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:36.580]
Yeah.

[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.140]
...the other one predictable and off the wall.

[01:29:38.460 --> 01:29:40.560]
I mean, I tune in just to make sure I catch that every day.

[01:29:40.900 --> 01:29:41.140]
Great.

[01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.900]
You think we ought to do that every day?

[01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:44.840]
Because crossovers can maybe are generally...

[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:44.960]
Huh?

[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:46.700]
I love it every day.

[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:47.380]
Okay.

[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.000]
And a nomination for the poll.

[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:50.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.860]
17-year-old nephew who was living with me.

[01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.840]
I think he got this movie for spank material.

[01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.460]
It was so bad.

[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:59.200]
It was Britney Spears in the movie Crossroads.

[01:29:59.240 --> 01:29:59.860]
She was awful.

[01:30:00.580 --> 01:30:01.520]
I mean, it was embarrassing.

[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:02.860]
I was embarrassed for her.

[01:30:04.140 --> 01:30:04.520]
Okay.

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.520]
If she couldn't lip that, I mean,

[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.200]
it was so bad to see on the description.

[01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.280]
You wish she could lip-think her movie part.

[01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:12.600]
We got it, Pallie.

[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:13.500]
Thanks.

[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:15.960]
She got it for some...

[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.860]
Mucky spank in material.

[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:17.360]
And why not?

[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:18.240]
A Britney's in it.

[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:18.500]
Why?

[01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:21.580]
We also got the name of Silvice Estelona, Sharon Stone movie.

[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:21.960]
Really?

[01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:22.740]
Yeah, we got a lot of facts.

[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:23.360]
I just had it to him.

[01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:24.080]
Sean got it.

[01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:24.920]
Oh, you got it?

[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:25.420]
All right.

[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.020]
The specialist.

[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:27.820]
The specialist.

[01:30:28.060 --> 01:30:28.840]
Oh, that was awful.

[01:30:30.260 --> 01:30:31.300]
And you're supposed to...

[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:31.940]
Did you see it?

[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:33.220]
I didn't see it.

[01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:33.940]
I didn't even.

[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:34.900]
It's a Silvester's God.

[01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:35.780]
No, that's exactly.

[01:30:35.940 --> 01:30:36.840]
That's why I didn't see it.

[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:40.320]
I wouldn't watch a movie with him in it

[01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.820]
if you paid me by the second.

[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.480]
Oh, you mean you haven't seen Rocky?

[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:45.520]
Well, it's been on TV about 40 million times.

[01:30:45.520 --> 01:30:46.600]
And every time it comes on,

[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.460]
I see about two seconds.

[01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.380]
And that's how long it takes me to change the channel.

[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.520]
Now, if that is something...

[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.200]
If somebody needs to explain that to Manor,

[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:57.000]
there's a lot of really stupid people out there.

[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.680]
There's a lot of people who admire dumbness

[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:01.660]
because they feel it's like they can relate to it

[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:02.180]
like the president.

[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:04.440]
But, I mean, how can you watch him?

[01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.840]
And take him serious.

[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.700]
And from what I understand,

[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.220]
he really believes he's a great actor.

[01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.580]
He really believes his own bushman.

[01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:14.640]
Absolutely.

[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:15.540]
Yeah.

[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:16.680]
He's the best.

[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:20.040]
But, like I said, there's a lot of dumb people out there.

[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.840]
What's wrong with making dumb movies for dumb people?

[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:22.860]
Everybody's gonna have something.

[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.760]
Just like they're all said about Britney.

[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.140]
Everybody's gonna have some monkey-spanking movies.

[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.820]
Although, generally speaking,

[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.060]
if you're gonna get a monkey-spanking movie,

[01:31:31.220 --> 01:31:32.940]
might as well get one more somebody's really doing it.

[01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.100]
Yeah, those are skaky ass nasty-looking people, though.

[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.040]
Not necessarily.

[01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:40.700]
You're just getting the wrong ones.

[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:45.460]
The recently departed Rod Stiger played the over-the-top Cuban mafia patriarch

[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:46.740]
in the Specialist.

[01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.200]
Well, I think I did see that.

[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.200]
Or at least a bit of it.

[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:55.900]
For the action, imagine Tony Montana at 75 years old.

[01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:59.220]
James Wood is the hypersensitive former CIA assassant

[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:00.480]
not to be missed, says Sean.

[01:32:00.820 --> 01:32:03.720]
PS, the worst performance must be Christopher Lambert

[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:06.680]
in Greystroke, Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Aces.

[01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:07.460]
Apes.

[01:32:08.380 --> 01:32:10.480]
Did a fine job acting like a monkey, I thought?

[01:32:10.820 --> 01:32:13.640]
Since he makes Steven Seagal look like Sir Lawrence Olivier.

[01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:14.880]
Oh, no.

[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.700]
That's very important.

[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:21.400]
Nobody can make Steven Seagal look like anything but a piece of crap.

[01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:21.720]
Crash.

[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:22.780]
Doesn't belong on the screen.

[01:32:23.060 --> 01:32:23.240]
Yeah.

[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:25.240]
How about what's it?

[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:25.780]
Oh, and you know what?

[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:26.760]
I never got that other movie.

[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.400]
Well, there's a whole bunch of mine I've never got.

[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.380]
But the one with what's his name that I can't stand

[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.840]
from the post encounters of the third kind,

[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:33.960]
which you drive out of.

[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.420]
Mr. Holland's penis.

[01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:37.680]
Never got that.

[01:32:37.980 --> 01:32:38.900]
What was it called?

[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:41.800]
Mr. Holland's Opus?

[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:42.960]
No.

[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:45.680]
The one that they said was so funny that we'd pee in our pants.

[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.220]
Oh, the horse racing movie?

[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:48.600]
Let it run.

[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:48.900]
Yeah.

[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:49.580]
Let it run.

[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:50.720]
I'll never get it.

[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.420]
I'm not getting the movie with Richard Dreyfus.

[01:32:52.500 --> 01:32:53.360]
He just bugs me.

[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.900]
I don't like him.

[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.560]
And it's not just because of that one.

[01:32:56.600 --> 01:32:58.440]
I just don't like the whole of his whole ambiance.

[01:32:58.560 --> 01:32:59.520]
He's just too, I don't know.

[01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:01.460]
He's a melodramatic actor.

[01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.640]
Just like the actor who played in that Port noise complaint.

[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.680]
That real stereotypical, juie guy.

[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:07.580]
And what was his name?

[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:09.380]
I never thought Port noise complaint.

[01:33:09.560 --> 01:33:11.420]
Oh, where he was a screw in the box of liver.

[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.800]
Oh, you'd like that.

[01:33:13.080 --> 01:33:14.860]
No, hey, as a matter of fact,

[01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.540]
tell Clarence that something ought to practice over the weekend in Omaha.

[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:19.620]
And then when it gets back, because they got, you know,

[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:20.960]
they're famous for the great meat in Omaha.

[01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:25.340]
He said that he likes to be so much he's going to take him home as a trophy

[01:33:25.340 --> 01:33:26.420]
and mount him in the living room.

[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:30.260]
5667-0560-

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.580]
Pound 560.

[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.320]
Every time I talk about that, I start envisioning it, you know?

[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:38.560]
And I can actually, some things you say that are so off the wall,

[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:40.220]
and you just never could imagine it.

[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.180]
But I can imagine that.

[01:33:41.400 --> 01:33:42.120]
I don't want to.

[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.100]
And I think they'd like it.

[01:33:43.740 --> 01:33:44.700]
That's the scary part.

[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.900]
I think that you're talking about two guys who are so desperate.

[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.360]
Clarence just turned 30s, never got laid.

[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.020]
Never even got close to being laid.

[01:33:53.620 --> 01:33:53.720]
You know?

[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:55.600]
Because at least to get laid, you have to get some,

[01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:57.060]
a little bit of somebody's clothes off.

[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.400]
Unless there's just a dry hump, you know?

[01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:02.020]
He never even got close.

[01:34:02.240 --> 01:34:04.620]
The closest he came was chewing on some nice young lady's elbow,

[01:34:04.780 --> 01:34:05.380]
and I was the end of that.

[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.940]
And then the beast, I mean, he's, you know,

[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.540]
he'll tell you stories, you know?

[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:12.100]
I'm like Robert Creeper.

[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:12.980]
He'll tell, I'm not a virgin.

[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:13.680]
I'm not a virgin.

[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.380]
See, blow up towels don't count, Robert.

[01:34:17.420 --> 01:34:19.160]
He's got that janitor, we know blow up towel.

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:21.580]
He hates her.

[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:22.460]
She's a Democrat.

[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.300]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:26.100]
That's why he's trying to kind of like a thing from the exorcist.

[01:34:26.660 --> 01:34:28.960]
376 votes on your parents with five days a day this Sunday.

[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.380]
This is our Proof of Point Pull.

[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:32.400]
383.

[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:34.420]
How would you rate your parents?

[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:36.860]
Both grade 193, over 50%.

[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:38.860]
That's good.

[01:34:39.100 --> 01:34:41.960]
I think that shows you why our audience is so well balanced, you know?

[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:44.640]
Both okay, 77.

[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:48.280]
Mother good, father lame, 17.

[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:52.120]
Mother, father good, mother lame, 17.

[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.240]
57 to 17.

[01:34:53.620 --> 01:34:54.920]
And both of us asked you 39.

[01:34:55.540 --> 01:34:56.680]
Oh, poor babies.

[01:34:57.260 --> 01:35:00.740]
39 with two bad, no wonder some of us are so dysfunctionally, you know?

[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:02.040]
Yeah.

[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.200]
I'm not seriously.

[01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.460]
See, my life could have been, not that I'm complaining, I'm doing pretty good for a, for a schmuck.

[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:09.900]
But it could have been so different.

[01:35:10.020 --> 01:35:14.840]
But the problem being that based on my upbringing, you can't complain about my social skills because I don't have any.

[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.140]
Oh, it built character, you know?

[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:18.480]
When you have a heart attack.

[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:20.120]
No, sir, you didn't hear what I just said.

[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:23.220]
I can't complain about my social skills because I don't have any.

[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:23.920]
Oh, come on.

[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:24.840]
What?

[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:27.460]
You know how to, you have table manners and whatnot.

[01:35:27.980 --> 01:35:29.420]
I'm not talking about etiquette.

[01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:32.400]
There's an difference between social skills which mean interacting with other people.

[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:35.520]
And etiquette, which is like, you know, don't slumber too much all over the table.

[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:38.440]
And walk around with your, all your lunch on your shirt like fat rich.

[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:41.900]
Oh my god, you're so stupid.

[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:43.360]
This is your 20-year bicycle.

[01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:44.860]
You weigh, yeah.

[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:47.920]
This is Steve Goldstein.

[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:49.000]
But you can call me Kelsey.

[01:35:49.540 --> 01:35:52.240]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to, wait a minute, I am in town.

[01:35:52.540 --> 01:35:54.080]
It's the 12-to-1 hour.

[01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:55.080]
Bye!

[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:48.160]
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve

[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:04.900]
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Farmier, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve,loud,

[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:18.120]
Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve,ramatic, creative song,

[01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.560]
hours for Alternon, which I got misspelled even I know that.

[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:25.120]
Alternon. And what's the name of the actor? Do you have any?

[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:29.880]
It says Adam Stanyers. I don't know who that is. Cliff Robertson was the

[01:37:29.880 --> 01:37:34.400]
the star. Yeah. I didn't I don't remember anything wrong with that movie.

[01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.240]
Anybody being terrible in it. And I'm looking I'm not going to waste any more time

[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.280]
because I've been looking and looking and looking and the one that keeps coming up

[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:44.260]
here is that must have been made for TV movie of it. And all these other people

[01:37:44.260 --> 01:37:47.320]
were in it not Adam nobody. And anything that says with John Wayne.

[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:50.240]
Well that's good. I'm going to agree with that but we've got to have an

[01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:54.240]
movie. Here's one that says the worst performance ever William Shatner

[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.040]
and then say Schmittner as Kirk in Star Trek.

[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:03.360]
I can't disagree with that. I mean in terms of putting it down.

[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:06.120]
Are we going to pick one Star Trek in particular? Why do you go right ahead?

[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:08.840]
Star Trek the first masturbation. Is that the one you like?

[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:12.500]
Star Trek the motion picture the first one. I mean whatever.

[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:14.560]
Okay. William Shatner and Star Trek.

[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:18.200]
We just put down Star Trek because they're the same in all room.

[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:22.120]
Same stiff you know affected William Shatner and Star Trek.

[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 point. Now let's get the new pull up there.

[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.500]
Okay. Here's the final result on the apparent pool.

[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:32.340]
Oh we need one more vote to get to 400. I like a nice even number.

[01:38:33.260 --> 01:38:36.360]
One more. Come on. You can do it. I'm refreshing it. I'm looking. I'm waiting.

[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:40.000]
I'm waiting. Come on. Like I said 403. How about you rate your parents?

[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:46.280]
Both grade 202 50.1%. Both okay. Not great but okay 82.

[01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.580]
About 20% out 20. Mother good father Lane 60.

[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:56.000]
Both parents are the Zaster 40 and a good father but a Lane mother.

[01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:57.720]
Oh there's nothing worse than a Lane mother.

[01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:00.380]
We have any of those at QAM 19.

[01:39:01.340 --> 01:39:07.000]
So 60 bad fathers only 19 Lane mothers. See it plus 40 you say both of them stumped like...

[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:14.520]
What's his name like Remus? 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and T.

[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:17.280]
And for Rise of Marlos Lane don't forget our close personal buddy Joe Castell.

[01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:19.400]
He used to be our friend who I said I was going to give the ball.

[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:22.400]
I can think it's to be an avoid this year. Well maybe you'll split him up with him.

[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:27.220]
Huh? He'll share. I was thinking of giving him giving him some of them.

[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.880]
And then you thought why would I do that when I could sell him?

[01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:37.020]
Right. Right. Well by give I may see I'm giving him to you and then you do whatever you want with him.

[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:38.800]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:41.320]
Now give me those parking passes through those purple parking passes.

[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:43.960]
See I have a feeling that he's probably going to want to sell on them.

[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:45.820]
Some of them.

[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.700]
Probably get some good bucks. We get some right on here.

[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.060]
We can auction them off and say it's for our favorite charity.

[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.620]
We got a bit of it. Right.

[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:56.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 are pull questions today.

[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:59.360]
Who do you like to regular George or the Feral Junior George?

[01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:00.620]
We already did that one time.

[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:02.820]
Yeah. And the Feral Junior George won by a mile.

[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.160]
You better practice up on that because you're going to have to have a whole summer doing that.

[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:07.900]
To home.

[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:11.520]
You better start drinking like a lot of tea with honey and lemon.

[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.440]
Other like inhaling those stars.

[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.520]
Yeah. That's supposed to inhale them but I think I'm going to have to.

[01:40:16.620 --> 01:40:17.580]
Now just to keep my voice.

[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:21.860]
How long do you think he talked like that since that this is real voice?

[01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:22.420]
How long?

[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.100]
What age did he develop there?

[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:28.100]
Well you couldn't have possibly had that all his life.

[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.380]
You've been up from the age of 12.

[01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:32.980]
When I had that urban sign accident one of my friends said this was scotch.

[01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:34.920]
I'll tell you one thing when his not strapped.

[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.440]
Must have been like a guy they're earthquake.

[01:40:38.440 --> 01:40:44.120]
Let's see Brad Pitt is an IRA terrorist in the devil's own was easily the worst attempt at acting in the history of cinema.

[01:40:45.080 --> 01:40:52.660]
His pathetic effort at portraying a terrorist with Irish descent was so appalling that I personally went on strike against the whole industry for six months.

[01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:59.060]
If it was anyone else their career would have been blacklist until they were buried lucky for him even though he's had a sexual guy.

[01:40:59.060 --> 01:40:59.800]
I think he's pretty.

[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:01.200]
He is pretty.

[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:03.040]
Even some of us homeless well he was.

[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:06.060]
Also any Ben Affleck movie should do well on your pool.

[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:10.000]
This isn't a movie but David Schwimmer and band of brothers almost destroyed the entire series.

[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:15.140]
And it says dig Lemouski is hilarious that Tina Borky's trying to talk me out of.

[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.180]
I'm going to go out and give it today and maybe even watch it tomorrow.

[01:41:20.780 --> 01:41:21.480]
How do you like that?

[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.060]
Chad, don't miss it.

[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:29.300]
Hey listen it can't be any worse than train spotting.

[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:32.180]
Train spotting was a masterpiece of a movie.

[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:40.100]
Oh please how could anybody you know I'm giving Joe Castello those dolphin tickets for a long time now it's kind of like a tradition.

[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.720]
And I have a feeling you're trying to like talk your way out of them.

[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:50.820]
You really mean that the train spotting was a masterpiece of a movie.

[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:52.460]
Even for non fecal freaks.

[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:57.480]
Also in other words you're admitting that you're a fecal freak is that what you're trying to say now?

[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:59.120]
They call this cat man it over.

[01:42:03.860 --> 01:42:05.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:10.300]
I mean here is a guy I think we're under for all secret.

[01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:12.040]
I think you brought him out of the closet.

[01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:21.500]
I think that once you anybody anybody puts on that voice and people that weren't even mildly amusing before are now all of a sudden they're a panic.

[01:42:21.820 --> 01:42:22.540]
Chad, I know.

[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.660]
Those people are evil.

[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:28.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.580]
Here's a call from Daytona Beach.

[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:30.860]
Hello.

[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.780]
Hey, yes sir.

[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.920]
Fight for the after movie was called the kissing bandit.

[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:38.200]
Okay.

[01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.480]
That guy wasn't close with Catherine Grace and absolutely the worst.

[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:47.740]
But you know what would have made him a sex of a woman a good movie if while he's driving blind that they both got killed.

[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:50.960]
That's your one of sure enough a little bit.

[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:51.600]
A good movie.

[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:52.320]
Alright.

[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:52.900]
I agree.

[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:54.640]
Okay.

[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:55.900]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:56.840]
Okay.

[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:57.640]
See ya.

[01:42:57.860 --> 01:42:58.400]
He's right.

[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.640]
Yeah, he was driving a Ferrari test driving a Ferrari.

[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:01.980]
Blind man.

[01:43:02.540 --> 01:43:03.740]
And Chris O'Donnell is telling him.

[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:04.880]
Oh, take a sharp left here.

[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:09.120]
I mean, it's so it's just so preposterous and it's in New York, no less.

[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.400]
But there's nobody on the streets.

[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:13.780]
There's no cars parked alongside the curb.

[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.560]
There's just all these empty streets.

[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.880]
There's no traffic in the middle of the day.

[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:22.220]
Just coincidentally, there happens to be no traffic and he's flooring it.

[01:43:24.900 --> 01:43:27.100]
I don't want to say it's just a little bit ludicrous.

[01:43:27.300 --> 01:43:27.480]
Okay.

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.200]
Just a little bit outrageous.

[01:43:29.460 --> 01:43:30.760]
The whole premise and everything.

[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:31.380]
Yeah.

[01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:34.380]
And then the best one of the best parts of the movie.

[01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:35.300]
I'll spoil it for you.

[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:37.800]
Because I'll avoid the wasting your time seeing it.

[01:43:38.420 --> 01:43:44.080]
Is when he takes this, this, this war, this marine hero who's now a daughtering fool.

[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:45.980]
And they take him in the limo.

[01:43:46.340 --> 01:43:50.860]
And Chris O'Donnell's sitting outside in limo while he's in the, the whorehouse trying to get laid and he can't get it up.

[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.920]
And comes out real sad, you know.

[01:43:56.900 --> 01:44:00.200]
That, that to me was one, I think that was very appropriate for the whole ambiance.

[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:01.800]
Awful.

[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:02.860]
Just brutal.

[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.120]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.380]
Last night was the MTV Movie Awards.

[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:12.000]
It was?

[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:12.920]
Yeah.

[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.880]
They've been replaying it for a week.

[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:16.940]
Oh, in other words, it's a week old.

[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:17.360]
Yeah.

[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:20.340]
Like I said, last night MTV showed the movie awards again.

[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:22.440]
I thought it was actually a, oh, what the hell do I know?

[01:44:22.720 --> 01:44:22.860]
Right.

[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:24.340]
They actually had some funny pieces.

[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.400]
Oh, I didn't see a funny piece.

[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:32.060]
I saw a part where they were trying to be funny with Will Smith and I forget who the other shfarter was on it with him.

[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:33.720]
And it was so pathetic.

[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:37.740]
It was the comedy movie award and then luckily Austin Powers won it.

[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.840]
Mike Myers, which is great.

[01:44:40.300 --> 01:44:46.120]
But they were trying to be funny and the funny thing was that they both set a line and then he said July 18th.

[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:46.320]
Right.

[01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:47.340]
Yeah.

[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.220]
Did you see that?

[01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:48.960]
Yeah, I saw that part.

[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:50.180]
And that was, and then we're yorking up.

[01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:55.200]
Oh, my God.

[01:44:55.320 --> 01:44:56.640]
Will Smith marries Laura.

[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:00.000]
He makes me gag up the food that I've eaten years ago.

[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:01.920]
Oh, for a scud missile while they're both on stage.

[01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.180]
Oh, my God.

[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:04.200]
Jesus.

[01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:04.940]
Good God.

[01:45:05.060 --> 01:45:07.880]
All my, and of course if you say that, that makes your racist if you don't like Will Smith.

[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:09.800]
I don't dislike him because he's black.

[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:11.660]
I love Morgan Freeman.

[01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:15.840]
I love Denzel Washington, although I can't tell him from the other even a one's old enough to be the other one's grandpa.

[01:45:16.100 --> 01:45:18.580]
But, uh, but, oh, Will Smith.

[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:20.160]
Then you'd really enjoy seeing him.

[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:21.600]
I'm going to be in the next six degrees of separation starring.

[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:23.440]
Will Smith.

[01:45:24.500 --> 01:45:26.380]
Oh, gag me with a prune.

[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:30.020]
Here's a call from Bokas speaking of prunes.

[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:30.280]
Hello.

[01:45:34.120 --> 01:45:34.740]
Good one.

[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:35.140]
Okay.

[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.200]
That was an elk whistle.

[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:40.180]
That must have been Mo with the phone stuck up his leg.

[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:40.660]
Don't bag.

[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:41.220]
Mo phone.

[01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:42.700]
The mo phone.

[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:43.300]
Oh, don't forget.

[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:44.600]
Get to our website, please.

[01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:46.420]
All I'm already going to vote.

[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:47.360]
The new poll is up there.

[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:47.760]
Look at this.

[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.300]
There's going to be a lot of choices on here.

[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.780]
I'm going to vote for the very first one because I'm the one that stuck it on there.

[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:53.420]
Eli Wallack.

[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:54.440]
I don't care what you say.

[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:58.000]
He may slice the loan, look like a Gregory Peck.

[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.360]
He, at least in that movie.

[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:03.200]
I'm not saying Eli Wallack was always a bad actor, but that performance.

[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:06.740]
It was just mind blowing.

[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:08.640]
Please eat the cannoli faster.

[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.660]
Eli eat a couple of them.

[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:10.120]
They're really good.

[01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:11.340]
Okay.

[01:46:11.380 --> 01:46:13.320]
We got some votes on there already, but just a smattering.

[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:14.160]
The new poll is up.

[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:16.240]
The worst acting performance.

[01:46:16.240 --> 01:46:20.640]
I'm saying again, don't confuse the worst actor or actress, which isn't necessarily so.

[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:24.280]
Because you sure as hell wouldn't say Eli Wallack is the worst actor in history by far.

[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:24.900]
No, no.

[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.980]
But in that particular performance we make an exception.

[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:30.120]
It was just indescribable.

[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:34.740]
And Sophia, you're almost, I mean, even though I put her on there, she's got a couple of votes.

[01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.560]
You're almost reluctant because she's not a real actress anyway.

[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.460]
She just happened to be right there with a family.

[01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:41.420]
Right.

[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.340]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:44.580]
Hello.

[01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:45.460]
Hello.

[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:50.100]
I just wanted to tell you that the name of the obnoxious Jewish guy is Richard Benjamin.

[01:46:50.620 --> 01:46:52.560]
Richard Benjamin, he makes me sick.

[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:54.640]
He made me sick too and many things.

[01:46:54.900 --> 01:47:00.240]
But I wanted to ask you, what is the name of that British actor that's in a lot of things.

[01:47:00.300 --> 01:47:03.560]
He was in that like Rio de Janeiro movie and he was like Michael Cain.

[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:06.080]
Michael Cain, his worst performance ever.

[01:47:06.260 --> 01:47:08.200]
Not that he's a horrible actor, but he's a great actor.

[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:09.660]
He's a great actor.

[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:14.100]
But when he tried to play a southerner in hurry sundown many, many years ago,

[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:15.260]
it was a southerly accident.

[01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:16.600]
It was unbelievable.

[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.160]
It was a horrible performance.

[01:47:18.540 --> 01:47:19.280]
I won't put it down.

[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:20.520]
Okay.

[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.900]
I mean, a lot of people are going to remember that though.

[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:23.560]
Okay.

[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:23.960]
You're welcome.

[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.060]
One is good enough.

[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:25.580]
Thanks a lot.

[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:25.980]
All right.

[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:26.380]
You're welcome.

[01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:26.640]
Hi.

[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:28.240]
Michael Cain and sundown.

[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.480]
I see the bad accents, I mean, forget about it, the whole movie, which I was reading a review on.

[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:35.760]
What's that Robin Williams' main statement movie?

[01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:37.800]
Good little hunting.

[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:39.480]

[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:44.000]
And aside from the fact that Robin Williams eventually breaks into his usual stale routine,

[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:50.100]
aside from that fact, the soft Boston accents are so bad in there.

[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:52.720]
I think that's in my big bone book, the bone book.

[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:55.740]
It says, well, Matt Damon's bone is so bad in there.

[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:58.720]
Speaking about Michael Cain movie, I do like Matt Damon Lato.

[01:47:59.180 --> 01:47:59.420]
Yes.

[01:47:59.460 --> 01:47:59.960]
I think I got a weiner.

[01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.200]
You got a weiner?

[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.220]
Jaws IV.

[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.920]
I forgot what the woman's name is.

[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:07.540]
The mother of all the jaws is in Jaws IV.

[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:09.180]
She's the shark mother?

[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:11.260]
Well, no.

[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.720]
Mama shark.

[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:13.600]
Mama shark.

[01:48:13.780 --> 01:48:13.780]

[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:18.320]
I'm going to find out her name, but that has to be one of the worst performances by any actor.

[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:18.820]
Okay.

[01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:19.520]
One moment please.

[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:21.820]
Jaws IV.

[01:48:23.020 --> 01:48:23.280]
20.

[01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:25.240]
Now, she and all the jaws is?

[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:25.780]
Yes.

[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:26.760]
Oh.

[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.960]
Here's the 25th anniversary collectors edition when you like maybe George will buy it for you.

[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.840]

Are you a terrorist who started paying outrageous prices for your tools of one-time destruction?

[01:50:42.300 --> 01:50:45.360]
Think of the crazy, optimistic scout terrorism warehouse.

[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:52.280]

Oh, and before we get to that, the only female I find on the list of characters, Lorraine Gary.

[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:30.320]
Is that her?

[01:52:30.560 --> 01:52:30.940]
That's her.

[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:31.680]

So we put that on there.

[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:34.640]

[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.020]

[01:52:37.020 --> 01:52:37.880]
Got it for you.

[01:52:38.220 --> 01:52:38.640]
Thank you.

[01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:39.360]

Shaquille O'Neal in Kazam has got 10.

[01:52:54.680 --> 01:52:55.760]
Well, I'm sure glad I missed that.

[01:52:56.700 --> 01:52:59.760]
But Sophia Coppola on Godfather 3 has got 6 already.

[01:53:01.080 --> 01:53:02.120]
Dad, dad.

[01:53:05.020 --> 01:53:14.500]
I mean, it's like most of the other people in that movie were acting, except for her, Eli Wallach and George Hamilton, the third or fourth or whatever he is.

[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:14.820]
Okay.

[01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:16.260]
Oh my God.

[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:18.860]
Sophia's got 6.

[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:20.780]
Can't or Reeves in the Matrix 5.

[01:53:21.380 --> 01:53:23.340]
Eli Wallach got Father 3's got 4.

[01:53:23.500 --> 01:53:23.940]
Let's hear it.

[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:24.120]
Oh!

[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.000]
That's my choice.

[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:28.180]

We're just getting started.

[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:38.540]
Just getting our feet wet.

[01:53:39.540 --> 01:53:40.100]
Cross over.

[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:42.700]
I beg your pardon?

[01:53:43.780 --> 01:53:44.840]
The move on to the Ross roads.

[01:53:45.200 --> 01:53:45.980]
But who might have?

[01:53:45.980 --> 01:53:47.900]
Well, it says, Krunna, whose mistake is that?

[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:50.100]
Is that Beener Boy's mistake or Eric's mistake?

[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:54.000]
I have a feeling it's Beener Boy.

[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:55.860]
Probably was.

[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:56.900]
Is it your mistake?

[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:57.900]
I'm sure it was.

[01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:00.820]
Okay, well, there's one pair of tickets that just...

[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:03.340]
Here's Pompato Beach. Hello.

[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:07.560]
Pompato Beach.

[01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:08.820]
Speak to me.

[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:08.980]
Hello.

[01:54:09.300 --> 01:54:09.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:10.800]
Yes, I am.

[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:11.780]
Okay.

[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.060]
If they haven't called us in here and just seen Beetman and Steve.

[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:17.960]
What's the name of the movie?

[01:54:18.620 --> 01:54:18.860]
Steve.

[01:54:19.420 --> 01:54:19.720]
Speed.

[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.400]
Just seen Beetman.

[01:54:22.900 --> 01:54:23.140]
Okay.

[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:24.020]
We got you down, pal.

[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.120]
And just seen Beetman wasn't seen.

[01:54:25.540 --> 01:54:26.060]
Hey, up the mill.

[01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:27.120]
Can you do something for me?

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.040]
Anything you like.

[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:31.640]
Can you play two joints because the weekend.

[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:33.340]
Okay, you got him, man.

[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:34.820]
He just obviously already smoked his.

[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.080]
Because he wasn't in that movie.

[01:54:37.280 --> 01:54:38.100]
No, Sandra Bullock.

[01:54:38.820 --> 01:54:39.540]
Sandra Bullock.

[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:40.100]
Sandra Bullock.

[01:54:40.780 --> 01:54:40.900]
Sandra Bullock.

[01:54:41.020 --> 01:54:41.800]
Let's not pick on her.

[01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:43.600]
How could she have been done a bad performance?

[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:45.140]
It was just fine.

[01:54:45.460 --> 01:54:46.100]
A cutesy fine performance.

[01:54:46.620 --> 01:54:47.520]
There was nothing wrong with it.

[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:50.240]
You know, something that is always the word that comes to my mind.

[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:52.080]
When I think of Sandra Bullock, cutesy.

[01:54:52.220 --> 01:54:54.460]
And she was even in a movie with Ben Affleck.

[01:54:54.680 --> 01:54:57.540]
The wooden stone-faced Ben Affleck.

[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:58.840]
And that movie was kind of cute.

[01:55:00.040 --> 01:55:01.420]
I don't know what the name of that movie was.

[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:02.340]
You know what I'm talking about?

[01:55:04.380 --> 01:55:05.140]
Forces of nature.

[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:06.380]
Was that it?

[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:07.460]
I don't know any way.

[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:07.920]
I'm just trying to say it.

[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:09.120]
But it was okay.

[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.980]
And not because of him, but because he's cute.

[01:55:11.060 --> 01:55:11.700]
I just like her.

[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.560]
And what was that movie that she was in?

[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:14.580]
I can never think of the name of her.

[01:55:14.720 --> 01:55:15.500]
She was like in Chicago.

[01:55:15.920 --> 01:55:18.660]
And she met the guy on the guy that almost got killed on the subway.

[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:19.620]
Oh, I don't know.

[01:55:19.660 --> 01:55:20.360]
He wanted to call him.

[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:21.060]
Yeah.

[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:22.560]
And she waited and waited.

[01:55:22.580 --> 01:55:23.460]
And he came out of a coma.

[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.960]
And he had him amnesia.

[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:27.480]
And he thought that she was his wife or fiance or whatever.

[01:55:27.580 --> 01:55:27.880]
Remember that?

[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:28.600]
Her whole family.

[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:30.020]
His whole family thought that.

[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:30.600]
Right.

[01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:32.060]
I forgot the name of the movie.

[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:33.160]
Oh, no, no, it was a cute movie.

[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:34.180]
I like Sandra Bullock.

[01:55:34.220 --> 01:55:35.100]
Let's not pick on her.

[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:35.480]
Okay.

[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:37.260]
I would be.

[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:39.680]
Well, like you said, last time maybe smoked a little bit too much.

[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:39.920]
Okay.

[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:41.360]
Maybe he got into some bad crap.

[01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:47.300]
Some unrighteous crap as opposed to the really righteous crap like Damon was getting.

[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:49.980]
They had a pretty good business going there for a while.

[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:50.260]
You notice?

[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:51.780]
No.

[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:52.320]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:54.420]
See, I just had a store point with George.

[01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.040]
What?

[01:55:55.620 --> 01:56:00.260]
When I said that Damon and the Harry had a pretty good business going there.

[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:01.140]
Oh, yeah, they did.

[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:02.880]
But.

[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:04.460]
But yeah, greed kills.

[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:07.220]
That shoebox started getting in fear and in fear and in fear.

[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:07.940]
Yeah, that's you.

[01:56:08.060 --> 01:56:14.300]
I mean, if you were like selling drugs, wouldn't you like, and do we ever figure out where it is that they were hiding at shoebox in the closet?

[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:16.400]
Was it a post office box?

[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:16.800]
Yeah.

[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:18.600]
I know it was not in a house or something.

[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:19.840]
It was like in a something.

[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:22.340]
Oh, geez.

[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:24.000]
Everybody knows.

[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:24.780]
Not good.

[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:34.440]
I want to clarify once again because George as usual, as you'd expect, if you were to be in a house, you'd be in a house.

[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:34.440]

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:04.120]

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:04.120]

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:04.120]

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:06.660]

I didn't see it with that voice all day.

[02:01:04.060 --> 02:01:04.080]
Oh, let's go.

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.080]

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.080]

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.080]

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.080]

[02:01:04.080 --> 02:01:04.080]

[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:13.500]
I'm sure has a interesting package, you know what?

[02:01:15.720 --> 02:01:18.320]
Look, look, I'm sorry, I'm just quoting him from this morning.

[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.740]
His balls ain't swinging yet though, you gonna work on that?

[02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:24.960]
It's a complicated thing but yeah, he's working on it.

[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.260]
Because we got a real battle going on here, we got Squirley Mo against Mozo.

[02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:32.320]
In fact, you know something maybe on Monday, we'll have like our first year we do the

[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:32.780]
early pull.

[02:01:33.800 --> 02:01:37.040]
Yeah, we'll have a runoff on that and find out which one they liked the better.

[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:43.480]
Squirley Mo, I think that likes Squirley Mo a little bit better when his packets are swinging

[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:43.760]
around.

[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.080]
He'll be a little bit more in your face.

[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:55.720]
As Joe Castello might say, don't forget Joe is out at Verizon Wireless till 2pm, 3.29

[02:01:55.720 --> 02:01:58.720]
I think I've heard Rod Miami beat you look for the QA and Van, he's got some prizes, some

[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:02.960]
Marlon tickets and he'll be just tickled that to see and say all kinds of nasty things

[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:05.760]
about me since I'm giving his dolphin tickets to Beener Boy this year.

[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:10.480]
And especially considering how ugly Beener Boy is the fact that I'm being generous enough

[02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:10.920]
to do that.

[02:02:13.020 --> 02:02:14.880]
Because I'm always the one who gets accused, you know.

[02:02:15.260 --> 02:02:18.420]
Oh, and also don't forget today is the last one over the weekend but they won't be

[02:02:18.420 --> 02:02:19.100]
able to hear about it.

[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:23.120]
First, remind them about the hot couples contest because the deadline to get your pictures

[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:25.780]
and any arrangers.com is 10am on Monday.

[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:30.240]
And then next week we'll be doing the voting all week long, put the pictures up on the

[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:32.160]
website and people can vote for the hottest couple of them all.

[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:34.920]
And we got about a dozen, something like that, they're about to.

[02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:38.560]
And there's some pretty interesting people on there but I will say this, it's not like

[02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:40.340]
the first, the last one, right.

[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:44.160]
We had the models as a couple who you know right off the bat that they were either going

[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:45.900]
to win or maybe be second at the worst.

[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:48.380]
Here it's kind of like a level playing field.

[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:53.180]
Oh my God, it's engineer Holyo, how you doing amigo?

[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:55.540]
I'm doing good, Neil, how are you?

[02:02:55.900 --> 02:02:59.600]
I'm doing fine except for the fact I'm coming back for a few days but I'll be out of there.

[02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:02.360]
I heard you had phone trouble so I was calling.

[02:03:05.760 --> 02:03:06.640]
You'd be the guy.

[02:03:07.300 --> 02:03:08.500]
What are you doing these days?

[02:03:09.180 --> 02:03:13.080]
I was just calling to number one, say goodbye to you.

[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:17.760]
And number two, tell you what a pleasure was working all that time with you.

[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.680]
Can we already do this?

[02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:23.360]
Well, not on the air.

[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:24.900]
Oh, he didn't do it on the air, okay.

[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:29.760]
No, and let you know I'll be moving on to Phoenix, I picked up a job there.

[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.360]
Excellent, beautiful, anything anywhere that gets out of South Florida can only be moving up in the world.

[02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:36.900]
Oh, you don't understand how happy I am.

[02:03:38.760 --> 02:03:41.560]
I think I do.

[02:03:43.820 --> 02:03:48.920]
Anyways, I just wanted to call and let you know I appreciate it, everything you ever did for me.

[02:03:49.260 --> 02:03:53.460]
And it was great working with you and George and even Carlos.

[02:03:54.140 --> 02:03:55.780]
Well, we appreciate everything you did for us.

[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:57.220]
This was an engineer who really cared.

[02:03:57.460 --> 02:04:00.700]
He's one of the few people ever walked in that building who cared about doing a good job.

[02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:05.460]
And this studio up here is a testament to you because you did a lot of the work on it there toward the end.

[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.880]
Well, it was my pleasure and as always, I'm proud to do whatever I can.

[02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:16.280]
As a matter of fact, in honor of this call, Julio, after this show, I'm going to go out and write your name and the alley.

[02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:20.800]
Oh, do you think you can also maybe get a dance for me at the Zanzibar?

[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:24.160]
For 120 bucks.

[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.200]
Yeah.

[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:27.300]
Good luck, Julio. I've been hearing from you.

[02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:28.640]
Thanks, Julio. Take care.

[02:04:28.740 --> 02:04:29.640]
Bye, Julio.

[02:04:29.640 --> 02:04:30.220]
Bye-bye.

[02:04:30.780 --> 02:04:31.360]
Good guy.

[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:34.420]
See? To show you, we're not about your hard-hearted bastards.

[02:04:34.660 --> 02:04:36.180]
There's a really good guy, Julio.

[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.620]
Engineering, Julio. We got a job in the finish. He's getting out of South Florida.

[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:45.060]
He was up here for a couple of days. He discovered every nook and cranny and alley and he's an interesting guy.

[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:52.860]
We miss him already and look at all the problems we had there immediately upon his following.

[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:56.680]
But now we got to fix it. You know, fix it's okay. What does he work about one day a month?

[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:57.820]
Oh, he's here.

[02:04:58.320 --> 02:04:59.920]
You see? Fix it's actually in the building?

[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:00.260]
Yes.

[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.720]
Well, that's something.

[02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:08.580]
5.670560, 0.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:05:10.580 --> 02:05:13.880]
Shaq, I don't think they're going to catch your Shaq. Although Sofia's on his ass.

[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:17.640]
Shaq has got 22 Shaqille O'Neill for Kazam.

[02:05:18.340 --> 02:05:19.640]
Worst acting performance ever.

[02:05:20.700 --> 02:05:22.780]
Sofia's got 13 for Godfather 3.

[02:05:23.280 --> 02:05:25.080]
Bode Derek tries any 8 man 9.

[02:05:26.140 --> 02:05:30.520]
See, I mean, and that's interesting because ordinarily you wouldn't want to be picking on Bode Derek and Brittany and people.

[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:32.740]
It still says crossover on my thing here.

[02:05:33.500 --> 02:05:37.640]
Isn't the name of a cross dresser? I mean, cross your heart.

[02:05:38.220 --> 02:05:39.160]
And hope to die.

[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:40.100]
But in better news.

[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:40.940]
Yes.

[02:05:41.420 --> 02:05:42.700]
Swinging going on on the website.

[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:45.500]
Oh, no.

[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:51.540]
Everybody in the audience immediately is going to have to take a look on our website.

[02:05:52.160 --> 02:05:58.280]
And there it is right underneath the flame of where it's flaming, which I think is appropriate.

[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.280]
Right underneath the plug for the hot couples contest.

[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:04.420]
There it is.

[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.120]
It's Mo and his swinging nuts.

[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:08.100]
Oh, wow.

[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:13.560]
You know something I'd be hard pressed to tell you which one I like better.

[02:06:14.240 --> 02:06:15.560]
Squirly Mo or Mozo.

[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:22.340]
Because Mozo morse from the bald headed the toothless Mo into like the clown, Mozo the clown.

[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:26.500]
But swinging Mo just he's like kind of standing there, but his nuts swinging a breeze.

[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:28.440]
Yeah, I like that.

[02:06:30.200 --> 02:06:31.500]
Look, look.

[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.580]
Maybe that's what he maybe had a premonition.

[02:06:36.340 --> 02:06:40.720]
5.6705.60, 0.560 on EAT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:06:40.940 --> 02:06:42.660]
Be sure and check out Squirly Mo over the weekend.

[02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:44.120]
Okay, you will not be disappointed.

[02:06:44.620 --> 02:06:46.080]
He's a real swinger.

[02:06:46.900 --> 02:06:47.920]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[02:06:47.920 --> 02:06:48.200]
Hello.

[02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:49.720]
Hello Neil.

[02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:50.580]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:51.100 --> 02:06:53.280]
Yeah, the worst acting performance ever.

[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.900]
I didn't see the movie, but just seeing the previews was enough.

[02:06:56.100 --> 02:07:00.160]
Per seastool and hebert was vanilla ice and cool as ice.

[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:02.180]
And any movie Madonna did.

[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:04.760]
Okay, we got you down, man.

[02:07:05.340 --> 02:07:09.780]
Hey, and also you had a couple of weeks ago about the most underrated actor.

[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:11.260]
Yeah, I see Steve McQueen.

[02:07:11.380 --> 02:07:14.060]
Because that movie, Papillon, I saw when I was seven.

[02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.380]
I must have seen it like 30 times since.

[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:17.300]
About 30, yes.

[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:18.040]
And it's a great movie.

[02:07:18.380 --> 02:07:25.180]
Yeah, I had a fight with the co-workers of the Existing War arguing, which was the best decade in movies.

[02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:26.780]
And I was telling him the 70s.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.180]
And he was telling me the 90s.

[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.660]
You know, I had 90s.

[02:07:30.020 --> 02:07:30.780]
Oh, man.

[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:32.000]
I told him, look, look.

[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:34.640]
And you know, I'm the same age as George.

[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:39.140]
I said, look, Godfather, the French connection, network,

[02:07:39.140 --> 02:07:42.260]
the exorcist, Papillon.

[02:07:43.080 --> 02:07:45.380]
I mean, those were down for glory.

[02:07:45.760 --> 02:07:47.800]
So, you know, those were great movies.

[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:48.360]
Yeah.

[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:50.000]
And sometimes you can have a pro.

[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.400]
It's the what kind of tape people got out there.

[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:54.600]
You know, which was the best decade in movies?

[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:56.380]
That is a great, yeah.

[02:07:56.660 --> 02:07:57.520]
Thanks a lot, Palli.

[02:07:57.880 --> 02:07:58.380]
Thank you, sir.

[02:07:58.540 --> 02:07:58.760]
Bye-bye.

[02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.880]
We got you down, vanilla ice.

[02:08:01.020 --> 02:08:01.640]
Did you get into the movie?

[02:08:02.740 --> 02:08:04.740]
Well, you know, he made a movie, he made some great music.

[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:08.320]
5.670560.

[02:08:08.460 --> 02:08:09.840]
He was no, will, Smith.

[02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:10.540]
I'll tell you that.

[02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:12.300]
Oh, he just, I just see him and I get angry.

[02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:14.160]
You know, I don't begrudge anybody.

[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.720]
Rosie O'Donnell, I mean, just get sick when I see her.

[02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:18.880]
But I don't begrudge anybody anything, okay?

[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:20.820]
Because life is short and you do the best you can.

[02:08:21.160 --> 02:08:23.600]
And if you're lucky enough to fall into a bucket of crap, grab it.

[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:25.960]
You know, or like the guy in the trans spotting said,

[02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.300]
if you fall into a bucket of crap, fish around in it.

[02:08:29.560 --> 02:08:33.380]
I still cannot believe the fact that you're trying to encourage me to watch the rest of that.

[02:08:33.380 --> 02:08:34.780]
It ain't going to happen.

[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.200]
It is not going to happen.

[02:08:37.660 --> 02:08:39.260]
Oh, my goodness.

[02:08:40.340 --> 02:08:44.200]
So what was the term that the Bean of Boy used before he's a fecal freak?

[02:08:46.100 --> 02:08:46.800]
That's what he used?

[02:08:47.260 --> 02:08:48.700]
Well, he sure came to the right place to work.

[02:08:48.800 --> 02:08:49.320]
I'll tell you that.

[02:08:49.700 --> 02:08:50.960]
Because that's our motto with QAM.

[02:08:51.340 --> 02:08:51.940]
We'll full a Schmidt.

[02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:54.880]
5.670560.

[02:08:55.120 --> 02:08:56.880]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:57.400]
Here's Miami.

[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:57.740]
Hello.

[02:08:57.740 --> 02:08:58.400]
Hi, Neil.

[02:08:58.940 --> 02:08:59.280]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:05.920]
Make sure you stay clear of the nuts fecal wise.

[02:09:06.540 --> 02:09:06.820]
Okay.

[02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:07.280]
All right.

[02:09:07.460 --> 02:09:07.800]
Here we go.

[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:08.700]
I got a couple.

[02:09:09.060 --> 02:09:10.660]
Tom Green, Freddie got fingered.

[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:13.000]
Oh, bad.

[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:15.300]
Yeah, what a big smash that was.

[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:16.620]
Mariah Carey and Glitter.

[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.100]
Yeah, let's put Tom Green down just out of spite.

[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:24.300]
And just for the road, the rock, the mummy returns.

[02:09:24.300 --> 02:09:31.320]
Now, I got the worst performance by an actor as Jesus Christ.

[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:34.240]
And that's technically Jesus Christ superstar.

[02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:36.820]
I hate you, George.

[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.380]
I know.

[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:42.140]
Just don't get all emotional.

[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:43.160]
Let's say the same guy.

[02:09:43.680 --> 02:09:44.600]
No kidding.

[02:09:44.780 --> 02:09:47.320]
I love this.

[02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:48.940]
This is 420560.

[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.600]
You ain't way.

[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:51.120]
You ain't way.

[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:51.120]

[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:54.900]
I hate you, George.

[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.080]
I hate you, George.

[02:09:57.460 --> 02:09:59.500]
I hate you, George.

[02:09:59.500 --> 02:10:00.320]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.040]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:03.240]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:03.920]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:04.120 --> 02:10:04.440]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:05.100]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:06.320]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:07.260]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:07.260 --> 02:10:08.580]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:09.520]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.900]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:13.460 --> 02:10:13.800]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:13.800 --> 02:10:15.400]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:15.920]

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:15.920]

[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:15.920]

[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:16.180]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:16.180]

[02:10:16.180 --> 02:10:16.240]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:16.720]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:16.720]

[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:16.720]

[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:16.720]

[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:17.600]
I hate you, George.

[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:22.320]
Oh, Morning

[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:23.360]
Hi, this is Hillary Clinton.

[02:10:23.860 --> 02:10:25.180]
I hope you run out to buy my book.

[02:10:25.300 --> 02:10:27.720]
You won't be too shocked to discover I have a fat-

[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:28.000]
Cheze.

[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:47.160]
Well, if you buy my book you can read all about the affair I had with Santa

[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:48.720]
your burnhard and our lunchiles.

[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:50.740]
Now, I wasn't born a Democrat.

[02:10:51.180 --> 02:10:53.120]
I switched parties after looking in the mirror

[02:10:53.120 --> 02:10:54.800]
and seeing the body of Tipo Nio.

[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:58.020]
So by my book, now, because I can never have enough.

[02:10:58.440 --> 02:11:00.440]
If you order a copy today, I will personally

[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:02.980]
autograph the all-newed scratches, Nip Holdout.

[02:11:03.420 --> 02:11:04.460]
So we should...

[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:08.040]
And you're almost slipped up today.

[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:10.160]
Who what?

[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.000]
You almost let me slip up.

[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:13.980]
I haven't read my sentence from a Hillary book yet.

[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:15.420]
Damn it.

[02:11:15.420 --> 02:11:16.860]
But I just came up with a good idea.

[02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:18.320]
See, I'm not going to schlep this back with me

[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:18.880]
when I come back.

[02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:20.000]
So let's people...

[02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.500]
No, well, we'll keep them on the edge of their seat for a whole week.

[02:11:23.420 --> 02:11:23.740]
But...

[02:11:23.740 --> 02:11:25.460]
See, I'm not going to do it at the beginning of the show

[02:11:25.460 --> 02:11:26.560]
because that makes it predictable.

[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:28.700]
Plus, there is no beginning of the show anymore.

[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:30.380]
Now that Parallels here, because, you know,

[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:31.820]
we do that crossover for about an hour.

[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:33.900]
But anyway, here's to...

[02:11:33.900 --> 02:11:34.800]
Today, this is what?

[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:35.620]
About the fifth sentence.

[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:37.700]
Hillary says,

[02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:39.480]
I was free to make choices unavailable

[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:41.480]
to past generations of women in my own country

[02:11:41.480 --> 02:11:44.140]
and inconceivable to many women in the world today.

[02:11:44.660 --> 02:11:45.380]
That's it.

[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:48.060]
Aren't you really getting into it now?

[02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:51.420]
This is enough to make you want to just rush right out

[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:53.520]
and pick up two, three copies and give it to everybody, you know?

[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:54.920]
Or just rush right out?

[02:11:56.100 --> 02:11:57.980]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[02:11:58.600 --> 02:11:59.400]
Pound five, sixty.

[02:11:59.800 --> 02:12:01.680]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:02.180]
Now you're talking.

[02:12:06.900 --> 02:12:09.060]
Let's see, don't ever take that off the side.

[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:11.440]
It's hysterical and infectious as Richard Evil.

[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:14.360]
He's talking about the swinging mo.

[02:12:15.820 --> 02:12:17.240]
Instead of squirreling mo,

[02:12:17.440 --> 02:12:18.780]
what we are called, that swinging mo.

[02:12:19.960 --> 02:12:20.600]
What do you think?

[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.220]
He's swinging it or...

[02:12:23.220 --> 02:12:23.860]
I'm infectious.

[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:24.820]
Nutty mo.

[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:28.360]
And you notice they just keep swinging back and forth

[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.200]
and back and forth.

[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:29.900]
Hey, kids, stop.

[02:12:30.440 --> 02:12:31.820]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:32.960]
Hey, Carlos, look.

[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:36.160]
Now you have to have embellished that story.

[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:37.600]
That can't be for real.

[02:12:38.740 --> 02:12:39.280]
Was that?

[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:42.060]
I'm talking about Benerboy and Paul is in that story

[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:44.240]
about his encounter in the tea room with Mo this morning.

[02:12:44.480 --> 02:12:46.000]
Maybe he said, look, one less time.

[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.480]
You sure he didn't say, look at this?

[02:12:49.580 --> 02:12:50.380]
I would have left.

[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.200]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[02:12:53.480 --> 02:12:57.180]
Pound five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:59.040]
Maybe he was pointing at his bag, you don't know.

[02:13:00.700 --> 02:13:01.820]
Here's a call from Lauderdale.

[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:02.120]
Hello.

[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:06.040]
Lauderdale.

[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:08.560]
Going once.

[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:11.000]
Going twice.

[02:13:12.540 --> 02:13:12.900]
Gone.

[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:15.400]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty.

[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:19.040]
Pound five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:20.100]
You know what is happening?

[02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:21.920]
I've let him mark it off of the phone

[02:13:21.920 --> 02:13:23.520]
and it rushes to their computers.

[02:13:24.420 --> 02:13:25.760]
And you know what, I don't blame him.

[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:27.620]
In fact, I gotta look at it one more time.

[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:32.060]
I just gotta get my fix of swinging Mo.

[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:33.540]
Come on, let's go.

[02:13:33.840 --> 02:13:35.220]
And you know something, see, there's a little bit slow

[02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:37.460]
getting on here because two damn many people.

[02:13:37.460 --> 02:13:37.820]
Hmm.

[02:13:39.700 --> 02:13:41.720]
Are you picking on Eric again?

[02:13:41.860 --> 02:13:42.180]
Good.

[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:43.060]
Good.

[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.360]
Get him all psychotic.

[02:13:45.900 --> 02:13:46.520]
Don't take much.

[02:13:47.320 --> 02:13:48.300]
Gallery of the Weird.

[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:51.120]
Here you go from the twisted minds of our talented listeners

[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:53.720]
and here you have on the left, Squirley Mo

[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:55.120]
and her swingin'

[02:13:57.720 --> 02:13:59.120]
back and forth, two and a throw

[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:01.500]
and Mozo on the right.

[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:03.740]
Squirley Mo and Mozo.

[02:14:08.260 --> 02:14:11.140]
And the best news of it all is that guilty is finally wise.

[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:12.440]
And he hauled that.

[02:14:12.720 --> 02:14:13.900]
He's evidently disappeared.

[02:14:14.740 --> 02:14:16.780]
Maybe he's down here in that pit with Sheridan in that rat.

[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:19.480]
What a shame.

[02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:21.740]
Only on passions could the sick minds who write that show

[02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:24.580]
put a beautiful, beautiful young lady like Sheridan down

[02:14:24.580 --> 02:14:26.900]
in that pit with the rats nodding around at her feet.

[02:14:27.180 --> 02:14:27.840]
Now those wouldn't be.

[02:14:28.300 --> 02:14:29.360]
Gambian rats, would they?

[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:30.260]
They might be.

[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.820]
Maybe they're like just the Chia pets.

[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:33.660]
God, George loves saying that word.

[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:34.880]
Gambian rats.

[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:36.300]
He likes something about that.

[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:37.080]
I don't know what it is.

[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.860]
Has a sound to it.

[02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:41.400]
Worst performance is this factor.

[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:43.200]
Keanu Reeves and the remake of Dracula.

[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:45.440]
Valley Boy Action,

[02:14:45.580 --> 02:14:47.980]
Impiri Custom Phil Teeters with Embarrassed Laughter.

[02:14:48.260 --> 02:14:49.240]
Oh, we gotta put that down.

[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:52.620]
Keanu Reeves and just everything.

[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:54.940]
Are you listening to me?

[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:55.960]
Yes sir.

[02:14:56.420 --> 02:14:57.360]
Keanu Reeves and Dracula.

[02:14:57.760 --> 02:14:58.300]
We can't put that.

[02:14:58.480 --> 02:14:59.720]
Do you have any idea how many movies

[02:14:59.720 --> 02:15:00.620]
some of these people have made?

[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:02.560]
When you go and do a search on there,

[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:04.460]
like I was looking for that sonopter movie

[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:06.040]
which it turned out was kissing banded.

[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:08.540]
He's made about 185,000 movies.

[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:09.280]
Oh wow.

[02:15:09.580 --> 02:15:10.740]
We don't have time for that crap.

[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:11.320]
Wow.

[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:12.860]
Besides, they just started off horses

[02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:14.040]
that want their heads chopped off.

[02:15:14.920 --> 02:15:16.840]
Best vision of the future sci-fi movie,

[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:17.660]
avoid his dog.

[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.360]
You are absolutely correct.

[02:15:19.700 --> 02:15:20.280]
Love that movie.

[02:15:20.740 --> 02:15:22.700]
Very, very young Don Johnson who looked very good

[02:15:22.700 --> 02:15:23.520]
in that movie by the way.

[02:15:23.660 --> 02:15:24.460]
No wonder they were milking.

[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:26.820]
Very clever premise for love.

[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:28.880]
Oh, I guess they assume I haven't seen this.

[02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:30.120]
I talked about that movie for years.

[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:31.720]
I we both did love the art.

[02:15:31.720 --> 02:15:33.920]
Especially me, I love the lack of the ending.

[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:34.420]
It's there.

[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:35.580]
I thought he made a good choice.

[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:36.460]
Put it on.

[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:38.780]
Why Neil hates train spotting?

[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:41.140]
It's a self-loading straight guy thing.

[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:42.420]
What?

[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:43.000]
Hey.

[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:44.980]
So in other words,

[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:45.980]
being a boy like that because you

[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:47.160]
is a self-loading straight guy.

[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:48.160]
I guess.

[02:15:48.660 --> 02:15:50.740]
It says if you like train spotting,

[02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:53.080]
you should see lock stock and two smoke and barrels

[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.120]
has a very stupid title,

[02:15:55.120 --> 02:15:56.880]
but excellent characters and super twisted plot.

[02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:59.440]
It's funny, sad and has fantastic violent scenes.

[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:00.320]
Oh, great.

[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:02.040]
That is good.

[02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:03.340]
But same direct right.

[02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:04.960]
I don't mind the violence.

[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:06.280]
I don't even mind the snatch.

[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:09.480]
OK, but I don't want to see that.

[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:11.460]
Well, no crap and snatch.

[02:16:11.680 --> 02:16:12.880]
You guys snatch next.

[02:16:14.060 --> 02:16:15.240]
Oh, if I got a line for that.

[02:16:16.660 --> 02:16:17.620]
Yeah, what is another?

[02:16:17.740 --> 02:16:18.880]
I'm not I need to do that.

[02:16:18.960 --> 02:16:19.260]
Touching it.

[02:16:19.700 --> 02:16:22.440]
I'm not touching it with your hand or tongue.

[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:24.660]
Another best funny moving violent movie.

[02:16:24.860 --> 02:16:25.360]
Two romance.

[02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:27.560]
It says I like it a lot.

[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:28.060]
I have it.

[02:16:28.180 --> 02:16:30.360]
I like it, but I don't think you'll like it.

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:31.840]
Oh, yeah, put in Tern Tino.

[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:32.940]
It's a Christian Slater.

[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:35.180]
It's really violent and Christian Slater.

[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:35.980]
And you have it.

[02:16:36.100 --> 02:16:36.960]
Yeah, that was good.

[02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:38.680]
It was a gift.

[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:39.340]
Thank you, guys.

[02:16:39.480 --> 02:16:39.800]
Hopefully.

[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:41.340]
And you said you like it.

[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:42.920]
It was all right in spite of him.

[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:44.980]
This is the number one Christian Slater

[02:16:44.980 --> 02:16:45.760]
hater in the world.

[02:16:45.860 --> 02:16:47.080]
I mean, I can take him or leave him.

[02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:48.200]
He doesn't make me nauseous.

[02:16:48.200 --> 02:16:48.820]
What he does to you.

[02:16:48.820 --> 02:16:49.260]
I hate him.

[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.500]
Why is that?

[02:16:51.220 --> 02:16:53.300]
He just I hate his whole act is ambiance.

[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:53.860]
Personality.

[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:54.920]
I'll tell you what.

[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:56.340]
I'll be beginning to dislike a lot.

[02:16:56.580 --> 02:16:57.520]
And that's James Spader.

[02:16:57.740 --> 02:16:58.380]
Oh, I hate him.

[02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.200]
I've hated him for years.

[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:01.540]
Yeah, he started reading again on my nerves.

[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:02.640]
Oh, no.

[02:17:02.660 --> 02:17:05.100]
Anyway, why the masses don't like movies like Magnolia,

[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:06.100]
Network or Memento?

[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:07.700]
If you've never read anything or been anywhere,

[02:17:07.820 --> 02:17:08.840]
if you don't want anything about literature,

[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:10.460]
religion, fine art, history or culture,

[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.240]
then most of it flies right over your head.

[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:14.160]
You miss all the irony and it's boring.

[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:17.240]
Sadly, the only literary illusions that most people can catch today

[02:17:17.240 --> 02:17:19.320]
are about the medical TV shows and commercials.

[02:17:19.980 --> 02:17:21.260]
Oh, like the ones that Book of Grind does.

[02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:26.840]
Oh, this is excellent facts right on target.

[02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:27.640]
Beautiful.

[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:30.500]
And they'll be pleased to know I did not only see a boy

[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:32.920]
in his dog several times, but loved it like crazy.

[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:34.460]
Loved it.

[02:17:35.120 --> 02:17:38.980]
A very lovely Don Johnson, who was really good in that too,

[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:40.820]
was a rest in peace speaking of Magnolia.

[02:17:41.880 --> 02:17:42.840]
Jason Robards.

[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:43.780]
Jason Robards, dead.

[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:44.600]
He was great.

[02:17:45.700 --> 02:17:46.180]
Pardon?

[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:49.340]
On biography last night, another underrated actor, James

[02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:50.780]
Coburn, right?

[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:53.380]
Like we just died a couple of years ago.

[02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:54.020]
He was really good.

[02:17:55.580 --> 02:17:58.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:00.400]
We got a dead ass tie now.

[02:18:00.740 --> 02:18:02.400]
Sophia's red on Shaxe, black ass.

[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:06.960]
The worst acting performance ever in a picture was 28

[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:09.260]
votes of peace for Shaquille O'Neal and Kazan.

[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:10.500]
And Sophia Coppola.

[02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:11.160]
Dead.

[02:18:11.500 --> 02:18:12.440]
In Godfather 3.

[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:13.340]
Dead.

[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:15.980]
Hey, Sophia, dummy up bitch.

[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:18.480]
Look at that.

[02:18:18.480 --> 02:18:19.640]
He pulled to a head again.

[02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:20.440]
That's going to be a battle.

[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:21.760]
That's where the horse races.

[02:18:22.180 --> 02:18:23.480]
Britney Spears in Crossroads.

[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:24.460]
What's the real name of it?

[02:18:25.680 --> 02:18:26.400]
Cross-stressing.

[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:30.440]
13, Bo Derek, Tarzan the 8-man 13.

[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:32.960]
Sylvester Stallone, Ryan Stone 11.

[02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:36.320]
See, I want to say this seriously.

[02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:38.080]
If there's anybody out there in this audience,

[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:39.960]
anywhere in the world who really likes,

[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:41.900]
slides Stallone and thinks that he's a real actor,

[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:43.320]
we'll get you some help, OK?

[02:18:44.220 --> 02:18:44.460]
Get a drink.

[02:18:44.460 --> 02:18:45.180]
I'll take out my collection.

[02:18:46.460 --> 02:18:48.460]
Elizabeth Berkeley and Showgirl's 10.

[02:18:48.860 --> 02:18:50.380]
Eli Waller, Godfather 3.

[02:18:50.660 --> 02:18:51.540]
Eli's hanging in there.

[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:52.140]
He's got...

[02:18:52.140 --> 02:18:52.300]
Yeah.

[02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:55.480]
Slice the low and the specialist 9.

[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:57.040]
Kiano Reeves the Matrix 8.

[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:59.760]
Vin Diesel 8 for the Fast and the Furious.

[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:03.480]
Tom Hanks doing a volcano.

[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:05.520]
You must have sneak that in there when I was looking.

[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:06.960]
No, we talked about it.

[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:07.880]
Did we talk about it?

[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:08.480]
Yeah.

[02:19:08.540 --> 02:19:09.440]
I just agreed with it.

[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:10.500]
We're too bad.

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:12.440]
And then of course, also with 5 votes.

[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:13.080]
Puma!

[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:14.860]
Al Pacino, the centerwoman.

[02:19:15.080 --> 02:19:15.980]
Send me right to the toilet.

[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:17.040]
That's what it sent me.

[02:19:17.980 --> 02:19:19.020]
It is bad.

[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:20.300]
I want you to see it.

[02:19:21.040 --> 02:19:22.200]
I'll tell you what, when I'm there,

[02:19:22.400 --> 02:19:23.700]
I'll buy and bring you a copy.

[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:25.940]
That's how badly I want you both to see it.

[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:28.220]
And then you won't have to take it back

[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.760]
and you won't have any excuses that you got to daily.

[02:19:30.860 --> 02:19:31.320]
I'll watch it.

[02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:33.360]
Watch it that you're a perusal and amusement.

[02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:36.600]
Here's a call from Hollywood.

[02:19:36.800 --> 02:19:36.960]
Hello.

[02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:38.340]
Hey, Neil.

[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:38.820]
How you doing?

[02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:39.740]
Pretty damn good.

[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:40.540]
All right.

[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:44.320]
And how about Dan Moreno in the center of pet detective?

[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:45.520]
That was some ugly work.

[02:19:45.900 --> 02:19:47.420]
Dan Moreno was in a movie?

[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:48.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:50.460]
Wasn't it a Jim Curie movie?

[02:19:50.800 --> 02:19:50.840]
Yeah.

[02:19:51.320 --> 02:19:51.320]

[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:52.620]
Wasn't that it.

[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:55.220]
And Danny Boy was in it.

[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:57.060]
The movie was good, but he wasn't.

[02:19:58.160 --> 02:19:59.140]
OK, let's put it down.

[02:19:59.220 --> 02:19:59.940]
Let's pick on Danny.

[02:20:00.140 --> 02:20:01.780]
If it's good enough for Ferrell, it's good enough for us.

[02:20:02.280 --> 02:20:02.740]
Thank you, Neil.

[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:03.500]
Thanks, Pali.

[02:20:03.800 --> 02:20:04.980]
And let's put down Danny Boy.

[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:05.760]
We like you, Danny.

[02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:07.060]
But you know, you're not perfect.

[02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:08.580]
You got those Batman lips.

[02:20:09.680 --> 02:20:10.300]
You got it?

[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.560]
We got it.

[02:20:11.760 --> 02:20:12.420]
Danny Moreno.

[02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:14.120]
There won't be too many votes for that, because it's just,

[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.220]
you don't pick on Danny.

[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.560]
And Jimmy, you can pick on.

[02:20:19.800 --> 02:20:21.320]
OK, hey, you're talking big game, Jimmy.

[02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:22.360]
See if it's me.

[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:24.080]
I want Brian Greacy to snore.

[02:20:24.220 --> 02:20:24.720]
I take it back.

[02:20:24.820 --> 02:20:26.820]
I want you to feed her because I'm a Patriots fan.

[02:20:26.960 --> 02:20:27.520]
I take that back.

[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:29.600]
But if I were a dolphin fan, which I'm not,

[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:31.880]
I want Brian Greacy to start that first game, wouldn't you?

[02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:34.640]
Remember, he has a good back, sir, that fax has 20 pages,

[02:20:34.660 --> 02:20:35.580]
and we can't read any of them.

[02:20:35.800 --> 02:20:36.060]
Yeah.

[02:20:36.180 --> 02:20:37.400]
Not two facts anymore.

[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:38.080]
Right.

[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:39.500]
He faxed again.

[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:41.160]
Hey, you're an asshole, sir.

[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:41.820]
We hate you.

[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:44.280]
Then Moreno is a god.

[02:20:45.940 --> 02:20:47.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:20:47.880 --> 02:20:49.300]
Well, we'll never have any use for that again.

[02:20:49.380 --> 02:20:50.360]
Might as well play it there, right?

[02:20:52.900 --> 02:20:55.280]
Shaqio 31, Sophia 28.

[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:56.280]
It's a two horse race.

[02:20:56.520 --> 02:20:57.280]
And you know something?

[02:20:57.360 --> 02:21:00.580]
I bet you wins by nose.

[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.380]
Here's Pember Pine.

[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:05.700]
Hello.

[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:10.920]
Pember Pines going once.

[02:21:15.300 --> 02:21:16.720]
Here's plantation key.

[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:17.020]
Hello.

[02:21:17.660 --> 02:21:18.260]
Hey, Neil.

[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:18.900]
How are you doing?

[02:21:19.220 --> 02:21:19.600]
Pretty good.

[02:21:20.180 --> 02:21:20.380]
Good.

[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:23.240]
That Sandy Willock what you're talking about.

[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:23.800]
Yeah.

[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:25.780]
Called While You Were Sleeping.

[02:21:26.040 --> 02:21:26.300]
Right.

[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:27.000]
Good movie.

[02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:31.360]
And yeah, you know, in public word for her, cutesy and doable.

[02:21:32.400 --> 02:21:33.000]
OK.

[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:36.640]
Easily worst performance ever in a movie.

[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:38.900]
Kevin Costner and Robin Hood.

[02:21:41.960 --> 02:21:44.000]
Oh, the white, hey, Kevin Costner.

[02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:46.520]
Yeah, that was terrible.

[02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:48.820]
He even makes me look like Mr. Personality.

[02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:49.960]
OK, we got you down pal.

[02:21:50.340 --> 02:21:51.100]
Thanks a lot.

[02:21:51.120 --> 02:21:52.800]
Yeah, Kevin Costner in Robin Hood.

[02:21:52.880 --> 02:21:54.200]
And just about almost anything else you did.

[02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:54.820]
But that's a good one.

[02:21:56.220 --> 02:22:00.200]
You think he's got some of the naked pictures of who?

[02:22:01.100 --> 02:22:04.080]
Anybody of whoever makes these movies, of whoever makes,

[02:22:04.240 --> 02:22:04.980]
does the casting.

[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:08.600]
And he's another one of those people you dare not say anything

[02:22:08.600 --> 02:22:12.320]
bad about Kevin Costner because he's a, he's like legendary,

[02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:12.760]
you know.

[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:15.120]
Am I right?

[02:22:15.420 --> 02:22:16.080]
Yeah, he's legendary.

[02:22:18.120 --> 02:22:21.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:23.120]
And Verizon Wireless Land.

[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:25.540]
Rumor I'm hearing is that Joe Costello is really pissed off

[02:22:25.540 --> 02:22:26.080]
with Bonerboy.

[02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:29.260]
I can take Joe too.

[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:30.340]
For sucking up.

[02:22:30.420 --> 02:22:31.560]
Yeah, you could go with Joe.

[02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:33.180]
And now he can leave his lovely wife home

[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:34.780]
and she can do the knitting or whatever she's doing.

[02:22:35.100 --> 02:22:36.740]
Knit some little booties for that baby that's coming.

[02:22:37.140 --> 02:22:38.720]
I have a local business.

[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:40.060]
He's here all by himself.

[02:22:40.580 --> 02:22:41.900]
There are you, all yours now.

[02:22:42.900 --> 02:22:47.620]
You and the one to do our.

[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:51.600]
Oh, my.

[02:22:55.980 --> 02:22:56.780]
Oh, my.

[02:22:59.240 --> 02:22:59.240]

[02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:03.140]
And the next installment in the matrix, the third prophecy.

[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:05.760]
In the third prophecy, the Oracle says.

[02:23:06.240 --> 02:23:08.620]
Mr. Smith would have become.

[02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:09.780]
Yes.

[02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:10.880]
Smith.

[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.180]
First, there was the matrix.

[02:23:12.660 --> 02:23:13.860]
And the matrix reloaded.

[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:18.080]
Now, matrix uncocked, directed by the former Larry Wachowski.

[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:21.860]
Now, notice Debbie coming soon with heater and a dumpster near you.

[02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:24.540]
Oh.

[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:31.740]
101 at 560 WQM are a good friend.

[02:23:31.780 --> 02:23:33.220]
Lynn Samuels has some suggestions.

[02:23:33.980 --> 02:23:34.480]
Devil's advocate.

[02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:36.760]
She nominates Al Pacino and he and O'Reaves.

[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:39.520]
Got it.

[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:40.160]
Got it.

[02:23:40.880 --> 02:23:43.040]
Battlefield earth, John Vulta.

[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:45.980]
Warren and Boca one of our chronic practices.

[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:49.100]
Another worst performance, John Wayne in the conqueror.

[02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:52.920]
He played Genghis Khan with his trademark slow western draw.

[02:23:53.340 --> 02:23:54.120]
Oh, God.

[02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:55.940]
John Wayne.

[02:23:55.940 --> 02:23:56.380]
Another one.

[02:23:56.580 --> 02:24:00.220]
Kind of like a earlier version of Slice to Lone if he acts me.

[02:24:01.640 --> 02:24:03.040]
You, Darren, you doesn't say that.

[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:04.780]
Next thing you're going to say, you didn't like that.

[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:07.280]
A small, teenage smigmy.

[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.340]
What was that?

[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:09.820]
I don't know.

[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.420]
You know, piano thing you mentioned earlier before.

[02:24:11.660 --> 02:24:11.960]
A battlefront.

[02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:15.760]
The name of the movie and you can put them down singly since we're not devil's advocate.

[02:24:16.180 --> 02:24:16.360]
OK.

[02:24:16.880 --> 02:24:17.680]
Put them down individual.

[02:24:18.140 --> 02:24:18.420]
Got it.

[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:20.160]
I don't want to start giving orders out.

[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:21.820]
And after that one.

[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:23.540]
Battlefield earth, the central voltage.

[02:24:24.940 --> 02:24:26.720]
Well, you're starting to slow down a little bit, aren't you?

[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:27.640]
Although we don't.

[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:30.200]
I'm not going to knock Bina Boy now that we got swinging them all on there.

[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:31.060]
Oh, brother.

[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:32.640]
That made my week.

[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:36.240]
Oh, it's swinging monkey nuts.

[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:40.100]
The worst acting performance ever in a movie shackle.

[02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:42.880]
Neils got 33, but Sophie is still on his ass, boy.

[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:46.820]
He's got her nose right in the crack from Godfather three.

[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.060]
All the 34 to 30 now for shack.

[02:24:50.360 --> 02:24:55.300]
I'll tell you basketball player with a good acting performance was Karim Abdul Jibbar in

[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:56.820]
Irk, Irk, Irk plane, right?

[02:24:57.540 --> 02:24:58.740]
He was a panic Roger.

[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:01.140]
Didn't have to do much, but he was just a panic.

[02:25:01.140 --> 02:25:01.600]
He was great.

[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.600]
Britney Spears from cross address 15.

[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:07.500]
Boad Derek, Tarzan the 8th man, 14.

[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:12.900]
Who would ever believe on a poll on this show on a heterosexual male dominated audience

[02:25:12.900 --> 02:25:13.320]
show.

[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:16.980]
We'd be knocking Britney and Boad Derek back to back side by each.

[02:25:17.140 --> 02:25:17.260]
Huh?

[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:21.280]
Yeah, I'd like to knock them, but just because they look or looked good didn't mean

[02:25:21.280 --> 02:25:23.060]
necessarily the correct way out of a paper sack.

[02:25:23.420 --> 02:25:24.000]
We don't care.

[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:26.060]
They could crawl away out of a paper sack.

[02:25:26.320 --> 02:25:27.540]
See, I don't understand one thing.

[02:25:28.420 --> 02:25:30.880]
I know this sounds tacky, but I'm sick anyway.

[02:25:31.340 --> 02:25:36.280]
But if you look like Britney Spears, all she'd have to do is make like one porn oh movie,

[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:36.500]
right?

[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:37.220]
Okay.

[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:39.600]
50 million dollars.

[02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:39.940]
Sure.

[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:40.620]
Right?

[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.240]
50 million.

[02:25:42.760 --> 02:25:47.660]
In addition to which a lot of her like the Pepsi spots she did and a lot of her stage performances

[02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:51.380]
in the videos, she's about as close to being naked as you possibly can be, which is her

[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:51.720]
whole stick.

[02:25:51.920 --> 02:25:52.520]
She's a slut.

[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:55.400]
And, you know, one porn oh movie, 50 million.

[02:25:55.660 --> 02:25:56.020]
That's it.

[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:57.020]
Have a great life.

[02:25:57.380 --> 02:25:57.560]
Mm-hmm.

[02:25:58.160 --> 02:25:58.680]
Am I right?

[02:25:59.060 --> 02:25:59.360]
Absolutely.

[02:25:59.780 --> 02:26:01.260]
Whoever would finance that.

[02:26:01.660 --> 02:26:04.680]
In addition to what you watch a lot of the movies, a lot of these movies we've been watching,

[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.940]
there is so much simulated sex on there like rules of attraction that they're just about

[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:11.700]
doing it anyway.

[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:16.840]
You could charge a hundred bucks a ticket for the baby to get into see it.

[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:17.360]
Easy.

[02:26:19.140 --> 02:26:21.600]
And as a matter of fact, that's a good pull question one of these days.

[02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:25.280]
How much would you pay for a porn oh movie with Britney Spears?

[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:27.560]
Huh?

[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:28.060]
Right.

[02:26:28.520 --> 02:26:29.280]
I think that's it.

[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:31.380]
Of course now some people can't afford the big bucks.

[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:32.080]
Now, be an abeanor boy.

[02:26:32.200 --> 02:26:32.660]
Eight bucks.

[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:33.540]
That's all he can afford.

[02:26:35.340 --> 02:26:36.200]
He's an abeanor boy.

[02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:36.240]

[02:26:36.300 --> 02:26:36.680]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:26:37.380 --> 02:26:38.820]
Any day to borrow it from you.

[02:26:38.820 --> 02:26:41.060]
But maybe you can watch it together.

[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:42.460]
Well, on different sides of the room.

[02:26:42.540 --> 02:26:42.960]
Yeah, please.

[02:26:43.420 --> 02:26:44.920]
Maybe he and Moker watch it together.

[02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:46.440]
It will matter.

[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:49.200]
Maybe that's what Mow was trying to show you.

[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:52.600]
Maybe he's trying to prove you he's a real swinger.

[02:26:54.480 --> 02:26:56.360]
Let's see Britney 15 for cross dress.

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:27:00.340]
Bo Dirk, 14, Tarzan E. Apan, sliced the low and rhinestone, 14.

[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:04.120]
Vin Diesel, fast and a furious 11 Eli Wallagot, part of the 311.

[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:06.860]
Maybe we could reason together.

[02:27:07.800 --> 02:27:13.700]
And it's not just the way he's delivering the line, but his gestures are just so ridiculous.

[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:15.380]
You just have to laugh out loud.

[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:19.580]
You know, I mean, here and that's in the scene where like they're doing the hit.

[02:27:19.880 --> 02:27:24.100]
They're having a big meeting in Atlantic City.

[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.480]
And the chandelier starts shaking.

[02:27:26.480 --> 02:27:29.280]
You know, and it's a hit and they're like firing from the helicopters.

[02:27:29.900 --> 02:27:33.320]
And it's a maybe one of the most serious scenes in a whole movie.

[02:27:34.420 --> 02:27:35.620]
And he's the one comedy.

[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.460]
I thought we could reason together.

[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.800]
Anyway, Elizabeth Berkeley, showgirls, she's got 11.

[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:45.460]
Kiana Reeves and a matrix nine sliced the low and the specialist nine.

[02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.720]
Vanilla ice cool as I seven.

[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:49.940]
But we just put that on her, didn't we?

[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:50.640]
Yeah.

[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:56.540]
Tom Hanks, Joe versus the volcano six and spite of violent protests by a being a boy.

[02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:59.720]
Al Pacino, send the woman's got five.

[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:00.660]
I'm so ecstatic.

[02:28:00.840 --> 02:28:02.340]
I'm so delighted because I didn't even vote for that.

[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:05.800]
That there are enough of you people out there with a brain to realize that that was just,

[02:28:06.080 --> 02:28:08.600]
you know, see a lot of times people say, well, let's Al Pacino.

[02:28:08.600 --> 02:28:10.380]
It couldn't possibly have been bad, you know.

[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:15.220]
Well, a lot of people would have said this everybody like Wallach, right?

[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.400]
He was never great.

[02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:19.380]
What was he like great and he never bothered me, but what was he?

[02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:20.820]
He was never a bad actor.

[02:28:21.120 --> 02:28:22.600]
He never said, oh, he was just awful.

[02:28:23.520 --> 02:28:24.080]
Like Madonna.

[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:24.860]
He was never something.

[02:28:25.100 --> 02:28:25.800]
He said, oh, he's an idiot.

[02:28:25.880 --> 02:28:27.500]
I'm not going to go see it or like slice the loan.

[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:30.040]
But that was just maybe he was just saving enough for them.

[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:33.140]
He's got to be dead, isn't he?

[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:34.220]
Good question.

[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:35.420]
I don't think he is.

[02:28:35.800 --> 02:28:36.000]
Really?

[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:38.240]
Try one more can only sweet heart.

[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:41.460]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:41.800]
Hello.

[02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:43.240]
Neil.

[02:28:43.740 --> 02:28:44.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:28:44.620 --> 02:28:46.040]
Hi, I'm a first time caller.

[02:28:46.320 --> 02:28:50.640]
I was mainly called right basically to get back from you.

[02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:53.500]
We go to first and really rough times lately.

[02:28:55.960 --> 02:28:59.220]
And it's kind of hard to talk about, but I'm going to sit it out.

[02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:04.140]
They've been together for about 26 years now.

[02:29:05.440 --> 02:29:09.820]
And just recently, I was told that they're thinking about splitting up.

[02:29:12.100 --> 02:29:16.060]
And 26 years, if they've been together, it's just really a long time.

[02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:16.720]
Your parents?

[02:29:18.220 --> 02:29:19.340]
26 years.

[02:29:19.800 --> 02:29:19.980]
Neil.

[02:29:21.060 --> 02:29:21.620]
Yeah.

[02:29:22.700 --> 02:29:24.640]
It's really hard for me to even say this.

[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:29.200]
But the fact that they're going to be splitting up after 26 years.

[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:29.620]
Yeah.

[02:29:29.720 --> 02:29:30.360]
How many years?

[02:29:31.300 --> 02:29:31.780]
26.

[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:32.960]
I'll be damned.

[02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:34.200]
And yeah.

[02:29:36.120 --> 02:29:37.640]
I just really need to hear.

[02:29:38.200 --> 02:29:38.480]
Yeah.

[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:40.640]
What should I do about this?

[02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:42.140]
Why are they splitting up?

[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:43.880]
What can I do?

[02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:47.820]
Are you trying to qualify for our poll today?

[02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:48.980]
Is that what this is about?

[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:51.740]
No, I'm being serious now.

[02:29:52.120 --> 02:29:52.240]
Yeah.

[02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:54.960]
And my best suggestion is mind your own business.

[02:29:55.640 --> 02:29:57.800]
5,670, 05,60, 05,60.

[02:29:57.800 --> 02:29:59.200]
How many years would they together?

[02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:01.540]
3rd man.

[02:30:01.780 --> 02:30:02.360]
Pretty close.

[02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:02.680]
Yeah.

[02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:03.840]
2nd year old business.

[02:30:04.040 --> 02:30:04.380]
But out.

[02:30:04.700 --> 02:30:05.340]
2nd year old life.

[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:07.960]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:30:08.120 --> 02:30:08.280]
Hello.

[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:10.800]
Miami.

[02:30:11.360 --> 02:30:12.240]
Hey, how are you doing, Neil?

[02:30:12.520 --> 02:30:13.460]
I think that was Reverend Jones.

[02:30:13.740 --> 02:30:14.080]
Yes, sir.

[02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:14.520]
How are you?

[02:30:15.140 --> 02:30:15.340]
Good.

[02:30:15.580 --> 02:30:17.220]
How about your family using Dumman Dummer?

[02:30:17.800 --> 02:30:17.960]
Who?

[02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:18.960]
Your family?

[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:21.040]
Dumman Dummer.

[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.540]
Dumman Dummer?

[02:30:22.840 --> 02:30:23.960]
The Jim Carrey, yeah.

[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:24.700]
OK.

[02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:27.700]
And a good modern movie.

[02:30:28.020 --> 02:30:28.160]
He.

[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:30.600]
OK, man.

[02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:31.780]
Thank you.

[02:30:32.020 --> 02:30:32.360]
See you.

[02:30:32.900 --> 02:30:34.360]
Got it down, Jeff Daniels.

[02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:35.060]
Dumman Dummer.

[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:37.160]
As in...

[02:30:38.120 --> 02:30:39.620]
Wasn't that the Greg Reed story?

[02:30:39.960 --> 02:30:40.360]
Yeah.

[02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:41.480]
I think so.

[02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:42.140]
Nice job.

[02:30:42.220 --> 02:30:43.440]
And that morning show, by the way, Greg.

[02:30:44.420 --> 02:30:47.060]
If the audience thinks that we finally come up with a solution, man,

[02:30:47.100 --> 02:30:47.840]
you ain't seen nothing yet.

[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:52.980]
Because if the guilty stories are true, if what Ferell was babbling about this morning turns out to be true,

[02:30:52.980 --> 02:30:56.020]
we got all kinds of complex crap going on, huh?

[02:30:57.320 --> 02:31:00.080]
In addition to what you know what I was thinking during the last break,

[02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:05.900]
here's Clarence, our program director, who just turned 30, going on about 12th,

[02:31:06.120 --> 02:31:07.600]
who's had a little bit of a life problem.

[02:31:07.740 --> 02:31:09.820]
You know, he's like a little immature and he can't get laid.

[02:31:09.980 --> 02:31:11.300]
And he's not a bad guy.

[02:31:11.460 --> 02:31:14.500]
And he gets me my paycheck all the time on time, sometimes the day early.

[02:31:14.520 --> 02:31:14.920]
Oh, right.

[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:17.940]
But you bring a guy in like Ferell.

[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.500]
You make a big fuss of it, all the TV.

[02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:22.180]
People you bring in, you make a big splash about it.

[02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:25.480]
And Clarence and Greg are obsessed with Ferell.

[02:31:25.480 --> 02:31:27.400]
I mean, we like him, but they're beyond that.

[02:31:27.580 --> 02:31:28.200]
They're obsessed with him.

[02:31:28.580 --> 02:31:32.520]
So the first one of the first things you do is start putting out memos about no food in there.

[02:31:32.720 --> 02:31:33.940]
You know, you found out what I'm saying?

[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:35.360]
Oh, yeah, I got it.

[02:31:35.500 --> 02:31:38.640]
To try to make him feel like he's brought into a like a Gestapo.

[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:42.100]
Like John Ascroft has run into the joint, something like that.

[02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:43.580]
Not a good idea, Clarence.

[02:31:43.680 --> 02:31:44.420]
Well, not a good way.

[02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:50.020]
And of course, then pulling a Greg Reed, you know, Clarence very soon will be off the Omaha and be gone for several days.

[02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:52.940]
So he don't have to be there until the smoke clears, you know, right?

[02:31:53.440 --> 02:31:56.280]
Which is fine because I'll be there next week and I'll be eating whatever I want,

[02:31:56.320 --> 02:31:57.440]
which I'm not going to be in a whole lot.

[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:00.040]
But if we want how he's to bring us in a bunch of bacon, guess what?

[02:32:00.140 --> 02:32:03.260]
How he's will bring in a bunch of bacon and the beast they get in any of ours.

[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:11.200]
Which one of the reasons that we don't aren't too crazy about the beast no more came in and stole a boner boy's bacon this morning.

[02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:12.820]
Well, it didn't exactly go down that way.

[02:32:13.540 --> 02:32:14.600]
What way did it go down?

[02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:15.860]
It was a part of like it.

[02:32:15.860 --> 02:32:16.760]
Did it go on back home?

[02:32:17.100 --> 02:32:17.480]
It was what?

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.900]
But he recaptured it.

[02:32:18.900 --> 02:32:19.940]
Which I did.

[02:32:21.860 --> 02:32:22.820]
Right out of his mouth.

[02:32:22.940 --> 02:32:23.120]
Right.

[02:32:23.380 --> 02:32:27.300]
I found that he had hidden it in his little Styrofoam stuff with all his other food.

[02:32:27.840 --> 02:32:27.980]
Yeah.

[02:32:28.040 --> 02:32:28.580]
It was hiding in there.

[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:29.980]
So I looked inside and thought he was eating it.

[02:32:29.980 --> 02:32:31.200]
You know, you have to write out of his mouth.

[02:32:31.420 --> 02:32:31.520]
Yeah.

[02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:34.160]
So it's like a tug of war.

[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:35.940]
Every two dogs fighting over a steak.

[02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:37.540]
Now he's a tub.

[02:32:37.780 --> 02:32:38.400]
He really is.

[02:32:39.360 --> 02:32:42.100]
I mean, we've had people in the building fatter like Josh Freeman.

[02:32:42.240 --> 02:32:43.000]
He's gone by the way.

[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:44.140]
Josh Freeman won't see him no more.

[02:32:44.540 --> 02:32:45.780]
And there, there have been people fatter.

[02:32:45.880 --> 02:32:47.700]
But and certainly fat boy is fatter.

[02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:51.900]
But nobody is more of a just a grub than the beast.

[02:32:52.960 --> 02:32:55.020]
Although then there's always Zack, you know.

[02:32:55.800 --> 02:32:55.940]
Wow.

[02:32:56.060 --> 02:32:59.540]
Can you imagine if that morning's show could get paid by the pound?

[02:33:02.320 --> 02:33:03.700]
We're sports radio 5cc.

[02:33:05.140 --> 02:33:05.760]
UAM.

[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:08.500]
Got out.

[02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:10.180]
WQAM.

[02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:13.480]
Where the fack it is.

[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:20.780]
Hey, who you looking at?

[02:33:23.460 --> 02:33:24.340]
Ooh.

[02:33:26.200 --> 02:33:26.860]
Yeah.

[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.540]
Slides in the case.

[02:33:31.380 --> 02:33:34.680]
You can't look directly at me.

[02:33:35.140 --> 02:33:37.780]
You cannot look in his eyes.

[02:33:38.220 --> 02:33:41.960]
If you do your job, goes by by.

[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:47.500]
He'd say when I come in a room,

[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:53.340]
You leave it to leave without turning around.

[02:33:54.300 --> 02:34:01.360]
It's no wonder they deal us that long.

[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:02.520]
You're smart.

[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:06.620]
But first that's one of no jobs.

[02:34:06.620 --> 02:34:10.080]
Posty smart guy is their job.

[02:34:10.460 --> 02:34:15.040]
Another suing you when you're white.

[02:34:15.660 --> 02:34:20.360]
You're smart to love and give you speed to your mom.

[02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:24.000]
Stack your back, goes your guard.

[02:34:24.540 --> 02:34:28.520]
There's gonna treatment just in right.

[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:29.460]
No.

[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:31.460]
You're smart to love.

[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:32.620]
Oi!

[02:34:33.220 --> 02:34:37.220]
Slice the loan is letting prove that you could package cow crap and sell to the American public.

[02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.220]
If you'd just package it the right way.

[02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:46.800]
38 votes for Shaco Niel and Kazama is the worst acting performance ever in a movie.

[02:34:47.440 --> 02:34:49.820]
Sophia Coppola is still right on his ass, boy.

[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:51.500]
The Godfather 335.

[02:34:52.400 --> 02:34:53.160]
Britney Spears.

[02:34:53.800 --> 02:34:54.680]
Cross-address.

[02:34:55.380 --> 02:34:55.820]
16.

[02:34:56.780 --> 02:34:57.220]
Bo Derek.

[02:34:57.360 --> 02:34:58.140]
Tarzan the 8th man.

[02:34:58.240 --> 02:34:58.520]
15.

[02:34:59.020 --> 02:35:00.140]
Slice the loan in rhinestone.

[02:35:00.140 --> 02:35:00.600]
14.

[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:04.520]
Vin Diesel the fact that fast and furious in the feces 12.

[02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:09.360]
Elizabeth Berkeley showgirls 12 and Eli Waller Godfather 3 has got 12.

[02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:10.440]
Oh look at that.

[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:12.200]
He's only got 12 and Sophia's got 35.

[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:13.000]
Not even a contest.

[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:14.720]
Would you agree with that?

[02:35:15.260 --> 02:35:15.440]
Yeah.

[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:15.860]
Yeah.

[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:16.320]
That's true.

[02:35:17.980 --> 02:35:21.600]
I look at it differently because I don't expect anything from her because she's not a real actress.

[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:22.380]
Okay.

[02:35:22.420 --> 02:35:22.800]
Good point.

[02:35:23.220 --> 02:35:26.580]
So if you start with no expectations then she lives right up to it.

[02:35:26.580 --> 02:35:30.340]
You're right in his case for a guy that's supposed to be a real actor to ham it up like

[02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.660]
that and just absolutely disgrace himself.

[02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:35.360]
No wonder she gave him the Goddamn can only.

[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:36.680]
Anyway here's a really good fact.

[02:35:37.340 --> 02:35:40.020]
Two gruesome performances Barbara Streisand and Yintel.

[02:35:40.400 --> 02:35:40.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:35:41.080 --> 02:35:41.680]
Or she would say.

[02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:42.380]
Oh.

[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:48.540]
A test to portray a young boy and obvious vanity project for this complete mega-lomaniac

[02:35:48.540 --> 02:35:50.420]
and you are absolutely correct.

[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:52.340]
Deborah Winger in the sheltering star.

[02:35:52.440 --> 02:35:55.060]
Are we getting these down now or am I just making sounds?

[02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:58.500]
Deborah Winger in the sheltering sky.

[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:03.300]
One of the few films I've ever walked out of the film also gives you the highly dubious pleasure of seeing her pie.

[02:36:05.800 --> 02:36:08.380]
Also I've heard many of these fine films recommended you recently.

[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:10.620]
Two from the 90s I didn't hear mention which you might have missed.

[02:36:10.860 --> 02:36:12.660]
Although one we just had that guy a little while ago.

[02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:13.760]
Heat.

[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:15.040]
Yeah.

[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:17.540]
Heat without Pacino Robert De Nirovail.

[02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.860]
Kilmer, Kilmer Ashley Judge on Void Time Size More.

[02:36:20.180 --> 02:36:21.320]
Very entertaining crime drama.

[02:36:21.540 --> 02:36:23.900]
Ashley Judd has one of the best scenes for many movie in recent years.

[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:26.500]
Be careful not to get to the come of the same name with Bert Reynolds.

[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:27.580]
Oh don't worry about that.

[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:28.660]
Oh no.

[02:36:29.360 --> 02:36:30.380]
We pushed our layout.

[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.440]
Boogie Night's was fine.

[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:32.680]
Nice going Bert and Deliverance.

[02:36:32.760 --> 02:36:33.500]
Those were his new movies.

[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:35.960]
That's anything else forget about it.

[02:36:36.820 --> 02:36:37.900]
You might leave anything out.

[02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:38.560]
Did he do anything else?

[02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:38.680]
No.

[02:36:38.780 --> 02:36:39.180]
Movie was seen.

[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:39.740]
Rokor Ace.

[02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:41.320]
Like I said.

[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:43.700]
Smoking in the band is part one through one hundred.

[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:47.140]
LA Confidential with Guy Pearson Russell Crowe.

[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:50.480]
Kevin Spacey James Cromwell, one of our greatest actors unknown to most folks.

[02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:51.820]
Danny De Vito and Kim Basinger.

[02:36:52.100 --> 02:36:52.340]
It says.

[02:36:52.340 --> 02:36:55.640]
So what I'm going to do is I'm out and cut you would agree with that right?

[02:36:55.880 --> 02:36:57.880]
LA Confidential is a definite must see.

[02:36:58.380 --> 02:36:58.940]
Okay and heat.

[02:36:59.540 --> 02:36:59.940]
Heat.

[02:37:00.160 --> 02:37:02.040]
It was to me it was bland.

[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:02.880]
It was a blend.

[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.460]
It was good but long.

[02:37:04.740 --> 02:37:05.820]
It got slowing parts.

[02:37:06.160 --> 02:37:06.280]
Yeah.

[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:07.680]
Yeah.

[02:37:08.200 --> 02:37:10.720]
Nothing there was nothing that much to it.

[02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:11.400]
I give it okay.

[02:37:11.460 --> 02:37:12.140]
I give it an adequate.

[02:37:12.660 --> 02:37:12.800]
Right.

[02:37:12.840 --> 02:37:13.800]
Okay well across that on.

[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:15.880]
So I'm going to go out for sure today and get three.

[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:19.380]
LA Confidential, usual suspects and big low eloinsky.

[02:37:21.220 --> 02:37:21.940]
The big.

[02:37:22.480 --> 02:37:23.240]
The whiskey.

[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:24.380]
Okay.

[02:37:25.140 --> 02:37:26.680]
That's on my shopping list for right now.

[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:27.900]
Because there's so damn many.

[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:30.920]
There's so damn many of them in so little time.

[02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:33.240]
You see that's something about guys that play golf.

[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:34.840]
Right.

[02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:36.860]
Don't let me forget to ask him on Monday.

[02:37:37.460 --> 02:37:40.340]
For all about you know when's the last time he's really seen a movie?

[02:37:40.580 --> 02:37:41.840]
Because guys that play a lot of golf.

[02:37:42.080 --> 02:37:43.740]
That's a lot of valuable movie watching time.

[02:37:43.740 --> 02:37:46.880]
Of course you know watching a movie is sitting on your ass which isn't good for you.

[02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:49.360]
And going out there playing golf is really good.

[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:49.980]
You're going to be great exercise.

[02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:54.960]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[02:37:55.100 --> 02:37:55.520]
Here's Miami.

[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:55.880]
Hello.

[02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:57.480]
Neil?

[02:37:57.880 --> 02:37:58.280]
Yes sir.

[02:37:58.500 --> 02:37:59.580]
Hey Neil how are you doing?

[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:00.540]
Sensational.

[02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:01.240]
All right.

[02:38:01.720 --> 02:38:05.400]
I'm surprised nobody has ever mentioned Al Pacino in Scarface.

[02:38:06.900 --> 02:38:07.460]
Comedy.

[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:12.580]
I mean the accident he tried to put on.

[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:14.100]
Yeah so bad.

[02:38:14.160 --> 02:38:14.600]
Really bad.

[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:19.300]
Yeah and it's an Italian guy being a Spanish mobster.

[02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:20.700]
Yeah it was horrible in that.

[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:21.940]
Okay we'll put it down.

[02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:23.800]
He deserves it.

[02:38:23.800 --> 02:38:27.600]
Anyway the cop that you'll see in LA Confidential.

[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:28.560]
Yeah.

[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:32.100]
The one that's the final becomes a lieutenant with the glasses.

[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:33.360]
He's an Australian.

[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:35.900]
He's an Aussie.

[02:38:36.320 --> 02:38:37.440]
Well we won't hold that against him.

[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.120]
No I know that but I mean in the movie he doesn't even have a trace of it.

[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:42.680]
Well that's a good reaction I mean.

[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.820]
Well how about I mentioned a couple of weeks ago I talked about Jude Law and the town

[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:51.500]
that Mr Ripley who's who's British and got a very heavy British accent but in Mr Ripley

[02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:53.680]
he doesn't have any accent laws speak perfect English.

[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:54.600]
I mean like we do.

[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:54.980]
Yep.

[02:38:55.180 --> 02:38:55.620]
Perfect American.

[02:38:55.840 --> 02:38:56.480]
Okay thanks pal.

[02:38:56.600 --> 02:38:57.040]
Okay man.

[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:58.960]
Jude Law is an ember actor okay.

[02:38:59.180 --> 02:38:59.900]
Yes he is and.

[02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:00.720]
Yes.

[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.320]
Enemy at the gates with Jude Law is a true story in a good movie.

[02:39:04.460 --> 02:39:05.640]
I better put that down then.

[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:06.780]
Because I crossed out heat.

[02:39:07.340 --> 02:39:08.060]
Enemy at the gates.

[02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:08.640]
Yes.

[02:39:09.040 --> 02:39:12.380]
About the Nazis invading stolen grad in the.

[02:39:12.900 --> 02:39:16.320]
We are not about Jews.

[02:39:18.180 --> 02:39:21.400]
You're not allowed to watch any of these movies until you watch beautiful mind and snatch.

[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:23.300]
Beautiful mind.

[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:24.420]
I don't know.

[02:39:24.700 --> 02:39:25.000]
That's right.

[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:25.900]
I don't have a snatch yet.

[02:39:26.540 --> 02:39:26.960]
Do I?

[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:27.880]
I don't know.

[02:39:28.020 --> 02:39:29.620]
I haven't found snatch yet.

[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:31.800]
Of course I haven't been looking for it all that much.

[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:34.040]
Enemy at the gates I'm crossing out.

[02:39:34.120 --> 02:39:36.740]
I got usual suspects Big Lewinsky and snatch.

[02:39:36.740 --> 02:39:37.980]
That was the other one.

[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:39.960]
LA Confidential.

[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:40.520]
I got those four.

[02:39:40.820 --> 02:39:43.700]
How many can I watch like in one sitting you know just give me a break here.

[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:44.940]
Give me a break.

[02:39:45.180 --> 02:39:46.860]
Plus I still got a whole crap load in there.

[02:39:47.180 --> 02:39:49.600]
What's that one the smelly beast or something like that?

[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:51.780]
Oh uh, a sexy beast which I never saw.

[02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:53.340]
You never saw it.

[02:39:53.380 --> 02:39:54.340]
You'll have to tell me if it's good.

[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:55.120]
Okay.

[02:39:55.720 --> 02:39:56.940]
Well I mean what do I know?

[02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:58.660]
I mean you know based on your taste.

[02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:03.260]
Because if you didn't like Magnolia.

[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:05.760]
This is the beast of fat Jew.

[02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:08.840]
5, 6, 7 he's disgusting.

[02:40:08.840 --> 02:40:09.460]
He really is.

[02:40:09.640 --> 02:40:12.440]
Hey by the way Beast don't take it personal but we're not too crazy about you anymore.

[02:40:12.580 --> 02:40:12.920]
We're on to you.

[02:40:13.200 --> 02:40:14.040]
See we're on to him.

[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:15.080]
That's what bugs me.

[02:40:15.200 --> 02:40:15.740]
We're on to his act.

[02:40:16.020 --> 02:40:18.320]
He even pulled it this morning just to come in there and steal your food.

[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:25.780]
And now that he notices that we're getting along real good with Pharrell and we got a great cross over going and we're real happy to have him there.

[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:27.540]
Now he's trying to suck.

[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:29.160]
Suck back into us a little bit.

[02:40:29.300 --> 02:40:31.720]
See after he like after we kicked his ass out.

[02:40:32.700 --> 02:40:37.160]
Now he's trying to suck his way back into our good graces after he's screwed our good friends at balance for life.

[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:38.160]
Nice going Air Beast.

[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:39.640]
Radio Chameleon.

[02:40:40.560 --> 02:40:41.000]
Exactly.

[02:40:41.320 --> 02:40:42.960]
He's a radio Chameleon man.

[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:44.860]
Hop in from one room to another.

[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:47.020]
Pollinating everywhere he can.

[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:52.720]
Talking trash and then go out and stab it in the back like two feet down the hallway.

[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:54.440]
That's the beast.

[02:40:55.160 --> 02:40:57.100]
So I hope their clearance gets you good sweetheart.

[02:40:57.420 --> 02:40:58.120]
I'll pay to see it.

[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:01.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound five.

[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:02.120]
I'll pay to miss it.

[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:11.460]
The worst acting performance in a movie ever was Shaquille O'Neal and Kazam 41.

[02:41:11.800 --> 02:41:13.980]
Sophia Coppola and Godfather 3 38.

[02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:16.660]
Those two seem to be like way ahead of the pack.

[02:41:17.260 --> 02:41:17.960]
50 likes ahead.

[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.000]
Brittany Crossroads 16.

[02:41:21.280 --> 02:41:21.780]
Vodiric.

[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:22.860]
Cars and the 8 man 15.

[02:41:23.280 --> 02:41:24.720]
Slice the line so unfortunately.

[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:26.840]
I mean, just nobody else is even in the running.

[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:29.560]
Out of them near 255 votes.

[02:41:31.640 --> 02:41:35.680]
How's he like a wallock to 12 dozen dirty doesn't was the in that.

[02:41:36.580 --> 02:41:39.220]
I don't recall he was in the good to bat in the ugly.

[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:40.800]
He was the ugly.

[02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:43.720]
Here's a call from the field Beach.

[02:41:43.720 --> 02:41:43.980]
Hello.

[02:41:44.180 --> 02:41:44.900]
Hey Neil.

[02:41:45.140 --> 02:41:45.740]
Yes sir.

[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:50.740]
I put a vote in it's probably late in the game and this may not get a lot of votes but Bruce Wilson Hudson Hawk.

[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:54.240]
Ugly one of the worst action performances one of the worst movies ever made.

[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:57.840]
Well, don't forget this poll stays up all weekend so it's got a chance to get a lot of votes.

[02:41:57.880 --> 02:41:59.240]
A complete waste of soliloid.

[02:41:59.600 --> 02:41:59.860]
Okay.

[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:04.340]
I know you're only only allowed one foot but I also have to mention Dennis Rodman.

[02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:06.460]
The news was in a movie.

[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:09.260]
He was in a movie with John Clark Van Damme called double team.

[02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:10.000]
Oh.

[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:10.460]
Horrible.

[02:42:10.840 --> 02:42:11.860]
Oh my god.

[02:42:12.480 --> 02:42:14.900]
Run run run screaming in the opposite direction.

[02:42:15.460 --> 02:42:17.160]
He was you should rent enemy at the gates.

[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:18.380]
Good movie.

[02:42:18.980 --> 02:42:21.520]
Good movie and it wasn't just what was the guy.

[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:22.600]
I don't rent him.

[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:24.640]
I go and buy him when you got the big bucks you don't rent him.

[02:42:24.780 --> 02:42:24.780]

[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:27.120]
Who was who was the other guy?

[02:42:27.440 --> 02:42:28.040]
Who was the wrong one?

[02:42:28.140 --> 02:42:28.480]
Ron Pearlman.

[02:42:29.080 --> 02:42:32.960]
Who played the other the the the the the the Harris and not the sniper.

[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:33.260]
Yeah.

[02:42:33.580 --> 02:42:34.260]
Excellent movie.

[02:42:34.380 --> 02:42:36.720]
It's like a duel between I just wrote it down again on my list.

[02:42:36.740 --> 02:42:37.720]
I'm going to get it this afternoon.

[02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:38.440]
Check it out.

[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:39.220]
Thanks, Sally.

[02:42:39.480 --> 02:42:39.640]
Thanks.

[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:40.580]
Okay.

[02:42:41.440 --> 02:42:41.980]
There you go.

[02:42:42.060 --> 02:42:43.240]
Enemy at the gates usual suspects.

[02:42:43.500 --> 02:42:45.580]
That's Ellie confidential and the big Lewinsky.

[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:49.460]
I sure hope that whatever that show she was on.

[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:50.920]
I hope that's off already has been canceled.

[02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:51.740]
Yeah.

[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:52.760]
I think I don't know.

[02:42:53.860 --> 02:43:00.620]
You see maybe someday if I live long enough to about 400 maybe somebody can explain to me why the president was the bad guy.

[02:43:00.720 --> 02:43:08.600]
And please don't tell me that she was so young because she bragged about it that she was going with her presidential knee pads that she was a slut and she was getting ready to like service her president.

[02:43:09.800 --> 02:43:13.300]
So he's the bad guy and he's almost gets impeached.

[02:43:13.840 --> 02:43:16.800]
He comes with an interview getting convicted in the impeachment trial.

[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:20.960]
And she's like a TV host.

[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:21.780]
She's a celebrity.

[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:22.660]
She's the victim.

[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:24.800]
She's the poor abuse the underling.

[02:43:25.980 --> 02:43:26.100]
Right?

[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:27.260]
She's a slut.

[02:43:27.920 --> 02:43:28.220]
Yeah.

[02:43:28.360 --> 02:43:28.580]
That's all.

[02:43:29.260 --> 02:43:31.840]
And not only that, she's an unattractive slut.

[02:43:32.100 --> 02:43:33.000]
And she's a divorce for it.

[02:43:33.360 --> 02:43:34.340]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:35.740]
I can't stand that slut.

[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:36.160]
Amen.

[02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.000]
Say it again.

[02:43:38.140 --> 02:43:39.360]
I can't stand that slut.

[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:43.560]
Oh.

[02:43:43.980 --> 02:43:43.980]

[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:45.020]
Man.

[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:46.000]
Fat.

[02:43:46.820 --> 02:43:47.180]
Disgusting.

[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:48.260]
Nasty.

[02:43:49.260 --> 02:43:49.620]
Fowl.

[02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:54.140]
She saved the freaking blue dress with a cum stand on a nice go.

[02:43:54.180 --> 02:43:54.420]
It's weird.

[02:43:54.500 --> 02:43:55.280]
That's a nice touch.

[02:43:55.920 --> 02:43:57.220]
She saved the blue dress.

[02:43:57.420 --> 02:43:57.960]
That's a souvenir.

[02:43:58.380 --> 02:43:59.540]
He ought to be rich.

[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:03.920]
26 past one at five sixty WQM.

[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.080]
Hey, if you own a home and you have a nice pool, there's nothing worse on a hot summer's day.

[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:11.080]
Then going out in the backyard to take a nice refreshing dip and you take a look at a pool.

[02:44:11.180 --> 02:44:12.160]
You want to puke your guts out.

[02:44:12.280 --> 02:44:13.640]
It's like watching train spotting.

[02:44:14.100 --> 02:44:14.760]
It's stained.

[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:15.580]
It's dirty meeting.

[02:44:15.840 --> 02:44:17.300]
You've got cracks in it and the pool too.

[02:44:17.860 --> 02:44:19.640]

[02:45:55.040 --> 02:45:59.560]
It began in 1997 when scientists cloned Dolly the sheep.

[02:45:59.560 --> 02:46:12.060]
Since that time millions of dollars and countless laboratory hours later scientists at the University of Idaho are reveling in another incredible cloning breakthrough.

[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:16.520]
It's the world's first cloning of a mule.

[02:46:17.980 --> 02:46:26.020]
Scientists now say based upon this incredible success they have plans to clone other asses with Nehuston.

[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:28.480]
Mike Tyson.

[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:30.960]
Rosie O'Donnell.

[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.560]
Monica Lewinsky.

[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:37.420]
Bill and Hillary Clinton.

[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:39.580]
Very cool.

[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:43.080]
That's certainly what I did.

[02:46:43.780 --> 02:46:44.600]
As cloning.

[02:46:46.100 --> 02:46:48.420]
One 31, but he had everybody in it.

[02:46:48.540 --> 02:46:51.840]
I just got through talking about the big lebus and Lewinsky.

[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:55.140]
Do you just emailed me more of these pictures?

[02:46:55.860 --> 02:46:56.580]
Not just.

[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:58.160]
Oh, a while ago.

[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:02.440]
Some of them are like, I don't know, they're just sitting there and not doing anything yet.

[02:47:02.660 --> 02:47:03.360]
I'll take a peek at them.

[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:07.100]
Don't forget this is the deadline this weekend for Hot Couples Contest number three.

[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:10.140]
You could win yourself a trip for two either of the Bahamas or Jamaica Mon.

[02:47:10.420 --> 02:47:14.220]
You could read all the details on our website right above the Squirrel Emo.

[02:47:14.220 --> 02:47:20.260]
And then Monday morning at 10 we closed the entry box.

[02:47:20.380 --> 02:47:21.340]
We closed the box.

[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:24.540]
And then we move on to the voting, right?

[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:25.540]
Right.

[02:47:26.100 --> 02:47:31.040]
Speaking of the voting, 44 votes for Shakira Loneidon, Kazan 38 for Sophia 39 now.

[02:47:31.140 --> 02:47:31.780]
I forgot about the three.

[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:33.020]
Everybody else, small potatoes.

[02:47:34.680 --> 02:47:35.900]
Here's a call from Lake Worth.

[02:47:36.080 --> 02:47:36.220]
Hello.

[02:47:37.160 --> 02:47:37.740]
Hi, Neil.

[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:40.520]
Here's my nomination for worst performance ever in a movie.

[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:43.920]
OJ Simpson in the naked gun.

[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:48.100]
You know, it's funny you mentioned it because a little while ago during your break I was thinking about him

[02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:49.800]
and I couldn't think of any of the movies he's been in.

[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:54.900]
I mean his performances are always wooden and they slay me but I couldn't think of one day was it naked gun.

[02:47:55.320 --> 02:48:00.260]
Well, here's the thing about that movie is that for 90% of it he was in a coma and he somehow managed to screw that out.

[02:48:00.540 --> 02:48:01.800]
Damn it.

[02:48:01.860 --> 02:48:02.820]
Or more thing, Neil.

[02:48:03.400 --> 02:48:04.980]
Jessica Geary, smelly bitch.

[02:48:09.800 --> 02:48:14.280]
Well, you know, OJ had to come out of the coma because he had a whole bunch of things that he had to do.

[02:48:14.660 --> 02:48:15.260]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:15.920]
No.

[02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:17.940]
Well, like maybe kill some people.

[02:48:18.220 --> 02:48:18.220]

[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:19.380]
Five.

[02:48:19.580 --> 02:48:20.400]
Let's get that down.

[02:48:20.460 --> 02:48:21.420]
OJ Simpson naked gun.

[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:21.900]
Got it.

[02:48:22.660 --> 02:48:27.340]
560, 7.0560, £560 on the AT&T Verizon wireless line.

[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:30.260]
How'd your cost dollar do I have to Verizon today? Any report?

[02:48:31.100 --> 02:48:31.220]
No.

[02:48:31.220 --> 02:48:33.540]
I hate speaking to me now.

[02:48:33.700 --> 02:48:36.560]
And, yeah, and be an abhor, I forget about that. He'll never speak to you.

[02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:37.860]
Doesn't already.

[02:48:39.340 --> 02:48:40.340]
Here's Davy. Hello.

[02:48:41.300 --> 02:48:47.280]
Yeah, I think the worst performance in the best movie was Steve Owen, Jack Astamovie.

[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:51.820]
And if you're going to see any movie this weekend, you should wear Jack Astamovie.

[02:48:52.440 --> 02:48:52.840]
No.

[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:53.820]
Oh, yeah.

[02:48:55.500 --> 02:48:56.760]
No, do that right now.

[02:48:57.080 --> 02:48:57.320]
Yeah.

[02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:01.120]
Oh, God.

[02:49:03.580 --> 02:49:06.360]
560, 7.0560, I mean, why would they even dignify that with a comment?

[02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:07.320]
Why would I respond?

[02:49:07.700 --> 02:49:08.140]
What I respond?

[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:08.520]
Oh.

[02:49:08.660 --> 02:49:11.360]
They called during another movie poll inside the same crap.

[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:12.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:49:12.160 --> 02:49:13.380]
Well, he's a tell us.

[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:14.680]
He's got the mentality of a ten-year-old.

[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:15.340]
What can I tell you?

[02:49:15.900 --> 02:49:16.880]
He's in a time warp.

[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.500]
He's like Boca Bryant only on the opposite end.

[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:24.080]
Here's a call from, what is it? Hollywood.

[02:49:25.420 --> 02:49:25.780]
Oh, nice.

[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:27.040]
That's a good one.

[02:49:27.100 --> 02:49:27.800]
I wrote it down.

[02:49:28.700 --> 02:49:30.080]
What the hell?

[02:49:30.200 --> 02:49:31.100]
They're suggestions.

[02:49:32.340 --> 02:49:33.240]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:34.660]
Oh, you mean to be here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:49:34.780 --> 02:49:34.940]
Hello.

[02:49:36.380 --> 02:49:37.320]
What the hell was that?

[02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:38.280]
Me.

[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:39.840]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:49:40.660 --> 02:49:41.520]
Oh, yeah.

[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:42.380]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:43.520]
Yeah.

[02:49:43.680 --> 02:49:45.660]
Why are you going to stop this movie business?

[02:49:45.920 --> 02:49:46.900]
It's been going on a week.

[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:49.420]
You know, I'm a woman listing you a lot of years.

[02:49:49.760 --> 02:49:49.960]
Yeah.

[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:53.880]
It seems like you're on this movie movie kick.

[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:54.320]
Yeah.

[02:49:54.320 --> 02:49:57.180]
We enjoy your program, but I think enough is enough.

[02:49:57.720 --> 02:49:57.860]
Yeah.

[02:49:57.860 --> 02:49:59.500]
How many votes you got on the survey?

[02:50:00.120 --> 02:50:02.220]
Don't come up to anything else you've ever done.

[02:50:03.300 --> 02:50:07.940]
What about the first hour when we had the first two hours when we had 400 votes on how you

[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:08.540]
wait your parents?

[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:10.180]
See, you're leaving those out.

[02:50:10.220 --> 02:50:11.420]
You're leaving those out, my friend.

[02:50:11.480 --> 02:50:11.600]
Yeah.

[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:14.100]
I'm just giving my opinion, Dale.

[02:50:14.240 --> 02:50:15.820]
Still going to listen to you in the greatest.

[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:16.760]
Okay, thanks.

[02:50:16.980 --> 02:50:19.100]
Enough is enough with this movie business.

[02:50:19.160 --> 02:50:20.460]
Thanks for the sloth, pal.

[02:50:20.760 --> 02:50:21.420]
Yeah, bye.

[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:22.360]
Have a great day.

[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:23.020]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:50:23.200 --> 02:50:24.000]
Thanks for the stab.

[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:26.320]
He's still going to listen, but enough.

[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:27.300]
And now it's not enough.

[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:29.960]
Well, we'll be done when I'm done when I feel I'm tired of it.

[02:50:30.660 --> 02:50:31.300]
He's still going to listen.

[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:31.820]
He just got through.

[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:36.820]
Tell me that in addition to which he many a day on these movie polls, we've had like 14,

[02:50:36.820 --> 02:50:40.000]
15 hundred votes, which we never have on an overnight poll on a weekend.

[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:40.280]
Yeah.

[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:42.580]
14, 15 is a spectacular response.

[02:50:44.220 --> 02:50:48.260]
Plus since he's into these things, the next one on the stats on our website now, I hate to break

[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:52.140]
the news to him, but the last two, three weeks in a row, we break the record for most hits every week.

[02:50:53.600 --> 02:50:55.300]
And let me just tell you this right now.

[02:50:55.580 --> 02:50:59.540]
Once they get a chance to see swinging more, we're going to like break him this weekend again too.

[02:50:59.600 --> 02:51:00.480]
I have that feeling, don't you?

[02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:00.940]
Yep.

[02:51:01.400 --> 02:51:02.860]
I can feel it in the pit of my sack.

[02:51:05.500 --> 02:51:07.200]
I mean, he's got to wait all of that time.

[02:51:07.240 --> 02:51:10.460]
Well, when you're going to quit this all right, when you're going to stop, what are you going to stop?

[02:51:10.680 --> 02:51:11.100]
I'm against that.

[02:51:11.200 --> 02:51:12.440]
I mean, like you, but we don't want to end it.

[02:51:12.640 --> 02:51:15.260]
And of course, if I were to ask him that magical question, no, right?

[02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:16.920]
I mean, I've been watching enough.

[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:18.780]
You notice that I even waste my time with that?

[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:20.680]
Like, what else would you like us to talk about?

[02:51:20.900 --> 02:51:23.960]
I mean, we finally let's down to something here that we haven't talked about for a long time.

[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:27.700]
We spent a few, you know, about three, not just a week, but at least about three weeks on it.

[02:51:28.120 --> 02:51:29.300]
But what's the big problem with that?

[02:51:29.600 --> 02:51:32.060]
You know, life is not going to disappear.

[02:51:32.420 --> 02:51:34.340]
We still got plenty of time to talk about other crap.

[02:51:34.900 --> 02:51:37.720]
I mean, we could talk about ball games. We could talk about the marlins.

[02:51:37.860 --> 02:51:38.960]
But I'm not going to do that.

[02:51:39.620 --> 02:51:39.900]
Yeah.

[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:43.540]
Jesus Christ, give me a break, man.

[02:51:43.540 --> 02:51:47.600]
We could talk, you know, sit here and change the world and talk about how W is a fascist.

[02:51:47.780 --> 02:51:50.660]
And John Ascroft isn't even bigger fascist and the audio, the audio.

[02:51:50.880 --> 02:51:52.560]
But, you know, let's, we already know that.

[02:51:52.740 --> 02:51:53.400]
Look on our website.

[02:51:53.560 --> 02:51:54.920]
Read some of the good crap on there, okay?

[02:51:55.160 --> 02:51:59.860]
It's on there every day, including a great feature story that's going to be on there for several days.

[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.040]
Conservatism here today, going to Marl by Dennis Rackonen.

[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:05.660]
The sensational piece.

[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:07.460]
If he asks me.

[02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:11.380]
It's just amazing about South Florida.

[02:52:11.380 --> 02:52:13.400]
I mean, here's a guy that likes the show.

[02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:14.900]
He loves me. He'll listen regardless.

[02:52:15.160 --> 02:52:17.720]
But he's got to give me, he's got to make my back bleed.

[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:20.300]
You know, he's got to give me like a little bloody spot.

[02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:27.600]
How many had like a little bloody spot from that day I'm in growing here, but my left nut is a heel bump.

[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:29.080]
Be very pleased to know sir.

[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:32.140]
My left testicle is heel up very nicely from me in growing here, okay?

[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:33.500]
Yeah, it's fine.

[02:52:34.860 --> 02:52:36.160]
Here's a call from Pemberpine.

[02:52:36.220 --> 02:52:36.480]
Hello?

[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:38.920]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:41.260]
All right, I have a few more recommendations.

[02:52:41.800 --> 02:52:42.980]
Well, how about recommendations?

[02:52:44.160 --> 02:52:47.360]
Well, yeah, like if you like a requiem for a dream, you'll love it.

[02:52:47.480 --> 02:52:47.760]
Yeah, Emily.

[02:52:48.440 --> 02:52:49.000]
It's a surprise.

[02:52:52.420 --> 02:52:52.820]
Emily?

[02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:54.020]
Emily.

[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:54.820]
Emily with a name.

[02:52:55.360 --> 02:52:55.820]
Oh, Emily.

[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:58.900]
Also, it's a horrible movie.

[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:00.540]
I thought that's what you put in your crankcase.

[02:53:01.120 --> 02:53:02.500]
What is it?

[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:04.740]
Repo Man with Emilio S.A.V.S.

[02:53:05.160 --> 02:53:05.420]
Okay.

[02:53:05.420 --> 02:53:06.940]
The worst movie of the Overseas.

[02:53:08.180 --> 02:53:10.380]
And worst actor, weird out on UHS.

[02:53:12.340 --> 02:53:13.060]
Okay, thanks.

[02:53:13.360 --> 02:53:14.500]
I have no idea what he just said.

[02:53:14.620 --> 02:53:16.520]
I mean, he just said a bunch of stuff.

[02:53:16.820 --> 02:53:16.820]

[02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:21.440]
Do any of those, are any of those of you sponsored our poll question?

[02:53:21.880 --> 02:53:22.080]
No.

[02:53:22.260 --> 02:53:23.400]
No, but he did say Emily.

[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:26.640]
Don't you put that in the crankcase to improve your oil thing?

[02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:28.580]
It would have been better if you had instead of watched it.

[02:53:28.980 --> 02:53:29.040]
Oh.

[02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:32.500]
Okay, so I'm crossing, of course, repo Man, that's when you wouldn't watch.

[02:53:32.940 --> 02:53:33.600]
I watched it.

[02:53:33.880 --> 02:53:34.240]
Did you?

[02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:34.620]
Yeah.

[02:53:35.360 --> 02:53:36.060]
It's weird.

[02:53:36.240 --> 02:53:36.520]
It's weird.

[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:36.660]
It's strange.

[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:38.600]
It's supposed to be.

[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:39.400]
I see.

[02:53:41.380 --> 02:53:43.180]
56670560, pound 560 on you.

[02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:45.040]
Look at the vote total, man.

[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.680]
Isn't anywhere near what we usually have?

[02:53:50.960 --> 02:53:55.580]
Only 283 votes since about 1215 since this thing went up there.

[02:53:58.860 --> 02:54:00.720]
48 for Shackle, Neil and Kazan.

[02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:03.100]
42 for Sophia Copeland, Godfather 3.

[02:54:03.100 --> 02:54:05.460]
And then Brittany and Bo Dereck are like side by each other.

[02:54:05.680 --> 02:54:07.540]
They're in lockstep, cheek to cheek.

[02:54:08.280 --> 02:54:10.000]
And that's it, with only 16 of pieces.

[02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:11.240]
It's a two horse race so far.

[02:54:11.500 --> 02:54:12.820]
I still say she wins by a big nose.

[02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:16.960]
We still love you, but we don't like what you're doing.

[02:54:16.980 --> 02:54:19.000]
No matter what it is, we don't care what it is you're talking about.

[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:19.920]
We're unhappy with it.

[02:54:20.060 --> 02:54:20.840]
We're so disgusted.

[02:54:21.060 --> 02:54:21.960]
I'm not already with this.

[02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:22.220]
Okay.

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:23.440]
Talk about something interesting.

[02:54:23.800 --> 02:54:24.900]
Talk about the notch.

[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:27.540]
Fly in local town.

[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:29.300]
You're sports radio 560.

[02:54:29.500 --> 02:54:29.900]
You ain't.

[02:54:30.040 --> 02:54:31.160]
You ain't.

[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:34.700]
Disgusting program.

[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:38.220]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[02:54:38.340 --> 02:54:39.180]
Good morning, Americans.

[02:54:39.180 --> 02:54:40.340]
It's Paul Harvey.

[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:41.900]
Stand by for news.

[02:54:43.020 --> 02:54:51.380]
Charles Stewart and his son Andrew of Fort Myers, Florida, go into the public's grocery store when they happen upon the condom pile.

[02:54:52.520 --> 02:54:56.880]
Andrew asks his father why there are so many different boxes of condoms.

[02:54:57.540 --> 02:54:59.820]
Charles replies well you see some.

[02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:03.100]
That three pack over there, that's for when you're in high school.

[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:06.500]
You have two for Friday night and one for Saturday night.

[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:11.000]
Is some Andrew asks well what's the six pack for?

[02:55:11.720 --> 02:55:14.360]
Is that replies well what's for when you're in college?

[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:20.200]
Son, you have two for Friday night and two for Saturday night and two for Sunday morning.

[02:55:21.220 --> 02:55:25.840]
Then Andrew asks his father what's the 12 pack for?

[02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:29.360]
His father replies well that's for when you're married son.

[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:32.160]
You have one for January, one for February.

[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:33.900]
Now page two.

[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:42.820]
Abigail and Reginald Lowry of Wichita, Kansas, returned from their honeymoon and it was obvious to everyone that they were not speaking to one another.

[02:55:43.440 --> 02:55:47.600]
The groom's best man Don Fieldz takes him aside and asks what's wrong?

[02:55:47.900 --> 02:55:53.000]
Well, said Reginald when we had finished making love the first night as I went to the bathroom.

[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.960]
For my quote of fifty dollar bill on the pillow without thinking.

[02:55:56.880 --> 02:56:01.740]
Well you shouldn't worry too much about that said Don I'm sure your wife will get over it soon.

[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:05.480]
She certainly can't expect that you've been saving yourself all these years.

[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:13.080]
Reginald nodded and said I don't know if I can get over this though she gave me twenty dollars change.

[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:15.700]
Paul Harvey, did they?

[02:56:16.340 --> 02:56:17.680]
He's a panic you know what?

[02:56:18.100 --> 02:56:19.040]
He's still alive.

[02:56:19.580 --> 02:56:20.220]
He's still doing it.

[02:56:20.220 --> 02:56:21.280]
He's still on the air.

[02:56:21.380 --> 02:56:22.240]
What do you mean is he's still alive?

[02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:26.220]
He's still got a studio in the basement in Chicago and he's still doing that show every goddamn day.

[02:56:26.800 --> 02:56:27.900]
He's got to play him.

[02:56:28.420 --> 02:56:30.140]
He's about 145 now.

[02:56:30.420 --> 02:56:30.840]
Good day.

[02:56:31.560 --> 02:56:32.940]
I beg your pardon?

[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:34.320]
It's still occasionally interesting.

[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:48.340]
You know, Joe Costello is a really big football fan and it really just breaks my heart to see somebody come along and stab him and throw it through the heart.

[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:51.100]
You know what I mean?

[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:52.040]
No.

[02:56:52.460 --> 02:56:52.660]
What?

[02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:56.180]
I'll let him have a camera too.

[02:56:57.180 --> 02:56:58.080]
You don't have to do that.

[02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:00.800]
Look he's a big star now.

[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:01.980]
He can afford his own damn tickets.

[02:57:02.880 --> 02:57:05.300]
This is a disturbing story from Cape Carnival.

[02:57:05.840 --> 02:57:11.580]
NASA is trying to identify a small object spotted floating outside the International Space Station yesterday according to a report.

[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:18.360]
Ground, let's see, astronaut Edelwee spotted the object outside the window of the U.S. laboratory and took pictures of it.

[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:21.040]
Local six news partner floored it today reported.

[02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:22.520]
This is Channel 6 in Orlando.

[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.380]
Ground controllers are analyzing lose photos but don't yet have enough information about the object's direction of travel.

[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:34.360]
To determine from whence it came the object which has moved out of sight is likely from the station itself according to the report.

[02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:38.860]
Or maybe just maybe it might be a flying sausage, you think?

[02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:39.520]
No.

[02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:46.660]
Now, do you know how many thousands of pieces of space junk we have floating around is that we put there?

[02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:49.020]
Oh yeah, this is all kind of crap out there.

[02:57:50.620 --> 02:57:53.500]
Now what is this thing that you just emailed me?

[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:55.140]
I mean the fact me, this email hint.

[02:57:55.320 --> 02:58:04.820]
The Hake Goldberg show is personal private email that I went in hacked my way in down there to the tent top and sent to Neil Rodg of me, George Rodriguez sent it to Neil.

[02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:06.460]
And I saw him do it.

[02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:06.980]
Yeah.

[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:11.060]
Well, here's one that says I'm not usually want to write to my congressman.

[02:58:11.060 --> 02:58:15.640]
In this case to a radio show host but you, Pharrell said something that I could not ignore.

[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:16.440]
I don't understand.

[02:58:17.260 --> 02:58:19.840]
It's on Hank's website but it's addressed to Pharrell.

[02:58:21.480 --> 02:58:22.160]
Am I right?

[02:58:23.420 --> 02:58:25.040]
I mean the message is Pharrell.

[02:58:25.160 --> 02:58:32.300]
Anyway, it says you were talking the story of the pregnant lady who fell two stories on the some sort of audio equipment and commented that baby was okay with you said I hope she dies.

[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:34.420]
I guess you want that child to go up without a mother.

[02:58:35.560 --> 02:58:39.600]
I understand there has to be some shock rather distinguishing feature which separates you from your peers.

[02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:43.980]
But this was a stupid low life classless remark that showed me just how much of a scumbag you are.

[02:58:44.300 --> 02:58:46.240]
What if it were my wife? What if it were Geltie's wife?

[02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:50.560]
Or friends wife that you may that you have many friends?

[02:58:51.260 --> 02:58:54.260]
Or not, friends with bad citizen punctuation?

[02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:55.500]
Not that you have many friends.

[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:58.280]
Even if you made the whole story up it still shows our classless you are.

[02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.620]
Is wishing a pregnant mother death going to increase ratings?

[02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:03.140]
Nope. You just lost at least two list is probably more.

[02:59:04.000 --> 02:59:09.580]
Since they changed the schedule to accommodate you have been turned off by your ugly, tear your throat already, raspy voice.

[02:59:09.940 --> 02:59:12.020]
And I'm convinced that I'll never listen to repulsing show again.

[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:15.660]
Hank and others will do what we do to get rid of this POS piece of schmit.

[02:59:16.660 --> 02:59:17.940]
That's why they sent this to Hank.

[02:59:18.940 --> 02:59:22.880]
Also, there's another email that says I want to book Mozo for my child's third birthday.

[02:59:23.820 --> 02:59:30.800]
I'll say to Andy what time is chronic Tim and primitive pines is I got them all beat the worst ever Lou Ferrigno in Hercules.

[02:59:32.340 --> 02:59:33.840]
Do you want to put that on there?

[02:59:34.640 --> 02:59:36.820]
Whatever. I can't stand Lou Ferrigno.

[02:59:36.900 --> 02:59:39.140]
No, it makes me nauseous.

[02:59:39.560 --> 02:59:41.500]
Lou Ferrigno and Hercules get it on there man.

[02:59:42.180 --> 02:59:44.700]
It's a two horse race. There's no point in looking at the other ones.

[02:59:44.980 --> 02:59:51.280]
Although sliced alone has moved into a tie with bowderek and with Brittany for rhinestone 16 votes.

[02:59:51.620 --> 02:59:53.900]
But the top two are like so far ahead of everybody else.

[02:59:53.960 --> 02:59:55.480]
The worst acting performance ever in a movie.

[02:59:55.480 --> 02:59:57.480]
Shaquille O'Neal in Kazan 51.

[02:59:57.860 --> 02:59:59.700]
Sophia Coppola got for the 346.

[02:59:59.980 --> 03:00:02.580]
And everybody else. I mean the next highest is 16 small potatoes.

[03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:06.820]
And if we were talking about something important today like Ma Zhong, we'd have thousands of votes.

[03:00:06.960 --> 03:00:07.240]
You know what?

[03:00:07.880 --> 03:00:08.660]
Oh man.

[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:11.480]
For the fact that you suck me in all this goddamn movie crap.

[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:12.500]
Mm-hmm. What about that?

[03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:14.040]
And you know this in the middle of talking about movies.

[03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:16.520]
Did one person call today saying anything about Gregory Peck?

[03:00:16.560 --> 03:00:17.540]
No. No. No.

[03:00:19.240 --> 03:00:22.840]
Gentlemen's agreement to kill a mocking bird, spellbound, movie break.

[03:00:23.440 --> 03:00:25.900]
Movies dick. What the hell's wrong with you people man?

[03:00:26.800 --> 03:00:29.240]
Gregory Peck 87, one of the great actors of all time.

[03:00:29.480 --> 03:00:34.060]
And you see the problem is that except for movie buffs like George and old farts like me.

[03:00:34.760 --> 03:00:36.500]
Nobody out there knows from Gregory Peck.

[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:37.800]
Right?

[03:00:38.740 --> 03:00:40.880]
Yeah, Bean or Boy what do you know about Gregory's Peck?

[03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:42.540]
Tiny.

[03:00:43.940 --> 03:00:46.860]
Seriously you don't know from Gregory Peck. Have you ever seen a movie with him in it?

[03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:48.980]
To kill a mockingbird.

[03:00:49.260 --> 03:00:50.480]
You did see to kill a mockingbird.

[03:00:50.680 --> 03:00:50.760]
Yeah.

[03:00:51.760 --> 03:00:54.000]
And now you think that black guy did it or not?

[03:00:55.160 --> 03:00:56.980]
He just needed to bust the script.

[03:00:57.300 --> 03:00:59.480]
It doesn't require a response.

[03:00:59.480 --> 03:01:01.100]
It was just a little joke.

[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:01.520]

[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:04.160]
See now the same person that sent that facts to Hank about for real.

[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:05.620]
Now they're going to be sent what about me.

[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:06.520]
See the same old crap.

[03:01:07.040 --> 03:01:08.380]
He said that the guy done it.

[03:01:08.460 --> 03:01:09.220]
We know he didn't do it.

[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:10.200]
It's just a joke.

[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:13.200]
And then of course there was that one about anti-Semitism.

[03:01:13.760 --> 03:01:14.620]
Gentlemen's agreement, right?

[03:01:14.900 --> 03:01:15.040]
Right.

[03:01:15.540 --> 03:01:15.960]
You saw that?

[03:01:16.160 --> 03:01:16.320]
Mm-hmm.

[03:01:17.160 --> 03:01:17.620]
Bean or Boy?

[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:18.260]
It's been a long time ago.

[03:01:20.780 --> 03:01:21.180]
Yes.

[03:01:21.640 --> 03:01:22.520]
No you didn't.

[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:24.940]
So now I hear you some homework for you.

[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:27.820]
Start watching some of the older stuff with some really great actors.

[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:28.180]
Okay?

[03:01:28.520 --> 03:01:31.360]
It's great that you're up to date all these recent movies last few years.

[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:31.900]
That's fine.

[03:01:32.260 --> 03:01:32.660]
That's great.

[03:01:32.860 --> 03:01:33.400]
It's very helpful.

[03:01:33.940 --> 03:01:35.060]
Well I haven't been alive that long.

[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:36.360]
Then that's the point.

[03:01:37.100 --> 03:01:38.000]
That's the point.

[03:01:38.560 --> 03:01:40.320]
Look at all you got to catch up on.

[03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:40.660]
See?

[03:01:43.640 --> 03:01:44.040]
Right?

[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:45.160]
Yeah.

[03:01:45.560 --> 03:01:46.880]
How about you name and see Rainman?

[03:01:49.440 --> 03:01:50.060]
Did you?

[03:01:50.540 --> 03:01:51.120]
Who's in that?

[03:01:54.660 --> 03:01:55.520]
You see what I mean?

[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:58.060]
Now we're starting to get to the bottom of this.

[03:01:58.340 --> 03:01:59.780]
Mr. Big Shot, Mr. Expert.

[03:02:00.980 --> 03:02:02.460]
And they're like giving me a bunch of crap.

[03:02:02.580 --> 03:02:04.240]
And it's everything so because I come on here admitting.

[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:05.420]
I don't know too much about this.

[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:08.360]
Which is something that I can learn from and everybody else as well.

[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:09.360]
K-Wart sucks.

[03:02:10.180 --> 03:02:10.440]
Right.

[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:11.440]
You didn't see that movie.

[03:02:13.460 --> 03:02:13.660]
He saw it.

[03:02:13.660 --> 03:02:15.480]
What George just told up a line D.

[03:02:15.480 --> 03:02:16.960]
He right there done and hold it up for it.

[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:17.140]
Right.

[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:17.960]
Hand signals.

[03:02:18.300 --> 03:02:21.260]
Favorite scene was when he's bouncing his head against the wall because the alarm's going off.

[03:02:21.560 --> 03:02:23.640]
How about the hospital with George C. Scott?

[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:25.440]
That one I haven't seen.

[03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:26.120]
Ah!

[03:02:26.440 --> 03:02:28.140]
It's on my list by the way on our websites.

[03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:28.820]
It's on my list.

[03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:31.740]
Another petty, trashy piece of brilliance.

[03:02:32.000 --> 03:02:32.140]
Okay.

[03:02:32.280 --> 03:02:33.100]
Absolute brilliance.

[03:02:33.140 --> 03:02:36.720]
And if you look up in my bone book, it's got four big fat bones.

[03:02:37.080 --> 03:02:37.180]
Okay.

[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:40.100]
Even Moe would be jealous.

[03:02:40.460 --> 03:02:42.040]
My and local.

[03:02:42.620 --> 03:02:44.320]
This is 4356.

[03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:46.160]
You way, you way.

[03:02:46.620 --> 03:02:46.620]

[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:50.620]
Why are you bastard?

[03:02:51.140 --> 03:02:54.280]
What if no wheels don't be a ringline?

[03:02:55.220 --> 03:02:56.960]
I'll be missing a snack.

[03:02:57.440 --> 03:02:59.900]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:01.080]
We're in love.

[03:03:03.860 --> 03:03:05.240]
Baby, don't do it.

[03:03:05.480 --> 03:03:06.800]
We're in love.

[03:03:07.160 --> 03:03:07.940]
Call it all along.

[03:03:08.220 --> 03:03:08.520]
What?

[03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:10.980]
She'll don't do it.

[03:03:11.780 --> 03:03:14.360]
It's torture, thrilled, they're getting married.

[03:03:14.700 --> 03:03:17.080]
But people want me to be wary.

[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:19.900]
The juxtalist, a mappella.

[03:03:20.340 --> 03:03:22.800]
Sure, I might burn here with your talent.

[03:03:23.140 --> 03:03:25.600]
I can't believe you want a very bad ass like.

[03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:28.700]
Each one had enough of writing, Alamoni checks.

[03:03:29.140 --> 03:03:31.220]
Although she never been Atlas or Raven,

[03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:34.220]
I hope her baby is already very smart, baby.

[03:03:34.840 --> 03:03:37.340]
Well, he is honky, my love honky.

[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:39.320]
So just believe us alone.

[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:43.320]
This baby about him, I am not just yet very good.

[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:46.720]
He loves me and my body was so good.

[03:03:47.200 --> 03:03:50.940]
I won't have enough, because he makes more than me.

[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:54.380]
Right, then I die and I'm so glad.

[03:03:54.900 --> 03:03:57.680]
That's a real dead girl just to bend the priest's chest.

[03:03:57.840 --> 03:04:00.300]
Just show love, you're making me mad.

[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:03.040]
Just like his newbie, this marriage will be bad.

[03:04:03.420 --> 03:04:05.760]
But I don't want to be alone.

[03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:08.840]
He's for your king, but why not just be that boy alone?

[03:04:09.240 --> 03:04:11.440]
Now we talk once again.

[03:04:11.900 --> 03:04:13.180]
It will work on your finance.

[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:14.840]
So I wish you.

[03:04:16.860 --> 03:04:18.120]
155.560 WQM.

[03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:20.420]
I just saw the other pictures there of Ian and what's your name?

[03:04:21.180 --> 03:04:21.320]
Yeah.

[03:04:21.740 --> 03:04:24.440]
So I guess you'll pick out whichever one that we want to put on there.

[03:04:24.600 --> 03:04:25.060]
We'll pick it.

[03:04:25.660 --> 03:04:28.660]
Well, see, but that's a problem when people send us more than one picture.

[03:04:29.420 --> 03:04:32.380]
And then, you know, you guys have to pick out one that's going to be on there.

[03:04:32.440 --> 03:04:34.160]
And then they'll have to deliver the results of that.

[03:04:34.160 --> 03:04:34.660]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:36.600]
But I'm sure you'll do a fair job.

[03:04:36.660 --> 03:04:38.620]
I'm going to pick out the one that you want to see Rodic and Exotic.

[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:38.800]

[03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:46.100]
It's going to be interesting this time, I think.

[03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:46.460]
No, sir.

[03:04:46.560 --> 03:04:48.340]
Because the first time was a foregone conclusion.

[03:04:48.540 --> 03:04:50.700]
We had the one virtually, well, no, they weren't naked.

[03:04:51.180 --> 03:04:52.920]
They weren't naked, couple spread out in the sack.

[03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:56.620]
And then we had the other couple of the two models, Aaron and Amy,

[03:04:56.620 --> 03:04:58.300]
who obviously were, if they weren't going to win,

[03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:00.760]
we're like right on somebody's ass and they did win.

[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:04.720]
If this time, I think it's an open, an open battlefield.

[03:05:05.500 --> 03:05:10.020]
Unlike our pool, two horse race, worst acting performance ever in a movie was

[03:05:10.020 --> 03:05:12.500]
Shaquille O'Neill, Kazem, 51 votes.

[03:05:12.820 --> 03:05:15.100]
Sophia Coppola, Godfather 3, dead.

[03:05:15.480 --> 03:05:15.880]
48.

[03:05:16.120 --> 03:05:16.740]
And that's it.

[03:05:16.840 --> 03:05:18.600]
Next, next, next, next high total of stilly 16.

[03:05:19.540 --> 03:05:22.340]
This is our last movie show for this month, okay?

[03:05:24.280 --> 03:05:25.220]
You hear what I just said?

[03:05:25.300 --> 03:05:25.700]
I heard it.

[03:05:26.060 --> 03:05:26.460]
No, seriously.

[03:05:27.000 --> 03:05:28.460]
Because I don't want to get that guy all upset.

[03:05:28.460 --> 03:05:30.740]
Plus, there are many others out there who are like forming at the mouth.

[03:05:30.740 --> 03:05:32.860]
Oh my God, you've been going on for weeks with this crap.

[03:05:32.980 --> 03:05:34.200]
Well, we had a good time with it.

[03:05:34.260 --> 03:05:34.480]
I did.

[03:05:34.760 --> 03:05:35.040]
I did.

[03:05:35.560 --> 03:05:38.020]
And look at all the money I was able to spend in part of the economy up here,

[03:05:38.080 --> 03:05:38.560]
which they needed.

[03:05:39.260 --> 03:05:39.580]
Badly.

[03:05:40.800 --> 03:05:43.260]
All these Saurus-free movies that I was able to go out and buy.

[03:05:44.080 --> 03:05:45.180]
I think it's spectacular.

[03:05:45.300 --> 03:05:45.840]
Nice job, Neil.

[03:05:45.840 --> 03:05:46.320]
Thank you.

[03:05:47.640 --> 03:05:50.060]
And you actually learned something, as opposed to,

[03:05:50.280 --> 03:05:52.500]
well, gee, I think the Aikis can win the pen, you know,

[03:05:52.540 --> 03:05:54.200]
the kind of crap that's on so much of the day.

[03:05:54.320 --> 03:05:56.200]
It just, it makes my teeth ache.

[03:05:56.660 --> 03:05:57.700]
It makes my bones rattle.

[03:06:00.140 --> 03:06:03.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[03:06:04.040 --> 03:06:04.900]
And for Ryzen Wireless Line.

[03:06:05.060 --> 03:06:06.700]
So don't let me forget Monday if I even mention them.

[03:06:06.860 --> 03:06:09.020]
I'll probably well have to mention if I went out and bought these.

[03:06:09.260 --> 03:06:09.620]
Any of the three.

[03:06:09.800 --> 03:06:10.340]
I'll set it off the air.

[03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:11.980]
Off the air.

[03:06:12.080 --> 03:06:12.780]
Not on the air.

[03:06:13.740 --> 03:06:15.640]
We draw the line right here at two o'clock.

[03:06:15.720 --> 03:06:18.560]
When the little hand hits the big hand, we draw the line.

[03:06:19.900 --> 03:06:22.120]
Because on Monday, I think we're going to start doing sports talk.

[03:06:23.460 --> 03:06:24.340]
Oh, right.

[03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:26.440]
Here's a call from Palm Beach.

[03:06:26.620 --> 03:06:26.740]
Hello.

[03:06:26.740 --> 03:06:27.560]
Hey, Neil.

[03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:28.400]
Yes, sir.

[03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:29.220]
Great.

[03:06:29.720 --> 03:06:31.040]
Hey, I love the movie shows.

[03:06:31.160 --> 03:06:31.760]
Keep doing it, man.

[03:06:32.620 --> 03:06:33.060]
Right.

[03:06:33.060 --> 03:06:33.900]
I don't care.

[03:06:34.880 --> 03:06:38.440]
But I've got two really disgusting performances to give you.

[03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:39.160]
Okay.

[03:06:39.380 --> 03:06:40.820]
One was filming Miami.

[03:06:41.000 --> 03:06:45.820]
It was Jimmy Stewart in Airport 77, which was just pitiful.

[03:06:46.820 --> 03:06:49.500]
And the other one, I guess I would say, you said OJ already,

[03:06:49.660 --> 03:06:51.680]
but OJ and towering in Ferno had to be worse.

[03:06:51.800 --> 03:06:52.300]
Oh, yeah.

[03:06:52.480 --> 03:06:53.260]
I saw that.

[03:06:54.040 --> 03:06:54.900]
He was little.

[03:06:54.900 --> 03:06:55.920]
He was ugly.

[03:06:56.020 --> 03:06:57.560]
That was his first role, I think.

[03:06:57.800 --> 03:06:58.780]
It was a killer, yeah.

[03:06:59.660 --> 03:07:01.580]
So, but yeah, keep going with the movie shows.

[03:07:02.060 --> 03:07:02.320]
Okay.

[03:07:02.920 --> 03:07:03.520]
Hang in there.

[03:07:03.640 --> 03:07:03.960]
Thanks.

[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:04.820]
You too.

[03:07:05.260 --> 03:07:05.740]
See, there you go.

[03:07:05.820 --> 03:07:06.780]
Here's the guy who says he likes it.

[03:07:06.860 --> 03:07:07.680]
So that evens it out.

[03:07:08.540 --> 03:07:09.900]
The other older, older guy.

[03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:11.380]
And this guy seemed like under the age of 100.

[03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:12.540]
Now, the other guy is okay.

[03:07:12.660 --> 03:07:14.060]
He just is grouchy, you know.

[03:07:14.740 --> 03:07:16.140]
He's upset that it rains every day.

[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:18.160]
And he's like mosquitoes the size of bowling balls.

[03:07:18.600 --> 03:07:20.760]
And it's a human in 100 degrees in the shade.

[03:07:20.960 --> 03:07:22.020]
And he's upset about that.

[03:07:22.480 --> 03:07:23.800]
And nobody goes to the Marlon Games.

[03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:24.920]
And nobody cares about it.

[03:07:25.440 --> 03:07:26.400]
And all of these things.

[03:07:28.200 --> 03:07:30.700]
Just like, you know, Farrell, who's, you know, good guy.

[03:07:30.860 --> 03:07:32.500]
But he just, and then he finally admitted.

[03:07:32.620 --> 03:07:34.600]
You notice the end of our crossover this morning.

[03:07:34.600 --> 03:07:35.740]
He admitted he's jealous.

[03:07:37.300 --> 03:07:40.480]
I guarantee I bet your Carlos is salary for the next 10 years.

[03:07:40.640 --> 03:07:41.280]
At least 50 bucks.

[03:07:41.580 --> 03:07:43.960]
I bet you that much that he's wishes he could do the show

[03:07:43.960 --> 03:07:44.860]
from someplace else.

[03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:48.060]
Because you know, he's only been there a short period of time.

[03:07:48.340 --> 03:07:48.860]
I'll tell you a lot.

[03:07:48.880 --> 03:07:50.300]
It says a lot about South Florida.

[03:07:50.300 --> 03:07:53.100]
When the most exciting thing you have to do every day after your work

[03:07:53.100 --> 03:07:55.760]
is you want to play golf with a silly old man like Moe.

[03:07:55.800 --> 03:07:56.620]
What does that tell you?

[03:07:57.980 --> 03:07:59.680]
Yeah, I think that speaks volumes.

[03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:02.800]
And he finally admitted that he's jealous of this kind of a deal.

[03:08:02.980 --> 03:08:04.920]
He wishes he only wishes he could still be in New York

[03:08:04.920 --> 03:08:06.200]
and do a show every day from there.

[03:08:06.500 --> 03:08:06.880]
When you think?

[03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:07.920]
What would think?

[03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:09.680]
One would certainly think so.

[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:10.760]
I mean, if you had a choice.

[03:08:11.680 --> 03:08:12.040]
Anywhere.

[03:08:13.380 --> 03:08:13.740]
Almost.

[03:08:14.920 --> 03:08:15.640]
Here's Hollywood.

[03:08:15.880 --> 03:08:16.040]
Hello.

[03:08:16.520 --> 03:08:17.720]
I love your show.

[03:08:18.040 --> 03:08:19.780]
Can you please take me on a bus and tell me my old,

[03:08:19.780 --> 03:08:22.300]
Amy Uncle, Grandfather in Del Rey.

[03:08:23.860 --> 03:08:25.280]
What the hell was that?

[03:08:28.780 --> 03:08:29.960]
What was that?

[03:08:30.700 --> 03:08:32.760]
Can I please play for his old Jaime Ankle,

[03:08:32.920 --> 03:08:34.560]
a grandfather sitting at a bench in Del Rey?

[03:08:34.700 --> 03:08:35.180]
No, no.

[03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:39.580]
We don't have time to play sitting at a bench in Del Rey for your old Jaime Ankle or anybody else right at time.

[03:08:40.660 --> 03:08:42.820]
When I were going to do a big crossover with a man dog,

[03:08:44.480 --> 03:08:46.500]
now you see the way I located his four hours in a,

[03:08:46.600 --> 03:08:47.840]
four hours only got a two hour show,

[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:49.840]
but four hours is more than enough for me when you think,

[03:08:50.060 --> 03:08:50.900]
jizz for a minute.

[03:08:51.060 --> 03:08:52.660]
Now that we see all these other two hours shows,

[03:08:52.660 --> 03:08:54.940]
including some guys that show up like once in a while,

[03:08:55.080 --> 03:08:56.740]
like whatever the hell they feel like.

[03:08:57.080 --> 03:08:57.440]
Yeah.

[03:08:58.320 --> 03:08:59.480]
I'm starting to get jealous.

[03:09:00.160 --> 03:09:03.740]
See, what it basically boils down to is everybody saw the good deal that I had.

[03:09:03.840 --> 03:09:05.940]
And now everybody's trying to like, they're taking my advice.

[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:07.520]
Less work, more pay.

[03:09:07.640 --> 03:09:10.120]
So they're like trying to want up each other, you know?

[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:12.720]
So Hank has done a three hours, gets the same pay.

[03:09:13.000 --> 03:09:15.460]
He's on like to Lamarlin Games, which a lot of days it's at 6.30.

[03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:17.180]
Some days he's not on it all hardly.

[03:09:17.640 --> 03:09:18.300]
We're like a half an hour.

[03:09:18.520 --> 03:09:20.020]
And out of man dogs, he's all of that going on.

[03:09:20.080 --> 03:09:21.640]
He says, well, I'll show you guys a thing or two.

[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:23.280]
I got like an ace in a hole, you know?

[03:09:23.860 --> 03:09:24.660]
My ace in a hole.

[03:09:25.040 --> 03:09:25.480]
Joe Rose.

[03:09:27.260 --> 03:09:29.120]
So, you know, I just want you to up some days.

[03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:30.960]
And some days we'll put that ace hole on there.

[03:09:31.740 --> 03:09:33.680]
Don't forget Monday morning, crucial morning,

[03:09:33.880 --> 03:09:35.340]
will Gellie show up or not?

[03:09:35.460 --> 03:09:36.300]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:09:36.780 --> 03:09:39.700]
Can you do a russian show on 560 to MQA?

[03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:40.940]
Miami for Mario.

[03:09:41.380 --> 03:09:41.800]
I got done.
