[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]
Everybody, okay!

[00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.400]
Okay.

[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.460]
Well, day here it is, the world,

[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.920]
When the screening days meet the rest of the girl

[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.520]
In the closet no more, that's what day day is for.

[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.980]
It's a day, day after all!

[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.520]
Oh!

[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.680]
It's a day of fun when we wear red shirts

[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.320]
And when we all come, you can hear us squirts

[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.200]
We can tickle and tease us with our manicure

[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.280]
Go cheese to get a day after all!

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.880]
We hold the hands in its end,

[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.520]
Sure, let them watch the lines of an alley marching

[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.680]
And the nature is streaked with a kiss

[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.580]
On the cheek, it's a day after all!

[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.080]
All right!

[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.580]
We can wear tight shorts,

[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.320]
They have gold blown me

[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.580]
And wear mascara like a leasing

[00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.360]
We can then sew way as we dance

[00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.180]
And sashay to get a day after all!

[00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.260]
MGM will have a celebrity ball

[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.800]
Posted by a reptillar and root ball

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.460]
There'll be Mervyn Hockey Rock

[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.120]
Not to mention Beat like hot!

[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.500]
It's a day after all!

[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.780]
Oh!

[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.380]
It's a day after all!

[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.180]
It's a day after all!

[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.860]

[00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.180]
It's a day after all!

[00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.240]
We're gonna have only six votes to go for 2000, Bonerboy!

[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.120]
Oh my!

[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.260]
Oh my!

[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.420]
I think we can do it!

[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.320]
Yes, we can!

[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.080]
And we won't give another result until we get the even 2000

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.120]
I think that's the first time we've had 2000 votes on a poll since the Alien Days

[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.960]
When you say?

[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.740]
I don't know.

[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.840]
I don't know.

[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.240]
You know what I'm talking to you?

[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.840]
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to Jorge there, okay?

[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.700]
I didn't want to look at the stats page in those days.

[00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.080]
No, it's not on here.

[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.860]
You're not gonna find that.

[00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.540]
That goes back a long ways, but I'm just thinking.

[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.160]
In fact, maybe even back then we never had 2000.

[00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.560]
But in any rate, we need just six more votes on Feral,

[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.680]
who's not, you notice how he's like crushing over which is fine,

[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.180]
but pretty soon he's gonna be doing 6A into 2.

[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.660]
And what's wrong with that?

[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.100]
You know, something as long as I get paid, I say.

[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.400]
Oh!

[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.580]
Like that old part that call on Friday right out of the box.

[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.700]
Why don't you just do us a favor and retire, Neil?

[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.180]
Tomorrow is payday, though.

[00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.140]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.220]
For some of us.

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.900]
For some of us, not for Bonerboy because he's a bad boy.

[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.260]
And because he wouldn't bear it for our program director.

[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.980]
That's the problem.

[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.340]
See, when you were cooperating with Duff, when he was program director,

[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.360]
you notice how he used to get paid?

[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.620]
Yeah.

[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.480]
But now you're not cooperating with a new program director

[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.280]
and your pay is being withheld.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.620]
It's being held in trust.

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.740]
Okay, let's refresh that thing and see how that came out.

[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.220]
How about those ducks, huh?

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.740]
Wow, I can't believe it.

[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.460]
It's actually had two games with goals being scored

[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.700]
in like a little bit of excitement.

[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.640]
And Game 7, the night everybody, even George is going to be watching Game 7

[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.240]
the night, aren't you?

[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.260]
Sorry, what?

[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.940]
The ducks in the devil?

[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.460]
Oh, 1999, the next vote!

[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.780]
Better get the drum roll out.

[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.280]
Here we go.

[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.160]
Just one moment, please.

[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.400]
The next vote.

[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.220]
Well, look at that 2005.

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:27.720]
It's not even close.

[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.520]
I mean, the freshman and the sophomore, you got to just get them laid.

[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.340]
There you go.

[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.360]
2005 votes.

[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.100]
What's your take on Scott Farrell?

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.460]
I'll tell you, there's certainly a topic there that this audience

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.580]
is emotional about.

[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.540]
Great.

[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.580]
One of on six to 10 a.m.

[00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.980]
Oh!

[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.220]
800 and seven votes, 40.2%.

[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.900]
Now that's, and keep in mind, he's only been on for a week.

[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.460]
He's only been on here for a week.

[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.460]
And almost half of this audience, this picky,

[00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.040]
nagging, never happy, hard to please audience, almost 50%

[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.360]
one of them on six to two.

[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.720]
Six to 10 a.m.

[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.640]
I think things are starting to look a little dark for Moe,

[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.460]
because Joe wants his five to six hour back,

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.560]
and the audience wants Farrell on six to 10.

[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.920]
It's starting to look a little bit dark for him, Moe.

[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.280]
Especially in a lot of the fact I turn him on this morning,

[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.320]
I hop out of the sack, I come in here, I get everything all going.

[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.680]
I turn him on, he's talking about the guy,

[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.260]
then Marlins again, and about Mike Lowell, this,

[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.560]
and Mike Lowell, oh geez, I ran out of here.

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.380]
I ran into the three S.H.

[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.440]
is faster than you could like, do it.

[00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.240]
2005 votes, 807, one of on six to 10 a.m.

[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.300]
Only listen to Neil, 346, but that's only 17.2%.

[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.100]
It's usually about 30 in it.

[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.120]
Yeah.

[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.300]
He's good, but keep him on 8 to 10 a.m.

[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.580]
212, 10 point, another 10 and a half percent.

[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.580]
So that right there, just those two categories,

[00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.880]
put him over 50%.

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.120]
That voice killed my pets, 195 wise guys, 9.7%.

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.600]
He's okay, there's another 164, another 8.1%.

[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.440]
Are you following this?

[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.940]
Uh-huh.

[00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.160]
Who's he, 136?

[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.400]
Can't stay at him only 83, and he's weak 62.

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.460]
That's only 7.1% negative.

[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.480]
They love you Farrell, they're doing it.

[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.180]
I don't think they're, I trust me.

[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.420]
Oh, oh, see, I taped that for money, comes on,

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.440]
and I got the beast in it.

[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.240]
Shut up beast.

[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.560]
You're screwing around, you're messing up with my droppings,

[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.100]
you idiot.

[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.800]
God.

[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.540]
Speaking of fat people.

[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.300]
Let's see, here's the fact that I wanted the debate

[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.040]
between Al Franken, Molly Evans, Bill or Rob.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.480]
I watched it, yeah, it was fantastic.

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.740]
Yeah, we had that on our website.

[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.460]
Okay, it's old news.

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.900]
Thank you.

[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.880]
Thank you very much.

[00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.240]
Outbreak of concern.

[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.140]
First, there was West Nile virus spread from birds to mosquitoes,

[00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140]
and out of humans, then there was SARS, believed

[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.200]
or operated, originated the animals in China,

[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.880]
and somehow passed on to people.

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.820]
Now there's another new animal demand infection to worry about.

[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.880]
Monkeypox.

[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.600]
Oi!

[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.520]
Ready for that?

[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.880]
No, not right now.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.420]
Only in this particular story, just notice, there was a typo.

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.020]
They left the decay out of the monkey.

[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.380]
It says, moneypox.

[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.820]
Yeah, that's a venerboy's new disease, moneypox,

[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.240]
which he's going to catch a bad dose of tomorrow on payday.

[00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.480]
The relatively rare virus has turned up for the first time

[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.800]
in the U.S. where at least 28 people in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana

[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.300]
have come down with the disease.

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.360]
It appears most of these have one thing in common.

[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.560]
They all came into contact with prairie dogs,

[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.060]
roamed-like creatures imported from Africa,

[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.380]
which would become popular pets.

[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.720]
Prairie dogs.

[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.980]
Don't be getting no prairie dog unless you want to get sick.

[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.380]
The oldest causes, rashes, fevers, and large lymph nodes

[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.960]
has thought to be an offshoot of smallpox,

[00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.300]
although it's less infectious and rarely fatal.

[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.360]
It's believed the pet distributor in Chicago may be ground zero

[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.460]
for the outbreak after a chiptome prairie dogs and ill-gambian rat

[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.660]
to Milwaukee.

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.560]
There's nothing worse than ill-gambian rat.

[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.540]
The search is on for other states that may have received similar exotic cargo.

[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.360]
Health officials expect more cases will be reporting out the symptoms

[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.140]
have been publicized.

[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.080]
There have been no deaths as a result of this infection yet.

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.520]
Monkeypox.

[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.300]
Oi!

[00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.340]
Always have to have something to keep us on edge.

[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.940]
Have you noticed that?

[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.420]
Mm-hmm.

[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.760]
So anyway, speaking of gay days in Disney World,

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.560]
the trickle of anybody in the crowd at gay days this weekend,

[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.920]
I bet you I know somebody who was there.

[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.360]
I don't want to mention no names on here.

[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.160]
Somebody we haven't spoken to yet this morning has been in our studio.

[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.440]
Who?

[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.280]
Who?

[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.220]
The trickle of redshirt and Disney enthusiasts first appeared in the parking lot

[00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.580]
more than a mile by Mono Rail or Ferry boat from their intended destination.

[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.240]
They were taken the ferry boat.

[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.440]
By journeys and just inside the gates of all Disney's world's magic kingdom,

[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.180]
the trickle became a sea of red.

[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.000]
The throng of people matching on symbols, most of whom had never met,

[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100]
was more than by coincidence.

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.880]
Saturday with the annual gay day at Disney attracting several thousand gays and lesbians,

[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.140]
whose choice of hue was allowing them to share the experience together.

[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.280]
They were sharing it together.

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.120]
You could feel comfortable holding hands, Flready and Birdie.com stocks

[00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.280]
said of the atmospheric gay day.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.120]
One of a week long series of gay related, oh, it goes on all week?

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.460]
I didn't know that.

[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.300]
She says, you're not worrying if you're going to get hurt,

[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.600]
everybody should be this free.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.540]
Red appeared to be the most singular popular color Saturday,

[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.100]
but crowds of visitors at the magic kingdom looked little different from any average group

[00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.620]
on a summer day at the South Procline happiest place on earth.

[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.520]
A couple from the Netherlands, Mark Ulrich Winklar,

[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.560]
and did Rick Ulrich Winklar, said they were amazed by the welcoming environment

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.880]
as they threw the park with friends.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:29.900]
Mark Ulrich Winklar, who's from Amsterdam, said that Gades or Lando's been as comfortable as gay festivals

[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.060]
in the Netherlands where he said homosexuality is accepted and same-sex marriages are legal

[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.100]
in Amsterdam and it's an issue anymore.

[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.740]
Mark Ulrich Winklar said it's nice to see people here can be themselves.

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.060]
Isn't that sweet?

[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:41.440]
Ah.

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.660]
Not everyone wore red.

[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.100]
Vesia, a 24-year-old Orlando drag queen who has to be identified only by a state's name,

[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.940]
sported a bright green, two-piece flower dress and matching head.

[00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.460]
Others including Mark Ulrich Winklar.

[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.680]
This is a story in a Sunsendle and they must repeat this asshole's name about 50 times.

[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.000]
I don't own a red shirt and I don't want to buy a well-read one for this day.

[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.220]
He said beside I heard that white was another option.

[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.620]
Oh, there you go.

[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.780]
I guess there were some banters there.

[00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:15.720]
Alan Williams, part of a banter's church group from Georgia, said he would have asked to change the group's travel plans

[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.000]
that he'd known this was Gades.

[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:23.280]
Another member of the church group, Mary White, said they didn't mind the atmosphere but wouldn't want to come back for a second day of Gades' fun.

[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.920]
We can't take two days of Gades, a 49-year-old church member joke.

[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:27.880]
She jokes.

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.260]
She was like, hurtling as he said it.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:33.260]
One day we could handle it but two days we couldn't stomach it.

[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.700]
I saw a movie speaking of stomach it yesterday afternoon that was so damn good.

[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.340]
Thanks to the punks in the audience who recommended this even though you guys poop-pooed it.

[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.220]
Somebody poop-pooed it.

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.080]
Wasn't me.

[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.880]
I think it was Bonerboy.

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.180]
Now, this is one of you, because I remember.

[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.080]
I think you're delusional.

[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.260]
No, somebody said, oh, you don't want to see that.

[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.160]
It's how to be called.

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:52.700]
It was.

[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.180]
Yeah, right.

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.040]
Anyway, it was damn good.

[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:56.800]
Rules of attraction.

[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800]
I give it a 10.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.880]
Now, not as good as some of the other tens.

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.920]
You know what I mean?

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:02.580]
You're being as relative.

[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.760]
It's not in the same genre.

[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.880]
But in terms of enjoyment, in terms of the way it was made, in terms of the acting, in terms of the amusement, in terms of the make-believe sex.

[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.860]
The acting was great.

[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.180]
Rules of attraction.

[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.000]
Which I usually can't stand James Vanderbeek.

[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.220]
Good Dutchboy, James Vanderbeek.

[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.920]
But he was great.

[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.220]
He was outstanding.

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.300]
He was like the main character.

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.440]
And Jessica Beel.

[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:26.760]
And Howard Beel.

[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:32.440]
And Paul, the screaming queen Paul, and his buddy Dick.

[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.960]
They're Paul and Dick, who are really tight in this flick.

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.660]
And it's good.

[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.120]
And you guys haven't even seen it.

[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.500]
I saw the beginning.

[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.280]
I am so embarrassed.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.420]
I can't get over it.

You'll have to have a spare.

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.660]
You'll have to be wearing your diapers or depends.

[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.620]
As the case may be.

[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.520]
And when you look at this.

[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:01.640]
This is the best.

[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.860]
This is far better than just the original Haerliss Mo Sans de T.

[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.700]
And it's appropriate for the family too.

[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.000]
And Neil and Mo...

[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.220]
Yeah.

[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.400]
The ass to ass was like a little bit R rated.

[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.520]
But this is perfect for the entire family of all ages, of all persuasions.

[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.260]
Mo Morphing into a Bozo.

[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.040]
And...

[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.160]
I was not a suggested cover for the SCD.

[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.780]
The one about my dancing on Mo's grave.

[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.920]
It was one of them right.

[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.660]
Oh, that's my favorite.

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.280]
Me too.

[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.080]
It's from the same guy.

[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.500]
Yeah.

[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:29.020]
No, it's hand-in-out.

[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:29.720]
It's from the same guy.

[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.200]
Thank you, sir, whoever you are.

[00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:31.820]
You're a genius.

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.220]
I love it.

[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.480]
Look at those phones this morning, man.

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.020]
Are these people worked up or what, huh?

[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.120]
What?

[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:39.460]
What?

[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.180]
It's Monday.

[00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:41.380]
It's Monday morning.

[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.800]
And plus these people, I mean, it's not the kind of a pool they're gonna be adding anything to.

[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.360]
So...

[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.320]
And I just mentioned that one movie there, which is a little bit nervous that we might be movie-intensive again.

[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.360]
Rules of attraction.

[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:52.740]
I don't see anybody else calling in who liked that movie.

[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.920]
Or maybe somebody hated it.

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:55.080]
I don't know what's not to like.

[00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:01.100]
I mean, the only thing that separated it from being ex-rated was the fact that all of the sex was like, you know, simulated.

[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:02.920]
A lot of bobbing of heads.

[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.460]
Up and down and back and forth and in and out and all of that stuff.

[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:07.800]
But it was... it's a panic.

[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:08.540]
It's a real hoot.

[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.860]
George will not like it because the ending like...

[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.340]
It like leaves you hanging there, you know?

[00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.700]
Like, what just happened, damn it.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:15.100]
What is it?

[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.580]
Well, let's watch it anyway.

[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:21.460]
See, I don't care what you say, because I watched the Requiem again last night for the 500th time.

[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:22.540]
Third time.

[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.500]
Yeah, I've seen it.

[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.100]
I had to get a fix, so to speak.

[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:29.920]
And that movie, that ends at a point where you don't know what will happen to her.

[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:31.660]
Yeah, you do.

[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.300]
You sure as hell have no idea what will happen to Harry?

[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:35.820]
Right?

[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]
He's the one-armed bandit now.

[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:38.660]
He's the one-armed bandito.

[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.040]
And what's her name?

[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.520]
She's busy doing as to as.

[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.800]
Jennifer Connelly.

[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.200]
She's going to be a heroin whore.

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.360]
I'm going to tell you something.

[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.480]
The two of them are such a perfect match.

[00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.540]
Maybe it's the makeup.

[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.560]
Maybe I don't know.

[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.100]
Maybe it was just brilliant casting.

[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:51.920]
That could have been it.

[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.120]
Yeah.

[00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:58.040]
But Jared Lido and Jennifer Connelly are like the perfect, well, I said a perfect couple, but

[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.840]
in a sense that they're both screwed up.

[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:00.680]
Right.

[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.380]
But they're a match.

[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.860]
In fact, late if you check late in the movie, next time you watch it, like in about an hour,

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.280]
she's lying there on the sofa.

[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.700]
I mean, just totally distraught.

[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.840]
And she looks like him.

[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.440]
Right.

[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.600]
If you look at her face, I mean, they're like interchangeable.

[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:15.740]
Interchangeable junkies.

[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:15.820]

[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.500]
Because they're in the same place.

[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.800]
I don't tell me we got to call.

[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.200]
It might be about that the rules of attraction from Davy.

[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:21.480]
Hello.

[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.140]
First call of the week.

[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:24.420]
Hello.

[00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:27.940]
From Davy.

[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:30.280]
Good call.

[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:30.780]
Good call.

[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:30.900]
Yeah.

[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.780]
Well, he was right.

[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.660]
Keep it coming.

[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.540]
Good so far.

[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:34.140]
Yes.

[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]
See, I knew he'd be there.

[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:36.140]
Yes.

[00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.380]
Yeah.

[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:38.540]
I'm from Davy.

[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.200]
Yeah.

[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.340]
I'm a redneck and I love the gay pride.

[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.260]
I love gay pride march.

[00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:45.180]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.880]
Reverend Jones sounds like he's in a guy named Burrell.

[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.040]
That's our call for this week.

[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.660]
I think we're going to like do a call for you a week or something.

[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.160]
Just when we thought we had tremendous momentum going,

[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.040]
we had the big mole.

[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:57.620]
Yeah.

[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.760]
Had a tremendous response and Pharrell on the pole, which was really amazing.

[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:01.540]
Up better than I am.

[00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:01.820]
Yeah.

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.900]
You see the kids, Sam Pedro on the channel four last night.

[00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.280]
I was doing that sports rap show with Jim and Jill and Pharrellah.

[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.560]
Anyway, he was wearing a Gypsy Hill pharmaceutical shirt.

[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.080]
I saw that.

[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.120]
He was representing great for the uh,

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.400]
favorite of college athletes.

[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.940]
He's busted off his uh, fix.

[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:26.000]
Maybe he was also an athlete that we're talking about.

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.080]
567-0560, pound five sixty on a 18 T W Q a and hello.

[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:32.820]
New.

[00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.120]
Speaking.

[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.920]
Uh, speaking.

[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:39.200]
That's not new.

[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.720]
Yeah, it's been the old.

[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.280]
Okay, new.

[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:42.940]
Yeah.

[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.100]
That's morning.

[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.360]
Um, how it was talking about um,

[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.100]
the all the derelict athlete.

[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:51.960]
Yeah.

[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.320]
And um, you were saying, um,

[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960]
what were they thinking?

[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.220]
Strawberry, beetroot,

[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:00.640]
they screwed up.

[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.600]
What were they thinking?

[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.240]
And somebody called him and said, um,

[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.840]
uh, how a David said, that's me.

[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.780]
He said, you come down the floor to mess with Neil Rogers.

[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.040]
What were you thinking?

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.780]
He turned it into crap.

[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.280]
He turned the crap.

[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.740]
He said a crap.

[00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.800]
Yeah, he turned the crap before he came here.

[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.000]
Okay, thanks for the good call, Pat.

[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.000]
That's two for two.

[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:24.300]
Oh, keep him coming, baby.

[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.720]
If we can go all week long, we'll cause that good.

[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.120]
We'll be in uh, hog heaven, you know.

[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.300]
Rules of attraction.

[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.920]
Ye or nay, friend or foe, paper or plastic.

[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:35.780]
Huh?

[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.060]
Oh, it's going to be a brutal week, you can tell that.

[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:40.500]
Well, we've been pushing it a little bit, you know.

[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.960]
We've been uh, should be counting our lucky stars.

[00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:46.880]
Responsing at website has been you for it to spectacular.

[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.720]
They're busy waiting to see that picture on yours.

[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:49.820]
What they want to see, boner boy?

[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.840]
They want to see the morphing mo, as mo, morphing the bozo.

[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.600]
It's a, it's a phenomenal thing.

[00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:56.060]
Mozo.

[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.480]
A mozo.

[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:58.120]
I like it.

[00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.340]
You're in the mo zone.

[00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:06.440]
In fact, if you, if that hair piece keeps flat around,

[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.220]
it's going to eliminate the mo zone layer.

[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.360]
It's going to like, huh?

[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:12.320]
Yeah.

[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.920]
Speaking of the mo zone layer, did I, I don't think we put it on the website.

[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.340]
The thing about the cows farting.

[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.100]
Did we boner boy?

[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:19.720]
He's on the phone.

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.340]
Getting the cows to cool it.

[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:22.900]
He's on the phone with home, probably with Eric.

[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.520]
Uh, very important collar, I'm sure.

[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.420]
Yeah, of course.

[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:27.360]
What are the kinds of other?

[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.060]
Oh, you mean one of our callers, but forget about that.

[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.200]
Orlando judge, we had this on over the weekend.

[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.280]
Just a little follow up.

[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.100]
Orlando judge rules.

[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.660]
Mozo, the moment can't be where veil and driver's license photo.

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.520]
Are you aware of the fact that even in their home countries, they can't, they can't do that.

[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.000]
Right.

[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.600]
And she's a lot of lately.

[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:47.760]
She's one of these drama queens that decided to be a Muslim and did and do this thing.

[00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.100]
Yeah.

[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:48.760]
But guess what?

[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:54.340]
Back in Saudi Arabia, or any of those calm, almost any of the Arab countries, the Muslim countries, they can't do that.

[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:58.020]
You can't take a photo ID with, right?

[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.680]
With a, with a zero mask on or with a veil or any other bull crap, okay?

[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.960]
With a Batman mask and Saudi Arabia, they don't have that problem because the woman can't drive periods.

[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:06.920]
So, yeah.

[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.040]
Yeah, that's probably the best idea.

[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:10.240]
Just keep her ass off the roads.

[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.720]
What I said, yeah, I can just say no F in way, okay?

[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.140]
Silly bitch.

[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:14.820]
That's the issue.

[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:15.560]
I mean, that's a privilege.

[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:16.360]
It's not a right.

[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.660]
Yeah, you want to drive.

[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.660]
You want to know.

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.940]
Vienerborg got a new car.

[00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:21.700]
It's got no AC.

[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:22.940]
Let's hear it.

[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.100]
At least he's consistent.

[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:28.540]
Maybe he can afford the AC if clearance ever comes, I'll put it out for him.

[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.320]
Do you want clearance?

[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.720]

That's what I heard him say.

[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.700]
Did you hear him say that?

[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:36.240]
A bit of it.

[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:37.500]
He said it's minimum.

[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.920]
He said it's going to be momentous today that takes place.

[00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.360]

[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.780]
But what's going to happen to Mozone is what I want to know.

[00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:48.660]
Maybe the Mozone will be like 545 or 6, kind of like a 15 minute warm-up show.

[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:54.000]
1027 at 560 WQM if your carpets look like they've been in the dead zone.

[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.080]
If they look really bad, they smell bad, they're nasty, ready to toss them out

[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:58.720]
and spend a lot of money for new carpeting.

[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.420]

[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.600]
Just call my buddies a dry concept.

[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.440]
I've used them in my house for over 20 years, almost a lifetime for some of you.

[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.560]
And boy, the reason I keep using them is because every time they show up on time,

[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.160]
they give you a written guaranteed price before they start the job,

[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.340]
they make your carpets look and smell and feel just like brand new,

[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.460]
because they dry clean them, which sucks out even the deep down dirt,

[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:20.240]
way down in there in the fibers of your carpets.

[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.480]
And like I said, makes them look and smell and feel just like you had brand new laid right on your floor.

[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.660]
And they also do a stupidity job of cleaning your drapes, your expensive area rugs,

[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.340]
or rental rugs, your leather furniture and a poultry too.

[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:33.120]

Let me tell you right off the bat George is into I mean you said a lot of your choices are very good

[00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.400]
But you're into this western kind of crap. I'm not saying that's one of them. I don't know what it's all about

[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.860]
But you're I'm like into these westerns when it doubt keep me out of that like the Brad Pitt one that you had me watching

[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:57.940]
It was it was okay

[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:03.160]
But it's a western legends of the fall. I just thought I made that other thing

[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:09.040]
No, no, no, I say

[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:14.420]
Just because of where it takes place doesn't make it a western it could be taking place in Hollywood

[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.120]
It does make it a western one western on that list and what was that I haven't watched that yet

[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:24.060]
Outlaw Josie whales that's really western. No, no, that's not the one. I got it the other way. I'll get it

[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.820]
And then you'll know what I'm talking about it fact just hum off you bars

[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:38.060]
I say it's one of the ones on my list what outlaw Josie whales. No snatch snatch. I put that down

[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.460]
Not for the list. I

[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.360]
wrote it down the list that you refused to put on there the updated one

[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.720]
The way is a good it's

[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:47.900]
That's my

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.740]
Ryan Philippe and Benicio Velforo right in James Conway the gun. Oh, you know who was really great in

[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:59.260]
Very funny even though it was a very short the cameo in rules of attraction was faith done away

[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.760]
When she spits her drink back into the glass it's it was good

[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.100]
So you were about to apologize for choosing me what being a western buff

[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:11.640]
You're beginning these westerns. I am I don't know aren't you?

Punx in the sack. Oh, no, it's a couple in the sack with little kid. Well, I don't want to get into that

[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.980]

[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:35.260]
Somebody recommended that never heard of it

Looks pretty interesting and of course beautiful mine which Bina Boy recommended can't get the title right I endorsed it

[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.840]
In my own private Idaho with the River penis which I got the video tape because it's I've been told for years

[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.880]
I should see that it's one as kind of a fag movie and

[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.340]
It's got River penis in it

[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:57.960]
Well, I know too. Yes, nothing you're gonna watch it anyway, but snatch is about as far from a western as you can get

[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:04.160]
Oh, there's guns in it, but England well the way you said that like gun that white and it doesn't got father have like a lot of

[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.080]
That's not worth the thought of stuff matter of fact exactly exactly

[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.280]
Where you should clarify them what you're talking about get it get it straight

Here's a call from sunrise. Hello. Hey, don't know. Okay, sir. Yeah true romance

I know it's on the list was like the pulp fiction before pulp fiction isn't that kind of a movie if you like pulp fiction

[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.100]
You like that pulp fiction then you won't like true romance well

[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:30.860]
I don't know that the guy that had Paul fiction did rules of attraction and it was great. Oh, okay

[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.640]
Okay, hey did you see the Hillary thing last night? No, I did not yeah

[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:40.260]
She made a mention there that religion got her through the Monica scandal after she was oh jeez

[00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:46.160]
But then she also threw in that and that's a good thing religion to pass along to your children

[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.980]
As if it came out of the blue like you know, she's running for something

[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.720]
You know don't forget those conservatives religions good for your family

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.020]
How I sat there and I was like you know

[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:02.960]
What does that have to do with it getting it through you anything? Yeah, yeah, no that she kind of passed it along to us

[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:08.560]
And she only took one shot at George Bush saying that well, hey, we could you know bill and her she and bill

[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.440]
Created 23 million jobs right and you know Bush obviously and don't forget about her great health care plan too

Oh, that was fantastic. I'm still waiting for mine right thanks. Okay, palie

I missed that the book is out today. They were lined up at the bookstores in Midnight around to the country last night in various places

[00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.840]

[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.900]
Did you go and get yours?

[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:36.060]
Not my book and the bad news is that boner boy who promised us that on Friday

[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:41.480]
He was gonna watch Magnolia over the weekend with excuse being the car problems and he's got a rough life

[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.480]
And it was raining near the overpass and all of a sudden the captain watch it yet

[00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.360]
My bad now I went on IMDB which stands for what?

[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.280]
I am a douchebag. Now what does that stand for internet movie database?

[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.840]

We get that price and gas down low

[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.820]

What the hell was that oh my god I think we're gone

[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.700]
Well seriously what the hell just happened there that must have been a bokeh Brian thing you know

[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:49.460]
That thing just died in the stream holy crap

[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:53.720]
It's a good thing I was paying like marginal attention here you know what quick recovery

[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.060]
Jesus K Christ man it's a he's got go it all on the

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:02.900]
That's an old man now the line don't drop off that would be a problem on this

[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:07.420]
And there are no problems on this and I mean a plus doesn't have to be on that I'd for it to drop out

[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:07.660]
Oh

[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:12.860]
Anyway, I'm looking at this list and I don't want to do the movie thing again because the audience is going to film at the

[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.880]
month that they got no material

[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.480]
But like I told you before the show the top 250 movies how about the top 25,000 you know

[00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:26.440]
I mean what what separates and I do understand that they do this based on a number system based on the

[00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:29.920]
They're subscribers readers or whatever you call viewers

[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:38.340]
But I mean what separates number 66 from number 67 what separates number 158 from number 159 if I'm

[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.200]
Saying that's like saying what are the 600 best orgasms you ever had in your life stop and think about it you know

[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:49.160]
Okay, I'll be right back. Okay. What are they what are they 400 best meals you ever had in your life

[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.740]
I mean I can understand what are the top 10 the top 20 once you get beyond that it's

[00:38:54.740 --> 00:39:03.660]
It's pointless isn't it right? Well, maybe people want you know to go see they've already seen the top 20 they want to know what to go see next yeah

[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:07.380]
I don't know how many of the

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:12.740]
It's a sexuality and especially when I look at the list and I see exorcist is 168

[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:20.740]
Brazil, which you tell me whatever you do don't go and get it is 161 the exorcist 168

[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.060]
Abel con Ella a

[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.860]
Yeah, 138 but the exorcist 168

[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540]
I've never heard of that

[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:34.200]
War who can long 56

[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:39.480]
Because all these foreign films and here all these films that I couldn't even pronounce the names of

[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:44.620]
San Tucci hero no kakushu shikushi for number 46 you can't say kuchi on the

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:50.660]
San Tucci hero no kamikakushi and I got to write that time it's number five that's the 46 best movie

[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:54.880]
ever made you see it what kuchi yeah

[00:39:54.880 --> 00:40:00.520]
Yeah, but not that movie teen and then now that guy's going to call back and ask if I saw snatch again

[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.480]
Number 19 fablo distinta amelie poulon le poulon

[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.380]
Poulon what's up to the about chicken?

[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.680]
It's number nine that's the 19th best movie of all time with 32,000 votes on this

[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:18.000]
I whatever this database thing is what does it stand for again?

[00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:25.300]
I'm a dishback I'm a do spag database so I don't know I mean you can argue about it forever which is a you know kind of fun

[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:30.480]
Poul show carry and Dean leading in new Hampshire well I'll tell you Bobby Graham has got a

[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.060]
Chinaman's chance in hell you know I'm surprised partly

[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.880]
Because in Iowa pool if they took that we had on Friday he had one percent least he's consistent

[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:44.300]
Of course you know in New Hampshire is in New England so naturally the New England people are going to do well

[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:49.300]
John carry 25% Howard Dean 22% is a poll released yesterday

[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:58.860]
Polo 600 likely voters taking June 4th through 7th about a third of those surveys said they're not familiar with Dean while one intent said that about

[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.920]
Carry so Howard Dean's got some work to do but he's got plenty of time and more people need to find out who he is senator

[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:09.640]
Julie Berman of Connecticut which is also right next door with only 10% dick and heart of Missouri 7%

[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:17.080]
Wait till you're these other numbers senator John Edwards of North Carolina who's is boring is a condensed milk and representative Dennis

[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:24.500]
Consonant of Ohio where 2% senator Bob Graham senator Carol Mosley Braun former of Illinois and Al Sharpton New York all at 1%

[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:32.300]
1% for Bobby Graham in Iowa and in New Hampshire of course he's not known well there I guess but 1% ain't going to cut it

[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:36.960]
I don't think he's going to get there so let's let's brood for Howard Dean what are you saying

[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:49.100]
I'm rooting for him I'm rooting 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line who do you trust the most that's our poll question today

[00:41:49.680 --> 00:42:00.400]
We got 124 votes myself 32 and of course if you're a drug addict I guess you don't trust yourself right I guess I guess I think I'm the only non drug

[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:06.480]
Well that's not right because I'm a sugar addict do you think that there's anybody anywhere who's not addicted to something

[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.620]
No good question we did that a few weeks ago about what's your thing and then we found out that we got a whole bunch of heroin addicts in the audience remember that

[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:22.400]
Which explains most of our calls but that that was shocking to me weren't you a little bit taken a back if it's to be believed

[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:32.260]
Hmm kind of like set me a back a years because I am the surrogol farm of sugar every fine sugar I mean I am addicted so bad you have no idea

[00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.380]
We have some idea

[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:44.660]
All right do you yeah how many pounds worth 32% trust themselves the most I trust nobody 27 my parents 23 my spouse 21

[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:57.480]
Neal Roger 16 we got 16 people really looking at big time my best friend or friends for Mo Howard David at one I didn't know Mo had a computer in his car

[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:11.980]
He must be doing it on his laptop and the vote to George W Bush none and my priest rabbi or minister zero oh that said in it nobody trust the men of the cloth anymore not this ground

[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:25.080]

[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:45.800]
It morphs in full color cow that's a that's like even better than God and what you call Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

[00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:49.280]
Here's a call from for the order deal hello

[00:43:49.280 --> 00:44:10.300]
Hello sir good morning you got me on the craft list with my girlfriend I wait and got packed all you yeah we walked that movie and I told you man I'm an hot I was confused and she was totally confused I don't know what's that what were you confused about

[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:37.480]
So you said it was like the best thing you've ever seen it was to me to me that's my favorite movie of all time I grabbed stand by that which part which part I mean like how just the thought of it or thinking back I don't know what part I was supposed to fall in love with I mean I you know that's the thing my girlfriend just looked at me like I was out of my mind you know so I mean out of your mind because you made her watches yeah

[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:54.820]
yeah I mean she stayed up the whole time though so it must have been interesting to her but yeah it was a very confusing movie I guess what I just don't know what I was looking for I guess what caught your attention so much

[00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:06.500]
What caught my attention yeah I mean all of it every part of it each one of the nine characters in it the whole lot of different story lines that all had like a similar similarities to it

[00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:35.340]
okay so the moral of the story was the moral the moral of the story is crap happens that's the moral of the story strange crap happens it they tended that right in the beginning and then the narrator comes on again just before the end and tells you the same crap again that's what I tried to explain there I thought it was it was okay but confusing as to what I was actually looking for until it was over about crap happens but I yeah the whole time I was thinking all of these people are going to die together and you know as a coincidence

[00:45:35.340 --> 00:46:03.000]
they were going to all just be at the same place and die together or something is what I thought was going to happen in that movie and that's not what happens so I just want to let you know that I I just watched the whole thing and it was it was okay but it was better today now that I was thinking about it yeah well you know I think if you watch it a second time you'll appreciate it better probably next time I have fifth next time you have 15 or 20 spur hours watching okay yeah yeah

[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:32.980]
five five five how about funny side disappointed in the bell button on Saturday I guess we all know that was going to happen I didn't want to admit it what saw that on the news did you see I thought maybe you watched the race see nobody wants to admit that he went too fast the first quarter plus that blazing workout 57 and 4 that I had something to do with me he went too fast it's in a sloppy goes 23 and 4 in a mile and a half race and let me just tell you right now even always slow the pace down any horse I don't care how good they are 99% of the time they go too fast the first quarter

[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:40.540]
especially in a race into my life they're going to put their guts out and that's what happened to him you have to like the mud in this and a very depressing all of

[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:22.880]
six both teams are stuck and sticking goals in there like it's going out of style I think the ducks

[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:27.620]
are going to win tonight two to one and over time I think the ducks will win because Jersey's going to

[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:32.380]
play the only way Jersey can win I think is to go into their suffocating coma style you know that

[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:37.440]
they're so famous for and I think it's going to wind up overtime to the one Robbie Neeter Meyer gets

[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:44.500]
a winning goal of ran a highman overtime five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18

[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:55.540]
sunny and 70 here today I should point out I just mentioned that in passing who do you trust the

[00:49:55.540 --> 00:50:03.700]
most we asked on our poll 197 votes myself 54 I trust nobody 38 my spouse 34 my parents one or

[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:11.900]

[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.900]
them nobody saw rules of attraction I don't want to get too movie intensive again but is that a shame

[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.400]
yeah see I'm thinking of myself during this last break like I've got to just call about

[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.940]
Magnolia if I tell you it's a good movie don't go see it don't rent it don't buy it because my taste

[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:36.000]
is just not like the average pedestrian taste out there just like you hated Magnolia I thought

[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.760]
it was the best movie ever saw you didn't like it it was okay it was good so you're like you're like

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:46.460]
this other guy you sit down and you you start watching and and you've already got a preconceived

[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:52.340]
notion of what it is that you want no not like that other guy see I put the disc in the DVD player

[00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:58.240]
I hit play yeah I sit there and whatever unfolds in front of me I take it in and I try to

[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:02.720]
appreciate it for whatever it is if it sucks us and this really sucks it's not for me you know right

[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:06.580]
and if it's weak if it's not as good as it's supposed to be like Magnolia then I say that too now

[00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:10.540]
like rules of attraction I didn't know what to expect because this geek James Vanderbueck I don't

[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:14.700]
like him in the first place I just there is something about him that bugs me but it turned out to be

[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.680]
a really cute and a really funny and a really interesting and a really bizarre movie was strange but it

[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:25.960]
was fun and I loved it I have no complaints about it now you'll go out and you'll get it maybe

[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:29.900]
or you'll watch it on cable and you'll say well it was it was a lot of fun but that ending was

[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.740]
just unacceptable to me because like what happens now I don't know maybe there'll be a sequel who

[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.260]
to hell knows what I saw if it was good so I wanted to see more but something came up I had to

[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.440]
take off and I haven't caught it again well I'm telling you right now mark mark it down

[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:48.060]
being a boy that when he sees it he'll say he liked it a lot but but what the hell about that crappy

[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:54.340]
ending I might I need a good ending let me ask you this how many movies have an acceptable ending

[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:59.720]
a lot of you stop to think about all the ones on my list they do example yeah

[00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.620]
I don't I don't recommend it to be in like how about when you're a Glen Ross which I love

[00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:08.760]
riveting ending what are you talking about what a textbook example of how a movie should end

[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:16.480]
where you just need a towel afterwards where he walks in the office and he doesn't say who I didn't

[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:21.420]
say who he hasn't seen it yet but just that whole that whole last scene I needed like a glass of

[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:31.700]
water a towel and a cold compress unacceptable here's Tamarack hello Tamarack

[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:40.340]
okay nice talking to Tamarack probably expired 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 8D at D line

[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:48.220]
here's Miami hello oh god here's what they uh talk over the phone here's Miami hello

[00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:54.980]
hey god I love you Tony how you doing okay listen I want to say thanks to Peter boy he's

[00:52:54.980 --> 00:53:00.160]
doing a great job on the on your web page you're sure I was browsing through it and I saw

[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:08.160]
there was a program on C-SPAN with Al Franken and um and a writing right and it was just

[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.660]
incredible because Al Franken put him on the spot with a couple of lies that are writing I

[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:18.460]
said about winning a couple of B-bodies on was it in said edition that he was on before

[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.380]
but I don't know the show that he was before and he put him on the spot and he was so funny to see

[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:30.280]
already so uncomfortable and he wanted that he looked to me like he wanted to jump and

[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:37.740]
and kick this guy's hands running for everybody that was great and uh also I love momentum it's

[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:44.000]
a great great movie and I and that's it that's all I got my friend okay amigo see

[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.240]
all right he said you're doing a great job boner boy thanks for putting up those stories that I

[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:53.680]
keep feeding you I mean what nothing fine at least that is when you get home from your car

[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:57.360]
problems he had a little problem Saturday so the stories didn't get under what about 2 30 in

[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.860]
a morning just about something like that but then we made up for yesterday because uh we also

[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:05.440]
had a link to all the stuff you missed on Saturday just to keep you off the streets and we had a

[00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:09.180]
really sensational response which we're not going to get today because it never had it never

[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:14.080]
continues in software that's one thing I've learned is that just like the thing in those movie shows

[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:18.440]
they get real whipped up for a day or two maybe even a few days and then it's like pulling the

[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:28.340]
air out of a guy then balloon here's Miami hello Miami hello yes sir hey oh I just want to tell

[00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:34.840]
you something about that smash movie yeah it was so funny we were 30 minutes into it it's all

[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.780]
like this pot me slang there are a bunch of uh jipsies and we couldn't understand the word of it

[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:46.820]
we had to go back and put on subtitles and became a joke to see what they said we would always make

[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:51.060]
like a bet on what they we thought they said and then we're back to see what they actually said

[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:56.960]
like putting the uh like the closed captions for the hearing impaired it was hilarious I'll be

[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.820]
damn well I'm glad you enjoyed it thanks I'm not going to watch it uh speaking of Jennifer

[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:04.800]
Conley remember that old koot that was saying that was sucking up to George about all what I

[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:08.300]
once seen where she standing naked in front of the mirror and you see that he was packed up I thought

[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:15.320]
it was taking a shot look what that old koot no he was not he was trying to say well my good

[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:18.840]
heterosexual friend George he would have really loved that as opposed to you mr. Fag you would

[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.720]
like you know what he would have been saying that was the best scene that I ever know no no that

[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:26.540]
was now what he was saying he was just desperate but but I watched that again with a little more

[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:31.520]
interest last night when I watched the movie again and she if you you don't want to see it because

[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:36.060]
if you look at her from the naval down and and that's she she did lost a lot of weight by that time

[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:41.520]
ooh yeah man she looks nasty in fact from the you want to like just chop her off from the

[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.760]
a naval take the rest of her from naval up her and Jared they made them both get really

[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:49.580]
macyated and erection they were going to carry carpet or die for weeks before they made that

[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.560]
movie because the one scene where he takes the shirt off and he goes to get her glass of water when

[00:55:53.560 --> 00:56:00.020]
she's like losing it right and he he he was about 80 pounds soaking wet there no she wasn't

[00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:09.040]

care about serena about Venus about penis we don't care about tennis on the show and we have a

[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:56.300]
really good article on the website one of them over the weekend about the a French and about

[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.000]
that whole silly childish thing which the rest of the world and the French people themselves look

[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:06.020]
at as being very embarrassingly juvenile which it was so you enjoy your freedom toast pal and maybe

[00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:10.520]
your girlfriend to give you a freedom kiss if you're real lucky but I doubt it don't you think

[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:08.220]
I don't understand it I turn on mode this morning he's belly-ick and about marlins this in the

[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:11.720]

[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:15.780]
big crowd they had twenty three thousand in one game and they had like I don't know they have

[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:20.800]
a couple of crowds because they gave some crap away and I don't understand that I don't get it

[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:24.940]
if you're not interested in something and they're giving something away that's a minimal value

[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:30.180]
really when you come right down to it what's why would that give you see what I'm saying what are

[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:34.120]
they giving away they were given away some kind of bubblehead dollar one of the games then there

[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.120]
were some other piece of crap they gave away why would you go to that if you have no interest

[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:42.840]
anyway it would be like you going right yeah George is going to the Marlin game tomorrow because

[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:49.340]

[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:37.180]
yeah and how long is that gonna take I hopefully that's too long it'll be up today

[01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:40.660]
that's right the reasons that we're not getting a lot of response on the phone is that people

[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:45.720]
are sitting right in their seat there for their monitors they're too well huh they can see it

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:51.220]

he may have launched his mojo but he sure as hell got his mozo that that that is it's too big

[01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:43.100]
you're wrong the fact that it's so big that's one of the most beautiful pieces of art in the history

[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:48.420]
of the internet if I do say so myself hey clearance you better start taking care of

[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.400]
the owner boy there okay he's doing one hell of a job on his website because prior to him arrive at

little militant about that he hates you he said at one more time that he recommended I understand that's

[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:54.380]
why let's say thank you and that's it okay he's very emphatic he wants me to see him and you're

[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.840]
just trying to cut him off because you don't like that I didn't cut him off I'm nowhere near the

[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:04.580]
button and I like to barfly for what now what is this from John it is bold face lie or bald face lie

[01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:08.640]
this is the guy that always wants me to uh put his PSA's on the air this guy I think isn't this

[01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:14.920]
the guy I don't know in typing bold face refers to making a strong point bald face doesn't

[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.860]
make any sense also what does that mean what does this man talking about I think the drugs did come

[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:27.940]
in you know what I missed out damn it also two movies of interest the man who wasn't there with

[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:35.920]
Billy Bob Thornton and ghost world would Steve Wushimi enjoy not bad ghost world yeah it's I

[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.380]
mean there's nothing big about it but it's a decent movie it's not big yeah nothing like the other

[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:45.880]
ones that we've talked about but it's okay I don't have time for like you know I mean how many can

[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:49.620]
you watch how many of you are gonna go out and buy I mean as well just go buy up the whole guy they

[01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:53.980]
make him be stored what's the point start a little side business and a lot of them that I'm looking

[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:57.940]
for they're out of stock like train spotting I haven't seen that I can't find it they're out of it

[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.840]
and then some of the other ones people are calling and I go in there and I go to what sams and I

[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:07.440]
looking there's a look like no such thing they never had it in addition to which there are a lot of

[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:13.940]
movies that people are all whipped up to a frenzy about that aren't on DVD yet got it right just

[01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:18.600]
because you saw a movie on cable or somewhere maybe in the theater or maybe on a video tape doesn't

mean that it's on DVD yet they're not all on DVD yet Virginia hit the break news to you but they're

[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.380]
again being mr. negative I think the audience has got a point about you I'm trying to

[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.620]
the point a point here especially on the day that we've got maybe the greatest picture in the

[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:09.700]
history of the internet you're missing the point I bet you that Al Gore who invented the internet

[01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:14.700]
would even probably set a telegram and say being her boy great job I bet he would do that if he

[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:20.040]
knew about it that's how damn good that is that Mozo the clown thing that it's phenomenal you got

[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:24.900]
Mo without the teeth of what out the hairpiece who morphs into Mozo the clown it's a phenomenal thing

[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:30.780]
I bet you even Mo is taking a peek at it no certainly I bet you there's a part of him somewhere

[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:34.940]
in that warped skull of his that is actually chartling a little bit not like laugh it out loud

[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:42.140]
but like like that you know just like that no yeah there is a part of him for you are a hard

[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:46.860]
ass man no wonder in the summertime the audience wants to kill himself I hope this summer you're

[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:50.820]

[01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:47.440]
you know and it's kind of like a self-fulfilling prophecy you know what I'd be saying no what I'm

[01:27:39.530 --> 01:27:42.350]
which we already had on our website but there is something really interesting about it

[01:27:43.170 --> 01:27:47.610]
new handshirt Episcopalian selected an openly gay man as the next bishop Saturday which we had

[01:27:47.610 --> 01:27:52.470]
on a website over the weekend but a historic vote in a church deeply divided on the issue of

[01:27:52.470 --> 01:27:57.890]
homosexuality the selection of Reverend be gene Robinson 56 it was chosen over three other candidates

[01:27:57.890 --> 01:28:02.730]
in voting by new handshirt clergy and lay Episcopalians if we can say that it's still subject

[01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:07.090]
confirmation next month by the church's national general convention the confirmation is likely to be

[01:28:07.090 --> 01:28:11.650]
a heated battle with international implications Robinson drop position from any in the angrily

[01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:17.030]
community worldwide and here's the interesting part because i knew there would be one the reverend David

[01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:22.710]
Jones rector of st. Paul said he was thrilled with Robinson selection even though he recognizes

[01:28:22.710 --> 01:28:28.490]
that the bible speaks against homosexuality he said your gay the spirit works through that man so

[01:28:28.490 --> 01:28:33.410]
who am I to say god's not supposed to do that Reverend Jones said how did that then make that up

[01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:39.710]
Reverend Jones who's not one of your favorite people i take it your gay just because he calls 40

[01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:44.450]

[01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:38.150]
minibee chill oh hey i'm gonna have a y'all yes sir okay uh yeah i saw a movie attraction and i

[01:29:38.150 --> 01:29:42.570]
thought it was okay it wasn't great but it was good although um the first the opening scene

[01:29:42.570 --> 01:29:46.510]
in the beginning where the chick uh that you were just talking about is like saving yourself

[01:29:46.510 --> 01:29:52.250]
you know for the certain guy this party right and uh he ends up going to bed with another chick so

[01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:56.830]
she ends up settling for this other guy she was talking to the film student guy remember the scene

[01:29:57.290 --> 01:30:01.850]
yeah okay and he's uh she and she's so wait did she pass it down when she wakes up he's filming her

[01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:05.170]
and some other guy right and she's and saw the guy is doing her right and she's like almost

[01:30:05.170 --> 01:30:08.190]
coming from that's my virginity to some loser and then he throws up on her

[01:30:08.190 --> 01:30:13.150]
mm-hmm that was pretty good uh she deserved it i think basically when you get to

[01:30:13.150 --> 01:30:16.370]
the movie and see what a loser she turned out to be she doesn't even know she was cute she

[01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:20.650]
deserved i agree that was that was pretty funny though and um you did see that one brief scene

[01:30:20.650 --> 01:30:25.330]
of male nudity right when pictures going through europe yeah okay well anyways i thought you

[01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:31.010]
might enjoy that um another thing about um so a reason possibly people aren't as uh

[01:30:31.010 --> 01:30:36.510]
psyched out about um requiem as uh you are and most people for smart people anyway

[01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:42.850]
as great a movie as it was it didn't have a very you know pleasant ending you know what i mean

[01:30:44.010 --> 01:30:48.250]
well i mean well i don't think that godfather had a pleasant ending either did

[01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:52.630]
it didn't any of them any of the three godfathers believe it or not Neil don't hate me but i've never

[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:56.830]
seen the godfather i don't think network had a pleasant ending unless you didn't like Howard

[01:30:56.830 --> 01:31:01.590]
i mean there are a lot of great movies that don't have a pleasant ending because uh you know i mean

[01:31:01.590 --> 01:31:06.230]
snow white you know if you want to see fairy tales stuff like that those have pleasant endings but

[01:31:06.230 --> 01:31:10.290]
uh real life doesn't always have a pleasant ending yeah but you know what it's like i don't know

[01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:14.350]
for especially for people that didn't some way can relate to any of the characters in requiem

[01:31:14.350 --> 01:31:19.790]
like uh you know whether it's diet pills or drugs whatever at the end of the movie you're left

[01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:25.810]
feeling like oh my god that's you know screwed up you know as great the as the movie was it's like

[01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:30.190]
well i mean but it's but it's just a movie it's not like you're watching it because you're waiting

[01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:34.430]
for a commentary on your own life in fact that that's part of it because we all have the our own

[01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:38.230]
things that were hooked on and you can you can relate to it no i agree but that's all right well

[01:31:38.230 --> 01:31:42.270]
gee at least we still got both arms i think and at least uh you know we're not in some kind of an

[01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:49.050]

[01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:10.410]
one to two our why can't we play the new and the one stuff oh i know exactly in fact i'm looking

[01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:23.010]
with any god damn our all find it that bitch so which of our legacy movie do you like better scared

[01:34:23.010 --> 01:34:30.110]
to death or the devil bat no the reason the reason i'm asking that is because i bought this uh way

[01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:34.750]
back when in the beginning when you started talking to me and to buy all these DVDs right i bought

[01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:41.030]
this velagosi collection volume one because the Dracula's not on DVD yet okay and even if it were

[01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:44.770]
while we're with the quality of the right uh they digitally remaster who the hell knows

[01:34:45.570 --> 01:34:49.170]
plus they can put all kinds of extra extraneous stuff on but anyway it's not available so

[01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:54.770]
here here are two movies that i never heard of scared death in the devil bat with velagosi

[01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:59.070]
who is one of my favorite people now you have that up there with you i take it i have it in my hand

[01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:06.830]
why why i want to borrow you but obviously not scared to death on DVD for the first time

[01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:12.730]
mastered from a restored original 35 millimeter theatrical color print they're doing some wonderful

[01:35:12.730 --> 01:35:16.710]
things with that as a matter of fact what they did with metropolis is phenomenal original release

[01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:22.530]
1946 with velagosi George Zuko Nat Pendleton Molly Lamont and Dave Lamont and Lamont Cranston

[01:35:22.530 --> 01:35:28.810]
the shadow and then the devil bat 1940 i don't know it's one of those you have to be just in the

[01:35:28.810 --> 01:35:34.130]
right mood i guess to pop in there i love that stuff do you um you're like rules of attraction believe

[01:35:34.130 --> 01:35:38.270]
me it's your kind of oh you won't like the ending see this is what gets me now that although the guy

[01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:42.430]
wasn't saying he felt that way but some people won't like the ending of the happy ending that's not

[01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:47.830]
the same as uh just a decent good ending yeah well uh rules of attraction doesn't have any ending

[01:35:47.830 --> 01:35:53.130]
i okay it ends you know that one bit i was playing the boka brine bit how it ended no no that

[01:35:53.130 --> 01:35:57.450]
that's how the movie ends i'll brace myself like he's in the middle of a sentence well i mean it doesn't

[01:35:57.450 --> 01:36:00.070]
make any difference with our ten year not because you won't know when it's going to happen right

[01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:03.730]
but like he's at back and then that's it and then you go to the closing credits and you say what

[01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:08.970]
what all right here's the factors i loved all the movies you've talked about see i'm enjoying the

[01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:13.150]
movie thing because it's opening up to me uh and maybe it's a selfish thing and then the people

[01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:18.010]
out there who hate movies or just a bunch of sour pushes oh gee this is getting so epic and

[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:22.350]
pottery i don't give a crap under its potterous or not i've heard your material today what it is

[01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:26.290]
the usual chambam yeah i've heard what have they got what do they want yeah it was George

[01:36:26.290 --> 01:36:32.230]

wonder why america's in the shape that it's in and we got a moron from present you wonder

[01:36:37.810 --> 01:36:43.170]
god see one of the problems we have with this show for the last 70 or 80 years is that we've got

[01:36:43.170 --> 01:36:48.150]
a lot of amateur comedians out there who think because the show is amusing at times and sometimes

[01:36:48.150 --> 01:36:54.750]
very amusing that they're amusing guess what you made your first mistake okay you're not amusing

[01:36:55.390 --> 01:37:00.430]
you're not funny you're not hysterical you're not a panic you're not uh you know if you if you

[01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:06.270]
were you have your own show but most of you are not that guy with his uh his uh i think that was

[01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:11.570]
Reverend Jones doing his own voice the head of me i mean who else could be possibly so stupid i

[01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:16.270]
mean i'm even given him like a little publicity with that uh psca page and story there he still can't

[01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:21.690]
control himself put on your baseball caps stuff it in your ass go to pomp it or park even though

[01:37:21.690 --> 01:37:25.450]
there's no live racing now until the fall and see if thick fineberg will talk to which i doubt

[01:37:25.450 --> 01:37:29.330]

[01:37:30.930 --> 01:37:35.670]

[01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:24.750]

[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:33.580]
Mad Dog 2-4, the Humper Hank is back from the Belmont 2-4 or 4-7, whatever it is at

[02:00:39.100 --> 02:00:43.800]
Sure what? Lots of calls about that Belmont, not, and that's good because people

[02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:47.740]
are called about horse racing, harness racing, throwback racing, all of us over the

[02:00:47.740 --> 02:00:53.120]
age of 100. Nobody wants to hear that. Old conkers at the track. 5-6-7, 0-5-60,

[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:56.640]
0-5-60 on the AT&T and for Rise and Ruralist Line.

[02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:01.240]
Were you disappointed, funny side didn't win? Oh yeah, crushed. You were disappointed.

[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.980]
It would have been fun to have a hero to have something, huh? To have a little

[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:13.760]
something good, even if it's a horse. What's not my horse? Well, who gives a crap, okay?

[02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.300]
So you're not going to make all of that money that he would have made, plus it isn't

[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:21.320]
any of balls anyway. Here's Point and B, chill out. I was there that he lost.

[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:25.400]
How big your pardon? I was there, honey. Funny side, funny side, boy.

[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:28.940]
Funny side, yeah. Do you think that horse had a chance of the...

[02:01:28.940 --> 02:01:31.720]
We're right. Did I hear you this morning, honey? You were the first caller on

[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.500]
the e-ferelshow this morning. Chronic, chronic, oh, that voice, that sound, that voice,

[02:01:37.740 --> 02:01:42.220]
I can't take it. Not exactly a real prosperous day on a phone today, not a

[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:46.880]
overwhelming response, but I still say, I don't care what anybody says there.

[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:52.440]
Those voices, those chronic, they just kill me. Don't you know that voice? Yeah.

[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:59.400]
Dole, that dull sound, that dull thud in your ears, you're saying, oh no, not again,

[02:02:00.080 --> 02:02:04.360]
not that voice again. See what I'm talking about, old cockers at the track.

[02:02:06.020 --> 02:02:09.080]
It'll take for a little while, you know, another week or so, and helping out all these

[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:12.300]
chronic's. He won't put them on. And you want to know why he doesn't need them.

[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:19.740]
Shodys, pills, uppers, downers, that's what he's got going. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5,

[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:24.340]
50 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:29.480]
Neil God. Yes, sir. Yes, hey, a couple of things. First of all, on the billboards,

[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:42.220]
the Mohawar billboard on the term pike actually has just been moved to the other side of the

[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:50.180]
old time. So it's still there. It's still there just in the opposite side. It's,

[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:56.700]
it's a kiss. Do they still have the old times, I'm sure? The old times and all the symbols

[02:02:56.700 --> 02:03:02.600]
of the schools as well. All of that, all of that syntax still, yeah. Okay. And also,

[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:08.580]
Rickling for a dream update at the best Buy and Hammer Mine, there are light coffee.

[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:17.600]
Yeah. On sale of the, of the, of the directors cut $9.99, great price. Really? Yeah. And I thought

[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:23.160]
one of them, so there's four left as far as I know. Okay. Yes, sir. One last thing.

[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:29.840]
One last thing, there's a great DVD coming out of being released tomorrow. The original length

[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:34.760]
cut of once upon a time in America, almost four hours long. Oh, it's coming out tomorrow?

[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:42.460]
I'll be there standing online. All right. Thank you. Thanks, pal. That's great because that

[02:03:42.460 --> 02:03:46.940]
the four hours long, isn't that good? Oh, yeah. No, seriously, it's a good movie.

[02:03:48.620 --> 02:03:51.960]
There aren't too many movies that are worth sitting for four hours in watching because you

[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:54.760]
don't have to watch it all one sitting, although it does, you know, take something away when you

[02:03:54.760 --> 02:04:01.720]
get up and go take a big dump. But no, that's what's the end. And that's another one that you keep

[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:05.500]
telling me the ending is okay. And I'm telling you, the ending is there is no ending. I was really

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:08.900]
high. And of course, it was after four hours. I might have been asleep when the ending came around.

[02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:14.180]
There could have been it. The directors cut once upon a time in America with Robert

[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:20.120]
D'Anoel and Brian Bloom, James Woods, James Woods and his zits, popping all over the place from that

[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:24.760]
garbage truck. And the very young, not even using her real name Jennifer Connelly as a, uh,

[02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:27.500]
some little punter. That's right. Jennifer Connelly is in there in the very young,

[02:04:27.500 --> 02:04:31.620]
Jennifer, Carlos looked it up because we were wondering why we didn't spot that before.

[02:04:31.660 --> 02:04:36.000]
Oh, that's right. That's the right name. Jennifer Connelly in the Brian Bloom. It was like,

[02:04:36.100 --> 02:04:43.940]
yeah, he kept looking through the wall in the toilet. Five six, five six seven, oh five 60,

[02:04:44.660 --> 02:04:48.300]
pound five 60 on a AT&T. Don't forget if you missed the beginning of the show,

[02:04:48.460 --> 02:04:53.580]
rules of attraction, edit your list. Vienerboy hasn't seen it. George hasn't seen it.

[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:57.200]
Vienerboy still hasn't seen Magnolia. You've got a lot of movie watching, a lot of

[02:04:57.200 --> 02:05:01.000]
old happiness, which I gave them, uh, gave them both. As a matter of fact, Magnolia's do

[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:08.480]
back tomorrow. So that's that. I guess puts you into a corner. You're like in a box now.

[02:05:08.740 --> 02:05:11.360]
In corners, you write into a box kind of like a way clearance. I do this morning.

[02:05:12.740 --> 02:05:18.080]
So no more excuses. No more carb breakdowns. No more sad stories. Tonight's the night for Magnolia.

[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:23.220]
Got it. Got it. Maybe Wednesday. I'm not sure. I suggest it is. If you have like dinner with

[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.120]
fancy restaurants tonight before you watch it, don't be ordered no frog legs.

[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:34.840]
Here's a lady in Boyton Beach. Hello. Hello. The lady in Boyton Beach is gone.

[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:41.940]
We haven't had one female. Hello, hello. Hello, hello. Oh, there she is. Okay. Oh, I scared a hell out of me.

[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:50.460]
Speaking of provocative and interesting. Yes. There's a story in the Palm Beach post today on

[02:05:50.460 --> 02:05:56.420]
the front page. I haven't had any chance to read it. It says, Foundations move to West Palm Beach,

[02:05:56.660 --> 02:06:06.940]
Ring Spell. Richard Mellon's case organization is moving to Palm Beach. Oh, great. So, uh, uh, uh,

[02:06:06.940 --> 02:06:12.860]
right before election, it mentioned some other organization that moved here from Winter Park,

[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:20.940]
to Winter Park, and they defeated the anti-gay bill. So, you might find that of interest when

[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:26.500]
you get around to it. Okay. I'll go on the website and during the break. Okay. Thanks for the bad news.

[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:30.420]
Right. Bye. Bye. See you. How do you like that? Richard Mellon's case. Those for our visitor right

[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:35.340]
wing lunatics coming upon Beach. See, it used to be the places where they would always be like in

[02:06:35.340 --> 02:06:42.240]
the Southern California, like in Orange County or in Arizona. All the real radical far right wing groups.

[02:06:42.240 --> 02:06:47.860]
Not a real common to Florida because that's where they assume the biggest crime. All the stuff that

[02:06:47.860 --> 02:06:56.820]
hanging chads all the crap. You ever check out the Palm Beach post website? No. About twice a year

[02:06:56.820 --> 02:07:02.780]
there's some good crap on there. Here it is Palm Beach Post dot com. Uh, voucher students back in

[02:07:02.780 --> 02:07:09.140]
public schools. West Palm Beach climbers to block noise wall. Uh, breaking news. Israel does. Oh,

[02:07:09.140 --> 02:07:14.540]
by the way, how do you like the road map? Oh, yeah. Can't get there. Oh, can't get there from here.

[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:20.620]
From anywhere. Stocks decline in midday trading. Uh, you see the thing about Richard Mellon's case.

[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:27.300]
Americans and Europeans flee Liberia capital are having a few problems. There are cases you haven't seen.

[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:34.240]
FBI drains Maryland pond and anthrax probe. We better check that out. What should I think? Okay.

[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:38.160]
But I don't see squat above Richard Mellon's cave. Well, either peanut butter will find it as

[02:07:38.160 --> 02:07:44.680]
somebody will fax it in or not as a case, maybe. 1241 at 560 WQM. Don't forget everything. I'm sure

[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:49.780]
soon or later finds its way to South Florida. I'll tell you a great place and that's the pizza lot.

[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:54.160]
They got two locations for you. How's Jeff doing? You heard from him lately? Not lately. Well, why not?

[02:07:54.340 --> 02:08:00.940]
I spoke to him Friday back in for food, but he was busy. Are you serious? Yeah. Well, Carlos was, uh,

[02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:07.060]
yeah, he said I could go in crazy. It's crazy with business. That's what he says. You're that or you just

[02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:10.980]
don't want to go on and feel that. Nah, that wouldn't be the case. He loves seeing you guys and getting

[02:08:10.980 --> 02:08:15.160]
the free plugs on here and going on. Tell us all his sex stories for hours and hours and hours. All

[02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:18.720]
of them true. Maybe that's what he's been real busy doing. And anyway, I'm sure he's been busy

[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.580]
cooking up all kinds of great stuff for you folks in daily of all places on university drive

[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:27.960]
between Griffin and 595 right behind Pairwood imports. They're an legendary location. The pizza lot

[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:32.440]
plaza with tons and tons of free parking for you. They got three different kinds of pizza including

[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:37.300]
that extra spicy food. Gaza pizza and they got calzones and seafood and veal and chicken and

[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:40.880]
super subs and the best garlic rolls in the history of mankind. I always talk about how the garlic

[02:08:40.880 --> 02:08:45.020]
rolls are just dripping with garlic. Some people don't like that. So if you tell them, you know,

[02:08:45.020 --> 02:08:48.600]
very light on a garlic, they'll do that for you. They serve it up to you anyway. You like it in

[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:52.280]
the food too. And the prices are so ridiculously low. You can take the whole family. The whole

[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:58.820]
office there over and over again without breaking the bank. 954 916 888. That's the number to call for

[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:06.660]
take out delivery or catering 954 916 888 or implantation. The newest pizza loft out in West

[02:09:06.660 --> 02:09:13.440]
Broward. Now he'll sunrise right beyond Walgreens 954 382 1999. Same great deal. Same delicious food.

[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:19.380]
Same fresh goodies that are unbelievable to low prices. The pizza loft in prestigious plantation 954

[02:09:19.380 --> 02:09:36.500]
382 1999. Oh here's comical alley the former i raki minister of information with a sports

[02:09:36.500 --> 02:09:46.160]
update. Hello sports fans. How about those Detroit Tigers? Oh no they're really hitting

[02:09:46.160 --> 02:09:52.400]
the cover of the ball huh? They continue their unparalleled reign in first place with an

[02:09:52.400 --> 02:10:00.760]
unbroken string of supreme victories. Oh doctor their opponents are wetting their tiny jacks that

[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:09.940]
in fear. They could go all the way. That's your look at sports. This is Mohammed Said.

[02:10:09.940 --> 02:10:17.200]
He does a half thing. We shall cut you into pieces like a snake. Stay tuned to this station

[02:10:17.200 --> 02:10:23.460]
for more updates from the raki minister of information. Rumor is Clarence's talk at him to replace

[02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:27.540]
the beast on a forel show in the morning. That's what I'm hearing. Here's that story. Foundations

[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:33.460]
moved area concerns liberals. Did you find it? Bonoboy? Yeah I'm still looking. Oh I got it.

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:38.140]
I'll find it. The so- the so-called vast right wing conspiracy is touched down in Palm Beach County.

[02:10:38.140 --> 02:10:42.320]
The Skate Family Foundation moved its home office here last month to West Palm Beach to

[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:46.840]
continue its mission of strengthening families and promoting animal welfare. Oh right.

[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.020]
Since the 1980s the foundation was headquartered in the same Pittsburgh suite with three other

[02:10:53.020 --> 02:10:57.660]
family organizations headed by billionaire Richard Mellon Skate. He was singled out by the Clinton

[02:10:57.660 --> 02:11:02.140]
White House as one of these seminal figures in the vast right wing conspiracy to topple the president.

[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:07.120]
Now liberals fear the Skate Foundation is writing a wave of conservative organizations that are

[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:12.260]
expanding and Florida to influence the nation's agenda as well as the 2004 elections. In other

[02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:17.340]
words if you think that they stole it in 2000 you ain't see nothing yet. Florida in many respects is

[02:11:17.340 --> 02:11:22.360]
the most important state of the nation said George Mure... Jorge George Mursouli. How big your

[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:27.860]
partner? Huh? That's his name with the J. Florida director for People for the American Way,

[02:11:27.940 --> 02:11:31.920]
a liberal policy group. Change something here and you can change it on the national level whether

[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.840]
it's school vouchers or gay rights. Obviously the foundation sees some benefit to being here.

[02:11:37.780 --> 02:11:42.100]
And it goes on it's a lengthy I'll save it. We haven't put it on in tomorrow right?

[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:47.880]
But of course. I mean I could say it to you now but you know you never know it might be another

[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:52.340]
slow day with news tomorrow so we'll save it for tomorrow also since I checked out the Palm Beach

[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:57.200]
posters that other story FBI drains Marilyn pond in anthrax program. How do I like that?

[02:11:57.940 --> 02:12:01.100]
Just the time when most of us had forgotten about anthrax.

[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:06.720]
Fredrick Mureland the FBI was draining municipal pond today in search of evidence of how anthrax

[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:12.600]
lace letters were assembled in 2001 attacks that killed five people. You remember the FBI's

[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:16.060]
Washington Field Office released a statement saying that its agents and those from U.S. Postal

[02:12:16.060 --> 02:12:19.680]
Service were conducting searches related to the investigation of the origin of the anthrax

[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:23.860]
lace letters mill in 2001. The purpose of these searches is to locate and collect items of

[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:28.120]
evidence related to the attack statements as to facilitate the search activity one pond will be

[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:34.120]
drained. No further details were provided. When you think that if there was evidence in the pond now

[02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:40.580]
that it would be maybe a little soggy by now. The anthrax. The anthrax or the evidence or both.

[02:12:41.260 --> 02:12:48.300]
Just a little on the soggy side. It says for protection against airborne bacteria person can put

[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:53.140]
envelopes and secured anthrax powder into the box. Then weighed into shallow water and submerged

[02:12:53.140 --> 02:12:58.440]
to put the bacteria into the envelopes underwater. Some involved in the case believe the post said,

[02:12:58.540 --> 02:13:03.640]
the Washington Post, afterward the envelopes could have been sealed inside plastic bags to be removed

[02:13:03.640 --> 02:13:09.600]
from the underwater chamber. So there how do you like that? Some investigators said the water

[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.780]
theory is the result of the FBI's interest in Stephen Hadfield that positioned in bio-terrorism

[02:13:14.780 --> 02:13:18.580]
expert who formerly worked as researcher with U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of infectious

[02:13:18.580 --> 02:13:23.680]
diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick. That facility is the primary custodian of the strain of

[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:28.520]
anthrax found in the envelope sent to the victims. Attorney General John I am a fascist ascrofters

[02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:33.200]
described Hadfield as a person of interest in the investigation and yada yada it is still on his ass.

[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:37.840]
How do you like that? So they're draining it. They're draining it and they're straining it.

[02:13:38.740 --> 02:13:45.520]
Now let's see that was right after that was a fall of 2001 and here it's almost the summer of 2003.

[02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:51.500]
Got it? No. Got the perpetrator? How about Osama? We got him? No. How about Sodom? We find? No.

[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:56.780]
Did you see that they were looking for DNA evidence? Oh, in that house and the rubble of the house that

[02:13:56.780 --> 02:14:01.280]
they they already admitted it was the wrong house. It was next door to where he had been seen. No. Yeah.

[02:14:01.280 --> 02:14:05.440]
It wasn't the wrong house. Were all those innocent people died? No DNA. No. What a surprise.

[02:14:05.700 --> 02:14:10.320]
There are no innocent irackies. As a matter of fact what they said was they found as much Sodom DNA

[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:15.240]
in that house as they have found weapons of mass destruction so far. And I could just hear

[02:14:15.240 --> 02:14:20.960]
remissing him. Zip but he do that. You know, could hear him singing it. 5, 6, 7 we got 8 million

[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:24.800]
open lines here today. It's been a real struggle boys and girls. It's been a real battle

[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:32.920]
of battle against the world. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:14:33.860 --> 02:14:43.680]
Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Probably gone. Probably on the old Hershey highway right now.

[02:14:45.340 --> 02:14:49.020]
Now wait a minute. Is there something happening on this phone now? You've never picked up a line.

[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:54.160]
Well, I'm hitting it and it's not working now. Hit it again. I just I'm hitting six.

[02:14:54.160 --> 02:14:58.120]
Nothing is happening on my line. Oh, don't tell me this can't be happening to me again.

[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:06.320]
Please tell me the same happening to me. Oh, no, I'm hitting lines and nothing is happening. How do you

[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:12.380]
like that? I'm doing lines. What are you will make in guttable sounds? There's nothing

[02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:19.560]
happening. That's all I can think to do right now. Zip but he do it all like I just said. I think

[02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:23.140]
that describes how many calls we're going to be taking. Why don't you try pushing up line 6?

[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:30.300]
See what happens. I got it. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes, I am. Hi, Neil.

[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:34.780]
Hey, that last little product in the track might as well have been from Brighton Beach.

[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:40.720]
Not from Boyton Beach. Uh-huh. Maybe it was more. Yeah, could have been safe. We're calling from the other side.

[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:44.400]
Yeah, we never knew we never found out what happened to see more. Maybe still as a track.

[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:49.300]
Yeah. Yeah. I'm Neil one more thing.

[02:15:50.160 --> 02:15:54.060]
Once they whack Moe, wouldn't it be cool if his life kind of spiraled out of control?

[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:59.680]
Okay. See, this thing ain't working. Now did I cut it off or did you? Me? Oh, 5, 6, 7,

[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:03.200]
oh, 5, 6, but how are we going to do this to the rest of the show? Why did all of a sudden that we

[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:07.540]
have this disconnect? Let me try one thing. Okay. All right. Try one thing. Okay. One of them, please.

[02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:17.420]
Oh, it's coming back. Now I've got your my dots and maybe my check mark. There they are.

[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:21.760]
Should I try? Yeah. All the names on the left side of the cities have vanished.

[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:25.180]
But that's okay. They're all the same. QAM Hello. Boka.

[02:16:25.340 --> 02:16:29.940]
Hello. Neil, I'm a lady in Falcon. You're a bastard. Uh-huh. Okay. Thanks.

[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:34.840]
Thanks for the phony voice or the real voice. Whatever the hell it was. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:40.360]
pound 5, 60. Maybe that was Moe's wife, you think? Uh-huh. What are you laughing about? She was calling

[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:44.700]
from Boka. Yeah. And she said I'm a bastard and there are no other women in Boka who think I'm

[02:16:44.700 --> 02:16:49.620]
a bastard. Said maybe Moe's wife, which part of Boka? Maybe she was in North Boka. Maybe she was in

[02:16:49.620 --> 02:16:54.000]
that place that the Pharrell was talking about. Now you're going to start that again. Oh, we had a great

[02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:57.540]
Josh Friedman story that we forgot to talk about today. That's right. You know, there's a lot of

[02:16:57.540 --> 02:17:03.800]
Josh Friedman stories involving violence when you add them all up. Yeah. Like this one.

[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:09.160]
Josh Friedman had a little run in with somebody from the Marlins because Josh Friedman has been

[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:15.540]
canned from QAIM. His contract not renewed, which means bye-bye. And so I guess they originally told

[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:18.600]
him he can keep his credentials from the Marlins game. Correct me if I'm getting this story wrong.

[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:23.020]
As you told me. One of the Mucky Mucks in upper level management. Right. And then I guess for whatever

[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:27.060]
reason, maybe because of the smell. I don't know if you wanted to. Steve, do we want to say his name?

[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:32.680]
No. Okay. So there was a run in with one of the Mucky Mucks from the Marlins who said,

[02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:36.200]
no, we changed their mind. You can't have your credentials. You can't come out here. You no

[02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:42.400]
longer work for QAIM and you can't come in here free anymore. And so they wanted his credentials back.

[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:46.400]
And according to the story, he didn't want to give the credentials back. He had the thing around

[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:51.160]
his neck, you know, with a chain of holding on. Right. And got into kind of a scuffle with the guy

[02:17:51.160 --> 02:17:55.940]
from the organization. The one who tried to yank the thing from around his neck when he refused to turn

[02:17:55.940 --> 02:18:01.000]
the credentials back over. And they had like a little bit of a scuffle. And the rumor is that Josh

[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:04.360]
farted on him and we never saw that guy no more. He sat on him. Is that it?

[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:12.600]
He's shmacked on him. Something. Maybe all of the above. I don't think you'd be seeing that guy. No, Mo.

[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:17.980]
See now, now, how come are these not going to show up on the left side of the food?

[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:21.500]
The main set you're not going to get them unless he actually hangs up and re-enters.

[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:26.180]
Oh, don't do that. Yeah. Pembro Pines. Like I said, here's Pembro Pines. Hello.

[02:18:26.740 --> 02:18:31.940]
Dale, how you doing? Pretty good. On your recommendation, I saw a Requiem yesterday. And?

[02:18:32.420 --> 02:18:40.140]
Awesome. That movie was phenomenal. The cinematography was so unique. It reminded me of another movie I

[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:48.120]
saw recently. And it was pie. Same director, Alan Uski. Yeah. That's probably why I reminded you of it.

[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:53.220]
Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Only this is much better than pie. Yeah, it was. This was like

[02:18:53.220 --> 02:19:02.820]
a red-eyed punky pie. Definitely. It's in the top five. You're right. Okay. I've been listening to more of the more red-pounding. Thanks. He enjoyed it.

[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:04.540]
Frankly, I'm for a dream.

[02:19:08.760 --> 02:19:11.760]
See, the, you know what the problem is? Our case is too good. That's a problem.

[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:18.200]
No, I'm serious. That's why you come up with these esoteric movies like Momento and this one and

[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.540]
some of the other ones. And people are saying, oh, I mean, that was so ponderous. And it was so boring and

[02:19:23.540 --> 02:19:27.640]
didn't have like a whole bunch of great special effects. Yeah, we're the explosion. Yeah, we're all bunch of

[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:31.540]
explosions and car crashes and fun crap like that. Why?

[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:40.040]
We're sports video 560s. You're a, yeah. Don't you just hate people that use snappy

[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:44.740]
openers for their show segments like that one to two. Wow.

[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:53.280]
Award winning dramas. Movies on continuous loop. And now coming next month, HBO presents

[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:59.960]
an all-new musical version of the HBO prison drama. Oz, starring Christopher Lowell.

[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:18.460]
That's where I want it to be. There's wonder why it went on my...

[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:23.320]
Harvey fires the, I will ain't Jack so let her, Saran Rappler sweater,

[02:20:23.580 --> 02:20:28.480]
voice derives with band-aid. And I know for you, the wimp, the envy,

[02:20:29.100 --> 02:20:33.960]
anywhere you wish the fire was only in Japan. And the entire osmaning population.

[02:20:34.420 --> 02:20:37.800]
You've got the season just in the world of the rhythm of our...

[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:44.900]
This is the wonderful prison of Oz, the musical next month on HBO.

[02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:53.520]
102 at 560 WDQM. It's our big one to two-hour. It's gigantic. It's flame-ing.

[02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:58.140]
And we're famous. When one of our regular fans who says another good site for movie reviews

[02:20:58.140 --> 02:21:03.900]
is rottentomators.com. Famine you were there? Nope. Yeah, it's not bad. Not as good as mdb,

[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:08.120]
but it's not bad. I like mdb. In fact, I'm going to read the whole list of the top 250 movies

[02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:12.360]
is selected by. Well, I'm going to better we only got one call on the board. And that's probably

[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.300]
is going to be real quick. Here's my any. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, what's up?

[02:21:16.640 --> 02:21:20.920]
How you doing? Nothing. I just wanted to tell you that I like you show, okay?

[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:26.500]
Have you ever seen the movie The Judicial Suspect? No, I haven't seen that. That's a good movie.

[02:21:28.120 --> 02:21:32.760]
Okay, put it on my list. Thanks, Pellie. Okay. See, there you go. That's it. That's it. So,

[02:21:32.760 --> 02:21:37.140]
I think I'll read the list and we'll just play some music in the back. What do you think?

[02:21:37.720 --> 02:21:40.920]
Okay. Or I'm going to get I can get the Toronto phone book in the other room.

[02:21:43.140 --> 02:21:47.740]
Or I can read this fact. The rest of the facts from when who says I heard Rimmer on 940 this morning

[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:51.220]
talking about tonight's hockey game. The host asked him who his money was on. He said he was

[02:21:51.220 --> 02:21:56.440]
keeping his wallet in his pocket. What a surprise. They were getting ready to hang up on him when

[02:21:56.440 --> 02:22:01.440]
he said, if you want to talk about the game tomorrow, give me a call. He must be lonely. Better

[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:05.660]
than some others I know of you know what I mean? I heard Mo on had JD on John David's in this

[02:22:05.660 --> 02:22:09.600]
morning. That was good. Although it just bugs me the fact that Mo pretends he knows something about

[02:22:09.600 --> 02:22:18.200]
he wouldn't know Martin Brodour from Dean Martin. You know what I'm saying? No. Well, no, you wouldn't

[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:21.620]
either. Well, in other words, he knows about as much about hockey as you do. It's said he's got a

[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:25.780]
few names on a piece of paper somewhere. I see. That's what really bugs me. I've been to a couple

[02:22:25.780 --> 02:22:31.280]
games. No matter fact, you know, so that's one and the two thirds more games than he's been to.

[02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:36.200]
After they invited him to come to one game when he first brought his ugly to pay an

[02:22:36.200 --> 02:22:40.140]
asset down and he showed up with his wife and they sat down there by the glass in the front and

[02:22:40.140 --> 02:22:44.920]
they stayed for a few minutes and left. Maybe a period I guess put in a grand appearance. You know,

[02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:48.240]
one of those deals. But why should he be different from most of the other sports guys

[02:22:48.240 --> 02:22:54.200]
begun in the station, right? That's right. But I'll say it again. Women softball beat the hockey

[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:58.840]
in a rating. So, you know, who to help can they blame five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:07.120]
sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line? Here's a call from Weston. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:23:07.420 --> 02:23:13.280]
If you ever seen what's the fun of time in America with James Wood and the narrow. Yes, we're

[02:23:13.280 --> 02:23:18.120]
just talking about only a moment. That's okay. The DVD comes out tomorrow. The record's cut

[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:24.380]
less about 20 hours. Why wasn't it ever shown in the full version in the United States, you know?

[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:30.880]
Too long. Too long. It was three and a half hours. If you read any reviews on it, it's

[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:34.440]
supposed to be pretty good or? Yeah, I've seen it. I've seen it several times. It's very good.

[02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:38.820]
Oh, it is good. It's very good. But you better like, you know, get ready to take a nap in the middle.

[02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:44.620]
Okay, thanks. Okay, you know, it's excellent. Although there's some people who wouldn't like it

[02:23:44.620 --> 02:23:48.660]
because again, it's one of those that's all over the place and there's a lot of flashbacks and then

[02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:55.240]
the ending is bizarre. Now, I guess when you got the director's cut, I sure hope it doesn't date. Well,

[02:23:55.500 --> 02:24:00.420]
don't don't watch that stuff. Don't watch when they interview him. Okay, although I guess most people

[02:24:00.420 --> 02:24:03.720]
want to see what he says is he's going to say it was an opium trip and none of this ever really

[02:24:03.720 --> 02:24:07.280]
happened in the first place and it was all in the Robert De Niro's mind because if he says that at

[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:12.340]
that point, that's when you want to blow his brains out. And you see, you wasted four hours of my time

[02:24:12.340 --> 02:24:16.160]
for an opium trip and this isn't like a real story, which at first of all, it's a movie anyway.

[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:19.740]
So what difference does it make if it's a real story or not? Right? I want a real story.

[02:24:19.860 --> 02:24:23.800]
I see there are people, those people bug me. People that want a nitpick. People that want to like

[02:24:23.800 --> 02:24:29.540]
pick it apart. I watch it for enjoyment. If I like it, I enjoy it. Great. I don't have to analyze.

[02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:33.480]
I don't have to like, oh, well, what did he have in mind when he did this? I'm not interested in that.

[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:37.060]
I'm not a pseudo intellectual. I'm just an old fat slob and proud of it.

[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:43.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, boy, boy, this has been a battle that they had, didn't it? Yeah.

[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:49.900]
Been a battle just to stay to keep our heads above water because there isn't a god damn thing.

[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:54.100]
We got the Hillary book. Nobody cares about it. Somebody will go out and buy it. I guarantee you're

[02:24:54.100 --> 02:24:57.220]
plenty of people listening to me right now. They'll go out and waste a lot of money on it. They won't

[02:24:57.220 --> 02:25:04.640]
learn a damn thing other than that she was shocked and dismayed when he told her about Monica.

[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:09.920]
Is there anybody with an IQ larger than the thumb who believes that? This is a god that's been

[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:14.400]
hooring around on her for as long as we can remember and she was shocked and dismayed that it was

[02:25:14.400 --> 02:25:20.320]
getting blow jobs from Monica, that he was screwing around on the side on the ice princess.

[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:28.320]
If you God forbid were married to that, would you be screwing around on the side? Either way,

[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:35.500]
you. Oh, asking a wrong guy. Being a boy, if you were married to a nice princess like Hillary,

[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:41.760]
would a little clearance come in here and yeah, it brought me like that. I think the answer is

[02:25:41.760 --> 02:25:46.980]
yeah, he would. Anticl your prostate prostate put you in the prostate position.

[02:25:49.880 --> 02:25:58.300]
Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Neil is raining outside again. I just

[02:25:59.060 --> 02:26:05.140]

[02:26:05.140 --> 02:26:10.360]
you help me with that name of that movie? What do you mean by that? Well, what's the name of the

[02:26:10.360 --> 02:26:14.080]
movie? Do you remember that movie? A horse racing movie with Richard drivers? No, but I'll

[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:18.700]
look up Richard. Are you serious? Or is this a joke? No, no, no, I'm serious. It was

[02:26:18.700 --> 02:26:23.320]
filmed at highly a race track. Okay, I'm looking. I'm looking on the Richard drivers thing on here,

[02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:29.480]
okay? Jennifer Tilley was in the movie. Jennifer Tilley? Yes, yes, sir. Okay, Richard

[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:34.380]
drivers on eBay, okay? This will have a list of every movie he was ever in and something he'd like

[02:26:34.380 --> 02:26:40.000]
to forget. Yeah, this one he probably liked to forget. Young runaways. No, no, no,

[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:48.800]
we know it wasn't jaws. Crippin Dorf's tribe. Another stakeout. No, Mr. Holland's penis. We know

[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:55.600]
wasn't that one. No, no, no. The goodbye girl. No, lost in Yonkers. No, he wasn't at the track

[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.740]
in Yonkers. He may have been, but this was filmed in highland. Silent fall, moon over

[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:10.040]
Peridor. No, that was a good movie though. Nuts, the big fix. No, that wasn't it? No, sir.

[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:17.860]
Stakeout, 10 men with Danny DeVito. No. Lansky, no, the goodbye girl, no, the

[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:25.100]
prisoner of honor. That don't sound like it. No. Once around American graffiti. No,

[02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:37.580]
sign photo. No. Nice. Not so nice. Oh my god, no. Always. Let it ride. Yes. Oh,

[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:43.660]
fine. Thank god. I was getting ready. All right. All right. Where am I the favorite? Wait a minute.

[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:48.200]
Let me let me just click on it this second here and see what I can find out about. 1989.

[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:54.780]
Okay. She was very hot in that movie, by the way. Who was Jennifer Tilley? She's always hot.

[02:27:55.260 --> 02:28:00.900]
All right. I got another one for you. Cool hand Luke. Yeah. The scene where the girl was washing

[02:28:00.900 --> 02:28:04.560]
the car was one of the hottest scenes in any of those movies. I remember that.

[02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:06.380]
I remember that. I remember that. I remember that. The one where Jennifer Conley was looking

[02:28:06.380 --> 02:28:11.940]
in the mirror in Requiem. Maybe. Yeah. I think so. Okay. Thanks very much, pal, for killing me.

[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:16.340]
Well, at least I found him as information. Now, what was the info? See, let it ride.

[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:20.900]
No, I didn't really want to know. I just wanted to find out for him. Okay.

[02:28:21.700 --> 02:28:26.260]
Jesus, Richard Dreyfus is sure made a hell of a lot of movies. Not necessarily any good ones.

[02:28:26.460 --> 02:28:33.660]
I don't like him. No. No. And you know why? I give up. Close encounters. Oh, well, you can't

[02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:38.860]
hold that against him. But I do. His performance in that was so that was such a bad movie. Yeah.

[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:43.920]
And his performance was so spastic and ever. Listen, I can't help it. I just ever since that movie,

[02:28:43.920 --> 02:28:49.840]
I don't like him. I see him as a melodramatic actor. And then Mr. Holland's penis or whatever

[02:28:49.840 --> 02:28:56.040]
that was that would talk about Cornball. Yeah. Wow. Man, even in Iowa, the corn, even Diffo never

[02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:04.000]
had corn at bed. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. I'm the

[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.360]
near Rogers movie show. Yeah, let's just do movies from now on. Tell at least to a clock.

[02:29:10.100 --> 02:29:14.060]
Don't you think? Okay. Well, look at all the calls we had about rules of attraction.

[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:19.660]
Oh, no. You're like it. It's definitely not one of them. You'll both enjoy it. You should go out

[02:29:19.660 --> 02:29:23.340]
and get that today. And you can have like a little circle jerk going. You can like he's watching

[02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:27.500]
Magnolia today. You can watch rules of attraction and pass it on to him so you can do like your own

[02:29:27.500 --> 02:29:37.280]
Netflix and charge him about 10 bucks. Here's Lighthouse Point. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah,

[02:29:37.280 --> 02:29:42.680]
you watch the memento, right? Yes. The way it's on the CD, right? You realize it on the second

[02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:48.140]
CD. You have the box with the blue cover. Sure do. The second CD has the movie in its correct

[02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:52.140]
order. So everything is going backwards. Bring it on. Are you serious? Bring it. Yes, sir.

[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:56.640]
Oh, I'm going to watch that today. Wow. You have to go. You have those funny menus on the front,

[02:29:56.780 --> 02:30:02.540]
right? Right. You have to find a picture. I believe it's either binoculars or perglasses of

[02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:08.360]
some sort. Uh-huh. And you keep answering the questions as answer C. And then you'll come up

[02:30:08.360 --> 02:30:13.140]
to a sequence where you have to put four pictures in their proper order. If you put them in reverse

[02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:18.880]
order, the movie will play the way it should be seen without it going backwards. I'll be dang.

[02:30:18.880 --> 02:30:22.260]
But they're probably on the second. Only on the second disco, right? It's on the second

[02:30:22.260 --> 02:30:26.920]
disc. Yes. Okay. That's why a lot of people have trouble watching it. The first time is saying

[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:30.900]
this is wacky. But when you do watch it, the problem, right? Yeah, but that's what made it fun

[02:30:30.900 --> 02:30:35.660]
the first time is that it was wacky. It was all out of order, right? Exactly. The friends that I have

[02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:40.280]
watching it and including my wife's sister and say, oh my gosh, that is so weird. There's no way I'm

[02:30:40.280 --> 02:30:43.980]
going to understand how this movie goes. Yeah. And I find out that it's on the second disc. And

[02:30:43.980 --> 02:30:48.140]
once you watch it, the second time around. You've got to tell your friends they got to do a lot more

[02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:52.400]
drugs before they once the first one. There you go. Okay. Thanks, pal. Okay. Oh, I'm speaking

[02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:55.900]
of that. I'm so glad he may see. I knew that eventually we'd get a call at the, I really

[02:30:55.900 --> 02:30:59.900]
have sunk my teeth and new. Now, what do they call those things? Because I really poop-pooted.

[02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:03.300]
Because I'm just a novice at the whole DVD thing anyway, which, you know, I mean, a lot of people

[02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:08.380]
aren't into it yet. Easter eggs. What is it? Easter eggs. Easter eggs. Now we're talking.

[02:31:10.760 --> 02:31:17.020]
What's the deal with that? I see you don't know. I stop pursuing it. I've never seen one. How

[02:31:17.020 --> 02:31:21.160]
are you supposed to find it? I mean, is this like a cult and the underground thing? Well, here's

[02:31:21.160 --> 02:31:25.800]
two things that I'm confused about. Well, you laugh at a box. It's true. Yeah. There's two things.

[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:31.340]
One group of people calls the Easter egg just any kind of hidden anything that you don't notice.

[02:31:31.880 --> 02:31:36.480]
Right. They're referring to that as Easter eggs. But then there are things within the DVDs

[02:31:36.480 --> 02:31:40.640]
that are specifically put there by the manufacturer just as a little extra, just as a little

[02:31:41.380 --> 02:31:45.780]
something for you to do. One's to see in the movie. And then when you go to these websites,

[02:31:45.780 --> 02:31:49.320]
they tell you what they're finding. You mean, like that picture of Gerard Lido naked? Yeah.

[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:54.680]
Yeah. You go to these websites and they tell you how to find the hidden material.

[02:31:55.460 --> 02:31:57.780]
Like the one that I found is already detailed. Well, what website?

[02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:02.780]
I bookmarked it one moment please. Oh, that's where we talked about it one day. A couple of

[02:32:02.780 --> 02:32:08.700]
weeks ago, Easter eggs up your answer or something like that. E-eggs.com. Oh, that's right. We looked at

[02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:14.960]
it. But I mean, does that have like a link to all the different movies that have these on? It's

[02:32:14.960 --> 02:32:21.060]
got a database and it's got e-mailers have emailed their take on different things. They're take?

[02:32:21.060 --> 02:32:25.240]
Yeah. You look up a movie and then you get to see what other people have said about where the

[02:32:25.240 --> 02:32:30.260]
eggs are if there are eggs, what you find. Yeah. Part of the fun is the detective work trying to find

[02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:37.180]
the eggs. Get it like an Easter egg hunt. Yeah. But you're telling me that you can actually do this

[02:32:37.180 --> 02:32:40.500]
on your DVD player. You don't have to like do this for the computer. Some of them.

[02:32:41.780 --> 02:32:48.020]
Apparently there are Easter eggs and everything. DVDs, software, audio CDs, you name it. You know,

[02:32:48.020 --> 02:32:55.300]
I really love those Cadbury Easter eggs. Oh, the ones with the cream. No, not the ones with the cream.

[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:59.640]
Now the ones with the hard shell. Either or. They have the small ones with the hard shell.

[02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:03.880]
Cadbury's that have like a cream filling. I'm not talking about those. I'm talking about the

[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:09.240]
small ones with a hard shell, man. They're so good. And they come in a bag of about 45,000. Are you

[02:33:09.240 --> 02:33:14.680]
talking about the multids or the non-multids? I'm talking about taking a break. What? Stop!

[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:19.440]
You maniac. Are you out of your mind? He's actually encouraging this.

Come on, baby, you're the...

[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:29.980]
You're back

[02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.240]

Come on, come on, come on, come on, let the lotion with me

[02:36:05.140 --> 02:36:07.160]
So I go to the Easter Eggs Archive

[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:09.740]
And for some strange reason, this page won't print.

[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:10.820]
Bonerboy

[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:16.360]
I've tried three different ways of printing this page, you will not print out

[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:19.760]
I have to go to it to see

[02:36:20.620 --> 02:36:24.720]
Anyway, so you go to, for example, it's got a whole list of the different DVDs

[02:36:24.720 --> 02:36:33.820]
Memento and the one that he was just talking about chronological order in the limited edition and it tells you insert this two from limited edition set and then select the clock.

[02:36:35.060 --> 02:36:46.840]
Select answer C five times the actual answer that we do with an navigation when you reach the question where you put the pictures in order of the woman fixing her tire put them in reverse order.

[02:36:47.240 --> 02:36:49.000]
Three four one two.

[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:49.400]
What?

[02:36:50.880 --> 02:36:55.860]
Well, I'm trying to like print this out so I can take this with what I'm saying right.

[02:36:56.180 --> 02:36:59.380]
I guess I can write it out, but I'm lazy writing.

[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:00.660]
Who does that anymore?

[02:37:00.820 --> 02:37:01.140]
Exactly.

[02:37:01.740 --> 02:37:05.420]
So there you go. There's just one example because the Memento's got four four Easter eggs that they know.

[02:37:05.640 --> 02:37:06.040]
Wow.

[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:06.980]
That would be exciting.

[02:37:07.280 --> 02:37:13.000]
Here's our chronic factor, Jane, who says, did you hear about the Republican plan to change the Senate rules on filibuster?

[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:18.080]
Democrats have actually been showing some balls and filibustering some of Bush's scary old judicial nominees, which is most of them.

[02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:23.300]
The Republicans want to lower the number of votes from 67 to 51 and have Dick Cheney break the tie.

[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:24.280]
Oh, no.

[02:37:24.720 --> 02:37:27.120]
Not going to happen. They'll have a revolution.

[02:37:28.500 --> 02:37:32.000]
Jane says, I know it's the colors for it, but for all those too much sports.

[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:34.040]
Founders, Quackers, Inters, Auders.

[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:34.740]
Yes, see.

[02:37:36.320 --> 02:37:37.020]
That's a good one.

[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:41.680]
They love Ferell, man. Ferell is kicking ass with this audience over 40% bottom on 6010.

[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:46.040]
He's only been on like a week and one day, a week and one day and already they're in love with Ferell.

[02:37:46.160 --> 02:37:46.340]
Okay.

[02:37:47.700 --> 02:37:52.460]
Now, I don't know if that's as much of the pro Ferell that part of it is that and part of it is the anti-mothing.

[02:37:52.700 --> 02:37:54.220]
That could be part of it.

[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:55.900]
Oh, what's this thing doing up here?

[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:57.120]
Oh, no.

[02:37:57.120 --> 02:37:57.480]
Oh, no.

[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:04.200]
God, this thing is doing some strange things today.

[02:38:04.540 --> 02:38:06.420]
This screen, you know, on the untilos.

[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:06.680]
Yeah.

[02:38:07.460 --> 02:38:08.020]
But again.

[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:10.200]
Oh.

[02:38:13.180 --> 02:38:15.220]
Oh, I see what that was. That had to do with my printer.

[02:38:15.380 --> 02:38:16.500]
Now, why would that show up on there?

[02:38:17.340 --> 02:38:19.360]
What the hell would that have to do with my printer on that screen?

[02:38:19.420 --> 02:38:21.540]
It's not connected to my computer. I don't get it.

[02:38:21.580 --> 02:38:22.220]
So you think.

[02:38:23.000 --> 02:38:23.140]
Huh?

[02:38:24.140 --> 02:38:24.700]
Yeah, exactly.

[02:38:25.900 --> 02:38:27.580]
Oh, what a disaster.

[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:30.000]
Here's a call from Marco Island. Hello.

[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:31.520]
Hey, Neil.

[02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:32.200]
Yes.

[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:32.960]
Yeah.

[02:38:33.540 --> 02:38:36.940]
I have something for your listeners that maybe you could take a poll.

[02:38:38.660 --> 02:38:40.660]
You know how it's firm stern.

[02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:41.640]
Yeah.

[02:38:42.140 --> 02:38:42.500]
Yeah.

[02:38:42.980 --> 02:38:46.660]
I'd like to hear both of you on the radio talking to one another.

[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:50.400]
He's a big Republican, your big Democrat.

[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.700]
I think it would be a very interesting show.

[02:38:54.820 --> 02:38:55.780]
He's not going to do that.

[02:38:55.940 --> 02:38:56.800]
And he did what I.

[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:58.200]
You wouldn't do it.

[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.320]
First of all, why would I debate him on politics?

[02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:03.360]
I mean, how is it clown? He should keep his nose out of politics.

[02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:04.540]
He knows nothing about it.

[02:39:04.980 --> 02:39:07.460]
Well, I just find it.

[02:39:07.900 --> 02:39:10.180]
I think it would be pretty good.

[02:39:11.100 --> 02:39:11.940]
Not going to happen.

[02:39:12.420 --> 02:39:12.920]
All right.

[02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:13.960]
Have a great day.

[02:39:14.480 --> 02:39:14.720]
You too.

[02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:19.760]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:39:20.640 --> 02:39:25.940]
That's like saying, why don't I debate Ish Kabibbel about, you know, the race on Saturday?

[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:26.540]
Hey.

[02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:31.260]
Do you know that there was a recent answer in Chicago who called himself Ish Kabibbel?

[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:32.520]
No, I did not know that.

[02:39:32.540 --> 02:39:33.100]
No, you know that.

[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:35.740]
Because I was going to say about horse racing, but somebody would have caught me on that.

[02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:37.540]
No matter what you say, somebody got out.

[02:39:37.580 --> 02:39:38.100]
Got you.

[02:39:38.340 --> 02:39:38.640]
Got you.

[02:39:39.140 --> 02:39:40.240]
You know that game they play.

[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:41.520]
There's our poll question today.

[02:39:41.600 --> 02:39:42.460]

My spouse hundred and thirty six.

[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:47.400]
I trust nobody.

[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:48.220]
128.

[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:49.540]

Mohawar david ten.

[02:39:56.640 --> 02:39:59.620]
And my priest rabbi minister only four votes out of six hundred and fifty four.

[02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:01.080]
Pretty lame on the clergy there.

[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:01.660]
Pretty weak.

[02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:03.300]
Pretty pretty weak.

[02:40:03.540 --> 02:40:04.800]
And what were you saying about the eggs?

[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:07.680]
I said I could go for something.

[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:10.460]
He's the Rex.

[02:40:10.580 --> 02:40:12.060]
Why did you give me started with that can't breathe?

[02:40:12.160 --> 02:40:13.600]
Those things are killer.

[02:40:13.920 --> 02:40:16.900]
Those will just send your blood sugar skyrocketing.

[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:20.800]
Those are like taking at needle that Harry was putting into that purple vein.

[02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:21.820]
Mm-hmm.

[02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:25.360]
That big oozing purple soaring just sticking it right in the middle there.

[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:26.880]
Never have almond roca.

[02:40:28.920 --> 02:40:31.860]
Are you going to start with that almond brittle again that I turned everybody on to?

[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:32.440]
Oh, it's that.

[02:40:32.500 --> 02:40:33.200]
Remember that almond brittle.

[02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:33.560]
Oh yeah.

[02:40:33.860 --> 02:40:34.140]
I remember.

[02:40:34.540 --> 02:40:35.100]
Did you get it?

[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:35.420]
Yes.

[02:40:36.260 --> 02:40:37.480]
They must want to hear about it.

[02:40:37.540 --> 02:40:38.140]
I forgot.

[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:39.320]
I forgot all about it.

[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:40.060]
Here's Miami.

Hey, I'm not sure you're not really too fond of dry.

[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:56.820]
Is that what you said a couple of minutes?

[02:40:56.900 --> 02:40:58.700]
I'm trying to say I can't stand him as when I said.

[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:00.480]
Well, here's one movie.

[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:02.580]
I don't know if you ever saw it was called insert.

[02:41:03.920 --> 02:41:04.700]
It was an all.

[02:41:04.920 --> 02:41:08.320]
It was a movie came out in the about in the mid to late 70s.

[02:41:08.320 --> 02:41:11.720]
It was like the beginning of pornography and trifus was in it.

[02:41:12.040 --> 02:41:12.340]
No.

[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:13.220]
Yeah.

[02:41:13.380 --> 02:41:14.160]
Oh, I don't want to see.

[02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:14.660]
I don't want to see.

[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:14.660]

[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:15.620]
I don't think he answered anything.

[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:16.720]
Yeah, really.

[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.140]
I don't think he's got anything big enough.

[02:41:18.860 --> 02:41:21.640]
But yeah, it was all about getting that money shot.

[02:41:21.840 --> 02:41:27.760]
It took place in the in the in the 20s or the 30s when pornography was just getting started.

[02:41:27.760 --> 02:41:30.560]
What would it mean in the 20s or 30s?

[02:41:30.940 --> 02:41:31.120]
It started.

[02:41:31.340 --> 02:41:35.400]
It took place in the 20s or the 30s in 1920s.

[02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:35.720]
You know.

[02:41:36.560 --> 02:41:38.800]
And it was it was all about it was all about it was.

[02:41:38.800 --> 02:41:43.160]
Why I see what he was asking was what it was supposed to take place in the 20s or 30s.

[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:48.860]
I apologize. Yeah. Yeah, but it was it was a strange movie. It was all about point about

[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:00.480]

[02:46:13.780 --> 02:46:17.400]
God, favor sing along with me, because this is unbelievable, huh?

[02:46:17.400 --> 02:46:22.680]
I've got the United States doing crazy, trying to convince people to attack me.

[02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:25.500]
Except for Sean Penn, of course, who's on my side.

[02:46:25.940 --> 02:46:29.580]
He loves me like crazy, funny little poop.

[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:36.420]
All get used to a lie by hard knocks when I give you the small pops.

[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:39.580]
You shoulda loved a little harder.

[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:44.820]
Silly boss, kiss the touch of this murderer.

[02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:47.080]
Thank you very much.

[02:46:47.500 --> 02:46:49.540]
Please, keep your way to her waiters' house.

[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:54.200]
134-26-2, mad dog 2-4-2, the saffron,

[02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:56.240]
Noon Hankback in town from Shulas this afternoon.

[02:46:56.860 --> 02:46:59.320]
So anyway, this Easter egg thing's enough to drive you nuts.

[02:46:59.680 --> 02:46:59.820]
Yeah.

[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:03.120]
So I just looked up Rikwing for a dream and there are two,

[02:47:03.620 --> 02:47:05.380]
and they both have to do with tabby tibans.

[02:47:06.220 --> 02:47:07.700]
You know, the host of the TV show.

[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:11.460]
Join us in creating excellence.

[02:47:11.460 --> 02:47:13.920]
And the first time I watched it, the first two times,

[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:15.360]
I never even realized what that stood for.

[02:47:15.580 --> 02:47:18.020]
It's just, join us in creating excellence.

[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:20.820]
But anyway, here's one of them.

[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:23.560]
On the main menu, press down on your remote,

[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.320]
which will highlight here, tap these amazing live story,

[02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:30.620]
press enter or play, and watch the TV show Sarah watches in the film.

[02:47:30.620 --> 02:47:32.100]
It's about five minutes long and pretty nifty.

[02:47:32.420 --> 02:47:32.800]
I don't like that.

[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:34.280]
I got to do that. I got to see that.

[02:47:34.500 --> 02:47:35.280]
I'm a good buy-it.

[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:38.020]
Well, you got to go to the website then.

[02:47:38.020 --> 02:47:39.820]
Because it'll, it's got it.

[02:47:39.980 --> 02:47:41.180]
But I don't understand why.

[02:47:42.240 --> 02:47:44.300]
Why would they make this an underground thing?

[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.140]
You're spending 20 or 30 or 40 bucks for a DVD.

[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:48.780]
Exactly.

[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:49.480]
You want to say something?

[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.540]
In other words, it's a little hidden treasure just to...

[02:47:52.540 --> 02:47:52.700]
Right.

[02:47:53.460 --> 02:47:55.040]
For computer nerds.

[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:55.300]
Right.

[02:47:55.780 --> 02:47:55.780]

[02:47:56.680 --> 02:47:57.560]
Tech nerds.

[02:47:57.860 --> 02:47:59.560]
Oh, I wonder if rules of attraction's got any.

[02:48:00.320 --> 02:48:01.820]
Since I'm on the list right now.

[02:48:02.380 --> 02:48:02.740]
Ah.

[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:04.320]
No.

[02:48:04.840 --> 02:48:06.320]
Good. That makes me feel better.

[02:48:07.540 --> 02:48:11.700]
But boy, there are just hundreds, all dozens and hundreds and millions of movies that do.

[02:48:11.980 --> 02:48:12.400]
So there you go.

[02:48:12.480 --> 02:48:13.780]
Look up, uh, Requiem for Dreamy.

[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:14.800]
You can find Tappy Tibans.

[02:48:16.280 --> 02:48:17.740]
And you actually see the TV show.

[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:22.880]
I wonder if that includes the part where he comes flying out of the TV.

[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.920]
And we're living room and they do the Kuzanski together, rounder.

[02:48:25.580 --> 02:48:27.460]
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, you know what I'm talking about?

[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:28.100]
Yeah.

[02:48:28.100 --> 02:48:31.640]
Five six, five six seven, oh five sixteen.

[02:48:32.040 --> 02:48:38.040]
As far as I'm concerned, anybody who refuses to watch that movie, who doesn't appreciate that movie, you know, you're just wasting space.

[02:48:38.900 --> 02:48:39.920]
You're wasting space.

[02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:43.560]
You're taking up space so that a worthwhile creature could be a user and an heir.

[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:46.220]
Here's a call from Kendall.

[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:46.540]
Hello.

[02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:47.820]
Hello, Dr..

[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:48.780]
Uh-huh.

[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:50.920]
Any idea how you've seen Train Spotted?

[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:52.780]
I, actually, they're out of it.

[02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:53.780]
They're, it's not in stock.

[02:48:54.540 --> 02:48:55.400]
The slide identity.

[02:48:56.560 --> 02:48:57.060]
Hey, what is it?

[02:48:57.060 --> 02:48:58.020]
What is it about?

[02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:00.680]
It's a drug movie over in Scotland.

[02:49:01.560 --> 02:49:03.500]
What, there's sure a lot of drug movies, man.

[02:49:04.720 --> 02:49:06.260]
And, uh, you and Rick Ruggers in it.

[02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:07.080]
Yeah.

[02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:10.000]
And, uh, can I get a, uh, quick request?

[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:10.960]
Maybe.

[02:49:11.440 --> 02:49:13.720]
Uh, the guy in full of you with the rugby and music?

[02:49:14.380 --> 02:49:17.440]
Oh, that's not much of a, that's just a short, like a little thing.

[02:49:17.580 --> 02:49:18.580]
I mean, this place.

[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:19.520]
Oh, I see.

[02:49:19.560 --> 02:49:20.320]
Nothing works here.

[02:49:20.500 --> 02:49:20.740]
Okay.

[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:22.380]
The medications don't work.

[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:24.500]
I've been here for seven years.

[02:49:25.140 --> 02:49:26.260]
Nothing works here.

[02:49:26.260 --> 02:49:27.840]
I hate this place.

[02:49:28.480 --> 02:49:29.700]
Nothing works here.

[02:49:30.180 --> 02:49:31.760]
The medications don't work.

[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:33.700]
I've been here for seven years.

[02:49:34.320 --> 02:49:35.460]
I hate this place.

[02:49:36.120 --> 02:49:37.320]
Nothing works here.

[02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:41.600]
See, I usually get hostile when, you know, the request, like, a whole bunch of different

[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:41.780]
stuff.

[02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:42.820]
But in that case, it worked out.

[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:43.300]
It fit.

[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:44.840]
And, if the food fits.

[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:50.680]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:53.920]
Thank God, I didn't have to go to the bedtime stories today, even though I got some real good

[02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:56.080]
ones, because we'd rather haven't go on our website, wouldn't we?

[02:49:56.520 --> 02:49:56.660]
Right.

[02:49:57.260 --> 02:49:58.320]
And read all of that good stuff.

[02:49:59.060 --> 02:50:01.980]
Like intelligence historians says, CIA buckled on Iraq.

[02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.520]
Groups decry US Justice Department, gay events ban.

[02:50:06.860 --> 02:50:08.420]
We don't want to say we got a bunch of fascists.

[02:50:08.720 --> 02:50:09.440]
Oh, I like this story.

[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:13.480]
Vigitory and parent charge amount of nutrition death a five month old in Miami.

[02:50:13.740 --> 02:50:14.220]
You saw that?

[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:14.740]
Mm-hmm.

[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:18.560]
Anyone about the cow is farting a lot and destroying the ozone layer?

[02:50:19.800 --> 02:50:23.520]
If you want to help the environment go and shove a cork up a cow's ass, okay?

[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:24.820]
You'll be doing a tremendous service.

[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:27.800]
Here's a call from Weston.

[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:28.020]
Hello.

[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:29.900]
Hello?

[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:30.780]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:31.140 --> 02:50:32.020]
Neil, hey, how you doing?

[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:32.640]
Great.

[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:33.540]
Are you good?

[02:50:34.540 --> 02:50:39.440]
I just want to know if you ever saw any movies by the screenwriter Charlie Kaufman or have you ever heard of them?

[02:50:39.740 --> 02:50:39.880]
No.

[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:40.600]
You ever seen any of this stuff?

[02:50:41.060 --> 02:50:46.320]
He did being John Malcovitch adaptation, which came out last year and won a couple Academy Awards.

[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:48.700]
That's supporting actor, I think.

[02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:51.220]
Have you ever heard of any of his stuff?

[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:51.940]
No.

[02:50:52.340 --> 02:50:54.320]
I mean, I've heard the names of the movies, but I never heard of him.

[02:50:55.060 --> 02:50:58.300]
I think he's pretty new, but he's been around.

[02:50:58.840 --> 02:50:59.840]
He's a great writer.

[02:51:00.220 --> 02:51:01.780]
I really think you should be adaptation.

[02:51:02.300 --> 02:51:03.280]
Great movie last year.

[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:04.380]
Nicholas Cage was in it.

[02:51:05.060 --> 02:51:08.920]
He played Charlie Kaufman and his Nick Believe Brother Donald Kaufman.

[02:51:09.540 --> 02:51:10.800]
It was a movie.

[02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:13.220]
His movies are movies about movies.

[02:51:14.440 --> 02:51:15.580]
It's just pretty interesting.

[02:51:16.440 --> 02:51:20.260]
Also, I wanted to know if you ever heard of the movie Dual from 1971?

[02:51:21.680 --> 02:51:22.040]
Yes.

[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:23.180]
It's a great movie.

[02:51:23.480 --> 02:51:24.400]
Do you know who directed that?

[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:27.520]
Who did?

[02:51:28.840 --> 02:51:29.560]
Steven Spielberg.

[02:51:29.840 --> 02:51:30.360]
That's right.

[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:31.980]
That is absolutely correct.

[02:51:32.120 --> 02:51:32.720]
That was a great movie.

[02:51:34.500 --> 02:51:35.220]
That's about it.

[02:51:35.480 --> 02:51:36.040]
Thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:39.400]
In fact, that movie is kind of like most of the driving you encounter in South Florida every day.

[02:51:41.040 --> 02:51:44.400]
I like the part where they got all these snakes in the cages.

[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:56.920]
In fact, in Requiem for Dream, when just before the cop comes in and discovers him after the guy from a happiness,

[02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:02.820]
the doctor takes a look at that arm, a hairy arm, and he grabs all the vials of whatever the stuff is there.

[02:52:03.200 --> 02:52:09.320]
And he walks out and then Damon Wands is sitting in the other room, cool, and his heels waiting.

[02:52:09.320 --> 02:52:13.800]
When the sheriff comes in and you look at the people who are sitting in that waiting room, right?

[02:52:14.700 --> 02:52:19.040]
And of course, keep in mind, he said, over 600 miles from New York, that means we got the halfway to go to Florida.

[02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:22.540]
That should pin put it on the map, kind of where they are.

[02:52:23.020 --> 02:52:24.020]
Hi there, the local.

[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:25.880]
This is Five Cities.

[02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:27.380]
The rain is all yours.

[02:52:29.320 --> 02:52:29.680]
QAM.

[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:34.380]
Oh, I don't know what it is about.

[02:52:34.380 --> 02:52:42.340]
I don't know why they little voices or their big noses, goofy hats, tiny little meckles.

[02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:45.360]
I don't know, they just rub me the wrong way.

[02:52:45.600 --> 02:52:50.820]
Anti-Semitism lifts in every speech of regpsits in the news.

[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:53.440]
Hillary hates Jews.

[02:52:54.880 --> 02:53:00.420]
Stewing hatred through the halls, busting people's mums of all sits in the news.

[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:03.320]
Hillary hates Jews.

[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:07.900]
You won't catch her like an amonora.

[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:12.680]
God, she must have a wonderful aura.

[02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:19.760]
One she speaks, I want a cry, she could use a good rap, I get to send the news.

[02:53:20.460 --> 02:53:22.280]
Boy, Hillary hates Jews.

[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:31.100]
What kind of day is this from a collective?

[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:33.620]
The best chance, again, elected.

[02:53:34.020 --> 02:53:36.420]
You've married 16 years and never cheated.

[02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:37.700]
What kind of day?

[02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:39.740]
You're not going to be defeated with your help.

[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:40.880]
I know you should win.

[02:53:40.880 --> 02:53:42.560]
So vote for Hillary.

[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:43.340]
Hillary.

[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:44.540]
Hillary Clinton.

[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:46.120]
She's got the guts.

[02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:47.380]
She's stand by her man.

[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:48.900]
She can't do it.

[02:53:49.200 --> 02:53:49.980]
No one can.

[02:53:50.260 --> 02:53:50.980]
She's blind.

[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:55.620]
And a lawyer do just think the bar the laws she'll push through.

[02:53:55.900 --> 02:53:57.720]
Get out that bow and ride in.

[02:53:58.660 --> 02:53:59.220]
For Hillary.

[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:00.020]
Hillary.

[02:54:00.380 --> 02:54:00.640]
Hillary.

[02:54:00.980 --> 02:54:01.340]
Hillary Clinton.

[02:54:01.860 --> 02:54:03.880]
Her mate's a goldfish, that's true.

[02:54:04.220 --> 02:54:06.980]
But he ain't the nothing that poor child to try it on you.

[02:54:07.580 --> 02:54:08.160]
You're the kind of day.

[02:54:08.160 --> 02:54:11.940]
The finals he made, but are not high to find as Hillary.

[02:54:12.560 --> 02:54:14.360]
But early vote offence.

[02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:15.840]
For Hillary.

[02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:16.680]
Hillary.

[02:54:17.060 --> 02:54:17.480]
Hillary.

[02:54:17.700 --> 02:54:17.980]
Clinton.

[02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:20.700]
She's got the great political wise of history.

[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:22.280]
The WAP China husband.

[02:54:22.560 --> 02:54:23.440]
Just like Hillary.

[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.340]
A meld and clear patch up.

[02:54:25.540 --> 02:54:27.780]
And even for over next to Hillary Clinton.

[02:54:28.420 --> 02:54:29.280]
They're all outshown.

[02:54:30.080 --> 02:54:31.420]
But early vote offence.

[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:32.840]
Hillary.

[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:33.720]
Hillary.

[02:54:34.240 --> 02:54:34.520]
Hillary.

[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:34.860]

[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:35.220]
Clinton.

[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:38.920]
Hillary.

[02:54:39.300 --> 02:54:39.580]
Hillary.

[02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:39.760]

[02:54:39.900 --> 02:54:40.020]
Hillary.

[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:40.020]

[02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:40.980]
She's our guy.

[02:54:41.660 --> 02:54:43.400]
The greatest day of Arkansas.

[02:54:43.760 --> 02:54:45.320]
She looks like she got offence.

[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:46.400]
And a bell-a-law.

[02:54:46.640 --> 02:54:48.760]
And that's totally cool by me.

[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:50.580]
To vote for Hillary.

[02:54:51.240 --> 02:54:51.600]
Hillary.

[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:52.600]
Hillary.

[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:53.160]
Clinton.

[02:54:53.940 --> 02:54:54.380]
All right.

[02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:55.500]
Hillary for president.

[02:54:55.700 --> 02:54:56.160]
And January.

[02:54:56.500 --> 02:54:57.020]
For B.P.

[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:58.220]
Can you see that?

[02:54:58.820 --> 02:54:59.020]
No.

[02:54:59.420 --> 02:54:59.580]
Forward.

[02:54:59.740 --> 02:55:01.320]
The two of them kicks them answer what, huh?

[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:03.600]
145 at 560.

[02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:06.440]
And we can also get Donna Shalela back in the cabinet again.

[02:55:06.440 --> 02:55:08.760]
You know, Austin Powers eat your heart out.

[02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:11.440]
He thought he was big time with many me.

[02:55:11.500 --> 02:55:14.180]
Well, we've got many mozo on our website.

[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:19.680]
Now, where people really have a difficulty in watching the big mozo.

[02:55:20.460 --> 02:55:21.240]
I don't know.

[02:55:21.420 --> 02:55:22.240]
We were having calls at the beginning.

[02:55:22.240 --> 02:55:23.620]
I don't know if it's calm down.

[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:24.800]
But just in case.

[02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:29.820]
Because now in case you can't, your computers having difficulty in deciphering big mozo.

[02:55:30.100 --> 02:55:33.260]
We've got many mozo for those of you having problems with big mozo.

[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:38.100]
And then of course, don't forget to scroll beneath that when you see yours truly.

[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:39.420]
And mo as to as.

[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:40.480]
That's a lovely thing.

[02:55:40.620 --> 02:55:41.500]
Eat your heart out, Jennifer.

[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:45.080]
Oh, I noticed that there's one thing.

[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:46.520]
And not that I want to see it.

[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:48.340]
There is one thing missing in that ass west picture.

[02:55:49.940 --> 02:55:52.520]
Oh, let me give you a clue.

[02:55:53.080 --> 02:55:54.240]
Yeah, let me give it a clue.

[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:56.620]
Now, I'll leave it up to your artistic abilities.

[02:55:57.640 --> 02:55:58.360]
See what I can do.

[02:55:58.700 --> 02:55:59.880]
See what you can work out.

[02:56:00.020 --> 02:56:00.960]
How about a submarine sandwich?

[02:56:01.060 --> 02:56:01.800]
Although I will say this.

[02:56:01.800 --> 02:56:02.820]
I don't give clearance to my ideas.

[02:56:03.620 --> 02:56:04.640]
Here is a Lakeworth.

[02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:04.880]
Hello.

[02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:05.820]
Hello.

[02:56:06.000 --> 02:56:08.060]
I just went to the mailbox and you ever heard a Netflix?

[02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:08.940]
Yeah.

[02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:13.060]
I got my copy in the mail at the level of the old NFC 17 rating on a WECLIM.

[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:16.580]
And every time you see a screen mission on there, it's got to be probably good.

[02:56:17.380 --> 02:56:17.640]
Mm-hmm.

[02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:19.000]
You've ordered a screen mission part.

[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:19.600]
Yeah.

[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:22.820]
Well, I haven't heard that doctor's in there from happiness because he was quite interesting in that happiness.

[02:56:22.980 --> 02:56:23.400]
And that being, he was.

[02:56:24.000 --> 02:56:25.860]
He had a few problems, Ryan.

[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:27.140]
Yeah, it was really fun.

[02:56:27.140 --> 02:56:30.320]
But he also used to, the E-throwing thing is on Netflix too.

[02:56:30.460 --> 02:56:31.540]
They can go take some on there too.

[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:32.220]
Oh, really?

[02:56:32.720 --> 02:56:36.060]
Yeah, if you go on the Netflix, it's at the E-throwing, way bottom on the left.

[02:56:36.460 --> 02:56:42.260]
Because you get the feeling it's almost supposed to be like a secret that only the computer nerd types are supposed to know about it.

[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:43.100]
Nick more money.

[02:56:44.520 --> 02:56:45.720]
How do they make more money?

[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:46.960]
People will buy him just for that.

[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:47.440]
Freaks.

[02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:49.000]
Oh, I see. Yeah, good point.

[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:50.440]
Okay, thanks, Polly. Enjoy it.

[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:54.540]
Yeah, there are Easter eggs, not just in movies, but also in computers.

[02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:56.580]
There is a whole list when you go to the eX.com.

[02:56:56.680 --> 02:56:57.100]
Did you see it?

[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:57.280]
Yep.

[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.300]
And there's Easter eggs under your bed all over the place.

[02:57:02.380 --> 02:57:02.960]
I didn't even know.

[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:06.140]
In fact, Clarence said he had a couple under his one under each armpit.

[02:57:08.020 --> 02:57:13.220]
And when it comes in tomorrow, which is payday, he's going to see if, if a Venerable wants to get his looks or not.

[02:57:15.300 --> 02:57:18.540]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon line.

[02:57:18.800 --> 02:57:19.740]
Here's Parkland. Hello.

[02:57:20.940 --> 02:57:21.300]
Parkland?

[02:57:21.660 --> 02:57:22.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:57:22.580 --> 02:57:23.440]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:23.920]
Great.

[02:57:24.780 --> 02:57:25.620]
The IMDB.

[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:32.640]
Instead of searching and scrolling through movies, if you know the name of two actors that have appeared in it,

[02:57:32.960 --> 02:57:37.260]
you can search by the two actors and it will pull up all the movies they appeared in together.

[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:38.120]
Really?

[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:41.320]
Yeah, cut down your search time having to scroll and scroll and scroll.

[02:57:41.320 --> 02:57:43.460]
I mean, like Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, for example.

[02:57:43.940 --> 02:57:49.760]
Type their names together and the search thing and it'll come up with all the movies they've had anything to do with, produced, directed, starred in whatever.

[02:57:50.240 --> 02:57:50.720]
I'll be damned.

[02:57:51.500 --> 02:57:52.380]
Maybe a lot of time.

[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:53.560]
Okay, thanks.

[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:54.460]
Thank you.

[02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:55.620]
Have a good day.

[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:58.480]
Yeah, the top 350 movies is loaded by our users.

[02:57:58.500 --> 02:57:59.480]
Now we're only going to read what?

[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:00.620]
The top 175th.

[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:01.920]
Now, just to give you an idea.

[02:58:02.920 --> 02:58:03.900]
The Godfather's number one.

[02:58:03.960 --> 02:58:04.620]
How do you like that?

[02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:05.900]
We're very pleased with that.

[02:58:06.020 --> 02:58:07.200]
The Godfather's number one.

[02:58:07.260 --> 02:58:09.460]
The Bing-Your-Blood-Ebrans-O-L-O-V-E-N-I-S-I-Releaf-Soo.

[02:58:09.500 --> 02:58:09.700]
Right.

[02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:10.820]
Oh, I love that.

[02:58:11.020 --> 02:58:13.320]
The Bing-Your-Blood-Ebrans-O-L-O-V-E-N-I-S-I-Releaf-Soo.

[02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:16.720]
Charge-Hank Redemption's number two, which everybody raves about how great it is.

[02:58:17.300 --> 02:58:18.460]
Why more than I watch it?

[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:23.360]
Because Jason, who used to work in our sports department, and finally graduated and grew up and got out of there,

[02:58:24.040 --> 02:58:27.160]
he gave me the tape of that, which I still have somewhere, and he's never going to get back.

[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:28.680]
I think you just hate Morgan Freeman.

[02:58:30.200 --> 02:58:31.780]
Oh, I thought Denzel Washington was in it.

[02:58:32.840 --> 02:58:34.460]
No, I like Morgan Freeman a lot.

[02:58:34.700 --> 02:58:35.480]
He's a great actor.

[02:58:35.720 --> 02:58:37.240]
Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman, a cast.

[02:58:37.320 --> 02:58:38.240]
Tim Robbins is great.

[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:39.860]
Oh, I don't want to forget.

[02:58:40.040 --> 02:58:43.380]
This month, this is the month that Tim Robbins movie is coming out on the DVD.

[02:58:43.660 --> 02:58:44.260]
Now, what else in it?

[02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:44.920]
And also, Ed Wood.

[02:58:45.800 --> 02:58:46.940]
What's the Tim Robbins movie?

[02:58:49.240 --> 02:58:52.560]
You know what I'm talking about where he gets elected president, or he's running for...

[02:58:52.560 --> 02:58:53.400]
You know the one who...

[02:58:53.400 --> 02:58:54.060]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:58:54.440 --> 02:58:55.380]
What is the name of that?

[02:58:55.780 --> 02:58:57.560]
Oh, am I going to have to go online and check that out?

[02:58:57.660 --> 02:58:59.680]
This is enough to drive you crazy, man.

[02:58:59.820 --> 02:59:02.820]
It's enough to, like, have you went to the Tushin Line to get shot therapy?

[02:59:06.340 --> 02:59:08.960]
Oh, I will say this, Sarah's hair was a lot neater at the end.

[02:59:10.980 --> 02:59:12.320]
Neat as an interesting number.

[02:59:13.040 --> 02:59:13.420]
Neat as high.

[02:59:13.640 --> 02:59:14.960]
Neat, neat, and more ways than one thing.

[02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:18.220]
Tight and white.

[02:59:18.720 --> 02:59:20.440]
At least you got rid of that orange.

[02:59:21.920 --> 02:59:23.780]
A Godfather Part II was number three.

[02:59:23.940 --> 02:59:27.240]
So you got two Godfathers in the top three, and I think that's sensational.

[02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:28.440]
I think that's excellent.

[02:59:28.900 --> 02:59:30.220]
I know where you trade off.

[02:59:30.900 --> 02:59:31.700]
You broke my heart.

[02:59:31.980 --> 02:59:33.960]
Lord of the Rings, you broke my heart.

[02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:34.580]
Shut up.

[02:59:35.520 --> 02:59:36.720]
Lord of the Rings number four.

[02:59:36.840 --> 02:59:38.660]
Shindler's List Five, another one of those...

[02:59:38.660 --> 02:59:39.780]
Some sort of a Jew movies.

[02:59:39.940 --> 02:59:40.960]
I won't watch that stuff.

[02:59:41.060 --> 02:59:41.740]
It's excellent.

[02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:42.860]
It's Godfather Good.

[02:59:43.880 --> 02:59:45.380]
Shindler's List is Godfather Good.

[02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:45.720]
Yes.

[02:59:46.180 --> 02:59:48.140]
Are you, have you lost your census?

[02:59:48.440 --> 02:59:49.400]
Well, I can say that.

[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:50.680]
It's about the Holocaust.

[02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:53.460]
It's about Shindler and the century.

[02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:55.860]
Oh, you see the thing about when Bush, a few days ago, was it Auschwitz?

[02:59:57.420 --> 02:59:57.880]
I don't know.

[02:59:58.060 --> 02:59:59.060]
Do you see those clips on the news?

[02:59:59.400 --> 02:59:59.620]
No.

[02:59:59.960 --> 03:00:01.580]
And he had a tear in his eye and he was probably thinking,

[03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:03.420]
gee, how come he let so many get away?

[03:00:04.940 --> 03:00:06.620]
That must have been what was crossing his mind.

[03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:07.880]
He wasn't crying for the victims.

[03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:11.240]
It has a blank in number six.

[03:00:11.740 --> 03:00:12.760]
Citizen Kane Seven.

[03:00:13.080 --> 03:00:14.820]
Now, see, that's got a bother with that it's in there,

[03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:15.960]
but at least it's not number one.

[03:00:16.020 --> 03:00:16.940]
Like so many of these lists.

[03:00:17.240 --> 03:00:18.280]
These only single intellectual lists.

[03:00:19.060 --> 03:00:19.760]
Then there's one.

[03:00:19.980 --> 03:00:21.680]
I don't think I can say this on the air.

[03:00:22.540 --> 03:00:23.340]
Shichin and here.

[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:23.640]
No.

[03:00:24.160 --> 03:00:26.000]
Well, that's a Japanese thing.

[03:00:26.140 --> 03:00:26.860]
I don't think so.

[03:00:26.980 --> 03:00:27.340]
No.

[03:00:27.940 --> 03:00:29.180]
Shichin and no samurai.

[03:00:30.280 --> 03:00:31.500]
If you do, you'll clean it up.

[03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:33.080]
That's number eight.

[03:00:33.200 --> 03:00:35.040]
That's the eighth best movie of all time, Cornuwa.

[03:00:35.060 --> 03:00:35.780]
I am a DB.

[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:37.840]
Star Wars 9.

[03:00:38.640 --> 03:00:39.560]
Dr. Strangelove 10.

[03:00:40.040 --> 03:00:40.680]
Kukuuznest 11.

[03:00:41.260 --> 03:00:42.060]
Memento No. 12.

[03:00:42.380 --> 03:00:43.160]
And we're window 13.

[03:00:43.740 --> 03:00:45.300]
Bob Roberts, I think, is the movie worth thinking about.

[03:00:45.300 --> 03:00:46.240]
Ah, thank you very much.

[03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:47.700]
But let me write it down to make sure.

[03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:49.260]
Bob Roberts and Ed Wood.

[03:00:49.840 --> 03:00:50.760]
I knew both of them.

[03:00:51.700 --> 03:00:52.140]
Bob Roberts.

[03:00:52.280 --> 03:00:54.040]
Isn't this funny that two of the movies I'm just dying to get

[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:55.300]
are both like names of guys?

[03:00:56.080 --> 03:00:56.400]
Just that.

[03:00:56.440 --> 03:00:57.500]
I saw a little bit of Bob Roberts.

[03:00:57.620 --> 03:00:58.840]
Just the ass end of it with Tim Roberts.

[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:01.120]
And Susan Sarandon also was in it, isn't she?

[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:03.280]
Check it.

[03:01:03.700 --> 03:01:05.880]
Back when they were having the big flamp about that.

[03:01:06.520 --> 03:01:08.760]
Because of the fact that, ah, you remember all of that stuff.

[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:10.400]
Wow, if you're against the war, you're run American.

[03:01:10.760 --> 03:01:13.180]
That was with the major league baseball hall of fame and coopers down.

[03:01:13.240 --> 03:01:13.680]
Remember that crap?

[03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:14.500]
Ah, assholes.

[03:01:15.260 --> 03:01:17.540]
Because if you're a sports nerd, you have to be right wing.

[03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:20.160]
I mean, if it's, uh, then let's say that we're in the Constitution, I believe.

[03:01:20.300 --> 03:01:20.700]
Oh, yeah.

[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:22.840]
My name's Daniel Law.

[03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:25.080]
We're sports radio fighters.

[03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:26.900]
U-A-M.

[03:01:28.580 --> 03:01:29.140]
Two-pack.

[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:35.360]
They just increased us to higher alert status.

[03:01:35.500 --> 03:01:38.480]
Hope no one blows up my brand new Dodge Travis.

[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:41.140]
I bid a Rex's they gave us the news.

[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:44.960]
Popping value with a big glass of booze.

[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:50.900]
I keep a gas mask in my glove compartment.

[03:01:51.440 --> 03:01:54.060]
I called Remax for a bomb roof apartment.

[03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:57.340]
Reinforce my front door with senior blocks.

[03:01:57.340 --> 03:02:00.380]
Wonder if that will keep up the smallpox.

[03:02:02.200 --> 03:02:05.200]
Checking my mail for that deadly white powder.

[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:08.460]
Stalking my covers with cables clamped shouder.

[03:02:08.720 --> 03:02:11.360]
Living on orange alerts, you're ain't no fun.

[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:14.560]
I think the terror is already one.

[03:02:15.300 --> 03:02:16.560]
I can't take it.

[03:02:16.900 --> 03:02:18.260]
I won't make it.

[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:20.160]
If it goes to red.

[03:02:20.600 --> 03:02:21.040]
Oi.

[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:24.080]
I'll pull the covers up over my head.

[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:25.560]
And she'll stay in bed.

[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:29.800]
I wish I would.

[03:02:30.540 --> 03:02:32.940]
157 at 560 WQAM.

[03:02:33.620 --> 03:02:35.080]
Got a lot of votes on the polls.

[03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:36.480]
A very weak poll question today.

[03:02:36.660 --> 03:02:37.640]
But what can I tell you?

[03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:39.120]
741 votes.

[03:02:39.980 --> 03:02:41.600]
Who do you trust the most?

[03:02:41.780 --> 03:02:42.800]
Myself 212.

[03:02:43.480 --> 03:02:45.500]
I trust nobody 149.

[03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.600]
My spouse 148.

[03:02:48.200 --> 03:02:49.220]
My parents 108.

[03:02:49.900 --> 03:02:51.020]
Neal Rogers 57.

[03:02:51.020 --> 03:02:53.020]
My best friend or friend 28.

[03:02:53.820 --> 03:02:55.180]
George W. Bush 24.

[03:02:55.380 --> 03:02:56.780]
Oh my god.

[03:02:56.920 --> 03:02:58.240]
3.2%.

[03:02:58.240 --> 03:02:59.260]
You silly people.

[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:00.800]
Moe Howard David 11.

[03:03:02.320 --> 03:03:05.480]
And my priest rabbi or minister only 4.

[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:08.440]
Out of 741 votes only 4.

[03:03:09.220 --> 03:03:11.500]
Trust their rabbi priest or minister the most.

[03:03:12.620 --> 03:03:13.780]
Here's open park.

[03:03:13.780 --> 03:03:14.040]
Hello.

[03:03:15.180 --> 03:03:16.020]
Yes sir.

[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:18.240]
I wanted to chime in on your program.

[03:03:19.980 --> 03:03:24.080]
You want to hog the program.

[03:03:24.100 --> 03:03:25.820]
You want your own god damn show.

[03:03:25.960 --> 03:03:29.180]
Why not get up like 4.30 in the morning and you can come in and get on the moe show.

[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:30.800]
Okay you maniac you.

[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:34.060]
You lunatic over and over and over again.

[03:03:35.080 --> 03:03:39.680]
All you got to do is give him like one mention the tiniest bit of encouragement like your constantly doing George.

[03:03:40.620 --> 03:03:41.500]
Oh no.

[03:03:42.900 --> 03:03:43.780]
Woo man.

[03:03:44.960 --> 03:03:46.440]
Talk about a fruit cake.

[03:03:48.600 --> 03:03:50.960]
Now see when a call from Miami's online 9.

[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:52.360]
I always have to raise 2 eyebrows.

[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:53.040]
That's Maui.

[03:03:53.540 --> 03:03:54.100]
It's what?

[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:56.300]
Oh Maui I thought it said Miami.

[03:03:56.640 --> 03:03:57.500]
Here's Maui. Hello.

[03:03:57.880 --> 03:03:59.600]
No I'm in a real beach now.

[03:04:00.200 --> 03:04:00.200]

[03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:02.900]
Well I'll be doing.

[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:05.760]
Well you sure getting around.

[03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:10.520]
Well I already went through New Zealand and I'm hitting Maui a couple of days and I'm home I'll be home next week.

[03:04:10.680 --> 03:04:12.480]
But it's just been on my mind George.

[03:04:12.480 --> 03:04:14.760]
Why did you want to know about the Haka?

[03:04:14.980 --> 03:04:17.740]
Hey that Polynesian site you told me about they got nothing.

[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:19.920]
Nothing I wanted.

[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:23.520]
Did my friend RJ contact you because he's from Maui New Zealand or I could do that.

[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:26.340]
This sounds like a personal George call for like off the hour.

[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:27.260]
What are we going to do?

[03:04:27.260 --> 03:04:28.740]
George was asking about the Haka.

[03:04:28.940 --> 03:04:30.940]
I mean I know George knows nothing about rugby.

[03:04:31.160 --> 03:04:31.660]
He's none of that.

[03:04:31.700 --> 03:04:33.260]
No but I saw them do the Haka.

[03:04:33.400 --> 03:04:34.440]
I saw the rugby team do the Haka.

[03:04:34.740 --> 03:04:35.680]
I want Haka videos.

[03:04:36.580 --> 03:04:37.600]
Do the Haka?

[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:43.580]
The Haka is a native New Zealand Maui war dance that the Rug, the National Rug.

[03:04:43.680 --> 03:04:45.920]
Strangest thing you'll ever see if you live to be a thousand.

[03:04:46.180 --> 03:04:46.420]
Really?

[03:04:46.820 --> 03:04:50.840]
But they always do it before they play the Real National matches against any other team.

[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:52.280]
And it's the real thing.

[03:04:52.500 --> 03:04:54.020]
It's a New Zealand Maui war.

[03:04:54.020 --> 03:04:56.440]
It's something to see but you can't get a bit.

[03:04:56.500 --> 03:04:59.980]
I want a full blown Haka on a video by anyone.

[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:02.100]
Traditional dress, the rugby team anybody.

[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:03.880]
George I will find it for you.

[03:05:03.880 --> 03:05:07.240]
I hear they're going to have one on the iron shaft as weekend is what I'm hearing.

[03:05:07.460 --> 03:05:08.940]
Okay listen I have a safe trip back Pali.

[03:05:09.020 --> 03:05:09.580]
I'll talk to you later.

[03:05:09.700 --> 03:05:10.020]
Thanks.

[03:05:10.540 --> 03:05:11.760]
What the hell was that all about?

[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:12.160]
Haka.

[03:05:14.460 --> 03:05:17.720]
Okay we got the mad dog Jim Mandage 2-4 this afternoon.

[03:05:17.840 --> 03:05:20.940]
The Humper is back at town at Chula's 4-7 this afternoon.

[03:05:21.020 --> 03:05:21.920]
Bye bye bye!

[03:05:26.960 --> 03:05:28.040]
Hey it's Howard.

[03:05:28.500 --> 03:05:29.320]
Howard David.
