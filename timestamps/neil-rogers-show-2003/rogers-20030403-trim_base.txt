[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]
I'm gonna start with this before anything else got yesterday's pull which by the way

[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.880]
We got freaked on the pool big time, but I got it right down to a science okay

[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.740]
You're not fooling us whoever was dicking with our pool got it down to a science

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.700]
That's amazing

[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.840]
I know exactly the right numbers on there and I hate to break the news to you

[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.300]
But I was number three on there behind Phil and the molemeister, but we'll get to that

[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.880]

[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.980]
My love you show a friend of mine turned me out to you a couple years ago

[00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.720]
I called in but I wanted to say that

[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.280]
I love when you knock on the here he is a guy who talks sports talks like he knows it all

[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.920]
Yeah, if you haven't played anything that's elementary basketball with himself

[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.060]
And probably

[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.160]
When you knock on the only knockin poor guilty for okay the guys try to eke out a living

[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.240]
Yeah

[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.200]
I can't go squeaky little guilty

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.980]
He's got he's got to work with that

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.960]
Yeah, but to be honest for a minute today

[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.260]
He's got to work with that here walking there every day, you know, he's under a lot of pressure this kid

[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.880]
And then the hump for that fat you know what?

[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.000]
Yeah, okay, maybe I like our whole line up here QA thank you

[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.320]
Well, I wanted I wanted to get a good happy call on there right away

[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.000]
I can't hear it anyway, so Vegas. Oh, he's not even on today

[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.140]
We got a Marlins afternoon game. Wow. Oh, and it said 10,000 in some for that game last night

[00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.780]
And I I did a spy thing on TV there there was no 10,000 people and

[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.980]
Announced crowd even in a paper it said and announced cry. There was a smattering a couple here a few there

[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.780]
I just mentioned that in passing since every every activity in this town they pad the crowds big time

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.940]
If you're very sensitive plug your ears or turn it off for like 30 seconds. You don't want to hear this story and

[00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.040]
Be sure and turn back

[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.560]
And a raki mother in a van fired on by US soldiers say she saw her two young daughters

[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.260]
Decapitated in the incident that also saw her son and eight other members of her family killed

[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:08.000]
The children's father who was also in the van said US soldiers fired on them as they fled toward the checkpoint because they thought a leaflet dropped by US helicopters

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.120]
Told them to be safe and they believed that meant getting out of their village to Carbala

[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.260]
Bokkat Hassan who lost his daughters aged two and five and three year old son his parents two older brothers

[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.740]
Their wives and two nieces ages 12 and 15 in the incident said US soldiers and an earlier checkpoint had waved them through

[00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.140]
As they approached another checkpoint 40 kilometers south of Carbala they waved again at the American soldiers

[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.480]
We were thinking these Americans want us to be safe Hassan said to an army translator and a mobile army surgical hospital set up

[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.940]
At a vast army support camp near Najef the soldiers didn't wave back. They fired

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.240]
I saw the heads of my two little girls come off Hassan's heavily pregnant wife Lamia 36 said Namli

[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.800]
She repeated herself in a flat even voice my girls. I watched their heads come off their bodies. My son is dead

[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.740]
US officials originally gave the death toll from the incident is seven

[00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:05.700]
But reporters at the scene placed at a 10 and for Bokkat Hassan the terrible toll was 11 members of his family his father died at the army hospital later

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.360]
I just mentioned that in passing, okay for the asshole and everybody else who called guilty this morning

[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.880]
Well, you know, it's you know their anti-military between nine and one. It's not politically correct to be for the troops

[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.780]
War for the troops were for like human life on a show, okay?

[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.420]
We're for everybody coming back safe

[00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.720]
By the way Jessica's okay, which is why the market went zooming up yesterday Jessica Simpson Jessica whatever name is Lynch

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.500]
I'm never gonna watch channel four news again. I will never ever that's a promise

[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.100]
I know I've said it before but I'm done with you people a channel for you're crazy people

[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.700]
Not only are they like in a feeding frenzy if we want to know what's happening with the war space and we see president

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.400]
Bush, well, there you go. There's John Siggand thawler. We got all the talking news head

[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.060]
We got the national network news. We don't need to have the local newscast pretending they have their own little war of the middle

[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.400]
Did you see that yeah? Oh my god, I know what the angel array comes on who's probably the silliest person who's ever been on a year

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.200]
Anywhere in the history of the human race and she does the Jessica piece and she come to cause Jessica the plane was landing in Germany

[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.180]
Which they all were just filming at the mouth well there's like her foot or there's like some body part

[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.900]
We can't really see her. She's on the stretcher there, but there she is and then after they finish with that

[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.260]
She comes out and does about a 60 second puff piece in which she said everything but you go girl

[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.520]
I mean every about how a brave she was and about how what a role model

[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.960]
She was it was not a news story. It was a commentary. We're not seeing news anymore in America

[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.120]
We're seeing running commentaries in fact even this operation a raki freedom

[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.200]
What what the hell is that

[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.900]
Operation Iraqi freedom what a wonderful glorious way to call it invasion

[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.760]
Operation Iraqi freedom freedom by a liberation by a elimination the four previous crusades were also

[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.560]
Deliberate the holy land from the I see yeah the crusades don't use that word again. The president doesn't have a pissed off

[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.340]
Bad news by the way right off the bat before we get to our poll and the real results which you won't see on the website

[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.140]
Somebody's dead

[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.880]
And you know you realize how appropriate this is that fits right in

[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.080]
So legend Edwin star has died

[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.820]
The US born star known for his war and the contact in 25 miles hits is thought to have died of a heart attack

[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:29.680]
Starla for many years in the UK and added to summon the Midlands has managed her legal alien call set Suzy Quattro is known star since

Stars continue to be a live favorite at soul week enders he performed a pair of shows in stuttgart, Germany over the weekend

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.800]
How do you like that Edwin star is dead and what was us for that you know that's bad news

[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.020]
Hate to start with that story about the end of the woman watching her two girls having her heads blown off and all the rest of 11 family members dead

[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.860]
Oh, no, you're wrong. Yeah, you're absolutely wrong. You should see the facts

[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.260]
I got this morning when I came in but a lot of busy people out there including the people creeping our poll

I'm gonna sit here and give my opinion while it's still allowable which should borderline now the where things are going in this country right on the edge

[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.600]
Anyway, here's the results yesterday's poll the real ones

[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.160]
Which broadcast has been most disappointing to you on a more in a racket?

[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.220]

[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.340]

Broadcaster most disappointed you on the war Phil Henry 277 Mohaward David 207

[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.180]
Neil Rogers the real number should be 203

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.200]
Or 207 I'm sir. Well, maybe a little less than that there were a hundred phony votes almost exactly

[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:19.680]
Between six and eight this morning coming in in chunks in bunches. I wonder where they came from Georgia

Bill O'Reilly 54 Dr. Laura 30 Randy Rhodes 24

[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.820]
Wow, and Mr. Ego Steve came only 17 and the reason that Randy and Mr. Ego got so few votes of course is because they have so few listeners

[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.600]
Sorry Randy, but that's just

[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.120]
Way goes right?

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.920]
And it will

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.100]
You don't have any listeners you're not gonna get too many votes

[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:57.060]
Anyway, here's our first poll. We're doing a two a prong poll today. We got two prongs. You ready? All right poll number one

Four choices. I don't know what else you listen to the choices. Maybe I'll let something out. I don't think so

[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.100]
I love it. It's okay. Keep it. It's weak. Get rid of it or I hate it

[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.060]
I think I covered all just in four short choices there from a disease. Do I?

[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.100]

That's the way they all became the crazy bunch

[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:25.880]

[00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.560]
Pull this morning he there didn't get it or he lost or maybe he ate it

Which is one of those will build it during the show kind of polls about phrases and expressions that bug the crap out of you

[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.020]
You get my drift

[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:54.720]
Anyway great cartoon in a heraldous morning, which you'll see on our website today along with a lot of really great bedtime stories

[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.640]

You know if we didn't see 55 hours on that on every channel yesterday

[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:16.480]
We didn't see 55 seconds and I'm delighted for her and for her family

[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.460]
It's said of and so on and although they say she's safe and sound

[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.260]
Now sound is an interesting term because she's got two broken legs a broken arm and a couple of bull holes in her body

[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.620]
She's gonna be okay, but safe and sound I find to be a little bit of exaggeration number one and number two

[00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:31.680]
Why are we hearing nothing?

[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.240]
About the 11 bodies that they found in the same hospital who appear to be American soldiers right?

[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:39.360]
Why are we hearing anything about them? I see

[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.180]
So this continues to be a video game war on TV

[00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:49.040]
propaganda from all the news media who are just go stepping in line and so yesterday's pull

[00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:55.880]
I mean, I looked on Phil Henry's website for the first time in about a year and a half today and he is with the Uncle Sam outfit

[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:01.200]
Standing in front of an American flag you talk about a complete sellout are you sure?

[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]
I'm positive

[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.080]
Yeah, is that the role of us in a media where supposed to be cheerleaders at the very least okay

[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.500]
Just go back to being an entertainer in your case, okay?

[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.200]
Just be an entertainer

[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.820]
I mean, I'm thinking back to those couple of years we worked together i.o.d

[00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:19.000]
Right there any period of time that I missed at that moment he was like a

[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:25.120]
Uh, did social commentary we wouldn't we would have beers we would sit on the picnic table and smoke and

[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.740]
drink beer and and and chat there was no hint of this of anything like

[00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.240]
Where did this come from maybe he was sent to the clear channel indoctrination in our college?

[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.320]
Maybe they cut him a check

[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:39.180]
Maybe they like tattooed him on the arm or something a cheap channel

[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:44.820]
I don't know what it's all about but but the uh the fact is that most of the media yada kiss your radio, okay?

[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.300]
I don't want to pat ourselves on a back here

[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.920]
But yada kissed the radio that at least even if you don't agree at least

[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.860]
There's still a variety of opinion available as opposed to just the company the government line

[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.580]
And all this crap with these embedded reporters and all this news uh all this propaganda passed off as news

[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.220]
It anyway the editorial cartoon in the herald by moron is great as usual

[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.560]
It shows heraldo with that silly mustache and a big smile on his face holding up a little map of a rack with a

[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.020]
diagram and an ex-its as we are here

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:21.540]
And of boring a button that says i'm heraldo and you're not with a stupor fight american soldier standing next to him

[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:29.540]
And in the background it says fox news and it would originally say that we report you decide but they've blacked out the EC and the

[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.700]
Second D in the side so it says we report you die

[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.900]
As heraldo stands there tipping off the goods here we are

[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.700]
You know check the latest american troop positions. Here's herald just like that bit we got

[00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:45.800]
You know let's check they let's turn on CNN. Oh, let's check Fox news. Maybe heraldo will be on there

[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.720]
So we can check the latest american troop positions

[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.260]
What an irony that is you know

[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.260]
While there's screaming in the air and about how unpaid triadica want to trade her peter our net is and here's heraldo

[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:57.700]
Given away the location

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:02.040]
Many many interesting letters in a heralded a by the way

[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.640]
Some of which couple of which support the war more a more don't

[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.020]
For example

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.000]
Flora Levin and curl gables writes three march 28th letter writers protesting the protest

[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.120]
I read them on a year here

[00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:21.080]
Wishes to suspend our constitutional writer freedom of speech they seem to think that doing so as a display of patriotism

[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:28.660]
True patriotism isn't restricting protest or speech flying the flag on car windows or changing the name of french toast to freedom toast

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.600]
True patriotism is being informed and consistent voter for those who haven't

[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.060]
Who have proven integrity and ability not because they're of our ethnic groups sex color or religion

[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:41.000]
Too many patriotic americans seem to think that voting isn't important anymore

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.920]
The letter writer seem to have forgotten that they live in america and informed amerikan as the right to

[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.680]
Question the actions of our government and still can have compassionate support for our troops

[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.880]
What a great letter by flora and the gables nice going flora also

[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.780]
David and my me springs writes

[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.460]
The opponents of protesting may find this hard to believe but the great majority of those who opposed the war

[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:06.020]
Also support the individual troops if not the government that put them in harm's way and hope that they all come home safely

[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.060]
To which we say amen on this program

[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.940]
David says perhaps those who would stifle descent should reconsider what life would be without it

[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:18.000]
Specifically think about what life is like in Cuba for those in opposition to the government

[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:24.240]
Gives you a different perspective on descent doesn't it says David and my me springs and there's a whole bunch of these letters. We'll read some of them

[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.040]
Okay, we got that pull up there like I told you erica's right on top of it Carlos

[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.920]
It's part of the fact that uh, I don't know. I don't know what to vote. I just vote something just to get a cone

[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.700]
Okay, just so I can see what's on here. It's on here. It's up

[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.840]
The poll on the noonder one. Okay, I love them votes already. I love it for it's okay

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.720]
Keep it for I hated too and it's weak. You're gonna be one so eight to three so far in favor. They knew the one Wednesday hour

[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.520]
How do you like that? I like it a lot. It's a big hit with one bullet

[00:16:52.500 --> 00:17:00.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line boy lots of crap today man lots and lots of stuff

[00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.540]
Carlos is having nervous breakdown. We had 50,000

[00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.800]
You know this village voice article you don't need to fast this to me. Okay. It was on our website yesterday

[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.040]
Bush's voice of America. Thank you very much, but we already had it. Thank you

[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.160]
God just read go to neorodges.com. I mean if they're getting the stuff off the village voice

[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:23.720]
They obviously have the internet right you think so why don't you check the stories that we have on here

[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.420]
So instead of wasting our time in paper you wouldn't bug me with stuff that we already know about and already have oh that's

[00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:30.620]
Smacks of efforts. Oh God

[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.740]
Man, it's unbelievable. Although here's one. It's interesting

[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.660]
From the Cincinnati Post

[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.400]
Robert Cunningham worked his whole life as a bus driver and skimped and saved try to buy a house

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:49.600]
When he went house hunting he turned to Pamela sanford a self-described religious person who got much of a business

[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:52.300]
Via people she met at church to broker his mortgage

[00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.840]
Sanford 29 of westwood

[00:17:54.840 --> 00:18:00.320]
Health Cunningham buy the house and crafted the else. She said but include the monthly payment on his van with his monthly mortgage payment

[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.040]
Cunningham was ecstatic until his van was repossessed for non-payment

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:10.280]
Oh, that's when sanford gave him documentation that was supposed to explain the auto loan company the cutting-am is making payments

[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:16.020]
The documentation was as bogus as the mortgage loan sanford gave to 10 victims struggling to attain the mercant dream

[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.360]
Did you laugh when you gave him that piece of paper? Hamilton County

[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:21.940]
Please court judge Melba marsh asked sanford at her sentencing

[00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:27.180]
I need to send a message to the community that there's a line of trust line angry marsh rolled sanford yesterday

[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:32.800]
You don't pray on people you don't victimize people so evidently she prays with an a y and also with an a y

[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.400]
Marsh then sentenced sanford a prison for six months the maximum sentence allowable nice going judge

[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:46.580]
Oh, yeah, so I'm missing a button on sorcerer. Which is other primary hunting grounds for con artists. I keep saying over and over again. Yeah, listen

[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.180]
Boy

[00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:55.340]
Another one of them goody goody two shoes religious assholes. I'm sorry for being repetitious. Excuse me

[00:18:55.340 --> 00:19:00.720]
40 votes on air already on the new to one comedy bits are good because we're gonna have this on air for a while

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:07.480]
Right and then we'll get to the second pool. What am I asking you right? I know what the hell's right and what's wrong? What?

[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:13.080]
Hey, gildey sounded pretty good this morning spider that first guy. It was ripping him and I mean he sounded squeaky like always happy

[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.720]
That you know something I was thinking the same thing and not only did he sound happy what I came in here this morning very early

[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.660]
Which I always do everybody in a building was happy. Zach was happy robber was even in a good mood

[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:27.560]
Which is really something and he was happy. Yeah, hi everybody was happy here

[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:32.560]
Yeah, nobody was like looking down the hall. You know, help me. No, because what was it build up?

[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.280]
Oh, he is just a creepy guy that mull my sister man

[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.800]
Just a creepy guy with a creepy hair piece and a creepy bag and creepy vericose veins

[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.880]
And I would love to dance on his grave and a creepy crawly on his head 40 votes on a pool already

[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.700]
What's your take on it noon to one hour Wednesdays? I love it 12. It's okay. Keep it 11

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.140]
That's 23 got it

[00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:58.960]
It's weak in rid of it 10. I hate it 7 so it's 23 17 it just like yesterday. It's tight. It's really tight

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:02.260]
It's tight

[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.420]
Here here's here's Miami hello. Hey, no it's going on. Yes, sir

[00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:12.940]
Your obviously against the war, but wouldn't you agree? No, that's it sir sir

[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.380]
Let me give you a little lesson how to call a talk show don't ever say to anybody you're speaking to wouldn't you agree?

[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:25.280]
Why don't you just ask me a question don't say wouldn't you agree is if as if the purpose of the call is to try to get me to agree with you

[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.000]
First of all, that's boring and secondly, maybe I will and maybe I won't let's see what the air question is

[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.740]
I believe that this war is preventive maintenance for further

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.900]
For their actions

[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.480]
For their actions. Yeah

[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.320]
Well, what does that mean actions like what I

[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.600]
Why is that how many terrorist attacks have we had by Iraq against this country or against the Brits?

[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:53.000]
Not 30 man. Yeah, okay. See there you go. We'll clown

[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:55.560]
Great

[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.800]
No, it's good because he couldn't he couldn't even keep a straight face. It's a joke

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.740]
Yeah, but get a little more into it next time. Okay, sir

[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.360]
5 6 70 I was a little enthusiasm

[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.180]
There you go

[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.540]
Pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon line here's hi Ali a hello. When is this?

[00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.460]
Well, yes

[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:22.120]
Yeah, I'm gonna vote on the on the the poll for yesterday. I think you're doing a terrible job covering the war. Yeah, I think your device is

[00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:26.420]
All you do is cloud be you want to let me ask your question. Why do you listen to the program?

[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.220]
I don't listen to the okay good 5 6 7 0 5 60 if you know listen to the program

[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.160]
You're not allowed to call the show. Okay, it's very simple. I mean we don't talk to anybody

[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.780]
But if you don't listen to the program you're not allowed to call the show very very

[00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:38.640]
clouding the issue. Yeah, stop clouding the issue

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.400]
the rest of them crystal

[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:41.660]
clear

[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:42.760]
Chris wait for your

[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:51.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and in this in which we know that was yesterday's poll the poll was on a website now

[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:55.200]
It's another day. Okay, sir. The verdict is in Phil Henry wins by landslide mo

[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.900]
Howard David and with the joke vote is second and I'm a closer to mo

[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.640]
In spite of the hundred bogus votes that came in from God only knows where from a bunch of dingled bats out

[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.100]
There we got no nothing better to do with their time than to creep the poll all brother

[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:12.160]
Those are somebody most productive people in the world not just an hour pool but any pool. We're creeping the poll

[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.940]
Maybe we're creeping it for Jesus

[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:15.720]
That's right

[00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.320]
Freeping it for Jesus and the Bush family now. We're talking heavy duty. Oh

[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.600]
67 votes and I knew in a one hour. It's weak. Get rid of it 23. It's okay. Keep it 17

[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.340]
I love it 16. I hate it 11. So add those up. Let's see. They like it the 33

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.700]
They hate it 34 wow you talk about that. It's tight

[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.980]
It's as tight as a witches

[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:46.980]
And of course you probably wonder how tight is a witches ass and I would suggest you start watching passions and ask Tabitha she'll tell you

[00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:54.400]
27 past nine at five sixty WQM. We got to of course this is the marlin's warm-up today for four hours

[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.660]
We got marlins on direct I'd deck at one o'clock

[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.140]
Then we got the marlins in the fillies again

[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.380]
Boy, I sure hope the marlin score a couple of runs today would be nice

[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.760]
I mean more than it would like a few and give up less than eight would be a good move in the right direction

[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:12.480]
So if this is the marlins warm-up are we talking small ball until the game starts? Oh, and y'all I'm glad you mentioned that since we're gonna

[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.540]
Get to our stupid annoying phrases momentarily. No, listen to me

[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.520]
If if guy if teams that have a lot of home run hitters they call home run scoring a lot of runs with home runs long ball

[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.680]
So the opposite that wouldn't be small ball. It would be short ball

[00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.320]
Get it now in this station of course when you got certain people would real squeaky voices

[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.540]
I guess maybe short balls small balls would be appropriate, you know that rhymes small and small ball

[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:39.400]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, and I hate to say it because I like the guy a lot of the boob with the first one

[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.480]
I heard used that the other day. Oh small ball. Oh, oh, oh, oh, and of course I love boob

[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.960]

Check my email and thank goodness for that and culture is moving to South Florida

[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:43.400]
If we don't have enough problems already Michael Jackson's coming here. We got OG already

[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:48.020]
We got eight million banana vote pe- oh we got the Latin Grammys coming in September

[00:26:48.020 --> 00:26:52.420]
Yeah, just inside for all the high and I'm not gonna waste my time going back to that story in a paper again because

[00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.040]
Wow, you know the protesters are promising. They're getting already

[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.180]
You know like I said neurotic repetition. That's what this town's all about just the same

[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:06.780]
Sad sorry as people doing the same sad story as crap and as far as that jackass who called from highly with his phone

[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.200]
Call who doesn't listen to the ledge who's obviously listening right now

[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.800]
Every time I say something that flies against the mainstream that happens to be my real opinion

[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.640]
But it just doesn't happen to go along with the mainstream. I'm divisive in other words

[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:26.180]
We're also supposed to go step in the line support whatever the ministration does support the mindless senseless

[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.300]
Unacceptable slaughter that's going on over there

[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.980]
That's going to get a lot worse before it gets better by the way in sped-a-how close there at a Baghdad

[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.260]
And we're just supposed to all say the same thing

[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:38.720]
Now what's the point? Why don't we all just do sighal and go step up and down

[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.640]
Federal highway and the helotalk shows, okay?

[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:46.080]
We fight that war in the firm. I mean what the hell is anybody want to give their opinion for when we're all supposed to have the same one

[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.220]
But you're divisive just like when I didn't agree about little alienito you're divisive

[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.820]
Speaking of that they pay me to give my opinion here so you're not to be a parrot not to echo yours or else president

[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:01.220]
Yes today's daily hijacking will be a dirigible. Oh great. You have the hijacking of the days

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:05.720]
About 12 30 will have that for you. I'll be covering it live. Welcome live

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.840]
Right people for the Marlon game

[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:14.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 palm 5 60 on the okay now let me give you the other pool that we're gonna start building now

[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.960]
The second pool of the day. We'll leave this one up for a while. Although this one is tough

[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:23.100]
What's your take on kneels Wednesday noon to one comedy vets hour? It's weak. Get rid of it 46

[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:26.280]
It's okay. Keep it 34. I love it 32. I hate it 26

[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:30.600]
So the positive ones are 66 and the negative ones are 72

[00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:33.320]
See how tight that is I totally it's tight

[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:35.840]
Yeah

[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.460]
Well, uh, they're they're undecided. They're like I'm a fence

[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:46.160]
Now let's see I of course in this town. I love it 33. I hated 26 now. That's pretty good

[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:50.380]
That's pretty encouraging because this is a tell where they hate just about everything including themselves

[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.420]
You're divisive you're a piece of crap. I don't listen to your show

[00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:57.180]
But I feel like I'm compelled to call you to you know to spew my hate in your direction

[00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.660]
What a jackass what a schmuck

[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.660]
Anyway, this is the second pool of me putting up and this will be the primary one for the day

[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:05.720]
Which you'll give your little father for your father

[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:09.540]
Which of these phrases or expressions bugs you the most

[00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.460]
We got a list starting with six

[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.500]
Don't even go there. Oh when people say that that just it sends me right to the bowl

[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.480]
Even though I may not want to really go there. Don't even go there

[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:28.440]
Small ball which we were talking about moments ago the new baseball thing for teams that don't hit a lot of home runs small ball

[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:33.960]
Goes yard another baseball for one of the guy hits home run goes yard. Oh Sammy goes yard

[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.240]
And I go ballistic every time I hear that he has issues

[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.080]
He has issues. I have tissues. Yeah over here in the quarter

[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.260]
And then of course one of everybody's absolute favorite

[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.060]
Why like that?

[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.600]
My we do like it, but I mean and you go girl

[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:53.060]
Though you go no you go girl first

[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.360]
Ladies first

[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:58.360]
So those are the six we got so far and you can add to it whatever a phrase or expression

[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:05.240]
That's commonly used especially in more contemporary times like these even for us all folies. That's just bug to live in crap audio

[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.240]
He has issues. We're gonna put some of the newfangled ones on their like what embed

[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:19.740]
phrases or expressions. Yeah, that's not bad and embedded in order embedded now just embedded sure because it says phrases or expressions

[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.320]
And

[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.380]
I am well embedded just to word well whatever the hell it is embedded. They'll know if they don't know by now they must be in bed

[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:35.580]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I like to go in a lighter direction if you don't mind so to speak a lighter direction

[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:40.440]
My girlfriend is listening outside Windsor on the internet right now. Yeah, I want her to hear what you're gonna say

[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.900]
Because I have an idea what you're gonna say because you said it before

[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.720]
Luis Miguel and Ricky Martin. She doesn't believe they've either one of them ever been with guys before she thinks they did well

[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:58.660]
Okay, that's for your girlfriend CKLW channel nine and of course used to be a great radio station to be eight but anyway, what is it?

[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:04.500]
She thinks that Luis Miguel and Ricky Martin have never been with a guy. Well, let me ask you this and I supposed to know the answer to that

[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:10.000]
No, but you used to talk about things when you knew since you've been out of the closet 2530 years you knew you know

[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.920]
You know you knew about that. I know what do you mean? I knew about that

[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:17.980]
Was that right you were the first one to bring it up? I don't know about that. I suspect okay?

[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:19.920]
Just like many other people suspect in fact

[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:26.500]
We have a pretty good idea and based on rumor in in you window etc. And so on we believe that it's possible in fact in Ricky's case

[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.520]
Highly likely in fact both of their case highly likely, but let me ask you this what differences that make

[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:38.940]
I mean she ever gonna get intimate with either one of them. No, has she ever met either one of them? No, but she loves Luis Miguel

[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.840]
Well, so so what's wrong with that?

[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:44.180]
It's okay. It's great, but I said even knew what the Vegas he loves them

[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:47.180]
He wants the Vegas to see him sing so I say to me concert three times. He's great

[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.280]
He's got the best voice in the world the matter work. Or it says Luis Miguel's got the greatest voice in history

[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.900]
One last thing you should ask all these phrases for the Latin people. How about every time they go leeson

[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.580]
I thought they start every that's how they start every phrase

[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.900]
If it's time they call you it's leeson

[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.420]
leeson

[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.880]
Don't you agree? Now I think they're saying gleeson gleeson

[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.040]
I want for the Jackie to come back have a great day pal and then my best wishes to your girlfriend a Windsor

[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.900]
Back, I'll see you're at the Windsor raceway with Marty Adler. How you doing Marty?

[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.420]
There off and pacing anyway

[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.680]
Yeah, let's do a harness racing show

[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.180]
So let's see now. What does he say no leeson that's not but how about a heads up?

[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.460]
Okay

[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:22.920]
Heads up

[00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.760]
Yeah, why don't you be a heads up on the fact that your boss is a douchebag, you know things like that

[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:34.800]
5 6 7 0 we already know 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line 150 three roasts

[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.720]
I'm not really sure why we ought to take this other one down. I don't think we're going to make any progress

[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.320]
You know, I mean it's so it's tight

[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.740]
What's your take on eels wednesday new to one comedy, but so our 153 votes already

[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:49.120]
In j 164 like I said it's weak get rid of it 58

[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:54.780]
It's okay keep it 41. I love it 37. I hate it 28 so the positive votes are

[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.220]
78 and the negative votes are 86

[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.500]
See what I'm talking about tight 86 to 78 in my book that's said for more I come from

[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.440]
From Rochester, New York that's considered pretty damn tight

[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.560]
Almost as tight as the lilacs are at the Rand Eastman Park

[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.000]
Well, I tell you the weather in Toronto right now is really crappy. Do you know that?

[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.340]
It's like 70 New York and there's a front and north of the lake. It's like freezing

[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:24.700]
It's like 28's going to be behind Toronto today. Do I is my timing generally pretty good on the weather stuff

[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:30.240]
Man for next four or five days. It's going to be like around zero Celsius like around 32 30

[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.560]
About 30 now as a matter of fact

[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:39.740]
Dave devol on CFT old last night said what's the temperature going to be the next four or five days in Toronto about 30 man and that's correct

[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.660]
That is absolutely correct Dave

[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:49.000]
So I did the right thing and here magnificent man. It's beautiful. What are your people so sour about huh?

[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.640]
What are you so sour about

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.360]
This is the time of the year when it's supposed to be happy time right

[00:33:55.100 --> 00:34:00.220]
They like yesterday was magnificent today looks pretty good to me going to be like in the low 80s not too hot

[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.920]
Not too cold like the porridge man. Just right. Yeah, my children still have their heads on their shoulders. Oh, I'm sorry

[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.760]
Yeah, that's right. That's correct most of you people your kids still have their heads on their bodies

[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.100]
They're in one piece and you didn't have 11 family members killed in the law at once

[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.600]
Oh, but you you know you don't survive support the military more than you assholes

[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.660]
I want to put these guys over there these young people by the way not all that well trained

[00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:27.860]
These are a lot of these most of the hunks punks first time in combat lives being squandered lives being thrown away

[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.240]
And it keeps continues being put into this

[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:38.320]
Hearts and flowers thing by MSNBC especially and CNN where we keep seeing the pictures on the billboard and here's John Smith from Wyoming

[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.360]
Yeah, you know like it's a human interest like this is all part of some kind of a soap opera

[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.440]
It's not a soap opera when you get in with a book

[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:49.240]
It's about a Bingman like Santino said in a godfather, you know what I'm talking about what are you gonna do?

[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:53.020]
Nice college boy, yeah, they want to get mixed up in the family business

[00:34:53.020 --> 00:34:56.380]
And now you want to go down a police captain one because he slapped you in a face a little bit

[00:34:56.380 --> 00:35:00.520]
Huh, what do you think this is the army where you shoot him a mile away? You got to get a close like this

[00:38:56.980 --> 00:39:00.300]
That board hole billboard sign then we'd got

[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:00.920]

[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.160]

[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:34.440]

Oragon law would jail war protesters as terrorists to give you an idea of where or what direction this country is headed to

[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.920]
We're headed in the right direction about as far to the right as you can go even a toe of the handle want to be involved

[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:07.140]
An Oregon anti terrorism bill would jail street blocking protesters for at least 25 years

[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:13.540]
In a thinly veiled effort to discourage anti-war demonstrations critics say for at least 25 years

[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:22.260]
The bill is met strong opposition but lawmakers to look expected a bit on the definition of terrorism and the value of free speech before a vote by the

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:26.540]
Oregon state senator judiciary committee whose chairman republican senator john minnes

[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.480]
Roti proposed legislation

[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.580]

Dubbed senate bill 742 it identifies a terrorist as a person who plans or participates in an act that is intended by at least one of its participants to disrupt business

[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.660]
Transportation schools government or free assembly

[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.820]
The bill's few yeah ironic

[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.780]
The bill's few public supporters say police needs stronger laws to break up protests that are created

[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:57.920]
Have a concedes-like portland where thousands of people have marched and demonstrated against war in iraxon's last fall

[00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:02.220]
We need some additional tools to control protest that shut down the city said

[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.900]
Lars Larsen a conservative radio talk show host who is aggressively stumped for the bill

[00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:11.660]

Here's poppin. Oh, hello. Yeah, good morning. They all how you doing? I'm doing okay

[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:32.600]
I don't know if you noticed this the other day

[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:35.180]
I just haven't picked it up because I had the times from Monday

[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.960]
Did you see that whole thing a business day about your channel?

[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:40.900]
Yeah, yeah, we talked about it

[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:48.220]
Okay, I wouldn't miss that but uh, they like on about seven the five million radio stations and they're like orchestrating all of these so-called these phony

[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.920]
Pro-war rallies and manipulating their people

[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.740]
I guess like Phil because you know, he's he indirectly works for clue channel they own

[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.480]
Premiere which he works for so

[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:04.840]
Yeah, but the thing that really gets me is I get time magazine delivered and they had a time CNN poll and this is where it really gets me with

[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:12.700]
Americans if there were only 500 peak casualties people voted like 70 something percent if there were a thousand

[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:20.100]
It went down if it went up to five thousand it was a lot lower but these people think that even 500 lives is worth all of this

[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.700]
And it just leaves you speechless. What is there to say about that?

[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:28.380]
You know, it's interesting those 500 lives that they're willing to forfeit for a

[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.780]
Absolutely totally corrupt the kind of invasion not even a war for an invasion

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:36.200]
As long as they're not their lives or somebody that's close to them or their children

[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:41.160]
They're willing to sacrifice it like it's small potatoes like it isn't for real. You know, again like it's statistics on a page

[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.780]
I don't know this country. I don't know which direction it's headed in Neil Bayon. I remember what I've always paid with you

[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.940]
A country that doesn't place a great value on human life can never be a great country

[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.040]
Well, look at their doing with the commentations from people. Look at their trying to do people got their wrong arm cut off by a doctor

[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.740]
Mm-hmm

[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:03.520]
Yeah, give you about 50 bucks. I might be hiding you to the border of Canada. Okay. I'll see you

[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.480]
Let's see. Please play the gun shots the gun

[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.920]
Show them. Oh, okay. Thanks. Okay, Dan. Whatever you say

[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.640]
I got that spot coming up and it'll be on again over and over and over again

[00:44:14.820 --> 00:44:18.640]
These damn gun shows that shows you how desperate we are in this radio station and screw in of course

[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:23.200]
Maybe a state of a scraper ass off the floor. She you know take care of these things and we get some more spots on log

[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.540]
Sure, so go go in there and get the program log for the rest of the day. I want to take a look at I want to see if it's as light as this

[00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.360]
Here's the fact it says get with the program. We bomb their country. They they rebuild it

[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:40.220]
i.e. Use their oil money. No out of pocket for us. Oh, yeah, right

[00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:43.840]
First we'll bring their oil technology up to date. It's not a good shape

[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:46.880]
Then we'll ramp up production in their rear to their real capacity

[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:52.220]
Not to many can't even read this pretty good for companies like backtell other rich or well connected. Okay

[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.340]
There you go. Who can we look for next? Somebody's got a lot of oil would be good

[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.780]
I still say Saudi Arabia would be good. I might even support that

[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.100]
Okay, let's take a look now. Don't don't leave you can't just leave this in here. You come well

[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.900]
That's right. We got the Marlin came on too

[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:07.660]
Which quite frankly when you think about that

[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.120]
Oh boy

[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.860]
A little bit more there but not uh, you have some trades and a little bit of this

[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:20.160]
Little bit of that and then get like I said nothing and you think that with the Marlin game on

[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:24.280]
There'd be more like jammed in because that takes up so much of the day our sales department's on vacation

[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.520]
By the way if anybody wants to buy these spots no no, we don't we don't have any left

[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.720]

307 votes once you're in addition to which how much are we talking about the word today?

[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:24.700]
I thought we're talking about the expressions that kids you aggravated and about the

[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:26.340]
Comedy bits we plan Wednesday

[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.400]
Talked about the war for about 10 seconds and then one article about the woman who saw her two girls a head blown off

[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:36.640]
The latest on the black hawk holland hopter and again, they're also saying that does not appear to have been brought down by enemy fire

[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.020]
No, a lot of accidents and a lot of friendly fire seven more Americans are killed there

[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:45.300]
Well, that's a good thing. That's an interesting thing that one caller brought up that pull in other words

[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.320]
If the casualties are 500 less, it's okay

[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:51.520]
Then we start getting a lot more nervous if it reaches a thousand that would be a good pull question

[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:57.740]
How many Americans have to die or allied troops have to die or how many innocent people have to die since a lot of

[00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:02.220]
Innocence are Americans or Brits how many innocent people have died before you start losing your enthusiasm

[00:58:02.220 --> 00:58:09.580]
Your appetite for this conflict barking up the wrong operation Iraqi freedom trying to listen sympathy for the Iraqi civilians is

[00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:12.240]
Pertles oh, that's right. It's town or in this country oh

[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:13.500]

Yeah, should we put that on there? Sure?

[00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:26.360]
Well, you're certainly not for enthusiasm

[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.060]
It's weak compared to the other one I put it on there and then there's one an only mad dog says I

[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.000]
I know a lot of people say that I

[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:44.120]

[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:15.060]
But I don't think yeah, well we give what you're saying and you're right, but it's it's a little weak right weak

[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:20.540]
It won't have much of an impact on our pool. It won't impact it not like what's your take in fact

[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:25.600]
I think somebody's got some that's impacted maybe that's what's part three hundred and twenty two votes

[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.320]
Maybe was amorous the cat

[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:32.260]
What's your take on Niels Wednesday noon to one comedy bits are it's weak get rid of it 95

I bet your pack gets a bunch of votes today, you know what about third man

[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.980]
322 votes 95 and

[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:54.120]
58 is 153 got that 153 and the other two is 164

[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.220]
So the positive votes 164 to 153 wow

[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.440]
I'm sure I think it's a good thing we put pap you can in honor because that's just it's gonna be just that's it

[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.380]
Let's get the judge with the eye, you know the one I looked at was looking at the chance the a ballot the wall

[01:00:09.380 --> 01:00:12.840]
I got to get the judge with that bulging eye to look up at this thing. I can't wait

[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:16.360]
Yeah, he was great. He was everywhere in the world

[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.200]
They saw that the Palm Beach County judge with a bulging

[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:22.520]
He was good

[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.240]
5670560

[01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:32.920]
pound 560 on the AT&T and for rising world Islam we got a real battle nip and tuck nose to nose side by each

[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.540]
On that noon to one pool

[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.960]
I will we'll have to shut it off at 11

[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.280]
All right, in fact, let's shut the whole place down in London. Oh sounds good to me. You go. Yeah. Yeah

[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:46.320]

And of course he was positive and he had the right answer

[01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:57.000]
3rd man

[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.640]
Here's a call from a sunrise. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. I like to contribute a couple of friends. Okay. Go ahead him

[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:08.640]
Not for nothing. Not for nothing. Okay. That's good. And my bad. Oh

Yeah, oh George always says that and I hate that. I'm so glad you say I'll hang up and listen. Okay. Thanks not like I eat

[01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:24.600]
You always say that my bad. Oh, that is so that is so childish man. It's so juvenile so silly my dad was nodding

[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.240]
He says it five every five now. He does. He never talked to him

[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.140]
Well, you think I'm a moron?

[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.320]
They'll all talk to him for what am I going to learn from him

[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:41.560]
Huh? I don't want to find out what it's like under the overpass. He lives in the hotel from the beach. Yeah, he lives in the fountain blue

[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:49.600]
He lives in the Bando and the beach on the beach and I'm supposed to we're supposed to feel sorry for him and take up collections

[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600]
And I'm writing him checks so we can work on a weekend

[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.520]
Jesus Christy probably listen to this in front. Oh, I got another one. How is the crib?

[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:04.140]
Hmm, I mean crib. Yeah, but I've only ever heard run venington

[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.640]
Run DS. No, you're right. See you're trying to educate me about what puns say to be cool

[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:17.560]
Then I do I don't hang out with any punks. Okay. I'm sorry. I don't see any punks hanging it out. Not here anyway

[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:18.920]
No seriously

[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.120]
Whether you like that or not now. What is it? What did I just say? How's the crib? How's the crib? Oh

[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.580]
God how's by you

[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:30.880]
How are they going to be having a final four in New Orleans?

[01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:35.660]
Speaking about you, but don't go there by the way. Oh, you silly basketball people. It's a horrible place

[01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.220]
You'll regret every second of it. I heard Zach this morning. Oh, we got to go to New Orleans. He's a basketball

[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.160]
What's wrong with you Zach? In addition, which you know what he would do up there

[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.940]
Drink and eat eat and drink. Yeah

[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.460]
Zach we're talking about right fat fat Zach who's on the edge who's always have you noticed how he's always sick by the way

[01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:54.640]
always sick

[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:59.900]
Was sitting in there the other day with the coffin poor Ken Maulden. I hope that nothing happens to Ken

[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:03.760]
He's in the bullpen with guy told Ken. I said if he starts coffin running out of here

[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.960]
He says got a sore throat. What was he doing in there?

[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:11.000]
Maybe certainly wasn't getting material ready for mo because mo always got this two-day vacation

[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.960]
Which has already been on the schedule so was pre-planned. I heard he had to get his pieces dried out

[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.560]
from the flood

[01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:18.480]
Huh

[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:21.000]
Was bags over spilled

[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:26.080]
He had to get his pieces dry cleaned. I wonder if dry concepts would do most hair pieces

[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.980]
Let's suck the dirt right out of this suck it right out

[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.660]
Fine in fact, maybe they could do his Veracos veins at the same time

[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T man. He's a mess. He's a good one to be talking

[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.500]
I mean I'm a fat old slob. I look like Carol. I'm gross, but I admit it

[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:48.200]
But he fancies himself like a real fashion play like a hot like he like he's hot, you know

[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.900]
Yeah, he does he really does he thinks he's a good looking man. Yeah compared to the thusla

[01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:58.160]
I've never seen the thusla compared to Ben Franklin

[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:02.040]
Compared to people who have been dead for like about two 300 years and in fact

[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.500]
Let's check it out when you come right down to it Ben might be in bomb pretty good

[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:07.540]

It made the list. Thank you. Thanks Neil. See you keep it on the down low

[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:38.840]

[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.840]
Okay, don't you love my math and the other ones 162 so the positives are pulling away just a little bit

[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:17.560]

Everything is fresh and crunchy and delicious

[01:07:02.060 --> 01:07:06.900]
Nothing sits there and gets mushy like mung like the other Chinese buffets and also unlike the other joints

[01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:11.300]
They don't use any crap you won't walk out of the Emelcoach with a headache ever because there's no MSG

I'm being complacent believe in every word of this cartel administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation

[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.760]
We love you Jessica. Okay, but let's cut the crap a little bit of overkill. Oh, I'm sorry

[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:55.000]
Oh

[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.220]
Now this is a good fact, but we're not putting any of the protruding this down, but it's cute

[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:06.260]
It says phrase live and local except when heels in Toronto when hangs in Vegas when ESPN program is the unaccepted auto town ball game

[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:09.140]
Live welcome live

[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.560]
Vaseball phrases that have been banned during wartime twin killing for double play

[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.080]
Vombed

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:23.220]
As in the marlin's pitching staff or sheld and blast for a home run can't say these things

[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:26.020]
All you can say is up up and away

[01:12:26.860 --> 01:12:28.600]
And maybe he's getting ready to do Superman

[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:34.400]
Dave Van Hornie with a bad with the Dave Van boring with a real bad hair piece and the hot white to do Superman

[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:39.060]
He's gonna do Superman you're gonna get it up and they're gonna go away

[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:44.120]
Here's a fact from Henry who says he's he's just awful, you know

[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:47.240]
By the way, don't forget Dave Van boring. I'll be on this afternoon with the booster

[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.060]
And it'll be marlin's baseball of Q.I.M

[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.200]
Yeah, we're gonna go out and kick some fillies ass come on. Let's do it

[01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:58.520]
Uh, here's what it says. I don't dare call uh, what is it?

[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.240]
BC what does that mean?

[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:08.220]
British Columbia because the last time you called me a punk and I'm up on me or you're a punk Henry that was probably about nine years ago

[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.660]
Henry's a little sensitive. Okay, I chased him away

[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:18.880]
I called him a punk about yeah, years ago, and he probably still has anyway. It says oh dog is in what's up dog? Yeah dog

[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:25.640]
I love that dog. I do love dogs but I don't like that expression and George is upset about that because he says that all the time

[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.280]
What

[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:34.700]
Nothing people calling up with stuff we already have in the list. We're just relax. What is why are you so uptight? Seriously?

[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.880]
Are you gonna get paid? Are you gonna get paid any more for getting aggravated by them? How many times

[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.540]
They've called with things that we've already got on our list. How many times they've called

[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.540]
About third man and the most annoying of it all it says two words

[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.920]
It's two words, but man does it suck to hear it?

[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.260]
We don't have put this one there, but I do like this president bush

[01:13:56.260 --> 01:13:59.800]
Oh, that just sends me right to the bowl

[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:03.640]
Thanks Henry you're okay in our book and not a fuck anymore clearly

[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.360]

[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.780]
Yeah, that's okay, but does make the list. That's it's okay though. I don't want you to feel bad clearly is good

[01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:15.380]
Uh, you're killing me in the Mickey Mouse voice

[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:22.640]
Hello Michael isor's office. Yeah, we got a new Mickey and isor by the way coming up momentarily

[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:26.480]

[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.080]
What's your mindset?

[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:48.220]
This is for our good friend Alan who's a regular fax about Alan you can't win every day

[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:50.140]
Don't get that

[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:51.840]
Yaddi yaddi yaddi

[01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:57.060]
Who you're saying yes you want to put on yaddi yaddi yaddi

[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.200]
Okay, he's scrolling at yaddi three times yaddi yaddi yaddi

[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.820]
Oh my god, this is gonna be a long list. They're just gonna really get upset. Good. I mean

[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:10.000]
Uh, and whatnot

[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:13.220]
Yeah, that's a good one and whatnot not

[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:17.280]
No, that's not that's different and whatnot and whatnot

[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:24.460]
Okay, and whatnot only idiots say some of these things in real intellectual like like me. I don't be saying

[01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:32.620]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Let me ask you. Actually. What's your mindset?

[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.380]
Whatever what's your take? What's your take?

[01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:38.500]
Ha ha

[01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:46.120]
Girlfriend what's your take girlfriend? You go girlfriend Angela Ray. She's the anti-Christ. Okay. I will never watch and I'm gonna

[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:52.140]
Stick with this one this time. This is a promise to myself. I will never watch channel four local news again

[01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:57.460]
I will watch Dan rather every night because I do love Dan rather and spread what some of you idiots say but I like Dan

[01:15:57.460 --> 01:15:58.820]
Rather like CBS even news

[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.520]
Yeah, but he's a liberal good. That's good. Maybe that's why I like Dan rather at least we don't get that right when you slant

[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:07.720]
I don't think we get any slant on CBS news. No, we just get the goddamn news

[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:12.160]
But channel four news and that's Angela Ray that's simple and correct

[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:17.460]
Don't you people a channel for to say the difference between a newscast and a goddamn pepper alley? No

[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:21.820]
No, I haven't really not that I wish you would have seen that you just would have been in disbelief

[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:25.020]
I mean she went on and on about Jessica and

[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:29.760]
How proud we are and how what a great role model she is and everybody else is so inspired

[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:34.000]
I guess you forgot about the 11 soldiers who didn't get out of that hospital the bodies they found it

[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:40.040]
And the seven who died and at the black hawk down and the helicopter. Yeah, but they weren't shot and the pilot that was

[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:46.040]
Well, the story keeps changed first of all they said that the the jet that was shot down was shot down by a

[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:50.140]
Patriot missile was friendly fire again now. They're saying the Iraqi shot it down. They don't know see

[01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:53.920]
They don't want to say the Iraqis did anything. See right none of our people no

[01:16:54.620 --> 01:16:57.700]
Well wouldn't it make more sense to say that the Iraqis that the

[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:04.080]
Republican Guard and the evil do or the the ponds of Sodom are the ones who are killing our troops wouldn't it be a little bit more

[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.380]
uh, absolutely no

[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:11.080]
But isn't the kind of embarrassing to say that we keep killing ourselves in a British with friendly firing at all of that's all dangerous

[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:11.960]
We are oh

[01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:15.380]
They say that and then they will fear you right

[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:16.500]
God

[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:21.940]
104 votes on air 21 for pat you can a nice god Pat

[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.220]

[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:33.600]
It's

[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.480]
It's okay keep it 102 and I hate it 62

[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.240]
So the negative area like uh

[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:40.400]
Flailing

[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:46.780]
172 negative and 211 positive it's moved ahead by like 20 in the 39 votes

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.620]
You know i'm a wizard on math. I mean if I if I knew anything it's useless, you know

[01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.660]
Like it's a direct because that's a track math if I need to count at my winnings at the track

[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:57.560]
I would like to do in the second course. I don't have any

[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.360]
We're like to my all my big profits in a market that I made, you know, but I don't have any

[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.300]
But you can track can't you oh yeah

[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.740]
I just can't multiply

[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.040]
The 28th pass Jay. Yeah, that's right. Of course you can

[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:15.020]
Yeah, it's on me

[01:18:15.980 --> 01:18:21.300]
28 past 10 at 560 WDQA. I'm happy Thursday to you. We got the Marlin game baby

[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:24.560]
We're just warming the audience up for that big Marlin game. Yeah

[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:29.140]
The marlins and they filthed off your fillies who are really damn good team by the way

[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:33.440]
And who kicks a marlin ass eight to five opening night Monday and last night eight to two

[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.820]
Little bit of a poultry crowd last night

[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.800]
Be real interesting to see is today's game televised. A lot of the afternoon games don't get televised

[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:43.700]
You yes or you don't know well, let me look

[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:49.160]
Let me look in the Harold sports section and by the way sports fans

[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.840]
Ray Whitney 52 assists. He's one of the league leaders in assist with Columbus

[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:58.180]
I just mentioned that three assists last night and Columbus the straight jackets now have 68 points

[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:02.200]
And your Florida Panthers 68 points each with two games remaining

[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:05.740]
The Columbus has six more wins though than the Panthers

[01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:09.340]
So it's a good chance that Columbus will finish ahead and points at the Panthers

[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:14.000]
Which would make that draft pick a deal in the beginning of the in the last year's draft really

[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:17.900]
Cave right in on the Panther organization again. Wow

[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:21.360]
As Doug McLean may pull a wool over their eyes one more time

[01:19:22.180 --> 01:19:25.680]
There's clearance out there don't look so happy anymore. I guess the beast is giving up on him

[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.920]
The beast is removed more fertile ground

[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.920]
What is he always all so he's gonna little sore

[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:38.080]
Given some KY and show him the way out the door. Oh, let's see the marlins is a game on TV today. Do we know?

[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.420]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:43.020]
Mr. Sports you're such a pot. You know what

[01:19:43.860 --> 01:19:47.640]
God clearance. He knows it's gonna be on radio. That's all that matter. Oh, yeah

[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:52.980]
And your guy there is really boring by the way Dave hand boring. At least he lives up to his name. He is Ponderous

[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:57.460]
Up up in a way. Oh, it's on TV. You don't want to hear it on a radio. It's on TV

[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.680]
But what is that channels 35 and 67?

[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.580]
Well, what is that packs? Oh

[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:08.880]
I see. Well, thought I'm what why do they what is wrong with the hero? Don't they much of idiots or what?

[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:13.940]
Why don't they just put on packs TV because on my cable at 16 packs him

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:17.860]
Mm-hmm. I guess in date county it's 35 and 30 something like that

[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:20.260]
So it is on TV soon. I have to listen to Dave and boring

[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:24.260]
But who's the guy that does the TV now for tomorrow? I have no idea what his name is

[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:26.300]
Ledden Casper Lynn Casper

[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:31.680]
He's a little weak too, you know, but it sure miss Joe Angel. You know what? Nice going Joe

[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:36.140]
You got out of this god for second town. You went to the world serious out there with a giant nice going baby

[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.820]
A good guy Joe Angel

[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.900]
In fact, you remember he made that comment. He didn't want to mention my name because he wanted to work again

[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:49.120]
But his last broadcast you see we want to take the thank the talk show pollsters and pundits remember that what took a poll on Joe Angel

[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:50.140]
Yeah

[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:57.120]
After they unceremoniously blew him out of here so they could make way for Dave O'Brien highly overrated generic Dave O'Brien

[01:20:57.540 --> 01:20:59.800]
Dave O'Brien sounds like a weak boob shombie, you know

[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:03.960]
Hey, hi everybody. It's a little absurdity. I got that real happy. You know don't get me wrong

[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:05.740]
I love boob is a good guy even with orange hair

[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:11.340]
But tell him not to be so goddamn happy when you give up 16 runs in two games. You shouldn't be so happy, okay?

[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:15.740]
Tell him not to be quite so happy, okay? Boog just hold it out a little bit. You'll be all right

[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:20.540]
You see he smiles because he knows what I'm talking about. He knows exactly what I'm saying

[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.780]
That's why when he does a talk show. I mean you can get away with that on a ballgame

[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:29.980]
I guess but doing a talk show nobody wants you a happy talk show host. No, that's why we get these calls

[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:33.960]
That's why they call with his crap all the time. They want to make damn sure of it

[01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:40.080]
We're happy though. We got a real good thing going and we got no spots grants to lay in the prone prone position back in the orifice

[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:44.520]
That must have been a real mess at the ballpark to them and not that we don't have enough problem

[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:47.380]
So the other teams now now she creates a problem with the marlins

[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:51.540]
You think the marlins would be glad that anybody would broadcast their stupid ass games, okay?

[01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.920]
You think they'd kiss Greg Reid's ass to put that swill on the air

[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.280]
And then scurrand goes over there just when we thought we had it all patched up and puts out a grotesque

[01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.400]
Luck in our sky box at the ballpark on Monday night

[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:07.120]
They had a pager husband and 15 paramedics to come to scrape her ass off the floor

[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.020]
And she's still out of it. She's still back there crawling around with what's his name?

[01:22:13.660 --> 01:22:16.740]
29 till 11 at 5.60 WQAM

I just want to put a show on for a clearance put a smile on his face anyway

[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.640]

Reveals. Yeah there you are. Reveals coming in. Yeah there you are. Stop

[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:42.760]
You're gathering remits.

[01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:48.500]
What the hell are you doing? Putting in a drainage system up.

[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:53.700]
A drainage system. Yeah you know a system of artificial natural drains and ditches.

[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.920]
You know used to drain off the water. I know what a drainage system is.

[01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:03.200]
Reveals. I don't need a drainage system in my office for heaven's sake. I don't even have a water pump.

[01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:07.380]
Aye sir. Yes sir. Oh by the way I forgot that. How did the Oscars go?

[01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.680]

Well we figured she's on ABC. I know what I figure I do it just for the hell that it be fun.

[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:28.480]
I figure I get a little action afterwards. You know what she says to me?

[01:25:28.820 --> 01:25:34.720]
Why married? I can't do that. You're my boss. I don't want to go down that road.

[01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:38.200]
Hang on a minute there's an explosion in my office.

[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:39.760]
Reveals.

[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.780]
Reveals. Reveals. It's like I'm wrecked.

[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.460]
What the hell are you doing to me? That's right through the wall boss.

[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.900]

[01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:57.220]
pups president. Get away from me. Reveals. Just think like.

[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:57.780]

[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:58.140]
Go.

[01:25:58.680 --> 01:25:59.200]
Hi sir.

[01:25:59.440 --> 01:25:59.860]
Yes sir.

[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:00.740]
What the hell?

[01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:01.980]
Are you doing to me?

[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.760]
Are you doing to me?

[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.100]
But we'll all say how did it go with Jennifer?

[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.900]
It didn't I sir. I got nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:10.980]
You wouldn't give me a hand.

[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.460]
Well so you are married man.

[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:16.140]
I know what. Just sound like mini.

[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:18.900]
I went home she said oh I saw you on stage with Jennifer.

[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:20.900]
Go ahead if you love me so much water come out of here.

[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.400]
I said I don't want to marry her mini.

[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:23.500]
I just want to.

[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:25.420]
Bring it back. Come on.

[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.160]
Reveals.

[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.400]
What are you doing?

[01:26:28.540 --> 01:26:29.600]
I'm getting a crew boss.

[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.120]
I'll get your crew water here.

[01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:31.640]
I'm here.

[01:26:31.720 --> 01:26:32.100]
Yes.

[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:32.920]
What the hell?

[01:26:33.260 --> 01:26:33.900]
Are you doing?

[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.060]
Are you doing to me?

[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:37.520]
Thank you.

[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.520]
23 to 11 at 560 WQM.

[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:41.960]
Here's what it says for your next pool.

[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:43.660]
This says the major pool.

[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.100]
Your big pool.

[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.360]
How about the um team time?

[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:48.060]
What are my all time worst phrases?

[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:48.880]
It's an um team time?

[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.060]
No.

[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:52.340]
Thank you Richard.

[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.880]
Oh that export opportunity.

[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.240]
Vanger still listening after all these years.

[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.140]
Thank you Richard.

[01:26:56.660 --> 01:26:58.220]
Don't feel bad because we didn't put your thing on the list.

[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.200]
If I told you once it's the um team time I've told you.

[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:03.400]
How about yeah this has got to be on there.

[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:05.080]
Even though they're probably good confused with the other one.

[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:06.200]
How about was that dog?

[01:27:07.960 --> 01:27:09.360]
And that's supposed to just plain.

[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:09.780]
Duh.

[01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:10.140]

[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:10.880]
It's blows.

[01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:12.560]
It's just pulling back.

[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.700]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.780]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:15.640]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.160]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:16.880]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.420]
It's pulling back.

[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:19.800]
The power of Moe compelled it.

[01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:21.300]
And it just came back.

[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:23.600]
457 votes on air.

[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.480]
Say I wasn't too bad.

[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.100]
We can handle that.

[01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.700]
Once a year we can handle that.

[01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.100]
That's it.

[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.380]
That's your quota.

[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.760]
Piece of crap.

[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:33.300]
What's your take on Niels Wednesday noon in one comedy.

[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:35.200]
But it's our 457 votes.

[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.940]
That's pretty heavy duty in them when we start there.

[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:40.200]
About 930.

[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.260]
Anyway I love it 122.

[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:42.740]
It's weekend.

[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.140]
We're about 122.

[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:44.920]
It's okay.

[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:45.980]
Keep it 117.

[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:46.860]
I hate it.

[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.700]
65 and I voted for Pat Buchanan.

[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:49.440]
Look at that.

[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:52.060]
We were absolutely right when we said 31.

[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:55.640]
So let's see the positive ones.

[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.440]
I love it and it's okay.

[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:58.820]
It's 239.

[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:01.740]
And the negative ones is 187.

[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.080]
So 13 and 39 is like 52.

[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:06.500]
Okay we can get that off of there now.

[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.800]
What are you smiling about?

[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.660]
They're never going to catch up unless they want to

[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.380]
free it again like the yesterday's pool.

[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:16.220]
This morning I'm sure love to know who that was this morning.

[01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:19.520]
Just really heavy duty pouring in the anti-neil votes.

[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:21.860]
You know see I mean you know we try to be fair on a show at

[01:28:21.860 --> 01:28:23.560]
least a little bit anyway or at least pretend to be.

[01:28:24.020 --> 01:28:26.680]
And you know put our Oars our Ossah on there.

[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.920]
Put our own names on there.

[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:28.780]
You want to take a little shot.

[01:28:28.860 --> 01:28:30.020]
You don't like what we're saying about the war.

[01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:30.940]
Which we don't care.

[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.180]
For more than 60 years,

[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:34.660]
Marines have gone forth

[01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:37.260]
from camp was soon

[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:39.900]
to find our country's battles.

[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:40.540]
Who are?

[01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:43.580]
So anyway so that way it means we can continue with the

[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:44.380]
new one hour Wednesday.

[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:44.840]
Huh?

[01:28:45.300 --> 01:28:47.000]
Maybe we'll do it like from 1222

[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.360]
to 1257.

[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:49.920]
I.

[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.580]
Or maybe like 121730.

[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.480]
I apologize yesterday for getting out of here too soon

[01:28:56.480 --> 01:28:58.920]
but the clock was screwed up and we're still trying to figure out how that

[01:28:58.920 --> 01:28:59.900]
happened all by itself.

[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:00.260]
Right.

[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:02.140]
How does the clock go fast?

[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:03.360]
Correct.

[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.560]
It's not a fast clock.

[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:07.180]
Although once upon a time that I've attended this story when I was a kid

[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:09.400]
in Brighton in Rochester, New York in Brighton.

[01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:12.480]
And one day I come home from school it's like uh

[01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.880]
remember like it was yesterday.

[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:15.500]
That's a hundred years ago.

[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:17.760]
And I'm in the kitchen with my mother.

[01:29:19.380 --> 01:29:22.680]
And the clock on the wall in the kitchen the electric clock

[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:25.400]
started going the wrong way.

[01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:26.580]
Ooh.

[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.320]
So you're looking at me.

[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:29.800]
I don't know what to love this too.

[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:29.900]
Right.

[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:31.560]
Get it back on here for a while.

[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:34.520]
The second hand started going

[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:36.640]
counterclockwise.

[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:40.620]
And then the minute hand was also going counterclockwise.

[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:42.760]
It's as if we were in the time tunnel with James Deren.

[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:44.400]
Yeah exactly.

[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.500]
The clock was moving back.

[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.800]
Now I've heard of I think they exist.

[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:51.080]
Those self-adjusting

[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:52.820]
clock.

[01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:52.840]
No.

[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:55.860]
Now this is self-adjusting clock.

[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.380]
This was like a five dollar clock from a hundred years ago.

[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:02.040]
You're thinking like the atomic clock that corrected itself at the top of the hour.

[01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:02.380]
Yeah.

[01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:04.840]
Man, oh man, you must be dreaming.

[01:30:06.420 --> 01:30:08.000]
You must be off your rocker.

[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.780]
Hickory, dickory duck.

[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.260]
I was watching a hands on a clock.

[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.840]
And they were moving backwards.

[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:15.780]
3rd man.

[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:16.100]
Yeah.

[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.580]
5 6 7 0 5

[01:30:19.180 --> 01:30:19.580]
60.

[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.760]
See, you were fascinated by that.

[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:22.500]
It's a true story.

[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.020]
I don't know what I guess.

[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.060]
I unplugged it and plugged it back in and it was okay.

[01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:28.040]
Huh?

[01:30:28.540 --> 01:30:28.780]
Strange.

[01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:30.300]
Oh, I never got to these faxes.

[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.040]
Jesus Christ.

[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:36.660]
Phil Henry has been brainwashed by his wife

[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.460]
who's a right wing bitch, Aula, and Coltory.

[01:30:39.460 --> 01:30:41.800]
She'll go back to smoking weed and dating black woman.

[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.740]
It says there's an excellent facts.

[01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:44.460]
How do you like that?

[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:46.860]
So Phil's wife is a right wing bitch.

[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:49.460]
And she's brainwashed him and that's why all of a sudden

[01:30:49.460 --> 01:30:51.540]
he's taken on his ultra right wing persona

[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:55.960]
which totally flies in the face of everything we knew and loved.

[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:56.620]
Are you sure?

[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:58.920]
How do you like that?

[01:30:59.120 --> 01:30:59.800]
Here's the other facts.

[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:00.420]
I forgot these.

[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:00.800]
I'm sorry.

[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:01.540]
I'm so sorry.

[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.000]
Aren't I sorry?

[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:02.400]
No.

[01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:03.500]
But it sounds very sincere.

[01:31:04.300 --> 01:31:05.860]
It says, man, if you don't like bushes,

[01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:07.400]
ask like all these spicks in this town,

[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.520]
I guess that makes you evil.

[01:31:09.080 --> 01:31:10.780]
This country has never been more divided

[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.660]
and it will get worse.

[01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.860]
I'm a Vietnam veteran still having enough sense to see

[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.000]
that this war is wrong.

[01:31:15.180 --> 01:31:15.600]
Keep it up, Neil.

[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.320]
Mike, thank you, Mike.

[01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:16.460]
I'm like,

[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:19.440]
loving kisses, Mike, kind of boy.

[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.020]
I'll tolerate you later.

[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.860]
I'll tolerate you later.

[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.100]
This phrase, effing sucks.

[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:27.800]
What you're right about that, but we never heard it.

[01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:31.620]
At the end of the day, oh yeah, you know who likes to say that?

[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:32.560]
Who?

[01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:33.820]
Bill Tanner.

[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.080]
What?

[01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:36.840]
Yeah, he at the end of the day,

[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:38.960]
drive so late.

[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:39.780]
Gay.

[01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.880]
Flee at the end of the day.

[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:44.760]
We got to put that on.

[01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:45.720]
Nah.

[01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:47.320]
Let's see.

[01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:48.440]
And that's also from Carolyn.

[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.180]
Thank you, Carolyn.

[01:31:50.660 --> 01:31:51.240]
Got game.

[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:53.060]
As in he's got, he's got game.

[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:54.060]
What?

[01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:56.500]
It's a sports term.

[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.860]
I know, I know, I know, I know my sports, Mr.

[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:00.600]
I never heard of it.

[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.040]
All right.

[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.980]
I know my sports cashing out going damn T.

[01:32:03.120 --> 01:32:05.360]
I could have, I could have done circles around Mo Howard, David

[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:06.660]
on any, any play by play.

[01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:10.440]
I just want to mention that again because I would like to dance on his grave.

[01:32:11.540 --> 01:32:12.300]
Side by each.

[01:32:12.380 --> 01:32:13.460]
Oh, and it says, what the hell is that?

[01:32:13.540 --> 01:32:14.520]
That's a Canadian thing, eh?

[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:15.520]
Side by each.

[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:17.680]
You use that all the time.

[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.500]
It's as a joke.

[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:18.820]
Right.

[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:23.340]
Because Frank Sileve was probably the best race collar in the North

[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.640]
America, at least harness racing anyway.

[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.440]
Frank Sileve at the Woodbine in Mohawk and Toronto.

[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:30.340]
Remember that I put the audio on for my digital cable?

[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:30.860]
Right.

[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.620]
They were replaying the races from night before.

[01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:36.420]
Well, Frank Sileve will say occasionally he'll say that side by each.

[01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:38.180]
I don't, that's a Canadian thing.

[01:32:39.100 --> 01:32:39.460]
It's funny.

[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:40.800]
Instead of saying side by each.

[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:42.340]
Let's remember that song side by each.

[01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.400]
Oh.

[01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:46.780]
Oh, let's see.

[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:51.280]
Judy says the phrase that bugs me the most is sorry about that and have a nice day.

[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:52.920]
They say that even when it's a nightmare.

[01:32:56.340 --> 01:32:58.560]
Who says sorry about that besides Maxwell smart?

[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:06.680]
Are you back in a time or retro that retro?

[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:10.120]
Retread that retro mine state?

[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:13.040]
He's back in the 50s with Bokobryon.

[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:13.860]
Maxwell smart.

[01:33:14.260 --> 01:33:16.020]
Now, thanks, Judy, but I don't think so.

[01:33:16.120 --> 01:33:16.720]
Or God game.

[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:21.180]
I don't know what a, in fact, the side by each to me makes a lot more sense than he got game.

[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.140]
I don't know what that is.

[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.200]
But small ball.

[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.700]
Oh, I'd like to find who would have however invented that piece of crap.

[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:29.920]
Small ball.

[01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:31.960]
I had a friend who had a small ball.

[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:33.960]
One?

[01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:35.000]
One.

[01:33:35.660 --> 01:33:37.420]
Well, he had two, but one of them was small.

[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:40.160]
Oh, I had a friend once who had a large ball.

[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:40.780]
Really?

[01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:41.320]
Yeah.

[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:43.460]
One regular size or one in order.

[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.660]
Elephant kind of like it.

[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.880]
Required some kind of a procedure.

[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:47.680]
I tried.

[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.240]
Anyway, here's one that says good morning, Neil.

[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.480]
And George likes to share my phrases.

[01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:52.280]
Friendly fire.

[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:53.220]
Oh, I like that.

[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.400]
I like that very timely, by the way.

[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:58.720]
Friendly fire.

[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:03.900]
Are you keeping track of all of these or what?

[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:05.940]
By the way, some important stuff going on.

[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:11.000]
That's enough George.

[01:34:11.700 --> 01:34:13.680]
Al Presidente is speaking in front of me.

[01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.360]
Oh, and somebody also had faxed me about

[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.720]
her husband, the insisted that he never spoke with the military outfit on.

[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.320]
Here it is.

[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:21.360]
And we saw it, don't you remember?

[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:22.080]
Sure.

[01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:25.400]
Last week George mentioned the scene George addressed the troop stress and fatigue.

[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.400]
I saw that as well.

[01:34:26.840 --> 01:34:30.760]
When I told my husband, he said Bush would never do that because he never served in a military.

[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.800]
Well, he was, well, he supposedly served in a military.

[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.160]
We were in a jacket with all of the insignia patches.

[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:37.960]
You can't understand George or what?

[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.440]
No, she says George is right.

[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.140]
You're right Betsy.

[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:41.560]
Please keep up the articles.

[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.060]
They're great.

[01:34:42.260 --> 01:34:43.780]
You're the only honest voice out there.

[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:44.320]
We appreciate it.

[01:34:44.340 --> 01:34:44.880]
Thank you, Betsy.

[01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:45.380]
And you were right.

[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.240]
Your husband's full of crap.

[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:47.680]
As usual, I'm sure yours do it.

[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.480]
Friendly fire.

[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:50.220]
Oh, and my nigger.

[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:51.720]
Yeah.

[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:53.000]
Can we put that on there?

[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.100]
Or my nigger dog?

[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:55.160]
No.

[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:56.840]
No, I'm just saying my nigger.

[01:34:58.060 --> 01:34:58.460]
Okay.

[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:01.120]
Can I actually,

[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.260]
no, that's not a phrase.

[01:35:03.460 --> 01:35:05.020]
That's just robbing popular beats.

[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:06.100]
That's just illiteracy, Rob.

[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.080]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:35:07.780 --> 01:35:08.140]
It's illiteracy.

[01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:10.440]
George says a lot of recon say that.

[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:13.800]
They do?

[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:14.460]
Yeah, they do.

[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.520]
Why is that?

[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:16.060]
I don't want to know.

[01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:18.180]
What is this?

[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:21.380]
More terror attacks are imminent wake up America before it's too late.

[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.760]
Please make copies of this flyer in the video.

[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:26.000]
I'll pass it on email it to everybody.

[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.400]
What the hell is this?

[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.620]
Unless we take a stand and get the message out of this,

[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:34.160]
that our government presidents behind these terror attacks

[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.420]
and yada yada yada.

[01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.020]
Oh, brother.

[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:37.680]
Man.

[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:41.040]
Good luck, you sir.

[01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:41.940]
You'll need it.

[01:35:42.900 --> 01:35:43.840]
Here's one that says,

[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:45.220]
please take the time to check.

[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:46.500]
And it's got a website.

[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:47.040]
Thank you.

[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.220]
Developed by Lake Superior State University containing words and phrases

[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.480]
that they want banished from the English language.

[01:35:53.120 --> 01:35:55.980]
They take nominations and publish a yearly list of banned words and phrases.

[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.740]
It's in line with expression to you and what today.

[01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:01.820]
Most sucks in every major way says,

[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:03.460]
Patrick, get him off the air and bring back D-fo.

[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:05.280]
Of course, what can we say about that besides?

[01:36:05.400 --> 01:36:05.820]
All right.

[01:36:06.140 --> 01:36:08.940]
PS, one of my favorites is when an airplane is about to appear for landing.

[01:36:08.940 --> 01:36:13.360]
They make an announcement to the effect that we are about to make our initial landing.

[01:36:13.620 --> 01:36:14.860]
No, that's not what they say, Patrick.

[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:18.040]
They say we're making our initial approach into the Miami area.

[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.800]
Initial, my ass, how many landings does a plane make?

[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:22.060]
I've never heard them say that.

[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.680]
So maybe they're just a stone, Patrick.

[01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:25.440]
They say we're making our initial approach.

[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:29.520]
Which means you're starting to descend is what it means.

[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:30.860]
I know my flyen, man.

[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:33.960]
Believe me, I've traveled a few flights in my time.

[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.760]
And of course, when that starts, your ears start popping a little bit.

[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:39.600]
Yeah.

[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.220]
And you hope that they stay in the popped open position.

[01:36:42.660 --> 01:36:44.840]
I'm trying to figure out if my left ear is actually open or closed.

[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.640]
I think it's been closed for so long,

[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:47.560]
and I'm just used to it.

[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:48.400]
You know what I mean?

[01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.720]
You don't shoot gum as a rule, do you know?

[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:56.260]
I'm bigger part than you.

[01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:56.900]
I tried that.

[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:57.480]
It doesn't work.

[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:58.700]
I tried that.

[01:36:58.700 --> 01:36:59.740]
That's your good list.

[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:01.400]
Pretty good stuff though.

[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.040]
What is it?

[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:04.780]
What kind of going to not try it and try it and it's awful?

[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.280]
It begins with the EEX.

[01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:08.120]
It puts what is that stuff?

[01:37:08.440 --> 01:37:08.700]
Extra.

[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:09.960]
Is that what it is?

[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:10.920]
Oh, that's good.

[01:37:11.140 --> 01:37:12.720]
Of course, my problem is I'll chew the whole pack.

[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:15.440]
Just like when I was a kid and used to get baseball cards,

[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:24.040]
and they all had the real, the flat slabs of gum that were like the coated white powdered sugar.

[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:26.140]
I mean, just right nasty, nasty.

[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:27.320]
The cheapest gum.

[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:28.180]
Hardest metal.

[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:32.140]
Right, and you felt obligated because you were divided like a die-mm-fak

[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.000]
for a pay baseball card.

[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:35.740]
You felt obligated to chew the gum.

[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:37.140]
You used to have thrown it out.

[01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.880]
So you'd wind up with a whole mouthful of it.

[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:40.220]
No.

[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.540]
It's awful nasty.

[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:42.120]
Right?

[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:45.540]
You use felt obligated because you were spent like a die-mm-fak

[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.420]
for a pay baseball card.

[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:49.160]
You felt obligated to chew the gum.

[01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:50.520]
You used refill the gum and throw it out.

[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:53.280]
So you'd wind up with a whole mouthful of it.

[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:54.960]
No, this awful nasty.

[01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:55.280]
the

[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.460]
kind of like to an unsteal cotton candy.

[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:00.260]
All the way, do like cotton candy.

[01:38:00.900 --> 01:38:02.900]
Do you have many years since I've had cotton candy?

[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:04.040]
I sure cotton to have some of them.

[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:04.440]
Been there buns?

[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:08.280]
Are they going to put a press release out when they actually add in their...

[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:09.480]
No, they're just going to surprise you.

[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:10.120]
Sneak up on you.

[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:12.080]
How about shocking awe?

[01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:12.840]
Somebody says.

[01:38:14.460 --> 01:38:17.720]
We only heard that this one time and it was once too many.

[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.060]
I guess the enemy.

[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:21.760]
Him?

[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.080]
Army Marine Divisions.

[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:25.620]
Engaging the enemy.

[01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.680]
Yeah, I just keep saying it over and over again.

[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:30.400]
Yeah, this is cute.

[01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:33.320]
It's about the boy saying how I'm Blair.

[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:35.480]
What proof do you have the Iraq has weapons of mass destruction?

[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.400]
We kept the receipts.

[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:44.140]
By the way, Tony Blair says that it will be the Iraqi people that are going to run their government once this conflict is over.

[01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:49.000]
He said there is no way that it ought to be Americans or British people.

[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.720]
And of course, as you know,

[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:54.720]
isn't it on today's bedtime stories that what about the right wing general,

[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.880]
the good friend of Bush and the Orlando guy?

[01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.540]
The Orlando guy.

[01:38:59.880 --> 01:39:02.560]
Yeah, it's in one of the stories.

[01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.480]
I mean, that's not the specific story, but it's in there.

[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:06.260]
So read all the bedtime stories from Pillar to Post.

[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.700]
The occupational governor?

[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:10.720]
Yeah, the occupational dictator.

[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:12.720]
I mean, whatever he's going to be.

[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.940]
Yes, of our puppet Iraq.

[01:39:15.260 --> 01:39:16.100]
Well, it was in there.

[01:39:16.220 --> 01:39:18.120]
Whatever. Just don't start getting picky.

[01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:21.740]
When you've got 6,000 stories, how not going to roll far like me keep them straight?

[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.480]
And straight into my vocabulary anyway. So just cut the crap.

[01:39:25.020 --> 01:39:26.140]
Well, I have this friend of mine.

[01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:31.660]
If it's a friend, it's a friend of yours, you idiot. Not a friend of mine.

[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.260]
I have this friend of mine, but that's... I don't know if anybody said it.

[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:35.860]
No, George don't like that one.

[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.040]
Don't take it personal. George don't like it. He's a hard-ass.

[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:41.960]
He's an old dog.

[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:46.880]
The mad dog. The big dog. The little dog. The crazy dog. The dog pound.

[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.320]
And that's a sports thing, too, besides being a punk thing.

[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:53.020]
It's also, of course, a sports thing, all the macho guys.

[01:39:55.080 --> 01:39:57.180]
Every sports guy's got to be the dog.

[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.460]
As opposed to... we only have one guy who needs the dog.

[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:00.720]
And that's the hammer.

[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.460]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.240]
I've known Hank for about 100 years and quite I've said this before.

[01:40:06.440 --> 01:40:10.820]
And it's not a knock, but I never quite frankly thought of Hank as the hammer.

[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:12.280]
You know what I mean?

[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.980]
That's why I call him the Humper.

[01:40:13.980 --> 01:40:16.340]
Because it seems...

[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:17.300]
Trafe.

[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.700]
But everybody else is a dog.

[01:40:21.900 --> 01:40:22.740]
Right. You know what I mean?

[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.280]
In fact, if you ever heard our morning show.

[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.660]
Anyway, here's the fact that this is...

[01:40:26.660 --> 01:40:32.060]
If you noticed a recent directive from someone that I'll journalist now refer to homicide bombers in place of suicide bombers.

[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:34.060]
Humicide bombers.

[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:35.160]
Some people...

[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:36.220]
That started a few months ago.

[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.820]
Because the president decided that they should be called a homicomical bombers.

[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:47.280]
The citizens of Iraq are coming to know what kind of people we have sent to liberate them.

[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:48.820]
Oh no!

[01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:49.980]
Yeah.

[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:52.740]
Not the ones who blew the heads off those little girls.

[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:53.480]
He's starting up again.

[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.460]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:59.380]
Not the ones who are dropping these gigantic bombs and the dropping bombs on maternity wards and things like that.

[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:03.160]
And it says, what about that journalistic term, went missing?

[01:41:03.840 --> 01:41:08.220]
As a child disappears and reappears, the child is declared as a went missing child.

[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:09.860]
Kind of like, really a Wilson.

[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:10.840]
Anybody seen her lately?

[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.720]
No. She went missing.

[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.940]
No, that's okay, but it's not true.

[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.920]
I mean, the list will be too lengthy if we have 50,000 them on there.

[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.940]
But you keep working on it.

[01:41:21.500 --> 01:41:23.480]
Oh, look at that. Eric's already got him a going on there.

[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:24.940]
He's already building a list.

[01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:26.700]
Thank God we got the internet back.

[01:41:27.420 --> 01:41:28.680]
What are you looking at me like that for?

[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:30.480]
What are you giving me an evil-doer look?

[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.020]
Carlos.

[01:41:32.020 --> 01:41:32.580]
America.

[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:36.740]
Oh, the phrase that bugs me the most on this fact, Judy says.

[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:39.440]
Sorry, oh, I already did this.

[01:41:40.140 --> 01:41:40.880]
Sorry, Judy.

[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.700]
I don't want to embarrass you twice.

[01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:46.940]
Couple for the pool from John in Port Saint-Lucy.

[01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:48.560]
Friendly fire got it.

[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.020]
And I guess the two little girls' heads qualify as collateral damage.

[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.240]
Oh, yeah.

[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:54.200]
That's a good one, man.

[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.960]
That's a good one, John.

[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.440]
Collateral damage.

[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:00.760]
Remember what Tim McVeigh said,

[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:03.880]
but all those people he blew up making his statement.

[01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:07.480]
Acceptable collateral damage.

[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:08.460]
It says from John,

[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:09.940]
there was a talking head on CNN today.

[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:13.460]
We'll take over the oil fields, but only until the war and reconstruction are paid for.

[01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:14.880]
We don't want to make a profit.

[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:18.000]
I guess you forgot to clear a statement with Halliburton and with Dick Cheney.

[01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.280]
And all the other Dickson and White House.

[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:19.620]
Right.

[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.260]
Oh, and the Ukraine.

[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:22.040]
Did you see that?

[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:23.380]
Now they want in.

[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:29.220]
There was a story on MSNBC if they have almost plots in my pants about the Ukrainians.

[01:42:29.240 --> 01:42:32.440]
They want in because they've got, they want to get on the oil deals.

[01:42:32.840 --> 01:42:33.440]
They want to slice.

[01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:37.180]
They've got all these, yeah, they want to get the oil deal going.

[01:42:38.100 --> 01:42:39.280]
Let's see, diddo, diddo, diddo.

[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.300]
Did we do that?

[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:42.840]
We did yada, yada, yada.

[01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.400]
The only people say diddo, diddo, diddo.

[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.880]
Or a limbal crowd that diddo heads.

[01:42:48.060 --> 01:42:50.240]
We don't associate with them, so thank you, but no thanks.

[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.020]
Diddo, diddo.

[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:52.520]
For the list, awesome.

[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.360]
We already got that.

[01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:56.080]
Got awesome.

[01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.120]
Oh, man.

[01:42:59.660 --> 01:43:00.440]
What an undertaking.

[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:02.200]
As they say at Lithgow.

[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:05.500]
A couple of more letters from the Aheraldis morning.

[01:43:07.860 --> 01:43:10.800]
From Christine Marquette since you just talked about Halliburton.

[01:43:10.900 --> 01:43:15.700]
It says, on March 25th it was revealed that Halliburton, which Dick Cheney headed before we coming vice president,

[01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:17.720]
was given the contract to work on the oil fields in Iraq.

[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:21.280]
Have Americans become so brainwashed that political corruption doesn't matter?

[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:21.800]
Yes.

[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:26.000]
The people who believe this war is about power, money, and oil are only having their beliefs confirmed.

[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.600]
How many more arrogant violations of the public trust is going to take before everyone understands that they've been had?

[01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:32.800]
How many more is it going to take?

[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:33.760]
About 30 minutes.

[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:35.120]
Just Christine and for Lauderdale.

[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.980]
Right on, Christine, I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:37.880]
Good letters, see.

[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.780]
Maybe I had a little bit of impact after those three obnoxious letters.

[01:43:42.300 --> 01:43:43.840]
About protesting the protesters.

[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.700]
After I read those on you last Friday, I want to take a little credit for them.

[01:43:47.700 --> 01:43:49.120]
Having a little bit of impact, probably not.

[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:50.540]
I will take credit anyway.

[01:43:50.860 --> 01:43:51.300]
You go, girl.

[01:43:51.700 --> 01:43:51.920]
Okay.

[01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.640]
1058 at 560 WQAM.

[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.320]
Ciao, Aaron's coming.

[01:44:20.020 --> 01:44:23.720]
I'm going to take a little credit for them.

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.720]

[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:23.880]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:24.020]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:24.700]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:26.560]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:27.300]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:40.780]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:48.700]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:48.920]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:48.920]

[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:48.940]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:48.940]

[01:44:48.940 --> 01:44:49.000]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:49.040]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:49.040 --> 01:44:49.300]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:49.300]

[01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:49.320]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:49.380]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:53.920]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.220]
I'm going to sweetheart.

[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:01.380]
We'll be restored once Shnity be restored once Shny day."

[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.220]
Skillful peopleists.

[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:04.400]
SP JYE

[01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:15.240]
The Bush talked tell them to dissolve their sows

[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:24.800]
with a ball that by death

[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:35.560]
It's 11.02 at 5.60 WQM the extended

[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.500]
the Alice at Dolphin, Marlon pregame show.

[01:45:38.740 --> 01:45:40.200]
Well the dolphins have a forearm pregame show,

[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:41.120]
why can't the Marlon's right?

[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:42.740]
Sure, why not?

[01:45:42.940 --> 01:45:44.940]
What's the difference between one big fish and another one?

[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.100]
Except of course the Marlon's have balls.

[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:50.740]
Here's the facts, very good point by the way in this fact is,

[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:53.260]
is how can they keep the SARS cases in Florida confidential?

[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.680]
I saw that on the news yesterday and I thought to myself,

[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.320]
why can't you tell us where these two people are?

[01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:00.340]
Another three by the way.

[01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:02.020]
Why can't you tell us where these two people are?

[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.640]
Everybody else like in Toronto,

[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:06.440]
they tell you like at Scarborough Hospital in Yorkville Hospital

[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:08.720]
and in this neighborhood and where, and where we're going to hell else.

[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:12.240]
And every place else in the world about that apartment building in Hong Kong

[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.040]
where most of it broke out in the hotel.

[01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.640]
How come in Florida, well, confidentiality we,

[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:20.220]
of course the public wants to know what parts of the state

[01:46:20.220 --> 01:46:21.480]
these are cases came out.

[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:24.780]
It says a coworker of mine is out sick with similar symptoms here.

[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.040]
Oh, I don't want to get you nervous if a coworker uses out.

[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:31.500]
I'd be real nervous if I were you.

[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.160]
Not nice.

[01:46:32.940 --> 01:46:35.340]
97 to 98% survival rate by the way,

[01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:39.040]
the only people who've died from SARS are people like mostly elderly.

[01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:40.420]
There's been one guy who was 44,

[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:43.320]
but mostly elderly people who've had other serious health problems.

[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:44.780]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:46:45.140 --> 01:46:47.620]
In fact, the survival rate on SARS is much better than pneumonia.

[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.820]
So don't get all panicky, okay?

[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:51.920]
We got enough other things to get panicky about.

[01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.280]
The truth is you just heard it.

[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:55.020]
Like that president we just saw on air speaking.

[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.500]
I'm fixing to do whatever.

[01:46:58.740 --> 01:47:00.940]
So Jack, I'm fixing to Southern term.

[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.900]
I'm fixing to go and take a good dump.

[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:07.320]
I'm fixing to call Gilbert back and bus does hate it.

[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:09.780]
Good, I'm fixing to like go in to take the states attorney there

[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:11.400]
and just stick his foot up Gilbert's ass.

[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.740]
By the way, what's Gilbert's fax number?

[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:15.400]
And he's lonely today, is that what you're telling me?

[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:16.020]
Yeah.

[01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:19.400]
What the hell is the word I do with it?

[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.780]
What word I do with it?

[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:21.620]
305.

[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:25.000]
I don't got it.

[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:26.020]
You got it?

[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.780]
I got it.

[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:30.640]
You don't got it?

[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.080]
Who's got it?

[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:34.740]
388.

[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:36.320]
305, 388.

[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.480]
3252 this time.

[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:40.120]
3252 is this a different number?

[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.080]
Oh, let's give it again slowly then.

[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:44.440]
One, 305.

[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:45.780]
I mean 305.

[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:46.620]
388.

[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:49.120]
3252.

[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:50.220]
3252.

[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:53.840]
The anxious Gilbert calling into using obscenities on the phone.

[01:47:55.960 --> 01:48:00.140]
Jackass, Simpleton, Retardo, Misfit, Scumbag.

[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:03.200]
How long is it going to take?

[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.820]
Will this radio station, I mean clearance?

[01:48:04.940 --> 01:48:07.160]
We do him a big favor, he came in here and asked a little bit of a favor,

[01:48:07.300 --> 01:48:08.120]
we took care of it, didn't we?

[01:48:08.180 --> 01:48:08.440]
Yes.

[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.660]
Do us a favor, okay?

[01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.200]
Go get this guy and time.

[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:13.380]
I'll put a guy to put some duct tape on his push.

[01:48:14.180 --> 01:48:14.800]
There you go.

[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.700]
Oh, that's an excellent idea.

[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:18.080]
All you people wondering what you're going to do with your leftover duct tape,

[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.560]
the Tom Ridge, Tuddy DeGroatin, Vi with your vis queen.

[01:48:22.540 --> 01:48:25.200]
The pool, what does it say the pool is down again?

[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:26.960]
What is he doing?

[01:48:27.340 --> 01:48:28.540]
What is this man doing?

[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:30.360]
Our thing is working on his end.

[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.220]
What is with Eric?

[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.320]
Maybe he just means, I don't know what he's doing.

[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:35.940]
That makes a bunch of us.

[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:37.060]
Because I already voted.

[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:38.860]
There were a few smattering of votes starting on there.

[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.180]
What, where did the beener boy go?

[01:48:41.300 --> 01:48:42.480]
Is he taking a dump or something?

[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:44.100]
I don't know.

[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:44.940]
See that?

[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:47.820]
Again, just mention the name and he flew in the door.

[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:49.780]
Hi psychic powers.

[01:48:50.040 --> 01:48:52.220]
I'm going to go home and start my own psychic network.

[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:53.680]
Screwed him as Leo bitch, okay?

[01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:54.580]
Screwed him as Leo.

[01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:55.560]
We'll get you a crystal ball.

[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:56.780]
I got crystal balls.

[01:48:56.780 --> 01:48:57.700]
Go with your small ball.

[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.720]
In fact, that's our new slogan here, QA.

[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:01.140]
And we got crystal balls, baby.

[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.460]
And Donna Shalayla into happy about it.

[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:06.540]
Here's Pembroke Park.

[01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:06.840]
Hello.

[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:07.720]
Hey, New York.

[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:08.480]
All right.

[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:11.900]
The one that annoys me the most is if you're going to talk to talk,

[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.080]
you better walk the walk.

[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:13.620]
Yeah.

[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.240]
And that one annoys me the most.

[01:49:15.360 --> 01:49:15.620]
Okay.

[01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:16.160]
Thank you.

[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.060]
And don't forget if you're going to walk the walk.

[01:49:18.440 --> 01:49:19.160]
Walk the plank.

[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:23.100]
I mean, that's okay, but it's not.

[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.000]
It doesn't make the list.

[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:26.040]
I guess I'm going to clarify.

[01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:27.620]
The pull is down.

[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:28.200]
He puts in.

[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.480]
Now, what is he trying to convey to me?

[01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:30.280]
What is he trying to say?

[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.040]
In other words, the pull is down.

[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.940]
In other words, he's still building it or he's got a problem.

[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:35.000]
What's the story up there?

[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:35.180]
I don't know.

[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:37.320]
Is he having a problem with lunch?

[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:38.960]
Is he having a problem with lunch again?

[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.220]
That's the intermediate.

[01:49:40.300 --> 01:49:41.160]
Is his lunch down?

[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.540]
Let me be down his pants.

[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.920]
Are you the three of you going to start again?

[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:47.720]
Because I'm going to get a little one.

[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:48.040]
Here's the one.

[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:52.360]
If you and Eric and Carlos start that damn three way of crap starting

[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:53.260]
and anything but you.

[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:54.180]
What do you mean by that?

[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:55.760]
I just asked a simple question.

[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:58.140]
And we're trying to answer you and you're just busting Eric's chops.

[01:49:58.140 --> 01:49:59.040]
Well, I'm trying to answer you.

[01:49:59.300 --> 01:50:00.520]
Are you defending Eric now?

[01:50:00.540 --> 01:50:00.720]
No.

[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:01.900]
That will never happen.

[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:02.100]
No.

[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:06.660]

[02:24:17.700 --> 02:24:22.460]
it came as a shock to most Americans accustomed to thinking of the service colleges as bastions

[02:24:22.460 --> 02:24:26.980]
of the very best but for those familiar with sexual assault in the military and the role of women

[02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:31.560]
in the armed forces the horrifying stories had an inevitable tinge of the same old same old

[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:35.400]
and the administration reaction of distress and the determination to make things right

[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:41.260]
had the set of both hyperbole and hypocrisy these are there are surely soldiers who think that

[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:45.900]
this moment with soldiers in the Iraqi desert and internationally unpopular war being waged by the

[02:24:45.900 --> 02:24:49.760]
u.s. may not be the best time to talk about the institutionalized prejudice in the nation's

[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:55.520]
fighting forces but it is exactly the right times as anna in times of peace the powers that be

[02:24:55.520 --> 02:24:59.420]
may conveniently forget how many women there are now on the battlefield how hard they work and how

[02:24:59.420 --> 02:25:04.080]
well they perform like Jessica right military leaders may forget that if the number of women

[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:07.080]
willing to win list drops significantly the ability of women to defend itself will drop

[02:25:07.080 --> 02:25:11.560]
significantly too and they may forget how terrible it is that women who must face sexual assault

[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:16.260]
from the enemy as the price of war to often expect to face it from their compatriots in peace time

[02:25:16.820 --> 02:25:20.460]
as a colonel in the Air Force whose daughter says she was attacked by a fellow cadet told the

[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:25.260]
New York Times she knew she could have been captured by an enemy raped and pillaged in war she

[02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:30.240]
did not expect to be raped and pillaged at the U.S. Air Force Academy in fact no soldiers

[02:25:30.240 --> 02:25:33.980]
should expect to be assaulted by another without significant consequences yet that's what's

[02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:38.900]
happened those who've always been hostile to female soldiers say that this is inevitable given

[02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:43.920]
the atmosphere of spree with which women interfere given about that machismo that's essential for

[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:48.360]
trained fighting forces this is insulting the male soldiers the suggestion is that they're

[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:52.740]
always one beer away from a sexual assault no more able to control their violent impulses than

[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:58.740]
an attack dog the truth is quite different sexual trauma has reached epidemic proportions for

[02:25:58.740 --> 02:26:02.600]
women in the military with numbers twice as high as in the civilian population according to

[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:08.080]
a Department of Defense study because it can the offense is not adequately investigated or punished

[02:26:08.080 --> 02:26:12.580]
and the authority sent down the word by the response in their non-response sit down and shut up

[02:26:13.380 --> 02:26:18.260]
this is not only morally wrong it'll inevitably weaken the country's fighting forces if the word

[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:22.180]
is out that as one young woman is suggested an institution like the Academy is a place where

[02:26:22.180 --> 02:26:26.340]
being sexually assaulted is taken for granted women of intelligence and ambition will look elsewhere

[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:31.600]
the Pentagon is announced that the top officials of the Air Force Academy will be replaced in an

[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:35.640]
effort to change the school's culture but it's the broader military culture that needs to change

[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:40.260]
where women are concerned they know that there's already a khaki ceiling the latter to the top

[02:26:40.260 --> 02:26:44.840]
jobs has to include combat positions it women are still formally prohibited for most combat units

[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:50.320]
this although the lines between deployments is so thin as to be super in my permeable

[02:26:51.780 --> 02:26:57.580]
what do I say semi-permeable got it show shanard johnson now a prisoner of war was sent to a

[02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:01.580]
rack as a cook that was the black guy young lead that we saw with the other prisoners the group

[02:27:01.580 --> 02:27:05.180]
that lobbied for a change in the combat band the defense advisory committee on women and the

[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:09.500]
services has been weakened by the Bush administration swayed by conservative critics who howled

[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:14.340]
about its feminist agenda among the new female forces in the Pentagon is one former master sergeant

[02:27:14.340 --> 02:27:19.540]
who opposes women in combat because women enjoy being protected by men she says that the skills

[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:24.580]
needed for fighting artists survived to escape any aid adding clearly women don't have those as a

[02:27:24.580 --> 02:27:29.160]
rule actually it sounds as if those are exactly the skills women have had to acquire defend off

[02:27:29.160 --> 02:27:33.460]
sexual abuse and harassment by their colleagues many of them have listened with bitterness when the

[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:37.420]
president announcing the start of this war promised the Iraqi people they would be free from rape

[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:41.420]
rooms given the fact that for some of them the rape rooms have been back in their own barracks

[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.360]
as their sisters did in deserts store many will return from the middle east having served in

[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.060]
combat despite the ban with an official wink and a nod maybe it's the same wink and a nod you

[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:54.920]
get after you've been pinned down and penetrated by a fellow cadet the one that says you have to go

[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.300]
along to get along if this is a nation that uses female soldiers to defend us but is unwilling to

[02:28:00.300 --> 02:28:04.720]
defend them in turn the numbers of ambitious women in the service made dwindle that'll satisfy

[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:08.980]
those who hanker for old traditional sex roles it'll also mean a fighting force that has lost

[02:28:08.980 --> 02:28:13.620]
its very best prospects who could blame them sacrificing your life for your country is one thing

[02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:18.960]
sacrificing your body for bureaucratic convenience and anti-deluvian attitudes is something else

[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:25.500]
anti-deluvian to one of those great words right i was doing so well till we got to that

[02:28:25.500 --> 02:28:30.460]
when you get the picture and a quinoa in this week's newsweek pretty ugly picture

[02:31:37.360 --> 02:31:44.080]

[02:31:44.080 --> 02:31:49.060]
elimination they made your move in USA USA come on let's hear us now we're talking

of the very few voices of descent that we've been having around yes sir and uh you've been

[02:32:13.800 --> 02:32:20.920]
doing a tremendous job yes i have uh one one phrase that uh it seems absurd to me it's

[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:28.220]
operation Iraqi freedom yeah i'm not just that's awful that's just like plain uh like almost

[02:32:28.220 --> 02:32:32.500]
worth of a pinot cue i would say i mean how come we never cared about whether these people were

[02:32:32.500 --> 02:32:36.280]
free or not before how come we never cared when he was poisoning the Kurds with a gas we never

[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:41.160]
cared about it then how come we never cared about the uh the uh taliban until all of a sudden 9-11

[02:32:41.160 --> 02:32:44.580]
we didn't care about what they did to the women or the men or anybody else and now it's operation

[02:32:44.580 --> 02:32:49.280]
Iraqi freedom you have to be a moron to believe that the purpose of this is to free the Iraqi people

[02:32:49.280 --> 02:32:54.120]
from oppression absolutely you have to be an imbecile to believe that especially when you know we

[02:32:54.120 --> 02:32:59.280]
put for them saying there we do the weapons that's right and you know what the fact is you know you

[02:32:59.280 --> 02:33:04.500]
you have the song ashamed to be an American yes the fact is that we should have been ashamed of being

[02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:10.420]
American's a long time ago for yet now for Panama for Grenada for a bunch of other places where

[02:33:10.420 --> 02:33:17.600]
and for the middle east right and we deposed we deposed democratically elected leaders we

[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:21.900]
dictate a shift that tortured people don't forget about chili while you're at it by me oh my

[02:33:21.900 --> 02:33:28.620]
goodness argentina and what about the constant support of designees israel that's who you know

[02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:33.740]
they they ran it through over kids the other day i saw a video on tv some some children were

[02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:37.800]
demonstrating about four p's yeah but you gotta understand that area shiro and the people

[02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:42.280]
surround this president are all cut out of the same cloth i agree totally they're in bed together

[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:47.340]
they're embedded together you know it's it's it's pretty sad that you know in this day and age it

[02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:53.020]
seems like we're getting worse and then let's not forget about what's going on in this country you

[02:33:53.020 --> 02:33:58.180]
know like the black you say you know propaganda works extremely well because a lot of people are

[02:33:58.180 --> 02:34:03.100]
just like you know they they're wet the flag in front of them well how about what you just heard

[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:07.440]
from bob arnith there i mean you talk about propaganda that wasn't news reporting that was just

[02:34:07.440 --> 02:34:13.740]
a uh... pepper alley he just had on the around the tv absolutely you know it's

[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:18.680]
propaganda especially if you really look at it it's all made by made by this made phrase like

[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:23.940]
support our troops what the hell does that mean you know i support our troops i want to back by

[02:34:23.940 --> 02:34:28.260]
a midnight i want everyone back by the state of the sound and let them live their lives but i

[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:33.560]
don't know that that's that's pretty realistic and i think you know uh... we have a history of

[02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:39.200]
going around in china's course uh... people who cannot fight back and uh... and you know then

[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:44.480]
we're supposed to be accepted as liberators and people are actually surprised that someone is

[02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:48.100]
is fighting for their country back down in the country and i don't remember the liberation of

[02:34:48.100 --> 02:34:53.080]
Poland and liberation check is the liberation of austria same liberation and i think you know

[02:34:53.720 --> 02:34:58.800]
we have to be extremely careful on the day trying to send them absolutely they trying to pass this

[02:34:58.800 --> 02:35:04.360]
picture act number two here and uh... i think uh... you know we're getting closer and closer to

[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:08.460]
this kind of regimes and people just can't seem to understand it always say well if you have

[02:35:08.460 --> 02:35:13.340]
nothing to hide you shouldn't worry about it but i think that it's very very clear to me that uh... the

[02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:19.740]
bill of rights is being trashed and our constitution is being trashed uh... just you know so that they can

[02:35:19.740 --> 02:35:24.860]
have their cake and eat it too it's really not clear i don't really think that we've been in in a

[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:29.500]
great danger of a terrorist attack i think i think that the government has an interest those

[02:35:29.500 --> 02:35:35.200]
caring people uh... so that they can carry on with their uh... agenda absolutely the plan of

[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:39.120]
conquering the other agenda which was written by the was actually put in writing long before there

[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:44.600]
was a brand new eleven absolutely yeah i'll come on the plan of of Afghanistan was already in place

[02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:50.680]
way before nine eleven yeah this war was way in place way before then i mean uh... you know there

[02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:57.080]

[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:01.880]

all right and when star is dead

[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:06.760]
He's dead.

[03:08:07.980 --> 03:08:08.220]
Bad news.

[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:09.300]
Casey, Mr. Biggie on the show.

[03:08:09.400 --> 03:08:09.960]
He was 61.

[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:10.940]
That of a heart attack.

[03:08:11.080 --> 03:08:11.580]
Edwin star.

[03:08:12.760 --> 03:08:13.680]
But why don't you play a war?

[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:14.580]
What we did play a little bit?

[03:08:14.660 --> 03:08:17.140]
Then they'll assume we're doing like an anti-war message, which we would be.

[03:08:17.480 --> 03:08:17.780]
And we did.

[03:08:19.640 --> 03:08:21.520]
Here's some pushing the envelope.

[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:23.680]
That doesn't bother me.

[03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:24.460]
Does that bother you?

[03:08:24.920 --> 03:08:26.440]
I don't hear that much anymore.

[03:08:26.820 --> 03:08:28.000]
Like an old NASA type.

[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:28.600]
How they hanging?

[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:30.200]
Whatever.

[03:08:31.100 --> 03:08:31.680]
Oh, sorry.

[03:08:32.540 --> 03:08:32.880]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:32.880]

[03:08:32.880 --> 03:08:32.880]

[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:36.140]
To be honest with you,

[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:37.580]
girlfriend.

[03:08:37.780 --> 03:08:40.900]
I thought we had a bit called how they hanging.

[03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:42.060]
What does that call it?

[03:08:42.120 --> 03:08:42.940]
How's it hanging maybe?

[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:44.120]
How's it hanging?

[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:44.600]
I don't know.

[03:08:44.860 --> 03:08:45.120]
No.

[03:08:45.980 --> 03:08:49.780]
I thought for sure we had what's that out in the sun, but I was just looking for it.

[03:08:50.700 --> 03:08:51.620]
How's it hanging?

[03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:53.720]
Oh, Chris.

[03:08:54.220 --> 03:08:55.840]
I put you.

[03:08:58.320 --> 03:08:59.140]
How's it hanging?

[03:09:00.500 --> 03:09:04.640]
How come it's not in here at Otterby?

[03:09:05.140 --> 03:09:05.380]
It's not.

[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:07.160]
I don't see it at all.

[03:09:07.160 --> 03:09:07.740]
I love you.

[03:09:08.960 --> 03:09:10.020]
Oh, you're bad.

[03:09:10.680 --> 03:09:11.400]
My bad.

[03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:13.680]
Let's see CNN's theme music.

[03:09:13.680 --> 03:09:14.360]
How would it do with that?

[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:15.280]
It's not a sing.

[03:09:15.500 --> 03:09:16.640]
It's just nauseating.

[03:09:16.740 --> 03:09:17.720]
Of course, Bob Arna.

[03:09:17.800 --> 03:09:20.660]
They are so well organized, but close in.

[03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:21.880]
You hear all these stories about that?

[03:09:21.880 --> 03:09:22.460]
You know something?

[03:09:22.660 --> 03:09:27.700]
This is just between Angela Ray on Channel 4 yesterday.

[03:09:28.220 --> 03:09:29.120]
And his performance is just amazing.

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.120 --> 03:09:29.120]

[03:09:29.540 --> 03:09:31.860]
I have never in my life heard anything.

[03:09:32.380 --> 03:09:34.500]
This is...get the pom-poms out.

[03:09:34.780 --> 03:09:35.700]
Let's have a parade.

[03:09:36.180 --> 03:09:37.780]
Everything is coming up roses.

[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:40.420]
Let's get Steve Lawrence and Edie Grume out to sing it.

[03:09:40.780 --> 03:09:43.760]
And what could not be...what's not to like?

[03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:46.840]
So you thought World War II was a good war where everybody came together.

[03:09:47.120 --> 03:09:48.160]
They played part of this stuff.

[03:09:48.740 --> 03:09:53.160]
Many of the battle damage assessments from close to well fought lots and lots of weapons.

[03:09:53.700 --> 03:09:54.860]
After the war they thought they hit.

[03:09:55.220 --> 03:09:55.940]
Well, we found that too.

[03:09:56.560 --> 03:09:59.720]
I thought just a little while ago when they first had a amount of half an hour ago,

[03:09:59.720 --> 03:10:01.260]
we were listening to the bullets flying overhead.

[03:10:01.260 --> 03:10:02.780]
There was like a battle going on.

[03:10:02.860 --> 03:10:03.600]
And a tank blew up.

[03:10:03.940 --> 03:10:03.940]

[03:10:04.360 --> 03:10:05.560]
I must have...

[03:10:05.560 --> 03:10:07.520]
But I guess that was just an isolated incident.

[03:10:08.920 --> 03:10:15.240]
Because according to him, you look up the road and there's nobody but a friendly people there with smiles and their thumbs up and the peace sign.

[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:15.660]
Oh, that's right.

[03:10:15.960 --> 03:10:16.800]
Don't do the peace sign.

[03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:17.020]
Don't wait.

[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:18.800]
And on your racket, don't do the peace sign.

[03:10:19.060 --> 03:10:20.500]
Don't do the peace sign.

[03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:22.880]
You're not allowed to do the peace sign because that means you were a protester.

[03:10:23.460 --> 03:10:24.880]
Kami Pinko 60s hippie.

[03:10:27.280 --> 03:10:30.120]
So you think the Marlins are going to play a long ball or a small ball today?

[03:10:32.140 --> 03:10:32.500]
Goofball?

[03:10:32.780 --> 03:10:32.920]
Yeah.

[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:34.720]
Excellent.

[03:10:35.200 --> 03:10:36.600]
Marlins are playing Goofball today.

[03:10:36.720 --> 03:10:39.240]
And we got it here for you on your Goofball station QAM.

[03:10:40.880 --> 03:10:41.240]
Goofball.

[03:10:41.420 --> 03:10:44.200]
Speaking of Dave and Boring and his bad, bad hair piece.

[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:47.340]
Hey Dave, I never met you, but God, you are boring on here.

[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:50.420]
And the sad part of this, he's got a really good voice.

[03:10:50.640 --> 03:10:51.700]
You know, he's got an excellent voice.

[03:10:52.360 --> 03:10:53.760]
But until he starts talking.

[03:10:55.600 --> 03:10:56.360]
Kind of like Mo.

[03:10:56.740 --> 03:10:57.800]
Mo's got a great voice too.

[03:10:57.920 --> 03:10:59.000]
Until he starts speaking, you know.

[03:11:00.300 --> 03:11:01.660]
And once he starts talking, he's like.

[03:11:02.540 --> 03:11:02.900]
Boring.

[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:03.520]
Boring.

[03:11:03.760 --> 03:11:04.120]
Boring.

[03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:04.720]
Boring.

[03:11:04.940 --> 03:11:05.300]
Boring.

[03:11:05.380 --> 03:11:05.740]
Boring.

[03:11:06.300 --> 03:11:06.660]
Boring.

[03:11:08.460 --> 03:11:09.360]
Enough to drive your nuts.

[03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:12.260]
The most overused expression in the last two years,

[03:11:12.860 --> 03:11:15.120]
imported from the English at the end of the day.

[03:11:15.180 --> 03:11:16.140]
Well, we just wrote that down.

[03:11:16.200 --> 03:11:16.500]
Thank you.

[03:11:16.540 --> 03:11:17.920]
It must be psychic or the other way around.

[03:11:18.020 --> 03:11:18.340]
Thank you.

[03:11:19.260 --> 03:11:21.020]
Facts is just pouring in here.

[03:11:22.120 --> 03:11:22.940]
Poring in.

[03:11:24.860 --> 03:11:28.200]
Is the Bush administration using terrorism fears to shield government

[03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:32.300]
and business from public view, official secrets from Mother Jones?

[03:11:32.540 --> 03:11:33.440]
Well, I'll save that.

[03:11:33.740 --> 03:11:35.180]
You might actually put it on the website tomorrow.

[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:38.420]
How about, excuse me, says Lenny.

[03:11:38.820 --> 03:11:40.380]
Please say it worded two about the second page.

[03:11:40.980 --> 03:11:41.380]
Second page.

[03:11:41.540 --> 03:11:44.160]
National March, stop the war on Iraq, surround the White House.

[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:45.920]
Saturday, April 12th.

[03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:46.740]
That's a week from the Saturday.

[03:11:46.740 --> 03:11:48.140]
12th, noon in Washington, DC.

[03:11:48.620 --> 03:11:50.220]
Buses to DC from across the US.

[03:11:50.540 --> 03:11:51.420]
Bring the troops home now.

[03:11:51.620 --> 03:11:52.480]
To which we say,

[03:11:52.540 --> 03:11:53.660]
All right.

[03:11:53.860 --> 03:11:54.040]
Yes.

[03:11:55.060 --> 03:11:57.220]
A-N-S-W-E-R answer.

[03:11:57.400 --> 03:11:58.940]
Act now to stop the war and end racism.

[03:12:00.580 --> 03:12:02.200]
And it's a New York organization.

[03:12:02.520 --> 03:12:04.000]
And they got a New York and Washington number.

[03:12:04.500 --> 03:12:05.540]
But you can check it out on the web.

[03:12:07.160 --> 03:12:08.040]
Internationalanswer.org.

[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:10.560]
Internationalanswer.org.

[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:14.740]
National March to stop the war week from Saturday, April 12th.

[03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:15.500]
Okay.

[03:12:15.560 --> 03:12:16.160]
Stick that over there.

[03:12:16.240 --> 03:12:16.860]
We'll mention it again.

[03:12:18.040 --> 03:12:19.760]
Of course, the way it's looking now, quite a bob Arnett.

[03:12:19.780 --> 03:12:20.700]
It's going to be all done by then.

[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:20.860]
Right?

[03:12:20.920 --> 03:12:22.520]
We can bring everybody back safe and sound.

[03:12:22.940 --> 03:12:23.140]
Sure.

[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:25.840]
Hopefully, sounder than progester go ahead, like two broken legs of broken arms.

[03:12:25.840 --> 03:12:26.400]
I don't have 30.

[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:27.040]
Holds in her.

[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:29.200]
Going to bring them back, right?

[03:12:29.460 --> 03:12:29.720]
Okay.

[03:12:29.840 --> 03:12:30.220]
Here's one.

[03:12:30.260 --> 03:12:31.920]
Don't want to argue with you about your opinion on this war.

[03:12:32.740 --> 03:12:33.020]
Good.

[03:12:33.140 --> 03:12:34.860]
Because I'm not interested in arguing with anybody.

[03:12:35.580 --> 03:12:38.100]
I'm here giving my opinion and I, you're not going to change my mind.

[03:12:39.660 --> 03:12:43.620]
I'd have a better chance of getting on a posing point of your expressed on a rally spin zone.

[03:12:43.620 --> 03:12:45.800]
But what the hell, your show isn't about a fair imbalance.

[03:12:45.960 --> 03:12:46.660]
They're strange with the folks.

[03:12:46.820 --> 03:12:48.320]
It's about human political satire.

[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:49.320]
So why this facts?

[03:12:49.520 --> 03:12:51.340]
Good question, from Dear Field Beach.

[03:12:53.100 --> 03:12:54.740]
It's about human political satire.

[03:12:54.820 --> 03:12:56.560]
At this level, no one on radio does it better than you.

[03:12:56.680 --> 03:12:58.900]
Well, Lou, you are absolutely correct.

[03:12:59.140 --> 03:13:00.440]
Or there's not Lou, it's just his love.

[03:13:00.540 --> 03:13:01.020]
That's it, Lou.

[03:13:01.500 --> 03:13:04.500]
This morning, George made another of his mindless comments about current events.

[03:13:05.100 --> 03:13:08.660]
Now, while I avoid him when you're not on the year, it's next to impossible to do so when you're on the year.

[03:13:09.080 --> 03:13:10.920]
Please understand, I'm not trying to criticize your show.

[03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:11.780]
I see.

[03:13:11.960 --> 03:13:13.060]
Understand that George is the price.

[03:13:13.240 --> 03:13:14.900]
I must pay if I'm going to be entertained by you.

[03:13:15.580 --> 03:13:16.820]
Here's a guy that likes you in Dear Field.

[03:13:16.880 --> 03:13:17.240]
I see.

[03:13:17.700 --> 03:13:18.780]
It's a price well worth paying.

[03:13:18.940 --> 03:13:20.140]
I agree because the price is right.

[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:21.240]
But the George is here and out.

[03:13:21.360 --> 03:13:21.980]
It's still cost you.

[03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:22.760]
Oh, nothing.

[03:13:23.760 --> 03:13:24.780]
Not a way if you entertain me.

[03:13:24.940 --> 03:13:27.340]
You've informed me about current events in a way that nobody in local media can.

[03:13:27.500 --> 03:13:28.380]
You've improved my health.

[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:28.760]
Thanks to you.

[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:31.120]
I discovered balance for life and lost 47 pounds so far.

[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:31.760]
Excellent.

[03:13:32.180 --> 03:13:33.120]
So what's not to like?

[03:13:33.460 --> 03:13:34.340]
What's the mindless comments?

[03:13:34.960 --> 03:13:35.840]
I'll get to it.

[03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:36.820]
Oh, you were lasty.

[03:13:36.900 --> 03:13:37.600]
He likes me.

[03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:39.600]
And right away, you're taking that out on this list.

[03:13:39.600 --> 03:13:41.780]
I'm sure who's on name by the way, but lost 47 pounds.

[03:13:41.780 --> 03:13:42.560]
Don't want to be inaccurate.

[03:13:42.940 --> 03:13:50.360]
So when George expresses sympathy for the people of Iraq as he did this morning, I must remember that the gang reflects our experiences in normal response inside of my good health.

[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:53.300]
You may feel the people of Iraq are better off under the rule of thought.

[03:13:53.300 --> 03:13:54.880]
I'm there in this fight to be free.

[03:13:55.060 --> 03:13:55.680]
But I say that.

[03:13:55.880 --> 03:13:57.160]
No, no, wait a minute.

[03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:03.440]
I'm not going to read the rest of it because when he says in this fight to be free, that's the end of my reading because it is not a fight for them to be free.

[03:14:03.540 --> 03:14:04.800]
It has nothing to do with them being free.

[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:06.100]
That's not what this is all about.

[03:14:06.900 --> 03:14:14.340]
This is a guy that's been watching too much of this thing on air, which it says right now in front of me, the Iraqi freedom, you know, Operation Iraqi Freedom.

[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:16.420]
It's not what it's about.

[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:17.820]
If you want to believe that, good luck to you.

[03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:18.780]
I hope you keep losing the weight.

[03:14:18.940 --> 03:14:20.440]
We love you, but you're naive.

[03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:20.940]
That's all.

[03:14:22.220 --> 03:14:23.180]
When did we ever say that?

[03:14:23.560 --> 03:14:29.760]
And like I've been saying, what now you said it's our castically, but what I've been saying, liberation by elimination is correct.

[03:14:30.740 --> 03:14:34.560]
There are hundreds and hundreds of innocent people, including little children who've died.

[03:14:34.960 --> 03:14:37.880]
There are thousands who've been maimed across the country already in two weeks.

[03:14:38.120 --> 03:14:39.700]
Thousands who've been maimed and mutilated.

[03:14:40.820 --> 03:14:43.080]
This is not the way you go about liberating people.

[03:14:43.660 --> 03:14:44.280]
Oh, come on.

[03:14:44.580 --> 03:14:44.980]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[03:14:45.500 --> 03:14:46.320]
I should just shut up though.

[03:14:46.420 --> 03:14:52.440]
And then that's the reason Tony Blair, all of a sudden, got a loud mouth yesterday and said, no, it's not the US or the British that ought to be in there taking over.

[03:14:52.740 --> 03:14:54.540]
It better be the Iraqi people themselves.

[03:14:55.180 --> 03:15:00.620]
And in the meantime, we've been reading of these articles and putting on our website every day about how they already have their ducks in a row.

[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:06.260]
They've already got their right wing general to take things over and run the country while they get their agenda going over there.

[03:15:06.380 --> 03:15:07.820]
Well, he's just going to supervise me.

[03:15:07.820 --> 03:15:11.900]
I mean, how could anybody really believe that all of a sudden out of nowhere see they kept changing it?

[03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.100]
First, it was about weapons of mass destruction.

[03:15:14.260 --> 03:15:14.940]
We couldn't find any.

[03:15:15.060 --> 03:15:16.900]
Okay, now it's about regime change.

[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:19.720]
Well, you can't just go into another country and change the leader.

[03:15:20.040 --> 03:15:20.520]
I'll just arre.

[03:15:20.520 --> 03:15:23.000]
So now it's about operation of Iraqi freedom.

[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:25.500]
We're going to liberate those poor oppressed Iraqi people.

[03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:29.800]
Well, if we're going to liberate all the poor oppressed people all over the world, we're going to be pretty guy and busy.

[03:15:30.480 --> 03:15:32.660]
You weren't going to have two nickels to rub together anymore.

[03:15:34.420 --> 03:15:40.840]
Like I said, it's like the little old lady crossing the street and being dragged across the street by the boy scout doing his good deed for the day.

[03:15:40.840 --> 03:15:42.020]
And she says, dammit, leave me alone.

[03:15:42.020 --> 03:15:43.360]
He says, how come I'm doing my good deed?

[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:45.180]
And she says, I don't want to cross this street.

[03:15:45.780 --> 03:15:46.140]
Asshole.

[03:15:47.300 --> 03:15:48.960]
They didn't ask us to come there.

[03:15:50.080 --> 03:15:55.220]
They don't trust us in spite of whatever Bob Barnett is saying this crap he's peddling they with his pompom.

[03:15:55.220 --> 03:15:56.500]
He must be on jungle juice.

[03:15:56.860 --> 03:15:57.480]
He must be.

[03:15:57.820 --> 03:15:59.420]
I've never heard anything like that.

[03:16:00.120 --> 03:16:06.680]
And when you combine that with the raw raw rooting thing we had from Andrea, whatever her name is.

[03:16:06.860 --> 03:16:07.360]
What's your name?

[03:16:08.280 --> 03:16:08.500]
I forgot.

[03:16:09.220 --> 03:16:09.500]
Gates.

[03:16:10.040 --> 03:16:12.320]
And I know what that channel for news, the silly one.

[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:13.200]
What I forgot her name was.

[03:16:13.560 --> 03:16:14.140]
Angela Ray.

[03:16:14.340 --> 03:16:15.540]
Sorry, I'll decide on my bad.

[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:16.480]
My bad.

[03:16:17.220 --> 03:16:18.640]
I'll never watch their news again.

[03:16:19.060 --> 03:16:22.820]
If I want to watch a parade, I'll watch the Macy's parade.

[03:16:22.960 --> 03:16:25.680]
If I want to watch a cheerleading thing, I'll turn on a cable.

[03:16:25.860 --> 03:16:26.860]
I'll find cheerleading contest.

[03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:31.820]
If I want to watch the news, I want to see a performance like that pitch put on there yesterday.

[03:16:31.980 --> 03:16:33.740]
And their whole five o'clock newscast was like that.

[03:16:36.420 --> 03:16:39.360]
There's a difference between news reporting and cheerleading.

[03:16:39.640 --> 03:16:44.820]
And sure we all want the US to win whatever there is to win so we can get it over with fast.

[03:16:44.820 --> 03:16:47.860]
And bring our troops home and not butcher up any more people.

[03:16:48.700 --> 03:16:53.460]
A lot of us are very suspicious of what this administration has planned for what's going to follow.

[03:16:53.900 --> 03:16:58.120]
And you'll notice the Brits also Jack Strav very quick to say yesterday, uh, guess what?

[03:16:58.240 --> 03:17:00.240]
We're not participating in Syria or Iran.

[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:01.620]
Count us out.

[03:17:02.580 --> 03:17:03.980]
We don't think the US is either.

[03:17:04.180 --> 03:17:06.320]
But just in case they are, we don't think so.

[03:17:06.440 --> 03:17:06.680]
No way.

[03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:08.180]
Enough is enough.

[03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:10.480]
How about pardon our dust?

[03:17:11.320 --> 03:17:12.100]
That's a good expression.

[03:17:12.100 --> 03:17:15.940]
In fact, stores that are like, you know, no, that's the airport.

[03:17:16.260 --> 03:17:19.520]
You always see that, especially here airports always in the state of flux.

[03:17:20.760 --> 03:17:21.400]
Excuse me.

[03:17:21.660 --> 03:17:21.960]
Flux.

[03:17:22.220 --> 03:17:24.620]
Oh, in some of the flux radio theater.

[03:17:26.260 --> 03:17:32.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and T in Verizon wireless line on a wild Thursday, man.

[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:34.700]
Feel like I had a wild hair up my back.

[03:17:34.800 --> 03:17:35.840]
Today for some reason.

[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:36.580]
I don't know what it is.

[03:17:37.840 --> 03:17:41.780]
49 votes for weapons of mass destruction is the expression that bugs you the most.

[03:17:42.360 --> 03:17:43.260]
You go, girlfriend.

[03:17:43.520 --> 03:17:43.960]
43.

[03:17:46.300 --> 03:17:48.520]
Uh, don't even go there.

[03:17:48.680 --> 03:17:49.080]
25.

[03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:50.380]
What's your take 25?

[03:17:51.460 --> 03:17:52.120]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:17:52.320 --> 03:17:52.740]
24.

[03:17:53.080 --> 03:17:54.000]
My nigga 21.

[03:17:54.900 --> 03:17:56.160]
My bad 18.

[03:17:56.360 --> 03:17:57.140]
Embedded 13.

[03:17:57.540 --> 03:17:58.620]
I'll be honest with you the 13.

[03:17:58.840 --> 03:17:59.820]
You know, 12.

[03:18:00.520 --> 03:18:01.600]
Yada yada yada 11.

[03:18:01.800 --> 03:18:02.380]
Was up dog.

[03:18:02.700 --> 03:18:02.900]
10.

[03:18:03.440 --> 03:18:04.380]
And closure.

[03:18:04.740 --> 03:18:05.020]
10.

[03:18:05.020 --> 03:18:07.080]
We need closure on this.

[03:18:08.460 --> 03:18:10.040]
But we need closure on the war.

[03:18:10.500 --> 03:18:10.500]

[03:18:10.620 --> 03:18:14.900]
Oh, every, I mean, it's not as big now as it was for a while there.

[03:18:15.420 --> 03:18:17.680]
But for a couple of years, it's like everybody in a brother.

[03:18:17.940 --> 03:18:20.740]
Oh, well, maybe this will help us get closure, you know.

[03:18:21.160 --> 03:18:27.920]
Now that we found a chandra's body in 18 million little pieces, you know, the family can get some closure.

[03:18:28.220 --> 03:18:28.380]
Yeah.

[03:18:29.820 --> 03:18:32.520]
And Gary Conde's career can have some closure.

[03:18:32.700 --> 03:18:34.180]
How's Gary Conde doing, by the way?

[03:18:34.180 --> 03:18:35.200]
I won't see him no more.

[03:18:35.860 --> 03:18:38.360]
13 to 1 at 560 WQAM.

[03:18:47.020 --> 03:18:52.360]
And now, their wife, son, I'm also having to be his cousin.

[03:18:52.980 --> 03:18:54.180]
Say hi to her, son.

[03:18:54.540 --> 03:18:55.060]
Hello.

[03:18:55.760 --> 03:18:56.500]
Hello, America.

[03:18:57.080 --> 03:18:59.680]
Like, don't cry for me because I'm like hot and all.

[03:18:59.680 --> 03:19:08.660]
You'd think like a slavvnly stinky dick tater like Saadi would have a wife with like a pooch and like facial hair, but I'm like a total babe.

[03:19:08.880 --> 03:19:15.020]
Like when I graduated from like San Vandina Votec, I was voted most likely to and I did.

[03:19:15.540 --> 03:19:17.920]
Like even though I had to tell Saadi, I was like a virgin.

[03:19:18.240 --> 03:19:20.780]
I'm like no stranger to the backseat of a Buick.

[03:19:21.160 --> 03:19:26.960]
For the favors, three revieras, six centuries, two regals, and like one park avenue.

[03:19:27.100 --> 03:19:27.760]
Thank you very much.

[03:19:27.760 --> 03:19:28.980]
That was like my junior year.

[03:19:29.580 --> 03:19:32.560]
So like on our wedding night, I had to be all like, I'm nervous.

[03:19:33.000 --> 03:19:34.140]
Like are you sure we should?

[03:19:34.700 --> 03:19:38.420]
But I'm like a very good actress and all, so he like, thought it totally.

[03:19:38.860 --> 03:19:39.260]
Whatever.

[03:19:39.800 --> 03:19:43.920]
Let me just tell you, like our house, you know, we have like 40 houses.

[03:19:44.120 --> 03:19:48.020]
I felt like the one without any windows is like so like off the hook.

[03:19:48.260 --> 03:19:51.800]
Like if you came here, which like you wouldn't because like no one ever comes here.

[03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:56.500]
But like if you did, you'd be like this house is so like off the hook.

[03:19:56.500 --> 03:20:03.260]
But like I still can't get Saadi to like put away his like velvet Elvis and like the picture of like the dogs playing poker and all.

[03:20:03.400 --> 03:20:05.500]
He's like still holding onto his like youth and what.

[03:20:05.860 --> 03:20:11.780]
Uh, anyhow, like last week I had to have like a female procedure, you know, like done at like the gyno.

[03:20:11.980 --> 03:20:14.780]
And like Saadi was all like don't take your clothes off and whatnot.

[03:20:15.180 --> 03:20:17.240]
And I was all like well how's he supposed to say it?

[03:20:17.360 --> 03:20:19.820]
And he's all like how do you like an X-ray machine?

[03:20:20.440 --> 03:20:22.400]
And I'm like that was just like friggin' it all up.

[03:20:22.400 --> 03:20:23.960]
And he's like I don't care.

[03:20:23.960 --> 03:20:28.780]
Like the next thing I know I hear him like Al Jazeera TV like my gyno is gone.

[03:20:29.100 --> 03:20:30.660]
Oh, I like Bono.

[03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:31.600]
Tuttle.

[03:20:33.240 --> 03:20:35.400]
Procure people we got that big Marlon game coming up.

[03:20:35.500 --> 03:20:37.260]
Everybody in the buildings are excited about that.

[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:38.560]
I bet you everybody bills out.

[03:20:39.060 --> 03:20:39.900]
Huh? Don't you think?

[03:20:40.500 --> 03:20:41.760]
It bills out of what the building?

[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:43.080]
Oh, don't forget five to seven.

[03:20:43.080 --> 03:20:44.280]
We got clearance in the beast together.

[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:46.860]
I bet you they're going to be doing a lot of work together from now on.

[03:20:47.200 --> 03:20:47.500]
Don't you think?

[03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:50.540]
Clarence in the beast a match made in heaven.

[03:20:50.700 --> 03:20:52.200]
Well, neither one of them could get a girl.

[03:20:53.300 --> 03:20:54.200]
Beast has breasts.

[03:20:54.620 --> 03:20:57.480]
So maybe they're just settling for, you know, whatever's available.

[03:20:58.580 --> 03:20:59.260]
Each other.

[03:21:00.960 --> 03:21:02.240]
Think outside the box.

[03:21:03.220 --> 03:21:03.600]
Yes.

[03:21:03.880 --> 03:21:06.300]
I agree that that's annoying, but I don't think it's, you know.

[03:21:07.400 --> 03:21:08.560]
I don't hear so much anymore.

[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:08.840]
No.

[03:21:11.020 --> 03:21:11.980]
Plus in your case.

[03:21:13.520 --> 03:21:15.140]
Outside the box and where you want to be.

[03:21:15.640 --> 03:21:16.540]
No, it's exactly where I want to be.

[03:21:16.560 --> 03:21:17.080]
Pull me one highly.

[03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:18.180]
I say shock and awe.

[03:21:18.660 --> 03:21:18.920]
Yeah.

[03:21:18.920 --> 03:21:22.120]
Why we forget about it already been there.

[03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:26.040]
Done that here's Todd and Holly would chronic Todd was ripping poor booge.

[03:21:26.140 --> 03:21:27.180]
I've lost a lot of weight.

[03:21:27.280 --> 03:21:29.520]
Okay, don't be ripping booge about if they can stay healthy.

[03:21:29.720 --> 03:21:34.080]
And I got a figure he does have a figure when a figure about Bella for good.

[03:21:34.840 --> 03:21:35.480]
Like Joey.

[03:21:35.700 --> 03:21:36.200]
He's been saved.

[03:21:36.700 --> 03:21:37.620]
He's bell shaped.

[03:21:38.020 --> 03:21:39.960]
Also Dwight Lottardale says eat more beagle.

[03:21:39.960 --> 03:21:41.120]
Ass is what's hot in the Hollywood.

[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:41.800]
That's disgusting.

[03:21:41.960 --> 03:21:42.400]
Okay.

[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:44.440]
Dwight Lottardale eats beagle.

[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:45.960]
Why beagles?

[03:21:47.800 --> 03:21:48.520]
What up dog?

[03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:53.160]
Dwight.

[03:21:54.360 --> 03:21:57.280]
Adam says, and by the way, Adam Kirschner, we did not rip you on the air.

[03:21:57.500 --> 03:21:59.460]
They even though you wish we did, we said nice things about you.

[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:00.240]
But now we take it all back.

[03:22:00.680 --> 03:22:01.260]
What were we talking about?

[03:22:01.300 --> 03:22:03.440]
Are we talking about the little Brian Andrews, the butterfly?

[03:22:04.540 --> 03:22:05.760]
And also we're fine.

[03:22:05.760 --> 03:22:06.080]
Oh, we're fine.

[03:22:06.080 --> 03:22:06.820]
What about Dan Stewart?

[03:22:06.960 --> 03:22:07.360]
What about him?

[03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:09.200]
I guess he didn't have a thing for Adam.

[03:22:10.100 --> 03:22:10.480]
Yeah, he did.

[03:22:10.700 --> 03:22:10.900]
He did?

[03:22:11.120 --> 03:22:12.280]
Don't know if you had, oh, that's right.

[03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:12.540]
He did.

[03:22:12.660 --> 03:22:15.940]
He kept going over there for a, don't know if you had the time to read this on the

[03:22:15.940 --> 03:22:16.220]
air.

[03:22:16.380 --> 03:22:17.960]
Today we found this pretty interesting.

[03:22:18.080 --> 03:22:20.680]
I've never heard this explanation before says Adam.

[03:22:20.820 --> 03:22:20.980]
Okay.

[03:22:21.080 --> 03:22:21.420]
What do we got?

[03:22:22.480 --> 03:22:23.100]
What do we got?

[03:22:23.220 --> 03:22:23.860]
Adam, here's the other thing.

[03:22:23.960 --> 03:22:29.660]
When you stop, there are many reasons for George Bush's single-minded drive toward Baghdad.

[03:22:29.780 --> 03:22:35.820]
And other articles I've written for yellow times, that are hinted that not so obvious reason for the drive against the Mac is Bush's war against Europe.

[03:22:36.560 --> 03:22:40.120]
In fact, I've not come to believe that's the primary reason for his Iraq of Afinia.

[03:22:41.080 --> 03:22:44.800]
Whenever a nation decides to go to war, there are plans made for who is going to win, who's going to lose.

[03:22:44.920 --> 03:22:49.960]
No one goes to where expecting to lose, but it isn't always the obvious target of the aggression that's the real thrust behind the war.

[03:22:50.540 --> 03:22:58.140]
Sometimes it isn't the case of what you expect to win from a war, but rather the case of what you hope someone else loses, and it doesn't have to be your state of enemy you're hopeful sustained the losses.

[03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:02.540]
In this case, Bush's hope for a victim is the European economy.

[03:23:03.120 --> 03:23:06.340]
It's robust and likely to become much stronger in the easily foreseeable future.

[03:23:06.340 --> 03:23:10.500]
Britain's entry in the EU was inevitable. Scandinavia will join sooner rather than later.

[03:23:11.020 --> 03:23:18.380]
Already even without those countries there will be 10 new member nations in May 2004, which will struggle GDP on the EU to buy an import.

[03:23:18.640 --> 03:23:22.160]
This just goes on and on and on.

[03:23:24.320 --> 03:23:26.240]
I can't deal with it.

[03:23:26.320 --> 03:23:30.620]
Huh? I give it a shot. I just can't get too ponderous. Forget about it.

[03:23:32.100 --> 03:23:34.560]
Well, in addition to which it's just a lot of wild speculations.

[03:23:34.580 --> 03:23:38.380]
You know, that crazy about speculation. Opinion is one thing for just speculation.

[03:23:38.740 --> 03:23:43.480]
And it goes on. Thanks anyway, Adam, but it's just got how many pages of this error? Jesus Christ Adam, like I said,

[03:23:45.940 --> 03:23:48.720]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T line.

[03:23:49.400 --> 03:23:50.720]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[03:23:51.240 --> 03:23:54.760]
You need to have got room for you. All right. How about fair and balanced?

[03:23:55.400 --> 03:23:57.820]
Oh, I like that. You do. All spin.

[03:23:59.380 --> 03:24:03.700]
What is it? It is now. Thank you. Thanks.

[03:24:04.680 --> 03:24:09.900]
What's wrong with that fair and balanced? That's a joke, especially it's Fox fair and balanced. Got it Carlos?

[03:24:10.640 --> 03:24:13.960]
Get it and get that sounds on that check. Too late.

[03:24:14.320 --> 03:24:22.760]
I'm sure that. I'm sure that you can me. He ran to the check cash in 10 seconds after we got it in his damn little grubby hand.

[03:24:23.960 --> 03:24:30.960]
I quit washing your balls in the sink. 5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T line. Here's Pompano. Hello.

[03:24:32.660 --> 03:24:38.540]
Yeah, Pompano. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. I've been holding it. I've been shifting it with one hand holding it with the other hand.

[03:24:38.680 --> 03:24:45.380]
Well, I got a couple for you. I'll open it up with it was on your last bit like.

[03:24:47.220 --> 03:24:51.100]
Like like anyway. Well, like, you know, like, you know, like what I'm saying.

[03:24:51.100 --> 03:24:55.920]
Yeah. Okay, that bothers me. Anyway, but I got another one I work in the warehouse in the back.

[03:24:56.020 --> 03:25:02.440]
I got some of these hip hop guys that are back here and I listen to a conversation and I swear I heard this probably about 30 times.

[03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:04.680]
Really? No one in the sand.

[03:25:06.120 --> 03:25:09.920]
Oh, we got that. The one I'm saying. Yeah, that's very big. No one in the.

[03:25:10.060 --> 03:25:13.340]
Oh, my God. I'm telling you. It was about 30 times. I heard it.

[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:20.400]
Okay, have a great day. 5 6 7 0 5 50. You can look here anyway. Well, we're sure on time. You know what I'm saying?

[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:27.660]
Sure, on time. One makes sure we get everybody in here. Don't we? In fact, let's talk to everybody. Just say, you know, earth,

[03:25:27.840 --> 03:25:30.720]
Schindler, when he used to be on WNWS, I never saw anything like it in my life.

[03:25:31.220 --> 03:25:35.580]
He's doing a talk show for old parts. You know, here's a guy that was like 90 talking to people over 100.

[03:25:36.480 --> 03:25:41.700]
And on the weekend, he would have like five calls hanging on with like three minutes to go in the show.

[03:25:43.140 --> 03:25:47.480]
And he'd do like a two minute commercial break. Come back and it's a minute till the end of the show, right? Right.

[03:25:47.920 --> 03:25:50.740]
And so what he would do is he put him each on for like five seconds.

[03:25:53.060 --> 03:25:59.020]
I'm serious. It was just though because he saw the lights lit up. He felt compelled that he had to put each one on a year.

[03:26:00.540 --> 03:26:05.740]
That was light. Schindler, whose favorite expression was. Oh, we don't want to go to China not right now.

[03:26:05.940 --> 03:26:11.340]
Okay. And tell all those people in China. We like him a lot, but stay to hell there for a while till things get cooled out.

[03:26:12.180 --> 03:26:12.960]
No time for.
