[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.980]
Oh!

[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.240]
Oh, Kelly. He's known for his seductive style, his suggested lyrics, and for having relations

[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.740]
with underage girls, which means now all of his songs are inappropriate. That's why

[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.640]
Jailmate Records presents, our Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits, with inappropriate tunes

[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.280]
like... Oh man, is that ever inappropriate? And that's why it's called, our Kelly's

[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.680]
greatest inappropriate hits, with improper favorites like... Buffy Grind.

[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.460]
Yikes! It's our Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits. You'll ask, what is this per-thinking?

[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.760]
When you hear completely inappropriate songs like Sex Me, your body's calling,

[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.940]
Gown Low, and is most recent in the appropriate hit Ignition.

[00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.020]
Come on, our Kelly! She's not even old enough to drive! So, she'll have to get

[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.940]
arrived from her mom to pick up a copy of our Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits.

[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:20.400]
My name is our Kelly. Be by my new CD, so I will have enough money to free the country life from my play.

[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.120]
Thank you very much. Our Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits, available wherever records

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.980]
to owners have no schools whatsoever.

[00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.840]
Now, when he say let me stick my key in your...

[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.420]
Correct! What?

[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.800]
Ignition. In your slot?

[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.980]
903 or 560 WQ, I'm happy Wednesday to you. Now, it's not going to be the same show,

[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.060]
Mo, it's going to be very similar though. In fact, we're going to rip you in ass for three hours.

[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.600]
Just three.

[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.300]
Well, we got new into one. It's mostly...

[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.780]
Oh, I forgot.

[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.420]
Have you forgotten it's the Wednesday new record?

[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.980]
Oh, wow!

[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.100]
Of course we could play a lot of more.

[00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.500]
A lot of more.

[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.900]
A very bad hour.

[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.920]
That would be wrong.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.540]
The old man is starting to have a break. He's starting to lose it.

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.240]
You know, I heard proof this morning on his show.

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.340]
I have a new suggestion for Gregory, the general manager of this place.

[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.800]
You do?

[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.100]
Yes. Take Neil, his program, off the air, where people can hear it.

[00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.940]
And just program it internally on a loudspeaker system in the radio station.

[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.900]
You're asking why would I suggest that?

[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.360]
Why would you suggest that?

[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.200]
Thank you very much for thinking of that question.

[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.320]
The reason is...

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.260]
I'm insightful, interviewer.

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.700]
And given the content of the program?

[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.080]
Only the people in the radio station give a crap about what that pathetic old man's talking about.

[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.440]
Talk about the podcast and kettle-puse man, pathetic old man.

[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.320]
Woo!

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.580]
You're in denial.

[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.300]
See, I guess the age thing really got to him when we finally figured it out when we sat down with a pencil and pad.

[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.320]
And side-figured out since he enjoyed watching Thai Cobb played baseball back in the early part of the century.

[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.700]
He's got to be like, over 100, his age.

[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.600]
I'm serious.

[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.240]
I mean, here's a guy that talked about his recollections of post-civil war.

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.080]
And he's talking about me being a pathetic old man.

[00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.880]
Who you kidding, Mo, in addition to which the audience loves the inside stuff?

[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.180]
One of our world-famous polls we did a few months ago.

[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.480]
And far beyond anything else in the world they want to hear inside crap, man.

[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.500]
That's why our show is so popular.

[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.220]
Inside edition, outside edition, current edition, last edition.

[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.900]
That's what the public wants is a lot of dirt.

[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760]
And believe me, at Q&M we got lots of dirt.

[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.540]
We're blowing dirt all over the place.

[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.080]
Look at that pool that he was upset about.

[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.800]
Well, he's upset about a lot of things, I guess.

[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120]
I mean, here was my good, close personal buddy, you know?

[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.080]
Every day just when you think you're on the verge of really bonding with the molemyster

[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.440]
and then all of a sudden he turns like a cornered rat.

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.720]
A US girl, he's right there with his head up his clothed me back.

[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.800]
Girl, I put my head in some turpentine and get that stuff off of there, girl.

[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.580]
It's certain to mold.

[00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.940]
1400 and some odd votes yesterday.

[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.040]
And even though George had a good start here, yes, they're 1445.

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.580]
Look at that.

[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.300]
What program changes, what programming changes does WQM need to make to improve big time?

[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.960]
We asked yesterday.

[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.620]
Oh, why do I kid curry?

[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.640]
Being a boy doesn't really have SARS.

[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.220]
OK, you can come back to coast is clear.

[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.840]
He's not going to take any chances.

[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.100]
No, you're not taking no chances.

[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.700]
What a bunch of pussy you got, you know?

[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.300]
No, seriously, stop and think about it.

[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.740]
What are the chances of it even here?

[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.500]
Even here where, well, we're just again, then, these little cards they're handing out now

[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.620]
when you go to the airport, you know?

[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.140]
Or if you drive into the country in Ontario.

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.140]
Little cards about SARS.

[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:21.580]
What are they saying?

[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.940]
Officials here.

[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:31.940]
Particularly the size of the crowds that indicated the determination of the she is to have a larger voice and affairs.

[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.080]
Yeah, the she-ites are, in fact, the Americans are saying, oh, she-ite, man.

[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.120]
A lot of crap going on over there in Iraq.

[00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.340]
But anyway, I don't know what everybody's so panicky about.

[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.620]
It's a very, unless you go to the hospital and breathe in, inhale a lot.

[00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.220]
1445 votes.

[00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.640]
What programming changes do we need to make to improve this station?

[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.660]
And of course, today and tomorrow we're just killing some time, boys and girls,

[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.100]
wait until Friday when the book comes out the winner book.

[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.220]
Now, ordinarily, I mean, you know, ratings come and they go, we get the trends every month and every three months.

[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.060]
There's another rating book.

[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.140]
This has been going on since the beginning of time immemorial, as somebody would say.

[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:12.240]
But I do have a feeling that this rating book on Friday will be the turning point for WQM as we know it or knew it or will know it.

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.180]
Would you agree?

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.440]
You're implying like they're going to do something based on that.

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.640]
No, but I'm just saying that if ever they did, if ever there was action at Jackson, if ever there was a call for action.

[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.520]
Now is the time.

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.820]
Isn't the shinshi died by what?

[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.760]
Alicia Alicia.

[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.260]
We're just what a shame.

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.520]
But her her drop in lives on 14, ever in 51 votes and mole.

[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.040]
I'm going to tell you, man, nobody can touch the mole man.

[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:44.000]
He thinks only that see he really believes that it's only the people in the building.

[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.980]
I'll hate him like poison.

[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.960]
So we ought to put this show on a megaphone.

[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.740]
It was the fact that the matter is most of the people outside hate you.

[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.700]
Are you interrupting me again?

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.400]
Hit him on the side of the head Carlos.

[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.560]
Good.

[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.220]
Real hard.

[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.660]
466.

[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.440]
I mean, you were giving him a little bit of a run for the money and the early going here and man he pulled away like secretariat in this stretch.

[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.000]
The late chick Anderson could be caught in this horse race, but he probably won't.

[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.200]
Dump Moe get a new morning show 466 people 32.1% almost a third of this audience said dump the mole man.

[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.840]
He blows.

[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.460]
Dump Moe he blow.

[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.560]
Move Neil back to 10 to 2 actually edges you out.

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:24.780]
How do you like that for second place?

[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:26.260]
296.

[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.360]
You heard that Duffin clearance you simple to ins man.

[00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.760]
296 people that's a 20 point 3%.

[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.780]
So that's the most important programming change you can make is get the show where back of the longs where from 10 to 2.

[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.480]
Got all mighty.

[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.540]
Well, we like I said it's pay week on the Friday.

[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.120]
It's the 25th.

[00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:50.020]
So we leave clearance out of this and he's done such a great job of producing those paychecks, but in the case of Muff.

[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.060]
You asshole.

[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.520]
Yeah, get with it.

[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.480]
Get with it.

[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.680]
Quit dicking around man.

[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.760]
10 to 2 which we already discussed is 85,000 different ways for them to work that out.

[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.260]
Did they do it?

[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:00.400]
No.

[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.360]
Are they talking about it?

[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.420]
No.

[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:10.840]
Now just just live service because they still want to continue using the 9 to 10 hours for me to try to goose up the lame, lame ass numbers of this daughtering old koot.

[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.480]
Anyway, look at that.

[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:14.980]
The votes are going up as I'm speaking here.

[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.800]
I could just do this and milk this for three hours.

[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.320]
You know me.

[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:17.760]
Yeah.

[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.940]
468 votes for the moment.

[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.100]
Get them off.

[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.280]
299 say get Neil back to 10 to 2.

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.620]
Keep George off the year 274.

[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.800]
So let's see your six short.

[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.720]
194 votes he beat you by obvious shame.

[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.940]
You're not even the same leak anymore with the moment.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.500]
A piker.

[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.260]
I mean, they hate you, but not even a close to the hate they have for him.

[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:37.420]
No more Marlins games.

[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.540]
181 and that was a little bit of a late addition.

[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.880]
The Marlins move.

[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:41.940]
Hey, they won last night.

[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:42.600]
Anybody care?

[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.780]
No.

[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.320]
By the way, the Leafs suck.

[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.640]
That guy from Philly.

[00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:46.540]
Don't bother calling me.

[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.980]
Okay, cuz I'll cut your ass right off.

[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:53.100]
Team played good, even though it's nighters and asshole and Bob Bobby Clarks a bigger asshole.

[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.380]
And I filled it off your fans.

[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.400]
The worst which that inspired me for the poll today.

[00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.120]
But the Leafs didn't show up a better team one and I got man enough to say that.

[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.900]
The better team, uh, yeah, they won.

[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:02.700]
Leafs sunk.

[00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:05.620]
Back to the drawing board, Yerke Lume.

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.040]
Okay, let's see.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.760]
No more Marlins games.

[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.340]
181.

[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.260]
Don't change a thing.

[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:09.980]
It's fine.

[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.640]
And even 5% 74 people said that.

[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.600]
And even 5%.

[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.000]
We could do that again if we tried.

[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:15.340]
Could we?

[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.840]
I doubt it.

[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:17.260]
74.

[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:20.860]
That's not very good, which means 95% said there's room for improvement.

[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:25.320]
Bring back the Crow 48 3.2% want the Crow.

[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:28.300]
They say the signal comes to them as the Crow flies.

[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.540]
Neil should retire like George Stepin 42 2.8%.

[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.420]
Said I'm starting to think about it.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.680]
We'll stop.

[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:36.300]
Huh?

[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.800]
No, I'm thinking today would be a good day to do that.

[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.360]
I got lots.

[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.300]
I got to go get a haircut.

[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.480]
I got a lot of things to do.

[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.760]
Lots more Joe Zagaki 33.

[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.600]
And you know something.

[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.200]
His stock has risen dramatically in recent months only.

[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.680]
Only since we all started playing at drop in.

[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.320]
Oh my.

[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.480]
Oh my.

[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:55.220]
Oh my.

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:59.160]
You know what?

[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.440]
How we've moved him up in the world.

[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.440]
In fact, he's picking up the slack where the beast dropped off.

[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.000]
I will say mo because I know he's listening on the way home.

[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.880]
I will say this.

[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.740]
Did I say he was right about something yesterday?

[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:12.780]
I forget what it was.

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.080]
Need to.

[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.440]
I forgot.

[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.420]
But today I'll say it again about the beast.

[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.260]
I believe he was correct.

[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:17.960]
Maybe that's what it was.

[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:18.600]
I think it was.

[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:19.620]
The beast.

[00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:20.040]
You were right.

[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.860]
Unprofessional and the detriment to the radio station.

[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.480]
He's a detriment to our lives.

[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.200]
I'm going to say it again.

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.200]

[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.240]
I don't know.

[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.120]
Call me insensitive.

[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.540]
Call me a daughtering old fool.

[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:29.860]
You're an insensitive daughter.

[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.160]
Okay.

[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:35.140]
But the fact of the matter is that I'm just sick and tired of trying to say fat people have

[00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:35.660]
a death wish.

[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.000]
And that man has a death wish.

[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.820]
Who the hell's he can eat in the freaking rascal house and shoving him.

[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.080]
God damn pickled sausages down his pussy at 7.11 and eating a gobs of soup at the hurricane

[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:47.440]
game.

[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.600]
Who you kidding beast.

[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.040]
Just this one time.

[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:52.960]
I have to agree with the mole man.

[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:54.680]
I think he had a stomach on it.

[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:55.920]
Run on the beast forehead.

[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.640]
When you have to see the beast wearing one of Mozae here pieces.

[00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.340]
Oh God.

[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.960]
I'd pay $1,000 to see that.

[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:02.460]
I'm serious.

[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:03.300]
I'd love to see that.

[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:03.880]
Huh?

[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.600]
Let's see if we can arrange it.

[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.080]
Because you talk about a fat head.

[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.940]
He makes Joe Rose look like Ike about a crane.

[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.980]
It's had a so big the beast.

[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.720]
And Mo would probably have to like so two of them things together to cover up all of the beast ball spot.

[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.980]
I'll go snatch one off his head.

[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:17.880]
Don't say snatch.

[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.320]
Okay.

[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:19.780]
Now let's see.

[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.860]
We bring back the crow 48.

[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.820]
Neil should retire like George Stippin 42.

[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:24.000]
It's certainly a possibility.

[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.860]
Lots more Joe Zagaki 33.

[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.220]
Dump the Humper 25.

[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.960]
The Humper is very well.

[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.680]
They love you Hank.

[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.780]
Even though they like to bitch you out behind your back.

[00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:33.780]
And dump the mad dog only 13.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.440]
Mad dog wins man hands down.

[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.080]
He's a everybody loves the mad dog.

[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.020]
We're not really sure why.

[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.520]
But I guess the old expression what's not to like applies.

[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:41.740]

[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.320]
Oh, it's speaking about his wins.

[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.980]
They were getting ever closer to that big.

[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.960]
They saturday the draft show and a draft party and all the draft stuff.

[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.900]
And will continue to insist at least the last time I heard it the other day

[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.880]
that he's not going to be there.

[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.560]
I'm mad dog was talking about yesterday.

[00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.160]
He's already talking what he's going to be doing and talking about.

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:58.700]
And this and that.

[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.540]
So I don't think he's going to have much influence over the mad dog on this one.

[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:02.540]
Does anybody else know?

[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.040]

[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.540]
So mad dog will be there because that's the course part of the deal.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:09.820]
But the moment since he's got such strong numbers to back him up.

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:11.780]
He's playing hard to get.

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.200]
Playing fast and loose with Greg's emotions.

[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.940]
Can you imagine if the play by play guy for the team didn't show up at the draft party?

[00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:19.420]
Can you even imagine that?

[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:19.980]
No.

[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.280]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.440]
Well, there are some depressed leaf fans there on the CBC.

[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.480]
Wow, that's what it goes.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.800]
In this bar we're left to wonder what happened.

[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.700]
What happened?

[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.500]
We got our ass kicked.

[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.940]

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.640]
The new Rogers are sports hall radio WQAF.

[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.300]
He's saying hello to us today. He's right.

[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.700]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:51.880]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.200]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.480]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:55.820]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:56.160]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:56.660]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:56.660]

[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.640]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.300]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.600]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.500]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.800]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.040]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:12.620]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:14.220]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:14.840]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.320]
We're shooting down the hill.

[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.620]
17. Oh good news for the information.

[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:23.100]
Iraqi Information Minister is still alive.

[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.180]
That's what they're saying.

[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.400]
Now he went off with his in laws.

[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:27.200]
Some of the accords and way.

[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.080]
That's a relief.

[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.900]
Iraqi Information Minister is still alive.

[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.320]
His bad news for Moe.

[00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:33.280]
He might drive off the road.

[00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:35.900]
You better pull off the side of the road and rest for a couple of minutes old man.

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.000]
The Iraqi Information Minister may be starting next Monday morning with Guldi.

[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:41.920]
You see that pairing?

[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.540]
I love it.

[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:46.940]
Guldi can just quack in a background.

[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:48.960]
Anyway, don't forget our hot couples contest.

[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.240]
You can check out neo-arrogues.com and on our website.

[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.060]
Now Carlos has really gone ballistic on her.

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.120]
Have you taken a look at it?

[00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.120]
Yeah, it's great.

[00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.220]
It's flaming.

[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.880]
Yeah, they're gigantic flames.

[00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:05.240]
Flames of love leaping up from the information air about the hot couples.

[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.860]
It's a good thing we didn't have those on there last time.

[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.740]
Because with the exception of the winners,

[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.180]
I'm saying, well, you know, it was a little short spur of the moment kind of thing.

[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.100]
I'm sure it'll be way better this time with the live bill.

[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:18.560]
Maybe we'll have some people on the contest this time who are...

[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.720]
FAMING!

[00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.360]
Now that's okay too, isn't it?

[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.080]
If we have like two of those, it's only two of those.

[00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.740]
Same lady, or whatever.

[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.120]
No sex?

[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:25.820]
Yeah.

[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.560]
Just log on email and picture.

[00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.000]
Now are we taking emails yet?

[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:29.640]
Or what?

[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:30.760]
Beenervoy.

[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.820]
Because I put on May 1st, but there's a reason we can't.

[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.420]
Yeah, they can already start because you can find a way to do it on there.

[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.040]
And this time we actually have some good prizes.

[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.280]
Not that we didn't last time.

[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.860]
But the winning couple will get three day two nights stay for two with the world

[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.540]
oasis resort in casino at the Bahamas, including round trip airfare on Laker Air.

[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.240]
Which is pretty damn good.

[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.860]
We'll be doing this once a month for three months.

[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.980]
May, June and Julio.

[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.020]
And, you know, the hot couples, you know, have to be naked in the pictures.

[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.560]
Hopefully, we don't want to see anything gross unless you really look good.

[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.880]
In that case, we'd like to see a naked or maybe with very little clothing on.

[00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:07.700]
So check that out on neorodgers.com along with all the other brilliant things that Carlos and Eric have

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:11.280]
put on there on a very proud website, which was right.

[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.140]
That is a door nail up until just a few months ago.

[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.460]
I mean, that thing was an embarrassment.

[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.480]
It was, oh, God.

[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:17.780]
Anyway.

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.960]
Well, it was.

[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:22.740]
There was a lot of stale old crap on there.

[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.300]
Neils got 17 years locked on his contract.

[00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.020]
And all this other crap, I mean, stuff from a hundred years ago.

[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.980]
There were pictures of Moa shaking hands with Babe Ruth from the mid-30s.

[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:32.860]
It was incredible.

[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.380]
What?

[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:37.900]
I didn't say anything.

[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.160]
Oh, yeah, you're starting in again.

[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.060]
You're not fooling me.

[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.760]
You and Eric and Carlos again, it's the trifecta man.

[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.840]
The trifecta. These three guys hate each other like poison.

[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.980]
Now, we'll get to today's poll momentarily.

[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:50.980]
But we ought to take some very important calls first.

[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.540]
If anybody wants to rip Moe by the way, feel free.

[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.380]
We're going to do it for three hours between now and noon.

[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.800]
Just out of spite for his intent to behave this morning.

[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:01.360]
It'll be the same show as yesterday.

[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.220]
He'll be talking about me and ripping me in at you.

[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.480]
Well, we don't want to disappoint.

[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.260]
We're here to please, Moe.

[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.200]
We don't want to disappoint you.

[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.760]
Although only people inside the building really care.

[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:11.620]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.980]
Hey, Neil, how are you doing?

[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.600]
Pretty good. It's the Rift and Moe line.

[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.700]
I'd like to reference the keeping George off the air.

[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:19.540]
You're going to go ahead.

[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.960]
Do you remember a long time ago how you used to say

[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.280]
that you worked better on a loan?

[00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.300]
Yes, I do.

[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.460]
Whatever happened to that, you do.

[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.840]
You worked way better on a loan, and that's my opinion.

[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:30.120]
Yeah.

[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.840]
And I want to give you guys a little,

[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.040]
a little what do you call it, a carc?

[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.360]
A little carc.

[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:37.740]
A little carc.

[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.760]
Live in Loco.

[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.180]
I like that, live in Loco.

[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:42.720]
Hold on.

[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.100]
Will you come and see your rip in him because he's ripping you in ass.

[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.400]
No, he says I work better.

[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:48.740]
See, look at that Carlos.

[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:50.480]
Was he stepping on me again or what?

[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:51.100]
Always.

[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.680]
Couldn't even see my lips moving.

[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.820]
What is wrong with this man?

[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:54.780]
Blind.

[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.220]
Mine is a bad probably caught that SARS from you.

[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.940]
By the way, that big orange lump on Carlos's neck,

[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.500]
we don't want to get people in a building pancai.

[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.360]
It is not SARS.

[00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:04.540]
It's just old scars.

[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.880]
See, he told Kid Curie, these are old scars.

[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.300]
He had panimonia or something as a kid.

[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.540]
And so there's scars.

[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.720]
And Kid Curie thought he said,

[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.580]
it's SARS ran like a son of a bitch down the hall

[00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.680]
and is probably spreading it all throughout power 96.

[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:16.240]
You're infected, Kid.

[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.380]
Infected.

[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.280]
Well, we'll see how well that infects you.

[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.860]
They are on Friday when a book comes out.

[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.680]
Then in the past, we always give the numbers out.

[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:25.960]
A lot of times we make a big production,

[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.380]
but never like we're going to do on Friday.

[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.920]
It's going to be a major stab against it.

[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.440]
I might even have a catered.

[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.460]
And just to show you what a prick I am yesterday,

[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.700]
when I guess what I had for lunch,

[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.120]
I already told you you said you can't guess.

[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.280]
Being a boy, what do you think I had for lunch yesterday?

[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.280]
Dai, Dai.

[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:43.520]
French toast.

[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:45.440]
Oh, be the toast.

[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:47.140]
French toast.

[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.740]
Really good.

[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.900]
You know the kind where they make it like big chunks.

[00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:52.180]
You know what it was mean?

[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:53.600]
Take you ever seen that?

[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.820]
Dick sliced would like lots of butter and maple syrup.

[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.700]
Real Canadian maple syrup, eh?

[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.960]
Oh, God, it was good.

[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:04.460]
And then I turned around and I see the person at the table

[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.720]
behind me was like, I'll red in the face and coughing real hard.

[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.340]
And I ran out of there anyway.

[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.040]
Just a joke.

[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.820]
It's just a joke, OK?

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.340]
Everybody is so guy, they have a tight date.

[00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.640]
That's the main thing in the world now.

[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.720]
It's get everybody into a panic.

[00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.300]
They're also they can play all their little games behind our backs.

[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:21.500]
Ah, she right there doing it again over there.

[00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.060]
You ain't see nothing yet, man.

[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.040]
In terms of psychosis, the she-ites are marching

[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.640]
and the news networks in America trying

[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.280]
to make it look like, oh, this is great.

[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.700]
They're exercising the religious freedoms.

[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.440]
They were repressed by Sodom for so long.

[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.600]
What they don't understand is they want the Americans out

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.820]
yesterday and they want to put in the same kind of guy

[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.360]
that in fundamentals regime that they have next door in Iran.

[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:40.320]
That's what they want.

[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:41.860]
They want their own Ayatollah.

[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:42.860]
I told you so.

[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.280]
How long before we get another Sodom to fight this one?

[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.180]
How many days?

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.180]
About third, man.

[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.400]
See, that's not your just good with that stuff.

[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.700]
See, if he just keeps his mouth shut,

[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:53.800]
he's real good with the droppings.

[00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.480]
Ain't no problem.

[00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.720]
Now, we don't want you to dummy up altogether,

[00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.220]
although lately, you're a little bit scary.

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.280]
And the good news for the audience is

[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.040]
starting back.

[00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:07.560]
What is it on the 4th of July in honor of our nation's birthday?

[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.760]
Or whatever the hell that they really is?

[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.140]
The 4th of July starts at summer schedule of ours.

[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.460]
So I'll be on only two days and Thursdays

[00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.800]
to arrest the July and most of August.

[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.260]
And George would be on three times a week

[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.760]
unless we bring in somebody else.

[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.240]
Has there been any discussion about that?

[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:22.920]
With whom?

[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:23.200]
Maybe.

[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.080]
Yeah, have you talked yourself about it?

[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:26.420]
No.

[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.020]
What about Muff?

[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.740]
He'd been around this morning?

[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:31.160]
I haven't seen this morning.

[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.580]
Where the hell's the Muff, myster?

[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.640]
What is his story?

[00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.700]
Oh, and by the way, Mo, what the hell kind of crap is this that?

[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.840]
He's running that promo, which doesn't bother me.

[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.600]
I thought it was funny with the virtue

[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:42.320]
from Boer's head about neo-Rarja's

[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.240]
wearing a pink dress or whatever that thing was, you know?

[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.480]
And the promo for Mo, that ran a several times,

[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:47.800]
was shot at me.

[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:49.060]
And no problem, I can handle it.

[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.960]
But Tommy comes in, I don't want to get Tommy in trouble,

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.020]
but Tommy tells us that he can make any kind of promo's

[00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.420]
for our show except if there's a color-ripping Mo.

[00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.860]
We can't put that in there.

[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.820]
Now, what kind of double standard is that?

[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.140]
Just because he's a thin skin-up-pedal old man?

[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.120]
Yeah.

[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.540]
What kind of programming is that, Muff,

[00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:07.860]
and clearance you butt plugs?

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:08.900]
Now, what is that all about?

[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:12.020]
He can run promo, is mocking me,

[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.560]
and making all kinds of doing Rick Santorum homophobic crap,

[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.560]
which we'll get to, by the way,

[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.360]
and I apologize to whoever faxed me that on Monday.

[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.200]
I wasn't in the mood for Rick Santorum on Monday,

[00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:20.460]
and he's right-wing homophobes.

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.660]
But now it's such a big story,

[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:22.860]
and we'll get into it eventually.

[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.060]
After we take five, 600 calls.

[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.500]
We're going to get to the poll for today, okay?

[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.140]
In honor of that, Schmuck, who called me Monday

[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:32.200]
about the flyers.

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.680]
Yeah, and again, flyers are a better team.

[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.400]
I told you that I didn't think the leaves are good

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.200]
when the series on the maze that got to seven games.

[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.840]
Got really shown up last night for what they really are,

[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.760]
tired and old, and bad defense.

[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.320]
But nevertheless, he inspired me.

[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.920]
And what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.960]
That's the poll question today,

[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.920]
and we start with four obvious choices.

[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.700]
And then, of course, you can add your own,

[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.500]
as we'll build our poll.

[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:56.820]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.000]
And this is just your opinion based on what you've heard,

[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.240]
what you've experienced, whatever bug you got up your ass.

[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:03.960]
Hopefully, it's not SARS.

[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.500]
Paris, New York,

[00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.300]
Oi!

[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.860]
Philadelphia, or...

[00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:13.640]
Thank you, Blitz.

[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:13.900]
Miami.

[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.580]
Now you're gonna say Miami?

[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:17.840]
Yeah, I'm going to.

[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.740]
So am I.

[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.100]
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.360]
I'm not, I'm saying Philadelphia.

[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:23.700]
Follow up with this.

[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:24.760]
That's not fair.

[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.540]
That's very unfair to my old friend.

[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.480]
What was his name, David David Savita?

[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:29.560]
Remember David Savita?

[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:29.840]
No.

[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.140]
He was a, uh, a paramedic in a Hollywood.

[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.500]
Maybe he's probably still on the top.

[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:36.060]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.900]
David was from Philadelphia.

[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.240]
He was a fine, fine American.

[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.340]
Or whatever it really was, fine, a guido.

[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.720]
Love you, David.

[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.280]
But he's probably getting old and ugly now.

[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.660]
But anyway, he looked good.

[00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.480]
So he was from Philadelphia.

[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.660]
If they look good, that's fine.

[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:48.420]
Then he nice people.

[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:50.040]
No, not even the, I don't know.

[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.700]
In fact, they showed the shots of the crowd

[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.600]
to the game last night, and filling, man, what a, oh,

[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.800]
you just look at a lot of those people to say, fat.

[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.600]
Some of them probably are from the fed Dien.

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.720]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.480]
Not big on the Philadelphias, but you're right.

[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.540]
I probably vote for Miami too,

[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.920]
because every day I discover I'm gonna show

[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.200]
on friendly nasty, hostile WQA and friendly line.

[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.640]
See what I mean?

[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:11.100]
There you go.

[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.740]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:15.200]
that was excellent.

[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.820]
Thank you.

[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.200]
That was out saying, and that was Mo callin'

[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.700]
on a mobile front, his way back to Voka.

[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.240]
Thank you, Mo.

[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.360]
For making my case, you basket case,

[00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:26.280]
926, be sure and tell everybody in town

[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.680]
that this Friday's the big day, the moment of truth.

[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.760]
BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!

[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.260]
We're not just talkin' about one abhorrent month

[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.640]
like January when a bunch of old retarded drunken

[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.780]
goofballs got the, I recently accidentally put

[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:40.760]
the moman down on there.

[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:42.980]
We're talkin' about a real test,

[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.500]
a real test of stick to it in this and longevity.

[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.200]
I think by Monday, he's out.

[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.580]
How many times have you heard about an opportunity

[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.180]
and you didn't act, you didn't grab onto it,

[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.000]
you missed out. Well, right now it's one of those times.

[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.680]
Rarely, there's an opportunity to wrap the rest

[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.460]
of what you're doing, but this one ought to stop

[00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.420]
and put your head right up in the air.

[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.160]
Stick it up there.

[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:01.880]
Interest rates have gone down even lower

[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.220]
than they were before, which is amazing.

[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.580]
The financial group was offering an interest rate

[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.720]
of 3.45% and they lowered it to 2.95%.

[00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:11.000]
Now, rates have gone down even lower.

[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.940]
2.45% financing with financial group.

[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.640]
Let me say it again.

[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.720]
2.45% you heard right.

[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:18.760]
So call financial group and check this out.

[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.380]
1-800-940-Lend, because these interest rates

[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:22.720]
probably won't last very long.

[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.480]
Here's the window of opportunity for you to hop through

[00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:25.580]
with financial group.

[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.020]
Get yourself an incredible low rate of just 2.45%

[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:31.180]
and save thousands and zillions of dollars.

[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:33.300]
Call financial group as a toll free call.

[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.280]
Be sure and mention Todd Brex, name when you call 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.480]
Wobble 2.45% financing due to those monthly payments.

[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.940]
You might be wondering, I'll give you some, for instance,

[00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.380]
if you have a $200,000 loan, you pay only $786 a month.

[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.760]
If you have a $100,000 loan, you pay only $393 bucks a month.

[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.420]
So do it now.

[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.900]
Do yourself a humongous favor.

[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.300]
And call financial group toll free at 1-800-940-Lend,

[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.760]
1-800-940-Lend, either an equal housing lender,

[00:23:58.140 --> 00:24:00.040]
credit restrictions apply rates as something to change

[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:02.320]
without notice, 5.34 APR.

[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.480]
My, I'm low quality.

[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.560]
This is for 3-0-560.

[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.420]
You weigh 2A.

[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:12.380]
I have a new suggestion for Gregory,

[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.660]
the general manager of this place.

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.140]
You do?

[00:24:14.340 --> 00:24:14.480]
Yes.

[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:19.420]
Take me, his program off the air with people can hear it.

[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.360]
And just program it internally on a loudspeaker system

[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.280]
in the radio station.

[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.200]
You're asking why would I suggest that?

[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.680]
Why would you suggest that?

[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:27.920]
Yes.

[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.520]
Thank you very much for thinking of that question.

[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:33.040]
The reason is, given the content of the program,

[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.960]
all the people in the radio station

[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.420]
give a crap about what that pathetic old man's talking about.

[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.700]
Absolutely correct.

[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.340]
Thank you.

[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.840]
Take this off the air.

[00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:45.620]
Come on, give me the microphone.

[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.600]
Because of the size, I don't go out at all.

[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.780]
I spend all day indoors, as I don't want to die from stars.

[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:55.800]
Oi!

[00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.760]
Because of stars, I bought a surgical mask.

[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:04.980]
I look like Michael Jackson, but it's better than cat-ching stars.

[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:11.020]
Because of stars, every time I know his runs,

[00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.200]
I call my doctor, and he tells me I don't have stars.

[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.480]
Because of stars, I cry all the time.

[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.180]
Now my throat's kind of raw.

[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.460]
Oh my God, does that mean I have stars?

[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.180]
Yes.

[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.700]
I'm 33 at 5.60 W.

[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:34.680]
You come to sunny shining.

[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.780]
Gonna be all the way up to 45.46 today.

[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.480]
Ha, ha, ha.

[00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.820]
Well, we're going through one of those screen time things,

[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:41.720]
you know what I'm talking about?

[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:42.320]
Yeah.

[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.720]
The spring up north, I mean, one day it'd be like 83.

[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.740]
And the next'd be 43.

[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.180]
So it's a little variety, eh?

[00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:48.220]
Don't bother me.

[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.400]
Sun is shining.

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.120]
It's a beautiful experience to tell you that.

[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:52.740]
I'm gonna open up the window right now and inhale.

[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:54.400]
Real, and see what I can catch.

[00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:55.480]
See what's in the ear.

[00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:58.280]
I see somebody already voted on there along with me on a pool.

[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.860]
You can put the pole up there already, Eric.

[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:00.940]
You don't have to keep the pole down.

[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.720]
We'll build it as we go, but, you know,

[00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.700]
we unfairly, early cities that we have on here.

[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.320]
And this isn't just the most obnoxious people in America

[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.180]
or in North America.

[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.220]
This is in the world.

[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.040]
What city would you generally, I mean, you know,

[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.840]
it's a generalization, but it's fun.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.860]
It's the kind of stuff that they, they are.

[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.740]
Noth or teeth on.

[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:17.860]
What's that expression?

[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.440]
They cut their teeth on.

[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:19.860]
Oh, yeah.

[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.060]
Never cut your teeth.

[00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:22.600]
No, come in to QIM.

[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.300]
Hey, guys, Dr. Neal speaking.

[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:25.400]
Neal.

[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:26.420]
Let me ask questions.

[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:27.940]
Did you watch more of the last night?

[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:29.100]
No, I did not.

[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.080]
I was watching a hockey game.

[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.120]
It would have been a much better idea.

[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:31.520]
You're right.

[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.500]
Oh, you majorly missed a big deal.

[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.120]
No, nobody's mentioning a deal, huh?

[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.340]
How big was it?

[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.340]
Let me ask you a question.

[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.720]
You didn't see the preview for next week.

[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.440]
No.

[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.120]
They show a full, back, nude shot of your boy Clark.

[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.040]
Brack, I don't care about his ass.

[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:47.900]
I'd rather see him.

[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.360]
Yeah, I figured you would.

[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.920]
You know, the old cigarette spot, it's up on front.

[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.420]
It's what's up front, the counts.

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.320]
They can think I'm smoked out in the back a little bit

[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.400]
with a little cloud, but they showed it, man.

[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:57.900]
I don't know.

[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.100]
I can't believe you haven't heard about it yet.

[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.160]
I'm going to go in and mark it on a wall right now

[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.700]
for next week.

[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:03.500]
I said you will.

[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:04.200]
OK, my man.

[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:04.960]
Thanks, man.

[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.640]
Boy, he's sounded pretty excited about it, didn't he?

[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:07.920]
Wow.

[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:09.100]
Woo.

[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.420]
My man.

[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.300]
He is my man.

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.560]
He's anybody's man.

[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.000]
You're gay.

[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:14.860]
He's a man's man at Tom Welling.

[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:17.160]
I'm getting a swelling right now thinking about Tom Welling.

[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:18.620]
Now, I'm not into a ass.

[00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.660]
I know that's a very, you know, Rick Santorum

[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:21.720]
probably wouldn't understand that,

[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.240]
but then a lot of heteros don't understand that.

[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:24.880]
These terminally heterosexual people

[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.600]
like Rick Santorum and these other Republicans.

[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.220]
Ah, you're a fag.

[00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:29.560]
And of course, that's the response.

[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.100]
They've been doing that for years, they're right wingers.

[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.460]
They have to find a scapegoat just like Hitler did.

[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.700]
Of course, Hitler found a lot of different ones.

[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.240]
Rick Santorum, though, he's got real problems.

[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.480]
Now, he's got tourists under fire for comments

[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.560]
on homosexuality.

[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.900]
Top Democrats and gay rights advocates blasted comments

[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.360]
by Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania,

[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:49.060]
which he appeared to compare homosexuality

[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.620]
in says big of me an adultery,

[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.120]
and then called on the Pennsylvania Republican

[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.380]
to repudiate the remarks.

[00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:56.600]
One prominent Democratic group yesterday also called on

[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.620]
Santorum to resign his leadership post in the Senate.

[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.520]
White House had no comment on this, by the way.

[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.760]
Guess who, of course, they asked and had no comment.

[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:03.420]
Ari.

[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.220]
Right.

[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.960]
Ari, the fairy had no comment.

[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.780]
This is just like Pete Williams all over again.

[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.280]
Same thing.

[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.820]
Same kind of crap.

[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.840]
But nevertheless, I'll save that for a little later.

[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.400]
Because I do want to be the Maureen.com.

[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.020]
I don't think there's any words in there.

[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.560]
I don't know either.

[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.540]
I'm disappointed Maureen.

[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.080]
It's really good.

[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:25.200]
Did you take a peek at it?

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]
Yeah, probably not.

[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.000]
Okay, I'm bigger pardoned.

[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.120]
Nothing.

[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:31.180]
There you go.

[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.180]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the on a AT&T

[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.140]
in Verizon Wireless line.

[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.220]
Did duck come in to tell you about the schedule this summer?

[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:38.780]
No.

[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:39.760]
Why not?

[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.240]
I heard they're having maybe they're having

[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.180]
ding dong school with the old moman this morning.

[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:44.980]
I think that's possible.

[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.940]
He didn't come in telling you the breaking the news

[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.420]
that Rick and Sus are going to be working this summer.

[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.140]
It's that you know, because they're not.

[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:52.880]
I just thought I would say that.

[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.640]
What you need the extra cash.

[00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:56.140]
How about if they work and then they still

[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.020]
pay you the extra cash?

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:57.620]
I hit great.

[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:58.260]
I'll run the bar.

[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.940]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the what they in what city will you

[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.200]
find the most obnoxious people and also who should we

[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.300]
have fill in the summer since it's coming up very soon.

[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.140]
Georgia somebody else give us some names.

[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:11.260]
Maybe we could have mode of the show.

[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.800]
Okay, he's only doing three hours anyway.

[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.600]
What kind of a show is that a three hour show?

[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.060]
I mean, may I do those two hours because he's like a buffer

[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.700]
on the station.

[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.180]
Plus he's got that other business.

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:21.900]
It is which is where he really makes all his money from.

[00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:23.920]
This is just like a hobby.

[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.500]
WQ I am.

[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:27.620]
Yeah, they all.

[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:28.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.060]
I've been listening to you.

[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.240]
If you came to town back when you do used to do the issue

[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.280]
or you just shows.

[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:35.200]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:39.520]
And the best radio I think you ever did was when you were

[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:41.540]
doing the hell and the hell and the hell.

[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:42.940]
It was the best way it's ever done.

[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:43.380]
It's smart.

[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:44.260]
Wow.

[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.360]
But I got to tell you I'm sort of glad that jica got underneath

[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.860]
your skin because things have been.

[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.420]
What do you mean jica got under my skin?

[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:53.980]
What does that mean?

[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.280]
Well, we start talking about the periodicals on the radio.

[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.900]
It got here.

[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.740]
And this left of it.

[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.920]
And I don't even think that this band is some of the other

[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.180]
things.

[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:05.380]
I think this stuff with the mo.

[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:06.420]
Eight mo.

[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.140]
What kind of target is mo?

[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.300]
I mean, if day after day, you're firing away at them.

[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.840]
And so it's what you're trying to do is tell me what I should

[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:16.400]
do on the show.

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:17.680]
Is that was that the purpose of the call?

[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.400]
So the purpose of the call is to tell you that I don't

[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.940]
understand what George contributes.

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.160]
And now, wait a minute.

[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.040]
You just got to tell me about Mo.

[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.560]
And about you don't understand that.

[00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:28.840]
You don't understand what George contributes.

[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.640]
What is it that you do like about the show?

[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.260]
Let's find out about that since we're not

[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.080]
talking about how and Dale anymore since it's old crap.

[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.360]
Well, I like your personality.

[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.400]
I like the way you handle colors.

[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:41.540]
I like the show.

[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:42.300]
You mean like this?

[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:46.060]
Five say, I'm not interested in that crap.

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.120]
He's going to give me a critique.

[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.280]
He's critique in George.

[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.560]
I don't want no critique.

[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:50.880]
I'll talk about Mo all I want.

[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:53.020]
The audience, take a look at the poll from yesterday, sir.

[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:54.080]
Mo wins hands down.

[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.420]
This guy must have a thing for Mo's air piece.

[00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:58.540]
He must be in love with it.

[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.740]
And listen, since the day you came to town,

[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.720]
but you don't like this, so we don't like that,

[00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.440]
how about if we do all your old howl and Dale stuff

[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:04.580]
for you?

[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.060]
What do you say?

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:05.560]
No.

[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:10.360]
Man, cranky, crabby in that perfect for our poll.

[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:12.540]
12 votes on there now.

[00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.580]
The poll is up finally.

[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:15.740]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:18.480]
Miami six, Paris four, New York two, Philadelphia none yet.

[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.400]
None for Philadelphia.

[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.680]
That's because there are a bunch of front running

[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.460]
phoneies, probably see a bunch of people running around

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:26.200]
with flyer jerseys on now all over town.

[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:27.600]
They threw away their red wing jerseys.

[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:29.140]
Now they got flyer jerseys out.

[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:30.640]
I know that crowd.

[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.700]
W-D-Q-A-N.

[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.160]
Hey, that's a meal.

[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.900]
Hey, I want to add to your poll, Boca.

[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:39.000]
Boca?

[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:39.920]
Absolutely.

[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:40.700]
OK.

[00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:42.900]
And I was in Boca.

[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:43.980]
I'll see there I go again.

[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.160]
I think that guy was right, though.

[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:47.780]
George.

[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:47.920]
Yeah.

[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:48.780]
Socks, man.

[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:49.640]
Yeah.

[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.940]
Oh, five six seven, oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T.

[00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.260]
But he didn't give me no alternative.

[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:00.920]
See, I'm asking him, giving an opportunity.

[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.720]
George sucks.

[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.860]
Click any hangs up the phone.

[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.900]
See your phone technique.

[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.140]
A lot of you people, your phone technique is weak, very weak,

[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.440]
weak and weak as we seek to take a leak during the break.

[00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.580]
20 to 10 at five sixty.

[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.560]
There's a fat Alfred Hitchcock on there.

[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.240]
After what happened to them would.

[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.640]
Yeah, what happened to you, man?

[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.240]
Good.

[00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:23.060]
He looks like he got caught at a buffet over the weekend.

[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.500]
It couldn't find a way out the door.

[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:26.900]
Speaking of foods, speaking of people

[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.740]
that are fat and grotesque like Ken Hitchcock.

[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.260]
Kind of curious to see how we play now.

[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.900]
Yeah, so my I think I was going to be your ass forced

[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:33.160]
rate.

[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.480]
I could be wrong, but I think I was going to kick your bloody ass.

[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:36.840]
Do you like the West Boca?

[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.100]
Can you help you lose that this guy?

[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:38.480]
Look at that.

[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:40.240]
This guy can't even get up out of the chair, Hitchcock.

[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.320]
Ken has must match you Alfred Hitchcock or Ken Hitchcock.

[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.140]
You know Ken Hitchcock?

[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:44.440]
No.

[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:45.160]
Shut up.

[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.740]

What do you waste all your time talking about that old man Moe for?

[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.480]
And George blows on the air and why are you doing this and why are you doing it?

[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:08.560]
And Miami is the most obnoxious people on the face of the earth

[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:10.420]
And we're out here to prove it

[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.900]
They're doing a good job today so far

[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.500]
22 out of 51 votes say Miami the most obnoxious people you'll find

[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.900]

Town 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.080]
WQ-YM

[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.720]
Hi is this Neil Ruggers?

[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.560]
Yes sir

[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.280]
Hey Neil I was watching Hardball last night

[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.400]
I'm so sorry

[00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:40.020]
I like that show I like Chris Matthews

[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:41.160]
I don't

[00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:46.020]
Anyway they showed those lunatics and I rack out in the street

[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:46.860]
Yeah

[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:53.060]
And how 60% of the population is Shi and they want an Iatola and they want to rip back

[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.940]
What I ran guys and I just said what in the hell did we go there for

[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.840]
All we did was open up the Pandora's box

[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.480]
Yeah how about the 100% unemployment rate they've got

[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.360]
100% unemployment

[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:10.540]
I mean the people one thing that they keep saying over and over again is that most of us were

[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.380]
Working while Saddamas here as bad as he was we were working we had jobs we had some

[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.080]
Ordered to our lives now there's total this order there's a complete chaos

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.400]
And almost nobody has a job because first of all they have a shop that hasn't been burned down yet

[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.500]
It's been looted they have no merchandise anymore

[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:28.080]
And if they work in some kind of an office most likely the buildings already been blown up

[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.100]
Chris had a on the show Chris had this guy camera with name

[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.960]
He looked middle-easter and he works for Newsweek International

[00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:42.920]
Anyway the guy was saying in order for us to keep from the Shi'ai's from taking over and installing their

[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:47.160]
Theocracy and whatever we'd have to stay there from three to five years

[00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:51.160]
And I'll tell you what I just don't see the Bush administration or any

[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.080]
Administration having to wear with all to stay there for three to five years

[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.480]
And put out with suicide bombings and whatever else goes along

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:03.480]
And especially while we're busy invading Syria and all these other places for example I got a story

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.240]
Here today US has plans to bomb North Korea new plant

[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.040]
So we're going to be real busy I guess have a great day pal good luck to us

[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:15.440]
Pentagon has drawn up plans to bomb an North Korea nuclear plant if it reprocesses spent

[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.520]
Nuclear fuel rods according to an Australian newspaper report yesterday that

[00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:23.060]
Was downplayed quickly by Australian officials citing well-informed can bear

[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:27.320]
Sources close to US thinking the Australians foreign editor Greg Sheridan said US

[00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:33.520]
Is produced a blueprint to bomb young beyond if the plant went ahead with reprocessing spent nuclear fuel rods to make atom bombs

[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:38.580]
He said the plan also involved a US threat against North Korea and heavy artillery in the hills above the border with South Korea

[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:42.440]
Threatening the capital's soul in about 17,000 US troops stationed nearby

[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.880]
But Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer shrugged off the report he said it was a real downer

[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.900]
Which came on the eve of a meeting and beaching between the US China and North Korea

[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:53.580]
Ended ending a six month standoff over Pyongyang suspected arms programs

[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.820]
How do you like that but we're standing by just in case we're ready to bomb them baby

[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:02.100]
We're going to wrap with a bomb a grandeur and then we're going to get Syria and then we're going to get Iran

[00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:05.580]
And then we're going to get Cuba and then we're going to get Mexico and Canada and

[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:10.840]
And Faulkland islands Las Melvinas and who after that Libya

[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:13.980]
Uganda Ireland

[00:38:16.440 --> 00:38:20.400]
Scandinavia and they place else we feel like it on a given day right yeah Sudan

[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:22.540]

[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:32.280]
Sudan for those weak numbers

[00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:36.040]
By the way speaking of numbers Friday market on a calendar baby

[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:38.220]
Oh it's going to be a tremendous day

[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:44.540]
We don't know if it's going to be good or bad but I just have a feeling in my bone and it's going to be really something that we're talking about for months to come

[00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:47.240]
I'll be something other than Moe but we can talk about Moe's bad numbers

[00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.300]
That kind of called a minute ago what what is that all about I mean what where did that come from?

[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.920]
Huh all over the place and what are you talking about Moe and George Stockson

[00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:02.940]

[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:27.320]
Yeah

[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:35.340]
And working with dealing with the people from Boka is it's got to be worse than having your toenails pulled out or must be flyers

[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:35.700]
Holy!

[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.040]
Oh you know Dale you wouldn't believe it if you're so obnoxious

[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:42.040]
Everything is got to be catered to them or never wrong

[00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.340]
As the Tony Bennett show this older guy and his wife were sitting at the wrong seats

[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.760]
And I said sir these people supposed to be in your seats he goes well you know I didn't like the seats that I had so I moved over here

[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.200]
Part

[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.860]
Show the world that my

[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:55.700]
Your life is worth the cake for my religion the reason why

[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.480]
A bomb on my feet

[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.460]
I would a wet spot on your seat

[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.960]
You'll find that I'm an outsider

[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:09.740]
When there's a bomb in my shoe

[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:16.700]
What a wonderful way to drive this way

[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:30.540]
No

[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:34.920]
Well, so the good news is I found that the bad news is I assume since I have these bookabrain archives

[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:38.680]
You know that have allegedly every bit that I ever did in his life and somebody stole from other people

[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:42.240]
Yeah, and it's not on here the book is he's bringing it in today

[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.340]
I know what kind of crap is that why is that not on his archives?

[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:50.440]
I don't know and I you I know it's on meat book a Brian and I used to have a personal copy in here in the studio somewhere

[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:56.000]
I can't find it somebody with that baby. Yeah, somebody with some light finger jackass in that building. Oh, Anthony

[00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.240]
Anthony stole it huh?

[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.780]
Well, I don't know.

[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:04.720]
We got a bunch of light finger clowns running around there and of course Mupp who is among the missing today is what we understand

[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.140]
He's you know they can't do anything for us put a lock on a door do anything like make it a real place of business

[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:14.200]
It's kind of like Iraq all over again. We have a rack nephobia QA and where we place to just open up

[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:19.460]
Yeah, open up the rooms and loot tear hearts content like fat boy used to steal a candy out of the power 96 room

[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.400]
Out of the promotional orifice what he been used to oh and speaking of fat boy so Jeff high yesterday and we talked about him a great length

[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:33.320]
I told him to be the same show today. I get yesterday afternoon a facts two faxes from fat boy hi up alley

[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.420]
You're not getting the food you type of crap and don't lie. We got good memories. Okay?

[00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.120]
You didn't lose any weight on balance for life. He didn't stick to it and you're just a man who is a death wish

[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:47.820]
And like I told you before the show today not only the beast I have no room anymore for fat people with a death wish

[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.920]
But you had friends toast for lunch and I had almost nothing to rest of the day my blood sugar this morning was 116 which ain't too bad

[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.920]
Okay, I'm doing just fine. I'm making nice come back

[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:04.060]
And at least I'm making some kind of a feeble attendance and while I was opposed to these people who pretend if they're not fooling me

[00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:08.120]
Maybe they could fool you for a while because you weren't a fat person, but they're not fooling me because I know what it's all about

[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.660]
Fat people with a death wish

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.140]
We just want you to just you know, they'd like to be buried side by each with you

[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:21.480]
Here's a facts from Stephen and Snotstale who says I'd like to nominate Scottsdale Arizona

[00:49:21.940 --> 00:49:27.160]
For having the most obnoxious people on the face of the earth the people are such right wing goose stepping all about me

[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:32.060]
Buttheads they make my amies population look like intellectuals also. They is Michael Moore's Moore's birthday

[00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:34.840]
How do you like that?

[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.700]
Yes, wife, you know, so I guess we ought to play

[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:43.940]
So that would be a subversive as we're reputed to be an honor of Michael Moore's birthday happy birthday Michael. You're okay in our book

[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.120]
I

[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.600]
Think you like Americans to celebrate by having your original thoughts as Stephen. Thank you Stephen and Snotstale

[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:52.980]
You got that on there Scottsdale Arizona. We got it. You got it

[00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:57.000]
Well now that I got the book of Ryan archives out. This will be good for the noon to one hour

[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:00.300]
Especially to piss off that guy that hates focus so badly

[00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:06.880]
I mean is this pull a difficult question to try to add to it?

[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.100]
I mean, we know we'll talk about whatever the hell they want but the fact of the matter is it seems pretty obvious to me

[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.520]
In what city would you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:18.080]
We're not talking parochial like you know, you know, five blocks up the road

[00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:21.920]
Well, a people let's reblocks away from me on the east side. They're really assholes

[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.320]
Now that's not what we're talking about

[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:29.840]
But this again puts that big spotlight that gigantic focus on just how parochial South Florida is

[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.080]
Evan Tura. I mean just

[00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.120]
Gag me with a prune man, Evan Tura

[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:43.360]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and T in Verizon line WQ I am

Aspen

[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:48.060]
Aspen's band

[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:51.900]
I don't respect

[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:00.160]
Yeah, okay, that's it. No reason. No right. Don't put it on there. I hardly disagree anyway

[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.340]
Well, I mean just just to call to give me the name of a city. How about the Tavia? There's a city

[00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:11.620]
Hamilton Ontario. There's a city WQ I am

[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:13.840]
Yeah, yes, sir

[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:18.980]
I hope you let me finish George's dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's

[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:27.720]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 T and Verizon wireless line

[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.700]
That would be Q I am

[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:36.920]
Being in thin. Yeah, the intense a big yeah, okay? No

[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.180]
No chance

[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5

[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:50.360]
We're picking up where we were off the 11 o'clock hour yesterday. We even had a bald spot guy yesterday

[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:54.140]
The guy started shrieking and yelling about you're lying to us down

[00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:58.480]
And then he just started with a lot of non sequiturs took me about 45 seconds to finger him out. He was okay

[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:00.800]
WQ I am

[00:52:02.620 --> 00:52:04.480]
Q a M yes, sir speaking

[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.280]
Deal. Yes

[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:11.900]
Patrick Watt so much for his greatness nice going by the Minnesota wild by the way

[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.800]
Yeah, it was great the way he just to fake him right out went around him and stuck it in there was beautiful

[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:21.420]
It was a beautiful site and I'm a red wing fan and I'm feeling pretty low now. How about

[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.320]
I'm not Detroit is pretty bad people

[00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:29.660]
Hey man, okay, thank you Detroit not bad. Detroit's pretty disgusting scummy place

[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:33.160]
I don't know if the people are that obnoxious, but we'll put it down just in general principle Detroit

[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:37.920]
He's just looking at his wounds because the wings got swept at least the least one three games anyway, eh?

[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.900]
At least we stretched him to seven against the much better team

[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:46.640]
Right, we just gagged and choked five six seven oh five sixty a lot of playoff hockey if seven

[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.340]
I'm sure in South Florida. I don't mistake about that

[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.280]
Wightening into playoff's not to keep going in one their first round over the capitals

[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:57.140]
Nice going area of Tampa Bay. That's something good. We can say about that not too much

[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440]
How about Loots

[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.220]
WQ I am

[00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.380]
Moe hate line. Yes Moe hate line

[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:09.020]
Moe please take care of that infected meat curtain

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:16.040]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T in Verizon

[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:20.720]
Wireless line. I better get to some of these bedtime stories, you know, because I've only got till noon and

[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.920]
So far I thought this pulled me a piece of cake

[00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:29.460]
But then again, I keep forgetting about how parochial South Florida is now most of these people even though they claim to be from some place else

[00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.240]
The last 20 years they haven't left the north of Palm Beach County that to them is a big outing

[00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.160]
I don't get it

[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:39.540]
Don't want to be going anywhere now though. You never know what you might catch WQ I am

[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.500]
Yes, sir

[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:47.260]
It was a man. Yeah, I'm on hold for like an hour man. What deal with that? We have you on hold?

[00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:51.940]
We're up on anybody on hold. I mean the damn thing was ringing for like a while because we're doing scrimless

[00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:55.700]
You're on right now, man. Don't waste precious time because you could hear that dial tone again real fast

[00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:03.580]
Hey, you need to speed it up with picking up some college men. Yeah, yeah, I'll come down to the States and man's left

[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.860]
Yo, yeah

[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:09.640]
And George, too. Yeah, yeah

[00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:17.560]
Hey, nearly how much relief last night man. Yeah, really five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T

[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.040]
You come on down to the station just beat the crap out of me. Okay, just beat the snout out of me

[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:24.320]
We got a new blow up now sitting there and cheering for anybody might do with that though

[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.280]
I'm not getting a little carried away WQ I am Neil. Yes, sir. Hey

[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.160]
Fallen that guy hey

[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:36.660]
I'm not just people that live here in Miami. Well like the people in New York

[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:39.920]
They were born there in New York. The obnoxious people who live here in Miami

[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:46.600]
They weren't like necessarily born here in Miami. They're from let me let me say this again and let me read it to you again in what city

[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.380]
Will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.640]
The most of us are here. They are here, but they weren't necessarily so what can I finish just finish my point?

[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:58.720]
I'm sorry. The question doesn't imply that they were born there that they lived their entire lives

[00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.680]
They're the question in what city would you find the most out of noxious in other words?

[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.200]
They've gravitated to what place? Well, all right

[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:12.140]
Well, New York and Miami for sure at the top two, but like I say the new the New Yorkers that are here make this place

[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:16.660]
The way it is if they would go back there wouldn't be so many obnoxious people here

[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.200]
And I'm not from here. I'm from somewhere else, but that where you're from where are you from?

[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:22.140]
It's Bert. Oh

[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.600]
I would be pointing too many fingers if I was you

[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.560]
I'm not going back anytime soon. I'll see in the coal mine

[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:33.460]
I'm going to my clang okay and the bill curry remember keep bill career

[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:40.960]
I think he's kind of kid curry at the vote times do the sports on KDK five six seven oh five sixty five sixty on the AT&T

[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:45.860]
That guy to call before in the first hour man. What a trip that is you know been listening since you've been on

[00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:49.760]
But I'm glad Tom jicker got under your skin and they start going to this whole list of everything

[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.880]
He doesn't like whatever the hell we do on the show. I'm real happy with the show lately

[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:57.220]
I'm actually enjoying the show now which it's believed me in the five years we went on this station

[00:55:57.220 --> 00:56:02.940]
I can't think of too many times I could actually say that with all the crap that we've had to overcome we shall overcome

[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:10.400]
That's a theme song on this show as they continue placing obstacles these big hurdles to jump through to try to accomplish anything on QAM

[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:17.520]
Now every time I hear him I just just I get like an extra sensation when I hear Mark Morgan on QAM

[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:20.440]
You know what I mean? No

[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:27.560]
Five six seven oh five sixty five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line now how's the list going?

[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:32.420]
What city will you find a mo I see I think when I ask these poll questions they're fairly straightforward

[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:36.780]
They're fairly simple. We don't have like making the audience jump through hoops to figure out what we're talking about

[00:56:37.420 --> 00:56:42.840]
And we're not talking about little municipalities in parts of South Florida. Okay, just because it may officially be a city

[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:47.400]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.300]
We're trying to build this list. We got 165 votes. We're jane bad, but nevertheless my any 50

[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.820]
New York 39 Paris 36 Voka 27

[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:04.940]
Fill it off the 11 Crawford text and I said what did I say about Crawford Texas George? I don't know what you say about it

[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.580]
I said don't put it on there

[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:10.360]
So nice in there I don't

[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.840]
Can anybody hear the words that are coming from what is it?

[00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:21.340]
You said that about the last one that was that not about Crawford no, I said to don't I said we'll put Washington DC on there

[00:57:21.340 --> 00:57:26.600]
We will not put on it was the guy who said Washington and Crawford. I remember like it was today like it was only moments ago

[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.120]
You know what if a Crawford and not Washington

[00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:31.280]
See that this is what we're dealing with okay

[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.920]
We're dealing with a little bean of boy it sleeps out of an overpass and we expect this guy to know something

[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.800]
You you would know how to find Crawford Texas with both hands, okay?

[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.840]
Much less Washington DC which I guarantee they wouldn't let you're asking it. They probably have like a federal alert

[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.840]
If you drove into town in your little Grava boat

[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:52.680]
Washington these Texas. Oh my god. I you know I give up

[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:58.440]
I just reached the point I just give up you throw your arms up in the air okay. I surrender. Where's the white flag? Where's the white bag?

[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:04.000]
Oh my god Crawford Texas he puts on air but Washington DC doesn't

[00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:09.660]
So we got Crawford Texas with a vote get it off of the Eric and Scottsdale Arizona with one snot steel

[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:14.920]
We've just reached the point where we have a failure to communicate that's the problem on this show

[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:18.640]
Just like me and Moe. I think if we could just communicate no not

[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:25.080]
Silly dotting old fool and oh you talk about silly wait till you hear that well

[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:29.240]
I'm not going to read it the way he wrote it this copy that Troy Stratford desperately tried to pound out here

[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:36.460]
If I could spend I we'd be all ready till 20 afternoon we'd run over longer than Moe does

[00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.300]
Just going over all the mistakes in this copy anyway the panthers and the heater done for the season and that often

Programming a multitude of stations. It's the queer channel radio hole

Once a creative outlet for DJs and talk show hosts now is a big radio hole

[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:47.880]

[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.740]
I was gonna ask you that's on a book a library

[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:07.580]
It's called radio AM radio holes never heard that before my love. That was great. I love that was Anna Maria

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:11.660]
I know that much and was so fine with that book on the background applauding after it was over

[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.920]
Could a swather to him bleeding over

[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.340]
Was that George speaking to me just a moment ago before you opened up a push

[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.420]
That's a similar kind of question is was that vocal laughing in a background?

[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.940]
Oh my god, I'm telling you I

[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.200]
Ii ii ii ii that's all I can say today ii ii ii ii wow

[01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:40.620]
That's almost as good as this fact that informs me heard on Randy Road show yesterday

[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:46.800]
That the Republicans are planning the nominee convention for the September 2004 to coincide with the third anniversary of 9-11

[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:50.960]
Right before the election as we've all been reading in the newspapers anybody reads an article

[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.340]
We had to hear it on Randy show them

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:57.320]
I'm just thanks down in Del Reyvo where we already know that and what can I tell you Democrats are dead

[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.180]
The O A dead

[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.980]
The i w did in the water

[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:04.720]
You think that was book of Brian Schroeling there at the end

[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:12.640]
567 05 60 you know where we're gonna send Carlos for an all expense paid the vacation for one

[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.880]

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.820]
W Q a m

[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.520]
Okay, this is working real well. Let me do the marine dog column. Okay, because I you know they just don't get it

[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.820]
They don't get the question and they're in a real surly mood

[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.700]
They're trying to prove the result of the pull which Miami is leading by the way by over New York when Miami

[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.820]
Can anybody can lead over New York that tells you a lot

[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.840]
Marine dog writes in the today's New York Times with chest banging here and there

[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.700]
There's nothing scarier than conservatives and transports of social and political engineering

[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.500]
The republican strain to appear indifferent to a different different in Iraq now wanting to be cast as overbearing imperialists

[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.820]
Lieutenant J. Garner the new American vice-roy affected dockers look while meeting Arabs and jackets and ties

[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.420]
The Bushes pretend that we don't want all access past Iraqi bases. We do that

[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:31.300]
We're not interested in influencing this position of Iraqi oil. We are that will stay out of Iraqi politics

[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:34.940]
Even if they go fundamentalist we won't and that will leave Iraq soon. We can

[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:41.320]
Even as they staffled their Paxamerican impulses in Iraq the imperialists swagger with a Paxamerican at home

[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:47.560]
Karl Rova's broken creative new ground and appalling political opportunism by pushing back to republican national convention in New York City

[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:53.540]
Does September 2004 see there it is the latest date for a convention in the party's history and only days away from the you know when

[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.160]
Mr

[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.720]
Rova envisions merging the Madison Square Garden party with the 9-11 anniversary commemorations into one big national security

[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:07.300]
Lava Paloza perhaps president Bush would just skip the pretense of the garden and give his acceptance speech at ground zero

[01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:12.960]
Another red meat moment rich sand tour of the obnoxious Pennsylvania senator whose number three in the GOP

[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:19.460]
Equated homosexuality with incest bigamy and polygamy in every society the definition of marriage is not ever to my knowledge

[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:26.600]
Included homosexuality he told the AP. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not you know man on child man on dog or whatever the case may be

[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:34.100]
Even mr. Sandstorms old mentor newt gingrich fell them bolden the slither back on stage with a proposal that we viscerate the state department

[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.600]
After vowing to reshape the American character when it became speaker 94 mr

[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.240]
Gingrich ultimately faced ethics questions and criticism for having an extramarital affair with the young congressional aid

[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.620]
After pushing for Bill Clinton's impeachment over his extramarital affair with a young white house aid

[01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:53.100]
He stepped down in 98 gingrich did the man who once depicted himself as an arouser of those who formed civilization

[01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:58.960]
Step back yesterday and we'll clash the civilizations between the Pentagon and the state department and remarks at the temple of

[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.780]
Tramphalism here the American Enterprise Institute mr

[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:08.060]
Gingrich denounce colon Paul's domain is a broken bureaucracy of red tape and excuses and demanded it be transformed like rameys

[01:05:08.540 --> 01:05:14.620]
The attack mr. Paul for announcing that he would visit rather than bomb Damascus and for pre-war failure of diplomacy with turkey

[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:20.000]
Conveniently ignoring the fact that it was the Pentagon Hawk Paul Wolfowitz who would try to fail the talk turkey with turkey

[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:25.840]
Rameys taken on a Mars-like glow among carnivorous conservatives who crave more and more and more red meat

[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:30.380]
Circulated a kubrickian memo on North Korea according to the times David Sanger while mr.

[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:34.400]
Powell pressed for diplomatic talks in China to help deescalate tensions between the US and North Korea

[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:39.420]
Rameys memo suggested that the US and China gang up on the crazed Kim Jong-il the force of a gene change

[01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:42.320]
Even as the conservatives some their chest in Washington

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:47.680]
They've gotten a little bit nervous watching thongs of men flogging their chest bloody in Karbala Karbala

[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.620]
Their cool irrational schemes for establishing 18th century style democracy have run up against eight century practices of Islam

[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:59.320]
The Bushes were unpleasantly surprised by the sudden muscularity of the Shiite clerics in southern Iraq

[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:05.560]
According to the times Iranian trained operatives have crossed into southern Iraq to help the Shiites who are demanding a state like Iran's

[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:10.860]
And administration officials have whispered other fears to be porters that some of the weapons of mass destruction may have been removed

[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:16.120]
Assault in the terrorism black market accelerating the proliferation and proliferation they had hoped to prevent or that

[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:21.020]
Sodom loyalists are sneaking back into the government waiting for the Americans who with their short attention spans to pull out

[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:26.080]
As long as these bathas haven't seen Americans rapidly digging up Sodom's corpse or his WMD

[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:31.500]
They can always hope rights more in doubt at today's New York time. How do you like that? I like it boys and girls

[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:41.060]

I've had the misfortune because I have family there to visit the city on many occasions

[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:43.900]
But I find Atlanta Georgia

[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:49.980]
Oh to have some of the most obnoxious people I have ever met and that all of them work at CNN

[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:52.000]
Only most of them

[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:58.180]
I just I can't stand going there. I can't stand the people. They just think that their stuff doesn't think really

[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.920]
Really they really think that their city is just

[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:07.020]
You know cream of the crop. It's a pretty it's a really Yahoo place. I'm in many times. It's a very Yahoo

[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:10.900]

You know crackers. I mean it they don't get it

[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:19.620]
They think that they are world class that they've got everything going for them and they they walk around you know very

[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.720]
Hoidy toy toady and I just I hate going there and I actually like coming back here when I'm there

There you go. That's always a good idea find some place that you hate like poison go there for a couple of days

[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:33.700]
Then you really want to come back to South Florida something that makes you want to come back like to spend a weekend in Tampa

[01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:37.540]
That'll do it. I went to school there. I know I went came home every weekend

[01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.820]

Well, somebody will have to look at it for me there

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.220]

Like the all new bacon and egg bar sounds okay, but I hardly every back kind of breakfast. We hear you

[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:50.040]
So generic mills has made every conceivable breakfast into a delicious bar. There's the two day old pizza and Mountain Dew bar

[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:56.000]
The hostess cupcake and you who bar or the alarmingly popular black coffee and moral burrow light bar

[01:11:57.800 --> 01:12:03.540]
And for those who need a little hair of the dog try the all new shot of bourbon and beer chaser bar

[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:03.740]
hmm

[01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:15.000]
Now I thought I call breakfast generic mills breakfast bars when it comes to artificial breakfast foods for people who've stopped caring we've raised the bar

[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:22.380]
It's 1032 I screwed up the beginning of that because I was busy distracted trying to find the attendance 10,000 one 15 was the announced attendance

[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:28.940]
The last time. I'm sure you already had that for me being a boy right? Yeah, I did of course my skull get that on the list

[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:32.900]
Oh, we shall get to momentarily in the effects that inspired me then

[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.360]
My name is winning, but it's tight between my man

[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:40.520]
I see Paris the reason they're saying that when you know what the reason is they're saying that even though of course it is true

[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:45.940]
My ami 64 Paris 59 New York 50 Volka 39 full-fledelvia 15

[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.400]
DC's got a Paris a snot stale so you know one Detroit don't have any 231 vote

[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.940]
Here's a very very interesting facts

[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:00.480]
Inside information to be broadcast inside the wqm building. I better get out my megaphone

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.740]
We don't want to put this on the air get more upset

[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:11.100]
It says the NFL draft QAM broadcast party this Saturday from noon till question mark will be hosted by former

[01:13:11.100 --> 01:13:16.080]
Mimey Dolphin Dolphin's broadcaster and QM host Jim Mad Dog Mandage. Oh right

[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:20.380]
Appearance is also be made by the QM personalities like Steve Goldie Goldstein the big

[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:29.640]
Oh and former Dolphin the big dog Joe Rose Dolphins play by play broadcaster and QAM host Howard David may not be able to attend as he has other commitments to these stars for stars foundation

[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.880]
And they're weakened at Turnberry aisle

[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:35.680]
Now who would he be fooling with that if he pulled that off everybody

[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:37.880]
You wouldn't know he would not be fooling anybody

[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.440]
Because he's already been pontificating for weeks on the air about he's not gonna go unless the man who don't put in the suit

[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:47.520]
Who don't I'm putting the suit gets it straight not and pays him extra and he's not gonna show up

[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.420]
This sounds to me like the kind of stuff he did with Westwood one that got him uninvited to come back now

[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.060]
It could be wrong

[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.760]
I'm just reading between the lines

[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.120]
But of course it's nobody that building communicates with us and we get no information whatsoever

[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:01.680]
We have to rely on our sources on a fags machine. Isn't that basically how it works?

[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:02.020]
Right

[01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:07.560]
Because we get no information from clearance from muff. They're all in hiding now

[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:10.020]
They're holding their meat or whatever they're doing and by the way

[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:13.660]
They weren't I heard before to show today is that Carlos got infected by muff. That's what I heard

[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:15.480]
I don't want to give you any details

[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:17.480]
Huh

[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:24.620]
Well kid curry was wondering what the gigantic lump was on his throat and I just told you got infected by the operations manager

[01:14:24.620 --> 01:14:27.780]
I can't go into the groy details, but that's the rumor I'm hearing

[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.180]
There is a spot marked on the wall right out there by the control room for the other shows

[01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:39.580]
Grenadis Connecticut for the pull somebody says actually it says any city in Connecticut. Let's put grenades on here

[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:43.620]
Can you spell it right green which? I'm not talking about you and talking about being a boy

[01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:47.460]
He's got a lot of stress. He's not a gruttenport contracted his illness

[01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.540]
They said they'd contract him

[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.540]
Here's the fact that says Woodward's book

[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.500]
Oh yeah, I wouldn't read that Bush at war in general is a genuine reflection to W

[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:01.920]
But there was two things of note. I thought you might want to know one is a quote lifted from juniors daily journal

[01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:07.220]
Commenting on the Afghan war George W wrote this is a war in which people were going to have to die

[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:10.420]
duh no Schmitt it says people die in wars who knew

[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.960]
The other thing was about your personal good friend condolese on page 92 would we write about a cabinet meeting at camp David

[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.660]
Rice led the group in a sing-along of American standards including old man river

[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:22.280]
Oh

[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.260]
Nobody knows the trouble I've seen

[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.080]
Oh an America the beautiful

[01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:31.340]
What no-led Zeppelin tunes it says

[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:37.420]
Undoubtedly the worst place on earth is Moscow went there for a conference and the people like to be the most obnoxious ever anywhere

[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.080]
So let's we got Moscow on the list

[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:45.720]
How do you like that that old man river sounds like that dinner we had that one night at the macaroni grill remember that right?

[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.320]
Shufo was up there on the table with those shoes that were like four sizes too big like the like what's his name?

[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.400]
What was the name of the waiter and Lakasha full? I mean the maid

[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.940]
I don't know it's 100 years ago

[01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:58.920]
It'll come to me

[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:01.120]
Remember when he came in with those shoes

[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:08.740]
Yeah, Fagador and I know not not what I'm talking about that Robin Williams remake. We're talking about the real one like Kajafol

[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:10.480]
Dezenerit

[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:17.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:18.880]
WQ a in

[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:24.720]
Q a.m. Hey, how are you doing buddy? Okay, sir?

[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:32.840]
Hi, are you sitting down? I'm I'm strapped in all right buddy 10,150 was announced attending no

[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:36.500]
Yeah, that's right. That's pretty good. Okay. Thanks a lot pal

[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:41.720]
Oh

[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.080]
I heard Dr. Rackens died

[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.400]
Yeah, he did

[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:51.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:56.260]
I think that's actually pretty good number for the email walkie brewer is a non-edited team which of course is owned by the

[01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.360]
The commissioner baseball with nobody can figure that out

[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:05.340]
Who's got interest in one of the teams that he's commissioner don't make too much sense to me. No, but nevertheless. It's all corrupt anyway

[01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.860]
WQ a.m. Yeah, hi. Yes, sir

[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.280]
I just want to make make a couple comments

[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.580]
you know about North Korea and

[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.440]
And uh, Iraq yeah

[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:26.460]
Oh, is this deals. Yeah. Oh, hi Neil. Hi, I know you catch on

[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.540]
You know, I love you. I just want to say I love you, but the thing I want to make comment on it's kind of funny

[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.600]
How Jim John, you know come out and say it basically

[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.300]
You know, you know, chair what we say he's gonna make nuclear weapons

[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:44.620]
But uh, you know really thought I was saying even though he is a dirtbag and it's not bad

[01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.340]
You never said he was gonna, you know, fly out make nuclear weapons and stuff like that and attack us

[01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:53.820]
And they have found no weapons and mass destruction in that country and hogs glitches and even said that

[01:17:53.820 --> 01:17:59.280]
The information is broken since the United States, you know, gave but they don't want to attack North Korea

[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:05.400]
What's up with that? Why don't they want to do that? Because if they attack North Korea that the movie like a five six million people in saw

[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.580]
Would be dead on the first day. That's probably why

[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.940]
Okay, cuz I I just don't understand their uh

[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:14.060]
How they could go after a country that we conquered him

[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:19.580]
But you don't understand that's the reason they picked it just like a way we've been telling you for for weeks now

[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:24.340]
That there was not a game plan to pick on a country that was that had two thirds of its army already annihilated

[01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:28.020]
That had no defenses to speak of and we could go in there in a couple of weeks or three weeks

[01:18:28.020 --> 01:18:32.160]
Whatever it was and just blow right through there and of course now the obvious question is now that we're there

[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:34.440]
What the hell do we do with the mess that we made then we've got left?

[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.220]
Right because they got about five or six the ten different tribes of people

[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:43.140]
How you gonna bring all those people together and out of Shia majority is like totally up in arms

[01:18:43.140 --> 01:18:45.460]
They want us out and they under estimated the Shia

[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:51.500]
Uh, Stink. So there what are they gonna do now to bring that country together so that they don't have the same that's gone on

[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:57.220]
Like they did not ran in the early 80 just keep in mind we liberated them so they could do all these grotesque things

[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.960]
They're doing right now we liberated them so they could turn the country into a religious not my place

[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.680]
But hey better than then Franklin Graham

[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:04.620]
And

[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:09.240]
Work to tell me before the show that Pat Robertson has come out and said very strongly that he wants to make sure the world

[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:13.260]
We put in a secular state in Iraq. We don't want no theocracy. They're like in Iran

[01:19:13.260 --> 01:19:17.620]
We want to have a secular state because if we had a theocracy that would keep him in his Christian fanatics out

[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:21.440]
He don't want no part of that. He he's already salivating rubbing his hands together

[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.980]
Waiting to get his hands on all those the denaris just like Rimmer looking for them free deniers when he gets up here

[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:29.180]
No chance is the rumor no shot

[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:30.880]
It's a

[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.500]
Mara's D day man. This is the day the maras today the rumors are showing up up here. Oh god

[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:40.300]
So if I'm not here tomorrow morning when you come in just do the show you know, I'm just hiding either I got stars or I'm hiding or both

[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:45.320]
I think there's a much better chance I'm going into hiding and oh, I got a great idea yeah

[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.060]
Yeah, if I get that phone call I don't want to make you know names

[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.720]
But if I get a certain phone call from a certain somebody I might say I'm having trouble breathing

[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:55.400]
And like that, you know that might get the job done

[01:19:56.640 --> 01:20:01.080]
Maybe these respiratory problems. Oh, I got a bad headache and I just took my temperature. It's about

[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.460]
152 in a shade

[01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:05.840]

Because as usual, I wasn't paying a lot of attention

[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:47.260]
I was getting prepared for whatever crap I was going to do here, but it sounded to me

[01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:52.400]
Like it was a promo for the draft day festivities on QM this Saturday. Right here we go

[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:58.120]

That's it. Well, I guess you'll have to tune in Saturday to find out of course Friday when that book comes out

[01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:13.160]
He might now want to show his face in public on Saturday. You never know

[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.160]
We're asking today on neo-rangers.com in what city would you find the most obnoxious people

[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:22.080]
Based on my experience with those Philadelphia sports fans

[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:27.540]
And I use that term very loosely because they are obnoxious. They're disgusting. They're boisterous. They're out of controller assholes

[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:32.320]
Paris let's see. Pirate. Oh my am just a tide perist for for 74

[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:34.420]
New York 55

[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.740]
Boka 45 Boka. God. I wish we had that song

[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:47.380]
And then it's way down to pilpit. Alpheus 16 DC 4's got a stonk stellar result has got one Detroit one and no votes for Atlanta or a Moscow yet

[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:51.360]
I thought we'd get a much more diverse list than this wouldn't you?

[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:55.200]
I think but we just our audience just don't get around that much

[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:59.240]
Here's the facts from Maria who is not a chronic by the way. She says I don't want to be a chronic

[01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.980]
Um the person who fact you did the day regarding the beast after the hurricane game

[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:08.860]
At the game I I'm hearing your reaction since then my friend called me this morning and jokingly asked me if I'm able to sleep

[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:13.680]
And I'd after dropping the dime on the beast if you drop the dime on him it would bounce but that's about all

[01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:17.060]
You know how many yards it would probably bounce

[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:19.680]
Oops

[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.200]
I just thought you should know that I'm not heartless. I do kind of feel bad. Don't feel bad Maria

[01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.900]
I just think it's a shame. He lost all that weight 62 pounds

[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:34.800]
He doesn't have the willpower to continue especially since all the food he is to eat to lose the way this prepared form

[01:24:34.800 --> 01:24:35.960]
It should be a no-brainer here

[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:39.660]
He's getting all of this great food for free. They've been bringing it right through his door

[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:43.940]
We've been talking about him making him the star the centerpiece. He doesn't want to lose it

[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:48.700]
I know the difference believe me. This is a young man with the death wish. He doesn't want to lose it

[01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:51.760]
You know what I'm saying? Yeah

[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:55.140]
In addition to which he doesn't understand anything about credibility

[01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.480]
He doesn't care about our sponsor

[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.080]
He doesn't care about his own credibility if I came on here

[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:05.060]
It's a oh, I'm not a 140 pounds on balance for life if I did that and then I showed up in town when I'm gonna be back in a few weeks

[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.980]
And then what happened the only find it did you game it all back how can you do that?

[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:14.400]
To be showing up at the ball game and at the rascal house. I'll never forgive him for that

[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.620]
Forget about eating there just even showing up there

[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:23.820]
I mean Robert Giepper that's a perfect place for a griepper. Okay professional self-hating Jew who's an oldie-entity in the training

[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.960]
Oh brother perfect place for him, huh? Maybe he was buying

[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.040]
That's not relevant. Okay, we're not talking about rumor. We're talking about the old

[01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.900]
She says I hope for his sake he gets it together soon. Well, I hope so too

[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:43.340]
But I'm I washed my hands a bit. I can't I can't use this show as like a reform school for pat people the rest of my life can't do it

[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:49.960]
You really let us down okay, and in addition to which you're always right you're unprofessional in those broadcasts and a hurricane

[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:52.380]
We got too many children on the Uricume and that's the problem

[01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:58.740]
It's like it's like a broadcasting school. It's like the queue and that that did that we play that's why everybody likes it so much because it's

[01:25:58.740 --> 01:26:00.280]
Twu it's Twu

[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:05.880]
I'm not saying that they're all I mean like Lenny Martez. He's a good guy, but it's Twu he can't speak either Lenny Martez

[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.180]
He knows it. He knows he can't speak. That was he ever doing on the year

[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:15.760]
Am I right? He knows it doesn't stop him, but it's Twu though and it's Twu. Yes

[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:18.960]
God almighty what a place

[01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:22.920]
But you know you're gonna have a whole bunch of flunkies around a worksheet like you know clearance

[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:32.100]

He's got a shaved chest at this uh at this point

[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:51.820]
I don't want to hear about those tests. That's the last thing. I want to even think about it close. Oh no

[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:55.420]
Makes me think around Jeremy all over again

[01:26:56.220 --> 01:27:02.060]
He got a shaved chest. I mean he had an EKG is at it. Yes and and he's just fine

[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.020]
No, he he's starting to get a real uh neurotic uh, what do they call it?

[01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:10.960]
Hypochondria hype that's the word I'm looking for hypochondriac

[01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:13.340]

Watching run like a son of a bitch

[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.380]
So what was the problem? He was at the doctor this morning again. He spent an awful lot of time at the doctors

[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:31.820]
Yeah, well you can't be uh, you know

[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:38.520]
Lacks we might have to like isolate him for a while might have to put him like in a rubber room again for a couple of months

[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:44.140]
Just so everybody else can be safe. Look we did the board beater boy. That's a big lump on his neck

[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:46.980]
That was done a freedom kiss

[01:27:49.460 --> 01:27:55.220]

[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.640]
There are plenty of obnoxious people Amsterdam, but

[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:37.820]
It's not under running with some of these others. They're plenty of really nasty rotten and most of them are Dutch

[01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:45.960]
5670560 pound five 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. We had that one lady on air. We're giving me a little bit of hope

[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.320]
You know, I thought we have a whole bunch of women calling today with suggestions or other brilliant comments

[01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:51.300]
No, not a chance

[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.240]
Somebody Qa m

[01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:59.700]
How about the disgusting fans and Oakland who after the Raiders lost they rioted

[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:00.180]
Yeah

[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.020]
Well, this isn't so much about sports, but I think in general you got a good point

[01:29:04.020 --> 01:29:07.360]
We'll put that on her Oakland is okay because we're desperate for some additions Oakland's good

[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:12.540]
So he's thinking strictly in the sports German and it's part of our problem is that we're on a sports radio station

[01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:16.540]
It's the kiss of death. It's a curse. Glad that you're okay, Duff by the way

[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.580]
But that's uh, you know all this time as a doctor

[01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:22.560]
Duff get off this incident how am I to talk, you know

[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:28.380]
With a stroke and our governor knows what's coming next probably pops him roids. I don't quit eating that French toast

[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.140]
It's kind of the way of punishing you. You know that don't you?

[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:40.160]
5670560 pound five 60 on the AT&T line. Miami's got to eat two votes per 76. Miami's pulling away and deservedly so

[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:42.500]
They must be listening to the show

[01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.460]
New York 59

[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:48.520]

Somebody QAM on the death line. Hello. Yes, you have Philadelphia in your list. Yes

[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:09.260]
Uh, they broke my heart is what they did they broke I know they're gonna get the rest kicked

[01:30:09.740 --> 01:30:11.600]
Once it got to be too nothing. I mean at that point

[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.920]
I was right they're gonna get the rest kicked and I just went up for a walk. It was beautiful outside

[01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.780]
Well actually was like

[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:20.800]
Sleeding and nasty and cold. I still had a better time. You know what I mean?

[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.020]
No, you don't want to watch this sporting event when you know your team is gonna get crushed

[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:29.560]
I kept the tape running just in case some miracle happened which it didn't and I just got that lot of here

[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:34.600]
Went to my little convenience store. I put on my mask. I got some diet soda. I mean, I did some productive stuff

[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:40.460]
As opposed to sitting here watching some ball stupid sports event. I knew there was a foregone conclusion

[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:42.700]
By the way George, what do you ever do to him?

[01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.480]
To set him off that way. I have no idea, but I'd like to know so I can do it again. WQ I am

[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:55.380]
Good morning. How are you? Yes sir? When is this? I'm listening you driving to the keys. I called you a couple weeks ago

[01:30:55.380 --> 01:31:02.280]
And I have the same comment someone needs to just smash how we're David in the mouth and get rid of his arrogance. Yeah

[01:31:02.840 --> 01:31:04.000]
They eat this a punk

[01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.840]
An old punk see what I think of punk with a hair piece

[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:10.640]
I'll read

[01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:18.440]
Okay, I have a great day. Have a safe trip amigo. Thank you. Bye-bye an old punk with a bad hair piece, huh

[01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:24.840]
So the promos says how are David at but I noticed they say his name real fast in their coat about how they've been a gemandage

[01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:30.740]
Huh and the memo now maybe be careful coming here and straight you out on that and because we'd like to know

[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:35.860]
The voices that often's must be on that broadcast and and I almost forgot about this remember I told you

[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:39.860]
And then we go Sunday at the airport when I was leaving and he was coming back from Detroit. Yes

[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:43.600]
So one of the things he mentioned to me is guess who he ran into

[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.300]
Who got an offer to do a play-by-play or maybe I shouldn't say it on the air. Well, he got an offer or something

[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:50.800]
I don't know if he's taking it or not

[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:56.920]
His good buddy pills in for it. So it's in for his gun to be just fine. He's doing great. But he's he loves bills in for my dog

[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.760]
They worked really well together for a law for nine years. I think it was

[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.800]
On those dolphin broadcasts. Yeah

[01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:04.280]

1056 at 560 wqa.m

[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:11.420]
Let me tell you right now about a great place speaking of being around for a long time more not as nine years

[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:16.000]
But 25 years in town very few businesses of any kind last that long in this market

[01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:19.900]
But Brandy shoes is celebrating the 25th year in business in South Florida this year

[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.620]
Any independent family shoe store or any other kind of business that last that long got to be treating their customers

[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:28.900]
Right and doing you a lot of great things like giving you an unbeatable selection and they do they got rock ports

[01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:04.780]

[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:37.920]
Come on senator

[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.720]
Senator go wouldn't it be better to have big deficit? That's not a bad idea

[01:33:44.260 --> 01:33:48.860]
It gives us $400 billion to the meat maybe even for the Clinton library perfect

[01:33:48.860 --> 01:33:54.500]
Leadership is about bad economics and can you believe women's right is wrong because we're stronger

You get into that if I need rubbed because I went out there to see if any of the powers that be know the answer the powers that p

[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.600]
To that question about mo and the draft and everything like that and and they're all in a big promotions meeting

[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:29.300]
So there was no one to talk to a promotions meeting

[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:32.420]
Yeah, WQM a promotions meeting right

[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:37.100]
Now is Doreen playing pivot man in this meeting

[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:45.720]
These are the meetings where they tell Miguel to take that big prize machine out way more often because that's why the promotions

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:52.420]
Events suckers because the prize machine isn't out there speaking of sucking the rumor around the building was and it drifted all

[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:57.780]
Away up here wafted by the facts machine that the only reason we got those trips to give away and at hot couples contest was because

[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:00.760]
Finally after being pressured for how many years has it been now?

[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:03.260]
Miguel had a service Doreen to squeeze those trips out of

[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:05.020]
That's what I'm hearing

[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:11.460]
Boy the good thing he's in that meeting not hearing that all we do like to read a lot since she got into what with mo

[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:15.500]
Seeing again if it was just me like that chair guys called in the 9 o'clock hour

[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:19.300]
Well, you know you and a small what kind of person is he to pick on he's a sad old fart

[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:23.440]
It's trying to get everybody can't and stirred up more crap in the last year than all the other 5,000 people

[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:27.500]
I've worked for in the last 500 years put together. That's what we is a

[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:30.180]
nasty miserable mean-spirited old fart a

[01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:35.460]
Professional rabble rousing trouble making egotist asshole, but other than he's okay

[01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.700]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people?

[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.300]
I don't think they like to pull the day. I mean we got over 300 votes, but it's not you know

[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.680]
It's not heavy duty 319 in addition to which I don't think they get it anyway

[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:54.280]
I think if we put like if we made it into like a local dispute you know what I mean like avid chura and you know my city's more obnoxious than yours is plantation

[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.040]
Yeah, whatever well, there's something for another day maybe no, I'm not gonna

[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600]
Piddle around with that sophomore kind of crap

[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:02.280]
talk about

[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:04.080]
Perocchio

[01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:09.200]
In fact, isn't that what they want to do? Yeah, it's all good at break-ass school

[01:36:10.460 --> 01:36:15.040]
Anyway, Miami's got 96 Paris 85 Miami's leaving Paris in the uh in the

[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:21.300]
Thing in its wake just like Mo left you in his wake how did smell

[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:24.420]
funky New York 64

[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:30.180]
Volka 54 I'll tell you for a Voka for a little horseball place like that 54 votes is a lot that kind of was very

[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:36.200]
enthusiastic about that and adamant and foaming at the mobs your friend Danny from Atlantis. Yeah, I think he had a good pointer too

[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:40.940]
Atlantis is that one of your swing clubs club Atlantis down on the beach

[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.200]
It's nightclub fake. Yeah, or what would you say like I'm supposed to know what that is?

[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:51.980]
It was very controversial for a while. They were having lots of fights. I know that. I do know that

[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.120]
I remember that very well, but am I supposed to like hang out there?

[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:59.620]
How about the button on the beach? Oh, we never even mentioned about crazy. What's his name?

[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:01.120]
Dieter here a couple of months ago crazy

[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:09.200]
The this the beach guy for Lauderdale the father of spring break. What was his crazy break? We got right crazy Greg Nuel. Oh, geez

[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:15.400]
I must have been off that week or something guy and of course as usual you overlook the important things

[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.860]
You don't pay tribute to a guy that really deserved it Greg Nuel

[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:19.220]
He was the he was a fun guy

[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.360]
He was the father of having a good time on for Lauderdale beach and then all the stagie goi him came along

[01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:27.680]
Oh, no, we don't want that and then the BS but they came in there and start beating the crap out of all the kids

[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.060]
Anybody in these of a hundred not wanted here? Oh

[01:37:31.060 --> 01:37:32.440]
Brother what a place

[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:38.840]
Miami 96 Paris 85 New York 64 book and 54 Philadelphia 18 DC five and

[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.460]
And that's it the other ones either have one or none

[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.500]
I've never been able to figure out the ones that have none because people call them in and then they don't vote for it

[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.140]
Well, maybe those people don't have a pewter, you know

[01:37:49.180 --> 01:37:53.160]
Anyway, this is interesting. I think the Palm Beach troublemaker for fact he listen

[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.300]
It says as luck would have it. This is from the LA weekly

[01:37:59.040 --> 01:37:59.520]
A

[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.460]
911 victim testifies that the carnage could have been averted

[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:06.580]
Mindy Kleinberg began by telling of a fall day in the northeast

[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:12.280]
So warm and clear that she literally skipped home after seeing off her 10-year-old and seven-year-old at the school bus stop

[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:17.720]
On that day September 11, 2001 her 38-year-old husband a stock trader with

[01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:23.060]
Cantifid sterile in the World Trade Center lost his life along with some three thousand others in that day's terrorist attacks

[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:26.400]
Kleinberg testified last week before the national luck

[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:32.300]
This is 11-month two weeks ago before the National Commission investigating in 911 the commission took two days of testimony

[01:38:32.300 --> 01:38:40.560]
Just blocks away from ground zero hearing both from survivors and from experts who spoke of the hijackers financial sources and US intelligence lapses

[01:38:41.100 --> 01:38:45.060]
Although Kleinberg's husband was unlucky. It wasn't bad luck that cost his life. She asserted

[01:38:45.060 --> 01:38:49.100]
Kleinberg detailed the good luck of the hijackers who could have been stopped at many points

[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:52.560]
Most of her account is fully documented some allocations await investigation

[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.800]
And it has here excerpts from Mindy Kleinberg statement

[01:38:56.480 --> 01:39:01.800]
It has been said that the intelligence agencies have to be right a hundred percent of the time in the terrorist only have to get lucky once

[01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:06.840]
9-11 terrorists weren't just lucky once they were lucky over and over again allowing to illustrate the SEC

[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:12.020]
The terrorist lucky streak began the week before 9-11 when the Securities and Exchange Commissioner SEC

[01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.400]
The SEC and Council with the US intelligence agencies has sophisticated software programs that are used in real time

[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.460]
To watch both domestic and overseas markets to seek out trends that may indicate a prisoner future crime

[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:28.860]
On the Chicago Board of Options Exchange during the week before 9-11 put options were purchased on American and United Airlines

[01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:33.840]
The two airlines involved in the attacks the investors who placed these orders were gambling that in the short term

[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.160]
The stock prices of both airlines would plummet

[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:41.020]
Never before on the Chicago Exchange were such large amounts of United and American Airlines options traded

[01:39:41.020 --> 01:39:45.420]
These investors needed a profit of at least five million dollars after 9-11 attacks

[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:50.860]
Interestingly the names of these investors remain undisclosed and the five million dollars remains unclaimed

[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:57.000]
Why were theseabyrinth trades not discovered prior to 9-11? Who were the individuals who placed these trades have been investigated

[01:39:57.780 --> 01:39:58.580]
The INS

[01:39:58.580 --> 01:40:03.600]
Prior to 9-11 our US intelligence agents. You should have stopped the 19 terrorists from entering this country

[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.060]
What does it say sure should have the out of the out of the out of the outing and they would have reached their new

[01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:13.320]
City in Pentagon within moments intercepted the hijacked airliners before they could have hit their targets undowably

[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.960]
Say is there a page missing on this? I don't know you didn't fax me the middle page

[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:24.600]
I just have to say page 103 oh my god, you're I wouldn't know what is going from oh, that's embarrassing huh

[01:40:25.720 --> 01:40:28.880]
Where is page dose? Well, that's okay. We'll just skip to our leadership

[01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:32.480]
There's some more interesting stuff on you and you infested me

[01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:36.880]
I'll find a secretary. I beg your pardon if it came over. I'll find it

[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:40.460]
Secretary of Defense has reported secretary rumsfeld fell to Pentagon

[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:46.180]
Shake one outside saw that image and started helping the injured on the stretchers after eating the victims the secretary

[01:40:46.180 --> 01:40:48.240]
Then went into the war room guess what I was it

[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:49.800]
I beg your pardon. That's all

[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.720]
They skipped it. I don't have it. Were you calm down?

[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.760]
Now he's interrupting me at the most the audience is on pins and needles are on the edge of their seats

[01:40:58.640 --> 01:40:59.940]
Aren't you on the edge of your seat?

[01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:02.440]
Kind of in the middle push him off Carlos

[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.860]
How is it possible that the National Military Command Center located in the Pentagon in a contact with law enforcement and

[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:16.160]
Inter traffic controllers from 848 am did not communicate to the secretary of defense also with the Pentagon about the other hijacked plane

[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:19.320]
Especially the one headed to Washington. How is that possible?

[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:26.600]
The president on the morning of 911 president Bush was scheduled to listen to elementary school children read before the president walked into the classroom

[01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:31.100]
Norrad had sufficient information at the plane that hit the world trade center was hijacked at that time

[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:35.120]
They also acknowledge that two other commercial airliners in the year were also hijacked

[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:37.380]
It would seem that a national emergency was in progress

[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.540]
Yet president Bush was allowed to enter a classroom full of young children and listen to the students read

[01:41:42.540 --> 01:41:47.560]
Why didn't the secret service informer of this national emergency? Maybe they thought it was going to be a learning experience

[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:52.580]
In the case of a national emergency seconds of indecision could cost thousands of lives

[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:58.280]
Is it luck that aberrant stock trades weren't monitored? Is it luck when 15 visas are worded based on incomplete forms?

[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:02.740]
Is it luck when airline security screenings allow hijackers to board planes with box cutters and pepper spray?

[01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.980]
Is it luck when emergency FAA and or had protocols are not followed?

[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:09.820]
Is it luck when a national emergency is not reported top government officials on a timely basis?

[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:15.740]
To me luck is something that happens once when you have this repeated pattern of broken protocols broken laws

[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:18.100]
Broken communication one cannot still call it luck

[01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:22.340]
If at some point we don't look to hold these individuals accountable for not doing their jobs properly

[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:24.800]
Then how can you expect terrorists not to get lucky again?

[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.680]
And that's why I'm here with you all the days

[01:42:26.680 --> 01:42:29.200]
You said because you must find the answers is to what happened that day

[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.900]
So was to ensure that another 9-11 cannot happen again

[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:36.020]
And this was part of our testimony front of congress about two weeks ago. How do you like that?

[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:39.080]
Mindy Kleinberg who's husband died in the WTC

[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:42.240]
Sorry about that missing page and there aren't we George well

[01:42:42.240 --> 01:42:46.400]
And they try to do a good job. They'll be fact that I'm sure they'll be fact sitting and we'll stick it in there

[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.740]
We're not depending on this rick san tour. I'm thinking has got a lot of people really parked off

[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:51.400]
I shouldn't I don't know why I shouldn't surprise anybody

[01:42:51.860 --> 01:42:56.420]
That's why I want to his first vaccine here on Monday. I just looked at it and thought I'm more the same cramp same old same old

[01:42:58.080 --> 01:43:02.560]
Rick san tour. I'm senator pennsylvania republican senator pennsylvania thinks the homos are bad

[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:08.840]
He says if the supreme court says that you have the right to consensual gay sex within your home

[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.320]
Then you have the right to bigamy you have the right to polygamy you have the right to incest you have the right to adultery

[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:17.080]
You have the right to anything san tourms said in his ap interview which is published on Monday

[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:22.440]
Gay groups were quick to announce and tourms comments the latest in the series of divisor remarks by some lawmakers

[01:43:22.860 --> 01:43:27.720]
Senator san tourms or ars are deeply hurtful and play on deep-seated fears that fly in the face of scientific evidence

[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.540]
Common sense and basic decency

[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:35.620]
Clearly there's no camp compact in his conservatism said when he's stackled bird political director for the human rights campaign

[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:38.620]
The nation's largest gay and viscous advocacy group

[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:43.160]
She called for quick and decisive action by republican leaders to repudiate san tourms remarks and of course

[01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:49.160]
She's still waiting the democratic senatorial campaign committee called on san term to resign is chairman of the republican senate caucus

[01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.460]
The number three position in the gop leadership g between trend lot of rick san tourms

[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:57.240]
This conservative compassion is just uh, what is it?

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:01.320]
Out of control compact and conservative muddard heli call it

[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:05.680]
In a statement released yesterday san term didn't dispute the accuracy of the quote

[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.920]
But criticize the apster as misleading he sent his comment was specific to the pending supreme court case

[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:13.840]
I'm a firm believer that all are equal under the constitution

[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:17.800]
He said my comments should not be construed in any way as a statement on individual lifestyles but

[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:22.240]
According to unedited excerpts of the taped interview released late Tuesday by the ap

[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:28.200]
san term spoke had to length about homosexuality made it clear he did not approve of acts outside of traditional heterosexual

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:34.380]
Relationship acts just like any of you used to say it's not the sin that bothers it's not the center that we hated to the sin

[01:44:35.140 --> 01:44:39.720]
Remember those days. Yeah, we used to be thrown out the orange juice by the gallon every time she'd say that

[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:41.280]
We love the center. We hate the sin

[01:44:41.720 --> 01:44:45.220]
He doesn't approve of acts outside of traditional heterosexual relationships

[01:44:48.420 --> 01:44:52.960]
In the April 7th interview san term describes homosexual acts as a threat to society in the family

[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:57.800]
I have no problem with homosexuality said ever problem homosexual life same old crap same old same old

[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.320]
Democrats waited on the earlier remarks throughout today sent a minority of their time

[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:08.200]
Dashel said the sentiments expressed by san term of out of step with our countries respect for tolerance

[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.660]
One presidential contender tried to draw the white house into controversy the white house speaks the rhetoric of compassionate

[01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:18.360]
Conservatism but there's silent while their chief lieutenants make divisive and hurtful comments that have no place in our politics

[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.640]
said senator john kerry who looks kind of scary from assitutions. How do you like them apples?

[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:25.700]
But like I said same old stuff nothing surprising there

[01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:30.360]
So these guys are a bunch of bigots is anybody surprised no we already knew that

[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.320]
Kielsen good time. Oh yeah

At 3.06.30 the marlin pregame show marlins on dreck from pp park at 630 the brewers in a marlin

If your carpets look like hell to make a long in fact there's a great headline in the paper here this morning

[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.120]
Yeah

[01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.120]
It says

[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:06.000]
Leafs 7th heaven goes straight to hell

[01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.240]
How do you like that?

[01:46:08.840 --> 01:46:11.860]
What a headline that is i don't think you'd see that in the paper there would you look

[01:46:12.520 --> 01:46:16.580]

What an amazing success. We're so proud of the animation in that

[01:47:54.700 --> 01:48:00.580]
That's being finished 7500 7000 how much money we spent on that runny little stuttering pig

[01:48:00.580 --> 01:48:02.360]
I like 80 90 million

93 million dollars on piglet and open seven it's gonna take me nine months to make my freaking money back

[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:14.980]
But but sir the animation is the animation is terrible. I don't know what you're talking about

[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:19.960]
Hold on a minute. Oh yes sir. I got read the stop sign

[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.660]

What the hell you doing but in a drainage system of a drainage system

[01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:43.460]
Yeah, you know a system of all the things when natural drains and ditches you know used to drain off the

[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:46.360]
I know what a drain system is

[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:51.340]
I don't need a drainage system in my office for heaven sake. I don't even have a water

[01:48:52.140 --> 01:48:54.480]
Eisner yes sir. I'll buy the wire. I forgot that

[01:48:54.480 --> 01:49:00.420]
How did the Oscars go? Oh funny you should ask guys. No, that's my next topic was in an amazing time

[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:01.740]
What the hell?

[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.700]
Are you doing?

[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:09.660]
Put me on stage with Jennifer Garner from Elliot? Well, we figured since she's on ABC

[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:15.520]
I know what I figure I do it just for the hell that it be fun. I figure I get a little action afterwards

[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:23.300]
You know what she says to me? I'm married. I can't do that you're my boss. I don't want to go down that's wrong

[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:27.060]
Hang on a minute there's an explosion in my office all right

[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:28.040]
We have

[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.340]
No more

[01:49:30.340 --> 01:49:36.140]
It's like I'm wrecked what the hell you doing to me that's right through wall though

[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:42.400]
I'm stuck blasting through my walls on trying to have a phone conversation with my pups president

[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:45.680]
Get away from me we miss your stink like

[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.280]
Hi there. Yes sir. Hoppa. How are you doing to me? Are you doing to me?

[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:57.580]
Well, sir. How did it go with Jennifer? It did not sir. I got nothing nothing nothing

[01:49:57.580 --> 01:50:03.000]
You wouldn't even give me a handy. Well, so you are married man. Oh, you know what?

[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.780]
You sound like mini on a one home. She's so oh, I'm sorry on stage with Jennifer Garner

[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:11.960]
If you love her so much, why don't you marry her? I said I don't want to marry her mini. I just want to

[01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:15.920]
Bring it back. Come on. What are you doing?

[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:17.740]
You're the crew

[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:23.540]
I'll get your crew out of here. I hear you. Yes, what the hell are you doing? Are you doing to me?

[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:28.420]
Love it's funny. I hope all those good log Republicans. Of course they wouldn't be listening to this show

[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:31.480]
I hope that they're really proud of Senator Rickson to our Republican of Pennsylvania

[01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:38.140]
homophobic and chief out. They're really proud of their support for George W and the right wing and self-hating leanings

[01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:44.740]
I'm talking about all those log cabin Republicans those self-hating fags from coast to coast all those columnists all those internet

[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:50.140]
Mavins like Miss Grudge and all those other people that the prancer around and J Edgar Hoover's old dresses in private

[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.620]
I hope they're real thrilled and excited and squeezing themselves in each other

[01:50:56.180 --> 01:51:01.980]
To see what about your homophobic bigoted and narrow-minded obnoxious born again Bible thumping in the underthols

[01:51:01.980 --> 01:51:03.740]
They're in bed with oh, I shouldn't have said that

[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:09.020]
Here's the fact it says Los Angeles must be the most obnoxious city in the world. I don't agree with that

[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.900]
Has Phil and Dr. Phil are you sure?

[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:19.120]
Tim and Sue Martin and Kiefer Chalton and the Dr. Laura etc etc if you still disagree maybe we can take a meeting

[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:23.640]
It says now we're not taking a meeting. I know of course I haven't been here in a long time. You've been there

[01:51:23.640 --> 01:51:26.140]
Yeah, but nothing's I was yeah, I

[01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:34.100]
Always found to people there to be extremely friendly and it was the really a neat place of course that's a long time ago back when there were still some people there were you know

[01:51:36.820 --> 01:51:41.860]
Who weren't professional anthmics well, it's it's kind of a different place now. I kind of a different place

[01:51:41.860 --> 01:51:45.840]
But I don't agree with that about Los. I wouldn't even put it on the list you think now

[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:48.720]
I would be like putting Las Vegas on list

[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:53.040]
Does make any sense make sense to you? No

[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:56.760]
No, because the people are friendly most of those places and they're friendly because it's good for business

[01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.360]
That's what it's all about there in the service business there and they tourist business

[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:04.740]
As opposed to soft food which is supposed to be in the tourist business was in the business of hate

[01:52:05.260 --> 01:52:06.400]
Hate and hostility

[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.780]
We don't want you here go away. Back go back where you came from

[01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:17.180]
That's that's the message we should put up a big bunch of billboards as you're coming down i95 and i75 depending on where from once you came

[01:52:18.260 --> 01:52:23.240]
And say here's a message from South Florida if you're coming here turn around to go back. We don't want you back

[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:25.920]
however you spelled like that. How do you spell it?

[01:52:26.800 --> 01:52:29.480]
Like it sounds yeah, that's right just like a

[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:35.780]
Here's a fact that says please note that any city in the world with large population of New York is qualified to be on a

[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:40.780]
They would accept New York City as much as I hate to admit it in New York City New York obnoxiousness works

[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:42.740]
Yeah, I understand that that's a good point

[01:52:44.020 --> 01:52:46.760]
Because it's so big and so crowded and you have to be pushing you

[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.420]
I do get the message there

[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:54.460]
But unfortunately when so many of those people come they stick out like a sort of tum in places like South Florida and in Pittsburgh

[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:56.420]
and in Nashville

[01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.460]
Like my landlady in Nashville those two months back in 1980 said to me

[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:04.760]
There's two kinds of people in this world as people from Nashville and then there's people from New York and Florida

[01:53:05.620 --> 01:53:06.900]
Which was code for

[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:07.960]
Jews

[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:11.080]
Anyways, is this being said in all my travels?

[01:53:11.080 --> 01:53:16.560]
No city comes close to Paris for having the most obnoxious native people and I agree they are disgusting man

[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:17.720]
fraud

[01:53:19.100 --> 01:53:19.460]
oh

[01:53:19.460 --> 01:53:23.880]
And even though I did vote for Miami just to go along with you

[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.420]
Uh, Paris would be my second closed choice

[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:30.260]
And in fact, I think about what I spent more time than just two days in Paris. I would probably have to agree

[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:32.700]
But I would never spend more than two days in Paris ever again

[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:41.480]
Not just obnoxious and unfriendly, but slabs and they just throw all their garbage on the streets and I just awful horrible

[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:44.340]
nasty miserable scummy people

[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:47.680]
Even the ones that look good

[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:52.860]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people Miami 114

[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:56.900]
By the way, if mop comes in at room anymore make sure you wear a surgical mask Carlos

[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.460]
Until you heal up from whatever he's giving you too late

[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.860]
You don't let him anywhere anyway, though. Yeah, don't let him in

[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:07.740]
Plus they don't want to give us this straight. They're not they're not in any of uh

[01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:12.580]
Meeting right now. That's that's this bull crap. They're just hiding because we're trying to get the real fancy

[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:17.580]
They're just stonewalling because they don't want us to put on the year to real story about what's gonna happen Saturday with a draft business

[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:21.700]
That Moe keeps insisting he's not gonna show. He's gonna be a no-mo show

[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:26.740]
114 say Miami 100 Paris we got a battle on our hands there

[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.580]
New York 75

[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:32.220]
Boka 61 I think for a town how many people live in Boka

[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:36.140]
But third man

[01:54:37.940 --> 01:54:41.820]
I think for a town as small as Boka having 61 votes is pretty impressive

[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:46.760]
Notice how I matched your pause with my own pregnant pause. Thank you. Appreciate that. Take the heat off

[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:51.440]
Philadelphia 21 DC five uh, Snotzilla is only got a pair now

[01:54:52.160 --> 01:54:54.920]
Detroit's got one Atlanta's got one Grena Kyrgyzga one

[01:54:54.920 --> 01:55:00.900]
Moscow don't have any Vienna Austria don't have one and Oakland, California don't have one yet, but he's right about the radar fans

[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:07.660]
The only thing I only the Iver left in Oakland was that pair underwear denys

[01:55:10.180 --> 01:55:13.480]
Yeah, I had kind of a schmitty experience of the Oakland many many years ago

[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.860]
Well, it was one of those things. You know, and what better place than and then I never tended to say about the afflux in the denys in Orlando

[01:55:19.860 --> 01:55:20.400]
I created

[01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:24.900]
No, I don't think he has the raw flush. I'd remember that. Oh, yeah

[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:29.700]
This was at a denys in Orlando. I can't remember what that was doing there

[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.340]
But I stopped in there and

[01:55:33.340 --> 01:55:36.020]
used the tea room in denys to take a

[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:37.420]
Greg read

[01:55:39.320 --> 01:55:39.720]
and

[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:44.800]
Unfortunately for what I guess the person who had seen I've learned the lesson now when you go to a place

[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:49.080]
There's like toilet paper gym always flush it to clear out what's in the bowl before you sit down

[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:53.940]
Yeah, yeah, you see what I'm saying? Oh, there's an accumulation and it's the plumbing is not that great

[01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:55.080]
You could wind up with a

[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:59.660]
Seapover and in this particular case the word was not a seapover, but a flood

[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:03.640]
So needless to say as I waddled out the door there

[01:56:03.640 --> 01:56:07.240]
I mean I made a run for because you could see the water starting to come out from underneath the door

[01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:09.840]
and I made a

[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.480]
Beeline

[01:56:11.260 --> 01:56:16.200]
For that car and headed for the beeline expressway or whatever it had a good idea and I got out of there

[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:22.360]
And of course I needless to say I never went back there so I have no idea what you know what the deal was but can you even imagine?

[01:56:24.060 --> 01:56:24.820]
In a dental

[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:28.120]
Probably the reaction would have been didn't spell the worst unusual

[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.300]
26 past 11

[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:36.620]
Here on glam grants glam slide lime radio. I didn't even read the facts about you

[01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:38.580]
Would they like somebody likes you? I know one

[01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:44.520]
Yesterday early in the show guy called to take a shot at Georgie city was a quasi intellectual 75 presented

[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.800]
Georgia show a section perversion a nice diversion for some of us

[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.860]
I think what the guy really wanted to say is George makes me mad because he's not a wacko religious Zionist freak like me

[01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:56.520]
He then called again today. Please stop the screenless. GF. Please give up the good work George

We will not stop the screenless. Oh, no. I'm enjoying it and what's his name Carlos? He can't ask you the phone

[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:03.140]
Anyway, he's got that big thing blocking his neck

[01:57:03.500 --> 01:57:07.160]
He can't get the phone close to his face. I don't think you put your phone to your when you got this big or lump

[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:10.840]

But other than that only good things happened. You know this yeah

But are being held as part of what the u.s. calls. It's war on terror

[02:09:16.500 --> 02:09:18.400]
You call that a penis?

[02:09:40.500 --> 02:09:42.300]
Because with no hesitation

[02:09:43.220 --> 02:09:49.540]
They'd love to pick up by the water provocations and the game was a choice

[02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:55.380]
The Bush administration wants to stop what they create

[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.020]
That's a hell of a mistake

[02:09:59.140 --> 02:10:03.580]
Things are really tough dealing with North Korea

[02:10:04.340 --> 02:10:06.920]
A wreck is bad enough

[02:10:06.920 --> 02:10:08.620]
Now we're dealing with North Korea

[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.800]
And save a best bet are to cover the land just stoke up

[02:10:14.800 --> 02:10:19.660]
But we might just regret dealing with North Korea

[02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:22.360]
No dealing with North Korea

[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:27.720]
No dealing with North Korea

[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.380]
No dealing with North Korean

[02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:31.060]
No dealing with North Korea

[02:10:31.060 --> 02:10:33.160]
No dealing with North Korea

[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:34.960]
That's why we didn't do anything

[02:10:35.640 --> 02:10:42.260]
127 and 560 WK 438 votes with in what city would you find the most obnoxious people in the world we ask today on

[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:46.920]
Neoroges.com and this poll today went over like a pregnant pool water at the equator in the middle of August

[02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:54.840]
Wow, Miami huh? Not great they don't like the pool. Miami 129, Paris 116, New York 82,

[02:10:55.380 --> 02:11:00.460]
Bocca 78, Philadelphia 21, DC 5 and everybody else, small potatoes and they are

[02:11:00.460 --> 02:11:04.460]
foaming at the mouth here about the WH declaring that this is a what they call it they were

[02:11:04.460 --> 02:11:07.980]
declaring a travel alert tainted yeah tainted and painted

[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:15.240]
Well, let me uh, they're upset. I think they're really pissed off because

[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:18.200]
Lee's got the crap kicked out of him in Philly last night. That's what they're really upset about.

[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:22.820]
I don't know what the other stuff. The fact of the matter is the hotels here are

[02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:30.440]
empty man. You could probably get a dollar or a holler for a room for like a week. It's

[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:34.500]
like people tend to be just a little bit on the panicky side and like you know tend to be a

[02:11:34.500 --> 02:11:37.980]
little bit nervous just like all the nervous nellies out there all these butch guys you know

[02:11:37.980 --> 02:11:43.660]
oh I sure wouldn't get out of play not after 9-11 remember that yeah of course. I mean

[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:47.560]
what is that all about doesn't bother me and of course now you have to go through a whole

[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:51.800]
but I'll say this when I came up here this last time um-hmm security at Miami International

[02:11:51.800 --> 02:11:55.760]
they just about uh do a cavity search I mean it is really pretty thorough some of the people

[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:02.220]
seem to be enjoying it a lot. I'm telling you where have all the weapons of mass destruction

[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:08.360]
hunters going this from the nation it's on our website today by David Korn. I'm not going

[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:10.880]
to read the whole thing I don't want to do a lot of bit times to restart plus we're getting

[02:12:10.880 --> 02:12:15.900]
such a tremendous response on the phone today. Look at that I say it. Well look it's just

[02:12:15.900 --> 02:12:20.460]
it's just the way it is like I was honest about it we're just biting our time until Friday

[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:23.900]
at 11.30 in the morning the winter book is going to come out I mean there are a lot of

[02:12:23.900 --> 02:12:28.880]
issues are going to drop and then of course as usual a QM probably nothing will happen nothing

[02:12:28.880 --> 02:12:34.420]
it makes sense. David Korn writes the obvious question is where are the weapons of mass destruction

[02:12:34.420 --> 02:12:39.580]
that supposedly prompted the Bush-Chainy Rumsfeld Woolfowitz Quartet to invade Iraq. The

[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.340]
less obvious one is where is the mass of search and secure operation that should be scouring

[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:47.500]
Iraq to locate and control those stocks of chemical and biological weapons and WMD related

[02:12:47.500 --> 02:12:52.240]
materials technology and records. The US military certainly has been looking for chemical

[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.360]
and biological weapons as well as evidence of a nuclear bomb program Iraq was never said

[02:12:56.360 --> 02:13:00.420]
to be in possession of nuclear weapons. But what is surprising if not scandalous is that

[02:13:00.420 --> 02:13:04.400]
two weeks after US troops moved into Baghdad the Bush Pentagon has not yet mounted a full

[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.700]
sweep of Iraq for WMD or even dispatched a sufficient amount of trained troops and specialists

[02:13:08.700 --> 02:13:12.720]
to conduct such a mission. It's as if the Bush administration and the Pentagon had

[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:15.880]
invited listen to their own rhetoric about Iraq's purported weapons of mass destruction

[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:19.780]
while planning the invasion and occupation. Shouldn't the mess of these units have been

[02:13:19.780 --> 02:13:23.140]
scramming across Iraq using all that pre-war intelligence that a lot of administration

[02:13:23.140 --> 02:13:26.420]
officials to declare without pause that Saddam Hussein controlled enough of these dangerous

[02:13:26.420 --> 02:13:30.180]
weapons to be a directorate to the US within days if not hours of the collapse of Hussein's

[02:13:30.180 --> 02:13:34.300]
murderous regime. It reminds me of that emotional speech of Colin Powell and they were all

[02:13:34.300 --> 02:13:38.720]
yawning you'll recall the UN. And he had the diagrams and of course the American that

[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:41.820]
were sort of hyperventilating especially Fox they were like squirting all over the

[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:46.420]
goddamn cameras they were so excited. And he was showing the maps and hearing this location

[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:50.000]
and we know that they've got the Syrian gas hidden here in VX away and they had the

[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:56.420]
locations allegedly all locked it on a map. And everybody else said oh yeah sure those

[02:13:56.420 --> 02:13:59.920]
are like those old diagrams he had of the Chinese embassy and wherever the hell it was.

[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:00.780]
Right. Where the hell was it?

[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.440]
Beijing, most of all. Huh? I don't remember that they've been all sorry it was a mistake.

[02:14:06.180 --> 02:14:08.260]
They must have known something about that. SARS is going to start.

[02:14:10.480 --> 02:14:12.500]
So anyway I'd get you to a doctor right away Carlos.

[02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:16.200]
You know Gregg's popped his head and during that last break. He popped him in.

[02:14:16.320 --> 02:14:19.000]
Yeah. Worrying one of those surgical masks.

[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.640]
You know something in his case excellent idea.

[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:25.900]
If there's anybody who needs not to pollute the rest of the people in the building with his

[02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:27.680]
disease that's the guy right there.

[02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:30.940]
And you're supposed to laugh?

[02:14:31.220 --> 02:14:31.860]
Gregg hates you.

[02:14:31.940 --> 02:14:32.040]
Yeah.

[02:14:32.700 --> 02:14:36.620]
By the way Mr. Macho Greg you're down there hiding okay with a mask on.

[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:40.140]
I'm sitting here in Toronto right in the middle of it supposed to be the SARS capital

[02:14:40.140 --> 02:14:44.820]
of North America. Not worried about it one little bit okay not even a tiny little teeny tiny bit.

[02:14:46.260 --> 02:14:48.940]
I gotta go scrub my hands now but I'm not worried about it.

[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:50.220]
Here's Mayor Mel.

[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:51.460]
So if I can.

[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:52.900]
Now well maybe you can.

[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:53.800]
He's in bad shape.

[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:55.880]
So don't get that hepatitis A.

[02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:01.100]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:03.140]
We got that big big noon to one hour coming up today.

[02:15:03.220 --> 02:15:03.780]
It's gonna be good.

[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:06.200]
I'm gonna like work out some good stuff okay okay.

[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:10.700]
Just like yesterday through in a lot of stuff we haven't played in very very long time.

[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:11.860]
I enjoyed it tremendously.

[02:15:12.980 --> 02:15:13.740]
We got the man.

[02:15:13.940 --> 02:15:14.500]
A hospital.

[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:17.060]
And I'd like to know who was paying all those bills.

[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:20.340]
Okay well we'll find out for you and have a great day.

[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:20.900]
Woo!

[02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.780]
Tell them what time Randy's on and where he is on the dial.

[02:15:25.180 --> 02:15:27.600]
So what was she saying about the Muck being institutionalized now?

[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:28.140]
What did you just say?

[02:15:28.600 --> 02:15:29.540]
I thought that's what you said.

[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:34.260]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:15:34.260 --> 02:15:38.140]
Who I would point out has been instrumental in supporting us all along the way.

[02:15:38.500 --> 02:15:42.880]
But at this point we are developing this plan so that when we get

[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:44.960]
information from Dr. Bessur.

[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:46.680]
Yeah this town's getting dumped on man.

[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.520]
All because of one crappy hockey game you know.

[02:15:49.100 --> 02:15:50.180]
Right up until this moment.

[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:53.720]
Nobody was making a big simous about it.

[02:15:53.840 --> 02:15:55.100]
Even people don't know what that means.

[02:15:55.880 --> 02:15:59.840]
Let's see Scott says I'm in Pinellas Park now and I continue that the Tampa Bay Area has the

[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:00.600]
most obnoxious...

[02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:01.980]
How come Tampa didn't get on there?

[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:02.660]
I don't know.

[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:04.700]
Well let's get down there right away beener boy.

[02:16:04.880 --> 02:16:07.260]
Get in touch with your partner and partner and crime there.

[02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:09.180]
Tell me get Tampa on there like pronto.

[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:14.820]
Wouldn't that be a great theme song for the Moe Show give my peace of chance?

[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:18.920]
Yeah that's our feelings about Tampa.

[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:20.240]
In case you haven't heard it.

[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:25.320]
It says toothless redness with their rust and I'll pick up trucks covered with rebel flag stickers.

[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:29.940]
Jesus fish gun racks and number three stickers they make the old fart...

[02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:33.340]
They make the old fart that's what whatever that means.

[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:35.260]
It says I missed Tamara compared to here.

[02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:37.480]
Scott and it's got he's got a Jewish last name.

[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:42.060]
Scott made the wrong move there Scott you took a wrong turn at the overpass in the underpass.

[02:16:43.700 --> 02:16:45.620]
Beener boy should have pointed in the other direction.

[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:50.960]
Even making a sharp right at the beaches of big improvement over going to Tampa Bay.

[02:16:53.540 --> 02:16:53.980]
WQIM.

[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:54.840]
Hello.

[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:55.760]
Yes sir.

[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:57.100]
Hey Amir how you doing?

[02:16:57.100 --> 02:16:57.660]
Great.

[02:16:58.020 --> 02:17:04.180]
Listen um we've been my friend and I we were waiting for the movie calling for Columbine to come out

[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:04.640]
on video.

[02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:05.280]
Yeah.

[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:07.920]
It was supposed to be released today at blockbuster.

[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:09.620]
August they they've they've postponed it.

[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:12.280]
Yeah and I'm blockbuster ain't going to release it period but it's not going to be too

[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:14.760]
long as that was told because they're going to re-release it in the theaters.

[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:20.820]
I didn't know that because it was on the board for I don't know for a while and um

[02:17:20.820 --> 02:17:22.500]
Well why did it was on the board at blockbuster?

[02:17:22.640 --> 02:17:24.400]
Yeah as that to be released today.

[02:17:24.400 --> 02:17:27.000]
So then we have really no reason to assume that they're going to

[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.020]
with censored because the release was delayed till August because they're going to re-release

[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:31.300]
it in the theaters one more time.

[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:34.240]
Okay well I wasn't um I the first time hearing about it.

[02:17:34.340 --> 02:17:37.600]
So so before we jump on somebody called about this the other day too but before we jump

[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:41.040]
down blockbusters throats which I'm out of fan there's anyway but before we do that let's

[02:17:41.040 --> 02:17:42.100]
wait and see what happens in August.

[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:43.400]
Okay Neil.

[02:17:43.940 --> 02:17:44.280]
Bye bye.

[02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:45.540]
Bye bye bye.

[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:45.800]
Bye bye.

[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:47.080]
You're out.

[02:17:47.480 --> 02:17:47.800]
He's done.

[02:17:48.620 --> 02:17:49.560]
Could you tell he was done?

[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:50.800]
I think he was done.

[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:52.460]
Four minutes till noon.

[02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:53.840]
I sure like to get a copy of that.

[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:55.300]
Can't you at least get me a bootleg copy?

[02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:57.080]
You're always pretty good at getting that illegal stuff.

[02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:57.500]
Oh yeah.

[02:17:57.580 --> 02:18:00.480]
I had a thanks before about how you enjoyed George from it and talking about sex and

[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:00.940]
deviant stuff.

[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:03.000]
Uh I'm glad you'll enjoy it in the past.

[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:05.340]
Don't expect that this summer or any other time soon.

[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:09.840]
I'm just warning them ahead of time that if they're expecting you to come on and talk

[02:18:09.840 --> 02:18:15.340]
about eating, asking as a uh no mo no no mo nothing but politics and religion from that one.

[02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:16.260]
Nothing but very uh

[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:16.360]
uh

[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:23.660]
Just to read the big uh the weekly reader or something like that because you know now

[02:18:23.660 --> 02:18:25.820]
there were under this new way gym up there in Washington man.

[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:29.580]
We can't even take a good crap and much less say crap on a year.

[02:18:29.660 --> 02:18:31.620]
We can maybe one last time okay.

[02:18:31.900 --> 02:18:33.100]
One last time for the best cook.

[02:18:33.280 --> 02:18:33.960]
That's it.

[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:35.140]
Don't do it again.

[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:40.120]
Because they really got their nose to the ear to the speaker.

[02:18:40.440 --> 02:18:43.580]
Just just waiting to see who's naughty and I sure so no more that a** stuff.

[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:46.560]
Uh let Dwight Lutterdale take all of them channel 10.

[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.060]
Can't you see the promos?

[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:51.200]
Dwight Lutterdale gets his licks tonight.

[02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:53.100]
Wreck them on channel 10 news.

[02:18:54.420 --> 02:18:56.140]
Disgusting thought him and ends body.

[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:57.580]
Why do you come up with that?

[02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.080]
Three minutes still known at 560 WQM.

[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:03.780]
Hey I'll tell you what's disgusting a big ugly bald spot and then there are guys running around

[02:19:03.780 --> 02:19:06.260]
with all kinds of dead animals like taped to their head.

[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:09.440]
Which really something when the animal starts like sliding off to one side.

[02:19:09.780 --> 02:19:11.340]
People are just rolling in the aisles.

[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:12.580]
If you don't want people laughing at you,

[02:19:12.920 --> 02:19:14.640]
get yourself a great looking head of hair.

[02:19:14.860 --> 02:19:18.360]
From our good buddy Charles Alfirion the reason it's so good is because he's got the latest

[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:22.260]
technology cause it the natural hairline system and you wouldn't even know guys wearing it

[02:19:22.260 --> 02:19:25.960]
because it looks like real hair like it's going out of your scalp as opposed to a barnyard

[02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:29.160]
animal crown around on your forehead or a bunch of holes were drilled in your head and you've

[02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:32.640]
got like a few follicles or maybe you take a lot of those dangerous pills and probably kill you

[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:33.300]
but give you no hair.

[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.100]
This really does the job for when you got nothing loose but the shiny ugly bald spot because

[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.580]
everybody gets Charlie's 30 day guarantee.

[02:19:39.580 --> 02:19:42.660]

My life is local.

We are sports radio five cities.

[02:20:07.020 --> 02:20:08.760]
You are a-m.

[02:20:10.440 --> 02:20:17.060]
I'm from O'Ele and I'm Russian Lateman and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap

[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:22.200]
made from jewels and listening to the new rocket communist hour.

[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:23.020]
Take I am!

[02:20:25.860 --> 02:20:33.120]
If Jesus walked beat for today and wanted to lose weight like Jared to look good for that special

[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:40.400]
lady on a special date hypothetical to lose a tunic size would be quite a feat.

[02:20:40.620 --> 02:20:41.420]
Even for Jesus.

[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:43.360]
So here's the question.

[02:20:44.040 --> 02:20:45.920]
What would Jesus eat?

[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:49.060]
Swiss cheese.

[02:20:49.660 --> 02:20:50.260]
Cows is holy.

[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:51.380]
Miracle whipped.

[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:52.840]
He'd have no other.

[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.700]
Thomas's English muffins.

[02:20:54.820 --> 02:20:55.400]
Now it is.

[02:20:55.480 --> 02:20:56.320]
Virgin Bloody Mary.

[02:20:56.620 --> 02:20:57.620]
Honor his mother.

[02:21:02.520 --> 02:21:03.480]
Lucky charms.

[02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:08.820]
You guys are supposed to sing to be cured the leprechauns.

[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:12.580]
To be cured the leprechauns.

[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:15.060]
What he did was to be cured leprechauns.

[02:21:15.220 --> 02:21:15.800]
Not leprechauns.

[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:16.600]
Leprechauns.

[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:17.840]
Oh I'm leprechauns.

[02:21:18.020 --> 02:21:19.980]
This is where the mountain is going to be different.

[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:20.840]
Leprechauns.

[02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:21.540]
Okay here.

[02:21:22.680 --> 02:21:23.500]
Angelful cake.

[02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:24.800]
That's better.

[02:21:25.140 --> 02:21:25.860]
Devil's ham.

[02:21:26.500 --> 02:21:27.020]
No way.

[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.460]
Hearts of palm.

[02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:29.560]
Tell us more.

[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:30.860]
On ice cream.

[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:33.100]
Make up like a palm all morning.

[02:21:34.720 --> 02:21:34.880]
Yeah.

[02:21:35.020 --> 02:21:35.260]
Yeah.

[02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:36.420]
Something else.

[02:21:36.720 --> 02:21:36.820]
Yeah.

[02:21:37.300 --> 02:21:37.820]
All right.

[02:21:38.020 --> 02:21:39.160]
I got to see this one.

[02:21:39.460 --> 02:21:39.480]
Jesus.

[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:40.640]
I keep moving.

[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:41.420]
Hi.

[02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:42.860]
Oh, man.

[02:21:43.320 --> 02:21:46.560]
And then because he went to buy his groceries.

[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.080]
He'd redeemed coupons and all the stores employees.

[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:54.000]
And he would cross-strain it.

[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:55.440]
Get all cream and fit.

[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.380]
And one thing that he would not eat.

[02:21:58.640 --> 02:22:00.140]
He would not eat shit.

[02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:01.060]
Shut your mouth.

[02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:03.580]
I was talking about Jesus with me.

[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:08.420]
Uncle Ben's converted rice.

[02:22:08.820 --> 02:22:11.800]
He's the heathen cheese burger in paradise.

[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.060]
Chicken ala king.

[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:14.380]
Hold the ala.

[02:22:14.620 --> 02:22:15.440]
Popeye's chicken.

[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:16.440]
All right.

[02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:16.700]

[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:18.340]
Popeye's chicken.

[02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:19.560]
Do you mean chicken?

[02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:21.460]
Oh, I think you mean Popeye's chicken.

[02:22:21.880 --> 02:22:22.360]
Popeye's chicken.

[02:22:22.620 --> 02:22:23.360]
Oh, Popeye's chicken.

[02:22:23.460 --> 02:22:23.840]
All right.

[02:22:23.840 --> 02:22:25.060]
Did I do that again?

[02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:26.280]
I missed red back.

[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:30.660]
He was a carpenter, but their diet would not do.

[02:22:31.300 --> 02:22:35.160]
Karen Carpenter's dieting proven isn't good for you.

[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:39.740]
He wouldn't eat just to prove he was a real man.

[02:22:40.540 --> 02:22:44.640]
And since he was raised Jewish, he'd have to pass on the heavenly hand.

[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:48.940]
That's for the Jesus' worthy.

[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:52.500]
Yeah.

[02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:54.320]
Yo, I'm a man.

[02:22:55.080 --> 02:22:56.760]
I'm outside of Savannah.

[02:22:57.440 --> 02:23:00.000]
And he's a big and that's no shot.

[02:23:00.620 --> 02:23:00.620]

[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:03.820]
Freshly reporters.

[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.120]
This is the Bay orders.

[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.720]
Everybody hates John.

[02:23:08.960 --> 02:23:09.660]
Roger.

[02:23:10.940 --> 02:23:13.240]
Hey, now he's a red chick.

[02:23:13.520 --> 02:23:14.280]
He's a brain chick.

[02:23:14.640 --> 02:23:15.520]
Say, go.

[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:17.780]
Hey, now he's a big mouth.

[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:19.160]
Limbing out sound.

[02:23:19.340 --> 02:23:20.120]
And go.

[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:20.960]
Twist.

[02:23:21.300 --> 02:23:21.820]
Ships.

[02:23:21.920 --> 02:23:22.340]
Vision.

[02:23:22.620 --> 02:23:23.080]
He's pretty.

[02:23:24.140 --> 02:23:27.060]
He should be counted in by many.

[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:28.260]
He's pretty.

[02:23:29.660 --> 02:23:31.520]
I think Rocker's mental.

[02:23:32.240 --> 02:23:33.820]
His brain is a rental.

[02:23:34.340 --> 02:23:37.420]
Maybe he took it from Manson.

[02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:40.840]
He should keep his trash shots.

[02:23:41.200 --> 02:23:43.100]
Or he may get his throat cut.

[02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:46.700]
He'll be around as long as Hanson.

[02:23:48.020 --> 02:23:50.120]
Hey, now he's a red chick.

[02:23:50.380 --> 02:23:51.200]
We can bring him.

[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:52.360]
Say, go.

[02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:54.660]
Hey, now he's a big mouth.

[02:23:54.940 --> 02:23:56.060]
Limbing out sound.

[02:23:56.220 --> 02:23:56.980]
And go.

[02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:57.720]
Twist.

[02:23:58.200 --> 02:23:58.720]
Ships.

[02:23:59.060 --> 02:23:59.240]
Vision.

[02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:00.240]
He's pretty.

[02:24:01.020 --> 02:24:03.920]
He should be counted in by many.

[02:24:06.020 --> 02:24:07.980]
It's supposed to outrage his video ever

[02:24:07.980 --> 02:24:09.960]
because it features real girls.

[02:24:10.240 --> 02:24:11.640]

God is going to cry, filled with sorrow

[02:32:01.220 --> 02:32:03.960]
I can't live for all this world

[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:09.380]

Come on, let's go for the next

[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:31.300]
Remember how it used to be a warm summer evening

[02:35:31.300 --> 02:35:34.520]
Dad outside of the grill, mom inside of the stove

[02:35:35.300 --> 02:35:39.840]
And throughout the house the unmistakable aroma of the M baked beans

[02:35:41.300 --> 02:35:45.300]
The M baked beans slow simmered with molasses and pork

[02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:50.180]
And our patented brick ovens for that thick rich meaty taste

[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:55.700]
Hmm, the M baked beans have you had your B M today?

[02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:57.700]
Mortgatory

[02:35:59.320 --> 02:35:59.320]

[02:35:59.320 --> 02:36:22.440]
With the old dry I Pr like not having a lie

[02:36:22.440 --> 02:36:25.680]
Thinking I should have been getting it

[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:25.680]

[02:36:25.680 --> 02:36:33.220]
Leave Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, that's not allowed to leave the brilliance, take the tunnel

[02:36:33.220 --> 02:36:39.540]
And go look back and down the Jews it turns like the Tamil, the rest roll the malls

[02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:45.140]
And the sidewalks hail from your hair, as you wrap your nails, go your friends

[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:49.460]
You're going to gloomy and there's anyone fit far behind

[02:36:55.680 --> 02:36:57.420]
I'm going to go back and down the streets, I'm going to go back to the town

[02:36:57.420 --> 02:37:11.760]
I'm going to go back to the town, I'm going to go back to the town

[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:13.180]
There's someone with you up here

[02:37:13.180 --> 02:37:21.140]
Leave Manhattan, the Bronx and Queens, that's not allowed to leave the brilliance, take the tunnel

[02:37:21.140 --> 02:37:27.360]
And go look back and down the Jews it turns like the Tamil, the rest roll the malls

[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:32.900]
And the sidewalks hail from your hair, as you wrap your nails, go your friends

[02:37:32.900 --> 02:37:37.520]
You're going to gloomy and there's anyone fit far behind

[02:37:37.520 --> 02:37:45.220]
Get down south, pass back and sack, there's a town, call Tamil, act with it

[02:37:45.220 --> 02:37:49.560]
On the coldest sack and to that you're about to go to the next door

[02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:56.500]
We're down south, pass back and sack, there's a town, call Tamil, act with it

[02:37:57.140 --> 02:38:02.460]
Pass back and sack, there's a town, call Tamil, act with it

[02:38:03.180 --> 02:38:07.500]
Pass back and sack, there's a town, call Tamil

[02:38:07.500 --> 02:38:13.240]
Well I've never got a vine, the gun no ride, that I've been through the round these days

[02:38:13.240 --> 02:38:18.920]
Now as the glass and feather wheels fixed up, the way a brother would lie again

[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:25.360]
Now as they peed and chanted, and the trim is cold, and it dies off the bus seat

[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:29.620]
I got the candle liquid cherry, yo, y'all baby

[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.240]
Open a crud on a cherry cherry, and pee baby, peep, y'all baby

[02:38:37.180 --> 02:38:41.420]
Shiny little little little smelly machine, to fussy's big chin

[02:38:41.420 --> 02:38:45.920]
Now so I bounced down the road, and I think that is super bad way

[02:38:45.920 --> 02:38:51.720]
Now with the hodest drop, don't think deals a day of it around the piece of the praise

[02:38:52.780 --> 02:39:00.280]
I got you 79, my own phone, Carolina, show looking fine now, use my baby candle, that's...

[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:08.860]
Now baby, open a crud on a cherry cherry, and pee baby, peep, y'all baby

[02:39:08.860 --> 02:39:13.300]
Shiny little little little smelly machine, yo

[02:39:38.780 --> 02:39:44.640]
I got my windows down, on the hot summer day, cause they're busy don't work no way

[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.400]
The sweaty pressure loss eats, thoughts the smell, and gets the dusty look in a little bit time

[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:56.820]
How about back to you find the shiny granite smell like glass, thanks my coffee, and Johnny,

[02:39:56.820 --> 02:39:59.240]
I do this how they washing it with all the roads

[02:39:59.240 --> 02:40:07.960]
I don't know baby, open a crud on a cherry cherry, and pee baby, peep, y'all baby

[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:12.560]
I'm a shop at news, going over street folks, and to school

[02:40:13.500 --> 02:40:21.100]
Don't know baby, fresh with Lauren, Terry, you'll be better to pee baby, peep, y'all baby

[02:40:23.940 --> 02:40:28.640]
C'mon 25, 5, 6, you know what you're doing, it's a great Wednesday man, you can almost smell it, can't you?

[02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:30.580]
All the way here I can smell it, but that what it is

[02:40:30.580 --> 02:40:38.260]
In what city will you find the most obnoxious people, that's our poll question today, we're looking for obnoxious people in the last several days we found a whole bunch of them

[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:46.120]
Miami 155, Paris 132, New York 96, Bokka 91, we got a New York, Bokka is right on New York's ass

[02:40:47.540 --> 02:40:53.740]
Phil Phanofia 22, DC, small potatoes after that, so it's a four-way race, and Bokka is right on New York's ass

[02:40:53.740 --> 02:40:55.660]
Of course, where do you think most of the people in Bokka came from?

[02:40:56.020 --> 02:41:04.040]
Taiyi, uh huh, hey how many times did you hear about an opportunity, and you just sat there like you were in suspended animation and didn't move and do the right thing, and then passed you by

[02:41:04.040 --> 02:41:11.920]
Don't let life pass you by, interest rates have gone down, even lower than they were before, financial group was offering you, and amazing interest rate of 3.45%

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:19.900]
Then they lowered it even better to 2.95% now rates have gone down even lower just 2.45% financing with financial group

[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:26.080]
Let me say it again 2.45% so call financial group and find out about it at 1-800-940-Lend

[02:41:26.080 --> 02:41:31.520]
How long will these low interest rates last? Probably not very long, it's a wonderful opportunity which we invite you to hop through

[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:37.940]
With financial group get you an incredible low rate of just 2.45% and save yourself a Schmidt load of cash, thousands of dollars

[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:44.340]
Call financial group 1-800-940-Lend, and you're probably wondering, you're scratching that bald spot on your head like Greg does all the time

[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:48.400]
Level 2.45% financing due to my monthly payments. Well, here's some examples

[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:56.120]
If you have a $200,000 loan, you pay only $70,000, $70,000, $70,000, $70,000, $70,000, $393, so do it now

[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:00.920]
Get the information by calling financial group toll free 1-800-940-Lend

[02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:07.680]
1-800-940-L-E-N-D, they're an equal housing lender, credit restrictions apply and rates are subject to change without notice

[02:42:07.680 --> 02:42:09.840]
So do it now 5.34 APR

[02:42:47.700 --> 02:42:59.640]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:42:59.640 --> 02:42:59.640]

[02:42:59.640 --> 02:42:59.640]

[02:42:59.640 --> 02:42:59.640]

[02:42:59.640 --> 02:42:59.660]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:42:59.660 --> 02:43:00.320]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:00.320 --> 02:43:01.120]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:01.120]

[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:01.120]

[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:02.740]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:02.740 --> 02:43:03.480]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:04.180]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:04.180 --> 02:43:05.380]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:05.380 --> 02:43:07.620]
I'm going to have a look at the

[02:43:07.620 --> 02:43:09.640]
You bunch of cool crazy 90

[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:11.620]
Bunch of cool, are you people stupid?

[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:13.240]
Yeah

[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:15.320]
You bunch of mooks

[02:43:15.320 --> 02:43:16.720]
Yeah, bunch of mooks

[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:19.460]
At this rate, someone's got the

[02:43:19.460 --> 02:43:21.480]
Doodle right thing

[02:43:22.600 --> 02:43:24.700]
I will be counted

[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:26.280]
Till spring

[02:43:28.800 --> 02:43:31.140]
So what's the difference

[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:34.220]
With the final score

[02:43:35.220 --> 02:43:37.720]
Just give it to George Bush

[02:43:37.720 --> 02:43:40.480]
Or give it to Gore

[02:43:41.640 --> 02:43:43.140]
What a new

[02:43:43.140 --> 02:43:44.400]
Not go ahead

[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:46.220]
You do the right thing

[02:43:47.160 --> 02:43:48.160]
God's the best

[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:50.020]
Or we'll be counted

[02:43:50.020 --> 02:43:52.280]
Till spring

[02:43:53.140 --> 02:43:54.760]
Because either way

[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:56.300]
They

[02:43:56.300 --> 02:43:59.800]
No, it was a time

[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:02.220]
So I wonder why

[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:04.200]
Please don't be brave

[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:05.060]
In this thing

[02:44:05.060 --> 02:44:06.660]
Pick a king

[02:44:06.660 --> 02:44:09.340]
Hand counting ballots

[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:11.960]
Is always vacuously

[02:44:13.280 --> 02:44:15.900]
And we'll be at it

[02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:17.060]
Till spring

[02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:22.660]
Both guys and groupers

[02:44:22.660 --> 02:44:24.720]
They're petty and small

[02:44:24.720 --> 02:44:26.040]
They don't have much on them

[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:28.160]
Neither could run

[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:31.020]
A store and a mall

[02:44:31.020 --> 02:44:32.520]
Even a group in there is a

[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:34.540]
It makes no difference

[02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:37.400]
Which mark wins this thing

[02:44:38.520 --> 02:44:40.680]
Let's wrap up the counting

[02:44:40.680 --> 02:44:42.180]
By spring

[02:44:44.800 --> 02:44:46.360]
Let's give it to

[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:46.960]
Nader

[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:49.980]
Or Pat Buchanan

[02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:53.680]
Or maybe Perot

[02:44:54.520 --> 02:44:56.760]
Will cost his head back in

[02:44:56.760 --> 02:44:59.340]
How about Ali

[02:44:59.340 --> 02:45:01.900]
Make me a law her best friend

[02:45:01.900 --> 02:45:02.420]
Link

[02:45:03.460 --> 02:45:05.520]
As long as we don't

[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:07.640]
Have the count till spring

[02:45:14.660 --> 02:45:16.760]
Will I fall the farm is kind of

[02:45:16.760 --> 02:45:18.540]
Bad, I haven't had punses

[02:45:18.540 --> 02:45:19.520]
Or help a handshake

[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:21.720]
He knows the count and I was a chick

[02:45:21.720 --> 02:45:24.100]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:45:24.100 --> 02:45:26.880]
Well I love it in the summer when it's time to do the hey

[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:29.240]
We hire all these guys that's when I start to play

[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:31.540]
Shirts off sunshine, sweatin' in the wagon

[02:45:31.540 --> 02:45:33.780]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:45:33.780 --> 02:45:34.260]

Well I got a miss, she's been a keeping kind of busy

[02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:38.920]
I want to go hard so much time to get busy

[02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:41.060]
Fire nights out, I think it's time to party

[02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:43.520]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:46.300]
Will this bench six years since the last got caught

[02:45:46.300 --> 02:45:48.520]
I told the farm owner therapy was over known

[02:45:48.520 --> 02:45:51.220]
Can't find a man while I'm tryin' to be old

[02:45:51.220 --> 02:45:53.180]
Oh God I'm a country game boy

[02:45:53.180 --> 02:45:55.920]
Well I hired this guy about two weeks ago

[02:45:55.920 --> 02:45:57.920]
He told me he was great but I better never know

[02:45:58.500 --> 02:46:00.840]
I hear fake moves I had to let him make up

[02:46:00.840 --> 02:46:02.820]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:46:02.820 --> 02:46:05.660]
Well I got me a great lover like the simpwittle

[02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:07.900]
Grab a little less and make a donkey middle

[02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:10.060]
Lies spend greats just a month till the country

[02:46:10.060 --> 02:46:12.520]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:12.900]

Oh yeah

[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:22.280]
Oh yeah

[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:25.140]
Can I love my chickens and I love my piggies

[02:46:25.140 --> 02:46:25.900]
I try to find them

[02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:27.340]
If they have little dinkies

[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:29.480]
Vegetarian but I love to win me

[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:31.960]
Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:46:31.960 --> 02:46:34.780]
We're the piano-porn of job and a queen for balls

[02:46:34.780 --> 02:46:37.020]
You lose yourself hot but I call you a horse

[02:46:37.020 --> 02:46:39.160]
Just remember all employees use a back door

[02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:41.420]
Oops

[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:43.560]

[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.660]
Come on

[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:47.540]
I got me a fine line of gullaskin fiddle

[02:46:47.540 --> 02:46:49.740]
Play you what you make your swivel just a little

[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:52.040]
Can't get fine line pissing down your t-shirt

[02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:52.800]
Oh

Thank God I'm a country game boy

[02:46:57.440 --> 02:46:58.800]
What would you do without me?

[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:01.400]
Honestly I want you to be honest

[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:02.700]
You'll make me perfectly honest

[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:03.800]
What did you think?

[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:05.340]
I'm good

[02:47:06.800 --> 02:47:08.060]
You like that didn't you?

[02:47:08.540 --> 02:47:10.120]
How about you thought I was hot and a little hot?

[02:47:10.540 --> 02:47:11.780]
How much do I get?

[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:14.040]
I want to check you like that

[02:47:14.040 --> 02:47:16.020]
How much can you get hot yet?

[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:18.500]
Oh you love it

[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.780]
I love to know the town

[02:47:19.780 --> 02:47:20.720]
How

[02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:29.780]
Oh

[02:47:29.780 --> 02:47:30.080]
Oh

[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:33.940]
They changed the name too

[02:47:33.940 --> 02:47:34.900]
Alien heart

[02:47:34.900 --> 02:47:36.600]
Explosions are now

[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:41.240]
That's where the bucks are

[02:47:41.240 --> 02:47:43.480]
Get your pants out on leather away

[02:47:43.480 --> 02:47:46.220]
Until you see the human game

[02:47:46.220 --> 02:47:47.660]
And I am water or ride

[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:49.960]
Where you grab a Jew or a raft

[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:52.820]
Like take the broken up

[02:47:52.820 --> 02:47:54.360]
To a democracy

[02:47:55.120 --> 02:47:55.760]
Down

[02:47:55.760 --> 02:47:57.740]
Back south of you

[02:47:57.740 --> 02:47:58.620]
We'll down

[02:47:59.660 --> 02:48:01.600]
Underwater and drown and back around

[02:48:01.600 --> 02:48:03.900]
To let the rough feel down

[02:48:03.900 --> 02:48:06.200]
If the biggest parking river is seen

[02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:07.720]
That people nature

[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.960]
All the toilets are clean

[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:10.220]
They'll start as autograph

[02:48:10.220 --> 02:48:12.660]
Like a big shot media star

[02:48:12.660 --> 02:48:15.040]
And then a parkier car

[02:48:15.040 --> 02:48:17.680]
It's all about how important you feel

[02:48:17.680 --> 02:48:19.340]
And the rest of the hundred things

[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:21.800]
It's no big deal for a couch and trip fun

[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:24.120]
Go down the alien part

[02:48:31.700 --> 02:48:32.340]
Music

[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:32.340]

[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:32.340]

[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:32.340]

[02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:32.580]
Music

[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:45.680]
They're dying the air from the road coasts

[02:48:45.680 --> 02:48:47.880]
And rocking music by

[02:48:47.880 --> 02:48:50.120]
Lost bandland

[02:48:50.120 --> 02:48:52.400]
And being their demands

[02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.700]
Unsure cosy clouds

[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:57.280]
At least the road is when they probably play

[02:48:57.280 --> 02:48:58.400]
And back to you and say

[02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:00.100]
My only one in this new day

[02:49:00.100 --> 02:49:01.620]
That's for me toilet that sucks

[02:49:01.620 --> 02:49:03.820]
They now call Alien heart

[02:49:05.060 --> 02:49:06.180]
Alien Alien

[02:49:06.180 --> 02:49:06.700]
Heart

[02:49:07.500 --> 02:49:08.680]
Alien Alien

[02:49:08.680 --> 02:49:09.520]
Heart

[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:14.120]
Alien Alien

[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:20.100]

[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:24.720]
Heart

[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:24.720]

[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:24.720]

[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:24.720]

[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:25.260]
Heart

[02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:27.500]
Alien

[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:32.040]
Heart

[02:49:35.980 --> 02:49:38.960]
Just a reminder for our radio listeners

[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:43.260]
That the end of the world is going to come next Tuesday at 4.30pm

[02:49:43.260 --> 02:49:48.600]
And the department of health has requested homeowners to unplug all electrical appliances

[02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:50.020]
Turn off radios

[02:49:50.020 --> 02:49:53.300]
And TV sets and disconnect gas stoves and furnaces

[02:49:53.300 --> 02:49:56.760]
The post office recommends that you mail early in the day

[02:49:56.760 --> 02:50:01.360]
And for those with automobiles alternate side of the street parking will be suspended

[02:50:02.020 --> 02:50:05.500]
That's the end of the world next Tuesday at 4.30pm

[02:50:06.020 --> 02:50:06.660]
Mark it down

[02:50:06.660 --> 02:50:07.280]
Got it

[02:50:08.040 --> 02:50:11.460]
22 to 1 at 5.60 WM the mad dog

[02:50:11.460 --> 02:50:14.340]
The hostile hound will be long on one hank at 3

[02:50:14.340 --> 02:50:17.900]
And then we got Marlins on direct 630 Marlins in the brewers at P.P. Park

[02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:18.560]
And Alien Park

Aggressive conduct, all of them that they need to war

[02:53:23.600 --> 02:53:26.080]
Raining in the sad stick brown moon

[02:53:26.080 --> 02:53:28.200]

[02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:30.720]

Everything is fine, hung my balls

Who's that group of Muslims?

[02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:01.940]
Helping terrorists

[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:07.700]
Give a bunch of backwards thinking fundamentalists

[02:54:07.700 --> 02:54:09.160]
