[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:11.460]
If you come and apply for the job of the sports sales representative on WQAM, you too can enjoy fabulous in-depth meetings every Monday morning.

[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.700]
When Luanne the sales manager like, throw stuff at you because you're not up to your quota.

[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.020]
Because food at people, I saw it do that.

[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.540]
He did.

[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.760]
Who should throw it at? Can I get a name?

[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.820]
We'll do that tomorrow morning.

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.460]
We'll go in depth because in depth tomorrow, you can apply and we will name names.

[00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.800]
You will throw people under the bus.

[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.200]
And then I hear anymore. That's why we need a new sales person.

[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.820]
This is true too.

[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.640]
Great for an exact middle-grade job. Goldie, you folks.

[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.800]
Josh Beckett.

[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.200]
Thank you to you too.

[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.640]
Have a nice day in paradise everybody on QAM.

[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.400]
Last but not least, this is South Florida's only real sports event.

[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.680]
Y'all need QAM. You might have eaten 400 days.

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.560]
A piece of your forecast for the first time.

[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.540]
www.qam.com

[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.940]
Thanks to Maul and Kelly for the food and coffee, which is really for us anyway.

[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.840]
And the Mockington Tank one.

[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.260]
Very good.

[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.040]
Very good.

[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.060]
Very good.

[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.060]
I like dick a lot.

[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.260]
She gained a claim with her breakout performance in the People Vs. Larry Flint.

[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.780]
Now Courtney Loeb takes the theater by storm,

[00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.880]
appearing in the classics at the Seattle Reptory Playhouse.

[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.840]
See her riveting performance as Lady McPath in the Scottish play.

[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.720]
Is this a mother f***ing jagger I see before me?

[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.960]
As blanched to boi in a street car named Desire.

[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.260]
I've always relied on the kindness of strangers.

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.660]
F***ing jagger!

[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.800]
And of course St. Joan by George Bernard Shaw.

[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.340]
Get that torch away from me, mother f***ing f***ing s***ing bastards!

[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.660]
Yes. Courtney Loeb plays the classics.

[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.960]
This spring at the Seattle Reptory Playhouse.

[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.040]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, get out of my f***ing face.

[00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.360]
Order your tickets today.

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.640]
It's none of a f***ing mother f***ing.

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.440]
Hey, she can't help it. She's got a party mouth.

[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.440]
Okay, that's what she said.

[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.780]
That's what she blamed for her rest of it.

[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460]
She's got a party mouth and she can't help it.

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.220]
If you're noticing right off the bat that we're not doing the noon to one hour

[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.400]
and then I'd attend our Ashmit Candid idea.

[00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.180]
Bad idea.

[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.060]
Fords liked it, nobody liked it.

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.560]
I don't care.

[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.780]
You got your free food show up.

[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.400]
Thanks, Howard, we didn't get the first get.

[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.680]
Thanks, Mo and Geltie for the free food from Corkeys,

[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.380]
even though it was for us.

[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.560]
See, evidently, what happened?

[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.420]
Is somebody heard me begging and then you chiming in and begging and begging and pleading

[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.140]
almost even worse than Rimmer for free food?

[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.900]
Well, tight as the Rimmer's, they're in a little bit, by the way, about pizza lot, but anyway.

[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.900]
And they told them that it was for the guys on a morning show.

[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.260]
So they sent a note with the food for Howard, David and Steve Goldstein from our friend of your friends at Corkeys.

[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.420]
What it wasn't for them at all.

[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.560]
They didn't even know what that was all about.

[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.420]
Now, Geltie was nice enough to come in here and say,

[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.200]
Oh, yeah, thanks a lot.

[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.720]
Whatever he said.

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.260]
You know, I saw Mo in a hallway and he didn't say anything about the food.

[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.000]
Didn't thank me.

[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.140]
Didn't the, huh?

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.620]
Didn't bond.

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.080]
Didn't ask how else feeling.

[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.360]
In fact, I think it was a plot.

[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.520]
You know, it was because there wasn't any brisket.

[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.460]
It was potato pancakes.

[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.620]
It was potato loquas and French toast chunks,

[00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.180]
which I've never seen that before in my life.

[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.940]
And man, that was good.

[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.080]
Yeah, they were.

[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.380]
How do you describe that?

[00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.340]
They're like chunks of syrup or anything.

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.320]
No, because they're already sweet.

[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.920]
It's like you're like bread and sugar.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.940]
You hear carbohydrate, which I'm like nearly.

[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.380]
Oh, man.

[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.960]
Sprinkle it lightly with powdered sugar.

[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.380]
Oh.

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.620]
So, and I came in this morning, my blood sugar was great.

[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.840]
This is going to be the new deal.

[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.940]
And we'll die in a 10 hour.

[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.960]
We'll be what ailment does.

[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.700]
And you'll have this morning.

[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.220]
That's going to be it.

[00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.940]
Yes, that it was those stogies.

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.620]
Man, those things are killers.

[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.780]
Those little churris stogies.

[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.520]
No more of those.

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.800]
Derek, okay.

[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]
No more of that crap.

[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.720]
Don't we had our first call in the evening?

[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.220]
How about the Q&A?

[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.220]
Not this big canale.

[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.000]
I beg your pardon?

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.600]
Let this speak to me, oh.

[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.240]
Where are you calling from?

[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.880]
95.

[00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.860]
Okay, let's go to a call at 995.

[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.280]
Hello.

[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.600]
Nail?

[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:42.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.780]
Yes?

[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.960]
Is this nail?

[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.820]
Yes, it is.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.820]
Nail, pickler.

[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.720]
Corner of a commercial and power line.

[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.000]
Pick it.

[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.460]
Pick it.

[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.500]

[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.640]
You know, it's a bite in your nail.

[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.400]
That is the bigger thing.

[00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.220]
Okay, thanks for the alert.

[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.200]
You're welcome.

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.600]
Okay.

[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.080]
Too very slowly, by the way.

[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.660]
I got a better story on that thing in San Francisco about the Amerawanna trial.

[00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.120]
I got a better story than the one I had.

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.060]
Thank you, whoever facts that, we'll get to it.

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.560]
Now, that whole business about the 9 to 10 hour.

[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.300]
We're just, we can't capitulate to that.

[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.880]
We're just going to have to do our four hour show.

[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.580]
We can't like start and stop.

[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.520]
It just doesn't work.

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.940]
That was a bad idea, George.

[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.380]
Now, actually, it was Carlos' idea.

[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.180]
Wasn't it?

[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.880]
Yeah.

[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.760]
Idiot.

[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.360]
His, you know, just because you've been here for a couple of months and got a couple of paychecks.

[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.740]
Don't start playing program director.

[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.600]
We got enough program director's already more than we can count.

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.060]
So don't start playing book boss.

[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.240]
Oh, yeah, I think you guys ought to like, oh, yeah.

[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.140]
But out.

[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.860]
Here's the poll result from yesterday.

[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.260]
See, if they want to hear the show, they got a 2-0-9.

[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.940]
If they have other things, if they're dawdling in other places, they'll break to them.

[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.260]
Okay?

[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.520]
When they get here, they'll get here.

[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.040]
Start coming into the movie in the middle of the movie.

[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.660]
What's the point?

[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.120]
Huh?

[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.260]
Like turning out small veil last night in the middle of the show.

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.080]
Yeah, who I'm sorry.

[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.080]
Idiot.

[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.620]
George missed half a small veil last night.

[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.140]
He's out.

[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.420]
You're out.

[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.640]
It was a good show.

[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.120]
That was the best small veil ever, I think.

[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.760]
Bad Clark is always good.

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.140]
Bad Clark is always good.

[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.980]
He had the red socket rocket in his pocket or something like that.

[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.980]
And boy, he just was going ape shm in.

[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.980]
And all of a sudden, damn it.

[00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.660]
That thing fell out.

[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.760]
Just about when she was about to unbuckle his pants, too.

[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.460]
Chloe.

[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.520]
Wouldn't you know it?

[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.900]
Yeah.

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.040]
Wouldn't you know it, Chloe?

[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.940]
Bitch.

[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.300]
And luckily, you know, she lost all her memory.

[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.680]
Of course, Lana, she lost her memory at birth because she didn't have any.

[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.940]
No.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.960]
She's got like little raisinets in spite of what you say.

[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.920]
I still say Chloe's high-residence had big hoily.

[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.780]
But who really gives a crap?

[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.720]
What?

[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.920]
She had big boobs, Lana.

[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.180]
You said she had some.

[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.820]
I think that Lex Luth is got bigger knots on his forehead than she's got on her chest.

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.180]
But anyway, we'll have a couple of seconds.

[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.240]
And I don't have my poster from the Sunsendle.

[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.900]
I must have thrown it out with a brand's mart section.

[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.360]
Damn it.

[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.720]
Huh?

[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.220]
Well, they showed last night what it looked like and everybody had all their clothes on.

[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.080]
So who the hell needs that?

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.560]
We're not interested in if the people got all their clothes on.

[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.940]
We asked yesterday, which of these people are you most convinced is gay or gay?

[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:57.540]
Or bisexual?

[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.360]
The usual stellar response, 1282 votes.

[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.400]
Now, guess who didn't get any?

[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.360]
This may come as a tremendous shock to you.

[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.980]
All right.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.220]
Jeff Goldblum.

[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.240]
Yeah, I don't get that either.

[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.680]
I don't think they know who that is.

[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:13.520]
He was in the fly.

[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:14.400]
Remember the fly?

[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.980]
Of course not.

[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.040]
He was knowing that I never thought he was gay.

[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.940]
He is very annoying and very like Joey looking.

[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.440]
You know what I mean?

[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.340]
Well, Shepherd Smith from MSNBC, Schlepper Smith.

[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.060]
He didn't get any.

[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:29.120]
And I don't think necessarily that I ever thought that he was gay just strange.

[00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.160]
He's an alien.

[00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.980]
Like what's his name?

[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.760]
The dark kid was saying on the small of the last night screaming at Clark.

[00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.820]
He's an alien.

[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.360]
He's an alien.

[00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.400]
He was screaming that.

[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.660]
Yeah.

[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:38.600]
He's out of the world.

[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.420]
Shepherd Smith who's an alien on MSNBC, he didn't get any.

[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.800]
And Daniel Gay Lewis didn't get any.

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.260]
Now, going back up on top.

[00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:47.500]
Guess who won, Carlos.

[00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.940]
Guess who won by a landslide.

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.540]
Who these people out there think are most convinced is gay or bi?

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.920]
Foray.

[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:56.500]
I'll give you 5,000 guesses.

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.320]
Who it is?

[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.820]
Hello, George.

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.340]
George Rodriguez, 220 votes.

[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.180]
Let's hear it for George.

[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.740]
Oh!

[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.440]
But you still look at it.

[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.460]
You got a good company though.

[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.100]
I know.

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.080]
Dennis, the chronic caller, slash Catholic champion, chronic Dennis.

[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.040]
They think you're a gay, Doug Dennis.

[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:12.300]
He has a white ass.

[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.760]
He doesn't have to hold him many, many times.

[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.100]
Nobody, that hysterical, that homophobic.

[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.540]
Of course it's kind of that Catholic church priest that cover up thing, you know?

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:22.280]
Now I think he though, a level unto himself with that.

[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:22.760]
Is he?

[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.540]
118 votes for Dennis the chronic.

[00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.140]
Tom Cruise 105, who's holding another press conference in about five minutes to tell you that he's not gay.

[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.420]
See, I hate to break the news to all you entertainers out there, but when you hold press conferences,

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.340]
and when you file lawsuits, by the way, nice going Leon and Helmslake.

[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.080]
11 million.

[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.580]
For that queen.

Prince had 90.

[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.620]
Ricky Martin, who was the late addition, and I have no idea why it was Carlos's fault.

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:47.660]
He had 57.

[00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.900]

[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.220]
She was a red on Troi's ass.

[00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.540]
And Jeff Garcia, who's also a little bit of late addition, Jeff Garcia.

[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.460]
He is just strange.

[00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.380]
49.

[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.640]

You don't think she's a dyke, do you?

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.260]
Did I say Jeff Gordon 28?

[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.480]
Mike Piazza 28, Mayor Alex Penga Picania 25.

[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.300]
Nice going, Alex.

Justin from American Idol.

[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:27.000]
What's his name, Justin?

[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.560]
Grimes.

[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.920]
Justin, grimey Justin.

[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:31.680]
I don't know what it is.

[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.200]
We don't care.

[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.620]
He's rude.

[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:33.580]
Also bizarre.

[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.440]
Oh, I guess it was going to be out of smallville next week.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.580]
I give up.

[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.160]
I don't know what his name.

[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.260]
Kid used to play in guiding light.

[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.340]
Oh, oh.

[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:43.660]
I have no idea.

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.380]
What was that important?

[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:46.540]
Brian Andrews.

[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.140]
Little Brian Andrews had 20 votes over their channel seven news.

[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:51.180]

Justin Tinkerbell had 16.

[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.920]
Matt Damon 16.

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.740]
Oh, Matt Damon should be a lot higher than that.

[00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.540]
I'm convinced now.

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.720]
He's another A.

[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.480]
He's in a new movie.

[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.260]
Why is it that every movie he was in, he plays some fag.

[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:03.820]
Why is that?

[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.640]
Coincidence.

[00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:05.060]
Okay.

[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.020]
That's bad.

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.140]
I'm going to complain to Dolphin Management about that.

[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.780]
That Ricky Williams is a better butcher up a little bit.

[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.700]
Just because he ran for 2000 yards down here.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.100]

Paul Schaefer from David Letterman, even though he's got a wife and 14 kids we don't care.

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:29.500]
We still believe it 12.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.200]
You do.

[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.440]

And Greek A. Glacias had 10.

[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:33.800]

He's holding press conference right after Tom gets through.

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.240]
In fact, what they're going to do now is they're going to press conferences with guys lined up.

[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.880]
I'm not gay and I'm not either me.

[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.720]
Nope, not me.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:51.940]
I'm going to say a lot of time.

[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.900]
Leo DeCamprio had only seven.

[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:55.260]
JLo's seven votes.

[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.580]
They think she's a dike.

[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.240]
Wait till you hear who got six.

[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.520]

[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.720]
You know, the dead giveaway was going to come on here last weekend.

[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.760]
It's a me Kimba.

[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.740]
I think that was the giveaway.

Oh, yeah.

[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:10.960]
Don't you think?

[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:11.620]
No.

[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.540]
Don't do that again, Kim.

[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.480]
Always a big guy.

[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.460]
He could beat the crap out of all of us with one hand.

[00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.480]

Hey, butcher up, Jimmy.

[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.240]
Remember when Jimmy said, I don't want to go into it.

[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.540]
When he was supposed to get married the first time and like on his wedding day,

[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:30.260]
changed his mind, like the whole thing.

[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.740]
And Tony Sigerrero said, well, uh...

[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.580]
What?

[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.580]
That's what I said.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.320]
Well, he knew something.

[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:37.960]
He wasn't saying.

[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.140]

Well, I like Kepassal, USA better.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.100]
Much better show.

[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:05.960]
Oh, no question.

[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.480]

[00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.940]
Oh, see how about having used that in a long time.

[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:31.700]
Don, no.

[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.400]
Do you know who Dave Damien is?

[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:33.780]
No.

Scott Wolfe only had one and you want to one because they don't know who that is.

Who?

[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.680]

Party in your pants, five.

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.500]
Scott Wolfe floats like a butterfly and sings like a queen bee.

[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.520]

Just for fun.

[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:59.480]
Unlike a course that bitch that nasty miserable bitch that got sued for over a million bucks.

[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:01.240]
Yeah.

[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.320]
I think that's...

[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:10.400]
I think that's a good idea.

[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.160]
I think that's a good idea.

[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.160]

[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.160]

[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.240]
I think that's a good idea.

[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.740]
I think that's a good idea.

[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.580]

[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:15.700]
the

[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.580]
it. It looks like somebody ran their Humvee into the side of your SUV is what it looks like.

[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:40.860]
A big big ass dent. Unlike Challenger there was no way to prevent this but the same scenario

[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.940]
played out of Johnson Space Center Engineer's set. A problem was identified but by the time it got

[00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:52.160]
to management it was sugar-coated. Huh? How about that? Just like the O-rings on the Challenger

[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:55.660]
member that scientists warned him about that days before the launch set and about if they freeze

[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.720]
up and it's too cold and don't you dare etc. Well they wanted to get it done in time for Reagan's

[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.880]
inauguration speech so let's take a shot you know. Stay to the Union. What did I call it?

[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.800]
An inauguration. Well whatever the hell it was it stayed in speech. I forgot what it was.

[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:13.360]
If it's good enough for him yeah I got all that potato pancakes and at the French toast in my head.

[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:19.020]
I think it's a plot. I think Moe must have like planted it not there. In fact maybe they did

[00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:24.120]
call Corquers never bring it in. I dunk the bits right now. I'm sure you would. I'm sure you would.

[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:29.480]
So anyway this story about the pot trial in San Francisco. This is so typical of what's going on

[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:34.200]
with your federal government these days with your goose stepping government. What's your take on the

[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:38.780]
what with Iraq? Let's take a look at our poll first before we get into the pot story and this guy

[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.860]
who can now is facing up to 85 years in jail and the entire jury says we were we were given wrong

[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:54.100]
information if we didn't know what the consequences were and what the real deal here we wouldn't have

[00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:02.700]
been convinced it justified 19 all for it let's rule 16 that 17.9% rounded off to all those there

[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:08.120]
rounded off to I support him and I'm nervous about it eight eleven let's take care of North Korea

[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:16.980]
first ten and don't know no clue yeah four in an unusual show solidarity with the man that convicted

[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:20.680]
last week five jurors in the trial of medicinal marijuana advocate issued a public apology

[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:27.720]
yesterday and demanded that the judge grant a new trial the jurors said they'd been unaware

[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:33.980]
that the defendant Ed Rosenthal was growing marijuana for medical medicinal purposes allowing

[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.340]
allow since 1996 under California State law when they convicted him on three federal accounts

[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:42.560]
of cultivation and conspiracy he used to be sentenced in June and faces a minimum of five years

[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:48.520]
in prison and up to eighty five years I'm sorry it doesn't begin to cover it said one of the jurors

[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:52.540]
morning Craig a property manager in Nevada California it's the most horrible mistake I've

[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:57.520]
ever made my entire life and I don't think that I personally will ever recover from this the judge

[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:02.180]
in the case judge Charles Breyer a federal district court has had barred Mr. Rosenthal's defense

[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:06.380]
from mentioning the state law because he was led under federal law which was not does not

[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:11.440]
allow the growing of marijuana for any purpose when he was arrested last February Mr. Rosenthal was

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.600]
cultivating starter plants in a warehouse there were to be distributed to seriously ill patients by

[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.320]
medical marijuana clubs in the San Francisco Bay area Mr. Rosenthal who lives in Oakland was acting

[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:24.560]
in his official capacity as an officer of the city under Oakland's medical marijuana ordinance

[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.380]
Oakland officials said in a statement read outside the federal courthouse there the five jurors

[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.120]
joined by an alternate said they would not have voted to convict Mr. Rosenthal they'd been allowed

[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.900]
to consider the California law the group said they represented the views of at least two others

[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.120]
had served on the 12-member panel in good faith we as jury members allowed ourselves to be blindfolded

[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.740]
away in the evidence before us the statement said but in this trial the prosecution was allowed

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.540]
to put all of the evidence and testimony on one side one of the scales while the defense was not

[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.020]
allowed to put its evidence and testimony on the other scale therefore we were not allowed as a

[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.800]
jury to properly weigh the case one by one the juror stepped up to elect her and apologized to

[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:03.040]
Mr. Rosenthal as wife Jane Klein and their daughter Justine who stood nearby we as a jury were

[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:07.400]
truly kept in the dark said Charles Sackett of Sevastopol was the jury for me and I never want to see

[00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.040]
this ever happen again in a striking demonstration of how deep the divide remains between federal and

[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:17.240]
California laws on medicinal uses of marijuana the jurors were joined by the San Francisco district

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.060]
attorney and two members of the San Francisco board of supervisors eight other states allowed the

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:26.420]
sick and dying the smoker grow marijuana with doctors recommendation this really is a travesty

[00:33:26.420 --> 00:33:30.460]
Matt Gonzalez the board's president said of the court's decision to exclude the state law for

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.600]
Mr. Rosenthal's defense the jurors have been violated by this court Mr. Gonzalez said

[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.600]
before holding the news conference the jurors attended a hearing during which the US Attorney's

[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:46.660]
Office asked that Mr. Rosenthal's bail be revoked let me say it again the US Attorney's Office

[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:51.100]
asked that Mr. Rosenthal's bail be revoked judge Briar ruled however the Mr. Rosenthal was not

[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:56.120]
likely to flee and let him remain free on $200,000 upon pending his sentencing though none of the

[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:58.840]
jurors made their feelings known to the judge at the hearing were five of them in the alternate

[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:02.640]
sentence in the front of the courtroom Mr. Sackett said he was stared certain their presence help

[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.520]
persuade the judge to allow Mr. Rosenthal to remain free we didn't say word Mr. Sackett said

[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.340]
we're not disrespectful we just wanted to make a statement Mr. Rosenthal's lawyer said they'd

[00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.160]
filed a no emotion to have the indictment against Mr. Rosenthal dismissed if that fails they said

[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.860]
the file motion for a new trial if that should also fail lawyer said the little paedola verd to the

[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:22.960]
United States court of appeals how do you like that but the US Attorney's Office asked Mr.

[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.780]
Rosenthal's bail be revoked because he's a dangerous and hardened criminal right on a seed planter

[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:33.880]
a pot grower from anis little purposes only which is allowed under california lawyer that's what you

[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:37.800]
don't bother telling that to the jury because the federal government wants to put everybody's ass in jail

[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:38.720]
ladies and gentlemen

[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.340]

945-560 WQ-132 votes on Air-Aid isn't that interesting.

[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.100]
What's your take on the war with Iraq?

[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.740]
I'm strongly against it, 43.

[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.320]
Haven't been convinced it justified, 26.

[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.740]
All four at Let's Rule 24, that's 18.1%.

[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.800]
Aren't you surprised that those people are all four like a...

[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.000]
Shot.

[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.080]
18%.

[00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.900]
I support it, but I'm nervous about it, 20.

[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:03.780]
Let's take care of North Korea, first, 13, and don't know...

[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:04.360]
6.

[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.320]
Don't know.

[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.380]
560-560-560 Don.

[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:12.160]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line, screenless 9 to 10 hour, we'll still do that.

[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.360]
Because we don't want to have you guys having that, you know.

[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.560]
Work too hard in there during the 9 to 10 hour.

[00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:21.560]
Especially while our blood sugar is swirling all around and trying to adjust and find a happy medium.

[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.040]
After all, this potato pancakes and chunks of French toast is done.

[00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.140]
Jow that word of the other gay guy.

[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.940]
Thanks a lot to our friends at Korky's, even though they sent it to the wrong show.

[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.060]
Do not be sending mono food no more, please.

[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.080]
Unless we get it, WKYM, yes or?

[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:38.400]
Jeffrey from West Palm Beach on the mobile, like to make a comment about Challenger.

[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:39.240]
Go right ahead.

[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:41.040]
Oh, thank you.

[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:41.680]
How are you doing now?

[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:41.920]
Okay.

[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.860]
First of all, the Palm Beach post in the main section.

[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:45.600]
I don't know if you can...

[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:48.520]
The action section has a big brand of guy who wrote a long story.

[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:55.540]
You mentioned that they wanted to send a shuttle up to Coincide with Reagan's state of union address.

[00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:55.940]
Yes.

[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:59.980]
They're also forgetting the PR effort to put the teacher into space.

[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.360]
Right.

[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.560]
You're not forgetting that.

[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:01.940]
Okay.

[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:06.020]
Because when they gave the president the word that they had exploded, he said,

[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.180]
Oh, is that the one with the school teacher on it?

[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:08.820]
Yeah, very...

[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:12.780]
Of course, we were in the cold war then, so it was real important to send them up at all.

[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:13.200]

[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:13.900]
Send them a message.

[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:14.680]
Yep.

[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:15.600]
Thank you, guy.

[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.160]
Thank you.

[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:19.020]
Of course, Ronnie forgot all about that by now.

[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:19.300]
I'm sure.

[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.620]
Fives, isn't it amazing how he just keeps...

[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.300]
I don't know.

[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:23.300]
What?

[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:23.760]

[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:25.000]
Whatever it is.

[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:26.140]
Whatever you'd want to call it.

[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:26.700]
Pretty amazing.

[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.080]
Five, six, seven.

[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.760]
Because there were a lot of people that thought that he was like...

[00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.040]
Kind of like back then, too.

[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.280]
That he wasn't quite all right.

[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.880]
Well, but he did remember his line.

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.500]
Everybody looked good up there with the hair.

[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:36.040]
He did?

[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.180]
Dip it in his hair.

[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:39.020]
With all that shoe polish.

[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:39.280]
That's right.

[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:40.480]
That's it.

[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:42.960]
Not my time.

[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.040]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.560]
How you doing, Leo?

[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:46.220]
Okay, sir.

[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:49.340]
Listen, I set my resume down to screw in.

[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:53.000]
I thought I would call you to get this guy pooped.

[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.860]
But you've got to love sports, first of all.

[00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.780]
You've got to be a sports player.

[00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.660]
You have to have a blow up OJ dollar at home or else you don't qualify.

[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:00.240]
What can I sell your show?

[00:38:00.540 --> 00:38:00.740]
No.

[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:03.560]
That's not the sales people that are involved with these shows.

[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.900]
It's their involvement of ball games.

[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:05.880]
Like the...

[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.980]
Like the Marlins and stuff like that.

[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:09.000]
Oh, Christ.

[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:09.500]
Yeah.

[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.560]
That's why everybody left here.

[00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:12.220]
That's what they said.

[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:14.560]
I'd rather stick with what I'm doing cleaning out toilets.

[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.000]
Good thinking.

[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:16.820]
Have a great day, sir.

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:17.820]
Good choice.

[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.440]
Yeah, call up screw in.

[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.040]
If you'll notice even George Pointer that after in the last time we played that silly-ass thing.

[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:28.160]
If you love sports, if you're obsessed with sports, if you're a sports nerd, right?

[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.700]
That's how it starts off.

[00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:32.060]
Because aside from that, nothing else really counts.

[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.700]
And you want to work for a real nasty hateful bitch.

[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.740]
I don't want to hear it again.

[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:41.340]
Even Moe was saying that screw in was a nasty bitch and throws food at people.

[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.160]
So he started to put up a little bit.

[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:48.180]
Well, I guess when he realized there's some out there in the hall with a thin crown around it inside,

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.700]
I guess he figured he got a cover up for it.

[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.820]
I saw it, Moe.

[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:51.580]
It was moving.

[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:52.700]
It was alive.

[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:55.920]
At least part of him is anyway.

[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:57.800]
56670560.

[00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.620]
POP 560 on the AT&T.

[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:03.640]
The one thing you put in here that I love the best is...

[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:04.680]
Hey, go up those checkered pants.

[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:05.420]
I love that.

[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.040]
Thank you, Carlos.

[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:07.920]
WDQAM.

[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:14.400]
Hey, please forgive me if you've already talked about this this morning, but I just turned on your show.

[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:15.180]
We forgive you.

[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:18.700]
What happened at WRMF yesterday morning?

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:19.660]
I don't know.

[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.880]
What did happen to him?

[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.820]
Well, I was surfing around and I came in there and there was a message saying,

[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.180]
this is the general manager of WRMF.

[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:30.060]
And if you heard our morning show this morning, we apologize if you were offended.

[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.100]
We don't know if you're going to hear the same DJs tomorrow.

[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.440]
Really?

[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:34.620]
Yeah.

[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.000]
Must be the word police are out after them now.

[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.740]
I mean, they're making the rounds after everybody.

[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.500]
I'm sure Rick and Suds are poised to attack.

[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.700]
Okay, we'll pass it along.

[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:43.700]
Thanks.

[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.760]
Thanks. We'll fight out for you.

[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.200]
How do you like that WRMF?

[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.760]
Maybe they've mentioned what the AMF stood for in WRMF.

[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:49.260]
You think so?

[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.220]
Maybe or they made it in the sensitive, might it find?

[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.260]
Made an insensitive joke?

[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:56.440]
Or maybe they made it politically incorrect joke?

[00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:57.980]
Something like that.

[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:01.220]
Oh, guess who's going to be on Larry King tonight at 9 o'clock?

[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.380]
Yo, you already told me.

[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:05.900]
Condoleez is going to be on 9 o'clock tonight.

[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.940]
And you do respect her a lot, don't you?

[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:08.940]
No.

[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:09.820]
Oh, and either do I.

[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.500]
And I won't be watching.

[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.780]
I'll be at the hockey game.

[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:13.500]
WQIM.

[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:14.760]
Hey, how you doing?

[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.380]
Pretty good, sir.

[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.240]
All right.

[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.160]
I'm calling for Fort Law of the Air.

[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.220]
Well, nobody's perfect.

[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:22.440]
Hey, am I on my air?

[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.420]
It sounds just like you.

[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.680]
Oh, get out.

[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:25.220]
Oh, look at that.

[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.580]
Okay, I would like to get out right now.

[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:28.880]
I can go take a nap after all this blood sugar promulgate.

[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:29.440]
Go ahead.

[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:30.440]
Okay.

[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:34.340]
You know, those potato pancakes, man, your head starts spinning like Linda Blair, like a dreidelin heat.

[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.540]
I became a dedicated listener to you guys.

[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:38.620]
You guys are outstanding.

[00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:39.300]
Yes, we are.

[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:40.080]
Oh, yeah.

[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.160]
Although we don't love sports.

[00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.260]
I like sports a little bit.

[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.920]
George hates it and Carlistho understand it.

[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060]
But the last sports ever versus why we stand out.

[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.980]
We are going to go to the airport, burger, rest of these sports, the jock sniffing crowd.

[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:48.640]
But go ahead.

[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:54.780]
You were saying, as long as you wanted to say, you wanted to say, my opinion on this going

[00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.720]
to China Iraq, I think it's a fatal mistake.

[00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:57.100]
Yeah.

[00:40:57.480 --> 00:40:59.300]
And I'm going to be fatal for a lot of people.

[00:40:59.340 --> 00:40:59.880]
I'll tell you that.

[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:00.740]
I know.

[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.960]
And for him, for him to tell him to throw down his arms, you know, it's like, don't American

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.780]
revolution is like the British coming over here to tell us that throw down our arms.

[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.760]
Lay down your arms.

[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.540]
By the court debts, I remember that.

[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.460]
Lay down your arms.

[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.220]
Remember that song, George?

[00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:16.440]
Yeah, it is.

[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:23.640]
I don't think those people should become dispensed less when somebody is coming to attack.

[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.620]
Well, I'll tell you one thing.

[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:29.980]
They're scared, crapless and like that time, magazine, I think 84% of the Europeans think the US is the most dangerous country in the world right now.

[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:30.960]
We got them a scared.

[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.020]
If that was our goal and all of us to scare the crap out of the world, we're doing a good job of it.

[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:36.080]
Oh, yes, we are.

[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.540]
And it's not there's no smoking guns every time they come up with something.

[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:40.880]
And I'm been waiting for it.

[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:41.840]
And there's nothing.

[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.080]
Well, let me ask you this, where are you right now?

[00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:44.660]
Where are you coming from?

[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.200]
From a house, from a building, from a car?

[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.020]
Oh, no, I'm on the cell phone.

[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:48.340]
You're what?

[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:49.760]
I'm on the cell phone.

[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:50.180]
Welcome back.

[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:50.980]
Where are you?

[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:53.060]
I'm in Fort Lauderdale.

[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:56.140]
No, no, I don't mean that, but like it like in a place of building.

[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.440]
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm in a vehicle.

[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:00.320]
In a vehicle.

[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.160]
Okay, well, let me ask you, you have drugs in your vehicle?

[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:04.040]
No.

[00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.040]
Prove it.

[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.480]
There you go.

[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:06.840]
See?

[00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:07.460]
There you go.

[00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:09.600]
I think it's one point.

[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:10.560]
I think you got it.

[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.460]
I think you got it.

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:17.040]
And what we're going to do is we're going to, what we'll do is we'll have you, we'll trace the call, we'll have them put you over the authority of the populace.

[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:19.160]
And they'll search your car.

[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:19.900]
They'll tear it all apart.

[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.080]
And if we don't find anything, you know what that'll show us?

[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:24.280]
They you do a real good job of hiding it.

[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:24.720]
Right.

[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.020]
And then I think you'll victim for hiding that.

[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:27.400]
Right.

[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.000]

[00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.580]
Now you're catching on.

[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:30.320]
Right.

[00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.140]
And so I think that's a whole bunch of crap.

[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:35.560]
I can't wait for this administration to get the helipads of office.

[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.260]
The A-man.

[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.340]
Have some kind of decent administration come in there?

[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.980]
Almost anybody at this point.

[00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:42.260]
Maybe even a real Alfred E. Newman.

[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.360]
Okay, have a great day, pal.

[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:44.280]
I'd drive.

[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.240]
Drive like a bad out of hell when you hear those sirens.

[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.340]
Oh, okay.

[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:48.260]
They're after you.

[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.480]
Well, prove that you don't have drugs in there right now.

[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.060]
Do you?

[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:52.900]
No.

[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:53.320]
Don't believe it.

[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.300]
Don't believe it's either lying about it.

[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.060]
Under your mind.

[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.300]
See, it reminds me of that scene from M-Mani Python.

[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.700]
The life of Brian.

[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.400]
Wasn't that the one where they said the-

[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.300]
He who is the savior will deny it.

[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:06.660]
Right.

[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:07.300]
Right.

[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:08.360]
I'm not the savior.

[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:08.900]
I'm not the savior.

[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.100]
And then he said he denies it.

[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.240]
Okay, I am the savior.

[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:12.620]
I know.

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.040]
It's kind of a loose, loose situation is what it is.

[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:17.680]
Lose, loose.

[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.980]
Well, we don't have a smoking gun.

[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:21.600]
Of course they got those big missiles.

[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.960]
Of course there wasn't anything in them.

[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:23.820]
There was nothing in them.

[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:24.740]
See, they're hiding the content.

[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:29.220]
Oh, boy.

[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:30.660]
W-Q-I-M.

[00:43:32.260 --> 00:43:32.900]
Yes, sir.

[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:34.940]
The end of those are afraid.

[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.380]
Already being- already being dividend.

[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:38.820]
Yeah, he got to win and go that-

[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.300]
Don't play that thing I changed by mine.

[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.400]
I'll talk about whatever I want to.

[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:41.960]
Don't play rumor.

[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.740]
Oh, and thank you, but it reminds me of the rumor story.

[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.440]
So when he were a rumor, oh my god, he calls me yesterday to announce to me-

[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.240]
If it's free, it's me.

[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:50.960]
Yeah, well, we know that.

[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.720]
Lots of brownie points for the fact that he went into the-

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:54.720]

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.700]
And to pizza loft with his whole family over this last-door weekend.

[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.840]
Families down here visiting the son and daughter because it's all-

[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:01.220]
Star weekend.

[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.580]
Go into the pizza loft and maybe Jeff Cohen wasn't there.

[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.220]
And he paid for the entire meal.

[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.020]
No discount paid for the whole thing.

[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.980]
So on the one hand, it sounded like he wanted brownie points for it.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.280]
But on the other hand, he made it very clear.

[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.260]
He wasn't too happy about it, Jeff, because his name isn't in the computer.

[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.480]
I guess Jeff's got a computer that would name the people who get freebies like me and-

[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:22.200]
Scott Cohen.

[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.900]
Right, anybody else?

[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:27.140]
Al Goldstein.

[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.140]
I don't know who else.

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:29.920]
Much a low life like us.

[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.220]
But at any rate, and Jeff's name is in there.

[00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:33.500]
I mean, Jeff Rumor.

[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:35.960]
So he had to pay the entire thing.

[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.460]
So I had to promise him that I'd come out of here today.

[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.780]
Didn't have to, but I did because I'm a very good guy.

[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:44.500]
And Bitsch and Billy, that Jeff Cohen didn't have his name in there.

[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.420]
So we had to pay the whole thing.

[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:46.280]
Full price.

[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:48.400]
Ah!

[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:53.320]
This is after they drove across the street from his $2 million house.

[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.180]
His brand new house that he had built to his specs.

[00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:58.860]
Yeah, the tears are rolling down George's eye.

[00:44:59.200 --> 00:45:01.440]
Who still wants to know where the free lunch is, Rumor, okay?

[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.400]
He still wants to know where the free meal is.

[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:03.900]
Just love it.

[00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:04.500]
If he passed it.

[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.340]
If it's free, it's me.

[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.560]
Yeah, and where is my $14?

[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:07.760]
Two is a matter of fact.

[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.780]
So the best thing is yesterday, I'm looking-

[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:14.060]
I have a box in a drawer in my room.

[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.020]
In my bedroom.

[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.720]
That's got like all business cards and all that kind of stuff.

[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:19.900]
That I've accumulated over the last few years that people give me.

[00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:23.580]
And rather than having it in my wallet, which is $600, I got a fad enough fast already,

[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.720]
I stick it in this box.

[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.840]
So I'm looking for something specific in there.

[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.860]
And I find a card somebody gave me and it says,

[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.360]
Free meal for Rumor on the card.

[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:38.300]
So I look at the card and it's one of my listeners, somebody who also is obviously a Panther fan of those who Rumors,

[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:40.880]
who's got a restaurant in New York.

[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.280]
So when the Panthers play, the Rangers of the Islanders went in the city,

[00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.700]
and he invites Rumor to come in here and eat for free.

[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.680]
So I tell him that I had found this card.

[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.280]
I went and I got it out of the box.

[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.100]
And he says, oh save that, save that.

[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.240]
I can use it when we go to New York.

[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.420]
I like the famous time we ate a Ruth Chris, and they picked up the tab,

[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.080]
and they put that nice card.

[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.940]
Instead of putting a check on the table to end the meal,

[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.540]
they put a very lovely card down there.

[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:05.680]
Thank you so much.

[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:06.540]
We always enjoy having you.

[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.300]
Please accept this meal as a-

[00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.260]
on a house.

[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.040]
And I'm about to take the card and put it like-

[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.920]
Save the card for next time he says.

[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:15.740]
Save the card for next.

[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.380]
Like it's a coupon?

[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.180]
Yeah.

[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.120]
Like they won't remember that it was the last time with the premium.

[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:23.540]
So if there's anybody who ever told you an honest thing is-

[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:23.540]

[00:46:23.540 --> 00:46:24.280]
If it's free, it's free.

[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.380]
We're supporting you 5-6-0.

[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.540]
You AM.

[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.720]
Hey, what's the house of hair?

[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.600]
The temperature is zero.

[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.460]
It is cold.

[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:49.040]
It is so freaking cold.

[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.320]
And I cringe every time the wind blows.

[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:02.820]
In my pants, something is shrinking.

[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.760]
I'm so cold I can't lip-sync.

[00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:10.540]
He is one good-looking guy.

[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:15.420]
Let's because it's zero-per-in.

[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.680]
And I cannot feel my toes.

[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:28.320]
There's a tingling in my fingers.

[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:34.860]
And my bright red parts are floating.

[00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:53.540]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:55.620]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:55.620]

[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:55.760]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:55.860]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:58.400]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:04.840]
And my eyes are floating.

[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.840]
Let's because it's zero-per-in.

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:16.040]
I can barely move my mouth.

[00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.280]
I'm a red-hard-larked lover.

[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:29.540]
But first I need to be told out.

[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.540]
Yes, I need to be told out.

[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.960]
That's because it's zero.

[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.440]
I said, free-all.

[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.320]
10.0.2560.

[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:48.520]
I'm a QAM. It's cold, all right.

[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:49.940]
Let me heat it up for you.

[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:54.320]
Anyways, our big 10-hour and then we got the 11-hour and then we got the comedy bits.

[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.360]
Why is she all bundled up in there?

[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:56.860]
You know something?

[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.080]
And now I know who did it in here last night from the thermostat.

[00:48:59.400 --> 00:48:59.760]
He did.

[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.080]
He must be another one of these frigid people like you that's always frozen.

[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:04.640]
The rooms are in battle.

[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.060]
It was 76 degrees in here.

[00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.060]
Is it the potato pancakes?

[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.120]
I'm looking on there at 75.7.

[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:19.320]
And now it's 7.1 because I turned it down and now it's turned into a cool.

[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.440]
And he's like all hunched up with a jacket on there.

[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:23.560]
Like he's in the Arctic circle or something, jerk.

[00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:25.480]
Man, what is wrong with you?

[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.740]
So anyway, we'll be playing comedy bits noona one.

[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:31.460]
We're going back, whatever, whatever prompted me to do that.

[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.880]
Was it Eric's idea or Carla?

[00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:33.960]
Oh, it was a dead ass morning.

[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:34.800]
It was your idea.

[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.020]
It was a bad idea.

[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.600]
I've do 9 to 10 with that.

[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.560]
It was a bad idea.

[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:40.680]
Let's do it again.

[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.260]
No, I'm not going to do it again.

[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:42.520]
I'm not going to do it again.

[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.440]
Well, I'll stand to 11.0.

[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:44.100]
I'm not going to do it again.

[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:45.940]
I'll stand to 11.0.

[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.180]
Now seriously, that was a terrible idea.

[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:52.280]
It's just so damn frustrating that these people over here, they move so slowly.

[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.840]
Well, they understand that this show really ought to be on from 10 to 2.

[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.020]
Or else it was something.

[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.340]
And they're thinking about it.

[00:49:58.340 --> 00:49:59.120]
They're examining it.

[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.720]
They're putting a stethoscope up there.

[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.540]
Each other's ass.

[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.680]
They're considering they're holding hands.

[00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.800]
They're calling signals in the huddle.

[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:06.880]
Whatever they're doing.

[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.960]
And the main time, we're like, well, so we'll do the best we can.

[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:10.660]
That's all we can do.

[00:50:11.060 --> 00:50:12.440]
You can't be better than number one.

[00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:13.740]
We'd like a bigger number than that.

[00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:17.060]
And of course, if George wouldn't chase him away in the summertime and I'd stop reading bedtime stories,

[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.080]
then maybe we might have the ungar audience back.

[00:50:19.220 --> 00:50:19.640]
But I'm sorry.

[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:20.040]
Huh?

[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:22.560]
No, we don't care if they're a hundred.

[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:23.320]
We don't give a crap.

[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.320]
As long as they listen to it, even if they hate us like poison.

[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:26.420]
Now, I do want to say this.

[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.880]
The poll that we're taking right now, it goes to Shory.

[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:32.880]
I've always told you that the people who tend to be politically a little on the right,

[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.880]
if it catch my drift, that they're a little more dedicated than the rest of us.

[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.520]
And so as a result, now it's up to 23%.

[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:42.240]
It was right there at 18%, which it always seems to be the bush people.

[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:46.040]
You know, the ones who would follow over the edge of a cliff, kind of like you saw in small veil last night.

[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.520]
But Clark won't be there to catch us.

[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:48.620]
Damn it.

[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.260]
So I would just suggest that those people who are like world protestors

[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.500]
and have other ideas might want to like get heavy duty on a poll also.

[00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:01.000]
Since they're loading it up, I check to make sure we weren't being freaked by those freak assholes,

[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:01.980]
you know, the ones who like to look.

[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.960]
I mean, it's like a bunch of little children.

[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:05.700]
We're going to get in there.

[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.380]
We're going to show them.

[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:07.820]
We're going to like twist the results of the poll.

[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.800]
Is if that changes anybody's opinion, which it does not, just stupid.

[00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:15.520]
People with too much time in there want to go out and do something constructive like playing golf.

[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.680]
Speaking of people with too much time on their hands, Rimmer.

[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:21.940]
What's your take on the war with Iraq?

[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.540]
I'm strongly against it 54.

[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:24.880]
Having them a convention, it's justified.

[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:25.820]
I get 54.

[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:27.940]
That's 49.6% right there.

[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:28.840]
All for it.

[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.940]
Let's roll 50, 23%.

[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:32.400]
Out of 218 votes.

[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.280]
I support it, but I'm nervous about 29.

[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.860]
Let's take care of North Korea for his 22.

[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:45.500]
And don't know as in...

[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:47.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.480]
We're doing screenless today, by the way, Torch.

[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.140]
Oh, I see.

[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:53.400]
You want to put a lot of pressure on you because you've exerted so much energy gesticulating

[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.140]
and rumple stillsking in there for Carlos.

[00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.620]
What is he screaming about anyway?

[00:51:58.700 --> 00:51:59.740]
What's he getting all like motivated?

[00:51:59.980 --> 00:52:03.240]
I know it's nothing, probably about something and a super blind date thing you're watching the more.

[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.720]
And he's bouncing up and even a buff came in here and said, see, the walls are shaken.

[00:52:07.300 --> 00:52:10.220]
If you were that animated when you were on the air, we'd have at least a five-share anyway.

[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.780]
You might have a number instead of all these people saying that you're a mumbler in the termally boring.

[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.480]
If you got that animated on the air like I do, all these people.

[00:52:17.980 --> 00:52:18.800]
Both of your listeners.

[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.400]
No, seriously, get a little more animated on the air.

[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:25.180]
Save it the energy for when you're on the air, not off the air when nobody's paying any attention.

[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.300]
You think he gives a crap?

[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.940]
He couldn't care less what you're talking about.

[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.120]
He couldn't care.

[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:30.940]
Just give him the $1.75 an hour.

[00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:32.880]
Let him take a few fag breaks out there.

[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:34.080]
Stopping like a broadside in front.

[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.220]
And that's all he cares about.

[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.080]
Come in here at night and dittle with my computer.

[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:39.320]
That he get a raise he doesn't know about, $1.75.

[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.760]
50 is sent an hour.

[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:41.280]
Net.

[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:45.740]
$5.670, $5.60, $5.60.

[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.020]
On the AT&T and Verizon line up.

[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.440]
We could power our coal and power that at 10.30, whatever he's going to start speaking of the UN.

[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.360]
But we won't.

[00:52:53.060 --> 00:52:56.060]
Not that we don't want to put some of it on, but he's going to be talking for an hour and a half.

[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.680]
And we can't afford the luxury of it.

[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.620]
People don't want to see it.

[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:00.040]
It's on all the networks, okay?

[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.460]
Exactly.

[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.160]
Plus there's no smoking gun.

[00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:03.960]
You got it?

[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.560]
We know you're hiding it from us.

[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.380]
We know you're really no threat to us, but we don't really care about that.

[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:13.820]
Since this deal was decided over a year ago, last year, anywhere, when Carl Rove said,

[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:15.300]
we're playing the war card.

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:17.700]
We're playing the war card.

[00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:21.760]
I mean, it's just hopeless.

[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.380]
There's just that element and it's on all sides politically.

[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.940]
That's why politics are so bad all over the world, especially here, because we live here.

[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:29.980]
At least I do part of the time.

[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.960]
It's because you've got people who are just blinded to the right.

[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:36.960]
Like that bit says.

[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.180]
Or by the left or whoever to get sucked in by.

[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:41.120]
They're all a bunch of crooks.

[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:43.760]
Let's face it, it's just a question of which ones are most dangerous.

[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:46.460]
And right now we know exactly who's the most dangerous.

[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:47.180]
Yeah.

[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.840]
Somebody to QIM.

[00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:50.660]
George?

[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:51.280]
Yes.

[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.460]
Hey, how are you?

[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.080]
Good morning.

[00:53:54.060 --> 00:53:55.220]
Are you okay, mumble?

[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:55.960]
Yes.

[00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.220]
I got some good news for you.

[00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:58.540]
Okay.

[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.640]
I thought it was George.

[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:02.840]
You know how are you?

[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.600]
You want to speak to George?

[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:04.980]
You sound a little bit disappointed now.

[00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:06.140]
Not at all.

[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:06.720]
How are you?

[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:07.480]
I'm doing good.

[00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.360]
I gleaned some good news.

[00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.740]
This was actually for George, but you might be interested in this.

[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:17.680]
And from the New York Times this morning that the DEA is not doing a good job.

[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.100]
It'll really caught what does that mean?

[00:54:21.420 --> 00:54:25.640]
The drug enforcement agency has not stemmed any kind of...

[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.500]
Well, is that a bulletin?

[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:31.660]
No, it's a bulletin that they're actually realizing it.

[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:32.480]
Yeah.

[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:35.460]
They're doing a good job in California, busting the medicinal bulletin.

[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:35.580]
Right.

[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:36.420]
Yeah.

[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.440]
Actually, I don't know what it was.

[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:46.260]
Just like that article that I read before, the fact that the United States attorney made a desperate attempt to get Mr. Rosenthal's bail revoked,

[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:48.080]
described it as they're hanging out to dry.

[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.440]
That goes to show you that they're not doing a good job or not.

[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:52.460]
They have to...

[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:56.760]
They are compelled to continue doing this crap because they have to protect their bureaucracy.

[00:54:57.260 --> 00:54:59.280]
Otherwise, if there's no DEA, they're all out on the street.

[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.360]
Just like any other government breath.

[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:03.180]
You're acting right.

[00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:03.820]
That's right.

[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:04.740]
Exactly.

[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:05.760]
All right.

[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:06.660]
Thank you.

[00:55:06.720 --> 00:55:07.880]
Good luck, you sir, and don't try it.

[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.340]
I guess this guy thinks he was going to tell you about it.

[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:11.760]
I guess he thinks you're a drug or something.

[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:13.420]
That's how one of your customers...

[00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.160]
What would you get that impression?

[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.000]
560-560.

[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.540]
Why every time I say that you get so defensive, you sell drugs, okay?

[00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:19.960]
No.

[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:20.560]
Prove it.

[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.360]
Nine minutes after ten.

[00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.880]
And Carlis buys them, don't you?

[00:55:27.740 --> 00:55:28.160]
Prove it.

[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:28.780]
Oh, he says yes.

[00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:32.460]
I want to know where to buy them.

[00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:34.000]
He is just a little prick.

[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.300]
There's just nothing like it.

[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:36.580]
I wonder if he can obey them to sink.

[00:55:37.240 --> 00:55:39.420]
And by the way, I saw Moe was on a way to the...

[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:42.760]
As soon as Carlis made a b-line in there, Moe was on a way in there to help him adjust his toothbrush.

[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:44.740]
He wanted to help him scrub it.

[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:51.280]
Nine minutes after ten at 560 WDQM, he ever presented with an opportunity when you should have cut a whiter or did something,

[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.480]
but you didn't when you passed.

[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:53.160]
Oh boy.

[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:57.260]
But there's an incredible Fannie Mae mortgage rate out there at 3.45%.

[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:03.100]
And this rate's available by calling financial group toll free 1-800-940-5363.

[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:03.840]
What is that?

[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:06.120]
1-800-9453-63.

[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:16.160]
If you were to compare a 7% rate with 3.45%, you'd save $3,500 in the first year loan for each $100,000 that you owe, $100,000 bucks cost you only $447 a month.

[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:19.480]
Here's an opportunity that won't last because it's a 40 year low.

[00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:26.420]
So if you've been thinking about refinancing or buying a home call financial group toll free, 1-800-940-5363.

[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:29.760]
The process is simple and the call is absolutely positively free.

[00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.640]
You got nothing loose but a big day chunk off what you're paying every month.

[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.940]
1-800-940-LEND financial group has been an equal housing lender to thousands of borrowers with a Fannie Mae program.

[00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:40.500]
Credit restrictions do apply.

[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:42.460]
Rates are something to change if you wait too long.

[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.040]
So don't fiddle around 5.34 APR by the way.

[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.680]
Call financial group today at all the details.

[00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:47.740]
There is no obligation.

[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:51.420]
Call tool free 1-800-940-LEND.

[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:51.980]
$100,000-LEND.

[00:56:52.260 --> 00:56:55.160]
$100,000-LEND.

[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.000]
This is sports radio fly city.

[00:56:57.560 --> 00:56:58.460]
You way, yeah.

[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.600]
Oh, R-O-N.

[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:05.820]
Welcome back to the Superfluous Connolly Linguists of the Mohawada Davidor Togin.

[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.660]
Where we got the three-quilers on power rotation for your perusials.

[00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:10.440]
Hey, Mo!

[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:10.980]
What?

[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.580]
This better not be about Hoki!

[00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.440]
We got special guests today!

[00:57:14.780 --> 00:57:18.240]
No one's allowed in here unless they bring food for their king giggiggiggiggiggiggigg.

[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:20.560]
Too late! That already booked them!

[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.900]
What the hell are these muzzle moons?

[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.020]
That's the recon sucks!

[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.540]
You know, drive home with us today!

[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:28.540]
Good job.

[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:29.040]
Sorry!

[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.680]
I never heard of you bumming.

[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.580]
Well, I wonder why.

[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.400]
So what do you do?

[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:33.520]
You got an act?

[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:34.040]
Yeah!

[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:34.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:36.360]
Exactly. Like what?

[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:37.920]
We spin the wheel.

[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.440]
Wherever the wheel stops, we grab meat off of it.

[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:41.740]
We slam it. You name it.

[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:42.680]
What's funny about that?

[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.440]
Well, you got a point there.

[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:46.080]
Why can't you just ask me a question?

[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.440]
You ready to put your head in the toilet bowl?

[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:50.480]
You think that's funny, huh?

[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:51.960]
Well, I got news for you, pal.

[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:53.460]
You both stink!

[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:56.900]
I'm talking about the precipice of getting fired at it right now.

[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:57.560]
What a bummer!

[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:58.700]
Get out of my place of business!

[00:57:58.820 --> 00:57:59.080]
No!

[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:00.320]
Alright, alright, something.

[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.220]
I'll give you one more chance to show me what you got.

[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.520]
I hope this isn't really funny because I got a really full bladder.

[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.680]
Alright, these are things that probably adults would know.

[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:10.520]
They're like old sayings and I want you to fill in the blank.

[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.300]
You know how to do that?

[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:12.600]
Yeah. Here we go.

[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.360]
The bigger they are, the harder they...

[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.300]
Get to do it.

[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:17.720]
Yeah!

[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:19.600]
What do you think?

[00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.040]
Did I give Clemens Clemens to give you Clemens to live?

[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.220]
How dare you laugh at me!

[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.900]
I suppose you want to rape me now, huh?

[00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:28.500]
Yeah.

[00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:29.660]
Start licking that.

[00:58:29.660 --> 00:58:30.720]
Would be wild, yeah.

[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:32.280]
Alright, alright.

[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.600]
I don't even care anymore.

[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.740]
Hey, can I be hold my green penis?

[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:37.560]
Okay.

[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:39.440]
What are you looking at?

[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.680]
Freckle face fanny.

[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.320]
And you guys got a condo.

[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.620]
That's condom, Mo.

[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:44.360]
What of it?

[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:45.100]
Yeah, I do.

[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.580]
I mean, I don't suds does.

[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:47.020]
Fine.

[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.520]
And I might as well warn you.

[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:49.820]
I didn't boost today.

[00:58:50.020 --> 00:58:50.300]
Okay.

[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:52.800]
Now you have to say, spin your meat, Rick and suds.

[00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:55.280]
Spin your meat, Rick and...

[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:55.820]
Let's do it!

[00:58:57.220 --> 00:58:57.560]
Oh!

[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.340]
Oh!

[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:00.360]
Oh!

[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:00.880]

[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:01.740]
Oh!

[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:01.840]

[00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:03.740]
Oh, got it.

[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.780]
Oh, what's the matter?

[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.840]
I was shooting first.

[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.640]
Oh, see, I told you it's not my day.

[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.560]
I'm so embarrassed.

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:14.720]
You are a fucking idiot.

[00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.120]
I should've budgeted the funny okay.

[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:20.200]
It's not my embarrassing.

[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:22.240]
You're too much.

[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.060]
Poisonable.

[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.040]
Oh, okay.

[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:24.740]
Oh, oh.

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:25.200]
Clean up.

[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.420]
Maybe that's what Mo was talking about about the scrant Ivan Kenni.

[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:31.300]
And I haven't had fudge in years, you know what?

[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.280]
Have you?

[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.700]
No, that you mentioned it?

[00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:35.860]
No.

[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.680]
I love fudge.

[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:37.280]
It's great.

[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:38.820]
You don't like fudge?

[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.380]
You want to try it with something ass, so I'm glad.

[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.240]
You don't like anything good.

[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.700]
And don't be turning the heat up here to 80 degrees anymore, please.

[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:45.680]
Not while I'm here.

[00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:47.260]
Anyway, American Airlines,

[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:49.500]
it's just $1.8 billion in cuts to save the airline.

[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:50.920]
Americans about on a verge too.

[00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.020]
How do you like that?

[00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:54.100]
And United?

[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.480]
What do we got left?

[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:57.800]
When you come right down to where you got

[00:59:57.800 --> 00:59:59.260]
Killa, I'm Northwest, right?

[00:59:59.420 --> 01:00:00.340]
That's like there together.

[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.480]
And they're not in good shape either.

[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.540]
You got Erick Canada.

[01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.520]
Thank God, Helen.

[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.480]
Thank God for you guys.

[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:06.380]
Who else we got?

[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:06.900]
Delta.

[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.660]
Delta is ready when you are sometime.

[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.840]
And if not, you're about to luck anyway.

[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:10.080]
Right.

[01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:11.220]
Yeah.

[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:13.240]
TWA?

[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:13.740]
Not.

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.220]
Pan Am?

[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:15.660]
Not.

[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:16.440]
Easter?

[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:17.280]
Not.

[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:19.260]
Crazy Clown.

[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.180]
What's the one about you, Jet?

[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:20.740]
Vagna Jet.

[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:20.980]
Not.

[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:23.580]
We look down on there, climbing around.

[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.500]
Virginera is still around if you want to go under with that goofball.

[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:27.180]
Yeah.

[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:27.780]
Courtney?

[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:29.660]
Yeah, Courtney's love.

[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:30.120]
Cox.

[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:31.980]
So that's it.

[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.300]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:36.700]
And it's really sad.

[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:37.900]
And America is sitting back on,

[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.820]
oh, what are we going to do about that space shuttle?

[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:41.520]
You know, I mean, it was sad, like I said.

[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:43.140]
How many hours and days we got?

[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:44.780]
Oh, the delegates are arriving at the UN.

[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.460]
Oh, you're like that.

[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.420]
And again, ready for Colin Powell to open up his mouth and say,

[01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.760]
there's no smoking gun button and he's going to go on for an hour and a half of speculating.

[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:54.360]

[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:58.800]
All right, we got to do this now because Sodom's a bad guy and he's still a freight trainer too.

[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.740]
Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.660]
Here's our only call on screen.

[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:08.420]
That's pretty scary.

[01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:08.760]
Hello.

[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:09.880]
Hello, Neil.

[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:10.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.340]
Yes, good morning.

[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.000]
I would like to give my perspective on Iraq before our Secretary of State begins.

[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:16.440]
Yes.

[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:17.520]
Okay, though.

[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:24.660]
The way I see it is, even if we do bring about a democracy to Iraq and rid of that tyranny,

[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.420]
we're going to have a problem because if you think about it, Saudi Arabia that borders Iraq to the south, right?

[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:33.660]
There are biggest allies in that region.

[01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.820]
So it would be kind of awkward if you think about it that on the one hand,

[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.480]
we would be bringing about a democracy to one country and on the other hand,

[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:44.520]
we would be supporting a marketer to press its people.

[01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.020]
Mm-hmm.

[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.680]
So I mean...

[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.660]
And what about Iran?

[01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.480]
Oh, that's an RC.

[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:51.900]
Let me tell you something that most Americans don't realize.

[01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.940]
Unfortunately, geographically, we're a little...

[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:54.860]
And what about Pakistan?

[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:56.320]
Exactly.

[01:01:56.660 --> 01:02:00.860]
But see, with Iraq, the problem is Syria that's located to its west.

[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:04.240]
And Iran is okay to its east, Turkey to the north.

[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.680]
No, I know the map.

[01:02:05.860 --> 01:02:06.680]
You know, exactly.

[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:14.500]
See, if we destabilize Iraq, we could think about it going into a country is not exactly going to be an easy task.

[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.820]
I don't care how these people want to portray it.

[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:23.500]
And even if we aren't successful, what I'm worried about is the aftermath of it.

[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:24.820]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:29.280]
Because if we go in there and we bring about a democracy, a lot of people in the Middle East are saying,

[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:30.680]
hey, what are the Americans doing?

[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.640]
They're bringing about democracy and they're supporting the monarchy.

[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.540]
That's why it'll some of them not unjustify the attacks.

[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:42.500]
Because he kept saying, hey, the Americans are being hypocrites because they're a democracy,

[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.900]
yet they're advocating a monarchy that suppresses its people.

[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.520]
And it's true.

[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.700]
There is no liberty in Saudi Arabia.

[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:49.500]
Or in Jordan.

[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.700]
Or in Syria.

[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:51.980]
Or in Lebanon.

[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:52.840]
Exactly.

[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:53.840]
Or in Egypt.

[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.260]
No, not that.

[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:56.600]
Then I say Libya or in Kuwait.

[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:59.060]
Or in America.

[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:00.880]
Or in America.

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:01.020]

[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:01.280]
Or in America.

[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:01.740]
Or in America.

[01:03:02.020 --> 01:03:02.220]
Or in America.

[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:02.400]
Or in America.

[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.120]
Or in America.

[01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:03.400]
Or in America.

[01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.140]
Or in America.

[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:05.260]
Or in America.

[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:05.440]

[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:06.700]
Or in America.

[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:07.540]
Or in America.

[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:07.700]
Or in America.

[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:08.200]
Or in America.

[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:08.680]
Or in America.

[01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.180]
Or in America.

[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.140]
Or in America.

[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.860]
Or in America.

[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.120]
Or in America.

[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.100]
Or in America.

[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:25.940]
Or in America.

[01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:26.080]
Or in America.

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:26.080]

[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:28.460]
And we're back in Pakistan, by the way, we just mentioned that in passing.

[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.400]
Who selected them, practically hand picked.

[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.700]
Who also opened up all those madrasas, which the Saudis taught them how to do.

[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:37.300]
But nevertheless, they were willing to co-conspirators.

[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:37.700]
And who they felt.

[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:40.960]
Who opened up all those madrasas that they funded so that they could brainwash all the young men

[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.320]
to hate the West and kill us.

[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.100]
Are they the best of Pakistan?

[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:48.680]
other than that they're wonderful folks never stood afraid train so this

[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.920]
business of picking and choosing and also the thing anybody saw 60 minutes

[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.380]
about North Korea Sunday night if that didn't just scared live in daylight Saudi

[01:03:56.660 --> 01:04:01.380]
I mean there is virtually nobody there other than the very very the wealthiest

[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.600]
of the wealthy and even they have no running water they don't except for the

[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:09.980]
rain that I have no running water so I guess they didn't bring in a lot of

[01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.420]
bottle water yeah

[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:16.940]
got a was a good work for North Korea the way those people are living and of

[01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:19.360]
course he's got all the military they're all goose stepping along he's got a

[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.780]
million military crazy person but we're not we're not we'll be with him

[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:28.900]
diplomatically even though of course as we spoke the other day as we speak

[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.460]
right now they're moving things around again right now to start you know

[01:04:32.460 --> 01:04:35.780]
mobilizing the movement of plutonium they get ready to start pumping up the

[01:04:35.780 --> 01:04:39.680]
nuclear weapons everything they got but work a little bit concerned because

[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.700]
we did anything with them you know how many people in Seoul and Tokyo could be

[01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:48.220]
dead within a matter of hours oh see well I guess we're not really concerned

[01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:51.240]
about as the aftermath of what's going to happen for example there was a see we

[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.640]
headed on the website but I'd like to read these because they're too depressing

[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.720]
we're supposed to be entertaining on yesterday's bedtime stories a rice

[01:04:57.720 --> 01:05:00.780]
developed kind of terrorist disrupt plans for attack this is one from the

[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.660]
ultra right wing Washington Times that's a liberal pico magazine or newspaper

[01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:09.460]
Al-Qaeda is planning a mass casualty attack to rival 911 preparations

[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:12.300]
have been disrupted by a rest of terrorists during the past several months

[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.400]
according to US intelligence officials recent intelligence reports indicate

[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.140]
that communications among clandestine cells of al-Qaeda members are being

[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:22.620]
restored gradually they said the attack will be on a large scale one official

[01:05:22.620 --> 01:05:26.040]
said additionally the intelligence reports stated that any major attack is

[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.460]
likely to be preceded by smaller scale strikes including assassinations of

[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:33.240]
prominent people in the US officials didn't provide details on the latest

[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.720]
threat which was contained in intelligence reports sent to senior Bush

[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.720]
administration officials last week the warning didn't say whether the attacks

[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.700]
would be in the u.s. or abroad we continue to be in a heightened threat

[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.540]
environment said u.s. officials with access to intelligence reports would

[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:50.080]
decline to comment further so what's going to happen if we start dropping the

[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:55.360]
first bombs on bagged-dead we don't know but we can assume it probably isn't

[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:01.280]
going to be very good no and we're not talking about just one big mass attack

[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.060]
like is talking about here there's not nothing to say that we're at that

[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.640]
point not going to start seeing isolated attacks car bombings like they're

[01:06:07.640 --> 01:06:11.500]
used to in the middle east every single day right snipings shot out shopping

[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.820]
classes being blown up little things like that suicide bombers right here on

[01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:18.900]
our soil because that'll be the excuse that they've been waiting for this is

[01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:22.540]
exactly these are the seeds that Osama Imam was planning that's what he wanted

[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:27.620]
this is exactly what he wanted and we're goose stepping along of course the

[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:32.120]

really want to get somebody in the real enemy is the French the French

[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:52.960]
that they're attacking us right now yeah the French is the hub of the

[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:57.100]
terrorist I mean this is really the main supporters of what is wrong with

[01:06:57.100 --> 01:07:01.480]
everything in our global nation they represent everything that's wrong well

[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.400]
I mean I have no love for the

[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:06.860]
no they're not our allies that you're right we finally said that the other day

[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.640]
and I found the few honest things that's got to go to the family they're not

[01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:14.700]
our allies well I like this the bomb Paris with that that's what we should do

[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.260]
I'm purely and then hit the Germans next yeah okay great and then we'll be

[01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:22.680]

[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:26.900]
be with us that's exactly what's going on in this country right now don't

[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.120]
remember what the president said there there's only between you either are

[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:34.020]
with us or you're against this no sitting on the fence no switcher lens no

[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:37.100]
neutrality no like we're thinking about it none of that either you're with us

[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.680]
against this it's the black and white world the good guys over here and the bad

[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:45.380]
guys over there and that's it and this jackass that we just spoke to he's he

[01:07:45.380 --> 01:07:50.080]
that's his mentality that's what he believes nobody here's defending the

[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.440]
French they're scum I've always said that long before any of this stuff going on

[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.920]
but we're not at war with the French and if anybody wants to talk about who's

[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.640]
responsible these Saudis would be a real good place to start Saudi Arabia North

[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:06.880]
Korea won Saudi Arabia to Pakistan three and then if we got some time left over

[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.940]
uh... saw them number four because he ain't going anywhere he's got no military

[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:14.240]
left to begin with right see that's the question you have to ask yourself does

[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:17.700]
he really represent a threat to us well I believe these these missiles that

[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.640]
contain nothing that were empty right they had a range of two hundred uh...

[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:25.400]
twenty miles I'm sorry not two hundred twenty miles yeah basically basically

[01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:30.080]
useless they can't that that can't clear the border right that's right

[01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:35.400]
but don't you feel there's calling policy and he by with the jack straw

[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:40.400]
you know jack straw yes i think he's the last straw that's probably the more

[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.500]
likely problem out there's we're not gonna get that again all good thank god for

[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:45.620]
that we're not going to get that again

[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.440]
thank the lord for that

[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:49.140]

[01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:58.220]
such a waste of time i guess it helps us all get out of our system but what

[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.200]
you discuss on here now and all these peace protest they're not having an

[01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:04.660]
impact because this already been decided upon that's why cool and pal who was

[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:07.560]
the one that they had in there who was trying to hold all this off for months

[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.040]
and months he finally sold out

[01:09:10.860 --> 01:09:14.460]
they got to it they got to him he sold out he's there to make the case today

[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:20.660]

hotel queen, the owner, howls, I've been robbed as jury wall absurd for 11 million big ones

[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:31.280]
a manhattan grand jury got downright nasty and Manhattan jury would Leonor Helmsley yesterday

[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:36.760]
slapping her with 11.175 million dollar verdict for discriminating against a gay employee

[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:40.960]
all while the billionaire equipped after the four women to manjury soaked her for the spectacular

[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.840]
sum finding she'd subjected Charles Beldewa hostile work environment when he was

[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:48.380]
the manager of a park lane hotel what am I gonna lose now my virginity she said

[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:53.660]
but she quickly made it clear she was not amused I feel I've been robbed she said

[01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:57.640]
the jury took just four hours to find that Bell sexuality was a motivating factor

[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.140]
in Helmsley decision to firemaffread spent just four months on the job causing him

[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:06.900]
severe emotional distress this shows Ms. Hemsley is not above the law Bell said she can't act

[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.180]
this way toward her employees the so-called queen of mean didn't act as if she'd been chastised

[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:15.040]
however and while she showed no reaction while the verdict was read she vented her royal wrath

[01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:19.240]
on the jury Bell and the judge after the proceeding was over they're crazy they don't like me I guess

[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.620]
she said of the jurors referring to their verdict as shameful it's encouraging more people to

[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:29.540]
use dope to cheat to steal she said Bell broke every rule etc so well too bad cough it up bitch

[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.100]

70 Q I M hello hello Neil yes sir yeah Neil yeah you were talking about North Korea

[01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:05.500]
yeah but you leave out the fact that in 94 Clinton signed that agreement with them gave him 500

[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:11.660]
million dollars the blackmail yeah and two reactors and then they cheated on that and they built

[01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:16.180]
the nukes anyways but now it's too late now and you notice that they only the ratchet it up after

[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:21.880]
this whole evil empire things started this evil doers thing well we nearly did them well

[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:27.500]
Bill and the bomb has not done over six months or a year period yeah dad and the bill what does

[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:31.020]
that have to do with what's going on now see what do you want to do is play politics Bill Clinton did

[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:34.880]
this and yeah Bill Clinton said by also what I could have had a chance to get Osama and they

[01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:38.480]
they they sent one cruise missile after him oops it was a little bit too late or two whatever

[01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:44.960]
it how it was no clear Clinton right now case their Clinton's not an office right now George W

[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.300]
Bush is an office quit playing out Clinton bashing all right he's not there anymore which I'm sure

[01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:54.840]
he president greatly because he got nothing to talk about he's been gone for two years plus

[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.880]
and Clinton did this and pop a bush did that well that's that's unfortunate but in the meantime

[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:07.300]
that's what we're faced with in the world today okay where's an article about North Korea by the way

[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:14.040]
do I have it do I got it oh yeah here it is Nick Kristoff we headed on the website yesterday

[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:19.720]
our bedtime story he says the North Korea nuclear crisis is far more perilous than many people

[01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:23.840]
realize the White House wanted to keep the focus on Iraq did not even bother to tell us that

[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:28.620]
satellite images show North Korea apparently taking steps toward reprocessing plutonium it was left

[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:33.920]
to my New York Times colleague David Sanger to alert the public just a few days ago can you imagine

[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:38.220]
if or where Iraq had been spotted moving nuclear fuel around the news that the Pentagon is reinforcing

[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.720]
its preparedness on the Korean Peninsula suggests that it doesn't believe the White House law

[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:46.800]
by either when North Korea has reprocessed its plutonium and built five more nuclear weapons probably

[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.440]
by summer it'll try to pressure us into a new package deal to understand how dangerous the

[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:54.580]
Korean peninsula could become consider one worst case scenario.

[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:00.620]
February 14 the CIA confirms the North Korea's reprocessing plutonium making a preemptive US

[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:04.520]
military strike more difficult because of the risk of radiation leakage. September 15 this is

[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.500]
not a crisis the White House declares. March 17 North Korea announces that a resume missile test

[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:14.580]
stocks plunged in Tokyo and Seoul. March 26 North Korea test fires a two-stage tapodong

[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:19.540]
two missile it soars over Japan knocking 9% off the Tokyo stock market. CIA analyst warned that

[01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.360]
a three-stage version of the tapodong took a reach US mainland. March 27 this is not a major crisis

[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.680]
the White House declares. April 7 on the birthday of the late great leader Kim Il Sung North Korea

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:33.820]
resumes construction of a nuclear reactor in Tachon that'll be capable of producing plutonium

[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:38.660]
for 44 warheads annually. May 1 the UN Security Council approved sanctions without Chinese

[01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:43.360]
enforcement they mean little. June 29 North Korea completes reprocessing and the plutonium is

[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:48.320]
dispersed and made into warheads. July 10 North Korea, North Korea test a nuclear device,

[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.600]
stocks tumble worldwide leading a big Japanese bank to the edge of bankruptcy. July 12 North Korea

[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:57.580]
formally declares itself a nuclear state probably asserting that the Korean bomb will be used on

[01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:01.380]
behalf of all Koreans to combat Japanese and American aggressors stocks plunge worldwide

[01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:06.440]
triggering a Japanese banking crisis and a global recession. July 13th is not a monumental crisis

[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:13.200]
the White House says. July 15 Tokyo's mayor Isha Haara launches a campaign for Prime Minister on

[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:17.720]
a platform of building nuclear weapons. July 20th with its plutonium safely hidden North

[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:22.040]
Korea against the pressure of the US to negotiate a package solution to the crisis its troop spray

[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:28.080]
machine gun fire across the DMZ South Korea and Japanese stock markets fall 7%. August 1st the

[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:32.380]
seal file of anthrax is found in Osaka subway car. No one has heard but some commentators

[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:36.660]
suggested a message from North Korea to US you better talk to us. August 5th Iranian Libyan

[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:40.900]
nuclear buyers are spotted shipping in Pyongyang. August 6th we shouldn't exaggerate the crisis

[01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:44.140]
the White House says as we've said from the beginning we're always ready to sit down with North

[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:49.240]
Korea and talk. August 13th Don Rumsfeld offers three military options to President Bush the

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.920]
minimal one cost for a cruise missile strike on North Korea's unknown nuclear facilities but

[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.560]
because the plutonium has been reprocessed and the warheads are hidden we can't take out its nuclear

[01:17:56.560 --> 01:18:00.740]
arsenal. The maximum one also destroys North's air defense system and much of its artillery.

[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:05.440]
August 16th Intelligence Intercepts in Zest and North Korea respond to even a minimal US military

[01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:09.020]
strike by launching conventional missile sides of Japan into a broader strike by turning

[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.240]
solar into a sea of fire. The CIA warns that if North finds itself losing conventional

[01:18:13.240 --> 01:18:17.360]
war to use chemical, biological and possibly nuclear weapons against Japan and US forces in

[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.800]
South Korea all sides brace for a new Korean war which the CIA estimates could kill a million people.

[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:26.800]
August 17th Cool and Powell is told by President Bush if only we'd listen to you two years ago

[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:30.180]
off the need to engage North Korea even this February if we'd only started negotiations

[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:34.140]
I'm sorry cold and we blew it then Mr. Powell wakes up and realizes he was dreaming.

[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.060]
Wrote in a crystal for yesterday's New York Times.

[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.380]
So that's just not a good idea.

[01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:40.740]
That's not outstanding since 1998.

[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:46.180]
Well thanks very much Colin we're quite a hear there. He's been outstanding since 1998 and he is mild.

[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:56.460]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. How's that pull coming? What's your take on

[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:59.520]
what were the rack as the Secretary of State is making the case right now as we speak?

[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.980]
I might add at this point that we are providing all relevant information we can.

[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.700]
Good. What's your take?

[01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:11.660]
Have them convince that it's justified 105 28 percent all for it. Let's roll.

[01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:16.260]
87 23.1 percent just change it again. Don't you just hate that?

[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:21.580]
I'm stronger against it 84 22 percent. I support it but I'm nervous about it 54.

[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:25.480]
Let's take care of North Korea first 35 and don't know 12.

[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:28.400]
12 people are still looking on the map. Where is Iraq?

[01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.380]
Isn't it the Iranians who live in Iraq?

[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:32.260]
Oh yeah.

[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:37.200]

you bastard you

[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:50.860]
cut the crap log just cut it out a kid stop 1045 at 560 WQM Center is calling Paul on there

[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:56.660]
and they can claim that nothing was there and the inspectors can look all they want

[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:01.160]
and they will find nothing this effort to hide things from the inspectors is not

[01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:07.320]
wanted to isolate at events quite the contrary this is part and parcel of a policy of a

[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:13.900]
vision and deception that goes back 12 years a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime

[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:19.720]
we know that Sodom Hussein has what is called quote a higher committee for monitoring the

[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:26.120]
inspection teams unquote think about that Iraq has a high level committee to monitor the

[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:31.740]
inspectors who were sent into monitor or acts disarmament not to cooperate with them not to

[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:37.420]
assist them but to spy on them and keep them from doing their jobs the committee reports directly

[01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:43.120]
to Sodom do you realize how juvenile is how ridiculous it is yeah I do is there any country in the

[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.720]
world of any substance of any significance that we couldn't find weapons of what we would call

[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:55.520]
mass destruction and for bitten debutations right so on that john rap report writes a few things to

[01:22:55.520 --> 01:22:58.960]
keep in mind when Paul addresses the when to make the US case for war gets to rack which he's

[01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:03.340]
doing right now i'm worried Paul is being sent in to carry the water he's done this before he

[01:23:03.340 --> 01:23:07.420]
gives the impression of a man of great conscience and then he takes his orders that's his role in the

[01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:11.600]
stage play he's the good guy who wins up doing what everybody else does he just agonizes beforehand

[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.780]
people think hey a Paul is on the team they must be right because he was against them a few months

[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:21.020]
ago sure there are supermarkets on the sun too meanwhile hands blisters denied Paul's claims that

[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:24.840]
the weapons inspectors are finding evidence of the Iraqis moving and hiding illicit materials

[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:28.920]
blitz says he's found no conclusive evidence that Iraqi weapons scientists have been taken out

[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:32.760]
of the country to escape interviewers blitz denies that Iraqi agents are pertain to be weapon

[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.580]
scientists he also denies that his weapons inspection team has been infiltrated by Iraqi agents

[01:23:37.580 --> 01:23:42.060]
bush and the state of the union message asserted both of these claims blitz also says he

[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:46.980]
seen no proof that Iraqi al-Qaeda are connected rumors are swirling of some smoking gun that's

[01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.660]
going to be carried out in the open by Paul or bush at the last moment before during the

[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:54.120]
address today although he's already said he's not they couldn't find one and NSA intercept a

[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:58.780]
C.A. document a photo whatever news weeks already running caught on tape hold your hat we've got it

[01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.880]
the only thing that it was running transcripts a couple of minutes ago he started speaking

[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:08.200]
where you got a couple of people speaking in Iraqi in the Arabic and talking kaka right

[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:14.100]
what they say something about al-Bundi yeah that's what they said al-Bundi did it

[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:18.120]
towel will do one of these numbers we didn't want to release this tape because it could cost

[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.060]
the lives of agents deep inside Iraq but we flew these people out last night to a Sheraton hotel

[01:24:22.060 --> 01:24:26.280]
of their choice so we can tell the world what is really happening hello George Orwell it says

[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.420]
there you go this is all part of the dog and pony show that's going on i don't even know why

[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:36.660]
they're wasting their time they already got the troops over there but i've been just get it done okay

[01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:41.020]
if you're gonna do it get it done it's a formality to make it look nice i see wrap it up in a bow

[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:46.800]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and for ice law me got to put this on

[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.060]
there but all they possibly can but i don't think i want to do you all the channels are carrying it

[01:24:52.060 --> 01:24:56.100]
yeah anybody wants to see it they can turn on anywhere in fact even if you if you stick your finger

[01:24:56.100 --> 01:25:00.140]
in your pop-up toaster you'll see coal and pollen there going by sources like that i feel really

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:04.100]

[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:10.600]
and track hasn't said that yet how do you know i'm wondering i have i'm keeping one eye on it

[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.340]
wq i m

[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:14.620]

[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.380]
yeah you do it okay

[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:20.380]
and quit listen i don't mind your position on on in the war and so forth and so on

[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:24.900]
well thank you so much hello i said thank you so much you don't mind i'm

[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:27.980]
i'd be you could not be so biased when you quoted a little while ago

[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:31.920]
Washington Times article you said it was ultra conservative and so forth then you read it

[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:36.440]
in New York Times article you don't state the same thing as ultra liberal be obvious and be

[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:41.620]
be obvious if you're gonna say you know that you don't understand why i don't have

[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:45.440]
i don't have to look in your crap if you're gonna say everybody knows out there New York Times

[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.720]
has got a reputation as a very liberal the ultra liberal comedy pinko on newspaper so what's

[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.980]
the point what's the difference i have to draw you a diagram if you're that stupid what do you

[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:58.280]
call the show for give me directions if you're gonna say this if you're gonna say that i don't mind

[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:01.780]
well i don't really give a crap whether you mind or not because i'm gonna give my opinion it's

[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:07.500]
funny or a s how do you like that it's funny you're being a little punk with a tiny penis what's

[01:26:07.500 --> 01:26:14.800]
like here god i'm gonna hold a bag with a tiny penis never stop me from saying my opinion five six seven

[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:19.720]
oh five sixty pound five there you go George i'd only reason i mention the Washington Times is

[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.780]
the point being that it's hardly a liberal or that that's always what we're getting thrown back at us

[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:27.400]
when you're reading stuff from all these little publications and the Washington Times is anything

[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:32.080]
but that you mentioned because it was an exception right exactly that is absolutely correct sir

[01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:35.700]
and he's too stupid it was too stupid to understand it he would know the Washington Times if they

[01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:41.520]
stuck 14 copies up his ass and the prince started coming out both ears but he doesn't mind your

[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:45.840]
position well i'm delighted i'm sitting in the prone position right now i'm laying down from

having a committee to justify 133 strongly against it 122 so right there is 52.7 percent all for it

[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:06.720]
let's roll 108 22.3 percent i supported but i'm nervous about it 63 13 percent let's take care

[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:13.580]
of north korea for it 41 8.4 percent don't know 16 3.3 percent so if you combine all for it let's

[01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:16.880]
roll and i support it but i'm nervous about it and give them the benefit of the doubt that's 35

[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.460]
percent so at 65 the 35 you know what the national polls have all been shown last the few days

[01:40:22.460 --> 01:40:28.680]
i give up two thirds opposed 66 to 33 oh that's too liberal it's almost exactly the same

[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:34.040]
when they asked to pull on CNN was it two weeks ago that i told you about who do they agree with

[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:39.340]
whose position they agree with more on a rack ted kennedy or president bush 75 percent agreed

[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:43.600]
with kennedy and 25 percent push now we certainly know it is country 75 percent of the public

[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:50.500]
is very very far politically from ted kennedy very very far but i'm that particular issue was three

[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:57.280]
to one you're just landing the poll you hateful thing we miss a little speck and by the way speaking

[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.600]

[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.000]

this is first-hand information of biological weapons plants on wheels see that and there's

[01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:54.760]
a drawing of one it goes with their meals on wheels hmm how long do you think it will take the

[01:42:54.760 --> 01:43:00.880]
inspectors to find even one of these eighteen trucks without a rack coming forward as they are

[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.880]
supposed to with the information hey give us the evidence that we need to go to work capabilities

[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:11.940]

[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:20.600]
he's here to figure out i'm okay hey listen i you know maybe maybe i'm just a little fearful of war

[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:27.780]
in general but uh isn't Venezuela kind of a threat to i mean think of it they've got oil and

[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:31.800]
they've got gold and they're like you know the same hemisphere as that and a banana republic to

[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:36.400]
have it all off yeah are they kind of a potential risk i mean how do you pick and choose who you go

[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:40.780]
blow up well cash there's only 90 miles away from wherever sitting right now he's certainly a threat

[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:46.160]
yeah there's a lack of resources let's see things are way the catapult bananas 90 miles you know

[01:43:46.160 --> 01:43:49.360]
how do we know he gave all those nukes back during the missile crisis how do we know that he doesn't

[01:43:49.360 --> 01:43:54.140]
have biological weapons because the others people believe he that he does yeah i know i know

[01:43:54.140 --> 01:43:58.620]
i guess so how do any of us sleep at night i mean you know well let me say like i said yesterday

[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:03.220]
the Soviet Union had just as many when there was a Soviet Union just as many nuclear weapons as we

[01:44:03.220 --> 01:44:07.480]
did when an arms race was going on during the Cold War and yet somehow we're still here today which

[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:14.120]
means we somehow found a way even dealing with crazy people to coexist because peaceful coexistence

[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.540]
as as uh made an ambie pambi as it may sound that's the only way the planet's gonna keep spinning around

[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:21.500]
hate to break the news to all these hawks out there all these people that are rattling their

[01:44:21.500 --> 01:44:24.600]
spears and want to make themselves feel macho that's the only way we're gonna exist

well i i'm sorry maybe i'm jaded because i'm getting up in years like you but you know what it

[01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:37.080]
seems like the saber rattling always intensifies around the election that dies down uh i'm sorry i've

[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:41.160]
never bought this whole thing i think he's trying to fix what his daddy didn't take care of a

[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:46.460]
long time ago and i think daddy started it back then because the election too i just don't buy

[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:51.880]
the whole thing i sure it shouldn't work out to did it no sure didn't i guess like most bushes he

oh you didn't say gold in a retriever wrong

[01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:37.500]
nobody qa n how you doing okay sir hey uh all this the nil is just a bunch of

[01:48:37.500 --> 01:48:41.220]
propaganda to change the subject we're in serious economic trouble

[01:48:41.220 --> 01:48:45.300]
with all the trade agreements with naphtha and gatton so on a five hundred

[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.660]
billion dollar trade deficit for the next two years whether it's the democrats

[01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:52.740]
or the republicans they're gonna be giving giving rattling the saber to change

[01:48:52.740 --> 01:48:56.720]
the subject because we're going into a severe recession depression and this

[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.460]
is about changing the subject and what happens if uh... satan decides if he's

[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:03.220]
got his back who is well he decides to uh

[01:49:03.220 --> 01:49:06.880]
have an incendiary event in all the Iraqi world fields which they they they

[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.080]
feel that he's already planted them

[01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:13.840]
explosive explosives uh... all the world feels there at least two thousand of them

[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:18.000]
well this is possible but it's over eighty ninety percent of our people do not

[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:21.440]
trust our government and our government meeting what's gonna happen to the

[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.460]
economy if he does that in the world also i think this serious problem with that

[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:28.480]
but that's not going to take the economy down with all these trade

[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:32.480]
agreements uh... we're in big big trouble and they're going to use the iraq

[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.520]
just as they use the nine eleven to blame the economy and we're going to

[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.480]
undo into a depression and they're going to use nine eleven and iraq and or

[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:44.520]
north korea as an excuse for this recession depression just remember what

[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:47.140]
just remember what happened with tricklebound economics the first time in the

[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:50.020]
early eighties under reagan that they all rave about give us another recession

[01:49:50.020 --> 01:49:54.080]
depression same thing because it doesn't work it's it's uh... as George bush said

[01:49:54.080 --> 01:49:57.420]
the senior herber walker voodoo economics remember he called that way right

[01:49:57.420 --> 01:50:01.240]
against reagan but you're missing the big picture when we went when we have

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:05.220]
with all these trade agreements with mexico and china uh... you know this this

[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:09.660]
was a democrat uh... equipment or and in a republican congress they gave it to

[01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:14.960]
us both parties gave it to us amen because they both suck thank you and have a

[01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:18.500]
great day you too all the new year so parties and yeah i think they both

[01:50:18.500 --> 01:50:21.180]
suck that's how part is not how how many years have i been saying that that

[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:24.740]
the democratic party is only useful for one thing and that is being a buffer

[01:50:24.740 --> 01:50:29.380]
but as far as being productive or being uh... uh... positive forget about it

[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:32.240]
forget about it because most of them are controlled by the same special interest

[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:33.520]
to control the republicans

[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:37.640]
feel says i admire your ability to not get so emotional about political issues

[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.240]
i listen to both sides of the iraq issue and i'm uh...

[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:44.500]
amazed how hysterical the right wingers get they're the poster children for

[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:48.020]
hypocrisy as evident by your recent callers i've been listening to call her

legitimize george's war plans and the two monaheeral chunks he wants sterile chunks

[01:50:56.540 --> 01:50:56.980]

nobody wants to really see that they're putting their watch in oil because there's nothing

[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:02.040]
saying you know here's the proof and whether we can whether you believe it or not we're going

[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:06.340]
to go in anyway statement what's the point another dog in pony show just like they did with

[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:10.660]
airport security remember i kept talking with the dog in pony show and then he find it box cutters

where we safe no we're just lucky as hell we haven't had more crap going on yet yet and it seems

[01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:31.180]
to me and of course don't forget it was George teneth the director the c i who said

[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:36.980]
going to happen not a question of if it's just a question of when it's going to happen it's

[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:40.600]
going to be bad and we're going to take all of these resources we got all of these troops over

[01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:47.280]
there the Middle East again for war on Iraq while we're reading at the same time that al-Qaeda is

[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:52.260]
like reorganizing are we done in Afghanistan by the way we don't know and let me say this to you

[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:56.200]
too at the risk of sounding insensitive because it pisses me off okay because as far as i'm concerned

[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:00.520]
one american life is just as valuable one human life is just as valuable as anybody else's

[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.840]
and how about all the american troops that have lost their lives over there in Afghanistan in

[01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:09.660]
q weight we're getting shot and killed by these barbarians almost every day how come we don't see

[01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:14.020]
them on television and hear all of their names and about their families and who the hell they were

[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:18.860]
right and since we don't have this draft all of them obviously volunteer to serve their countries

[01:55:18.860 --> 01:55:21.840]
of their obviously heroes how come we don't hear a hell of a lot more about them

[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.960]
i'm not trying to downplay the you know the sadness of the thing with the astronauts who had to be

[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.940]
human sacrifices too because nasi didn't have the fun to do the proper things in the space shuttle

[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.640]
and now more and more ask kind of like leaking out like the article we started to show with today

[01:55:36.380 --> 01:55:39.860]
they were human sacrifice just like the schoolteacher and that crew on the

[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:47.200]
challenger scientists begged them warned them the old rings if they get too cold if they're out

[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.980]
there and freezing temperatures it's tremendous danger there's a good chance that the thing will blow

[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:53.880]
up guess what they left it because the timing they had to get it done

[01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.240]
for the state of the union address oh is that the one with the schoolteacher

[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:08.320]
remember mommy five six seven oh five sixty very very sad very sad how few people can think

[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:12.940]
for themselves in this country yes and if somebody says oh look at that oh there's a tube though

[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:18.000]
that there are differences of opinion there is controversy about what these tubes are for well

[01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.740]

No, don't read no stupid books.

[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:23.080]
All the world is blue, seeing the facts of our ancient ways.

[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:29.960]
Everybody's earning five years, like us USA.

[02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:35.680]
Love the 33 and 560 W. Kim and my on to them or am I on to them?

[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.400]
What did I say to you before I checked out their website free republic.com?

[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:43.200]
I said, looks like the creepers around our pool all of a sudden because all of a sudden,

[02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:44.860]
right to the top, went,

[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:46.760]
I'm all for war with Iraq, let's roll.

[02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:49.060]
And I mean, it just doesn't happen that way.

[02:00:49.140 --> 02:00:50.580]
It doesn't work. We've been doing these too long.

[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:52.700]
That's why I click on free republic.com.

[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.880]
Did you say free republic.com?

[02:00:55.220 --> 02:00:59.280]
I click hop right in where it says there on your home page, on your front page.

[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:01.760]
And I hop right in about halfway down on the first page.

[02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.700]
Neo Rogers, which they can't even spell right.

[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:05.320]
Can you get it right? There's no D in my name.

[02:01:05.420 --> 02:01:08.300]
Okay, D is in dumb and dangerous and paranoid.

[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:10.840]
Isn't paranoid at the end of the deal with the D?

[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:13.780]
Yes. Neo Rogers pool. Let's creep it.

[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:15.980]
And then they got our website and so on.

[02:01:16.340 --> 02:01:18.380]
And with three comments. Let's see what the comments are.

[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:22.120]
Okay. So what we're going to have to do, Eric, is we're going to have to put commentary to a disqualify.

[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:29.280]
You might want to put some note on our website that we were aware of the fact that free republic.com is creeping and distorting our pool today.

[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:33.080]
He's creeped this pool. He's ripping bush today.

[02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:35.360]
Oh, let's see anything else.

[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.260]
Freed this pool. Yaddi, yaddi, yaddi.

[02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:41.000]
Am I the only one who hasn't heard of Neo Rogers?

[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.500]
Somebody, well, I had to do it.

[02:01:42.520 --> 02:01:44.000]
And this guy's spelled it right.

[02:01:45.240 --> 02:01:46.460]
He has a good guy.

[02:01:46.740 --> 02:01:48.620]
Neo rips W each and every day.

[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:51.740]
What a shock. He's funny about once every three weeks.

[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:55.080]
Oh, well, that's good. I'll let you know what you're going to be.

[02:01:56.160 --> 02:01:58.540]
Dolly creep, but it needs help right somebody else.

[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.620]
As the creepers are organizing, they're going to get all their right fingers.

[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.860]
They're going to get together and they're going to vote.

[02:02:03.260 --> 02:02:04.120]
And you know what?

[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:06.440]
Disqualify.

[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:11.920]
Anytime we can discover that our pool is being distorted and freaked by people extremist on any of any of them,

[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:13.640]
no matter what the issue is, they're disqualifying.

[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.120]
Okay? So cut the crap.

[02:02:16.260 --> 02:02:18.420]
You just wasting your time free republic.com.

[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.480]
All you creepers, creeper, creeper, jeepers, creepers, I think it's the creepers.

[02:02:23.120 --> 02:02:23.740]
Hey, Bokemon.

[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:26.020]
Yeah, there's a good bit for you.

[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.380]
Cheepers, creepers, we're getting the creepers.

[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.260]
And they're just barely in first place, by the way.

[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:31.820]
So everybody else vote 10 times.

[02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:34.880]
Everybody else who doesn't agree with this, sir.

[02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:37.900]
And this is so sad, like I said, it's like a bunch of little children.

[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:42.480]
They have to alert each other that there's actually somebody on there giving an alternate point of view.

[02:02:42.820 --> 02:02:43.540]
As if.

[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:46.560]
Coming, what the, like, what impact have we got?

[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:50.720]
And people are coming on their voting who don't even know who the hell I am.

[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.140]
Don't know me from a banana.

[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:56.660]
Much less have any idea what the show is all about.

[02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:59.640]
We are looking a little jaundous lately.

[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:01.180]
Yeah, I feel a little jaundous.

[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.340]
About using such devices.

[02:03:03.340 --> 02:03:05.480]
Well, maybe that's what did it.

[02:03:05.500 --> 02:03:07.300]
Huh? Maybe I had it too deep in my head.

[02:03:07.420 --> 02:03:07.820]
I don't know.

[02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:09.760]
600 made votes.

[02:03:09.800 --> 02:03:11.080]
What's your take on what were the wreck?

[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.160]
I'm all for it.

[02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:13.960]
Let's roll 163.

[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:15.160]
26.28%.

[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:15.400]
But.

[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:18.140]
Better put that warning up on Eric.

[02:03:18.140 --> 02:03:22.020]
The one about how they were every vote that there is helping our fund our gay agenda.

[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:24.760]
So they're in a real catch 22.

[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:26.780]
They're really boxed in here on this thing now.

[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:30.180]
Every time they, every time they log on there, every time we get another hit on their website.

[02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.780]
It's helping the fund our what Eric calls our gay agenda.

[02:03:33.660 --> 02:03:34.020]
Yeah.

[02:03:35.200 --> 02:03:37.040]
All for a let's roll 163.

[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:39.360]
Have them admit convinced it justified 151.

[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:41.080]
Strongly against it 146.

[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:42.860]
I support it, but I'm nervous about it.

[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:43.240]
83.

[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:45.120]
Let's take care of North Korea first.

[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:45.680]
Oh, right.

[02:03:46.020 --> 02:03:46.380]
48.

[02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:47.200]
And don't know.

[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:48.200]
17.

[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:52.060]
Boy, well, I'm telling you it's scary.

[02:03:52.300 --> 02:03:53.460]
What's going on with this country today?

[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:54.180]
Just a scary.

[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:55.580]
I mean, you know, polls are polls.

[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:56.620]
Don't have all that much significance.

[02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:03.180]
But this paranoid and the andrthal group of right wingers, man, everything is going to be just according to oil.

[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:04.280]
And nobody can say this.

[02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:05.820]
And nobody can talk about condolese.

[02:04:05.980 --> 02:04:07.840]
And certainly nobody can criticize cold and powel.

[02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:11.660]
And nobody can criticize W or rumsfeld or chaney or any of these people.

[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:15.240]
And what, when did we, is that part of the USA Patriot Act?

[02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:15.980]
Is it say that in there?

[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:16.700]
Yes.

[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:17.060]
Oh.

[02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:19.440]
Is that kind of when we rolled back the first amendment?

[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:22.180]
It's part of that manifesto that nobody seems to be able to talk about.

[02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:23.640]
Oh, the right wing manifesto.

[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:24.320]
I forgot about that.

[02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:26.120]
And you know what else I forgot to work this morning?

[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.100]
My hip-food.

[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:28.540]
I will learn.

[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:31.740]
Oh, there it is.

[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:33.340]
Eric is putting them on notice.

[02:04:33.700 --> 02:04:35.520]
Please feel free to free our pool.

[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:37.500]
The proceeds help to fund our agenda.

[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:39.580]
A real dilemma, isn't it?

[02:04:40.040 --> 02:04:43.260]
Or as we say north of the border, a real dilemma, a light.

[02:04:43.420 --> 02:04:44.620]
Oh, it's big of that maple leaf, sir.

[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.860]
A little message for Pat Quinn.

[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.520]
I know you guys, you down here for a few days, the All Star Break.

[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:50.880]
Probably played a lot of golf.

[02:04:51.900 --> 02:04:53.580]
And maybe show up tonight would be good.

[02:04:53.640 --> 02:04:55.580]
Okay, we very nice to be actually showed up and played a game.

[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:57.900]
As opposed to what often happens, you know.

[02:04:59.160 --> 02:05:01.440]
Get lulled and like, eh, we're not really into it.

[02:05:01.580 --> 02:05:02.340]
Just go through the motions.

[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:03.120]
We don't want to see that.

[02:05:03.180 --> 02:05:04.180]
Okay, us maple leaf fans.

[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:05.940]
We want to see a real ass kick in game tonight.

[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:07.700]
And we don't want to see no Trevor kid in there.

[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:09.120]
We want Eddie DeBiegel in there tonight.

[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:10.680]
Okay, I just mentioned that in passing, Pat.

[02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:13.340]
Maybe my friends Joe and Harriet will pass that along to you.

[02:05:14.060 --> 02:05:16.140]
Certainly now, rumor, he's probably getting a free lunch right now.

[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:20.800]
So the freepers are on our case again today.

[02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:21.400]
Isn't that a shame?

[02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:24.260]
Don't you feel like, ugh, unclean?

[02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:27.220]
He's ripping bush today.

[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:28.260]
Oh my god.

[02:05:28.840 --> 02:05:32.020]
I wonder how come, if we, how come we don't play all those built Clinton periodies,

[02:05:32.080 --> 02:05:33.240]
they never got excited about that.

[02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.440]
Oh, they got excited about it.

[02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:39.020]
At least, at least they admit I'm funny about once every three weeks.

[02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:39.660]
Well, that's good.

[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:41.300]
Could you put that on the calendar for us?

[02:05:42.600 --> 02:05:43.440]
March 15th.

[02:05:43.440 --> 02:05:44.740]
Right around the eyes of March.

[02:05:44.920 --> 02:05:45.440]
Did you say March?

[02:05:46.480 --> 02:05:48.760]
Yeah, March right down the Hershey highway.

[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.880]
22 till noon.

[02:05:50.880 --> 02:05:52.020]
Colin Powell still go.

[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.400]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[02:05:53.580 --> 02:05:55.480]
Yeah, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:57.800]
He's still marching on bag.

[02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:58.900]
He's got the bag, dad.

[02:05:59.600 --> 02:06:01.180]
Hey, I'll tell you a place where they got the great food.

[02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:02.000]
And that's Flores Pizza.

[02:06:02.080 --> 02:06:03.340]
They've been there about 700 years.

[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:06.720]
While almost every other business in that neck of the woods has gone, bye-bye.

[02:06:07.600 --> 02:06:09.140]
And we did all that talk about that.

[02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:11.540]
It's just amazing how many businesses have come and gone.

[02:06:11.780 --> 02:06:15.580]
There was juniors like across the street, and there was like all of the sunny market.

[02:06:16.500 --> 02:06:17.380]
All of those things.

[02:06:17.960 --> 02:06:19.020]
And most of them are just gone.

[02:06:19.200 --> 02:06:21.200]
But Flores is still there, and the food is better than ever.

[02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:22.460]
Nothing comes out of the can.

[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:24.700]
It's all fresh, and you'll taste the difference when you pop it in your post.

[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:27.380]
The freshly made dough, the sauce, the freshly baked garlic rolls,

[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.180]
which they bake right there every day at Flores.

[02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:33.340]
The portions are gigantic, and they use more cheese and meats on their pies than anyone in town.

[02:06:33.460 --> 02:06:35.380]
I love it when that cheese is oozing all over the place.

[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:38.340]
You'll be fighting for that last slice of pizza if it's from Flores.

[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:40.140]
Don't take our word for it. Find out for yourself.

[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:42.560]
Go to 731 North East, 79th Street, I'm...

[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:43.780]
Oh, no, just off this cane and pulled apart.

[02:06:44.180 --> 02:06:46.200]
That's 79th just a couple of eight streets east.

[02:06:47.040 --> 02:06:48.640]
Locks east of this cane, right?

[02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.760]
Well, we haven't been there in so long, I mean, I'd remember the bridge tender.

[02:06:52.040 --> 02:06:55.320]
Or call Flores at 305-758-5351.

[02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:59.520]
That's 305-758-5351, and they'll deliver for you.

[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:03.020]
They'll deliver from 34th and the cane all the way to 135th and the cane.

[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:05.420]
They'll go to Quasai, the cricket club, the Jockey Club.

[02:07:05.700 --> 02:07:09.000]
Flores even delivers as far west as 12th Avenue east of Collins in 71st.

[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:11.160]
If you're nice to a little duty when you call by the way,

[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:12.780]
she'll tell you about the great pizza specials.

[02:07:12.840 --> 02:07:16.260]
Like 1399 for large cheese, pie, liter of soda, and six delicious chicken wings,

[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:18.040]
all of these things, only 1399.

[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:23.480]
Call Flores at some of the best-trial and date county call 305-758-5351.

[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:27.520]
305-758-5351, and tell them that Fatneel told you to call.

[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:30.020]
And I'm at law.

[02:07:30.540 --> 02:07:32.480]
This is 420-560.

[02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:33.880]
You way up.

[02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:36.860]
You fudge back up.

[02:07:41.120 --> 02:07:46.760]
I'd remember all those happy days, those sunny days of just three years ago.

[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:48.400]
Yes.

[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:55.840]
All my stops just kept on rising, and I kept on fantasizing about that good.

[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:04.360]
Then along came number 43, just like that, my stops began to slide.

[02:08:07.180 --> 02:08:13.480]
I don't like to throw no blame around, but it looks like Georgie took me for a ride.

[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:20.880]
Sing GW's Bush and I'm mixed, surprise, side economic blues.

[02:08:24.260 --> 02:08:30.220]
There's a need to make you feel good from your head down to the holes in your shoes.

[02:08:32.660 --> 02:08:37.860]
Join your friends and neighbors, hell you ain't got nothing to do.

[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:47.060]
Sing GW's Bush and I'm mixed, surprise, side economic blues.

[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:52.060]
How about those folks that end wrong?

[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.780]
Man, they really took a good big time.

[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:04.620]
And we don't forget those accountants, guys, what they did with the numbers, it's a cry.

[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:13.780]
And all those other companies left all their employees high and dry.

[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:21.920]
It just ain't the good old American weed, and almost makes a grown man want to cry.

[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:29.480]
Sing GW's Bush and I'm mixed, surprise, side economic blues.

[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:55.440]
Sing GW's Bush and I'm mixed, surprise, side economic blues.

[02:09:56.900 --> 02:09:58.320]
Let's go, Muriel Lucky.

[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:05.060]
And those billion-dollar dividend tax cut proposals, that's a stretch.

[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:12.880]
For the country and our economy, please somebody tell me what's good.

[02:10:15.820 --> 02:10:21.540]
It caught about the real world, you'd have to say, oh, Georgie, you got to kill.

[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:30.140]
No way, let's just send him back to Texas, with his trickle down, and he'll sneak an armic blue.

[02:10:30.900 --> 02:10:37.940]
By my control, Singy, W's Bush, and Armick's, supply side economic blue.

[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.020]
Bye, bye, bye!

[02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:47.820]
Guaranteed to make you feel good from your head down to the holes of your shoes.

[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:55.200]
Yeah, join your friends and neighbors, hell you ain't got nothing to do.

[02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:04.120]
Singy, W's Bush and Armick's, supply side economic blue.

[02:11:06.220 --> 02:11:08.680]
Come on, Muriel, let's all sing.

[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:15.180]
Singy, W's Bush and Armick's, supply side economic blue.

[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.980]
I'm dying on the hair.

[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:24.660]
And you'll make you feel good from your head down to the holes of your shoes.

[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:32.400]
Yeah, join your friends and neighbors, hell you ain't got nothing to do.

[02:11:35.740 --> 02:11:41.000]
Singy, W's Bush and Armick's, supply side economic blue.

[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.780]
Singy, W's Bush and Armick's, supply side economic blue.

[02:11:54.020 --> 02:12:00.620]
And like I said, it was Daddy, George Herbert Walker Bush, M-O-R-O-N, who called that supply side economic

[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:03.320]
that trickled down theory voodoo economics.

[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:04.140]
Remember that?

[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:04.780]
I remember.

[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:06.880]
Just like it was only 10 years ago, 20 years ago.

[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:14.800]
56670560, 0.560 on EAT and T and Verizon Line, the freebers at free republic.com are working not so

[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.500]
feversly anymore.

[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:17.860]
I guess maybe they're trying to get their spelling right?

[02:12:18.980 --> 02:12:23.040]
To show you what about your rocket scientists, they put the big red headline there on the stories that you should really

[02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:23.860]
breathlessly look at.

[02:12:23.940 --> 02:12:24.560]
Let's creep this up.

[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:28.400]
Neil Rogers with the D, which of course is misspelled even Roy and Dale know that.

[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:33.680]
And then if you look beneath it where they've got the link to the website, there's the correct spelling of the website.

[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:35.300]
Otherwise it wouldn't go that way.

[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:35.920]
Well, otherwise it wouldn't go that way.

[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:36.200]
Yeah.

[02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:38.440]
I understand that, but it is.

[02:12:39.080 --> 02:12:39.700]
I know.

[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:40.460]
Oh boy.

[02:12:42.160 --> 02:12:44.640]
56670560, 0.560 on EAT and T line.

[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:46.320]
And Colin Powell is still rolling.

[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:49.160]
Colin, it should be a subject of deep and continuing concern.

[02:12:49.380 --> 02:12:49.540]
Good.

[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:51.860]
WQAM.

[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:54.620]
WQAM.

[02:12:55.060 --> 02:12:56.060]
My bonds are blue.

[02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:58.220]
WQAM.

[02:12:58.700 --> 02:12:59.060]
No.

[02:12:59.860 --> 02:13:01.340]
Okay, they're all out today in force.

[02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:02.400]
WQAM.

[02:13:02.700 --> 02:13:03.620]
Hey, yes sir.

[02:13:03.740 --> 02:13:04.060]
How are you?

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:04.440]
Okay.

[02:13:04.700 --> 02:13:10.320]
Hey, I have a concern and the concern is that your show is turning more into a the Randy Rhodes show.

[02:13:10.420 --> 02:13:10.820]
No, it's not.

[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:11.420]
Yes, it is.

[02:13:11.480 --> 02:13:11.840]
No, it's not.

[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:14.200]
Oh, that's the other conversation.

[02:13:14.620 --> 02:13:14.720]
Huh?

[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:15.900]
I think that was him again.

[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:17.180]
I see.

[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:18.840]
See, you know what really gets me?

[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:23.060]
And you people are as transparent as a paint of glass when I was doing the bedtime stories.

[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:26.180]
Any member of this business we used to discuss whether the audience liked it.

[02:13:26.300 --> 02:13:26.740]
They didn't like it.

[02:13:26.980 --> 02:13:28.060]
No, no, don't do this.

[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:30.220]
It's too political and you're too critical of the present.

[02:13:30.540 --> 02:13:39.600]
And all that is a not even thinly veiled, totally unveiled, a naked attempt to try to dissuade me from expressing an adult alternative point of view.

[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:41.060]
This ain't the Randy Rhodes show.

[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.480]
We got more people listening in five minutes than she's had ever since she's been on here put together.

[02:13:44.660 --> 02:13:44.820]
Okay.

[02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:45.540]
Who are you kidding?

[02:13:46.120 --> 02:13:48.500]
This isn't light bulb radio and that's what disturbs you.

[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.440]
And if it's turning into something you don't like, anybody with a brain would turn it off.

[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:57.940]
That's all you're trying to do is do everything in your power if you can't get me off the air which you can't and won't.

[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.140]
If you can't do that, try to make them go back just to being as simple as it all.

[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:03.220]
Well, you know we're trying to do a balance like we always have.

[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:05.080]
Lot of fun, lot of funny stuff.

[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:07.420]
Give people a few laughs, but also have something to say.

[02:14:07.660 --> 02:14:10.000]
Something different from the same swill, the same repetitions.

[02:14:10.320 --> 02:14:14.900]
Loved it out there, a ditto head craft, the year nonstop 24 hours a day, around the clock at every station in America.

[02:14:16.660 --> 02:14:19.740]
And then if you think that has any impact on us, blow it out your ass.

[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:20.300]
It doesn't.

[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:22.320]
Has no impact on anybody.

[02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:26.140]
They're like a bunch of naked people running up and down the street.

[02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:28.720]
WQAM.

[02:14:29.180 --> 02:14:30.680]
Yeah, have a request please.

[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:32.440]
WQAM.

[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:33.720]
Hey, steady.

[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:35.600]
WQAM.

[02:14:36.380 --> 02:14:37.880]
Great ball of the fire.

[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:39.520]
WQAM.

[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:40.760]
A meal.

[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:41.500]
Yes sir.

[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.340]
As far as the Iraq situation is concerned, we don't respect your opinion.

[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:47.460]
We just can't do United States.

[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:54.080]
We can't sit around and wait for the inspectors to go around going from place to place to find things.

[02:14:54.820 --> 02:14:57.580]
The Middle East hates us, no matter what we do.

[02:14:57.800 --> 02:15:01.740]
If we restrain from doing it, if we do what we're going to do, then there's still going to hate us just as much.

[02:15:02.240 --> 02:15:03.160]
Well, let me ask you this.

[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:04.040]
Wait a minute.

[02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:04.840]
Wait a minute.

[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:07.220]
The Middle East hates us and what's the rest of that?

[02:15:07.740 --> 02:15:10.200]
Well, the Middle East hates us as well, no matter what we do.

[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:14.620]
So in other words, if you're going there and start dropping bombs on Iraq, the Middle East is going to like us a lot.

[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:16.400]
It doesn't matter.

[02:15:17.020 --> 02:15:18.600]
There's no compromise in those people.

[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:19.620]
So let me say this.

[02:15:20.800 --> 02:15:23.020]
Assuming your argument is correct, OK?

[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:25.520]
Assuming you're absolutely right for the sake of argument.

[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:34.580]
Now why should we risk the lives of all of those thousands and thousands of military people, those young people, Americans, and all the millions of people over there with whom we have no quarrel?

[02:15:34.680 --> 02:15:36.340]
The people that bagged that are our enemies.

[02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:38.500]
Well, we don't know that for sure.

[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:41.840]
Well, we don't know that for sure.

[02:15:41.840 --> 02:15:42.540]
So what should we do?

[02:15:42.680 --> 02:15:43.740]
Kill all of them and set it up.

[02:15:43.740 --> 02:15:45.400]
Right, but now we've got a better idea.

[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:46.740]
Now, that was a great concept.

[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.980]
We don't know for sure who are, you know, which people are the enemy.

[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:52.360]
So let's just kill everybody else.

[02:15:53.100 --> 02:15:54.160]
Let God sort them out.

[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:55.100]
Let God sort it out.

[02:15:55.180 --> 02:15:57.620]
Let's just, if we got all those nukes, they're just sitting there gathering dust.

[02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.800]
Let's just use them all, OK?

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.120]
If you don't use it, you lose it.

[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:04.740]
And let's carry this imperialistic thing to the ultimate.

[02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:06.740]
Let's just blow up the whole world, kill everybody else.

[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:08.820]
That's a good reason to go to war too, because they don't like us.

[02:16:08.880 --> 02:16:10.660]
Right, they don't like us.

[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:12.580]
I see.

[02:16:12.580 --> 02:16:13.580]
I wonder why.

[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:16.280]
And this is going to make them really love us.

[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:19.780]
Like Connie said, now they will fear you.

[02:16:20.700 --> 02:16:24.060]
I noticed that the Water Notsie did a really interesting job in this break.

[02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:27.760]
But that's OK, because Ponytail is in Broward County in Florida's in Dave.

[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:28.200]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:31.540]
She's got our two wonderful live pizza places back to back.

[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:32.720]
Nice going there, Water Notsie.

[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:33.880]
We know you don't make mistakes.

[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:34.520]
We know that.

[02:16:34.740 --> 02:16:36.680]
Probably too busy with your OJ blowup bell back there.

[02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:39.280]
1152 at 560.

[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:40.560]
I have a feeling I could be wrong.

[02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:42.060]
I have a feeling it's a really good thing.

[02:16:42.140 --> 02:16:43.760]
We got that noon to 1 comedy bit hour coming up.

[02:16:43.940 --> 02:16:47.640]
Give us a nice rest between digest lunch or in a relaxed and enjoyable manner.

[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:51.960]
And you have nothing to fear by the way.

[02:16:51.980 --> 02:16:55.240]
Those of you who are concerned about whether I'm going to continue sitting here

[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:58.620]
reading bedtime stories and trying to save the world from itself on this little

[02:16:58.620 --> 02:16:59.780]
tiny radio station in Miami.

[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:03.580]
You have nothing to worry about because it's a waste of time, like I've said before.

[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:04.760]
Look at the cause we just got.

[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:07.260]
Just listen to the cause we just got.

[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:10.180]
Where are the rest of the thoughtful people?

[02:17:10.340 --> 02:17:13.060]
Are all of the people who are voting on this poll who are strongly against it?

[02:17:13.180 --> 02:17:14.460]
Are they calling?

[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:15.400]
No, no.

[02:17:15.420 --> 02:17:16.020]
Are they ever calling?

[02:17:16.160 --> 02:17:16.300]
No.

[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:19.940]
Of course not because they're all sitting back, which is why politically the country

[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:21.140]
depends on them is swinging so far.

[02:17:21.220 --> 02:17:23.400]
They're right because everybody else is in La La Land.

[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:25.240]
They stole the election away from me.

[02:17:25.340 --> 02:17:26.480]
They stole your government away from me.

[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:27.700]
And you're all back sitting there.

[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:30.620]
And of course, keeping your real busy trying to scrape a few cents together.

[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:31.420]
That helps too.

[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:33.520]
That's part of the game plan.

[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:36.680]
1153 at 560 WQM.

[02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:40.400]
You don't have to have a big budget to go to the pizza loft because their prices are incredibly low.

[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:43.520]
Even Jeff Rimmer could afford to take his whole family there and pay for it.

[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:44.620]
He went too happy about it.

[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:46.800]
But you'll be happy because the food is fresh.

[02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:47.400]
It's delicious.

[02:17:48.120 --> 02:17:49.820]
Every Monday is lasagna night.

[02:17:49.880 --> 02:17:51.540]
Every Tuesday's eggplant night at the pizza loft.

[02:17:51.860 --> 02:17:52.980]
And both locations, by the way.

[02:17:53.200 --> 02:17:55.520]
By one of these dinners on these nights gives the second one for only five bucks.

[02:17:55.860 --> 02:17:59.580]
Every Wednesday, like today, kids eat feet with it else and they can see Jess' famous magic show.

[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.460]
Every Thursday is bike night at the loft.

[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:02.700]
Come on a motorcycle by one dinner.

[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:03.780]
Get the second for half price.

[02:18:03.780 --> 02:18:05.220]
Fresh delicious pasta.

[02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:07.100]
All cooked to order three different kinds of great pizza.

[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:08.640]
The best garlic rolls in the world.

[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:09.820]
They got calzones.

[02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:14.440]
They got seafood chicken, veal, and all kinds of other great Italian dishes that you'll love.

[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:15.940]
You'll find them in the Davy.

[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:18.880]
On the university drive between Gryffin and 595.

[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.900]
For a take-out or delivery there called 954-916-8880.

[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.780]
When you go in there, tell them, you know, Rimmer can't afford it.

[02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:26.460]
Please let him eat in here for free.

[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:28.140]
We don't want to see a grown man cry.

[02:18:28.560 --> 02:18:30.840]
And in plantation, now the brand new pizza loft location.

[02:18:31.120 --> 02:18:33.540]
Right off the corner of Dobriol and Sunrise right behind Walgreens there.

[02:18:33.540 --> 02:18:34.760]
And at a little strip shopping center.

[02:18:35.420 --> 02:18:36.540]
954-382-1999.

[02:18:37.280 --> 02:18:38.480]
For take-out delivery and catering.

[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:40.700]
954-382-1999.

[02:18:40.820 --> 02:18:41.860]
Don't forget that's a brand new one.

[02:18:42.080 --> 02:18:44.400]
The same great food, the same low prices, the same friendly service.

[02:18:44.740 --> 02:18:47.380]
Right behind Walgreens, Navhille and Sunrise in Plantations.

[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:49.260]
Line and local.

[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:51.960]
We're sports radio 560-CUA.

[02:18:52.720 --> 02:18:53.240]
UAM.

[02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.860]
Where are it needed?

[02:18:57.120 --> 02:18:57.920]
12 to 1 hour.

[02:18:58.420 --> 02:18:59.540]
R-W-A-S.

[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:00.860]
Ladies and gentlemen.

[02:19:01.460 --> 02:19:04.000]
If I could offer only one tip for the future.

[02:19:05.500 --> 02:19:08.300]
Act strange and people will leave you alone.

[02:19:09.540 --> 02:19:14.320]
The rest of my advice has no basis more reliable than my own meandering experience.

[02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:21.260]
Put a slinky around your neck and try to walk downstairs backwards headfirst.

[02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.980]
Sit naked in a large bowl of rice crispsies and sing feelings while the kernels go snap crackle and pop.

[02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:33.800]
Go up to a ticket booth and try to stick your head to the hole where they say how much.

[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:36.000]
Lick a stranger.

[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.800]
Tell him you're from Bosnia and you're a country to sign a respect.

[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:42.960]
Take lots of pills.

[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:44.920]
One of them might work.

[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:49.380]
Occasionally ask the stranger if they've heard anything from Lewis.

[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:52.480]
D. Anoying.

[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:57.840]
During an IRS audit, staple the guy's hand to his desk.

[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:01.160]
Moon a funeral.

[02:20:02.600 --> 02:20:05.420]
Play GoFetch with a scene I dawg while he's working.

[02:20:06.800 --> 02:20:10.840]
Run naked through a mall yelling, kill a bees, kill a bees.

[02:20:12.040 --> 02:20:14.580]
Say the word titty without smiling.

[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:19.000]
Try to figure out who said Paulie Shore should star in movies.

[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:23.920]
Don't be surprised if it's the same guy who said John Gacy should work with kids.

[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:30.980]
Ask an old lady if you can carry her groceries and try to make a run for it.

[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:33.980]
Disappear for great lengths of time.

[02:20:35.200 --> 02:20:37.160]
Try to touch your forehead with your tongue.

[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:41.320]
It may not work but many women will appreciate the effort.

[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:47.720]
At a high school reunion tell your old English teacher that your dog's still eating your homework.

[02:20:49.300 --> 02:20:52.680]
Ask Mark McGuire if he'll take a million dollars for one of his bones.

[02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:56.580]
Try to find the secret to caratop success.

[02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:59.780]
Understand your conception was an accident.

[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:04.320]
That your parents got wasted and wanted a few more laughs before they passed out.

[02:21:05.980 --> 02:21:08.360]
Try not to lose your finger in your nose.

[02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:11.840]
Pick up Bob Costas and toss him on the lawn next door.

[02:21:12.420 --> 02:21:15.820]
Go on a car trip with Bob Costas and force him to stay in his car seat.

[02:21:16.540 --> 02:21:18.180]
Try to dribble Bob Costas.

[02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:21.900]
Ask all your friends and family for forgiveness.

[02:21:22.780 --> 02:21:25.980]
Knowing you, you've done some crap that's really pissed them off.

[02:21:26.760 --> 02:21:31.840]
Wish no ill willed anyone, unless you don't like them, then screw them around their own.

[02:21:33.060 --> 02:21:36.880]
Realize anyone who says they're completely happy or completely full of crap.

[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:41.880]
Ask a hell's angel if he's a woman or has he always walked like that.

[02:21:42.740 --> 02:21:46.740]
Understand that there are bad people in the world and you may just be one of them.

[02:21:47.440 --> 02:21:48.920]
Smith and old lady.

[02:21:50.480 --> 02:21:53.540]
Imagine Gomer Pyle in a gay bar trying to get lucky.

[02:21:54.340 --> 02:21:55.860]
Do this without laughing.

[02:21:57.260 --> 02:22:02.520]
Find what's left of your innocence. Understand it. Embrace it. Protect it.

[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:06.360]
And every so often, take it out for a nice nash.

[02:22:07.700 --> 02:22:09.280]
Caron of, not to care.

[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:11.800]
Hung while you eat.

[02:22:13.240 --> 02:22:16.060]
That's strange. And people will leave you alone.

[02:22:18.100 --> 02:22:23.420]
Coming up tonight on Inside of Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music Biography Profile Story,

[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:27.040]
we take it good, hard, stiff look and to start him.

[02:22:27.040 --> 02:22:36.800]
As America's new patriotism takes hold, what better time to reconsider some British girl who thought she had the right to sing a song about our great country?

[02:22:37.420 --> 02:22:40.980]
Yeah, that's right. I'm talking about you, Kim Wilde.

[02:22:46.020 --> 02:22:51.800]
Out like it's time we added the name of Kim Wilde to an ever-growing axis of evil.

[02:22:51.800 --> 02:22:58.760]
President George W. Bush lashed out at Kim Wilde in a recent state of the basic cable celebrity profile address.

[02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:05.660]
There are plenty of fine Americans you could have provided and upbeat but somewhat critical pop tune about our young people.

[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:09.820]
We cannot allow this British import to go unpunished.

[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:17.560]
The president went on to point out that even the singer's follow-up hit, you keep me hanging on, was a remake of an American song.

[02:23:18.120 --> 02:23:22.880]
Look, will you people let me go? I mean, set me free, why don't you?

[02:23:23.160 --> 02:23:27.940]
Tonight, Kim Wilde speaks to us from her wire enclosure at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

[02:23:28.180 --> 02:23:37.060]
I appeal to the United States to realize that having too lousy hits and then disappearing off the radar, it's punishment enough!

[02:23:39.380 --> 02:23:45.420]
Lawyers for the prosecution are prepared to argue that Kim Wilde's music actually punished us back in the 80s.

[02:23:45.420 --> 02:23:51.380]
It's a big, juicy, stopping wet-looking show business tonight, uninside the behind.

[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:22.180]
That pipe smoker ran on psychomsize cute old bedding and gave you the fatal attack!

[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:32.040]
I'm a crazy homophol, not that I mind it but I'm way too old.

[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:42.900]
I fantasize about being in bed and at rest with feet loaded, my man friend, I'll just make up with gender and some day.

[02:24:43.900 --> 02:24:50.580]
And then last one to break my pun, now very nover again.

[02:24:52.380 --> 02:25:07.340]
Though I would not feel the most fooling, and I would not be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union, just born and stroking away.

[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:19.860]
For they kill me you're not my guy, you sound like a nine-year-old kid, only a macho-melling guy.

[02:25:20.220 --> 02:25:21.380]
You don't notice me?

[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:35.600]
That makes me flip my wings, if ginger was a lover of mine, I bury my boldest mainy nose, inside his pimply rear end.

[02:25:37.340 --> 02:25:44.340]
No, I would not be a sport home, if I was not a closet of fame.

[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:52.320]
That's why a ginger and more gay union would make me feel dizzy and gay.

[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:55.020]
Everybody follow my bouts and balls!

[02:25:55.340 --> 02:26:06.160]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union would make my sorrows only as she'll say, if we had a ginger and more gay union,

[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.840]
then he wouldn't have to get me raped in this.

[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:32.160]
Oh, life don't like all the hard-burnt, don't don't don't don't every time I see, don't don't don't don't let me tear it in with you.

[02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:55.240]
Don't don't don't don't fall, my TV, he's president of the f**k, rape public and muscle-in, and in our king with an idiot, I don't know why they won't want to die, but no he's here, just frozen in for years.

[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:11.600]
With president of f**k, I'm frozen in for f**k, oh what I did to the moat was small, and get to wheel-y-o-voted home.

[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:28.200]
Oh, life, if you want this, don't don't love this drum and stupid heat, don't don't love this drum and rich kid.

[02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:43.900]
Don't don't easy them, don't hurt them me, please, president of f**k, oh yeah don't care what it's up, you got them in by hook or cross with a grister, right?

[02:27:43.900 --> 02:28:13.880]
I know what you and I have a house on fear, we've got a great leader here, with president of f**k, oh what I did to the moat was small, and I'm frozen in for f**k, oh what I did to the moat was small, and get to wheel-y-o-voted home.

[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:27.140]
From being able to make you do, do, do, I should never keep being dog-o-vote, a big back-mostly trapped inside my bowels.

[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:44.340]
How can you've done from infected parts, who let these butcher doctors in? Now my heart stops, you shrieks at sign eyes for my intestines out.

[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:57.620]
I guess I should have known what to expect, did they in Miami, which the kind of service you've given this town, I would act in need to follow.

[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:01.860]
If I didn't eat that crab, I swallowed.

[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:12.400]
Why did you let me soak you in that? I'm dying over here. Why did you lose us? Get it right.

[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:20.860]
My bowels were blocked inside my hyena, can't make my turds go out.

[02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:29.140]
It's good dog, it's good dog, it's good dog, it's good dog, it's good dog, it's good dog,

[02:29:29.800 --> 02:29:33.260]
Look at that, he just can't leave, okay, go to lunch already, will you please before we

[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:34.060]
play some really good stuff.

[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:39.840]
It's eight minutes, eight minutes fast noon, 5.60 QAAM, see that nervous lamp?

[02:29:40.360 --> 02:29:42.920]
Now this poster in the Sun Central is small-vill poster?

[02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:46.560]
First of all, it's much into about nothing, it's like not a snuffin.

[02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:49.460]
It's really very bad and it's like dark and...

[02:29:49.460 --> 02:29:50.240]
It didn't even party.

[02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:53.000]
No, and the interesting part of it is though, you notice he's,

[02:29:53.020 --> 02:29:55.780]
Clark is way off to the side and there's Lana and way in the back is like,

[02:29:55.860 --> 02:29:58.000]
now is he like doing a commenza in this?

[02:29:58.760 --> 02:30:00.960]
Looks like he's taking a leak in the field or something, doesn't it?

[02:30:01.860 --> 02:30:02.760]
Where are his hands?

[02:30:03.780 --> 02:30:06.640]
Far be it for me to be one of the, I mean he's kind of like looking out of the corner of his eye

[02:30:06.640 --> 02:30:09.020]
to make sure she ain't looking and she's looking like off to the side

[02:30:09.020 --> 02:30:11.440]
because you know, you notice in all the episodes, what's happened?

[02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:12.440]
I'm like, you're in a half now?

[02:30:13.060 --> 02:30:13.620]
Something like that.

[02:30:13.860 --> 02:30:15.420]
Never touched her, much less kiss.

[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:20.120]
Yes, I'm never a touch, never like a little, you know, on a shoulder, a little, uh, anything.

[02:30:21.720 --> 02:30:22.620]
Am I right about that?

[02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:23.640]
Maybe he...

[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:25.760]
Oh no, I take that back because when, what's his name died?

[02:30:25.980 --> 02:30:28.460]
When a word came back that, remember they had the crazy, uh,

[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:30.260]
what was his name, the boyfriend, the blonde kid that went off?

[02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:30.640]
I forgot.

[02:30:30.940 --> 02:30:31.340]
Whatever's his name.

[02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:31.680]
Crazy kid.

[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:34.720]
And then he like, comforterter.

[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:36.120]
He can give her a comforter.

[02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:36.780]
But that's it.

[02:30:37.160 --> 02:30:38.320]
Maybe he's afraid he'll hurt her.

[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.280]
Yeah, he sure wasn't afraid of hurting Chloe yesterday.

[02:30:41.460 --> 02:30:43.280]
And of course, this, she's got a common in here.

[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.260]
Right when it's getting good, he's got a shirt off.

[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:46.700]
She's rolling around on top of him.

[02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:50.180]
And then they little red thing popped out, you know, like, just like that.

[02:30:50.300 --> 02:30:51.060]
The red rock.

[02:30:51.360 --> 02:30:52.780]
The little red rock popped off.

[02:30:52.920 --> 02:30:53.880]
Well, he is from outer space.

[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:56.980]
How is the poll coming, you know, the being free pool?

[02:30:57.100 --> 02:30:58.720]
Let's see, what's your take on war with Iraq?

[02:30:58.760 --> 02:31:01.760]
I noticed that some of our people are responding to free republic.com

[02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:03.120]
and rightfully so nice job.

[02:31:04.260 --> 02:31:05.840]
I mean, these people have no life.

[02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:06.460]
They sit around.

[02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:09.960]
First of all, I could almost understand if they're so politically paranoid

[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:11.880]
that they want to distort the views of the public.

[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:16.020]
But if it's on a CNN pool, an MSNBC pool, something like that,

[02:31:16.180 --> 02:31:19.100]
something that, you know, that the public pays any attention to.

[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:20.420]
Time magazine pool.

[02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:25.620]
But Neil Rogers in Miami, who the hell, what, what, what, this is for fun among our listeners?

[02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:30.140]
But they're so damn paranoid that even this, ah, we found one.

[02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:33.120]
It's something for them to do, you know, on days when they're not playing golf.

[02:31:34.720 --> 02:31:35.540]
813 votes.

[02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:36.900]
What's your take on war with Iraq?

[02:31:37.380 --> 02:31:37.920]
All for it.

[02:31:37.960 --> 02:31:38.980]
Let's rule 218.

[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:41.160]
I'm strongly against it.

[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:43.740]
213, getting pretty close all your free presides out there.

[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:44.400]
Better get busy.

[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:46.780]
Haven't been convinced it's justified.

[02:31:47.100 --> 02:31:47.400]
195.

[02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:49.440]
I support it, but I'm nervous about it.

[02:31:49.620 --> 02:31:49.980]
106.

[02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:54.580]
Let's take care of North Korea for a 64 and just don't know 17.

[02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:55.880]
I don't know.

[02:31:56.520 --> 02:31:57.440]
I do know one thing.

[02:31:57.520 --> 02:31:58.020]
We're all at food.

[02:31:58.140 --> 02:31:58.940]
Thanks again to Corkeys.

[02:31:58.980 --> 02:32:00.040]
That was great, but don't do it again.

[02:32:00.200 --> 02:32:01.540]
Oh, man.

[02:32:01.800 --> 02:32:04.580]
Do you have, you got any idea the volume of what I can assume that here?

[02:32:04.680 --> 02:32:05.200]
I got an idea.

[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:06.480]
I saw it.

[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.780]
I mean, just on godly lift.

[02:32:08.780 --> 02:32:09.640]
Need to ride home.

[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:10.940]
I'll lift, not a ride.

[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:11.560]
I need a lift.

[02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:13.420]
I put a crane with a crane.

[02:32:14.180 --> 02:32:16.200]

[02:33:14.260 --> 02:33:15.980]
Yeah, I know it's what that is.

[02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:16.720]
Sure.

[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:17.540]
Congratulations.

[02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:18.240]
Yes.

[02:33:19.280 --> 02:33:20.020]
Watch your back.

[02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:20.560]
Watch your back.

[02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:22.560]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:33:22.840 --> 02:33:24.820]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:33:24.880 --> 02:33:25.440]
Watch your back.

[02:33:25.860 --> 02:33:27.920]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:30.680]
I got enough.

[02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:32.760]
I got to think about on top of getting raped

[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:35.400]
and I don't need a rating that's a minus eight.

[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:38.120]
Don't care what you do longer than thunder snow.

[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:41.200]
You got to wake a little hotter on the desk too much.

[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:42.800]
A roasted cut's to go.

[02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:45.540]
There's a lot of fat producers here now.

[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:47.160]
That's right. Watch your back.

[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:47.640]
Back.

[02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:49.680]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:33:49.940 --> 02:33:51.760]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:52.580]
Watch your back.

[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:54.960]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:33:55.460 --> 02:33:59.540]
Oh, brother, all that glove I don't understand.

[02:34:00.140 --> 02:34:02.660]
How you can eat from a truff while using both the energy?

[02:34:02.660 --> 02:34:05.380]
That big fat punch you made a rating school.

[02:34:05.700 --> 02:34:08.060]
You just like clipped it, it's all your fault.

[02:34:08.300 --> 02:34:10.100]
And a straight-up fat ass out.

[02:34:10.920 --> 02:34:12.780]
Well, we'll take the food out of your mouth.

[02:34:13.040 --> 02:34:14.340]
That's right. Watch your back.

[02:34:14.620 --> 02:34:14.860]
Back.

[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:16.320]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:34:17.140 --> 02:34:19.120]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:19.720]
Watch your back.

[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:21.740]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:34:22.900 --> 02:34:24.260]
Listen what we said.

[02:34:24.780 --> 02:34:24.800]
Back.

[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:27.280]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:29.900]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:30.520]
Watch your back.

[02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:33.240]
Before you won't wait for no more.

[02:34:34.240 --> 02:34:35.120]
Who are you?

[02:34:35.760 --> 02:34:38.040]
You as lucky as you got a scrap here.

[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:41.100]
And I won't wait for no more.

[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:45.080]
You love Shakira's tongue and head underneath your clothes.

[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:47.420]
Oh, my mood's not long.

[02:34:48.220 --> 02:34:50.060]
That's an endless story.

[02:34:51.040 --> 02:34:53.240]
This is the moment that's long.

[02:34:53.600 --> 02:34:55.240]
And now you'll love her new album.

[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:57.340]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[02:34:57.340 --> 02:34:58.940]
She's gone through.

[02:35:02.480 --> 02:35:04.540]
She already made music history

[02:35:04.540 --> 02:35:06.740]
by recording her first English language album.

[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:09.760]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level.

[02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:12.480]
By re-recording songs that were already hits in English.

[02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:14.740]
Only this time they're in English again.

[02:35:15.120 --> 02:35:16.340]
I'm so proud of you.

[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:18.860]
That's me better.

[02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:20.560]
I'm better.

[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:23.020]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:24.960]
She's still no girl.

[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:28.000]
She can't have that more on my deep.

[02:35:28.320 --> 02:35:29.980]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:33.000]
She's a little boy, man, I'm afraid.

[02:35:33.220 --> 02:35:34.720]
They've never bought a bond.

[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:38.740]
If you really, really like Shakira's CD, laundry service,

[02:35:39.100 --> 02:35:41.960]
then you'll really, really, really like her new CD.

[02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:44.400]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[02:35:44.780 --> 02:35:46.560]
No denemos en español en estos momentos.

[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:51.160]
Shakira sings another song.

[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:56.020]
Shakira sings another song.

[02:38:53.940 --> 02:38:56.900]
She talks to guys with lousy diction

[02:38:56.900 --> 02:38:59.300]
Hey, honey, it's good I buy you a drink

[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:01.320]
Viniguito Joe

[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:02.600]
Viniguito Joe

[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:04.680]
And Joey Dane, that's me

[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:07.000]
He asked her, do you come here offer

[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:10.400]
What's the babe like you doing in a balls up joint like this?

[02:39:10.560 --> 02:39:13.460]
Can I get you a drink on me?

[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:16.580]
Hey, don't mind that I saw him, I lift it, that's for rarer

[02:39:16.580 --> 02:39:17.300]
You know what I mean?

[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:19.560]
Yeah, it'll go away

[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:21.720]
You know, you're beautiful babe

[02:39:21.720 --> 02:39:24.660]
I like that fish and that skirt, that's beautiful

[02:39:24.660 --> 02:39:26.880]
You remind me of my mom, you're a slut

[02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:29.780]
Shut eyes, he got to be now

[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:31.860]
The right back switch, he's gonna drain the drain

[02:39:31.860 --> 02:39:34.700]
Where's his chinos with today?

[02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:37.260]
Oh yeah, but don't all look good

[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:39.720]
Bricks out a lot of fizzies when the check comes

[02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:41.600]
Yeah, I'm in the union

[02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:45.780]
Then expects her to spin the night

[02:39:45.780 --> 02:39:47.360]
What do you mean no?

[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:48.680]
What do you mean?

[02:39:48.680 --> 02:39:51.680]
Yes, she talks to greet us

[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:57.680]
Come on honey, they all wear fancy gold chains

[02:39:57.680 --> 02:39:59.160]
Come on, video show you the gold

[02:39:59.160 --> 02:40:02.060]
Oh yeah, she talks to greet us

[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:06.920]
Come on baby, I don't look sand now, rain

[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:09.240]
Oh, you mean no, rain, who said that?

[02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:12.620]
Yes, she talks to greet us

[02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.280]
Come here, let's point

[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:17.180]
That she's wise to get point

[02:40:17.180 --> 02:40:19.860]
Hey, where are you?

[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:23.600]
Oh yeah, she talks to greet us

[02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:28.180]
Hey, she's always sand the drain

[02:40:28.180 --> 02:40:29.980]
Hey honey, where you going?

[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:31.420]
Come back sweetheart

[02:40:32.260 --> 02:40:34.780]
Come in sweetie, come back honey

[02:40:34.780 --> 02:40:38.820]
This is former bath president of the United States Al Gore

[02:40:38.820 --> 02:40:43.680]
I have recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion

[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:46.120]
to take pot shots at the president

[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:50.660]
I have reappeared, much like pucks the tawny fill

[02:40:50.660 --> 02:40:54.580]
the groundhog creature that reappears each year

[02:40:54.580 --> 02:40:58.180]
to determine whether or not we'll have an early spring

[02:40:58.980 --> 02:41:08.160]
I wish it to be known, but it was I who was responsible for saving the lives of those nine miners in Pennsylvania over the weekend

[02:41:09.120 --> 02:41:11.920]
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it

[02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:14.500]
as not to appear a spotlight hog

[02:41:14.500 --> 02:41:19.420]
However, I feel the American people have a right to know the truth

[02:41:20.260 --> 02:41:21.400]
Here's what happened

[02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:27.720]
Upon hearing of this unfortunate accident, I will race to the scene

[02:41:28.500 --> 02:41:34.800]
I lowered myself into the mine using an old Ron Popeo pocket fisherman and some bailing wire

[02:41:35.500 --> 02:41:39.520]
Down, down, down into the depths of darkness I think

[02:41:39.520 --> 02:41:45.220]
Never thinking of my own safety, but rather of the safety of those man on the ground

[02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:52.220]
When I reached the miners, they said to me, hey, you're the guy that invented the internet, right?

[02:41:53.140 --> 02:41:53.900]
I said yes

[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:59.160]
We all had a Mike's hard lemonade, which I brought with me down into the hole

[02:41:59.160 --> 02:42:03.240]
and then we sat around and re-enacted the fart scene from blithing saddles

[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:05.540]
I thought you should know the truth

[02:42:05.540 --> 02:42:14.660]
And now, much like the Groundhog creature pucks the tawny filth, I'll flink back into the darkness of oblivion until I am needed again

[02:42:14.660 --> 02:42:18.020]
This is Al Gore, Fuiper hero

[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:25.500]
Meet Joe, he's rich, he's handsome, he has great taste in furniture

[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:29.340]
and he has 20 beautiful women interested in him

[02:42:29.340 --> 02:42:33.640]
But there's a twist, he's not interested in them

[02:42:34.940 --> 02:42:39.200]
It's Joe Homo sexual, Fox's newest reality romance show

[02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:42.960]
See what happens when these lovely ladies try to get Joe at Switch teams

[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:45.360]
But he didn't want to talk to me at all

[02:42:45.360 --> 02:42:48.360]
He just wanted to say more pictures of my brother

[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:50.520]
Don't miss Joe Homo sexual

[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:53.900]
We were supposed to have her romantic dinner together alone

[02:42:53.900 --> 02:42:58.220]
But I didn't know he was also bringing Clip his friend

[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:03.660]
And be sure to get the final episode of Joe Homo sexual when Joe pops up big question

[02:43:03.660 --> 02:43:04.340]
Sandra?

[02:43:04.740 --> 02:43:05.700]
Yes Joe

[02:43:06.220 --> 02:43:08.380]
Which you...

[02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:10.700]
Weed me a cliff alone for a few minutes

[02:43:11.220 --> 02:43:11.440]
Whatever

[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:15.920]
Joe Homo sexual, right after Boston public bathhouse, only on Fox

[02:43:17.080 --> 02:43:20.060]

Coming to the botanolous calcium, only the stronger bar

[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:30.140]
70 TV in a recent time, I'd say him

[02:43:30.140 --> 02:43:32.920]
And the undertaker, annihilate the axis of evil

[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:35.660]
In a steel cage dead lumberjack match

[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:37.700]
Also skater to appear, Calera, open mouth

[02:43:37.700 --> 02:43:41.320]
And stone dead Steve Austin, on wishful power

[02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:44.740]
Can you smell what Steve's siren is cooking?

[02:43:45.180 --> 02:43:45.720]
Sunder

[02:43:47.140 --> 02:43:49.860]
The crowd will shake the world, we'll wait

[02:43:49.860 --> 02:43:55.220]
With the atomic hunger of any anthrax, big alkinga, mean Mr. Muster

[02:43:55.220 --> 02:43:58.140]
And goldberg in the world, heavyweight animal match

[02:43:58.140 --> 02:44:01.900]
Feel the sting of a sore loser, in the smallpox, badoroya

[02:44:01.900 --> 02:44:03.620]
There is no vaccine

[02:44:03.620 --> 02:44:08.000]

[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.420]

This weekend

[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:14.000]

I think Hank's gonna get food from corkies today too

[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:20.980]
I just had that feeling

[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:22.860]
Because of the elderly

[02:44:22.860 --> 02:44:24.280]
He heard me yesterday Jones and Ford

[02:44:24.280 --> 02:44:27.720]
And so they decided probably would appear they're gonna send some to everybody

[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:28.540]
Huh?

[02:44:29.320 --> 02:44:30.240]
Just to cover their bases

[02:44:30.240 --> 02:44:31.640]
Why not spread it around a little bit

[02:44:31.640 --> 02:44:32.760]
The off-work of yours is another meal

[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:34.200]
Not too much now, Seth

[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:37.120]
Don't be gorge in what those potato pancakes in that kishki

Shocking, all for it, let's roll 270, strong against the 269

[02:55:47.360 --> 02:55:52.140]
Haven't been convinced it justified 223, I support it but I'm nervous about it, 113

[02:55:52.560 --> 02:55:57.800]
Let's take care of North Korea first, 68, and 21 people from the Greg Read School of Life say

[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:00.740]
Yeah, don't know, don't know

[02:56:00.740 --> 02:56:04.680]
I'll tell you one thing, if your life is turning to crap because you don't feel good when you get out of the second

[02:56:04.680 --> 02:56:08.300]
A morning probably because your mattress is a piece of crap, it's lumpy, it's bumpy

[02:56:08.300 --> 02:56:10.200]
Maybe it wasn't also great in the first place

[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:14.160]
If you get you a great new name brand mattress and dollar mattress, one thing you can be sure of is

[02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:18.000]
You're gonna get it right night, sleep night after night and feel super when you hop out of the second

[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:22.400]
A morning, they carry all the top names, they got silly, sort of sim and the king coil every size and style

[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:27.560]
And the best part of the deal is when it comes to price, delivery and third day in-home thing

[02:56:28.040 --> 02:56:29.480]
What do you call it? An in-home thing

[02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:31.480]
Well, I don't know what you call it

[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:35.220]
Comfort guarantee, in other words you get a chance to sleep on it for up to 30 days

[02:56:35.220 --> 02:56:40.100]

Can't see a heart, I'm hangin' on you

Can't see the lands of ends

[02:58:09.360 --> 02:58:12.220]
Can't get those God's zipper butt through

[02:58:12.220 --> 02:58:15.240]

There's a guy who's kind of a pain

[02:59:00.620 --> 02:59:02.920]
He'd go with by the name of South Demo's saint

[02:59:02.920 --> 02:59:05.380]
We shoot him dead and put him into soil

[02:59:05.380 --> 02:59:07.200]

[03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:18.420]
We'll put the toilet in a 3-10 minutes

[03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:20.160]
I got out of the sky damn peg

[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:22.740]
Hey, what are you?

[03:05:23.060 --> 03:05:24.360]
I'm in the miscalus

[03:05:24.360 --> 03:05:25.500]
There we go

[03:05:25.500 --> 03:05:26.620]
Get your ass out of that sink

[03:05:26.620 --> 03:05:28.480]

[03:05:28.480 --> 03:05:30.700]
Okay, I promise I will

[03:05:31.320 --> 03:05:32.700]

Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for me

[03:05:41.540 --> 03:05:45.040]
I kind of like the way your balls are floating there

[03:05:45.040 --> 03:05:47.420]
All that hardwaired in your face

[03:05:48.520 --> 03:05:49.620]
Kind of sexy

[03:05:50.260 --> 03:05:50.700]
Glassy

[03:05:51.420 --> 03:05:53.080]

[03:05:54.600 --> 03:05:56.760]
Oh look, you are a very bad man

[03:05:56.760 --> 03:05:58.340]

[03:05:58.340 --> 03:05:59.040]
Give me a dumber

[03:05:59.700 --> 03:06:00.180]

[03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:05.580]
Hey, let me give you a hand washing your balls

[03:06:05.580 --> 03:06:07.360]
No, give me a lullaby

[03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:08.760]
I will not be your bitch

[03:06:08.760 --> 03:06:11.080]
Come on, I'll trust me

[03:06:11.080 --> 03:06:12.340]
You'll get used to it

[03:06:12.340 --> 03:06:14.120]
Please, I have no balls

[03:06:14.120 --> 03:06:15.640]
And I have no other curry

[03:06:15.640 --> 03:06:17.700]
Now there's a single nut sorry

[03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:19.420]

[03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:29.680]
Oh, I can't get out

[03:06:29.680 --> 03:06:31.760]
I pierced my hole too

[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:33.060]
Go, it!

[03:06:41.980 --> 03:06:44.520]
I'm the town and all you rock

[03:06:45.500 --> 03:06:48.600]
It's time I'm the same time I beat the clock

[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:50.700]

Who knows what he's got

[03:06:54.380 --> 03:06:55.760]
Hidden in his mustache

[03:06:56.760 --> 03:06:58.400]
Small pots and air trash

[03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:00.220]
He's got a few cans

[03:07:00.220 --> 03:07:01.880]
And that uranium

[03:07:01.880 --> 03:07:03.980]
He bought from friends

[03:07:03.980 --> 03:07:05.700]
He made a sandwich

[03:07:05.700 --> 03:07:07.220]
He had just a tan

[03:07:07.220 --> 03:07:09.200]
Let's give him all I did

[03:07:09.200 --> 03:07:10.620]
So he can see back

[03:07:10.620 --> 03:07:12.960]

[03:07:14.680 --> 03:07:16.860]
It's an American bomb

[03:07:18.320 --> 03:07:20.540]
We'll chop them off to the dump

[03:07:20.540 --> 03:07:22.440]

[03:07:25.900 --> 03:07:28.160]
It's an American bomb

[03:07:29.480 --> 03:07:31.840]
To keep your oil warm

[03:07:33.260 --> 03:07:35.360]
We did it once we'd fall

[03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:36.860]
But now you need some more

[03:07:37.440 --> 03:07:39.560]

[03:08:26.020 --> 03:08:26.220]
What?

[03:08:26.600 --> 03:08:29.680]
No matter what the question is they just don't freaking know

[03:08:30.160 --> 03:08:30.700]
You know?

[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:32.000]
No, I don't know

[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:32.480]

Which I haven't given all day today

[03:08:35.000 --> 03:08:37.180]
Maybe it's because my blood sugar was 850 or something like that

[03:08:37.180 --> 03:08:39.560]

Hey Goldberg, we in the studio 3 to 7

[03:08:43.080 --> 03:08:45.340]
And I'm sure that Korki is going to bring in the Humper food

[03:08:45.900 --> 03:08:47.360]
If they know what's good for him, you know what I'm saying?

[03:08:47.640 --> 03:08:49.200]
He gets really surly if he don't get his food

[03:08:49.200 --> 03:08:50.140]
