[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]
Anyway, let's check in with Neil. Neil, good morning.

[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.880]
Oh, it's gotten beast. I'm surprised beast showed up today. I thought he'd be in mourning for at least a week.

[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.960]
Yeah, you know, me too. And then the dolphins I had to coldson three. That got everybody all flustered yesterday.

[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.080]
You know what the beast binge for revenge. That's what Dr. Phil says.

[00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.900]
Hey, you know what I went to, uh, hey, uh, Neil, I went to the Panther game the other night.

[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.480]
And they just got done six to two. Now let me ask you a question. How about those leafs?

[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.420]
Seven of what against the flyers. That was a nice performance. We meet little girls team last night.

[00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.120]
Yeah, but I went to the game on Saturday. Actually there at that San Jose game, about 30.

[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.300]
It seemed to me that there was probably around. My guess was 12 maybe 10.

[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.380]
Get out of here. The paper said 13, which, okay, then there was nine eight or nine. Yeah. Yeah.

[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.600]
It was definitely I could have I could have actually played. I think at one point they were going to just

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.320]
bring some people in from the goal of guarantee of that. Well, they were going to pick a certain seat.

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.420]
And you could actually come down and do a shift. I guess the backup goal.

[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.960]
He ended human shields. Huh? No, he's not actually.

[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.460]
Uh, what is your guy? How's that?

[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.440]
Have a stroke? Well, when I've never heard of a guy that has a hat trick. There's a problem right there.

[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.220]
The hero Bernad have a stroke. I hope so. What do you mean? You never heard of Alan McColley?

[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.760]
X maple leaf make believe. Yeah, I know Alan McColley. He's the guy that I had.

[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.760]
Last night I came across the last hour by accident. I wish somebody would have called and told me,

[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.500]
hey, Neil, be sure to catch the three hour CBS special 75 years.

[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.220]
Oh, yeah, that was the network special. Was that good?

[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.500]
I saw the last hour. I would like to see the other two hours. But Carol Bernad, I think at a stroke,

[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.680]
she she looked a little like John Craig Chan. She was talking out of the corner of the course.

[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.120]
I'm big on that John Christian. He's a really great guy.

[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.760]
There's one thing he ain't no bush, Maister. Hey, how'd you think the dolphins looked yesterday?

[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.560]
I thought they look great. Well, today I'm predicting this one.

[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.920]
I'm seriously I'm predicting they want to make the playoffs.

[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.780]
I want to ask you this question very seriously.

[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.660]
But aren't we cursed down here?

[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.520]
We may be cursed, but I have a nice house.

[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.720]
I have a nice house, but I may actually be cursed. You know what I asked myself today that my

[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.160]
galt, look at this chick with this scene. I'm telling you. I want to go.

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.300]
I want to go. I want to go.

[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.440]
The canes lose your boy Tom Brady with a nice ass better cover for me tonight is all I have to say.

[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.380]
Yeah, yeah, I'm doing Monday night.

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.760]
About that game and how do you know he has a nice ass? Well, you've been telling me as a nice

[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.740]
ass and your little quarterback. Hey, your little quarterback and Notre Dame.

[00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.540]
Come get hard there. The other one.

[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.500]
George is the one who's needy-pumpin' to ass.

[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.700]
How about your Notre Dame quarterback? They did a nice job against Florida State.

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.140]
I loved it. That kid's ass is a great food.

[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.540]
Good good.

[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.520]
Pummeled. I love it.

[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.360]
I mean, if Notre Dame never won a game in any sport again, it would please me like crazy.

[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.540]
I was so happy with the dolphin loss yesterday with knocking my knees together.

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.460]
I just couldn't believe it.

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.900]
34 seed hasn't liked the dolphins either. She sits in her seat and cheers for the other team.

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.180]
There's nothing about Brian Greese, man. He's got this problem.

[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.340]
He keeps falling down and dropping the ball.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480]
Why do they keep showing?

[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.380]
Is that Brian?

[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.380]
Why do they show his dad in the game?

[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.080]
He's dead with a binoculars up there.

[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.420]
Yeah, well, who cares to look at him?

[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.780]
He's a little long in the tooth, old Bob.

[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.120]
He's like, okay, which team is my son on? Which team?

[00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.920]
Which one is he?

[00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.340]
I think listening to the...

[00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.680]
Listening to him do the ABC games on Saturdays is torture.

[00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.600]
Awful. He's brutal. He's so boring.

[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.380]
I told you I worked with him when you were a new M baseball tonight.

[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.880]
Oh.

[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.460]
I'm channel 33.

[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.620]
You were in baseball, so do you like the games at that point?

[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.220]
You're a ugly kid of the games. You know who his punky little ugly kid was?

[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.460]
Who?

[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:18.160]
Brian.

[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.860]
Brian, of course.

[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.100]
And he's just as ugly and I was he was then.

[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.860]
So how many people are dead now in Iraq?

[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.880]
Another one is in the air?

[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:25.760]
That's just this hour.

[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.600]
Yeah, that's just this hour.

[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.860]
When are people going to...

[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.080]
I was asking George this morning.

[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280]
When are people going to start getting pissed off already?

[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.860]
I don't know, but...

[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.000]
How many more innocent Americans plus all the other Iraqis

[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.700]
that we don't care about?

[00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.780]
How many more people have to keep dying over the street

[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.040]
and live before they finally say,

[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.960]
well, we made a mistake.

[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.900]
Hey, what's the story with the Episcopalians over there, Neil?

[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.020]
You happy with that scene?

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.520]

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.220]
Oh, I love it.

[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.360]
They're jamming right down their throat

[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.380]
if you're part of that expression.

[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.740]
Yeah, how about the cover of the USA Today?

[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.220]
Free speech is not allowed on campus.

[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.660]
I don't know what I'm saying because you're talking now.

[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.300]
You're getting the trouble.

[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.460]
I don't want to get you a...

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.580]
Yeah.

[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.080]
You need to be making a nice comeback now.

[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.620]
Okay.

[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.880]
Well, as long as I get advised by you on how to deal with

[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.740]
the two-faced people around here, then I'll be all right.

[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.540]
You know, they say one thing and do another.

[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.440]
Listen to me.

[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.800]
I'm going to give you the same advice I give to Mad Dog and the Humperer.

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.560]
They both took it very well and they're doing great.

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.240]
But, all right.

[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.800]
Take the money right to the bank.

[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.080]
Just take the money to the bank and laugh all the way.

[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.580]
Okay.

[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.540]
I'm telling you.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.440]
I tried that every day in my goal in life now.

[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.800]
It's to slow down in my car and not die in a car wreck.

[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.880]
Live stress-free.

[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.480]
Just take the money straight to the bank.

[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.500]
Screw all the rest of it.

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.460]
Do whatever the hell it will be.

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.120]
I want to be a good boy.

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.200]
I need to slow down a speed because I am a train wreck.

[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.440]
I am a road rage.

[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.900]
Take a lot of vacations.

[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.180]
I need a lot of vacation.

[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.740]
I need to...

[00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.160]
I'm building my own studio now.

[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.220]
I'm selling them shows and I'm planning on...

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.460]
Well, Michael is to take over the station maybe.

[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.740]
You and I fire all those people and running.

[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.200]
Hey, you off.

[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.200]
Here's the first thing you got to do is pay off.

[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.140]
Everybody's under contract starting with me.

[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.220]
And you and I are the only ones that know what we're doing anyway.

[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.700]
Don't leave out your good buddy mode.

[00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.220]
Oh, now I'm suddenly...

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.640]
Now that the Lucian's laughing in there,

[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.580]
he thinks he's the extraordinaire running the whole radio station.

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.920]
He's going to come back with a clock and kill all of us.

[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.780]
Let alone run this.

[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.740]
Who's that?

[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.980]
Who's that?

[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.640]
That's Scott Delusional, I call him.

[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:11.440]
He's Delusional.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.420]
Oh, yeah.

[00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.400]
He thinks I'm bad luck.

[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.640]
I'll say I'm bad luck.

[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.620]
What problem would Scott?

[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.160]
And that is that he's incredibly dumb.

[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.900]
Other than that, he's over there.

[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.520]
No, he can pick hockey scores.

[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.000]
I know that.

[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.780]
Yeah, he said the Panthers would get two on Saturday.

[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:24.660]
He was right about that.

[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.340]
He was the other one by four.

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.380]
Yeah, I went...

[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.100]
That game was unbelievable.

[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.280]
I saw somebody go...

[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.320]
I was ordering a beer.

[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.500]
I saw three goals going.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.820]
They weren't ours.

[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.800]
It was Alan McCauley had to have three.

[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.080]
I know.

[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.840]
Never heard of it.

[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.580]
Well, there you go.

[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.640]
I knew who he was.

[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.240]
Now I played with your boy,

[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.020]
Caberlay and McCauley and all those fangs up there.

[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.480]
You know when Jack, 1967, I said fangs.

[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.740]
Oh, the way he went.

[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.480]
Fams.

[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.700]
He got Bush, Wack, and Carol.

[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.860]
Your boys don't win Jack in blind.

[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.780]
It's like every year.

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.660]
It's like to fill it out.

[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.400]
The sport teams.

[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.260]
They're the greatest teams in the regular season.

[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.120]
In every of the playoffs.

[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.520]
They eat...

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.160]
Deam choking gagging sounds.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.760]
Yeah.

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.920]
They're gagging it.

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.400]
Kind of like at the Catholic Church,

[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.820]
you can hear those gagging sounds.

[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.180]
Do you think there's more mosquitoes,

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.200]
west or east in Florida?

[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.900]
I think it's west.

[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.740]
So like every day I get attacked now,

[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.440]
it says I'm in the swamps.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.580]
Are you out west in Boka?

[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.380]
Yeah, I move into a big,

[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.280]
big fancy neighbor bad movies.

[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.100]
You see my house.

[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.620]
I'm out of your house.

[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.060]
Take the profit and buy a place

[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.480]
like in plantation acres.

[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.620]
Right next to you.

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.680]
No, not near me.

[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.460]
Like your house.

[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.780]
No mysterious.

[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.420]
Only old Jews live in Boka.

[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.720]
See somebody misinformed you.

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.740]
You have no business living in Boka.

[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.220]
You got that right.

[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.760]
Listen to this.

[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.220]
The other morning I went to lead

[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.520]
west Boka to get something to eat for breakfast.

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.060]
And all I could find

[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.600]
for like 20 miles was sushi

[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.300]
and Chinese and Japanese food.

[00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.800]
And I said, I am in Tel Aviv.

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.440]
Yeah.

[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.140]
That's exactly what I said driving

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.220]
and I started swearing.

[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.320]
I drove fast,

[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.060]
excessively.

[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.160]
I flipped a couple people off

[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.360]
and I went back to East Boka

[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.700]
so I could eat with the Jews over there.

[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.680]
Oi!

[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:51.860]
You heard me, Neil.

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.240]
You need to go and eat breakfast.

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.180]
I gotta go to the griddle to eat breakfast

[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.720]
because there's no...

[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.220]
I gotta go to...

[00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.200]
Take your little sack.

[00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.480]
Go to the rascal house.

[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.940]
Stuff some pickles and bagels.

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.080]
And they still get a little money

[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.840]
balance for life.

[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.420]
I love that guy.

[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.540]
Balance for life.

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.740]
Hey, Neil, I still have it.

[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:06.320]
Jeff High.

[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.480]
It takes him a month to get around

[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.000]
a corner, let alone get me my bed.

[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.040]
Thinking of balance for life, uh,

[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.240]
Beast, where the hell is where,

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.420]
the spots, where is the food?

[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.880]
What were we doing on this show?

[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:15.780]
We needed, we had the food.

[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.320]
As Shelley Bloom sent me clothes

[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.140]
that were for a fit for a little boy.

[00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.680]
They put me in the room.

[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:20.640]
I wear extra large.

[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.900]
I love those people at Shelley Bloom.

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:22.660]
They gotta get it straight.

[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.880]
I'm as pretty as a girl.

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.400]
6'3", 1'7", 5'9",

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.380]
and 6'3", I wear extra large.

[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.780]
They send me women small.

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.260]
No, no.

[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:29.920]
Those weren't for you.

[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.260]
Those were for Clarence's boyfriend.

[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:31.860]
Oh, that's right.

[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:32.240]
I'm sorry.

[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.080]
I didn't get close.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.820]
Actually, they must have sent him to the wrong guy.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.340]
Just take two of those and nip them together.

[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:37.540]
You'll have something good for the beast.

[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.940]
I gotta go to the sports gym.

[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.200]
And then I'm doing hard put hairs.

[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.800]
I'm in a very cool beast.

[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:42.160]
Oh my god.

[00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.940]
See ya, Neil.

[00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.380]
I ain't fucking bow.

[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.520]
We did it.

[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.000]
We did it.

[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:47.760]
Hey.

[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.820]
Stamps of power, manure.

[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.200]
Hover's over.

[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.700]
This performance by the dolphins.

[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:04.380]
Oh.

[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:04.980]

[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.880]
Miami has the dolphins.

[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.000]
They're the worst football team.

[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.780]
They're the ones they've loved the ball from goal to goal.

[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.340]
Like no one's ever seen.

[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.140]
They're on the ground.

[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.260]
That's where they'll stay.

[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.940]
They're never in control.

[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.480]
And when you say Miami, you're talking toilet holes.

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.100]
They're the Miami dolphins.

[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.360]
Miami dolphins.

[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.920]
Miami dolphins number.

[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.440]
How many teens in a week?

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:34.380]
About 30 men.

[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.100]
Miami dolphins.

[00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:38.360]
Miami dolphins.

[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.220]
Don't bet on them.

[00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.380]
You'll always lose.

[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.080]
They don't know how to tackle.

[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.160]
They don't know how to block.

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.880]
Their coaches ought to tell them to put the game their jocks.

[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:56.100]
Then they would run much faster.

[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.140]
And even in defeat.

[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:02.260]
When we go to the stadium, we'll see Miami.

[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.300]
And they're the Miami dolphins.

[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:05.900]
Oh.

[00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.540]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.120]
Miami dolphins number.

[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.560]
How many teens in a week?

[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.620]
About 30 men.

[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.360]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.560]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.660]
The team that hasn't got a clue.

[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:23.960]
Miami.

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.540]
Miami has the dolphins, but the dolphins have no fans.

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.120]
Just 50,000 assholes sitting in the stands.

[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.360]
They watch the game and all they do is mown in gripe and bitch.

[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:40.820]
I wonder how Jo Rabi got to be so goddamn rich.

[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.540]
And they're the Miami dolphins.

[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.780]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.380]
Absolutely.

[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.280]
Miami dolphins number.

[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.840]
How many teens in a week?

[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:50.880]
About 30 men.

[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.500]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.780]
Miami dolphins.

[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.760]
I hear the crowd begin to boo.

[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.580]
The dolphins have faith, feedler.

[00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:05.600]
That quarter backs at you.

[00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:05.940]
Oh.

[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.080]
Run down the field and he will throw a pass over you.

[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.860]
I'll never win a super bowl.

[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.180]
You shouldn't be surprised when he gets cut.

[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:19.640]
That doesn't mean that he was circumcised in there.

[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.700]
The Miami dolphins.

[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:23.860]
Miami dolphins.

[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.540]
Miami dolphins number.

[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.860]
How many teens in a week?

[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:28.700]
About 20.

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.720]
Miami dolphins.

[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.960]
Miami dolphins.

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.880]
Jake calls his signals in Hebrew.

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.820]
The dolphins have no deep fence and their offenses at joke.

[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.340]
Like George Bush eating pretzels,

[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.360]
you know they're gonna choke.

[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.900]
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race.

[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:57.840]
With fewer points than Pac-Marx on high zingas ugly face in there.

[00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.960]
The Miami dolphins.

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.100]
Miami dolphins.

[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.700]
Miami dolphins number.

[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.860]
Oh, what the hell?

[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:06.720]
32.

[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.980]
Miami dolphins.

[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.220]
Miami dolphins.

[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.580]
Miami dolphins.

[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.820]
Now they're through.

[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.580]
Uh-huh.

[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.380]
That's absolutely.

[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.900]
It's 11 after 10 already.

[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:27.480]
How do you like that?

[00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.600]
It's almost great time, George.

[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.220]
Oh, let's go.

[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.160]
Almost.

[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.300]
Well, here's the first facet of the day like I said.

[00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.320]
And it says very good by the way, Mark, outstanding.

[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.940]
Aren't we cursed, Neil?

[00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:38.700]
Aren't we cursed?

[00:11:39.260 --> 00:11:40.160]
And then it says,

[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.080]
and it spells it right too.

[00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:43.520]
I love that.

[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.100]
Just the right number of a's and a's is.

[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.040]
It says, screw the assholes in this town with can enjoy life.

[00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:50.340]
Unless the football teams win.

[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.500]
I love the canes and dolphins.

[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.100]
Guess what?

[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.380]
I still had a great wink and nice going, Mark.

[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.160]
The rest of the Barbissanagoyam are walking around town looking like a close relative died.

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.100]
They're doing everything but wearing black arm bands.

[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.580]
I've been down here almost my whole life and I still can't believe this.

[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.660]
When will I learn?

[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.840]
By the way, thank you for your story on a website

[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.840]
concerning the selling on evay.com of the

[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.260]
Mert devices to screw up with the traffic lights.

[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.280]
That was extremely informative and eye-opening.

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.020]
I can picture the drivers down here getting at least one of those devices while they can.

[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.320]
The lights are messed up enough.

[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.620]
Now we can really mess with them.

[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.140]
Where F is what Mark said.

[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.040]
Have a great show, Mark.

[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:23.540]
Thanks, Mark.

[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:25.060]
And are we cursed down here?

[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.220]
Oh my god.

[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.400]
What are we going to do?

[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:34.140]
God, I actually got sexual excitement from this weekend.

[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.940]
From seeing all three teams lose.

[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:39.260]
I shouldn't say that about the Panthers because that makes me sound like anti-panther.

[00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.620]
But it's just that the organization, these new owners, man, they haven't got a freaking clue.

[00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.040]
They haven't got a clue.

[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:49.120]
You shouldn't know that when he had Bernie Kostar as the face man running around like a silly little girl.

[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:50.680]
Remember that with that thing he was in the studio?

[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.600]
No.

[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:52.720]
He was running around.

[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.280]
Yeah, he was giggling like a little girl.

[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.580]
Oh, we got the Panthers.

[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:56.740]
We had like a play toy.

[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.120]
Like some kid who just had like a new play toy brought in.

[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.380]
Like PlayStation 69 or whatever the hell it was.

[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.880]
Of course, Bernie, they kind of like shoved him in the back and he's basically out.

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.440]
They were going to use him as the face man.

[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.140]
Hey, look at this.

[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:09.700]
We got a guy.

[00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.820]
We got a jock who's involved.

[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.940]
He, we own the team, huh?

[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.500]
Do we have any idea what we're doing?

[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:13.740]
No.

[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.600]
No, but we're fans.

[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.420]
Well, good.

[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.440]
Maybe they can pay to get in.

[00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.520]
1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.240]
Imagine this.

[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.840]
Imagine zero closing costs on your next house.

[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.000]
Zero application fee, zero credit,

[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:27.560]
bureau fee, zero discounted points.

[00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:29.800]
This will be the last mortgage you will be ever needing.

[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:33.100]
The revolutionary only one mortgage from financial group.

[00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.600]
Now with a low, amazing rate of just 1.95%.

[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.240]
That's only 738 months for a month for 200,000.

[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:44.000]
Alone, for example, once you refinance or get you a new home mortgage from financial group,

[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.240]
you will never ever pay closing costs again.

[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:47.480]
So call when in doubt.

[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:48.180]

There are an equal housing lender.

Restrictions apply rates up to change monthly.

[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.020]
5.19 APR.

[00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.740]
We're supporting you 5.16.

[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:35.240]
QAM.

[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.600]
Urgai f***ing blow.

[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.820]
It's a world of nuns walking side by side.

[00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.720]
You can all repent on the heavens ride.

[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:51.620]
Send in life you will wait.

[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.540]
Because until they did perly date,

[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:56.720]
it's a whole world that they're all.

[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.500]
There's a bunch of t-shirts that you can buy.

[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.400]
You can even lunch with a real post guy.

[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.340]
Take your picture, it's a snap.

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.280]
Saving there in the post lab.

[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:12.640]
It's a whole world after all.

[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.440]
It's a whole world after all.

[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.220]
To enter you must be distal.

[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.000]
The bad is akin with a shopping mall.

[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.200]
It's a whole world after all.

[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.520]
10.19 at 5.60 WQM.

[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.540]
Happy Monday to it.

[00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.360]
It ain't yom kipper.

[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:34.480]
It only comes once a year.

[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:35.800]
Okay, even a goiim should know that.

[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.980]
It's not yom kipper.

[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.620]
So, quip it a long face.

[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:39.080]
Okay.

[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.400]
I don't want to hear that joke about the horses.

[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.200]
A horse or what is it that goes into the barn.

[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.380]
Why don't you want to hear those old stale jokes?

[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.060]
Like Tim Conway and who's the other one?

[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.600]
Harvey Kerman.

[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.160]
We're doing last night on that CVS special.

[00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.000]
I think it was probably a really great show.

[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.120]
Because I only saw the last hour.

[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.540]
But that oh boy.

[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.680]
And did Carol Burnett have a stroke or not?

[00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:57.460]
We don't know.

[00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.200]
We don't know. Well, let's find out.

[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.000]
She was like, I don't know.

[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.180]
Of course, she's about 110.

[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.580]
But man, she's like talking about it.

[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:04.180]
Which is bad.

[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.180]
Because we like Carol Burnett.

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:05.740]
Not a lot.

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.840]
I didn't really like her show all that much.

[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.100]
But we like her as a person.

[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:09.700]
She's okay.

[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.460]
Yeah. Right?

[00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.520]
Never stole a freight train.

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.480]
Right. She never stole a freaking freight train.

[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.280]
She probably never like to hit out on one either.

[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.100]
What are these faxes that are pouring across here now?

[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.760]
Well, last week you were ranting about the public subsidies

[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:23.340]
being used for New Marlins ballpark.

[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.840]
You then questioned whether it would be available on the bit.

[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.140]
Look at this.

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:29.820]
This story from Sundays here.

[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.900]
$80,000 for a restaurant with seats.

[00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.000]
73 people so they can move a block east.

[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:36.540]
I guess you used a wrong example.

[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.260]
But you know something Mike Mayo wrote.

[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.460]
His one good column for the year in the Sun Sentinel yesterday.

[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:41.760]
And I'm going to read it.

[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.040]
How do you like that? It's on our website.

[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.740]
Or at least it was yesterday.

[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.520]
Maybe it's on today.

[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:46.060]
Is it today?

[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:48.820]
Well, whenever the hell was.

[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.220]
Where it was.

[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.540]
Where it was nice going Mike Mayo.

[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:54.540]
And I knew he would do it less than a week after he wrote his gushing column about.

[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.260]
Oh, the Marlins. This was so exciting.

[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.120]
And now it's not the time to be peeing on their parade about the public money for a stay.

[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.440]
Well, she didn't take too long Mike.

[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:02.920]
I probably embarrassed him into it.

[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.680]
You know what? Sure.

[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.140]
Nice going Mike Mayo. I'm going to read it.

[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.100]
Here's the pull result from Friday.

[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.060]
What's your biggest beef with Neal?

[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.680]
1730 votes. Pretty heavy duty because that's the kind of thing that they love.

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.360]
I have no real beef with Neal.

[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:20.560]
632. 36.5%.

[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:25.500]
Which would have been a higher percentage except for the fact that we added all these other categories to give them an escape valve.

[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.840]
Some places else to go.

[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.200]
36.5% have no beef with Neal at all.

[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.500]
The biggest beef they have.

[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.060]
He puts George on the fill in 222.

[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:34.880]
222.

[00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.720]
12.8%. Nice going George.

[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.040]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.320]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:01.040]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:01.120]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:01.200]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.200]

[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.240]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.240]

[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:01.240]

[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:01.500]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.020]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.020]

[00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:02.620]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.120]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.140]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.940]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:26.160]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:26.220]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.220]

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.220]

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.220]

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.220]

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.220]

[00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:26.620]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.440]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.660]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:29.180]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:30.760]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.920]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.020]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.500]
Thank you very much.

[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.840]
He's out of Miami too much.

[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.980]
73.4.2% sounds like jealousy again to me.

[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.080]
Does it really make a difference?

[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:43.300]
No.

[00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.880]
I'll be in Miami soon and it will make a bit of difference.

[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:47.920]
In fact, George is so anxious to see me

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.460]
that when I'm coming to town he's going on vacation.

[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.080]
Well, we know what we look like.

[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.360]
I got to see him here.

[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.200]
We got pictures to every other bite.

[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.780]
Not enough reading, in other words, not enough bedtime stories.

[00:18:59.280 --> 00:18:59.640]
69.

[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.760]
3.9% say not enough bedtime stories.

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.680]
Too many comedy bits 68.

[00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:06.780]
What?

[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.200]
But that's less than 4%.

[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:09.700]
I know.

[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.500]
I mean, we put these on here.

[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.760]
Somebody was going to vote for them.

[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.360]
This is a good outlet.

[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.580]
This is goes to show you.

[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:17.560]
You cannot possibly please everybody.

[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.780]
We do our best to come in and like,

[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.060]
spruce it up a little every day.

[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.540]
But you can't please everybody.

[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:23.600]
It's free.

[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.160]
If you don't like to show, go away.

[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.300]
That's all I have to do.

[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:27.680]
No, no.

[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.200]
No, no.

[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.840]
People don't hate me the most.

[00:19:30.060 --> 00:19:31.760]
They're there religiously, including that asshole

[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.640]
that called last week.

[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.740]
Oh, I've been listening to you for 13 years.

[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:35.920]
I just called to say today.

[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:36.940]
Yeah, goodbye.

[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:37.900]
I don't get you.

[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.360]
I don't get you.

[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.120]
Likely story.

[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:42.360]
Too much pull talk 58.

[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.240]
Well, that's the audience.

[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.760]
So, what remember, we never even used to talk about the poll

[00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:46.940]
except once in a while the result.

[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.020]
But the audience has kind of forced us.

[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:50.520]
It's all they responded into.

[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.720]
Yeah, this is what they like.

[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.080]
This is what they respond to.

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.120]
And the, you know what?

[00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:55.260]
We got to go back into though.

[00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.580]
I was just thinking about this yesterday.

[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:57.260]
What hit wonders?

[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.020]
No.

[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:58.960]
Oh, god.

[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.740]
Oh, the movie stuff again.

[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:01.260]
Yeah, man.

[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.960]
Because June and July is when we were doing that stuff.

[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.260]
Heavy duty and looking at the big numbers

[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:06.260]
we had in June and July.

[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.780]
It's by the sum of the people again.

[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:09.040]
Because you can never please them all.

[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.800]
Oh, you're talking.

[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.300]
I'll start you talking about his movies.

[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.180]
All the season.

[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:12.700]
Too much.

[00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:13.540]
Doesn't like movies.

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.120]
Who doesn't watch?

[00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:14.820]
Exactly.

[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.380]
Only only recluse assholes who sit there.

[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.780]
A ditto themselves in the corner,

[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.380]
sitting around a house in their underwear all day.

[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.820]
You need a movie to watch to do that.

[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:22.660]
That's true.

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.820]
Too much pull talk 58.

[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.500]
He's too much of a fag 38 to 1%.

[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.260]
Yeah, we also should put on.

[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.400]
He's not enough of a fag.

[00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.420]
So pardon me, we blew that.

[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.140]
So to speak.

[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.400]
He's too much of a fag 38.

[00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:36.980]
He rips mode too much 34.

[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.020]
Now keep in mind, doesn't rip him enough 96.

[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:41.000]
And I rip mode too much 34.

[00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:43.120]
So obviously they want me to rip more a lot more.

[00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:43.700]
Absolutely.

[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.880]
He hangs up on too many callers 33.

[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.740]
Too much reading 17.

[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.820]
Well, get used to it.

[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.740]
Not enough sports talk 16.

[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.180]
Too much sports talk 15.

[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.120]
Now that is really fabulous, isn't it?

[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.120]
It's fabulous.

[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.840]
No, seriously, like cancels itself out.

[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.180]
I know.

[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.520]
Because it's just they don't give a crap.

[00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:02.080]
And too much foul language.

[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.900]
You ask only only six point 3%.

[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.600]
The last bite too much foul language.

[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.420]
So anybody who calls does like the language

[00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:11.200]
on his goddamn show too bad.

[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.100]
Because nobody else seems to really care.

[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.020]
I think that's quite a testament and tribute to all of us.

[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.020]
In my case, the old testament.

[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.180]
Here's the facts from Pete who says no more callers.

[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:25.040]
They are the cancer of your show.

[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.060]
And they're slowly eating away a little thing called

[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:27.740]
entertainment.

[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.660]
More bedtime story.

[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.400]
What you see the problem with your fast speed.

[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.300]
It's very well intended.

[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.120]
And I'll read the whole thing.

[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.700]
But it's, you know, here's a guy who

[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.460]
liked those seven months when I said here in red,

[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.760]
as you'll discover during the rest of this fact.

[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.260]
More bedtime stories.

[00:21:41.540 --> 00:21:43.280]
Anything is better than the boring callers

[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.080]
who have nothing to say.

[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.200]
Even more moment clips when he rips you are better or dead air

[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:50.600]
or transponder, repair anything.

[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.320]
But for God's sake, stop with the boring asshole callers

[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.180]
who have nothing to say.

[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.180]
Love the show, especially those months

[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.500]
when you didn't take one call, Pete.

[00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.260]
See what I'm coming from and I last sentence there.

[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:01.260]
He liked the seven months when we didn't take a call.

[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.640]
I liked him.

[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.220]
George liked him.

[00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.660]
I liked him.

[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:04.600]
Everybody else hated it.

[00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.980]
Just George and me and Pete.

[00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:07.440]
That's it.

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:08.820]
Everybody else hated those people.

[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:09.380]
Pretty much, I guess.

[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:10.160]
Right?

[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.580]
Well, there must have been some people who have

[00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.200]
to like it.

[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:14.100]
Not a, huh?

[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.120]
Book of Brian liked it.

[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.160]
Though there's four.

[00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.160]
Not enough reading.

[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:19.540]
How many votes did that thing have?

[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:19.900]
Let me look.

[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:22.260]
69.

[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.680]
It keeps popping up.

[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.440]
All over the place.

[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.400]
That's 69 number.

[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.000]
Not enough reading.

[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.240]
In other words, more bedtime stories.

[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:31.940]
So Pete, I hardly agree.

[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.520]
Most of the callers suck big time.

[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.920]
You can just smell it.

[00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:35.920]
You can smell the second,

[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.940]
I'm gonna smack him right over the phone.

[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.840]
But that's just the way it is.

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.240]
Never gonna change and stop Florida.

[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:39.660]
Is it?

[00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:39.820]
No.

[00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:40.100]
No.

[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.640]
So we do the best we can.

[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.140]
Try to satisfy everybody.

[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:43.760]
That's all.

[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.280]
And we seem to be doing okay because the money keeps rolling

[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.680]
and the checks keep clearing.

[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.960]
Nice going over there, beesleaves.

[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.720]
And by the way, it's safe to come down from the tree.

[00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:53.520]
That's a cacle guy.

[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:54.340]
He's back in jail.

[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:55.960]
Well, I don't think he done it.

[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.240]
You know?

[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.880]
I haven't seen it.

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.120]
I think he has to be like a while.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.820]
There have been enough Kennedy sacrifices already.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:02.780]
That's not a good example.

[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:03.080]
No.

[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:05.720]
Let's see.

[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.520]
What's all this stuff?

[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:07.880]
Try my targets.

[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.460]
$80,000 from Mew.

[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.680]
Try my tie.

[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.920]
One of Hollywood's landmark restaurants plans to move

[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.460]
from its well-known spot at 2003 Harrison Street.

[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.600]
But customers will never have a problem

[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:17.140]
find the new one.

[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.300]
It's only a block east.

[00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.140]
What you didn't read on that fax.

[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:21.820]
Is it a little PS there at the bottom?

[00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.560]
That said, they suck.

[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.320]
Who sucks?

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:27.360]
That restaurant.

[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.420]
They're few sucks.

[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:29.320]
And he's right.

[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.060]
Oh, it sucks.

[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:31.800]
Try my tie.

[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:33.820]
Yeah, don't try my tie.

[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.580]
Well, anyway, the city's downtown community

[00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:37.100]
redevelopment.

[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.660]
The commissioners voted to give them

[00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.840]
80 grand to help with construction cost,

[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.560]
the kitchen renovation, and improvements

[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.520]
to the restaurants outdoor.

[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.400]
Well, that's nice.

[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:45.960]
How do you like that?

[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.440]
I don't.

[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.800]
So the guy who faxed me that notes got a good point.

[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.420]
That is that governments are subsidizing private enterprise,

[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:53.620]
which is a bunch of bullcrap.

[00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:54.660]
Sure, a case like this.

[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.700]
A totally privately owned business,

[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.100]
and which has nothing to do with the common good

[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.300]
or the public good or anything like that.

[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.040]
So guys in business, oh, here's 80 grand.

[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.980]
Put a new sign up in the spiffy up the restaurant

[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:05.680]
and do all this other.

[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.040]
Maybe the food will get better, George.

[00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:07.480]
What do you think?

[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:07.760]
No.

[00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:10.980]
1027 at 560 WQM.

[00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.380]
If you're looking to replace that tired old carpeting

[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.020]
in your home, let me tell you about Lamin and Saras.

[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:17.520]
This is the easy low maintenance alternative

[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:19.340]
to expensive natural wood flooring.

[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.380]
Lamin and Saras is the best place to find laminated wood flooring

[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:23.600]
from the top names in universe,

[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.960]
perid or pergol, Wilson or Uniflor,

[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.620]
a quick step in all of Lamin and Saras

[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:29.940]
flooring is installed by pergol certified installers

[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:30.860]
who know what they're doing.

[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:32.820]
Here's another reason to be called Lamin and Saras.

[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:33.940]
Their prices will flow here.

[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.280]
Right now, get their fall special for just $1495.

[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.260]
Just $1495 from the 295 square feet

[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.440]
of beautiful Lamin and wood flooring,

[00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.300]
it's unreal and Lamin and Saras will match any legitimate

[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:47.160]
written offer free in a home estimate

[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.440]
called Lamin and Saras toll free.

[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:50.420]
The reason I'm stumbling here is I'm looking

[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:51.760]
for anything new in this copy

[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.400]
because they set this to me like a little while ago.

[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.760]
There's not one word changed in this piece of copy.

[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.160]
Who's count is this?

[00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.740]
Is this Adam?

[00:24:58.920 --> 00:24:59.080]
Yes.

[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.680]
There's not one single solitary word changed.

[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:04.740]
What is it?

[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.200]
I don't know.

[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.760]
Anyway, Lamin and Saras will match any legitimate written offer

[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.540]
if you'd like a free in a home estimate column toll free

[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.520]
at 1-877-777-73336.

[00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:14.820]
And don't forget to tell him

[00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.560]
that it's starting to rub off on Adam even now.

[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:17.720]
What could be easier?

[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.740]
Free corporate disposal,

[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.280]
fee furniture moving,

[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:21.360]

and years of beautiful,

[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.320]
easy care, Lamin and wood flooring.

[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:25.220]
Call Lamin and Saras today,

[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.360]
toll free in Tom that Adam.

[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:31.560]
Tority to call 1-877-777-3336.

[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.140]
I am low.

[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.340]
This is 420-06.

[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.040]
You weigh in.

[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.500]
When D.A.Y.

[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.780]
All right.

[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.060]
As you see, K.S.

[00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.000]
Yes, sir.

[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:48.560]
No.

[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:53.760]
Ha-ha.

[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.720]
I can't believe I'm the winner.

[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:57.360]
I am the winner.

[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.140]
Well, it wasn't even close.

[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.280]
I exterminated all of great Davis.

[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:08.140]
The people didn't seem to care.

[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:09.340]
I grabbed the movies.

[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.160]
I'm the little miss.

[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.980]
California has spoken I'm the winner.

[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.620]
Lots of women said I followed them

[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.760]
in all it was like 13th and 3rd.

[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.680]
But I don't care.

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.000]
And the water's okay.

[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.280]
Because now I'm done with corporate data

[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.840]
on the California G-Wall P.

[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.240]
Well, I used all of my muscle

[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.160]
and I used all of my sex appeal.

[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.700]
I'm very honest.

[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.120]
I guess the voters didn't care

[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.080]
that I made all those big mouthful

[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.460]
cheese with squeal.

[00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.220]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.080]
Well, if you're honest with your public

[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.300]
and you tell them you had a final scream,

[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.420]
you'd rather me

[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:55.240]
than forgive you

[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:57.280]
like it did me tend to let you

[00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.500]
to the DOP

[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.780]
than to keep changing the song.

[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:04.200]
Pustamante, little Batman

[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.640]
Super Mario brother

[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.400]
never had a thrill.

[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:09.340]
You're terrible.

[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.340]
The voters start about to make it

[00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.700]
in his little Pac-Man on the way.

[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:17.140]
With his little teeny tiny holes

[00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.980]
on the Victor, I'm the winner

[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.460]
and my hot wife is a Kennedy.

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.680]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.980]
And now I'm done with corporate data

[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.440]
on the California G-Wall P.

[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.160]
1034, I love the way that ends.

[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.180]
1034 at 560 WQM.

[00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:38.180]
By the way, it's just end.

[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.860]
Something may have to change your travel plans.

[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.360]
The State Department has just issued

[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.900]
a new Iraq travel warning.

[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.600]
Oh, no!

[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.300]
Ready for that?

[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.780]
I hope I can get the money back on the track.

[00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:48.900]
Change your travel plans.

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.080]
The State Department says.

[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:55.480]
I mean, it just between Arnold

[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:56.280]
and all of this stuff,

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.120]
you just have to wonder,

[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:58.860]
is there any hope whatsoever?

[00:27:59.200 --> 00:27:59.360]
No.

[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.260]
I guess we must be really winning now

[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.260]
after this late is the attack.

[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.380]
Oh, listen, with 19 Americans killed yesterday,

[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.520]
including 16 soldiers,

[00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.300]
we must really be on a verge of a massive victory,

[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:08.720]
don't you think?

[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.400]
This must be a really good sign.

[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.160]
It's almost over.

[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.660]
Yeah, just like George Orwell in 1984,

[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.420]
good is bad, bad is good.

[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:16.420]
Keep it in mind.

[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.580]
Anyway, here's today's poll.

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.260]
To try to get you out of your doldrums,

[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.780]
okay, I know that everybody's very depressed

[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:24.720]
in South Florida.

[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.600]
Keep it in.

[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.460]
What person does this best describe

[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.080]
someone who used to be great

[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.000]
but is now a real piece of crap?

[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.780]
Could be an athlete, an actor, politician,

[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.840]
anybody, any well-known person.

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.160]
What person does this best describe

[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:41.540]
someone who used to be great

[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.160]
but is now a real piece of crap?

[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.080]
I put that, we got four on here so far.

[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:46.120]
I put Don Erick Lindross,

[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.440]
which if you're not a hockey fan,

[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.320]
you have no idea who he is.

[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:49.600]
If you know anything about hockey,

[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:50.500]
you know that he used to be great

[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:51.920]
and now, you know what he is, Scott?

[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.580]
A piece of crap.

[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.600]
A real piece of crap.

[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.720]
A Liz Taylor,

[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:56.680]
she used to be great,

[00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:57.320]
remember those days?

[00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.480]
Sure.

[00:28:58.820 --> 00:28:59.540]
It's a long time ago.

[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:00.360]
She was a great actor.

[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.520]
Everybody loved Liz Taylor.

[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.180]
They admired her.

[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.260]
And then she turned out to be

[00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:04.680]
a fat old drunk.

[00:29:05.540 --> 00:29:06.220]
Michael Jackson.

[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:07.520]
Now a lot of people will say,

[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.520]
oh yeah, we loved his music.

[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.240]
We loved bad.

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.540]
We loved all that good stuff.

[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.100]
And then he turned out to be a prevert.

[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.860]
And a lunatic.

[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:14.420]
Yeah.

[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.520]
And OJ Simpson,

[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.760]
who we thought everybody,

[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.300]
nobody didn't like OJ back in his football days.

[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.560]
And he was in all of them bad movies

[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:22.980]
and running through the damn airport

[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.520]
with his, it only hurts.

[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.820]
That's what he told Nicole and Ron

[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:26.840]
and only hurts for a little while.

[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:28.980]
So we got Erick Lindross,

[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.180]
Liz Taylor, Michael Jackson.

[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.800]
And OJ Simpson, to start out,

[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:32.960]
would ought to be a very impressive list.

[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:33.660]
I would think.

[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]
I got another possible one.

[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.120]
I have to take your word for it

[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:36.940]
that he used to be great.

[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:37.560]
Yeah.

[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.400]
Don I miss.

[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:40.080]
Don I miss.

[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:40.820]
This is excellent.

[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:41.560]
That's very good.

[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.480]
He did used to be great.

[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.760]
Well, you heard, uh, we were in

[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.240]
a big, it's just wonderful example of the great humor

[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.960]
he used to pump out when he was alive.

[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.060]
I mean, it's tough to be great when you're dead.

[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.940]
Oh, so when you had a brother on 15 times,

[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.640]
that, man, I, I got to, I got to be honest with you.

[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.880]
I'm not jealous of too many people,

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.200]
but I really am in awe.

[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.600]
I'm in shock and awe of the Iman.

[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.480]
It's just, this is a dead man in a chair with a,

[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.100]
stupid ass cowboy head on,

[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:07.960]
who sits there and they all fall on.

[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:08.820]
Oh, yes, I am.

[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.520]
You're right.

[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:09.980]
I am.

[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.260]
You know, especially that news guy,

[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.140]
whatever the hell his name is.

[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.740]
And he's, he's mumbled.

[00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:15.240]
Into the chest.

[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:15.600]
Yeah.

[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:18.200]
He makes Tom Broca sound like the great enunciator.

[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:19.500]
Man.

[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:21.320]
Three L.A.

[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.720]
Prep School students made sex video official saying,

[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.360]
of course, on issue, we want to know one thing.

[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.480]
Where do we see it?

[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.580]
Where do we send our money?

[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.200]
The teens who allegedly distributed

[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.720]
on the Sepulveda past campus have been expelled.

[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.340]
Damn it.

[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:34.280]
I thought they should give them like,

[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:35.700]
at least take a look at it first.

[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.080]
No, don't you think that will be so?

[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:39.300]
I'll give you a formal inquiry.

[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.320]
Maybe they have a budding career in store.

[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.340]
You could have it in query.

[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:44.160]
In a inquiry?

[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:46.420]
Three high school students, a sophomore girl

[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.260]
and two junior boys have been expelled from an

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.180]
exclusive prep school in the Sepulveda past in L.A.

[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:53.080]
for allegedly making a sexually explicit video

[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.520]
and distributing on school grounds.

[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.400]
The trio made the video last spring

[00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.740]
when the girl was still a freshman.

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.060]
I wonder if she was a true freshman.

[00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:02.360]
Said, ready, ruby, hooded,

[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.020]
the milk and community high school,

[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.800]
which is if we were able to even as wise temple.

[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.700]
Oh, down oh, that's you kids.

[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:10.320]
Oh, you're available.

[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:11.580]
At least we know they were circumspect.

[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.080]
She said none of the three had records

[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.080]
of disciplinary problems.

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:16.040]
Maybe they were just horny.

[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.580]
Parents and officials did not know that the video existed

[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.880]
until one student told his parents about seeing a copy

[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.660]
of it 10 days ago.

[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.220]
Rubel said.

[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.740]
Rubel who did not release the student's name's

[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.420]
or ages said two of the students in the video seemed

[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:27.500]
not to know that the recording

[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.280]
should be shown to anyone outside of a closed circle

[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.240]
or a friend's.

[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.800]
They seemed or they thought they were just doing it

[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.200]
for fun.

[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.660]
Rubel said and it showed up in school.

[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:36.320]
Damn it.

[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.680]
While only a few students admitted to have seen the video,

[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.780]
Rubel said most students said they had heard about it

[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:42.800]
and when can they see it?

[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.040]
Parents said they and their children were upset

[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:45.740]
with the revelations.

[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:46.980]
One parent who asked not to be named

[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.640]
said or son had chied away from telling her

[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:51.380]
much about the film because he knew I would be horrified.

[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.340]
Oh, don't tell me this is one of those

[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:55.240]
one in the pink and one of the stink videos.

[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:57.180]
Rotisserie.

[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:59.440]
Parents said they and their children were upset

[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.800]
with the show where the foster said that big gigantic

[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.680]
black instrument that's laying around the studio there

[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.380]
is a weapon of ass destruction.

[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.220]
One period of ass not to be named said or son had chied away

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.000]
or I just read that.

[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.020]
Rubel said she hadn't seen the recording

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:19.020]
and relied on other students to identify the teenagers

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:20.020]
who were allegedly involved.

[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.120]
All known copies of many stories she said,

[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.220]
oh that's what they always say.

[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:24.400]
Oops, here's another one.

[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:28.720]
All known copies of industry likely stir up those unknown copies.

[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:29.420]
Parents said they had seen the recording

[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:29.420]

[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.120]
and the parents expressed confidence in administration

[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.360]
and handled the incident appropriately.

[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.560]
I have so much respect for the school administration

[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:36.960]
said Jessica Satcher, whose son Danny is acquainted

[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.440]
with the students who were involved.

[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.680]
He said they were hung like a moose.

[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.140]
Counselors and experts will be invited to speak with students

[00:32:43.140 --> 00:32:45.280]
at the school and coming weeks to discuss issues involving

[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:46.540]
sex and relationships.

[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.760]
Rubel said she was worried the students were simply mimicking

[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.220]
what they see on TV.

[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.180]
There you go again without the benefit of an adult understanding

[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.180]
of what effect their actions might have on their dignity.

[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.140]
The students understand this is not acceptable

[00:32:58.140 --> 00:32:59.460]
but they think it's relatively harmless.

[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.180]
Well, there you go.

[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.680]
And maybe it was relatively harmless.

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.120]
You know what?

[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.660]
Were any animals harmed in the filming of this picture?

[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.620]
No, they're right there.

[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:07.920]
Was there like any blood and guts

[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.680]
and anybody snuffed off in the...

[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.060]
Oh, yeah.

[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.440]
Maybe somebody got off and nobody was snuffed off.

[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.020]
So there you go.

[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:14.900]
Again, American.

[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.800]
You can all bet on a shape about a bunch of kids just trying to have a good time.

[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:21.800]
We will be putting the locations where we can get copies of the tape

[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.900]
on our website, right?

[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:24.120]
Look at me.

[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.120]
Can you imagine the action we'd have on the screen?

[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:29.760]
There you go.

[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.020]
560560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.900]
What person does this best describe somebody who used to be great

[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:40.240]
but is now a real piece of crap?

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.100]
Line in local.

[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.060]
Here's sports radio 560CUAM.

[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.140]
UAM.

[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:48.500]
Okay.

[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.260]
How do you keep a horny rockweiler coming up in your leg?

[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.280]
Playboan.

[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:55.380]
Playboan.

[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:56.500]
That's right.

[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.520]
Playboan.

[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.000]
The magazine for dogs.

[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.720]
And our magazine just isn't about hot bitches in the heat either.

[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.580]
The best quality.

[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.800]
The story of the bad master.

[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.580]
You like it, Bobo?

[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:34.080]
Easy fella.

[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.280]
Get your paws off mine and get your own.

[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:37.960]
Bad Bobo.

[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:39.660]
Playboan.

[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.640]
Finally, a magazine for your best friend.

[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:43.600]
You're a dog.

[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.440]
Let me see those bitches in here.

[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:48.240]
Check out the centerboard.

[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.400]
Please.

[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.420]
Go away.

[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.480]
One of my magazines.

[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.540]
Bad Bobo.

[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:54.740]
No bad.

[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:54.820]
No bad.

[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:55.380]
No.

[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.120]
Good.

[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.440]
1044-560WQM.

[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.260]
This is a pretty good article.

[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:02.420]
This thing about talk without ditto's?

[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.800]
Yeah.

[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:03.360]
You're it.

[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:05.660]
By Jov Parish, a Seattle writer.

[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.200]
This was in a progressive report.

[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.620]
Thanks to whoever facts this in.

[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.900]
Talk without ditto's.

[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.960]
In other words, no ditto heads.

[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:12.860]
I'm not going to read it.

[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.760]
But it's just about the fact that was we all know.

[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:17.300]
The talk radio is dominated by right wing lunatics.

[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:21.300]
By Russia about Ali North and G-Gordon Litty.

[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.420]
And all the other right wing assholes.

[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.300]
Strong Hannity.

[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:28.780]
And it says just one paragraph with a handful of exceptions such talk radio meaning liberal talk radio

[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:31.300]
Essentially doesn't present exist and talks about this wealth

[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.740]
He should call a company that wants to put 10 million couple 10 million bucks up

[00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:39.020]
You follow what I just said no good anyway proposed national

[00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.020]
Network for a left of center commercial talk radio. They haven't called us yet. Have they no

[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.760]
Hey, when these people call Scott then you can call me okay

[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:52.260]
Don't call me when some assholes got a author with a book that wants to put on a show Jesus and norm stop calling here

[00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.260]
You jackass god damn it

[00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:59.260]
It says with a handful of exceptions liberal talk radio essentially doesn't the president exist

[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:04.660]
It's hard not to notice this aspect of modern American media not so much of avoid as a black hole

[00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:06.300]
That's what the what's his name said?

[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:12.920]
He said he's got a good one. There's not there's no widely heard syndicated national liberal talk at all on commercial stations

[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.280]
Only a handful of liberal hosts neo-rodgers in Miami

[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:23.740]
Bernie Ward and Ray Talfaro in San Francisco Mike Webin Seattle at the local level even then such host are buried on largely

[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:29.860]
Conservative stations sort of like tank company musical day and then throwing in the stones or 50 set at night and hoping for good ratings

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:32.600]
And then that's a good point even though this isn't a

[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:39.280]
Political topical station. He got sports crap all day long and then they throw into the liberal the Jew Fag for good ratings

[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.720]
Which they get and the goose is up the whole station?

[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.820]
So thanks again whoever sent this article because actually I'd like a little recognition there

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:51.500]
There you go the norm basically what it's saying is that everybody else is syndicated except for these are left-wing

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:55.700]
Comic-Pinco bastards like your client Neil a norm don't call here ever again

[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.360]
Here's an obvious one for the poll today and how could we have missed it?

[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:02.580]
You know are you sure positive Phil Henry?

[00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:09.700]
Right used to be great when I was turned into a real piece of crap and you are absolutely correct whoever facts that in what a shame

[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:19.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's hi. Ilya. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:25.160]
Hi Neil. Hi. I had a question for you and a nominee for that poll the question

[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:31.420]
What where can I get a copy of that Miami Dolphin song you played earlier can best an ear

[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.520]
It's on the best an eel this year. Yes, sir. Oh, it's on this years. You know it. All right. There you go

[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:42.900]
I just make room for right to our website near Rogers dot com and you can buy a best of the old right there in sunny

[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:47.620]
Okay, cool. I look like the novice tag Riley for that list Pat Riley used to be great now

[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.620]
He's a real piece of crap. He's still got nice hair

[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.660]
Thanks a lot, pali. Okay. Thank you, man Pat Riley

[00:37:55.500 --> 00:38:01.180]
How they've turned on Pat at least Pat listen to the show. He's the only sports type figure in all the South Florida

[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.880]
Well, no, I mean not the only one Ray Hudson remember his team sure Hudson's good

[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.960]
He loves the show and we had Ray Whitney anybody named Ray they like to show everybody else and Paul laws

[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:11.880]
Remember the loser. No

[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:19.720]
Well, I'm sure that Scott remembers Paul laws. Oh, no, you don't remember Paul laws from where from the Florida Panthers

[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.160]
You're some hockey fan man. You do you would know you're you and your buddy Scott man between the two of you

[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.420]
You wouldn't know a hockey puck if they stuffed up your intestines. I've been suffering with the Rangers for years

[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.480]
Oh cut the crap already waiting by the way

[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.220]
They're not gonna make the playoffs again as you're either the Rangers. It's just amazing to me

[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.940]
Talk about flushing money down a toilet and speaking of money George tells me

[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:44.900]
37,295 is still our total for abandon per rescue with our best and eel stuff and we didn't get a dime

[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.140]
On our website over the weekend. We had tremendous

[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.640]
Maybe a record breaking number of hits on the website over the weekend

[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.720]
But did we get a dime one purchase? Oh nothing they just hit the meal what they use they take they don't give

[00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.580]
Yeah, what kind of crap is that?

[00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:04.000]
That sounds like a communist bunch of crap to me the products are great

[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.360]
The products are great the CD is great, which you this guy just asked for something he likes and being there it is it's on there

[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.260]
The mohawar David and teaching whether you like him or not affect the lead the less you like him the more you want to have it right

[00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:22.360]
And we got the all this other stuff on her we got cups and

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.780]
Saucers and flying saucers whatever you want curfew flying saucers

[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.520]
God damn it

[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:37.200]
Royal family out of touch says the poll in London eight out of ten Britain's age 16 to 24 believe the Royal family is out of touch and over

[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.740]
Prillage but good for the tourist industry a British poll

[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:46.100]
I love it the ICM poll for the news of the world published yesterday surveyed about a

[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:52.520]
500 young people by telephone the margin of area to although 81% thought the Royal family was good for tier or tourism nearly

[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:57.060]
60% said they wouldn't cross the road to see the Queen if she came to visit their town

[00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:03.020]
If I cross the road I see lot of Queens in fact, I don't even have to cross the road. I can just look at the mirror

[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.280]
Only 10% thought the royals were important to their life

[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:11.840]
But 79% thought they were good for charities and 71% believe they gave Britain prestige abroad

[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:16.380]
Now you're wrong about that all they do is make us laugh that much more and how silly you people are

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:21.960]
Ask which royals said good examples 88% named Prince William the Queen's scored

[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:30.800]
69% 69 and Prince Harry and Princess and 68% Prince Charles was a 55% because he's a Philanderer and because come up

[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.720]
Camilla Parker bulls as ugly as dog poop. She does

[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:41.160]
She poops like a dog the pool of she squats the poll was conducted late October just days after it's held on memory

[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:43.360]
I don't know that by Paul Burrell

[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.500]
Michael Mayo's got this great collar. I'm gonna read it

[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.340]
But I guess I'll take some calls first because we want to build up some names on the pool

[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.000]
We got to fill in me and pat Riley added to the original list

[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:55.040]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello

[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.320]
Hello, yes

[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:00.160]
Hollywood's what I hear

[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:01.960]
my Tyson

[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.260]
Mike Tyson and

[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.040]
I'm so

[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:11.380]
Then it's it one one per customer not and also okay my old old old friend. What was he great?

[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:17.040]
Uh, you remember Jack Johnson. No, no seriously. He remembers Jack Dempsey

[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:19.120]
and Jean Ty and

[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.060]
Max Schmeling in fact this guy's probably not smelling too good at this point of his life

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.600]
I don't think we're gonna put Mike Tyson on it. He was never

[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:26.920]
great

[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.720]
At anything it was never a great box here. He was never great anything. It was certainly never great first

[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.380]
He was always a scumbag. He proved the old adage once a scumbag always a scumbag

[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:43.980]
I guess I better hold on this okay. I'm voting for Eric Lindross being the big hockey fan that I am because I was thinking about that yesterday

[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:46.120]
He used to be I mean so great

[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:51.920]
In his early season with a flyers after they got him from there after he refused to go play with a Quebec Nordic

[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:53.560]
Which proved that he was a dick

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:58.260]
Because he's just a real in his parents van. Oh, geez who'd like to who would want to put up with him

[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:02.600]
Never sign anybody whose parents are in his agent, right?

[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:06.900]
But Todd Morinavitch is dead. Why like Todd Morinavitch is dead

[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.460]
Todd Morinavitch. Yeah, he was the uh kid who was raised to be a quarterback from day one

[00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.740]
I know I know who that is yeah, I never knew that how about Pete stoie and a vitch

[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:21.420]
Who's the uh basketball player who's dead who played for LSU Pete um

[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.660]
Meravitch right

[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.740]
What do he die from do you remember Pete Meravitch pistol Pete?

[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.420]
Pistol Pete Meravitch he's dead. I don't remember from what whoa

[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.600]
What

[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:39.700]
I don't think so which person do you does this describe the best someone who used to be great but now is a piece of crap

[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.360]
OJ has got 11

[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:47.020]
I see now you know he's gonna win and now that was a Georgia's fault you put him on there. Sorry, but you're right

[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.500]
No, you're you're right everybody loved OJ

[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:55.040]
And now everybody with a brain hates him because he murdered two people and he's a scumbag in a liar and

[00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:00.080]
All the other stories there every time you turn around there's OJ and trouble again. I didn't vote for it

[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:06.460]
No, I didn't either. I voted for Eric Lindrow's on the one vote 24 votes. OJ's got 11 Phil Henry six Phil Henry's got six

[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:06.900]
Okay

[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:11.720]
Michael Jackson for Liz Taylor one Eric Lindrow's one pet Riley one. Oh Howard Stern

[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:16.360]
Now what who put Howard Stern on there? We never even mentioned him. Oh, it's on your fax machine now

[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.060]
What do you mean? I'm just working ahead

[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.120]
I used to be great and now he's a piece of crap

[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:27.760]
That's what I heard. Why do you say now he's a piece of crap? What about his a faxer said? I just faxed it to you

[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:32.200]
Well, that doesn't mean we're gonna put it on just because some faxer said we discussed these things first and right off the bat

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.040]
You're setting them off the Eric and why can't he used to be great, but I can't remember when that was

[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:42.200]
No, seriously, I don't want Howard Stern on there. He's not a piece of crap. I think you don't like the show

[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.940]
I don't listen to a show and you don't like it

[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:48.260]
But that doesn't mean he's a piece of crap. He sure takes everybody else's ass and just about every marketing

[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.000]
Zim whether you like him or not. I think it's a piece of crap

[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.320]
Oh, well, I don't care what you think you already got your one vote. You got OJ man

[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.580]
Maybe we can introduce Howard to OJ

[00:43:59.500 --> 00:43:59.860]
Okay

[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.460]
Let's give OJ a blonde wig that might solve your problem

[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.340]
Oh, here's the facts Craig and Miami says Howard Stern used to be great now. He's now seen now. He's marginal at best

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.300]
But it doesn't say now. He's a piece of crap

[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.380]
I can't go along with it. Get him off of there Eric and don't pay any attention

[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:20.820]
What George says most of you hear me say it unless I articulated and enunciated kind of like Don I miss who enunciated

[00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:23.920]
Little like this. I think I bit my tongue

[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.700]
Which makes it gonna make me talk like I miss it. Maybe I can make that kind of money

[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.000]
Here's the Mike Mayo column let my Miami take the Marlon's foolish bait. That's too long

[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:38.760]
I'll do it after the top of the hour because we got all these commercials. You know we got commercials and commercials like her goal

[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.960]
I'm used to say from her best hey Neil what's wrong with my commercials? Oh

[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:48.960]
Boy, I'm gonna write that book you were talking about you know in fact. I got several books. I'm working on right now get going

[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.720]
All right. Here's a lady in for Lauderdale. Hello

[00:44:53.240 --> 00:45:01.060]
Hi there. Hello there. How about a local guy in sports? I'm surprised. No one has called about him Wayne. I think I

[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.880]
Well, when did I know you're you're right. Yeah, I was gonna say when was he great but in the beginning you're right

[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:10.720]
We're looking he brought he brought hockey to us

[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.100]
I mean that can bring hockey down here. I have to be a hero in life

[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.820]
He was bringing everything to South Florida

[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.940]
Marlon's right. I mean the best to the worst. I mean I'm a huge hockey fan

[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:24.680]
I see you at the games all the time and I

[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.620]
We love those panthers that

[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:31.760]
You happen to be much nicer in person than you are on on the radio. Well, this is just a

[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:36.440]
But I don't want to tell anyone that I don't want to show I keep telling them that it's just a radio show

[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.520]
I have to be a well-gun

[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:42.920]
You're it's a matter of luck you might be too nice. Oh, I'm sorry while I try being asked you next time I come to a game

[00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:47.220]
Okay, all right. I don't want to keep you there's so many more folks that want to get on your show

[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:51.300]
But I enjoy it very much choice. Thanks. We don't have a great day

[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:56.800]
Go Panthers go leave go go Panthers penguins will be here in Toronto tomorrow night anybody go to that game

[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.300]
No, there'll be the 18 eight to be 19,000 in some standing remotely

[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.480]
Mirio. I don't think it's gonna be planned. He's injured

[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:07.500]
Again, they're again. Well kind of like Nick Antropov. He's professionally injured all the time

[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:11.400]
But he sure looks pretty good 1056 at 560 QAM

[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.520]

All right at two o'clock two to four to seven noon too much off time man

Read it all over your body

[00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:10.020]
61 votes what person is this best described somebody used to be great, but it's now a real piece of crap

[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.480]
Oh jays got how many he got about third man exactly

[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.740]
Phil Henry 14 are you sure

[00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:21.440]
Michael Jackson 10 Eric Lindross three there we go. We got a few sports of people are hockey people

[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:28.000]
Pat Raleigh appear Liz Taylor to none yet for Don I miss or H Wayne high zinga come on

[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:32.300]
She had a good choice there maybe just went on you think I got another one for you

[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:36.240]
That used to be great not just because he would write about me

[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:42.380]
But because he actually paid attention to what was happening on the market and about radio and now he's a real piece of crap time jica

[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:45.620]
Right, mm-hmm. I think that's a good good choice

[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:51.700]
He just got lazy. He doesn't carry rights all these puff pieces about network tv shows and basically that's all he writes

[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:56.680]
And whether his ass is sitting there or I want of his highly paid and dined and winded

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.580]
Press tours in L.A. wherever the hell he is

[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.880]
He's always out of touch with a local market because he doesn't really think about it other than Rick Sanchez coming back on a year

[00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:11.420]
And don't put him on there because even before we hit that guy to stadium who's still dead he was never great rich Sanchez no

[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:13.440]
Unless he has Tom

[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.360]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Oh, yeah, sir. Yeah, let me just mine

[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.100]
But I

[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.980]
Not Riley, but I got another one to complete so I'll call and pow well

[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:33.080]
Colin Powell is good very good choice. Yeah, well, I get back to work, man. Just one more thing. Let me see your aunt

[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:41.860]
Oh, don't say that to condolese it then we'll have all kinds of problems again. No, condolese. They don't have no aunt either

[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:47.420]
No, it's an art bark. No, I think she's got like a penis. I really do. I think condolese has got a big old art president

[00:49:47.420 --> 00:49:54.420]
She has an artwork with a penis and of course, uh, Ann Coulter. She's got a gigantic strap on that makes

[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.280]
I'm going to win significance big black one

[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:01.940]
five six seven I got to read the hang on a second on the phones Mike Mayo

[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:05.060]
Nice going Michael Mayo because I know he listened to the show

[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:09.640]
Take a little advice from me. Don't wait all year to write this column and he wrote it today

[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:15.140]
See or yesterday whenever it held was led Miami take the Marlins foolish bait is what he says

[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.700]
Mania and Marlins mainly know all world series champions are now

[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:24.720]
Let me reiterate for the thousandth time how morally repugnant it is for public money to go toward the private enrichment of

[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.580]
Millionaire athletes and mega millionaire owners

[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:34.620]
That said let me repeat my mantra when it comes to the suckers in Miami data new Marlins stadium if they're buying I'm driving

[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:40.320]
Except that they're serious about an orange bullseye, which is only a masochist could love then my mantra will be

[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.080]
Pass the chips and the remote please

[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:48.400]
If the politicians and populace to the south are vain enough to fall hook line and sinker for this latest fish pitch

[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:53.920]
Willing to give away the store just to see the team renamed Miami marlins by all means they should build it better than that us

[00:50:54.780 --> 00:51:00.280]
Broward fans might want a new stadium closer to home, but there's little political will for it for once we can be proud of our elected officials

[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:06.440]
Why might my me day leaders were busy cozy up to the marlins in baske in the reflected glory of an improbable title run

[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.900]
Our strength police state at a chilly distance maybe we should call him the my me date marlins

[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:17.020]
This might have something to do with the way the counties last euphoria field sports deal went when Broward

[00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.600]
Gleefully financed the panthers

[00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:23.120]
185 million dollar hockey arena sunrise during the teams run of the stand-in cup finals in

[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.400]
1996 seems like a lifetime ago

[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:30.420]
Public funds pay for 69 there's that number again 69% of the arena's

[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:37.620]
14 and a half million dollar annual debt repayment eight million dollars comes from a hotel bed tax two million from the state sales tax rebate

[00:51:37.620 --> 00:51:40.780]
The teams four and a half million dollars share comes from arena revenues

[00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:41.700]
meanwhile

[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:48.640]
Five years into the 30-year deal the panthers have gotten to keep 99.4% of the 54 million dollar profit

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:55.100]
Generated by the arena so much for a public private partnership as the deal was touted and just look at where it's gotten the team

[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:59.740]
Even with this golden goose the panthers think there were tendons things and they're a hemorrhaging cash

[00:52:00.460 --> 00:52:03.000]
How does this translate for the marlins buyer beware?

[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.900]
New stadiums might be good for subsidizing wealthy owners and players in sports that have insane economics

[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:11.840]
But they don't guarantee long-term success in the stands or the standings

[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:18.000]
Just ask the heat or the panthers or the baseball teams that have not been magically transformed by glirry news surroundings

[00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:20.260]
Detroit Milwaukee Pittsburgh and so on

[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.960]
So it's hilarious how the mommy politicians can't accommodate the team fast enough

[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.120]
Meanwhile, this latest plans has more holes than a fishnet

[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.640]
Forget the fancivil members being thrown around it. Let's talk reality

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.800]
The marlins water retractable roof stadium which little likely caused four hundred million dollars

[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:39.040]
And I'd like a home on star island about an respect a one else to pay for it

[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:44.900]
The marlins are pledging future revenues to partly fund the construction and return to expect virtually all the profits

[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.940]
It's just like the panthers deal only with bigger numbers and more question marks

[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:54.200]
The debt repayment on a bond issue for four hundred million dollars would be roughly 30 million a year for 30 years

[00:52:54.940 --> 00:53:01.520]
At this point the parties haven't specified where most of the money would come from although the usual targets would be hit hotel bed taxes

[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:03.680]
State sales tax rebate

[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.960]
Expect the politicians to pull a fast one especially with date sitting on a surplus from its county sales tax

[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.600]
That money is supposed to go to transportation in roads

[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.800]
Don't be surprised if they commissioned magically labels the stadium a mass transit vehicle because it has escalators and a moving roof

[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.900]
In a perfect world the marlins would build their own stadium in a reasonable world

[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.020]
Everyone could pitch in to build a modest stadium in logical location

[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.620]
In this world we have underpaid teachers

[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:32.860]
Student sitting in portables and lame brain politicians eager to siphon public money to those who needed the least

[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.720]
Meanwhile when someone asked baseball commissioner bud C. Ligwad league doesn't have a central stadium fund

[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.260]
He says we're not of a construction business. Why should we be?

[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:46.980]
Miami marlins never sounded so good says Mike male Mike nice go and we take it all back come back home

[00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:49.780]
It's safe. Okay the coast is clear good article great article

[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:52.540]
Yeah, huh and he didn't waste all the time

[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:57.400]
He didn't like take weeks and weeks and weeks and kind of let the dust clear so it would be politically acceptable to write it

[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:02.360]
He took less than a week after his fond and con from last to Tuesday whatever it was nice go and Mike

[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:05.000]
Mio there's one good Jewish boy. Oh, hold the male

[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:07.260]
Moscow it's whatever. He'll his name is

[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.760]
Okay, so there's a little reading for you where I've got a lot of stuff here

[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.300]
website porn website porn attracts women by the millions

[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:19.820]
Black support for Miriam elephant is crumbling all right some good news

[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.640]

[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.180]
From

[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.000]
People

[00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:31.980]
Charlton haston

[00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:34.200]
Charlton has to his excellent

[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.160]
And your phone sucks but Charlton has to go thank you sir

[00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.640]
Well, I can't help but he had a crappy phone. He meant well, and he had a good choice right Chuck has to

[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:49.660]
Nobody didn't like Chuck has to know. I mean after all he was like Moses and God and Jesus and Abraham and Saul and

[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:51.860]
Sarah and all those people, huh?

[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:55.660]
And now he's a gun toatin nut and if you watch bowling for colabine

[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.800]
You'll have to watch that interview with him at least many many times

[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.780]
Because you'll be squeezing yourself every time you watch and then when he gets up and he like he I would say walks away

[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:12.400]
He like shuffles away, huh? He shuffles. He does the old-south be shuffles and just shuffles away and tries to like run and hide and

[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.360]
Michael Moore is following him and but what about this little girl?

[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.160]
Yeah, just like all the people who are dying every day

[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:25.640]
I want to say it again in Iraq 19 Americans that yesterday 16 soldiers who thought they were going home

[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:29.160]
For a little R&R and guess what they're coming home. I'll write in a box

[00:55:30.060 --> 00:55:35.380]
Where's the anger? Where's the outcry? Are we gonna? Is it gonna take like years and years like in Vietnam all over again?

[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:41.980]
Because the public is being buffaloed by the by the gutless media and by the slimy Democrats who except for Howard Dean

[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:47.280]
Most of them don't really have the balls. Although now of course it's becoming politically correct now to start open up a mouth

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.660]
Give hard and carry it some of the others. How could this be going on in West Park who now claims he was against it all along?

[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.260]
Howard Dean's only the one guy with the balls. I'll tell you that right now

[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:59.480]
Is he perfect? No. Is there any imperfect? No

[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:01.800]
Howard Dean be the man

[00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:09.400]
Here's the call from Newport Virginia. Hello. Hey, no. How you doing? Hey, I don't know if you consider him great

[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:15.720]
But I used to enjoy his show on HBO, but now he's a right-wing whore and a piece of crap Dennis Miller

[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.740]
Dennis Miller used to be okay

[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:23.880]
Right and now you're right now. He's more than a piece of crap. I see him. I get annoyed. I get very I get outraged

[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:27.760]
Yeah, he's a sad case now, but that's that's my contribution

[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.220]
Okay, thanks a lot, pali and have a great day

[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:34.400]
Dennis Miller, I wouldn't say he was great, but I mean, you know, I'm when we say used to be great

[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.140]
He was good. He was there was people like way. Yeah, he was okay

[00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:40.260]
He was an okay a stand-up comic and now he's a piece of crap

[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:46.160]
Now he's just a shield for every anti-human right-wing piece of smegma man for peace of mung and the new pool

[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:52.420]
By the way for the first time a slight majority over 51% American public says we don't like the way Bush is doing a rack

[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:56.060]
We're not too happy and that pull was taken before the 19 the people died yesterday

[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:03.820]
I hate to say it and but but we're in a cragmire man. There ain't no easy way out there. Maybe no way out period

[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.280]
Oh, the week three Cazise says in an interview. I should also point out

[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.400]
That guess what just like all your wacky scientists had said

[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:16.480]
They never wore any met weapons of mass destruction

[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:22.200]
Yeah, I have nothing and Sodom was lying and posturing as usual to try to like uh

[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:27.000]
Boy embolden his influence in the Arab world and get everybody else intimidated and puff himself up

[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.020]
But they didn't have crap no more. Nope

[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:33.220]
How do you like that? They wanted it, but they didn't have it. No

[00:57:33.740 --> 00:57:37.520]
But they have these shoulder shoulder propelled rockets now, right?

[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.920]
As you saw yesterday when they had knocked one but two to take out that helicopter

[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:46.800]
And they got by the way thousands of those. Yeah cheap and thousands right

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:54.500]
Sure makes you feel real good every time you hop aboard a plane a commercial jet and they report anywhere in the country, right?

[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:59.400]
Because so we already know that they are hoping and praying and to try and they've tried it

[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.980]
Where was it they tried in Saudi Arabia right a few months ago?

[00:58:02.620 --> 00:58:03.740]
Okay, and missed

[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:10.260]
Saudi Arabia that's our good friends. They've been lodgings in the Saudis who have those public executions where they chop people's head off in public

[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.220]
Thank goodness they're not barbaric like the Taliban. Wish we could get that kind of coverage over here

[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.080]
Those evil doers the Taliban

[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:19.000]
12 minutes after 11 at 5 60 WQM

[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.640]
Hey won't be long now before all the relatives come down for the holidays or maybe your parents are coming down to stay for the winter

[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.620]
That's the number four dial amatrus the mattress industry is full of phony clean shell gains vs. artist at

[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:41.820]
The dial amatrus no false promises no bait and switch just discount prices every day on the great brand names that you know and trust and love now

[00:58:41.820 --> 00:58:45.960]
Including stirons and bananas foster when you call dial amatrus at 1 800 mattress

[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:51.120]
You still get to pick the day and time for delivery within any to our window seven days a week from 8 in the morning till 10 at night

[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.960]
Which means like between noon and 2 1 and 3 whatever it's convenient for you and guess what they actually show up

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:59:00.340]
I've been sleeping on the mattress and dial amatrus for years my back is doing great and you ought to be doing the same

[00:59:00.340 --> 00:59:06.360]
Honest sale prices fantastic service every day low prices same day delivery and preset up and moveable

[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:10.000]
It's easy to see why dial amatrus is ranked number one in customer satisfaction

[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:15.260]
So don't get fooled don't get sucked in by these so-called giants in the mattress industry or furnish your stores

[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:17.740]
They can't match what you get every day from dial amatrus

Let's do it tomorrow morning at the beginning of the show runoff

[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:11.140]
We'll do a runoff a vote a poll between OG and Mohawir David

[01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:15.100]
Okay, start to think that's a good one sure because they both are

[01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:19.620]
So universally despised and reviled by the people of South Florida

[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:24.320]
I think that could be a good battle neck and neck nose to nose like a firm to the alley guard. Oh and GW though

[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.560]
No, no, no, well this crowd hates him

[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:29.040]
No, no kidding

[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.020]
No, Schmidt. Oh, it's big enough of that. There was rumspelled making the tour yesterday

[01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:39.180]
The preserve my image and try to polish it up a little bit the rumspelled tour on all the talking head shows

[01:01:39.180 --> 01:01:43.440]
What does he say about the incident yesterday the incident about the all the bloodshed

[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:49.440]
He says oh while you know we're in a war and these things will happen Schmidt happens that was a really a very

[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.040]
very sympathetic and a very empathetic kind of a thing for him to say since his lily white god damn ass

[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.880]
Not only is no better, but never how was over there in combat

[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:04.980]
Well, and they're showing it again on CNN the guy who shot his lure because he was pissed off the galore hiding behind the tree

[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:10.040]
That was uh and the amazing part that was in the courthouse where the robber plate guy here. He was going on

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.640]
How do you like that? They didn't even pause

[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.240]
Now they just kept on going. Oh shooting

[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:17.700]
Call us when something really happens

[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.300]
Here's your call from Miami. Hello

[01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:22.660]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir

[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:31.120]
Back in 1998 when I first used to start listening to you was great and now it seems like yeah, this is this is the chronic guy

[01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:33.160]
Yet it yeah, it is get lost

[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:38.800]
Get a life. Okay, get a life. Yeah, now it seems like you're only listening and calling every single day

[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.760]
What we have here is a failure to educate. That's what we have a real moron. Okay

[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.540]
You already had a chance to bash me all weekend long. I can take it

[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.340]
But that's the you know used to be great now a piece of crap

[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.420]
See it doesn't make any sense because if I'm a piece of crap and you're listening

[01:02:52.420 --> 01:02:57.400]
Then it's a really sad commentary about you and your lack of education your lack of common sense

[01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:02.700]
Your lack of being able to reach over and find the god damn dial to get your hand on that knob listening to the call

[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:10.280]
Yeah, listening and calling every single god damn day over and over and over again like this show is your own personal play to it

[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.320]
See this is the problem with a chronic some of them may be a little amusing at times

[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.600]
It adds a little spice to the show

[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:19.180]
But there are some of them who think like your friend Reverend Jones and a couple of others

[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:24.480]
Let this radio show is their own personal little play toy just like those little that little group of circles your cool

[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.740]
You know the ones I'm talking about. Yeah, we discovered this show when we came to QA and all of us said

[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:33.660]
Well, it's my responsibility to put on a show for my friends for Miami. Yeah, it's their intercom system

[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:36.600]
Right, that's right. They're own little personal play to it

[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.640]
And they're sitting there with a radio cranked up real real loud and they're playing with it

[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:43.040]
God get a life you crazy sparks are you

[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.700]
Here's for a lot of deal. Hello Neil God. Yes, sir. That was probably OJ's boyfriend. Yes, sir

[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.440]
I'm gonna be traveling on Wednesday

[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:56.180]
So I wanted to wish you first of all an early happy birthday. Thank you so much and

[01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:02.120]
Actually had my initial instinct for the for the nomination for the pole was Brock Berlin

[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.720]
But then I realized he was never great

[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:07.460]
So my actual nomination is Pete Rose

[01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:12.720]
Well, that's good. That is really excellent. Oh, I mean, I mean he was mr. baseball

[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.440]
I mean, I mean Charlie hustle the whole thing. I mean he was the only Mr. Piece of crap

[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:20.200]
You're right. He's the most sour like a bitter man. I mean, you know

[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.340]
Plus if you ever saw him at the race track, you'd wonder is this man needs some help did we need to be correct this guy or what?

[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.900]
I'm not using it. All right

[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.460]
Thanks a lot, palmy

[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:33.720]
I just don't want to say this though because Wednesday will be my 61st birthday in November 5 and

[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:38.120]
You get to a certain point. I think 60 is a good point of which we stop saying happy birthday anymore

[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:45.400]
How about like my condolences my commissaration? It's not happy crappy birthday because yeah crappy birthday

[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.820]
I like that because

[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:51.420]
Like my mother says to me to me. Oh, what can I get you for your birthday?

[01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:58.020]
Coffee. Yeah, how about a colostomy bag would be good mom. Oh, and listen to this. I want the entire audience to get the news

[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.540]
My brother who's nine years older than I am so the math ain't too difficult. Uh-huh

[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:06.820]
He was in town visiting her for four days last week. Okay, okay

[01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:11.380]
So my mother and I says this to me on a phone the other day very excitedly and what does she have to tell me?

[01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:16.580]
Been four days he was there. He only had a bowel movement the last day

[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.040]
I'm not making that up. Oh my god

[01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.260]
And I wonder if during all of his attempts to have a bm

[01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:26.480]
I wonder if she was standing outside the door waiting to hear the old

[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:31.280]
Plopplop fizz fizz, you know, yeah, like she used to do it. Oh my god

[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.480]
I know you have irritable bowel because every time you do a bm it splashes the water is so loud now

[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:42.320]
This is a woman who claims to be like a little deaf. She's 90 years old plus. Yeah, maybe she doesn't know how she must be standing with a glass

[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.320]
You know a glass against the right listening to hear those magical sounds of the good's hitting the water

[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:54.960]
I think she's got the room wired. So I think next time I come I'm gonna have to find out not only how would the quality and consistency of my brother's bm

[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:58.240]
But also did they float or did they sink stuff like that

[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:05.040]
Nobody wants to hear about bowel movements bomb. That's her claim to fame my 90 years of constipation by milley

[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:11.300]
Oh, it's gonna be a couple that's the book that you write right? I couldn't believe it. I mean even coming from her

[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:15.660]

We were talking about something completely different and he calls to give me a lecture about how why do we rip Jerry Lewis?

[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:21.420]
And we don't like him. That's why on this show. It's like one of those things. Oh, there's the guy again

[01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:28.720]

Wow, that was impressive and they're showing it for the eight million time they identify him as William striered pocket and

[01:07:59.140 --> 01:08:05.320]
Remember he had two guns in there. So it's such an ominous thing and it was ominous. It was so close. I know I think we're watching

[01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:11.540]

Well if he got it I showed his insurance in the tea room. He said it was no big deal

[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:57.140]

Shave it a haircut two bits

But the tax code penalized marriage

[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:42.460]
And so we reduced the marriage penalty

[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.640]
Yeah, there you go. How about the gay marriage penalty? That's still going good

[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.320]

Hi Neil. How are you?

[01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:27.540]
Okay

[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:29.860]
You got to nominate John McCain, peer list

[01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.500]
John McCain

[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.720]
John McCain, yeah. He's too much of a wait-and-will Republican

[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:37.740]
John McCain is the right-winger

[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:40.460]
He's the coming one because he endorses Bush

[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:41.820]
Okay

[01:21:41.820 --> 01:21:44.020]
I see no

[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:45.560]
Yeah

[01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:48.960]
He endorses Bush. He's a Republican man. What do you want him to do?

[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:51.420]
Yeah, pretty weak

[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:55.520]
567, okay we'll put everybody on it who's a Republican? How's that?

[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:58.960]
Although their only problem is they don't qualify because most of them didn't used to be great

[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:00.380]
Like this one

[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.440]
Means more jobs

[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:05.000]
Right, there you go. Means more jobs baby

[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:09.100]

[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:12.720]
Here's a call from poppinow. Hello

Hey, how you doing?

[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:14.700]
Pretty good sir

[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:20.020]
Let me tell you something. There's one thing you're not going to hear coming from the Dolphins locker room anytime soon

[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.840]
And you know what that is?

[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:21.720]
What is that?

[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:24.260]
Like a old friend Jimmy Johnson once said

[01:22:24.260 --> 01:22:25.980]
HAPPY GAME SOMIN

[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.940]
I thought he was going to say we got a shot

[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:32.740]
We're number one

[01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:39.420]
Or that or anything else like we're super we're talking super bull cause where that you know that I could play the song game

[01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.300]
But they hated they were number two yesterday

[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:46.120]
Come make song came in a strong second in the songs that they never want to hear you in Robin Williams

[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.620]
Oh, that's good. I like that

[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:48.740]
Sure

[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:54.280]
Robin Williams used to be great then he started making a series of them awful awful horrible movies

[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:59.860]
Especially that patch Adam's thing with a big shiny red nose and everybody said are you effing kid?

[01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:06.440]
Nus or what? Are you out of your mind? Are you off your rocker? This is supposed to be comedy. This is supposed to be talent

[01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.620]
Robin freaking Williams excellent choice. Thank you

[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.680]
Web site porn attracts women by the millions

[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:20.780]
This flies in the face of all the stereotypes that it's only horny guys, heterosexual guys and faggots

[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:26.080]
Who are sitting there on that their PCs just tap it and tap it and tap it away and on her keyboard too

[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:38.100]
After putting her daughter to bed Maggie 42 routinely sat at her computer for hours mesmerized by an online world of erotic stories and real-time sexual discussions

[01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:45.480]
Beth 33 usually clicked on the most visually graphic sites describing the theory that only men are enticed by pornography

[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.660]
A lot of people don't realize this happens with women too says Beth

[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:56.000]
Along with Maggie asked if their last name's not be revealed I can't imagine why I bet you screw and spending a lot of time on it

[01:23:58.140 --> 01:24:04.340]
See I she don't she don't read her come she just mounts the mouse she mounts the mouse

[01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:12.740]
She never ride it right at the Roseland Park in Canada they would call the wild mouse and screw and loves her mountain the wild mouse

[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.660]
She likes to ride it

[01:24:15.500 --> 01:24:21.140]
The myth began long ago press because women were rarely seen walking into CD adult bookstores oh god forbid

[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:28.500]
But in recent years the accessibility affordability and anonymity of the Internet have made pornography undeniably attractive to millions of women

[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:34.700]
While some women simply find it exciting others have battled addictions and other problems they're addicted to porn

[01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:34.900]
I don't know

[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:45.500]
Now look the next the next paragraph in this story what is this from it's from the Cleveland dot com new house new service

[01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:53.400]
The next paragraph got all these like it's all screwed up you know I mean like a percentage sign like every other word

[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:00.540]
Julie neft twenty nine of Wisconsin sees nothing but benefits Internet pornography is pretty much an adjunct to my regular sex life she said

[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:04.940]
She has to make she views less than an hour a week and is open about with her boyfriend

[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:13.480]
They estimate that 9.4 million women in the US access such sites in September we email each other saying

[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:26.560]
Ha ha look at this or he he look at that or ooh that's good ooh that's good it's healthy if you want to own the mechanics or the logistics of certain things you can get education inspiration to do stuff plus I just find it brilliant I like it

[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:33.440]
Others think it can lead to problems there's some events the Internet porn is learning even women whose values are positive well

[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:41.240]
I thought I'll loosen them up a little bit good some speculative forbidden fruit factor can make it tantalizing for religious women in particular good watch out for that forbidden fruit

[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:54.100]
The editors of today's Christian woman and evangelical magazine had heard anecdotes of church going women getting hooked on porno so they conducted a survey asking readers of their newsletter if they had intentionally visited porn sites

[01:25:54.100 --> 01:26:03.340]
34% said how do you like that they said oh god that's good while the frequency of female porn addiction is difficult to measure

[01:26:03.340 --> 01:26:09.380]
Psychologist agree that some women as well as men do engage in destructively compulsive behavior fueled by the Internet

[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:17.340]
Maggie said she began exploring pornography to try to understand what it was that captivated her ex-husband soon she was spending up to 30 hours a week

[01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.600]
About 30 minutes chirping the web for a rousal that's like four hours and a half a day

[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:28.760]
She realized she had a serious problem when I couldn't wait for my daughter to go to sleep so I could hop on it and the computer too

[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:38.180]
The light went on that I preferred porn to spending time with my child was better than the less of your kid I guess in it I guess the interactivity the Internet makes it especially appealing to some women

[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:45.900]
Said al-Kupery staff psychologists at Stanford author of sex and the Internet a guidebook for clinicians we see women all the time

[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:51.360]
I mean I feel that attractive but they get guys 20 going after them at a time in a chat room email them instantly

[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:58.320]
All right no wait a minute they get 20 guys or maybe they're guys are 20 years old going after them at a time in a chat room emailing them instantly

[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:05.140]
That's affirming to a woman that's hard to match when your husband is in the next room drinking a beer maybe asking you if you're going to exercise next week because you think you're overweight

[01:27:05.140 --> 01:27:08.440]
And maybe you are maybe you're a big fat slut maybe you've gone to pot

[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:17.360]
When a woman prefers cyber sex to real sex oh I love that word cyber sex to real sex or become secretive about her online porn or use those are red fat flags

[01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:25.340]
Said Cooper but it contains an online erotic can be helpful if you share this with your partner because you need some variety to waste spice things up

[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:31.420]
As opposed to going to a swing club with George and getting all kinds of diseases nobody ever caught no disease on the Internet

[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:34.180]
Oh viruses viruses yeah

[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.580]
While porn oh may rounds a couple's interest for a while real men with real real real women with real

[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:46.480]
Varicals veins and a real body fat lose in the end because they can't compete with the image of airbrush porn queens said Donna rice use president

[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:50.280]
Of enough is enough an organization trying to make the Internet safer for families

[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:51.100]
Oh

[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.660]
Porno sells sex without relationships sex without commitment sex without consequences sex without love sex without children and sex for one's own

[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:06.520]
Radiification is opposed to the gratification of the other to which we say all right said rice who's who's oh this is you know who this is Donna

[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:14.260]
Rice Hughes oh yeah this is Donna rice who's any seven relationship with former Senator Gary Hart Democratic Colorado and it is presidential campaign

[01:28:14.260 --> 01:28:17.620]
So she's become born again now okay this flandering bitch

[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:22.980]
This miserable see you next time slut she got religion

[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:30.000]
Well you just fact me even in pages here yeah we had a rock on what is this that's terrible

[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:39.980]
Then we're fan of mimie says I don't think there's a vertical example of your poll that Dan Marino well what's wrong with Danny boy he was even on the CBS special last night talking through those funky lips

[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:47.020]
By the way you had two lions Danny and you blew one of them he blew it don't put Dan Marino on air to what what the hell's wrong with Danny boy

[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.620]
They're just jealous because he don't have them big teeth like your way here

[01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:54.920]
Here's one that says my suggestion for Eddie Murphy

[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:59.440]
Oh that's good Eddie Murphy used to be very funny we like that he Murphy and then once he got caught with that

[01:28:59.440 --> 01:29:03.980]
Transsexual or transvested a whatever was in the car then all of a sudden he turned into an asshole

[01:29:04.820 --> 01:29:09.180]
And it also says crappy birthday advance thank you George Lucas

The following is a paid public service announcement from the International Raffle Association

[01:32:30.020 --> 01:32:33.400]
Let's face most of us will never be rich hell

[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.420]
We probably won't even be successful and that's pretty damn depressing

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:39.860]
But as usual with every problem there is a solution

[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:43.800]
Hi, I'm Jim and I'm here to tell you a little something about handguns

[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:48.120]
They scared their shit out of people and intimidate them and in giving you whatever you want

[01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:56.200]
That's right handguns think about it. Need some cash from a bank. Don't have enough money for fear all the convenience store

[01:32:56.200 --> 01:33:02.540]
Takes chips and pretzels wire at it. It's all free if you've got a handgun some son of a bitch cheating on your girlfriend

[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:06.220]
Kill him to simple solution of life's complex problems

[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:10.340]
All I have to do is wait the five days for it and happiness is just around the corner

[01:33:10.340 --> 01:33:12.980]
Well, if you don't want to wait the five days who cares?

[01:33:13.520 --> 01:33:18.720]
Buy the damn thing off the street just buy a lot of handguns. It's a great alternative to working problems out

[01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:24.080]
And be considered a population control. Yes handguns. They just might make you famous

[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:31.320]
cover one at five sixty double. I didn't play the annuna one there

[01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:36.580]
How this is who might want you know one right huh? It's never too late. I don't want to do it

[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:40.660]
Of course as governor Graham will not seek reelection in 2004. They just put it on CNN

[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:45.540]
Bobby Graham is announcing today that he is not gonna seek reelection to a fourth term

[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:51.920]
And he was he is stepping down man. He's had it his BDI's are rolling around. He's loaded with cash like Bob Graham

[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.440]
It's too bad. He's got no personality

[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:57.940]
He didn't have a whole lot of money behind him and nobody knows who the hell he is outside of Florida

[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:01.020]
But nevertheless he told it like it was all along

[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:02.800]
He was he was one of the guys with balls

[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:08.060]
He's one of the few Florida politicians. We can be proud of who went to balls to say hey, this is a pile of crap

[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.880]
And you were on terror is a bunch of crap and not doing the right things and you were like, you know wagon the old dog

[01:34:16.480 --> 01:34:21.080]
Speaking of that black support for elephant is crumbling all right. That's good news

[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:26.900]
At the opening of the African American Research Center October 2002 can it actually be new already?

[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.440]
You know most days we say can it is it only like new right and

[01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:34.400]
Now it's new and this thing is zooming on by god damn it. It's way we like it

[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:42.380]
Let's place some bits at the opening of the African African American Research Center in October 2002 residents cheered in supportive and battle supervisor of elections

[01:34:42.380 --> 01:34:50.140]
Miriam elephant brown County's only black elected official a year later, meaning now hardly anyone in the black community is supporting elephant good

[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:56.940]
It's about time you dark folks came to your senses and by the way not only will dark folks not be allowed own guns from now on but also not telephones

[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:03.820]
Early on Miriam had a very strong black support stronger than estimated some County commissioner Joseph Joseph

[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.180]
Ego what is kind of a name is Joseph

[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:11.000]
Joseph is a Galaton that's a Bible name no Schmidt

[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:16.580]
They were willing to stand up and go to war even with Democrats however since then black support is waned

[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:21.420]
And Gillette I don't I never saw that name before my life eGG

[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:28.520]
ELLE T I O N once a staunch supporter of the election supervisor said he and others could no longer defend elephant because she is

[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.940]
Refused good political advice and couldn't explain the recent firings in her office to their satisfaction

[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:35.640]
He said people embrace Miriam as their child

[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:38.160]
But when it comes to the point when a child will not listen to you

[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.080]
You have to let that child learn a hard way in other words when in doubt kick him out

[01:35:41.980 --> 01:35:46.540]
Publicly sides formed along racial lines creating a riff that remains elephant became a symbol of racial pride

[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.440]
Against the crush of white criticism

[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:52.060]
Blacks bristle went out of commissioners of tacture and public it appears now

[01:35:52.060 --> 01:35:57.400]
There's a large group of influential black people against her said e Pat Larkins a Pomato Beach Commissioner

[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.640]
And there's a group of non-influential black people to support her because they still think it's a racial thing

[01:36:01.640 --> 01:36:07.620]
It's not a racial thing. She's in top of it. Do you understand? You get it? She's in competent non-cop is penis man

[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:09.080]
She can't cut the mustard

[01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.780]
God how about those 80,000 ballots that never got set out to voters in brown

[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.160]
How about the people that got like a whole bunch of extra ballot?

[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.380]
30 mail just in case they want a few vote a few extra times

[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:25.160]
Well, those people just take their extra ballot mail it to the people that didn't get theirs. I'd just give it to us

[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:25.680]
We'll take her

[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:31.460]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:36:31.460 --> 01:36:34.800]
What person is this best described someone who used to be great?

[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:41.700]
But is now a real piece of crap can be like an athlete an actor politician a douchebag what it is whatever you like

[01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.160]
Here's the call from Pompano. Hello. Hi Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. I got a good one for you

[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:51.920]
Someone who used to be great, but it's now a real piece of crap. That was it

[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:54.860]
Ted Nugent he used to be great

[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.940]
You go back in the 70s man

[01:36:56.940 --> 01:37:00.400]
He was the best and now he's on the board of directors for the NRA

[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:02.620]
Yeah, now he's the right-wing asshole exactly

[01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:07.420]
Okay, good one he always was you know thanks pal. He always was what a right-wing asshole

[01:37:07.420 --> 01:37:08.980]
Yeah, we didn't know that don't see

[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:12.140]
We didn't know that much about him. He's talking about musically

[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.800]
He used to be great and then he turned it away

[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:17.040]
It's like Dennis Miller. He may have always been a right-wing asshole

[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.620]
But he just didn't open his pus about it and

[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:25.500]
Now he's just turned it away a walking ad for the bushmeister and the fascism is what Dennis Miller is and tenu-jent too

[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:30.700]
They're always on a bad wagon. You know always showing up at these functions stuff like that

[01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:35.800]
Don't worry, doc. His rumspelled says hey, it's war crap hat shut up

[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:41.940]
Yeah, that's right. That's a great answer to the question Donnie you idiot you not see bastard you hairman gearing junior

[01:37:42.520 --> 01:37:46.600]
I think it's here. I'm carrying with bad glasses is it with a same guy reincarnation?

[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:49.720]
Here's the call from Kendall. Hello

[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:51.600]
Hello, yes, sir

[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.600]
Neil how about David Letterman?

[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:59.320]
David Letterman is a good choice. He's for his ratings are dropper like a rock

[01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:04.680]
And thank you David Letterman's a good choice in fact there's a big several big articles

[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:07.140]
I didn't bother with it because it's yeah media trivia

[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:12.560]
But Jay Leno was kicking his ass and I'm gonna tell you something when Jay Leno kicks you rest you know

[01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:18.320]
You've got big problems and they're the excuses from CB as well. We got a week 10 to 11 lineup all this other crap

[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:19.900]
I

[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.560]
Know it makes a difference, but I'll say this to because both of them follow the the evening news

[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:26.180]
So it seems to me correctly if I'm wrong

[01:38:26.180 --> 01:38:31.620]
But it seems to me if there's a program that you like they have these amazing things called remote controls that even people who live in the

[01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:32.840]
Tenements have got remote controls

[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:37.180]
Right right yeah, that's right. We don't have tenements them in to get a

[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:41.420]
We get told they got remote controls even down there at Caracas that time where they had like the little

[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:45.700]
Tinshacks with the TV antenna on top how much of they got a remote because they sure live in a remote place

[01:38:47.640 --> 01:38:51.180]
So if you want to change the channel. It's really easy. Just click it man. Why?

[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:03.120]
Don't like that real TV. I'm playing baggage cells and lost luggage. I like that city confidential on any

[01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:07.380]
It's a good show the only thing is that guy bugs me the narrator because he sounds just like Vincent Price

[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:10.800]
And it's not of course because he's been dead a long time and I know the guy's name, but I can't think of it

[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.720]
Yeah, you should rather I'd rather listen to him than Wolf Blitzkrieg. It's a vital you yeah, get out of here man

[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.880]
I hate him. Don't you he he looks like another member of the abund

[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.160]
Wolf Blitzkrieg I guarantee he's got one of them cards in his wallet

[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:31.600]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line oh bad news for the bush liquors too

[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:37.840]
State of California says Bush ignored fire plea they say the officials warned him of a tender box

[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:45.260]
California officials accused the Bush administration of ignoring urgent pleas months ago for emergency help to remove beetle

[01:39:45.260 --> 01:39:49.700]
infested trees that experts weren't confused a catastrophic Southern California fire

[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:55.840]
The US Senate passed controversial legislation last Thursday allowing the thinning of force across the West and another

[01:39:55.840 --> 01:40:01.400]
Debater up that over whether dire warnings about a bark beetle infestation were ignored in Washington in April

[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.560]
Governor Gaye Davis requested 430 million dollars to move on healthy trees on

[01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:12.380]
415 thousand acres of force for the request for emergency funds went unanswered until last week and then was denied denied

[01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:13.040]
You ready?

[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:17.540]
I'm ready there was reason the governor requested the declaration said

[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:23.080]
Gaye Davis spokesman Steve McViglio and I'm sure there are a lot of families without homes who are disappointed that it wasn't approved

[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:31.000]
Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer speaking in the California and the Senate on Thursday's debate on the healthy forest bill complained that President Bush had failed to act on the state's

[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.640]
Request for help and that now Californians were suffering

[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.640]
We named three of the four counties that are up and smoking we begged him to declare disaster

[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:43.440]
We begged him we saw this coming a mile away the bill passed 80 to 14 out that have to stay burned out

[01:40:44.700 --> 01:40:45.540]
You ready for that?

[01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:46.200]
Uh-huh

[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:52.800]
For more than a year California officials are afraid that about an infestation of native beetles that drilled into trees mostly pine and fur

[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:57.600]
They feast on bark and carry a fungus that blocks the trees vascular system from carrying water

[01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:04.320]
Did you know a tree had a vascular system? Yes, I did I didn't know that sure a vascular system like a tree's got a heart. Yep

[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:06.120]
Come on

[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:08.400]
Yeah, can you can you hear it beating?

[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:14.980]
Artichokes never eating an artichoke heart. Yeah, say there. Well, I'll be damn. I feel bad now

[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:19.900]
Healthy trees normally can reject the beetles, but the bugs are geography. I love artichokes in Italy

[01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:24.680]
Man those those greasers manage you know how to cook you know yeah, they can cook up anything

[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:29.700]
Healthy trees normally can reject the beetles, but the bugs have thrived because of a four-year drought as we can

[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:32.800]
Thou's the trees in Southern California leaving them brittle tender well

[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.320]
I used to be brittle tender now they're just ashes probably

[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.820]
How do you like that? So once again this president just you know not not on top of it. Sleep at the switch

[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:43.860]
Two busy kilonewton people

[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:50.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 t and for rise and wireless line

[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:55.920]
Let me say it again when is the public ever in American gonna finally get mad? How many of these tragedies like yesterday?

[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:58.000]
How many more American kids have to die?

[01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:06.140]
Before the public finally starts getting pissed off and says hey, this is like desi who all over again. This is like Vietnam

[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.580]
We didn't know what the hell we were doing there

[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:11.700]
And we sure as hell don't know what they were doing in Iraq because it was all based on

[01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:15.460]
Predicated on a bunch of lies and it was all planned before 9-11 anyway

[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.560]
Think about it and then get back to your sitcoms. Here's Miami. Hello

[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:29.300]
Yeah, and reality shows yesterday. Hey fantastic. You got good to talk you've been listening for years

[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:33.820]
Oh, yeah, I've been incredible. You do a good job. It's a good job too

[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:41.200]
I guess the point I wanted to make was in regards to the guys dying overseas. It's just incredible that the country does nothing

[01:42:41.700 --> 01:42:44.700]
Mm-hmm everybody's quiet. You don't hear any talk about it

[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:50.680]
They're just desensitized of violence and death and destruction. They don't give a crap as long as it's not somebody they know or care about

[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.840]
They don't seem to give a crap they just accept it and

[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:55.560]
Secondly

[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:02.140]
For the band and tech rescue how come they don't keep the CDs with them when they do it all some games

[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:03.680]
Who's they?

[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.100]
I don't guys it's a Q. I.m. I went up to the booth and spoke to somebody and

[01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:14.860]
And said that surprisingly Neil is so popular, but we don't have any of the CDs

[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.180]
Well, wait a minute. They said what?

[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.320]
There was I don't know it wasn't one of the broadcasters. I might have been somebody helping out

[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:30.940]
He said surprisingly Neil is still popular, but we don't have the CDs. Yeah, he's no surprisingly Neil is so popular. Oh, I see

[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:36.500]
Like I guess maybe a couple of people all this sides me had asked if they had any CDs with him

[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:44.820]
Well, that that you don't understand that would mean that some other part of the radio station was interesting to helping us out and they're not

[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:45.920]
It's not

[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:49.860]
Confedated. Yeah, I mean, it's like you you know you make the station

[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:54.340]
Without you without you and George. I don't think I'd be listening

[01:43:54.340 --> 01:43:58.100]
They can just shut it off and turn the key and a lock. That's right incredible

[01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:00.040]
Thank you. It's already a great read once said to me

[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:03.040]
When I first after a few months on the station he said before you came here

[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:06.040]
We didn't have any ratings actually said that which is kind of a dumb thing to say

[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:10.100]
Well, what do you expect from Greg something dumb? I mean why would you say that to somebody?

[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:13.220]
It's like oh, how much you want you want five million ten million whatever you want

[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:18.080]
So let's work on it by the way we don't have new copy Troy Stratford is he on vacation or something

[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.520]

[01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:46.840]
My foot is gonna be up most of the record in that joint

[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.780]
Especially the salespeople and that's for ran course in her case, you know, everything else has been in there

[01:44:52.300 --> 01:44:53.540]
Why not not my foot?

[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.740]
What are you can't complain about the job they're doing because they're not doing any and that's all of them all of them

[01:48:40.860 --> 01:48:42.100]
There it is

[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:46.080]
I guarantee you guarantee you shaped like this

[01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.120]

We love you PR Ralph even Ola Jordan George likes to him but all the other four weekends

[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:05.840]
I can't find George. I like the weekends. That's because all the spigs they all hate each other

[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.320]
You know, it's one of them things like the Jews the orthodox and the conservative to reform

[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:14.820]
Well, look at that pigeon brush. I wish I had like a pea shooter like Ted Williams used to have a VB gun. Yeah

[01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:16.900]
Of course, I probably have to break the glass

[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:22.740]
108 votes man. Oh, Jay. They despise you. He's got exactly double next to the competitor

[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:27.460]
Which person best describes that somebody who used to be great, but is now a piece of

[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:31.240]
Crap speaking of that a lot of crap going around today going down

[01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:36.060]
OJ 108 Michael Jackson 54 and that incredible exactly double

[01:49:36.700 --> 01:49:39.260]
Phil Henry's got 40 doing pretty good. Okay

[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.460]
Dennis Miller 26 Wayne Highsenga 17 Chuck Heston 16

[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:46.740]
15 for Colin Powell. He's rolling and he's lying

[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:52.580]

[01:49:53.140 --> 01:49:53.720]

Jerry Lewis five list Taylor five Eddie Murphy five time jikers got four

[01:49:59.780 --> 01:50:04.940]
Tom green three David Letterman Pete Rose George Lucas and Don Amistue. Yeah, remember the facts

[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:08.100]
Oh, what's George Lucas goes on here. He'll go zooming by OJ

[01:50:08.100 --> 01:50:09.760]
Right. He's all the way up to two vote

[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:15.020]
Robin Williams won Michael Douglas and Ted Nugin have got the big

[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:16.420]
None so far

[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:20.540]
I'll want you people to watch Oprah. I got some very out warning for you

[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.460]
Yeah, feeling stressed unable to cope perhaps you should turn off your TV so this says

[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.600]
According to a new study

[01:50:28.140 --> 01:50:33.180]
Fans of the Oprah Winfrey show have higher stress levels than those who are not fans. You ready for that? Oh, I believe it

[01:50:33.180 --> 01:50:36.480]
I told you that yeah, it's enough to make you puke

[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:42.200]
According to the study five percent of the countries that held population or nine million people said they feel so much stress

[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.700]
They can no longer cope half of those said they're fans of the Oprah show

[01:50:46.860 --> 01:50:52.320]
Do you watch Oprah? Yes, and I'm stressed out. Yes, but I'm not overly stressed. No, I'm still stressed out

[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:54.240]
No, I'm not overly stressed. That was the question

[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:59.980]
Then be the questions the study was commissioned by Hale Duaskin author of the Sedona method

[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:03.700]
Which offers readers methods to relieve anxiety and preparation for the release of his book

[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:05.760]
According to a news release announcing the study

[01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:11.960]
Either watching Oprah leads to anxiety or severely stressed Americans are drawn to work to look for solutions

[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:18.180]
Under show he said in the release however most likely conclusion we can make is that people who seek out Oprah her life a firming TV

[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:21.440]
Are probably just more aware open honest with their motions right? Yeah

[01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:31.880]
The study also found that 76 percent of fans of the Oprah show said they wish their lives were calmer almost 20 percent higher than non fans

[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:38.620]
Fans of the Oprah show were also twice as likely as non-fans to say they were unable to cope with a stress in their lives

[01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:40.060]
So maybe they can turn on Dr. Phil

[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:44.520]
Yeah, sure he coat that'll do it and he can he can bitch him out

[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.180]
I ever see him together with judge Judy same person

[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:52.220]
5670560 see that's what that's what I told you this the other day

[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:58.420]
That's where it's at bitching people out. That's what America loves watching somebody else get in bitched out because for once it's not them

[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:02.540]
No matter what it's for for being fat for being unfaithful for me

[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:08.380]
Whatever they want to see somebody else just get in bitched out and get in stand in the back and humiliated and treat the like crap

[01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:09.680]
Because at least it's not them

[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:15.260]
And with that in mind aren't we cursed down here a curse it

[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.700]
Here's a call from Hollywood hello

[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.620]
Yes, sir

[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:23.420]
How you doing sir

[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:29.920]
Get Clark oh

[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:31.280]
Outstanding

[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:36.400]
You the last one isn't he is a major asshole thanks a lot of pilots a good choice

[01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.200]
He must have seen bowling for Columbine

[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:40.680]
Dick Clark nobody didn't like dick

[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.120]
And then all of a sudden we found out from Michael Moore thing good to see my I don't care what anybody says

[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:48.380]
I'd vote for Michael Moore 50 times

[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:53.260]
Really this guy of course he would never get in because he's not you know

[01:52:53.260 --> 01:52:56.940]
He's not owned they don't have all the strings attached him like they have all these other damn

[01:52:57.340 --> 01:53:01.620]
He's too frumpy no no he's not too frumpy. He's just he's too unconnected

[01:53:01.620 --> 01:53:06.880]
He's not owned by the big corporations. He doesn't have to answer to anybody which is exactly what we need what we want

[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:15.040]
I don't care whether it's a Wesley Clark who's just hand picked by the Clintons and then that gang of people you know and

[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:21.640]
And any of them except for Howard Dean who seems to be like at least a little and of course Gavhart the unions are pulling all of his strings

[01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:25.000]
Plus in effect you talk about wimpy. Oh, man

[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:29.200]
Dick Gavhart would be like another Michael Duke caucus in Walter Mondale

[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.100]
It would be like just saying okay. Why bother wasting your money on election

[01:53:32.100 --> 01:53:34.680]
That's what we just we just can see the feet

[01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:36.440]
We throw into tell

[01:53:37.900 --> 01:53:41.540]
We forfeit the game right? Oh, yeah

[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:50.060]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we're looking at this tobey dodge inventing a rack pulls and help out here for the Russians the French and the Germans were

[01:53:50.060 --> 01:53:55.800]
They were asked to help contribute troops and financially and they turned the US down

[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.720]
That's certainly the case

[01:53:56.720 --> 01:54:01.820]
There's a lot of bad feeling about about how the war was launched about how the u.a. At the trouble at the u.n

[01:54:01.820 --> 01:54:06.160]
But now now that the war is over and now that there's clearly a lot of problems

[01:54:06.580 --> 01:54:09.600]
I think the French and the Germans are going to have to be asked again

[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:15.640]
But you're going to have to bring in the United Nations much more sensually to allow other countries to pull in let's take another cross

[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:29.080]
But there's got to be something more than

[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:33.480]
Geez although like she said if she could just have a good one once a week she'd be ecstatic

[01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:36.780]
Possibly she'd be a happy camper just one really good one once a week

[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:39.680]

[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:08.720]
Well, that'll be my contribution. You have to admit that's the biggest uh, biggest chore every day, right?

[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.500]
Coming up with something new and interesting

[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:15.220]
In fact, Eric what Eric ought to be doing in the spare time since this is not one of those that we're gonna change today

[02:06:16.460 --> 02:06:19.400]
Maybe we ought to like go back here. We've done over a thousand polls now

[02:06:20.940 --> 02:06:25.540]
Yeah, we started doing right and we ought to like start rehashing some of the old ones

[02:06:25.540 --> 02:06:29.840]
I'm not talking about the demographic surveys or really, you know, we do those like once a year

[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:32.960]
So they said to Ellie on the back some of the stuff we haven't done in a coon's age

[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:39.840]
Right, right? Ellie and Gonzalez send it back keeping here. Yeah, Ellie and Gonzalez. What do you think? Should we keep them here?

[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:40.800]
No, she was sending back?

[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:41.360]
Yeah

[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:44.280]
Ellie and Gonzalez and what about the Pope?

[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:45.720]
What about it?

[02:06:45.840 --> 02:06:47.440]
Ellie on in the Pope table. Let me go to hold

[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:53.360]
21 till one at five sixty WQA. And who I think of this thing is zooming along today

[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:57.280]
So I always the phone is starting to like really a slack off pretty bad

[02:06:57.280 --> 02:07:00.560]
So that's why I'm starting to talk a lot more slowly now good

[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:03.660]
Well approaching wins they approaching that birthday man

[02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:09.520]
If anybody would have told me you're gonna still be doing this crap on your sixty one. I just said, oh yeah

[02:07:09.520 --> 02:07:14.500]
Mama speaking your mama what if you want to ask John or Dave what they want for your birthday

[02:07:18.820 --> 02:07:21.180]
How about my Peruvian friend here

[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:22.340]
Huh?

[02:07:22.600 --> 02:07:25.180]
I just want to ask everybody a present for my birthday

[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:29.980]
Certainly. I think what I'll probably do is take a friend to a Ruth Chris for my birthday once in a house

[02:07:29.980 --> 02:07:32.240]
That's uh and I'll buy time

[02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:37.780]
See I'm not I'm not one of those people. I don't want presents. I don't expect from anybody else. I'm a giver man

[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:39.960]
Well too bad. I'm a giver not a receiver

[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:42.600]
Oh trust me when I tell you all the pain. No

[02:07:42.600 --> 02:07:44.900]
No, oh god. No

[02:07:45.340 --> 02:07:49.460]
Why you're laughing, but that's your bag man. You want to inflict on all these poor women

[02:07:50.100 --> 02:07:55.860]
Just because your wife keeps turning you down just because your wife keeps turning down. I know how you like trying to avoid hearing that

[02:07:55.860 --> 02:07:57.840]
touchy. I

I guess not. Does she? What? I'm not talking about that you don't you don't make babies by sticking it there man

[02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:11.500]
I'll say that right now in fact. Nope. Scott drama diaphragm. Okay. Yeah, I'm a little bit of diaphragm and try to instruct him because he seems to be having trouble lately

[02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:14.720]
Finger ring it out. I should have stayed the course. I wouldn't be in this. Yeah, that's right if you

[02:08:18.260 --> 02:08:18.900]

[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:09.980]
I never realized

[02:11:09.980 --> 02:11:12.380]
What a thin piece of crappy news

[02:11:12.380 --> 02:11:15.460]

Whether you're liking it or not

[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:28.240]
I understand a lot of long faces down there

[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:29.280]
Oh gee

[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.700]
Well we're cursed here

[02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:31.480]
We're cursed

[02:11:32.160 --> 02:11:33.480]
Just ball games okay

[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:35.620]
If that's what your whole life is revolved around

[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:36.580]
How about a revolver

[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:38.360]
That sounds like a good idea to me

[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:39.440]
A little Russian relic can't hurt

[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:40.400]
Right, here's all curses

[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:42.700]
I have an idea what you're not going to like

[02:11:42.700 --> 02:11:44.240]
Because of course you do the show every now and then

[02:11:44.700 --> 02:11:47.220]
Wednesdays this week on Mushroomit Canon in one to two hours

[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:48.680]
All right

[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.440]
Well I'm looking at the stats page here

[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:52.160]
Which you know I'm a big student of all of this crap

[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:53.760]
Which you probably usually doesn't mean anything

[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:54.560]
But the nevertheless

[02:11:56.240 --> 02:12:00.360]
And Wednesday is two days and third days are really huge on our website

[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:00.940]
Okay

[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.320]
And Wednesday now Monday is the weakest

[02:12:03.320 --> 02:12:05.020]
Which you know that and then Friday is

[02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:07.400]
And the reason being that it's the beginning and end of the week

[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:07.920]
Okay

[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:08.780]
Always

[02:12:08.780 --> 02:12:11.020]
But Wednesday there's a lag

[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:13.980]
In the number of hits and pages all of that stuff

[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:15.420]
Not not huge

[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:16.880]
But enough to make you say

[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:18.100]
Hey that's a cop out

[02:12:18.100 --> 02:12:19.400]
We're not doing our job man

[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:22.140]
Four hours that they to get paid the kind of money that you and George are making

[02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:23.180]
Oh you anyway

[02:12:23.180 --> 02:12:24.020]
And Scott

[02:12:25.780 --> 02:12:27.180]
So I mean you know

[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:29.260]
Doing three hours and then playing a bunch of comedy

[02:12:29.260 --> 02:12:31.420]
But that was okay to carry over when you were like

[02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:32.540]
Daughtering and you know

[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:33.700]
But that feel pretty good now

[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:35.220]
You know plus Wednesday be my birthday

[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:35.920]
That's right

[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:38.260]
And I want to give everybody a new audience

[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:39.180]
How many we got left

[02:12:39.180 --> 02:12:40.360]
About third man

[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:41.680]
A chance to call us and say

[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:43.560]
Hey you know crappy birthday or whatever

[02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:44.460]
Up your ass

[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:45.680]
Whatever they like to say you know

[02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.500]
Because they're not very loving and warm and kind like I am

[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:49.400]
And generous

[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.160]
We got a mini open lines on the board which shocks me because there should be many many more names for this poll today

[02:12:55.720 --> 02:12:57.580]

Yes sir

[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:07.680]
Here's someone who used to be great and dropped off the face of the earth

[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:08.420]
Who's that?

[02:13:08.820 --> 02:13:09.860]
Morale, Bosch wrong

[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:14.220]
No he didn't drop off of the face of the earth. He won't erase it the flambore last night

[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:15.220]
Ah I didn't see

[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:16.400]
He's here in Toronto, eh

[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:18.360]
I don't think he's allowed back in the country

[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:19.560]
No and not in the US

[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:23.340]
But he used to be great at someone the whole program at Hazel Park

[02:13:23.340 --> 02:13:27.680]
He uh he got banded Pompato Park and boy it takes a lot to get banned there man

[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:30.360]
Anybody would let Mickey McNickel back in was that to you

[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:31.060]
You know

[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:34.920]
Okay, no more harness racing talk Joe Mars Jr.'s God

[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:39.520]

[02:13:39.520 --> 02:13:39.860]
No

[02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:43.760]
Who comes to trivial crap? I'm telling you I got him all licked

[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:44.920]
I got him licked

[02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:48.760]

Pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:57.320]
Maybe in the last hour of existing seems to be we've reached the uh end of it

[02:13:57.320 --> 02:13:59.500]
Maybe we got to do a poll on the Wednesday one to two hour

[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:00.900]
Okay

[02:14:00.900 --> 02:14:02.260]
To me kills the poll

[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:06.020]
Oh, that would have been for Eric changing the poll at one o'clock to think he can handle that

[02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:06.700]
Well don't do it today

[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:10.360]
No in fact Eric didn't know you know you rip him all the time because you hit him like poison

[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:10.620]
Ah

[02:14:10.620 --> 02:14:14.020]
And he doesn't want to be and he doesn't want to be associated with anybody like you

[02:14:14.020 --> 02:14:16.180]
Well no you you're a good match because you both hate each other

[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.900]
Don't say why do you say that I say it because it's true that

[02:14:20.900 --> 02:14:25.860]
Your honest Joe and you just are tired of being brought all the closet all the time whether it's Rick Raleigh

[02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:30.280]
Eric where it is you lie so much it's not funny about what all of the above

[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:33.800]
No, they're gonna matter a thousand away. Maybe not Rick Raleigh

[02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:39.120]
But certainly Eric I don't hate you but that's what he thinks you think you're like an idiot. Yeah, okay, so

[02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:46.080]
Anyway, he did a really nice thing on our website. Have you noticed on the bedtime stories?

[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:52.200]
The new format he created told me over the weekend in fact over the weekend the stories were the the um

[02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:55.100]
Teases for the stories were like extra long

[02:14:56.160 --> 02:15:00.140]
Because he was in the process of making a change and if you look at them now they're nice and concise

[02:15:00.140 --> 02:15:06.120]
Yeah, and you can scan through the stories much easier. Am I nice going Eric? It looks beautiful. See that pretty

[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:09.940]
Yeah, you know what I'm no none. That's just pretty. It's just more convenient

[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:14.900]
For seeing what the headlines are and then picking and choosing which ones are interesting new which ones you want to read

[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.340]
So what we'll do between one and two is decide the fate ultimately will I mean we've done it before

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:25.040]
But now that I'm considering Schmidt canning it and just doing a regular four-hour show

[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:27.640]
I'm sure that muffin clearance will hold on it. Oh, yeah

[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:32.840]
You're right on that deal just like the seven months. I didn't take any calls between the two of them guys. There is it one nut

[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.000]
I mean at least John Crocken Tom Green. At least those guys have one nut

[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.580]
You know what but between muff and clearance there isn't even a little teeny tiny bevy

[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:45.980]
Because during the seven months I stopped taking the calls and you know as well as I do the reason I stop taking the calls

[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:51.600]
Is because we when they stuck us on nine to one that was the death now not that the calls were ever great

[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:53.380]
But that was the end of the show basically

[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:57.220]
So thank the Lord do we got tended to back

[02:15:57.820 --> 02:16:02.900]
Because they created a format there that was never gonna work nobody starts a show at nine o'clock in the morning

[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:07.600]
Unless they do like nine to noon which sounds good to me

[02:16:08.520 --> 02:16:08.920]
Fies

[02:16:10.600 --> 02:16:15.280]
Man nine to noon sounds great when they blow them all out and you're for all I mean blow them

[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:21.320]
Huh whenever good for all six to nine we're nine to noon mad dog into three Humper three to six per pro

[02:16:21.320 --> 02:16:26.220]
You know anything after six the big oh, I think that's the catch me out baby

[02:16:26.620 --> 02:16:30.360]
Then that way they can salvage the word you'll never believe what Norma can't say to me on a phone

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.820]
You know the day Friday when he called which I don't want to talk to him

[02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:38.940]
He said this half seriously. He says oh you want me to get together with Greg and extend your contract another two years

[02:16:41.220 --> 02:16:45.960]
He this is my attorney okay my agent my close personal fact friend

[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:47.520]
Norma can't say it's the name

[02:16:50.800 --> 02:16:54.080]
Now you know what's gonna happen? They'll call me nine say oh did I hear you?

[02:16:54.180 --> 02:16:57.360]
I heard a rumor that you said you wanted me to call Greg and get your contract extended

[02:16:58.100 --> 02:16:59.600]
They norm extend this

[02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:00.900]
You idiot

[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:03.900]
Here's a lady in Hollywood hello

[02:17:10.140 --> 02:17:11.900]
Is this really a lady?

[02:17:12.380 --> 02:17:19.020]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a lady. Well, yes, you're so quick to judge. You probably think it was Reverend Jones

[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:22.980]
I didn't say that. He's on the wrong side. Here's the call from Hollywood. Hello

[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.780]
You have the intelligence you won't be working here would you?

[02:17:26.300 --> 02:17:28.160]
There you go. Oh nothing to your dad

[02:17:29.000 --> 02:17:30.980]
In case we need thank you much

[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:34.480]
What do you say we're talking to his daughter I think

[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:41.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60 I have no idea what that was pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[02:17:41.820 --> 02:17:45.720]
No, I told you the calls are great man. Let's stick with that one to two hour

[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.680]
That's another reason that we like it not just this is like an easy, you know hump in the middle of the week

[02:17:51.100 --> 02:17:55.180]
Get us over the hump but it also but I'll put it up to the audience and I'll tell you right now

[02:17:55.180 --> 02:17:59.760]
Because usually I pay no attention to whatever they say whatever the verdict of the audience will be on that pool

[02:17:59.760 --> 02:18:03.400]
Which I'll write up during the break at that point will abide by it right

[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:06.060]
Sure, whatever you say although if we don't like the result

[02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:10.180]

Absolutely

[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:30.280]
He said yesterday he said

[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.280]
Somebody made the initial hit and didn't even correct himself

[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:37.580]
Is he an idiot yes, yes, anyway

[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:42.980]
I said you want to hit it, no it's not the word. I think it's initials the word he's looking for

[02:18:42.980 --> 02:18:47.620]
Man, don't be corrected to mullman. Okay. He forgot all the right words. You might be doing a drive-by pretty soon

[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:58.540]
56705 60 you see it's good timing because this other pool or just aren't that many people that they think used to be great

[02:18:58.540 --> 02:19:03.380]
But have turned into a bunch of crap, you know, and I think we got all the important ones on there already right every time

[02:19:03.380 --> 02:19:09.140]
You think that we've got them all though somebody surprises like what like some of these names on the like Dick Clark

[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:14.320]

Well, no because you see Scott doesn't realize that when he's trying to talk to me in the intercom

[02:25:09.980 --> 02:25:15.360]
The audio of the the program is so much louder. I can just barely hear him mumbling in the back

[02:25:15.360 --> 02:25:21.640]
You know see I can't turn he could disable that but huh he could talk to you. I don't have the ability to do that

[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:27.100]
He does oh, no, no, no, don't give him to do that because once he does that then I'll never get the program back

[02:25:27.100 --> 02:25:33.680]
No, you won't no so so just you know let him walk or chew gum. They'll try to give him to do both at the same time

[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:38.640]
So he's giving me a whole side as well. Oh, Eric's internet connection is down. He can't do this and he can't do that

[02:25:38.640 --> 02:25:40.300]

But all of a sudden magically it just all of a sudden just like that

[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.140]
Came back just like magic the question is yes

[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:55.440]
What's your take on Neil's idea of getting rid of the Wednesday when a two-comedy that's out for you sound awful fruity today, you know

[02:25:56.220 --> 02:26:00.360]
That's a secret. You know what is when you read no, I just noticed it

[02:26:00.360 --> 02:26:03.820]
No, no listen to me when you when you talk you sound like just like a guy

[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:08.160]
But when you read you you put on this you know, I'm saying Scott you hear it

[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:09.500]
Yeah

[02:26:10.380 --> 02:26:16.500]
Exactly you put on the fake thing only choose a different fake voice because the fake voice you use is fruity

[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:20.080]
Which is why so many of these people think you're some kind of a fag

[02:26:20.740 --> 02:26:22.680]
They bet the fact you're on my show instead of by

[02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:27.160]
Association I felt the asin. Yeah, okay. Go ahead. Let's support again

[02:26:28.060 --> 02:26:31.500]
What's your take on the old idea of getting rid of the way I see how much better that is

[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:37.480]
That you start like a guy not a what's your take and he has idea and it's fruity man. You sound like a faggot

[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.820]
God I'm serious. I'm I'm giving you a little you can do what you want

[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:46.860]
I'm already asked anyway, but I'm giving you a little piece of advice is not to like do that

[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:48.680]
Fagging voice

[02:26:49.340 --> 02:26:52.600]
All right, go ahead. What's the pull again? Now you know how I've killed it next to this with it?

[02:26:52.600 --> 02:26:55.220]
That's excellent the choices are I'm all for it get rid of it

[02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:02.440]
I'll listen anyway, right no way. I love it right and I don't give a shment. Yeah shment all right

[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:03.640]
There you go for good choices

[02:27:03.640 --> 02:27:07.300]
I'm just a one hour little mini. Oh, this will stay on there overnight and then by tomorrow morning

[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:12.220]
Then it'll give us a real good barometer right and give us plenty of time to prepare emotionally and mentally for Wednesday

[02:27:13.060 --> 02:27:17.920]
I'm gonna free fit on my birthday and well on my birthday. I don't want to just work three hours. Do I? No

[02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:20.400]
I want to work the whole four hours during that big fat paycheck

[02:27:21.020 --> 02:27:25.900]
So clearance and muffins. Oh, you see the old fart the old fag is fine. No, well, I guess they're not gonna say fag

[02:27:25.900 --> 02:27:27.500]
The old Jew has you know

[02:27:28.300 --> 02:27:33.800]
Decided to give us that hour back with all the money we're paying him of course keep in mind that the Humper works about what six hours a week

[02:27:33.800 --> 02:27:34.020]
Down

[02:27:35.640 --> 02:27:40.700]
Especially during baseball season. So he's not and plus he's short an hour. He used to work four hours

[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:42.940]
Now he's down to three and most days like two and a half

[02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:46.560]
And he's looking paid the same and more power to a nice going Humper

[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.180]
I taught these guys well before I came to QM these guys were working like long shifts and little time off

[02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:56.220]
Now we show up on the hell that we feel like it and making a lot more money too

[02:27:56.900 --> 02:27:58.640]
That's just the way it is Greg. Okay

[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:04.760]
In fact, we don't want to be played butch boss with you, but the starting next week everybody 50% it raised

[02:28:05.780 --> 02:28:11.340]
Right? Oh, yeah, sure. So with it. No, well the 50% raised that means I can cut that three years down a year and a half

[02:28:11.340 --> 02:28:14.820]
And with the 50% raise look at what Scott can do, huh?

[02:28:15.200 --> 02:28:15.660]
By gum

[02:28:15.660 --> 02:28:18.300]
He can probably buy some two and gum and all over again

[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:23.820]
Get a melted milk if somebody will drive them down to that place on red road. What's that place where they're in our drugs, right? Very good

[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:24.060]
Yes

[02:28:24.980 --> 02:28:26.080]
Here's coral springs, so

[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:28.840]
Hey, they're pretty good sir

[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:35.700]
Excellent. I tuned in to your late, so I just want to know if I can jump on the other pole that you had previous go ahead

[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:36.740]
Dennis Robin

[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:40.620]
Wasn't he always a freak though?

[02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:47.120]
Yeah, but he was really good at one time and everybody was a good freak. Yeah, he's a good freak and now he's a bad freak

[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:50.280]
Okay, good choice pali. All right, great. Have a great day and

[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:55.760]
You too. Thanks a lot. Yeah, no, Dennis Robbins. Okay. I mean once upon a time before he got so much notoriety

[02:28:55.760 --> 02:29:02.180]
He was just an outstanding basketball player and then he became like a real professional freak a total freak

[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:07.080]
And let me say it again when you consider the fact that allegedly he once had his tongue down Madonna's throat

[02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:11.380]
And the fact that she was kitten kissing a Brittany in Christina man

[02:29:11.380 --> 02:29:18.220]
Oh, just a thought of it up to make you gag ain't it? Take it especially their Brittany part that because now she's been defiled

[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:23.460]
Yes, she has and if she really was doing anything with the Justin which we all doubt very seriously

[02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:26.340]
But if she was talk about the filed. Oh god

[02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:31.080]
What is wrong with that girl, huh? It's got to be all the publicity stunt stuff

[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:35.080]
She can't really be doing all these ugly guys. No, I was she going with now. Isn't she going with the

[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.160]
Who is it that Enrique supposedly doing suppose of any quarter code?

[02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:45.460]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, yeah, we oh, no, I'm thinking of a Gerolino. Who's he with?

[02:29:46.860 --> 02:29:51.460]
Diet come on you better start reading the tabloids mister you're getting useless just when we started straight

[02:29:51.460 --> 02:29:57.740]
We've got getting our shipments and I'm really distraught about it. You're what the shipments of all shits. I thought you said something else

[02:29:58.340 --> 02:30:03.180]
Yeah, get your shipments together. Were you who was sending us a Jose who's a Jose?

[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:09.480]
Jose Lambeet at the end he ought to be sending because I'm very big promoter of the tabloids especially the inquire

[02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:14.340]
Which is no one he writes for but there's nobody from most the inquire better than I do. Hey, Jose we miss our shipments

[02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:17.660]
Yeah, Jose sent us the tabloids you goofball you vault headed geek

[02:30:19.060 --> 02:30:22.240]
One thing about Jose Lambeet which was a shock to all of us you know

[02:30:23.820 --> 02:30:27.740]
You know what it is. I know the other wife you know. Yeah, that is shocking

[02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:34.080]

The audience understands as much as they take everything very very much the heart

[02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:59.000]
I say it was a do over it losses by the sports things over the weekend

[02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:06.020]
It's just for fun. It's just to kill some good time a little amusement litter entertainment a chance to rip somebody and ask which we learned a lot

[02:31:06.020 --> 02:31:10.580]
Let's rip Robert Blake and ask let's rip OJ until we can't have nothing left to rip no mo

[02:31:11.260 --> 02:31:12.940]

What did I tell you the old people the miserable nasty rotten bastards they live for other look at my father

[02:31:20.900 --> 02:31:24.340]
There you go mother look at my mother with her bomb movements, huh

[02:31:26.740 --> 02:31:31.200]
Go as to show you my you don't have to have a lot of bms in order to lift an old ripe old age

[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:33.340]
Although they ought to be getting pretty right by now

[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:38.840]
What's your take on Neil's idea of getting rid of the Wednesday wanted to comedy bits hour?

[02:31:38.980 --> 02:31:42.520]
Well, let's see. I'm voting for I'm all for it get rid of it because it was my idea

[02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:45.980]
So I guess I better do that because I'm a little bit nervous about that hour

[02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:48.020]
I think it's I think it's counterproductive you know

[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:51.400]
I mean well there's seven votes. I'm all for it. Give it a three no way. I love it three

[02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:55.560]
I don't give a shmit one and I'll listen anyway none out of the fridge. It's just a smattering there

[02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.120]
Just a quick like

[02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:03.280]
Is there a Caucasian going to be all right now? Sure

[02:32:03.280 --> 02:32:08.160]
I don't want to hear him because he'll like he'll have like a voodoo hex on your ass. He hates you another one

[02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:10.320]
Here's plantation hello

[02:32:10.880 --> 02:32:14.800]
Hi, young colonial. How are you? Yes, sir. Okay. Just two items

[02:32:15.980 --> 02:32:19.400]
Paul Winfield is the narrator for a any city confidential

[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:25.720]
Oh, yeah Paul Winfield no kind of Dave right and the other item is that I had a siding of

[02:32:26.240 --> 02:32:28.760]
Brett summers on

[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:36.820]
I'm a CBS Saturday morning with Russ Mitchell two weeks ago every time I see her I say oh yeah, klugman

[02:32:40.320 --> 02:32:44.440]
Now now Paul Winfield he does sound like Vincent Price doesn't he? Yeah, absolutely

[02:32:45.200 --> 02:32:48.140]
In fact the first several times I watch that show which is a really great show

[02:32:48.140 --> 02:32:52.740]
I always thought it was Vincent Price and then I kept realizing these these stories are too new

[02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:55.320]
They're too recent because Vincent Price but dead for years, you know

[02:32:55.320 --> 02:32:57.220]
In the occasion of the question. Yes, sir

[02:32:57.220 --> 02:33:01.720]
Since the came out closed down on sunrise Boulevard wouldn't go shop now

[02:33:02.440 --> 02:33:04.200]
Uh if he'd in center in Toronto

[02:33:04.980 --> 02:33:07.200]
Ever great day pali

[02:33:07.200 --> 02:33:13.480]
How do you attack the buffet there at that the buffet plays next to the center with a fork and a knife and a spoon to get in glass

[02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:20.080]
Huh bonds? I charge yellow screaming and again, so now how do you attack the buffet and of course like every other buffet?

[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:24.800]
You see these big enormous tubs of you know see let me ask you this

[02:33:25.700 --> 02:33:30.140]
I was asking my friend yesterday. We're eating in there. I said why is it that some of these people

[02:33:30.580 --> 02:33:35.200]
Load up the plates so it looks I mean they have no embarrassment factor of course when you walk around looking like that

[02:33:35.200 --> 02:33:36.420]
I guess there's no embarrassment anyway

[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:42.320]
But why do they have to pile up a plate what's in all you can eat buffet in other words you could go back 80 million times

[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:44.940]
And nobody would even notice if you're like a moderate amount

[02:33:44.940 --> 02:33:47.460]
But they piled up and of course I discovered the reason

[02:33:47.460 --> 02:33:52.200]
There was because every time they know because every time they come back they still pile up like that right

[02:33:52.200 --> 02:33:58.600]
But you don't want to make a lot of trips in addition to which the reason that buffet joints want you to leave the plate

[02:33:58.600 --> 02:34:04.960]
And then go get a new plate each time is so they can keep count of how many plates are being used so they can figure out if they can make any money or not

[02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:07.760]
Uh-huh. You ever think about that? No I hadn't

[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:13.960]
Plus they also figure there's got to be some kind of embarrassment factor because you're not going to leave a plate behind eight or nine times

[02:34:13.960 --> 02:34:18.940]
See if you just take the same plate and go back they have no way to keep in track of that. That's right. You can go back 50 times

[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:22.700]
So unless you're a real big fat slob

[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:27.460]
It's a lot of these people are you're not gonna like leave eight or nine plates behind for them to pick up

[02:34:27.460 --> 02:34:31.040]
Because then they're gonna say they're gonna start taking pictures, you know, they're gonna be a surveillance camera

[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:37.000]
And then next no next time you go start to come in they'll like say oh sorry. We're closing now stuff like that

[02:34:37.520 --> 02:34:43.960]
Like at the Emerald Coast man. I'll tell you some of the people I've seen in that place. Oh my god. I imagine they make fat boy look like

[02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:47.940]
Mini-Ripperton they make Josh Friedman look like

[02:34:49.260 --> 02:34:50.140]

We'll be back with more Dr. Phil the element weight solution. Yes number one in the New York times list course

[02:37:24.660 --> 02:37:29.340]
More calls after this one 19 five more explosions. That's what Miss Fudges sing on our website

[02:37:29.340 --> 02:37:33.180]
She ended up multiple multiple larger explosions heard in Iraq. Oh no

[02:37:33.180 --> 02:37:41.420]
Past few weeks and indeed the past few months as security has been on the west side of as the bin but that's on CNN right now the Tigris river

[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.400]
Yeah, the Tigris that's him on the website their kin to Tigritu yet it's on a website knocking over for what's his name

[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:52.400]
Coalition provisional authority buildings the former presidential palaces of

[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.860]
Saddam as saying relatively freely without being challenged until you

[02:37:56.860 --> 02:38:02.080]
63 votes on a website so far on a second pull what's your take on eels? I did getting rid of that once they wanted to comedy

[02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:07.260]
But it's our 63 votes. I'm all for a get rid of a 25 no way. I love it 20

[02:38:07.260 --> 02:38:12.140]
I don't give a Schmidt 13. I listen anyway five so it's not really compelling yet. You see what I'm saying?

[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:17.720]
It's not we but you got to tell them our morning got a lot of votes yet to be a tally bears where the coalition can't marry a malefin

[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:21.320]
On us you'll get to tell us straight now entirely sealed off. It's very difficult

[02:38:21.320 --> 02:38:27.300]
But for us to get there impossible or you know as difficult as possible for ordinary Iraq is so yes

[02:38:27.300 --> 02:38:29.740]
There is a great sense in security here

[02:38:29.740 --> 02:38:31.440]
Not just the thing of this guy just

[02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:34.440]
Because they don't know where it was yet and they don't know anything

[02:38:34.440 --> 02:38:37.260]
That's so he said the yeah, yeah, lovely outfit

[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.220]
He said the explosions were so strong with the gratt

[02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:42.100]
He felt the earth shake under his feet

[02:38:42.780 --> 02:38:44.060]
That's what Carol King said

[02:38:44.800 --> 02:38:52.620]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 t and Verizon wireless line of course. This is all part of the big Ramadan thing

[02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:54.320]
This is like the Ted offensive they're comparing it to

[02:38:55.140 --> 02:38:58.880]
It's the Ramadan offensive here's minibi chillo

[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:01.600]
And yeah, I hate to agree with George, but maybe we

[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:07.520]
Terminated the earlier poll too early. I'd like to suggest the name. Yeah, I could have saved this till tomorrow right?

[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:09.100]
Yeah, yeah, but you know, let me see

[02:39:09.100 --> 02:39:12.740]
That we perhaps overlook to the obvious watch them book

[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:16.960]
He used to be great. Well, I'll tell you in the radio world

[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:23.660]
I don't like them you don't like them, but if you look at the money made in radio. Oh, yeah, you know, I have to say well

[02:39:23.660 --> 02:39:28.860]
Okay, you know, we don't like

[02:39:28.860 --> 02:39:31.160]
Got him one mud layer. Yeah, but you know something his

[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:36.420]
Ditto heads his disciples from Corridor with the pool say his ditto heads are like oh well, you know

[02:39:36.420 --> 02:39:39.220]
It's one of those things and he'll be fine and all of that crap, you know

[02:39:39.220 --> 02:39:43.840]
Well, yes, that's true. I don't think anything will persuade him even the fact that this guy who

[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:45.360]
speaks for personal

[02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:52.080]
Sent his made out to do the tough work and came up with a bus she would get it

[02:39:52.080 --> 02:39:58.140]
He was also trying to rip hills off from people who had the prescriptions for legitimate illnesses. Oh really?

[02:39:58.140 --> 02:40:03.120]
Okay, well, I shouldn't be surprised. Yeah, you know, he was the guy who might be considered in the radio world

[02:40:03.120 --> 02:40:09.600]
National Association of broadcast number one is a great guy and now, you know great Nazi. That's right

[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:13.980]
Yeah, yeah, and as far as the other ball goes we want all me all the time

[02:40:16.540 --> 02:40:21.680]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pat. Have a great day. Add me. Oh, bye. I see you there. You go. That was a good look job

[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:23.740]
22 past one

[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:25.740]
Oh

[02:40:25.740 --> 02:40:31.020]
And you'll notice how fast I mean, I realized he's been wish the way into some of rehab outfit again supposedly for five weeks

[02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:33.940]
We notice how we hear nothing more no more

[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.640]
Until he's like my major. We turned

[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:41.640]
Well, we all know that sex sells

[02:40:43.680 --> 02:40:46.500]
That's good old air miles O'Brien on CNN

[02:40:48.300 --> 02:40:49.780]
567. What what is it?

[02:40:50.120 --> 02:40:53.640]
0560 and pound 560 only AT and T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:40:53.700 --> 02:40:55.200]
Maybe we did cut off the other one too soon.

[02:40:55.220 --> 02:40:57.140]
And this guy apologized for agreeing with you.

[02:40:57.320 --> 02:40:57.920]
Yeah, I don't blame him.

[02:40:57.940 --> 02:40:58.420]
What's to do that?

[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:01.640]
No, I mean, the other one was in, run its course.

[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:02.400]
So it was fine.

[02:41:02.480 --> 02:41:04.900]
And nobody was going to catch OJ or any of the top three

[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:05.580]
or four on air.

[02:41:05.660 --> 02:41:07.320]
And we could, we could have put a few others on air

[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:09.180]
and it got a couple of, well, what's the point, right?

[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:09.660]
Yeah, whatever.

[02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:11.360]
Now you know what I'm saying?

[02:41:11.560 --> 02:41:12.100]
Sure, who cares?

[02:41:12.740 --> 02:41:14.440]
Basically, we got the LA of the land.

[02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:16.860]
We got the temperature of the audience.

[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:18.640]
We stuck the thermometer deep inside there.

[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:20.640]
And we got there and they're running a high fever.

[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:23.320]
Here's a call from Boca.

[02:41:23.420 --> 02:41:23.600]
Hello.

[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:25.560]
Yeah, hey, how you doing?

[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:26.220]
Pretty good.

[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:28.640]
Yeah, I have a question and comment just

[02:41:28.640 --> 02:41:29.720]
going to hang up and listen.

[02:41:30.060 --> 02:41:33.040]
My question is, last Friday around the same time

[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:36.440]
you read something from a woman writing about George W.

[02:41:36.760 --> 02:41:38.700]
And I was just wondering if I could find out where to get

[02:41:38.700 --> 02:41:39.600]
a transcript of that.

[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:43.040]
And my comment is the gay kid that they

[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:44.880]
expelled over at a Christian.

[02:41:45.580 --> 02:41:46.020]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:41:46.140 --> 02:41:47.780]
I wonder how many, how many, you know,

[02:41:47.780 --> 02:41:50.660]
they went around asking all the heteros who were defiling their bodies

[02:41:50.660 --> 02:41:52.440]
by engaging in premarital sex.

[02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:53.640]
I wonder how many of those kids got expelled.

[02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:54.540]
The big old.

[02:41:55.220 --> 02:41:55.480]
Exactly.

[02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:58.160]
But that's what they're nervous about is the big old.

[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.440]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:42:00.440 --> 02:42:02.720]
I think he's probably talking about the Molly Ivens column

[02:42:02.720 --> 02:42:03.220]
that I read.

[02:42:03.280 --> 02:42:03.760]
That's the one.

[02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:04.780]
Is that the one?

[02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:06.600]
Well, what is the Bush Hater?

[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:07.820]
Call me a Bush Hater.

[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:09.860]
Oh, yeah, that's on our website.

[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:12.200]
If you go back to go back on the arrangers.com

[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:15.200]
and scroll through the previous, what

[02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:16.160]
we got that under, features.

[02:42:17.320 --> 02:42:18.860]
Yeah, under features or whatever it's under.

[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:21.040]
And you've got some of the older columns from like a couple of days ago.

[02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.240]
It was on there, probably on Friday, Thursday, whatever day was on.

[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:25.340]
They're all still on there, right?

[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:26.000]
For several days.

[02:42:27.180 --> 02:42:28.400]
Yeah, in the archives.

[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:29.240]
Well, that's what it is.

[02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:32.500]
Why do you say, yeah, so like indecisively?

[02:42:33.760 --> 02:42:35.180]
I think he's picking on you again, Eric.

[02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:37.960]
88 votes on this.

[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:39.980]
It's not looking too good for the one to two hour.

[02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:41.380]
What's your take?

[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:43.880]
Give rid of that one to two comedy, a bit sour on Wednesdays.

[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:45.700]
I'm all for a give rid of it 42.

[02:42:46.420 --> 02:42:47.720]
No way I love it 24.

[02:42:48.380 --> 02:42:49.920]
I don't give a Schmidt 16.

[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.240]
And I'll listen anyway six out of the first 88.

[02:42:52.860 --> 02:42:55.600]
It's great to be in the sunshine state in the Votely is 88.

[02:42:55.880 --> 02:42:57.140]
And that's the way it is.

[02:42:57.700 --> 02:42:58.520]
And don't be late.

[02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:03.840]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18.

[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.340]
See, how's that band of pepper?

[02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:07.220]
I see we got a band hit this week.

[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:07.800]
I think we do.

[02:43:08.680 --> 02:43:11.400]
I think if you go to our website, they're on at home page.

[02:43:12.700 --> 02:43:14.880]
This the internet is a little bit slow today.

[02:43:15.060 --> 02:43:16.040]
You haven't had problems yet.

[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:18.460]
It's a little bit strange all day today.

[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:21.160]
And even what's his name is coming out there?

[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:22.400]
SCRUAN, what are witches out of you?

[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:23.380]
Look lovely, SCRUAN.

[02:43:23.500 --> 02:43:28.260]
You look just like you, like a real slut, like a real witchy slut.

[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:30.020]
And what was I just looking for?

[02:43:30.840 --> 02:43:31.980]
The band hit right on top.

[02:43:32.540 --> 02:43:33.060]
Oh, it is?

[02:43:33.580 --> 02:43:34.620]
Where where the hell is it?

[02:43:34.900 --> 02:43:35.460]
On top of what?

[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:36.620]
On top of her pointed head?

[02:43:36.740 --> 02:43:37.480]
Top of old smoky.

[02:43:37.860 --> 02:43:40.380]
Oh, well, when the hell is Miguel's next band hit?

[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:41.180]
I don't know.

[02:43:43.420 --> 02:43:44.380]
It's not on there.

[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:45.300]
It's not right on top.

[02:43:45.620 --> 02:43:46.940]
You made me go all the way back to the top.

[02:43:46.940 --> 02:43:47.740]
There's a day of number six.

[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:48.280]
There it is.

[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:50.640]
There's a day of number six from noon to two at the Bennett Auto

[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:53.740]
Supply 2950 North State Road 7 in Margate.

[02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:54.460]
That should be OK.

[02:43:54.540 --> 02:43:55.600]
We never go to Margate, right?

[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:56.180]
Not enough.

[02:43:56.440 --> 02:43:57.360]
Well, we're doing it this time.

[02:43:57.440 --> 02:43:58.300]
Let's go to Margate.

[02:43:58.400 --> 02:43:58.800]
What do you say?

[02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:00.900]
Come on, let's all get together in a big caravan

[02:44:00.900 --> 02:44:02.000]
and go to Margate next week.

[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:03.920]
And I know where my birthday, that would be a good excuse,

[02:44:04.140 --> 02:44:04.260]
right?

[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:04.600]
Sure.

[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:07.220]
That's kind of a birthday gift to me, even if you don't care

[02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:08.960]
about cats or dogs or a band hit pepper rescue.

[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:11.660]
Just do it for me and then take the stuff and pawn it.

[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:12.180]
Sell it.

[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:13.760]
Stick it somewhere.

[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:17.460]
26 past one at five, 60 WQM.

[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:19.100]
It won't be long now before I was relatively

[02:44:19.100 --> 02:44:20.480]
starpullin' in for the holidays.

[02:44:21.040 --> 02:44:22.880]
Maybe your parents are coming out of state for the winner.

[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000]
In either case, if you need a new mattress,

[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:26.420]
do the smart thing, like I always do.

[02:44:26.500 --> 02:44:28.040]
And everybody else at QM seems to be doing.

[02:44:28.420 --> 02:44:30.820]
Call 1-800 mattress and talk to our friends at the Automatic

[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:31.120]
Restorant.

[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.100]
You know the mattress industry is full of phony claims

[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:33.780]
in shell games.

[02:44:34.320 --> 02:44:37.060]
At the Automatic Rest, no phony promises, no bait and switch,

[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:39.720]

Now, including stirons and foster huet.

[02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:45.360]
When you call dial amateurs at 1-800 mattress,

[02:44:45.580 --> 02:44:46.740]

in the morning till 10 a night.

[02:44:50.560 --> 02:44:52.360]
I've been sleeping on a mattress from these folks for years

[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:54.380]
and years, you ought to be sleeping on a dial amateurs

[02:44:54.380 --> 02:44:56.340]

[02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:02.280]
Let me try that again.

[02:45:02.660 --> 02:45:05.260]
On a sales practices, fantastic service every day.

[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:06.700]
You want to know why I screwed up?

[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:09.280]
Because there's no punctuation in here.

[02:45:09.620 --> 02:45:10.160]
Well, punked it.

[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:12.120]
Jesus Christ, fat boy, what's the matter?

[02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:13.620]
You want a baloney sandwich too many?

[02:45:13.760 --> 02:45:15.280]
Is that the problem you fat cover crap?

[02:45:15.780 --> 02:45:17.920]
See, I'm trying to think, how come I can't read this right?

[02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:19.500]
That's because there's no punctuation.

[02:45:19.640 --> 02:45:23.240]
You schmuck, fantastic service, every day low prices,

[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:25.000]
same day delivery, free set up and removal.

[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:28.160]
So it's easy to see in spite of the skeptics out there

[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:30.560]
in the fat people by dial amateurs is ranked number one

[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:31.640]
in the world and customer satisfaction.

[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:34.100]
God, you can't complain about our copy of QN

[02:45:34.100 --> 02:45:35.020]
because we're not getting any.

[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:36.560]
We're getting crap on paper.

[02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:39.040]
Isn't that your name where you put it?

[02:45:39.540 --> 02:45:40.360]
Sure it was up.

[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.840]
Don't be fooled by the so-called giants in the math

[02:45:42.840 --> 02:45:44.140]
industry or furniture store.

[02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:45.940]
They can't match what you get every single day

[02:45:45.940 --> 02:45:46.620]
from dollar, my friends.

[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:48.420]
So call them right now and tell them that fat boy

[02:45:48.420 --> 02:45:49.940]
told you to call 1-800-Matras.

[02:45:50.300 --> 02:45:50.800]
I'm using them.

[02:45:50.900 --> 02:45:51.500]
George uses them.

[02:45:51.560 --> 02:45:52.280]
Miguel is using them.

[02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:54.600]
Wilka Bryant, even the anxious fat boy.

[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:55.560]
And you should be calling them too.

[02:45:55.960 --> 02:45:58.960]
Call 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S for an unbeatable deal.

[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:01.760]
Or online, you'll get more info at matras.com.

[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:04.500]
I'm going to get a new one.

[02:46:04.660 --> 02:46:07.180]
This is 420-5-6-1.

[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:08.500]
Q-A-M.

[02:46:12.120 --> 02:46:13.500]
It's Monday.

[02:46:14.780 --> 02:46:15.280]
Oi!

[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:18.880]
Oh, God, Friday seems so far away.

[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:23.820]
Here I'm trapped in this office to stay.

[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:28.540]
I feel like crap because it's Monday.

[02:46:33.180 --> 02:46:34.140]
I'm going to get a new one.

[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:38.760]
Coming up next is a queer eye for that Palestinian guy.

[02:46:39.060 --> 02:46:41.300]
We make over Yasser Errassad.

[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:43.700]
He's trying to take over the PLO again from that Muhammad

[02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:44.720]
What's his name?

[02:46:45.020 --> 02:46:47.080]
If he's to succeed, he needs some help.

[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:47.600]
No kidding.

[02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:49.820]
What is up with that do-rag?

[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:51.560]
I mean, it's terrified minutes ago.

[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:52.080]
Really?

[02:46:52.340 --> 02:46:53.360]
And that's scraggly weird.

[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:55.000]
I mean, who are you?

[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:56.900]
It's going to be our biggest challenge ever.

[02:46:56.900 --> 02:47:02.040]
But we're ready to scrap that drab wardrobe and transform Yasser from a Ringo star.

[02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:03.440]
Look alike to a...

[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:06.460]
Well, he's still going to look like Ringo, but just cleaner.

[02:47:06.680 --> 02:47:08.820]
We need to do something about those glasses too.

[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:10.620]
Oh, we're going to be doing just a ton of things.

[02:47:10.640 --> 02:47:13.140]
On the next queer eye for that Palestinian guy.

[02:47:13.460 --> 02:47:14.240]
Thursday night, tonight.

[02:47:15.980 --> 02:47:17.480]
Okay, 132-5-60.

[02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:21.340]
Let's see what the Washington Post says about this thing in Iraq.

[02:47:22.500 --> 02:47:24.000]
From his Fudge's website.

[02:47:24.220 --> 02:47:26.120]
See, I give credit where credit is doing this Fudge.

[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:26.860]
You piece of crap.

[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:30.240]
Strong explosions were a her late Monday, in central Baghdad.

[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.520]
And it appeared the blast were coming from the western side of the Tigris River, as this broad

[02:47:34.520 --> 02:47:34.860]
said.

[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.080]
This is silly as big.

[02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:39.140]
And out of Baghdad with more, what are you finding out, Matthew?

[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:45.020]
Well, obviously a great deal of activity that's just coming, filtering free to us here on

[02:47:45.020 --> 02:47:45.360]
the ground.

[02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:47.060]
In Baghdad, we'll start with that explosion.

[02:47:47.060 --> 02:47:47.580]
What do I do?

[02:47:47.700 --> 02:47:47.960]
In secret.

[02:47:48.380 --> 02:47:49.820]
This is a kind of blue background.

[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:55.200]
That is become almost a daily routine here in various areas across Iraq.

[02:47:55.200 --> 02:48:00.080]
We're hearing from the military people in to create the US military, spokesman in to

[02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:06.880]
create that one US soldier at least one has been killed when his vehicle went over a land

[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:13.380]
mine or was attacked by a roadside bomb detonated as the vehicle went past.

[02:48:13.380 --> 02:48:17.960]
We understand that he is a member of the fourth infantry division, but any other further

[02:48:17.960 --> 02:48:22.940]
personal details have been withheld until the authorities contact his relatives.

[02:48:22.940 --> 02:48:29.100]
But just another example of the kind of daily tragedy that is being faced by US soldiers,

[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:30.280]
the other coalition troops.

[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.460]
Shouldn't be there in a first place.

[02:48:31.980 --> 02:48:33.600]
Country on a daily basis.

[02:48:34.140 --> 02:48:39.080]
Let's turn now to the other developing story that we've come up here to report to you.

[02:48:39.400 --> 02:48:45.620]
A number of loud explosions, rocking Baghdad, shaking the sort of ground that we were standing

[02:48:45.620 --> 02:48:45.820]
on.

[02:48:45.880 --> 02:48:49.440]
We've come up here to try and observe exactly what the situation is.

[02:48:49.440 --> 02:48:52.100]
We've also sent a team out to the location where we...

[02:48:52.100 --> 02:48:54.700]
So in other words, to make a long story short, he hasn't had any idea what he's talking

[02:48:54.700 --> 02:48:54.940]
about.

[02:48:55.060 --> 02:48:55.160]
Okay.

[02:48:55.440 --> 02:48:58.400]
As soon as you guys have some idea what it is, let us know.

[02:48:58.500 --> 02:48:59.040]
In fact, there it is.

[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:03.700]
It's caused of these series of explosions unclear, which means we'll just put them a lot

[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:04.980]
of time to get some info.

[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:06.800]
Find out where it was and what will happen.

[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:09.540]
And the Tigris and the Tigr too.

[02:49:10.760 --> 02:49:14.600]
Cell phone users have been known to complain about poor service, but one New York man's mobile

[02:49:14.600 --> 02:49:16.080]
literally went down the toilet.

[02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:21.200]
The man was on a suburban train from Grand Central Station Wednesday night.

[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:25.540]
When he went to the bathroom to make a phone call, dropped the phone into the toilet bowl

[02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:30.060]
and then his hand and arm became stuck in the bowl trying to retrieve it.

[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:32.060]
You ready for that?

[02:49:33.080 --> 02:49:33.960]
For Nidiot.

[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:34.860]
No, it's true.

[02:49:35.100 --> 02:49:35.680]
I don't know.

[02:49:35.780 --> 02:49:39.180]
Metro North Railroad staff could not help the man, so they stopped the train and called

[02:49:39.180 --> 02:49:44.080]
police officers and firefighters to extricate him, a process that took 90 minutes using the

[02:49:44.080 --> 02:49:45.760]
jaws of life rescue equipment.

[02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:46.540]
Those are the news.

[02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:50.780]
The toilets are made of aluminum, so I imagine he was down on his hands and knees with

[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:54.120]
the shirt rolled up and handed arm down inside, trying to flush out his cell phone.

[02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.900]
Don't you hate it when you go into the bathroom and there's some guy down there in his hands

[02:49:56.900 --> 02:49:57.240]
and knees?

[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:58.540]
I just do my business anyway.

[02:49:59.420 --> 02:50:02.140]
He said that because of the design of the, that's probably what he's doing his business.

[02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:07.360]
He said that because of the design of the train toilet, the mobile probably ended up in

[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:08.660]
a chemical holding tank.

[02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:13.080]
A sport of the railroad that serves the Northern suburbs of New York and Connecticut

[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:17.460]
identified the man as Edwin Gallard 41 of New York who suffered a minor injury to his

[02:50:17.460 --> 02:50:19.240]
arm as firefighters cut the toilet apart.

[02:50:19.580 --> 02:50:24.020]
When it doubt cut the bowl apart, the track was closed and thousands of commuters were

[02:50:24.020 --> 02:50:25.420]
delayed during the evening rush hour.

[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:29.580]
No, because there's a pastor's got his hands stuck in the toilet.

[02:50:31.360 --> 02:50:35.020]
The bad news is the phone has yet to be recovered.

[02:50:35.380 --> 02:50:36.220]
Damn it.

[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:39.100]
I mean, how valuable is your cell phone, right?

[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:40.780]
Can't you always go get another one?

[02:50:41.320 --> 02:50:42.540]
Yeah, I think that valuable.

[02:50:42.900 --> 02:50:46.500]
No, not that I would stick my hand deep inside the toilet because God willing, those

[02:50:46.500 --> 02:50:47.840]
what else he might have come up with.

[02:50:47.880 --> 02:50:53.000]
You've turned five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T and T in Verizon.

[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:56.400]
Oh, here's air miles of Brian trying to give us some explanation about what happened.

[02:50:56.480 --> 02:50:58.260]
Give you a sense of where this is.

[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:03.100]
You can find a west side of the tigger population of about a half million US troops been finding

[02:51:03.100 --> 02:51:05.900]
a lot of resistance there of they still have no idea.

[02:51:06.740 --> 02:51:08.080]
126 votes on his pool.

[02:51:08.560 --> 02:51:12.260]
What's your take on the Eels idea of dumping that Wednesday one to two comedy vets are,

[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:13.700]
which I think it's on a way out.

[02:51:14.040 --> 02:51:15.200]
I think we've heard the last one.

[02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:16.960]
I'm all for it.

[02:51:17.060 --> 02:51:17.520]
Get rid of it.

[02:51:17.600 --> 02:51:18.020]
64.

[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:19.340]
No way.

[02:51:19.500 --> 02:51:19.860]
I love it.

[02:51:19.980 --> 02:51:20.340]
31.

[02:51:21.140 --> 02:51:24.760]
I don't give a Schmidt 20 and I'll listen anyway 11.

[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:26.460]
64.

[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:27.560]
31.

[02:51:28.180 --> 02:51:31.780]
West troops can try to sort this kind of thing in the future.

[02:51:31.920 --> 02:51:32.200]
Okay.

[02:51:32.940 --> 02:51:33.680]
They're still there.

[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:35.500]
Phil and time they got all their talking heads on it.

[02:51:35.660 --> 02:51:37.100]
They haven't got a clue what that'll happen.

[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:42.080]
Five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 T line.

[02:51:42.100 --> 02:51:43.100]
Here's my any hello.

[02:51:43.700 --> 02:51:47.180]
I knew you familiar with a singer song right about a name of Steve Earl.

[02:51:47.880 --> 02:51:49.680]
Steve Earl never heard of him.

[02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:52.620]
He's debating Bill O'Reilly tonight at eight o'clock.

[02:51:52.620 --> 02:51:53.960]
He's very talented guy.

[02:51:54.200 --> 02:51:55.220]
Well, why do we care about that?

[02:51:55.820 --> 02:52:01.340]
Well, because it's not too often you see a lot of I guess so-called show business

[02:52:01.340 --> 02:52:05.260]
pipes that you know will flow in here and etc.

[02:52:05.600 --> 02:52:09.920]
But not you know go toe to toe with someone like.

[02:52:10.060 --> 02:52:11.760]
What's the muscle like Bill O'Reilly and.

[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:15.120]
And a debate which is I think it's going to be interesting.

[02:52:15.420 --> 02:52:19.700]
Okay, maybe somebody else will have a good one.

[02:52:19.940 --> 02:52:20.200]
You too.

[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:24.600]
Anybody wants to see Bill O'Reilly that schmuck all spin all day.

[02:52:25.240 --> 02:52:28.140]
By the way Bill O'Reilly we never talk about his ratings in the four

[02:52:28.140 --> 02:52:31.180]
Saturday on market and when the rating books come out you want to know why he

[02:52:31.180 --> 02:52:31.740]
doesn't have any.

[02:52:31.900 --> 02:52:32.400]
He doesn't have any.

[02:52:33.400 --> 02:52:35.120]
He's got a at least he's consistent.

[02:52:35.220 --> 02:52:36.360]
He's got a point.

[02:52:36.640 --> 02:52:38.120]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:52:38.200 --> 02:52:40.700]
As many O's as you can make it a role for infinity.

[02:52:40.700 --> 02:52:42.200]
Just put all any infinity symbol.

[02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:44.860]
Right.

[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:48.260]
You don't have anybody listen on whatever he's on.

[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:49.420]
I don't even know what station is.

[02:52:49.440 --> 02:52:50.740]
Is it that the light bulb junior?

[02:52:51.100 --> 02:52:53.740]
Whatever the hell he's on and oh I can remember that who the hell was it?

[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:54.820]
Wrote that breathless thing.

[02:52:54.900 --> 02:52:58.440]
Was it one of the South Florida fish rappers about Bill O'Reilly and about his

[02:52:58.440 --> 02:53:00.040]
radio show and he's going to take on rush.

[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:02.560]
Well, whether without rush he ain't got any audience on the radio.

[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:07.740]
He is strictly the only people who care about him are the right wing

[02:53:07.740 --> 02:53:09.920]
the lunatics who are tuned into Fox morning day and night.

[02:53:10.300 --> 02:53:13.400]
They're the same as the old Cubans who listen to the radio mom be morning

[02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:14.040]
noon and night.

[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:18.320]
Did it have the same as the religious fanatics who watched Pat Robertson in the

[02:53:18.320 --> 02:53:21.500]
700 Club morning noon and night and it's like a religion.

[02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:26.200]
It's the same cramp and these people are all mesmerized by the all spin all

[02:53:26.200 --> 02:53:30.120]
day from the Fox Schloss network from the Fox Nazi network.

[02:53:31.580 --> 02:53:32.760]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:53:32.760 --> 02:53:33.080]
Hello.

[02:53:35.660 --> 02:53:36.340]
Yes, sir.

[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:37.100]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:53:37.100 --> 02:53:37.520]
I'm the old man.

[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:38.380]
You're a listener.

[02:53:39.180 --> 02:53:39.340]
All right.

[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:40.840]
You had my Gordon's years ago.

[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:42.420]
Never been at my Gordon's.

[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:43.880]
I have you spoke to me.

[02:53:44.020 --> 02:53:44.980]
I know it anyway.

[02:53:45.120 --> 02:53:46.720]
Let me know my Gordon's in my life.

[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:47.660]
I know what it is.

[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:48.920]
OK, maybe it was another guy.

[02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:49.780]
He didn't buy me another guy.

[02:53:50.060 --> 02:53:54.240]
Anyway, I wanted, you know, your callers on Friday forgot an important fact

[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:56.160]
about that shooting of the teenager.

[02:53:57.420 --> 02:53:59.520]
Hello, the shooting of what teenager?

[02:53:59.660 --> 02:54:00.940]
The 16 year old and Broward.

[02:54:01.320 --> 02:54:01.960]
Oh, OK.

[02:54:02.420 --> 02:54:02.820]
Right.

[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:03.280]
Right.

[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:04.660]
They forgot one important fact.

[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:04.860]
Yeah.

[02:54:04.860 --> 02:54:07.140]
One of them was hiding in the bushes that the guy noticed.

[02:54:07.840 --> 02:54:09.680]
And as soon as he opened the door, he opened fire.

[02:54:09.900 --> 02:54:12.080]
It only takes one second to turn your back.

[02:54:12.340 --> 02:54:13.440]
And that wouldn't hold up in court.

[02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:15.360]
But the guy, you know, was shot in the back.

[02:54:15.560 --> 02:54:16.380]
It only takes a second.

[02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:18.140]
That's my question.

[02:54:18.180 --> 02:54:19.800]
So, in other words, you think he did the right thing?

[02:54:19.800 --> 02:54:20.760]
I don't think he's a murderer.

[02:54:21.420 --> 02:54:24.440]
That's, you know, I wrote what do you mean?

[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:25.500]
You don't think he's a murderer?

[02:54:25.720 --> 02:54:27.480]
I didn't know my bushes at 12, 13 in the morning.

[02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:30.860]
And another guy at the door, I would open the door and open fire before my

[02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:31.140]
door.

[02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:32.260]
You know what I would do?

[02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:33.440]
I would slam the door shut.

[02:54:33.500 --> 02:54:35.060]
If I was that concerned, I'd call 9-11.

[02:54:35.660 --> 02:54:36.740]
I wouldn't be shooting, man.

[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:39.200]
See, you believe in his wild west mentality.

[02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:39.980]
They're outside.

[02:54:40.280 --> 02:54:40.860]
They're not inside.

[02:54:41.240 --> 02:54:42.300]
They're not clawing on the door.

[02:54:42.480 --> 02:54:43.780]
They're not trying to knock the door down.

[02:54:44.060 --> 02:54:47.220]
They're not trying to come in and do harm to him and his family or take away the goddamn

[02:54:47.220 --> 02:54:47.780]
lunch.

[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:49.320]
They're outside.

[02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:52.860]
It just amazes me.

[02:54:52.980 --> 02:54:55.180]
You see, this goes back to what I've said for years and years.

[02:54:55.380 --> 02:54:56.840]
And it falls on deaf ears.

[02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:58.880]
I'm going to be talking to my TV screen here.

[02:55:00.300 --> 02:55:03.480]
This kind of insane violence, this kind of gun-loving.

[02:55:03.740 --> 02:55:05.280]
Oh, we'll see if there's somebody hiding in the bushes.

[02:55:05.660 --> 02:55:06.540]
Well, I got news for you.

[02:55:06.620 --> 02:55:07.620]
Okay, lock the freaking door.

[02:55:10.220 --> 02:55:10.760]
Call a police.

[02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:11.840]
Call your next-door neighbor.

[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:13.020]
Call off the National Guard.

[02:55:13.200 --> 02:55:13.760]
Call a president.

[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:16.240]
God Almighty.

[02:55:17.100 --> 02:55:19.060]
All you people who want to rationalize and make excuses.

[02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:21.140]
And by the way, I never was at my curtains in my life.

[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:21.360]
Okay?

[02:55:21.860 --> 02:55:23.400]
Is my curtains a seafood restaurant?

[02:55:23.780 --> 02:55:24.180]
I don't know.

[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:24.960]
Sounds right.

[02:55:26.080 --> 02:55:27.420]
I don't know who he's talking about.

[02:55:27.560 --> 02:55:27.660]
It's yours.

[02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:28.160]
Yours, how was it me?

[02:55:28.260 --> 02:55:28.700]
I've never been there.

[02:55:28.760 --> 02:55:30.000]
I don't know what it is, where it is.

[02:55:30.280 --> 02:55:30.700]
But he bought you.

[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:32.360]
I do know the Gordon Fisherman.

[02:55:34.060 --> 02:55:35.100]
141-19 blast.

[02:55:35.300 --> 02:55:38.840]
If you look at his three or four mortars in a hit-central bag debt, we don't know what

[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:39.640]
the hell where it was.

[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:42.200]
We don't know who got hurt or killed or whatever.

[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:44.500]
But they're still doing, like this.

[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:45.360]
They have no clue.

[02:55:46.520 --> 02:55:50.060]

Here's the latest on that Iraq situation by the Tigger.

[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:15.580]
A blast near a holy is Shiite Muslim Shrine in the city of Carbala.

[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:17.880]
They killed three people in your trouble, witnesses said.

[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:21.420]
Meanwhile in Baghdad, strong explosions were heard downtown after sunset.

[02:58:23.040 --> 02:58:26.920]
The Carbala blast occurred on a busy street, less than a hundred yards from the gold dome,

[02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:31.660]
Imam Hussein Shrine in the city, 65 miles south of the Iraqi capital.

[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:36.660]
Capital? All that had apparently were, well I'm having trouble with this.

[02:58:36.780 --> 02:58:38.280]
All that had apparently were passed is by.

[02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:43.040]
In Baghdad, five strong explosions were heard in quick succession, about 9-10pm Baghdad time.

[02:58:43.380 --> 02:58:46.100]
It appeared the blasts were coming from the western side of the Tigris River.

[02:58:46.340 --> 02:58:47.700]
That's Tigris, you stupid bitch.

[02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:50.940]
The US military command had no information on the incident.

[02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:54.140]
And then we have another dead American soldier a day, which you heard about moments before.

[02:58:54.460 --> 02:58:56.520]
Just day after day after day, is there any end in sight?

[02:58:56.560 --> 02:58:58.060]
No. Do we have any exit strategy?

[02:58:58.180 --> 02:59:00.320]
No. Do we have any business going there in the first place?

[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:02.220]
No. Did the president lie and all of his men?

[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:04.880]
Yes. How come there's no impeachment going on right now?

[02:59:04.880 --> 02:59:07.940]
You spineless, miserable Democratic assholes, you old man.

[02:59:09.240 --> 02:59:13.180]
Clinton gets a couple of blow jobs in the whole country, has to spend millions and millions of dollars

[02:59:13.180 --> 02:59:18.160]
in the waste two years with impeachment crap and with the ex-rated report from Kenny Star.

[02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:22.800]
In the meantime, we got all these American kids have been set off to be slaughtered like a human sacrifice,

[02:59:23.080 --> 02:59:27.080]
based on a pack of lies, which was decided before this man even stole his way into office.

[02:59:27.540 --> 02:59:28.820]
And little, little bit like that.

[02:59:29.680 --> 02:59:34.300]
Because the Democratic Party are a bunch of spineless cowards, that's exactly the reason this is going on.

[02:59:34.300 --> 02:59:38.020]
And the media are a bunch of enablers. They're the enablers.

[02:59:38.260 --> 02:59:39.380]
There are accomplices.

[02:59:40.120 --> 02:59:43.800]
That's how you're right. They're absolutely. They're partners in crime with the administration.

[02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:49.980]
Don King offers Palm Beach County site for New Marlins ballpark.

[02:59:51.440 --> 02:59:56.240]
Boxing promoter Don King is offering the Florida Marlins a new state inside on a property he owns in Palm Beach County.

[02:59:56.660 --> 03:00:00.700]
King owns a high life run ton and Magnolia Park, which is just north of West Palm.

[03:00:00.700 --> 03:00:04.320]
Well, that sounds great. If you live in Dave County, you don't want to drive up to West Palm Beach?

[03:00:04.320 --> 03:00:06.200]
No. If you live like in plantation? No.

[03:00:06.660 --> 03:00:14.120]
King owns a high life run ton, which spokesman Robert Wenex is a being ideal site for the World Series Champions proposed park.

[03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:17.340]
If it's Don, King could save boxing assures in the offseason.

[03:00:18.320 --> 03:00:23.600]
Fixed, of course. King says that would help the Marlins pay the estimated cost of 325 million bucks for the stadium.

[03:00:23.900 --> 03:00:26.100]
He says he hasn't talked to Marlins officials yet, however.

[03:00:26.100 --> 03:00:31.260]
The Marlins in Dave County have already announced the plan to commit $210 million toward a new ballpark in Miami.

[03:00:31.480 --> 03:00:34.180]
The stadium will have a retractable roof. We open for playing 2007.

[03:00:36.160 --> 03:00:40.280]
Now, if we move into Palm Beach, are they going to be the West Palm Beach Marlins? Is that it? If they go there? Yes.

[03:00:40.800 --> 03:00:42.860]
Because we know they're going to be the Miami Marlins if they go there.

[03:00:43.600 --> 03:00:46.900]
And what about if they go like to Washington, DC? Or Yeehaw, Joe Shin.

[03:00:47.300 --> 03:00:52.100]
Yeah. Or maybe like to Portland, Oregon or Portland, Maine or Batavia, New York.

[03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:56.460]
560, 705, 60, pound, 560 on a 18T line.

[03:00:56.880 --> 03:01:01.760]
What's your take on our idea of getting rid of the ones they wanted to commit if it's our 168 vote?

[03:01:02.700 --> 03:01:09.840]
I'm all for a get rid of it 85, 86. No way I love it 40. It's like more than 2 to 1. They hate it.

[03:01:10.240 --> 03:01:15.180]
I don't give a shmit 28. I'll listen anyway 15. See the I'll listen anyways and too stronger. You see that?

[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:17.160]
Oh, he usually is.

[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:20.400]
Here's a call from a beautiful Miami. Hello.

[03:01:21.020 --> 03:01:23.000]
We won the world series.

[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:33.140]
Thanks a lot Dave. David's becoming a Spongebob. He's working on it at the Hispanic accent because he's going to be moving to Miami. No, he's got to work on it, right?

[03:01:34.200 --> 03:01:34.520]
A lot.

[03:01:35.040 --> 03:01:41.420]
Thank you, but 5 6 7 0 5 60. That's more Howard David. It's new main man by the way, David Samson.

[03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:45.200]
Here's a call from Lauderdale. Hello.

[03:01:46.660 --> 03:01:49.000]
Yes, sir. You can't even shine.

[03:01:50.160 --> 03:01:55.140]
Yeah, shine this. Okay, asshole. Can't say I'm gonna rally shoes. Well, great. Go suck his ass.

[03:01:55.320 --> 03:02:04.400]
Okay, go stick your tongue deep inside his rectum. Okay, and see how it tastes. Go have a hot butt Sunday or Saturday or Monday or today or Monday's okay, too.

[03:02:05.240 --> 03:02:14.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60. See, this is the great retort from the right wing assholes from the ditto heads. You couldn't even shine. I don't want to shine issues. Okay.

[03:02:14.260 --> 03:02:18.680]
I'm making up money. I don't got a shot and shoes on a street corner like you do as well. That's probably shoes these boyfriend.

[03:02:20.740 --> 03:02:33.580]
Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, ma'am. Hi, Neil. I'm just calling to say that Bush has everyone so controlled in the media that the families are not even allowed to grieve in public.

[03:02:34.300 --> 03:02:42.420]
The coffins of the soldiers that come back aren't even allowed to be draped in the flag for fear that they'll be coverage of it and shown on the evening news.

[03:02:43.260 --> 03:02:51.960]
I think it's really sad. Yeah, we had that stront our website. Everything has to go forbid that the public in addition to which you know, it's really interesting.

[03:02:51.980 --> 03:02:57.720]
You remember right after the war was supposedly over and the networks got in there and they put up the satellite dishes.

[03:02:57.720 --> 03:03:02.820]
And we were able to get these live pictures like when they tore the Sodom statue down. Oh, yeah, all of that's those stage events.

[03:03:03.060 --> 03:03:10.880]
You think that now that we have all of the ability to show these live pictures from over there, we'd be seeing a lot more of what really is going on every day. You notice that that didn't happen.

[03:03:11.060 --> 03:03:16.640]
Oh, no, they have a lid on it as you would say. Yeah, thanks so much. Have a great day. Hang in there. Bye. Bye.

[03:03:17.980 --> 03:03:27.100]
Yeah, what is it going to take? How many are going to have to die? How long is this going to have to go on? How much more BS? How many more censorship? How much more bull crap?

[03:03:27.100 --> 03:03:34.200]
How many more patriots parts three, four and five before finally the American public voice up and says, you know what? This is a pile of crap.

[03:03:34.200 --> 03:03:38.380]
My and low. This is for radio by 60.

[03:03:40.740 --> 03:03:41.340]
All.

[03:03:44.060 --> 03:03:53.900]
Now the longest running motion picture musical in history has been reimagined for the 21st century. Jerry Brachheimer presents Sylvester Stallone in.

[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:57.900]
Yo, how you doing? I see you met my.

[03:03:58.680 --> 03:04:07.780]
Thankful handyman. You're pulling the Rocky Horror picture shall. You'll follow you look pretty good in them fishnet stockings. You would give him better nature. You got a nice tight little.

[03:04:08.040 --> 03:04:11.840]
What are you saying? It's just a bunch to the left.

[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:20.220]
And I hope to the right. You'll make you way through rice of me. Just got married rock.

[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:32.120]
Yeah, but Mickey way through rice of me. Stallone is back as Rocky Fender Boa. The Rocky Horror picture show 2003. Absolutely. Coming really really strong. Straight to radio.

[03:04:32.900 --> 03:04:44.280]
157 at 560. He's back. He's going to be psychotic. They'm sure that. And depressed. This thing you fax me about the report links to the back deals to Bush donations that I read on Friday. Yeah, I read on Friday.

[03:04:44.580 --> 03:04:56.940]
Okay. But this just in we let's see Bob Graham is not going to run for reelection in the Senate. We have five loud explosions at Baghdad, but we don't know what the hell it was at or what happened. Supreme court rejects 10 commandments, volume of appeal.

[03:04:56.940 --> 03:05:07.340]
The Supreme court refused today to enter the long running fight over a monument depicting the 10 commandments and the renegade judge that Yahoo dripping redneck who wants to keep the record list on display in the Alabama courthouse.

[03:05:07.720 --> 03:05:20.420]
The court quietly rejected appeals from suspended Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore, call me a Yahoo redneck who would argue that the monument properly acknowledges God as the source of the community morality. So essential to a self governing society.

[03:05:21.160 --> 03:05:32.720]
Moore suspended his chief justice for defying a federal court order to remove the monument. He goes on trial before the Alabama court of the judiciary November 12 on to face a judicial ethics charges for his refusal to comply with the order.

[03:05:33.680 --> 03:05:42.020]
The Supreme Court's action is not a ruling on the thorny question whether the 10 commandments made to be displayed in government buildings or in the public square. It merely reflects the high courts unwillingness to hear the appeal.

[03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:48.340]
Lower courts have splintered on the issue along the depictions of the 10 commandments in some instances and not in others.

[03:05:49.600 --> 03:05:53.900]
So he went to the Supreme Court says, oh please, please, let me stick this up there and he said, go away.

[03:05:54.100 --> 03:05:59.500]
No. Go away, come back another even year to embarrassing even for us. Have you liked that? I like it.

[03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:04.800]
Well, I don't know. I guess we ought to be, are we happy about the result on this poll here? Do we like it?

[03:06:04.800 --> 03:06:21.060]
Whatever. Depends on how lazy we feel on Wednesday. 203 votes. What's your take on the other idea getting rid of that ones day? One or two comedy bits hour on ones day? I'm all for a giveaway at 97 like two to one. No way I love it 48. So a little more than two to one. They don't like they hate it. They're sick of it.

[03:06:21.800 --> 03:06:24.960]
I don't give a shmit 37. I'll listen anyway. 21.

[03:06:26.120 --> 03:06:30.720]
Now looking too promising. I mostly have like a sudden surge when it votes from the outlying districts come in.

[03:06:31.520 --> 03:06:36.520]
And after the show when you and I get a chance to vote like 50 60 times a day. Watch how we change the round get.

[03:06:37.020 --> 03:06:48.540]
Okay, mad dog is coming up next and we can all what was us. We are cursed. Aren't we cursed down here, mad dog? They're hurricanes. Take it up the ass. The panthers take it in the ear and the dolphins. What an embarrassment. It just unbelievable.

[03:06:48.540 --> 03:06:49.860]
Bye bye bye.

[03:06:53.960 --> 03:06:59.100]
The mad dog. He gets on my nerves with this constant screaming.
