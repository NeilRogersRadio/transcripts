[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.180]
Spider you bastard, Morrell and Jim Rowe making passionate manly love

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:41.280]
Oh

[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.060]
No

[00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.100]
You know, Scrooan and sales told me she caught he has there she was breathless. She said he's got the big it for

[00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.280]
All big balls in his pants. She's ever seen in her life

[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.500]
It's a 10 or two at five sixty W

[00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.960]
WQ I am happy Friday to you

[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.520]
I'm just happy

[00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.720]
Like I said if we just had transmit her maintenance they would have been good

[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.080]
But now we got like a real living and breathing first on there. So what do you think how do you do?

[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.060]
I heard five minutes. Yeah, I heard about five minutes to

[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.920]
What I do improvement. How's that a major improvement?

[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.320]
And a guy that doesn't take himself seriously see that's one thing I've been trying to tell you people for years

[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.780]
These assholes that get on the air and pontificate and they're gonna like change the world on some stupid ass radio show

[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.520]
Ain't gonna happen

[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.300]
We're in the goddamn entertainment business. Okay, lighten up a little bit some of you assholes that take yourself too seriously

[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.540]
But I certainly don't want to get into personalities. Do I know not on the air not on the not on the air off the

[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.620]
We'd like to talk about mole and other people

[00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.200]
1442 votes on yesterday's pool. What's your take on graffiti? This just isn't the right crowd for the graffiti discussion

[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.000]
Only six people write a three hundred and fifty nine of you said only six people write graffiti or three sixty now

[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.540]
260 folks almost 35 percent think that only six people write graffiti. I don't believe that for a second

[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.800]
No, you have to be sick to like draw little dude ads and I don't know

[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.860]
It's just they're a lot of doodlers though aren't there a lot of people like in the office when they're bored to tears like most of our sales people

[00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.540]
They sit around and doodle on a pad

[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.180]
Huh, how'd you like to have a dollar in a bank for every person who sits around doodling?

[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.300]
Right right so what's the difference?

[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.260]
What's the goddamn difference? They're just doodling on a different thing in a different place. That's my take

[00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.200]
I love to read it graffiti three hundred and sixteen

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.560]
This topic is disgusting work and I see some 190 I

[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.460]
write

[00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:56.140]
My favorite response I write graffiti and drill drill glory holes

[00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.380]
126

[00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.500]
We got a pretty proud out there boys and girls

[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.120]
126 people in this audience and this answers a lot of questions you may have had about our colors over the years

[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.640]
Oh, yeah

[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.280]
126 I write graffiti and drill glory holes

[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.320]
I've never seen any meaning graffiti 27 I don't I mean those are people have just need to get out of the house and

[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.140]
I love to write it 21 out of oil over a thousand votes George has got a problem now

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.980]
He loves my dog my life ain't worth living and of course I have very little sympathy for people who don't to keep control of their pets

[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.400]
Yeah, my father's I'm just not when you're all no

[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.220]
Terrible thing his poor little pomegranate. How old is a dog about nine?

[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.700]
About nine I don't realize you had to dog that long. Oh, yeah

[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.000]
So here's a family petty let's a dog out last night to do its thing

[00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.680]
Goes back inside because the dog is a dog run around. I can relate to that

[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.900]
They take their damn sweet time, you know, they're sniffing for the right spot and comes out and low and behold a dog is gone dog gone

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.200]
dog gone it and

[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.120]
and

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.300]
searching and driving and looking and scouring and

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.520]
No luck no no the worst part of it is he just given the dog a bath and

[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.580]
The dog doesn't have any color or tag on but he doesn't have a micro chip a micro chip implanted in his

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.940]
somewhere yeah because they put it in their chest he had just had surgery because that

[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860]
Kidney's the blotter stones. Yeah, so we need the special medication and food

[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.700]
Boy, yeah, this is a this is a heartbreaking story to start the show on

[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.380]
George loses his damn dog

[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.120]
So if anybody out there in the Hollywood area right sees a little pomegranate. I'm assuming it's like a brown like the light brown

[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.200]
Like a butter scotch colored right freshly groomed so the hair is relatively short

[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.580]
With no color no tags. Yeah, that's a Georgia's dog, but he had a suit

[00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.160]
Pictures help us out. Okay, because there's nothing worse than losing your dog

[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.360]
I know that I don't really know that because I never lost my dog $500. I was a lot more responsible than that

[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.080]
I never got a lot of drinking 500 bucks. Oh, is that what it was?

[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.980]
What the cost? No, that's what I'm offering for you. I'm gonna go look for it

[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.720]
Yeah, 500 bucks. I think you get a lot of people out there looking for that dog

[00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.340]
In fact, you might just bring a whole bunch of dogs

[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.380]
Well, we'll pick one that looks close and say is this close enough to pacify you people? No

[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:27.800]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.780]
Hello

[00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.020]
Well, what's just happened to that?

[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.000]
Did you see that? Yeah, they died. No, no, they didn't die. They just something happened. I didn't die

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.420]
Let's try Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir

[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.500]
Great

[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.780]
No, I don't he's gonna talk about what everyone wants to talk about

[00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.080]
Huh

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.340]
So who cares? Let me say it again. He'll talk about whatever he wants to talk about

[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.340]
See that's one of the problems with you people in South Florida many of you

[00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.880]
You think that there are people who are exempt in addition to which it's not so much the audience

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.240]
But they've been conditioned to this by the sports nerds, you know, because on our radio station especially

[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.140]
It's really bad. There were some people who are beyond reproach. You know what I mean?

[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.640]
You know like Dave Wonstead and then we used to be Jimmy's Johnson and oh, you don't want to be knocking them

[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.160]
You know you because because our people generally speaking shill for these people especially

[00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.260]
If they're in the dolphins organization or the hurricanes

[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.820]
Yeah, Jimmy and Danny Danny and Jimmy well

[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.700]
Here we got a guy and there's gonna open up a mouth and say whatever he really wants to say and I say all right

[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.620]
Sam time

[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.080]
Just like that Wayne high-pinger crap. Oh near Rogers will never be on Q.A.M

[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:51.400]
Because Wayne will never put up. Yeah, right. That was six years ago. That was the late Chris Moore Christina Moore talk of that crap

[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.980]
How I'll never be on this station you should live so long Christina

[00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:59.220]
And you suck by the way. I got a story that is so scary and

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.420]
Even though it is on our website

[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.200]
Most people I mean most people don't read the stories anyway the bedtime stories

[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:12.320]
But even those who do they wouldn't be see why aren't people on the year on the news channels on the talking hit channels

[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.140]
Screaming at the top of their lungs about this and this is something that happened back in February

[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:22.780]
First I've ever read about it. Have you heard about it? What about this story about the library computer

[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:28.280]
Not since he factored not till you factored this is a story it's written by Susan Hildrath

[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:34.080]
Freedom to read big brother out of our libraries in the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday

[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.720]
She says libraries especially in San Francisco have a long tradition of catering to the diverse literary needs of the people

[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.180]
They serve as a result libraries have become a valued source of information for individuals families and civic groups

[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.720]
But after 9-11 the bloodline of libraries are believed in the freedom to read is being seriously undermined in

[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.060]
The name of homeland security

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.520]
In the aftermath of the terrorist bombings on New York and Washington attorney general John Ascroft

[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.400]
Pushed hard for the passage of the US Patriot Act

[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.940]
Which presented drastic changes to our nation surveillance laws and granted new intelligence gathering powers for the FBI and other

[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.960]
Agences as our country morteds on parallel losses the bill was pushed through Congress with minimal debate

[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:20.020]
The pay-trade authorized investigators to search a warrant for items in a library or bookstore

[00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:26.880]
Which can include circulation or purchasing databases hard drives user registration information computers and internet files

[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.440]
Prior to the passage of the Patriot Act a library quite agency provides specific evidence to show probable cause

[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.360]
Injustifying why a search was needed for a criminal investigation

[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:41.500]
Now an agent must only explain why he or she believes that the record may be related to an ongoing terrorism or intelligence

[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.000]
Investigation in other words, they just make up whatever crap they want

[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:51.420]
Another troubling aspect is that the proceeding for the warrant takes place in closed court and the information soft

[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:57.260]
Does not have to be directly connected to a suspect and an investigation aside from being forced to release use the records

[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:02.720]
Library staff can't mention that a search has occurred or that items were given to the government due to a standing gag order

[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.460]
Therefore our records can be taken without explanation while we sit tongue tied for bidden to let the general public or fellow library staff

[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:14.800]
No one searches have occurred now comes this paragraph that you should embroider on your ass, okay?

[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.060]
I want you to listen very carefully to every word in this paragraph

[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:28.120]
The US Department of Justice stated in the document released to Congress that these new powers have already been exercised in libraries across the nation for example

[00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:34.020]
A library in Santa Fe, New Mexico reported in February that a user on a library computer

[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:43.180]
Accessed a chatroom and wrote sneering comments about President Bush. He was arrested, handcuffed and interrogated about his writings and online usage

[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.060]
I

[00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:50.880]
You understand the destuplicate track of everyone

[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:56.380]
Hey funny, I mean what is there to say?

[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.380]
God help us a library in Santa Fe, New Mexico reported in February that a user on a library computer

[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:13.280]
Accessed a chat room and wrote sneering comments about President Bush. He was arrested, handcuffed and interrogated about his writings and online usage

[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:21.960]
Read the bedtime story on our website on neo-ranges.com. You're looking at that the hairless picture of Mo also speaking of our website

[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.020]
Our hot couples contest number three is up to a very slow start

[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.060]
I guess they're waiting until we get a little closer to the deadline. Okay, sure

[00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.080]
Maybe they're trying to find somebody to take a naked picture with we do have one naked picture

[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.960]
You only probably promise you don't know if it's a gag if it's for real if it's a party picture

[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.700]
We don't know what it is. Well, it's a party. There's a whole bunch of people standing around a bed

[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:49.040]
And on the bed is this couple this maybe they're hot maybe they're not because you can't see their faces or they're you can't see their push

[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.020]
Miguel said it's fake

[00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:58.020]
Miguel said it's fake. Yep. Face down more close look, but that's what he says based on what what's fake about it?

[00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.540]
That it was altered. It's a fake ass

[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.280]
It's a stunt ass

[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.320]
Hmm

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.600]
Maybe that's why there are no names connected to it. We do have it anyway. Just the email is your picture

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.900]
Okay, let's do another date about that prize because we were talking about it yesterday

[00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:21.340]
Yes, and we do have a hedonism trip as well and what we discussed with Miguel was that the winner can choose which place

[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:27.380]
They want to go to because one one place includes airfare and the other place includes food but no airfare

[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.900]
So they can choose and then the second prize will be the other one

[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.620]
Okay, well, what's the one? What what is the trip to the Bahamas?

[00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.280]
Right the trip to hedonism and Jamaica

[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.600]
hedonism and Jamaica man right which includes food and stuff and drinks but no airfare

[00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.780]
Okay, Bahamas includes airfare, but no food and drink. Okay. Well, we'll go through the whole thing again a little later on

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.800]
I don't want to get behind again like we did yesterday

[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.440]
We'll wind up with like 45 minute breaks because our sales department still hasn't been made alerted

[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.940]
you know, I

[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:00.560]
Think it's the water Nazis fall

[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.120]
12 minutes after 10 at 560 W2Q

[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.700]
I'm out today where they give you the straight poop and that's pizza loft man

[00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:12.140]
Jeff Cohen has been doing it for a long long time and he's going better than ever

[00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:16.760]
In Davie, you'll find him on university drive right between the gripping and 595 behind here

[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.720]
When imports kitty corn of the new armadillo cafe with about four billion free parking spaces right there in front

[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.280]
It's so convenient you can fall in right off university

And they've got delicious chicken and veal and seafood three different kinds of great pizza

[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:34.600]
Calzone super subs and a best-am garlic rules you've ever had in your life just dripping with garlic man your fingers will smell

[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:40.320]
Erotic for months to come and at the pizza loft you won't break the bank either because the portions are gigantic

[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.160]

When it comes to low price delicious fresh goodies if don't get no better than the world flaming pizza law

[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.460]
Yeah

[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:29.760]
Hey go up those checkered pants

[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:30.200]
Oh

[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:36.040]
Gum that's great for

[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.180]
Delish

[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.040]
Well the name stock and soon everybody in the town one of the pieces is squirtalicious gum

[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.500]
Oh, and the big squirtal is for a big-soluble like you today

[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:54.220]
It seems people crave the man's invention even more but the mystery remains what is in the gooey center of that gum

[00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.280]
Oh, I'm not sitting.

[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:58.020]
But do I feel better?

[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.120]
Squat-Olicious, the frame of the unique gum.

[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.660]
1017 at 560 WQM, Happy Friday to you.

[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.320]
Sonny and 70 today in Toronto was a beautiful day here.

[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.080]
And now it probably stopped raining there by now.

[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:10.600]
What, didn't it?

[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:10.880]
Oh yeah.

[00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:12.020]
Got damn time.

[00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:12.540]
Finally, yeah.

[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.120]
Jesus, got almighty.

[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.120]
At any rate, you know, see, this is the typical soft-floater response.

[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.680]
Now, wouldn't you expect that finally, now, yesterday, of course,

[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.640]
for all didn't get on a year.

[00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.640]
We had the lightning strike.

[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.380]
Little Christy was out of the transmitter, didn't work out too good.

[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.020]
And so we never got on the air, except for our 20-minute internet show,

[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.920]
which we thank the very ugly Jim Sarny for mentioning that in his column today in the Sun Sentinel,

[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.640]
that we did a 20-minute internet show, which evidently had a lot of people listening.

[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.040]
And a lot of response on the phone.

[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.960]
But today is this for his debut.

[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:42.300]
And I come on here and I say, well, what do you think?

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.040]
You know, what's the, I mean, I didn't really say that.

[00:14:44.140 --> 00:14:46.420]
But, you know, I'm thinking out, thinking out loud.

[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:46.700]
Right.

[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:47.660]
Were you thinking that out loud?

[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:48.240]
What do you know?

[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.640]
What do you say?

[00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:49.400]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:49.940]
What do you think?

[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:52.840]
Yeah, I mean, we got this big change.

[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.140]
For example, here's the facts.

[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.040]
I mean, before I get started with today's pool and all the other good stuff and bad stuff,

[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.660]
you know, you'd expect, but then again, this is South Florida.

[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.320]
They're just not very forthcoming.

[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.560]
They have nothing to say.

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.760]
Every line and edge board should be lit up now saying,

[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:09.820]
what, that was really a, what a breath of fresh air or man.

[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.620]
He released sucks or what kind of a voice is that, or something, you know?

[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:12.800]

[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:13.220]
Anything.

[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:13.940]
Yes, something.

[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.780]
And there's not one line lit on a board.

[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.920]
There's not one call on there.

[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.240]
What was that call you just had there?

[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.920]
Somebody asking about the story you just read and I told him that it'll be up in about 10 minutes.

[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.140]
And that's something?

[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:27.460]
Yeah.

[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.720]
And everybody's sitting back, like that.

[00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:35.200]
Watching big brother and big sister and big mama and big papa.

[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.120]
What, what a bunch of crap it is, man.

[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.820]
You're living in a, I always used to say we lived in a police state and that was before,

[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.720]
that was before this group of Nazis took over.

[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.560]
That wasn't the good old days.

[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.240]
Right.

[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.720]
That's when we were free.

[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.520]
So to speak, we're litably speaking.

[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.780]
Anyway, here's a fast from the Palm Beach troublemaker who says,

[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.500]
Ray Pharrell versus Mo.

[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.240]
Mo came around barking.

[00:15:58.940 --> 00:15:59.520]
See, that's nice.

[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.620]
Didn't be talking about barking when you lost your little dog.

[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.680]
And I'm not going to read this sick fact that somebody said, you know,

[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.420]
help from your dog.

[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.580]
He's lost on most head.

[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.260]
That's bad.

[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.000]
Although we are getting some calls out to your people they're looking and they want to know what the dog's name is.

[00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:11.840]
We didn't say it on the air.

[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:12.800]
It's what the dogs name.

[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:13.200]
Nikki.

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.960]
Nikki.

[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.560]
What kind of a name is that for a dog?

[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:19.560]
Short for Nicholas Copernicus because, you know, he was prosecuted by the church.

[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.740]
No wonder he ran away.

[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.080]
Well, we don't call that.

[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.760]
No wonder he ran away.

[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:27.700]
Mo came around barking, showing off and spreading like a purebree,

[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:28.820]
thinking it was above it all.

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.720]
His first move to impress us was to try to bite a couple of the smaller dogs' heads off.

[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.660]
Like here is George.

[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.700]
Then when Anthony worked, he tried to suck up to the big dog,

[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.380]
all whimpering and sniffing and looking around asses and balls.

[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.560]
Didn't work, Mo.

[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.120]
Bitch.

[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.800]
It says, how refreshing that the new dog in a block can come into the neighborhood with a,

[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.360]
I'm just one of the guys attitude.

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.580]
Is that his attitude?

[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.220]
Granted, he's a flea bit in Mongrel with no collar and eats out of the dumpster,

[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.320]
but he's not afraid to pal around with the pack.

[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.860]
Ferelle rules from the Palm Beach troublemaker.

[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.400]
See the only done one showing already.

[00:16:58.720 --> 00:16:59.520]
He rules, man.

[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:00.960]
That's what this guy says.

[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.000]
Ferelle rules.

[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.920]
That's what the what's your name said, too, Doreen.

[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.440]
She's a liar.

[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.660]
Here's a call from Boca.

[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:09.900]
Hello.

[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:10.720]
Hello.

[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.260]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.600]
Hey, me how are you?

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:14.480]
Very good.

[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:15.880]
I love Ferelle.

[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:22.200]
I had to use to listen to him on ESPN and I didn't love, didn't enjoy him that much,

[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.320]
but since he's been all with you guys and has a local flavor, he's just great.

[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.700]
Yeah, and the best part about him is he doesn't stick to all the boring sports stuff.

[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.600]
He's all over the place.

[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.900]
He is about 30, about 30, 40% sports.

[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.420]
That's for sure.

[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.080]
He's about 30% sports.

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.580]
Right.

[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.120]
Okay, pal.

[00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:38.620]
I'll go.

[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:38.720]
I'll go.

[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.360]
Put me down.

[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.080]
Have a good one.

[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:41.740]
And you too.

[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.180]
Let's put everybody down.

[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.400]
Here's our poll question for today while you're chewing on this other thing.

[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.620]
They're just adding on.

[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.540]
What kind of people are we dealing with?

[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:52.540]
You know, you ought to know.

[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.660]
I do know by now after all of these years, but it's so depressing.

[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.120]
It's you think, you know, I want to say something here.

[00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.220]
You know, I want to say something.

[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:00.800]
I got an opinion.

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.120]
Not that anybody really gives a crap about your opinion, but you know, we like to pretend that we do.

[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.340]
The whole world is listening.

[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.020]
It's hinging waiting to see your, for your take.

[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:10.840]
What's your take?

[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.580]
And you think they'd be just falling all over each other, get to the phone.

[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.700]
Especially now that we're starting at 10 and we got the new 10 to 2 thing back.

[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:18.040]

[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.080]
Because we love a lot.

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:24.300]
And now that we got a real lead in, if we love a hell of a lot, I'll figure that out.

[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:26.440]
I'm trying to figure out.

[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:27.720]
I love it.

[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:28.820]
That's it.

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.980]
I mean, how can you beat that?

[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.280]
Right?

[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.140]
With a stick.

[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.780]
You can beat it with a stick.

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.180]
With a hockey stick.

[00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.720]
By the way, how about those ducks, huh?

[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.140]
Or did they suck?

[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.740]
I told you.

[00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:42.240]
Koma, they couldn't score into an empty net.

[00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.580]
If they had like 15 guys out there and the devils had like just broodora, they still couldn't score.

[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.800]
Who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.360]
Now, we've done similar polls in the past.

[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.500]
Maybe we did this exact same one, but it's been a long time.

[00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.740]
And the reason I was inspired to do this today is because of all this hoopla about Bob Hope yesterday.

[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.020]
And it's 100th birthday.

[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:01.420]
Right.

[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.040]
Hey, I mean, he can just barely make a sound over and over and over again.

[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:11.600]
Speaking of sounds, here's where I know this is your favorite for the list.

[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.220]
Justin.

[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.820]
Oh, Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.300]
Uh-huh.

[00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:20.220]
Oh, he definitely belongs on.

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:20.680]
Hey, Justin.

[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.620]
Bye, bye, bye.

[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.180]
Yeah, every five minutes.

[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:24.800]
Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.900]
Okay, anyway, who's the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.000]
We got a short list to start.

[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.880]
And I'm sure that I'm not sure of anything.

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.940]
I'm thinking that maybe the audience will add to it.

[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.160]
I'm not sure of anything to wait.

[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:39.020]
This crowd goes, you know, we went through that whole business yesterday.

[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.020]
The station was off the air for day and near three hours.

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.320]
And we somehow managed to, I don't know, put a few of the pieces back together again.

[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.300]
But in South Florida, boy, you're up again.

[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.680]
Oh, and I hate to break the news to you.

[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.280]
But you know that stuff.

[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:50.700]
You've asked me at the end of the show.

[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.960]
What about those art bell people?

[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:54.980]
Yes, forget about it.

[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:55.660]
Really?

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.400]
Oh, yeah, they want me to like start my career all over again.

[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.440]
You didn't read it carefully enough, these people.

[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.120]
You know, they want to like reinventing your Rogers and then syndicate the show to some big come.

[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.320]
I got news for you.

[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.360]
If I'm on here in other two years, that'll be a lot.

[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.680]
Okay, I'm at the end.

[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:12.060]
I'm not looking to start any new, uh, any new adventures.

[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.580]
Okay, you get on there.

[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.940]
All right.

[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.820]
Yeah, you can, well, I'm then piped.

[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:17.180]
I'll listen.

[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:20.080]
Yeah, you and being a boy, you can do a two-spick show.

[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.480]
Anyway, who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.900]
Bob Hope, Mariah Carey, Elvis Presley.

[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.140]
That would be a sacrilegious to say the king.

[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.340]
Dean Martin couldn't sing his word about papers sack.

[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.040]
Bing Crosby, another one.

[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.060]
Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, or Justin Tinkerbell.

[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.720]
I think we've got a great start to this list.

[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:43.260]
There's eight.

[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.020]
That's a good start.

[00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.960]
And we can put like a hundred on here if we want.

[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.140]
Because there's a lot of us, celebrities over the years have been,

[00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:51.080]
and I realize a lot of these are old timers.

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.880]
You know, like Bob Hope.

[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.400]
Bing Crosby, Sinatra.

[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:59.440]
Even Elvis, I mean, our audience ain't in Elvis.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.320]
Now, what is this story?

[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.420]
What is this thing that the Miguel must have just faxed me?

[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:06.400]
This is the, the contest breakdown so that you have the details.

[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:08.700]
Hot couples contest three.

[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.400]
Winner with the most votes has the option of choosing one of two vacation trips.

[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.680]
Choice one, three day two nights stay for two with the Royal Oasis Resort in Cassino and the Bahamas

[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.100]
Mon, all inclusive, transfer his food, drink, gratuities, and entertainment, no airfare.

[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.020]
Winner with the second most votes wins the trip, not chosen by the first couple.

[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.560]
Oh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna swoon from this.

[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.560]
This is so complicated.

[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.100]
Either choice one or two.

[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.920]
And third place, couple with the third most votes gets dinner for two with the pizza lock.

[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.480]
And the only choice you'll have is from whatever's on the menu.

[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.520]
Okay?

[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:46.120]
Okay.

So email us your pictures.

[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:56.400]
Neorongers.com, all you hot couples out there, male and female, male and male, female and female, human and subhuman.

[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.660]
That's contest at Neorongers.com.

[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:01.860]
Now, look at them writing on this facts.

[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.120]
I mean, this is the most chronic facts here, not a bad facts here, but it's just chronic.

[00:22:07.340 --> 00:22:09.720]
Well, I think I'm burned out on Southfoot.

[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.160]
I'm just burned out on the people, you know?

[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.140]
Yeah, you should move.

[00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.420]
No, I'm serious.

[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.980]
I don't like go to Toronto or something.

[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.540]
Yeah, well, that's not for the side.

[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:21.360]
It's just that these people, you look at the writing like yesterday that one scrawly one that was so out of control.

[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.820]
At least I can usually read his crap.

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.380]
It was just so wound up yesterday.

[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.420]
I couldn't even read the stuff.

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.020]
And here's one that says, I know chronic facts here.

[00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:31.000]
And you are absolutely correct.

[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.100]
Where did that library article come from?

[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.340]
I just got through Tonya.

[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:36.040]
It came from the San Francisco Chronicle.

[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:36.760]
It's on the net.

[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.760]
It's on our website.

[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.300]
It's on common dreams.com.

[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.440]
It's all over the place.

[00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.860]
It says, I almost fell off my sheer sheer.

[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.360]
For well, it's a great lead in is what it says here.

[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.920]
Great lead in.

[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.860]
I can listen to my little brother, Hummetallica.

[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.000]
You jerk.

[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.600]
He's a nut all over the place.

[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.020]
Hope George gets the doggy back.

[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.820]
I bet his home life is sucking wind.

[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.380]
Well, boy, that's nothing new.

[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.740]
1026 at 560 WQA.

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.160]

[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.540]

You'll find them a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

Pompello Park, horsepower you can plunge on.

[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.720]
My life and locals, this is support trail by city.

[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.520]
You wait and wait.

[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.100]
You rest, dude.

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.140]
Her bear is pretty nice, the biggest of popular laws.

[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:35.480]
Under your low tank top, it's distracting my whole train of thought.

[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:55.680]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.680]

[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:55.700]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:56.120]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.040]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.860]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:05.460]
I'm not a fan of the city, but I'm not a fan of the city.

[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:31.580]
My real number is 19.

[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.480]
Spongy

[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.380]
1032 at 560 WQM happy Friday to you. Here's a bizarre story.

[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.520]
Did you read this about the Turpin Springs couple? Oh yeah.

[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:56.040]
Couple released after a arrest in fight. A couple was out of jail Wednesday after they

[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:59.680]
were arrested following a fight that started over how much salad the husband made for

[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:07.000]
gas at their Memorial Day party. Well, dear old Garner was released Wednesday on $5,700

[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.440]
bail and faces charges for resisting arrest and using a firearm while drunk. I thought

[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.980]
that was the American F and Y. Now you have to be sober. His wife's an odd. That's a Memorial

[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:21.580]
Day. His wife's sandwich was released Tuesday on her own recognizance. Police said they

[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.640]
were called to the home to investigate a domestic disturbance Monday evening. Police

[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.940]
sergeant Mike Trill told a couple he had to arrest Sandra Garner since he had slapped

[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:33.220]
her husband repeatedly. What a pussy. When police placed his wife in handcuffs, he became

[00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.160]
upset. Few minutes later, dear old Garner was walking toward the police station, he loaded

[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.240]
$357 Smith and Wesson Magnum in his hand. Trill said.

[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.940]
Here you go. Like I said, especially Turpin Springs we're talking about. That's not even

[00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:50.380]
a news story. Here's one for today's poll from Stuttering Kill and Homestead. Share that

[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:55.820]
ugly bitch. He says, I second that emotion kill. We got share on the poll, okay? Now that

[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.700]
story that I read in the beginning, everybody in America should be on this. It was in the San

[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.840]
Francisco Chronicle yesterday. It was written by Susan Hildruth who was the city librarian

[00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:08.460]
of the city of San Francisco. The whole article is read as one paragraph about the paper.

[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:13.840]
I beg your pardon? The whole article is now on the website. Thank you. I'm going to

[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.140]
interrupt no more. The Patriot Act is what this is all about and about what's happening

[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.380]
in the libraries and about what's in general happening to your freedoms, which remember

[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.420]
them? What?

[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:27.000]
That was a lot of fun when we had a few freedoms. In school, I talked about them. Anyway,

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:32.020]
in the middle of this article it says the headline on the story is Big Brother out of our

[00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:37.560]
libraries, Freedom to Read. The US Department, I'm just going to read this one short paragraph

[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.160]
and maybe I'll read it about a hundred times today. The US Department is just as stated

[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.740]
in a document released to Congress that these new powers meaning the Patriot Act have already

[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:51.120]
been exercised in libraries across the nation. For example, a library in Santa Fe, New

[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.240]
Mexico reported in February that a user on a library computer accessed a chat room and

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:00.980]
wrote sneering comments about President Bush. He was arrested, handcuffed and interrogated

[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:06.620]
about his writings and online usage. How do you like them, apples? How do you like them

[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:16.180]
stopping boots? What's there to say about that? But yeah, the land of the used to be free

[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.400]
in the land of the used to be brave. The land of the scared schmittless is what it ought

[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:25.820]
to be. They come in, they steal the goddamn election, they make up all kinds of lies and

[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.520]
stories about weapons of mass destruction or whatever the lie of the day is to kind of

[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.660]
guide them public so they can go in there for all their big beck-tail and halibut and

[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.320]
all their good corporate buddies. And I would have said, oh well, there was no weapons

[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:44.560]
of mass destruction. I didn't know no Godfather. And now we're getting ready to go into a

[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:48.200]
ran-next. That's the new deal. And they just keep planting these stories in the media

[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.040]
which just suck right along. And then this come in Monday June 2nd, I don't want to

[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.600]
get anybody depressed. But this coming Monday June 2nd is the day the FCC is scheduled

[00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:02.780]
to vote. Yeah. On the relaxation of the ownership rules, radio and the TV and newspapers. Yeah.

[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:07.380]
That'll be the final nail of the coffin when three goddamn companies own every radio,

[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.560]
TV, station and newspaper in America. And that's the kind of crap that's being peddled

[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:15.680]
for truth as Howard Beal would say. Then you know, you haven't got a, a Chinaman's chance

[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.620]
in hell. Yeah, well, at least they're not producing massive tax cuts for rich people.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.180]
Right. Thank God they're not doing that. And they're not lying about how much it's going

[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:27.280]
to be because it's going to be well over a trillion dollars, not 350 billion. But the public,

[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.860]
you know, I don't like that. You left this liberal, yeah. Okay. Don't look to us to come

[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:38.740]
and bid your ass out. Here's Tamarack. Hello. Good morning. Neil, how you doing? Okay.

[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.340]
Three quick things for the poll. Rosie O'Fat. Rosie O'Donnell, excellent choice.

[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:50.340]
And for Elle thumbs up and I love them taking a pot shot at the Danny icon.

[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.640]
Well, I didn't hear what he said. What did he say? No, it was when he was in New York and he went

[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:59.980]
up to say a little of the day and about, you know, how he followed his career because he grew up in

[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.960]
Pittsburgh and this and that and just wanted to chat and daddy gave him the cold shoulder.

[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:09.500]
Really? Yeah. So he said, I don't care how big he is, you know, if he didn't respect me,

[00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:13.220]
you know, boom. He says he's a good ball player in this and that, but as far as a person.

[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:19.940]
There you go. Okay. Thanks, Kelly. Back to you. Yeah. I mean, Dan Marino has been criticized by a lot

[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.640]
of people on the callers on his fourth station over the years. He never went to Super Bowl and they

[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:27.300]
ripped him for this and ripped him for that. So why is it that if a rel comes on, somebody thinks

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:31.720]
he's going to get crap for a there. There are no sacred cows on the issues anymore. Okay. The gloves

[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:44.820]
are off. The gloves are off. Right? Is it this moment? Yeah, we got a sexual condom, which are

[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.540]
the best kind, I think. And all kinds of crap going on. You know, between these promos and this

[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:55.840]
new contest, the deal we got going, it'll be 145 before you know it, you know. All I got to do is read

[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:59.860]
those a couple of times then that one paragraph one more time. I think it will have it looked. Look

[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:08.120]
for the Q a m. Look at that. Look for the Q a m this afternoon is what it says here. I think

[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.960]
probably that means the Q a m van, but it just as look for the Q a m right there. New and

[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.760]

[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:43.900]

remind me stop by for more crappy low budget Q a m prizes and food from Atlantic City subs were

[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.840]
I were mixed the difference and Scott ain't interfering anymore, which we say. Oh right. Yeah.

[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.360]
Good news. That's one of the best. That's one of the field good stories of the year.

[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.820]
Don't you think? Oh yeah, I feel good. Here's a Pemberk Pines. Hello. Good morning, Nail.

[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:13.140]
Yes, sir. I think for all was a great lead in. He was very entertaining and he made my morning.

[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.160]
Okay, thanks. All right, bye. Yeah. Well, there you go. He made his morning. Yeah. That's the kind of

[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.500]
stuff we want to hear or or not as the case. Maybe I'm sure there's some people who are going to

[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:34.560]
think he's he's abrasive little gravely maybe. You know what I'm saying? He sure is different.

[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:41.320]
And he sure ain't no more. Oh yeah. He ain't no more. You don't take himself seriously and he's not

[00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:45.740]
a pompous ass that talks in a condescending way talks down to the audience. You know, like he's a

[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.300]
genius and he's got all the answers. And what the hell do you know about life anyway and about a good

[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:55.580]
hair piece? And don't be saying you feel great on the day that you lost your dog. You'll let

[00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:01.840]
your dog get away. That was sarcasm. I be psychotic. I am. Not just over the dog, but over the

[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.740]
crap that you're going to be taking all weekend long. I can't go. I can't go home without this.

[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:12.380]
So what's new about that? Yeah, no, nothing. Let's see, please tell me this is got to be the worst

[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:18.200]
facts in the history of radio. Ain't it though? This has got to be enough to make me want to just

[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:25.980]
scream open up my window and scream. Oh, but I'm going to do the break first because I don't want to

[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:32.280]
like gloss over real quick. Yeah. And I write. Yeah, it's nauseating. So I had to care. Oh my god.

[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.660]
People would taste in their tush. Reckon is what we got. Well, some of them anyway because most

[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:40.340]
everybody else agreed. But not everybody. If everybody agreed, we'll be the point of having a talk show

[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:47.200]
other than to make us some money. Oh, isn't that why we're here? Ah, 20 before 11 at 560 W

[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.200]
to Q. A. M. Homeowner's out there. Is there anything worse on these hot,

[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:54.420]
sulfury summer days than going out to take a little dip in your pool and taking a peak at it?

[00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:59.360]
And the pool too and finding that it's crap. It's stained. It's dirty and cracking and all kinds of

[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.020]
bad stuff. Well, your pool doesn't have to be a mess. No, Mo call our friends at Atlantic Marseille.

Who's gonna get a break the upload?

[00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:31.620]
Put out some good reviews. So, uh, we're right away.

[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:36.860]
Sheldown 20 bombs for a movie class.

[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.800]
A copin' some Milky Ways.

[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.200]
We're the handful of candy.

[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.740]
Went through the doors of that marquee.

[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:50.820]
Damn, I had a first class ticket.

[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.820]
But I was ladies and men can be.

[00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:56.340]
See, I walked into rim-may-treats.

[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:01.320]
I walked into the night, couldn't have fun with the seat.

[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.320]
Then I walked out on the matrix.

[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.180]
I faded hell out, wait for the DVD.

[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:09.440]
Yeah.

[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.680]
10-46-5-60.

[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.260]
Thanks, Lynn.

[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.000]
Lynn Samuel's emailed me and alerted me to this article from Information Clearing House in

[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.380]
regard of this same thing about the guy that was arrested.

[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:18.820]
Yeah.

[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:20.140]
More information.

[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:24.180]
Santa Fe Police arrested Tony for comments he made in an internet chat room.

[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:29.580]
A St. John's College Library visit by a former public defender was abruptly interrupted

[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:34.740]
February 13 when a city- when city police officers arrested him about 9 p.m. at the computer

[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:40.920]
terminal he was using, handcuffed him and brought him to arrested him at the computer terminal he was using.

[00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:42.980]
That is bad.

[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.680]
Handcuffed him and would you shut up?

[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.340]
Handcuffed him and brought him to the Santa Fe New Mexico police station for questioning by secret

[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.020]
service agents from Albuquerque.

[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:56.260]
Andrew J. O'Connor, 40, who was released for about 5 hours, about 5 hours later, said in the

[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:00.700]
February 16 Santa Fe New Mexican I'm going to sue secret service, Santa Fe Police, St. John's

[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.040]
and everybody involved in this whole thing.

[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.660]
According to O'Connor, the agents accused of making threatening remarks about President

[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.380]
George W. Bush in an internet chat room admitting he talked politics face-to-face in the library

[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.780]
with a woman who was wearing a no-war-with-a-ranked button.

[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.160]
O'Connor recalled saying that Bush is out of control, but that I'm allowed to say all that.

[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.280]
There's this thing called freedom of speech, he said. He also speculated that the FBI might have

[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.920]
been observing him because of his one-time involvement in a pro-Palestinian group in Boulder,

[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:31.800]
Colorado. Earlier on the same day, O'Connor was questioned officials at St. John's as well as

[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:36.220]
the Collins of Santa Fe and Santa Fe Community College issued warnings to students and faculty

[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.580]
that the FBI had been alerted to the presence of suspicious people on campus within the past four

[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:47.080]
weeks. Concern about threats to individual privacy under the USA Patriot Act is prompted to

[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:51.340]
Mexico legislators in both houses to propose resolutions urging state police not to

[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.380]
help federal agents in fringe on civil rights. The resolution also encouraged libraries to

[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.760]
post prominent signage warning papers that their library records are subject to federal scrutiny

[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:05.520]
without their permission or knowledge. How do you like that? I don't.

[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:13.400]
Jesus Christ and a public has sent back, oh this guy is great, he's doing a wonderful job

[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:15.720]
that we went in there and kicked some of that in Rakyas.

[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.140]
Yeah.

[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:18.580]
How's Sodom doing, by the way, and Osama Yamama?

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:19.220]
How they doing?

[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:20.420]
They're not important anymore.

[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:22.200]
Anyway, getting back to this other facts,

[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.920]
which is small potatoes after reading that.

[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.900]
But this does piss me off.

[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.780]
I mean, everybody's entirely your own taste.

[00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:30.800]
When we talked about movies for those couple of weeks,

[00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.220]
and we recommended a lot of things

[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:34.120]
that I really enjoyed, and George enjoyed,

[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.360]
and even Bonerboy, whatever.

[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.820]
And we don't expect that everybody out there

[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:38.500]
is going to like them.

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.140]
But listening to this, it says,

[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.380]
Neil, please tell me you've been joking all along

[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.340]
while rambling on about what a great, great movie

[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.900]
Reckless and Poor Dream is.

[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:49.680]
I wasted two hours of my life on the worst Dreck

[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.520]
I've ever seen since natural born killers.

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.680]
Absolutely awful.

[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.800]
You had a car the other day who I thought agreed with me

[00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.660]
when he toured you the movie.

[00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.060]
Absolutely blew me away.

[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.860]
He had the first two words exactly right.

[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.380]
In the words of the mad dog,

[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.920]
do do poo poo kaka.

[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:04.840]
It really sucked.

[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:07.560]
This follows George's recommendation

[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.340]
of at close range a few months ago.

[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:09.980]
More Dreck.

[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.340]
But as you said many times,

[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:14.620]
there's vanilla bean spec ice cream in fish food,

[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.820]
different strokes for different folks

[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:17.440]
is what it says.

[00:39:17.520 --> 00:39:18.580]
Number you have a stroke myself.

[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.680]
Just reading this.

[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.880]
Wonder what they think.

[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:22.300]
In fact, you know something?

[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.280]
This is probably somebody who likes vanilla bean spec ice cream.

[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.820]
See, I like fish food myself.

[00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:28.660]
It's got some taste.

[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.400]
It's exciting.

[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:31.240]
It's delicious.

[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:32.740]
It'll kill you.

[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.140]
But there are bland people out there

[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.180]
with crappy taste who like vanilla ice cream.

[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:42.220]
And it's like vanilla.

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:44.180]
Like what was that?

[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.480]
Like I can't even think of anything that's bland

[00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.420]
or that vanilla ice cream.

[00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.600]
Can you be side boner boy?

[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:49.640]
Ice or milk?

[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.060]
I'm trying to think of something to compare it to.

[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.620]
I can't.

[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.500]
It's just so boring.

[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.420]
A snow cone with no syrup.

[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:58.800]
Yeah.

[00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:04.140]
It would be like having ice cream with no flavor.

[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.100]
I haven't spoken to anyone who's seen that movie

[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:10.500]
that wasn't just blown away in a good way.

[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:13.060]
And also I should put out the facts is unsigned.

[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.720]
Which, you know, I mean, you could even make up a name.

[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.860]
You don't even have the balls to put your name behind it.

[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:18.740]
You're entitled to your taste, but your taste sucks.

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.120]
Okay.

[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.220]
And if you want to tell me that you wasted time watching

[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.480]
Rick William for a dream, then I would agree with it.

[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:25.200]
You wasted your time because you're too stupid.

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.780]
I understand what a great movie really is.

[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.900]
And I wouldn't get or ordinarily.

[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.860]
I wouldn't get bent out of shape about almost any other movie.

[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.840]
Because like he says, we all got different taste.

[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.520]
But that it's a phenomenal movie.

[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:35.320]
What's not to like?

[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:36.380]
The acting is brilliant.

[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.860]
And especially for people living South Florida, man.

[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.140]
I mean, that's where it's at.

[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.040]
That is South Florida.

[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.940]
It would define right there in that two hours.

[00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.280]
I'm telling you, I think he's with our violent.

[00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:47.280]
Let's see.

[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.380]
Even here agrees.

[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:53.720]
You know, that's the thing I love about him is he's just spastic.

[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.260]
I don't have any idea what he's saying or what he's talking about.

[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.260]
And it doesn't make any difference.

[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:57.820]
Neither does he.

[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.220]
He's just a spaz.

[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.540]
And the word from inside the building is,

[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.700]
I don't want to mention it from Bonerboy.

[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.220]
But the word inside the building is to look at him

[00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:07.380]
and to watch his behavior.

[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.020]
He's just a spastic in person.

[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:09.820]
He's on the air.

[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:10.100]
Yeah.

[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.400]
Who would like shaking and quaking and just hyper.

[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.440]
That's what a lot of that Jack Daniels do for you.

[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:22.000]
And Jim Bean and Diet Coke.

[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.260]
Let's see.

[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.520]
George put up some bright orange and neon colored lost dog posters.

[00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:28.240]
The bright colored signs really catch your eye.

[00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.220]
Hope it helps.

[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:31.460]
I think that's the suggestion.

[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:33.600]
Oh, we're on it.

[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.120]
Are you on it as far as the posters go?

[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.220]
Anybody find Nikki yet?

[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:38.560]
No.

[00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:39.420]
Well, let's go.

[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:41.280]
Let's find George's little pomeranian.

[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.260]
Okay, this is depressing.

[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.700]
Yeah, I'm trying not to get to the because it is Friday.

[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:45.500]
Right.

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.940]
And I don't want to be depressed all weekend because Georgia is

[00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:48.520]
responsible.

[00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.200]
Okay, Madonna's a good choice.

[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:51.940]
Now it could happen.

[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:52.240]
Anybody.

[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.020]
My dogs got loose a few several times over the years.

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.520]
But of course, they came right back because they know that

[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.680]
after about five minutes, I would just go back inside the house

[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.440]
and shut the door.

[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.180]
You know, you know, something with my little dog that worked.

[00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.140]
Would you find me?

[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:09.020]
No, no, that that tactic work because after a while I got on to his

[00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:09.500]
bull crap.

[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.140]
So when he would get out because I knew he would never go more than

[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:13.920]
a half a block away because he was scared crap.

[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:14.240]
Let's.

[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.160]
And so I would just shut the door and so after maybe four or five

[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.360]
minutes out here, he'd be at the front door barking just sitting

[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.000]
there at the front door.

[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.880]
This one's too curious for its own good.

[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:24.600]
Is it really?

[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:25.180]
Oh, yeah.

[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.860]
I wonder where he got that.

[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:28.800]
Gloria Stefan.

[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.640]
There's an excellent choice for our poll today.

[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.340]
The most overrated celebrity of all time.

[00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:33.920]
She makes me gag, man.

[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.880]
And Ricky Martin.

[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.120]
She makes me gag too.

[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.160]
You know, one thing about Ricky.

[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.360]
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing, especially when she talks about

[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.460]
her hot dates with chicks.

[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.900]
That is a, I mean, who the hell would believe that?

[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.060]
You know, she floats like a butterfly that Ricky five six seven

[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.620]
old five 60 pound five 60 on the 80.

[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.820]
Now we're going to get the new poll up there because I'm sure

[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:57.960]
that we already got a whole bunch of good the choices on here

[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.120]
that will give many, many votes.

[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.920]
I don't want to start getting all over Eric's case again,

[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:01.480]
but I will.

[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:06.000]
He just called wondering when when he should now now this moment.

[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.700]
And we'll add to it because this is obviously when we got the

[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:12.060]
whole weekend, a hate of us, right?

[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:13.900]
Got the whole weekend ahead.

[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.820]
So this is one that will, you know, we're going to finish

[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.840]
up by we'll tie it all up by the end of the show, which is

[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.360]
two o'clock.

[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.480]
By the way, a lot of people yesterday called in during that

[00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:24.160]
one to two hour and they were like squeezing it, man.

[00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:25.220]
They were excited about it.

[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.860]
You realize that we went through an entire four hours, well,

[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.540]
three hours and 20 minutes once we got on here.

[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.940]
We didn't have one female caller yesterday in a whole show.

[00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:32.800]
Gee, that's new.

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:36.020]
No, I mean, it's happened before, but it just it just dawns on me.

[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.460]
There's something really, really very bizarre about the

[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.400]
women of South Florida.

[00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.340]
There's something I can't put my finger on it.

[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.400]
And I don't want to, which is a good thing for me, boy.

[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.540]
What a great place to be a fag.

[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:50.880]
South Florida almost as great as Toronto.

[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.020]
Well, the people here look a lot.

[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.680]
I just shut up.

[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:58.480]
Pull it up from the original head.

[00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:04.160]
Obsessed and moment of mean time is continuing to try to

[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:07.500]
well, you know, I guess when you get to be like almost 70 and

[00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.560]
all of a sudden you got to, you know, you see your career in

[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:11.860]
your life spinning in front of your eyes and you got to get up

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.020]
three o'clock in the morning every day.

[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:15.020]
And then you go on the internet and you look on our website

[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:15.880]
and you see that picture.

[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.460]
It would make it a difference if I looked at that 400 times

[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:21.660]
today.

[00:44:21.720 --> 00:44:23.460]
I still just crank up every time I look at it.

[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.900]
It's just it's just a magnificent.

[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.220]
It represents him in so many different ways.

[00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:27.740]
You know what I mean?

[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.140]
I'm sure you do.

[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.320]
Here's homestead.

[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:31.600]
Hello.

[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.300]
Neil, how's it going?

[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:34.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:34.460]
How you be?

[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.440]
Hey, Scotty.

[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.040]
For else moved up to number two.

[00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.400]
Now you're still number one.

[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.060]
But I listen to him in California.

[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.920]
He's really a breath of fresh air.

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.380]
And maybe this means that more hours on the way out.

[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:45.100]
Could be.

[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.980]
Then we could give him my bye, bye, bye.

[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.780]
We're going to give him a bye, bye, bye party.

[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:52.300]
Sounds great.

[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.480]
I come back to town for that.

[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.740]
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.

[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.460]
Hey, did you?

[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:58.580]
I know you probably didn't see this, but I know if George

[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.340]
talked you there was a guy in homestead the other day that

[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.960]
commandeered a bus of school bus naked after stealing the

[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.300]
gallon of milk and you had the driver take him to a hospital.

[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.040]
Excellent.

[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.080]
That sounds like a difficult sound for the story.

[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.100]
Probably need to make the newspaper.

[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.060]
No, it did.

[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:14.820]
It made the newspaper.

[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:16.580]
Apparently that cops arrested him there.

[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.640]
He he supposedly was high on cocaine.

[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.320]
Like I said, difficult sound for the story.

[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.300]
Okay, pal, I'm glad you enjoyed for well.

[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.260]
Thanks.

[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:28.200]
Well, they want to hear the sound of their own voice.

[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:28.940]
What's wrong with that?

[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:30.120]
Don't you want to hear the sound of your voice?

[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.380]
No, either there's anybody else.

[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.440]
That was bad.

[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.360]
That was a layup.

[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.220]
I thought coming.

[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:35.380]
That was bad.

[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.380]
George did a wonderful job at even Bonerboy really contributed

[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:42.500]
a magnificent, especially on Monday with all those tapes and

[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:42.980]
drop-ins.

[00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.900]
Don't ever play a best-up tape again no matter what they tell you.

[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:46.140]
Okay.

[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:46.800]
Got it.

[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.140]
Okay.

[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.020]
Seriously, don't ever play one of those again.

[00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.020]
If they if they, like once the next major holiday,

[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:53.320]
Labor Day, no, the fourth of July.

[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.800]
The fourth of July, what's going to be happening on the fourth of July?

[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:02.380]
A show, I'm sure that's not like, yeah, take it seriously holiday.

[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:03.340]
Right.

[00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.020]
You're not going to be working on that day.

[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:06.040]
I'm not.

[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:08.440]
In fact, you're probably still looking for your little dog on a guide.

[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.200]
No, I hope not.

[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:10.600]
I hope you find this weekend.

[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.460]
Nine-year-old dog.

[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.140]
I thought it was just like a little puppy baby.

[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:15.560]
Maybe maybe eight.

[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.000]
It's just a one maybe eight.

[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.740]
You know, you're losing your credibility with this dog.

[00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:23.600]
Real fancy audience is going to say you're irresponsible to have a dog.

[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.260]
The wife's dog.

[00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:25.700]
Or it's the wife's the one.

[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:26.480]
There's a present.

[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.600]
1058 at 560 WQM.

[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.460]
Here's something that's like a real president.

[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.460]
It's the lights of Westboker where they have presents for all you fat people out there.

[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.440]
They've got all the Atkins products.

[00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.500]
They've got all the products in the world for low-carb, sugar-free diets,

[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:40.520]
Atkins and all the others.

[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.500]
And now they got new stuff as they always do.

[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:46.920]
The new Almonds snack cakes by control carb that come in blueberry banana or classic almond.

[00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:52.420]
The serving is only got one effect of gram of carbs or sample the lights new chocolate raspberry muffin with only one gram of carbs.

[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.960]
If you like something to crunch on something crunchy and mungy,

[00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:57.640]
then travel under their three new flavors of low-carb racquet chips.

[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:03.420]
So whether it's carbolite, ice cream, bread, rolls, cheesecakes, chocolates, pasta, sauces, or any other,

Hello!

[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:52.020]
Hello!

[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:53.580]
I'm...

[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:55.860]
I'm Mary and Faith Bearsley.

[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.820]
You're probably knowing me now, it's me, me!

[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.960]
The white house in turn.

[00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.340]
I may love to JFK.

[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.460]
I have to live on his neck and suck his ear long.

[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.480]
Because that's the way he liked it.

[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.700]
He'd grab my skirt.

[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:13.260]
Huh?

[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:19.740]
And I get to top off my blouse and spike it.

[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:24.420]
Yeah, that's the way he liked it.

[00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:28.220]
Here in the summer of 61.

[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:37.360]
Next when I'm in JFK, give a hug and have some fun.

[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.980]
Then we went all the way.

[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:43.860]
Gosh, that's the way.

[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.960]
He liked it.

[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:55.080]
Everyone grabbed my skirt and I get to top off my blouse and I spiked it.

[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.400]
Yeah, that's the way he liked it.

[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.720]
We get it in the mood.

[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:03.800]
We get it in the mood.

[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.140]
We may love on airport one.

[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.840]
One time he picked me up from school.

[00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:17.600]
For a threesome with Maryline Monroe.

[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:18.420]
Oh, black.

[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:20.080]
That's the way everybody.

[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.620]
He liked it.

[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:30.440]
He'd grab my skirt and I get to top off my blouse and spike it.

[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.220]
Yeah, that's the way he liked it.

[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.580]
11.04.5.60 W.D.Q.M.

[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:38.300]
The pool is up.

[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.580]
Who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.500]
And speaking of Marilyn Monroe, which we just heard,

[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:46.660]
here is a DJ Valentine.

[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:47.940]
He has her right on top of the list.

[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:50.220]
Here's four more for you.

[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.860]
Jay Leno, that's mine.

[00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.560]
I mean, he to me just, he leaves me.

[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.380]
You talk about somebody with no talent.

[00:49:57.380 --> 00:49:58.160]
He's not funny.

[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.720]
He to look at him is it painful.

[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.860]
And he just inherited Carson's gig.

[00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:03.880]
That's all other than that.

[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.400]
How do you like him?

[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:06.200]
Hate him.

[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.700]
Marilyn Monroe, Carson, what the hell do you do daily?

[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.200]
Is also on the DJ Valentine's list.

[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:14.500]
Carson daily, Julia Roberts and Will Smith.

[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.740]
Now, here's one that they just don't get it, see.

[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.240]
Most overrated celebrity, Jay Feeder.

[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:22.780]
We're not talking sports people.

[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.520]
Okay, you got it?

[00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.040]
Oh, good.

[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.560]
Jay Feeder.

[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.120]
I mean, Jay tries hard.

[00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:30.400]
I don't want to get into a sports thing, but I will say since I'm, you know,

[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:33.100]
I have an opinion on every god damn thing.

[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.420]
Jay Feeder tries hard.

[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.440]
He's not a great athlete.

[00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.400]
He's not a great quarterback.

[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:37.720]
He's never going to be the dolphins.

[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.300]
They'll ever win the Super Bowl with him a quarterback.

[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.540]
But he he tries hard.

[00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:41.600]
He's a guy.

[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:42.620]
He's an overachiever.

[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:44.160]
You know, so you give him points for that.

[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:45.400]
You don't want to knock him too much.

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:46.640]
But he's not a great quarterback.

[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:47.540]
And never will be.

[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:50.200]
There's nothing else to say about that.

[00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.300]
He just, you know, he's a journeyman who gives it a good shot.

[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.840]
And, okay, what can you say?

[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.000]
5, 6, 7, oh, I think probably somebody who's anti-semantic.

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.280]
Oh, okay, facts, don't you?

[00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:01.040]
Yep.

[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.460]
Probably George wrote it.

[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:05.840]
Well, George is under a lot of stress, you know, he's trying to find his damn little door.

[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.580]
That is so bad.

[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:08.140]
Yeah.

[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.640]
That is so sad.

[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.080]
Here's Pembroke Park.

[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:15.420]
Hello.

[00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:17.320]
Hey, Mr. Rogers, how are you today, sir?

[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.080]
Okay.

[00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:18.680]
Good, good.

[00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.440]
Martha Stewart.

[00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:21.180]
Martha Stewart, you good choice.

[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:21.680]
That bitch.

[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:22.480]
Yeah, definitely.

[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.460]
Definitely overrated.

[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:24.800]
Definitely overrated.

[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:25.760]
And that's it.

[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:25.900]
Thank you, sir.

[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:27.060]
Okay, thank you.

[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:27.740]
Have a great weekend.

[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:28.020]
Thank you.

[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:28.200]
Bye.

[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.740]
Okay, we're taking the choices for our pool.

[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:37.540]
Also comments on the MOV versus the new lead-in we got now for Relo and the radio, who's on for me to attend every morning.

[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:39.320]
A part of spilled milk.

[00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:40.140]
You see?

[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.960]
Like I told you, I enjoyed just a little tidbit to him like that.

[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:49.980]
So it's a good way to like ease yourself into him as opposed to the culture shock you get.

[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.120]
Oh, yeah, I saw this story.

[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.260]
A man caught on KISS cam arrested at Reds Game.

[00:51:54.380 --> 00:52:01.500]
A man wandered on parole violations returned to jail after his parole officer spotted him kissing his girlfriend in a live crowd shot on the scoreboard at a Reds Game.

[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.140]
They always have those KISS cams, you know, right?

[00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:05.120]
You've seen that.

[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.860]
Even somebody hates sports like you.

[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:11.780]
And then of course when they put the couple on her to suppose to kiss and the crowd, and sometimes they don't.

[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:17.020]
And of course sometimes they'll put two guys on her, especially if they're wearing, you know, like jerseys for the visiting theme.

[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.080]
Are they supposed to kiss?

[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.500]
Well, that's the idea.

[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.840]
And sometimes they do, which really freaks them out.

[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:27.840]
So I guess that'll teach him he won't be doing that again through Reds Game or any of places else anytime soon.

[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:33.320]
Here's a chronic factor says I'm a lifelong moderate Republican who was terrified of this guy George W.

[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.620]
I'm afraid where this country's future is if he's reelected.

[00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.900]
I'm also very nervous with his Homeland Security deal.

[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:46.640]
The story you read did anger and concern me, but when I heard the arrested man had former Palestinian ties, I could definitely see the justification in that.

[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.860]
He had former Palestinian ties.

[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:59.120]
I see right on the mall up the line of all up anybody who's a pro Palestinian line them all up, especially if they dare to criticize our fearless leader.

[00:52:59.240 --> 00:52:59.720]
Right.

[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:05.780]
And we also have the stories that today was yesterday with the story about the person of interest.

[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:09.200]
It was a very hot fill.

[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.760]
Was it Stephen had to feel about how they're like following him morning noon?

[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:15.460]
I heard it's on today's website.

[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.620]
Yeah, still hot fill.

[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.100]
Here it is USA today.

[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.920]
Anthrax investigators tale scientists 24 seven.

[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:28.380]
For 10 months, Stephen had felt hasn't been able to go to the store, take a walk or be interviewed for a job without being tailed by the FBI.

[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:41.460]
Hat fill 48, the only person identified publicly by the Justice Department as a person of interest in the investigation of the anthrax attacks two years ago, has been kept under 24 seven surveillance by FBI agents who haven't been subtle.

[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:46.300]
They routinely follow him in several cars and trucks and they take pictures of him wherever he goes.

[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:54.880]
Earlier this month, had full and his watchers clashed on the street in Georgetown, had full says in FBI employee driving one of the tail vehicles ran over his foot.

[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.740]
Washington police gave had full a ticket for walking to create a hazard.

[00:53:59.540 --> 00:53:59.980]
God.

[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:01.280]

[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:10.760]
The FBI's tactics appear to be designed to put pressure on him, a former researcher at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland.

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:18.900]
But for law enforcement sources familiar with the anthrax probe say the real reason for the round the clock surveillance is rooted in the FBI's new mission of providing terrorism.

[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:27.080]
FBI officials believe they can't risk the embarrassment of losing track of had to leave them for a few hours and then being confronted with more anthrax attacks.

[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:31.180]
He has not been charged so the FBI's got no basis to seize his passport.

[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.480]
Another reason my agents continue to tell him.

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.160]
I think he ought to like head out to the airport every day.

[00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.360]
Not going anywhere, just hang out, just to aggravate them. You don't get them like all nervous and on edge.

[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:45.380]
Give them like a mill town moment every day. You can always buy a ticket, cash it in.

[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:51.540]
There you go. You don't have to buy a ticket. All you got to do is take a cab to the airport and then just take a cab back home.

[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:59.600]
560-560-050560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line on a spectacular Friday.

[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:03.180]

We'll be out at Bell Sightles, Boulevard of Savings located on Northwest 36th Street.

[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:30.260]
Just west of 27th Avenue in Miami where they have no idea who either Georgia or Bonerboy are.

[00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:34.300]
Stop by for prizes and free food from Atlantic City subs and they do know what that is.

[00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:37.780]
So get through early, please. They come at it. It's sandwich a guy.

[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.480]
It's sandwich a guy. Georgia be the sandwich a guy out there.

[00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.760]
So be sure and get there early. He'll be there 11-1. I could there like 10-40 would be good.

[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:47.400]
Here's a call from Plantation. Hello.

[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:50.760]
Yeah, I just like to say I love mulls. Yeah.

[00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:55.480]
I love the New Jersey Devils and I love my country for getting our gas down nice and low.

[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:57.280]
Okay, now how much you paying?

[00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:01.340]
Yeah, getting it nice and low. You paying low price for gas?

[00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.480]
I got a spigot at my house. Yeah. How do you like that?

[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.620]
In other words, whatever I say, I'm wrong and he's a Mr. contrary.

[00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.440]
There's a new Mr. contrary. Let's hear it.

[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:14.060]
You know something, everything that you just said it all fits in perfect, at least you're consistent.

[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:21.260]
Everything that is anxious, obnoxious, and unacceptable, you relate to which I think you know, look in the mirror sweetheart.

[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:27.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and by the way, the Devils, the Devils will be the end of the National Hockey League.

[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:31.680]
Anybody who could watch the finals this year, these two games are watched in period.

[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.800]
It's enough to put you in an absolute 20 year coma.

[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.580]
Awful. This is exactly what's wrong with a sport.

[00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:43.620]
Great Batman says, oh, there's no problem. We just make the net a little bit bigger.

[00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:47.400]
Right. A disgrace and a disaster.

[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.420]
You can't complain about the action because there isn't any.

[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.320]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:55.380]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[00:56:55.740 --> 00:57:02.860]
I was going to ask you where the naked kids are of great weed to go out and hire a person.

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.300]
I don't even like that. But after this, you probably have to make it pitch.

[00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:11.280]
Yeah. He's got naked pictures of me in a billy go.

[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:15.560]
No, no, no. You don't like him. You're the first caller that doesn't like him.

[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.240]
No, no, no, quite the opposite. Oh, by the opposite. I'm saying.

[00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:25.940]
So what does that mean? Well, for great, for great weed to go out and actually hire someone who works something is a surprise.

[00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:28.620]
And I was saying, well, maybe somebody got some naked pictures.

[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.460]
I see. I got you. Okay.

[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:31.440]
All right.

[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:35.820]
It's my first time I'm used to sign a Bob knew how to top of my list.

[00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.780]
And also I was going to mention real slip.

[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:42.300]
There's a photo of this wife, Jada, whatever name.

[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:42.980]
Think it.

[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:43.820]
Uh,

[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:45.220]
stick and

[00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:47.660]
stick tongue down one of a

[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:47.860]
uh,

[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:49.040]
cold

[00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:52.500]
stars on the movie shoes just saying, all right.

[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:57.220]
Yeah, I mean big tongue right down a throat and up to the blowy stoppicus.

[00:57:57.220 --> 00:57:58.140]
All right.

[00:57:58.500 --> 00:57:59.220]
Anyway, uh,

[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:00.080]
little deep rock.

[00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.080]
I'm gonna miss a may.

[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:01.540]
Well,

[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:03.240]
okay.

[00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:04.700]
Are we mid-erg?

[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:06.000]
Wow.

[00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:09.300]
So we still have any negative votes on Farrell?

[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:09.840]
How do you like that?

[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:10.420]

[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.220]
12 minutes past 11 at 560.

[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.240]
WQ I am.

[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.540]
Oh, look at that. What the hell is that?

[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.520]
I just did the most bizarre thing.

[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.680]
Why I don't want to tell you about it?

[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:21.720]
Oh, come on.

[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.640]
Oh, on the DCS.

[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:23.200]
I just, uh,

[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:24.680]
I just accidentally hit my mouse.

[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.060]
It's 1113 at QM.

[00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:28.620]
See how the time is moving along real fast.

[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:30.780]
Just keep giving the time before you notice another minute ahead.

[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:32.720]
We got some votes on the poll.

[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.120]
It's up.

[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.380]
Who was or is the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[00:58:35.860 --> 00:58:36.960]
We got, uh, what?

[00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:37.800]
What do we got?

[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.780]
Because there's a lot of zero there.

[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:40.740]
52 votes.

[00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:44.820]

and nobody else has any votes yet.

[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:01.920]
Are we adding about New Heart?

[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.080]
Yeah, why not?

[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:03.420]
Okay.

[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.480]
That dark eye.

[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.380]
Don't like Bob New Heart.

[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.760]
Okay, is these two pasty, two pasty white?

[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:11.140]
You know, the Neil Deals keep on rolling out from Tom Laman and Joe Prieto

[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:11.960]
at Hell of Pontiac GMC.

[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:14.240]

cars, trucks, SUVs?

[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.980]
And don't be worried about getting turned on for credit because they're not picky like most car dealers.

[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.240]
Even if you have marginal credit, even if he wants new for well out of town,

[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:10.020]
they'll still probably be able to cut you deal.

[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:39.940]
I am your host, this is 420 of my city, you way up.

[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.880]
Friday you bastard.

[01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:46.880]
Roll another blunt.

[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.360]
EAT.

[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:51.200]
Oh, I'm scared.

[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:09.960]
I'm scared.

[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.160]
I'm scared.

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:16.160]

[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.860]
I'm scared.

[01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.940]
I'm scared.

[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:44.480]
I'm scared.

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.480]

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.480]

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.480]

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.480]

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.480]

[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:44.500]
I'm scared.

[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:44.520]
I'm scared.

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:44.520]

[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:44.840]
I'm scared.

[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:45.780]
I'm scared.

[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:45.780]

[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:45.780]

[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.460]
I was gonna go to court, before I got high.

[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:02.300]
I was gonna pay my child's support, but then I got high.

[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:03.760]
No, you get...

[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.940]
And I know why, I'm scared.

[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:11.020]
Because...

[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:15.760]
Because...

[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:19.600]
I was thinking I run from the cops, but I was high.

[01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:21.100]
Oh, I'm serious, man.

[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:25.460]
I was gonna pull right over and stop, but I was high.

[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:32.060]
Oh, la la la la, that never-one-bothera-plea-cheekin' I know why, why, baby.

[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.900]
Cause I got high, because I got high, because I got high.

[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.320]
La la la, that, that-that-that.

[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:41.380]
I was gonna make love to you.

[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:43.100]
Oh, you know how I got high, huh?

[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:43.440]
Come on, then.

[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:43.900]
I'm serious.

[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.940]
I was gonna eat your pussy, too.

[01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:47.420]
Oh!

[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:47.680]
Ugh!

[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:51.140]
I Look at that, that, that…

[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.760]
No, I'm jacket off.

[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:54.300]
And I know why.

[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:54.860]
Don't-

[01:02:54.860 --> 01:03:04.340]
I miss the whole entire life.

[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:32.520]
Yeah, because I got hot

[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:33.880]
Lost my keys and white

[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:34.320]
Like a like a hot

[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:39.880]
on

[01:03:47.540 --> 01:03:57.080]
take you且

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:57.080]

[01:03:57.080 --> 01:04:00.340]
W T q a

[01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:06.440]
How are Burton's Iraq Afghanistan contracted 600 million and growing and guess what this news stories from that I just print it out

[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:11.680]
I give up Fox news channel. No, how do you like that? All right wing spin all day

[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.800]
But nevertheless here it is

[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.880]
Vice President Dick Cheney's former company already is guarded more than 600 million dollars in military work

[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:25.100]
Related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and potentially could earn billions more without having to compete with other companies

[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.620]
As the army sole provider of troop support services

[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:32.640]
Halibut and Kellogg Brown and roots of city areas receive work orders totaling

[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.620]
529.4 million dollars later to the two wars under a 10-year contract that has no spending ceiling

[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:43.180]
Rather than put the Iraq workup forbidding the government is usually

[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:50.840]
2001 Halibut in contract to place the various work orders in Iraq prompting criticism from some Democrats that Cheney's former company is receiving

[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:57.420]
Favorite treatment the amount Halibut and could receive in the future is virtually limitless said representative Henry Waxman

[01:04:57.420 --> 01:05:01.440]
Democratic California who disclosed the troop support order work orders yesterday

[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:07.160]
It's simply remarkable that a single company could earn so much money from the war in Iraq says old Henry

[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.460]
with this big vault spot

[01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.100]
How do you like that?

[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.680]
Billions just the coincidence

[01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:19.680]
For that kind of so happy for the low price of gas that he's got right now

[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:26.240]
Don't confuse these people with the facts man. They'll rationalize it. They'll make it come out. How are they?

[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.800]
5 6 7 0 plus he's a devil's fan. You know they're about 40 of them

[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.640]
What do you think?

[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.180]
Here's Delray Beach. Hello

[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:42.840]
Neil yes, sir. Hey, you know that whole Halibut and saying if you read into that article further

[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:48.660]
All those decisions were made like over a year ago. So that only

[01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:56.120]
Confirmed that this whole Iraq war was thought of way back four years ago man

[01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.620]

[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.940]
Pay millions to go see him because he's dumb and they can relate to him just like our president good

For all

[01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:58.640]
Yeah, you don't think that Brad the burger sounds just like him a little bit now that you estimate

[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:05.100]
Give that baby up next break and let's give it a shot. Okay. I love you. See you, Pally. Bye. Bye

Mariah Carey seven you know see she doesn't get the message

[01:10:37.480 --> 01:10:41.260]
She's one of those people in denial nobody buys her albums anymore

[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.700]
Luis told her to take a crap and get lost and

[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:48.260]
And nobody wants anything to do with that bitch and she just continues trying to make these comebacks

[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:52.860]
She can't sing for crap. She's got that one big misshapen breast in the middle of her chest

[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:56.540]
And she's nauseating and she just don't get the message. She's kind of like Moe

[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.580]
Never seen the two of them together

[01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.760]

[01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:40.300]
What do you mean a joke has tole called off the air to say

[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.240]
They're making the best of what they got and you know power to the people they're

[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.500]
What he said yeah, they're making the best of what they got right y'all hang on to what y'all got

[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.640]
Until Moe gets tired. I mean

[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.060]
Till they get more the rest of the way out the door and then they can go back to two to six

[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:02.480]
See like I said yesterday Joe be the good Italian boy that he is he's like a human accordion so they can expand or contract

[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:08.140]
They can open it up and close it back. They can do two to five to the six whatever whatever it takes to get the job done

[01:12:09.820 --> 01:12:14.540]
And you heard what for well did the a churdle the other day when I said when you're gonna be doing six to ten you remember that?

[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:18.620]
Oh, yeah, it won't be long. It won't be long. They'll have the moment out the door

[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:23.480]
Now I guess guilty can do the updates which which that at least would be respectable the one thing about the forrel thing

[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.160]
I feel so bad for him. They settled him with the beast. Why did they do that to him?

[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.740]
If Greg is so crazy about forrel why did they put the beast in there with him?

[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:33.380]
Would make those sounds on the air Carlos

[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.620]
So they could have somebody sucking his ass. I don't think for all needs that anybody sucking his ass. He's a lot more you know

[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:45.880]
He's not he's not the big boy. Yeah, he's a big boy

[01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:51.780]
He's not emotional and he's not a basket case. He doesn't have to have everybody around him sucking his ass like that

[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:57.020]
In addition, which is if the beast is an ass sucker, how come I didn't work so good in the early morning hours before

[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:02.040]
Well stop stop and ask yourself that question. Here's Lauderdale. Hello

Most of our audience are squeezing themselves and squeezing each other even that kid that was bragging about the low price of gas that the devil's fan

[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:55.060]
Man, you call that hockey you pucks that's pathetic. That's tragic. And by the way, I hasten to point out

[01:13:55.060 --> 01:14:00.700]
This is a team that doesn't come close to selling out most of the regular season games and in the early rounds of the playoffs

[01:14:00.700 --> 01:14:01.960]
Don't even sell them out

[01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:09.700]
They're only right there in between New York and affiliate in the middle of about 20 million people and they just they can't pack the joint

[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.700]

[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:59.220]
You know when I dress up my clothes don't have a thing when I'm walking to

[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:05.520]
The club in store I was looking for moving like a horn maybe there's a dress cut down the path

[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:10.480]
So when people said I might as they could see my crotch I put on a shirt. It was see through

[01:19:10.480 --> 01:19:15.240]
You could see my boots and both my nipples too then I got a shirt had no cuties on

[01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.100]
We didn't matter but my mother's tea is done

[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:23.060]
You think I'm gonna dress up dude I won't you think I'm gonna wear a coat I won't

[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:30.640]
Even when I dress up my clothes don't have a thing do I care my lips show I don't

[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:37.580]
Will I try to have them no one won't even when I dress up my clothes don't have a thing

[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:41.140]
There's another one for your list JLo how could we've left her off there this long

[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:46.840]
Well, there's so many good choices. She does have a lovely ass all 600 pounds of it. Speaking of lovely ass

[01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.060]
We almost lost it with Pharrella the yesterday

[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.040]
During the time the station was off here. We were chatting Georgian. I both almost turned on him

[01:19:54.740 --> 01:19:56.740]
Because he made some kind of a Doreen

[01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:04.040]
Yeah, and I thought he said he had a great ass. Well, no, I thought about that. He was talking about a rack

[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:06.720]
I'm not just talking about her having a big ass

[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:11.160]
Is what he said right, but see I've got that whole thing figured out

[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:11.640]
You

[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:16.080]
Yeah, you couldn't see past her breasts. Is that what I want to the rest?

[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:18.060]
She's a liar

[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:24.200]
1146 at 560 w. I have another name for the list which I don't dare even say it

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.140]
Because I know that I'm gonna get all kinds of grief for saying it. It's just my own personal opinion

[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:32.780]
Just like that smuck who didn't like a Requiem for a dream

[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.020]
Jerry Seinfeld okay

[01:20:36.740 --> 01:20:40.360]
Jerry Seinfeld put him on there definitely overrated. He's a great actor

[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:46.080]

[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:50.540]
Think I killed him. Yeah

[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:53.140]
Put me right over the aid

[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:56.140]
That was the end of me

[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:02.340]
I mean, what is the attraction with him does he look good? No, is he funny? No, is he

[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:06.320]
An actor? No, what is the attraction with him? Jewish

[01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:10.380]
Oh, the New York Jew and in fact, that's one of the reasons I can't stand him

[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:14.320]
He's like he's that stereotype, you know for the same reason a lot of people can't stand Barbara Streisand

[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.840]
He is like a wall I've never said this before. He's like a walking of billboard for anti-Semitism. Jerry Seinfeld

[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:25.460]
Just that dripping New York, Jewie kind of you know, I'm talking about yeah. Oh

[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:32.860]
Now we're getting a battle here. Oh, look at this three-way battle. Who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:33.840]
I like this

[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.440]

They be having four

[01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:05.560]
Marilyn Monroe and Julia Roberts too. Why would they say that about poor Julia Roberts? I don't know she want an Oscar

[01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:09.900]
She's adequate. I think she's a fine actress. I think she's very good. But I mean, you know, let's

[01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:15.500]
I'll be cross be one D Martin one no votes yet for Bob Newhart Larry King sliced alone

[01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:20.480]
Queen Latifah or Barbara stress in and we put J. Lo and Jerry Seinfeld on yet, but we will

[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:27.760]
We will right away even though bonerboys pretty upset about the Seinfeld thing. Do you watch that show? I mean when it was on did you watch it?

[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.520]
Yeah, and you liked Seinfeld well, he was the worst one on the show. I mean

[01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:38.520]
You thought that was a good show. It was all right. The story lines were good. Yeah

[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:45.080]
I mean, especially relatively to yeah, he wasn't funny. He wasn't funny. Everybody else was right

[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:54.240]
I'm gonna pop a few pills now reds and oranges lose about 130

[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.260]
That facts we had just had to be a ball of us, you know, that guy would have been a little

[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:09.860]
Spec ice cream. I'm expecting it because then we got we got to follow up facts that I threw in the garbage saying a lot of the same thing

[01:23:09.860 --> 01:23:14.080]
But just the dripping with fake fakeness. Oh

[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:20.200]
Oh in other words like like we really like it. Yeah, it's gonna spoil my whole weekend if I find out there's somebody out there

Don't like some movie our life you weekend some life singer. We're gonna spoil at least the whole rest of May

[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:32.600]
567 05 60 the most important thing is we find George's dog this weekend. It's important thing is fine little Mickey

[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:38.360]

Dutch coffee shops famous for selling cannabis are about to see business go up in smoke is what it says in this story

Officials have just put the finishing touches to a measure banning smoking in cannabis selling cafes

[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:23.480]
Due to get government approval soon the law aims to protect employees of all companies from passive smoking

Although cannabis is formally illegal in Netherlands its use and sale are tolerated under strict government conditions

And you want to know why she's made all that money because there's a lot of stupid women in a country

[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:02.780]

[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:04.940]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound. I got bad story from Vegas

[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.580]
Fire destroys a historic Vegas casino and I never heard of it

[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:35.640]
I guess I never heard of it the historic casino

[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.120]

Sinatra, Cole and Davis were among the headliners who appeared in the club rooge showroom

[01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:21.780]
The casino closed after only six months, but in 1960 city and gambling leaders met there to officially desegregate the Vegas strip

[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:27.000]
This is a big loss for Nevada and for the African-American cultures said they'll Scott

[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:10.640]
See and at the time we thought we thought he was joking around come to fight on he was serious

[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.100]

[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:33.480]
Hey

[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:36.180]
Neil and George how are you?

[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:36.580]
Okay

[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.340]
No, this is Neil. I actually gave George's dog. Oh good god. Neil you're going to kill me

[01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.880]
Yeah, what what happened?

[01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.880]
I let him out last night and escaped out the fence. Where is he? That's the million dollar question or the five hundred dollar question. I want him back

[01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:58.660]
Which is my dog this is the guy the guy that gave me the dog when he was a puppy. Oh my god

[01:48:58.660 --> 01:49:00.100]
What happened Neil

[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.380]
He got me as George. I got out last time. I'm in Toronto. What's out the window about it?

[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.820]
He got out last night man. I got posters everywhere five hundred dollar reward. He's on our website

[01:49:12.540 --> 01:49:13.920]
Guess what I'm doing this weekend

[01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.900]
And Nikki never came back. No

[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:23.660]
Oh man has he gotten out before? No, I mean once. I mean you just walked around at the front yard sniffing around we intercepted him

[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:27.480]
Yeah, shoot. I don't want I don't want you to feel bad

[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:30.480]
But if I give you an analogy from the godfather when we're talking about Polly

[01:49:30.480 --> 01:49:32.620]
Oh Polly won't see him no more. Yeah

[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:41.400]
See what I'm saying? Oh, listen George. Yeah, I gotta get the dog back. No kidding. I can't go home until I do

[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:48.220]
Well, but wait, let me ask you something. Yeah, how long ago did he give George that dog? I can't even have 60 years ago

[01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:54.440]
So it was when he was like a puppy. Yeah, Neil. I don't know if you remember me. I used to work at the marketing magic building

[01:49:55.700 --> 01:49:57.820]
A real Guido would slip back here. No

[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.280]
No, I remember that asshole. I used to get all ben on a shape about his parking spot

[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.840]
Jack Mark Jack Mark

[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:09.280]
Jack Mark and no box. Yes, Jack Mark's the spot. Yeah

[01:50:10.480 --> 01:50:14.820]
But yeah, that's when well, they met George and I had this dog. He was a little psycho

[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:19.820]
And I worked all day so I don't want him home alone and I gave him to George

[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:22.940]
Well, I think I think you're the one that should feel bad about it more than George

[01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:27.600]
Because you're the one that turned the dog over to irresponsible hands of George and his family. Yeah

[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.600]
Now I trusted George. Like I said, and he's

[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:35.500]
He's digging baby the holes getting deep. You'll be halfway to China in a minute

[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:42.540]
He's been treating the dog good the best five and a half six years, but I just heard about this. I had a colon

[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:48.000]
Well, get out there and get out there and hungry. Get out there and look for myself. Please

[01:50:49.040 --> 01:50:51.580]
Hey, listen to me. I had a couple of doctors to your list

[01:50:52.320 --> 01:50:56.560]
Dr. Phil and Dr. Ruth. Okay, have a great day. Dr. Phil would be good.

[01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:04.440]
Dr. Ruth Dr. Phil belongs on list. Don't you think I want to change my go this guy gave you the dog, huh? Right that answers a lot of question

[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.160]
It was a puppy. Back we know from Jack Mark's

[01:51:07.760 --> 01:51:08.540]
territory over there

[01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:14.580]
From the tragic building over in Hollywood had his shots came with a cage. Yeah

[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:20.780]
And he entrusted this little dog to your hands and here it is only just a few years later and a dog is gone

[01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:27.560]
I don't know which one of you should feel worse. I think you should both feel visuously on this point

[01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:34.300]
I feel real bad because I never even saw this dog. Well, you can look at the website. Oh, is this picture on there? Yeah

[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:42.420]
Oh, I just think he's so cute. I can do this during the middle of the show. I get depressed. Yeah, you know what a dog lover. I know. Yeah. Oh

[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:45.500]
What a little sweetie. Oh, no

[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:56.000]
Are you kidding me? I wish I was. That's Nikki. What a cute little sweetheart is the fact that you changed the color. He looked a little like tiny

[01:51:56.000 --> 01:52:03.760]
Of course, tiny is dead. I know that he's got his haircut. He's got the shorter hair going. He's very similar looking to tiny

[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:11.860]
Yeah, but the pointy nose and everything just different color. Mm-hmm kind of like a bowgrip and a joker still. Yeah similar but different color

[01:52:12.980 --> 01:52:18.240]
So there's the picture on here and there's the number to call for to be with a $500 reward for a Nikki, please

[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:23.600]
We want that little dog back by the end of the day at the latest. I'll drive to you

[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.220]
Yeah, George will come and pick it up even if you're lucky

[01:52:26.220 --> 01:52:30.980]
Bring the girl if you're on it whether it's the city or the planet. He'll come and pick up the dog

[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:35.560]
He'll bring you cash. Don't take George's check believe me if you got the dog

[01:52:36.180 --> 01:52:39.060]
You want cash on the barrel head. Don't take no check from George

[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:46.400]
Five six seven you say that like a bounce to check no, I'm I didn't say you bounce to check

[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.560]
I'm just giving them good advice. I know how much you make how little you make

[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:51.880]
Oh, George does have a couple of appearances this weekend

[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:56.820]
So I take the check and hold it for a couple of days and speaking of taking checks and holding it for a couple of days

[01:52:56.820 --> 01:53:01.980]
I would like to announce to the world for the umpteenth time that watch over your money bank should only croak, okay?

[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:13.980]
Labyrinth's gotten the tree between her and me

[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:15.940]
That's my tail, old yeast

[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:19.440]
It smells fishy to me

[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:24.300]
That's enough of a tune that's moist and tasty

[01:56:24.300 --> 01:56:25.180]
Hey

[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:30.680]
She's in first place and pulling away

[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:35.220]
Rosie's got 41 votes, the most overrated celebrity of all time

[01:56:35.980 --> 01:56:39.100]
Covers a lot of territory but with an ass like that it's not hard I guess

[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:44.340]
Michael Jackson 31, Justin Tinkerbell 27, and Gloria Estefan we have in 20

[01:56:45.060 --> 01:56:47.400]
Here's a lady in West Palm, hello

[01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:47.760]
Hello

[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:48.820]
Yes ma'am

[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:51.720]
Well a lot of folks stolen my thunder wet with O'Brun

[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:55.660]
Dr. Phil, but certainly Martha Stewart should be ranked

[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:56.360]
She's on there

[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.880]
I didn't notice her I'm sorry

[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.500]
Well I mean it's possible that he didn't put her on there

[01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:04.780]
It wouldn't be her, it wouldn't be her first mistake, although let's blame Vena

[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:07.000]
Oh there she is, Ma'am no she's not, I don't see her

[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:07.880]
I didn't need it at first

[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:08.160]
14 votes

[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:10.000]
She's got 14 votes?

[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.980]
Oh Sam looking down at the bottom, 14 votes, that's why we're not finding her

[01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:15.260]
She's already worth being on there

[01:57:15.260 --> 01:57:16.940]
She's moving up the ladder fast

[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:19.400]
Well, enclosing

[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:20.920]
Eisner

[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:27.280]
That was great, a lady doing Eisner

[01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:32.100]
Even the women now are using our drop-ins

[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:32.840]
Eisner

[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.500]
In fact pretty soon the women of South Florida are going to be running around going

[01:57:39.100 --> 01:57:40.540]
Just like that

[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:44.880]
Here's a great story, man arrested after coming doing downtown LA

[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:53.940]
A man seized control of a construction crane towering above downtown LA for more than eight hours

[01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:59.980]
Rotating the cab and throwing objects at rescue teams before finally surrendering early today

[01:58:00.620 --> 01:58:05.960]
Kevin Donaldson 43 was arrested around 4am after he peacefully climbed down from the cab

[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:08.520]
Police said he likely faced vandalism charges

[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:13.920]
A caller reported seeing Donaldson in the crane of a construction site about a block from City Hall about 730 last night

[01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:19.220]
As police officers and firefighters arrived the man began hurling objects down to the ground at them

[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:23.300]
The crane is on the side of it was to be the new state Department of Transportation building

[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:27.940]
Police said Donaldson told them he used to be a crane operator in Montana before moving to LA

[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:33.720]
Before authorities cut power to the crane he dropped its hook and rotated its cab for a time

[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:36.140]
Negotiators eventually were able to talk to Donaldson down

[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:39.960]
He told police that he hadn't seen his children in seven years and wanted to kill himself

[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.420]
This is what he said

[01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.220]
I'm going to kick his ass and then I'll steal his two pay

[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:46.340]
No, where's that cut? Which one is that?

[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.120]
Right, yeah, fucker

[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.740]
The family had a lot of fucker

[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:51.620]
Huh, which cut is that? 14?

[01:58:52.220 --> 01:58:53.660]
I will just steal your white

[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:54.460]
Yes

[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:56.320]
Huh, you know what I'm talking about?

[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.040]
No, the kick is that

[01:58:57.040 --> 01:58:58.140]
Oh, I know the one it is

[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.980]
It's this one where the guy says

[01:59:00.980 --> 01:59:01.840]
Oh, we showed the dead

[01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.320]
That's the one

[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:04.260]
That was worth looking for

[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:07.440]
But you didn't put any index in here and I haven't had time to like read it up

[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.300]
Sorry, but it's a rush job

[01:59:08.300 --> 01:59:10.220]
That's okay, it was a rush job, no problem

[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.080]
The most important thing is we got this

[01:59:14.020 --> 01:59:14.460]
Oh

[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.960]
You know something that would be like criticizing spaghetti and equal

[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.980]
Even though it's an American thing, it's not the type

[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:24.400]
Right? Like criticizing the godfather

[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.160]
Right, right, exactly

[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:32.400]
Like critiquing the godfather and saying, oh, I wasted two and a half hours, three hours, whatever it is

[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:33.500]
Of my life

[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:34.720]
And that's the one you know

[01:59:35.300 --> 01:59:35.580]
Yes?

[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:37.820]
That's what they think a good movie is if that was not

[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:41.880]
That's like that's part of it calls me all the time you call it yesterday

[01:59:41.880 --> 01:59:43.540]
What do you consider a good call?

[01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:45.200]
Always says exactly the same thing

[01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:48.800]
I think a good movie is where there's a lot of great lines like

[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:51.280]
What a thing your blood it brings all over your nice type of leaks to

[01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:51.680]
Like that?

[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:52.120]
Yeah

[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:53.260]
Where there are memorable lines

[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:54.940]
And what is great acting?

[01:59:55.120 --> 01:59:55.760]
Requiem for a dream?

[01:59:55.800 --> 01:59:56.680]
Have memorable lines?

[01:59:57.720 --> 01:59:58.360]
It's murderous

[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:00.540]
I think your brain is going soft

[02:00:00.540 --> 02:00:02.540]
Yeah, they were doing lot of lines in Requiem for a dream

[02:00:02.540 --> 02:00:03.600]
Well, I guess you know

[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:05.140]
That's probably one of those people who's in denial

[02:00:05.140 --> 02:00:08.060]
Doesn't matter what myth or all the old people are all hopped up on drugs

[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:10.220]
And that the young people are all hopped up on drugs

[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.400]
And every the twain shall meet except except when it's time to like palm the TV

[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.040]
Five, six, seven

[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:20.640]
That was so great when he started trying to yank the TV out of the apartment

[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:23.300]
And as she had it she had it locked out with a chain

[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:24.620]
It was great

[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.640]
Nice going Sarah

[02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:29.560]
Sarah Goldfarb, I consider

[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:32.580]
But there's a little Sarah Goldfarb in me make no mistake about it

[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:33.880]
What the hell?

[02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:35.680]
She was hooked on pills, I'm hooked on sugar

[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:40.480]
I will say this, I went through an entire day yesterday, no sugar

[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:42.360]
One day, one day in a row

[02:00:43.780 --> 02:00:47.180]
Do you have any idea how long it's been since I've been able to do that?

[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:49.980]
No, I think since I've been back from Amsterdam Sunday

[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:51.380]
Two days, what is today?

[02:00:51.460 --> 02:00:54.180]
Friday, two days out of five, six, two out of six ain't bad

[02:00:54.180 --> 02:00:55.660]
Of course it was

[02:00:56.300 --> 02:00:56.920]
It's bad

[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.400]
When you're addicted

[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:03.540]
How many heroin addicts you know who goes two days out of six without a fix?

[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:05.520]
I don't know any heroin

[02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:08.420]
And I got news for it, oh yeah, where you know any heroin addicts

[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:09.120]
No, except for L

[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:13.540]
In fact, if you'd run up all your drugie friends they could probably find your little dog in about an hour

[02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:16.000]
Well, they're busy

[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:20.760]
Yeah, well when they, in fact, they're probably on every street corner of Hollywood right now

[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.660]
So if you would just contact them, Tom McKee, I'd get a look out

[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:25.180]
Get on your 100 bucks, we'll buy a lot of weed

[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:27.020]
Start dialing in beeper numbers, man

[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:31.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, here's another lady, I can't believe it in Miami, hello

[02:01:31.980 --> 02:01:32.760]
Hello

[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.640]
Yes, ma'am

[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:34.720]
Hi, Neil, hi George

[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:38.180]
Well, this is the third lady I've hung on for an hour

[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:40.120]
Oh right, we'll help you for a whole hour

[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:43.220]
Listen, I love the new lineup, I think it's great

[02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:46.380]
For real, he's a hot sketch, I love him

[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:50.880]
And George, I got all my good vibes out for your puppy

[02:01:50.880 --> 02:01:52.340]
I'm also an animal lover

[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:52.600]
Thank you

[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:53.680]
You will find your puppy

[02:01:53.680 --> 02:01:54.900]
You will find it

[02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:55.860]
Shake him a raka for me

[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:57.660]
Yes, I'll take two for you, darling

[02:01:57.660 --> 02:01:59.660]
Yeah, it's totally chicken and nail it on the door

[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:07.020]
Listen, darling, I wanted to say my Carson Daily, I actually, I feel sick to my stomach when I see him

[02:02:08.020 --> 02:02:14.020]
I can't believe that, I don't know why everybody loves him, but anyway, to reach his own, right?

[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:14.780]
Exactly

[02:02:14.780 --> 02:02:20.340]
And my vote here, besides Larry King, how about Jerry Lewis?

[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:24.460]
Yeah, Jerry Lewis, because although Jerry Lewis at once upon a time was funny

[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:27.100]
Oh, I never liked him, I'm sorry

[02:02:27.100 --> 02:02:30.940]
No, no, but I mean we hate him now because of the telephone stuff and because it's...

[02:02:30.940 --> 02:02:32.600]
I'm kind of curious, you know everyone says he's the genius

[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:33.420]
They do?

[02:02:33.900 --> 02:02:35.120]
Well, every time I hear you, I think it's the genius

[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:37.540]
Only the friends say that, the frogs like him

[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:40.240]
Well, that last speaks for that, right?

[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:40.820]
What does that say?

[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:45.940]
Well, listen, just be happy forever and I got my vibes out for you, George, and the puppy

[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:47.420]
Okay, sweetheart, thanks

[02:02:48.040 --> 02:02:52.560]
Say a raka, say a little prayer, I'm a sooty press now that I saw that dog

[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:57.960]
I mean, it's one thing to talk about it because it makes it kind of like impersonal

[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.540]
But then when you actually see it, cue this little dog

[02:03:01.160 --> 02:03:01.640]
Oh

[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:03.980]
Damn it

[02:03:04.780 --> 02:03:09.260]
Let's have a house-to-house, a county-wide church for George's little dog

[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:13.940]
Let's get this one little thing done on the show with the last damn thing that we do

[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:16.080]
I'm friends with that loser too

[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:17.000]
Yeah, I know

[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:19.140]
20...

[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:20.300]
20-feel one

[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:24.060]
Anybody missed for all on the radio's debut this morning, you missed this

[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:24.240]
Ah!

[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:26.960]
What if it's a backup?

[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.880]
Ah, I can't make it up the street, I'm too fat

[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:30.420]
Ah!

[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.680]
Yeah, do a reasonable taste of that

[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:35.560]
Maybe that was the imitation of Dorena, he was doing it

[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.000]
It says a liar

[02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:40.140]
20-feel one at 5.60, Q.A.M

[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:43.520]
I'm not a liar, I'm not a liar

[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:46.300]
It's just 20-feel five-six, Q.A.M

[02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:49.650]
At the moon, man

[02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:03.390]
Once there was this kid

[02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:07.170]
His thickest hand under his arm

[02:04:07.170 --> 02:04:10.870]
And make this custom sound, and then each day

[02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:14.370]
His tongue out

[02:04:14.370 --> 02:04:21.270]
And then he turned his eyelids inside out

[02:04:23.050 --> 02:04:29.850]
He drank a glass of milk from a straw stuck up his nose

[02:04:29.850 --> 02:04:29.890]
He was a little bit of a fool

[02:04:35.110 --> 02:04:42.970]
He was a little bit of a fool

[02:04:42.970 --> 02:04:46.590]
Once there was this kid

[02:04:46.590 --> 02:04:50.290]
Nice caution, cat or billers

[02:04:50.290 --> 02:04:53.810]
With a hammer on the ground and when he got

[02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:57.850]
Some fire works

[02:04:57.850 --> 02:05:04.850]
There'd be a cross low in a mountain from long

[02:05:04.850 --> 02:05:09.830]
With this living he would name it

[02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:15.750]
His hamster didn't have his beard

[02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:18.570]
Oh, he is

[02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:30.010]
She's very side-failed to get one vote

[02:05:30.010 --> 02:05:33.810]
It's just un-American, I think they're afraid that they're going to be tracing their computer

[02:05:33.810 --> 02:05:37.630]
And the secret service and the FBI will show up at the door if they vote for Jerry Sinpo

[02:05:37.630 --> 02:05:40.250]
But I don't have the balls to put another one on there because Zillin

[02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:43.550]
Samuel's, she inspired me with a little email

[02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:46.830]
I was going to mention it before because I mentioned Jay Leno

[02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:47.810]
Johnny Carson

[02:05:51.290 --> 02:05:53.130]
Johnny Carson, you're not supposed to say that

[02:05:53.130 --> 02:05:54.230]
No, sacrilegious

[02:05:54.230 --> 02:05:56.670]
I didn't find him funny, I didn't find him entertaining

[02:05:56.670 --> 02:05:59.010]
I didn't find him to be a great interview, I didn't find him to be anything

[02:05:59.010 --> 02:06:01.350]
And he was not for about 100 years

[02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:04.270]
You just don't, you dash and say that man

[02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:07.650]
But I figured it's the weekend so by Monday they'll forget I sent it

[02:06:07.650 --> 02:06:09.790]
Johnny Carson, get him on the list, Boehner boy

[02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:13.730]
Here's a lady in plantation, hello

[02:06:13.730 --> 02:06:15.210]
Hey Neil, yes man

[02:06:15.730 --> 02:06:17.810]
I may miss the boat because I haven't been listening our morning

[02:06:17.810 --> 02:06:20.610]
But did anybody mention Anna Nicole Smith?

[02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:22.050]
No, there's a good one

[02:06:22.730 --> 02:06:26.290]
Because there was a time when you couldn't turn on the television without seeing her

[02:06:26.850 --> 02:06:28.110]
They had pushed somewhere

[02:06:28.730 --> 02:06:30.310]
And then now they've given her a show

[02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:34.970]
I mean I don't know what her claim to fame is except marrying an old guy

[02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:37.770]
Exactly, and then I don't know what Kevin and Diana's seriously

[02:06:37.770 --> 02:06:38.310]
And I don't know what Kevin and Diana's seriously

[02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:39.930]
Before she was on Reaches

[02:06:40.890 --> 02:06:41.630]
Bible songs

[02:06:43.690 --> 02:06:45.810]
Let me just say one other thing while I was waiting

[02:06:45.810 --> 02:06:48.430]
And you were talking about you went one whole day without sugar

[02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:50.090]
You reminded me of the scene where

[02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:52.830]
Vera goes out and sits with her friends

[02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:54.390]
And they go, what diet are you on?

[02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:56.210]
And she says the egg and grapefruit diet

[02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:58.210]
And she goes, how long have you been on it?

[02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:59.550]
And she goes all day

[02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:01.510]
But it's only noon

[02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:03.910]
Yeah, it's only noon or only one o'clock yet

[02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:04.690]
I was great at seeing it

[02:07:04.690 --> 02:07:06.470]
I know that's a lot, when you're addicted you're right

[02:07:06.470 --> 02:07:07.750]
That's a long time

[02:07:07.750 --> 02:07:08.310]
You're right

[02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:10.110]
And you really feel it

[02:07:10.110 --> 02:07:11.130]
When you're addicted to sugar

[02:07:11.130 --> 02:07:15.710]
You get hit achy and you feel way off your feet before you're here too

[02:07:16.770 --> 02:07:17.650]
Oh gosh

[02:07:18.330 --> 02:07:19.390]
Well good luck to me

[02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:20.570]
Okay, and in the cold

[02:07:20.570 --> 02:07:21.390]
Thanks

[02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:23.490]
Get around there and in the cold Smith

[02:07:23.490 --> 02:07:24.310]
You got it

[02:07:24.310 --> 02:07:26.090]
She's a liar

[02:07:27.190 --> 02:07:28.370]
50 votes for Rosie

[02:07:28.370 --> 02:07:30.410]
Big fat Rosie seems to be pulling away

[02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:32.290]
She got off to like, you know, decent start

[02:07:32.290 --> 02:07:35.230]
But I guess when you're big and clumsy like that

[02:07:35.930 --> 02:07:37.630]
Before you really get rolling, you know

[02:07:37.630 --> 02:07:39.710]
Flat, flat, that always floats

[02:07:40.210 --> 02:07:40.890]
For the time

[02:07:40.890 --> 02:07:41.490]
Flat floats

[02:07:42.190 --> 02:07:44.050]
So did you tell Fat Boy the history?

[02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:44.670]
Yeah

[02:07:45.230 --> 02:07:45.950]
And he said

[02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:48.730]
Oh

[02:07:48.730 --> 02:07:49.970]
Oh, yeah

[02:07:49.970 --> 02:07:50.570]
What did he say?

[02:07:50.950 --> 02:07:52.210]
He said

[02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:54.010]
What can we do to fix it, Polly?

[02:07:54.410 --> 02:07:56.270]
And I said nothing, go away, do nothing

[02:07:56.270 --> 02:07:57.970]
Leave me alone, Fat Boy

[02:07:57.970 --> 02:08:00.110]
Leave me alone, quit killing me with kindness

[02:08:00.110 --> 02:08:01.550]
Stop interfering with my life

[02:08:01.550 --> 02:08:03.310]
I'm 1200 miles away

[02:08:03.310 --> 02:08:05.430]
I'm enjoying life tremendously, okay?

[02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:08.750]
Everything is beautiful, even the stars germs are beautiful

[02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:11.010]
Everything is great, just leave me alone

[02:08:11.010 --> 02:08:14.010]
I'd rather have a mad cow for lunch than ever

[02:08:14.010 --> 02:08:15.430]
Deal with that cow again

[02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:16.550]
Go away, Fat Boy

[02:08:17.350 --> 02:08:19.510]

Martha Stewart 16

[02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:38.110]
She's a homemaker like Amahoe maker Martha Stewart

[02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:41.750]
In fact, even Grayson passions can make a great tomato soup cake

[02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:43.550]
I bet your Martha Stewart can't do that

[02:08:44.210 --> 02:08:44.810]
More

[02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:47.190]
Tomato cake

[02:08:47.190 --> 02:08:47.670]
Tomato

[02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:50.110]
That's part of the insanity of the show

[02:08:50.110 --> 02:08:52.730]
You have to be a passions person to appreciate that

[02:08:52.730 --> 02:08:53.750]
I feel like a seller or so

[02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:56.030]

[02:09:51.410 --> 02:09:52.610]
Where is Dr. Phil?

[02:09:52.610 --> 02:09:53.410]
Oh, Donnie Boy

[02:09:57.490 --> 02:09:58.330]

You know, this probably screwed up her

[02:10:07.210 --> 02:10:08.590]
It's metabolism moving back to 10 to 2

[02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:10.850]

[02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.930]
Okay

[02:10:54.930 --> 02:10:55.950]
Where's it going to be?

[02:10:56.350 --> 02:10:57.630]
It's going to be all over

[02:10:58.890 --> 02:11:00.710]
It's going to it's like a port

It's going to go around the country

[02:11:02.050 --> 02:11:04.730]
But I mean, it is going to be in South Florida

[02:11:04.730 --> 02:11:05.410]
Oh yeah

[02:11:05.890 --> 02:11:06.350]

Okay, thanks pali

[02:11:12.670 --> 02:11:13.410]

Let me tell you that right now

[02:11:19.050 --> 02:11:20.090]
If you value your freedoms

[02:11:21.470 --> 02:11:22.930]
If you value anything

[02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:25.890]
Of course the market keeps soaring up there

[02:11:25.890 --> 02:11:26.850]
Can you explain that to me?

[02:11:27.070 --> 02:11:27.150]
No

[02:11:27.150 --> 02:11:28.170]
I think it's a setup

[02:11:30.250 --> 02:11:31.530]
Do you see that today?

[02:11:31.630 --> 02:11:33.530]
Well they're happy about those dividend tax breaks

[02:11:34.070 --> 02:11:35.070]
Is that what it is?

[02:11:35.130 --> 02:11:35.830]
I guess I don't know

[02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:37.890]
I thought maybe they were happy about the fact that the dollars

[02:11:37.890 --> 02:11:39.670]
were about three cent everywhere else now

[02:11:39.670 --> 02:11:40.630]
God the dollar

[02:11:40.630 --> 02:11:41.270]
Look at that

[02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:43.270]

Do not give it to Mitch Hirsch

[02:12:01.250 --> 02:12:02.310]
Here's a call from Jupiter

[02:12:11.230 --> 02:12:12.670]
He was evil twin

[02:12:14.950 --> 02:12:15.430]
56670560

[02:12:15.430 --> 02:12:18.870]
We haven't had one negative to recall on Pharrell so far

[02:12:19.710 --> 02:12:20.690]
How do you like that?

[02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:21.430]
That's surprising?

[02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:23.630]
Yeah, actually for this crowd

[02:12:24.230 --> 02:12:28.130]
For this crowd and especially considering he's so out of the ordinary

[02:12:28.130 --> 02:12:29.190]
To say the very least

[02:12:29.190 --> 02:12:31.290]
I mean he's just one in a trillion

[02:12:32.490 --> 02:12:34.430]
He is different, he is a trip

[02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:36.170]
He's a piece of work, he's bizarre

[02:12:36.170 --> 02:12:37.610]
He's strange, he's spastic

[02:12:38.230 --> 02:12:40.450]
Spastic I think is the word the best describes Pharrell

[02:12:40.450 --> 02:12:41.350]
Spastic

[02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:44.370]
I can listen to my little brother on Metallica you jerk

[02:12:44.370 --> 02:12:45.850]
Now let me ask you what is that?

[02:12:46.110 --> 02:12:47.590]
That was a call that he got

[02:12:47.590 --> 02:12:49.350]
So it's part of the Pharrell drama

[02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:50.010]
Oh I see

[02:12:52.290 --> 02:12:52.770]
56670560

[02:12:52.770 --> 02:12:55.070]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line

[02:12:55.070 --> 02:12:56.450]
Here's Del Rey-B, chill out

[02:12:57.310 --> 02:12:57.630]
Neil?

[02:12:58.090 --> 02:12:58.590]
Yes sir

[02:12:58.590 --> 02:13:00.730]
Hey, I was calling about the movie

[02:13:02.130 --> 02:13:05.150]
I wasn't crazy about it, my wife didn't like it either

[02:13:05.150 --> 02:13:07.870]
But I think what the craze is about it

[02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:10.750]
Is the cinematography of it, that's really great

[02:13:12.210 --> 02:13:14.410]
We talked about Requiem for a dream

[02:13:14.410 --> 02:13:16.270]
Yes, sorry about it

[02:13:16.270 --> 02:13:17.490]
What did you like about it?

[02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:22.870]
It was just ponderous, you know, it was just going on and on and on

[02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:25.330]
But you know the cinematography was great on it

[02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:28.830]
I mean the way they just went into the scene it was really good

[02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:32.090]
I wouldn't say it was a great movie, I wouldn't put it up there with the Godfather

[02:13:32.090 --> 02:13:34.270]
One of the 10 best movies of all time

[02:13:35.230 --> 02:13:38.770]
I'd like to have a poll on that people who saw it and see what they thought about it

[02:13:38.770 --> 02:13:43.430]
What kind of a poll were that because I guarantee 95% of the people in the audience never saw it

[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:45.890]
We could do a mini-poll on that

[02:13:46.810 --> 02:13:51.170]
Yeah, I'm just curious to see if it's just me or if it's just, you know, is it a really great movie?

[02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:55.590]
Because I didn't think it was great, I thought it was good, but I didn't think it was great

[02:13:55.590 --> 02:13:59.410]
I thought it was sensational, in fact I watched it twice in two days

[02:13:59.410 --> 02:14:01.050]
I was so blown away by it

[02:14:01.050 --> 02:14:05.930]
I couldn't wait to get it because you talked about it, but you know what, the next one on my list is happiness

[02:14:05.930 --> 02:14:07.430]
I can't write it down

[02:14:07.970 --> 02:14:09.410]
Why not? Is it in round?

[02:14:09.930 --> 02:14:16.490]
I checked blockbuster from Boynton to Boca, every blockbuster on the internet, and they don't have it

[02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:17.270]
I'll lend you my copy

[02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:21.230]
Yeah, if you come down to Hollywood and find George's dog, he'll let you have his copy

[02:14:21.230 --> 02:14:24.810]
Well, I think I'm just going to order that one, I'm on that DVD club thing

[02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:27.170]
Call this water and go for it, do what it's all about

[02:14:27.170 --> 02:14:29.890]
I hope you like that one, I don't want to be over two

[02:14:29.890 --> 02:14:31.190]
That's a big lot, Neil

[02:14:31.190 --> 02:14:32.230]
Okay pal

[02:14:32.230 --> 02:14:32.710]
I would

[02:14:32.710 --> 02:14:35.090]
Didn't like Cap, I didn't like Requiem for a dream

[02:14:35.090 --> 02:14:35.790]
I don't get it

[02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:36.590]
Was it Pondras?

[02:14:37.410 --> 02:14:38.130]
Wasn't Slow?

[02:14:38.570 --> 02:14:42.010]
No, it quite, quite the contrary, that's the whole thing

[02:14:42.010 --> 02:14:43.230]
It started out fast

[02:14:43.230 --> 02:14:46.350]
It started out fast and just kept getting faster and faster

[02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:49.350]
Your head was spinning by the time you got about two-thirds of the way through it

[02:14:50.290 --> 02:14:54.370]
And then the last time that Harry stuck that needle in his arm, I mean at that point you were just

[02:14:54.370 --> 02:14:56.830]
Yeah, right, yeah, ready to have like an aneurysm

[02:14:57.530 --> 02:15:00.010]
Your brain was about ready to explode

[02:15:00.910 --> 02:15:04.810]
Well, maybe we'll hear some, we just don't get a lot of response from these bastards, you know

[02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:09.090]
We go on a year, we talk about movies for, I mean we had a lot of response about that on the movie pools

[02:15:09.090 --> 02:15:10.870]
But in terms of specific movies

[02:15:12.610 --> 02:15:16.570]
There's got to be a lot of people that love that movie, I just, for the life of me, I don't get it

[02:15:16.570 --> 02:15:17.450]
Everyone I know

[02:15:18.590 --> 02:15:21.510]
Even Bonerboy liked it, you know his taste is in his toes usually

[02:15:25.490 --> 02:15:26.970]
Although he liked bully too

[02:15:26.970 --> 02:15:28.050]
And Seinfeld

[02:15:28.590 --> 02:15:29.390]
And kids

[02:15:29.390 --> 02:15:31.370]
How Seinfeld doing on a pool?

[02:15:31.410 --> 02:15:33.710]
Let's get a bunch of votes for Seinfeld on there, shall we?

[02:15:34.190 --> 02:15:34.810]
He sucks

[02:15:35.930 --> 02:15:38.330]
Dr. Fildon had any, and now what's with that?

[02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:40.610]
378 votes and Dr. Fildon hasn't had any yet?

[02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:42.870]
Come on, come on people

[02:15:43.850 --> 02:15:46.150]
Johnny Carson got one already, I told you

[02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:51.370]
It's one of those, I just don't get it, I don't understand it

[02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:56.310]
It's like her boss, Granderson, on WABC New York, he was there for about 600 years

[02:15:56.310 --> 02:16:00.590]
And he was there, you wanna know why? Cause he was there

[02:16:01.690 --> 02:16:05.450]
He got in early, he got in, he was like one of the pioneers, and he just stayed there forever

[02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:09.430]
Carled assues on WBZ and Boston, if we're talking about radio, same thing

[02:16:10.630 --> 02:16:12.970]
I mean he was about as dry as sandpaper

[02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:18.490]
But they were just there for a long, long time

[02:16:19.250 --> 02:16:20.430]
And the same with Carson

[02:16:21.010 --> 02:16:24.030]
What about Ed McMahon? He's small but thin as well

[02:16:24.030 --> 02:16:26.330]
I think he's rated exactly right, nobody takes him seriously

[02:16:26.770 --> 02:16:30.150]
Yeah, nobody considers him a real whatever except the shill

[02:16:30.150 --> 02:16:33.190]
Let's have a drinking contest between Ed McMahon and Ferrell

[02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:35.290]
It's coming up Monday morning, 8 to 10

[02:16:36.670 --> 02:16:38.990]
I got some old PDs I wanna throw into that contest

[02:16:39.490 --> 02:16:39.930]
Yeah

[02:16:40.490 --> 02:16:41.170]
Any names?

[02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:42.990]
Steve Nichol Harry Valentine

[02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:44.710]
Here's Leightana, hello

[02:16:45.490 --> 02:16:46.110]
Steve, what's happening?

[02:16:46.110 --> 02:16:46.930]
Yes sir

[02:16:46.930 --> 02:16:50.550]
But I've asked Carl, there's knocking that movie

[02:16:51.050 --> 02:16:54.430]
You sound like a pseudo intellectual asshole to me

[02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:55.130]
Did he really?

[02:16:55.630 --> 02:16:55.630]

[02:16:55.630 --> 02:16:57.230]
The movie was great

[02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:58.230]
You saw it?

[02:16:58.390 --> 02:16:59.830]
Yes, I saw it in Mother's Day

[02:17:01.450 --> 02:17:04.310]
That's a good day to see it, just be glad that Sara wasn't your mother

[02:17:04.310 --> 02:17:07.390]
Yeah, yeah it was great man

[02:17:07.390 --> 02:17:11.390]
Listen, question now, call it foul for your poll

[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:13.770]
Call and foul, okay?

[02:17:13.770 --> 02:17:15.630]
He's foul, whatever name it is, yeah he sucks

[02:17:15.630 --> 02:17:16.710]
He's foul

[02:17:16.710 --> 02:17:18.150]
Yeah, I guess he is

[02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:19.850]
I think he's highly overrated

[02:17:20.770 --> 02:17:22.250]
On your best office year now

[02:17:22.770 --> 02:17:22.810]
Yeah

[02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:28.070]
Are you gonna have the George Bush, Mr. Dumb President Dumb, you know

[02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:28.810]
Dumb Schmidt?

[02:17:29.270 --> 02:17:29.990]
Yeah, that's right

[02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.730]
Absolutely

[02:17:30.730 --> 02:17:34.170]
And you gotta have, I'm not that I'm telling you what to do

[02:17:34.770 --> 02:17:36.910]
But he was destruction

[02:17:37.570 --> 02:17:40.570]
Oh, no question about it, Ferrell will be

[02:17:40.570 --> 02:17:42.630]
I get 10 CDs and sit about there

[02:17:42.630 --> 02:17:44.890]
Those two will be back to back side by each

[02:17:44.890 --> 02:17:45.850]
Everybody was in Pally

[02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:46.730]
You're too bad

[02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:47.730]
Thanks, I got your pardon?

[02:17:47.970 --> 02:17:48.610]
He should hear this

[02:17:49.330 --> 02:17:52.970]
President Dumb poop was on the best of 2001

[02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:57.510]
Oh, not that we can't put it on there again, but no

[02:17:57.510 --> 02:17:59.850]
Let's put it, let's put it on there again, for all time's sake

[02:17:59.850 --> 02:18:05.970]
My and local, your sports radio 560, viewing to Ju-A-M

[02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:09.710]
So long to two hours

[02:18:17.130 --> 02:18:21.530]
Don't lie, all the harbor

[02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:27.110]
Don't don't don't don't every time I see

[02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:33.030]
Don't don't don't let free tart into my soul

[02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:37.910]
Don't don't don't don't fall into my TV

[02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:41.510]
Oh, he's President Dumb, you know

[02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:46.630]
Repubblicate muscle visit and in archingularity

[02:18:46.630 --> 02:18:50.850]
I don't know why they were in watches

[02:18:50.850 --> 02:18:56.130]
Y'all have a nice year, just grew to neck for years

[02:18:56.130 --> 02:18:58.750]
With President Dumb, you know

[02:19:02.530 --> 02:19:07.790]
Oh, what I did to the both of us all

[02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:15.090]
And get to we all voted for one

[02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:23.750]
If you want this, don't talk about lips drumming stupidly

[02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:29.110]
Don't don't don't mind this drunk and rich kid

[02:19:30.250 --> 02:19:34.370]
Don't don't don't ease even, lumber than me

[02:19:34.370 --> 02:19:38.690]
He's President Dumb, you know

[02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:40.310]
Don't care what it's all

[02:19:40.310 --> 02:19:44.690]
You got him here by the upper end of the Christian road

[02:19:44.690 --> 02:19:48.930]
I know what's best of you and I, but how come fear

[02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:51.670]
We've got a great leader here

[02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.690]
With President Dumb

[02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:55.290]
Oh, we're fine

[02:19:59.230 --> 02:20:01.470]
One more three and five sixty WMHR

[02:20:01.470 --> 02:20:03.430]
We wanted two hours, don't forget to mad dog

[02:20:03.430 --> 02:20:05.950]
Two to four, hang four to seven and we got that Marlon crap

[02:20:05.950 --> 02:20:10.090]
And of course we got U.M.A. Regions on a Waxi 790

[02:20:10.090 --> 02:20:11.050]
It's 6. What is it?

[02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:11.690]
It's 6.59

[02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:14.230]
There's just too much stuff on here, I can't deal with it

[02:20:14.230 --> 02:20:16.770]
George, after the show today, three to five

[02:20:16.770 --> 02:20:19.170]
The staff noted for Lauderdale Harley on federal highway

[02:20:19.170 --> 02:20:21.550]
Just south of Oakland Park Boulevard, stop by to win Marlon tickets

[02:20:22.170 --> 02:20:25.310]
Red, uh, Marlon's red tickets and enjoy free food from Atlantic City Sub

[02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:27.270]
I'm assuming that's for the night's game

[02:20:28.130 --> 02:20:28.490]
Diet

[02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:29.370]
Exactly

[02:20:29.370 --> 02:20:32.970]
And when you're there, you can commiserate with George about his little lost dog too

[02:20:32.970 --> 02:20:34.330]
Or better yet you can bring him there

[02:20:34.890 --> 02:20:37.570]
You can bring his little dog there or maybe one it looks just like him

[02:20:38.170 --> 02:20:40.450]
And then tomorrow, I'm in one Georgian boner boy

[02:20:40.450 --> 02:20:42.750]
A Viener Boyle will be out at Bill Sydles Boulevard of Savings

[02:20:42.750 --> 02:20:44.550]
Where they still have no idea who George is

[02:20:44.550 --> 02:20:46.510]
He's been in a whole bunch of times, at least 30

[02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:48.070]
Me de me de me de los salvatés

[02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:51.810]
Located on the northwest 36th street just west of 27th Avenue Miami

[02:20:51.810 --> 02:20:54.330]
Stop by for prizes, food from Atlantic City Sub

[02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:57.670]
In Hollywood where you know the rest

[02:20:58.290 --> 02:21:01.490]
I'm just getting ready to do a big belt and just kind of like cut stuck in midstream

[02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:03.950]
And don't forget the hot couples contest three

[02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:05.910]
The pictures are pouring in for that knot

[02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:07.190]
We have any today?

[02:21:07.830 --> 02:21:09.150]
Well, besides that one

[02:21:09.630 --> 02:21:11.050]
No, we have no more than that

[02:21:11.050 --> 02:21:11.310]
No

[02:21:12.670 --> 02:21:13.890]
Maybe this thing is over

[02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:15.350]
Maybe we pushed it too far

[02:21:15.350 --> 02:21:17.290]
You know, maybe we just don't have any hot couples out there

[02:21:18.650 --> 02:21:19.930]
We got pretty good prizes

[02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:26.610]
Your first prize for the hottest couple of whoever joins this time is either one of these

[02:21:26.610 --> 02:21:30.070]
3-D 2-Nights Day for 2-Wheel O'Races Resort in Casino and in Bahamas

[02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:32.370]
Including Roundtrip Airfare on Lake Error

[02:21:32.370 --> 02:21:36.510]
Or 3-D 2-Nights Day for 2 at Heedonism 2 or 3 in Jamaica

[02:21:36.510 --> 02:21:40.650]
All inclusive transfers drink food, gratuitous entertainment, no airfare on that one

[02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:43.850]
And then third place couple gets dinner for 2 with the pizza love

[02:21:43.850 --> 02:21:47.390]

[02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:07.690]
Pretty simple, you can be in a full-stated dress, a full-stated undressed, you can be, you know, whatever, whatever you might be

[02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:13.670]
5-6705-60 and then of course the fourth place when it gets one of our graces to make a soup cakes

[02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:16.790]
Here's plantation, hello

[02:22:17.470 --> 02:22:18.150]
Yes sir

[02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:25.090]
Yes, how you doing man? I think I'm two most overrated people, one bono from you two and plus ditty

[02:22:25.690 --> 02:22:27.190]
Two marvelous choices

[02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:32.230]
Yeah, they're the most overrated people on the planet, even all like you two but a guy man, he needs to stay out of politics

[02:22:33.110 --> 02:22:35.290]
Okay, he needs to stay out of my face, he makes me sick

[02:22:36.110 --> 02:22:36.850]
Okay, pal, thanks

[02:22:38.190 --> 02:22:40.630]
Bono and Puff ditty, get him on there, okay, P-ditty

[02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:44.290]
He kind of went down in our book after he shot Regis

[02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:48.330]
5-670, got a lot of open lines now, all of a sudden in one to two hours

[02:22:48.330 --> 02:22:51.570]
And these people realize that we're on one to two, probably not a long time

[02:22:51.570 --> 02:22:56.470]
That's going to take us a while, the guy, see, we jerked the audience around, we moved the show to nine to one for reasons

[02:22:56.470 --> 02:23:00.670]
I mean, don't say anybody with a brain, a show that's been on 10 to two for about 50 million years

[02:23:00.670 --> 02:23:04.450]
Everybody's in the habit, everybody's happy, we're kicking ass, we're doing just great

[02:23:04.450 --> 02:23:06.690]
And now we got to make a U-turn again

[02:23:07.170 --> 02:23:10.930]
Because Reg is spastic, maybe that's why he's got such an affinity for a feral

[02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:13.910]
Because spastic is his middle name

[02:23:14.450 --> 02:23:19.410]
All of feral is funny and Greg is less funny, let's put it that way, less funny

[02:23:21.570 --> 02:23:25.410]
5-670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Lone

[02:23:25.410 --> 02:23:27.770]
And when you call you'll have the honor of speaking to Bonerboy

[02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:33.790]
I think that Bonerboy would like to produce the feral show

[02:23:35.230 --> 02:23:36.410]
Good thing he's got to call right now

[02:23:37.030 --> 02:23:37.610]
Oh good

[02:23:38.190 --> 02:23:38.870]
You don't think?

[02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:39.730]
It wasn't important

[02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:41.310]
What do you mean by that?

[02:23:42.410 --> 02:23:43.750]
I don't know, he's probably still talking

[02:23:45.150 --> 02:23:46.050]
Oh, one of those?

[02:23:46.330 --> 02:23:46.570]
Yep

[02:23:47.750 --> 02:23:49.010]
Here's Carl Springs, hello

[02:23:50.170 --> 02:23:50.970]
Neil, yes

[02:23:50.970 --> 02:23:52.430]
Hey, it's going on

[02:23:53.010 --> 02:23:53.710]
How you doing, pal?

[02:23:53.730 --> 02:23:54.910]
Okay, real quickly

[02:23:54.910 --> 02:23:57.210]
I saw Requiem

[02:23:57.650 --> 02:24:02.290]
And I don't know what the hell that factur and that phone call guy has gotten their idiot

[02:24:03.190 --> 02:24:04.150]
It's excellent, Felix

[02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:05.910]
It's depressing to me when I hear stuff

[02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:09.430]
Oh, it is, it's terrible, especially in the movie, seeing Sarah

[02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:12.750]
Let me, did you get to see Momenta?

[02:24:12.970 --> 02:24:13.870]
Momenta, me I...

[02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:16.470]
You know, Momenta, I haven't watched that yet, either, I got a gun

[02:24:16.470 --> 02:24:18.710]
Oh, you got to see that, you're going to love it

[02:24:18.710 --> 02:24:19.150]
Really?

[02:24:19.730 --> 02:24:22.670]
Excellent movie, very good, you'll see it a few times actually

[02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:23.650]
Are you serious?

[02:24:24.130 --> 02:24:24.630]
No, yeah

[02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:25.630]
Are you sure?

[02:24:26.290 --> 02:24:26.850]
I'm positive

[02:24:27.970 --> 02:24:28.490]
I think

[02:24:28.490 --> 02:24:31.090]
It was Georgia told me I'll never get past the first 15 minutes

[02:24:31.090 --> 02:24:32.730]
No, it wasn't me, it was some color or some facts

[02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:35.390]
Oh, somebody told me I'll never get past the first 15 minutes of Momenta

[02:24:35.390 --> 02:24:37.210]
Well, screw him too

[02:24:37.210 --> 02:24:37.850]
Okay

[02:24:39.390 --> 02:24:40.510]
Uh, that's it, I'm out

[02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:41.590]
Okay, thanks, pal.

[02:24:42.270 --> 02:24:45.230]
I've got a lot of viewing to do this weekend, I've got to watch Momento

[02:24:45.230 --> 02:24:46.370]
I've got to watch

[02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:47.110]
I'm begging you

[02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:48.490]
Men Gary Glen Hill

[02:24:48.490 --> 02:24:50.230]
The next one, the next one you watch, Glenn Gary Glen Ross

[02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:53.290]
I've got to watch your Requiem for a pill again

[02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:55.490]
And what's the fourth one?

[02:24:56.370 --> 02:24:57.130]
Me mental

[02:24:57.130 --> 02:24:57.930]
Me mental

[02:24:57.930 --> 02:24:59.250]
And kids

[02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:02.010]
Oh, here comes the fifth part

[02:25:02.010 --> 02:25:04.350]
Oh, this is the part that drives me up the wall

[02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:06.370]
Oh, there's that

[02:25:06.370 --> 02:25:08.170]
Oh, there's that

[02:25:08.170 --> 02:25:10.090]
Oh, we got another winner

[02:25:10.090 --> 02:25:10.650]
Oh

[02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:14.650]
Choose by Sarah, choose by Sarah

[02:25:27.830 --> 02:25:29.770]
Come on, time out again

[02:25:30.270 --> 02:25:31.570]
I'm going to be here

[02:25:36.570 --> 02:25:40.250]
Oh, yeah, and kids more frantic and more frantic and get more wound up

[02:25:40.250 --> 02:25:41.390]
And more just out of control

[02:25:41.390 --> 02:25:44.550]
And then of course, these scene in the end

[02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:47.410]
Yeah, where the two friends from her building, the two old Houses go to

[02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:49.330]
This visitor in the mental institution

[02:25:49.330 --> 02:25:51.090]
And she's got like the short white hair

[02:25:51.090 --> 02:25:54.370]
And like totally spaced out, has no clue what planet she's on

[02:25:54.370 --> 02:25:58.890]
And then the two old lady friends are sitting on the bus bench crying their eyes out

[02:26:00.370 --> 02:26:01.150]
Pretty sad

[02:26:01.870 --> 02:26:03.750]
Yeah, we're message throwing you people out there

[02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:06.710]
Don't be popping too many multi-colored pills all at the same time

[02:26:06.710 --> 02:26:08.590]
No matter how many George tries to sell you

[02:26:08.590 --> 02:26:10.190]
I don't sell pills

[02:26:10.190 --> 02:26:15.110]
And you take it, everything I say you get so defensive, okay? I buy them

[02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:21.370]
Jesus, God, if I said that if I said that you were bone and boner boy, I mean you get all the defensive and boner boy

[02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:25.590]
Including you repeat that like a louder

[02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:32.170]
Who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time?

[02:26:32.410 --> 02:26:33.790]
That's our poll question today

[02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:36.870]
Don't be picking on George on the day that his dog ran away, okay?

[02:26:37.610 --> 02:26:44.650]
Jesus Christ, it's a traumatic thing, I can only imagine if tiny would have, or Winnie, either one of them would have won it

[02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:46.130]
Well, Winnie, I would have cared tiny n

[02:26:46.510 --> 02:26:47.450]
Ha ha ha

[02:26:47.450 --> 02:26:47.810]
Ha

[02:26:47.810 --> 02:26:48.350]
Ha

[02:26:50.110 --> 02:26:52.770]
You have no idea how many times, especially the little one

[02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:56.610]
And of course you're right, the little ones they're sneaky, they crawl under the fence, they find a way, you know

[02:26:57.590 --> 02:27:00.250]
And they get loose and they just want to traumatize you

[02:27:00.250 --> 02:27:02.670]
If my possible, he might be within a couple of blocks away

[02:27:02.670 --> 02:27:04.070]
Right next door or something

[02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.530]
You think?

[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:05.350]
Laughing at us, no

[02:27:06.790 --> 02:27:07.470]
You don't?

[02:27:07.770 --> 02:27:07.970]
No

[02:27:07.970 --> 02:27:08.990]
Well, why not?

[02:27:09.130 --> 02:27:10.270]
I don't know, I don't know what to think

[02:27:10.270 --> 02:27:12.470]
Be a little more optimistic, I bet he's within

[02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:15.270]
In fact, he's probably over there at IOD

[02:27:16.110 --> 02:27:16.770]
Alright, yeah

[02:27:16.770 --> 02:27:18.790]
He's probably sitting on Mike Disney's lap right now

[02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:19.250]
Oh God

[02:27:19.810 --> 02:27:20.590]
What a thought

[02:27:21.810 --> 02:27:25.390]
Who is or was the most overrated artist of all time?

[02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:27.170]
Did we get Bono and Puff Diddy on there?

[02:27:28.110 --> 02:27:28.510]
Yes

[02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:34.050]
Did we pass those along to Eric who's just shoveling down Smoor's bars?

[02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:37.790]
Do you know that's I don't want to talk about score?

[02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:40.970]
I might do something terrible this weekend because I'm going to be watching all the movies

[02:27:41.790 --> 02:27:42.790]
Yeah, don't do it

[02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:46.690]
Those clon-like bars would score a candy in them, don't eat score anymore

[02:27:47.510 --> 02:27:48.530]
Ha ha ha ha

[02:27:48.530 --> 02:27:52.330]
I love, I love, I don't know how I did that because you know in the past

[02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:55.950]
When I wanted to sugar fix I'd go into like the amaco station, you know

[02:27:55.950 --> 02:27:56.370]
Right

[02:27:56.370 --> 02:28:00.290]
And I'd gas up and I'd go inside and I'd get like one heath bar and one score bar

[02:28:00.290 --> 02:28:01.810]
Because they're very similar, they're almost the same

[02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:02.110]
Right

[02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.990]
But a little bit different

[02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:05.010]
English toffee

[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:05.810]
Yeah

[02:28:06.370 --> 02:28:09.350]
And that would satisfy me and it was never like I was hooked on them

[02:28:09.350 --> 02:28:10.970]
But it was just something that would tide me over

[02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:14.670]
I know they're good value because you get to pick those out of your teeth all day long

[02:28:14.670 --> 02:28:15.330]
Oh yeah

[02:28:15.330 --> 02:28:17.070]
And of course all depending on where you stick them

[02:28:17.070 --> 02:28:17.530]
Back them

[02:28:18.530 --> 02:28:22.870]
But then for some strange reason I know what it was it was when I find the score bites

[02:28:23.610 --> 02:28:27.170]
And of course now that they did the Reese's Pieces thing that was the beginning of that

[02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:32.490]
And now it's a nightmare now they got like Hershey's bites and score bites and bite this and bite that, you know

[02:28:33.570 --> 02:28:40.150]
And then I discovered that Briar's made that score ice cream and now all of a sudden I find a clon-dike makes it a score clon-dike bar

[02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:45.190]
So it's like some goddamn sugar conspiracy out there it's like they're trying to get me, you know

[02:28:45.190 --> 02:28:46.110]
Jesus Christ

[02:28:46.110 --> 02:28:46.750]
Yeah

[02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:54.890]
Rosie's got 61 votes Michael Jackson 35 just in Tinkerbell 29

[02:28:54.890 --> 02:28:57.130]
Hey Justin everybody hates you

[02:28:57.130 --> 02:28:58.070]
Bye bye bye

[02:28:58.070 --> 02:29:00.770]
Including Brittany she finally saw what you look like

[02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:07.430]
Gloria Estefan 25 Carson daily 25 in fact Brittany came out in public in the inquire

[02:29:07.430 --> 02:29:10.090]
She said that Justin only had a stump penis

[02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:11.610]
Stumped it

[02:29:11.610 --> 02:29:15.750]
Carson daily 25 he's doing well and I'm pleased to see that because he blows

[02:29:16.430 --> 02:29:18.910]
Frank Sinatra 21 Elvis 21

[02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:22.550]
I like those Frankie and Elvis duets

[02:29:24.390 --> 02:29:30.890]
She the thing just topped all over the place Madonna 20 Mariah Carey who is really scary is tied with Martha Stewart and Bob Hope 17

[02:29:31.530 --> 02:29:33.590]
Maybe the three of them can make it to me to soup cake

[02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:38.550]
Barbara Streisand 14 Ricky Martin 13 Oprah who's the late addition and we apologize for that

[02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:41.250]
She's human up to this she's got 11 she'll be a contender

[02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:46.510]
Larry King and Jay Leonard together with 10 share with nine Merlin and roll with eight and the others are small potatoes

[02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:50.330]
My life and love this is for 305

[02:29:50.330 --> 02:29:50.730]
60

[02:29:51.250 --> 02:29:52.630]
Way to way

[02:29:55.090 --> 02:29:56.030]
Where's good?

[02:29:59.030 --> 02:29:59.630]
How?

[02:30:00.350 --> 02:30:00.350]

[02:30:01.290 --> 02:30:02.430]
I'm Neemy Phallistok

[02:30:02.430 --> 02:30:05.230]
It was the summer of 1962

[02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:10.550]
I was working as a White House intern for the Kennedy administration

[02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:13.090]
The days of Camelot

[02:30:13.090 --> 02:30:23.150]
My duties included filing, answering forms, delivering documents and pulling the president's lap taffy

[02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:26.790]
It was a very exciting time in my life

[02:30:26.790 --> 02:30:32.510]
I was 19 years old and never knew what would happen from day to day

[02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:38.370]
One day for instance I might be asked to escort highly salassy into the oval office

[02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:45.450]
The next day maybe I'd be asked to zip up Jay Edgar Hoover's floral pattern dress

[02:30:45.450 --> 02:30:49.330]
And of course Paul I'm a presidential lap taffy

[02:30:49.330 --> 02:30:56.910]
I also remember being asked to make president Kennedy comfortable when he finished his daily swim

[02:30:58.130 --> 02:31:05.630]
It was my job to bring him his towel, his flip flops, and then yank down his speedo and pull the lap taffy

[02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:11.410]
But the mood in the White House changed later that year with the Cuban Missile Crisis

[02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:17.650]
During that time president Kennedy didn't think about sex till after nine in the morning

[02:31:18.510 --> 02:31:21.710]
My right forearm began to look like Popeyes

[02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:28.090]
When I had to have my blouse sleeves let out for make room for my taffy puller

[02:31:28.090 --> 02:31:31.350]
I remember one memory very vividly

[02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:35.850]
The president and I were alone in the residence watching Beverly Hillbillies

[02:31:35.850 --> 02:31:42.130]
He was naked from the waist down and was calling the Ellie May as I pulled the lap taffy

[02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:48.930]
For two weeks following that experience, president Kennedy asked if I wear a rope as a belt

[02:31:48.930 --> 02:31:57.710]
It feels so good to finally have the secret out and to let my grandchildren know I was a White House fuchi

[02:31:57.710 --> 02:32:03.810]
At least now they know I grandma's right forearm is so damn freaking massive

[02:32:03.810 --> 02:32:10.510]
One 19 so independent film channel has got right now and of course the Canadian schedule is different from what you get there

[02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:13.650]
But they got a movie that I wasted my time watching last night

[02:32:14.490 --> 02:32:18.870]
Two and a half hour movie and of course you never watch it because it's really a very faggy movie number one

[02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:22.750]
When that's about 90% of it and number two it's a Canadian movie

[02:32:23.530 --> 02:32:26.850]
No night is too long never heard of it

[02:32:26.850 --> 02:32:27.830]
You don't want to hear of it

[02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:34.230]
I mean it was okay and it was about these two college roommates and they were at least we thought they were gay

[02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:39.750]
And they were having an affair and it were lovers and then the one goes off on a cruise and the one falls in love with his woman

[02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:48.330]
And gets into this wild affair with his married woman and she goes back to Vancouver and the end was like

[02:32:48.330 --> 02:32:55.370]
Eh like that at the end I 11 30 last night I said to myself what the dog is I beg your pardon?

[02:32:55.490 --> 02:32:56.070]
We found the dog

[02:32:56.670 --> 02:32:58.090]
You found the dog

[02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:59.110]
Woohoo

[02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:06.830]
Oh my god what a this program has got power like somebody called we haven't actually seen it yet but somebody called

[02:33:07.450 --> 02:33:07.990]
Uh oh

[02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:09.530]
And they're coming by

[02:33:09.530 --> 02:33:11.430]
Are you sure they're bringing it by the station?

[02:33:12.130 --> 02:33:13.430]
No the house somebody

[02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:15.670]
Where do you find the number and what are they posted?

[02:33:16.690 --> 02:33:18.350]
When he'll post us up all over the neighborhood

[02:33:18.350 --> 02:33:19.870]
Where did they find?

[02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:22.770]
I'm sorry I'm having two conversations at once where I'm on the phone

[02:33:22.770 --> 02:33:26.010]
They found him at a nearby convenience store

[02:33:26.010 --> 02:33:28.190]
Oh maybe he was going out for like a snack

[02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:29.130]
He was dumpster diving

[02:33:29.130 --> 02:33:31.790]
He was that going out for late night snack like Carlos

[02:33:33.310 --> 02:33:36.550]
Yeah don't hey listen Nikki don't be none of Carlos's chow

[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:41.150]
Peter will be starving oh we got all the way to think there's too much bacon in the dumpster

[02:33:41.150 --> 02:33:43.150]
I'll be having dog this week and if that's

[02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:46.570]
We really rush maybe not that one

[02:33:46.570 --> 02:33:51.070]
Oh I mean I listen if I would have kept the urns from my two dogs you could certainly have had some of that

[02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:52.370]
Thank you everyone involved

[02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:54.930]
Yeah thanks to everybody who helped us find George's dog

[02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:55.530]
What a great

[02:33:55.530 --> 02:33:56.450]
Oh oh oh

[02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.490]
Yeah

[02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.450]
Woo

[02:33:59.010 --> 02:34:00.190]
After all this trauma

[02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:02.870]
Well I'm not going to pop nearly as many pills

[02:34:03.370 --> 02:34:03.730]
Well

[02:34:05.150 --> 02:34:06.270]
We're doing as much sugar

[02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:13.370]
I want to tell you I want to see now that you found the dog

[02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:19.390]
I made myself so sick and amped them because it was such a rotten time in a reindeer

[02:34:19.390 --> 02:34:20.650]
We did eating crap you know

[02:34:21.010 --> 02:34:23.110]
I felt like Peter Clayton I ate so much crap

[02:34:25.830 --> 02:34:31.530]
And I had I see one good thing about getting sick about having something that's not life threatening but that's very a bad

[02:34:31.530 --> 02:34:38.210]
Is that at least if you have it the first time and you survive it when it comes back the next time you're not like oh I'm going to I'm dying over here

[02:34:38.210 --> 02:34:45.470]
You see what I'm saying right so like if you have gourd or you have irritable bowel which of course I have all of these things being fentined diabetic and old

[02:34:46.090 --> 02:34:51.790]
But man I just messed up my kishkis eating all of this sugar and of course what did I eat chocolate and nuts?

[02:34:51.790 --> 02:34:57.130]
What are the first the worst two things you can eat for irritable bowel syndrome chocolate and nuts

[02:34:57.130 --> 02:34:59.950]
Not the kind you're thinking of either believe me

[02:35:01.290 --> 02:35:09.250]
Oh dude I so so the last day Sunday when we left there I always my side was aching and now because I've been on good behavioral week

[02:35:09.250 --> 02:35:11.330]
Now I feel pretty good about like 99%

[02:35:12.390 --> 02:35:16.190]
So this weekend do I dare I can't do it

[02:35:17.690 --> 02:35:21.190]
Now see I put some of the audio from this movie but I know you'll have to dump it

[02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:22.170]
Tell them that I'm sick

[02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:26.010]
I'll do it. It's only one night. Yeah see there you go

[02:35:26.730 --> 02:35:30.330]
Because every other word is after this and I am of course right now they're doing it. He's a hump on him

[02:35:30.330 --> 02:35:35.350]
But I mean you don't want to see this movie no one I just too long I mean the this plot is fine

[02:35:35.350 --> 02:35:42.530]
And he loses the card that I had her address in Vancouver and he goes there and he can't find her and he thinks he's killed his boyfriend

[02:35:42.530 --> 02:35:47.930]
And he turns out that he's still alive and then turns out the boyfriend his sister was the broadie fell in love with

[02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:54.950]
You ready for that? Well thanks for the warning. No you're not gonna watch this movie when you watch it on a bet

[02:35:54.950 --> 02:36:01.830]
There should be a little symbol no night is too long if that's everyone need to pen a film channel by you just to say El Paso

[02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:06.690]
Don't watch it horrible on the American IFC. Yes right now they're showing Barton Fink

[02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:12.110]
Oh and isn't it this weekend I think it's tomorrow night that the Sarazon again Requiem for Dream

[02:36:12.110 --> 02:36:17.250]
There you go the guy that wanted us to take the pool will take huh 1215 a.m. Tonight

[02:36:17.250 --> 02:36:25.170]
Oh tonight at 1215 right after midnight tonight 1215 and a.m. Following American history X so double feature double wanny

[02:36:25.170 --> 02:36:30.430]
So you can watch him you can tape him and then over the weekend at your leisure you can watch your Requiem for Dream

[02:36:37.330 --> 02:36:40.290]
One of the most brilliantly made movies in history

[02:36:40.290 --> 02:36:43.310]
I don't give a flying crap all at anybody says believe me

[02:36:43.310 --> 02:36:49.710]
I've seen a couple of movies in my life I've been around a block once or twice I may not be an expert but let's face it who really is an expert

[02:36:50.270 --> 02:36:56.270]
She's like saying who's an expert on ice cream you know that's stupid. There's no such thing as an expert Roger Ebert is an expert on both

[02:36:56.270 --> 02:37:04.390]
He's an asshole is what he is and a flamer. He's a flaming asshole. You notice that too huh? Oh God he makes me puke

[02:37:04.810 --> 02:37:08.970]
And I don't want again I don't want to you know wish any bad health on anybody

[02:37:09.970 --> 02:37:14.790]
FAAAAMING and that's him what couldn't it have been him instead of the other one that's my point we like Jean Sisko

[02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:21.850]
Jean Sisko was America's kind of guy Roger Ebert she's not anybody's kind of girl and Jean wasn't a suit either he liked just good movie

[02:37:21.850 --> 02:37:28.830]
That's right he had good taste Roger Ebert he's a real suit but of course if there's like any young boys in the movie he likes so you notice that?

[02:37:29.050 --> 02:37:36.490]
Yeah of course I can relate to that well not young boys I mean I got to be like I don't know 16 what's wrong with that what did I say

[02:37:37.290 --> 02:37:42.050]
And that movie kids with I'm not gonna waste my time watching that I got too many important fish to fry this weekend

[02:37:42.050 --> 02:37:49.950]
I have time to watch a bunch of 13 year old punks especially if they're ugly you know and of course 13 year olds I mean see Carlos I think is trying to tell us something

[02:37:52.050 --> 02:37:58.270]
Here's Carl Springs hello pretty good sir you know we've been talking about trying to get rid of W

[02:37:58.270 --> 02:38:02.730]
We just got doing it getting behind our boy Bobby Graham I'm behind the man I love him

[02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:09.850]
People aren't talking about this guy's got the best resume the only guy was a balls and I'm all a Democrat to talk about bush growing up

[02:38:09.850 --> 02:38:15.890]
We got a good story on our website this weekend now that you mentioned that it's called where the hell is it about how Graham is the only

[02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:21.590]
Democrat that's got the balls took me about two hours to find it it'll be up in two seconds what do you mean by that?

[02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:26.990]
None of the searches was pulling it up I found it when you finally found the story like I said it'll be on there

[02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:34.230]
The rest of the guy seemed like they're running scared and Graham is on one step and forward and saying the only two that are really saying anything or how a dean and Bob Graham

[02:38:34.230 --> 02:38:39.730]
They're the only two that are really saying anything at all that's true so people can get these people fired up this guy's been here for like 30 years

[02:38:39.730 --> 02:38:48.330]
Oh here it is Graham leads charge against bush and inquiry others shy from saying president covered up evidence I got it right here it's on our website

[02:38:48.330 --> 02:38:55.070]
I got a second I got a promotion overrated okay how about Colin Farrell this guy's the biggest piece of crap

[02:38:57.550 --> 02:39:04.770]
Colin's feral the guy from our fault that crappy movie phone booth that was just out didn't see it didn't tell me just call that in

[02:39:05.370 --> 02:39:10.870]
No nobody called that in nobody I was told that it don't start hyperventilating just because we find your dog George

[02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:17.630]
Okay open on air pal thanks see ya he's right that that black guy that didn't know how to pronounce it

[02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:26.570]
He said Colin feral feral whatever is no he didn't he said he did you could have been called a pal maybe I didn't hear it

[02:39:26.570 --> 02:39:32.830]
Arles told me no he was talking about Colin Powell that's what he said oh

[02:39:33.470 --> 02:39:38.570]
It's Colin's bowels or something like that is what he said I don't know I see you with Colin feral very overrated

[02:39:38.570 --> 02:39:44.530]
I have no idea who that is if I ever seen him he's made two movies recently and I'm sure you didn't see either one

[02:39:44.530 --> 02:39:45.850]
Oh I feel better now

[02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:07.590]
Unbelievable

[02:40:15.530 --> 02:40:16.230]
Another

[02:40:16.230 --> 02:40:20.870]
Beauty Queen

[02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:28.470]
He is so mean

[02:40:28.470 --> 02:40:35.530]
They won't forget it

[02:40:44.530 --> 02:41:09.910]
There was no

[02:41:09.910 --> 02:41:12.690]
To

[02:41:15.530 --> 02:41:15.950]
I

[02:41:23.530 --> 02:41:24.430]
Do you

[02:41:32.530 --> 02:41:35.310]
It's funny

[02:41:44.530 --> 02:41:46.770]
His due and long dream

[02:41:48.530 --> 02:41:50.410]
And dropping some

[02:41:51.530 --> 02:41:54.210]
But in a prison

[02:41:55.530 --> 02:41:58.250]
There's no girl to drop

[02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:59.090]
Brackum

[02:41:59.090 --> 02:42:02.690]
They didn't make drop in

[02:42:03.530 --> 02:42:06.510]
They're all above him

[02:42:07.530 --> 02:42:09.330]
They're dating Tyson

[02:42:11.430 --> 02:42:13.850]
133-560-WQ

[02:42:13.850 --> 02:42:16.610]
My friend, Tyson, said he's so angry about his rape conviction 11 years ago

[02:42:16.610 --> 02:42:19.950]
Now that he wants to rape his accuser and her mother now, and your mama

[02:42:21.150 --> 02:42:24.790]
In a TV interview sketch of a broadcast last night, somehow I missed that

[02:42:25.730 --> 02:42:28.730]
I saw Richard, it was a lot more entertaining than no night is too long

[02:42:28.730 --> 02:42:33.210]
But anyway, the former heavyweight boxing champion repeated his claim that he was innocent of raping beauty

[02:42:33.210 --> 02:42:38.050]
Page and contestant Desi Rae Washington in 1991 in an Indianapolis hotel room

[02:42:38.050 --> 02:42:40.930]
I just hate her guts, he said she put me in that state

[02:42:40.930 --> 02:42:45.190]
Where I don't know, I really wish I did now, but I really do want to rape her and her mama

[02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:49.030]
If they hadn't bleached him so goddamn much

[02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:51.890]
It actually would have been a pretty slut funny interview

[02:42:51.890 --> 02:42:53.050]
Oh, you saw it? Yeah

[02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:55.650]
Why now would you be watching that?

[02:42:55.910 --> 02:43:00.050]
It came on and the remote was, I don't know, three feet away

[02:43:00.050 --> 02:43:01.570]
Was this before after you lost the dog?

[02:43:02.050 --> 02:43:02.370]
Before

[02:43:02.930 --> 02:43:04.930]
Oh, seeing that's probably why the dog ran away

[02:43:04.930 --> 02:43:07.250]
And you want to know why? Because it was unfox

[02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:15.090]
Tyson was convicted in 1992 with census this year's in prison, sir, three years before being released on parole

[02:43:15.090 --> 02:43:21.430]
He made the comments during interview in Miami, beach, Florida with Fox News anchor, Greta Van Sustorin, the ugly one

[02:43:21.430 --> 02:43:24.850]
Oh, it's speaking of people with bad nose jobs and face job

[02:43:24.850 --> 02:43:29.610]
Oh my god, have you ever seen Suh Herrera on CNBC? No

[02:43:30.250 --> 02:43:35.250]
Ah, ah, I guarantee if you flipped across there and you saw her you'd recognize her, she's been under a long time

[02:43:35.790 --> 02:43:41.650]
She had a nose job and it looks, you know how we have the mo picture on our website, right?

[02:43:42.010 --> 02:43:48.590]
That's what it looks like. It looks like somebody has artificially pasted a groucho nose without the glasses and the mustache on her push

[02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:54.750]
Hey, ah, maybe it's too late now sweetheart. Too late to get the old nose back. I mean she looks like a man

[02:43:54.750 --> 02:43:59.930]
I mean, I thought she was ever great looking to begin. Once she was okay, she was like a human being

[02:43:59.930 --> 02:44:04.970]
Now she looks like a broad with a bad nose job Suh Herrera on the gambling channel

[02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:10.090]
Graham leads charge against Bush and inquiry

[02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:17.750]
US Senator Bob Graham says the Bush administration is fated to release documents regarding the 2001 terrorist attacks as Tana Mont to a cover up

[02:44:17.750 --> 02:44:21.290]
But his democratic presidential rivals aren't so sure or so ballsy

[02:44:21.930 --> 02:44:24.850]
The rest of the democratic field supports releasing more information

[02:44:24.850 --> 02:44:30.310]
But stop short of accusing the administration of trying to conceal lapses that could have prevented the devastating attacks at 9-11

[02:44:30.310 --> 02:44:33.890]
I'm not prepared to reach that conclusion since senator Jew Lieberman of Connecticut

[02:44:33.890 --> 02:44:38.590]
When asked about Graham's charges during a visit to Iowa earlier this week if it goes on much longer

[02:44:38.590 --> 02:44:41.130]
I think we'll all have to ask what are they covering up

[02:44:42.770 --> 02:44:49.170]
Iraq was a distraction from the war on terror Graham said we're less secure and not more secure at Lieber event in Des Moines

[02:44:49.170 --> 02:44:55.370]
The terrorists have regenerated and the president now is attempting to cover up the facts Graham says he wants the Bush administration

[02:44:55.370 --> 02:45:01.350]
Did he classify everything except sensitive national security information contained in a report of the Joaquin Racial Investigation

[02:45:01.350 --> 02:45:07.810]
He helped to lead for more than 10 months the committee looked in detail at the actions of the CIA and the FBI prior to 9-11

[02:45:07.810 --> 02:45:12.630]
To learn what could be done to stop future terrorists to come in the story goes on it will be on our website momentarily is it on there?

[02:45:14.390 --> 02:45:18.110]
It's already on there. It's already on there. There's blowing a blown a boy hard at work. Oh!

[02:45:18.110 --> 02:45:19.470]
He's doing it

[02:45:20.270 --> 02:45:26.010]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we're asking today who is or was the most overrated celebrity of all time

[02:45:26.010 --> 02:45:38.110]
Rosie O'Donnell she is an elite overgrown 65 for you Rosie you silly fat dyke you Michael Jackson 38 just in Tinkerbell 31 no penis

[02:45:38.950 --> 02:45:43.170]
Gloria Steph and in fact I bet you Gloria Steph I'm got a bigger penis than Justin Tinkerbell don't you think?

[02:45:43.730 --> 02:45:53.130]
Let's go me Leo no contest glory as Stefan 29 Elvis and Carson daily tied with 26 now why couldn't Elvis still be alive well

[02:45:53.130 --> 02:46:01.090]
Frank Sinatra and Madonna 22 Bob Hope 19 you know that would that would be an excellent pool I don't know how you do that but

[02:46:01.090 --> 02:46:12.030]
For partners or people who are comparable and one has died another one is alive, you know right like Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis right see what I mean wouldn't it be better if Dean Martin were still well

[02:46:12.890 --> 02:46:16.890]
Although the way Jerry looks lately I don't think it's gonna be Bob Hope 19

[02:46:18.510 --> 02:46:27.550]
Thanks for the memories hey Bob you're you suck Oprah 18 Martha Stewart 18 Mariah Scurry 17 Barbara Streisand I think she's a little bit

[02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:38.290]

[02:47:00.290 --> 02:47:07.570]
Johnny Carson's got a couple already good Bob Newhart two Christina Aguilaric having cost her and David Hasel Hort each have one

[02:47:07.570 --> 02:47:15.830]
Everybody's got at least one that's unusual in it yeah 469 vote that's pretty unusual generally by this time in the show we got some you know that don't have any yet

[02:47:16.690 --> 02:47:22.410]
Now did we leave anybody or how about Colin Farrell I don't see him on there yet I don't see Bono or Puff Diddy on there yet

[02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:30.950]
Not that I want to start getting pushy with Eric because once he starts showing in and God damn breakfast cross sandwiches with bacon and cheese and egg

[02:47:32.570 --> 02:47:35.630]
His cholesterol goes shooting up like a rocket

[02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:37.630]

[02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:35.010]
We found George's dog and it's still alive still cute now are you positive? I mean you obviously had we don't have the dog in our hands yet but they've had a conversation the lady saw the wanted poster and

[02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:44.010]
Oh, it was a lady okay, you know some guy might be a wise guy, you know, ladies are gonna usually try by convenience store like two thirty in the morning last night really

[02:48:45.050 --> 02:48:50.770]
And saw the poster today and called and said I know she was hanging out of the dog for you right?

[02:48:52.610 --> 02:48:56.770]
She was holding it she was holding it. I hope she didn't feed it nothing on

[02:48:57.370 --> 02:49:05.430]
Sure one meal of whatever it ain't gonna kill it. What do you think it was doing in the dumpster? The restrictive diet is you know there's things that he can't eat.

[02:49:05.710 --> 02:49:14.270]
No, no, wait a minute. He was in the dumpster. No, that's a joke. Then what's that like you talking about boner boy? I really thought he was in the dumpster. He was teasing.

[02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:24.170]
Oh, no, he knows he nights when it rains. I see your laugh when you sleep under the overpass and nights when it rains like the last the week it's been brutal.

[02:49:24.830 --> 02:49:26.970]
Beaner boy has to hop in the dumpster and close the lid.

[02:49:28.250 --> 02:49:32.930]
And like the canisterno. So there you go. If he would have effect if Nikki would have been the right part of town.

[02:49:33.310 --> 02:49:34.930]
He could have had some company last night old beaner.

[02:49:34.930 --> 02:49:35.530]
What's up?

[02:49:35.770 --> 02:49:39.370]
I'm going to look all this. He's five sixty. What's the matter with you?

[02:49:39.670 --> 02:49:41.250]
You're the only one who's in the dumpster.

[02:49:41.250 --> 02:49:43.470]
You and me.

[02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:46.250]
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

[02:49:49.170 --> 02:49:49.690]
Hello?

[02:49:50.650 --> 02:49:51.170]
Eisner?

[02:49:51.850 --> 02:49:53.030]
Uh, uh, yes?

[02:49:53.490 --> 02:49:58.870]
Mouse. Oh, Mr. Mouse. Good morning. How are you, sir? I'm not good, Eisner.

[02:49:58.870 --> 02:50:05.510]
Oh, you're not feeling well, sir? I'm watching the television. The ABC 50-year reunion special.

[02:50:05.930 --> 02:50:09.010]
Oh, what an amazing special. What a night to remember.

[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:13.170]
Yeah, a night to remember for you. How many times were you on camera?

[02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:15.110]
Uh, I don't know.

[02:50:15.130 --> 02:50:17.570]
I caught it 75. Oh, what a...

[02:50:17.570 --> 02:50:25.470]
Really? It was all about you. You make well maniac. You've only been with a company out of all ten years or whatever. And you run it into the toilet.

[02:50:25.470 --> 02:50:28.530]
Uh, uh, what did you think of my speech, sir?

[02:50:28.810 --> 02:50:33.310]
I thought it was terrible. You're awful. Why didn't I give the speech?

[02:50:33.730 --> 02:50:38.130]
Well, sir, since I am the president and CEO of the company, I thought of...

[02:50:38.130 --> 02:50:39.030]
You're an idiot.

[02:50:39.550 --> 02:50:43.570]
Well, we did have some major talent. I mean, we had John Travolta, Tim Allen.

[02:50:43.770 --> 02:50:45.290]
Oh, Tim Allen.

[02:50:45.890 --> 02:50:47.390]
Uh, uh, uh, please.

[02:50:48.010 --> 02:50:48.610]
Hold on, sir.

[02:50:49.710 --> 02:50:51.230]
Stop that for a second. Stop that for a second.

[02:50:51.410 --> 02:50:52.790]
Who was that?

[02:50:52.790 --> 02:50:56.350]
Uh, no, no one. It's just the help you were saying about Tim Allen?

[02:50:56.490 --> 02:50:57.790]
That that are not the remus.

[02:50:58.670 --> 02:50:59.870]
No, no, no, no, no. I didn't.

[02:50:59.870 --> 02:51:01.030]
We called him sick today.

[02:51:01.490 --> 02:51:02.130]
Oh, that's...

[02:51:02.130 --> 02:51:04.270]
I got paper work up to my big ears.

[02:51:06.070 --> 02:51:07.670]
It's Remus, isn't it?

[02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:08.310]
Put him on.

[02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:10.710]
No, no, sir. So you were saying Tim Allen, what up?

[02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:12.390]
I am on. Is that Remus?

[02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:13.570]
Yes, it is, sir.

[02:51:13.770 --> 02:51:14.910]
Put him on the phone.

[02:51:16.970 --> 02:51:18.930]
Remus, remus, remus, remus, stop that for a second.

[02:51:19.270 --> 02:51:19.730]
No, uh, uh.

[02:51:20.810 --> 02:51:21.930]
What'd you say?

[02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:23.230]
Hello.

[02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:24.510]
What do you call him?

[02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:27.330]
What do you mean who's this?

[02:51:29.430 --> 02:51:31.110]
How you doing, boss?

[02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:34.950]
Did I get to hear you call either boss? Who's your boss?

[02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:36.230]
Who's your boss?

[02:51:36.590 --> 02:51:37.210]
You're my boss.

[02:51:37.430 --> 02:51:38.170]
I'm your boss.

[02:51:38.250 --> 02:51:38.870]
You're my boss.

[02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.950]
Remus? Yeah?

[02:51:40.410 --> 02:51:42.650]
Why aren't you here today? You called him sick.

[02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:44.510]
I picked him last time.

[02:51:44.750 --> 02:51:46.650]
You know, like, Simpwitz does on the army.

[02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:47.670]
Why PD Blue?

[02:51:48.510 --> 02:51:49.470]
Last time.

[02:51:50.330 --> 02:51:51.870]
You work here, Remus.

[02:51:52.470 --> 02:51:54.350]
I've done tons of things for you.

[02:51:54.670 --> 02:51:56.190]
I paid for your rehab, didn't I?

[02:51:56.530 --> 02:51:58.390]
I'm a meaner to talk to you about that, boss.

[02:51:58.490 --> 02:51:59.970]
Got you off the quirk, Remus.

[02:52:00.250 --> 02:52:01.650]
I need a little refresher, boss.

[02:52:02.410 --> 02:52:03.770]
I'll tell you what, Remus.

[02:52:04.050 --> 02:52:05.430]
I'm almost done here, boss.

[02:52:05.910 --> 02:52:07.290]
What are you doing over there?

[02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:08.710]
What an egoozier.

[02:52:10.290 --> 02:52:10.770]
Hodgeocuzier.

[02:52:10.990 --> 02:52:12.550]
It's a view, boss.

[02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:15.210]
Put the McWarmaniac on.

[02:52:15.710 --> 02:52:16.370]
Hold on.

[02:52:16.370 --> 02:52:17.630]
Are you with me?

[02:52:17.790 --> 02:52:18.170]
It's Sir.

[02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:19.990]
Ah, Jocuzier.

[02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:22.790]
Well, it's been very stressful these days.

[02:52:23.030 --> 02:52:25.030]
You know, with the false schedule and everything getting ready,

[02:52:25.190 --> 02:52:26.210]
I've been very stressed.

[02:52:26.630 --> 02:52:29.290]
You don't need a Jocuzier in your office.

[02:52:29.970 --> 02:52:30.830]
You're terrible.

[02:52:31.430 --> 02:52:32.230]
What stress?

[02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:34.450]
Remus, Remus, Remus.

[02:52:34.530 --> 02:52:35.790]
How do we have Tim Allen?

[02:52:36.270 --> 02:52:38.610]
Well, Tim Allen, a major star for the company.

[02:52:38.610 --> 02:52:39.450]
A major star.

[02:52:39.730 --> 02:52:41.870]
He hasn't even had a show for years.

[02:52:42.370 --> 02:52:45.010]
I mean, Shar, first of all, it was funny in all the neighborhood of the fans.

[02:52:45.010 --> 02:52:46.130]
And you couldn't see a space.

[02:52:46.230 --> 02:52:47.850]
And Tim Allen made you all with food.

[02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:50.930]
The chronic noises, but come on.

[02:52:51.090 --> 02:52:52.250]
Well, he is Santa Claus.

[02:52:52.470 --> 02:52:54.010]
I mean, two hits Santa Claus movie.

[02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.370]
I'm firing.

[02:52:54.850 --> 02:52:54.990]
What?

[02:52:55.350 --> 02:52:55.910]
Fire him.

[02:52:56.130 --> 02:52:56.870]
Fire him.

[02:52:57.210 --> 02:52:57.490]
Fire him.

[02:52:57.490 --> 02:52:57.950]
Fire him.

[02:52:59.070 --> 02:53:00.170]
I'm trying to say it's a fire.

[02:53:00.790 --> 02:53:01.470]
But I can't speak.

[02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:02.630]
Fire him.

[02:53:03.050 --> 02:53:04.870]
Tell Remus, it's over.

[02:53:05.350 --> 02:53:06.310]
I'm talking to him.

[02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:07.070]
Good.

[02:53:07.850 --> 02:53:08.930]
Tell him I'm talking to him.

[02:53:09.130 --> 02:53:11.510]
Remus, Mr. Mouse is docking you.

[02:53:12.730 --> 02:53:13.530]
He's booding.

[02:53:14.410 --> 02:53:15.530]
I'm no doctor.

[02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:17.050]
I can't even read.

[02:53:19.090 --> 02:53:19.890]
Not doctor.

[02:53:20.250 --> 02:53:20.770]
It's docking.

[02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.870]
Forget it.

[02:53:23.350 --> 02:53:24.430]
Bunch of losers.

[02:53:25.410 --> 02:53:26.730]
What a wonderful day.

[02:53:27.490 --> 02:53:28.590]
We found George's dog.

[02:53:28.630 --> 02:53:28.870]
Oh!

[02:53:28.910 --> 02:53:29.970]
He made some nice lady, did that.

[02:53:29.970 --> 02:53:30.430]
That's a good news.

[02:53:30.630 --> 02:53:30.750]
Okay.

[02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:32.790]
We accomplished something really productive today.

[02:53:32.870 --> 02:53:33.990]
All we had nothing to do with it.

[02:53:35.030 --> 02:53:35.410]
Apparently.

[02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:39.970]
If she saw your thing, the post I wanted your orange posters, I had a little piece of advice

[02:53:39.970 --> 02:53:40.330]
for you.

[02:53:40.330 --> 02:53:43.950]
I don't want to be a bathe in your dog and letting it out without its collar and tag on it.

[02:53:44.170 --> 02:53:44.170]

[02:53:45.130 --> 02:53:46.290]
Just a little piece of advice.

[02:53:46.490 --> 02:53:49.690]
And don't have any slivers or cracks in your fence.

[02:53:50.590 --> 02:53:52.290]
Well, I mean, that's never going to be perfect.

[02:53:52.490 --> 02:53:54.410]
Little dogs always find some devious way.

[02:53:54.530 --> 02:53:57.330]
But at least know that you got the collar and the tag on it in the future.

[02:53:57.530 --> 02:53:58.450]
Just a little piece of advice.

[02:53:58.450 --> 02:53:58.670]
Yeah.

[02:53:58.970 --> 02:53:59.470]
Good plan.

[02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.670]
Here's four.

[02:54:00.870 --> 02:54:01.270]
Here's four.

[02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:02.570]
Four-letteredale.

[02:54:02.650 --> 02:54:02.790]
Hello.

[02:54:03.810 --> 02:54:04.190]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:05.570 --> 02:54:07.570]
Not the tag on the whole wrecking with a dream thing.

[02:54:08.050 --> 02:54:08.370]
Yeah.

[02:54:08.570 --> 02:54:10.350]
Have you seen the movie Rules of Attraction?

[02:54:11.250 --> 02:54:11.470]
No.

[02:54:11.830 --> 02:54:12.390]
You haven't seen it?

[02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:13.030]
No.

[02:54:13.230 --> 02:54:13.870]
You're going to check it out.

[02:54:13.970 --> 02:54:19.010]
It's got like a whole bunch of those pretty boy, those guys from 7th Heaven and all these people.

[02:54:19.290 --> 02:54:19.930]
Oh, right.

[02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:21.910]
And they play these like scooter rules.

[02:54:22.190 --> 02:54:24.930]
It's like, I don't know how to explain it.

[02:54:25.010 --> 02:54:26.830]
It's like five different stories at all compared to one.

[02:54:26.910 --> 02:54:27.610]
It's really messed up.

[02:54:27.630 --> 02:54:28.030]
Oh, right.

[02:54:28.210 --> 02:54:29.450]
Okay, I'm going to go out and get it today.

[02:54:29.950 --> 02:54:30.190]
Awesome.

[02:54:31.070 --> 02:54:32.070]
I like how you kind of flick.

[02:54:32.990 --> 02:54:33.930]
Thanks, pal.

[02:54:33.930 --> 02:54:34.210]
Thanks.

[02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:35.990]
Rules of attraction.

[02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.690]
Now you've seen it?

[02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:38.290]
I saw a part of it.

[02:54:38.310 --> 02:54:40.070]
It did have good looking people in it.

[02:54:40.290 --> 02:54:40.650]
Well, there you go.

[02:54:40.770 --> 02:54:43.170]
It's not kind of what we like I said, even if they have their clothes on.

[02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:46.950]
Let's take a call from, what is it?

[02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:47.910]
Davy.

[02:54:48.030 --> 02:54:48.190]
Hello.

[02:54:49.670 --> 02:54:50.470]
Wayne Newton.

[02:54:51.150 --> 02:54:51.850]
He's on air.

[02:54:52.110 --> 02:54:54.850]
At least he's supposed to be on air, but now that you mention it.

[02:54:55.230 --> 02:54:56.270]
He should be number one.

[02:54:56.430 --> 02:54:57.790]
He's most overrated.

[02:54:58.390 --> 02:54:58.930]
Thank you.

[02:54:59.350 --> 02:55:00.390]
And Mickey Rock.

[02:55:00.390 --> 02:55:01.270]
Most underrated.

[02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.850]
Okay.

[02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:02.270]
Thank you.

[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:03.050]
That was Mickey.

[02:55:03.470 --> 02:55:06.210]
No, seriously, Mickey Wayne Newton never got on there.

[02:55:06.390 --> 02:55:08.090]
We, somebody called him in.

[02:55:08.470 --> 02:55:09.110]
Thank you.

[02:55:09.410 --> 02:55:09.770]
Profusely.

[02:55:09.870 --> 02:55:11.790]
This last caller, whoever, whatever you are.

[02:55:12.410 --> 02:55:13.730]
I have, I wrote it down.

[02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:14.350]
It's right here.

[02:55:14.850 --> 02:55:15.390]
I wrote it down.

[02:55:15.950 --> 02:55:16.930]
We all wrote it down.

[02:55:16.990 --> 02:55:18.270]
It's up to course for certain people.

[02:55:18.330 --> 02:55:23.270]
He was right after Oprah was Wayne Newton on my list, right between Oprah and David Hasselhoff,

[02:55:24.090 --> 02:55:25.130]
between a rock and a hard place.

[02:55:25.270 --> 02:55:26.030]
Oh, he's got the hard edge.

[02:55:26.470 --> 02:55:26.470]

[02:55:27.250 --> 02:55:27.930]
He got the whole weekend.

[02:55:28.410 --> 02:55:29.710]
Yeah, he got the whole weekend of catch up.

[02:55:29.710 --> 02:55:33.770]
But Wayne Newton certainly ought to be on air, although the Humphers says that he puts on a hell of a show in Vegas.

[02:55:35.030 --> 02:55:37.170]
I don't know what he's talking about when he says that.

[02:55:37.470 --> 02:55:39.090]
I mean, he's called Dancing, huh?

[02:55:39.490 --> 02:55:40.870]
Maybe him, him or saw a different show.

[02:55:43.130 --> 02:55:43.910]
What does that mean?

[02:55:44.170 --> 02:55:44.890]
Like a private show.

[02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:54.690]
Yeah, I guess that was a favor, okay, because I'm going to say it's getting close to lunchtime for me.

[02:55:54.830 --> 02:55:55.690]
I've eaten nothing all day.

[02:55:55.690 --> 02:56:02.190]
I've worked up a really healthy appetite as a growing old man, and you're talking about

[02:56:02.190 --> 02:56:04.390]
anything will would wait Newton beneath the neck.

[02:56:06.570 --> 02:56:07.910]
Makes me want to puke.

[02:56:08.370 --> 02:56:09.290]
Here's a lady in plantation.

[02:56:09.630 --> 02:56:09.790]
Hello.

[02:56:10.470 --> 02:56:10.670]
Hi.

[02:56:11.070 --> 02:56:11.590]
Yes, man.

[02:56:12.430 --> 02:56:13.330]
I'm really nervous.

[02:56:14.070 --> 02:56:15.030]
I'm really nervous, please.

[02:56:15.210 --> 02:56:17.570]
Those of us congratulations to George for finding his dog.

[02:56:18.030 --> 02:56:18.230]
Right.

[02:56:19.710 --> 02:56:21.390]
And down to questions for you.

[02:56:21.510 --> 02:56:24.310]
Do you have this list of movies posted on your website anywhere?

[02:56:24.310 --> 02:56:28.250]
You know, I'm glad you mentioned that because we were supposed to do that before one of

[02:56:28.250 --> 02:56:29.310]
a occasion when I came back.

[02:56:29.310 --> 02:56:31.110]
I noticed that it's conspicuously missing.

[02:56:31.250 --> 02:56:33.690]
Our website is great, but they never made it on there.

[02:56:34.170 --> 02:56:34.510]
Right, right.

[02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:39.250]
And it seems every caller keeps talking about the same 10 movies over and over again.

[02:56:39.690 --> 02:56:39.870]
Right.

[02:56:40.270 --> 02:56:42.170]
You know, I mean, let's have some new recommendations.

[02:56:42.770 --> 02:56:44.210]
I think everything you guys talk about.

[02:56:44.430 --> 02:56:45.350]
We got rules of attraction.

[02:56:45.350 --> 02:56:46.010]
Have you seen that?

[02:56:46.390 --> 02:56:47.350]
No, I have not seen that one.

[02:56:47.670 --> 02:56:49.350]
There's one we got to check out this weekend.

[02:56:49.710 --> 02:56:50.910]
Yes, yes, definitely.

[02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:56.030]
And to say you know, regarding the movie Kids, if you saw the movie Bowley,

[02:56:56.630 --> 02:57:01.450]
the guy who played the gangster, the one who knew all about how to commit the murder and everything,

[02:57:02.050 --> 02:57:04.830]
he plays one of the roles in Kids.

[02:57:05.330 --> 02:57:06.690]
Kids is not a real documentary.

[02:57:07.030 --> 02:57:07.530]
It's all actors.

[02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:08.270]
Right.

[02:57:09.310 --> 02:57:14.350]
So he plays what's his name, Telly, one of the most kids in Kids.

[02:57:14.390 --> 02:57:15.390]
I hated Bowley.

[02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:17.790]
I mean, it was the biggest waste of time of my life.

[02:57:17.790 --> 02:57:18.630]
It was just awful.

[02:57:18.630 --> 02:57:20.550]
It was like Kitty porn, wasn't it?

[02:57:20.690 --> 02:57:22.330]
I mean, no, it was just crap.

[02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:23.810]
It was just gratuitous violence.

[02:57:24.070 --> 02:57:25.110]
And the acting was awful.

[02:57:25.270 --> 02:57:27.890]
It was just, there was no point to it, even though it was a true story.

[02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:30.770]
And supposedly the hook that we were supposed to be excited about,

[02:57:30.850 --> 02:57:32.130]
it was it happened in Florida.

[02:57:32.350 --> 02:57:34.210]
You know, it happened in, where was it in Weston?

[02:57:34.310 --> 02:57:34.630]
In Hollywood.

[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:38.530]
It happened before it, Weston existed.

[02:57:38.910 --> 02:57:39.890]
So that's the funny thing.

[02:57:40.290 --> 02:57:40.810]
How do you like that?

[02:57:41.250 --> 02:57:42.370]
Yeah, how do you like that?

[02:57:42.430 --> 02:57:45.170]
It's probably what they changed, probably what they changed the name of that part of it.

[02:57:46.630 --> 02:57:47.410]
Rules of attraction.

[02:57:47.410 --> 02:57:48.430]
Okay, thanks.

[02:57:48.430 --> 02:57:48.790]
We learned.

[02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.250]
Bye.

[02:57:49.930 --> 02:57:52.090]
I forgot to ask you if you saw a record for a dream.

[02:57:53.170 --> 02:57:56.330]
Don't forget we're going to be taking a mini pool before our regular pool on Monday.

[02:57:56.350 --> 02:57:59.630]
I mean, that's not going to qualify as a regular pool for a whole day,

[02:57:59.630 --> 02:58:01.430]
because they're just starting off people who've seen it.

[02:58:02.090 --> 02:58:03.110]
12, 15 night.

[02:58:03.750 --> 02:58:07.530]
Right after midnight tonight on the IFC independent film channel.

[02:58:10.090 --> 02:58:11.390]
Why are they so reluctant?

[02:58:11.550 --> 02:58:11.650]
Why?

[02:58:11.730 --> 02:58:12.710]
I mean, they can tape it.

[02:58:12.970 --> 02:58:14.110]
They can tape it.

[02:58:15.170 --> 02:58:16.690]
Please, do yourself a favor.

[02:58:16.690 --> 02:58:17.450]
We're begging you.

[02:58:17.950 --> 02:58:18.810]
You'll love it.

[02:58:19.890 --> 02:58:21.330]
Here's Coke and a Cree.

[02:58:21.450 --> 02:58:21.690]
Hello.

[02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:25.670]
Hi, how can you have this pool without Carol Channing?

[02:58:26.970 --> 02:58:27.730]
Carol Channing?

[02:58:27.750 --> 02:58:28.030]
I mean, Carol Channing?

[02:58:28.030 --> 02:58:28.970]
Overrated celebrity.

[02:58:29.250 --> 02:58:32.910]
And, and then while we're talking about actresses, a close second,

[02:58:33.090 --> 02:58:37.910]
the queen of post-nasal drip, murals, creeps.

[02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:39.490]
She only does one axis nibbles.

[02:58:40.370 --> 02:58:40.650]
Okay.

[02:58:41.730 --> 02:58:43.490]
I like Carol Channing better.

[02:58:43.610 --> 02:58:44.410]
I'll give you Carol Channing.

[02:58:44.470 --> 02:58:44.710]
How's that?

[02:58:45.010 --> 02:58:45.150]
Good.

[02:58:45.150 --> 02:58:46.170]
Okay, thanks.

[02:58:46.510 --> 02:58:47.750]
Yeah, get Carol Channing on there.

[02:58:47.810 --> 02:58:49.170]
Oh, she does have a nice hairdo.

[02:58:50.150 --> 02:58:51.330]
What is she about?

[02:58:51.390 --> 02:58:52.550]
150 something like that?

[02:58:53.450 --> 02:58:53.890]
Wow.

[02:58:55.510 --> 02:58:59.810]
Yeah, she, you know, in fact, it's interesting he should mention that,

[02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:03.110]
because she's got the real shrill sound, you know?

[02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:03.830]
Yeah.

[02:59:04.470 --> 02:59:08.150]
You see, now you're going to have you ever seen Carol Channing with...

[02:59:10.470 --> 02:59:10.910]
Huh?

[02:59:12.990 --> 02:59:15.130]
I think this guy just uncovered a yes.

[02:59:15.130 --> 02:59:16.010]
He's a secret of QAM.

[02:59:16.310 --> 02:59:18.630]
Scott Farrell is, uh, Carol Channing.

[02:59:18.690 --> 02:59:19.250]
How do you like that?

[02:59:19.350 --> 02:59:20.270]
You're a slut.

[02:59:20.890 --> 02:59:22.610]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:24.330]
Or at least he knows Carol Channing.

[02:59:24.510 --> 02:59:25.730]
She's a liar.

[02:59:26.530 --> 02:59:28.810]
Anyway, Rosie is just running away.

[02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:31.450]
She is a, she's smothering the pack, so to speak.

[02:59:31.490 --> 02:59:33.450]
And that's another disgusting thought right a lunchtime.

[02:59:33.810 --> 02:59:35.110]
Rosie's got 70 votes.

[02:59:36.050 --> 02:59:38.510]
Michael Jackson 39, Justin Tinkerbell 34.

[02:59:38.970 --> 02:59:40.070]
Maybe that's a good pull for money.

[02:59:40.170 --> 02:59:41.910]
Who would you least like to have sit on your face?

[02:59:41.910 --> 02:59:44.290]
What are they doing along?

[02:59:44.930 --> 02:59:48.190]
We're supporting O5 City, QAM.

[02:59:49.790 --> 02:59:50.790]
Esther.

[02:59:59.550 --> 03:00:01.610]
Rosie, your down on.

[03:00:02.270 --> 03:00:03.830]
Can't believe she's gay.

[03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:08.510]
A big phantom, the W and the A.

[03:00:09.310 --> 03:00:10.930]
Rosie, your down on.

[03:00:10.930 --> 03:00:12.990]
It must be your room.

[03:00:13.730 --> 03:00:17.530]
For all of these years you claim to love time cruise.

[03:00:18.250 --> 03:00:21.550]
Certainly you must realize we knew it.

[03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:25.830]
Honestly, it's not that big a shock.

[03:00:27.030 --> 03:00:31.270]
If you and Ricky Martin were to do it.

[03:00:32.630 --> 03:00:35.990]
It'd be a crock for Baltimore.

[03:00:36.790 --> 03:00:38.390]
Rosie, your down home.

[03:00:38.870 --> 03:00:40.490]
Give up all the lies.

[03:00:41.210 --> 03:00:45.070]
Now I hope Nathan Lane and Missy like guys.

[03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:48.330]
I'm going to go back.

[03:00:49.630 --> 03:00:51.390]
Hey, don't forget to set up in 3-5.

[03:00:51.510 --> 03:00:53.630]
Go buy and congratulate George on finding his little dog.

[03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.910]
I'll show you a picture.

[03:00:55.390 --> 03:00:57.150]
3-5 this afternoon, a four-law to deal Harley.

[03:00:57.330 --> 03:00:58.650]
On Federal Highway, just south of Oakland.

[03:00:58.870 --> 03:01:00.050]
Stop by to win Marlon Red's tickets.

[03:01:00.430 --> 03:01:01.710]
And free food from Atlantic City Sub.

[03:01:01.770 --> 03:01:03.350]
And a mad dog is next and Hank gets four.

[03:01:03.350 --> 03:01:04.350]
Bye-bye-bye.

[03:01:04.590 --> 03:01:06.650]
The adventure will be the Roger Show on Climax.

[03:01:06.850 --> 03:01:09.010]
Until you QA have the plan for Marlon Red's.

[03:01:09.350 --> 03:01:09.870]
Watch them out.
