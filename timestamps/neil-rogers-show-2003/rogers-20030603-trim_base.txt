[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]
Have just tasted your snack.

[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.280]
Hey, where's your food going?

[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:04.960]
Come here, come here.

[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.740]
Oh, man.

[00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.920]
Don't you ever take a bad...

[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.040]
What?

[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.800]
Where's your food going?

[00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:12.860]
Ah!

[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.100]
Ah!

[00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.180]

[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.000]
He's a walking ghost!

[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.760]
When I check it out, I can blow my head.

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.580]
And the boxes that reduce your doom.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.260]
I ain't doing it, but I know it.

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.220]
His hair he used our oozing down.

[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.560]
Drill him on my pants.

[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.980]
And then that best bill will make you new.

[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.920]
Things his girls are funny.

[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.100]
So the red light says, I went out on you and he's getting the pants.

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.180]
But Henry wants to scare.

[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.060]
Walks through hallway sideways.

[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.600]
And he's covered with your real hair.

[00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.580]
Mama says he's up there.

[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.680]
He's a king and some young men are leaving alone.

[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.800]
We're not too sure what's going on there.

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.340]
Stay away from me.

[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.120]
Josh Greenman.

[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.020]
I feel things seem funny, but he's no stand-age.

[00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.080]
I'm funny, isn't he?

[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.320]
Don't come near me.

[00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.380]
Josh Greenman.

[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.580]
He's no one can squeeze his knees out of my belly button and sell it by the pound.

[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:26.920]
It is bad.

[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.840]
Got so bad his guts exploded.

[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.240]
You ingretched pile all over the room.

[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.000]
There's staples of pants down his roof.

[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.540]
Just to hold in all that greasy old food.

[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.880]
Stay away from me.

[00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.820]
Josh Greenman.

[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.220]
Do you think I care if Chris Roy doesn't like me?

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.580]
I think he does.

[00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.160]
Don't come near me.

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.100]
Josh Greenman.

[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.060]
Come here, come here.

[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.160]
He's gone.

[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.360]
Bye-bye.

[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.640]
That's the best news of the century.

[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.680]
That's one of the really great pieces of news.

[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.180]
In addition to what's the rumor I'm here in about the Mo and Gully show?

[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.880]
I'm here they're going to keep pushing them back one more hour into the night and then see if they show up.

[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.660]
What point do they stop showing up?

[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.440]
I think the 1 to 4 am.

[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.300]
Let's give it a shot.

[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.820]
We don't have a lot of time because we got so many spots.

[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.380]
It's really appropriate that the movie we're asking about in the first hour today is Glenn Gary, Glenn Ross.

[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.220]
Got those leads.

[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.920]
Passable on to our sales department because if anybody needs some leads they sure is held to.

[00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.060]
What is going on with you assholes in that sales department man?

[00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.080]
Unbelievable.

[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.700]
We're having a going out of business sale here at WQIM.

[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.640]
No spots radio.

[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:14.860]
We go from last Thursday when we had the transmitter fart for three hours and we were running like 20 minutes of spots an hour to now like yesterday and today when it's invisible.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.340]
It's invisible because I think part of the bill at the FCC passed yesterday was that Clear Channel gets all radio spots.

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.040]
No, no, that's in the bill.

[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.640]
It's part of the new law in America if you're going to advertise on radio it must be with cheap channel.

[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.000]
At least 82% of your budget has to be with them.

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.420]
Anyway, we asked yesterday because I'm thinking about getting another dog.

[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.500]
I don't know.

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.520]
I'm thinking.

[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.920]
What's the best breed of dog for a pet?

[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.100]
MUT.

[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.280]
246.

[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.340]
That was what I said.

[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:46.960]
Get yourself a mongrel.

[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.820]
More times than not.

[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.420]
They're great.

[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.620]
246.

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.480]

Golden Retriever 131.

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.960]
I hate dogs.

[00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.700]
92 assholes out there said I hate dogs.

[00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.760]
This explains what we've been up against all these years.

[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.900]
92 people.

[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.880]
7.4% of this audience hate dogs.

[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.360]
And guess what?

[00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.080]
We hate you.

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.760]
How do you like that?

[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.720]
German Shepherd 72.

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:15.060]
Don't know.

[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.180]
Never had a dog 63.

[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.420]
Jack Russell Terrier 55.

[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.000]
It's a cult.

[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.840]
What?

[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.600]
No, it's a cult.

[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.380]
There's something strange there.

[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.620]
Something that doesn't meet the eye.

[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.180]
Boxer 52.

[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.040]
Beagle 37.

[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.900]
Rotweiler 31.

[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.160]
I don't want to read the whole list.

[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.440]
Do I?

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.080]

[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.700]
Long here.

[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.100]
Dogs.

[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.360]
All kinds of Collies.

[00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.840]

B. Sean Frise 15.

[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.880]
See, people like that kind of a dog.

[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:55.700]
They just like the name.

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.520]
What you think?

[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.520]
I'm surprised we didn't put you in the corner.

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.680]
What kind of dog is a Skippy over it?

[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.920]
Oh, he's a B. Sean Frise.

[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.500]
Wow.

[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.080]
God, am I impressed.

[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.800]
Yorkshire Terrier 15.

[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.180]

And Schrawa 9.

[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.520]
That's where I'm going to stop right there.

[00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.940]
Out of 1237 suggestions.

[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.240]
For which we thank you profusely.

[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.800]
Okay, the first hour every day now we're doing something a little new and different.

[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.660]
Don't have to discuss it.

[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.800]
You can if you like.

[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.980]
But we're doing a preliminary pool.

[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.100]
Part of the main pool of the day.

[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.200]
The pre-pull.

[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.280]
Yeah, this is a four-play pool.

[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.780]
And each day we're asking how do you rate a different

[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.020]
movie?

[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.060]
Now, yesterday we asked about, of course,

[00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:40.660]
Requiem for Dream.

[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.040]
Did pretty well.

[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.260]
Pretty well.

[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.960]
Disheartedly, please.

[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.140]
Grat.

[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.440]
Today we're asking how do you rate the movie Glenn Geary Glenn Ross.

[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.440]
Six choices.

[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:48.480]
Never saw it.

[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.200]
Do you think a lot of people saw this one?

[00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.560]
No.

[00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.720]
Really?

[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.200]
Really.

[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.340]
Why is that?

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.620]
Because it wasn't like a-

[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.180]
Great cast.

[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.380]
Right, but it didn't have all, you know, explosions.

[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.220]
It wasn't hyped.

[00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.060]
It wasn't promoted heavily in the theaters.

[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.680]
Great cast.

[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.300]
Al Pacino, Jack Lemon, Adheros, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Spacey, Alan R.

[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.920]
Alec Baldwin.

[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.320]
Right.

[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.100]
Morgan Freeman.

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.600]
Anyway, how do you rate Glenn Geary Glenn Ross?

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:16.380]
Never saw it.

[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.940]
Neal's right.

[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.460]
It's great.

[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.160]
Good.

[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.040]
Okay.

[00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.920]
Week or it sucks.

[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.980]
Those are the six choices.

[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:24.600]
And those, of course, will stay the same every day.

[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.740]
Now, last night I did-

[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.360]
Now, we had many suggestions yesterday.

[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.440]
I went out and I intended to buy them all, which would have been a little bit heavy on the pocketbook.

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.760]
Do you have one of those old lady carts with the wheels and the wire carts?

[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.860]
For what?

[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.980]
For like all these DVDs that you shut that to the apartment there?

[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.900]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.120]
They're pretty heavy, man.

[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.500]
And your groceries.

[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.480]
You're starting to sound like my mother now.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.920]
Oh, how do you slap all that soda?

[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.480]
Yes, what, my, by my soda convenience store.

[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.160]
Okay, right across the street, bitch.

[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.140]
God.

[00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:59.220]
How do you do that?

[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.100]
How do you operate without a car?

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.880]
How can you live without a car?

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.640]
See, I, this is at this stage of my life I'm discovering that,

[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.980]
I'm a tremendous number of people living in a big city.

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.080]
Don't have a car.

[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.420]
Yeah.

[00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.960]
That's one of the great things about living in a big real city, without the stars.

[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.320]

[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:16.100]
We have stars.

[00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:17.820]
No cars, just stars.

[00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.440]
Well, they really dropped the ball on this one.

[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:20.920]
I'll tell you that.

[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.480]
In fact, the WT and the WH, whatever it is.

[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.340]
Mayor Lassen says he don't know who they are.

[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.280]
They're thinking today about maybe putting Toronto back on the traveler advisory list.

[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.240]
Oh, oh, I don't know why.

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.140]
I mean, they got 62 cases or something like that, but it's still all in three hospitals.

[00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.480]
Are they going to let you back in the country?

[00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.200]
No.

[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.560]
And I'll say, oh, right.

[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:40.960]
Okay.

[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.360]
That's the way you want to play it.

[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:42.980]
Quarantine.

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.720]
Now, I did see, oh, yeah, I'm going to come back and breathe on George Corso.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.220]
The first thing I do when I come into building is I'm going to go into engineering.

[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.880]
And I'm going to just breathe and slobber all over the place.

[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.960]
In fact, every, every piece of equipment could only be an improvement.

[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.280]
And then I'm going to go into promotions.

[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.800]
Oh, by the way, speak at a promotions.

[00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:00.580]
Doreen.

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.480]
Doreen.

[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.860]
Feral don't need to see where we're going.

[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:03.460]
Okay, sweetheart.

[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.680]
I know you're trying to make an impression.

[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.520]
Well, then you say he's like six, five or something like that.

[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.100]
Carlethe, I didn't measure it.

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.860]
She assumes that because he's a big tall guy that he's probably hung like a moose.

[00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.180]
She just wants to look at it first is what I'm hearing.

[00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.840]
She wants to take a peek.

[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.920]
But boy, you talk about screwing up before I get to the two movies I watched last night.

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:27.800]
Screwing up everything.

[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.120]
I have two suggestions which they'll never listen to me.

[00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:33.620]
They'd pay no attention to me in that place because what the hell do I know?

[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.420]
Two suggestions that could improve WQA.

[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.620]
I'm dramatically now this moment.

[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.960]
Number one, ban all Marlins talk outside of the games in a pregame itself.

[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.380]
From which we're contractually obligated for that crap.

[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.700]
Other than that, ban it.

[00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.200]
And certainly don't be given away any tickets to Marlin games.

[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.040]
Nobody wants them.

[00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.200]
George said that last week at Treasure Island they went out there with a bunch of Marlin tickets to the boy.

[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.420]
And that way, nobody won them.

[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.180]
There were people bringing their Marlin tickets to the game trying to give them to them.

[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.500]
Yeah, kill it.

[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.220]
That's number one.

[00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.080]
And number two, what was number two?

[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.520]
Oh, yeah.

[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.000]
Number two is don't let Pharrell discuss sports.

[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:19.940]
Do you see what I'm saying?

[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.380]
Well, you're speaking to the choir.

[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.880]
No, I'm serious.

[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.840]
If he talked about anything in the world, about getting laid about the designers,

[00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.320]
you name it.

[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:29.400]
Bobblehead packages.

[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.280]
Let's get out of here.

[00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:34.380]
Yeah, see, speaking of Bobbleheads, the giveaway Bobbleheads at the stadium over the weekend,

[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.880]
they finally got a couple of reasonable crowds because they gave some free crap away.

[00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:39.300]
Oh, yeah, you're wrong.

[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.300]
It's the same neurotic stuff year after year after year.

[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.760]
This radio station because there's nothing going on.

[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.720]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:49.760]
If I was doing a sports show, all I'd be talking about now is Brian Greasy.

[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.260]
Wouldn't you, Boehner, boy?

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:52.240]
Absolutely.

[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.720]
That's the big story.

[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.880]
I mean, granted it's only a June and its football still aways away.

[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.340]
But that's the main topic of conversation in town anyway when it comes to sports as football.

[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.320]
And a Brian Greasy story is gigantic.

[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.900]
And she's in there peddling him Marlin tickets to give away?

[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.020]
Get away, Doreen.

[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.600]
Okay, get away from that man.

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.300]
We finally got a chance.

[00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.200]
We finally got a contender when he was a leading.

[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.840]
And you're going to screw him all up in a bunch of stupid ass Marlin tickets to give away.

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.820]
That nobody wants.

[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.560]
And then what do I hear the first two or three calls?

[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.100]
Oh, I'll take the free tickets.

[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.660]
No more Marlin discussions on this radio station ever.

[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.480]
That would do it.

[00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:32.300]
I'll never happen.

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.180]
Would improve the ratings of this radio station by at least a full point.

[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.500]
And number two, for real, no sports.

[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.020]
Just crap.

[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.760]
Just have him talk and crap two hours.

[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.300]
He is one of the great crap both discussed in the history of the business.

[00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:47.540]
Nobody costs crap like he does.

[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.800]
But it's Greg Reads and Erosis again.

[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.440]
That's what we're on to the penalty of.

[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.360]
It's Greg Reads and Erosis.

[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.440]
So I watched two of the movies on your list yesterday.

[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.180]
I bought six.

[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.540]
Let me tell you the four that I didn't watch yet.

[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.580]
Which I've already seen one.

[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.300]
Oh, man, these are heavy, you know what?

[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:07.080]
Yeah.

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.480]
Way of the gun with Ryan Philippe.

[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.380]
I haven't watched that yet.

[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.580]
Got it in my hand now.

[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.480]
Got Ryan's gun in my hand.

[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.000]
Shallow grave.

[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.700]
Magnolia.

[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.760]
Which this must be a real project.

[00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:21.180]
This one.

[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.720]
It's one of these big fancy like Memento was, you know.

[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:26.720]
The packaging alone is spectacular.

[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:27.740]
Any frog in there?

[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:28.500]
Frogs.

[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.800]
There are a couple of frogs jumped out of the package.

[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.900]
And training day, which I already saw with Morgan Freeman.

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.180]
I mean, I didn't see a Washington.

[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.780]
No, I see I'd put it before the show and I'll admit it.

[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:43.800]
This is one of my worst things that I just can't do with actors, actresses, names of movies.

[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.600]
It's just something I'm not good at.

[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.600]
I'm terrible at it.

[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:47.600]
That's not like hardest drivers.

[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.940]
No, that's just, see if I could clear out some room.

[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.520]
Now see, this is a guy who does no delinco from Del Mangi.

[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.400]
He don't know Keith Wapel from Randy Wapel.

[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.340]
That's your problem.

[00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.440]
I know all of these things.

[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.120]
I'm so you only have, it's like hard drive space.

[00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.600]
And your brain.

[00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:05.360]
I only have so much space on here.

[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.580]
I got to clear some out.

[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.880]
I can't do it.

[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.860]
I need a lobotomy.

[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.960]
So when it comes not that I'm all movie intensive and all whipped up.

[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:14.560]
And I'm very enthusiastic about this.

[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:15.880]
I watched two pretty good movies last night.

[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.260]
One was great, which I'll get to momentarily after we do the break.

[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.800]
Because we got so much business today.

[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.660]
Somebody better have it invested.

[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.760]
Somebody better give our sales department the Glen Gary Glen Ross leads.

[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.300]
Or maybe get some real sales people back there.

[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.080]
Maybe that's the answer.

[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:30.540]
Right.

[00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.300]
Alec Baldwin needs to come in and give him a pop-up.

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.240]
Yeah, we need to have a seminar with Alec Baldwin leading away.

[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:35.540]
Okay.

[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:37.100]
Tom, the Fisher cut bait.

[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:38.160]
Close.

[00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.980]
You're always got to be closing.

[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.100]
As in.

[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.480]
Close the door on your way out behind you.

[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.300]
That's what I would say to most of our so-called salespeople.

[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.360]
Close the goddamn door on your way out.

[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.220]
And don't turn around and come back.

[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.240]
Boy, it used to be bad, but now.

[00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.080]
Now that we got no more John penis.

[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.220]
Stop and think about some of the marginally decent sales people we used to have there long gone.

[00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:00.780]
Right.

[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.300]
Can you think of any besides John penis lion?

[00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:04.180]
Brian.

[00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:04.620]
Brian.

[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:05.060]
There you go.

[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.740]
Good old Brian.

[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.520]
What's his name?

[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.800]
Brian Morgan Freeman.

[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:11.060]
Brian Schmutz.

[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.100]
He was good.

[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:13.700]
So a lot of spots on this show.

[00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.080]
But what do we got now?

[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.500]
Now we got Skippy.

[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.420]
And now we got people whose names we don't even know.

[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:24.220]
And we got Fatboy who spends most of his time in a hospital being carted around and

[00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.160]
schlepping up and down the hall on his walker.

[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.180]
We have Jackamo, who lectures Carlos.

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:30.060]
Who is, oh yeah.

[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.960]
We got that guy.

[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.740]
I missed their know it all.

[00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.800]
Which we don't even know what his name is and don't want to know it.

[00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.840]
He says Carlos is a liar.

[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.060]
Yeah, right.

[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.180]
10, 14 at 5, 60 WQM.

[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.020]
By the way, Josh Sharedaro did not get.

[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.120]
Did not get Beaner Boy paid on time.

[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.660]
He's not going to get paid on the 10th.

[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.440]
Nice going clearance.

[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:50.960]
Also didn't get us any answers about this spot thing we got going.

[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.200]
Here's a question for you.

[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.600]
How low can they go?

[00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.460]
We're talking about rates.

[00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:55.860]
Of course.

[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.320]
Now a financial group has the limbo under the lowest refinance rate going.

[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.440]
They're doing the limbo rock.

[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.440]
How low we're talking 1.95%.

[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:03.920]
That's true.

[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:09.420]
Now you can refinance your home or buy a new home and get a super low amazing almost unheard of.

[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.620]
1.95% financing with financial group.

[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.500]
Call 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.500]
That's 1-800-940-L-E-N-D.

[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.440]
If you're even thinking about refinancing or buying real estate, call financial group and you talk about savings.

[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.300]
Check this out.

[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.060]

Minto but anyway, we'll do that tomorrow

[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:51.880]
And I have no idea cuz nobody's

[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.060]
No, there's some people it's all like the first five minutes of it. Oh, yeah

[00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:59.840]
Forgot sorry. Here's Miami Lakes. Hello

[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:04.840]
Hello, yes, sir. Hey, how are you Neil great? Hey, where are the good leads?

[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.940]
So let me tell you something

[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:15.000]
My daddy Glen Ross is on my list of one of the best movies I've ever seen. Yeah, it's great

[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:21.220]
And I've been selling for 28 years Neil and I'll tell you something it really really grabs you

[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.140]
But the thing I want to talk to you about the movie is this film legend called Jack O'Lemm

[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:33.960]
I know that he's an American icon and I don't think he's ever used a swear word and any other movie that he's ever made

[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.940]
Well, if you count up the time you use it um in in Glen Gary Glen Ross

[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:48.600]
Yeah, it's just amazing if you just use the F word at least 50 times and there's a scene where he goes off on Kevin space

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.240]
Right a little jerk that's he's making up for lost time now Jack lemon

[00:19:53.240 --> 00:20:00.140]
He was that's the greatest seed in the movie where he goes off on Kevin spacey and he just rips

[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:00.500]
Well

[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:09.140]
It's one of my favorite movies and I recommend it strongly to everybody excellent choice. Hey, thanks for thanks lot

[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.160]
Thanks, palmy so I can't watch too low. I beg your pardon

[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.120]
MEM ENTO a reminder of the past a keepsake Carlos hit it

[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:22.080]
Because we were discussing it. You're thinking of are you serious Carlos?

[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:29.480]
Figured it out. You're thinking of momentum as an unmomento seat because you think in Spanish. No, I don't get down here too long

[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:37.160]
No, seriously all of my life and I and probably the reason being I never saw the word in print before right you know what it's like

[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:43.320]
It's like when I was reading that article about the pot and I came to hookah and I said hookah

[00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.560]
Because I've never I get I've hookah no no seriously

[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:51.560]
I've never seen that word in print before in my life until that article water pipe sir

[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:59.060]
There you go. No, no, seriously. I had never seen hookah in print. Have you yeah, listen wonderland? Oh

[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.960]
Please you read out some wonderland you read it. What do you mean they made it? Well, I've probably read it too

[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.200]
But it was about a hundred years ago hookah smoking counter forgot right in my elbow front and center

[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.340]
So at any rate so that word I had screwed up and then of course we get to this in my whole life

[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.540]
I don't think I've ever seen the word I thought a keepsake is of a momentum with an mo

[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:22.420]
But you're right momentum you didn't sound right too many years in South Florida. Oh my god

[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:28.280]
I think my brains have been fried how embarrassing you're being spiky side not even 10 30 and I'm already learned something like that

[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.560]
I'm dumb of course look where I work look where I work with

[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.920]
So I watched two movies last night and speaking of the general topic

[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:42.760]
I will say this could have been very intensive on this for like almost a month now the main pull of the day will be an opportunity for you to get out of your system

[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.700]
About all these shows about movies. Okay, I mean we do talk about a few other things like dogs

[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.800]
And like about the a fashion government things like that

[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.940]
But we've just become movie intensive. I don't know and it seems to people seem to like it, but we'll find out

[00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:01.280]
I watched two movies last night one pretty good not great and the other one excellent

[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:06.360]
I don't want George to get carried away. No, sorry. I just liked it better than the other one. There were two months

[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.340]
No, I didn't agree with not at all. I liked it better the river runs through. I thought was much better than legends of the fall

[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.680]
But that's a matter of taste. Legends of the fall was was worth watching Anthony Hopkins

[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.640]
Was good until he had that little problem

[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:24.220]
And although he didn't have a beautiful main coat. I love this main coat

[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:25.800]
but

[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:30.760]
And Brad Pitt was good and there he could have used the haircut every once in a great while would have been good

[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.600]
And maybe a bath might not have hurt while he went safari and you know, it was a part of the look

[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.560]
But now it was good. I give it three stars on a scale of five that would be my own personal rating legends of the fall

[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.280]
It's worth seeing if you like Brad Pitt

[00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:44.920]
If you like Anthony Hopkins, he was excellent. Aiden Quinn

[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:49.000]
The Aiden Quinn was good and also even now. What's the name the other brother Henry Thomas?

[00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.640]
There you go and what's your name?

[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:57.360]
Oh, I forget Julianna Margaleez or something. I'm not sure who I forget Julianna Margaleez maybe

[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:01.860]
It was a lot of the one I thought I don't have time to find it anyway

[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.500]
You know if you're one of those people like I said who likes and George likes it

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.920]
He won't admit it the reason that he likes that and the river runs through it is because it's a Montana move no question

[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.420]
That that he's obsessed with Montana because when he was in Montana

[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.400]
He got laid like every hour right? So that's that's why he's obsessed with it

[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.880]
If you're not into like the Dakotas in Montana and it was Dakota

[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.920]
There were times in the movie well when we found that map that is father made

[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:29.400]
Don't you remember that book you are and it was the big map of the Dakotas in Montana freaking

[00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.440]
But there were times during the movie when I felt like I was watching

[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:34.940]
Bonanza

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.460]
Or a little house on the prairie or maybe like a combination of both Julia or mand thank you Carlos

[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:44.720]
You know what I'm saying? Yes, it was a little bit a little house on the prairie ish at times

[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.580]
Yeah, but you didn't think the river runs through it was like that

[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.860]
Without the grizzly bear yeah, but a river runs through it. There was just something about the uh, I don't know

[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.820]
About the whole story and about the fly fishing and red pits fly I don't know

[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.900]
But the movie I watched last night that I liked a lot which I give four and a half stars

[00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:06.580]
drugstore cowboy with Matt Dylan and Kelly Lynch and

[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.580]
Heather Graham right

[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.200]
Center hat

[00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.760]
Back keep the hat off the bed, huh? Oh, oh, really dammit

[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:18.880]
Well, I tell you first the hat was on a bed and then she was on the flow. Yeah next thing, you know

[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.120]
She's on the flow he won

[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.700]
She's he look kind of like purple on the on the floor

[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:29.580]
But in any way drugstore cowboy is very good Matt Dylan for whom I had the minimal regard except for a couple of movies

[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:34.860]
Always thought he was like I don't know very predictable always doing his Marlon Brando junior routine

[00:24:34.860 --> 00:24:39.880]
But he was excellent in this movie did a great acting job everybody was good in and what's not to like

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:44.020]
It was a little bit like some of the scene because it was related with drugs

[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.520]
People had a little bit of a little bit of a drug problem

[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:55.300]
And there were some scenes there were reminiscent of um of this I like the piece best

[00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.120]
The priest was good the a drug addict priest and I also liked the fact that Matt Dylan said oh yeah

[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.320]
I knew a father or two whatever his name was a year's or I was an alter boy. He always had the good stuff

[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:08.740]
And you remember when he crossed himself after he buried that bitch

[00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.560]
I don't want to say which one because that'd be a giveaway

[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.080]
But he crossed himself very quickly, but you know still programmed for Sahabat

[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.700]
Kind like when he walked in the priest's apartment there and like whipped it out. Can't force a habit

[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:27.040]
28 past 10 at 560 WQM if you're carpeting is schmootsy if it looks like the end of the universe if it looks like

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.820]
The heavens just unleashed garbage on your carpet do yourself a favor and call dry concepts

[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:35.440]
I've been telling you people about this for over 20 years

[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.640]
I've been using them in my home for well over 20 years now because they're the best

[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.160]
They're the only people in the world who dry clean your carpeting

[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.820]
That's exactly what they do. It's the same kind of method they've used to drag clean your clothing

[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.460]
Which sucks out the deep-down dirt way down in there that you can't see

[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.120]
We certainly can smell it if you leave it around long enough

[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.380]
And they also do a stupidest job of drag cleaning your drapes your expensive area rugs your oriental carpeting

[00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.800]
And of course also your leather furniture your pulse or whatever it is

[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.420]
If you have problem with pet odors picking a dogs and pets or milder voters

[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.060]
They can because by water damage they can make those disappear in a hurry too

[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.120]
And one thing you never have to worry about with dry concepts is whether they're going to rip you off

[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.780]
Because not only they give you a fair price

[00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.540]
But they give it to you up front in writing before they start the job. How can you beat that?

[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.760]
So do yourself a big favor call the professionals that drag concepts you'll be pleased is punch

[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.780]
Proppo DJ Valentine says Memento is long for Mimo

[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.020]
He had Mimo's all over his body. Yes, he did

[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:25.940]
But let me just say this to you which you'll find most bizarre

[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.360]
Because I am positive that I've seen the word Memento spelled M-O

[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.200]
Now how do we get into a spelling thing? I'll not just point out

[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.360]
So I go to the Miriam Webster Schwartz Dictionary online

[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.660]
and I type in Memento and

[00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:50.700]
It's like an alternate spelling for it can be spelled either way I guess and when you look for Memento

[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.540]
One of the searches comes to Memento the movie

[00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:56.980]
If it spells it both ways

[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.200]
I'm sure I'm looking at it right now and if you click Memento the movie

[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:02.800]
you get

[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.380]
A review by the movie pundit. I got momentous when I tried to put in Memento

[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.840]
now and then here Memento Memento movie spelled with an M-O

[00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:17.520]
And it says Memento by then but they spell it the way it's spelled in the movie with an E

[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:21.780]
One of the most one of the strangest most frustrating films I've ever seen in a long time

[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.620]
Imagine a roller coaster mixed with murder mystery and you'll understand half of what the film is

[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.460]
But I warn you this one will make your head hurt. That's a good review. I like that. Yeah

[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.880]
That's uh, so how do you like that?

[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.940]
So I take back what I said I wasn't wrong. I was like uh not fast and not slow. I was half-assed

[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.240]
I was like gonna be twisting between between a crock and a hard place, huh

[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.260]
Is that bizarre or what?

[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:50.280]
As I know I have seen it in writing, but I've always seen it a Memento is M-O-M-E-N-T-L

[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.500]
You've seen it. I see it all the time, but it's always like they're using Spanish slang like Un Memento

[00:29:55.500 --> 00:30:00.060]
No, that's not what it's in regard to. No, no, no. A Memento isn't a keepsake

[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.080]
Has been something from the past something a uh reminder of the past

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.620]
Got it got it. So anyway, we got that'll be tomorrow moment

[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.300]
But in the meantime Glen Gary Glen Hill Glen Ross very encouraging is uh

[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.840]
The law that are new thought you said nobody's seen a 135 votes. No. Yeah. How do you rate it?

[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.360]
I try to talk in about it through invocation shows and like uh, you know here

[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:24.100]
Yeah, but who listens when you're on. Oh, that's right

[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.660]
Anyway, never saw it 65 48.1%

[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:34.000]
Neal's right. It's great 50 37% and how much did the Sarah half Sarah go for?

[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.440]
23% see

[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:42.440]
So they like this a lot better. Well, that's because over the years they've heard us talk so much about sales people and what assholes

[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.540]
They are sales people are iceholes and so they like can't just bug up the rest plus of course we have a lot of sales holes out there

[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:54.220]
Talk job man talk job if you don't believe me watch the movie Glen Gary Glen Ross you'll be wanting to get those leads

[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:01.840]
Please please give them to our sales department when you're done with them when you've gone uh when you've cherry picked them

[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:08.080]
Give what you got left to our sales department. I can't hurt go steal some they couldn't sell a glass of water to a starving a Jewish millionaire

[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.040]
For a dot for a penny

[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:15.240]
Never saw it 65 meals right. It's great 50 it sucks 10

[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.700]
Good 8 okay one and weak none so

[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:26.680]
Negatory only 10 only 10 out of 135 or as opposed to what's your name Sarah? It sucks seven point seven

[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.040]
Yeah

[00:31:27.540 --> 00:31:32.840]
Same thing see we've always got around seven percent they're gonna say no matter what will be we put on her it sucks

[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:37.640]
Okay, and probably because they would like to suck but they can't find anything to suck on that's probably

[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:42.400]
No matter what movie no matter what issue just right it's the same like with all our political issues

[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:48.860]
We have about 18 percent that will always suck bushes ass whether it's Jeb Bush George W. George senior

[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:55.400]
Prescott Bush whichever fascist we're talking about George P by the way isn't that interesting how our governor is trying to use that

[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:56.780]
Feet is a political football

[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:02.480]
He wants to appoint a port appointed guardian for a fetus. I can get messy. Oh

[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:08.800]
Atta boy jab you the best baby. How how could anybody vote for that man? How could there's a picture in the Toronto

[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:13.600]
And the national post to him this morning. Yeah, where they talk about what an asshole he is

[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.480]
I know how to get both for him you just look at that picture and you say to me

[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:21.940]
Well probably because you were a ran against another dead band Bill McBride who exactly

[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.800]
Democrats have a death wish that's what the D stands for a Democrat death wish

[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.700]

And she says to me. How what do you think you're going back to 10 to 2 and I said oh right? Yeah

[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.320]
I stopped it. I thought that man did you only wanted to work one to three and all that kind of stuff

[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.160]
So they had to be a lot of things put in a row there. He's on two to four. What's wrong with that?

[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:36.260]
It still sounds like two hours to me. I mean what's right? I know I just thought he wanted to work one to three

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.840]
But the deal was of course they're trying they're trying to blow out the morning guy there

[00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:44.980]

[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:46.840]
Wow

[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.960]
What the hell remember that that we had do the Haka and get a blowjob or something like that? We

[00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.500]
So we're still discussing how you spell

[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.720]
Memento Memento at the make a difference how you spell it you really should see the movie and I know most of you

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.280]
I don't think most of the people in this audience are emotionally stable enough to watch that movie and come away

[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.840]
without going but no one would like for a long time maybe if they watched it in reverse

[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:12.700]
Speaking of dogs which were yesterday I wanted to dwell on it because it's a boring topic

[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:14.100]
I used to a lot of people but

[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:20.640]
Alert dogs saves two men another dog from fiery death and wilted manners in this morning sun sentinolo less just like a cat would

[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.240]
Just like your pet jirbal would

[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:30.420]
An alert dog saved its sleeping master's life early Monday morning by awakening him just as fire erupted in the back of the home

[00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.220]
Firefighters in wilton manners said

[00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:39.040]
The dog a six-year-old female air-dale terrier. We didn't have any air-dale terriers on our legio named hunter

[00:35:39.780 --> 00:35:47.580]
Escape from the burning three bedroom one bathhouse and a 14-liter block of northeast 27th street along with its owner another occupant and another air-dale name chance

[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.500]
As in fat

[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:53.460]
Chance like Josh Friedman. You think he's coming back fat chance

[00:35:54.020 --> 00:36:00.440]
The residents Paul Kinser and Scott Moore lost everything else saved the clothes on their back a cell phone dogs and the vehicles to the blaze

[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.740]
Which was believed caused by electrical problem

[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.940]
Last Friday the home's owner smelled smoke in the floater room area next to the garage toward the rear of the house

[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.000]
He checked and found nothing the owner told firefighters he had recurring problems with the electricity

[00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:18.280]
Electrician had come but couldn't find anything wrong Saturday the owner bought two smoke detectors with the intention mounting him over the weekend

[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.920]
But the problem disappeared again the senses were not installed. I don't think they're allowed to mount him in the wilton manners

[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.540]
Only from the rear

[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.960]
Early Monday morning found the dog hunter sleeping in a separate room. I'll chance slept in the master bedroom around

[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.580]
5 a.m. and agitated 100 in the bedroom began scratching at the bed and

[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:40.440]
Pointing the owner until he got out of bed. That's when the owner spotted flames at the end of the hallway next to the garage. How do you like that?

[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:46.260]
The dog came in here was barking and scratching and carrying on and yelled out

[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:50.340]
FAMING and that's so what come to sprung him to action

[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.480]
It's a nice goon. There's another great job. My dogs are best friend. They're great. You love dogs and you 92 assholes

[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.320]
They said you hate dogs

[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.400]
Okay, that's for you. There's another one or extra charge

[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.200]
Stand people that don't like dogs

[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.440]
Of course a lot of those 92 people probably have never been around like real dogs

[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.040]
Probably an exposed to those nasty little yippy biting designer dogs, you know

[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.220]
Ten for I didn't affect many of the names that we had on the list yesterday were like designer dogs

[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.660]
That's not I like a real dog

[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:22.540]
Right

[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:24.600]
Not a designer dog

[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.400]
1041 at 560 wq.way. And let me tell you about dollar mattresses

[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:33.020]
We've been for doing on the show for a long time a lot of people wonder you talk about it

[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:37.240]
Do you really sleep on a mattress from dollar mattress and the answer is very simply yes

[00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.120]
And the reason being you won't get a better deal anywhere on a plan you won't find better merchandise

[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:45.040]
And you won't find a company more dedicated to customer service than dollar mattress

[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.140]
They're ranked number one in the world of customer satisfaction even down under

[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:52.820]
One quick call to 1 800 mattress and you won't believe how easy it is to pick out the perfect bed for you

[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.260]
Depending on the way you sleep like upside down vertical horizontal etc

[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:59.000]
The expert vending consultants guide you through the whole process

reasonable at pizza love it's not like a real expensive deal here's a fact from

[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:06.380]
Scott and Hollywood as it just heard you bitching about the bush clan would

[00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.920]
like to point out something I discovered the other day sometime within the

[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.480]
past year under the direction of our wonderful governor Bush it became less than

[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.420]
mandatory for businesses to care worker carry a workers compensation insurance

[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.580]
workers comp is no longer mandatory I thought this was something disgusting I

[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:24.140]
should share love the show thanks for coming back to him to Scott and Hollywood

[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:31.080]
thank Scott also says don't tell George oh what the hell tell George anyway

[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.980]
legends of the fall was not filmed in Montana but mostly oh can today sorry

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:42.800]
George Calgary right morally Vancouver and Ocho Rios Jamaica beautiful

[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:46.760]
country very similar looking Ocho Rios Jamaica's when he was got on the ships

[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.620]
and was traveling I guess when he was supposed to be a new guinea isn't that

[00:42:50.620 --> 00:42:55.720]
where he's supposed to be careful I don't don't say guinea but didn't they talk

[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:59.620]
about when they went off to join the army that we're going to Calgary right

[00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:05.100]
remember that well that's another one of those deals we got cheap labor that's

[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.100]
back when the Canadian dollar wasn't worth crap it's not all that great it's

[00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:13.060]
about 73 cent American dollar and the amazing part of his and spread all this

[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:16.620]
IBM investigation and all this perhaps another one of these scandals coming up

[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.600]
look at that the dows up one point now he's back up three and a half point

[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:23.740]
there's something going on it doesn't quite meet the eye all right not that I'm

[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.220]
suspicious maybe the reason Glenn Gary Glenn Ross is doing so much better is

[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.760]
because it seems to have a lot less votes I don't think I recall is I

[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:37.820]
recall yesterday the final total at about five after eleven right was about

[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.840]
three oh three three hundred in fact I'm gonna write that I'm gonna keep these

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.720]
three hundred and three for Requiem for a dream also I think it's a little

[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.880]
bit older it's been out there longer more people had a chance to see it

[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.440]
Glenn Gary Glenn Ross so far has got away 194 so it's 1051 or in the

[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:56.020]
Chinaman's Chancin Hill that it's gonna get anywhere near 300 votes by the time

[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.260]
we get done so maybe that they just don't give a crap about that movie as much

[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.500]
or maybe they're already burned out on this or maybe they're busy you know or

[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.860]
maybe they're writing reminder notes all over their body don't forget to vote

[00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.300]
on Neil's poll something like that anyway how do you write the movie Glenn

[00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:17.600]
Gary Glenn Ross never saw 96 49.4 percent which means at least at least

[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.440]
of these first couple hundred more little more than half have seen it got it

[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:29.000]
that's good Neil's right it's great 68 35 percent pretty hefty total good 14

[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:35.580]
it sucks only 11 5.6 percent okay four and weak zero out of the first hundred

[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:40.440]

dark storm cloud is looming over the future of the American media he says I'll

just read the first paragraph he says this is a sad day for me and I think for

[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.760]
the country I'm afraid a dark storm cloud is now looming over the future of

[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.800]
the American media this is the most sweeping and destructive rollback of

[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:44.900]
consumer protection rules in the history of American broadcasting and he is

[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:50.200]

about a half a dozen there's another page don't fax it I didn't uh they're all Canadian a so

[00:55:51.880 --> 00:56:02.280]
only Canadian cats can save lives Christmas 1968 Wyrton Ontario early Christmas morning jigs I

[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:06.800]
wonder if that's jigs McDonald a young sign means cat owned by mr. and Mrs. McGregor

[00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.760]
proved himself a hero jigs roused the sleeping family when fire broke out although one resident

[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.220]
did die in the fire mr. Mrs. McGregor there two young sons and a grandmother escaped the flames

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:21.500]
jigs had collapsed and the apartment had to be taken outside and revived here's a Ali

[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:28.420]
red tabby in waterloo ontario learned his owner to a fire that started from a crack in the

[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:33.520]
family's fireplace responding to Ali's persistent cries mr. Rosie awoke to find the living

[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:39.180]
in dining was filled with smoke and it goes on and on high sea it all has to do with the cats

[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:43.340]
screaming because they're in pain or choking on smoke and wakes up the owner that's not what the

[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:51.180]
story is is probably is true though Anita says the best video store around is video tape town 49

[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:55.860]
80 wasted land full of heart in margate the owner's name is Liz by the way is probably good friends

[00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:59.940]
with Anita but that's good because weren't you would desperately need of a good video store

[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:04.680]
yes I was see I'm really concerned about when I come back to town which I'm not going to be

[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.700]
there very long but when I come back like in a wintertime for a longer period of time were

[00:57:08.700 --> 00:57:13.940]
am I going to buy my videos my TV news because I'm sure not going to go to blockbuster and get that

[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:19.080]
censored crap that watered down bull crap well at one place I forget the name of in the awkward plaza

[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:23.200]
had a very good selection it just to know happened that somebody had bought happiness ahead of me

[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:27.200]
because we were talking about it yeah otherwise they would have had it they had it when I call

[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.160]
what kind of a place is it I mean I already know what kind of a place it is but what kind of a

[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:36.420]
town that you live in when you don't have big gigantic I'm not talking blackbuster either chain

[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.360]
stores like hmv or even sams which isn't a chain here anymore but that have zillions and zillions

[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:50.900]
of DVDs uncensored right huh it's never heard of buying censored material what kind of crap is that

[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:55.660]
sounds like something out of god damn Nazi Germany to me oh that's right I forgot it's south of the

[00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:00.660]

wrap up of our poll for today see only 267 not even close to the 303 we had for a serious today

[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:27.780]
water pipe sir uh how do you rate and very glen Ross never saw it 132 49.4% so just over half of

[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:34.300]
the audience at least the ones who voted have seen it kneels right it's great 83 31% that's good

[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:44.720]
good 21 7 28 it sucks 20 7.4% say there's that same much of chronic and antagonists whatever you say

[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:49.760]
if you say it's Tuesday will tell you it's Thursday if you say it's raining we'll say it's sunny

[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:57.220]
if you say mo is an asshole we'll say you're right let's see it sucks 20 okay 7 and week 3

[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:07.280]
out of 267 okay here's our main poll for today where is it ready kneel shows on movies are are I see

[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:11.960]
yeah because probably there are people out here saying when you're gonna cut this crap already

[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:16.360]
huh when you're gonna stop when you're gonna stop being so movie intensive probably the answer

[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.100]
would be when I feel like it that probably would be my answer but we'll see kneel shows on movies

[01:00:21.660 --> 01:00:29.600]
great a breath of fresh air good okay okay getting boring or ponderous effing ponderous I think

[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:37.820]
that's uh five pretty good choices there yeah covers the gamut 12 and it's passed 11 at 560 wqa m

[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.340]
and it's Friday

[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.020]
hocker and hocker is burning it through my roll

[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:06.060]
push push push push why we said bye got me up in my eye

[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.620]
if it plays this baby I don't know which way to go

[01:01:12.730 --> 01:01:12.850]
oh

[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:12.850]

[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:17.950]
things like

[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:24.730]
let's say

[01:01:43.210 --> 01:01:49.150]
1115 at 560 WQYM. Let's see Glenn Gary Glenn Ross was excellent says this fact speaking of Jack lemon

[01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:53.670]
His performance in the days of line and roses was one terrific dramatic performance you guys ever see it

[01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:56.410]
Nope says rich evil

[01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:59.750]
Now that you mentioned I don't think I ever did see it

[01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:07.050]
In fact, I forgot to remind myself with the momentum on my arm if I did see it. I don't think so that works pretty good

[01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:11.230]
Okay, here's the final tally now. Let's see she had 303 Sarah

[01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:15.010]
I'm afraid that the Glenn Gary ain't gonna get no 303

[01:02:16.610 --> 01:02:20.410]
That's not bad. How do you rate the movie Glenn Gary Glenn Ross never saw 144

[01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:26.010]
Niels write it's great 88 it sucks 24 good 22

[01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:34.090]
Okay, nine and week three so the negative. Well, let's see you what negative 24 and three 27 out of 2 91 not too bad less than 10 percent

[01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:36.550]
They liked it. You really ought to go see it

[01:02:37.930 --> 01:02:43.030]
Go to the movie theater and see it. They're not showing it right now, but just how I put this on is that whatever crap you're showing now

[01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:45.310]
Give me the Glenn Gary our Glenn Ross leads

[01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:51.790]
And it's a pretty interesting twist there in the end too just when you think you know what it was all about

[01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:59.130]
We're gonna which is good yet is good Martha Stewart not doing too good. Thank goodness Martha Stewart faces possible criminal charges

[01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:04.690]
Her company said today in the insider trading scandal. It's taken her images a simple of tasteful living all right

[01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:10.070]
Stewart's lawyers are told a company. She's the target of a criminal investigation by US attorneys in Manhattan

[01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:14.790]
Which intends to request the grand jury to return an indictment against during the near future

[01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:18.650]
And let me say it again. All right. Put that bitch in jail. Okay

[01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:22.090]
She couldn't cook a tomato soup cake to save her life

[01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:28.450]
Okay, we can get the new pull up there anytime that Erica feels like it. Okay. I just mentioned that in passing

[01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:31.370]
We can get it up

[01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:37.690]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:42.670]
Glenn Gary Glenn Ross had to take all of our sales department put them in chairs tie in time into the chair

[01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.910]
Put toothpicks in her eyelids like in a clockwork orange and forced them to watch that movie

[01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.810]
Because they just can't get the job done there. I don't know what's going on in that place. There's just something really strange

[01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:57.970]
I didn't hear that Llan has that same prop that Alec Baldwin carries around in his briefcase

[01:03:57.970 --> 01:04:03.870]
Does she read that visual aid the big black one? Yeah, the brass uh the one there to come

[01:04:05.610 --> 01:04:07.150]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello

[01:04:08.810 --> 01:04:13.970]
Hello, yes sir Neil George. How you doing? Okay? All three movies and uh

[01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:19.730]
Glenn Garrett. I've had a lot of actors and it was I thought that was really good. You know, they all kind of champs

[01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:21.210]
um, you know

[01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:23.870]
Keep have a good performance there and

[01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:28.170]
Require him over dream that was that was great, but man, I was disturbing

[01:04:29.530 --> 01:04:30.490]
10 yeah

[01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:33.990]
Bridges about now the wall right now

[01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:41.070]
The metal is probably my favorite um on the y but it just you have to watch it from the beginning, but

[01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.930]
It's probably better the second time I watched it

[01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:47.430]
You think I don't know if I could watch it the second time

[01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:50.050]
Worth it. I need to

[01:04:50.050 --> 01:04:54.290]
Is it yeah, it plays backwards so you know, I don't know what's going on

[01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:57.570]
Yeah, that's true. You're I'm sending it to the very end and even then you're not quite sure

[01:04:57.570 --> 01:05:01.230]
But you're right if you watch it the second time you get a better insight as to where they're going or where they've been

[01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.990]
Yeah, I probably watch it

[01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:08.350]
What will tell it was I always recommend that one, but I watch record of it during the other night. Whoa

[01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:11.770]
That have me plastered to the to the seat there

[01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:16.290]
Okay, well, I'm glad you liked it pali

[01:05:16.290 --> 01:05:17.770]
Okay, have a great day

[01:05:17.770 --> 01:05:19.910]
Why he sounds like he took maybe too many of the purple ones

[01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:22.510]
Huh? Just think that's it

[01:05:24.810 --> 01:05:26.450]
And here I thought the town is dry

[01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:36.830]
What do you know you need to go see David apparently Matt Dylan's old buddy David nah, he's a loose cannon loose cannon

[01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:39.150]
Don't do it David. Oh, jeez

[01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:46.910]
Yeah, Dresstor cowboy is good, but just when you think see it was it was getting toward the end there a little bit too good to be true

[01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:47.230]
I know

[01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:50.370]
Although I did like the way he operated that drill press

[01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:58.950]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 when she says what kind of a job what do you do? He says I make holes. That was cute. I make holes

[01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:05.550]
She was a loser man if ever there was one see women on drugs to me

[01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:10.530]
I mean they might may not kill as many people, but women on drugs are a lot more devious and dangerous than men on drugs

[01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:13.070]
We'll ever dream of being yeah, but it's a good thing they take them

[01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:19.670]
Mia well, I can your household course no other places here's sunrise hello

[01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:22.590]
Sunrise

[01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:31.750]
Yes, Richard Roma. Yeah, my name is Richard Roma

[01:06:33.730 --> 01:06:36.170]
You just cost me $6,000

[01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:38.810]
$6,000

[01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:43.510]
What are you gonna do about it?

[01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:48.550]
Well, and for me I better clip it before

[01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:52.690]
Fom or something what are you gonna do? There's a lot of those in that movie even Jack lemon like the guy said

[01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:53.450]
Here's a lot of them around

[01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:59.410]
I think what I'm gonna have to do is I'm gonna have to give me a second because I don't want to keep you slacking back and forth another DVD player

[01:07:01.210 --> 01:07:04.870]
The stick in here and hook him through my little TV. There's a good idea, right?

[01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:09.330]
Then we can place some of the audio clips from these great movies that new pole is going up any second

[01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:12.070]
Don't you think be an or boy? Oh, yes

[01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:13.790]
Now see actually

[01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:15.430]
There's no difference

[01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:23.470]
300 and three votes yesterday on Requiem for Dream and now 304 is the close to final total if he ever gets this guy

[01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:25.270]
Dan pole over there 304

[01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:28.950]
I'm going very good. I'm going raw so that's pretty consistent, huh?

[01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:34.690]
Mm-hmm of which 50.3 percent never saw it which means then they're half of the audience

[01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:40.190]
At least if the pole is supposed to write saw it as opposed to a Requiem for Dream 56 percent didn't see it

[01:07:40.850 --> 01:07:45.530]
So that's something for you to do, okay? We keep begging you. We keep prodding you up. Don't you?

[01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:50.850]
Even if only half of the if a third of the people like it as much as we did will be doing a tremendous service

[01:07:50.850 --> 01:07:53.930]
Especially in June in the middle of that swamp

[01:07:54.930 --> 01:07:57.950]
In the middle of the freaking Everglades known as South Florida

[01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.190]
I could listen to forget the movie. I could just listen to the music all they want

[01:08:05.010 --> 01:08:06.490]
I'm gonna be on television

[01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.870]
Yeah, you know, you notice what a sweat she's in when she goes down to the when she gets on the subway or is it on the bus

[01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:19.370]
Well, she on a bus. I think she everything taxi subway

[01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.410]
And she's going to the TV station because she wants to know when she's supposed to be there

[01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:28.250]
She wants to know when she's gonna be on television. Yeah, and the mucus carlis is making mucus

[01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.170]
Symbols hands on my knee. I saw dry and sticky and

[01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:39.690]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 80 I will say this from add Dylan last time drugstore cowboy

[01:08:39.690 --> 01:08:42.690]
At least he didn't have the purple elbow, you know like Harry

[01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:50.510]
Man, there was an awful lot of injecting going on a movie last night, but at least they were a little more careful

[01:08:51.730 --> 01:08:54.630]
Yeah, they post the stickin at same big purple spot

[01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:58.210]
That infected blotch that Harry had on his arm

[01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:09.810]
Yeah, that movie was so good. I was I was literally shocked at how good it was how much I enjoyed it and I can really say that shocked

[01:09:11.690 --> 01:09:16.410]
Then I'll tell you the other one and nobody's talked about we'll do it one day since we got like a whole bunch of days

[01:09:16.410 --> 01:09:20.910]
The game did you which you finally saw which you had already seen I had already seen it with Michael Vagris

[01:09:20.910 --> 01:09:23.550]
Right, but that's all one timer because once you know what's gonna happen

[01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:28.550]
That's all all the oomph is in that right. Oh, I'm absolutely the ending is where it's all about

[01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:30.250]
I mean it is a sensation

[01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:33.630]
Frustrating and guessing right. Mm-hmm. I'll confuse

[01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.470]
Here's plantation hello

[01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:40.130]
Plantation

[01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:44.710]
Going once plantation is gone

[01:09:46.130 --> 01:09:53.150]
Here's Miami hello, yeah, yes, sir. Hello, my Canadian pit of file friend

[01:09:53.850 --> 01:09:54.290]
Hmm

[01:09:57.050 --> 01:10:03.730]
Hmm five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T of Horizon Wireless line right since the adult

[01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:09.510]
They're having rights in Seattle as we speak on MSNBC. I don't you might have it on something

[01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:12.970]
Like I always go to MSNBC if I'm actually happy

[01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:18.650]
Let's see MSNBC cut away from it sound like 133. I just want the information gathering

[01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:21.530]
New jabber on the phone while driving

[01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:25.330]
Well, that's the end of that. Yeah, see that'll teach you to give me to go to MSNBC

[01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:27.610]
It's a bad mistake on my part. Damn it

[01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:30.490]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello

[01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:33.310]
Lauderdale, yeah, that's good sir

[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.230]
I'm glad you watched

[01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.870]
Glen Gary Glen Ross

[01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:37.950]
I think if

[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:39.770]
Baldwin would have been

[01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:44.150]
Consulting your cell staff they would have said

[01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:46.890]
Water is proposing

[01:10:49.930 --> 01:10:50.410]
Yeah

[01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.330]
um

[01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:55.250]
Looking at my notes here Neil. I know you

[01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:59.130]
Yeah, well throw that one out whatever we note that was on throw it out

[01:10:59.770 --> 01:11:00.230]
All right

[01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:04.410]
What do you think about the NHL considering a larger

[01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:09.550]
Goal met I think that's the most stupid thing I've heard it's typical of what you expect from Gary Batman

[01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:15.090]
What's gonna solve the problem of the NHL is to stop though is to actually call all the obstruction

[01:11:15.090 --> 01:11:18.990]
Though hooking and attacking and the holding and the crap they keep pretending they're gonna do it

[01:11:18.990 --> 01:11:23.450]
And they won't do it the great players can't be great and it's it's it's terminal Gary

[01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:27.090]
Batman and his colleagues there have destroyed the game. It's its ponderous

[01:11:27.090 --> 01:11:30.570]
Luder Chris I'm glad you agree with me as Luder Chris. It's a disgrace

[01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:33.790]
I haven't watched the total of ten minutes of these final of the series

[01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:37.770]
Well, I watched the game last time I mean it's hockey so you gotta watch yourself

[01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.470]
It's that no it's not hockey and we don't have to watch it

[01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:43.070]
Because there's a hockey game on means we have to watch it

[01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:46.590]
Well, why did they pass that law? I want to watch

[01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:49.870]
I want to see who's gonna win the Stanley Cup. I couldn't care less

[01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.930]
I couldn't give a crap about either one of these teams

[01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:57.270]
And either one of these teams would be in it if it weren't for this clutch and grab Jersey wouldn't be there in a million years

[01:11:57.270 --> 01:12:00.590]
If it weren't for the fact they play that coma style and that's all they do is like

[01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:02.810]
Chase guys into the corners and drag them down

[01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:07.750]
Interfer with guys who don't have the puck. They just don't call stuff. There's no game anymore. It's it's bad news

[01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:12.410]
It was interesting to read that Gary Batman is you know call this you know

[01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:17.210]
This is an entertainment. This is entertainment. We need to find a way to you know

[01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:18.430]
For the fans

[01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:22.290]
It's odd that there's kind of crime exchange

[01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:26.030]
Gary Batman's an asshole man. Have a great day. Okay, find your notes

[01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:37.390]
See I'd rather watch the a preseason game the Leafs and the Savers let's put that on the other rest of the day

[01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:39.610]
What do you say? It sure beats that guy's notes

[01:12:40.530 --> 01:12:44.370]
Oh, no Lutheran priest is spread it after claiming God and internal life don't exist

[01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:51.150]
Copenhagen a Lutheran priest was suspended the after his remarks that God doesn't exist and there's no eternal life

[01:12:51.150 --> 01:12:55.330]
Or ankle many of his peers in Denmark state church. Haha nice god pops

[01:12:57.410 --> 01:13:05.610]
Thor killed Roseball the pastor of tar bake a town of 51,000 just north of capital of Copenhagen said in a recent interview that there is no heavenly God

[01:13:05.610 --> 01:13:07.590]
There is no eternal life and there is no resurrection

[01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:13.250]
That's the only correct sure the claims have mystified church leaders in this Scandinavian country of 5.3 million

[01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:20.070]
We're about 85% of the population belongs to the state evangelical Lutheran church yet just 5% of 10 church services regularly

[01:13:20.670 --> 01:13:26.530]
About like Italy where they're all Catholics, but only I think it's 7% go to church. No 3% 3% Italy

[01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:30.910]
Yep, U.S. is very much out on a limb in every guard

[01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:36.510]
Very much out on a limb most of the rest of the world is finally caught on except across the those 10th world countries

[01:13:37.130 --> 01:13:39.690]
Like the ones were bushes hanging out these days

[01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:43.110]
with a la I

[01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.710]
Wonder what they think about that. I wonder what they think about his take on

[01:13:46.770 --> 01:13:51.870]
Islam and a la and all of these things, huh? I guess we'll have to ask here's the a new poll is up there now

[01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:56.410]

But also it's bad for your health. That's probably the most important part

[01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:15.550]
You become diabetic. No fun take it for me. I've had diabetes for 16 years. No fun

[01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:17.390]
Look at all the things you can't eat anymore

Buts and biking coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:36.710]
The startling true story of a man who wouldn't listen to his manager and ended up biting it very hard

[01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.210]
He was Terence Trent Darby

[01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:48.290]
You're one of the college first album introducing the hotline. I said okay trendy New York loft boy

[01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:52.810]
I don't know what the fuck it means but go ahead Terence Trent Darby's manager Chet Stools

[01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.610]
You're looking back. I should have known

[01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:58.750]
The guy has three names, you know like Harry handstrong purple grip or something

[01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:04.350]
You know that pretentious upper west side. We think we're British horse with a success of his first single wishing well

[01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:09.670]
Stools urge Darby not to alienate his fans with any more quote fruity-assed art crap

[01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:14.510]
Unquote but Darby didn't listen his second album would completely unnoticed

[01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:20.850]
It's title neither facial nor flesh a soundtrack of love faith hope and resurrection

[01:16:20.850 --> 01:16:28.130]
Can you believe it? I said Terence I'm dying here. I got three kids who need toilet paper to wipe their runny asses

[01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:34.910]
And you give me fish and flesh and hope and resurrection. I ought to kill you as Chet Stools home and business went into foreclosure

[01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:36.890]
He begged Darby to listen to reason

[01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:39.530]
Unmoved Darby released a third record

[01:16:40.050 --> 01:16:41.450]
Symphony or damn

[01:16:42.050 --> 01:16:46.450]
Exploring the tension inside the sweetness if I ever see this

[01:16:46.450 --> 01:16:52.030]
Again, I am gonna ram his contract so far up his ass. He was going to say ass

[01:16:52.030 --> 01:16:58.110]
But tonight for the first time Terence Trent Darby himself responds to accusations that he's a complete

[01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:03.570]
Hey, that's a great title for an album the artist responds to accusations that he's the complete

[01:17:04.530 --> 01:17:06.110]
Christ I need a new job

[01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:11.010]
It's a big juicy shopping with liquid show business tonight on inside of a honey

[01:17:11.010 --> 01:17:17.990]
1133 is 560 W3 and the new poll is in the process of being up. Isn't it? Oh brother. What is he doing up there?

[01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:23.370]
Uh, I asked him yesterday. So he's got to remove votes and stop people from voting long enough

[01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:29.510]
So he can clear out those votes and get a new poll up. So in other words, this is created a lot more work doing these two polls every day. Yeah

[01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:34.910]
All right excellent work off some calories Eric has good for you

[01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:37.150]
Did see chicks ruffle more feathers

[01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.530]
So you could keep the music going

[01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:51.930]
Just as the controversy appeared to be dying down after the Vixich's Natalie mains mildly ridiculed president Bush before the start of the Iraq war country radio programmers are

[01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:54.550]
Disappointed in the group lots of gain. Oh

[01:17:55.150 --> 01:18:01.850]
This time they take issue with the fact that mains apparently chose to take a shot at fellow country musician Toby Keith during her

[01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:08.570]
May 21 performance in the Academy of Country Music Awards means war sleeveless shirt with letters FU TK on the front

[01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:10.410]
Got that

[01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:15.290]
Yeah, but she says it stood for something else. I'm going on here. Would you just relax

[01:18:15.930 --> 01:18:20.310]
Most viewers including award show presenter Vince Gill interpret letters as an expletive aimed at Keith

[01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:24.890]
After opening the envelope that reveal Keith the one and I's biggest award entertainer the year Gill clipped

[01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:27.030]
I think his name was on someone shirt tonight

[01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:32.810]
For WSTU Philadelphia assistant program director slice music director cattle act jack

[01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:39.150]
Main shirt was the shows only disappointment with all the patriotism in the year that night it was a downer completely unnecessary says

[01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.190]
I was disappointed with them yet again

[01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:46.370]
Just when you think the it's safe to add the chicks back in the rotation KZK

[01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:51.250]
X-link and the rest of the PD Brian Jennings says oh Natalie why do you make it so hard to love you

[01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:54.350]
Now what does she say it stood for?

[01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:58.930]
Freedom unity truth knowledge something like that right

[01:18:59.570 --> 01:19:02.530]
Nice going on Natalie keep sticking to a money

[01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:05.310]
I think it's go girl you go girl friend

[01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:12.190]
This story about the Mexican guy in the marijuana. This is this is so freaking American man

[01:19:12.990 --> 01:19:17.510]
Man can sue government for selling him marijuana car true story

[01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:20.810]
Carls just perked up Los Angeles

[01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:23.410]
A Mexican network is it's a Mexican

[01:19:24.330 --> 01:19:25.170]
I never want to

[01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:31.170]
A Mexican national may sue the US government for selling him a car with a hidden load of marijuana

[01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:36.750]
Then arresting him when he tried to cross the US Mexico border in it a federal appeals court is ruled that'll learn him

[01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:42.390]
The ninth circuit quit of appeals found yesterday the government's argument that it should be immune from Jose Aguado

[01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:45.790]
Servantes lawsuit was so off the mark as to be embarrassing

[01:19:46.450 --> 01:19:53.270]
Just like the federal government's position on drugs in the first place is embarrassing just like the so-called war on drugs is

[01:19:54.210 --> 01:20:00.930]
Embarrassing just like the US's pressure on Canada to like a water down near a decriminalization marijuana laws embarrassing

[01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:07.450]
The appellate panel reinstated surveillance negligence claims against the government for allegedly failing to find a

[01:20:07.450 --> 01:20:13.530]
Remove the drugs from the car he purchased in July of 1999 to the US Marshall service auction in San Diego

[01:20:14.190 --> 01:20:19.230]
Four months earlier the car was seized by the INS after was used to transport illegal immigrants into the US

[01:20:19.230 --> 01:20:24.330]
But agents apparently failed to notice a 199 pounds of marijuana secreted in its bumper the court said

[01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:31.150]
But the justice is decided that Surveillance resident of Mexico could not sue for false imprisonment or false arrest because US

[01:20:31.150 --> 01:20:35.050]
Customs agents who found the pot when Surveillance tried to cross the border for Mexico to be West

[01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:38.490]
October of 99 had reasonable cost to believe his arrest was lawful

[01:20:38.970 --> 01:20:39.450]
what

[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:44.110]
Surveillance spent three and a half months in jail charged with drug smuggling

[01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:49.010]
He was released after US investigators realized that the marijuana which had been welded into the bumper

[01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:52.930]
Was so decomposed that it could not possibly have been placed there just months earlier

[01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:56.950]
Surveillance attorney Steven S. Day of San Diego be saying oh

[01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:57.630]
brother

[01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:59.590]
How do you like that

[01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.510]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:07.170]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T new pull is up

[01:21:07.170 --> 01:21:10.890]
Neal shows on movies are always just got a smattering about it. Just one up this moment

[01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:13.550]
How many folks we got 22

[01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:17.330]

Okay, five getting boring five ponderous effing ponderous five and good one uh-oh

[01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:26.030]
See there you go. They're getting pissed off and fired up

[01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:30.130]
Although it's interesting note that we had as many votes on Glingery like one more than we had on

[01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.970]
Sarah

[01:21:31.530 --> 01:21:32.330]
The day before

[01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:36.530]
But I think we pushed him right to the edge just like old mailman Rick

[01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:42.090]
They got their finger on the knob right now. They get ready to change the dial ready second them any second now

[01:21:42.090 --> 01:21:44.330]
They're gonna change it out because I've pushed him right to the edge

[01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:49.030]
Here's four lottery. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey

[01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:56.690]
That was good

[01:21:57.350 --> 01:22:01.470]
Second one forget about it. That that changed my life. That was great.

[01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:06.930]
Dr. Rascal. Yeah, they portray Miami. It's like a different world. I guess I wasn't the 70s back here

[01:22:06.930 --> 01:22:11.330]
What's the name? I'm a youngster. So I wouldn't know that and

[01:22:12.170 --> 01:22:19.690]
Also a movie you might like to check out they make one of the dog the stupid dog shows is a movie called Best in Show

[01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:24.210]
Okay, movie. I like this little terminal, but it's worth a watch

[01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:27.150]
I got it down. It's good and finally

[01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:32.130]
Including Badgers. We don't need no stinkin Badgers. Okay, palmy

[01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:33.270]
See ya

[01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:40.430]
560560 the movie shows are getting ponderous so you call and talk about something other than the movies please anything else

[01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:46.150]
What do you laugh at all hold my breath? Well, you know they can't do that that they can't do anything other in fact

[01:22:46.150 --> 01:22:48.230]
I'm just watching the calendar right now

[01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:53.490]
For starting on the fourth of July goes into my summer schedule for this year where I'm only doing two days and thursday's

[01:22:54.430 --> 01:22:56.250]
And I'm gonna say on the fourth of July

[01:22:58.510 --> 01:22:59.470]
That's what I'm gonna say

[01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:05.590]
Because we have reached that impasse, you know, we've reached the point where like we all we need to recharge our batteries

[01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:09.350]
Because the audience well, let's see what year was it that they ran out of material 18 what?

[01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:13.330]
80 yeah, they ran out of material a long time ago

[01:23:13.830 --> 01:23:16.210]
But boy, you give them a chance to add a name to a list

[01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:20.010]
Right even if it's right wrong wrong list

[01:23:20.010 --> 01:23:25.250]
That's right just just a name even if it's a list that we did the week before man. They got their thumb right on it

[01:23:25.710 --> 01:23:29.050]
In fact, that's the that we should have a billboard in honor of the audience saying

[01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:32.030]
That should be it that should be our model

[01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:36.490]
560560 let's talk about Brian greasy. Yeah

[01:23:36.490 --> 01:23:42.530]
How come I comments about the marlin thing didn't get any response. Oh, that's right because we're not supposed to be talking about that

[01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:43.970]
Maybe they're just being obedient

[01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:50.930]
Quit the marlin talk on this radio station. I'm not trying to be bush boss. Did night tell him Jimmy and Danny was not a one at the

[01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:55.810]
Notice that that was killing this radio station was neither guy. Yeah, Jimmy and Danny Danny and Jimmy

[01:23:56.670 --> 01:24:00.170]
Even the assholes in programming there even a sports nerds like Clarence were saying

[01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.430]
Jesus when you guys gonna cut this crap out already

[01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:06.610]
It's getting effing ponderous just like kneels a movie shows really ponderous

[01:24:08.190 --> 01:24:11.970]
Let's see how's it going. Oh, yeah see that 16 look at that

[01:24:12.730 --> 01:24:14.750]
Negative see I was enjoying him a lot

[01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:21.450]
I was thinking maybe we're open up some new avenues for a lot of people out there some new flicks that they otherwise might never see

[01:24:21.450 --> 01:24:25.970]
Just like I've enjoyed the last couple of weeks, but no they hated

[01:24:27.190 --> 01:24:29.770]
They can't stomach it

[01:24:29.770 --> 01:24:34.350]
Looking at that result. Yes, it doesn't have to make a grown man weep. I don't buy it

[01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:41.610]
Neil shows on movies are we got 53 votes. It's the early returns, but not looking too promising not too promising at all

[01:24:43.430 --> 01:24:45.430]
Ponderous effing ponderous 16

[01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:51.810]
Getting boring 12 great of breath of fresh year 10 okay 10 good five

[01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:56.690]
28 to 25 the negatories have it so far the negatories

[01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:04.750]
Just when you feel like you're doing something worthwhile when you feel like you're opening up a little bit of entertainment to a dead-ass place

[01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:06.410]
What a goddamn average person is like?

[01:25:06.690 --> 01:25:08.070]
Like that on a good day

[01:25:09.210 --> 01:25:14.010]
Now we don't like it Neil. We want something new we want something different and they're exciting

[01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:20.450]
And I and I'll say also the thing with the hot the it goes to show you their attention span is very short mm-hmm

[01:25:21.730 --> 01:25:25.410]
Like the hot couples contest. We had a tremendous response on a previous one

[01:25:25.410 --> 01:25:25.930]
American

[01:25:28.230 --> 01:25:32.530]
And just like all of these so-called reality shows and who wants to be a million area

[01:25:32.530 --> 01:25:37.010]
They think that if they put it on over and over again, but they don't understand the attention span is very short

[01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:39.370]
Oh, well, wait come on give us a new game to play now

[01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:42.230]
Give us something new and exciting we're tired of that game

[01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:48.370]

I showed you the feet at the door and it was high-quality.

[01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:55.490]

Let's do the high-quality dance.

[01:29:54.290 --> 01:29:58.710]
I am 48 at 560 WQA and he would have been good in that movie.

[01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:05.130]
I am 99 votes and boy it is looking really bad on our movie.

[01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:08.210]
We just call it a phase that we went through and we will just move on.

[01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:11.650]
Movie will have to when a doubt toss it out.

[01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:13.490]
They don't like it.

[01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:20.490]
The show is on movies are Pandorus, F&Pondorus, 30.

[01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:21.810]
About 30, man.

[01:30:22.570 --> 01:30:23.750]
Getting boring, 22.

[01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:27.530]
See when the two negative categories are 1 and 2, that's not a really good sign.

[01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:29.790]
OK, 20.

[01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:31.450]
See even OK is like Luke Worm.

[01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:36.090]
Great, a breath of fresh year, 14 and good only 13.

[01:30:36.250 --> 01:30:37.350]
Now the first 99 votes.

[01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:38.310]
Not looking too good.

[01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:40.870]
So I guess we'll wrap that up right now.

[01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.870]
Never discuss it again.

[01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:46.690]
Never discuss it in movies again when I'm talking about the Marlin.

[01:30:47.730 --> 01:30:49.790]
We will not talk about movies.

[01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:52.250]
We will not talk about politics.

[01:30:52.630 --> 01:30:53.370]
Right, no bad culture.

[01:30:53.610 --> 01:30:54.650]
We won't talk about religion.

[01:30:55.890 --> 01:30:57.690]
We won't talk about the weather.

[01:30:58.730 --> 01:31:07.630]
We won't talk about geography, geometry, history, trigonometry, algebra, calculus,

[01:31:19.190 --> 01:31:37.610]
class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class, class

[01:32:21.230 --> 01:32:27.430]
official policy here guys now to read bring course Rolls-Button's

[01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:34.690]
like a metabolite as a fedron because a fedra because it's killing people. That's why they're

[01:32:34.690 --> 01:32:37.470]
clamping on it because it's killing people. No one's outside because you didn't solve the instructions

[01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:42.230]
you had health problems. No, you're wrong. No, I'm not. I used it for two years now. I'm fine.

[01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:47.090]
I don't care if you used it for 20 years. It's bad stuff. It's a stimulant. It's not bad. It's not bad.

[01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:53.270]
Okay, you keep telling. Keep going. I've taken them calls in a year. Okay, if you're still alive. Oh my god.

[01:32:54.390 --> 01:33:01.030]
The fedra is bad crap. It's a matter of fact. Too bad. You're right. It didn't have some. It's not bad.

[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:08.210]
I beg your pardon? Oh, I was just making fun. Oh, that's good.

[01:33:13.530 --> 01:33:18.770]
See, that's what we're going to get. That's what we're going to be getting from now on. Here's a call from Jupiter. Hello.

[01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:28.750]
Any ongoing. Okay. How's the weather in P.O today? How's the weather? It's a kind of murky and 66 today. Not bad.

[01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:33.790]
My armpits tripping like Niagara Falls right out here. So it's got to be better than that. Yeah.

[01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:38.950]
I heard somebody told me that the problem with the cars up in Toronto is mainly in the like the

[01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:42.550]
Oriental section. No, that's not true at all. What did he have told you that?

[01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:49.110]
That's something that I'm talking to. There isn't any problem in the community. It's confined to two or three hospitals.

[01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:56.910]
There isn't any of it in the general community. None. Zero. Okay. That's so let's hear. Anyway, Brian

[01:33:56.910 --> 01:34:03.890]
McGatney, the panther B. Rear right up here talked to Brian VM about how well they're doing. He

[01:34:03.890 --> 01:34:08.410]
said he basically sat down here. The problem was they told him to cut payroll as soon as we

[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:13.670]
went to the cup. And that's why he has to get rid of all the players. So he was saying we could have

[01:34:13.670 --> 01:34:17.650]
kept him together, but they didn't want to pay him. They should like tomorrow. Well, you know, that's

[01:34:17.650 --> 01:34:21.370]
a good excuse. But I guess he conveniently forgot that he brought his brother in here to coach the

[01:34:21.370 --> 01:34:25.450]
team, which all the players despised him like poison. In fact, all the players in the league despised

[01:34:25.450 --> 01:34:30.070]
Terry Murray like poison and really ruined the whole chemistry on the team. So it's very easy for him

[01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:33.490]
to find other scapegoats now, which seems to be the number one habit with everybody connected with

[01:34:33.490 --> 01:34:37.510]
the panthers. But he screwed this thing up. Him and Torrey screwed it up and his brother big time.

[01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:42.470]
It's kind of funny that we went. Panthers wanted to come up with a rookie coach. And now that ducks are

[01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:46.870]
doing the rookie coach, that's anything, anything through that or just went to the... No, I don't think

[01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:50.790]
there's, I mean, that car's probably a good coach, but the fact is it's a question of who gets

[01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:54.650]
hot at the right time. That's what the playoffs are all about. And if the kind of hockey we're seeing

[01:34:54.650 --> 01:34:58.950]
here in the finals and through most of the playoffs this year, if that's what the game has become,

[01:34:59.130 --> 01:35:04.610]
I just not interested anymore. It's just it's cock-ass crap. It's just kind of sad. We, you know, I talked

[01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:08.010]
a couple weeks ago, we knew if this came down to the Dustin devil, there was going to be, you know,

[01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:12.050]
one of the lower games. And then the ratings, man, you can't complain about the ratings because

[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:16.550]
there aren't any. I mean, even in Canada, the ratings are half of what they were. Yeah, I don't,

[01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:20.410]
I don't doubt at all. I think the only thing we've switched, we can't change the maps, we can't

[01:35:20.410 --> 01:35:24.710]
change the ring size. It's got to be the rules we cracked on. It's just what the guys skate instead of

[01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:29.850]
hook-up and then that one. Well, hold your breath. Gary Bowen, don't find a problem. Well, you didn't

[01:35:29.850 --> 01:35:35.050]
watch the end science, right? Did you watch the end of the game? I beg your pardon? Did you watch

[01:35:35.050 --> 01:35:39.350]
the end of the game last night? Last night, I watched maybe five minutes of it. Did you watch that

[01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:46.250]
on ABC or did it? No, on CBC. They've got some goofy thoughts that they're going to interview all

[01:35:46.250 --> 01:35:53.110]
the stars, you know, all the personalities, you know, they come out of commercial breaks and they

[01:35:53.110 --> 01:35:59.350]
were showing the CEO of Disney almost every other shot and all I can think of when I see that.

[01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:05.990]
Hi, sir. Hi, sir. Yeah. Okay, have a great day, Pally. One of the new. We're

[01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:09.670]
closing. Yes. Has anybody talked about the website? Yes, that's it.

[01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:14.950]
Anybody talked about the website that's in the news rent a negro.com? No.

[01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:20.650]
All right, check it out. What is that? No, just check it out on the

[01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:27.390]
chat. Okay, but okay, have a great day. Oh, thanks for the memories. I'm starting to feel

[01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:33.210]
like Bob Hope, you know, 100. Here's the facts from RC and Miami says I've mentioned this to

[01:36:33.210 --> 01:36:36.570]
a couple of video stores in response was that I'm a cook. I'm interested in your opinion.

[01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:41.270]
Well, it probably is a cook if you listen to this show. Imagine that you could walk in and

[01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:50.630]
score a list of available movies. This instead of slowly meandering through the aisles with your

[01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:57.510]
available movies. How about you? The list could be easily built with a computer program to make

[01:36:57.510 --> 01:37:02.710]
selection fast ever list. I mean, that's you're a cook RC. You're a cook. You're a crazy person.

[01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:09.330]
It says that that's a video story to get my business to. I mean, that's just crazy, crazy man.

[01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:12.970]
Get some help. See Sarah for some good stuff. Okay.

[01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:19.630]
And if you see Harry, tell him to stay out of arms way.

[01:37:23.590 --> 01:37:27.710]
Wow. Yeah, let me go into a record store and instead of looking to see if they got the record,

[01:37:27.710 --> 01:37:32.090]
I want just give me a list of all the stuff you got. Well, it borders, which one is it borders?

[01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:37.390]
Borders. They have like a computerized card catalog that the public can go up and access to see

[01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:44.350]
what discs are there before they go look for them. I mean DVDs. I would assume, but I don't know

[01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:51.350]
if it's for sure. Yeah. Half of the first of all, half of the fun of buying DVD, at least for me,

[01:37:51.690 --> 01:37:56.890]
or music for that matter is going into a good store that's got a tremendous selection and looking

[01:37:56.890 --> 01:38:00.630]
through and all the, oh, I haven't seen that in a long time. I heard that was really great and

[01:38:00.630 --> 01:38:04.330]
you picked something up that you never intended to get in the first place. Little impulse shopping.

[01:38:04.330 --> 01:38:08.190]
And looking at it, I'm going to go into public. Give me a list of everything you got.

[01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:12.690]
Public. Instead of my wasting time with a shopping cart going up and down a house,

[01:38:12.950 --> 01:38:16.890]
just give me a list of everything you got public's direct. And then you know what I can do with it,

[01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:17.070]
right?

[01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.270]
Get out of the house.

[01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:23.090]
We're sports radio 516.

[01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:24.670]
You A.M.

[01:38:26.310 --> 01:38:28.490]
I will start with your goth from a spokeo.

[01:38:32.310 --> 01:38:36.570]
When you want to get your yayas looking at some yabas, go to the Gaza.

[01:38:36.990 --> 01:38:40.210]
Strip joint that is hello, I'm Joey Gaza.

[01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:46.210]
Owner and proprietor of the Gaza Strip joint. And Vite News to come on down to the Gaza Strip

[01:38:46.210 --> 01:38:51.330]
where we feature a wide range of talented girls that can perform amazing acts with a dollar bill

[01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:56.710]
or in one of our fleshly-apprented back rules. This week's headliner at the Gaza is Gaja.

[01:38:56.710 --> 01:39:00.850]
You're going to love this one, guys. She squids grenades out of her thing.

[01:39:11.590 --> 01:39:17.490]
So get your yayas and take down the Gaza Strip joint located just one mile east of the

[01:39:17.490 --> 01:39:20.910]
industrial complex across from the abandoned Sinclair station.

[01:39:20.910 --> 01:39:21.510]
1211.

[01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:25.250]
1211 isn't Sinclair to want to have the dinosaur on it?

[01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:26.710]
Yes indeed. I think it was.

[01:39:27.190 --> 01:39:29.370]
Anyway, date and daily news, somebody facts this in.

[01:39:29.490 --> 01:39:33.030]
Project could put your life at the Pentagon's fingertips. This sounds promising, not.

[01:39:34.110 --> 01:39:37.210]
In fact, I do want to pull in this newspaper, date and daily news.

[01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:42.070]
Would you want to die with that records your every move? 526 votes so far?

[01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:43.910]
518 say no.

[01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:44.970]
And eight say yes.

[01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:48.750]
The eight, I guess people are looking for a lot more attention.

[01:39:49.530 --> 01:39:52.710]
Coming to you soon from the Pentagon, the diary to end all the

[01:39:52.710 --> 01:39:56.970]
theories, a multimedia digital record of everywhere you go and everything you see,

[01:39:57.530 --> 01:40:01.450]
hear, read, say and touch. Even your rectum.

[01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:05.510]
Known as life log, the projects have been put out for contract debates by the

[01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:10.390]
Defense Events Research Project Agency or DARPA, the agency that helped build the internet that's

[01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:15.590]
not developing anti-terrorism tools. The agency doesn't consider life log as an anti-terrorism system.

[01:40:15.590 --> 01:40:23.310]
I got a log form, but a tool to capture one person's experience in an interaction with the world

[01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:28.050]
through a camera microphone and sensor is worn by the user. Everything from heartbeats to

[01:40:28.050 --> 01:40:32.810]
travel to internet chatting would be recorded. The goal is to create breakthrough software that

[01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:36.250]
helps analyze behavior habits and routines according to Pentagon documents.

[01:40:36.690 --> 01:40:39.770]
The products of the Ancline-Classified Project would be available to both the private sector

[01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:42.690]
and other government agencies, a concern to privacy advocates.

[01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:48.710]
DARPA's Jan Walker said life log is intended for users who give their consent to be monitored.

[01:40:49.570 --> 01:40:53.770]
At least in the beginning, it could enhance the memory of military commanders and improve

[01:40:53.770 --> 01:40:58.570]
computerized military training by chronicling how users learn and then tailoring training

[01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:03.250]
according to the official set. But John Pike of GlobalSecurity.org, a Defense Analysis Group,

[01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:08.490]
is dubious the project has military application. I have a much easier time understanding how big

[01:41:08.490 --> 01:41:12.390]
brother would want this than how Rumsfeld would use it Pike said. They haven't identified a

[01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:16.470]
military application yet. In fact, if the generals want to remember something,

[01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:21.610]
why not just write it down on your shirt sleeve or on the chest, write it on your chest,

[01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:26.090]
on your leg, back with thigh. You have to write it on backwards so you can read it in the mirror.

[01:41:26.210 --> 01:41:30.110]
Yeah, they can write it on their rectum or they can put like a little chalkboard around their neck

[01:41:30.110 --> 01:41:37.690]
like what's your name Anthony Hopkins. Get the chalk! The yield shows on movies are killing

[01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:42.750]
this audience. They're how upset, 153 votes and the outlook isn't good man. It's not good.

[01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:47.830]
Let's talk hockey. No. You know, we finally get to the most boring, the most unwatched, the most

[01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:52.370]
ponderous stand-acup finals maybe in history, at least in modern history. And now all of us

[01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:56.350]
said we're getting a hockey calls. Please spare me. I'd rather talk about the Marlins and I'm going to

[01:41:56.350 --> 01:42:00.590]
die before I'll talk about the Marlins. Nothing to talk about. They've destroyed the game. What is

[01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:07.810]
there to say? Sucks, ponderous. Niels, as a matter of fact, if you had a choice, because you don't

[01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:11.470]
like it in the first place, but even if you were a sports fan, if you had a choice between watching

[01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:15.930]
a sporting event that you knew was going to suck or sticking some DVDs in there, a couple of movies

[01:42:15.930 --> 01:42:20.110]
that you never saw or haven't seen in a long time that you enjoyed. Is it a tough choice? No. No.

[01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:27.290]
And speaking of boring sporting activities, I'm over there in Amsterdam and on the BBC,

[01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:34.550]
they had a really hysterical documentary. It was about soccer, hooliganism. What I like to see

[01:42:34.550 --> 01:42:39.610]
that? Yeah. And they showed, and of course a lot of the soccer matches wind up nil nil. You know,

[01:42:39.690 --> 01:42:44.230]
a squirrel is nothing, nothing. Because soccer is ponderous and boring. It's crap. That would piss me off.

[01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:47.430]
But a lot of those people that go there don't really care what the score is or what they actually

[01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:52.290]
is, because they just go there, they're professional hooligans, and they go from one game to another,

[01:42:52.290 --> 01:42:56.370]
they get on buses. They showed the whole thing. They went to Amsterdam, they went here. Just to

[01:42:56.370 --> 01:43:00.730]
stir up a bunch of crap and to get in a big brawl with the fans of the opposing team. What also

[01:43:00.730 --> 01:43:06.290]
there to do? Yeah, Brits. So one of the guys, and of course all of these guys, I would say 95% of them,

[01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:13.930]
the same big thick neck, you know, with a big head. Buckethead Englishman. And they interviewed a

[01:43:13.930 --> 01:43:23.330]
one guy and the caption on the screen said, Joe Williams, whatever, ex hooligan, ex hooligan,

[01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:29.430]
only the British could come up with an ex hooligan. I thought that was just, you know, ex

[01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:38.870]
ass murderer, you know, or here's a picture of Greg Reed exogenous. Of course, I must have been before

[01:43:38.870 --> 01:43:45.990]
we met him. 5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. It's looking really lame for the movie shows.

[01:43:45.990 --> 01:43:54.650]
Neil shows on movies are ponderous, effing ponderous 50, 30.4% getting boring, 34. I mean,

[01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:57.610]
they're like hostile. They're coming at us with the barrels just, just,

[01:43:57.610 --> 01:44:05.890]
amazing. Okay, 30, good, 26, and great. A breath of fresh air is sucking winds, sucking gasping

[01:44:05.890 --> 01:44:09.750]
for oxygen in the last place, only 24. Well, it's a good thing we took that pool, you know what?

[01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:16.530]
Yeah, let's start talking about cats now. First, you want to talk about pussy cats,

[01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:21.990]
you go ahead. I'll save that for when I'm on vacation soon. That long, long, much-a-weighted summer

[01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:27.370]
of break. Oh, I'm squeezing my kneecaps and so excited about the prospect of that.

[01:44:29.290 --> 01:44:32.850]
See, I thought the movie thing, we really were, you know, the response on the internet was great,

[01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:37.030]
calls were pouring in. Sure. And you think you're really, you know, doing something for people

[01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:41.070]
and you're enjoying it yourself. Ah, no, we don't like it. No matter what it is, we don't like it.

[01:44:41.170 --> 01:44:45.430]
What's he doing today? No matter what, no matter what it is, you shouldn't have admitted you were

[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:51.870]
enjoying it. Yeah. Hey, it's just like the bedtime stories. Oh, oh, oh, whoa, man, they didn't

[01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:57.330]
just dislike that. They hated that like poison sitting there listening to some asshole reading

[01:44:57.330 --> 01:45:03.790]
crap on the air for four hours every day. Forget about that. We want to listen to all these great

[01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:11.450]
calls you get Neil. Chamba. Chamba. Maricone. Is this the Canadian penifile? Maricone. Chamba.

[01:45:12.030 --> 01:45:16.570]
That's what we want to hear. Some real, there's a lot he's doing Chamba now. That's him.

[01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:23.910]
And then of course the whispering guy. I'd attached the bro. Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:33.330]
Miami. Going once. Nobody on seven. I think he stole his material.

[01:45:33.870 --> 01:45:39.690]
Here's Port Saint Lucy. Hello. Nice to meet you. Oh, God. Yes, sir. I got home yesterday from work

[01:45:39.690 --> 01:45:44.290]
ran into the computer room so I could vote on your poll like any good fan would do. And I couldn't

[01:45:44.290 --> 01:45:48.450]
help but notice that the beastly stock watch is spike like somebody had shot it out of a can.

[01:45:48.570 --> 01:45:54.430]
And so I'm starting to think about why would they go up 20% in a day and then it's hitting me that

[01:45:54.430 --> 01:46:02.010]
the FCC rules means that clear channels now as a freedom to buy more stations. Not really. The new

[01:46:02.010 --> 01:46:06.470]
ruling had little or nothing to do with radio. It only had to do with radio and newspapers but now

[01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:10.690]
with more owning more radio stations. No, I thought that if a market was a certain size,

[01:46:10.690 --> 01:46:15.090]
they could add one more station depending on the size of the market. That was. Yeah, that's true.

[01:46:15.290 --> 01:46:19.490]
That part is true. Yeah, but that's how it's like Miami. If they owned eight now they can own nine,

[01:46:19.570 --> 01:46:23.430]
if they own seven now they can own eight. That's pretty much the word. That's a possibility. Maybe

[01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:26.690]
that's why we have no spots on the log. Maybe our sales department is phasing out and they're

[01:46:26.690 --> 01:46:30.930]
bringing the cheap channel people in. The sales going to go through any day. Oh, maybe I'm just

[01:46:30.930 --> 01:46:35.850]
paranoid, but here's where I start to get a little freaky. Keep channel word to buy out your

[01:46:35.850 --> 01:46:40.250]
station. They're not allowed to have two stations in the same format and the same market, correct?

[01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:47.190]
Because under this more choices all the time like Michael Powell says less owners means more.

[01:46:49.090 --> 01:46:53.570]
That's not true at all. They have CCs got nothing to do with formats. I thought that they were

[01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:57.330]
only allowed to have because of monopoly rules. I thought that they weren't allowed to have two

[01:46:57.330 --> 01:47:01.310]
country stations because then they would divide up the country pie and maybe I've got a misunderstanding

[01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:06.210]
in the way it works. I remember where did you read that? I never heard anything about content.

[01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:09.710]
They're not interested in content in format. Let's just say do that. I thought that was.

[01:47:10.150 --> 01:47:17.150]
What's that? For example, Cox Broadcasting owns Hot 105 and WEDR which are both hip hop stations.

[01:47:17.630 --> 01:47:21.310]
There's no prohibition for doing that. They could take the coast and make it in a hip hop tomorrow

[01:47:21.310 --> 01:47:25.650]
if they wanted. They could hop it all the way to the upor house. Okay, I'm sorry, I was

[01:47:25.650 --> 01:47:30.810]
misunderstanding the way it worked then. I just have this paranoid thing about you getting a two-year

[01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:36.290]
vacation. I mean I know you'd like it. Oh, it's a two-year vacation. Great. Hey,

[01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:39.930]
speaking of movies because everybody hates them so much. Have you ever seen Clark? It's a little

[01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:44.430]
watched movie but I thought it was brilliant. It's sort of low budget but the dialogue is good

[01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:49.290]
enough to keep you interested in it. Clarks? Clarks. It's a black and white movie. It's basically

[01:47:49.290 --> 01:47:52.890]
what started off and I know you probably hate him like poison but the first one was actually brilliant.

[01:47:52.890 --> 01:48:00.330]
The Jay and Silent Bob thing. Oh, that's a great day pal. Thank you.

[01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:11.410]
I'm not a big fan either. Oh, Jay and Silent Effing Bob man. Wow, just when you thought it

[01:48:11.410 --> 01:48:19.930]
couldn't get any more dastardly you know it. Jay and Silent Freaking Bob. Those are the same

[01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:26.210]
people that want to watch Caddy's Shack 20 times a day. Neil shows on movies are I mean what's

[01:48:26.210 --> 01:48:31.390]
the point of I even reading this full anymore? You know I mean it's 184 votes but if the die has been

[01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:39.430]
cast wouldn't you say? Sure. Show's on movies are ponderous, effing ponderous 57, getting boring 41

[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:44.050]
and there's no point in reading the rest out of just under 200. No point. The die has been cast.

[01:48:44.050 --> 01:48:49.530]
They don't like it. Let's go see a great movie. I don't want to. I don't want to.

[01:48:51.470 --> 01:48:57.130]
Reminds me of some of my retarded relatives. I don't want to. Okay. Don't want to play that game.

[01:48:59.490 --> 01:49:02.790]
Like I said though it's a dang good thing we nipped this in the button. We took the pool right now.

[01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:07.690]
They hate it. They don't just dislike it. They despise it. Not as much as they despise George but damn

[01:49:07.690 --> 01:49:13.570]
near. And that's really saying a lot. 10 minutes passed. No one for those of you who despise George

[01:49:13.570 --> 01:49:17.390]
don't forget. Mark it down in your calendar starting the 5th of July. That's my mother's birthday.

[01:49:17.810 --> 01:49:22.210]
Look on a calendar back there, Boenervoy. Is the 4th on a Friday or Thursday?

[01:49:24.090 --> 01:49:32.710]
Friday. Oh so like I said 4th it's like on the 8th of July is when George gets started to

[01:49:32.710 --> 01:49:34.470]
collect those two summer months most of the time.

[01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:41.470]
Now exciting. I'm pretty excited. I'll see you Tuesdays and Thursdays.

[01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:45.610]
And I certainly hope that if I just happen to be in here in the morning like maybe a pump

[01:49:45.610 --> 01:49:49.290]
and some bedtime stories over to Boenervoy like at 9.30 in the morning I don't hear.

[01:49:49.550 --> 01:49:51.790]
Neil, Neil if you're there come on Neil with us. Neil.

[01:49:52.530 --> 01:49:57.590]
I hope I don't hear that. That's not a way down. Those days you kept chiming in.

[01:49:58.570 --> 01:50:01.290]
What are you talking about? You kept chiming in and cue.

[01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:04.390]
Making me laugh. Raking Carlos last distracting.

[01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:08.150]
No, no, no. You're not remembering the day that I'm talking about. This was a different day.

[01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:10.790]
Oh I know what you're talking. That was just joking. I know you didn't want to come on.

[01:50:11.730 --> 01:50:16.530]
It was just joking? Yeah. Not based on Boenervoy sounded like his life depended on it.

[01:50:16.770 --> 01:50:21.550]
Right. Which is why I kept real quiet. Uh-huh. 11 minutes passed. No, that's 560 WQM.

[01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:25.030]

Sometimes art imitates life but in the case of Eddie Murphy life imitates art such as Beverly Hills Cop

[01:52:08.290 --> 01:52:16.210]
thing of feel. Hey Cuey you might have ticked my hand up your what the hell is that or trading places.

[01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:25.150]
This way you sit on this and out 48 hours and many hours of community service and the nutty

[01:52:25.150 --> 01:52:31.490]
professor I know what time that's up but I prefer I thought that he was a she and we can't forget

[01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:39.050]
in America that is coming to America sometimes life in art go hand in hand just like any Murphy and

[01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:44.710]
his prostitute. Prop 16 at 560 don't send me any more faxes from the monkey man please he's you know he

[01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:52.030]
means well but he's in the end. Uh jury the abuyant guy another chronic I like I said what date what's

[01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:58.130]
the date today and the bad news become what the date is today I look at my watch this morning yeah

I must have accidentally hit the uh something on it the stem it says March 3rd.

[01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:10.630]
If this was March 3rd everything else being equal to what it is right now I would definitely

[01:53:10.630 --> 01:53:13.530]
that would be it that would be the end.

[01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:19.610]
Jury the abuyant guy who is obsessed and really just out of control he says watch

[01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:25.290]
Requiem for a dream finally last night unfortunately the stink had edited version from blockbuster.

[01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:30.130]
We don't have any alternatives since our community is so heavily influenced by Gzoids.

[01:53:31.770 --> 01:53:39.170]
I don't understand I thought now this the uh return number on here is 212 I thought he's in New York

[01:53:39.770 --> 01:53:44.670]
that's New York and I understand that that's what I'm saying but it's so what is he talking about

[01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:50.070]
they have blockbuster is uh get all the videos in New York New York as I don't understand what

[01:53:50.070 --> 01:53:53.990]
he's talking about anyway he says phenomenal film especially the performance by Ellen Burst and

[01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:57.710]
the scene where she's doing this room-to-dance in front of the refrigerator almost made me lose control

[01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:03.450]
of my bowels then he goes on about Frank Zappa and he's pleased that I like Frank Zappa and you

[01:54:03.450 --> 01:54:08.710]
like Frank Zappa one clarification what I didn't say anything one clarification or Frank never

[01:54:08.710 --> 01:54:13.370]
used recreational drugs of any kind effectively was so immediately any drug he tended to alienate

[01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:17.910]
a great number of potential fans his only vices were caffeine and tobacco the latter probably

[01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:23.270]
contributing to his ultimate demise from prostate cancer at age 52 in other words he spilled dead okay

[01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:29.050]
Jerry have a great life and cut the crap five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the

[01:54:29.050 --> 01:54:35.630]
AT&T and Verizon wireless line all of a sudden we come to a real general you would call it a

[01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:43.390]
demarcation point like a fork in the road a folk in the road and we discover much to my dismay and

[01:54:43.390 --> 01:54:49.590]
chagrin if the audience despises the this movie shows the disgust of movies the suggestion of

[01:54:49.590 --> 01:54:59.390]
titles all of these things they hate it overwhelming Neil show the 205 votes Neil shows on movies are

[01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:04.370]

history and divine intervention nine people will weave and warp through each other's lives on a day

your arm a log five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a eighteen t line here's a lady

[02:24:50.190 --> 02:24:54.930]
implantation hello actually i started off with a plantation i've been Miami now uh-oh it's going

[02:24:54.930 --> 02:25:00.930]
the wrong way i have to visit my parents and i just let it a big rain storm on the phone just

[02:25:01.730 --> 02:25:05.610]
well thank you so much i feel like i'm becoming a conic too because i called you last week

[02:25:05.610 --> 02:25:10.230]
it's okay anyway um you mentioned something about the three named experts

[02:25:11.010 --> 02:25:17.510]
the fee with a fee one you you made uh uh uh instead of helping all these actors have three names

[02:25:17.510 --> 02:25:20.130]
like so let's see more on a hospital oh yeah right right

[02:25:20.130 --> 02:25:25.590]
so it's a medicine type still a posthum in which i'm a bit disturbed and like in nineteen twenty to

[02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:30.670]
somebody and so now the new actors i'll have to register with the new names because

[02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:34.190]
all the names are being taken up well why can't they just make up a better one

[02:25:34.830 --> 02:25:41.110]
well maybe they want to keep their real name oh come on that's how well i don't know and i

[02:25:41.110 --> 02:25:46.390]
didn't read that jico column but i have to say i kind of agree with that with with what you just

[02:25:46.390 --> 02:25:52.910]
said because i think you would have to realize with the rain storm arm and i'll be uh just

[02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:58.030]
i mean the fun that i have and things like that brings back my head so i look

[02:25:58.030 --> 02:26:02.750]
smooth and just like the problem i guess can you understand what you're saying because your phone

[02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:09.410]
is breaking up so yeah your phone is uh is dying you're in a you're in a bad cell call me again

[02:26:09.410 --> 02:26:13.050]
or uh i'm coming tomorrow okay i couldn't leave her on i couldn't understand what she was saying

[02:26:13.050 --> 02:26:17.150]
she was trying to say that jico was right i've lost touch with because there's a rain storm going on

[02:26:17.890 --> 02:26:19.710]
that's kind of unusual in the summertime isn't it

[02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:25.330]
so yeah i don't want to be in touch with what's going on there in addition we i don't

[02:26:25.330 --> 02:26:29.490]
want to debate that it's just pointless touch with what i don't know the fact that it's hot and

[02:26:29.490 --> 02:26:35.010]
that there's a lot of rain it's the summertime don't forget the skaters and that nobody goes to

[02:26:35.010 --> 02:26:38.590]

didn't read it and her phone was cravin on let me just say this to you well you're in the building

[02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:17.020]
there see Georgia bonerboy could say oh it's pouring out cats and dogs here when you're in a building

[02:35:17.020 --> 02:35:23.660]
you don't know either because we have no windows no we have no window to the world so whether it's like

[02:35:23.660 --> 02:35:27.700]
we could have hail coming on the size of tennis balls we wouldn't know it it could be raining

[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:33.360]
flaming meteors right now we wouldn't know it right exactly not that I want to be defensive about

[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:39.400]
that but it's just such a stale terrible argument you know this the arrest of alleged

[02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:43.360]
olemic bomber Eric Robert Rudolph may finally allow authorities to answer a question that's

[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:47.480]
loom since the beginning of the five-year hunt for him but that's taken on deeper resonance since

[02:35:47.480 --> 02:35:53.720]
9-11 is he a Christian terrorist the question is not just whether Rudolph is a terrorist or whether

[02:35:53.720 --> 02:35:58.640]
considers himself a Christian it's whether he planted bombs at the 1996 olympic games in

[02:35:58.640 --> 02:36:03.780]
Atlanta to abortion clinics and a gay nightclub to advance a religious ideology and how numerous

[02:36:03.780 --> 02:36:09.680]
organized and violent others who share that ideology may be federal investigators believe Rudolph

[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:15.680]
has a long association with the radical Christian identity movement which asserts that northern

[02:36:15.680 --> 02:36:20.520]
European whites are the direct descendants of the lost tribes of Israel gods chosen people

[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:25.840]
some investigators also think he may have written letters that claim responsibility for the nightclub

[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:31.660]
and abortion clinic bombings on behalf of the army of god and all violent offshoot of Christian

[02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:37.440]
identity this reminds me of the mighty python which movie is it what we're talking about the life of

[02:36:37.440 --> 02:36:43.640]
Brian did he people's liberation with the idea of Judean people's solidarity brother same thing man

[02:36:43.640 --> 02:36:49.500]
like I've told you for years folks the religious people are the crazy people make no mistake about it

[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:57.200]
and the more religious the more crazy that's it the fairy tale people so go to our website read that

[02:36:57.200 --> 02:37:02.500]
holster it's in the Washington Post and be sure if you have time or if you have any interest to read

[02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:08.920]
that the very lengthy article by john edelstein one of the minority of the two democratic

[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:13.780]
commissioners on the FCC who voted yesterday against that grotesque deregulation bill

[02:37:13.780 --> 02:37:21.080]
a dark storm cloud is looming over the future of the american media and he is he's got a

[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:26.200]
stomach right on it and I told you back in 1996 or 7 whenever the hell was we were at iod and the day

[02:37:26.200 --> 02:37:32.780]
that that bill came down what did I tell you I said this is a nightmare for this business a nightmare

[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:38.800]
you only ray of hope though in a Washington post yesterday it says a bipartisan group of US

[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:44.080]
opposed the tv networks is spanning their reach expressed confidence they have the votes to roll

[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:48.800]
back they will adopted by the communications regulators yesterday the group said it was pressing

[02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:52.900]
ahead with legislation to retain limits keeping a network from owning stations that together reach

[02:37:52.900 --> 02:37:58.540]
more than 35 percent of the national audience but senator trend lot of mr. cibi told a news conference

[02:37:58.540 --> 02:38:03.540]
there was no partisanship in senate opposition of the new cap a lot of republicans that probably most

[02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:07.360]
of the republic republic republicans of congress would not agree with the decision by the FCC said

[02:38:07.360 --> 02:38:15.140]
like that so that's our one way of hope that maybe congress will say the FCC not so fast here you hot

[02:38:15.140 --> 02:38:23.280]
shots you lunatics you maniacs you gray robbers you and sorry but it's only a coincidence that you

[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.080]
know big business got all the most of the big tax breaks and the rich people and the poor people

[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:33.740]

[02:46:44.680 --> 02:46:48.120]
It's 120 at 560 QM now you're gonna have to explain to me a little bit

[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:52.220]
Interpreter because the facts loses something in the translation. Yeah, we'll have to

[02:46:52.220 --> 02:46:57.200]
Forward the email to you that Boca Brian will send it in on. I'm sure oh really oh

[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.980]
You're gonna get a copy in your envelope a

[02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:06.280]
Hard copy as it were yeah, I doubt how hard it's gonna be man

[02:47:06.280 --> 02:47:09.240]
It's gonna be too old might be a floppy a floppy copy

[02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:14.140]
Now trying to explain to me in 50,000 words or less what it is that I'm looking at here

[02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:18.440]
It's Mo on all fours wearing the lampshade that the dogs wear to keep

[02:47:19.180 --> 02:47:21.580]
If you would have told me to turn it sideways

[02:47:24.340 --> 02:47:26.320]
Now I get it oh

[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:28.680]
My god

[02:47:30.440 --> 02:47:35.540]
And guess what he's saying gang rape is funny. Yeah, and just as it is about to get it in the

[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.140]
Back to him in the eight is not exactly naked. He is wearing panties and a collar

[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:45.840]
Yeah, he's where I have one of those things at home. I guess I probably schmid-candid then panties

[02:47:45.840 --> 02:47:49.880]
I can one of those things that you put over around a dog's neck would I to keep it from biting itself?

[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:51.300]
I was like lampshade things. Yeah

[02:47:55.160 --> 02:47:59.840]
Well, at least now that he's got that on around his head. He can't look behind and see who it is back there, you know

[02:47:59.920 --> 02:47:59.920]

[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:07.660]
Think it pretends it's anybody. There you go could be Doreen. Oh, no, that wouldn't be good

[02:48:07.660 --> 02:48:09.740]
I forgot about that. Well, he had a little problem with her too

[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:15.260]
5 6 7 0 5 6 6 6 you are pulled day at disaster all on putting them are always pulled together right now

[02:48:15.260 --> 02:48:18.720]
It says our last movie pool for now

[02:48:20.300 --> 02:48:24.080]
And then we'll make a list of the ones who have been talking about the last month or so whatever it's been

[02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:26.480]
It's been too long too many movies too much

[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:34.460]
Neil shows on movies are ponderous effing ponderous 125 people say that out of 367 34%

[02:48:34.460 --> 02:48:36.380]
ponderous they hate it

[02:48:36.380 --> 02:48:39.080]
There's there's spitting right at their radios right now

[02:48:40.100 --> 02:48:41.740]
Getting boring 68

[02:48:42.520 --> 02:48:44.900]
How much are Rick the mailman's already shut it off?

[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:52.700]
Okay 66 good 58 and great a breath of fresh year only 52

[02:48:52.700 --> 02:48:54.760]
Oh, I

[02:48:54.760 --> 02:48:58.860]
Don't think in the history of the show we've ever had such negative response to anything that we've tried to do

[02:48:58.860 --> 02:49:00.680]
Have we can you think of anything I'm thinking I

[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:07.760]
Mean I can't imagine anything that ever talked about or tried to get into that we've ever had such

[02:49:07.760 --> 02:49:11.160]
I mean now granted the two months we did on a harness racing drivers names

[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:14.440]
That was you know, that was kind of marginal. Oh, I kind of like that. Yeah

[02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:18.060]
This was really depressing

[02:49:19.620 --> 02:49:22.040]
These people would know William Brennan from Georgie Brennan

[02:49:23.260 --> 02:49:30.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line and like I said, I'm still gonna watch Maggoda sometime this afternoon or tonight

[02:49:30.380 --> 02:49:32.840]
No hockey game today. I thought I would watch it anyway

[02:49:32.840 --> 02:49:36.080]
In fact the next game ain't until Thursday. You see that they got a two-day L.A.

[02:49:36.140 --> 02:49:42.720]
Oh, yeah, they got a fly all the way back to Jersey now for game five and probably John Madden the hockey player

[02:49:42.720 --> 02:49:45.080]
He's as much of a pussy as the a football guy

[02:49:45.740 --> 02:49:49.160]
One of them won't fly and one of them don't want to come here because he's afraid he's gonna die

[02:49:50.780 --> 02:49:53.260]
Shmuck stay out of here John Madden you're an asshole

[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:55.720]
I'm talking about the hockey guy

[02:49:56.340 --> 02:49:59.640]
Here's Hollywood hello, hey Neil. Yes, sir the

[02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:04.100]
The movie talk is a little ponderous, but I want to contribute anyway

[02:50:04.100 --> 02:50:09.300]
I really think about the psychology of this call

[02:50:09.300 --> 02:50:17.300]
I really like almost all of the movies you've talked about it is a strange coincidence that it would be an exception of legends of the mall

[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:23.460]
Yeah, that was about it. It was very compared to these other ones. Oh not even in the same league

[02:50:23.460 --> 02:50:30.160]
No, first I want to add a movie that I think you really should see I know you like it. It's called funny games

[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:36.000]
And it's a German movie don't let that scare you off. It's subtitled it

[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.640]
But it's not it's not like a sued movie that you wouldn't like he would definitely like it

[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:43.060]
I wait, but let me make my list here. I got beautiful mind

[02:50:43.060 --> 02:50:52.720]
Vestin show and what's the name of this one funny games? Okay, okay, you got to say it's a chilling chilling movie. Oh, I like those right it kind of like

[02:50:52.720 --> 02:50:55.360]
In the same way that happiness is

[02:50:57.700 --> 02:51:02.020]
Magnolia I really like Magnolia a lot. I think you'll love Jason Robard

[02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:04.180]
Performance in it. He's one of my favorites

[02:51:04.180 --> 02:51:10.200]
Fantastic in it the frog thing the frog thing is like the least of the movie everyone talks about the frogs

[02:51:11.060 --> 02:51:15.120]
That's really just a small metaphor in the film not much more than that

[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:17.340]
But it gets a little

[02:51:17.880 --> 02:51:24.020]
Exactly it gets a little slow at times, but it's a good movie. You like it. Okay, that's my contribution. Okay. Thanks, paly

[02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:24.500]
All right, thanks

[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:30.060]
See now, but that's an interesting call that to me that to me right there that there

[02:51:30.900 --> 02:51:36.520]
Was fascinating because he said it's a little pond was many went into a very enthusiastic song and it's about several movies

[02:51:37.660 --> 02:51:44.020]
You see what I'm saying no, it's like an SNM thing we find it painful, but don't stop doing it hurts so good

[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:52.000]
That's what it sounded like to me. Maybe I'm just interpreting what I wanted to interpret that could be it, you know like chewing on a canker, you know how we do

[02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:58.380]
I wonder if there any of the other bedtime stories that we put on there that I ought to and I guess they all speak for themselves

[02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:04.700]
I do like the one TV news that looks local even if it's not in the New York Times from yesterday scary

[02:52:07.220 --> 02:52:09.940]
When of course to you know with the audience would say well you're in Toronto

[02:52:09.940 --> 02:52:13.720]
You know you're not down here well, but everybody knows that so I'm not pretending to be there when I'm there

[02:52:13.720 --> 02:52:16.800]
I tell you I'm there when I'm here. I tell you I'm pretty happy about it

[02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:23.520]
When viewers in Flint, Michigan turned to the Fox 66 news at 10 last Thursday night the stations resident firebrand

[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:29.740]
Mark Hyman was at the ready to serve up some passionate punditry black Asian and Hispanic seniors are graduating from colleges

[02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:34.040]
The spring and ethically themed ceremonies that are out of bounds for whites, Mr

[02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:39.420]
Hyman the stations commentator invade before passing the cameras attention back to his colleagues on the Flint news team

[02:52:39.420 --> 02:52:46.580]
He added segregated ceremonies have no place in America's college campuses if mr. Hyman's tan looked out a place in central

[02:52:46.580 --> 02:52:52.060]
Michigan or as commentary seemed ill suited to a city with large population minority groups. There was good reason

[02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:53.060]
Mr

[02:52:53.060 --> 02:52:59.020]
Hyman was actually in a studio just outside Baltimore not sharing a set with the Flint news team as he does most nights

[02:52:59.020 --> 02:53:04.780]
Mr. Hyman also addressed the audiences of local news programs in cities across the country including Pittsburgh

[02:53:04.780 --> 02:53:09.040]
Oklahoma City and Rochester from right where he sat in Hunt Valley, Maryland

[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:10.760]
Mr

[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:19.560]
Hyman is part of a national team of anchors commentators and weathercasters that when plans are complete will report for all 62 TV stations owned by

[02:53:19.560 --> 02:53:21.220]
Sinclair Broadcast Group

[02:53:21.220 --> 02:53:24.740]
Sinclair calls it central casting to the company

[02:53:24.740 --> 02:53:30.280]
It's an efficient way to cut the cost of local journalism bringing news to small stations that otherwise would go without

[02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:37.180]
But to opponents of that proposal before the FCC to loosen media ownership rules the Senate Maryland is a frightening sign

[02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:39.800]
Of things to come and here you go

[02:53:39.800 --> 02:53:44.240]
You can read more on our website near Rogers dot com also. Let's get those hot couples of pictures in here

[02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:49.040]
Will you jeez we got some nice prizes there including prize number three, which we have an announcement

[02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:51.300]
But which which we will worth quite a few bucks

[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:55.960]
You're just creeping and crawling in what we got two entries three

[02:53:56.820 --> 02:54:02.280]
Four we do have three I've only seen the one and we would prefer the topless version of those folks. They look good pretty good

[02:54:02.280 --> 02:54:07.640]
Yeah, well the topless version will certainly get a lot more response on our website and if they're little punky kids out there

[02:54:07.640 --> 02:54:09.200]
They'd see some nipples too bad, you know

[02:54:10.040 --> 02:54:15.140]
We give you an advanced warning once in a while you might see something a little bit not x-rated, but what would you call it?

[02:54:15.980 --> 02:54:18.980]
X-rated PG-13 there you go

[02:54:19.660 --> 02:54:26.700]
On our website there might be a nipple a no maybe even like a hint of a penis kind of like what I got a hint of a penis

[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:41.300]
I missed alive now what the hell was it only buried in the middle oh well wait a minute since since when just a moment

[02:54:42.440 --> 02:54:44.900]
Since when do we put a live spot?

[02:54:45.960 --> 02:54:52.200]
Remember we're shopping in a great gold. I've been a part of you grow back there. There's things going on don't ask questions

[02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:58.960]

[03:00:03.940 --> 03:00:04.540]

I'm just mentioning that and passing. I don't want to know you know you don't need to come here

You know, it's it's amazing how many of these so-called macho jocks, you know the guys that take showers together

[03:01:00.300 --> 03:01:03.440]
How many of them are like afraid of flying and

[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:06.920]
How can this yeah all kinds of crafts seriously?

[03:01:08.200 --> 03:01:13.040]
And of course there are all the people listen to this the sports segments on the station would tell you oh no

Like me that flew like right shortly after 9-11 and it does all the time without any panic or hysteria whatsoever

[03:01:26.940 --> 03:01:30.460]
Lives right here part of the time like in the middle of this SARS-infested

[03:01:31.260 --> 03:01:35.200]
You know they opened up a new about the Eden Center at the big shopping mall downtown

[03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:45.940]
A block where they have like a park and all kinds of stuff and like an outdoor abanshell

[03:01:45.940 --> 03:01:53.940]

[03:02:02.460 --> 03:02:02.940]
Yeah

[03:02:02.940 --> 03:02:12.000]
Yeah, they know that

[03:02:17.560 --> 03:02:22.340]
More people die from fat from the food that they sell you in a grocery store than will ever die from marijuana

[03:02:22.900 --> 03:02:27.640]
Yeah, and you know that the bomb was just legalized but also they're showing the uh England and Canada

[03:02:28.420 --> 03:02:32.660]
The what the bomb was just joined England and Canada they legalized it

[03:02:34.260 --> 03:02:35.780]
They're more hamidens

[03:02:38.840 --> 03:02:41.740]
Okay, here's a great thing man go take some English car

[03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:48.420]
Oh, can you understand what that he was saying? No, he was talking with like a little bit too heavy of a pet twa for yours truly

[03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:49.760]
I don't understand those guys

[03:02:49.760 --> 03:02:55.040]
The Bahamas just legalized the work away. Well, they didn't legalize anything here. They're talking about decriminalizing

[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:57.360]
They they're debating and they will be for the end of the year

[03:02:57.800 --> 03:03:01.760]
They'll pass in the laws and they'll make it like a traffic ticket and of course they won't enforce it

[03:03:03.020 --> 03:03:05.100]
And they're gonna let you have like up to 20 joints

[03:03:05.960 --> 03:03:08.800]
That should be enough really for free like crossing the road

[03:03:08.800 --> 03:03:10.060]
No, not for free you gotta get it

[03:03:10.060 --> 03:03:12.780]
Which you're not supposed to be able to buy which is this the thing the whole thing

[03:03:12.780 --> 03:03:16.780]
But that again comes from Washington DC where they made him an offer they couldn't refuse

[03:03:17.400 --> 03:03:22.580]
Oh, that's right. We're gonna like put a tour and we went as soon as the mad counting happened in Alberta right away to US

[03:03:22.580 --> 03:03:24.780]
Oh, we're not allowing anymore Canadian beef to be imported

[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:31.160]
Yeah, I see the bushes getting even now with the froggy with crutch n

[03:03:31.940 --> 03:03:34.080]
We're gonna teach you about bastards the thing or two

[03:03:35.960 --> 03:03:41.520]
And guess what everybody still got a big smile in their puts people in a good mood people polite having a wonderful life

[03:03:43.320 --> 03:03:44.540]
largely stress-free

[03:03:45.900 --> 03:03:46.880]
But getting fat

[03:03:47.600 --> 03:03:51.180]
See it's one thing America does really well as they export their poison really well

[03:03:51.740 --> 03:03:51.980]
Good

[03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:55.000]
Well, that's right. What should everybody help be healthy?

[03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:59.200]
Well, I shouldn't the rest of the world stay alive and the Americans you know die early from fat

[03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:02.540]
That briar's score ice cream sure sounds good to me, you know

[03:04:03.500 --> 03:04:03.900]
man

[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:06.380]
Now you can get that

[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:11.000]
No, thanks. It's not like my talking about Nestle's turtle, which you can't get there pretty much

[03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:16.120]
It's something that everybody can get briars score ice cream. Well, you know more and more score

[03:04:16.120 --> 03:04:17.940]
for the poor

[03:04:18.720 --> 03:04:21.960]
Well, no, that's not a bad meal a half gallon of ice cream. That's a meal

[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:28.760]
I bet you can eat only one right. No, I am really I really could eat that see

[03:04:28.760 --> 03:04:32.660]
I should probably shouldn't admit that but I will because I'm a fat slum. I can eat the whole half gallon

[03:04:33.520 --> 03:04:37.940]
So I finally reach a point if I ever do that which I'm hopefully never buy another one

[03:04:37.940 --> 03:04:40.800]
But if I ever you know, I get to a point and I say to myself

[03:04:40.800 --> 03:04:46.620]
I realize that more and more of this is disappearing because it it doesn't seem you know if he heated up

[03:04:46.620 --> 03:04:49.920]
And you were yeah, you can eat it with a spoon almost like drink it

[03:04:50.360 --> 03:04:56.240]
And it gets nice and soft in the ice cream too and it doesn't seem like you're eating that much in terms of volume

[03:04:56.240 --> 03:04:59.060]
Follow what I'm saying because you're just sitting there watching your movie

[03:04:59.060 --> 03:05:03.740]
Magnolia or whatever and you're shoveling it down and it's delicious. It's sweet. It's uh, you know

[03:05:03.740 --> 03:05:06.940]
The pleasure center of your brain is just doing a fat dance

[03:05:08.240 --> 03:05:15.640]
And then so I have to get up and rush to the sink and turn on hot water and pour it over whatever the remains are it toss it in the track

[03:05:16.020 --> 03:05:21.420]
I was that sad or what yeah, it is but but I'm being honest with you. It's true

[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:27.060]
Now, why can't they make it like in in at least pines you know at least who would say this

[03:05:27.060 --> 03:05:31.300]
I say a lot of good things for Ben and Jerry's because they're great guys great environmentalists great

[03:05:31.300 --> 03:05:33.860]
They're just great people even though they sold the company

[03:05:35.100 --> 03:05:41.840]
But at least they make their ice cream in pines, okay? Right. Can you imagine a half gallon of fish food? I think that could be the last supper

[03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:48.060]
I think that was what they had for Passover the Jesus had the last supper. I don't think ever gotten able to cross

[03:05:48.060 --> 03:05:50.880]
I think it was the half a gallon of Ben and Jerry's fish food

[03:05:51.400 --> 03:05:53.660]
And you notice the fish is the symbol right

[03:05:54.200 --> 03:05:55.300]
See that uh-huh

Iran's next baby, look out, we're coming.

[03:08:49.740 --> 03:08:52.000]
147 at 560 WTQAM.

[03:08:54.300 --> 03:08:56.280]
I guess we'll just, you know,

[03:08:56.380 --> 03:08:58.000]
The whole we knew tomorrow would just be a compilation.

[03:08:58.500 --> 03:09:00.440]
Like I said last year, for weeks that we've talked about.

[03:09:00.900 --> 03:09:02.320]
We're not going through the old movies,

[03:09:02.320 --> 03:09:04.200]
Like The Godfather and Kuku's next.

[03:09:04.480 --> 03:09:05.560]
I mean, we've already done that stuff.

[03:09:05.660 --> 03:09:06.980]
This is different, right?

[03:09:07.580 --> 03:09:07.700]
Right?

[03:09:08.240 --> 03:09:12.960]
Because the idea was to discover like a lot of new and interesting and stuff that we never heard of,

[03:09:13.120 --> 03:09:14.900]
Or never saw, or never thought to look at.

[03:09:15.040 --> 03:09:16.220]
Right? That was what it was all about.

[03:09:16.220 --> 03:09:17.220]
Go to lunch, George.

[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:20.820]
What the was that?

[03:09:21.080 --> 03:09:21.620]
From Glenn Gary.

[03:09:22.340 --> 03:09:22.960]
It's Kevin Spacy.

[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:24.300]
Oh, yeah, right.

[03:09:24.600 --> 03:09:25.260]
Poor George.

[03:09:25.500 --> 03:09:25.680]
Yeah.

[03:09:26.440 --> 03:09:27.940]
Couldn't get him out of the guy to him office.

[03:09:28.100 --> 03:09:29.520]
He was, he was full of them.

[03:09:29.580 --> 03:09:29.980]
Go to lunch, George.

[03:09:30.740 --> 03:09:30.960]
Go to lunch.

[03:09:31.440 --> 03:09:32.400]
He shows on, shut up.

[03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:34.940]
Neil shows on movies are we asked on a pool today and what a,

[03:09:34.980 --> 03:09:36.500]
It's like slapping yourself in the face.

[03:09:38.200 --> 03:09:40.100]
437 votes and a negative response.

[03:09:40.100 --> 03:09:42.160]
I mean, it's just phenomenal, remarkable.

[03:09:42.620 --> 03:09:42.960]
Shocking.

[03:09:45.180 --> 03:09:48.960]
Ponderous, effing Ponderous 153, 35% right on the nose.

[03:09:49.400 --> 03:09:53.340]
Said that the movie shows are effing Ponderous, getting boring 78.

[03:09:54.980 --> 03:09:56.020]
Okay, 77.

[03:09:57.240 --> 03:09:59.900]
Good, 67 and great, a breath of fresh air.

[03:10:01.380 --> 03:10:02.420]
Only 62.

[03:10:03.640 --> 03:10:06.680]
Stale, we should also put on their stale as last year's hall of a.

[03:10:06.920 --> 03:10:07.460]
That would have been good.

[03:10:10.720 --> 03:10:13.540]
56670560, pound 560 on the 18 and team of a rising line.

[03:10:13.860 --> 03:10:16.500]
And the man dog today, Brian Greasy or Jay Feeder, what do you think?

[03:10:16.660 --> 03:10:17.020]
Oi!

[03:10:17.580 --> 03:10:18.460]
Call them up and ask.

[03:10:19.540 --> 03:10:20.160]
Here's sunrise.

[03:10:20.380 --> 03:10:20.520]
Hello.

[03:10:21.140 --> 03:10:22.040]
Oh, Neil, hi.

[03:10:22.480 --> 03:10:22.820]
Yes, sir.

[03:10:23.460 --> 03:10:24.260]
You hear me okay?

[03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:24.660]
I'm sorry.

[03:10:26.140 --> 03:10:26.960]
No, you're okay.

[03:10:27.560 --> 03:10:28.960]
You sound like you.

[03:10:29.660 --> 03:10:30.220]
Oh, thanks.

[03:10:32.500 --> 03:10:38.080]
I didn't get to hear most of the show today, but I was wondering if you had a film recommended to you.

[03:10:38.720 --> 03:10:40.500]
And it's a Dutch film actually.

[03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:41.140]
Oi.

[03:10:41.620 --> 03:10:44.240]
Well, I think it was Dutch French co-production.

[03:10:45.080 --> 03:10:48.140]
And it was remade in Hollywood, horrible remake.

[03:10:48.720 --> 03:10:49.980]
It's called the vanishing.

[03:10:51.100 --> 03:10:51.880]
Oh, yeah, I've seen it.

[03:10:52.040 --> 03:10:52.580]
I've seen it.

[03:10:53.080 --> 03:10:53.560]
Oh, okay.

[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:55.440]
I just kind of a creepy film.

[03:10:55.500 --> 03:11:01.660]
I thought you might have enjoyed it because I know you're kind of down on Amsterdam right now, but you're a little familiar with the language and such.

[03:11:02.040 --> 03:11:03.660]
It was a pretty good film, I thought.

[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:07.340]
Yeah, I saw both the original and the remake and you're right through, it makes sucked.

[03:11:07.840 --> 03:11:08.820]
Oh, they have to change.

[03:11:09.020 --> 03:11:12.480]
You know, that just tells you everything that's wrong with mainstream Hollywood.

[03:11:13.420 --> 03:11:15.560]
Well, please don't say I'm down on Amsterdam now.

[03:11:16.380 --> 03:11:17.720]
I'm down on Amsterdam period.

[03:11:17.920 --> 03:11:19.600]
I mean, it's the party's over.

[03:11:20.060 --> 03:11:21.820]
I'm being now compared to before, sorry.

[03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:22.520]
Right.

[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:26.420]
I just think that movie tells you everything that's wrong with mainstream Hollywood.

[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:35.140]
A lot of the good movies you're talking about now, like Requiem for a Dream, these are like the sort of independent on the edge of Hollywood films.

[03:11:35.780 --> 03:11:39.580]
But the mainstream films are just awful, most of them.

[03:11:39.720 --> 03:11:41.840]
And that remake is an illustration why?

[03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:48.600]
I mean, the changes they make to the story to make it acceptable to, you know, the mass American audience.

[03:11:48.840 --> 03:11:50.400]
It tells you everything you need to know.

[03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:56.180]
Yeah, as soon as you started talking about that movie, I remember seeing it and then the event revamped.

[03:11:56.800 --> 03:11:56.820]
Yeah.

[03:11:57.500 --> 03:11:59.320]
Okay, well, I just didn't know if you had heard of it.

[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:00.100]
Okay, thanks.

[03:12:00.300 --> 03:12:01.500]
I like the movie shows.

[03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:02.660]
Okay, thanks.

[03:12:03.040 --> 03:12:06.460]
Here's one guy who likes the movie shows now that we're getting toward the end of the line today.

[03:12:07.320 --> 03:12:10.480]
I will say one thing about 10 to 2, sure goes by a lot faster, sure.

[03:12:11.400 --> 03:12:12.160]
Don't you think?

[03:12:12.580 --> 03:12:13.760]
I don't know why that is.

[03:12:14.700 --> 03:12:18.440]
The 9 to 1 thing was almost as ponderous as our movie shows, almost.

[03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:19.400]
Look at that.

[03:12:19.400 --> 03:12:20.660]
We got one call left on the board.

[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:22.440]
I don't think that's going to cut it, do you?

[03:12:23.040 --> 03:12:23.600]
Oh, go on.

[03:12:23.820 --> 03:12:24.700]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[03:12:24.700 --> 03:12:24.980]
Hello.

[03:12:25.800 --> 03:12:26.580]
I'm Mike Morgan.

[03:12:26.580 --> 03:12:27.760]
I'll 5.62.8.

[03:12:28.300 --> 03:12:28.940]
Mark here.

[03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:34.420]
Like I said, into the calls.

[03:12:34.780 --> 03:12:36.540]
Yeah, let's play Requiem with the rest of the show.

[03:12:39.260 --> 03:12:40.060]
5.670560.

[03:12:41.900 --> 03:12:43.900]
Hound 560 on the AT&T.

[03:12:44.040 --> 03:12:47.340]
See, once we stopped the movie stuff, I even know some more of it trickled in there.

[03:12:47.420 --> 03:12:48.860]
You know, we'd like residual it trickled.

[03:12:49.540 --> 03:12:50.460]
But that was it.

[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:51.380]
They ran out of material.

[03:12:51.380 --> 03:12:55.660]
I think bedtime stories maybe make it a comeback.

[03:12:56.220 --> 03:12:56.360]
Huh?

[03:12:56.620 --> 03:12:58.220]
Could be.

[03:12:58.740 --> 03:12:59.640]
Miguel liked it.

[03:12:59.780 --> 03:13:01.400]
I mean, I don't know.

[03:13:01.440 --> 03:13:02.740]
Hey, Miguel, you're a freaking liar.

[03:13:02.980 --> 03:13:03.620]
Okay, Annapuse.

[03:13:07.320 --> 03:13:10.340]
And Bonerbaus' Miguel's got a nasty vagina.

[03:13:11.900 --> 03:13:12.860]
Now what you said?

[03:13:13.040 --> 03:13:13.960]
He said angry vagina.

[03:13:14.520 --> 03:13:16.380]
An angry, losing vagina.

[03:13:21.040 --> 03:13:22.000]
Here's Crawl Springs.

[03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:22.340]
Hello.

[03:13:23.160 --> 03:13:23.960]
How you doing, Neil?

[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:24.820]
Okay, sir.

[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:30.400]
Listen, I love the movie talk, but you've got to stop playing that piece from a record for dreams.

[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:34.760]
That's all I hear in my head all day now.

[03:13:36.920 --> 03:13:37.340]
Yeah.

[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:41.220]
The Mexican movie, A Boris Paro.

[03:13:48.040 --> 03:13:49.380]
What is this man saying?

[03:13:49.540 --> 03:13:50.520]
Kill a music, George.

[03:13:50.860 --> 03:13:51.200]
It's a mama.

[03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:51.900]
Come being.

[03:13:52.220 --> 03:13:52.760]
Or it's a mama.

[03:13:52.880 --> 03:13:53.160]
Come being.

[03:13:53.520 --> 03:13:54.320]
Have you seen that?

[03:13:54.620 --> 03:13:54.900]
No.

[03:13:55.640 --> 03:13:56.420]
It's not a more expensive.

[03:13:58.040 --> 03:13:59.500]
You got to see these movies.

[03:13:59.660 --> 03:14:00.000]
You're Mexican.

[03:14:00.220 --> 03:14:00.780]
They're subtitles.

[03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:01.800]
Okay.

[03:14:02.460 --> 03:14:02.840]
All right.

[03:14:03.220 --> 03:14:03.920]
It's not my list.

[03:14:04.600 --> 03:14:05.280]
Much as grassy.

[03:14:06.020 --> 03:14:06.520]
Thank you.

[03:14:06.560 --> 03:14:07.380]
Take it a photo, you're ass.

[03:14:09.860 --> 03:14:11.280]
Are you starting to get hostile?

[03:14:11.460 --> 03:14:13.700]
Look at even BonaVoy's starting to throw in a few shots.

[03:14:16.700 --> 03:14:19.720]
Well, between George, pumping a music out, and I'm playing it here too.

[03:14:20.100 --> 03:14:22.960]
It's like a little bit difficult for the guy to get into one of the turd-edge-wise.

[03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:26.380]
Just jam it in the back seat.

[03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:29.640]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10.

[03:14:29.640 --> 03:14:30.660]
I'm going to watch Magnolia.

[03:14:30.800 --> 03:14:32.240]
I don't care if anybody likes it.

[03:14:32.500 --> 03:14:33.240]
It doesn't like it.

[03:14:33.300 --> 03:14:34.080]
I'm going to watch it.

[03:14:34.180 --> 03:14:34.400]
Okay.

[03:14:35.260 --> 03:14:38.300]
And you know it's a production when it's in that big fancy, schmanzy.

[03:14:38.400 --> 03:14:39.260]
It doesn't mean it's good.

[03:14:40.260 --> 03:14:43.560]
But like Momento, and of course, some of these you get like the special collectors edition.

[03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:44.980]
I told you about the Momento thing.

[03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:48.960]
It had all the, like, just a whole bunch of bizarre stuff when you open it up.

[03:14:50.060 --> 03:14:52.240]
And there's one disc I haven't had a chance to look at yet.

[03:14:52.260 --> 03:14:53.380]
It's got a second disc.

[03:14:54.240 --> 03:14:58.200]
You know, with all the directors crap and all the extraneous, it's a whole separate disc in there,

[03:14:58.260 --> 03:14:59.260]
which I haven't even looked at yet.

[03:15:00.300 --> 03:15:01.760]
Well, I guess I forgot to look at it.

[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:10.200]
And the most, you know, the one thing I learned today, because I never really knew there was such a word.

[03:15:10.340 --> 03:15:14.000]
I must confess, what's they have Mentos, right?

[03:15:14.300 --> 03:15:15.340]
Yeah, the Fresh Maker.

[03:15:15.620 --> 03:15:17.700]
Those fresh, you're immense Mentos.

[03:15:17.820 --> 03:15:19.900]
And there's like Momento with an MO.

[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:22.900]
But there's also like the name of the movie is like, I don't know.

[03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:25.800]
Like I said, I'll write it on my ankle.

[03:15:25.800 --> 03:15:27.820]
I am local.

[03:15:28.400 --> 03:15:30.560]
I'm your sports radio 560, she way.

[03:15:30.780 --> 03:15:31.800]
You AM.

[03:15:34.700 --> 03:15:38.960]
A mob the stove can make an evening gown from paper towels.

[03:15:39.460 --> 03:15:42.720]
Cuts a credit cost to line us with improved.

[03:15:43.800 --> 03:15:49.620]
But according to House Boy Rowell, she is downright cruel.

[03:15:51.460 --> 03:15:59.300]
And even with your screaming benchy, from Connecticut, throw it all to these walls, she makes a chocolate chip.

[03:16:00.140 --> 03:16:06.300]
She makes collagen for her own lips out of onion dips.

[03:16:08.420 --> 03:16:13.860]
Mother Stuart, you seem so nice on my TV.

[03:16:16.340 --> 03:16:24.360]
But your smile is just a mask so we can see your personality.

[03:16:25.840 --> 03:16:28.860]
Once I saw her make an airing out of cottage cheese.

[03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:32.860]
She gives a bucket wine quilt to do her cross stitch.

[03:16:34.080 --> 03:16:40.120]
I didn't be half a million so damn rich, but she's such a bitch.

[03:16:41.960 --> 03:16:48.180]
Mother Stuart, how come you don't pay off your bills?

[03:16:49.840 --> 03:16:59.280]
You're like states and dress in sats and with your fluffy hats and frilly frills.

[03:16:59.420 --> 03:17:03.000]
Making scones with both she got a bitter own backyard.

[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:06.580]
With a laptop as she built herself a deck.

[03:17:07.580 --> 03:17:14.060]
Better watch yourself around that rack or she'll snap your neck.

[03:17:15.480 --> 03:17:23.500]
In her attic she remodels using pastry, where she sits and makes her own designer shirts.

[03:17:24.260 --> 03:17:27.140]
Now Martha's getting just desserts.

[03:17:28.620 --> 03:17:30.300]
I guess that's true, hurts.

[03:17:37.040 --> 03:17:39.980]
I've had to remind her of myself and my ankle like I promised.

[03:17:40.200 --> 03:17:42.140]
I looked down during a break, you know what I said in my ankle?

[03:17:42.320 --> 03:17:42.460]
What?

[03:17:43.140 --> 03:17:44.500]
Rhyr is score ice cream.

[03:17:44.520 --> 03:17:44.900]
Oh no!

[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:47.180]
Don't believe this lie.

[03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:50.360]
Jack G. Killed your wife.

[03:17:51.180 --> 03:17:51.680]
John G.

[03:17:51.780 --> 03:17:52.140]
I beg your pardon?

[03:17:52.600 --> 03:17:53.460]
John G. Killed your wife.

[03:17:55.260 --> 03:17:56.180]
Don't believe petty.

[03:17:56.740 --> 03:17:57.460]
Sammy Dickens.

[03:17:57.560 --> 03:17:58.560]
Don't believe petty's lies.

[03:17:58.760 --> 03:17:59.560]
Remember Sam Dickens.

[03:18:05.720 --> 03:18:07.220]
Come on, answer the phone.

[03:18:09.000 --> 03:18:10.680]
See there's one for this show actually.

[03:18:10.800 --> 03:18:11.780]
It might be a long time ago.

[03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:13.140]
Don't answer the phone.

[03:18:13.180 --> 03:18:14.280]
That's it that one I'm not.

[03:18:15.340 --> 03:18:16.760]
That's what I mean, but you're either.

[03:18:21.360 --> 03:18:25.340]
Mad Dog is next, the Humper from New York in a bell log which is coming up Saturday.

[03:18:25.640 --> 03:18:27.740]
Funny as side will win a triple crown by 10 lengths.

[03:18:28.180 --> 03:18:28.480]
You'll see.

[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:32.300]
Mad Dog at two, Hank at four from New York.

[03:18:32.580 --> 03:18:35.000]
Six thirty if the Amarlands undecided, the unmentioned one won.

[03:18:35.240 --> 03:18:38.380]
The Oakland A's in Amarlands at the 705 and IPP part.

[03:18:38.560 --> 03:18:39.100]
No interest.

[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:40.380]
Don't talk about it.

[03:18:40.720 --> 03:18:43.940]
Any came who's on a virgin win in millions, if the ducks win a Stanley Cup.

[03:18:44.340 --> 03:18:47.160]
Any came 10, join Mark overnight, 2 to 5 at an a.m.

[03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:52.920]
Oh!

[03:19:00.120 --> 03:19:01.080]
That's nobody else.

[03:19:01.640 --> 03:19:04.600]
Bye, bye, bye!

[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:09.420]
The new weather show on 516 will need to be added by an e-for-mortar data.

[03:19:09.540 --> 03:19:13.600]
I don't care how many take out any what grease ball gum bars come out on a woodware.
