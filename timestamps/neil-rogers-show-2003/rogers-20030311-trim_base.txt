[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]
Well, so listen now you're picking on that guy yet some interesting points about Mo

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.220]
5 6 7 0 5 you got that down Carlos

[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.880]
Poor Carlos he came in late today because he had to pick up his illegal alien nephew

[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.180]
But the raft come in yeah, it was gonna deport him. Oh, he actually took him back down to the raft to long drive to the keys

[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.560]
you know and

[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.580]
They're doing a little whitewater rafting this weekend

[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.920]
And so he comes in like just before 9 o'clock and we got eight million bedtime stories on there

[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.820]
Which probably aren't even on there yet. I would imagine are they half of the more and the other the rest of them will be up in about 30 seconds

[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.080]
Yeah, let me take a look. I don't see any of them

[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.000]
Now I see all the old stuff from my yesterday

[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.240]
Refresh here very there. Well, just relax. I'm just looking at it. I need to bust your balls a little bit. Okay, if we could find any

[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:55.720]
This is the only guy like we told you to wash his balls in the sink at the QAM 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T of a rise in line

[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.860]
We've got double barrels today man. We got like

[00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.560]
Cooper the price of one

[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.700]
One thing you can say about this show whether they like it or hate it the price continues to be right

[00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.080]
Nice checking the back yesterday by the way here's Pember Pines hello

[00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.360]
Pember Pines yes, hello, yes sir

[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.800]
Two things Mo comment but first for your poll

[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.940]
Feelings by Morris. Oh

[00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.220]
That's the first one that came to my mind that could be the winner right there

[00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.480]
No, there's a more Albert more Albert. Oh my god. I wanted somebody else to say that. That's one everybody like

[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.180]
Mox did you know? Oh, it's just grotesque they killed it. Yeah, they butchered it. Well, I wasn't that good in the first place

[00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.100]
Right also the mode comment is the problem with him is he thinks is he's the ultimate authority on everything

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.060]
Mm-hmm. That's awful. In other words, he talks down to the audience is what you're saying exactly. Thank you, sir

[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.820]
I think he had a stomach on it don't you he's a little bit condescending

[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.520]
You know, I'm saying a little bit condescending maybe he ought to lighten up just a little bit not be quite so goddamn

[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.140]
My dogmatic about everything if you hear my grip. Oh, okay

[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.160]
Feelings by Morris Albert boy. Look at took us a long time on our and plus to give that one that came to my mind

[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.340]
But wow that's gonna give Debbie Boone and you let up my life a real round and now this is one we will put this on our love

[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.040]
Okay, because we were already battered mo pretty good

[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.060]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.860]
Breaded and battered. Hey listen. Why let me say this mo

[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:27.020]
You can't you can't point it. I only wish that the other people on a radio station would talk about me and about this show as much as we talk about him

[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.480]
Okay, believe me once in a great while. I mean tank does fairly regular in fact

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.400]
Hank even talked about the the city's pool we did last week remember that the one day

[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.800]
Yeah, and the mad dog he picked up on the the one about the hot looking chicks and he said all grace Kelly

[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.940]
Too pristine looking for me, you know, what is that all about? I don't know is there such a thing?

[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.360]
I don't know that's it. Yeah, he likes to slurp. I mean Brittany's a slut, but she's pristine looking yeah

[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.740]
So you don't have to be like slutty looking but I guess if anybody likes red of on brown

[00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.740]
I mean what is there's another reason he might not like Grace Kelly and what's that I'm a homo

[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.640]
I know not Hank didn't say that mad dog. Oh, I'm sorry Jesus. Oh, yeah

[00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.160]
I'm walking out I am walking out ladies and gentlemen. I'm leaving

[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.560]
What are you trying to do here today you just just

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.960]
No, I said Hank picked up the pool we did on the cities on the grade the most overrated city

[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.400]
Well, we don't have a drop of managed saying that well

[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.420]
We have something

[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.460]
We must we haven't saying everything else we haven't say every other guy did I hear it is way man

[00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.640]
Like naked guy there. There you go. That's man. It's junior. That's not the real one. It's Scotty Mac

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.520]
Yeah, man. It's so to speak and then I want to bang in the butt honey. See that could be construed when he was talking

[00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.900]
Anyway, 28th

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.160]
I mean we got everything we got 75 million of these in here no matter what it is we even got Joe Rose

[00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.400]

[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.780]
Ugly bald spot make this deer that you get your hair back and we're talking about great looking here

[00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.020]
Look on a QA website take a look at Mo on his anniversary and oh my god. You're just crap your pants

[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.100]
But the answer is not the some mouse you look in here piece not some dead animal on your top of your head

[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.980]
Not holes drilled in your head not dangerous pills that make you sick and don't go one follicle back

[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.400]
But Charles Alphier is natural hairline system

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.260]

[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.260]
And that's what it's all about we say natural hairline because it looks like the hair is really grown out of your scalp instead of some

[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.460]
Grotesque silly straw that somebody laid on your head like a straw hat

Charlie also services and repairs all kinds of hair systems while you wait for only

You have nothing to lose but that ball spot because Charlie has that 30 day guarantee if you were to hair for 30 days

[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.160]
And don't love the way it looks and feels and smells if you're not getting laid at least five 10 15 20 times a day

Air Force officials more in Florida panhandle residents of test and a gigantic explosion

[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.500]
So if you're a big bomb you'll know that the world isn't coming to win and we don't think

[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.280]
How do you like that?

[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.100]
Makes sense that they're gonna drop it on Florida up in a pan out of which we shouldn't be making fun of that

[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.420]
Because probably we got people listening who got kids going to fs and you

They'd like to try out some new things if they can make it work

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.520]
This one looks like it's gonna be first in line

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.120]
If they can make it work and if there's like a little uh if they're off a few miles

[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.780]
There goes the state capital

[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:37.520]
390 votes a stellar turnout a disaster the worst 144 36.9 percent

[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:39.280]

Okay, I do listen 37 and outstanding and it is mild like Chesterfield Queens and it's changing. I'm stalling out 12

[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.120]

[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.620]

Yeah, in the spot where those songs are all hiding. Oh, it's nothing nice if you could selectively go away

Oh, it's just it's an awful awful thing. It's a horrible. No, you're wrong me. That's a lot of fun

Hey, hey, you know, we do hey, yeah, right

[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:27.960]
How did people ever enjoy a sporting event without all this contrived bull crap, you know?

[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.740]
Probably because the sporting event was a lot better back then the year

[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.720]
Yeah without without 14 beers 10 41 at 5 60 WQM another year is coming gone

[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:20.600]
Hmm. You know, it's amazing because Mo did say this morning. He has no detractors outside the radio station

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.340]
Only when he walks through that door when he walks through the door

[00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:27.640]
That's when all the problems call the negativity, but outside he don't have any detractors

[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:32.760]
Mm-hmm. I guess he ain't talking to the same people that I'm hearing from but anyway or that you're talking to or anybody else

[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:33.660]

You're having a tough time with it. Shannon by Henry Groce

[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.360]
Y'all Shannon really I don't know her that these things about a dog that's gotten lost out to see and he's crying and whaling and complaining

[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:15.080]
Oh my god. Want to buy some stock? No, come on. How lots of a shithrich

[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.360]

I forgot building a buttercup by the foundations. Oh my god

[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:55.600]
Boy nauseating the most annoying song of all time and of course you can thank the radio stations

[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.000]
The one-dimensional stations for making songs even more annoying than they really are

[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.920]
In other words a lot of these songs if you just heard them a few times

[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.580]
It's just another song, you know, I'm sure take it or leave it

[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:11.680]
Like Blue Velvet by Bobbi and Vincent. I can leave it. Mm-hmm blue velvet. There's nobody plays that anymore. Thank god

[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:15.100]
Find a wheel and it goes round

[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.280]
Huh pretty annoying Perry Como

[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.060]
Perry freaking Como who was living up there in Volka

[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:25.500]

[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:31.040]
What is he good for a dead guy? Yeah, get rid of him

[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:34.100]

Wanted I can't go until four o'clock so I'd like to say something about four hours and that is

[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:54.700]

[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:59.460]
Don't know where the hell was he what line was he on?

[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.440]
Well, whatever whatever it is too late now see when he hesitate like that

[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:09.300]
I got a real a real itchy finger man. I like the the Duke and itchy finger. He's still in I need I got him back

[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.100]
Oh, he is online a. Okay. Well excuse me very much sir, but I like to be quick, you know

[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.160]
Oh, I saw you

[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:20.360]
Again, I can't go to your truck lock so my boat for both Howard and yeah, yeah

[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:25.860]
And the most annoying songs that I think of is by Bob in the experience that so

[00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.520]
Glory be happy we got it. Thank you very much sir. Thank you and try to keep your lunch down

[00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:38.740]
Oh my god, so I have to make you want to go down and blow up the whole island

[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.800]
Yeah, yeah, in fact, why don't they test those I shouldn't say that that's bad

[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.480]
We got a lot of listeners over there in the islands, but they are gonna be dropping a gigantic bomb

[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.260]
And it will not be a test

[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.680]
Do that a Puerto Rico. What do you people in the Bahamas payback is a bitch?

[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.740]
That's right ripping off all the Americans treat us like crap

[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:00.060]
Taking all of our harder and money and just gouging the crap out of the American public

[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:04.080]
Just because we live in the antithol state where we can't have gambling the way we like

[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.260]
But you're looting. Oh, there's being a lunatic. There's public for it. I said earlier

[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.900]
Punishment's worse than death. Yeah

[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.440]
hahaha

[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.720]
Oh, that was excellent. That was almost

[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.360]
Not quite but it was almost as good as amtrak

[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.060]
567 05 60 pound 5 60 we're getting to the end on this first pole here

[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:28.580]
You know, I'm thinking maybe we ought to start doing this every day

[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.360]
Do like kind of a programming oriented

[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.460]
Topical yom sand yeah like a current the kind of a thing

[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.600]
Like who do we despise today the most kind of a pull and then like build on the other one right

[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.380]
And this seems to be in spite of the pull we took last week when they said they hated this like poison

[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.680]
At least it lilylis it's a phenomenal response

[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.260]
That's all we care about we don't care if listeners are like plucking her eyeballs out with her fingers

[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:55.080]
We don't care about that do we know

[00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.060]
We want to make it like nice and easy. We want to do a cop out like that bitch says. It's a cop out

[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.900]
It's uh, you know, we're too lazy to do the other stuff

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.240]
Is not what it is well, it'd be nice if we got some real calls that said something but

[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.120]
Right so what's the point what's the point of beating our heads against the brick-friccad wall try to change the world

[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.440]
Which we're not gonna do when we're talking to a bunch of people that don't want that in the first place

[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.660]
They could listen to Randy. She's gonna save the world

[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.640]
There you go. Are they gonna listen to lardass? He's gonna make up a bunch of right-wing crap

[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:29.700]
When I'm interested. Oh, I look at this. Moe is doing such a nice job here toward the end as he's cutting it down under

[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:34.080]
37% now 36.6% saying it is after the worst

[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:42.800]
He started out like almost 40% and he's brought that number down to a very disrespectable 36.6% out of 443 votes

[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.840]
Do you realize that we're gonna come close and I kind of do it by 11?

[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.940]
We're gonna come close to 500 votes in two hours and then an hour and 40 minutes

[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.080]
Aren't you shocked yet?

[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.120]
I'm amazed at the power of Moe if he could get numbers as big as this

[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.020]
We really have something going on in this station

[00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:09.220]
Only got seven minutes to go on the mole pool. So you better get with it. Okay. I need your Raju's dot com hop on it

[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.620]
Here's a call from beautiful West Palm Beach. Oh

Really yeah, we need to bring back D so I think that there's a lot of rumors about that you know

[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:38.340]
Like a man don't always says if they just crack out of there get the checkbook out make it nice check

[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.260]
Yeah, there you go um and for your song poll I just think that anything by Michael Bolton makes me vomit

[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.420]

But you guys keep holding back on air because you want to make him look bad. Yeah

That people should have been pissed off and fired up about but uh

Luminately at all they don't give a flying crap and that's why uh, you know

Went from rock to country can't you tell

[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:43.660]
I ain't seen my new agent in three damn days

[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.500]
Oh

[00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.560]
Been fueling up on cocaine and whiskey

Cuz I've lowered myself to this to you blame me

[00:40:56.940 --> 00:41:02.540]
Lord if this last another year I'll be amazed

[00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:07.180]
I'm trying to stay away

[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.520]
Oh

A

[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:21.780]
I just can't look at you while I'm trying to sing this song

[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:27.620]
I hate to be out of place

[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.080]
But I can't stand your face

[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:41.000]
I just can't look at you while I'm trying to sing this song

[00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.760]
Can I have to level with you as well

[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.060]
Looking at you let me say you look like hell

[00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.740]
Whatever you've been snorting or dropping just

[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.780]
Just saying lines

[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.840]
You think I've been waiting a long time

[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:13.680]
To sing a song with you better think twice

[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:22.040]
Smells like you had a shower in three damn nights

[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.340]
Can we put this thing in a way

[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:31.240]
All I want is to get paid

[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.440]
I just can't look at you can't you really

[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.360]
gross me out

[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.480]
You heard I'm married to a nice piece of a

[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.240]
When she married you was she awake

[00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:04.480]
Please she don't look like two peas on a bread and board

[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.040]
Like you

[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.880]
And I don't care what you say

[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.920]
Give my little finger what to hate

[00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:23.660]
Stuck at that shpen while I don't you rotate

[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.560]
I hope you only someday

[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200]
I hope you die today

[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:43.780]
I just wanted to say I want another agent call me on the phone

[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.040]
I just wanted to say I want another agent

[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.380]
Tell me how the phone

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:58.680]
But as you were long and ponderous you know she was almost as ponderous as they are

[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:02.960]
But it gave me time to find some interesting things I did not find dexies in mid-day runners

[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:05.480]
I don't know I bought it I must have misplaced it but

[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.500]
Where's that bit come from by the way?

[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:13.820]
Where did what they come from when he just played from the 8 cm

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.960]
By the way it's 1120 and I still have no message on my machine out there

[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.080]
No package downstairs. I think they're gonna come and take you away before they're ready

[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:27.720]
Card also be full of next week doing a show

[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:34.760]
And guess what else I found all right

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:07.980]
You

[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.500]
Thank you. It took me years to figure out that that's a white guy

[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.360]
Yeah

[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:16.760]
Well the only reason you know who a lot of these people are is when you see those best of the 70s and best of the 80s

[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:19.860]
Those CD compilation things they have on TV those commercials

[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:24.480]
That's why some of those are neat and spiderweb some people out there when we did the pull on that about

[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.920]
500 years ago and also has I forget exactly which channel it is because it's on the digital cable

[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.280]
The like a VH1 rock classics or something like that where they play all that fossil rock people you never

[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.760]
Remembered existed mmm

[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.040]
It's hit and miss

[00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:56.020]
Oh

[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.660]
Work work

[00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:11.260]
On speaker turning Japanese here's the 411 on jalo's phone sex with Ben

[00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:17.660]
This is in the globe. Yeah much too long to be ditto with the right now so to speak but boy this is

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.840]
More of this bunch of crap. It's like you're still you believe us yet. No

[00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:26.000]
You believe that we're really doing it. No, you think we're gonna really get married and we're like maybe gonna

[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.220]
At least get naked. No, I don't think so. I think Matt would get really upset

[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:39.240]
560 505 60 pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Look at that the new pull is up the most annoying song of all time is was

[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:44.280]
Well, we got a lot of money already. I better cast my voter. Have you put your vote in here? No, not yet. I'm looking

[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.980]
I'm sticking with old Debbie Boone man. I'm sticking with it even though there's a lot of really good choices on here

[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:55.360]
Did we put rock and roll part two with the Gary Glitter? Yes, we did. I don't think so. I wrote it down

[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.140]
Carlos didn't write it down Carlos again once again

[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:03.320]
Just can't keep it up. He just oh, it's on the new list. He doesn't have it yet

[00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.600]
I see you guys haven't mentioned it yet. So I mean

[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:10.220]
I guess what's number one in the early voting with three votes including mine Debbie Boone

[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.200]
You blight up my life man. Oh

[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:20.460]
God they must have played that 55,000 times every god damn hour over and over and over and over in fact

[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:26.920]
You know what category I put that in that's right next to the wind beneath my wing this better middle a really syrupy the pressing

[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:35.080]
Oh just awful thing. I made you want to either blow somebody's brains out or commit sausages when you agree? Sure

[00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:37.860]
Oh, thank you much. I'll stick with my original pick

[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:40.080]
Which was when beneath my wings?

[00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:45.000]
There you go. Here's a lady in sunrise. Hello. Good morning Neil.

[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.500]
When is to you? You are worth waiting for. Let me tell you. Yes, I am

[00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:53.680]
But did you hear that reference that mall made to you about living up there in your igloo?

[00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:00.440]
Yeah, you're in your igloo well just now I was nice and toasty in here today and by the way

[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.420]
Friday at tomorrow and Friday it's gonna be 40 and Saturday 50

[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.740]
So good things I love waiting for

[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:12.920]
Yeah, the mother of all bombs the MLAB is gonna be tested here in Florida

[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.980]
So I think you're pretty wise up in your igloo up there. I had that on before it's gonna be in the panhandle right

[00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.680]
Yeah between noon and five they're gonna be dropping the big one

[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:23.060]
You are lucky to stay in your igloo

[00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:23.540]
Mm-hmm

[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:29.920]
If I could move I would too so I think you know this isn't such a paradise place

[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:31.640]
Well when you can't go any place else

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.480]
I guess maybe it is maybe that's where he's coming from

[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:36.320]
Right when you've been bounced out of just about every place else

[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.720]
Love you Neil you take care now have a great day. All right bye bye

[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:46.960]
56705 60 I cannot find to come on ilean by dexies midnight runners and I know I went out and bought it

[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:53.380]
It's here somewhere. I'll get around to it in fact let's bring back the one-hit wonders. No, that's just a joke

[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:59.860]
I mean as long as I'm here and I got these 85 billion CDs that went out and spent all that money on because I have no audio capabilities on here

[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:02.660]
And I can't steal I mean the borrall the music off of a winnix

[00:49:03.380 --> 00:49:06.340]
Like a lot of you people are doing you're not fooling us Carlos

[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:12.540]
You people aren't fooling any of us download all that music hour after hour day after day after day

[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.960]
Steam all those rallies from those poor and povered

[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:20.700]
No musicians look at Debbie Boone. She's got ten votes George. Yeah, Macarena's got six

[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.020]
Ebony and ivory but one of the Cartian Stevie. I wonder who the hell did that song is got three well

[00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:27.720]
It's the early going

[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:31.680]
You missed the first pull on Moe all I can say was wow

[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:37.840]
In fact, you know, you can look at those numbers and you can analyze them and you can turn them upside down

[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:43.240]
The message is always the same when you look at a pull like that Moe don't buy a house. Yeah, that's that's the message

[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.340]
I get out of there when you agree. Yes, you were because you're a backstabber. Yeah

[00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.120]
Now what was the exact quote he said about your just morning Carlos?

[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.980]
I don't know the exact quote but something about him breaking a

[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:59.960]
If you don't know just make one knife a real long knife in his back. Yeah, not knowing how deep George was gonna be able to stick it in

[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.060]

The show will go on

[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.880]
Ready for that? Good

[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:05.720]
A day after wanting to plug pull down a popular downtown concert mayor Manny Diaz of Manny said yesterday

[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:11.400]
He is satisfied that promoters agreed to beef up security and ban the sale of pacifiers and lollipops

[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:13.200]
At the 14 hour festival

[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.920]
That'd be like selling cough drops

[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:22.480]
Promoters of the ultra-electronic music festival scheduled for March 22nd in Bayfront Park

[01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:25.500]
agreed to pay double police presence and install double fences

[01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:29.640]
After the mayor expressed concerns about reports of rampant drug use at last year's concert

[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.340]
Promoters also said they would ban the sale of perifinalia popular among ecstasy users

[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.240]
Such as baby pacifiers

[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:38.940]
Lollipops

[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:40.460]
Are you ready for that?

[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.020]
I'm getting ill

[01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:43.500]
I absolutely want to puke

[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.780]
Oh my god

[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.800]
It's that lollipops little boy

[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.740]
The lollipops that cause ecstasy is right and the glow sticks

[01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.440]
And popsicles that supposedly enhance the drug experience

[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.040]
One lollipops little boy

[01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.280]
In case they missed it the first time

[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:03.260]
The conflict began over the weekend after Diaz sent out a news release saying he would ask the board of Bayfront Park

[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.580]
Management trust not to wish a license to the festival

[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.280]
And by the way you people all you uh

[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.660]
Uh, Shmata heads there in the convenience stores you better get those popsicles out of there

[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:14.440]
I think five to ten for sol knows isn't it

[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:19.760]
At least it said it was the first time the mayor spoke so publicly against an issue but at Mondays board meeting

[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:23.880]
Promoters said that would take measures to reduce drug use at today long music festival

[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:26.400]
Which drew nearly 30,000 fans last year

[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.200]
Diaz also attended the meeting cities happy promoters agreed to where they added safety measures

[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.860]
And said he would not try to cancel the popular or concert

[01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:35.380]
This is all about children and minors who set after the meeting

[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.840]
As he rushed home to make sure that his kid wasn't printing up anything larger than 20s

[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.360]
All right nice going mayor manny Diaz

[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.880]
She what are they going to do without those pacifiers? They might have to suck

[01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.980]
Their thumb or well, that's right. Yeah, man. Have it a creamsicle

[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:53.240]
No, no or even worse. How about a fudge sickle

[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.280]
Here's Palm Beach hello

[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:02.380]
Palm Beach Palm Beach hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, good afternoon and back to you

[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:06.500]
I got a great one for a Thai yellow ribbon. Oh excellent

[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:13.340]
How could we have forgotten that Tony or Landu who makes me want to gag just to just to think of that mustache and on

[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:15.300]
Right. Thank you, sir

[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.460]
And I do want to wish you happy anniversary

[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:25.500]
You've given a lot of years of enjoyment and pleasure to my little home. Okay. Thank you

[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.740]
Bye-bye. See there wishing me happy anniversary on most anniversary. What does that tell you?

[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.740]
Huh, sorry mo. They like me. They hate you

[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:34.760]
But there's plenty of hate me, but at least they listen

[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:39.640]
Anyway, what did he just say Thai yellow ribbon you got that done at it? That's certainly gonna get a lot of all

[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:47.780]
Thai yellow ribbon overplayed obnoxious rinky tinky kind of a sound. Oh Tony and then at goody two shoes

[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:49.400]
The Tony or landu and dawn

He's another one on inside the behind, you know

[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:59.080]
With his born again crap and all of his problems and all of his travails and his hypocrisy et cetera

[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:03.360]
Full of crap is what I'm trying to say. We don't like you Tony or landu or dawn

[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.420]
All over. We haven't met dawn yet

[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.500]

[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:44.120]
Chapter four best chapter in a book kill whitey. Yeah, I don't know if you've read that far

[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:49.700]
But probably one of the best lines in the book says the African-Americans have been on the lowest wrong of the economic ladder

[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.800]
Since the day they were beaten and dragged here and changed

[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.700]
Which is the truth? So

[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.480]

Oh my heart will go on the theme from Titanic. Oh

[01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:36.860]
That's got to go on here immediately

[01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:41.000]
She's got so many others that could make it like the power of love that was number one for four weeks

[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.460]
Because you love me was number one for six weeks which makes me just gag

[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:48.620]
It's all coming back to me now all by myself what you ought to be

The love theme from the Titanic

[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:09.900]
And too bad she was not in the ship along with Leo

[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:14.960]
The others tell Leo they try to butcher up in these new movies that he's in yet to the work

[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.040]
And now not for me doesn't because I see the previous of these movies now looking I say you know what that's Leo

[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:23.340]
And I immediately changed another channel immediately not sooner. It's still Leo no matter what they do

[01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:25.920]

Hey, somebody hit us on it makes my ears want to believe

[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:45.300]

You got it? No, you don't have Ike Tina or Ike Turner? I want to fight no more Tina Turner. Sure

That should be quite a treat for the audience especially that George tapes guy

[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.780]
Be sure and tape all the shows next week when George is on sir

[01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:25.080]
Then instead of having to be a encumbered by my annoying crap here every day

[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.780]
You can just listen to your own George tapes tonight. It's not like a winner. Sure sounds like a great idea

[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:35.740]
We got a battle going on baby. You light up my life in Debbie Boone 29 Macarena lost

So many annoying nasty songs and all you radio people you just you just destroyed us

[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.660]
You just ruined our brains were little we had left by playing these damn things over and over and over again just un-unconsciously

[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.740]
Build me a putter cup probably into into well and maybe maybe other people aren't just as unfortunate as I am every time

[01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.680]
I punch up magic and there it is over so that's your problem right there

[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:13.360]
Punching up magic right

[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:18.360]
Well, we like Rick Shaw with air magic, but we would like to punch out the PD Bob Cunningham or whatever his name is

[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.680]
Bob Hasselhoff whatever that guy's name is some of us don't dare make that mistake. Oh

Well, what what what are you gonna have on your dial really when you come down to it NPR?

[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:37.220]
That's what I'm saying man for music. We must go to Don Vito

[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.740]
For music we must go to that slot in the middle of the adash that's called a CD deck. There you go

[01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.560]
186 votes and Macarena has forged into first place. Oh see them at the forge tonight. Los Sedelrio

[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:50.740]

[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.700]
Maybe I'll check or she's real old me girl. What?

[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.300]
I guarantee you she's not any older than Peter North

[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:03.840]
And he's still squirting it squirts squirts north south all the way west

[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:06.520]
In all directions Vanessa Del Rio. Yeah

[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:17.980]
Four minutes till

[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:24.080]
Anybody that ticks lettuce in the spare time, you know, not one of your people

We're having to hear that song and when haven't you heard it most of that song was about her

[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:16.720]
Yeah

[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:18.680]
Yeah, yeah

[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.800]
Yeah, that should be on her who left the dogs out by the baha boys the baha boys

[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.340]
I remember that I remember the video but that was a stupid video and even stupider song

[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:32.560]
And the word and even stupider than that was the reaction of course of the sports nerds, you know who

[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:37.040]
loved the dogs uh who who you know oh my god we were playing it on this station

[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:39.620]

[01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.740]

Anyway to all the girls I love before holy of the greasiest and willy nelson

[01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:55.960]
What are you saying? Yeah to all the girls I love before yeah, that's there annoying like a virgin by Madonna

[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:59.260]
I don't think so and it says any songs with lyrics all night long

[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.280]
Wasn't all night long by free?

[01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:06.200]
All right now all right now all right now all night yeah

[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.980]
I see I was used to get the lyrics wrong on that song it is called all right now

[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.420]
I used to think it was all night long I don't know why listen to that song sometimes you'll see you know

[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.920]
Lionel Richie did all night long

[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.540]
But I know the song by free all right now and I mean I get out listen to anything that I'm saying sure

[01:19:21.540 --> 01:19:26.300]
Yeah as usual he's not pinging he's got his own agenda. He's got that own militant speckled agenda

[01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:31.880]
This is interesting speaking of his own agenda Bush says clap me or no EU speech what do you say to that?

[01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:33.760]
I think the answer will be no

[01:19:34.400 --> 01:19:34.840]
9

[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:35.700]
nay

[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.980]
George Bush pulled out of a speech to the European Parliament when MPs wouldn't guarantee a standing ovation

[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.760]
Senior White House officials said the president would only go to Strasbourg to talk about Iraq if he had a staged managed welcome

[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:51.840]
A source posted in negotiation said last night

[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:56.440]
President Bush agreed to his speech but insisted he get a standing ovation like if they stayed at the union address

[01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:59.880]
His people also insisted there would be no protest or heckling

[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:04.220]
I believe would be a crucial speech for Mr. Bush to make in light of the opposition to the war here

[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.500]
But unless he only gets a

[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.740]
Adulation and praise it'll never happen

[01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:13.420]
Mr. Bush's every appearance in the US's stage managed with audiences full of supporters

[01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:18.180]
It was hoped he would speak after welcome Warsaw Pact Nations the NATO and proglas November

[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:25.240]
But as refusal to speak to EU leaders face to face is seen as a key factor in the split between the US and UK coalition and the rest of Europe

[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:26.260]
How do you like that huh?

[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:28.700]
Jeez here's chronic Sean who says

[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:33.980]
He says I did get pissed off and fired up about the Michael Moore book intro with the Democrats had any balls

[01:20:33.980 --> 01:20:35.900]
They'd use the preamble for their campaign commercials

[01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:37.920]
It's too bad more such an extremist

[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.180]
Naderite because he's funny as hell and often right on right Sean

[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:42.640]
It's true that my bababa

[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:47.440]
It goes on to say yes America's obsession with handguns is pathological for example

[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:52.160]
I'm ablitting a heart tinko tree hugging liberal and I've got six of them and guns too and that's sad

[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.600]
That's very sad Sean

[01:20:54.160 --> 01:21:00.020]
One thing it's nice about here is that very very very few people have guns except the RCMP up here a

[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:04.400]
Here's his choices wonderful tonight by Eric Clapton

Rain drops fall on my freaking head by BJ Thomas

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:49.940]

[01:21:49.940 --> 01:21:52.040]
BJ time BJ Thomas a lot I like BJ's

[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:12.020]
Is we could probably put it on the pole by the police since that's who did it?

[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:18.480]
I'm all sting was with the police. Okay. I got picked up by the police. It was with it. He was the lead singer. Okay, they raised

[01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:20.700]

You only problem me and how do I come up with a great exciting fun thing like this every goddamn day, huh? Good question. Oh my god

[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:07.540]

Isn't it or is that sister's life?

[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.020]
Such a sludge

[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:34.240]
Why am I thinking it's lying family stone because it's family sister's slides like I said they did a YMC air anytime

[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:28.100]
Well chances are when you hit a button you get a song that's just as bad or down in this market exactly

[01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:33.300]
Why do you say that and she wouldn't even look at the best part of me if you could find it?

[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:38.660]
We get along fine. Me and Phyllis we're out. You went to water Nazi get along good, huh? When we run into each other very very cordial

[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:40.000]
My log

[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:49.440]
She's a real pleasant person. Okay, I just stay away from that bitch. She's a watch. She's a peach. What does that mean?

[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.280]
She's just fine

[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:52.720]
Yeah

[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:58.220]
The people who deserve it. How's that? I see what she's obnoxious to me. Well

[01:26:59.080 --> 01:26:59.980]
He got a point

[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:07.020]
12 minutes afternoon at 560 WQ I wonder how she and Mo get along that would be the real interesting thing, huh? They don't get along

[01:27:07.020 --> 01:27:15.840]
No, another reason to like Phyllis. I'm starting to like that Phyllis a lot now. Oh aiki breaking heart by BilliRays Cyrus. Absolutely correct

[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:16.560]
Warren and Voka

[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:23.620]
And it says and then QM sports intensive mode all our we don't play this that much anymore because it's kind of embarrassing but

[01:27:24.100 --> 01:27:24.500]
Yeah

[01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:39.020]
Excellent job. We're not gonna put that on there, but we will put aiki breaking heart by that obnoxious Phyllis race Cyrus dude

[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.920]
In fact, let's just put almost any country in western song on her, you know sure

[01:27:44.580 --> 01:27:49.480]
12 minutes past noon at 560 WQ I'm the beast is looking for a date and the beast is looking to get the

[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:54.360]
Slim not necessarily in that order. What's the thing you ought to get slim first before it looks for a date?

[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.760]
I think that might be too late

[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.600]
Right, he'll be able to do well. He's still alive. He will get slim in the box

[01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:04.840]
Anyway, the beast is losing weight the smart way on balance for life

[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:10.160]
There's no cooking no shopping no cleaning no worries no counting calories no counting carbs no figuring anything out

[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:13.800]
No trying to figure that it's a very complicated zone diet, which it is very complex

[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.760]
But guess what they do all the figuring out for you all you have to do is fill out your little menu every week

[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:24.420]
They have two choices for each meal every day that you run a program might say each meal you get five meals a day

[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:30.000]
Three gourmet meals two delicious snacks. They're all in your little black sack and they deliver it right to wherever you want your house

[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.620]
Your work wherever you're gonna be by six o'clock every morning and in your sack is all the food you need for the whole day

[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:36.260]
We're not talking about teeny little

[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:41.780]
Perky type portions. We're talking about plenty of good food to keep you satisfied all through the day delicious fresh goodies

[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:46.800]
All kinds of omelets and crepes and chicken dishes and beef and fish and all kinds of seafood

[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:47.860]
It is the leash

[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:54.220]
So eating three to five meals a day is what they all recommend to keep your glycemic levels constant to keep that weight pouring off

[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:56.080]
And this is the way to do it balance for life

[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:01.040]
So if you want to lose that weight and look a lot better get some decent looking clothes on and be a lot healthier as well

[01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:03.360]
