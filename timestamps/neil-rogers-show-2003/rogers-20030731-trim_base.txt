[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.500]
oh we got some bad news to get started I don't want to start on a sour note because we got

[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.720]
so many good things going on including the half a million people there last night let me say it

[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.500]
again would stock like would stock run by the Swiss what a good headline I love that I mean it's

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.720]
an old line it's just it's just like that line about if you woke up with Vaseline on your

[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.200]
uh quiz I mean on your ass or anywhere in your case it was both oh no seriously he had Vaseline

[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:47.600]
on his uh back on his face now maybe you're a contortionist maybe in a moment of incoherence maybe

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.260]
you able to like do a Ron Jeremy and oh and love you your double joint it they flipped him over

[00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.260]
the crowd turned him over yeah for round two I heard he was a real head turner at the party

[00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.040]
is what I heard something about him I mean a picture I think the picture of the ash in the face

[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.680]
pails into what significance about the guy who's about to open his fly who's standing on it's

[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.520]
his way from Carlos's push that's the one that leads to that father that might bother you just a

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.660]
little bit okay wow it felt like barbecue sauce running down his chin at any rate well did we

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.960]
have a phenomenal response yesterday on that uh not on the pole the pole sucked of course because

[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.840]
it's sort of just pulled but on the website because everybody want to see those pictures from

[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.440]
Pearl's birthday bash and especially they want to see beater boy are taking a little ass in the face

[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.360]
there was well what else do you call it I mean that was almost for excuse me taking a big ass in

[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.220]
the face man and the best part of his before the show he admitted this morning he had he liked it he

[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.460]
enjoyed it he was a little bit in coherent but just just has enough memory to remember he enjoyed it a

[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:54.500]
lot bad news record producer Sam Phillips dead at 80 oh that's bad news no Sam Phillips yeah we

[00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.740]

a long time look how long he held on man just refuse to go so some records found her

[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.720]
Sam Phillips who decided that have been unknown Elvis Presley deserved a recording contract when

[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:16.820]
he heard him sing songs for his mother has died he was 80 see now 80 views sounds like well that's

[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:24.240]
pretty old but to me it's like oh that's not so old tomorrow yeah when I first heard him Elvis the

[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.580]
essence of what I heard his voice was such that I knew there might be a number of areas we could

[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.820]
go into Phillips once that just like they got it was in the pictures with Beena Boy there are a

[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:36.560]
number of areas he was planning to go into you're never going to live that down now that that's

[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:41.300]
that's the legacy that will last you a lifetime oh and and believe me on this show will make

[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:48.760]

climbing health for a year the older Phillips founded some records in 1952 have launched the

[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.960]
career of Elvis that a young senior moved from Tuple and Mississippi in the summer of 53

[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.840]

[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.720]
welcome as face man

[00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.260]
let's see I got to do that Hillary perg. Today we got to give the results from your poll we have a

[00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.480]
George bashing pole today and George said to me before the show why you're bashing me the

[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.860]
nest it's just gonna help why why is that uh because I uh ripped that pole building show you

[00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:09.060]
did the day before you did I made mention of it what was that I said that they're getting to be like

[00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:12.640]
giveaway shows you just hear the same thing every time we do a pole building show no but that was

[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:16.820]
a good pole about the rock with the wall but they got they never understand the question so they

[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.880]
just call up with names they just throw names out and it uh gets old I didn't think your

[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.540]
I thought was pretty damn good listen most of those people don't have anything to say but I guess

[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.520]
you haven't figured that out yet I figured it out so you give them their moment in the line right

[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.640]
like that and they just the blurt out a name or a word or a phrase or like uh something you know

[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.400]
like a crack I know an answer to a question meanwhile I'll tell you who I really enjoyed uh who I

[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:45.560]
like a lot of Sam Roberts hope you don't know from Sam Roberts it's a Canadian group no not just a

[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.660]
guy it's a group they have worth a concert and I'll tell you who was um right now I don't want

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.900]
to sound negative because there was nothing negative about it was just great and even though the

[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.600]
stones look like they're about 95 but uh guess who which is certainly one of my top favorite three or

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.380]
four groups of all time I there isn't a bigger guess who fan in the world I don't think at a

[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.560]
bigger burden coming spain did I always say that he may have had the greatest voice of anybody in

[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:14.300]
the world you said that and I won't argue many times uh in that's in past 10 now they they did do

[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.520]
taking care of business which of course wasn't their song in the first place but they did

[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.240]
and of course the crowd went nuts when they did that they did a really rousing version of that but when

[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:27.340]
they were doing their own songs it was so obvious to me that Burton coming just uh he ain't got a name

[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:32.460]
where he's lost that voice that fantastic uh that thing and when they sang no time he was like

[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:39.180]
squealing you know what I mean yeah that's sad no time I mean it was I don't know it's just uh I not

[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:44.440]
I mean nothing is perfect and it was phenomenal and sensational and this city is a magnificent it's

[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:52.580]
but like I said he used to be great of course he's only about what 90 right okay we'll get to

[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.080]
the results of your really embarrassing pull and by the way that's one of the oldest lives in

[00:09:56.080 --> 00:10:00.000]
history I don't want me to be like George was that creative about that if you woke up after

[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.500]
party with Vaseline on your ass would you tell him that's older than the thusel in fact I think

[00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:10.340]
the thusel was probably the first one to work up with Vaseline he mentioned it on his ass he mentioned

[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.540]
the whole that was but I just saw the pool I thought here we go again with that anal business again if

[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.100]
it's not eating ass it's Vaseline and he has and of course uh well this one tied into current events

[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.900]
when that guy was opening up his fly there and at one picture I you know I conjured up all sorts

[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:28.380]
of things after you heard about the report on Venus welcome 12 minutes after 10 at 560 W Kermey

[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.040]

do understand that this is another way the qm continues shooting itself in a foot every time we

[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.680]
build up this momentum i mean for real is so hot he's like you can't even touch him you know even if

[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:07.540]
you wanted to which i don't but he's he's hotter in a firecracker right now we got those marlin

[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:12.880]
game i'll guarantee you that the 37,000 people are last night 20,000 were there for uh don trail and

[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.040]
the other 17 were there because of all the hype that uh for else been given you believe that

[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:21.540]
yeah sure just pretend you believe it unless seriously he's gonna have like double digits in

[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.660]
the next trend and then of course then then it's really gonna become glaring you know because

[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:31.180]
that last the book which thank god for us by the way but that book uh there was in a way

[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.660]
reflection of him because he had been on long enough right but when we get to July trend out do we

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:42.100]
have any idea when it is August what uh yes exactly yeah end of August and then you're gonna see

the morning goes shooting up and the somebody's not and we can't get the hour by hour during the trend

[00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.500]
so somebody of course for three months will have the opportunity to say ah we're really making

[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.720]
a comeback and uh what we're doing it yeah the same guy that said ratings don't count but then one

[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:59.100]
whole summer book comes out we get the hour by hour and you see that all of the all of the forward

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.960]
motion is gonna be eight to 10 a.m. and that six to eight is gonna be continuing to be just

[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.760]
deadly then then we'll separate the real broadcaster from the wannabe's okay from the

[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:57.920]
boring one cure for insomnia one hard aspect that was my vote I voted hard aspect just

[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:03.580]
in just relevant that's true accurate pot head one closet queen one and juvenile one we're

[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:07.500]
just getting a few a little taste so far let's see juvenile and mature that's redundant

[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.400]
but look at he's okay five and entertaining two say the reason I took the poll really is because

[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:19.160]
the poll we took last week about who's the weakest link now Mo one hands down I mean no content

[00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:24.340]
absolutely but of the other personalities on the station you came in a very solid second

[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.120]
not close to mo but heads and shoulders above everybody else and so I'm really curious what it is

[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.020]
that the at least people have against you and of course it's a summertime now so it's basically

[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:38.240]
your ballgame right there's a hardcore group like 20% of the audience just hates me yeah hates

[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.060]
anybody that fills in for you no no no no no no I don't lay it on my fat old shoulders what does

[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:48.280]
that have to do with me nothing they just hate me and that's based on you know well I was trying

[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.060]
and done trying to with these efforts to to yank it out find out why now that we ever get an

[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:59.460]
answer our is the are we streaming it or not we didn't get an answer well how's that possible

[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.160]
I don't know I mean how's it possible that some people would be hearing it on the internet and

[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:09.840]
some people would not either it's one of those either uh or no say a thing in the bank you

[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.840]
might say that's what seems to be going on half I mean people are calling some can some can hear

[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.420]
it some can it's all messed up well I'll be goddamn here's a call from Miami hello

[00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:31.550]
that tree in entry he's got to this man is so incompetent anyway let me just ask you this since

[00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:35.510]
we're talking about stuff that i'm going to be nervous getting done best of since tomorrow's

[00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:41.850]
august uh numero uno best in the old cd 2002 to 2003 the ones got me farting in most face

[00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:47.550]
absolutely none is gonna grave should be on hands uh next week no no that's not what i'm asking

[00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.750]
and also i need to get an update on that because i had such a quivering call from moth vividly

[00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:59.670]
what a what a pussy man about the mohawai david of keychains right there will be a slight delay

[00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:05.070]
involved in changing that how long is that gonna take not more than an additional week uh

[00:37:06.510 --> 00:37:11.810]
geez you know moth you this you make my you make my kishkeys just tremble you make my you twist my

[00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:17.370]
kishkeys oh yeah everybody in that building is so afraid of their own god damn shadow it's pathetic

[00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:23.550]
it's tragic well we don't we don't have to ask anybody's permission that that that's material

[00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:27.630]
that we play on a show that's why i tried to tell him i i didn't raise this thing about it but

[00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:31.150]
to think that we're going to have to delay a week when we got this important fundraiser but the

[00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:36.610]
bit is well chabel and rate me yes i want to be with that he said that didn't he obviously you

[00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:39.670]
didn't create that that wasn't one of those phone they're like you put together trying to make

[00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:43.970]
him look like a jackass i beg your pardon i did not slice or dice that well chabel and rate me yes

[00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:48.330]
i want to be deal with that but oh well we got to remake the keychains because wow that they

[00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.170]
better be put them open and the reason we got to do it is because moth is afraid that it's going

[00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.390]
to come down on his ass that's the reason we got to do it and he's probably sitting there like

[00:37:55.950 --> 00:38:01.950]
you know puking his guts at me you know at the radio too bad there comes a time when you have to

[00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:07.810]
butcher up a little bit okay we can't be like when you say somebody we want you to be outrageous

[00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:12.610]
and not a little bit outrageous we're not like a teeny tiny bit either you just go full steam you know

[00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:16.910]
i'm saying full steam ahead no no no get a lot of trying to sell the wounds of some miserable

[00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:22.190]
nasty rotten disgusting filthy smelly old man with a dead musk red on his head and a big fat

[00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.930]
colostomy back everything we do we got to worry about all we got to walk on eggshells because it

[00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:31.850]
might get more upset absolutely we don't want to get him upset no more because then he might

[00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.170]
extort another two three years on his contract he made me working abilities about a hundred

[00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:41.230]
so anyway what's the answer to my question tomorrow are we going to have that stuff up there

[00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:49.510]
where they can start ordering no we're not no let me let me see if i understand this again

[00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.910]
i have the question was since tomorrow's obvious the first which is what we've been valley

[00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:58.710]
hoon is the starting date for our fundraiser campaign for abandon pet rescue which i love so much

[00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:07.070]
and you tell me the answer is no no no no unacceptable and what's the what's the reason for the

[00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:14.930]
answer being no i don't know what do you mean by that well let's have a meeting about it who's

[00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:19.550]

four thousand eighty seven before we get the ball going here he's slower than freaking molasses man

[00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:34.550]
let's blame it on Eric this has been you notice being a boy this is Georgia's new technique this

[00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:39.710]
is the new tactic every time something screws up every time there's a blame and it's done no no yeah i

[00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:43.970]
agree with him on this one well that's here was giving you the opportunity to slice Eric too i didn't

[00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:48.370]
want to start like i was doing it we don't want to be piling on just like those two other guys who

[00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:52.650]
are like you can't see them in that photo of uh beat a boy passed out on the ship but they're

also two other guys who are like start on zip their flies speaking of piling on yeah that's

[00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.930]

in the story that i i hadn't heard anything about this story because i was uh we see yesterday

[00:56:23.490 --> 00:56:27.530]
here i hate to break the news to you but all those coverage that's all they ever was talking about

[00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:32.750]
was did him uh stone thing last year visit there was a whole lot of media at the event including

[00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:36.630]
local national and international and they're saying and they're still ducked up up up up because it

[00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:41.870]
was a great event but the story about the hoax in the case of long missing indiana girl in the uh

[00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:47.730]
yeah oh how embarrassing and then of course CNN gets in with which stands for certainly not news

[00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:52.250]
you people at CNN they they try to save their ass here last night they actually sent somebody here

[00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:56.110]
which we appreciate that everybody in Toronto the fact they give us worldwide coverage on what a

[00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:59.790]
great event it was and how well it was staged and how wonderful the city is and so on but this

[00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.150]
on the heels they even admitted that since they were at the forefront of hyping all of that

[00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:09.230]
SARS-CRAP including a lot of cases were supposedly it was exported which we know was not

[00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:13.650]
remember those bogus cases in Texas every time somebody sneezed in Texas oh they got SARS

[00:57:13.650 --> 00:57:18.770]
they were at their airport in Toronto for 10 minutes crack you know and so they try to redeem

[00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.450]
themselves but to make a long story sure i didn't see this story about this hoax which will get

[00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:30.590]
into and you'll explain it because you're bringing here's for a lottery oh four lottery

[00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:11.290]
uncle George is on because I really like to see I'm not tuning in anymore to this guy he's a

[00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:16.270]
great guy but he's trying to run a show with no subject and he just can't do it he's much better

[00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:21.810]
when he finally has a subject so people can call him for something well what do you mean by that

[00:58:21.810 --> 00:58:25.750]
can I run a poll I don't understand what that means he likes the poll building shows is what he's

[00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:32.550]
trying to say yeah no no what I'm trying to say see that was a shot at me it's much more

[00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:37.710]
entertaining you know well let me let me ask you this what's the subject today here what's our

[00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:42.350]
subject no you can run it without because you have that talent because I'm entertaining which he

[00:58:42.350 --> 00:58:47.030]
is not right I'm here there's only my point and then he's a great guy but I mean just I said

[00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:51.010]
I always I always a great guy see you're doing like a disclaimer there to try to like stop in the

not great but he's okay he's a good sidekick how about that no that's okay take it easy

[00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:17.250]
talk about what are you talking about Bernie 56705 60 pound 560 on a AT&T I tell you

[00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:22.030]
that they were going to humongous response just like I predicted never any shortage of votes when

[00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:28.250]
you bring up George 285 votes and how many I'm curious about the brilliant nine still stuck on nine

[00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:31.370]
but that's guaranteed you never thought you get nine you said I'm not going to get you for that

[00:59:31.370 --> 00:59:36.730]
you know all defensive all like that's another thing that they don't like don't be defensive be

[00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:44.110]
more offensive although nothing probably are don't like a wimp out like that little weasel sitting

[00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:50.250]
across from there in the chair the weasel oh he is he's a weasel he spends half this time on

most head the other time passed out on a couch waiting for the lineup you know oh that keep in mind

[00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.310]
that was a still picture that was only like part of a long line that was like a conga line

it's just a moment in time yeah and if there's anything we love on this show it's a conga line

[01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:18.950]

offered him 85 cents per record in royalties

[01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:30.090]

wqa m here's a fact from a for health band across brings it says

[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:46.930]
I had a revelation last week regarding the freak that works the reception desk of the studio

[01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:53.290]
now this obviously is one of our listeners who picked up some free stuff tickets right based on the

[01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:57.650]
rest of the facts that says he should be worshipping for well and craving his package and bending

over backward lick his ass why because with all the free tickets for else giving out Rapunzel

[01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:07.550]
chin has had a steady stream of guys to check out when they go get their tickets like this for

[01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:12.090]
our fan and cruel springs so next time you see him wearing his office blood shirt I bet there's a

[01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:16.510]
freebie giveaway and that's his bait to tool for something to hit on and I hope that this

[01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:21.250]
fact's her and Rapunzel chin had a good time when you think he'd think they've been beatable

[01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:26.150]
to go out there in like referee kind of hop in don't know what you're talking about this she ate

[01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:30.710]
hoax discovered in case of long machine in Indiana girl what at first seemed to be an achingly

[01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:35.250]
beautiful story of a missing Indiana girl who found her way back home 17 years after she vanished

[01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:41.230]
turned out yesterday to be nothing more than a cruel hoax Indiana state police officials had a

[01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.730]
woman calling family members of Shannon Sherrill and falsely claiming to be Shannon who was

[01:05:45.730 --> 01:05:50.750]
assistant she disappeared 1986 a warrant was issued for the arrest of Donna Walker 35 up to

[01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:56.010]
Pika Walker is whereabouts were unknown as of this morning did they see any update on the story not

[01:05:57.230 --> 01:06:01.690]
state police for a sergeant Dave Burston said investigators have found no clear indication of a motive

[01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:07.330]
but he said police believed the Walker contacted the news media herself to gin up interest in the case

[01:06:08.050 --> 01:06:12.210]
we live in the nades today where people like to receive attention he said the drama began over

[01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:18.670]
the weekend when Dorothy Sherrill picked up the phone at her home in Thorntown Indiana a woman police

[01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:23.090]
officer believe no I says this is tried again a woman police believe was Walker told Sherrill she

[01:06:23.090 --> 01:06:27.850]
was her missing daughter the woman also spoke with Shannon's father Mike Sherrill who was divorced

[01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:31.810]
from Dorothy before Shannon disappeared she even agreed to meet him in person Mike Sherrill said

[01:06:31.810 --> 01:06:37.370]
they extinct emails and digital pictures the phone calls launched the family into a joyful frenzy

[01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:42.570]
mystic static over the whole thing Mike Sherrill told Walker reporters it's okay like George it's okay

[01:06:42.570 --> 01:06:48.610]
okay very very to be excited but state police investigators who have kept the case open since Shannon

[01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:53.690]
disappeared were wary the woman became skittish as soon as police tried to arrange for DNA testing

[01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:57.690]
confirmed her identity she would call police but refused to provide a phone number or she could be

[01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:02.430]
reached when pieces of the puzzle didn't fit accurately together as when we started looking

[01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:07.030]
harder Burston said during the investigation Burston said police believed that the woman called them

[01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:12.550]
three times posing as other people once as a man and tried to disguise her voice they believe she

[01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:17.470]
obtained information about the case on the internet investigators did make their doubts public

[01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:21.170]
order they share them with the Sherrill's fearing that the woman might never be identified and charged

[01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:25.950]
the Sherrill family was unaware of the hoax until minutes before was announced yesterday at

[01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:33.550]
a police news conference which was broadcast live by CNN this is real hard I wasn't expecting this

[01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.970]
at all when they called me with the information for a news conference I thought for sure they're

[01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.610]
going to bring Shannon in here I thought this was going to be something Mike Sherrill said before

[01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:46.230]
melting into sobs and bearing his face in his hands Dorothy Sherrill sent by wordlessly dabbing

[01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:53.070]
it arrives with a tissue you ready for that right and like it goes on to say the hoax part of it is

[01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:59.370]
not so uncommon as we wish they were but what's aberrant about this is that the police and CNN and

[01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:03.750]
everyone knew except this family that this press conference was going to be all about nothing they

[01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:07.270]
how could they how could they do that they how could the police do that how could they see an

[01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:12.450]
end to that if they knew oh we know they knew yeah we know CNN and all the media people are heartless

[01:08:12.450 --> 01:08:18.170]
bastards but what about that that sounds like a tremendous lawsuit to make her because he's

[01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:23.050]
never got a good satisfaction with luck is like he said before the show this morning I mean this

[01:08:23.050 --> 01:08:28.650]
is like a misdemeanor what you write we're like a prank call as well she did exactly but the fact

[01:08:28.650 --> 01:08:34.130]
that see it and put this guy on there for a press conference and then he finds out when they

[01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:37.870]
announced that this was a hoax on the year so they get it see that's what they love that's what

[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:41.910]
the news media wants that's what you grave robbers want is to put people on the air crying and

[01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:48.270]
sobbing and catch them in their weakest most emotional personal private moments so I'm saying I'm

[01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:53.090]
saying that when we catch what's your name what is your name again this broad dollar walker Donna Walker

[01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:58.350]
that we line her up and we let everybody have one shot with a baseball bat that sounds good all right

[01:08:58.350 --> 01:09:04.810]
and CNN we just don't ever watch it again plus something like that I see people at CNN make me

[01:09:04.810 --> 01:09:09.010]
sick for ice that a man you're a joke you're you're a farce you're a hoax and that thing of show

[01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:14.450]
I said the guy up here last night you talk about trying to cover your ass they made a big deal about

[01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:18.690]
that bogus story in Texas a couple weeks ago after we finally got over the second star at SARS-Wave

[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:24.490]
here and finally starting to make a comeback oh in Texas there's these military that was at the

[01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:29.310]
airport in Toronto for 45 minutes and by the by they got a cold and they got a bleeding oozing

[01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:34.610]
hemorrhoid now when they finally did the retraction the next day it wasn't the lead story it was

[01:09:34.610 --> 01:09:39.370]
like it's like when they do a correction in the newspaper right like like if the hero tomorrow

[01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:46.570]
puts on the front page George Rodriguez accused of raping 15 women and then you know

[01:09:46.570 --> 01:09:50.770]
or WQM's George and then if they put on this page two you know where they have like the um

[01:09:51.570 --> 01:09:55.930]
the subscription information and the thing that nobody reads tiny little micro type tiny

[01:09:55.930 --> 01:10:00.350]
correction it was not it was George Rodriguez from uh sweet water it was not George Rodriguez from

[01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:05.250]
huh because it's five million George Rodriguez in South Florida they hurled the regrets sincerely

[01:10:05.250 --> 01:10:11.010]
out of the audience in other words don't sue our ass once you're crap people at CNN you should only

[01:10:11.010 --> 01:10:17.010]
croak okay and MSNBC only nobody watches them what a sad excuse for freaking news

[01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:25.250]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's plantation hello

[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:32.490]
gone oh yes sir hey what is your order what happened to plantation okay it's key

[01:10:32.490 --> 01:10:38.170]
cargo yes it is mr. Rogers pleasure to speak to you again yes it is you please

[01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:45.930]
afford me 15 seconds to make my point what what is that me I am a listener since 1987 okay data

[01:10:45.930 --> 01:10:56.010]
i.o.d. q.a.m. alright yes my point what is it i slash we tune in to five sixty a.m. from 10 to

[01:10:56.010 --> 01:11:02.790]
two thank God for 10 to hear by the way yes thank God for 10 to two I know absolutely nine to one is

[01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:10.150]
like you know blows but was it clear we want to listen to and hear the voice of new Rogers

[01:11:10.150 --> 01:11:18.390]
yes just respect to George yes because he is a great guy when I and we want to hear your voice

[01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:27.630]
yes why not the tapes no Henry has no substitute when he's on vacation or whatever they played tapes

[01:11:27.630 --> 01:11:34.470]
fill in or when he's not there why doesn't he sure yeah because we act as I don't want to do it I

[01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:38.770]
don't want I don't want to rehearse they take listen to me you are the best that's what we want to

[01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:43.010]
sir let me say something to you I don't care but would you take them yes sir sir we're just

[01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:51.350]
okay hold the sucking for just one second are me I say give me one second yes the fact of the

[01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:55.730]
matter is this that I don't believe in tapes because everything we talk about it is just like

[01:11:55.730 --> 01:12:00.090]
the story we just had on now about the the the the hoax on the fight in that girl Indiana that's

[01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:05.290]
but we talk about whatever is going on now in town in the world I'm talking about the big concert

[01:12:05.290 --> 01:12:10.210]
here last night in Toronto six months from now a year from now any of the things that I'm talking

[01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:15.010]
about today would be meaningless it's like talking about alien and the Pope visiting Miami all

[01:12:15.010 --> 01:12:19.630]
these things and when he used to play the tapes it's a bunch of outdated crap nobody wants to hear

[01:12:19.630 --> 01:12:25.850]
my response to that is you're absolutely 100% right right that's the fact that we love hearing

[01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:32.830]
the voice and the Rogers yesterday's tape two days from now we still want to hear your voice

[01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:38.570]
well how about how about if I just yeah well how about if I just did like a generic tape where I

[01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:45.990]
read like the Toronto telephone directory it would not be outdated until I come up with a new

[01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:49.190]
full book next year which gives me a one year and at least you'd hear the sound of my voice

[01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:55.710]
okay okay the survey says cleaning out right do you understand my point that we love to hear

[01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:59.570]
your voice thanks you're obsessed with my voice and you probably do the soleitist things while

[01:12:59.570 --> 01:13:04.030]
I'm on here yes we're addicted to your voice yes see there's the dick part okay okay this is the

[01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:10.710]
donut guy remember yeah the donut guy yes I do okay listen also listen to me and I'm glad you

[01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:16.390]
cleaned up your act by the way James Barbie I said I'm glad you cleaned up your act I have I have

[01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:22.830]
the James W.H. and Jeff B. I want to say I love both of them and I have the listen to you since 1987

[01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:28.150]
we need tapes on those days not to disrespect George George as a great guy say goodbye

[01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.810]
say goodbye I'll see it winchels

[01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:43.730]
it was a great call the you know the the middle of the stand before they just want to hear

[01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:47.710]
the sound of my voice they're obsessed with the sound of my voice they feel like they're okay

[01:13:47.710 --> 01:13:52.290]
like life is okay and if they can get up for another day as long as I'm on the year I show up

[01:13:52.290 --> 01:13:55.530]
and now what are these people going to do when I return in about five minutes I mean in about

[01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:59.910]
the three and a half years how come it keeps it continues being three and a half years it seems

[01:13:59.910 --> 01:14:03.950]
like I've been saying that for a long time for a lot of years about third man being a half years

[01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:08.290]
sounds like a lifetime away to me especially another my daughtering old fool how how am I going to

[01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:12.270]
do this in three and a half years I was saying to somebody yesterday I'm thinking very strongly

[01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:16.370]
that this Tuesday and Thursday thing I could get used to this in a heartbeat of course there

[01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:21.070]
have to be a lot of vacations like the ones that are now huh no and I think being a boy is very

[01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:24.450]
important for you and it's good that you got the summer schedule on there but now that I'm going

[01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:28.790]
on vacation today and we'll be back until Tuesday August 12th you probably want to put that on

[01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:32.510]
there for people like him who desperately need it's not a shot at George it's just that George

[01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:37.830]
is not taken right not George is not mean he's not those awful awful tapes I mean it happened to

[01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:43.730]
other really good people back at IOD remember when they tried to who was that a DFO Randy Rick and

[01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:50.330]
SUDs no I thought you said it happened to good people I'm sorry I was SUDs yeah yeah and they were

[01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:55.970]
just shredded by the audience they will accept when did Randy fill on my show today's it was

[01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:01.190]
supposed to be a week and it only lasted a week why is that outpouring according to Gary was

[01:15:01.190 --> 01:15:05.030]
just way too negative and they replaced her with tapes because they couldn't stay they were

[01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:08.950]
ringing the phone off the hook you mean okay when they tried her any afternoon and they put

[01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:14.550]
on because they came to this I mean I'm not not going Randy there am I yeah but they had her

[01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:18.190]
filling in for you for a couple days it was I still have great respect for her gigantic pair though

[01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:22.990]
I really do show enough she has big balls yes she does see one of the few people all years I work

[01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:27.350]
in this business who had the balls to tell management to go stick it right up their ass and I that

[01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:33.190]
that wins a lot of points with me because most people in this business are a bunch of wimpy nervous

[01:15:33.190 --> 01:15:36.770]
little nellies I don't want to mention duck because he's already got problems they want to keychain

[01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:42.490]
thing nervous little wimpy people who like kind of coward in the corner oh it's a fight Greg it's a

[01:15:42.490 --> 01:15:47.590]
fight you know that crab very sad duck is basically underneath that exterior he's really pretty good

[01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:56.130]
guy but the the posture that he brings to the table you follow what I'm saying is so wimpy and so

[01:15:56.130 --> 01:16:07.910]
ineffectual and so lame and so weak and so useless and so swishy 1156 at 560 wq I mean a hurricane

in fact he made me start to wear one of those outfits like the pope wears and one of them

[01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:20.250]
beanie's pretty soon the pope who condemned the war and who said that anyone who engages in this

[01:21:20.250 --> 01:21:23.670]
kind of activity will have to answer to god that yeah but now the pope is on the right side of

[01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:29.790]
straightness and the heterosexuality and god etc right side because far be it from w to start

[01:24:03.650 --> 01:24:07.050]
trips i've made there been extremely disappointing and there weren't a lot of tourists and it was

[01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:11.650]
like uh another bunch of Dutch people which most of us don't want to be around and that's kind of

[01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:17.450]
like that but in august now see in southern europe like in italy and in um

[01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:23.330]
Greece and a lot of the country spain parts of France that's uh august is the month everybody

[01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:29.350]
goes on vacation not so much in northern europe in fact a lot of those people from southern europe

[01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:35.030]
may wind up in amstadam you know people are like taking a vacation time looking for a heathenistic

[01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:39.090]
place where they can go and screw around have a good time it's going to be really interesting what's

[01:24:39.170 --> 01:24:42.310]
going on in those coffee shops because i don't know do you remember that start we head out there

[01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:46.330]
yeah what's up in a band the weed and hash and the any well because of the anti-smoking

[01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.630]
fanatics not because of the drug element uh going to be everything to see if they're still

[01:24:49.630 --> 01:24:54.830]
smoking the uh uh wicked rope we'll be eagerly awaiting your report not that you normally go

[01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:57.950]
into one of those places but you might want to just uh stick your head in there and see what's

[01:24:57.950 --> 01:25:03.570]
going on i have never been in a coffee shop in amstadam in my life well do us a favor will you

[01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:10.130]
i'll stand outside and i'll sit in there in fact there are a lot of places in amstadam you go outside

[01:25:10.130 --> 01:25:13.430]
but you don't want to sniff too hard because there's so much dog crap on the street that if his

[01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:18.930]
sniff too hard to like you just destroy your nasal passages it's bad for you so i forget i'll

[01:25:18.930 --> 01:25:23.310]
give you one more chance and the great thing about europe unlike the us which is so damn big you know

[01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:29.790]
and candidate to candidate jaggeda jie gravity europe is tiny it's small and amstadam's a good

[01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:34.790]
and easy place to fly directly to from here or from my amy and as a result of that if you like

[01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:39.310]
get there and it turns out there's nothing but scumbags and a bunch of nasty clone leather queens

[01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:43.590]
and stuff like that uh then you get on a plane or you get on a train you go someplace else

[01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:49.990]
it's my drift i can't i caught it there you go so that's why i'm going back but not that i need

[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:53.270]
to explain to anybody but probably there are some scratching their heads wondering g we're just

I'm a fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking

[01:32:11.950 --> 01:32:34.450]
fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking... fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking god fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking... fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking fucking

[01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:45.850]
Wow, that is number one with four bullets.

[01:32:47.290 --> 01:32:48.610]
He asked me, I love that.

[01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:49.110]
I like it.

[01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:49.810]
Why not?

[01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:52.370]
I don't know, it's just one of those things.

[01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:55.930]
Because it's filthy and disgusting and espaniol like a...

[01:32:55.930 --> 01:32:57.570]
Is that 80s, I can recommend number one.

[01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:58.350]
I mean, I like that.

[01:32:58.630 --> 01:32:59.550]
So I thought you would like it.

[01:32:59.750 --> 01:33:00.370]
It's a little rough.

[01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:02.690]
Well, I want to...

[01:33:02.690 --> 01:33:04.650]
So what are you trying to say that we probably shouldn't be playing it?

[01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:05.550]
Is that what you're now saying?

[01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:06.710]
No, no, not rough in that way.

[01:33:06.910 --> 01:33:11.710]
It's rough around the edges as in Bokobrion's son still has some production issues to hash out.

[01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:13.470]
I own things that I think is magnificent.

[01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:14.550]
I thought so too.

[01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:15.770]
That's why I think it's sensational.

[01:33:16.070 --> 01:33:18.570]
It sure beats any of the bits of playing on the other shows on our station,

[01:33:18.570 --> 01:33:22.410]
of course they're not playing any, but he just threw it in like on a separate disc as an afterthought.

[01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:23.950]
I think it's great.

[01:33:24.230 --> 01:33:26.410]
And it's the issue which, of course, I got his a new disc here right now.

[01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:27.270]
Thanks, Bokar, I love you.

[01:33:28.190 --> 01:33:31.990]
Even though, you know, let's see, 389 votes.

[01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:34.070]
I want to like, Antisemitic's got one now.

[01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:34.770]
I just went on there.

[01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.830]
That guy that just called.

[01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.750]
What?

[01:33:38.270 --> 01:33:38.850]
That's his vote.

[01:33:39.290 --> 01:33:40.790]
But he's not the one who said that.

[01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.930]
That was another caller before in the previous hour.

[01:33:43.710 --> 01:33:44.130]
No, I don't know.

[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:45.290]
Mr. Perinoia.

[01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:46.510]
Well, you...

[01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:47.930]
You and him, the two of you.

[01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.470]
Yeah.

[01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:50.610]
I think we ought to have a duel like at the P.P. Park,

[01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:52.090]
as soon as baseball season ends.

[01:33:52.210 --> 01:33:52.330]
Sure.

[01:33:54.110 --> 01:33:54.670]
Antisemitic one.

[01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:55.630]
We're asking about the...

[01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:56.330]
What's your take on?

[01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:58.390]
Which of these phrases describes George the best?

[01:33:58.730 --> 01:33:59.550]
immature three.

[01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:00.390]
That's not bad.

[01:34:00.810 --> 01:34:01.770]
Sooner or later, four.

[01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:05.490]
Subhating, spick, and pervert, and sexually frustrated,

[01:34:05.790 --> 01:34:06.890]
and the anal all each have ten.

[01:34:07.950 --> 01:34:09.350]
I thought anal would do better than that.

[01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.950]
Didn't you, Bonehead?

[01:34:13.210 --> 01:34:13.610]
Yeah.

[01:34:15.390 --> 01:34:16.350]
Well, that's right, I forgot.

[01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:17.710]
You can't be talking about analesis.

[01:34:17.770 --> 01:34:17.910]
Correct.

[01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:18.310]
Sorry.

[01:34:19.290 --> 01:34:21.050]
I don't want to have anything to do with that.

[01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:24.330]
It's a little late now, ain't it?

[01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:27.450]
Probably should have put a sign on it before you passed out.

[01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:30.010]
Mediocre eleven, juvenile eleven.

[01:34:30.210 --> 01:34:31.970]
Hard, hard, aspic twelve.

[01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:34.270]
I think that's such a great, hard aspic.

[01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:35.470]
That's you, man.

[01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:36.670]
It's pretty soft, actually.

[01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:38.030]
Bringen fifteen.

[01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:40.410]
Kurefferen, son of a sixteen.

[01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:42.890]
Know what all seventeen.

[01:34:43.210 --> 01:34:44.550]
Closet queen and pothead.

[01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:47.430]
Those two seem to be like, uh, side by each.

[01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:49.430]
They're like, uh, married to each other.

[01:34:50.730 --> 01:34:52.590]
So maybe George is married to a pothead

[01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:54.310]
or another closet queen, each have twenty.

[01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:55.910]
Entertaining thirty seven.

[01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:56.530]
That's very good.

[01:34:57.250 --> 01:35:00.950]
Want to be forty three, boring forty nine, nine, nine.

[01:35:01.210 --> 01:35:02.330]
And he's okay, ninety three.

[01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:05.090]
Hands down, twenty three point six percent.

[01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.630]
He's okay.

[01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:06.490]
He's okay.

[01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:07.690]
That says it all.

[01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:11.650]
In spite of this recent torrent we've had of hatred and psychosis

[01:35:11.650 --> 01:35:13.430]
in the last few minutes, they just, you know,

[01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:14.710]
how they've ratcheted it up.

[01:35:15.050 --> 01:35:16.370]
Miss ratchet may be calling next.

[01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:20.710]
They've ratcheted up the level and degree of just anemosity and hate

[01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:21.990]
to poor little George.

[01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:24.450]
And of course in his case he takes it personal.

[01:35:24.630 --> 01:35:25.430]
That's a sad part.

[01:35:25.890 --> 01:35:26.250]
Yeah.

[01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:28.670]
For years I've been trying to wean you off of that crap

[01:35:28.670 --> 01:35:29.530]
by taking it personal.

[01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:31.850]
I insist he just, you know, whatever you say.

[01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:33.290]
You do.

[01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:33.910]
Okay.

[01:35:34.410 --> 01:35:35.070]
Here's Miami.

[01:35:35.130 --> 01:35:35.390]
Hello.

[01:35:37.150 --> 01:35:37.550]
Miami.

[01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:39.210]
When is this?

[01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:40.150]
Yes, it sounds like you.

[01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:40.650]
Okay.

[01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:42.310]
I just want to hear this call.

[01:35:42.530 --> 01:35:42.970]
Oh, bonehead.

[01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:44.010]
That's his phone.

[01:35:44.290 --> 01:35:44.630]
Go ahead.

[01:35:44.910 --> 01:35:45.070]
Huh?

[01:35:45.670 --> 01:35:46.730]
He's sound like you're in a barrel.

[01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:47.390]
Hold on.

[01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:48.270]
Let me get off speaker phone.

[01:35:48.310 --> 01:35:48.890]
Oh, please.

[01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:50.310]
Don't ever call me in a speaker phone.

[01:35:53.290 --> 01:35:53.690]
Okay.

[01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:55.630]
Good job.

[01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:56.410]
Good job.

[01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:57.710]
You got off the speaker phone.

[01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:58.450]
You got off the phone.

[01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:59.210]
Maybe he got off.

[01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.650]
I don't know.

[01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.630]
Sound like it.

[01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:01.310]
Here's Daniel.

[01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.690]
Hello.

[01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:04.370]
Daniel.

[01:36:04.750 --> 01:36:05.010]
Neil.

[01:36:05.490 --> 01:36:05.870]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.850]
How are you?

[01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:07.630]
I'm doing good.

[01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.890]
Hey, Neil.

[01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:11.450]
I love that thing you read about Shrub.

[01:36:11.770 --> 01:36:16.850]
But do you notice that every time W has a speech he throws in about five lies in the speech with the truth?

[01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:19.830]
And the people don't even see what yesterday's lie was.

[01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:23.370]
No matter if I gave the tax cuts or not, we still be in a deficit.

[01:36:23.850 --> 01:36:24.030]
Right.

[01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:25.630]
And you know that's a bullface lie.

[01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:27.450]
Trillion dollars in tax cuts.

[01:36:27.690 --> 01:36:27.930]
Yeah.

[01:36:28.170 --> 01:36:35.010]
And he said he had a, with the stray face, he said, even if I would have given those massive tax cuts, we would still be in deficit.

[01:36:35.410 --> 01:36:41.170]
In fact, Paul Vagallar was screaming on Crossfire yesterday that they got 28 billion dollars as the entire budget for online security.

[01:36:41.530 --> 01:36:44.590]
And we've got a trillion dollar tax cut over the next 10 years for the ultra-rich.

[01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.210]
Yeah.

[01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:45.670]
Yeah.

[01:36:45.670 --> 01:36:46.190]
Eight line.

[01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:53.570]
And then we're trying to, and now when they're threatening about more tax and more hijackings, what are they going to do?

[01:36:53.650 --> 01:36:57.670]
They were going to cut way back on air marshals and then they changed their mind because they got caught with their pants down.

[01:36:58.030 --> 01:37:05.450]
And they've cut back thousands of airport screeners all around the country now, coming right at the time, right before just before all of this new threats come about.

[01:37:05.850 --> 01:37:05.970]
Yeah.

[01:37:06.490 --> 01:37:09.010]
Yeah. I just wonder if people don't look at things.

[01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:11.390]
I don't believe anything someone says.

[01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.150]
If they say it's black, I'm going to go check and see if it's black.

[01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:14.730]
Yeah.

[01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:18.890]
And people just, oh yeah, we'll accept whatever he says, whatever this one says.

[01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.970]
I can't get.

[01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:28.590]
Look, after all the lies he's told by now between the weapons of mass destruction and the ties with Sodom and Elkada and every other damn thing, how can anybody believe him on anything?

[01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:32.570]
He's a neurotic psychopathic liar. He can't control himself.

[01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:34.650]
Yeah, but you know his pose are falling like a rock.

[01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:36.310]
I mean, he's like, I do know that, yes.

[01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:38.110]
He's in the 50% range right now.

[01:37:38.210 --> 01:37:38.350]
Right.

[01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:41.030]
And we're going to get a strong person making some sense.

[01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:42.830]
Well, who's that going to be?

[01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:45.430]
I don't know. I mean, I only like Dean because he's kind of handsome.

[01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:47.070]
I don't know.

[01:37:47.210 --> 01:37:47.530]
I don't know.

[01:37:47.530 --> 01:37:52.690]
I can't go with Graham because he was, you know, he was on the wrong side of Ileon and I don't go for that guy.

[01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:55.010]
He's a political whore. He'll say whatever.

[01:37:55.430 --> 01:37:55.790]
Who's that?

[01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.750]
Graham. He seems like a political whore.

[01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:58.410]
I don't think he was that way.

[01:37:58.970 --> 01:38:01.790]
Every poll he's got one percent. He's got the same one percent.

[01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:04.570]
And I have to worry about Bobby, although, you know, I think I like him.

[01:38:04.730 --> 01:38:07.190]
How about Dean and get somebody else in here?

[01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:08.490]
I want to see some good-looking men.

[01:38:08.590 --> 01:38:10.250]
How about that one from South Carolina Edwards?

[01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:11.350]
Oh, God.

[01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.970]
Yeah, I like him.

[01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.910]
No way.

[01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:15.090]
What he can't do when he worse than about the W is doing.

[01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.930]
No way. Who's that?

[01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:16.690]
Have a great life, fella.

[01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:18.570]
Okay. Maybe, maybe, maybe a Howard Dino Lopoda.

[01:38:18.670 --> 01:38:20.350]
I don't know. Maybe you can go to Vermont and get a gay marriage.

[01:38:21.650 --> 01:38:21.930]
Woo!

[01:38:22.450 --> 01:38:24.950]
Man. That was pretty scintillating, you know what?

[01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:27.090]
Yeah.

[01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:29.410]
Well, I asked him a serious question.

[01:38:29.550 --> 01:38:31.930]
Who's going to be that strong candidate that's going to oust W?

[01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:33.750]
Because I think he's there for the pick and he's right.

[01:38:34.190 --> 01:38:35.130]
You can smell it.

[01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:36.030]
Who's it going to be?

[01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.730]
Joe Lieberman.

[01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:38.410]
Uh, Joe Lieberman.

[01:38:38.410 --> 01:38:38.970]
I know. Yeah.

[01:38:39.370 --> 01:38:41.070]
In fact, I bet you that got a cub before the hits.

[01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.570]
You like poison?

[01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:43.310]
You probably like to vote 20 or 30 hundred times.

[01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.610]
Oh, yeah.

[01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:44.970]
You got a five for Joe Lieberman.

[01:38:45.890 --> 01:38:47.050]
No chance, baby.

[01:38:47.370 --> 01:38:51.090]
Joe Lieberman is the reason that George W was able to steal the election in the first place.

[01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:54.570]
You hear that only on this program and you want to know why because it is...

[01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:55.910]
Absolutely correct.

[01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.530]
Right.

[01:38:58.130 --> 01:39:01.110]
26 past noon at 5.60 WQAM.

[01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:03.070]
How much weight have you been gaining over the last few months?

[01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:05.670]
If you're like most other Americans, then you're big as a...

[01:39:05.670 --> 01:39:06.430]
A house.

[01:39:06.890 --> 01:39:07.510]
Big as a tub.

[01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:10.870]
That's why we hardly enthusiastically recommend balance for life.

[01:39:11.170 --> 01:39:15.030]
Because all of us fat people, we know all the diets, the addkins diet, the watermelon diet,

[01:39:15.230 --> 01:39:19.310]
the grapefruit diet, the banana diet, the eggs and whatever.

[01:39:19.770 --> 01:39:21.070]
Yeah, there's a minute of mouth there.

[01:39:21.390 --> 01:39:22.770]
And some of them actually work for you.

[01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:26.630]
But if you're frustrated because none of those weight loss programs have done the job that you're looking for,

[01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:29.290]
you really ought to be yourself a favorite and try balance for life.

[01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:30.270]
Because it's so simple.

[01:39:30.910 --> 01:39:31.570]
There's no cooking.

[01:39:31.810 --> 01:39:32.390]
There's no shopping.

[01:39:32.510 --> 01:39:32.850]
No cleaning.

[01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:33.590]
Nothing to worry about.

[01:39:33.710 --> 01:39:34.810]
No calorie counting.

[01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.990]
No carbohydrate counting.

[01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:37.910]
No big survey to fill out ahead of time.

[01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:39.870]
The only thing you fill out is a little menu every week.

[01:39:40.390 --> 01:39:42.710]
And you have two choices for each meal every day that's your own program.

[01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:48.010]
And by the way, balance for life is the only company that gives you two choices for each meal and snack on a program every day.

[01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:49.150]
And that's it.

[01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:51.470]
And they deliver all your food in a black sack every morning.

[01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:53.690]
And there it is by 6 a.m. right at your doorstep.

[01:39:54.050 --> 01:39:56.770]
Three gourmet meals, two delicious nights, all fresh delicious goodies.

[01:39:57.150 --> 01:40:00.450]
The beast informed us that the food as good as it was before is even better than ever.

[01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:02.370]
And I bet you know Boba Ghanouch either, huh?

[01:40:02.590 --> 01:40:04.190]
Maybe a little Boba Lou, but no Boba Ghanouch.

[01:40:05.050 --> 01:40:07.130]
So the bottom line is with balance for life.

[01:40:07.150 --> 01:40:07.810]
You're not starving.

[01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:11.230]
You don't have no desire to cheat because you're full and satisfied all day long.

[01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:18.890]
So once and for all, if you're out of shape, if you're overweight, if you're in really sick shape and diabetic, maybe let balance for life take care of this once and for all.

[01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.550]
Call them today.

[01:40:19.990 --> 01:40:22.750]
9.5.4.5.6.8.32.29.

[01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:25.990]
9.5.4.5.6.8.32.29.

[01:40:26.230 --> 01:40:28.370]
You'll be starting to see results within just a matter of days.

[01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:32.490]
You can also get more info on their program on their website balanceforlife.com.

[01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:35.070]
9.5.4.5.6.9.

[01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:36.690]
This is 420560.

[01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:38.970]
You weigh him.

[01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:41.530]
Don't hate you.

[01:40:42.090 --> 01:40:44.330]
Are you suffering from a record dysfunction?

[01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:46.810]
Romance, just not what it used to be.

[01:40:47.230 --> 01:40:47.430]
Really?

[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:49.710]
Man, what up pussy?

[01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.830]
I don't know.

[01:40:51.230 --> 01:40:52.350]
You got to be kidding.

[01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:55.350]
You mean to tell me you're just hanging a droopy prune?

[01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:57.790]
Wow, you're a sissy.

[01:40:58.190 --> 01:40:59.550]
You're not even gay.

[01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:01.930]
You're beyond gay, dude.

[01:41:01.930 --> 01:41:05.210]
Wouldn't you have someone lift a spoon of cornflakes for you in the morning?

[01:41:05.690 --> 01:41:09.330]
Let's face it, if you really need this stuff, you're not a man at all.

[01:41:09.650 --> 01:41:11.870]
I mean how many men actually need this garbage?

[01:41:12.330 --> 01:41:12.670]
Really?

[01:41:13.290 --> 01:41:17.670]
Anybody who buys theme is in hand, so just wants to get bigger and stay that way overnight.

[01:41:17.990 --> 01:41:18.570]
That's all.

[01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:20.870]
There's no real medical use for it.

[01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:22.530]
Unless you're a swishy-whose.

[01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:23.890]
What do you offended?

[01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:26.130]
Hey, we're a pharmaceutical company.

[01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:28.870]
We can do any goddamn thing we want now.

[01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:33.110]
Any sh** we got on his shelf will make you think you need it.

[01:41:33.130 --> 01:41:33.910]
And guess what?

[01:41:34.110 --> 01:41:35.890]
You're so f**king stupid.

[01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:39.650]
I can say all this and you'll still run to your doctor for a script.

[01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:41.370]
Oh man, what a loser.

[01:41:41.690 --> 01:41:42.570]
Probably Republican.

[01:41:43.450 --> 01:41:46.930]
It's at 131 at 560 W.D.C.

[01:41:46.930 --> 01:41:49.150]
I got a very disturbing fax here to bring this to me.

[01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:50.730]
Why is it disturbing?

[01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:54.990]
It says I just got back from a trip overseas, but a couple of days in Amsterdam.

[01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:58.710]
I could have saved a lot of money by taking I-95 South to Overtown.

[01:41:59.310 --> 01:42:03.810]
In fact, downtown Amsterdam makes Miami look like the cleanest, friendlyest city in the world.

[01:42:04.170 --> 01:42:08.710]
The word that comes to mind to describe Amsterdam is raunchy, along with all of its synonyms.

[01:42:08.910 --> 01:42:09.870]
Belgium was outstanding.

[01:42:10.170 --> 01:42:15.290]
Well, see, I have to gauge for myself because it sounds to me like I'd who sent this fax.

[01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:16.530]
Maybe that was his first time there?

[01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.870]
Okay.

[01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:19.730]
I don't know.

[01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:23.530]
But I mean, some people would have gone there like five years ago.

[01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:26.370]
And said, wow, this is a really raunchy place.

[01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:29.110]
You know, Bohemian would have had a little bit of a describe it.

[01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:31.530]
But if there's a lot of people there, it'll be fine.

[01:42:31.850 --> 01:42:32.410]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:42:33.050 --> 01:42:33.190]
No.

[01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:38.310]
If there are a lot of tourists there and the city is really hopping and buzzing, it'll be great.

[01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:43.930]
It's only when the locals are there and the rost-of-drug crowd out there in the streets.

[01:42:43.930 --> 01:42:45.930]
And there's not much else going that they stand.

[01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:47.970]
They're so conspicuous because I'm used to that.

[01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:52.270]
But when they're the only thing there, it's kind of disturbing and you get on a train and go to Cologne immediately.

[01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:55.390]
I'm going to tell you right now, and this is the honest to go this truth.

[01:42:55.510 --> 01:43:00.690]
If anybody in the world out there wants to go to a place, you got some bucks, you got some vacation time, I'm begging you.

[01:43:00.810 --> 01:43:05.830]
In fact, they just had a big story out in life because they had a big hail storm.

[01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:09.710]
So I'd get a hail storm in Cologne, very bizarre, you know, like in the middle of July.

[01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:13.550]
And they showed it looked like it had snowed about a foot and it was all hail.

[01:43:14.630 --> 01:43:16.410]
All I went all the hail in Cologne.

[01:43:16.530 --> 01:43:18.270]
But anyway, seriously, I'm not exaggerating.

[01:43:18.270 --> 01:43:19.490]
It's such a fabulous city.

[01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:21.250]
And there's so much to see.

[01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:25.610]
And even just in the train station is spectacular.

[01:43:25.770 --> 01:43:26.750]
What does that tell you?

[01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.970]
God's.

[01:43:29.130 --> 01:43:29.730]
I beg your pardon?

[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:30.330]
Nothing.

[01:43:30.670 --> 01:43:32.250]
Are you picking on my German friends again?

[01:43:32.470 --> 01:43:32.610]
Yeah.

[01:43:33.190 --> 01:43:34.310]
I'll see you there you go.

[01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:37.490]
I'll see you try to cover up because that the, that's a night guy.

[01:43:37.770 --> 01:43:39.470]
No, no, nothing to do with you.

[01:43:39.530 --> 01:43:44.310]
No, no, seriously, Cologne is a fab- and the people there are beautiful and they're fabulous and the food.

[01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:45.190]
They're just everything.

[01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:48.230]
And man, you want to get your hands on a good bratwurst, be an avoid.

[01:43:50.690 --> 01:43:52.090]
Just be careful where you put it.

[01:43:53.190 --> 01:43:57.250]
Anyway, it says Fat Pig Out story for your five corn dogs last night at the Marlin game.

[01:43:57.370 --> 01:43:58.490]
Two emberstical and tell you.

[01:43:58.670 --> 01:44:01.810]
Yeah, they're all too emberst to tell me because I'm the only honest one about my pig and out.

[01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:03.690]
Everybody else lie or lie.

[01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:05.190]
They all keep getting fat or fat.

[01:44:05.290 --> 01:44:06.830]
Oh, and you're the only one addicted to sugar.

[01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:09.170]
You're the only one eating a tubs of ice cream, right?

[01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:14.510]
Anyway, he's got a couple of George Paul suggestions, which is, this is very strange because his suggestions

[01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:16.110]
better than the mole man.

[01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:17.250]
Of course, that could be anybody.

[01:44:17.310 --> 01:44:21.450]
That could be a dead man or good producer sidekick, but then in very tiny print on the bottom.

[01:44:22.150 --> 01:44:25.110]
He says, shameless request, more ripped George shows.

[01:44:25.230 --> 01:44:27.010]
See, even the people who like you enjoy these shows.

[01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.950]
Sure, what's not?

[01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:29.670]
And this wasn't a ripped George show.

[01:44:30.190 --> 01:44:35.750]
Look, when I do a poll like this, it's very possible that 90% of the people are called in or voted on a poll.

[01:44:35.850 --> 01:44:36.210]
Critic-

[01:44:37.330 --> 01:44:37.690]
What?

[01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.430]
Critic-

[01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:38.670]
Yeah.

[01:44:39.110 --> 01:44:39.370]
Indian?

[01:44:39.890 --> 01:44:40.950]
Entertaining or he's okay?

[01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:42.690]
It's not?

[01:44:43.210 --> 01:44:43.570]
No.

[01:44:43.570 --> 01:44:43.670]
No.

[01:44:44.130 --> 01:44:44.490]
Why?

[01:44:45.010 --> 01:44:46.090]
Because I'm not you.

[01:44:47.570 --> 01:44:48.690]
So what the hell does that mean?

[01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:55.650]
See, what you don't understand is that I keep telling you this every year because you run in the summer and all of the cases of this pressure.

[01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:57.590]
And sometimes the people are listening now.

[01:44:57.690 --> 01:44:58.550]
It's not my audience.

[01:44:59.430 --> 01:45:03.370]
Some of it is, but there's a big part of the audience who have that hate me like poison.

[01:45:03.610 --> 01:45:04.350]
They don't want to hear me.

[01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:05.150]
They're either, huh?

[01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.590]
Yeah, right.

[01:45:07.390 --> 01:45:08.030]
He's laughing.

[01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.690]
I'm serious.

[01:45:08.690 --> 01:45:18.090]
You have a certain number of anal obsessed, pot-smoking, swing club attending, searching, whatever.

[01:45:18.490 --> 01:45:19.570]
And they're not interested in me.

[01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:20.670]
They want to hear your crap, man.

[01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:21.290]
I mean, people's that.

[01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:21.630]
Yeah.

[01:45:21.970 --> 01:45:22.770]
No, I'd say.

[01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:23.710]
Stop, good man.

[01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:24.630]
Yeah.

[01:45:25.210 --> 01:45:26.670]
There's definitely a following there.

[01:45:27.190 --> 01:45:27.430]
Right.

[01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.830]
Right.

[01:45:29.410 --> 01:45:34.810]
So it's not like I'm doing this during the middle of what I'm doing a show all the time, like you know, like in October or something.

[01:45:34.810 --> 01:45:36.330]
This is your time now.

[01:45:36.570 --> 01:45:37.890]
And you're still doing pretty loosing.

[01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.930]
Let's see.

[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:41.770]
Let's go to Fort Lauderdale.

[01:45:42.070 --> 01:45:42.070]

[01:45:42.710 --> 01:45:43.390]
Well, is that me?

[01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:44.430]
That's you, yes.

[01:45:44.930 --> 01:45:45.070]
Yeah.

[01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:46.910]
And I just want to say, I use respect you.

[01:45:47.110 --> 01:45:49.290]
But all I can't have hold of an anti-bushed-up is garbage.

[01:45:49.770 --> 01:45:50.430]
I know there'll be half of that.

[01:45:50.470 --> 01:45:51.110]
More out your ass.

[01:45:51.570 --> 01:45:52.190]
More out your ass.

[01:45:52.910 --> 01:45:54.950]
He used to respect me, but by giving my honest opinion.

[01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:57.230]
More than half of America agrees with me now, sir.

[01:45:57.310 --> 01:46:01.370]
And probably 80% of the rest of the free world I've got to IQ larger than the thumb, unlike you.

[01:46:01.910 --> 01:46:04.670]
I'm not going to sit here and give political opinions to try to please you.

[01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:05.390]
Bye-bye.

[01:46:05.610 --> 01:46:07.990]
Rather than call me and give me a song that's used to respect me.

[01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:08.190]
Okay.

[01:46:08.530 --> 01:46:12.350]
I've been a liberal Democrat and even though the Democratic Party sucks that I tell you that.

[01:46:12.590 --> 01:46:13.370]
All of my life.

[01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:17.550]
And then for me to start co-zing up to some right wing bunch of fascist lunatics.

[01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:19.850]
Some corporate licking assholes.

[01:46:19.850 --> 01:46:20.710]
They're not going to happen.

[01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:21.070]
Okay.

[01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:22.110]
So don't act like that.

[01:46:22.230 --> 01:46:26.050]
I've done some wild turn to the left, or I've done this, or I've done it because I haven't done it.

[01:46:27.110 --> 01:46:27.830]
I'm consistent.

[01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:28.750]
Consistently right.

[01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.390]
Okay.

[01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:31.850]
Not to the right politically, but correct.

[01:46:33.090 --> 01:46:33.450]
Right.

[01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:35.870]
That's saying he's called with us in crappy foreign.

[01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:36.550]
He's been listening.

[01:46:36.710 --> 01:46:37.630]
He'll never turn it out.

[01:46:37.710 --> 01:46:38.910]
You know, it's saying same garbage, man.

[01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:40.650]
Just call it.

[01:46:40.750 --> 01:46:40.830]
It's there.

[01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:42.450]
Waits for 40 minutes to give me the anything.

[01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:43.970]
I'm not going to listen to his bull crap.

[01:46:44.590 --> 01:46:45.510]
See Kyle Pally.

[01:46:45.670 --> 01:46:46.010]
See Kyle.

[01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:47.990]
Just do a little boost up, man.

[01:46:48.110 --> 01:46:49.070]
Just give me the practice.

[01:46:49.210 --> 01:46:49.710]
There you go.

[01:46:50.330 --> 01:46:51.050]
Check ass.

[01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:53.090]
Here's Miami.

[01:46:53.090 --> 01:46:53.350]
Hello.

[01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:56.610]
Morning, sir.

[01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.730]
When is to you?

[01:46:57.870 --> 01:46:58.270]
Good afternoon.

[01:46:58.270 --> 01:46:59.470]
Absolutely correct.

[01:46:59.630 --> 01:47:00.630]
Play those tardes.

[01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:02.670]
Let me comment on the George thing.

[01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:03.930]
I mean, I'm here to do that.

[01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:05.910]
Yes, because I have made George come up with a time.

[01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:07.270]
Go ahead, my dark, conflicted friend.

[01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:08.450]
George is cool.

[01:47:08.730 --> 01:47:10.950]
One thing about George is he doesn't buy this time.

[01:47:11.230 --> 01:47:12.410]
He says he's gone his mind.

[01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:12.910]
Right.

[01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:14.790]
And he doesn't suck up.

[01:47:15.130 --> 01:47:23.150]
Because if he did, sometimes he expresses this pleasure about gay programs, for instance.

[01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.570]
Right.

[01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:27.110]
And at the risk of a pompous and flat with you.

[01:47:27.110 --> 01:47:30.630]
No, he knows him across any flat because he knows I hate those shows too, so he says.

[01:47:30.850 --> 01:47:31.010]
Right.

[01:47:31.170 --> 01:47:31.870]
He wouldn't do that.

[01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.910]
He's true.

[01:47:33.530 --> 01:47:35.370]
He's not as bad as the fool or call me.

[01:47:35.370 --> 01:47:38.030]
He's the one who has to do his look at me cross side one time.

[01:47:38.690 --> 01:47:38.690]

[01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:40.570]
He's just singing out on George.

[01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:41.270]
Yeah.

[01:47:41.470 --> 01:47:42.130]
He's just cool.

[01:47:42.250 --> 01:47:46.670]
But one thing about it, you'll never get him singing Harvard Nagila.

[01:47:47.190 --> 01:47:47.690]
That's true.

[01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:48.750]
Is that any tagging?

[01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:49.310]
I mean, no.

[01:47:49.690 --> 01:47:49.950]
Okay.

[01:47:50.130 --> 01:47:50.350]
Adios.

[01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:52.170]
I'm not saying that.

[01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:54.410]
So when he's trying to say, is your anti-Semitic?

[01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:55.130]
Is what he was trying to say.

[01:47:55.190 --> 01:47:55.410]
What was that?

[01:47:56.550 --> 01:47:58.050]
Yeah, that's what he was trying to say.

[01:47:58.230 --> 01:47:59.310]
He was trying to observe it.

[01:47:59.350 --> 01:48:00.970]
He realizes that you have this Jew thing.

[01:48:01.450 --> 01:48:02.730]
He even got rid of his Jewish accountant.

[01:48:04.090 --> 01:48:05.490]
Which by the way, that was a good thing.

[01:48:05.690 --> 01:48:07.330]
My Irish accountant may be an opera couldn't refuse.

[01:48:07.650 --> 01:48:07.830]
Good.

[01:48:08.170 --> 01:48:08.450]
Excellent.

[01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:09.230]
I like the Irish.

[01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:12.430]
No, to be accountants, I mean, like, sexual.

[01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:13.550]
I don't want to be anywhere near them.

[01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:16.230]
They're pasty and they're pale and they're, oh, on the contrary.

[01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:17.150]
I like the Irish woman.

[01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:19.990]
Well, I don't know about the Irish woman because I don't really care.

[01:48:20.110 --> 01:48:21.330]
Oh, you mean like, what's your name?

[01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.810]
Andy Camp's wife.

[01:48:24.630 --> 01:48:25.390]
Andy Camp's wife.

[01:48:25.390 --> 01:48:26.310]
Oh, in the cartoon.

[01:48:26.630 --> 01:48:27.150]
In the cartoons.

[01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:29.370]
Yeah, the Irish women are like fat.

[01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:31.570]
They look like washer women, like Portuguese washer women.

[01:48:31.830 --> 01:48:32.430]
Not the ones I've seen.

[01:48:33.210 --> 01:48:33.610]
Okay.

[01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:34.930]
Boy, you know what I'm serious.

[01:48:35.110 --> 01:48:38.770]
It's what a shame that you didn't get the more, see more coverage of this concert here last night.

[01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:40.130]
Oh, I'm serious.

[01:48:40.130 --> 01:48:40.610]
I'm serious.

[01:48:40.810 --> 01:48:42.770]
I, you know, the music was fine.

[01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:45.330]
It was okay, but I'm watching on TV.

[01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:47.330]
It'd actually been the old purve that I am.

[01:48:47.490 --> 01:48:49.110]
I'm watching those young people in the crowd.

[01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:51.450]
And of course, it was a hot afternoon evening.

[01:48:51.650 --> 01:48:53.470]
And the guys, most of them had their shirts off.

[01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:57.730]
And like I told you, a couple of the girls had their shirts off, which was pretty exciting for some.

[01:48:58.150 --> 01:48:59.790]
And it was unbelievable.

[01:49:00.610 --> 01:49:08.450]
You see, because generally speaking, this is a city that's like most real cities that has loads and loads of young people living and breathing beautiful people.

[01:49:08.590 --> 01:49:09.790]
You can walk out like downtown.

[01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:13.790]
You go out on a young street and like go to a restaurant to sit there at the window and look out.

[01:49:13.930 --> 01:49:14.990]
And your tongue is down here.

[01:49:15.190 --> 01:49:17.310]
Down here, knees, down here, ankles.

[01:49:17.930 --> 01:49:21.230]
Because there are so many beautiful people to pick and choose and squeeze from.

[01:49:21.230 --> 01:49:21.890]
See what I'm saying?

[01:49:22.210 --> 01:49:24.610]
As opposed to South Florida where the average age is about 90.

[01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:29.550]
In addition to which you've had a whole bunch of banana boat, people look like the space ship just landed.

[01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:32.510]
I mean, I don't mind banana boat people if they look human.

[01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:40.190]
But for some reason, South Florida seems to have attracted a lot of banana boat people that look like, you know, my favorite Martian or something.

[01:49:40.450 --> 01:49:41.470]
You know what I'm talking about, sure.

[01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:43.490]
You see it in your car.

[01:49:43.630 --> 01:49:45.150]
You're out there trying to drive on a highway.

[01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:46.010]
It's frustrating enough.

[01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:49.250]
And you look to your left and you swore to your right to try to stay alive.

[01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:54.150]
And you're looking at those assholes that are out there and you wonder to yourself, who are these people?

[01:49:54.250 --> 01:49:55.750]
I can't tell you how many times I've done it.

[01:49:56.270 --> 01:50:01.450]
You're looking and hopefully maybe once in a while you'll see somebody who looks, you know, if you're early attracted, might be interesting, you know.

[01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:04.250]
Maybe a little cruise right out there on the highway, a real one.

[01:50:05.330 --> 01:50:06.010]
And they'll be an asshole.

[01:50:06.630 --> 01:50:07.250]
I beg your pardon?

[01:50:07.810 --> 01:50:09.390]
And chances are they'll be an asshole.

[01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:13.650]
And it'll be like Beanerboy sitting there but has got the emlicence plate stuck up his ass.

[01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:16.330]
Maybe that's what the cop was upset about the other day.

[01:50:16.330 --> 01:50:17.490]
Maybe that thing is you know.

[01:50:17.850 --> 01:50:21.290]
And of course Beanerboy is trying to put anything there to try to heal it up real fast.

[01:50:23.150 --> 01:50:25.230]
In fact, I got a great name for Beanerboy.

[01:50:25.890 --> 01:50:26.090]
Oh, no.

[01:50:26.090 --> 01:50:28.370]
Since he came out today, how about the Vaseline Queen?

[01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.730]
Oh no.

[01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.710]
Oh no.

[01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.030]

[01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.230]
Oh no.

[01:50:32.770 --> 01:50:33.490]
Vaseline Queen.

[01:50:33.690 --> 01:50:35.410]
Oh, I think we got our thumb on it, baby.

[01:50:35.570 --> 01:50:36.570]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:36.690 --> 01:50:37.050]
VQ.

[01:50:37.570 --> 01:50:38.210]
Yeah, VQ.

[01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:39.750]
So no more Beanerboy.

[01:50:39.850 --> 01:50:41.230]
It's going to be VQ from here on in.

[01:50:41.630 --> 01:50:41.950]
VQ.

[01:50:42.710 --> 01:50:43.170]
Got it?

[01:50:46.370 --> 01:50:47.610]
The Vaseline Queen.

[01:50:47.850 --> 01:50:48.050]
VQ.

[01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:48.250]

[01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.190]
See?

[01:50:49.770 --> 01:50:53.130]
I told you, judges of session with Amel's stuff would finally rub off on you, so to speak.

[01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:55.030]
I wasn't even able to know the ones probably should have.

[01:50:55.670 --> 01:50:55.950]
I know.

[01:50:56.270 --> 01:50:57.470]
There were a lot of guys rubbed off on it.

[01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:58.210]
I just took the pictures.

[01:50:58.690 --> 01:50:59.230]
Squirt, Squirt.

[01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.510]
Yeah.

[01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:01.390]
I wish I was your dad.

[01:51:04.150 --> 01:51:06.410]
Anybody hasn't seen the pictures go to the arises.com.

[01:51:06.690 --> 01:51:08.730]
There is something screwed on the internet today, by the way.

[01:51:08.730 --> 01:51:12.830]
The email thing is just sometimes you can't even get through on it.

[01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:16.690]
Did we ever find out about the streaming that ever come back or not?

[01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:18.670]
It's, they're still working on it.

[01:51:18.810 --> 01:51:20.130]
Half the people have it.

[01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:20.990]
Half the people don't.

[01:51:21.090 --> 01:51:22.210]
I'm getting calls both ways.

[01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:23.910]
Well, I'm pretty peeled about that.

[01:51:24.110 --> 01:51:24.750]
I don't go both ways.

[01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:26.910]
I'm just getting phone calls both ways.

[01:51:27.670 --> 01:51:28.390]
I see.

[01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:30.030]
Oh, okay, VQ.

[01:51:31.450 --> 01:51:31.850]
1240.

[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:33.630]
20 to 1 at 5.

[01:51:33.810 --> 01:51:34.490]
60 WQ.

[01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:38.510]
If you're in a dead end job, or maybe you just have a dead end like Carlos does now.

[01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.910]
Right, Tom.

[01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.730]
I mean, VQ does.

[01:51:40.330 --> 01:51:44.070]
Maybe Carlos is too expensive and just have to have four years to wait to start getting

[01:51:44.070 --> 01:51:44.510]
their career.

[01:51:44.970 --> 01:51:48.090]
If you, well, you've come down and you can also, you know, you can shut the mic off

[01:51:48.090 --> 01:51:49.870]
while I'm doing the spot, but I know you're a game.

[01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:53.930]
If you can afford 10 bucks a month to commit yourself three nights a week for four months,

[01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:57.030]
fast-training, can help you achieve a new high-paying computer career.

[01:51:57.130 --> 01:51:57.630]
That is correct.

[01:51:57.930 --> 01:52:01.470]
Just 10 bucks a month and three nights a week for only four months for people to qualify.

They say to be careful, but one more can I do?

[01:53:44.210 --> 01:53:48.830]
I can be dead in two days, or I could have a flu.

[01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:55.070]
I'm fucking better than you, because of that guy me laughing.

[01:53:55.570 --> 01:54:00.510]
And the center is wet, but I watch my back and get slid attacked.

[01:54:07.610 --> 01:54:10.510]
I'm a bad dog, the one and only a two, the Humper at four.

[01:54:11.730 --> 01:54:14.470]
And then I guess, let me just take a look at this schedule, because Duff was saying,

[01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:15.830]
Hank is going back on vacation again.

[01:54:15.930 --> 01:54:17.530]
Oh, that's our look who's on tomorrow at the four.

[01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.850]
Wow.

[01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:23.610]
So a lot of vacations, a lot of mohazam vacation right now, everybody in the building is

[01:54:23.610 --> 01:54:24.430]
in a really great mood.

[01:54:24.570 --> 01:54:26.550]
Even I'm up here, it's rubbing off, you know what I'm saying?

[01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:29.430]
Yeah, I feel so much better about life.

[01:54:29.610 --> 01:54:33.850]
Just knowing that he's not around, he's like the dark cloud that hangs over everybody's existence.

[01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:39.190]
Which of these terms best describes George were getting close to 450 on air?

[01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:39.550]
What do we got?

[01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:41.190]
442 votes?

[01:54:42.070 --> 01:54:44.330]
In mature 3, going from the bottom up.

[01:54:44.890 --> 01:54:51.390]
Ant� Semitic 5, pervert 10, self-hating spick is tied with essentially frustrated 11,

[01:54:51.670 --> 01:54:54.530]
so I guess you could say self-hating is sexually frustrated, spick.

[01:54:55.190 --> 01:54:59.830]
11 anal, plants been stuck on 11 for a long time, VQ.

[01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:04.630]
Hard aspic and pseudo-intellectual and juvenile, each with 12.

[01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:10.230]
Mediocre 13, I hope everybody in the building starts looking at being a point I'll call

[01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:11.070]
them VQ, okay?

[01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:14.530]
So we can all, you know, being able was just catching on.

[01:55:14.770 --> 01:55:16.350]
No, we need to be able to do this.

[01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:19.290]
It's Passe, it's Passe VQ, the Brazilian queen.

[01:55:20.150 --> 01:55:20.970]
Oh, God.

[01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:23.130]
Now where was I on the list?

[01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:27.010]
Su-intellectual 13, Mediocre 14, Curefran-Somia 16,

[01:55:27.530 --> 01:55:34.450]
Noah L'Aitine, Brilliant 19, Podhead and Closet Queen, 21 of peace, entertaining 41,

[01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:39.690]
wannabe 49, boring, assisti 1, but he's okay, okay.

[01:55:40.530 --> 01:55:40.930]
98.

[01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:44.550]
And like I said, that was an active brilliance,

[01:55:44.970 --> 01:55:47.370]
brilliant you get more, because that wasn't active brilliance on your part.

[01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:50.930]
Because when I made my original list, he's okay, it wasn't even,

[01:55:51.110 --> 01:55:52.550]
it never even entered my mind.

[01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:54.290]
Well, that's the right answer.

[01:55:57.410 --> 01:55:59.410]
Here is Carl Springs, hello.

[01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.450]
Hello.

[01:56:00.990 --> 01:56:01.490]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:04.570]
Except for the brilliant, entertaining, he's okay.

[01:56:05.190 --> 01:56:07.210]
All the choices are appropriate for George.

[01:56:07.650 --> 01:56:08.770]
You talk to nowhere to vote.

[01:56:09.330 --> 01:56:09.550]
Yeah.

[01:56:10.150 --> 01:56:15.930]
But anyway, I just wanted to tell you there's a bunch of us out there that want to vote against

[01:56:15.930 --> 01:56:16.270]
Bush.

[01:56:16.730 --> 01:56:21.810]
And we want to vote against Bush not because of a rep, but because of the economy.

[01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.570]
Yeah.

[01:56:22.670 --> 01:56:26.150]
And I think Quinn was right when he said it's still the economy,

[01:56:26.150 --> 01:56:28.790]
and it's the economy that's coming to feed him next year.

[01:56:29.230 --> 01:56:30.850]
Let's across our legs and fingers, man.

[01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:31.430]
I hope you're right.

[01:56:31.790 --> 01:56:32.470]
All right, then.

[01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:33.310]
Thanks.

[01:56:33.490 --> 01:56:37.690]
Vote early off, man, because that article from a few days ago, I never had a chance to talk about it,

[01:56:38.050 --> 01:56:41.410]
about the whole of this computerized voting thing, and how easy it is to fix.

[01:56:42.270 --> 01:56:42.710]
Right.

[01:56:43.090 --> 01:56:44.950]
And how many more there's going to be this year than left?

[01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:45.330]
Right.

[01:56:45.530 --> 01:56:47.290]
So do you think we had problems last time?

[01:56:47.370 --> 01:56:48.250]
You ain't seen nothing yet.

[01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:52.870]
And with these, because there's no, there's no tangible evidence.

[01:56:53.030 --> 01:56:54.130]
There's no paper trail.

[01:56:55.170 --> 01:56:59.730]
It's just like in the ETHRIC, it's just a number that comes out of a machine somewhere.

[01:57:00.190 --> 01:57:03.930]
And you know, and once it's done, once you've punched the button and left,

[01:57:04.670 --> 01:57:07.590]
how do you know what it shows up as?

[01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.990]
Right.

[01:57:08.670 --> 01:57:09.490]
You don't know how you know what?

[01:57:09.690 --> 01:57:09.910]
Huh?

[01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:10.550]
You don't.

[01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:12.690]
It's crap, okay?

[01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:16.790]
I say paper ballad with crayons for everybody.

[01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:17.690]
That's the way to do it.

[01:57:18.990 --> 01:57:20.630]
Just a bunch of places to check.

[01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:22.910]
And if you're really too stupid, just make an X anything.

[01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:27.390]
How come it used to be that they knew how to do an election?

[01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:30.350]
Well, once upon a time, well, they thought they knew how to do it.

[01:57:30.490 --> 01:57:33.030]
Before the Gravrovers decided that there were better ways to fix it.

[01:57:33.210 --> 01:57:33.330]
Right.

[01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:37.870]
And by the way, this next year, we got some bad news for the right wingers.

[01:57:38.010 --> 01:57:40.290]
There will be a few people, Black people, on the vote.

[01:57:40.290 --> 01:57:41.350]
But third man.

[01:57:41.350 --> 01:57:44.290]
And instead of floater, they will allow a few Black folks to vote this time.

[01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:45.190]
But third man.

[01:57:45.270 --> 01:57:45.770]
No, it'll be it.

[01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:46.470]
Which is a start.

[01:57:48.010 --> 01:57:49.150]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:57:49.150 --> 01:57:49.470]
Hello.

[01:57:50.350 --> 01:57:50.870]
You mean?

[01:57:51.290 --> 01:57:51.770]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:52.370]
Sounds like you.

[01:57:53.150 --> 01:57:53.750]
Look at that.

[01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:56.490]
I transferred you to the handset from the hands free.

[01:57:56.530 --> 01:57:57.070]
No problem.

[01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:58.130]
This time, I was outstanding.

[01:57:58.410 --> 01:57:58.610]
Yeah.

[01:57:59.110 --> 01:58:03.070]
Listen, first off, let me preface what I'm going to say with George, etc.

[01:58:03.790 --> 01:58:07.130]
Within a perfect world, I could listen to Joe Rose in the morning.

[01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.730]
Right.

[01:58:07.730 --> 01:58:10.390]
You in the afternoon, the mad dog killed six.

[01:58:10.750 --> 01:58:14.950]
And then for the early evening, so I have the choice of turning him on or off.

[01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:15.250]
Right.

[01:58:15.470 --> 01:58:16.090]
Too much baseball.

[01:58:17.230 --> 01:58:21.770]
But anyway, George, I'm a 40-year-old heterosexual male.

[01:58:22.130 --> 01:58:24.970]
But dude, you get stale after like 10 minutes.

[01:58:25.150 --> 01:58:26.490]
It's the same thing over and over.

[01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:29.050]
I mean, nothing against George.

[01:58:29.290 --> 01:58:30.670]
I'll listen to him on and off.

[01:58:30.950 --> 01:58:32.050]
But you know.

[01:58:32.050 --> 01:58:33.990]
Well, what is it that he talks about?

[01:58:34.150 --> 01:58:36.610]
Is it his internet connection that he's having so many problems with?

[01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:39.510]
There isn't the swinging club or the anal fixation.

[01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.970]
Which are those?

[01:58:40.750 --> 01:58:45.470]
You know, I mean, the sex and all that is great, but it gets more quick.

[01:58:45.710 --> 01:58:48.050]
First of all, if you're getting a bit of talk about it, talk about something different.

[01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:49.730]
Every day, every segment of every day.

[01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:51.230]
So you got the best of George.

[01:58:51.390 --> 01:58:51.890]
Come on, man.

[01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:52.630]
Come on.

[01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:53.270]
They do.

[01:58:53.710 --> 01:58:54.630]
I like George.

[01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:56.090]
I've been telling you how it is.

[01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:57.630]
You got him backed into a corner.

[01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:58.310]
I do.

[01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.750]
I do.

[01:58:58.850 --> 01:58:59.450]
I didn't mean to.

[01:58:59.970 --> 01:59:04.290]
But anyway, I just wanted to have this kind of one buddy who does like him.

[01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:04.750]
Yeah.

[01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:08.630]
But that's because he's, you know, he's his head in the smoke cloud all day.

[01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:10.830]
And he loves that George talks about that.

[01:59:11.090 --> 01:59:13.310]
I will say his name, Guillermo.

[01:59:13.570 --> 01:59:15.770]
So anyway, you know, he knows who he is.

[01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.290]
Okay.

[01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:17.210]
All right, Beth.

[01:59:17.370 --> 01:59:17.790]
Thanks, Paul.

[01:59:17.890 --> 01:59:18.110]
Okay.

[01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:20.590]
Well, that guy didn't like you too much, but you know, they can't all of you.

[01:59:21.310 --> 01:59:24.470]
And in addition to what's, let me ask you this, what's more interesting to hear?

[01:59:24.610 --> 01:59:27.890]
People calling in who like you or people calling in who want to rip you an ass.

[01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.290]
Hold on.

[01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:29.170]
I'll be okay.

[01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.730]
No question.

[01:59:29.850 --> 01:59:30.010]
Okay.

[01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:33.370]
So I think as usual, I may not make something up for a change.

[01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:36.550]
I may have pulled this out of my very antiseptic clean ass.

[01:59:37.830 --> 01:59:40.690]
See one thing about me, VQ, I don't, I don't allow nobody behind.

[01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:41.010]
Okay.

[01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:44.310]
I just, you know, if I'm going to be in the back of the line, I'll stand up against the wall

[01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:45.750]
just to make sure there's nobody behind me.

[01:59:46.790 --> 01:59:47.630]
And I don't do the thing.

[01:59:47.730 --> 01:59:50.930]
And I don't get stoned off my ass and fall asleep especially,

[01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:54.390]
especially when I'm in a position where somebody can sit on my face.

[01:59:54.730 --> 01:59:55.110]
See what I'm saying?

[01:59:55.930 --> 01:59:57.010]
Like I was all hidden.

[01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:59.930]
I mean, how many and we don't even know.

[02:00:00.110 --> 02:00:01.890]
I mean, you know, of course he's fantasizing.

[02:00:01.890 --> 02:00:04.370]
Maybe there were a few women in the crowd, but I don't think so.

[02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:06.510]
It was like a daisy chain of guys.

[02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:07.270]
I would say,

[02:00:08.090 --> 02:00:11.290]
all each sat on his face during that grotesque episode.

[02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:14.570]
The women in the crowd, but they were in the crowd, but they weren't

[02:00:14.570 --> 02:00:15.830]
crowd in the CV, VQ boy.

[02:00:16.110 --> 02:00:16.350]
Okay.

[02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:17.470]
The guys little point up.

[02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:19.270]
George, I know George,

[02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:24.090]
rather than all those guys up and getting the fleets in the middle of a room in the center

[02:00:24.090 --> 02:00:26.610]
of the room in the couch in the middle of the room.

[02:00:26.610 --> 02:00:29.090]
Hickers on our website, by the way, everybody needs to see him.

[02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:30.710]
I will say this.

[02:00:31.090 --> 02:00:32.270]
I want to go on record as saying.

[02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:33.030]
It's fun.

[02:00:33.190 --> 02:00:34.470]
The fact that he is too Marlon's intensive.

[02:00:34.470 --> 02:00:35.890]
Although it is baseball season, you know,

[02:00:36.250 --> 02:00:37.730]
but for all of us, but in this next trend,

[02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:39.210]
then you're going to start seeing a gigantic.

[02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:40.990]
He's going to have a number that's going to be huge.

[02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:42.470]
You'll see.

[02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:43.210]
I'll see.

[02:00:43.590 --> 02:00:46.650]
The only problem being that in the morning, it'll be diluted in half.

[02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:49.050]
In other words, if he got a 10 and mow gets it to,

[02:00:49.230 --> 02:00:52.090]
it'll be a six, which will still be wet from a three and men.

[02:00:52.210 --> 02:00:53.010]
You know, in his last book,

[02:00:53.190 --> 02:00:55.590]
but you won't be able to divide it because in the monthly trends,

[02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:57.190]
we can't go hour by hour.

[02:00:57.330 --> 02:00:58.630]
We can't we can't do this stuff.

[02:00:58.630 --> 02:01:02.110]
As when a full book comes out for those of your ratings experts in the audience.

[02:01:03.130 --> 02:01:03.950]
But you'll see,

[02:01:04.130 --> 02:01:04.970]
you're going to have a big number.

[02:01:05.010 --> 02:01:06.550]
And of course, that'll help you during the summer.

[02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:08.670]
It'll help us, right?

[02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:11.330]
And I still say that with all of the people of George,

[02:01:11.510 --> 02:01:13.410]
as in the past two summers, when he's filled in,

[02:01:13.670 --> 02:01:15.170]
he'll still have, in mid-dabel stuff,

[02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:16.750]
the highest number on the station as a competition.

[02:01:18.170 --> 02:01:19.350]
Is there any doubt about it?

[02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:19.570]
No.

[02:01:19.810 --> 02:01:19.890]
No.

[02:01:20.150 --> 02:01:21.090]
What do you say, VQ, boy?

[02:01:22.630 --> 02:01:22.990]
Absolutely.

[02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:24.130]
No doubt.

[02:01:25.170 --> 02:01:27.990]
Yeah, you don't have to be defensive or depressed about the name.

[02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:31.530]
Everybody, if you're going to have a nickname, at least let's put a little bit of honesty in it.

[02:01:31.850 --> 02:01:33.230]
Being a boy, you're not Mexican.

[02:01:33.730 --> 02:01:34.770]
I mean, being a racist,

[02:01:35.250 --> 02:01:38.290]
the only reason I did that is because it replaced ugly Chuck,

[02:01:38.650 --> 02:01:39.610]
which George came up with,

[02:01:39.690 --> 02:01:41.110]
which I thought was really grotesque.

[02:01:41.150 --> 02:01:41.690]
And as usual,

[02:01:42.350 --> 02:01:43.710]
much more caustic than I am.

[02:01:43.810 --> 02:01:45.570]
George, you know, he'd like to make me out to be the bad guy.

[02:01:45.850 --> 02:01:47.610]
But George is the hard aspect, like I said.

[02:01:48.150 --> 02:01:48.770]
You got a point.

[02:01:48.890 --> 02:01:49.770]
Every time I tell somebody,

[02:01:50.130 --> 02:01:51.110]
I mean, being a boy,

[02:01:51.110 --> 02:01:51.910]
what does that mean?

[02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.450]
Exactly.

[02:01:53.090 --> 02:01:54.970]
It was just an alternative to,

[02:01:55.130 --> 02:01:56.610]
because you do sound like being a boy.

[02:01:57.170 --> 02:01:58.850]
But it was an alternative to ugly Chuck,

[02:01:58.890 --> 02:02:01.210]
which I thought was even though you are extraordinarily ugly

[02:02:01.210 --> 02:02:02.910]
and taking it from me because I know ugly.

[02:02:03.590 --> 02:02:04.290]
I'm an expert.

[02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:05.650]
Well, what I'm going to say is,

[02:02:05.650 --> 02:02:06.890]
sleep on a couch with,

[02:02:06.970 --> 02:02:08.030]
what would be in the ass of that guy?

[02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:11.350]
He's a Vaseline Queen who they sprouted out of the closet,

[02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:13.310]
as they come into the sunshine,

[02:02:13.570 --> 02:02:15.710]
which for a whole year for a Cuban journalist,

[02:02:16.130 --> 02:02:17.410]
a Manicone, a Bugarron,

[02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:19.410]
I think that would have been appropriate there today.

[02:02:20.050 --> 02:02:22.550]
Bugarron to come out and like write it out in public

[02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:23.870]
on a highly rated show to say,

[02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:24.810]
I'm a Fag.

[02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.910]
I'm a Vaseline Queen.

[02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:27.590]
He said, I am very proud of that.

[02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:29.990]
I'm very cultural with my sexuality.

[02:02:30.530 --> 02:02:33.090]
We, you, everybody keeps saying that he was asleep on the couch.

[02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:34.070]
There was a different tweeter.

[02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:35.410]
I never said that I wasn't there.

[02:02:35.610 --> 02:02:37.830]
He appeared to be asleep on a couch.

[02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:41.570]
If you examine the question that I out drunk,

[02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:43.470]
I was drunk,

[02:02:43.830 --> 02:02:45.190]
but actually, they'd be able to sleep.

[02:02:45.770 --> 02:02:46.550]
And you remember nothing.

[02:02:47.470 --> 02:02:50.390]
We posed him like an action figure and he didn't wake up.

[02:02:54.110 --> 02:02:56.450]
So, so that, I think, bears up.

[02:02:56.530 --> 02:02:57.470]
What we're saying all along.

[02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:59.070]
There could have been not 30 guys.

[02:02:59.070 --> 02:03:00.410]
They're going to like 75 guys.

[02:03:00.410 --> 02:03:01.750]
They're taking their turns, huh?

[02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:04.750]
Maybe that's why there was that economy

[02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:06.670]
that gigantic family sized your homes.

[02:03:06.670 --> 02:03:07.250]
I would like,

[02:03:07.410 --> 02:03:08.510]
ah, ah, ah, ah.

[02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.910]
That's the,

[02:03:08.910 --> 02:03:09.790]
that's the,

[02:03:10.050 --> 02:03:10.330]
that's the,

[02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:12.270]
the old Vaseline Queen.

[02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:17.370]
We're supporting the O5C team.

[02:03:18.110 --> 02:03:18.590]
UAM.

[02:03:20.730 --> 02:03:23.190]
Oh, my favorite Republican.

[02:03:23.550 --> 02:03:24.710]
This is Matt Drudge.

[02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:27.850]
And it's time for the school's bear plowing.

[02:03:28.410 --> 02:03:31.070]
It's time once again for the Neil Rogers.

[02:03:31.210 --> 02:03:32.110]
One to two hours.

[02:03:35.430 --> 02:03:36.070]
Oh,

[02:03:36.170 --> 02:03:36.250]
haha.

[02:03:37.310 --> 02:03:37.670]
Oh,

[02:03:39.850 --> 02:03:40.490]
okay,

[02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:40.830]
right.

[02:03:41.310 --> 02:03:41.970]
I saw him.

[02:03:42.570 --> 02:03:42.570]

[02:03:42.730 --> 02:03:43.790]
my pop-up

[02:03:43.790 --> 02:03:44.790]
those there is.

[02:03:45.090 --> 02:03:45.230]
The sweet

[02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:46.370]
feet of my

[02:03:46.370 --> 02:03:46.810]
cow.

[02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.690]
Oh,

[02:03:48.970 --> 02:03:49.070]
my

[02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.530]
friend.

[02:03:49.850 --> 02:03:50.790]
Think of

[02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:51.090]
the

[02:03:52.110 --> 02:03:52.210]
and

[02:03:52.210 --> 02:03:53.070]
the red

[02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:53.370]
and

[02:03:53.370 --> 02:03:53.850]
the

[02:03:54.650 --> 02:03:55.410]
all

[02:03:55.410 --> 02:03:56.890]
nice

[02:03:56.890 --> 02:03:57.170]
all

[02:03:57.170 --> 02:03:58.490]
thank you.

[02:03:58.930 --> 02:03:59.010]
So

[02:03:59.010 --> 02:03:59.370]
the stick

[02:03:59.370 --> 02:03:59.750]
told

[02:03:59.750 --> 02:04:00.650]
I'll

[02:04:00.650 --> 02:04:01.770]
buy

[02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.870]
a small

[02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:04.710]
him in my shaving

[02:04:04.710 --> 02:04:05.510]
dreams.

[02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:06.310]
So I let

[02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.810]
him

[02:04:06.810 --> 02:04:08.170]
all my face.

[02:04:08.730 --> 02:04:10.630]
And I went to work.

[02:04:11.090 --> 02:04:12.370]
I looked like a jerk

[02:04:12.370 --> 02:04:13.570]
and I was fired

[02:04:13.570 --> 02:04:15.070]
in the spring.

[02:04:16.330 --> 02:04:17.770]
Driving home.

[02:04:17.770 --> 02:04:19.430]
I was all alone.

[02:04:19.750 --> 02:04:20.350]
Thinking some

[02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:21.730]
will play a trick some

[02:04:21.730 --> 02:04:22.130]
then.

[02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:24.330]
But in the rear view

[02:04:24.330 --> 02:04:24.770]
there.

[02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:25.850]
I could

[02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:26.290]
take

[02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:27.670]
ages staring

[02:04:27.670 --> 02:04:29.290]
back at me.

[02:04:30.130 --> 02:04:30.670]
Can't

[02:04:30.670 --> 02:04:31.230]
buy

[02:04:32.010 --> 02:04:32.190]
the

[02:04:32.190 --> 02:04:32.870]
solvings

[02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:33.610]
this year.

[02:04:33.930 --> 02:04:34.350]
On this

[02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.590]
big

[02:04:34.590 --> 02:04:35.070]
toes

[02:04:35.070 --> 02:04:35.830]
I will

[02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:36.210]
buy.

[02:04:37.530 --> 02:04:38.470]
I saw him.

[02:04:39.110 --> 02:04:39.590]
My

[02:04:39.590 --> 02:04:40.270]
pop-up

[02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.650]
toes

[02:04:40.650 --> 02:04:41.110]
there is

[02:04:41.110 --> 02:04:41.610]
the sweet

[02:04:41.610 --> 02:04:42.690]
feet of my

[02:04:42.690 --> 02:04:43.130]
cow.

[02:04:44.430 --> 02:04:45.110]
Oh,

[02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.410]
my

[02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:46.010]
friends.

[02:04:46.670 --> 02:04:46.770]
They

[02:04:46.770 --> 02:04:47.090]
come

[02:04:47.090 --> 02:04:47.650]
up

[02:04:48.210 --> 02:04:48.250]
and

[02:04:49.170 --> 02:04:49.650]
they're in

[02:04:49.650 --> 02:04:49.790]
their

[02:04:51.010 --> 02:04:51.090]
cars.

[02:04:51.370 --> 02:04:51.830]
Oh,

[02:04:52.810 --> 02:04:53.610]
I'll

[02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:53.610]

[02:04:53.610 --> 02:04:54.250]
pizza.

[02:04:55.170 --> 02:04:55.350]
Oh,

[02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:55.890]
my

[02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:56.610]

[02:04:56.610 --> 02:04:56.690]
Oh,

[02:04:56.690 --> 02:04:57.330]
my

[02:04:57.890 --> 02:04:57.910]
friends.

[02:04:58.750 --> 02:04:59.550]
Oh,

[02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:01.050]

[02:05:01.050 --> 02:05:01.210]
friends.

[02:05:01.770 --> 02:05:02.430]
Oh,

[02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.490]
my

[02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:05.830]
friends.

[02:05:05.830 --> 02:05:06.810]
I saw him

[02:05:06.810 --> 02:05:08.070]
all beside

[02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:08.590]
of the

[02:05:08.590 --> 02:05:08.890]
time.

[02:05:09.190 --> 02:05:09.430]
Away

[02:05:09.430 --> 02:05:09.650]
the

[02:05:09.650 --> 02:05:10.010]
hook

[02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:10.350]
half

[02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:11.130]
on my

[02:05:11.130 --> 02:05:11.490]
car.

[02:05:12.930 --> 02:05:13.850]
I saw him

[02:05:13.850 --> 02:05:14.950]
in a

[02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:15.390]
forest.

[02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.950]
It

[02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:16.730]
in the

[02:05:16.730 --> 02:05:17.130]
sky.

[02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.590]
It was

[02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:17.790]
a

[02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:18.410]
purge

[02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:18.850]
car.

My line and local line and your sports video 560-USU-A-L

[02:28:22.970 --> 02:28:24.490]
The end

[02:28:27.430 --> 02:28:31.810]
Dad Waggy, all right he who's saying

[02:28:33.430 --> 02:28:39.430]
Use poison gas on his own people's assing

[02:28:41.070 --> 02:28:45.990]
Keep dropping bombs on the shoes

[02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:52.070]
Santa Mike kicked us out of you

[02:28:54.190 --> 02:28:58.570]
That ball check pool ripped up the hole

[02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:05.990]
If I do recall my head looks like a cubaw

[02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:10.890]
I guess he don't need no shampoo

[02:29:12.850 --> 02:29:17.990]
I kicked us out of you

[02:29:20.790 --> 02:29:23.990]
To the guy who's messing with my ass

[02:29:25.470 --> 02:29:29.270]
I'd crack your head like a neck

[02:29:29.270 --> 02:29:33.170]
All right my break a leg yeah

[02:29:33.170 --> 02:29:38.730]
It me I would give me the view

[02:29:39.270 --> 02:29:45.090]
Woody I kicked us out of you

[02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:52.610]
So dig for ash, digs his craze

[02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:59.530]
I'd eat a moth like a cat jokes down my ears

[02:30:00.610 --> 02:30:05.290]
And no king of the Jews

[02:30:05.290 --> 02:30:11.990]
Just be honest I'll give you a big booty

[02:30:13.290 --> 02:30:17.190]
What's with this guy who was broke

[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:18.830]
He's over here in the background

[02:30:18.830 --> 02:30:22.330]
Strike a mouse, get to you

[02:30:22.330 --> 02:30:26.510]
He even has dumbos in his head

[02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:30.750]
Let's see you, see this moth shut with some room

[02:30:30.750 --> 02:30:32.150]
You can keep it quiet

[02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:43.730]
Maybe I kicked us out of you

[02:31:00.150 --> 02:31:02.190]
I'd like to give you a big booty

[02:31:02.190 --> 02:31:03.050]
I'd like to give you a big booty

[02:31:03.050 --> 02:31:04.650]
I'd like to give you a big booty

[02:31:06.350 --> 02:31:08.870]
That's what you got to let me know

[02:31:10.750 --> 02:31:12.990]
Should you think or should it fool

[02:31:14.730 --> 02:31:18.850]
If I check from time to time

[02:31:18.850 --> 02:31:21.930]
I need to know what's so good time

[02:31:23.330 --> 02:31:26.470]
So you thought to let me know

[02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:30.150]
Should it think or should it do

[02:31:31.930 --> 02:31:34.410]
They always sing, sing, sing

[02:31:36.430 --> 02:31:38.690]
And remember what to tell

[02:31:40.430 --> 02:31:42.970]
One day it's frowning next it's like

[02:31:44.690 --> 02:31:48.990]
There is your want me or your back

[02:31:48.990 --> 02:31:52.090]
Well, you got to let me know

[02:31:53.550 --> 02:31:55.730]
Should it think or should it do

[02:31:57.850 --> 02:32:00.750]
Should it think or should it flow down

[02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:05.190]
Should it think or should it flow down

[02:32:06.450 --> 02:32:09.010]
If it thinks or that it's rabble

[02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:13.310]
Or if it thinks like a bubble

[02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:17.390]
So come on in that needle

[02:32:21.070 --> 02:32:23.990]
They sing decisions golden-leaf

[02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:26.110]
But see your back of this whole mind

[02:32:26.110 --> 02:32:27.270]
So I'd try to keep it true

[02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:28.330]
To set me free

[02:32:28.330 --> 02:32:30.470]
I just do salvage the story

[02:32:30.470 --> 02:32:32.590]
Exactly which way should it be

[02:32:32.590 --> 02:32:34.670]
Tell me it's not fair

[02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:37.110]
Do this kind of thing, let's set me free

[02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:39.090]
You can't say you can't say so

[02:32:39.090 --> 02:32:41.130]
You just got to let me know

[02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:43.190]
The lady for where I should know

[02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:45.290]
Should it think or should it do

[02:32:47.390 --> 02:32:50.390]
Should it think or should it flow down

[02:32:55.810 --> 02:32:58.250]
If it thinks or that it's rabble

[02:32:58.250 --> 02:33:00.310]
And if it thinks or that it's rabble

[02:33:00.310 --> 02:33:02.290]
So let it think like a bubble

[02:33:02.290 --> 02:33:04.650]
And if it thinks or that it's rabble

[02:33:04.650 --> 02:33:04.650]

[02:33:04.650 --> 02:33:06.370]
So come on in that needle

[02:33:06.370 --> 02:33:08.930]
The lady for where I should know

[02:33:08.930 --> 02:33:11.010]
Should it think or should it flow

[02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:12.930]
Should it think or should it flow

[02:33:12.930 --> 02:33:15.230]
Don't you want to see me suffer

[02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:19.390]
Now I can't enjoy myself

[02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:24.410]
Can I tell if I get sicker

[02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:28.470]
If it's for or if it's bigger

[02:33:30.490 --> 02:33:32.890]
You just got to let me know

[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:37.950]
Should it think or should it flow

[02:33:40.570 --> 02:33:42.230]
Well baby tonight

[02:33:43.170 --> 02:33:46.150]
We could do something out of it

[02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:48.370]
And you can rest your body

[02:33:48.370 --> 02:33:50.210]
Rabble on my baby blues

[02:33:50.210 --> 02:33:52.670]
It'll be a delight

[02:33:53.350 --> 02:33:56.010]
And I don't care how much you weigh

[02:33:56.010 --> 02:33:58.530]
You can relax and stay all day

[02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.230]
Cause I'm enjoying the view

[02:34:01.610 --> 02:34:02.870]
Just like a baby tonight

[02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:06.690]
Good diver under the ocean

[02:34:06.690 --> 02:34:10.370]
So please find it hard to get some air

[02:34:10.370 --> 02:34:14.330]
Oh but sit back and enjoy

[02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:16.690]
The blue emotion

[02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:19.230]
Just imagine to yourself

[02:34:19.230 --> 02:34:21.510]
That my gyms are rocket cha

[02:34:21.510 --> 02:34:23.370]
Just sit on my face

[02:34:23.370 --> 02:34:26.130]
Just sit on my face

[02:34:26.130 --> 02:34:28.170]
Just sit on my face

[02:34:28.170 --> 02:34:29.150]
To face to face

[02:34:29.150 --> 02:34:30.670]
Just sit on my face

[02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:31.610]
To face to face

[02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:33.170]
Rappier legs are real tight

[02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:36.610]
Like you're riding in the rodeo

[02:34:36.610 --> 02:34:39.130]
So I can't hear the radio

[02:34:39.130 --> 02:34:40.810]
And I'll show my gratitude

[02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:43.410]
We can do it all night

[02:34:44.190 --> 02:34:47.010]
Then maybe you could turn around

[02:34:47.010 --> 02:34:49.630]
And you could work your way on down

[02:34:49.630 --> 02:34:51.250]
And I shift my fly away

[02:34:51.250 --> 02:34:53.010]
Down and do whatever you choose

[02:34:53.010 --> 02:34:56.670]
Just like a diver under the ocean

[02:34:56.950 --> 02:35:01.230]
So please find it hard to get some air

[02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:05.010]
Oh but sit back and enjoy

[02:35:05.010 --> 02:35:07.430]
The blue emotion

[02:35:07.430 --> 02:35:10.130]
Just imagine to yourself

[02:35:10.130 --> 02:35:12.270]
That my gyms are rocket cha

[02:35:12.270 --> 02:35:14.130]
Just sit on my face

[02:35:14.950 --> 02:35:16.830]
Just sit on my face

[02:35:16.830 --> 02:35:18.870]
Just sit on my face

[02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:19.950]
To face to face

[02:35:19.950 --> 02:35:21.410]
Just sit on my face

[02:35:21.410 --> 02:35:22.410]
To face

[02:35:24.850 --> 02:35:26.530]
Where's the ball over here

[02:35:26.530 --> 02:35:27.650]
And don't be shy

[02:35:28.410 --> 02:35:30.690]
Got some support and hit some little surprise

[02:35:30.690 --> 02:35:33.710]
You may not know if I have to go

[02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:35.490]
But I'm gonna stick one ride

[02:35:35.490 --> 02:35:36.390]
Until you're known

[02:35:36.390 --> 02:35:37.310]
Because they you

[02:35:38.750 --> 02:35:39.870]
Smell fine

[02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:42.130]
I think

[02:35:45.310 --> 02:35:47.230]
Where's the stuff they smell like

[02:35:47.230 --> 02:35:48.190]
The gettin' y'all

[02:35:48.190 --> 02:35:51.230]
Or the cheese that goes out my toes

[02:35:51.230 --> 02:35:52.670]
And it's between my legs

[02:35:53.230 --> 02:35:53.970]
Where they could go

[02:35:53.970 --> 02:35:56.010]
And I'll stick them out there

[02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:56.830]
Until you're known

[02:35:56.830 --> 02:35:57.710]
And have you

[02:35:59.030 --> 02:36:00.230]
Smell fine

[02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:02.710]
Thank you guys

[02:36:04.950 --> 02:36:06.150]
So baby

[02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:08.550]
You're all giving a wham

[02:36:10.050 --> 02:36:11.530]
I'm the one that can try

[02:36:11.530 --> 02:36:14.570]
I got my finger there cause

[02:36:14.570 --> 02:36:16.030]
You don't know

[02:36:16.030 --> 02:36:17.470]
But it could fail

[02:36:17.470 --> 02:36:19.030]
But it's failed

[02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:20.770]
So came to me

[02:36:22.470 --> 02:36:23.110]
Yeah

[02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:25.230]
I'll take a funny egg

[02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:26.210]
You know why

[02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:29.250]
Because I was just a disgusting guy

[02:36:29.250 --> 02:36:30.610]
You scrub the arm

[02:36:30.610 --> 02:36:32.030]
Hitin' on the back row

[02:36:32.030 --> 02:36:34.830]
Hey, if my business were, they may go

[02:36:35.470 --> 02:36:35.850]
You

[02:36:36.470 --> 02:36:37.990]
Must smell the bad

[02:36:39.930 --> 02:36:42.470]
Oh, thank God

[02:37:02.070 --> 02:37:03.670]
I'll move where he is

[02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:04.830]
As far as he is

[02:37:04.830 --> 02:37:06.710]
And some drive's to maintenance

[02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:09.390]
I'll slaughter it over learnings

[02:37:09.390 --> 02:37:11.610]
And large eyes potatoes

[02:37:11.610 --> 02:37:14.050]
When it comes to kissing produce

[02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:16.530]
I'm rarely ever fickled

[02:37:16.530 --> 02:37:17.450]
But there's a lot of things

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:17.450 --> 02:37:17.450]

[02:37:19.170 --> 02:37:21.610]
I will not switch the bagels

[02:37:21.610 --> 02:37:25.150]
No, we won't, no, we won't, I'll never

[02:37:25.890 --> 02:37:28.350]
Never, we won't, I'll never

[02:37:28.350 --> 02:37:29.730]
Never, we won't, I'll never

[02:37:29.730 --> 02:37:30.550]
Never, we won't, I'll never

[02:37:30.550 --> 02:37:31.170]
Never, we'll never

[02:37:31.170 --> 02:37:32.230]
Never, we'll never

[02:37:32.230 --> 02:37:34.210]
Tickle, teeth, and squeeze the bees

[02:37:34.210 --> 02:37:36.270]
Don't somewhere like water in the woods

[02:37:36.270 --> 02:37:38.130]
Don't gladly march on

[02:37:38.130 --> 02:37:39.970]
Can't decurch in all else

[02:37:39.970 --> 02:37:41.030]
That you're selling

[02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:42.870]
I'll certainly enable

[02:37:43.450 --> 02:37:45.450]
Canelo, they'll laugh at

[02:37:45.450 --> 02:37:47.150]
The shrivels, but I'll never

[02:37:47.150 --> 02:37:49.590]
Ever know I'll never, ever

[02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:50.990]
Spook that bagels

[02:37:50.990 --> 02:37:53.870]
No, we won't, no, we won't

[02:37:53.870 --> 02:37:54.710]
I'll never

[02:37:55.450 --> 02:37:58.150]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:37:58.150 --> 02:37:59.190]
Never, we'll never

[02:37:59.190 --> 02:38:00.890]
Spook the bagels

[02:38:00.890 --> 02:38:03.670]
Up finger quinks and lick the bruts

[02:38:03.670 --> 02:38:05.370]
The sweaty heads of lettuce

[02:38:05.370 --> 02:38:07.510]
I've done about everything

[02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:10.450]
With fruits and half of veggie veggies

[02:38:10.450 --> 02:38:12.470]
I've swallowed nannas

[02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:15.350]
Those so big, so big, they shared in tickle

[02:38:15.350 --> 02:38:18.290]
And even though I walk these things

[02:38:18.290 --> 02:38:20.490]
I will not smooch the peggle

[02:38:20.490 --> 02:38:24.130]
No, we won't, no, we won't, I'll never

[02:38:24.790 --> 02:38:26.470]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:38:27.530 --> 02:38:28.750]
Never, we'll never

[02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:30.090]
Spook the bagels

[02:38:30.090 --> 02:38:33.010]
No, we won't, no, we won't

[02:38:33.010 --> 02:38:35.470]
I'll never, we won't

[02:38:35.470 --> 02:38:36.850]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:38:36.850 --> 02:38:37.350]
Never, we'll never

[02:38:37.350 --> 02:38:42.290]
Never, we won't, I'll never

[02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.470]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:44.290]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:38:44.290 --> 02:38:46.790]
Never, we won't, we won't

[02:38:46.790 --> 02:38:50.290]
Never, we won't

[02:38:51.130 --> 02:38:51.810]
That was the reason

[02:38:51.810 --> 02:38:54.050]
Sakura-sense, Sakura-sense, Sakura-sense

[02:38:54.050 --> 02:38:55.090]
And ended just like that?

[02:38:55.330 --> 02:38:56.710]
That's unbelievable, that's

[02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:59.050]
I don't need ramps of white, everybody out

[02:38:59.050 --> 02:39:01.130]
Just mine, that's all

[02:39:07.150 --> 02:39:09.450]
Now I'm not like the guy, the guy

[02:39:09.450 --> 02:39:11.250]
That goes and print on other people

[02:39:11.250 --> 02:39:12.130]
Rads and stuff

[02:39:12.130 --> 02:39:12.270]
That goes and print on other people

[02:39:12.270 --> 02:39:14.790]
not business what you do is up to you.

[02:39:15.530 --> 02:39:20.010]
Why some folks care is the army I thought this country was free

[02:39:20.010 --> 02:39:22.590]
as far as what anybody else likes to do.

[02:39:23.890 --> 02:39:27.410]
I like to smoke, tilts me relax, and I'm aware of the cancer

[02:39:27.410 --> 02:39:30.870]
and the heart attacks in the meantime I'm as healthy as I can get.

[02:39:32.130 --> 02:39:35.370]
But these few laws are getting me pissed, and I'd like to

[02:39:35.370 --> 02:39:39.030]
strangle the son of a bitch that tells me not to smoke my cigarette.

[02:39:40.910 --> 02:39:43.250]
Smoke, smoke, smoke, that cigarette.

[02:39:45.090 --> 02:39:48.530]
Smoke, smoke, I don't care if I smoke myself again.

[02:39:49.110 --> 02:39:52.910]
I don't give a crap what you say, now get the hell out of my way.

[02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:55.910]
No, stop gonna have another cigarette.

[02:39:57.230 --> 02:39:59.470]
Now you can't smoke in most restaurants,

[02:40:00.050 --> 02:40:01.510]
ports or evens or even bars.

[02:40:01.710 --> 02:40:04.250]
It's the most fascist agenda I've seen yet.

[02:40:05.610 --> 02:40:09.670]
I don't need any judgment passed on me by some thinkamone

[02:40:09.670 --> 02:40:12.530]
is asked just because I'm smoking as a cigarette.

[02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:16.670]
Smoke, smoke, smoke, that cigarette.

[02:40:18.470 --> 02:40:21.890]
Smoke, smoke, I don't care if I smoke myself again.

[02:40:22.470 --> 02:40:26.390]
I just wanna have a little pun to get your hands out of my lungs.

[02:40:26.690 --> 02:40:29.230]
I'm gonna have another cigarette.

[02:40:30.790 --> 02:40:36.010]
The ones who scream the most, it seems about how dangerous cigarette can be or smoking me.

[02:40:36.190 --> 02:40:37.790]
I guess it's okay for them.

[02:40:39.110 --> 02:40:41.430]
So if you want any more, I smoke a law of mass.

[02:40:41.610 --> 02:40:43.830]
Let me vent right over and you can kiss my ass.

[02:40:44.010 --> 02:40:46.130]
Now I'm gonna have another cigarette.

[02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:50.050]
Smoke, smoke, smoke, that cigarette.

[02:40:51.970 --> 02:40:55.330]
Smoke, smoke, I don't care if I smoke myself again.

[02:40:55.330 --> 02:40:59.870]
I'll get the hell out of my way or else I'll blow up in your face.

[02:41:00.130 --> 02:41:02.830]
I'll have another cigarette.

[02:41:04.450 --> 02:41:07.710]
Boulee's out of there, Boulee's out of there.

[02:41:08.230 --> 02:41:12.270]
No spirit, you're smokin', your outpoo be foge.

[02:41:12.930 --> 02:41:15.570]
Shard and may and cocaine in the spa.

[02:41:17.850 --> 02:41:21.890]
Siggurette's and coffee friends, little boys on Christmas men.

[02:41:21.890 --> 02:41:23.990]
Tonight you'll tangle in the street.

[02:41:24.610 --> 02:41:30.330]
You, darkly, misty rich smokeer, your chicken choker.

[02:41:31.130 --> 02:41:33.730]
Tonight you'll go and let it all hang out.

[02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:39.750]
Daddy holes and I'll be there, smoke and menthol cigarettes.

[02:41:40.330 --> 02:41:42.110]
Tonight you'll tangle in the street.

[02:41:42.850 --> 02:41:51.230]
You, darkly, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee.

[02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:56.230]
You're an owner of Yoko, go neck and black coffee with the boys.

[02:41:57.950 --> 02:42:02.230]
Dancing in your buster brides, wounds to that tech beside.

[02:42:02.670 --> 02:42:07.490]
You hands are wet, your hair's slink, you smoke, big f***er.

[02:42:07.490 --> 02:42:11.230]
Misty rich smokeer, your belt big coker.

[02:42:12.090 --> 02:42:14.470]
Groose and Jeff will pick you up at town.

[02:42:16.210 --> 02:42:20.870]
Go in and dance and sing, Friday night, God will pick.

[02:42:21.090 --> 02:42:22.950]
Tonight you'll tangle in the street.

[02:42:23.590 --> 02:42:27.490]
You, darkly, misty rich smokeer, your belt big coker.

[02:42:28.090 --> 02:42:29.870]
You, darkly, misty rich smokeer, your belt big coker.

[02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:37.990]
You, darkly, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee, boulee.

[02:42:38.010 --> 02:42:38.610]
That's what's mine!

[02:42:39.970 --> 02:42:42.530]
We use this road we can reach you and you can really tell it to us.

[02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:43.990]
We're gonna fight, fight, fight, fight.

[02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:46.610]
We use this thing in a song, we're gonna smoke it in a ball.

[02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:48.210]
We're gonna fight, fight, fight, fight.

[02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:50.790]
Well, in the laces, they say it's a last name of the name.

[02:42:51.030 --> 02:42:52.410]
We're gonna fight, fight, fight, fight.

[02:42:52.510 --> 02:42:54.490]
Let's go, let's go, let's go survive.

[02:42:57.570 --> 02:42:58.750]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:42:59.670 --> 02:43:00.890]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:02.030 --> 02:43:05.110]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:07.970]
When they were eating for kale and the new bohemus,

[02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:09.490]
they were fighting, fighting, fighting.

[02:43:09.930 --> 02:43:12.210]
When they were black, crows and giant made cries,

[02:43:12.390 --> 02:43:13.770]
they were fighting, fighting, fighting.

[02:43:14.430 --> 02:43:15.870]
This is being our example,

[02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:18.010]
we shall be fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting.

[02:43:18.150 --> 02:43:19.930]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:20.970 --> 02:43:22.270]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:23.110 --> 02:43:24.470]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:25.290 --> 02:43:26.690]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:27.550 --> 02:43:29.150]
Come on, come on, come on.

[02:43:29.650 --> 02:43:30.930]
Let's go, let's go survive.

[02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.530]
Let's go!

[02:43:43.350 --> 02:43:47.230]
Everybody, so many!

[02:43:49.550 --> 02:43:51.930]
Everybody, so many!

[02:43:51.930 --> 02:43:53.450]
Everybody, so many.

[02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:57.350]
Okay, everybody...

[02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:08.290]
Well, this supposed to be some work to do, but I forgot, because I spoke to Mordify.

[02:44:09.090 --> 02:44:12.170]
I wouldn't have allowed a blues in everybody, out there was Mordify.

[02:44:12.690 --> 02:44:15.990]
I saw flying melodies in the red lights in the river,

[02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:17.770]
The roads in the white pretty big,

[02:44:18.110 --> 02:44:19.270]
Thanks God's love to mine!

[02:44:20.270 --> 02:44:21.350]
Let's go, stand supplied!

[02:44:22.250 --> 02:44:23.630]
Let's go, stand supplied!

[02:44:24.370 --> 02:44:25.750]
Let's go, stand supplied!

[02:44:26.610 --> 02:44:28.650]
Ah, ah, ah, ah,

[02:44:28.650 --> 02:44:30.710]
Let's go, stand supplied, let's get it!

[02:44:39.770 --> 02:44:42.870]

[02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:46.790]

Here's another really good reason why I'd be calling Laminat Saras.

[02:44:59.890 --> 02:45:00.970]
Their prices will floore.

[02:45:10.670 --> 02:45:12.230]

[02:45:37.450 --> 02:45:41.650]
My life and locals, this is 4205 City.

[02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:43.150]
You weigh him.

[02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:52.750]
There once was a man named Bill who lived on Capitol Hill.

[02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:57.130]
He gave me a dress, then made it a mess.

[02:45:58.130 --> 02:46:02.030]
And I kept it under my bed in my house.

[02:46:02.470 --> 02:46:05.150]
Nah, that's not good.

[02:46:05.890 --> 02:46:08.530]
Okay, let's say, alright.

[02:46:09.690 --> 02:46:11.190]
Roses are red.

[02:46:11.970 --> 02:46:14.190]
The white house is white.

[02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:17.610]
I signed in the log book one night.

[02:46:18.530 --> 02:46:21.690]
No, that's not good either.

[02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:26.830]
Hickory, dickory, dark.

[02:46:27.750 --> 02:46:29.790]
The president showed me his.

[02:46:30.490 --> 02:46:34.470]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, good.

[02:46:35.650 --> 02:46:36.790]
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

[02:46:37.570 --> 02:46:45.610]
Twice the night before Christmas and all through the house, Bill got naked except for my

[02:46:45.610 --> 02:46:46.170]
clothes.

[02:46:46.850 --> 02:46:54.210]
My parents were now sold both snug and they're bad, while I was giving the president a

[02:46:54.210 --> 02:46:58.250]
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, good either.

[02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:10.990]
I'm singing this song and I'm feeling kinda sad.

[02:47:10.990 --> 02:47:14.930]
I got my smile from home, but my chicken from my bed.

[02:47:15.770 --> 02:47:19.190]
I've got a body like a driving-range man.

[02:47:19.650 --> 02:47:22.990]
When it's cold outside, use my nips to hang your hat.

[02:47:24.930 --> 02:47:28.850]
I can blow in your ear, give you a laugh dance.

[02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:32.790]
But you won't notice me, so I get some implants.

[02:47:33.650 --> 02:47:38.970]
I need a guy who ain't got issues like filling up a chest

[02:47:38.970 --> 02:47:41.170]
and finding tissues.

[02:47:43.450 --> 02:47:47.090]
Guys say I'm cute, this am pretty.

[02:47:47.910 --> 02:47:51.250]
I'm not alone, we need your beauty.

[02:47:51.690 --> 02:47:56.850]
I've got a nice ass and girl like a kissy, but I can't get a man.

[02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:59.830]
Cause I got no titties.

[02:47:59.950 --> 02:48:01.650]
I've got no titties.

[02:48:01.710 --> 02:48:05.130]
Because Wonder Grunt is something I can't afford.

[02:48:05.130 --> 02:48:09.350]
When you lay on me, you'll swear you're on a diving board.

[02:48:09.690 --> 02:48:12.950]
When I turn 11, I started to get cute.

[02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:17.410]
Now I'm 24 and so waiting on my boots.

[02:48:19.390 --> 02:48:22.850]
I gotta say I'm cute, this am pretty.

[02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:27.190]
I'm not alone, we need your beauty.

[02:48:27.690 --> 02:48:32.870]
I've got a nice ass and girl like a kissy, but I can't get a man.

[02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:36.870]
Cause I've got no titties.

[02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:39.930]
I've got no titties.

[02:48:41.690 --> 02:48:43.930]
I've got no titties.

[02:48:47.630 --> 02:48:49.150]
No titties.

[02:49:08.810 --> 02:49:15.410]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:15.410 --> 02:49:16.650]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:16.650 --> 02:49:16.650]

[02:49:16.650 --> 02:49:16.650]

[02:49:16.650 --> 02:49:17.130]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:17.130 --> 02:49:20.690]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:21.370 --> 02:49:25.350]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:30.310 --> 02:49:40.570]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:40.570 --> 02:49:41.390]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:41.710]

[02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:42.070]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:43.750 --> 02:49:45.350]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:48.450]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:50.850 --> 02:49:54.590]
I've got no titties.

[02:49:54.590 --> 02:49:57.250]
There's only fascist on the air

[02:49:58.110 --> 02:50:02.890]
Since one giant corporation has emerged

[02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:07.610]
That wants you to stay feeling

[02:50:08.670 --> 02:50:10.990]
Their balance and their fear

[02:50:11.790 --> 02:50:14.550]
Better different ways of view

[02:50:14.550 --> 02:50:16.330]
Won't be heard

[02:50:18.590 --> 02:50:21.850]
It's another branch of the White House

[02:50:21.850 --> 02:50:24.290]
Call the Ministry a Cruz

[02:50:24.290 --> 02:50:27.710]
Where the little booms econ yarn

[02:50:28.730 --> 02:50:29.830]
Curve the way

[02:50:31.230 --> 02:50:34.750]
And the dawn'll wait

[02:50:35.610 --> 02:50:37.450]
A musical grain

[02:50:37.450 --> 02:50:37.930]
Bone

[02:50:37.930 --> 02:50:38.610]
Bone

[02:50:46.010 --> 02:50:48.490]
Can't get the kids to eat their lima beans

[02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:50.150]
Their green beans

[02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:51.590]
The pork and beans?

[02:50:52.050 --> 02:50:54.190]
Then try new lesbians.

[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:55.550]
Yes, lesbians!

[02:50:56.130 --> 02:51:00.010]
Why don't disappear from the place so fast you'll swear they're eating themselves.

[02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:01.550]
New lesbians!

[02:51:02.810 --> 02:51:04.590]
For David's a bitch.

[02:51:08.530 --> 02:51:12.570]
This time when all I want to have are

[02:51:12.570 --> 02:51:14.990]
For reals to eat

[02:51:14.990 --> 02:51:18.970]
This time when every sentence spoken

[02:51:18.970 --> 02:51:22.150]
Seems incompleases

[02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:25.930]
And everything that I need

[02:51:25.930 --> 02:51:29.310]
Just makes me laugh, I'm

[02:51:29.310 --> 02:51:32.710]
Could it be the stuff I'm smoking?

[02:51:33.690 --> 02:51:35.410]
Yes, it's the grass

[02:51:35.970 --> 02:51:41.210]
Why is really last week

[02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:43.330]
I'm on the way to talk

[02:51:43.970 --> 02:51:46.470]
Just now we

[02:51:46.470 --> 02:51:50.250]
While we were on the way to talk

[02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:55.310]
On the way to talk

[02:51:55.310 --> 02:52:05.830]
On the way to talk

[02:52:06.470 --> 02:52:07.990]
I've got 32 and 560 W.

[02:52:08.130 --> 02:52:09.930]
Here's a fast from Ray Perry who asked

[02:52:09.930 --> 02:52:11.590]
Did you send this to me or did he do it?

[02:52:11.810 --> 02:52:14.270]
He came in here and handed it to me and I packed it along to you

[02:52:14.270 --> 02:52:17.350]
And I told him but nevertheless we want to hear it from your mouth

[02:52:17.350 --> 02:52:18.770]
I'll see it from your mouth.

[02:52:18.910 --> 02:52:19.850]
Do you want serious from my push?

[02:52:20.090 --> 02:52:20.290]
Yes.

[02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:23.650]
Ray Perry asked, do you want the football tickets to go to Carlos?

[02:52:24.010 --> 02:52:26.790]
Well, see, until I realized that he was gay

[02:52:27.930 --> 02:52:29.610]
Now what difference should that make?

[02:52:31.410 --> 02:52:32.590]
Did I say it made a difference?

[02:52:32.770 --> 02:52:34.710]
Oh, okay, y'all don't enjoy the game all the more I think.

[02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:37.110]
He ought to enjoy a bunch of guys out there in tight pants

[02:52:37.110 --> 02:52:39.870]
Grabbing each other around a waist and in the caronacratch

[02:52:40.410 --> 02:52:41.570]
Rolling around in the mud

[02:52:42.270 --> 02:52:45.230]
I would really enjoy when a Patriots come to town and go see Tom Brady

[02:52:45.230 --> 02:52:47.030]
See what a real man looks like

[02:52:47.530 --> 02:52:51.670]
I'm sure I want to give the tickets to Carlos under one condition

[02:52:51.670 --> 02:52:52.470]
Okay

[02:52:52.470 --> 02:52:55.590]
And that is this, under absolutely no circumstances

[02:52:55.590 --> 02:52:58.370]
Are you allowed to give the bills or any other tickets to Fatboy?

[02:53:00.570 --> 02:53:01.290]
You got it?

[02:53:01.530 --> 02:53:02.670]
He's already come in here begging

[02:53:03.310 --> 02:53:04.690]
Did you what I just said?

[02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:05.770]
I heard you

[02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:07.830]
Are you going to be giving those tickets to Fatboy?

[02:53:08.070 --> 02:53:08.230]
Nope

[02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:11.150]
No, no, say them fatically like you really mean it

[02:53:11.150 --> 02:53:12.470]
A lot like some kind of a...

[02:53:12.470 --> 02:53:12.850]
How long?

[02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:14.330]
He's not losing my tickets because of him?

[02:53:14.670 --> 02:53:14.990]
Okay

[02:53:16.130 --> 02:53:17.150]
And that's it

[02:53:17.970 --> 02:53:18.950]
You got the tickets?

[02:53:19.350 --> 02:53:23.150]
I mean, what you do with the red, but don't give any tickets to Fatboy under any circumstances

[02:53:23.150 --> 02:53:28.930]
So he's annoying, he's obnoxious, he's pathetic, he's grotesque, he's overbearing, he will not go away

[02:53:28.930 --> 02:53:30.390]
The answer is...

[02:53:30.390 --> 02:53:30.570]
No!

[02:53:31.070 --> 02:53:31.950]
Hiya, howdy!

[02:53:32.290 --> 02:53:34.230]
The answer is by a pally, bye-bye

[02:53:35.550 --> 02:53:38.510]
Fiveth on of this story, I guess I better take another one or two of these calls

[02:53:38.510 --> 02:53:41.430]
But I want to give him this story that I hadn't heard anything about this story

[02:53:41.430 --> 02:53:42.370]
Because I was...

[02:53:42.370 --> 02:53:45.570]
See, yesterday here I hate to break the news to you, but all those coverage

[02:53:45.570 --> 02:53:48.830]
That's all they ever was talking about was the name Stone's thing last year

[02:53:48.830 --> 02:53:49.210]
I was going to visit

[02:53:50.130 --> 02:53:54.230]
Well, there was a whole lot of media at the event including local, national and international...

[02:53:54.230 --> 02:53:54.650]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:53:55.790 --> 02:53:56.870]
Because it was a great event

[02:53:57.850 --> 02:54:01.870]
But the story about the hoax in the case of the long-wasting Indiana girl in the...

[02:54:01.870 --> 02:54:03.370]
Yeah, oh, how embarrassing

[02:54:03.370 --> 02:54:07.390]
And then of course CNN gets in wood which stands for certainly not news

[02:54:07.390 --> 02:54:10.770]
You people at CNN, they tried to save their ass here last night

[02:54:10.770 --> 02:54:13.850]
They actually sent somebody here which we appreciate that everybody in Toronto

[02:54:13.850 --> 02:54:17.110]
The fact they give us worldwide coverage, and what a great event it was and how well it was staged

[02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:18.870]
And how wonderful the city is, et cetera, and so on

[02:54:18.870 --> 02:54:23.810]
But this on the heels, they even admitted that since they were at the forefront of hyping all of that

[02:54:23.810 --> 02:54:28.890]
SARS crap, including a lot of cases were supposedly it was exported which we know was not

[02:54:28.890 --> 02:54:30.770]
Remember those bogus cases in Texas?

[02:54:31.130 --> 02:54:35.030]
Every time somebody sneezed in Texas, oh they got SARS, they were at their airport in Toronto for 10 minutes

[02:54:35.710 --> 02:54:36.550]
Crap, you know?

[02:54:37.210 --> 02:54:38.850]
And so they tried to redeem themselves

[02:54:38.850 --> 02:54:42.350]
But to make a long story short, I didn't see this story about this so hoax which we'll get into

[02:54:42.350 --> 02:54:45.350]
And you'll explain it because you're brilliant

[02:54:46.250 --> 02:54:47.550]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello

[02:54:49.710 --> 02:54:50.550]
Fort Lauderdale

[02:54:52.610 --> 02:54:54.410]
Long gone, Miami Beach, hello

[02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:58.310]
Miami Beach, yes sir

[02:54:58.310 --> 02:54:59.310]
Who the more over here?

[02:54:59.850 --> 02:55:00.430]
And back to you

[02:55:00.430 --> 02:55:02.550]
Are you going to ask them by any chance?

[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.210]
Yes

[02:55:03.210 --> 02:55:07.150]
Yeah, because they have the bare ass parade on Sunday I think on the canal

[02:55:07.530 --> 02:55:11.530]
Yeah, this is Pride Week in Amsterdam which I had no idea that it was when I made the reservations

[02:55:11.530 --> 02:55:16.130]
Because you ordinarily avoid those things like the plague but at least there should be some people here this time

[02:55:16.130 --> 02:55:18.850]
No, there's going to be a lot of people, I was just reading in the Dutch newspaper

[02:55:18.850 --> 02:55:19.590]
Excellent

[02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:26.870]
Anyway, can you do a poll on the week, the day when you're on and when Uncle George is on?

[02:55:27.770 --> 02:55:31.430]
Because I really like to see, I'm not tuning in anymore to this guy, he's a great guy

[02:55:31.430 --> 02:55:34.930]
But he's trying to run a show with no subject and he just can't do it

[02:55:34.930 --> 02:55:39.170]
He's much better when he finally has a subject so people can call him for something
