[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.480]
The Jets are saying they got to play better defense against the Dolvin blizzard

[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.040]

One minute after that the elevator will rise to pages

[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.540]
Three of your guys can pick up the bags and carry them out

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.320]

Okay, right am I right? Yes. Don't know much about crap don't know much about herpes I think I have herpes

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.100]
No, actually I do know quite a bit about it, but that's another story for another day

[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.960]
I know a lot about the thick head herpes like calm down. Oh, okay

[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.500]
That must have been why he was out yesterday hit like a chanker or something these stayed out for a whole day

[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.700]
Well, it was God is right. He's such a pussy, you know

[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.680]
By the way speaking of Scott Scott junior in there may get paid does sometimes soon clearance was in her yesterday apologizing

[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.240]
Yeah, you're full of crap clearance. You're we're on to you

[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.280]
We're on to your baloney. Okay. He's stonewalling. He's just stalling installing and pushing it back and pushing it back

[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.400]
You know just try to like save a few bucks for a cheap ass outfit. Okay, let's get right to it

[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.280]
We don't have a lot of time today. We got a short show. We got just tons of crap

[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.460]
Man, just tons and tons and tons of crap. Here's a little piece of advice for you by the way

[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.960]
Everybody in the audience do not take Santa Cod unless you need it. You know what I'm saying? Wow

[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.680]
Well, you know my my words are healing up from that awful bacon experience that ate 75 pieces of bacon from how he was there

[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.400]
And I'm finally like it's almost gone, but I'm thinking well, you know you the stool softener is good

[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.520]
We can't talk about that. Can we stool softer? It's not lunch yet. Huh? No seriously, but it can't hurt

[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.120]
So for whatever reason I just took a Cennacott last night before I went to bed. That was a bad movement, man

[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.440]
Wow this morning. I just woo

[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.920]
Heavy duty experience don't take Cennacott unless you really needed my should be taken Cennacott

[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.660]
Believe me. I'll keep you busy. My you'll be crapping your brains out all day long

[00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.500]
Anyway, the poor result from yesterday

[00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.360]
I don't know they just

[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.080]
The hundred and three votes. It's not too bad, but this was they're just not concerned, you know?

[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.020]
No, I'm not they're very very calm tomorrow. By the way, it's trests draft for his birthday on 9-11

[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.100]
Happy birthday Troy. We're not playing the thing till tomorrow, right?

[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.080]
What's your take on this Thursday's two-year anniversary of 9-11? It's tomorrow

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.780]
It's tomorrow stay calm stay cool. We don't want to get anybody into a panic. Don't start losing your grip on reality

[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.680]
George has suggested no

[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:34.200]
Be afraid be very afraid nothing will happen 698 58% of this audience is fully confident that nothing is gonna happen tomorrow

[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.480]
Well, you know what you're all wrong because something's gonna happen. Yeah, so it'll come up right tomorrow

[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.860]
Maybe and maybe not

[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.620]
Maybe your son will come up tomorrow or go down

[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.840]
Nothing will happen 698. What me worry 289? I'm buying duct tape and vis Queen

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.540]
It was a late vision on their 92 say they're buying their duct tape and vis Queen

[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.460]
Badchman will happen 54. I'm staying close to home all day 36 and I won't travel tomorrow 34 out of

[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.180]
1203 votes on yesterday's pull we got two polls today. How do you like that two for the price of none?

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.320]
Here's the first one for this hour only

[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.280]
We got a short show now. You know that's a crank call Scott. Don't you mind me beach? You know that line six is a crank mind me beach

[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.780]
That was great

[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.660]
Edward Teller's dead is right 25 what a Nazi bastard he was

[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:35.540]
I wonder if he was related to Nistva on guiding light top of our but at any rate

[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.660]
Edward Teller's that you know you got the Tom Lerthing back though the Edward Teller song on there, right? We do you know

[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:48.080]
Yeah, we got the Tom Ler album back there. He's probably all of them. I don't know so never heard from Edward Teller the hell he didn't

[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.180]
Or no, it was very fun brown well same difference. Doc

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.460]
Anyway, here's the first pull for today before we get to the heavy duty stuff all before we do it though

[00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.040]
This story about the lottery ticket this

[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:07.040]
In today's Harold and I just looked at this and I talked to myself. There's only one remedy for doing that

[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.240]
Throwing your brains out

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.820]
Who had the 50 million dollar ticket float as biggest lotto loser? It says when the clock tick passed 12 a.m

[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.320]
Tuesday yesterday time ran out on somebody's dream

[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:26.860]
A 50 million dollar winning lottery ticket bought in North Bay village on March 12th expired the largest jackpot in Florida lottery history to go unclamed

[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:34.680]
It was the 20th winning Florida ticket to be lost and more likely forgotten about the previous record was $60 million pot left behind in 1991

[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.540]
I think I just feel the heavy pot

[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.140]
Lottery winners have 180 days to claim their prizes the money now goes into the Florida education enhancement trust fund

[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.100]
What does that mean that the kids go to school for like two days a year now

[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:50.560]
Some of it will be reinvested in a new games for the lottery spokeswoman Sheila Griffin said

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.400]
Keep in mind the lottery is the biggest ripoff the biggest legalized ripoff in history mankind. Am I right?

[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.160]
Absolutely

[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.980]
One person is spying about the ticket Mohammed iZim Hosein owner of coal's food market in North Bay

[00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:06.580]
But let's still got his cut as the vendor who sold the winning numbers the lottery paid him 10 grand

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:11.380]
I gave some to a friend who works with me and sent some to my wife and bagel et al esh was on the only problem

[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.460]
He might not be so happy if he checks with her and finds out she had a 50 minute ticket too late bitch

[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:15.860]
I mean

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.920]
It says if the ticket holder finally shows up

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:25.520]
Then we'd have a five box of Kleenex party because he or she would be crying. Yeah Griffin said

[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:27.660]
How do you like that?

[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.460]
Who the hell is Griffin? Oh Sheila Griffin from the Florida lottery crying

[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:37.280]
If you seriously stop and think about that you'll look in the drawer. Oh, look at that. There was my lottery ticket

[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.500]
Oh

[00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.760]
There it is. I've been looking for that damn thing and of course you don't write down the numbers

[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:46.200]
You just and you look at it and there's like 22 23 35

[00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.280]
45 50 and 53 and then you reach in the other drawer

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.380]
A lot to be involved in really your freaking brains out you'd have to you just have to kill yourself wouldn't you?

[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.440]
Absolutely rubber room at least now. What do you mean another winner sky?

[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:03.480]
You see here we come in like Georgia becoming very cynical about our great-cowars. Here's Palm Beach. Hello

[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.400]
Get a lie buddy get a lie

[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:13.660]
I win huh I win I picked it. What do you mean you win? He was good. I liked him. He was enjoyable

[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:19.220]
Uh, he was almost he sounded a little like the dice man on a bad day with like a sore throat

[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:23.440]
Here's the first poll for today which of these best describes why listen to the Nioh Roger show

[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:28.200]
Which of these best describes why you listen to the Nioh Roger show for humor

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.860]
For liberal talking a few laughs. There's nothing else on I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off

[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.680]
Neil is the radio god

[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:43.360]
No, good. I'm a QAM listener or I love the crank callers which were two for two so much the first guy was good though

[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:48.480]
Yeah, that was the retire and that was the uh guy with the 85 horses. I'm starting to enjoy him actually

[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.580]
You know what when he's got something good like that? He was good today

[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.800]
So it goes to show you if you just keep plugging away sooner lady might have something like mo

[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.160]
You know

[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.260]
Someday he might say something good on here. Absolutely. Haven't had nothing good so far

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:04.100]
It's only been like a year and a half. Can you say that? He's got such great hits in it in addition to way

[00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.460]
He does have a lot of hits mostly once you don't want like to think at her piece like that one

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.800]
He was out sick with like a chirpy and like little extra crotch rot yesterday

[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.080]
Come on mo booch up a little bit if you're gonna work on his station

[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.940]
You got to show up or be they like the rest of us by the way mad dogs off today

[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:22.500]
You know i'm saying oh right because we work whenever we feel like it because we got a marlin game pregame at 12.35

[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.300]
The red hot marlin's why believe are they 15 games over now scott 15 16

[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.840]
16 81 65

[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.800]
Oh my god

[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.540]
They are sure they are assured of not having a losing season

[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:39.220]
I don't want to doubt your word, but I want to look in the paper here

[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.660]
I'm not you know, I'm sure you're right

[00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:48.080]
But 16 games over would be astonishing and still nobody shows up when I have the home games because there's nobody there and nobody cares

[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:52.840]
Anyway, they got the meds again this afternoon and we'll have that game for you like at 110 to start and game

[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.680]
12.35 the pregame so we get out of here early to which we say

[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.660]
Uh 80 and 65 it says here 80 and 65 my mistake

[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:04.840]
But you are yeah, I gotta say one thing for scott here so consistent

[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.040]
No, it would like to think with Mussolini and Romeo yesterday no matter what he says you know, it's wrong

[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.580]
That's why I picked up the paper as soon as you said it because I already saw it

[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.960]
They're 15 games over they have 17 games

[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.980]
165 17 left

[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:22.820]
So somebody who said earlier in the season marlins are gonna win 91 games and we all laugh and say what an idiot

[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.460]
What I'm more on that person may have been right they may have been absolutely correct sir shocking

[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.640]
So there you go. Let's uh

[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.580]
Got the first pull up there. We got another pull in the 11 o'clock hour for the rest of the show and I got eight million

[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:39.640]
The things here how we got to rush plus we got these tremendous calls like the one from Miami. Hello

[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:40.700]
I'm listening

[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.400]
So weak so weak

[00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.060]

Is spokesman for the Lawrence Livermore laboratory. He was 95. That's plenty old enough 95 Jesus

[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.740]
Wouldn't all of us like to make it to 95. I'll take that

[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:43.480]
You know the only people who aren't crazy about only making it to 95 it was her like 94 and a half

[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:51.300]
Right, I suppose even my mom who's a little over 90 she'd like to make it to 95. She's still pretty strong mom

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:53.300]
I just don't I don't think it's in the cards

[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.360]
Well, you know when you when you wind up being a bag lady at the age of 90

[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.120]
You keep it that way. I don't think this is a big future. Yeah, well, you know that condo. She's got that I own

We got a lot of stuff again. We only got two and a half hours. We got the big Marlon Meds game any interest? No

[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:21.500]

Oh, there's the whining about the damn dolphin lost to a girl's team well

[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.220]
Yeah, they got a shot

[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:47.140]
Here's my any on six all calls are on six today, which is an omen. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Is this a real call?

[00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.400]
This is a real call. I can't believe it

[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:58.340]
And you know, we I tell you something the Q&A program is the Q&A programming department. I think it's gonna is upgraded at the town level

[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:06.080]
Um, regarding sports radio programming Q&A but only technically when it comes to the play by play stuff. Yeah

[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:11.980]
What is going on? I mean we've got the hurricanes and the dolphins are signature

[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.480]
um sports on the station right and they have mohauer david

[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.520]
Who is that one and embarrassment and all the how many times you're gonna tell us

[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.300]
That every player is a former giant a former charger a former patriot don't care

[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.200]
Yeah, well, well in most cases a former human being

[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:38.740]
The gaki. I mean he crushed it. He crushed it. He crushed it. We every plane is a terrible sucks. Okay. Okay. Yeah

[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.400]
I mean just I don't know what you're point that our play by play uh people are a little bit lacking now you've left out

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.760]
I noticed jugs McDonald from the panther game and a panther signed a old-liled old line big deal and you know the panther off the jone

[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:55.820]
Like what is it? The panthers are off the map nobody cares about them. You can go to the park. You're absolutely right

[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.040]
That's right. If nobody cares about the marlins you can imagine how many people really care about the panthers

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.700]
That's stretching it

[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.700]
Have a great yes

[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.760]
He crushed it he crushed it he crushed it

[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:18.720]
But there's one thing he left out oh my oh my oh my oh my he left that out

[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.060]
From the hyperventilating hysterical Joe Zagaki

[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:27.220]
Bushlegan embarrassing good guy though, but really bush league in his performance and fits in perfectly with the um

[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.440]
Just like a glove no wonder they want him to know other broadcast

[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:34.320]
I mean why would they want to have like a bushly guy like Bill's inford doing you know guys like a real professional

[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:40.640]
They don't want that they want the screaming amateur hour Joe Zagaki, but nevertheless. That's you and like I said it fits in perfect

[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.160]
This story that I was about to do before we took that very important call

[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:48.420]
Saudi police say Barbie dolls a threat to morality

[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:55.960]
Okay, ready. I can see that Saudi Arabia's religious police have declared Barbie dolls a threat to morality

[00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:02.240]
Complaining that the revealing clothes of the Jewish toy. Which is what they call it already banned the kingdom our offensive to Islam

[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.160]
Oh, yeah, didn't you know Barbie was Jewish

[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:10.020]
You know everybody on the Jewish because if you get a kind doll he circumscuses back right then he's got that ring around his

[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:11.020]
collar

[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.160]
The committee for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice. Oh, I like that

[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.900]
What's that what's the acronym for that crap?

[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.560]
The committee for the propagation of virtue and prevention of vice as the religious police are officially known

[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:26.160]
lists the dolls on a section of its website devoted to items deemed offensive to the conservative

[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.400]
Saudi interpretation of Islam

[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.580]
Jewish Barbie dolls with a revealing clothes and shameful postures

[00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:40.020]
Accessories and tools. Oh, there's nothing worse than a shameful tool right our symbol of decadence to the perverted west

[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:44.300]
Let us be aware of her dangers and be careful so to post her on the site Barbies a threat

[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:51.980]
The poster plastered with pictures of Barbie in short dresses and tight pants all right with a few of her accessories reads a strange

[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:57.060]
Request a little girl asks her mother mother. I want jeans the low-cut shirt and a swimsuit like Barbie

[00:19:57.540 --> 00:20:02.380]
Such posters are distributed to schools at hung in streets by the religious police or moot. What is it?

[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:08.080]
Mutawa? Mutawa whatever the hell they okay goyem and dependent body affiliated with the office of the prime minister

[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.600]
Vice police officials weren't available for comment

[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:19.860]
Sheek Abdullah al-Merdas a preacher in a re-admask said the Mutawa take their anti-barbi campaign to the shops confiscating dolls from sellers and imposing a fine

[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:27.040]
How do you like that? Oh, we're fine right although illegal barbies the creation of California based motel are found on the black market

[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:31.600]
Where a contraband doll could cost a hundred reels which is 27 bucks US or more

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.680]
It's no problem that little girls play with dolls

[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:40.040]
But these dolls are not of the developed body of a woman and where we're feeding clothes al-Merdas said these revealing clothes will be

[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.900]
Imprited in their minds and they'll refuse to wear the clothing we're used to as Muslims the sheikh said as in shakia booty

[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:51.100]
Isn't that incredible? We're not talking about people in the stone age are we? No, oh thank goodness for that

[00:20:53.020 --> 00:21:00.080]
So Jewish Barbie doll oh brother. Yeah, these Shmata heads man just enough to make you want to puke your guts up

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:02.580]
We're gonna we got a couple of calls in them

They get by with two hours three hours and we got a four-hour thing we got to do for this kind of money

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.060]

Okay, you better hop on it because 11 o'clock this is gonna disappear 89 votes

[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.500]
Neil is the radio god 26 for humor 16

Rate something to change monthly 5.19 APR

[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:14.580]
I'm a local

[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.560]
This is my city

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.040]
The radio's on yours

[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.560]
Q-A-M

[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.040]
F*** yourself

[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:28.700]
Will I hate what to do with on Q-A-M?

[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.140]
Put that bag in back on again

[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:34.800]
I want what they had before these are my kind of guys

[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.780]
When the hell they do it anyway

[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.660]
If the man we sounded died was really gay

[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:43.380]
I want more at Christmas

[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.260]
Because the voices feel high

[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.000]
When I listen to the sports

[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.660]
A manly voice won't get my attention

[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.380]
I will really get me sent to the shorts

[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.040]
A squeaky high voice will give me an erection

[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:00.160]
I'll hate what to do with on Q-A-M

[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.640]
Put that bag in back on again

[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.080]
I'm going to miss here at straight men when voices this high

[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.480]
Now I'll have to get deeper in that closet again

[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.280]
So I can impress all the macho friends

[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.560]
The check out Chris Moore at night to help the fans inside

[00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.040]
Yeah, there ain't nothing like having macho sports guys as voices has some fractions

[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.700]
They were 12 years old

[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:26.560]
Yeah, I can't neglect that

[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:30.120]
Yes, stand up real close to the radio and press the sound

[00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.200]
Get their voices out of there

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.900]
Really makes my balls take over here

[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.760]
And that crow man

[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:39.520]
Well, he's smarter than my infrared brother

[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:39.880]
Yep

[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.360]
1032 and 560 WQM

[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:45.060]
We sure aren't getting much uh

[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:46.020]
Uh, uh, uh, slap over

[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:48.240]
You know what I'm talking about? In other words, when we came to Q-A-M

[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.200]
Five and a half years ago, almost six now I guess

[00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:53.360]
Uh, it's like we brought our own audience

[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.460]
Right? You know what I'm talking about?

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.440]
I don't

[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.960]
140 votes on here and uh, I'm a Q-A-M list

[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.100]
There's only three in other words, when they vote for it,

[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.300]
That means they listen to the station and the fact that they listen to Q-A-M

[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.200]
And we're on here is why they're listening to this show

[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.620]
Well, I need to good, I mean, what is that?

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.000]
2.1%? That's pretty lame

[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.320]
56 people say they're listening mainly for liberal talking a few laughs

[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.800]
Neil is the radio god 41, of course that's the operative answer

[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.360]
For humor 28, there's nothing else on five, that's a good point

[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360]
I hate Neil but I can't turn it off for

[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:27.300]
I'm a Q-A-M list, there are only three and I love the crank colors only three out of the first 140 votes

[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:30.620]
Big facts just in here

[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.340]
What does that say? Oh no, who is that? I can't even pronounce the name Larry Hovis

[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:36.700]
Okay

[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.360]
Is that a, do you know who that is? Sergeant Carter?

[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.380]
But is that his name? Larry Hovis

[00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.600]
Yeah, Larry Hovis, that sounds right

[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:47.540]
Actor and comedian best known for his role as Sergeant Carter on the long-running TV show Hogan's Heroes

[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.460]
He was also regular on Gomer Pyle

[00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.540]
Uh, USMC

[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.640]
Well, guess what? He died

[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:59.780]
And also Ronan Martin's laughin who guessed that on numerous games shows during the 70s including match game and the Liars Club

[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:04.020]
died September 9th yesterday of cancer in San Marcos, Texas at age 67

[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:04.620]
Did you die?

[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:07.640]
Larry Hovis, I have no idea who that is

[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.280]
I didn't watch Hogan's Heroes

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:10.580]
Oh, it was great

[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:12.660]
No, it was not great

[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.680]
You thought you never watched it?

[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:16.600]
Well, maybe that's why I don't know it was great

[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.300]
It was funny

[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.640]
Didn't watch Gomer Pyle USMC, didn't watch that, that was just silly

[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.600]
I did watch Ronan Martin's laugh and I don't remember no Larry Hovis though

[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:28.480]
I watched match game, religiously, I love match game, it's still on the Gendro channel all the time

[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:30.300]
Never seen Larry Hovis, this kind of a liar

[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:36.580]
The Liars Club, who was on the Liars Club was that Mike Stokey who was also on Panamide Quiz?

[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:39.300]
I don't know, I don't know

[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:40.360]
Somebody will let us know

[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.200]
So Parker Bryan or one of those old guys will let us know

[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.860]
Anyway, Larry Hovis, who?

[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.720]
I could say but then I'd be lying

[00:27:46.780 --> 00:27:49.700]
Stars from Hogan's Heroes, it says in its facts, they're dropping like flies

[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.780]
Well, goddamn man, he's just a hell of a lot of that death going on, you know what?

[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.240]
What are all these calls on here? I got just too much stuff

[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.660]
We only got till 1230 and then you know me

[00:27:59.280 --> 00:27:59.600]
1230

[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.240]
I'd like to get a few of these idiots on, here's Poppano, hello

[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:03.760]
Hi, Dale

[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.680]
Yes sir, how are you sir?

[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.780]
I'm doing great

[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.420]
Good, the first time I've ever called, I usually don't have time to call you, I work for a living

[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:11.960]
Right

[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.680]
And one thing you really are, you're a very funny guy in fact

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:21.440]
I'm a too bright, I don't even understand how you can attract an audience with you both you and Georgia, extremely intelligent, bright

[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.300]
Yeah, I don't know how you get an audience down here

[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.640]
I wanted to discuss a little bit about this religious fanaticism and how the interest is to the world

[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.680]
Take all the time you like

[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.920]
Yeah, I don't know if you're a fan of Bill Mars

[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.920]
No, I think Bill Mars is an asshole but anyway

[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.740]
But basically he said that the religious fanaticism is dangerous

[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.620]
So the Islamic fanaticism is very dangerous because we feel like they can just blow themselves up and take everyone else with them

[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:52.620]
The Christian fundamentalists are at least amusing, at least they're not there

[00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.920]
They're amusing? Well ask the abortion doctors who got shot and killed while they're amusing or not

[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.060]
Take everyone with them

[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.980]
Yeah, I'm not a sh**

[00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:07.360]
Ask all the people who died in the crusades and in the Spanish Inquisition if it was amusing, have a nice day sir, don't call me again

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.580]
What is this guy? Do I need to Bill Mars fan?

[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.380]
Bill Mars is such an asshole

[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.820]
No, I don't want this guy to take it personally because he likes us but his call is horrible

[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.700]
So keep listening, we hope you'll listen but your call was protested and unacceptable

[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:25.660]
And it's just unconscionable that you would say Shazkrab about the fundamentalist Christians are amusing

[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:30.480]
Not only are they not amusing, they're annoying, they're obnoxious, they're dangerous, they're crazy people

[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.700]
And this is what the problem is is that America takes it all too lightly

[00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:40.140]
We're talking about religious extremists, see this is the reason that the mainstream media because they're so afraid to lose sponsors and offend anybody

[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:47.680]
That's why this whole thing with 9-11, there's very little discussion about religious extremism except the course with Muslim extremists

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:48.960]
Yeah, they're the only bad ones

[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.980]
Right, they're the only bad ones and you recall that people like Billy Graham, Sun, Franklin Graham and all these others in the beginning

[00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.560]
We're making these grotesque as usual comments about Islam

[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.620]
And oh well that's really a violent religion and all that stuff, you know

[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.540]
As opposed to Christianity and the other ones

[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:08.680]
And Judaism which the Jewish God was telling them to like smite all of their enemies, make sure they don't miss any, you know

[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.300]
Religion is sick, it's not a debatable point

[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:19.800]
I mean, you people that are brainwashed and can't mentally emancipate your brains from all the religious indoctrination and bull crap

[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:22.300]
Hey, I understand, it's not easy

[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:29.220]
From the moment that you're old enough to understand even before you really comprehend they start hockin and bangin' it in there and bangin' it in there

[00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.520]
That's what the altar bar said, they keep bangin' it in there

[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.380]
Correct them, that's right

[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.380]
Don't get soar about it

[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.500]
But it's just, oh Christian, now what is this?

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:45.720]
This is a vision of the cap of what is Bob Eisenberg, this guy is on top of stuff, man since we got him that new piece from Czech Alphairi

[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.020]
You almost think he has some clue what he's doing

[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:50.060]
Hey, by the way Bob, you're an asshole too

[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:55.620]
Remember those days? Sure, down on the second floor of Bob Eisenberg running around telling people I was an F&A school

[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.240]
He got his record, he got to know you though

[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.720]
Yeah, he got to know me, he got to know me as a real asshole

[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.380]
I'm an asshole Bob and I'm proud of it, how do you like that? Then Bob and me

[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.780]
Doesn't bother me, I'm an asshole with a big fat paycheck twice a month

[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:09.460]
Including today, Clarence I hope, it better be there, it better be showing up sweetheart

[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.900]
Clarence, who's a real big all of a sudden trying to hold people's money back like poor Scott Jr. there

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.160]
Yeah, the audience has heard this, they know the game, what is this pop it'll be to allegedly

[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.820]
See, this time, you didn't put it on there

[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:27.020]
See Scott, don't pay attention what George tells it because George is a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad, a bad person who gets too emotional

[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.640]
He starts writing down a bunch of numbers, he gets all wild, you know

[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.840]
He just got to calm down, he's got a few more doggy downers before the show would be good

[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:39.240]
But when you put on there like question mark and the ass sure stuff like that and then you keep putting it on

[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.440]
Are you notice how those people disappear?

[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:41.920]
Yes

[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.380]
You want to know why they disappear?

[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.360]
Tell me, because I hang up on them

[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.340]
I thought so

[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:46.980]
I see

[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.980]
Here's Pomfano Beach allegedly, hello

[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:50.020]
Hey Neil, how you doing?

[00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:51.280]
Pretty good, is this a real call?

[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.180]
It's a real call

[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:52.920]
I see

[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:53.760]
Yes

[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.000]
Well, I wanted to make a comment about GW first and say that

[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:58.480]
Yes

[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.700]
I was pretty upset when the whole election thing went down

[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:03.620]
Can barely hear this call for some strange reasons Scott, yes go ahead

[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.220]
Anyways, I was upset about the election but I had no idea what we were in store for

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:11.660]
And just really pisses me off when I think about all that

[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.760]
But as far as your poll today goes, I have a suggestion for you

[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:17.320]
Okay

[00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:22.100]
And why don't you add poll building shows to the reason why people like to listen?

[00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:24.160]
The reason why people listen?

[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:24.660]
Yeah

[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:27.980]
Because they like to poll building shows

[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:33.080]
Well, I think the choice could be I like Neil's poll like Hank says

[00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:33.960]
There you go

[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.900]
I think it's become a central part of the show

[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:36.660]
It has

[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.140]
Give a chance for us to say whether we like it or not

[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.800]
Right

[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:42.040]
Okay, well let's stick it right on there

[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:42.500]
Thanks, Neil

[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.880]
Thanks a lot, Pally, have a great day

[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.980]
It wasn't a good call on line 9 Scott, you keep hanging up on those people on line 9

[00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:49.920]
I like Neil's poll

[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.160]
Yeah

[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:51.180]
Huh?

[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.220]
I hope he's you

[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:53.220]

[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.760]
Don't say hey listen Mr.

[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.200]
You're supposed to be if this is like a Mickey and Isaac conversation you know what I'm talking about?

[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.080]
Well, George has to make it pictures you don't

[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.380]
Just remember me the puppeteer you the lemon

[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.180]
Oh, I know

[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.820]
Yeah, I'll get Mickey on your answer

[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:10.220]
Okay, now what's the I'm the puppet master beta so what are we putting on here now?

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:13.140]
I like Neil's poll

[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:18.220]
That's cute, you know, that's good, but if he goes LL or he can spell the however

[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:21.020]
I'm okay if people are too stupid to understand it then we can't be bothered

[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:21.800]
That was a good call

[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.080]
I suggest you answer that was a good guy see

[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:27.720]
I'm like the guy before him that would mend well that you know

[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:31.880]
Evidently thinks he's intelligent, but he's telling me to Christian it a fundamentalist Christianity now

[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:37.700]
Maybe I didn't let him finish do you think so no he was no he was serious. Yeah, I waited a second to see if like he was going to there was some

[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:40.680]
Some gag or some pun or something

[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:46.920]
So sarcastic don't want to want me to believe that crap about fundamentalist Christians are humorous. They're not humorous

[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.760]
They're pathetic. They're dangerous. They're crazy people who's responsible for this war right now

[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.260]
Are you not can W again? Yes good

[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.860]
I'll get me fired up when I hear someone say that

[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:40.840]
I think I heard someone say that

[00:36:58.500 --> 00:36:58.900]
I'm

[00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:09.420]
46 thank you mr. President for those low gas prices I can't get that punk out of my mind I call that day you know about the

[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:15.820]
Glorious free freeing of the Iraqi people and the lowering of the gas prices at asshole man what a bush liquor

[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.620]
Suicide bomber kills three people in Iraq as the carnage goes on other American soldier died this morning trying to get the little more information about that

[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.980]
But it's just becoming so routine like murders in Miami that they don't even report much on it anymore. You know what I'm saying?

[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.340]
That's old unless you catch the blurb on there real quick. You don't even know another US soldier dead

[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:45.260]
But this is a separate story a suicide bomber exploded in SUV outside the US intelligence headquarters killing three other Iraqis and wounding dozens including four Americans a Kurdish security official said today

[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:51.680]
The US military and Baghdad had said six Americans were wounded later said four intelligence officers were hurt along with the Kurdish

[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:58.340]
Peshmerga guard at the building you know those Peshmerga's who the Kurdish official who spoke on condition you know

[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:02.380]
I was taking yesterday again. I could go off on a long rant. We don't have time today

[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:12.260]
But how is it possible that the public is so God them stupid like the thing with a Taliban all of those years went on nobody gave a fly and

[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:18.020]
Fig about the Taliban about the women with the burkas about they couldn't listen to the music how repressive they were and about the

[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:24.160]
The Spartan existence that these people were forced to live on nobody cared until after 9 11

[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:32.200]
Then all of a sudden we started seeing eight billions to every day there were like a whole other whole bunch of stories about 30 men at the Taliban and a repression that the

[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:39.060]
Foyce did on the poor Afghan people did any how many people in America really give a fly and crap about Afghanistan don't tell me about 30

[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:45.400]
And we wouldn't like five right hey even the Afghan hounds didn't care about it the brownie hounds didn't care about God in Afghanistan

[00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.140]
It couldn't fight it on a map with both hands

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:52.940]
Nope and then all of a sudden here comes the American I'm going to tell you right now the American media are the enablers

[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.820]
There were the ones who enabled Kenny star and all the right-wing Republicans do all that penis gate with Bill Clinton

[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:04.700]
There were the ones who made the whole big son of dance and made it possible for us to get as far as all that impeachment crap and waste millions of dollars of your tax money

[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.280]
And are the same ones who are letting this asshole off the hook who just raised another three million bucks down here in Florida over the last couple days

[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:18.820]
This great shame on you as Michael Moore would say but in this case I'm talking about the freaking American media

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:23.180]
It's a pretty sad commentary when it takes Tammy Fade into the truth

[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.660]
The media is sick and they've got badly

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.920]
The media sick and we need help badly that's the problem

[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:38.900]
Anyway the answer all Islam organization with suspected ties to Belkaita was formerly based near some place that I can't pronounce about 30 miles east of Urbila near the Iranian border

[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:44.860]
And so headquarters was bombed by US jets during the war surviving members of the group were thought to have fled to Iran

[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:48.940]
They're now believed to have returned to Iraq which is now becoming a hotbed of terrorist activity

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:52.580]
Which it wasn't before we started the Iraq attack the Operation Iraqi Freedom

[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:53.400]
Right

[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.680]
How do you like them apples huh?

[00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:58.940]
I'm saying that again don't let me say that anymore don't say I'll hit you know my argument

[00:39:58.940 --> 00:40:02.860]
We all do that we get on for some of the running sticks in your mind if Sam it

[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.700]
Don't let me do that no more okay

[00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:12.060]
Because some things I mean after well gets to be irritating even though it might be true like I think I have herpes like most say an

[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:16.360]
At this morning I think I heard that mall that would be irritating that would be I think I heard

[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.560]
Especially herpes on a scalp under his I think he just I think he had a scalp glued on too tight

[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:24.720]
That's why it was out yesterday. So he's got herpes under his feet appeal it off

[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:31.040]
How is that pull coming this is our first pull we got the important one this is just you know just for clarification

[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:35.680]
I think it's kind of interesting don't you once in a while no you know you don't like this pull of course

[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:41.360]
I like this pull well no when you get me crap nice. I'm like Scott there. I see you trained him bad you trained him so badly

[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.040]
Hey Scott paint no attention to George

[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:46.680]
Venerable was paying attention to George look what happened to him so he wasn't

[00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:57.040]
226 votes so far which of these best describes why you listen to me or Roger show for liberal talking a few laughs 84

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.140]
I think I think that covers it right sure

[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:05.640]
The other four god 65 for a humor 48 there's nothing else on 10

[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.320]
For people who don't like dr. Laura and Russian all the other crap that's on when we're on but that's a good excuse

[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:18.620]
That's why I put it there. I love the crank callers 9. I'm a QM list of six pretty weak Duff and clearance pretty weak

[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:21.400]
You should be bringing us more to the table than that if we had

[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.540]
All right, we were on like a talk station. I'm not talking sports talk

[00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.400]
You know like I would be used to be right was great for about five minutes

[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:37.100]
If we wanted that then we'd be siphoning a tremendous number of listeners from the other shows on a station and we could get instead like a 10 or 11

[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.720]
Sure and then we could go third man right but we're stuck with whatever we got

[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.780]
I hate Neil but I can't turn it off for and I like Neil's pole which Eric being very cute spelled P O L E crossed it out

[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:52.120]
Put P O L Q Eric. He's getting almost too good. You know it's scary. He's great. He the Eric is great

[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:57.660]
So we take it see this goes to show you as long as you're still breathing. It's never too late to be rehabilitated

[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.520]
Absolutely, no, not you Moe. You're there's no hope for you. It's too late

[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.280]
Carol King wrote that song. It's too late now

[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.420]
Number the name of the song. It's too late

[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.740]
Yeah, it wasn't any of the song you know like Carl King. She couldn't see you out of a paper sack

[00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:16.320]
Why did she write she wrote some good songs though? Carol King like a hundred did she well about there

[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:21.260]
She wrote a lot of music Carol King she couldn't sing for a Schmidt kind of like Bob Dylan Bob Dylan wrote great music though

[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.620]
And couldn't sing at all. No, we not a note just annoying and whiny

[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:30.800]
FCC says Howard Stern's Ronsky Radio show is a news program. How do you like that?

[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:32.680]
Nice going howie

[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.780]
When you think about news shows what comes to mind it says there's meetings on CNN's the website

[00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:42.200]
There's meat the press and face the nation of course if you do a good job on meat the press. Oh

[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:46.420]
Yeah rule the world. That was another memorable call that that asshole

[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.840]
Oh, oh, you know something this this you just facts me that was gonna. Oh

[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:58.300]
This is gotta be on a pool. Oh, we'll have to leave this up there till like 11 30 or something

[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:04.020]
Do you want to know why I know why this is sunny Fox? I listen to your Rogers because I can hear the word asshole right

[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.580]
Because I like to hear the word asshole that Eric I hate to force you to pull one more on here. It's my bad

[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.880]
Because here's the facts from Ralphie uses I listen to your show because I like to hear the word asshole

[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:19.660]
So that's that's the other choice center because I like to hear the word asshole speaking of which I saw guy wearing a t-shirt that said my mother

[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.420]
Told me I could be anything I wanted to be I decided to be an asshole

[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.940]
To which we say oh yeah, what's wrong with that? What's wrong with being an asshole?

[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:35.280]
Anyway getting back to this story about Howard Spurm the Federal Communications Commission rule yesterday that Howard's Ronsky Radio program is a

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.860]
Bonified news interview program

[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.800]
The decision was in response to request made by the New York based Infinity Broadcasting Inc

[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:48.240]
Which wanted a ruling that it's widely syndicated Stern show as a news program an exempt from equal time requirements for political candidates

[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.560]
The decision will allow Stern to put actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the air without having to offer

[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:56.340]
Equal time the discourse of other candidates running for governor in California

[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.680]
Siting an 84 decision that the qualified the Donahue talk show for news exemption and of course

[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:07.620]
Don't you always think generally a Phil Donahue and Howard Stern like in the same vein? Oh, I've got a difference being that Howard is still on the year

[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:13.420]
The FCC said there should be room for less conventional interview formats to increase coverage of the political process

[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:20.640]
Since the Donahue decision other news interview programs are segments there are with unique and innovative format elements such as the Sally Jesse Raphael show

[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:25.160]
Jerry Springer and politically incorrect with the anxious idiotic Bill Mar have qualified for the news interview

[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.080]
You know Bill Mar is just a putts, you know, I wouldn't even say he's an asshole. He's a putts

[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.020]
He's just very he's ineffectual. He's like a poor man's dick cabin, right?

[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.480]
I can't stand it. He's just a wimpy little nerdy guy

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.980]
I know that stupid that stupid book about if you ride alone you're riding with Osama

[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:47.600]
I mean what a stupid bunch of crap, you know and then Ariana Huffington who lately has been writing some good stuff

[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:51.760]
But you know what what what what what was the one that she wrote her and she said the same thing

[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:58.700]
Something like that right some of some of you driving us you be your a terrorist something like that some similar kind of crap

[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.580]
Can't stand Bill Mar

[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:07.940]
See pull it and then hold politically incorrect thing to people well, you know, he's he's anti-established man big deal who cares

[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.100]
So for often the so's Ralph Nader what what he do for us?

[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:16.860]
Look what he helped us get look what he let all you people have voted for Nader in 2000 shame on you man

[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.120]
Shame on you including Michael Moore as much as I love Michael Moore

[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.220]
He voted for Nader and speaking of Donahue. He not only voted for Nader

[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.400]
He was banging the drums. He was the the cheerleader

[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.280]
It is pom-poms out

[00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:32.160]
Remember that I do I mean you know

[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.300]
I'm not saying that Ralph Nader doesn't have some very good points

[00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:37.600]
But the point the point is that what's the sense of throwing your vote away?

[00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:41.640]
So and it isn't that what I was screaming back then I was screaming look what we got now

[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.500]
You want a janko look what we got you warned everybody I warned you

[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.460]
You vote for Nader and throw your photo wait

[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.920]
It'll be close enough they can like weasel this thing in there and they weasel their way in man

See this is supposed to be a democracy

[00:46:01.340 --> 00:46:07.620]
Not a goddamn monarchy and between the Kennedys and the Rockefellers and the bushes you see what it's all about

[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:16.580]
Handful a very very dubious suspicious wealthy families who acquired their wealth most of them through a by hook and mostly by crook

[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.340]
Just like Joe Kennedy with his goddamn bootleg

[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.520]
By the way, how's Brian Reese's toe doing?

[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.040]
Every time I hear that I think

[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.060]
I said Brian greasy. I don't know why I don't know

[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:29.700]
Well, maybe he's got it maybe spent a lot of time in Amsterdam. He belches a lot

[00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:32.700]
I have told you by the way that in Amsterdam it's considered to be in

[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:37.640]
It's not considered in to be rude or in bad taste to belts in public in fact, it's like

[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:43.600]
Yeah, it's just part of the ambiance. Great. You know that no. I do know well now you know that

[00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.680]
Just think about and there were about 400 people showed up at that protest yesterday

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.840]
We'll get to that like I said we got a lot of stuff a lot of fish to fry and so little time

[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:57.080]
So little time plus we got these great calls their whole bunch of money

[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.520]
Which we might get to or not as the case maybe I'll get to you just relax. Okay. You got nothing else going on there

[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:07.300]
Did we add the other a category on air because they want to hear the word asshole?

You'll be able to smell it from coast to coast this is a great fact you just said me I love this fact it is a great fact

[00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.960]
It says I heard you mentioned the other day that Rocky and Bullwinkle was a great show

[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:22.480]
The first season has been released on DVD two complete stories

[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:28.740]
Jet Fuel Formula and Box Top robbery along with fractured fairy tales narrated by Miss Edward Everett Horton and Mr. Peabody

[00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:32.840]
It's a brilliant hilarious show way ahead of its time and you are absolutely correct

[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.320]
The facts goes on to say I listen to your show for a humor and read the website for news

[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:39.120]
So-called liberal conservative talk is contrived and boring

[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.100]
And then here comes the good part and again a thought a knock on the goddess but he's he's right

[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:49.260]
Someone like Randy has her heart in the right place but she's just spinning her wheels especially in this town

[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.960]
She had organized buses yesterday to take protest

[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:56.360]
Just the only thing you all the intas were saying was Randy the bus doesn't have air conditioning

[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:02.460]
He's gonna give herself a coronary embolism for nothing sir you again you are absolutely correct

[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.560]
You have a great fact in the history of broadcasting

[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:09.000]
Randy like the guy says your heart's in the right place and you know you're spinning your field

[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.400]
Can we spin the wheel?

[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:12.780]
Now speaking of Miss Fudge

[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:19.000]
Remember the guy that called yesterday and was all bent out of shape about whoopie Goldberg and I said hey if you don't like whoopie Goldberg don't watch the show

[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.820]
I sure didn't

[00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:21.300]
But guess what?

[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:21.660]
What?

[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:25.660]
Whoopie upset it was rated the top show of the night

[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:33.120]
High fives in studio city Miss Fudge says this morning as NBC whoopie pulled the biggest audience in prime time last night

[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:39.900]
With a 12.5 rating in a 20-year despite cat calls from the critics the sitcom had more than double the viewership of its nearest competitor

[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:46.840]
It scored nearly three times the audience of anybody else in New York City in the 8 p.m. Times lab with a 14 rating in a 22 share in WNBC

[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.660]
Nearly one out of four homes in New York with TVs to an arm or two into Goldberg

[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:52.700]
Whoopie it was at Hank Goldberg

[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.340]
Hey, stupid

[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.880]
Whoopie scored a 20 share in LA 19 Chicago 20 in Philly 25 in Houston ruled a 26 share in Vegas

[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.740]
How do you like that says Miss Fudge

[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:08.160]
What does that tell you there's something really really sick and wrong with America if people are watching whoopie Goldberg

[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.660]
I'm I'm seriously I can't I get physically ill but I'm just she's nauseating yeah

[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:20.280]
Plus I have an aversion to the whole roster locks thing anyway I mean Goldilocks I don't mind but the roster locks I just I can't look at it

[00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:26.900]
So I somebody would like real cartoon red here like carrot like carrot top that kind of I can't handle it

[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:29.840]
That doesn't make them a bad person necessarily although they usually are

[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:36.840]
President Bush collects three million dollars at Florida fundraisers oh this this makes me want a puke

[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.880]
Oh, yeah, I'm mighty

Yesterday was a three million dollar day for L president day is his reelection campaign into fundraising jackpot by a bunch of crackpots in Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale

[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:52.920]
The twin Florida fundraisers brought in a half a million dollars more than the Bush team had expected to pick up

[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.280]
The events propelled the president's reelection campaign coffers past the 62.4 million dollar mark

[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:06.080]
The centerpiece of his four list are article by the way the Sun sent a written by the umptuous and highly homophobic and disgusting looking buddy nevans speaking of assholes

[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:11.320]
The centerpiece of his four-law to nail visited less than four hours was at a crowded reception at the high at pier 66

Across the street about 400 demonstrators chanted slogan some of them obscene body points out against the president and the war in Iraq

[00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.820]
And one of the few large South Florida protest rally since the start of the war

[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:34.840]
There were some of the things that were yelling were Randy there's no air conditioning on this freaking bus

[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.680]
Where's the early bird?

[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:42.200]
Bush outlined his achievements to largely Republican audience in a well-secured ballroom

[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.640]
He was repeatedly interrupted by a plosening talked about the war on terrorism

[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:51.560]
The president was introduced by his brother the extraordinarily anxious governor Jeb Bush who told the crowd

[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.360]
Imagine what the world would look like if my brother wasn't elected in 2000

[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.680]
You know that really you know something yeah what what are we talk about football?

Imagine what the world would look like if my brother wasn't elected in 2000

[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.060]
Which of course first of all he wasn't elected that's number one but number two and you know what this is?

[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:12.380]

He had grouped sex with the entire state of Florida Jeb

[00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:19.860]
And then of course he says well I've got devious plans for that for that constitutional at the school size amendment

[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:27.340]
Then the public passes it and he starts unleashing his devious plans and tries to like twerk the world of the public

[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.760]
Like you guys didn't really mean this did you?

I mean he comes right out he gets caught on tape saying he screwed a public okay I've got some devious plans for that

[00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:38.840]
And the public says hey we like that let's put you back in the rigged

Here's the good news though

[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:02.040]
Right on the heels of that about him raising the three million bucks

[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:05.200]
He hasn't got a child in his chance if you like somewhere tomorrow against any Democrat

[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:12.440]
I don't know who that was they could bring back George McGovern again they could dust off water Mondale who lost him in a soda even and he still would be bush

[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:22.500]
With a sweeping 61 vote the Santa Cruz California City Council became the first local government in the country yesterday to ask Congress to look into a peaching president bush

[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:23.120]
Yeah

[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.880]
It's time for us to open up this can of worms of councilman Tim Fitz Morris

[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.020]
No relation to Morris Gibb late in grade

[00:58:32.020 --> 00:58:35.000]
I was butchered in a month's sarnight

[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:43.340]
City leaders say bush violated international treaties by going to war in Iraq and that the president manipulated public fierce to justify the war and undercut constitutional rights and he is

[00:58:43.340 --> 00:58:44.760]
Absolutely correct

[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:54.720]
The resolution authorizes Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Riley to send letter to the House Judiciary Committee chairman James Sensenbrenner asking if bushes committed any impeachable offenses that could lead to his ouster

[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.960]
Or let's only hope

[00:58:56.500 --> 00:59:03.920]
The council vote came in pack chambers were supporters of the resolution lined the walls some carried signs that read honor the constitution impeachment now

[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:04.320]
Oh

[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.800]
And God bless and keep bush out of power

[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:08.320]
What do you like that?

[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:09.700]
I like it a lot

[00:59:09.700 --> 00:59:13.560]
The settlement of those signs was echoed by members of the council the vote again was six to one

[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.900]
I happen to think what's going on is a high crime in Mr. Meener

[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:22.080]
But let's leave that to the US Congress to decide said councilman in US and you see Santa Cruz professor Mike Rocken

[00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:26.300]
Tom Mullin a retired dentist was one of three people at the meeting was spoke out against the resolution

[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.400]
It's not an issue that the city council should be involved in this just serves to divide the community he be saying

[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:38.580]
Such divisive political stands aren't unusual in the coastal town a year ago Santa Cruz became the first of what was well to 165 city councils

[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:40.100]
To oppose the war against Iraq

[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:44.080]
Santa Cruz was also one of more than a hundred cities declaring its opposition to the patriarch

[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.260]
So did Broward County but the local papers didn't want you to know about unless you're up to two minutes still midnight

[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:55.460]
You assholes at the Sun Center you scumbags you low-lights you degenerates and in April the city in County of Santa Cruz

[00:59:55.460 --> 01:00:02.840]
So the DEA in attorney general John Askrop marking the first time a public entity is so the federal government on behalf of patients who need medical marriage a weeny

[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:04.480]
So we love Santa Cruz California

[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:04.920]
Oh right

[01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:05.420]
You betcha

[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:12.800]
Some people with some real balls okay not a bunch of pansies who just rule over and play dead every time the guy didn't government goose steps in their backyard

[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:15.060]
We love Santa Cruz right

[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.820]
Almost as much as we love Freddy Cruz

[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.500]

[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.020]

Oh that was great see that's the second pool but Eric when he like makes the shift on air yeah he changes the head the head around here if I can say that before he changes the that's great

[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:08.860]
and I got sucked into it I got sucked into it the first pool is well which of these best describes why you listen to the Elijah show for liberal talking a few last 116

[01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:28.760]

[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:42.960]
I thought that guy had a good suggestion but nobody else did apparently what I'm saying he's right the pool is an important part of the show but that's not why they listen and anyway here's the second pool since it is such an important part of the show

[01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:51.260]
other than George W. Bush who is the most dangerous man in the world today now here's my list so far you can add to it of course as you want or not as a case maybe

[01:04:52.700 --> 01:05:04.320]
Osama bin Laden Osama your mama Dick Taney Donald Rumsfeld Mohawar David Neil Rogers Kim Jong Il or Rush Limbaugh I think that's a good list oh yeah

[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:12.540]
huh covered I don't think it's covered I think there might be a few others on there which I don't that I just mention them because then people won't call in with them

[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:28.220]
other than G. W. Bush who is the most dangerous oh geez I'm so obvious God the Pope you're out can I leave you pop off of there huh the big potato the Pope a man a silly old man in a dress God

[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:36.480]
all of he is a really snappy dresser and I sure love that miter and that schmata that he's got other than George W. Bush the most dangerous man in the world today

[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:48.880]
Osama bin Laden Dick Taney Donald Rumsfeld Mohawar David Neil Rogers Kim Jong Il Rush Limbaugh or the Pope the Pope who smokes the fat rope 5 6 7 0 5 6

[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:59.240]

[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:14.000]
here's Fort Lauderdale hello Neil yes sir your next poll should be Jeb's question what would the world be like if his BDI to ask whole of a brother hadn't been selected to the White House

[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:32.800]
that's a good that's a good suggestion now also I have a opinion and a story of a new story I disrespectfully disagree with your previous caller who said that the mentalist Christians were amusing they are as dangerous and as big of threat

[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:42.200]
that the freedom and life in the United States as any other group of religious fundamentalist wackos in the world absolutely correct

[01:06:42.800 --> 01:07:01.600]
the news story is from Alabama here it talks about how the governor's request for a tax increase was rejected despite the fact that he told the voters of Alabama that it was their Christian duty to help the poor

[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:21.400]
by shifting the burden of paying taxes more to the people who could afford paying taxes and the comment in the paper was from a political expert in Alabama that Christians do believe but they also vote their pocketbooks

[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:48.520]
so what does that tell you about who their God really is and once again Alabama leading the nation in idiocy well don't forget Jojo yeah well and the city as well did you listen to the democratic debates last night I did not they had some good lines and one of the questioners asked the candidates what their favorite song was yeah

[01:07:48.520 --> 01:08:07.040]
and Al Sharpton had the best answer he said his favorite song was the theme song of the Republican party talking loud and saying nothing by James Brown you take care of you to you to it like it is hanging there probably have a great day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty the new pull is up by the way

[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:50.040]
Alaska no I'm not talking about the size geographic I'm talking about in population California yeah so in other words you don't think it says something about the U.S.

[01:08:50.040 --> 01:09:10.000]
somewhere the public is going if we elect some stupid ass movie actor is governor that guy could bench 400 pounds at all all great he could bench 400 assholes is what he said there you go he could bench 400 pounds well in that case what about the Jack Lalein he used to bench like 420 you you symboled him what look at the right

[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:27.240]
I have another point but I was distracted by that four hundred pound Arnold call oh yeah how beautiful

[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:32.500]
you know the read who the governor of a state is really isn't overall that important to the

[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.120]
rest of us in the country except for one thing just like in Florida the governor gets to pick

[01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:43.200]
the secretary of state who then picks the secretary of elections like Catherine Harris those types

[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.660]
characters and that is the importance of the governor it isn't just that but the fact is that

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:51.340]
it's again it's attempt by the right-wing lunatics but these people are wanting to subvert the

[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:56.560]
will of the public and overturn a legal election which is unusual in this country to have legal

[01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:59.960]
legitimate elections anymore and then that's what it's all about it has nothing to do with

[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.240]
the great Davis and so they prop up this you know somebody was tremendous popularity because they

[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:09.920]
know that all the pop stars anybody who's a pop icon in this country for whatever reason is

[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.720]
almost unbeatable and that is Arnold you know I'm more on well but the purpose of it is to get a

[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:19.440]
hold of the electoral college votes of California which is that's great enough that ain't gonna have

[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.860]
well we'll see because you know listen I'll bet George and Scott's life on a right now to next

[01:18:24.860 --> 01:18:29.440]
year's election George W's got as much chance of winning a California as you've got to finding

[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.140]
50 million cash in your backyard in that lottery ticket I agree with you but it is part of

[01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:37.360]
their ongoing campaign that you were talking about and uh but uh something that I did see this

[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:42.100]
morning that was very disturbing that further confirms what you've been saying in my mind about

[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.760]
the press being fully beholden to this president in their campaign right as I was watching uh or

[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:51.900]
listing two in the background that American morning show on CNN that has Darren Kagan there

[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:57.800]
yeah and uh she cuts who Walter Rogers their correspondent in uh in Baghdad right sure you've

[01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.800]
seen him yes I mean he gave the report on that poor soldier that was killed trying to disarm a

[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:09.540]
one of those improvised bombs and uh he reported that in the last 24 hours six of our troops have been

[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:15.440]
killed and I've been scouring everywhere all over the internet yeah where the hell is that still yes

[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.500]
yes this is I can't even find a story on the internet about the one the one soldier they're admitting

[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:24.640]
got killed yeah I'm just stunned by this at a time when the president is receiving a lot of

[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:30.540]
criticism for this 87 billion dollars on top of the hundred seven billion dollars in tax cut

[01:19:30.540 --> 01:19:34.320]
well I don't hear too many people complain about that I'm just checking right now I'll read

[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:38.880]
to you they're finally they're finally admitting now two after days without an American fatality

[01:19:39.420 --> 01:19:44.760]
two US soldiers were killed in separate incidents over the last 24 hours a US central command says

[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.620]
well Walter Rogers just confirmed that he had spoken with them at sent comm and six soldiers

[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:54.640]
according to his report this morning that six soldiers have died in the last 24 hours and for what

[01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.520]
and for them that's the question we got American kids dying over there every single day they've

[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:02.640]
lied to now they're saying we have we have no idea how long you're going to have to be there

[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:07.100]
we have no idea when there's no end in sight that the war is really still going on as well

[01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:10.740]
Wolfowitz said and this you know the public is for life to an Airbusy watching

[01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:15.180]
whoopie Goldberg well I have one question to ask you and everyone else out there

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:21.540]
if our troops want to come home and their tours of duty have been extended longer than the

[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:28.780]
contract that they have signed aren't they now technically conscripts you're asking me well I'm just

[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:32.980]
I'm just point throwing that out at this sort of like a point of order maybe for a consideration

[01:20:32.980 --> 01:20:37.320]
point of order folks point of order I don't know somebody maybe knows the answer I don't know you

[01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:42.400]
know aren't they technically conscripts and that they're there beyond their I think under the

[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.820]
opinion act and under the mandate of Donald Hermann Gehring-Rumsfeld they're going to be there

[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:50.180]
as long as we want them to be there regardless and that's true good luck to us all Neil thank you

[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:54.160]
I think I think it's the uh Scott junior philosophy we just decided they're going to be there

[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:58.120]
without pay have a great day sir be good yeah we're really taking good care of veterans aren't we

[01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:05.200]
this administration so scandal the people in Santa Cruz are right man they got it right on the money

[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:11.360]
impeach today before this insanity go just gets to well already is totally out of control

[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:19.580]
87 billion yeah it's worth it and it has nothing to do with the war on terror as he keeps saying

[01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.260]
nothing to do with it zero zippity doda the the P-neck people decided this holy rack attack

[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:31.360]
years ago we put even a stole a 2000 election but don't and of course you won't find that in the

[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:37.000]
mainstream media you won't find nothing about that I'll say it again without the media they are

[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.400]
complicit there are part of this all you media assholes out there and I know you listen

[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:48.260]
the people of the CNN bureau and Miami y'all listen to this show your bunch of lunatics your

[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:53.880]
vietnam it only went only went after the public went nuts mostly on college campuses first and then

[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:57.800]
finally when the public began realize how many thousands of kids were coming home in body bags and

[01:21:57.800 --> 01:22:03.220]
they really totally turned against the war only then did the media finally decided like start telling

[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:08.000]
us the truth because if you wait here truth from the u.s government I'm not just talking about

[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:11.380]
bush I'm talking about anybody in the u.s government you wait here the truth you're going to wait a

[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:17.280]
