[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]
Oh, you love me. Long time, son, young guy.

[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.100]
You love you long time.

[00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.200]
Good morning, God. How are you?

[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.060]
Okay, Scott, what's up?

[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.840]
Oh, I thought that was glorious.

[00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.880]
You were right about the...

[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.280]
Marlins again, let's say you haven't been wrong

[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.600]
about the Marlins once all year.

[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.480]
Even their dismal...

[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.740]
But, in this world, we're serious too, man.

[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.600]
It makes no difference.

[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:20.640]
Yankees are the red socks.

[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.380]
They both sucked. They're already the choke.

[00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.660]
My father said that the cups would come out and game seven

[00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.680]
and be only a shadow of themselves.

[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.680]
That the fans would be a shadow of themselves.

[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.000]
And they went out and...

[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.680]
You really got a little excited when it was five-three.

[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.020]
They were having their party on wavelength.

[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.060]
And that all ended.

[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.580]
To see coming out gets that ball.

[00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.740]
I mean, just what went through your mind when they...

[00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.140]
This team was 13. Games out.

[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.500]
You know what went through my mind?

[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:41.140]
Really what?

[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.120]
Is that I got two primo box seats.

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.920]
Oh, yeah, eBay, they're into the three games.

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.300]
And they're going to be on eBay.

[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.460]
And I'm going to make a fortune.

[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.480]
That's what went through my mind.

[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.540]
That is beautiful.

[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.200]
Yeah. Capitalism and its best.

[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.760]
Never went to one game all season.

[00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.300]
And then, into a Marlin game in the years.

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.700]
And I'm going to make thousands.

[00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.540]
Thanks a lot, Greg, you idiot.

[00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.780]
By the way, speaking of Greg Reed,

[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.540]
he was passing around a trophy yesterday.

[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.860]
Yeah.

[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.380]
Everybody.

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.460]
That wasn't for QA, it was for power.

[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.460]
And now, I know it is, but he took credit.

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.260]
And now, today is Boss' day.

[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.280]
And they passed around a card for him.

[00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.840]
And I signed Boss' blow.

[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.720]
Yeah.

[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.200]
I got something for him.

[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.300]
I can't be there to sign a card.

[00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.160]
But here's something, Greg.

[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.920]
To tell you what we all think of you.

[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.880]
You idiot.

[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.180]
Here's one for you.

[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.200]
How much do you think?

[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.600]
How much money do you think he can make on the world series tickets?

[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.020]
But, for the man.

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.980]
That is so sweet.

[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.180]
How much do you think I can make?

[00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.940]
I think that you can make a...

[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.580]
Give him a grand.

[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.880]
How many seats are there?

[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.680]
For each game.

[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.680]
How many seats available to the public?

[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.820]
No, to you, to you.

[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.920]
Oh, I got a pair.

[00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.640]
For each game.

[00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.800]
I think there were, um,

[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.340]
13-15 hundred bucks per game.

[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.840]
For the pair?

[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.200]
Yes.

[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.020]
You're in dreamin'.

[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.340]
The playoff tickets were going for a 25 hundred bucks

[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.460]
and a pair for Primo seats.

[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.720]
25 hundred a piece.

[00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.460]
At the Marlins' Cup, they were not going for that price.

[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.220]
Well, that's what it said in your newspapers and they never lie.

[00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.360]
Well, the newspapers lie.

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.340]
Kevin Bass said I was...

[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.000]
The freaking Sun sent over to lie?

[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.000]
Well, Jim Sarni would lie for me.

[00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.000]
He said, I don't see.

[00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.300]
He sold them ugly.

[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.340]
They only let him out two days a year, like a groundhog.

[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.380]
Put him, put him, put him, put him.

[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.400]
I'll be here all the week.

[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.020]
Which is two days more than Barry Jacket.

[00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.040]
Hey, most go on with the show.

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.000]
Most go on with the show.

[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.640]
Barry has a little paper bag lunch that he takes to work every day.

[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.360]
And Mommy drives Barry to work at the herl.

[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.860]
Did you know that?

[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.640]
He's got a nice haircut.

[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.360]
Most go on the game and you know what?

[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.080]
He's turned into QAM and appearance fee to go to the Marlins' World Series.

[00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.620]
Absolutely.

[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.520]
Yeah, it's great.

[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840]
I got news for it.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.000]
They'll give him an appearance fee when he starts showing up after the book comes out today.

[00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.600]
This is the big one.

[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.940]
No, no, no.

[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.960]
On the next Tuesday when we have a buyout a day on QAM.

[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.500]
Did it buy out my contract?

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.120]
All right.

[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.080]
Buyout hits.

[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.040]
Better than those tickets.

[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.260]
I'm going to wear t-shirts that have a cross through his face that say,

[00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.540]
fill us in and give him the any-why should we?

[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.500]
You're a bone through most nose.

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.240]
That sounds good.

[00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.660]
Yeah, I think he already does have a bone somewhere.

[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.980]
Let me tell you, wouldn't it be a great act of kindness after all these years for me to say to the audience?

[00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.600]
Listen, because you've been so dedicated in the voter all these years,

[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.760]
instead of like peddling my tickets on eBay,

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.700]
because I don't need the money.

[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.760]
Your buddy, Scott Jr., has given me a bunch of crap this morning before the show.

[00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.440]
Oh, you don't need the money or loads.

[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.240]
I'm broke!

[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.080]
I broke!

[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.420]
I left my house!

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.120]
He's a family!

[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.100]
I wanted that!

[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.180]
That's my job!

[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.640]
I have to work him away right now!

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.940]
I'm here, just to show you what a good guy is.

[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.380]
I'm a kid, I have a war!

[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.480]
Why do people like to be waiting on my dress?

[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.500]
Just give my Marlon World Series tickets away today, but don't count on it.

[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.920]
No way!

[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.600]
Dude, I screwed a publicist's money theory.

[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.380]
When I make money, I mean, you and I can...

[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.000]
Listen, if I get tickets, I'll be just like Todd Greck,

[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.040]
I'll sell them for like 1500 a whack to one of my clients and rip them off.

[00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.560]
That'll be great.

[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.480]
But, you think I can make his 1500 a pair?

[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.540]
Yeah, I think he should.

[00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.160]
1500 per seat.

[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.360]
Oh, 1500 per seat, right?

[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.640]
Yeah!

[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.460]
So these three grand times these nine grand, I'll take it.

[00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.080]
That's beautiful.

[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.020]
And then you get...

[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.760]
What are you gonna do with the money?

[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.120]
Maybe we can buy more cash.

[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.740]
We can't, I could have a pompadopark with nine grand in cash.

[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.940]
We can give five grand adi-candle, we'll buy more cash.

[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.560]
Why did you say that?

[00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.600]
Because some adi-candle turned it into 15 grand and we can get rid of them all.

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.320]
Have a great day, Neil.

[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.460]
Absolutely.

[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.040]
Absolutely.

[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.740]
See us, guys.

[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.080]
Ireland's worth it.

[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.600]
Ireland's worth it.

[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:20.440]
Ireland's worth it.

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.480]
Ireland's...

[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.320]
Give me another bag.

[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:23.460]
There's a big buster.

[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.500]
He's really showing his age.

[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.380]
He doesn't have to take more than a minute of him weight.

[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.520]
He can take him can ya.

[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.900]
If you don't work like a slave, take parts of DOOM's bag.

[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.320]
DOOM's bag.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.660]
Got a dieting.

[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.780]
Black and 15 night to pay hold up.

[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.440]
A concletum life is a sided.

[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.840]
And he's a lifelike, a lay white, the art of DOOM's bag.

[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.320]
DOOM's bag.

[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.900]
Oh, the chain of crappy chic, register runs DOOM's bag.

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.400]
DOOM's bag.

[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.120]
He's a fully waged to employees.

[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.440]
Adi-candle, arts of DOOM's bag.

[00:04:59.180 --> 00:04:59.760]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.420]
I kinda cut the white and the men were a DOOM's bag.

[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.860]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.200]
With all the girls he's got, he drives around in the Dutch caravan.

[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.020]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.460]
Dick got the gig.

[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.320]
Two replace-pile porn, who banged the kid.

[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.260]
In the back of his horn, that's all he did.

[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.820]
The band stand was born, the Clarkson DOOM's bag.

[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.360]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.320]
He seemed delighted.

[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.460]
With anybody with wind, the cashier prices.

[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.580]
On the fear of myth, he never mind it.

[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.900]
The cashier wasn't his, the Clarkson DOOM's bag.

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.300]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.940]
I never realized what a fan piece of crappy is.

[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:46.800]
After all the years I've been working in, the Clarkson Crank Eel comes in every calcantre.

[00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.840]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.380]
DOOM's bag.

[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.900]

[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.580]
1006, how about those Marlins?

[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.920]
What do I tell you, Eve?

[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.620]
Little Faith, you could hear the girdling choking gagging sounds from those cubs.

[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.500]
You could hear them all of it North America last night.

[00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.240]
It's not the crying.

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.180]
The even George, I told you this yesterday, even George got sucked in.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.120]
The Cubs got sucked into.

[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.040]
I didn't know it was going on still.

[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.720]
But I thought I could check into it.

[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.520]
He just came across my accident and you just couldn't drive it at the end.

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.240]
Right at the end, and it was perfect timing.

[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.540]
Right at the end, just in time to see the last five minutes.

[00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.340]
And I saw the old lady crying and I went,

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.380]
Oh, she's got a can.

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.060]
I can't.

[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.280]
It was like when Frater was sitting on the curb there when Don Corleone gets shot five times.

[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.940]
Again, again.

[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.760]
He's like rocking back and forth on the curb.

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:33.640]
Again, he's whimpering like mufflinzy.

[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.400]
Did you ever see Frater and Duck together?

[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.960]
No.

[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.580]
Same person.

[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.260]
Same shape.

[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.460]
Hey, by the way, Duck, don't go fishing this weekend, especially with Clarence.

[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.200]
He wants you a part of the gig too.

[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.060]
He wants to go to both titles and a whole paycheck.

[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.240]
By the way, speaking of earning your paycheck, Clarence, I hate to write the news to you,

[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.840]
but you're an idiot.

[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.760]
He's so busy sitting in a sniffing Forell's Bud that he doesn't have time to get the schedule right.

[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.300]
The game tonight is at 818 first pitch.

[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.100]
820 give or take is what they're saying.

[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.960]
820.

[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.400]
The schedule I got in front of me is got Hurricane Hotline on from 7 to 9.

[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.660]
And then they're, they're Ricky Williams show from 9 to 10.

[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.300]
You like that?

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.360]
Whatever.

[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.120]
But it's also got like, for example, if needed, game seven,

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.500]
you know, the Yankees and Red Sacks, it's got it at 9 o'clock.

[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.060]
Is that correct?

[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:25.400]
No.

[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.320]
The game is at 820, okay, in New York.

[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.240]
820, you idiot Clarence, you cymbled in you.

[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.780]
So evidently, we're not going to have like the whole Hurricane Hotline.

[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.600]
And we certainly can have no Ricky Williams show, are we?

[00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.920]
No.

[00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.820]
No, we're not going to preempt the game.

[00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.340]
So unless we're going to join it in progress, I don't know, I doubt that.

[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.840]
Wouldn't that be kind of embarrassing, Scott?

[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.640]
Sure would.

[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.760]
That would be almost as embarrassing as farming out that Panther game.

[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.320]
And Scott, once again, as usual, is wrong.

[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.580]
Trying to tell me, no, you actually at the game last night?

[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.340]
Of course I was.

[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.140]
Because you had your free tickets for the, oh, penis coyotes, the lovely penis coyotes and the Panthers.

[00:07:58.700 --> 00:07:59.820]
A penis one, two to one.

[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.440]
I watched about, oh, maybe 15 minutes of it here and there in between the baseball.

[00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.800]
Now, I did not watch 60 minutes, two last night.

[00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.080]
I didn't watch small,ville sorry, but I was really a baseball intensive.

[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.700]
I must admit, I watched the entire game.

[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.840]
How do you like that?

[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.100]
Wow.

[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.740]
Well, I mean, it was a heavy duty.

[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.600]
It was a lot of tension.

[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.320]
It was excitement.

[00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.840]
It's an annual rate.

[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.280]
Huh?

[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:19.980]
It's an event.

[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.720]
It was a major event.

[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.620]
So Scott tells me there were 5,000 people at the Panther game last night.

[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.740]
You must be counting all the people at the Sawgrass Mills Mall.

[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.900]
You must have been counting all the people living in the 50 block radius.

[00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.240]
Including all my neighbors out there, any acres.

[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.080]
I mean, are you out of your mind?

[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.900]
If it, seriously, if there were a thousand people in that Macarena last night, it was a lot.

[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.900]
And I was watching, they, they had on the package last night the Phoenix Telecast.

[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:49.960]
So again, they weren't protecting the local, uh, locals from, you know, from embarrassment.

[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:52.800]
So they kept, you know, they panned every now and then you saw the whole place.

[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.740]
There was nobody there.

[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.740]
And I'm not knocking anybody.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:01.100]
I mean, why would anybody be there when you got the, you know, Marlins and Cubs game seven on TV?

[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.200]
And everybody's transfixed and glued to that.

[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.920]
Why would anybody be at a meaningless early season hockey game, especially against the team that nobody cares about?

[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.440]
Yeah.

[00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:10.760]
And the home team that nobody knows who most of the players are anyway.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.000]
The only cheering last night was when they put the Marlin score.

[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.680]
There you go.

[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.320]
Now, if they'd have been smart, they'd have probably telecast the game on the big screen up there.

[00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.460]
Of course, the Panthers would have been too happy about that.

[00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.000]
But you know what I'm saying? Wouldn't that have been a good idea?

[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.720]
It would have been.

[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.500]
Yeah, put it on there while they didn't.

[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.660]
But then again, the game up on the diamond, whatever they call that thing on that screen up there.

[00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.240]
So the public can see it instead of seeing Galdes ugly, push.

[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.180]
Good God.

[00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:35.300]
Scary.

[00:09:36.060 --> 00:09:39.380]
So we got a big day today, boys and girls, a gigantic day.

[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.760]
We're just killing three hours here before we get started.

[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:42.120]
Right.

[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.680]
So one o'clock?

[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.940]
Play some music or something.

[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.780]
Yeah, let's just pretend, okay?

[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.880]
Like most every other day.

[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.320]
And then a one o'clock, we got the ratings this summer book coming up.

[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.600]
Oh!

[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.320]
That was summer book, generally speaking.

[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.240]
Isn't all that important.

[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.220]
But this one would make an exception because well, there's a whole bunch of reasons.

[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.400]
First of all, like little Georgia looks like it's going to hold up our end, I think, in midday.

[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.640]
Of course, along with the mad dog in that two to three hour.

[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:08.040]
Mad dog seems to be giving a good helping hand to the Humper who's on what about 20 minutes a week?

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.940]
Huh? Don't exaggerate.

[00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:13.440]
I didn't say that because today is mad dogs out today.

[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.140]
The big is on two to four.

[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.600]
We apologize for that ahead of time.

[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.160]
And the Humper is on for three hours.

[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.060]
And so he's he's getting in a full days work today, three hours.

[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.680]
So we got that element of it.

[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:29.140]
And then of course, the morning show, that's where the real pressure is going to come down.

[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.920]
Now we're not going to have the hour by hour because that doesn't come out the first day.

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.860]
Georgia will have that on Monday when I'll be on vacation.

[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.220]
Georgia will have all the, it'll be on the website too.

[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.280]
And it'll be on our website.

[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:41.920]
So some people can read it and weep.

[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.300]
Absolutely.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.860]
You know what I mean? Read it and weep.

[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.280]
Absolutely.

[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.160]
Read that breakdown of six to 10 a.m. and read those six to eight numbers and weep.

[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.260]
And then see the eight to 10 numbers and say,

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.220]
Oh, right. Look at that.

[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.020]
For else, kick an ass and six to eight.

[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.780]
Now disaster.

[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:55.520]
Absolutely.

[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:59.020]
I already predicted just like I predicted in Marlon's win and all these games and everything else.

[00:10:59.240 --> 00:10:59.560]
Absolutely.

[00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.360]
It's going to be a disaster.

[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.700]
By the way, it's got to hate to break the news to you. Yankees going down.

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.400]
I don't think so.

[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.700]
The Yankees are going down.

[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:06.800]
I can smell it.

[00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.680]
I can smell it all.

[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.220]
I can smell Bob Shepard's bag all the way up here.

[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:10.820]
I have to agree.

[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.880]
Bob Shepard's just turned 125.

[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.000]
What's heard from Bob?

[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.120]
Happy birthday, Bob.

[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.180]
Number nine.

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.740]
Hank Bauer.

[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:20.960]
Number nine.

[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.980]
What number did Hank Bauer wear?

[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.180]
Yeah.

[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.080]
Oh, thanks, Robert.

[00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:29.260]
Good to be surrounded by sports experts like Scott and Robert Creeper.

[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.920]
They know they're crap.

[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.220]
From minutes after 10 already at 560 WQM, you see how it's zipping right along?

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:36.780]
Oh, yeah.

[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:48.500]
I don't know.

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.500]

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.500]

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.500]

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:48.540]
I don't know.

[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:48.580]
I don't know.

[00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:48.680]
I don't know.

[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:48.680]

[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.340]
I don't know.

[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.600]
I don't know.

[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:51.940]
I don't know.

[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.280]
I don't know.

[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.240]
I don't know.

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.240]

[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.560]
I don't know.

[00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.140]
I don't know.

[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:57.600]
I don't know.

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.020]
I don't know.

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.020]

[00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.420]
I don't know.

[00:11:59.200 --> 00:11:59.580]
I don't know.

[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:00.100]
I don't know.

I don't know.

[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.140]
I don't know.

[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.620]
I don't know.

[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:03.980]
I don't know.

I don't know.

I don't know.

[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:06.760]
I don't know.

[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.000]
I don't know.

[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.460]
I don't know.

[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:15.460]

[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:15.460]

[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.940]
I don't know.

[00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:17.300]
I don't know.

[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.200]
I don't know.

[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.740]
I don't know.

[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.920]
I don't know.

[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.440]
I don't know.

[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:25.680]
I don't know.

[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.360]
I don't know.

[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:27.700]
I don't know.

[00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:28.400]
I don't know.

[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:28.700]
I don't know.

[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:28.820]
I don't know.

[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:28.820]

[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:29.900]
I don't know.

[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.360]
I don't know.

[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.140]
I don't know.

[00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:31.360]
I don't know.

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.460]
I don't know.

[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:32.500]
I don't know.

[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:32.680]
I don't know.

[00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:33.320]
I don't know.

[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:33.660]
I don't know.

[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.660]

[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:33.920]
I don't know.

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.740]
I don't know.

[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:45.240]
I don't know.

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.240]

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.240]

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.240]

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.240]

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.840]
I don't know.

[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.580]
I don't know.

[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:47.960]
I don't know.

[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:48.480]
I don't know.

[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:50.220]
I don't know.

[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:50.740]
I don't know.

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:52.280]
I don't know.

[00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.740]
I don't know.

[00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:54.320]
I don't know.

[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.100]
I don't know.

[00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:55.300]
I don't know.

[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.960]
I don't know.

[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.280]
I don't know.

[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:57.660]
I don't know.

[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:58.280]
I don't know.

[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:58.700]
I don't know.

[00:12:59.160 --> 00:12:59.780]
I don't know.

[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.140]
I don't know.

[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.440]
I don't know.

[00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:01.400]
I don't know.

[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:02.120]
I don't know.

[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:05.760]
I don't know.

[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:06.120]
I don't know.

[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.720]
I don't know.

[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.360]
I don't know.

[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:14.880]
I don't know.

[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:15.920]
I don't know.

[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.320]
I don't know.

[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:16.320]

[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.420]
I don't know.

[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.360]
I don't know.

[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.140]
I don't know.

[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:21.880]

[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:22.560]
I don't know.

[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:22.700]
I don't know.

[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.320]

[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.700]
I don't know.

[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.220]
I don't know.

[00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:25.340]
I don't know.

[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.800]
I don't know.

[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.340]
I don't know.

[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:28.720]
I don't know.

[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.840]
I don't know.

[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.540]
I don't know.

[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:30.920]
I don't know.

[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.500]
I don't know.

[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.040]
I don't know.

[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:32.520]
I don't know.

[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.640]
I don't know.

[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:34.660]
I don't know.

[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:35.720]
I don't know.

[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.160]
I don't know.

[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:36.660]
I don't know.

[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:37.560]
You never write to do that.

[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:38.520]
You never write to do that.

[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:39.780]
They were Aqua.

[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:39.920]

[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:40.220]
I don't know.

[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.120]
I don't know.

[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:44.680]
I don't know.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.800]
I don't know.

[00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.140]
I don't know.

[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.400]
You see in many綠絲 throwing

[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:51.680]
You see in many綠絲 throwing

[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:51.680]

[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.020]
Who played Barbie in the band's famous

[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:53.540]
And電視節目

[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.200]
And电視節目

[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.640]
And電視節目

[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:09.380]
Grammy. Wonder what that award ceremony was like.

[00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:12.080]
And Dinvina is...

[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:13.440]
Aqua.

[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:15.040]
Thank you!

[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.460]
But winning the late-mask for an award is not all Aqua is known for. They were also sued

[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:26.780]
by American Toymaker Mattel, who owns the Barbie trademark. Mattel spoke to us through

[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:27.200]
an interpreter.

[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:35.800]
Okay, he thinks those... how... how... he thinks they... things up with their... those...

[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.160]
Aqua. Barbie is ours.

[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.720]
You Aqua.

[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:45.300]
But Mattel lost the case. A victory for Aqua. They spoke to us through an interpreter.

[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.280]
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya.

[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.840]
I believe that's... Nya, nya, nya, nya.

[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:51.200]
Aqua.

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.180]
Those wacky Danish. Do they even know we named a breakfast food after them?

[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:56.420]
No.

[00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.340]
It's a big, juicy, stopping red-looking show business.

[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.200]
Tonight, an insider behind.

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.340]
Ten, eighteen, and five, sixty. WQM on a very gigantic, humongous Thursday. What a day.

[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.540]
A little to be realized there was going to be such a significant day all the way around.

[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.660]
And I would think that probably Clarence is digging up some world series tickets for our

[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.620]
loyal audience right now.

[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:18.000]
Especially, if you're getting slightly with that banner with the ball game on Sunday.

[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.180]
Wouldn't you think?

[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.220]
They had like Mo on there.

[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:21.720]
Absolutely.

[00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:26.320]
And Mad Dog and Hank and Eddie Kay and Joe and Mark and the big...

[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.480]
Oh!

[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.660]
And Kim Bo camper and everybody was ever born.

[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.400]
Every sports nerd that ever came down to Pike.

[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.560]
They even had the names of dead people on there.

[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.800]
John Moynihan was on there.

[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.640]
At Berliner.

[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.220]
At Berliner was on.

[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.440]
Dave Lamont.

[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.640]
Lamont Cranston.

[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.760]
They were all on there.

[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.440]
Were we on there?

[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.720]
No.

[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.440]
No, on a banner.

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.340]
Because they're embarrassed.

[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.960]
They don't want... They don't want to have the sixty-five thousand people sitting there.

[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.880]
God forbid we should promote the Nya Roger show.

[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.460]
Because that would be bad.

[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.780]
Because he says bad things about Greg even though they're all true.

[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:52.360]
Hey, Greg.

[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.040]
That's for Boss' Day.

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:55.720]
BAM!

[00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.920]
And don't bother me for Norm's number, no more, okay?

[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.120]
Hope you two have a great life together.

[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.380]
I think we got 1200 votes.

[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.040]
What does yours say?

[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.700]
I've been stalling there for a second.

[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.420]
That's a really long hang of it.

[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.140]
Mine's reloading and it says...

[00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:09.220]
1200 is on.

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:09.960]
1200?

[00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:10.560]
1200 one.

[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.320]
Anyway, yesterday we asked what was the greatest radio station in the history of South Florida.

[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.040]
We left out... I'm sorry, our problem's rise.

[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.000]
How could I be so dumb?

[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:18.560]
Am I dumb?

[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:19.240]
Yes.

[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:20.540]
WNWS.

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.380]
I mean, it only worked there for like six years.

[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.660]
That was the beginning of my glory.

[00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:26.240]
Those were the salad days, baby.

[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.080]
And the Emery-All-Bolt-Lith Days.

[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.980]
All of those things, all those death threats.

[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.620]
What was the... Is or was the greatest radio station in the history of South Florida?

[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.520]
WSHE, she's only rocket roll.

[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.480]
R-03.

[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.560]
To your old four now, it just moved ahead.

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.240]
W-I-O-D-279.

[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.080]
W-I-Q-A-M-145.

[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:46.740]
Ha-ha-ha.

[00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:47.840]
A week-turt.

[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.960]
A week-turt.

[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:49.680]
You turn.

[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.620]
That's not so good.

[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.120]
Aren't you embarrassed by that?

[00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:56.260]
See, part of the reason for that being that it would take a lot of really old farts to

[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.800]
remember the first glory days of QA M back when Rick Shaw was on air and Jim Dunlamp

[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:01.400]
and all of them people.

[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:01.640]
Right.

[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.000]
Like they.

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:02.920]
Roby Young, huh?

[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.680]
I remember.

[00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.300]
Yeah, but you're an old fart, right?

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.500]
And of course me, I wasn't in town in those days, although I do have all the jingos.

[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.400]
We got all the jingos.

[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.120]
Anybody want to hear some old QA M jingos?

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.320]
No.

[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.760]
We could kill some time up till...

[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:18.580]
Up till rating time, one o'clock, with some old QA M jingos like...

[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:32.920]
WQA M or...

[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.160]
But we don't want to do that.

[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.920]
Because then we'd lose all the audience.

[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.360]
They don't give a crap about old jingos or even new jingos.

[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.280]
WEDR came in fourth.

[00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.800]
That's 99 jams.

[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:44.780]
They're jammed at baby.

[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.820]
111 votes for that hip-hop crap.

[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:49.400]
WZTA Zeta had 57.

[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.300]
So see, after the first four was like a big drop off.

[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:56.080]
Because the only great thing that was ever on Zeta was a certain morning show on there.

[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.260]
1987.

[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:00.740]
Other than that, Zeta blows and has for a long time.

[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:02.320]
Too much CCR, too much...

[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.000]
Me, Kimba.

[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.600]
And of course, too much Paul and Old Ron.

[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.600]
WGTR 40.

[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:09.780]
I don't know.

[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.580]
What ever happened?

[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.540]
Did the ratings tank?

[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.240]
What was the deal?

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.620]
Did they dump GTR?

[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.760]
That caused a certain amount of constipation in town.

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.020]
Oh, it's a very simple thing.

[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.400]
First of all, it was a Cox company and you know how bottom line oriented they are.

[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.060]
Oh, that's right.

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.100]
They had to pay Hermann and McBean some serious bucks.

[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.740]
They had talent that they had to pay on GTR besides Hermann and McBean.

[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:32.420]
And they copied the West Coast coast, if you recall, which was a cash cowed jukebox.

[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:32.640]
Right.

[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.080]
That's jukebox.

[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.280]
That's why they brought Bob Greenin.

[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.660]
He was the leader of the jukebox.

[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.480]
WCKO K102, which was a really heavy duty.

[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.900]
The really rocks, they hard, hard, hard rock.

[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.600]
It was really hard.

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.500]
36, but they had a crappy signal.

[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.100]
And like they got a call, they used to work there yesterday.

[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.440]
He said they sucked.

[00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:52.900]
He said the station was good, but the management was idiots.

[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:53.860]
He didn't know what the hell they were doing.

[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.300]
What else is new?

[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.200]
WBUS, the bus, the magic bus had 35 votes.

[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.680]
When I first came to town, the bus was one of the first FM.

[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.140]
It may have been, I don't know, maybe in the only FM station that anybody paid attention

[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:05.800]
to at that point.

[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:07.020]
1976.

[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:08.760]
Magic bus.

[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:09.460]
You know who worked there?

[00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.020]
W-H-Y-I, Y-100.

[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:13.520]
What?

[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.520]
33 votes.

[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.380]
Now, see the problem with this pool, it's a good pool, but there are various incarnations

[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:19.260]
of all of these stations.

[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:19.740]
Right.

[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.300]
Like W-Y-O-D went through several different things, and Y-100, two different periods of time,

[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.900]
and different people were there, like Samwood Zeta.

[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.460]
Y-133 votes, probably mostly for your friend Tanner.

[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:30.020]
What?

[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:31.460]
Certainly not for a footy.

[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:32.360]
Right, and the votes for a footy?

[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:32.560]
No.

[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.540]
Everybody hates footy.

[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.080]
He's an asshole.

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.660]
W-T-M-I.

[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:35.960]
What?

[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:35.960]

[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.660]
Cox and Kid Curry in them.

[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.420]
Cox was on Y-100?

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.000]
I thought he was.

[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:41.580]
Wasn't they all?

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:42.780]
I guess.

[00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.220]
Kid Curry was on Y-100?

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.420]
I thought they were all there together.

[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:46.060]
G-Michael.

[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:46.820]
Really?

[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:47.740]
Really?

[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.420]
I thought I thought.

[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:49.980]
Yeah, Jim really, too.

[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:50.500]
Jim really.

[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:59.040]
W-N-A-S-L.

[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:03.420]
Now again, you'd have to go way back to the Jerry Wissner with the kid stole his wig, his

[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.460]
hair piece, and a parking lot, and he had a nervous breakdown.

[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:09.940]
Those old time days at INZ, and then of course there was my thing there at INZ when we're

[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.160]
doing like Old fart radio.

[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.380]
And then in 1986, what I decided, hey, this is boring.

[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:15.920]
Let's do something more interesting and exciting.

[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.280]
And we had a big, big book, 12 plus we had up here.

[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:19.720]
Yeah, sure.

[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.460]
You ready for that 12 plus?

[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:25.820]
In the younger demographics, it was all like double digits, 15, 17.

[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.800]
So it was unbelievable.

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:27.600]
It was incredible.

[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.120]
Unbelievable.

[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:28.500]
Yeah.

[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.260]
And then they shipped me off the Zada, and then the rest of the history, and I'm saying

[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:32.520]
a...

[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.180]
Yeah, sure.

[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.180]
You know, we were playing that hurricane promo.

[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.700]
Have you noticed the voice sounds like Lancet or on there?

[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.680]
No, I don't notice our promos.

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:41.360]
Oh, I saw it.

[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:42.660]
W-N-Z-A-M-15.

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:46.700]
W-N-Z-F-M-I-95 had 14 with Earl de Poureau.

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.280]
I-95.

[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.700]
It was down to the bad station.

[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:52.800]
It was Rocky and Rolly.

[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:56.260]
I remember the night that they had all the teenagers come down scantily clad in their

[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:59.740]
underwear to give boys some concert tickets, and then somebody...

[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.140]
Some asshole listener called the cops.

[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.040]
There's always some asshole out there in Radio Land.

[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.600]
Always, no matter what's going on, there's always one sour, really hostile asshole.

[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.320]
I'm gonna call the cops.

[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.100]
They got a bunch of teenagers running around almost naked, yeah?

[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.320]
I think whoever it was probably was jealous.

[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:19.560]
There were some pretty damn interesting people in there too.

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.580]
Anyway, Waxi FM-13 back in the golden days of Waxi when Ricky Tiki-Shaw was there acting

[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:27.420]
like a Nazi and Ricken Suz.

[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.000]
Greg Piedel.

[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:32.440]
That's I think when they started going downhill is when Biedel came in.

[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.640]
Am I right?

[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:36.700]
He destroyed it.

[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:36.960]
I wouldn't know.

[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.360]
Every place he went, he destroyed it.

[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.000]
Love 94.

[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.360]
Waxi?

[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.340]
I'll tell you, you sure got a lot of press for a guy that had to have failed so badly

[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:45.060]
everywhere he went.

[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.040]
He did very well, though.

[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.720]
I understand if they sterling country kitchen.

[00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:50.600]
By the way, Troy Stradford, we have no copy for Brandy Shoeon.

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.860]
I just noticed at the corner of my eye, it's the 62nd away from that spot.

[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.140]
You idiot, you simple.

[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.200]
What is wrong with him?

[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.180]
I think Todd Dreckad took him under his wing.

[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.200]
Waxi FM-11-13.

[00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:03.880]
11 for WVUM.

[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.040]
WVUM, it's Microsynthol.

[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.980]
The hurricanes are going to win again.

[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.040]
You made a mistake on Microsynthol.

[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.100]
WCJX-96X, I'm sure that's the station of law's license for phony contest.

[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.540]
11.

[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.760]
WKPX, Piper Hyad 10.

[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:21.060]
I'm embarrassed that WUM had one more vote than KPX.

[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.900]
What's wrong with you people?

[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.520]
W probably Robert Greeper voted several times.

[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.460]
And also who else we got?

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:26.500]
That's a her own clearance.

[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.900]
Another hurricane alumnus.

[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.080]
WMX and the Beast probably voted three or four times.

[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:35.560]
MXJ8, KISS-7, 98 Gold-6.

[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.980]
How about, oh, you know what we left off for here?

[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.820]
How about WGBS, Ken Maldon's never going to speak to me again.

[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:44.440]
We left off WNWS and WGBS, Arnie Warren.

[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.000]
He was terrible.

[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.060]
I guess we got to do it again.

[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:47.400]
Hey, let's do it again.

[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.220]
WRMF-5, Love 95.

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.180]
Love 94 had five or Love 95 had four.

[00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:55.300]
Surf had four, WS RF, probably for Jack Mark.

[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.240]
WA1A, your music weight, Helen Anderson four.

[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:05.800]
WHQT, Hot 105, 3WKAT, 3KAT, WCKR had two and I have no idea why.

[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.020]
Life had one, WRBD, Rock and Big Daddy had one.

[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:12.640]
And WGMA in Hollywood, Country, Kick and Asht, look at, look at,

[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.320]
Jerry Woods knew that had one vote.

[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.980]
So that's it out of over 1200 votes.

[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.720]
I thought it was kind of interesting.

[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.000]
Today we're doing this, Jockeys.

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.860]
Well, maybe you are.

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.200]
No, I'm not saying anybody, I can think of.

[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.240]
How's WBD doing, by the way?

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.760]
27 past 11 at 5 at the past noon, at 560 WQM.

[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.200]
It's almost time for those ratings to come out.

[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.040]
It's 1227.

[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.920]
Let me tell you, time is really flying at Brandy's too,

[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.780]
because they've been around in town for over 25 years.

[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.140]
I guarantee they got some big special sale going on this week.

[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:41.300]
But twice dreadford is just laid out.

[00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:44.260]
He's just not interested in doing his thing and servicing his account.

[00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.700]
So as usual, we just have to kind of like wing it.

[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:48.260]
So I don't know what the special sale is.

[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.380]
You can find out what it is by going on their website,

[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:52.560]
Brandy's shoes.com and I guarantee you,

[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.280]
you get more information than Troy ever gives me.

[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.320]
Brandy's got all the top names in his shoe,

[00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.560]
businesses, what they still around after all these years.

[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:02.420]
They got Floreshime, SAS, Clarks, Clark Kent's,

[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:05.140]
Timberlin, Mifisto, Rockport, Echoes, they got them all.

[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.460]
And speaking of Clark Kent, they got big fat shoes

[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.700]
and little teeny tiny one, whether your feet are petite

[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:11.340]
or a big enough to eat, they got them all.

[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.280]
Men size 6 to 15, women's 5 to 12,

[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.040]
very narrow to the very, very wide.

[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.680]
And no matter what you're looking for in a gigantic,

[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.840]
8,000 square foot megastore, you can just about

[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.500]

[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.200]
Brandy's shoes, you'll find them at 12,

[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:26.920]
90 North Federal Highway, Palm Pano Beach,

[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.000]
Open Daily, 9 to 9,

you can check them out on the web too at brandy's shoes.com.

[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:36.320]
Brandy's shoes.com

[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.340]
We are Sports Radio 560, QAM.

[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.940]
What you to take your head out of your own ass?

[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.440]
Okay.

[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.320]
And days from walking down the aisle

[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.120]
This is up inside your sand nose

[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.900]
With any transit, temperature, you see

[00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.840]
I'm here to it, Bentley, and say,

[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:01.920]
I'm out of your soul, I'm gay, no.

[00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:05.780]
No matter what you find yourself, another stroll.

[00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:07.280]
Brandy said,

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.480]
Hi, I'm two to five.

[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.160]
Welcome.

[00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.540]
And she went up and off,

[00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.940]
a screaming, and as if you're the way,

[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.660]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:24.680]
You grabbed the flight to Vegas,

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.600]
and hit all the strip clubs.

[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.440]
Girls were craving just nicely,

[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:32.860]
we're given better life,

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.660]
since he was hotter than the freaking cold.

[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:37.340]
Brandy said,

[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:39.480]
Hi, I'm two to five.

[00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.340]
And she went up and off,

[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.720]
a screaming, and as if you drove away,

[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.760]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.700]
From the time they made a jersey,

[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.220]
they stayed in her home.

[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.020]
I was standing here,

[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.500]
the couple was touching,

[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:03.320]
and she really went,

[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.040]
the whole mess was a big damn bomb.

[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:08.040]
They don't have to go,

[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.360]
you're back.com,

[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.260]
missing back to the bus.

[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:14.560]
Back, back, back, go, back, go.

[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.120]
And she went off and off,

[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:21.380]
a screaming, and as if you drove away,

[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.340]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.460]
33 at five, 60 at W.C.

[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:26.660]
I'm just,

[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.520]
anybody care about those losers anymore?

[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:28.760]
No.

[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.360]
No, even the cubs we don't care about,

[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:30.700]
no more.

[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:33.380]
Now this facts from Larry,

[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:34.940]
I guess we should do the poll for today.

[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.540]
Let's introduce it.

[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.460]
Is it one o'clock yet?

[00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:39.260]
Damn it.

[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.520]
It's getting close though.

[00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.620]
It's already 10.33,

[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.960]
and pretty soon it'll be 10.34,

[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.400]
and then you know what happens after that?

[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:45.100]
No.

[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.020]
10.35 is most still alive.

[00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:47.340]
No.

[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.960]
Who is or was your favorite,

[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.420]
since we did the radio stations yesterday,

[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.660]
it's a good segue, I would say.

[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.760]
Who is or was your favorite,

[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:55.920]
radio disc jockey,

[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:57.540]
not talk to your host of all time?

[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.880]
See, the reason I put that in

[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:17.040]
the radio,

[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:24.180]
is because I'm not talking to you.

[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.060]
Oh, how about, how about,

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.060]

[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:25.060]

[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.280]
and there was a dialing error, so it comes across twice,

[00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:57.780]
that's why.

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.620]
I see.

[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.120]
By the way, clearance, your real bonehead, man, okay?

[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.920]
clearance is going to start having a bone through his nose.

[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.320]
Of course, be sitting here to bone,

[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.360]
well, let's be starting to point.

[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:10.200]
You don't want to kiss my drip, like,

[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.880]
who is or was your favorite radio dish jockey,

[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.600]
not talk shows of all time?

[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.320]
I mean, we just got a few votes on here,

[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.980]
because obviously most of the people listening,

[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.720]
don't have their choice on or yet.

[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.760]
Wolfman, Jackie, right, those got eight out of 13.

[00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.260]
Ricky Tiki-Schroes got two.

[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.700]
W-A-Q-A-M.

[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:32.520]
Yeah, hello, good morning.

[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.660]
Yes, sir, what is this?

[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:35.140]
Scott Mune.

[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:36.380]
You know Scott Mune?

[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.460]
Pune Scott Mune, W-A-B-C,

[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:39.680]
all over in New York, everywhere.

[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:41.300]
I W-A-W-N-W, that's correct, sir.

[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:42.100]
That is correct.

[00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:42.640]
Thank you, sir.

[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:43.900]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:44.980]
All right, calm down.

[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.520]
Pune Scott Mune.

[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:51.160]
Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely,

[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.500]
absolutely correct, sir.

[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.360]
Pune Scott Mune, W-A-B-C.

[00:38:57.660 --> 00:38:58.220]
Remember Scott Mune?

[00:38:58.540 --> 00:38:58.780]
No.

[00:38:59.140 --> 00:38:59.300]
Yes.

[00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:02.200]
Scott does, because he lived in that, in the vicinity.

[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.120]
That demography.

[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.020]
Yeah, I can't say demographic.

[00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:06.000]
Scott Mune.

[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:08.060]
See, we get some real names on here.

[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:08.860]
There won't have some votes.

[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180]
W-A-Q-A-B-A.

[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.600]
Oh, yes, sir.

[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.160]
Hey, I got a DJ for you.

[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:14.840]
Okay.

[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.320]
DJ Disturbing.

[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:23.120]
I never heard of him.

[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.720]
Is it one yet?

[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.100]
W-A-Q-A-M.

[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:29.700]
Can I have the keynote?

[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:30.760]
Q-B-A.

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.120]
Speaking, we're doing screenless, man.

[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:32.820]
Let's get with it.

[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:33.780]
How you doing, Neil?

[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:34.440]
Okay.

[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.340]
Listen, how about the morning, baby?

[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.060]
Wait on the one, baby.

[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:41.780]
Yeah.

[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.980]
So, what is that?

[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.360]
He won the tickets.

[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:49.880]
Yeah, he won the two bad.

[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.700]
I already cut him off.

[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:50.960]
Damn it.

[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.760]
I was going to give you tickets for all three games.

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:53.560]
Damn it.

[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.740]
Well, try calling back.

[00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.180]
5'6, 7'5, 60, £5, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.540]
How about the mornings, baby?

[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:02.640]
I'm on the bandwagon.

[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:04.180]
Hey, bye to go, Marlon.

[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:07.860]
You know, Pudge Red Rigg is not only one of the MVP for the series,

[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.320]
but he also won the MVP for most times

[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.900]
putting it to Sky and Crossing himself,

[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:12.860]
which I was very proud of that.

[00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.260]
He eats Sammy after that.

[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.360]
How many times in anything?

[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.240]
About third man.

[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:16.500]
Yeah.

[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.080]
Even eats Sammy's Sosa, and also who are remearsed as it'll odd too.

[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.560]
Won't be seeing him no more though.

[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.360]
I'm sick and tired of that crap.

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:26.480]
I'll tell you that right now that pointing at the sky.

[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.180]
You know, just cut the crap already.

[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.320]
Okay, if you want to believe in furry tails and the tooth furry,

[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:31.100]
go right ahead.

[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:32.460]
Look under the pillow and see what's it.

[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.240]
God likes the whole set.

[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.680]
I will say Pudge still looks pretty good.

[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.920]
He even knows he got that big fat ass.

[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:36.480]
He looks good.

[00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:38.060]
Now, let's see.

[00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:39.200]
Do we have the...

[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:39.780]
What is this?

[00:40:40.900 --> 00:40:42.980]
We don't have any baseball on tonight?

[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:44.760]
No.

[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.120]
I don't know.

[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:45.600]
I didn't read it.

[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.200]
I just passed it.

[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:46.880]
Well, why not?

[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.040]
God doesn't do me.

[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.320]
What is this all about?

[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.260]
I thought we were your sports intensive station.

[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:53.640]
I'm promoting the game as an A20.

[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.520]
And the revised schedule shows Noah Boston in the Yankee game.

[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:02.120]
Well, what kind of a communist pile of crap is that for young girls, huh?

[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.360]
Just when we were starting to kick a little bit of ass,

[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:07.660]
they pulled the Yankee right from underneath us in a rug too.

[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.920]
I'll be God damn less because we got to get that hurricane hotline in from Tony Romans because it's sponsored.

[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.320]
And certainly we got to get the Ricky William show on, don't we?

[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:16.440]
No.

[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.700]
Who the hell wants to hear that crap?

[00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:20.640]
Dan LaBaster just tongueing and licking and rimming.

[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.000]
God, it's disgusting.

[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.220]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.060]
So that's the schedule.

[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.040]
No baseball tonight.

[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.440]
I guess somebody else will probably pick it up.

[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.780]
And we'll be sucking wind.

[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.760]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:33.860]
You guys have tickets?

[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:35.520]
I beg your pardon?

[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.220]
You guys have tickets?

[00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.480]
Do we have tickets?

[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:39.560]
Yes, speaking tickets.

[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:39.780]

[00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.540]
Yeah, 100 on the 55.

[00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:42.940]
You want to pay?

[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.500]
I said, have a nice day, bitch.

[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:46.400]
Fine.

[00:41:46.540 --> 00:41:47.260]
You guys have tickets?

[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:48.620]
You guys have tickets?

[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.760]
Oh, man.

[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.400]
She couldn't give a flying fart about the Marlins until right now.

[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.180]
You're into that even bit Scott's life on it.

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.160]
No chance.

[00:41:58.020 --> 00:42:00.580]
Oh, do you want security counsel to prove your rac resolution unanimously?

[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.920]
They said, let's go in there.

[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.520]
Let's see what we can do to straighten out your mess.

[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.920]
Some agreement on a rac resolution.

[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.300]
It's a recognition by countries like Russia, who you see right now.

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:09.020]
That it's a mess.

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:12.080]
And you guys have tickets?

[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.400]
W-Q-A-M.

[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:13.620]
Hello.

[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.280]
Hey, Neil.

[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.080]
Yes, sir.

[00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:18.480]
I would love to get a parent ticket.

[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.420]
It isn't possible to get through to ticket master to get tickets.

[00:42:21.620 --> 00:42:23.580]
I have been in a camp since 93.

[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.620]
Yeah, so what do you want me to do about it?

[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:27.480]
You said you had some tickets.

[00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:28.180]
What?

[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.740]
You said you had some tickets.

[00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.280]
Yeah, I got my tickets.

[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:31.840]
I got mine.

[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.540]
You're not getting them.

[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.500]
Okay, I'm selling them on eBay.

[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.620]
Okay, if you want to go on eBay and see if you got five grand a piece, 20 grand a piece.

[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.760]
What's your free loading phone?

[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.400]
He's free loading, front running and free loading phone.

[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.740]
I love it.

[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.760]
Last season, man, you can, in earlier this season, George couldn't give them Arlen tickets away.

[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.780]
There were people coming to appear.

[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:49.920]
He's got one to say to the Indian.

[00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:50.320]
Give it to him.

[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.720]
Bring in their tickets and say, hey, give these away.

[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.340]
We don't want them.

[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:54.600]
We don't want them.

[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.700]
This is going to have them.

[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:56.860]
They're too crappy for us.

[00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:57.760]
People think they're lying.

[00:42:57.860 --> 00:42:58.640]
Can we have tickets?

[00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.800]
And that's all they got to say.

[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:00.840]
They have nothing to say about you.

[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.460]
Hey, what a great job, Jack McKeehan and Pudge and Fudge and Jesh Beckett and all these guys.

[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:06.020]
Nothing.

[00:43:06.780 --> 00:43:07.140]
Nothing.

[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:07.940]
Zip it he do down.

[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.620]
In fact, they wouldn't know.

[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.100]
Most of these people want the tickets.

[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.880]
How many people, how many names on the team do you think they know?

[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:14.520]
Maybe two or three.

[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:15.060]
Maybe.

[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.240]
Right?

[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.340]
I know what Rodriguez.

[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:18.800]
There you go.

[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:21.660]
I don't know his first name.

[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.440]
And you left out Gonzalez.

[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.400]
There were two of them.

[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.200]
Oh, there's one.

[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:24.420]

[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:26.680]
WQAM.

[00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:28.660]
Neil.

[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:29.340]
Yes.

[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.560]
And now we need Jim Dunlap.

[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:31.920]
Jim Dunlap.

[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.180]
Okay.

[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.140]
Thank you, chronic lady.

[00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.180]
That's the most chronic of them all, boy.

[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.000]
She's really chronic.

[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:36.600]
But that's all right.

[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:38.340]
We even have Jingos for Jim Dunlap.

[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:40.180]
Can we have everyone?

[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.620]
No, I don't need to hear you one.

[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.700]
Jason Piger.

[00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:46.780]
Jim Dunlap.

[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:48.460]
What's the goal?

[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:51.520]
WQAM.

[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.160]
And we even have Samura.

[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.380]
And we're going to have the Oscar Pelos to build a short, huh?

[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.840]
Oh, just fire went on.

[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:02.960]
No, no, seriously.

[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:03.640]
We're going to have those.

[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.600]
We got them in here somewhere.

[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.840]
Just one moment please.

[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.820]
No, I want to play the Jim Dunlap one.

[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:09.340]
If we got it, I don't think we got it.

[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:09.340]

[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:09.640]
We got it.

[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.080]
We got it.

[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.860]
We have one for John Moynihan.

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:13.100]
John Moynihan.

[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:13.940]
Roseports.

[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:14.840]
Radio.

[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.260]
My 16 WQAM.

[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.080]
No, there's still aren't the ones.

[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.040]
I'm talking about the real short ones where they just say the name, you know?

[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:22.860]
Like.

[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.740]
The Florida Marlins.

[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:25.700]
There you go.

[00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.580]
How do you like that?

[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:26.920]
Oh.

[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.400]
Let's hear it for the Florida Marlins.

[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:29.780]
Oh.

[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:31.700]
The Florida Marlins.

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.400]
Oh.

[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.620]
The Florida Marlins.

[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:33.880]

[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:34.760]
All right.

[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.080]
The Florida Marlins.

[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.560]
Get it, Kaplan.

[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:39.240]
Get it.

[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.780]
Now, what was this Scott talking about for this morning about getting a casket for Radio

[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:42.940]
K.

[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:43.700]
What was that all about?

[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:44.820]
I don't know.

[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:45.000]
I don't know.

[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:45.480]
I don't know what it was into that crap.

[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:46.840]
To what crap?

[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:47.880]
Exactly.

[00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:51.360]
Now, when we did the crossover at 10 o'clock, you let's get a casket for Radio.

[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.240]
He's just incurring.

[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:54.300]
He just blurt out a lot of crap, which is why we love for real.

[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.480]
He just blurt it out.

[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:57.800]
Wait until he gets the hour by hours on Monday.

[00:44:57.940 --> 00:44:59.460]
He's going to be blurting them a lot and then mosegum.

[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.040]
Oh, well, it must be an aberration because we're following that low rated joy and mark show

[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.620]
and they shove this back into the middle of the night.

[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.160]
And that pipe smoker keeps making all those comments about me.

[00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:09.540]
And then those key chains, I should never go along with that crap.

[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:10.560]
Yeah.

[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:13.560]
Don't forget, new into two today, Miguel.

[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.220]
Pingo.

[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:15.960]
Pino, Tile and Carpet.

[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.160]
2101 West Atlantic Boulevard in Pompo, and I'll look for the QA and Van and bring a lot of cash.

[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:20.600]
Okay?

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.000]
Speaking of Marlon tickets, World Series tickets.

[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.280]
Ask Miguel.

[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.360]
Oh, poor Miguel.

[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.180]
Can I fix his ass?

[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.780]
That's what I want.

[00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:30.260]
Wow.

[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:31.940]
Can I fix him, but good.

[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.160]
He never speaking me again.

[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:34.200]
It won't come back.

[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.020]
He'd probably even be so busy.

[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.100]
Cut the renault.

[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:37.880]
Oh, okay.

[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:38.800]
Let's not do it that.

[00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.840]
Let me say very clearly, very succinctly, Miguel.

[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:43.460]
Probably doesn't have any real.

[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.340]
Oh, Jesus Christ.

[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:47.700]
But you know, he's in promotions, though.

[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.960]
So just maybe because he's such a good guy and he appreciates our fans so much.

[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:52.660]
He just might, you never know.

[00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.720]
It's worth going out there.

[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:54.980]
So where won't he be at the end?

[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.380]
And say, please, please, Miguel.

[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.320]
Please Miguel, who looks almost as good as Miguel on passions, but not quite.

[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:04.600]
I guess Scott Jr. knows Miguel and all of her.

[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:05.660]
He was my phone ringing.

[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:06.800]
I beg your pardon?

[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:08.260]
Why is my phone ringing, I wonder?

[00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:08.940]
Is it really?

[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:09.320]
Yeah.

[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:10.300]
You're just joking.

[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:17.240]
He's listening right now, and Miguel isn't going to, well, I'm not positive, but I don't think he's going to have any World Series tickets out there today.

[00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.280]
But you don't know unless he asked.

[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:27.080]
1056 and 560 WQM, if you're underpaid, if you're overworked, if you're underappreciated, get out of your dead end job.

[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:28.320]

[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:28.860]

We're sports radio 560.

[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.400]
So it's UAM.

[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:22.620]
Florida, Marlin.

[00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.100]
The Florida, Marlin.

[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.540]
The Florida, Marlin.

[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:34.140]
Hi, this is Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News with a one-on-one interview with gubernatorial hopeful Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:34.980]
I'm sorry.

[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.140]
Excuse me.

[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:37.180]
I apologize.

[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.860]
What do you apologize for? I'm not following you.

[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.060]
For everything, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News, I'm sorry to the people of California.

[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.080]
For what? Those bad movies you make?

[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:52.080]
No. Although, if you don't like them, I'm sorry, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News.

[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.560]
I'm sorry for this.

[00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.860]
You just touched my booby.

[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.840]
That was a demonstration, Kimberly Plummer. I'm sorry.

[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.120]
Well, don't do your demonstrations on me, Mr. Schwarzenegger.

[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.580]
I am here for a serious interview with you.

[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:08.080]
I apologize. You're very whiny.

[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.920]
Boy, hey, with your question. Well, you're very touchy-feeling.

[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:11.680]
I apologize.

[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:16.940]
Oh! Excuse me. But did you just touch my ass?

[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.080]
That was a demonstration, Kimberly Plummer, K-ABC News.

[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.800]
That's why I want to apologize to the people of California.

[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.160]
And I believe you should. I'm sorry.

[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.500]
I see you have a problem with women.

[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.160]
I don't have a problem with women. I like to touch them.

[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.340]
Excuse me, but we are not an object.

[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:33.860]
May I see your aunt, either?

[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.120]
It's my what?

[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.000]
Your aunt, either. May I see it?

[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.380]
I don't think I have an aunt, either.

[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.700]
You have an aunt, either. That's right, you.

[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.360]
That's your aunt, either.

[00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.600]
I can't believe you just put your hand.

[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.520]
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, are you pilots?

[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:50.020]
Oh! Do it again.

[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.420]
Yeah. Good for you, Kimberly Plummer.

[00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.880]
You want me now, don't you?

[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:54.400]
Europe.

[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:56.320]
Let us have your aunt, either.

[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:57.200]
Oh!

[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.440]
I love you.

[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.240]
I'm sorry. I apologize.

[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.060]
You are disgusting.

[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.260]
I want to be the governor.

[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.680]
Here, pull my lever, vote for me.

[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.740]
Ew. Why is it purple?

[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.520]
I eat grapes. I'm a grape, either.

[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:15.780]
Pull my lever.

[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.560]
11.02 at 5.60 W.N.E.

[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.020]
Two hours away from that big summer book, man.

[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:24.120]
There's enormous pressure. In fact, my irritable bowel is acting up again just because of it.

[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.520]
So here's a good choice for our poll from Rick, who says, and I would hardly agree, is one of the best ever.

[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.340]
Greatest DJ ever, Bill Bailey from W.A.K.Y. in Louisville.

[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:33.780]
Ready for that?

[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:34.580]
Whatever.

[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:37.560]
I'm just stalling until this thing starts playing.

[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:38.220]
Oh, you ready for that?

[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:39.160]
No.

[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:45.600]
The first thing I heard this morning from my radio was your introduction to your 20 before the hour sports report.

[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:49.100]
Mr. Yaden, that's your reason why I was a little bit late this morning.

[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.340]
I had a way I wanted to mention this morning, I plan to make this two or three times.

[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:59.980]
That Thursday night, I'm going to have a series of softball games out here at St. Helensfield and lively, shyly.

[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:06.580]
Now the press game at 7 o'clock will be between Alan Hamilton and his deputy sheriffs.

[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:08.600]
And the work that city was great.

[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:13.380]
Bill Bailey went to W.A.K.Y. in Chicago and did mornings for about five minutes and bombed for whatever reason.

[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.100]
I don't know why they just didn't take to him.

[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:18.440]
While they were probably still sore about the covers loose near the air.

[00:50:18.500 --> 00:50:20.240]
You know, and if you think they were pissed off then just wait.

[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:21.100]
You ain't see nothing yet.

[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:24.900]
Bill Bailey and him to the list, please, said,

[00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:28.340]
400-pound man rescued after he plunges through Flora Mobile Home.

[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:34.940]
But I did not see the CBS two last night, but I do have the story here from CBS News for a little bit later on when we have some good time to kill.

[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.560]
About Colin Powell being a freaking liar.

[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.040]
But beside that, Newport Richie from Borsehead.

[00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:48.020]
A Pasco County man who became trapped in his mobile home on the floor gave winter, was rescued by emergency workers.

[00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:53.360]
The manager of the mobile home park found the man who reportedly weighed 400 pounds yesterday.

[00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.320]
What's your weight today?

[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.900]
About 320.

[00:50:58.180 --> 00:51:03.500]
There he was in that little bedroom sitting in a little hole, said Jean Morton of Orangewood Lakes Mobile Home Community.

[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:10.260]
Morton identified the man as George Daniels, 61 city fondaniels conscious but disoriented, sitting with his head bowed.

[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:12.280]
Maybe he was just checking out lunch.

[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.740]
Morton said Daniels told him he had been sick for two days.

[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.940]
Been stuck for two days.

[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.580]
The emergency responders weren't so sure.

[00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:23.600]
They would ask him one time and he'd say a day and then he'd say that an hour a day he was a little confused.

[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.680]
Maybe he was going through a hunger withdrawal.

[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:32.400]
The floorboards in his home may have rot underneath the carpet Morton, said he called 911 after getting caught from one of the man's neighbors.

[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:36.820]
And why am I reading this? This is one of the most horrible stories ever read. Why am I reading that?

[00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:37.440]
I think it's funny.

[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:38.360]
Do you?

[00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:42.640]
Yeah. About a 400 pound guy getting stuck into floorboards in some mobile home park.

[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.800]
The manager should have sold tickets.

[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:44.940]
Shame on you.

[00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:48.360]
You know what I should have done when I'd build Bailey thing which I'm not too bright.

[00:51:50.420 --> 00:52:00.100]
What I should have done was just got my cursor on the little dot there and moved ahead a little bit because that was obviously a really ponderous thing there.

[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:06.120]
36, 24 minutes before seven o'clock at WAKY. Good morning Bell Bailey.

[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:08.540]
That's cool.

[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:10.040]
You catch that line.

[00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.660]
But forgets best of me.

[00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:16.280]
You see he substituted for the ailing chimulo this morning he says to me.

[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.300]
Boy, I wish you had stayed home.

[00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:19.560]
I could have worked an hour.

[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.240]
Why didn't he call me at home and tell me that instead of waiting until I showed up here.

[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.540]
But I couldn't use it.

[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.760]
I would have been happy to stay at home until seven.

[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.480]
23 before seven o'clock at WAKY.

[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.240]
I love being so nice to be with you.

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:36.880]
Great.

[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.280]
Bill Bailey was outstanding.

[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.320]
He was one of a kind.

[00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:39.840]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:40.300]
No.

[00:52:40.880 --> 00:52:41.240]
Original.

[00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.580]
Not these cookie cutter assholes that we got now.

[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.600]
It's 79, along the coast.

[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:48.120]
We're not talking about you Johnny.

[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.720]
Dark ol' or you were really good on the coast.

[00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.200]
You fit in perfect with that.

[00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:52.480]
Johnny's a good guy.

[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:53.080]
He just bland.

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:53.580]
You know what I mean?

[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:54.160]
Uh-huh.

[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:55.060]
He's just bland.

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.840]
He's got a great voice.

[00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:56.660]
He's boring though.

[00:52:56.700 --> 00:52:57.200]
He's very bland.

[00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:59.180]
As we discovered when he came in sucking out free lunches.

[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.300]
Remember that day he showed up.

[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:00.940]
I'm sure you're doing.

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.880]
I had to make them chase him away.

[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:03.700]
Yes.

[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:05.120]
That was embarrassing.

[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:06.680]
Why don't people do things like that?

[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:07.600]
I wouldn't show up.

[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:08.600]
I didn't fight it.

[00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:11.740]
Which I wouldn't have minded feeding him a free lunch.

[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:14.440]

[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.440]
Well see the rest of these will all be split up.

[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.540]
Well, Wolfman Jack was never in Florida.

[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:41.940]
Was he?

[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.420]
No, but nevertheless it's all name recognition with these people.

[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:44.660]

[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.200]
Because the other ones are all like a parochial.

[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:52.320]
They're like local people and if you were like from Chicago you knew well Larry Lou Jack and the other people will probably be on it.

I mean he was like a great personality like a dick Burton.

[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.140]
He then had like some creative wild show with all those people.

[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:48.060]
But he was pretty good.

[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:48.900]

And offers you an incredible big fat one, a quarter pound hot dog.

[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:50.080]
What makes Vickoners so different from anybody else in town is that the burger's dogs are all served with Vick's signature meat sauce poured on top giving you a wild, unbelievable, erotic combination of flavors in your push.

[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.800]
Hi, howie get him on here

[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:15.200]
5 6 7 0 5 6 2 we got an hour and 44 minutes to go until 1 o'clock

[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.360]
It's just a countdown. It's like New Year's Eve or countdown

[01:01:17.360 --> 01:01:20.020]
I'm not gonna spell any of these names right okay. I don't care

[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:24.720]
Here's the facts from J.O. Since I applaud you greatly for your effort to abandon per rescue hubbers

[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.020]
Since it's two of the all employees and listeners a qum would rather be skinned head to toe and dipped into a bath

[01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:32.060]
Advancative rather than have a slight fondness toward the moman

[01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:37.520]
Why would you be offering a portable product containing most idiotic phrases that can follow you everywhere you go?

[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.660]
Because it's funny that's why people shouldn't have to pay to have this keychain nevertheless

[01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:49.000]
I did purchase your CD strictly for the animals, but I many people would rather drown a cat themselves and have most voice trailing them around

[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:56.180]
See everybody's making an excuse it's why nobody wants to come through with a cache if you don't want the keychain or the CD

[01:01:56.180 --> 01:02:01.680]
That's okay. We'll take a check made out to abandon per rescue 10 bucks a hundred bucks 50 bucks 5,000 bucks whatever though

[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.960]
You're wrong. They're not making excuses. What does that mean? They're just not doing it. Yeah

[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:09.380]
Maybe next year you grew up with a combo of the Crow and the Humper I

[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:14.540]
Like Neel's pool or I'm a homo. Thanks is Jay a homo

[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:19.600]
Here's a future poll excluding big tobacco and alcohol which companies ran a killer customers the quickest

[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.480]

[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:39.380]
He was a DJ Tom like us. He no, he was not that's why I'm saying doesn't belong any

[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.180]
Maybe he was once upon a time who now knows no cares. He's an idiot

[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:47.640]
I'm not gonna tell that story for the evening and time okay freaking liar. He's a bull crap artist

[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:52.680]
He's a moron and he's a closet queen, but other than that he's great. He's a great town. Yeah

[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:58.160]
And he's got an awful awful black leather jacket. That's about three sizes too small

[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:03.640]

[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.340]
Another cheap shot just from some sour ass. Well probably it comes fan. Okay

[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:11.360]

[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.820]

Whatever you never already will go against bird. Oh, I mean I've heard you mentioned

[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:07.660]
How many times about adventure car hop and sagus mass on a way to rock in the park those are the days, baby and

[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:12.280]
People said well, you know, that's a hundred years ago. You know something see that's the bottom line

[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:13.380]
It's used to be a fun business

[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.120]
It used to be like a lot of really talented people you got that anymore

[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:21.300]
In fact, how many are contemporary disc jockeys do we have we got kid curry on there was still on the air and Rick

[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:26.580]
Shove's 100 years old other than that who we got on here was still on the air right right in fact

[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:29.600]
That's the big thing now is oh well. We don't have any disc jockeys

[01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:35.600]
Right, we have an ounce of right. We know we don't just we play music know this jockeys

[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:42.520]
So you can have a CD player and listen to a hell of a lot better select you can burn your own CDs and burn your own whatever you want to burn and

[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.920]
Have a lot better time in your car wherever you are with your own crab, huh?

[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:49.980]
Right if that's all you care about is the music because they've taken the entertainment out

[01:07:49.980 --> 01:07:53.560]
They've taken a personalities out. They've taken a guy them fun out of it

[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:57.840]
You bastards you a cheap channel on the if a CC should all croak

[01:07:59.280 --> 01:07:59.720]
WQAM

[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.220]
QAM

Nobody on the screen was suggested relax, okay?

[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:10.300]
I know it's a real shock to their system especially have to be it up drunk all last night

[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.300]
Celebrating the Marlon big victory

[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:16.340]

[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.020]
No, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry

[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:35.280]
I'm real sorry to WQAM

[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.320]
Hey, you know, I know buddy. Okay, palmy. I'm calling up to disagree with you

[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:42.180]
I mean maybe he's changed year the years well

[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.920]
That's grown up bottom words of you see a LAM channel 60

[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:49.580]
At three o'clock we couldn't wait to turn Johnny. They are going man

[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.060]
I mean I'm talking about them in late 50 early 70s, you know

[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.820]
Was at the cent was that there was a minute a hundred different guys named Johnny dark is that the 10 Johnny there?

[01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:01.700]
Yeah, because then the wolf man Jack came on after heaven

[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:06.400]
But funny let me tell you a funny story about Johnny dark just two. I was like 13 years old

[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:10.020]
And I called them up and was a 13 caller with the prize

[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.700]
Why what a free dinner for my family and he was a guest too

[01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:16.560]
He came and this you know all these people showed up for some

[01:09:17.180 --> 01:09:22.380]
Cookware company and they came in with all these positive pants and they cooked it of me with my house

[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:27.560]
And I finally won a $150 of the cookware from it was a funny story

[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.640]
I did it to cover one of my life on the radio

[01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:38.100]
All right, man, okay, we'll put them down, but of course is like like I said there's eight million Johnny dark

[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.700]
If it is them on we know I guarantee you one of the Johnny dark is probably an asshole wouldn't you say?

[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:50.100]
They must be sure gotta be there just so many of them just law percentages says probably somebody named Johnny dark is a real major ass

[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.820]
We can play that from not all one o'clock and probably be pretty safe

[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:00.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and

[01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:02.960]
Verizon wireless line

[01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.300]
Oh not another one of these priest stories or pastor stories dammit

[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.040]
Hate these things. There seem to be a lot of these in Ohio. You know it

[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.660]
Yeah, I did notice the Dayton Daily News a Montgomery County grand jury issued an 11 count Mr

[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:22.680]
Me neither Red Diamond yesterday against the Reverend Thomas Koon

[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.380]
K. U. H. N. Koon on charges of public indecency providing alcohol to minors

[01:10:28.020 --> 01:10:31.480]
QN62 former pastor of San Henry Catholic Church in Miami Township

[01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:37.800]
That's Miami Ohio which charged with one kind of public indecency six counts of furnishing booze to minors and four kinds of allowing minors to

[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.740]
Possess or consume booze on his premises

[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:46.900]
County prosecutor Matthias Heck Jr said the investigation of Koon is nowhere but the grand jury brought the 11-9 minutes yesterday to avoid any

[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.260]
Statute limitations issues

[01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:54.540]
The offense is occurred at his home in Miami Township November 2001 in January 2002 include five victims

[01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.960]
Formal in one female 18 years or younger

[01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.200]
He has since moved to Cincinnati

[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:05.620]
And it goes now with a whole song of dance about he did this and they did that and yeah, okay, and they had a good time

[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:11.060]
Wonder if he's came to mark you in the former pd at the INZ if you know real whip remember mark you and remember him

[01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:16.360]
That night we had that seminar at Paxon with an asshole Walter's say oh yeah, oh my god

[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:21.560]
I guess I did that last break early didn't I'm not really sure why I did that I don't care

[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:23.800]
Huh I don't care either because we got out of the way now

[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:28.360]
We have like a nice long one and the long segment too. Is it really a chance to just read this?

[01:11:29.140 --> 01:11:34.300]
From CBS news x-8 says Pala misled Americans in other words. He's a freaking liar

[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.620]
The

[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:45.040]
Person responsible for analyzing the Iraqi weapons threat for Colin Powell says the secretary of state misinformed Americans during his speech at the UN last winter and he is

[01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:51.320]
Greg dealman tells correspondent Scott Pelley of CBS news that at the time of policy speech

[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:55.540]
Erak did not pose any imminent threat to anyone not even its own neighbors

[01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:00.100]
I think my conclusion about policy speech now is that it's probably one of the low points in his long

[01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:02.160]
Distinguished service to the nation says dealman

[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:08.100]
Pelley's report was broadcast on 60 minutes to on CBS last night while the rest of us were watching a Marlon Cup game

[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:15.100]
The human also tells Pelley that he believes the decision to go to war was made first and that the intelligence was interpreted to fit that conclusion

[01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:16.580]
Kind of like the Warren commission

[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:22.820]
The main problem was that the senior administration officials have what I call faith-based intelligence says dealman

[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:28.240]
They knew what they wanted the intelligence to show they were really blind in depth to any kind of countervailing information

[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:35.140]
The intelligence community would produce I'd assign some blame to the intelligence community and most of the blame to the senior administration officials

[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:45.580]
Steve Allanson and it does another UN inspectors in Iraq also boxed policy speech various people would laugh at various time during policy speech because the information was presenting was just

[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.220]
You know didn't mean anything had no meaning said Allanson

[01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:54.960]
Pelley asked when the secretary of state finished the speech you and the other inspectors turned to each other and said what

[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.260]
Allyson responds they have nothing

[01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:02.420]
Allanson gives Pelley several examples of why he believes Iraq didn't have weapons of mass destruction

[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.720]
One time he was sent to find decontamination vehicles that turned out to be fire trucks

[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:11.140]
Another time a satellite spotted what they thought were trucks used for biological weapons

[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:15.640]
We were told we were going to decide to look for refrigerated trucks specifically linked to biological agents

[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.120]
Allanson told Pelley we found seven or eight trucks

[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:25.880]
I think in total they had cobwebs in them some samples were taken and nothing was found along came a spider and sat down beside her

[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:29.380]
Eating its curds in way how do you like that uh

[01:13:30.300 --> 01:13:33.260]
Not unlike her so like I've been telling you all the long freaking liar

[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:38.040]
It was all decided 1999 four years ago up front long ago

[01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:42.840]
Guys and good with that story about how Halleberton is overcharging is ripping off the public

[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:45.340]
You see that story on what a shock yeah

[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:52.280]
From the Washington Post by Sue Fleming no relation to Vic Fleming remember the Vic Fleming trot

[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:53.760]
No

[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.880]
US Democratic lawmaker or yesterday accused Halleberton the Texas oil services company once run by vice president

[01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:05.960]
Dick Cheney of overcharging the US government for gasoline the firm imports into Iraq. What a surprise what a shock

[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:11.700]
A bunch of thieves a bunch of bandito stole the 2000 election and they taken over the whole god damn world

[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:18.300]
Just like the uh lone ranger in reverse like Robin Hooden reverse stealing from the poor giving to the rich

[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.860]
Halleberton's of city are a Kellogg Brown and root

[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.640]
As the contract with US Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild a racks oil sector

[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:30.620]
Which is included importing gasoline products and short supply to the over rich nation

[01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.740]
Millions of Americans want to help Iraqis, but they don't want to be fleeced by Halleberton

[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:40.100]
Representative Henry Waxman that bald guy from California with a little mustache told the news conference

[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.780]
Waxman said army document sure that as of September 18

[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:49.440]
US had paid Halleberton 300 million dollars to import about 190 million gallons of gasoline into Iraq

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.040]
Halleberton charged an average price of a dollar 59 per gallon

[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.380]
Excluding the company's fee of two to seven percent said Waxman

[01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:00.660]
He said the average wholesale cost of gasoline in that period in the Middle East was about

[01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.920]
71 cents a gallon a figure in oil industry source told writers was accurate

[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:10.300]
Which meant that Halleberton was charging more than 90 cents a gallon to transport fuel into a rack from Q

[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:11.000]
Kuwait

[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:15.100]
When we checked with independent experts to see if this fee was reasonable

[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:20.480]
They were stunned said Waxman adding a reasonable transport cost would be 10 to 25 cents a gallon

[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:23.360]
Especially as the US military was providing security

[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:31.040]
Waxman sent a letter yesterday to the White House Office of OAMB complaining that KBR was overcharging for petroleum products

[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.240]
So bend over again and get ready to be ahead. Okay America just bend over spread your cheeks. Let them have a good time doing it

[01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:41.420]
Our in 26 minutes away from that magic moment

Let's see here's one it says you have to go to www.560.com QAMB

[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.660]
It's better than the station's own website. Well, I've not seen much. I said say it anything. No

[01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:03.380]
It's got great historical stuff from the station old-sound bites and pitches of all the old DJs

[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:05.200]
Probably most of them rotting

[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.880]

So I'll root for the Marlins and when they win. I can't wait to see mr. Sealing's face

[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.560]

Movie passes to the premiere of radio on Saturday courtesy of the real yellow pages from bell sound

What is that about radio?

[01:26:58.660 --> 01:27:00.440]
It's about a football playing mango

[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:08.340]
Oh, seriously, what does it write about a football playing mango? It is yes, well, then why is it called radio? That's his name

All the great day have a great day. I haven't put any of those on there because nobody knows how about Charlie Van Dyke

[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.280]
He was in Detroit was big in LA. Huh Charlie Van Dyke

[01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.100]

[01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.980]
Let's put Charlie on there Charlie Van Dyke

[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:40.700]
He was gigantic. He was big. In fact, if you talk real life time I'd play his jingle

[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:47.460]
If we can get the blind mic to call him we might play a whole bunch of jingles here just to make him happy on this moment

[01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.720]
The stable and the ratings are coming out. Who am I talking about?

[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:53.260]
Charlie Van Dyke. Oh, yeah, and Kimba

[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:59.140]

The motorcy

[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:19.820]
1151 nine minutes till noon. I can't believe this show is smoking along and uh and that you know it's just a matter of time

[01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:24.520]
That clock is relentlessly moving ahead toward one and at that moment

[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:26.280]
They're gonna be some real real

[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.220]
Spastic

[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:31.360]
Rectal explosions absolutely probably in focus absolutely

[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:37.780]
All the crack you can unwrap that's what he's gonna drop today and when you got the hour by hour on Monday

[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:40.860]
Then you're really gonna hear some absolutely heavy duty

[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.920]
Hey, hey, he gets prizes with what with about a three

[01:29:47.940 --> 01:29:54.280]
If he if he breaks a three five in his two hours in men, I'll be shocked. You'll break wind

[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.980]
I'll be amazed. I'll I'll bend over right in front of the mic and far with heavy duty forward

[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:02.000]
Taking all four consequences even if it might be liquid or solid

[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:07.280]
Because I just can't believe it. Well, you will you'll never know that's true. I will tell you though. Never gonna use that

[01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:09.100]
Speaking

[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:17.340]
Pretty good. How are you today sir? What about Patty Hayes? It's a loop in Chicago. She was wonderful

[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:19.000]
Patty Hayes

[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:20.740]
No

[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:25.600]
All right, she's been around for almost 25 years never heard of Patty Hayes go

[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:27.700]
Make you happy. How about Patty Murray?

[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:33.740]
There you go. We want to put her on there in honor of the Wgtr Patty Murray put her on this

[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.120]
How about her mimic mimic the bavine as a as a combo

[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:45.540]
Well, what do you mean by that? Oh, we're not gonna put any combos on here. Oh, no, I'm just asking do you want to list it separate or

[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:48.900]
In fact, they're skipping being that is what he's saying now. You want fries with that?

[01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:53.880]
Now, let's not put them on here. Let's put Patty Murray on she was nice. Yes. She was nice to us

[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:58.780]
Then she died and they put a plaque on the van and changed the station of the month later

[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.920]
Yeah, they put a plaque in a man and say in honor of Patty Murray they changed the whole format

[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:10.640]
5670560 pound 560 on the end. Well, I tell you grave robbers. That's an h to this business including Disney man

[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:12.520]
Well, it wasn't he there was there. That was him

[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.780]
Before Bobby Green came down scoot everything up

[01:31:16.520 --> 01:31:22.420]
The anxious moustache would Mike Disney never trust an asshole from Chicago. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney

[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.120]
I bet you he's like it is wounds today Mr. Cub fan huh?

[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:30.580]
I the Cub suck Mike. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. They blow at a choke. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney

[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:36.760]
You can hear the gagging sounds all the way across the lake. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. Did you hear that they on there?

[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.140]
There are people in some local yeah, that's it. You know the fan that

[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:44.760]
Interfeared with that play. Yes, I sure do. There's a local group down here that wants to bring them on down and

[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.960]
Hook them up. Yeah, we hit that. I think we put that on a website. Sorry. That's story. They want to give them hotel come down treat them right

[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:57.580]
All the southern area. The man some fans blamed for Tuesday nights cub laws because he reached out and touched the file ball

[01:31:57.580 --> 01:32:01.760]
That Moishie allu was trying to catch it as they done. How'd you like to home run that carry woodhead last night? Scott

[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:08.260]
How about that then no, I'm I mean Marlon still ones. You don't have to get all better

[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:14.080]
But that was a hell of a that was a bomb. It sure was it was a nice fat three two pitch a fastball right down the middle

[01:32:14.080 --> 01:32:22.200]
As fat as me and fat rich and he just beltered him and he like Joseph Gackie would say he crushed it. It was amazing. The man could do it all

[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:27.840]
He can he's good, but he of course is pitching last night left a little bit to be desired just a little anyway

[01:32:28.660 --> 01:32:34.780]
This guy coaches youth baseball in the northern Chicago suburbs Steve Bartman 26 and Tom Brennan is pretty pissed off

[01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:38.780]
That people are saying Steve Bartman's name and putting his picture on here as he as he was mentioning his name

[01:32:38.780 --> 01:32:42.660]
Worse said he would associate an international consulting firm in Lincolnshire

[01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:46.420]
He is an ass oh shit at he would he's not coming to work today

[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:52.260]
They said yesterday because of the incident Suzanne the god I'm a red they spoke to him for he would said the yesterday morning

[01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:55.320]
That was the decision that Steve and human resources made together

[01:32:56.000 --> 01:33:00.980]
We have been in contact with Steve. He's in a cave. He's under the serious tower and you'll never see his ass again

[01:33:00.980 --> 01:33:03.660]
In fact, he's undergoing plastic surgery at this moment

[01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:09.500]
The man who answered the door at the north brokoma or friends and a neighbor said Bartman grew up defended him saying

[01:33:09.500 --> 01:33:12.360]
He only did what came naturally when a foul ball came his way

[01:33:12.880 --> 01:33:15.780]
He's a huge cubs fan said the man who responded to mr. Bartman

[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:19.200]
I sure taught him well. I taught him to catch foul balls when they come near him

[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.380]
He declined to say no more see if they would have one last night everybody said hey all it's forgiven

[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:27.060]
Steve come on us. That's party. You're invited to celebration. We're going to the world serious

[01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.140]
But nothing to get there as kicked and they choked and gagged again

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.720]
No seriously if they want to string somebody up how about their Alex Gonzalez, huh?

[01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:37.980]
And I say there since there are two one at one side by each

[01:33:37.980 --> 01:33:38.580]
Huh?

[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:44.460]
It wasn't they it wasn't the play that broke the camels back. It was still like three to one. There was a runner on

[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.880]
For whatever there were first and second right? Sure one out

[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.540]
Five outs away from wrapping it up and here's a perfect tailor made double play ball to Alice Gonzalez

[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.240]
Anybody who ends in easy to never trust him George?

[01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:01.720]
There he's Alice Gonzalez and he boots it baby. He booted it

[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.080]
And that was the end of that from that moment on it was like pure crap. It's ridiculous

[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:09.160]
You know bill buckner in 86 right

[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:12.300]
You should watch his dad do ground ball right through his legs. That's right

[01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:18.860]
They should allow Bill Brown your Alex Gonzalez of the cubs and Steve Brum whatever's name is all together side by each

[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:23.480]
We're supporting you five six

I'm listening show because I'm tired and old and whatever else all the way used to be the best in a

[02:02:14.920 --> 02:02:19.840]
business until I you know you know how that all goes with Phil is okay till he became a right

[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:24.780]
wing and asshole and any rate I'm listening only 26 minutes away from the big moment of

[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:27.740]
one o'clock and of course people are wondering what else is going to have it on one o'clock

[02:02:27.740 --> 02:02:29.320]
big heavy duty stuff man

[02:02:30.020 --> 02:02:31.720]

[02:02:31.720 --> 02:02:35.660]
so what's the story with Miguel out there we got an update we had 120 bucks I was off taking a

[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:38.500]
piece so he might have called during the breath phone is ringing off the hook over there he

[02:02:38.500 --> 02:02:42.860]
doesn't have a whole bunch of those world series tickets okay doesn't have any I

[02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:45.860]
said he doesn't have a whole bunch more than more than maybe

[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:50.340]
okay so if you get over there right away and ask him he got a world series tickets

[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:54.600]

[02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.200]
Till forget to take your pill, a knife she's got in touch.

[02:10:49.740 --> 02:10:52.900]
Tasting pills and nutted chokes, far-a-pulled and broken.

[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:56.440]
Brushed and shrugged and beat it, took her narrow, honest, though.

[02:10:57.000 --> 02:11:00.080]
The power of the devil, God give him the grass.

[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:03.700]
The power of the devil, he makes his fucking man.

[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.460]
The power of the devil, he's a grumpy head.

[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:11.240]
The power of the devil, the power of the devil.

[02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:16.920]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

[02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:21.320]
He's not poking at getting higher.

[02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.820]
He's not poking at getting higher.

[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:28.320]
He's not poking at getting higher.

[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:58.300]
The bomb is found, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's

[02:12:02.760 --> 02:12:26.540]
down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down, it's down

[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.640]
No, it's 13 to 1, 1248.

[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.440]
240 bucks, that's not too good.

[02:12:33.780 --> 02:12:36.240]
Especially considering all of them damn world series tickets.

[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:39.980]
Yeah, and the riot. 240 bucks out there at Pino Tallah carpet.

[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.680]
And the lovely Miguel is there waiting for you.

[02:12:41.780 --> 02:12:43.300]
And he might have a surprise for you, never know.

[02:12:45.180 --> 02:12:45.580]
21...

[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:47.840]
That wouldn't surprise me.

[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:50.980]
2101 West Atlantic Boulevard in Palm Pino, man.

[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:54.760]
And only for those who donate to our best meal for a band and pair rescue,

[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:59.200]
you movie past in the premiere of Radio this Saturday courtesy of the real yellow pages from Bell South.

[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:02.140]
So 240, and we can do 500 bucks out 600?

[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:03.880]
Yeah, okay, 500 sounds good.

[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:06.000]
You know, it's time to optimistic.

[02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:08.580]
Why do you better get those damn tickets while they allow last?

[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:13.840]
Let's see, Gonzer is now programming a satellite classic rock format.

[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.500]
And it's got a website here.

[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:17.520]
When did Legion Let Die a couple of years ago?

[02:13:18.440 --> 02:13:20.420]
Scott Levison stuck in the Pinellas Park.

[02:13:22.620 --> 02:13:24.160]
Oh, thanks Scott, that's the guy's name.

[02:13:24.160 --> 02:13:27.580]
I don't usually read people's last name, but anyway, they won't find a Mason Pinellas Park.

[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:29.940]
He's one probably pulled a switch on it, broadly living.

[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:35.400]
The evil doer, Faxson, says, for the workless file, I think I remember reading them in 1963,

[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:40.820]
Dick Beyond, the Casey Case and Bob U-Banks and Gary Owens, all worked at K-R-L-A.

[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.880]
Pretty good line of says, the evil master. Thank you, evil master, and...

[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:47.060]
Here's another fact that says, oh, where do I start?

[02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:48.840]
What are cash to characters on Q-M?

[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:50.260]
Lots of boring assholes.

[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:51.400]
How do you like this?

[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:54.280]
Well, if you find them, boring, don't listen to them.

[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.480]
Wussam, whatever your name is, Cuxahoyce.

[02:13:58.060 --> 02:14:01.240]
Not to pick on it, he can't because he sounds like an ice-grab, but he's so boring.

[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:05.400]
And according to him, the marlins are going to win the World Series if the sun shines at a 45 degree angle from the west.

[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:07.600]
And the temperature's less than 75 for five minutes.

[02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:09.100]
His gambling talk is terminal.

[02:14:09.480 --> 02:14:11.460]
Joe Castello, oh my god, it says.

[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.140]
I never thought I would say this, but this guy's more boring than George if you think that's possible.

[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:15.700]
Yes, we do.

[02:14:16.020 --> 02:14:17.000]
And the big...

[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:17.220]
Ow!

[02:14:17.860 --> 02:14:19.100]
What an asshole, it says.

[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:21.260]
He thinks he knows everything, and he is not you.

[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.180]
He is almost as boring as Joe Castello.

[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:24.580]
Fat, ugly, and boring.

[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:26.140]
How do they know what the big ol' looks like?

[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:26.860]
They stalk him.

[02:14:27.340 --> 02:14:28.360]
Oh, well they're right.

[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:30.940]
Oh, he's a good guy though, but he's fat, ugly, and boring.

[02:14:31.460 --> 02:14:35.300]
This leaves me with Howard Davidid, the true definition of pompous asshole who likes to suck...

[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:37.280]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:40.060]
I almost got sucked into reading that, what it says here.

[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.900]
It's only J-Feelers though, okay, don't feel bad.

[02:14:43.480 --> 02:14:43.840]
Wussam.

[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:48.880]
Howard Jim Man did hate you like poison, and it signed the phony facts from the mad dog.

[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.240]
But we know that's already too annoying.

[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:51.740]
Yes, all right.

[02:14:52.040 --> 02:14:52.960]
No doubt about it.

[02:14:53.380 --> 02:14:56.260]
Seven, 0560, 0560.

[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:56.680]
Absolutely.

[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:02.100]
Not a AT&T for us, now we're just 10 minutes away from that magical moment when the little hand's gonna hit the big hand.

[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:04.680]
And we get that big one or two hours, it's gonna be humongous.

[02:15:04.760 --> 02:15:07.580]
Well, Van Jack 61, favorite disc jockey of all time.

[02:15:08.260 --> 02:15:10.200]
Rikshaw 49, Kid Curry 24.

[02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.060]
And he said, Anna still got a huge ass.

[02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:15.780]
Joey Reynolds and cousin Brucey 15.

[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:17.720]
Oh, that's a great pairing.

[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:19.840]
That's a match made in purgatory, side by each.

[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:22.560]
Larry Lujak 11, Dick Beyondy 10.

[02:15:23.140 --> 02:15:24.260]
Just changing again.

[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:30.380]
More of the K's got 8, Dick Purton 8, and Johnny Darks got 6, Harlett 6, and that's it.

[02:15:30.880 --> 02:15:32.780]
But I get down to 5, 6, small potatoes, right?

[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:33.960]
Small potatoes.

[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:35.480]
Somebody cue A, I'm hello.

[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:36.420]
Robby Young.

[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:38.080]
Robby Young is good.

[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:40.920]
I think that was him.

[02:15:41.180 --> 02:15:43.200]
That was him come from the other side, wasn't it?

[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:45.640]
That was Robby, calling from a phone booth.

[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:47.360]
They're an E on the end of Young.

[02:15:47.820 --> 02:15:49.340]
Yes, Y-O-N-G-E.

[02:15:49.860 --> 02:15:51.640]
Y-O-U, just an E.

[02:15:52.980 --> 02:15:53.720]
Hey, Robby.

[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:54.980]
That's another one.

[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:55.940]
I already wrote it with a U.

[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.860]
Deputy Q-A-M.

[02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:58.940]
Hello.

[02:15:59.440 --> 02:15:59.820]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:01.300]
Yes, is this George?

[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:02.020]
Yeah.

[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:04.380]
I'm just calling for some information.

[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:08.020]
Yesterday, Neil was reading an article about the sex.

[02:16:08.020 --> 02:16:09.980]
And, um, and health.

[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:10.680]
Yeah.

[02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:13.400]
Did you tell me where I put the name of the article?

[02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:16.080]
Forbes Magazine, this month's Forbes Magazine.

[02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:18.360]
Is it online?

[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:21.000]
Yeah, Forbes.com.

[02:16:21.940 --> 02:16:24.080]
And the title of the article.

[02:16:24.140 --> 02:16:25.800]
The title of the article is, I have no idea.

[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:27.120]
Get busy. Start doing it right now.

[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:29.420]
Your prostate will be real healthy, okay?

[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:31.920]
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.

[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:34.940]
Hey, don't forget about those tickets out there at the Pino Tallah carpet.

[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:39.140]
Does it have tickets for radio?

[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:40.960]
Yes.

[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.180]
Tickets for radio.

[02:16:42.180 --> 02:16:43.900]
I mean, you can call them passes, but that's no fun.

[02:16:44.260 --> 02:16:46.500]
Oh, here's unbelievably chronic factor bill.

[02:16:46.700 --> 02:16:48.080]
I mean, just out of control.

[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:52.200]
A couple of weeks ago, I came by the radio station to pick up a pair of Marlon tickets

[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:53.520]
that I wanted to jim and to show.

[02:16:53.780 --> 02:16:54.160]
See what I mean?

[02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:54.960]
Marlon tickets.

[02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:56.820]
The game was great.

[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:58.900]
I appreciate the free tickets, but I have one question.

[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:00.460]
What the hell is that thing?

[02:17:00.800 --> 02:17:01.600]
Oh, this is a good fact.

[02:17:01.880 --> 02:17:04.340]
What is that thing working behind the desk on the third floor?

[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:05.280]
On the third floor.

[02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:05.940]
You turned.

[02:17:06.420 --> 02:17:09.720]
It had a Power 96 T-shirt on a go-t that was so long it was braided.

[02:17:10.020 --> 02:17:12.860]
It asked me for my ID and I was afraid to let it know my home address.

[02:17:13.060 --> 02:17:14.000]
So I'll give me your home address.

[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:14.740]
Your home address.

[02:17:15.220 --> 02:17:16.500]
Does it work there all the time?

[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:18.660]
Was it a temp from an agency in the Perletons care center?

[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:21.160]
Still freaked out by the Freaks as bill.

[02:17:21.340 --> 02:17:22.940]
The Perletons care about the news, yes.

[02:17:23.220 --> 02:17:25.960]
And that's Greg Reed's idea of a receptionist, okay?

[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.680]
That's why, you know, they talk about putting your best foot forward to kill him.

[02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.180]
Well, I'm going to put our worst foot forward and maybe up your ass.

[02:17:32.180 --> 02:17:33.240]
So that's it.

[02:17:33.500 --> 02:17:36.140]
It's quite the wheel of fortune when you come visit us because it could be the beautiful

[02:17:36.140 --> 02:17:37.820]
Nazlin or it.

[02:17:38.940 --> 02:17:39.420]
Nazlin's nice.

[02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:39.980]
She's attractive.

[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:40.540]
She's friendly.

[02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:41.140]
She's very nice.

[02:17:41.260 --> 02:17:41.700]
She's a sweetheart.

[02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:44.700]
But most of the time, the it is sitting out there.

[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:47.160]
Now that's not the first it that we encountered at QA.

[02:17:47.200 --> 02:17:48.140]
And we also had another it.

[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:49.220]
It never showed up.

[02:17:49.280 --> 02:17:49.960]
No, he wasn't the yet.

[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:50.720]
He was the thing.

[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:51.060]

[02:17:51.580 --> 02:17:55.820]
With a smelly old suit that was from like, what was the thing about where they were sitting

[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:56.280]
in the attic?

[02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:57.360]
What the hell was that?

[02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:58.440]
Ethan Hawke was in a movie?

[02:17:58.620 --> 02:17:59.180]
I don't know.

[02:17:59.180 --> 02:17:59.780]
Flowers in the attic.

[02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:00.360]
No, no.

[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:02.940]
You know what I'm talking about when I had the cowards in the ant.

[02:18:02.940 --> 02:18:03.480]
The diary of Ant-Frank.

[02:18:03.980 --> 02:18:07.240]
No, they had the cobwebs and the old spins there was an attic.

[02:18:07.720 --> 02:18:08.220]
Great expectation.

[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:09.440]
Oh, all right.

[02:18:09.760 --> 02:18:11.040]
That's what they had in the pizza joint.

[02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:11.680]
Great expectation.

[02:18:11.780 --> 02:18:13.800]
Little butt plug baseball cap.

[02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:14.680]
Please.

[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:19.500]
And this freak oldist thing came by and applied for a job and they actually hired him.

[02:18:19.720 --> 02:18:20.460]
They hired it.

[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:23.220]
And when I called him the thing on the year, he was on his way.

[02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:24.900]
I guess he was actually on his way to work that morning.

[02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:25.260]
Wasn't he?

[02:18:25.360 --> 02:18:26.840]
He was ready to welcome him.

[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:30.940]
And he turned around and went back home for which I'm eternally grateful.

[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:34.380]
OK, we got enough freaks and fruit cakes in that building without the thing.

[02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:36.940]
We got it and we had the thing.

[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:40.360]
And then we got screw in and we got Phil's.

[02:18:40.400 --> 02:18:42.300]
We got a lot of interesting people in that building.

[02:18:42.680 --> 02:18:43.620]
No more PD Lenny though.

[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:44.060]
Thank God.

[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:44.940]
Quick call on the show.

[02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:45.880]
PD, we hate you.

[02:18:46.500 --> 02:18:47.720]
560, 705, 60.

[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:50.300]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:50.960]
QAM, hello.

[02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:51.520]
Hi, Neil.

[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:51.880]
How you doing?

[02:18:51.900 --> 02:18:52.240]
Yes, sir.

[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:52.840]
Hi.

[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:55.960]
I wanted to check in one of my favorite DJs with my motor.

[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:57.660]
Who was it, Charlie Murdoch?

[02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:58.440]
OK, thanks, Mike.

[02:18:58.700 --> 02:18:58.920]
OK.

[02:18:59.320 --> 02:18:59.880]
Have a great day.

[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:00.240]
You too.

[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:00.880]
Bye-bye.

[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:01.520]
What?

[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:03.400]
I wanted to hear some jingles.

[02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:06.820]
Would you stop picking on poor blind Mike?

[02:19:07.720 --> 02:19:08.740]
He doesn't like to be called that.

[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:09.800]
That's why I said it.

[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:11.700]
Would you stop picking on poor blind Mike?

[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:12.860]
Wants?

[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:14.540]
Charlie Murdoch?

[02:19:14.680 --> 02:19:15.280]
That's a good choice.

[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.260]
The first phone call I ever took in mind me.

[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:22.160]
I was doing weekends in WIOD following Russell Wases, a real asshole.

[02:19:22.580 --> 02:19:23.840]
Playing music, spinning records.

[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:24.800]
Were we putting him on there?

[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:25.440]
Who?

[02:19:25.740 --> 02:19:26.180]
Russell Wases.

[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:26.580]
I was putting him on there.

[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:26.920]
I don't care.

[02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:27.400]
He doesn't care.

[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:27.900]
He's got millions.

[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:28.540]
What does he care?

[02:19:29.660 --> 02:19:30.900]
And then the phone rang.

[02:19:31.160 --> 02:19:33.820]
And now, I'm sitting there spinning a very man-a-low record, I believe.

[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:35.620]
I'm ashamed to admit.

[02:19:36.380 --> 02:19:38.620]
And I pick up the phone WIOD.

[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:43.280]
You never worked with you sound just like, you know, I forget who that was.

[02:19:43.700 --> 02:19:44.740]
It was like Charlie Murdoch.

[02:19:44.800 --> 02:19:45.600]
And it was blind Mike.

[02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:48.760]
Is that incredibly how many years ago that is?

[02:19:48.860 --> 02:19:49.800]
About 30, man.

[02:19:49.900 --> 02:19:50.480]
Pretty damn near.

[02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:51.600]
Pretty damn close.

[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:55.220]
I would say that was like, that was before I came to KAT.

[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:59.580]
That was my first episode filling in on WIOD back in the Jim Gallant days.

[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:02.760]
And there was the other guy from Kansas City that asshole.

[02:20:04.440 --> 02:20:06.520]
The general manager in Jim Gallant was the PD.

[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:09.660]
And they took me to the Playboy Club for a dinner one night to interview me.

[02:20:09.760 --> 02:20:10.860]
Didn't see if they wanted to hire me.

[02:20:11.480 --> 02:20:12.420]
Oh, bunny Barbara.

[02:20:12.800 --> 02:20:13.280]
Bunny Barbara.

[02:20:13.540 --> 02:20:15.880]
Jim Gallant acted like he never saw a broad before in his life.

[02:20:15.980 --> 02:20:17.340]
Like, he never saw a boob.

[02:20:17.460 --> 02:20:20.380]
He never certainly came anywhere near one of those SSY deals.

[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:23.520]
And he just, there was an asshole made a clown out of himself.

[02:20:24.080 --> 02:20:26.780]
Now, if you were going to hire me, wouldn't you take me like to the Playboy Club?

[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:27.320]
Oh, yeah.

[02:20:27.900 --> 02:20:28.060]
Yeah.

[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:29.240]
Didn't they know about you?

[02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:29.780]
It was nasty.

[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:30.940]
Bitches away from me.

[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:31.800]
You idiots, okay?

[02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:34.100]
Jim Gallant and Joe Abernathy.

[02:20:34.100 --> 02:20:39.000]
That was the Kansas City Mafia that Cox broadcasting hired to run IOD in those days.

[02:20:40.960 --> 02:20:42.160]
The great entertainers.

[02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:43.620]
Well, I've said it's 100 years ago.

[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:45.420]
It's still a crap market.

[02:20:45.900 --> 02:20:47.060]
It's 12.56 now.

[02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:49.600]
You don't understand what's going to happen when you come back from the break, don't you?

[02:20:50.820 --> 02:20:51.420]
That's it.

[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:54.660]
Imagine, I don't want you to get nervous, mall, because…

[02:20:54.660 --> 02:20:55.100]
Absolutely.

[02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:57.740]
A lot of heavy duty crap is coming down.

[02:20:57.860 --> 02:20:58.480]
Absolutely, absolutely.

[02:20:58.480 --> 02:20:58.820]
Any second.

[02:20:58.920 --> 02:20:59.360]
Absolutely.

[02:21:00.620 --> 02:21:01.460]
I know what it does.

[02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:03.580]
You're going to be the one that has to answer for Santino.

[02:21:03.860 --> 02:21:04.220]
Mike.

[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.200]
Michael.

[02:21:05.420 --> 02:21:05.780]
And Ray Probe.

[02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:06.680]
He's got this thing.

[02:21:06.800 --> 02:21:07.700]
This is the Sports Radio 560.

[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.660]
It's more of a nuisance.

[02:21:11.580 --> 02:21:12.560]
The deal rises.

[02:21:13.100 --> 02:21:13.940]
One to two hours.

[02:21:15.960 --> 02:21:17.980]
But it's no Bud David, baby.

[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.460]
Well I hate what I'm doing on QAM.

[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:26.060]
I'm putting that bag in back on again.

[02:21:26.200 --> 02:21:27.980]
I want what they had must for.

[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:29.660]
These are my kind of guys.

[02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:33.760]
I wouldn't have had anything to do with anyway.

[02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:36.560]
If the manly sounded guys really gay.

[02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:38.640]
I want more at Christmas more.

[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:40.080]
Ghost poison is real high.

[02:21:41.840 --> 02:21:43.820]
When I listen to the sports,

[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:46.560]
a manly voice won't get my attention.

[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:49.040]
But we'll really get to be stiff in this short.

[02:21:49.540 --> 02:21:51.640]
A squeaky high voice will give me a direction.

[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:54.800]
Well I hate what we're doing on QAM.

[02:21:55.300 --> 02:21:57.420]
I'm putting that bag in back on again.

[02:21:57.700 --> 02:22:00.980]
I'm going to this here and straight man with voices this high.

[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:05.360]
Now I'll have to get deeper in that closet again.

[02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:08.140]
So I could impress all the macho brands.

[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:11.400]
And check out Chris Morendite to help the fans decide.

[02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:16.400]
Yeah, there ain't nothing like having macho sports guys.

[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.920]
His voice has had some practice.

[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:19.400]
They were 12 years old.

[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:21.140]
They didn't have a lot of that.

[02:22:21.700 --> 02:22:24.960]
Yeah, stand up real close to the radio and press the sound.

[02:22:25.620 --> 02:22:27.080]
Get their voices on up there.

[02:22:27.260 --> 02:22:29.420]
Really makes my balls stay filled in.

[02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:31.600]
And that crow man.

[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:34.220]
Well he's smarter than my infrared brother.

[02:22:34.580 --> 02:22:34.760]
Yup.

[02:22:37.380 --> 02:22:39.000]
We're number one.

[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:41.200]
102 at 560 W.

[02:22:41.300 --> 02:22:42.800]
Can I just play that just for practice?

[02:22:43.060 --> 02:22:43.280]
Okay.

[02:22:45.080 --> 02:22:46.780]
And they come running in there with eight numbers yet.

[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:48.080]
Well why not?

[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.340]
I guess it hasn't happened yet.

[02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.240]
We've got everybody pumped up about this.

[02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:54.340]
And everybody is hanging on the edge of the radio,

[02:22:54.340 --> 02:22:56.000]
including certain people who work in the building.

[02:22:56.120 --> 02:22:56.480]
Absolutely.

[02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:59.220]
Alright, like having spilkeys right over this.

[02:23:01.440 --> 02:23:01.960]
See that?

[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.400]
My irritable balls acting up again.

[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:04.560]
I'm sooner or later on with these numbers.

[02:23:05.720 --> 02:23:07.760]
Who is or was your favorite radio dish jockey?

[02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:09.340]
He not talk show host of all time.

[02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:10.640]
Wolfman Jack 62.

[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.180]
Richaw 53.

[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:14.700]
Give it a run for his money if he cleaned that cap.

[02:23:14.860 --> 02:23:15.420]
I bet it could be them.

[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:18.640]
Kate Curry 24, cousin Brucey 16.

[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:20.640]
Throw your Reynolds and Larry Lujek 15.

[02:23:20.780 --> 02:23:21.740]
That's this respectful.

[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:24.040]
Larry Lujek's embarrassed.

[02:23:24.380 --> 02:23:25.620]
Dick Biodi 10, Ray DeKate 10.

[02:23:25.960 --> 02:23:26.560]
Dick Purtonate.

[02:23:26.780 --> 02:23:29.020]
Highlights got six and it's down hill from there.

[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:34.540]
Pretty lame on the local Yokels like Russ of Oasis Nun.

[02:23:35.280 --> 02:23:36.000]
Robe Young Nun.

[02:23:38.220 --> 02:23:43.780]
I don't know if you're going to be able to do that.

[02:23:45.280 --> 02:23:46.000]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.000]

[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:46.440]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:48.160]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:23:48.160 --> 02:23:49.500]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:52.560]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:23:52.560 --> 02:24:01.800]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:24:03.680 --> 02:24:05.980]
I'm not going to be able to do that.

[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:12.760]
Listen, the Porquichedwick thing is actually he was an invention of Dave Schaeffer.

[02:24:13.180 --> 02:24:13.960]
Oh really?

[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:18.760]
Yeah, he was like Bob Oluv, what does the thing Howard does?

[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:20.020]
Bob Oluv.

[02:24:20.040 --> 02:24:20.500]
Bob Oluv.

[02:24:20.880 --> 02:24:22.140]
It's the same thing as that.

[02:24:22.420 --> 02:24:23.440]
He was Porquichedwick.

[02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:26.240]
He was a phony talk show caller.

[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:29.960]
So it was like Arnie Warren had that the remissor or roofist or whatever was yeah?

[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:35.960]
Yeah and why did Warren the name of Christ and Joey Reynolds find 15 people to vote for?

[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:36.200]
Yeah.

[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:37.560]
Pay them.

[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:38.620]
All right, bye.

[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:39.360]
Thanks.

[02:24:40.640 --> 02:24:44.000]
567 on Dave Schaeffer should get another vote there because there ain't no such person.

[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:45.560]
Who was it that he said to cross-off there?

[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:46.620]
Cheswick.

[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:48.340]
Oh, Mr. Cheswick.

[02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:49.500]
He did find his cigarettes.

[02:24:49.500 --> 02:24:50.340]
We're going to see that.

[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:52.160]
He did, then he just died here a few months ago.

[02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:54.440]
Yeah, I guess.

[02:24:54.740 --> 02:24:55.040]
I don't know.

[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:56.040]
Absolutely.

[02:24:56.480 --> 02:24:58.300]
They got to play Mr. Cheswick in the cook business.

[02:24:58.820 --> 02:24:59.180]
You died.

[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:00.440]
Why?

[02:25:00.820 --> 02:25:01.560]
A few months ago or something.

[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:02.060]
Absolutely.

[02:25:03.480 --> 02:25:06.280]
567-0560-pound-560 on the AT&T line.

[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.920]
I can't believe it's 104 already and they're not like racing in there.

[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:09.260]
I know.

[02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:13.220]
They're supposed to be coming into Doves' office too so they don't even have to schlep across the building.

[02:25:13.520 --> 02:25:14.540]
Yeah, well where the hell is Doves?

[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:14.760]
Doves?

[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:16.140]
He outgit in some is at the problem?

[02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:19.080]
Is Doves' trying to get his life a straight out a little bit?

[02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:20.680]
Doves' get off this instant.

[02:25:20.940 --> 02:25:22.240]
You clown, you silly person, you?

[02:25:22.980 --> 02:25:24.120]
He's working on it.

[02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:29.980]
Maybe he's got his finger in it.

[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:34.320]
567-0560-pound-560 on the AT&T line.

[02:25:34.880 --> 02:25:35.320]
WQAM.

[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:37.980]
QAM.

[02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:39.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.800]
I want to give you my disc chocky.

[02:25:44.240 --> 02:25:44.720]
Who is it?

[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:46.140]
William B. William.

[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:47.540]
William B. William's WNW.

[02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:48.860]
Right, you got it.

[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:49.480]
Got it.

[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:49.960]
Thanks, Pally.

[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:50.960]
You're welcome, bye.

[02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:52.160]
William B. William's.

[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:54.100]
That's for us old, old, old, farts WNW.

[02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:58.520]
I remember.

[02:25:59.160 --> 02:25:59.760]
No, you don't.

[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:00.480]
You decide to?

[02:26:00.960 --> 02:26:03.000]
The magic ballroom or something like that was his show.

[02:26:03.120 --> 02:26:03.520]
What was his name?

[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:04.620]
The Meckley Ballroom.

[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:09.120]
I bet you nobody is going to call in JP McCarthy from WJR and Detroit.

[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:10.380]
So let's put him on there, okay?

[02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:14.820]
Not that he was a good disc chocky because he was just a great voice.

[02:26:14.820 --> 02:26:16.100]
A smoothist butter.

[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:17.440]
Hey, you want these 12 plus numbers?

[02:26:17.640 --> 02:26:18.500]
Because those are the first ones.

[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:20.540]
I want whatever you got, Mr. I want those.

[02:26:20.660 --> 02:26:21.240]
Now you got numbers.

[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:22.160]
Now let's hear it.

[02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:23.160]
You got numbers, baby.

[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:24.080]
Except I didn't hear what you did.

[02:26:24.080 --> 02:26:26.380]
I just said, I said JP McCarthy.

[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:26.760]
All right.

[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:27.820]
WJR Detroit.

[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:29.100]
Here we go.

[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:31.200]
George is sticking through there, baby.

[02:26:31.500 --> 02:26:32.460]
And number two.

[02:26:32.740 --> 02:26:33.600]
Stick a number in there.

[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:36.600]
Oh.

[02:26:37.860 --> 02:26:38.340]
Oh.

[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.540]
All right.

[02:26:44.760 --> 02:26:45.960]
Now these are 12 plus.

[02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:46.400]
Yeah.

[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:47.640]
Now we just did the run away.

[02:26:47.900 --> 02:26:49.960]
We're number one, David.

[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:52.620]
I don't know that's for effect, but I have a premonition that says.

[02:26:52.620 --> 02:26:54.840]
We're number one, David.

[02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.300]
Of course I'm not saying which day part.

[02:26:56.400 --> 02:26:57.780]
I'm covering my ass.

[02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:01.480]
JP McCarthy, William B. Williams, Charlie Murdoch.

[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:04.040]
It was really a treat here and from my friend Blind Mike today, you know what?

[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:05.200]
That's always special.

[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:06.880]
It's always a special moment.

[02:27:07.080 --> 02:27:08.300]
I always take my, my, my.

[02:27:08.540 --> 02:27:09.780]
What a great day this is.

[02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:10.760]
WDQ I am.

[02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:11.740]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:27:12.220 --> 02:27:12.620]
Pretty good.

[02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:13.760]
All right.

[02:27:14.200 --> 02:27:14.860]
Come on in the air yet.

[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:15.900]
What is it?

[02:27:16.220 --> 02:27:16.820]
My on the area.

[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:19.220]
Sounds just like you, but you are you on a speaker phone?

[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:21.080]
Oh, no, no.

[02:27:21.220 --> 02:27:23.180]
I just have you up on the other, in the other room.

[02:27:23.580 --> 02:27:23.600]
Okay.

[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:27.700]
But anyway, the Marlins are going to win against the Yankees.

[02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:28.320]
Right.

[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:32.840]
And then after that, the owner is going to sell them like you did when they want to get the Yankees left.

[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:34.060]
Right?

[02:27:34.900 --> 02:27:36.160]
But it was, it was a different owner.

[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:37.320]
Right, but this one.

[02:27:37.320 --> 02:27:40.420]
And they didn't win against the Yankees the last time it was against the Cleveland Indians.

[02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:43.240]
So first up on your baseball trivia, okay?

[02:27:44.240 --> 02:27:44.600]
1997.

[02:27:44.820 --> 02:27:45.780]
Was that the Yankees?

[02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:46.720]
No, no, it was not.

[02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:53.420]
Facing, and by the way, that picture for the Indians who lost the game, what else that guy who keeps gaining more and more weight?

[02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.620]
Who used to play for the Indians?

[02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:57.660]
See, Skye is supposed to know these things.

[02:27:57.660 --> 02:27:59.080]
You're supposed to be right on top of it.

[02:27:59.300 --> 02:27:59.940]
Charles Nagy?

[02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:01.700]
No, not Charles Nagy.

[02:28:01.800 --> 02:28:04.640]
Okay, although there used to be a guy named Steve Nagy who was a bull.

[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:06.800]
Remember, championship bowling with BuzzFazio?

[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:06.960]
No.

[02:28:07.220 --> 02:28:09.080]
And Thurmond Gibson and Eddie Koalik's.

[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:09.620]
Of course you know it.

[02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:10.140]
See you don't know.

[02:28:10.340 --> 02:28:11.620]
And there you have Fred Wolff.

[02:28:11.760 --> 02:28:12.860]
You see the way this works, George?

[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:13.820]
What?

[02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:14.520]
Fred Wolff.

[02:28:15.220 --> 02:28:15.540]
WXYZ.

[02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:17.200]
He tried to put him on there, Fred Wolff.

[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:23.240]
It's just unbelievable to me because he used to be the host of championship bowling in Detroit on WXYZ TV Channel 7.

[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:26.160]
How about it?

[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:27.140]
Okay, here comes some numbers.

[02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:28.600]
Now this is interesting.

[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:31.400]
These are like a little on the cock-eyed side, a little cock-a.

[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:32.980]
W-L-Y-F.

[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:36.540]
Oh, this doesn't vote too well when life is number one in Persons 12 plus.

[02:28:37.140 --> 02:28:37.540]
Slush.

[02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:39.180]
Light FM in the summertime.

[02:28:39.500 --> 02:28:40.160]
6.5.

[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:41.080]
Does anybody believe it?

[02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:41.240]
No.

[02:28:41.380 --> 02:28:41.560]
No.

[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:41.900]
No.

[02:28:41.900 --> 02:28:43.740]
There's a lot of people going to the doctor.

[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:44.760]
Huh?

[02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:45.460]
400.

[02:28:46.440 --> 02:28:47.040]
400 what?

[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:48.060]
Dollars.

[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:50.820]
Oh, we got $400 and almost an hour to go out there with Miguel.

[02:28:50.820 --> 02:28:53.760]
He's at Pino Town in Carpet, 2101 Western Land of Ovarian Poppano.

[02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:54.780]
Get by there fast.

[02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:56.960]
Bring some cash for a band and pay rescue.

[02:28:57.960 --> 02:28:58.920]
W-I-O-D.

[02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.280]
Now where the hell is Q-I-M on here?

[02:29:00.380 --> 02:29:00.860]
Are we still on here?

[02:29:00.940 --> 02:29:01.500]
Oh, look at that!

[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:02.600]
George?

[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:03.840]
I didn't look.

[02:29:03.980 --> 02:29:05.020]
I just stuck everything right in the faculty.

[02:29:05.020 --> 02:29:05.820]
Look at that.

[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:06.280]
You'll tell me.

[02:29:06.280 --> 02:29:07.740]
This is 12 plus in the afternoon.

[02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:10.680]
We went from 2.3 from number 20 to 3.1.

[02:29:10.760 --> 02:29:11.280]
That's the Humber.

[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.320]
Nice going, Humber.

[02:29:12.660 --> 02:29:14.060]
And he's actually working today.

[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:15.720]
Why are you saying me?

[02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:17.200]
I mean, you're saying me whatever you got, right?

[02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:18.940]
I just stuck the stack of the facts.

[02:29:19.280 --> 02:29:20.040]
So how are they looking?

[02:29:20.080 --> 02:29:21.180]
Who's bringing these into you?

[02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:21.540]
Josh.

[02:29:22.140 --> 02:29:22.740]
Josh and Humber.

[02:29:23.380 --> 02:29:23.700]
Please?

[02:29:24.380 --> 02:29:24.700]
Displeased?

[02:29:25.420 --> 02:29:26.660]
Josh Cortis is bringing them in.

[02:29:26.800 --> 02:29:27.540]
Oh, Josh Cortis.

[02:29:27.620 --> 02:29:28.180]
Well, what the hell is he?

[02:29:28.240 --> 02:29:29.440]
He's a good guy, but he knows nothing.

[02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:30.740]
And he's never wanted it.

[02:29:31.480 --> 02:29:32.100]
W-I-O-D.

[02:29:32.200 --> 02:29:32.980]
Look at this midday.

[02:29:33.060 --> 02:29:33.540]
Not too good.

[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:34.100]
12 plus.

[02:29:34.800 --> 02:29:35.880]
3, 4 to 3, 5.

[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:36.520]
So about flat.

[02:29:38.060 --> 02:29:38.360]
Okay.

[02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:40.300]
Well, bring this day about flat and 12 plus.

[02:29:40.300 --> 02:29:41.160]
We're not doing too bad.

[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:41.860]
We'll be not doing it.

[02:29:41.860 --> 02:29:42.680]
What about I-O-D here?

[02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:44.120]
4 and 9 to 4, 5.

[02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:45.020]
So they went down a little bit.

[02:29:45.300 --> 02:29:47.500]
We went up, what I say, 10 to the point and 12 plus.

[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:48.940]
Okay, that's okay.

[02:29:49.320 --> 02:29:49.480]
Uh-huh.

[02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:50.040]
That's a bit over.

[02:29:50.200 --> 02:29:51.020]
So where did we have the big increase?

[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:51.740]
The Humber.

[02:29:52.520 --> 02:29:54.740]
The Humber had the big increase in now.

[02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:55.440]
Ha, ha, ha.

[02:29:55.440 --> 02:29:55.520]
Ha, ha.

[02:29:55.520 --> 02:29:56.020]
You're like that.

[02:29:56.260 --> 02:29:56.960]
That was Friday.

[02:29:58.660 --> 02:30:00.440]
So all of these are going to have to come in now.

[02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:01.120]
10 to 3.

[02:30:01.240 --> 02:30:02.460]
How about, let's see.

[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:05.140]
I mean, this is really pretty useless.

[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:06.240]
I mean, I didn't want them.

[02:30:06.340 --> 02:30:07.260]
You asked and I said yes.

[02:30:08.520 --> 02:30:10.300]
Can I start sleeping this together now?

[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:12.420]
I'm pretty organized.

[02:30:12.640 --> 02:30:12.960]
You'd be amazed.

[02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:13.340]
There you go.

[02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:14.220]
There's the 3 to 7.

[02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:15.920]
Here's the 10 to 3.

[02:30:16.020 --> 02:30:17.860]
You wonder who's number one in midday and 12 plus.

[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:18.380]
Life.

[02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:19.860]
7.7.

[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:20.500]
Life.

[02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:21.400]
Slush.

[02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:24.060]
The music of somebody else's life and hopefully not yours.

[02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:25.080]
Boring.

[02:30:25.580 --> 02:30:26.060]
Terminal.

[02:30:26.720 --> 02:30:26.980]
Life.

[02:30:28.720 --> 02:30:29.620]
CMQ FM.

[02:30:30.120 --> 02:30:31.520]
It's from a 5.4 to a 5.0.

[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:32.340]
Oh!

[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:33.780]
Gloves 94.

Paul and old Ron from a 5 3 to a 6.6 how did that happen Q a m oh here's here it is

[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.380]
here's the meat and potatoes right here there's everything you want to know

[02:40:53.380 --> 02:40:56.940]
boys and girls right here everything this is the moment I've been waiting for

[02:40:56.940 --> 02:41:03.580]
absolutely six to 10 a m from a 3.4 in a spring book before for real and now a

[02:41:04.120 --> 02:41:12.120]
5.3 from numbers from tied for 12 to number three so let's say you take

[02:41:12.120 --> 02:41:19.320]
5.3 and double it okay that's 10.6 so I would say that for else got about an

[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:26.980]
eight and mose got a 2.6 a 2 pay 2 pay 6 now now what you'll see okay when you

[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:33.720]
after that it's hot and radio I'm more in all these other no speaking

[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:39.800]
lay stations okay in the morning I might have to refill my paper back there

[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:44.000]
you're just facts and just tons and tons of crap now what about that Fox Sports

[02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:48.480]
would all make it a big move from a point six in a morning to a 1.3 in men

[02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:52.640]
2554 they're doing it and you know what that's all resolved out can I give you

[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:57.300]
like a little clue as who's responsible for that yeah for that big improvement

[02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:01.820]
in the morning that's where you see some alarm truck problems yeah I forgot

[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:07.280]
over the top they're doing they're doing a big number as the crow flies of course

[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:12.560]
now that baseball is over what the last you know men 2554 midday QAM

[02:42:12.560 --> 02:42:17.640]
proudly we say from a six point we were a number look at that how is that

[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:22.140]
possible well that's right because that was a 10 to 3 thing right and we were a

[02:42:22.140 --> 02:42:26.120]
9 to 1 back in those days it was awful ugly days you see the difference there

[02:42:26.120 --> 02:42:31.020]
Greg if you screwed around with a show and you had us on 9 to 1 from a 6.6 and

[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:36.120]
be number two and attend the three time period to an 8.0 and

[02:42:36.120 --> 02:42:37.880]

mad dog is laying out.

[03:06:07.860 --> 03:06:08.800]
We don't have that till Monday,

[03:06:08.900 --> 03:06:10.300]
but it's got to be a little bit better, don't it?

[03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:10.520]
No.

[03:06:10.620 --> 03:06:12.720]
Just a little teeny tiny bit, like maybe a tenth of a point,

[03:06:12.820 --> 03:06:13.200]
something like that.

[03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:14.920]
Like a few more listeners.

[03:06:15.120 --> 03:06:15.960]

[03:06:28.020 --> 03:06:31.160]
I mean, how could he possibly even come in there with a straight push, right?

[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:32.560]
He will.

[03:06:32.760 --> 03:06:36.080]
If he's putting clues and trees and for else got like sevens and eights,

[03:06:36.100 --> 03:06:37.600]
what kind of a look is he going to have on his push?

[03:06:37.900 --> 03:06:38.440]
He'll have a gate.

[03:06:38.700 --> 03:06:38.820]
Look.

[03:06:39.280 --> 03:06:40.020]
Is that the way it'll be?

[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:40.600]
Absolutely.

[03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:41.720]

[03:07:08.240 --> 03:07:08.920]

Won't see him no more.

[03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:11.320]
Either one of them is matter of fact.

[03:07:11.640 --> 03:07:13.900]
Steve Bartkin and Moe, they can both leave now together.

[03:07:14.120 --> 03:07:16.840]
Like Tom Likus in the trunk of the car late at night, about three in the morning.

[03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:18.860]
WDQIN.

[03:07:20.220 --> 03:07:20.980]
Baseball blows.

[03:07:20.980 --> 03:07:21.200]
Oh.

[03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:25.580]
Now you know something, I am so ecstatic.

[03:07:26.320 --> 03:07:28.920]
I'm so delirious and so happy about that.

[03:07:28.960 --> 03:07:31.700]
That just before the end of the show today, on a day when South Florida,

[03:07:31.700 --> 03:07:34.480]
according to all reports, it's supposed to be euphoric.

[03:07:34.660 --> 03:07:35.940]
Everybody wants free tickets.

[03:07:35.940 --> 03:07:37.320]
Everybody wants paid tickets.

[03:07:37.720 --> 03:07:37.980]
Anything.

[03:07:38.160 --> 03:07:39.280]
They all want on a bad wagon.

[03:07:39.500 --> 03:07:42.120]
And just before we get out of here, baseball blows.

[03:07:42.880 --> 03:07:45.680]
Another good positive call from the assholes in South Florida.

[03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:46.660]
Man, it's unbelievable.

[03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:51.660]
This guy could go out in a backyard, find $10 million in small bills unmarked.

[03:07:52.520 --> 03:07:53.840]
Oh, this really blows.

[03:07:54.180 --> 03:07:55.720]
What am I going to do with all this money?

[03:07:55.980 --> 03:07:57.200]
Where am I going to hide it?

[03:07:57.840 --> 03:07:58.920]
Give my mother's phone number.

[03:07:59.940 --> 03:08:01.640]
They make a beautiful couple.

[03:08:01.820 --> 03:08:02.300]
I'm not serious.

[03:08:02.520 --> 03:08:03.140]
I'm going to give it all to you.

[03:08:03.500 --> 03:08:03.500]

[03:08:03.800 --> 03:08:06.360]
She could take a wet dream and turn it into a nightmare.

[03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:08.780]
Unbelievable.

[03:08:08.840 --> 03:08:09.460]
Nice going, my.

[03:08:09.660 --> 03:08:10.100]
And this guy too.

[03:08:10.300 --> 03:08:11.420]
Probably heard you in a voice.

[03:08:13.300 --> 03:08:13.620]
WDQIN.

[03:08:14.640 --> 03:08:15.560]
Hey, what's going on, buddy?

[03:08:15.560 --> 03:08:16.480]
Yes, sir.

[03:08:16.800 --> 03:08:17.820]
It's Rick from Miami.

[03:08:18.920 --> 03:08:19.240]
Who?

[03:08:20.160 --> 03:08:21.060]
It's Rick from Miami.

[03:08:21.740 --> 03:08:22.060]
Yeah.

[03:08:22.900 --> 03:08:24.700]
Hey, what's going on, Neil?

[03:08:26.180 --> 03:08:27.220]
Is this Rick from Miami?

[03:08:28.540 --> 03:08:29.720]
Is this Rick from Miami?

[03:08:29.900 --> 03:08:30.200]
I'll be there.

[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:31.820]
That's not like Rick from Miami, didn't it, George?

[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:32.300]
I don't know.

[03:08:32.360 --> 03:08:33.440]
Might have been Rick from Miami.

[03:08:33.460 --> 03:08:33.860]
From Miami?

[03:08:34.840 --> 03:08:35.160]
WDQIN.

[03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:37.320]
Bill Dean from the old WFU went.

[03:08:37.660 --> 03:08:38.660]
It's another name for the list.

[03:08:38.780 --> 03:08:39.480]
He used to be in WFU.

[03:08:39.820 --> 03:08:40.300]
Bill Dean.

[03:08:40.700 --> 03:08:41.160]
Bill Dean.

[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:42.320]
Bill Dean.

[03:08:42.480 --> 03:08:43.660]
Bill Dean from WFU went.

[03:08:44.020 --> 03:08:45.560]
Okay, well calm down, jeez.

[03:08:45.800 --> 03:08:46.900]
He sound like you got Russia's supply.

[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:49.500]
Yeah, the movie's got, he's got Will miss phone number.

[03:08:50.040 --> 03:08:50.500]
Bill Dean.

[03:08:50.720 --> 03:08:51.100]
I don't know that.

[03:08:51.180 --> 03:08:53.300]
I know Joe Dean used to work on WBF and Rochester.

[03:08:53.300 --> 03:08:54.620]
I know the BZBs.

[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:56.940]
Joe Dean and Morton this bomb.

[03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:01.200]
Can you imagine if your name was NUSBOM going on the year with name like that?

[03:09:01.460 --> 03:09:01.640]
Oi.

[03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:02.740]
Exactly.

[03:09:03.360 --> 03:09:04.360]
Morton this bomb and Joe Dean.

[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:09.060]
Who's the other one who used to be on there with the home of the BZBs WBBF in Rochester.

[03:09:09.660 --> 03:09:12.220]
With a signal at night time, the signal used to go straight up into the air.

[03:09:12.220 --> 03:09:12.920]
Something like that.

[03:09:13.500 --> 03:09:15.720]
I think we got enough names on there to make it worth a while.

[03:09:15.780 --> 03:09:16.360]
Just pick one.

[03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.280]
Okay, if yours is none, they're just pick one of these.

[03:09:18.440 --> 03:09:18.620]
Okay?

[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:21.840]
If you don't know any of them, talk to somebody like over the age of five.

[03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:23.520]
We can tell you a little bit about radio.

[03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:28.060]
Of course, we know that radio blows, baseball blows, many of the calls blow.

[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:29.180]
There's no question about that.

[03:09:29.620 --> 03:09:30.960]
I blow you blow, Scott Blow.

[03:09:31.000 --> 03:09:31.180]
Right.

[03:09:31.620 --> 03:09:33.340]
Well, I think I got to both be on that.

[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:33.940]
I'm sure.

[03:09:34.360 --> 03:09:40.380]
Wolfman Jack 76, Rick Schroff 59, Kate Curry 25, Jorgwernel 17, cousin Bruce C. 17, Larry

[03:09:40.380 --> 03:09:41.320]
Lujack 16.

[03:09:41.460 --> 03:09:42.460]
I'll give you the double digit numbers.

[03:09:43.320 --> 03:09:48.660]
Sunny Fox 15, Mordekay 13, Dick Perton 12, and Dick Beyondy has got 10.

[03:09:49.160 --> 03:09:52.600]
The big O is coming up next and there's nothing we can do about it.

[03:09:52.600 --> 03:09:53.460]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:09:53.900 --> 03:09:58.220]
The New Russia Show on Tyson, on the QAF, Miami for Lurethale.

[03:09:58.600 --> 03:10:01.900]
I'll give back all the business you've gotten from me over the last year and a half.

[03:10:02.180 --> 03:10:02.840]
May I make it up?

[03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:03.220]
May it be up to you.
