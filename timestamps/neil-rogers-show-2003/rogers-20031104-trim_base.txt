[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]
Told 45 triple D. Yeah, I mean Jesus Neil if you got a 30 AD you got a

[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.880]
Bad just like me man

[00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.260]
So Greg like he's bringing a

[00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.900]
No Greg reads some free tickets to the game

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.000]
They told me this morning or yesterday. I'm supposed to meet with Greg read again

[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.740]
And it turns out he's sick for the 15th week in a row. Where is he in Europe? Good? Keep him sick. He's probably an Amsterdam

[00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.820]
I don't know where he is. I can't they told me I got a me with him

[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.780]
But he's not here ever. I don't think they let him into Amsterdam. Hey, you know, here's Philis back there

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.600]
She's what we're gonna put stamp him with a reject on top of his head on his balls, but here's Philis back there

[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.040]
She's she's secure. I said to her this morning. Oh, where's Greg?

[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.480]
He's outside

[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.780]
I

[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.540]
Read you want to go downstairs and smoke a butt. I

[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.520]
Love that woman she said her butt on fire. I'll tell you that when the settling torch

No, you know that red head in there. I mean I gotta tell you what that I follow that girl around she thinks

[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.260]
I'm just walking behind her. I don't have any idea who that is. I'm sure you don't in the great that I miss out on all these

[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.820]
The girl with the nozzle we got in there some girl

[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.100]
Nozzly she's got a nozzling nozzling. Yeah, nozzling's very nice. She's a nice person white. I'd wax her up in about 20 seconds

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.920]
They didn't want but she wouldn't say it in line. I take a number dude every time I I lay eyes on her that girl says

[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.500]
Oh, I know he's got a pack

[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.400]
Yeah, you write language for nozzling nozzly

[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.200]
Nozzly I'm nozzling. Hey, George. How's it? How's the corporate party George little nozzly? No, you're business

[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.000]
But you did bring her pen and you do those what do you think I didn't go?

[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.260]
We have a secret silence pack during those part of our way things

[00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.200]
What goes on here stager? What are you and what are you in delusional and Vegas? Yeah, that's right

[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.340]
What goes on here stays here? No, it doesn't anything you tell him anything you tell him's going out over the wire right

[00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.400]
I noticed you're not talking about the Patriots

[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.080]
It's really the Patriots. What a win-win lesson. I was talking about this woman

[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.680]
We did it baby. Yeah, we did

[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.340]
What about the lady that suit paid manning for when he moondr what would you do if a

[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.080]
Trainer suits you for when he moondr now I said this morning that you probably you wouldn't suit Tom ready to be moond

[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.400]
You would he no, no, that'd be a good ask to see I would thank him. I'd slap money ass saying I was going Tom

[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000]
Baby, he'd sue you. Yeah, hey listen

[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.840]
Don't be nice just because he's a pretty boy. See nobody takes him serious. That's the problem

[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.400]
Yeah, I think I'm serious ugly like Jay Fielor in the Brian Grease

[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.400]
Oh my god, I can see a feedlers nose for two weeks and like the

[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.880]
Swissow I want to burst anybody's bubble in South Florida

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.920]
But you realize they are gonna lose the dolphins the Tennessee and Baltimore

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.700]
There's no contest to Raven so that's two that's five and five right there for more. I'm sitting I agree with that

[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.840]
I've said both of those wins and I also hit the Patriot game last night because then but I'm quarterbacks

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.420]
But you know they got that game nice and close

[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.660]
But let's face it. There's at least five teams in the AFC better in the Dolphins. It's all that's aren't going anywhere

[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.820]
So you're giving away tickets for the Kings and the Panthers and that's gonna goose you to attend it something what about

[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.840]
100 who cares how many people go do I go to the bar and drink and I love

[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.900]
Like of all people of all people you want your funny Scott there boy

[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.100]
He sure scamming a lot of them. How about you?

[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.420]
You used to say like you don't care me while you watch the leaves get their butts just

[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.340]
Dushed seven to one about we defeated the powerful Carolina Hercunes on Sunday

[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.580]
Oh, yeah, but would you have to go back seven or one day or two your life?

[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.340]
What how many games of the leaves one two or three five? Oh, man, they're really taken

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.340]
See the league by storm what do I have to say 19?

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.200]
One the Panthers their plan is to win 10 home games

[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.220]
What you know about hockey man you can put in a symbol and have room for the beast ass left over in there for me

[00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.400]
You just don't know your hockey. Oh, yeah, is that right your buddy Scott though knows hockey

[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.000]
Let me tell you if you didn't have your little hockey button to hit there with all the sound and if you didn't watch that

[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.780]
Talentless hack team up there you wouldn't know anything about hockey you know more about

[00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.920]
Ten at least I'm honestly I tell you what my

[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.400]
Please I know I'm not like the South Florida fan. We're gonna go to the Super Bowl. Yeah, all of a sudden

[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.260]
Bullquad listen, I don't do that. I take the Marlins to the world championship

[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.260]
And I'll talk hockey with you any day. I told you the Marlins are gonna win the series and you told me no chance

[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.160]
I told you that a listen dude

[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.460]
And now a sudden you're gonna start taking credit for the Marlins when you bash them every day like they were freaking homeless

[00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.620]
Every day you make fun of the Marlins

[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.420]
It's a make fun of the owners and I make fun of the people who want to use public money to build a mistake

[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.220]
Oh, no, no, let's go back to you make it fun of their crowds every night like you're doing now with the Panthers

[00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.240]
First you made fun of the Marlins seats now you're making fun of the Panthers

[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.120]
Now you're gonna make fun of the eat and then I can make fun of games because I'm a homophobe

[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.380]
Yeah, get a sun pass on me and happy up and birthday

[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.580]
Need you how many candles you got tomorrow there Neil? It's glad to dinner you're welcher

[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.540]
But good man, and I'll talk hockey with you any day. I'll talk so much hockey

[00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.400]
Your team will fall on you, blue liner and have a great day shot score

[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.460]
When the big tournament money's on the line

[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.720]
Professional women choose macho tennis balls

[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.740]
macho

[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.400]
We give women the balls to win

[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.100]
She looks like a guy

[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.840]
She's seven feet wide

[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.800]
She makes me want to destroy

[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.020]
A chick with a dick

[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.980]
With two smelly chins

[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.840]
Uploaded and ugly fat dick

[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.220]
She wants to be the other stop's a fusing

[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.040]
And with the current as with songs like this

[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.120]
But we find that amusing

[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.640]
From that self-promoting ugly bitch

[00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:13.660]
How much were you paid?

[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.480]
For monochistay

[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.680]
By Richard Z. Melons' gang

[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.860]
Look what women living in the...

[00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.680]
The heads are fast and clean

[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.440]
I wish you always remember your love

[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.280]
I'm just like everyone if you haven't

[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.800]
I'm a human tree citizen!

[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:43.140]
Just do what you think, you're fooling

[00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.300]
You battle golfers, ugly smelly pig

[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.100]
You're really mad ruckian hunters

[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.820]
Oh, yeah.

[00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.700]
It's a bad thing.

[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.820]
Then I waited five, six, six years of disgusting fat pig.

[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.160]
Everybody despises Linda.

[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.000]
Tripped the only bad news is she's got 600 grand down that the government's going to give her.

[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:05.600]
Bitch.

[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.480]
Federal government yesterday announced it's paying Linda trip in her attorneys 595 grand,

[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:14.540]
the subtle allegations that the Department of Defense violated her privacy rights

[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.540]
when confidential information about her was disclosed during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.620]
That bitch with the blue dress and the stain on it.

[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.960]
And let me say it.

[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.640]
It's just, you know, there's some things that are so obvious.

[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.260]
It's like staring at a big gigantic ass, you know, like Josh Friedman moaning you.

[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.660]
You know, it's like the people in the media don't see it.

[00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.480]
They see it.

[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.300]
Like Monica Lewinsky.

[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.060]
You know the same thing.

[00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.560]
How come it is that this bitch who saved the blue dress?

[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.420]
What kind of a slut saves the dress?

[00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.000]
Doesn't take it to the cleaners even with the stain on it.

[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.540]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.560]
I told her that.

[00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.740]
I told her that.

[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.600]
And of course it was her mother who told us save the dress, save the evidence.

[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.480]
Okay, we can make a lot of cash off of this.

[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.760]
Sounds pretty Jewish to me.

[00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.660]
In addition, the government agreed directly actively give trip three annual outstanding

[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.260]
performance evaluations for her work at the Department of Defense increasing the value of her retirement.

[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:02.520]
How do you like that, bitch?

[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:03.320]
I don't.

[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:08.220]
Trips suit the government when Pentagon officials leaked information from the government background investigation about her,

[00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:12.560]
which included the fact that she was arrested as a juvenile in case of involving drinking booze.

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.540]
She was never charged.

[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:14.280]
How do you like that?

[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:25.860]
Tripp became widely known as the woman who taped conversations with Monica Lewinsky document the White House intern secret relationship with then president Bill Clinton her disclosure that they've self paved the way for Clinton's impeachment.

[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.540]
We got a president right now who ought to be impeached and convicted in about 10 minutes is what they ought to be doing.

[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.080]
We got more dead troops over there by the way, just in case anybody cares, which I don't think they do.

[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:36.540]
No, no.

[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:44.140]
As US troops continue to scour Iraq for anti-aircraft missiles following Sunday's daily helicopter ambushed of killed 16 troops.

[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.320]
Why did they say 16?

[00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:45.880]
It was 17.

[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.080]
You know, you're right.

[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.880]
It was 16 originally and then one of the injured died.

[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.580]
But when he would say give us the numbers on the injured, but when they died, they never include those in the dead number.

[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.460]
No, they don't know how many have died.

[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:00.020]
It's just like, well, they were injured lightly, a lot bad.

[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:00.900]
But they don't call us.

[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:02.140]
Arms blown off, blinded.

[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.040]
Anyway, is there scouring?

[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.640]
Fresh attacks on coalition forces and bagged that into creed, killed two American soldiers. This is two more.

[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.620]
US military officials said today.

[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:19.320]
Two other soldiers from the first armored division were wounded during the Baghdad roadside bombing today, while the tecrete attack left one of the soldiers wounded.

[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.720]
But they never say seriously wounded, mortally wounded, nothing.

[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.000]
You know what I mean?

[00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:26.760]
Same old bull crap.

[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.860]
It just doesn't stop.

[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.140]
And the public is, the movie with nobody seems to care.

[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.620]
And the Democrats rule over and play dead.

[00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:36.880]
We don't want to deny our troops the money because they're all scared, smittless men.

[00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:42.180]
So they go ahead and rubber stamp that $87 billion while people in America are starving to death, have no jobs.

[00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.260]
Part time jobs.

[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.600]
Part time jobs have gone up like crazy.

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.420]
I should point out to you.

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.860]
So all these statistics about the job.

[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.780]
It's bull crap.

[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.860]
It's all just window dressing.

[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.040]
It's just games with numbers.

[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.180]
Speaking of games, poor Miss Kamala, the weather fairy, a channel seven.

[00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.400]
She has her problems.

[00:09:59.580 --> 00:09:59.860]
You know what?

[00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.380]
I think they're out to get her.

[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.400]
Bill Kamala, the WSVN channel seven's chief meteorologist, was arrested over the weekend and charges is driving out of influence of alcohol.

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.400]
According to Fort Lauderdale police.

[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.820]
Police say the saw miss Kamala driving his black Jaguar northbound on C-Breeze Boulevard around 1245 Sunday morning.

[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:25.780]
After stopping the car at a green light, Kamala drove 10 miles below the post at 35 mile an hour speed limit and swerved through the street according to the police report.

[00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.080]
After police stopped him around 130 in the morning, Kamala took three roads.

[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.400]
I test and failed them.

[00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.320]
And by the way, Bill, John still ain't interested.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.620]
In the final one, he missed the tip of his nose on five of six attempts for Lauderdale police officer Craig Butterrey wrote in his report.

[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.140]
Kamala 46, who was stopped at 850 C-Bees Boulevard as buttery, if he should have a lawyer present.

[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.580]
Did he get stopped by a cop who was buttery?

[00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.420]
No.

[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.020]
I've been stopped by cops who buttered me up a little bit.

[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.220]
Buttery, I have.

[00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.340]
Oh, you're near Rajas. Hey, have a nice day.

[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.820]
Those are the ones who liked me, of course. That's just luck.

[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.200]
Buttery told him roadside test of voluntary method is refusal to be used as evidence against him.

[00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:08.680]
Kamala agreed to a breath test, which revealed a 0.153 and 0.159 blood alcohol level well above the 0.08 legal limit.

[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:15.880]
Kamala posted $500 body spent eight hours behind bars and BSO spokeswoman Vita Coleman Wright.

[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:27.000]
Three years ago, he faced similar DUI charges when an FHP trooper found Kamala's silvered IDH heavy Corvette against the concrete barrier in the Westbound lane of I-595 near US-1.

[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.200]
Those charges were reduced to reckless driving.

[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.820]
For the record, last time was a wrongful arrest and I'm sure he was shown not to be guilty.

[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.960]
Since Kamala's attorney Guillermo Pena, this time again it'll show was another wrongful arrest.

[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.060]
Mr. Pena got Pena.

[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.540]
It was unclear yesterday afternoon how Kamala's arrest would affect his job.

[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.900]
Our policy, not to comment on personnel matter, said Charlie Fools spokesman for WSVN Channel.

[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:53.660]
He was in a movie like Haja Fools, Charlie Fools and Bill Drinks.

[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.000]
What can I tell you? I don't know what the circumstances really were.

[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.800]
He just seemed to have this recurring situation and we wish him all the best in the world, whether for a number two.

[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.140]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.260]
Not too crazy about him or about Miss Norcross.

[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:10.240]
We like Don No.

[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.320]
And we like Bob Soeper, right?

[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:15.340]
And my good friend Bob Weaver, who they relegated to the old folks home.

[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:15.580]
What?

[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:16.580]
Absolutely.

[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:17.500]
Absolutely.

[00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.700]
Absolutely.

[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.280]
See there's some old folks we like and then of course there's some we don't.

[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:22.660]
Absolutely.

[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.860]
10th at Ma, Mo, Ma and Mo, anybody with like an M?

[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:27.320]
Mother?

[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.000]
1013 at 560 WQM.

[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.300]
I'm Sura, I f***ing think.

[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:32.700]
Oh!

[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.800]
This is Mary Ellen Fish Box.

[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:41.820]
And I saw my opponent, Mort Morton, and his New York City Boises, run over a monkey.

[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:48.240]
My opponent, Mary Ellen Fish Box, has her period three out of four weeks a month.

[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:54.920]
My opponent, Mort Morton, got fired from the mall for sexually harassing a mannequin.

[00:12:54.920 --> 00:13:01.040]
Well, my opponent, Mary Ellen Fish Box, eats leftover fruit from box glasses.

[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.860]
My opponent, Mort Morton, is impoted.

[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.040]
My opponent, Mary Ellen Fish Box, never offer to reach around.

[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.700]
My opponent, Mort Morton, is sterile!

[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.000]
You're frigid b****.

[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:23.160]
Get laid in granite's village if your spooge was a cure for AIDS!

[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.440]
But you're a lesbian.

[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.020]
You're a decent cramp!

[00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.200]
You're a no good skig!

[00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:32.960]
I'm dead spigger!

[00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:36.920]
Thanks for, my friends, Mort Morton and Mary Ellen Fish Box.

[00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:37.880]
Don't forget the...

[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.580]
Don't we have another one of them debates coming up tonight?

[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.980]
I don't know.

[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.020]
What's the point?

[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:49.880]
Is that what it is?

[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.140]
What's the point?

[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.940]
What are they going to say?

[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.960]
Have a couple of debates and it's like every week.

[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.640]
Here's another debate.

[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.100]
Now, if I guess, is it still nine?

[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.540]
How many have we got?

[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.260]
I really don't know.

[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.120]
Since Bobby Graham dropped out, plus Bobby Graham went for the Senate again.

[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:03.940]
How many have we got?

[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.260]
You got Dean and Clark.

[00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:07.180]
Right, that's two.

[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.760]
You got Lieberman's a Jew.

[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.980]
You got Carrie, who's scary.

[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.880]
That's four, right?

[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.420]
Okay.

[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:13.300]
How many?

[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:14.180]
I'm sorry.

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.040]

[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:33.540]

[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.420]
I'm sorry, everyone.

[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.400]

[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.300]
By where you live, right?

[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.260]
There's a shell station on one side. What's it now?

[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:52.560]
Didn't we just get you doing that the location here not too long ago? I don't know. I'm sure we did

[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.380]
We did the shell station. That was a while back

[00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:57.420]
Yeah

[00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:04.700]
The mobile statement. Well, man. He's gonna rot in hell. I guarantee you that I mean he looks pretty good

[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.060]
But that ain't gonna help him when it comes time to the pro league gates

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.540]
And they're gonna say how do you screw over all them little dogs and cats that wind up dying?

[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.460]
He's gonna say well. I got no answer for that

[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.880]
No tango pie who in my

[00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:20.500]
Bracket them now. What is it? It's a mobile it's a mobile positive. Are you sure?

[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.060]
I bet that's okay. This is the demand family at the mobile gas station

[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.820]
Southeast corner Sheridan on 95 11 and one with Miguel you can straighten him out

[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:33.680]
If he lets you so that that's that now here's the poor result your take on that one in two hour

[00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:36.240]
I'm all forgetting rid of it get rid of it 436

[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.340]
40.7% now that's out of a thousand seventy and sounds pretty like like a mandate right right sounds pretty overwhelming

[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:49.220]
But whatever stop and think of it this way it all depends on like is the glass half full is it have empty does it have a crack in it?

[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:53.140]
Is it like chip then maybe a piece of glasses down inside of my cut your guts out in a good lawsuit?

[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:53.760]
You'll be dead

[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:58.920]
No way I love that one to two hour two hundred and fifty seven twenty four percent

[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:04.040]
I don't give a Schmidt two hundred and fifty three twenty three point six percent and I'd elicit I'll listen anyway

[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.660]
124 which is love 125 now 11.6 percent out of a thousand and seventy four

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.560]
So 40.7 say get rid of that one to our we don't want to hear that crap

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:19.900]
It's a cop out we want to hear you we want to make you guys work and but that means 59.3% said something else

[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.740]
Right, they like it or don't care right they like it. They don't care. They'll listen anyway

[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.100]
They got their radio stuff deep inside their armpit whatever they don't care

[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.280]
So it's like I don't know I

[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.540]
Have to sleep on it again tonight. I don't know Xamina. We can discuss it perhaps in fact. I have an emotional

[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:40.600]
email that you passed along which I'll read in a little bit

[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:48.620]
The Hague Netherlands a man entered the Turkish Embassy in Den Hague today and detonated a bomb that started a fire

[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:52.060]
But didn't do much damage the Turkish ambassador said just a little one

[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:59.000]
There were no reports of injuries said Mika swapping the Turkish Ambassador's Secretary the other that if I'd have to say

[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:05.340]
Yeah, a man with dark features be where those men with dark features. I'm telling you right now the dark are the more dangerous

[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.060]
What over there too? Oh?

[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:13.660]
Especially over there a man with dark features and wearing a black jacket at an embassy who was not speaking Turkish

[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.540]
He was speaking some Dutch he said also the leaf and he handed them a package

[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.280]
He said here you like my package

[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:24.440]
He exploded the bomb in the area that they call the man trap of course a lot of those in the middle

[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.320]
Then he managed to escape. I know what the man trap is

[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.100]
I'll bet that's kind of like the anteater

[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.480]
Turkey's ambassador to the Hague taken ill them told the private CNN Turk TV all of this crap

[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.980]
Jason buildings were evacuated surrounding streets were cordoned off in the Hague

[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:44.760]
Explosives and anti terrorism teams were at work of the scene Dutch TV reported the Turkish Embassy is located downtown in the Hague

[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:50.340]
Which is a very boring place. I'm told the seat of the Dutch government your problem in buildings and several other embassies a very very

[00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:52.520]
Pedestrian and boring in the kind of place and

[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.260]
Nothing no big deal 27 after 10 at 5 60 WQM

[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.320]
Speaking of no big deal who's the count is dry concepts now who's handling that do we know Troy?

[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.780]
Troy you are an asshole

[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.740]
You know I hate to say that because you'll make it into a racial thing or a bald guy thing or something

[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.580]
But you're just you're not doing your job man the date on this copy is seven seven. It's almost November 7

[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:19.200]
July August September October to mess four freaking months. I hope our friends at dry concepts are still running this special

[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.160]
I have no way of knowing because Troy ain't on the case

[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.720]
He's not in a case with pomp at a park that we still got that old outdated copy from last week

[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.980]
The sales department a QA and blows. I just want you to know that right now. They blow they suck

[00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.460]
They take it up the ass. Okay. There are pieces of crap. They're awful. They're got awful

[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.380]
What do you try to say? I say I hate them. I can't stand them. They just aren't doing it

[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:44.180]
I told I told Duffin Claret yesterday. Oh, and by the way, spin it up and clear it's we're taking a QM link off our website

[00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.960]
Eric take it off of there right now

[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.260]
I'll get into that I'm gonna talk about that because there's such a bunch of pussies around here

[00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:54.560]
And they don't realize the FCC doesn't regulate websites and damn good thing. They're not messing with ours

[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.780]
They don't need to be a subject. Don't even think about messing around with our website

[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.520]
But if they're too pacified to have a link on the QM website

[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.760]
Which is about how many hits a year do they have on it?

[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.140]
I think and we have like we got like a 1100 votes just our yesterday's second pool, right?

[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.780]
That's more vote hits than they get in a year

[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.060]
But if they're too pacified to be associated with our website

[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:17.560]
Well, guess what we're not gonna promote. There's either take let's take the link off of the Eric right now

[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:23.920]
That's Q and that nice big big prominent QA link screw them that sports crap there go the logo

[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.860]
That's right there go the logo and you won't see it no more

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.480]
Hey, when it comes down to have your carpets looking just like brand new again

[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:32.840]
Haven't cleaned with dry concepts because over 20 years now they've been doing in my house

[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.600]
They've been in town for about 24 years

[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.620]
I do believe and the reason they're still around is because they're the best carpet cleaning company in the world

[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:44.360]
You only want to dry cleanse your carpets and now dry concepts off as you a chance to say 15% on your next carpet cleaning

[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:50.920]
Just call them tool free 1 800 2 4 8 5 0 7 1 and ask them to put them down and put you understand by list

[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:55.500]
Then dry concepts will call you next time they have an opening in their schedule like when you fly a

[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500]
Standby it's the same idea if you're available when they have an opening

[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:04.860]

Vichel also starring Carl Witherz is to a cluttered ale and don't not says don't know

[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.660]
There's a stationary

[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.220]
Ronald that was

[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:28.840]
And

[00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:30.620]
She's

[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:31.780]
Made from the new

[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.160]
And

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.520]
Paul coming through

[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.700]
Kasmas macho bishop gene Robinson or and bishop

[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:46.340]
That would even be if she were still alive would even be a contest what it no no no no more contemporary

[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.100]
This is very depressing especially since they just show on these 16 soldiers killed on Sunday now

[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.840]
We got it was actually 17 one of the injured died and now we got two more today

[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.180]
See I there's so many that I keep it can't even keep track of the stories because right on a CNN website

[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:07.680]
There's another one they said was killed and I don't want to say that because I'm not sure if they're that's one of the two that they reported before or an additional one

[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:15.200]
It's just it's just become a numbers game just like Vietnam all over again every single day one here two there 16 or 17 on Sunday

[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.180]
And it just keeps mounting and mounting and building and building

[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:25.440]
And pot no vac on crossfire yesterday says oh well these are kids these are soldiers their soldiers on crossfire

[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:34.540]
Seriously I'd like to see him tired and feathered right on the area I pay I pay $50,000 to watch that I'll put tethered okay 10,000

[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:47.700]
No anyway in regard to that which is really morbid and grotesque and serious although nobody wants to get too morbid and grotesque and serious because it you know because then it forces them to take a look at the kind of insanity that we're waging around the world

[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:57.300]
The US military said yesterday it was sticking to a policy forbidding television camera crews and photographers from filming coffins of soldiers killed in Iraq at US Air Base in southwestern Germany

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:09.180]
A fierceless at Ramstein a major US Air Base which serves as a transfer point had a lot of media access in the past who honored guard ceremonies and transfers of American flag covered coffins out of the US bond military transport planes

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:21.120]
But the rules banning covering were strictly enforced just before the Iraq war began because it's bad PR we don't want the American public see in them coffins because we know there's dead kids in there arms dead soldiers in there

[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:36.220]
While US officials say the policy was created on a respect for relatives others criticized the lack of media access arguing it's aim is to prevent the public from seeing large numbers of coffins that could turn the public opinion against the war just like Vietnam all over again baby desi rule all over again

[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:49.300]
same crap and you people in the media every one of you ought to be in jail you ought to be in jail because just like you used the word yesterday there were whatever was the word used there are co conspirators right there are accomplices there are accomplices

[00:27:50.500 --> 00:28:06.200]
You ought to be on death row for murder right you can argue both sides there when US official who asked of course not to be identified some say Americans need to see this this is factual and the public needs to see the coffins yet you also think of a mom of a killed soldier in the trauma of seeing television pictures of her son being murdered

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:22.400]
and we repatriated journalist seeking access to Ramstein to film coffins of 15 Americans killed some in Iraq when they're now it's 15 see it keeps dwindling maybe they're coming back to life when your helicopter was shot down we're told that a prominent defense policy was still no only coverage of injured soldiers was permitted

[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:29.520]
and probably not those that are injured like real serious you know I mean right blow it off lens one of those may be got a hang mail something like that then it's okay

[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.660]
you talk about managing and here's the best example of them all this story and I know nobody's going to talk about it

[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:44.680]
this goes to show you the chilling effect that the Bush administration has on what's taking place in America and the world today

[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:56.940]
this is unbelievable the cowardly eye you can see the tears drooping dripping even ms. Fard says it's a black eye for CBS who already keeps reporting breakfast

[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:05.140]
closely since last night it's a done deal and I'm sure she's right the CNN story on her website says CBS may cancel Reagan miniseries

[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:11.160]
and it should say CBS it's just a matter of time today when they finally get the spine to make the announcement of how they're going to safe face

[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.060]
and why did they do this because they were pressured and doing it the Reagan miniseries

[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.600]
drawing Republican fire over the accuracy of the upcoming miniseries the Reagan CBS appears ready to present a kinder

[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.760]
gentler portrait of the ailing former president that originally produced if the network airs it at all

[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:38.100]
thank god they don't cave into pressure you know what I'm saying yeah this right here is the end the draw the line in the sand right here

[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:43.580]
this is the day that freedom of expression freedom of speech officially died in America

[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:52.540]
that the fascist who control the government now who stole it three years ago these fascists have totally silenced everybody and anybody who's against

[00:29:52.540 --> 00:30:00.500]
at least almost everybody sources close to the production said yesterday CBS is considering canceling the Dr. Dramma

[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:08.140]
slated air November 16th and 18 under mounting criticism from political conservatives that the two parts series unfairly depicts Reagan and his wife

[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:16.540]
meanwhile Hollywood trade paper daily variety reported that director Robert Allen Ackerman is quit the production over creative differences with CBS executives

[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:20.600]
who insisted on numerous last-minute alterations after the pressure started coming in

[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:27.040]
neither producers for the four-hour film nor Ackerman could immediately be reached for comment but sources familiar with the production told Reuters

[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.940]
that last-minute changes demanded by CBS are being made and that there was a chance the movie would could be moved to the network's sister

[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:39.220]
pay cable TV channel showtime if they bother showing it at all and of course showtime reaches a massive a million people around the country

[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:44.080]
in a country 270 million people in other words if they do are it nobody's going to see it

[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:52.540]
the manager for actor James Brolin who stars as Reagan the film said his client was refraining from taking part in promoting the many series at this point

[00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:58.280]
we don't know what movie they're putting out there or what they're doing or when they're doing with it Jeff Wal-Told Reuters

[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:01.660]
adding that Ackerman was not participating editing the final cut

[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:09.400]
Wal described executive producers Craig Satan and Neil Miran as credits include the Hill a hit film musical Chicago

[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:25.000]
as absolutely dismayed by the site unseen backlash he dismissed criticism from some that the many series as a hatchet job and denied that the filmmakers had any agenda in portraying Reagan other than to make a fair and balanced movie about who he was positive and negative

[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:35.020]
while the Viacamo network had no comment yesterday CBS chairman Leslie Moonviz told CNBC last week that there are some edits being made trying to present a more fair picture of the Reagans

[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:43.860]
right now the word change it at to try to pacify the right wingers and the administration the only comment from the Reagans themselves has come from former first lady Nancy Reagan

[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:50.620]
who made a brief statement issued last week to the Fox not the news channel and said the timing of the many series is absolutely staggering to me

[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:57.420]
obviously it's very hurtful she apparently was referring to the fact that the 92 year old former president is severely ill with Alzheimer's disease

[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.420]
has that been going on for a while?

[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:01.340]
how many years has he had that?

[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.240]
about 30 men

[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:11.680]
Moonviz is expected to decide in a few days I think that I think it's going to be today they're going to decide whether to pull them any series from the network's November schedule

[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:16.320]
reschedule for a later date move it to show time or just burn burn it burn the evidence

[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.040]
how do you like that?

[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:23.520]

[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.160]
made to the project and the cool cries of heavy-handed political by-set the network

[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:40.900]
meanwhile Reagan daughter Patty Davis is considering a public comment of concern over liberty taken by CBS and telling the story of Ronald and Nancy Reagan

[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:49.460]
CBS senior vice president of movies and mini series Bella Bajaria is being blamed internally at the network for the growing backlash against the project

[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:55.040]
look it was going to be about the Reagan's their family and senior network source said a love story we lost control of it and

[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.600]
the transform in other words it was too much truth so you got to remember this is on the Fudge Report so he's got to make all the commentaries

[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:06.780]
like slanted in one way not the fact that the media is being censored here and it's CBS does making difference what they wanted to

[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:13.480]
present okay it's not the guy they're right wingers business called prior censorship which is even worse than post

[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:22.940]
censorship prior censorship absolutely outrageous anyway here's some of the you want should we read some of the script

[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:31.480]
yeah page 180 of the final Reagan script seen with Don Reagan talking to Michael Diver about Nancy Don Reagan

[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:36.960]
Reagan says so Diver tell me you've known Madam Führer a lot longer than I have how the hell you managed to put up with her

[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:47.040]
Madam Führer meaning Nancy with little red dress last week in Los Angeles former first lady Nancy Reagan with being described at close friends as discouraged over the film as controversial new details emerge

[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:55.320]
one of the most painful accusations raised in the CBS movie is that President Reagan was suffering from Alzheimer's disease nine years before he was diagnosed a charge Nancy is told

[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:04.520]
for instance and outrageous lie but on pages 185 and 86 with a scene with Nancy talking to Dr. Hutton the Reagan's position after Reagan's cancer surge

[00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:17.020]
in July of 85 in the hospital corridor Dr. Hutton says the good news is we cut it in early age meaning the Alzheimer's

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:25.460]
Nancy doctor do you think this could explain why Ronnie I mean some of his behavior Dr. Hutton what behavior Nancy his forgetfulness he's tired all the time Dr. Hutton you'd be

[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:36.060]
forgetful and tired if you were president of the United States to Nancy yes but he's not the same something's wrong this is an 85 86 he was president through 88 Dr. Hutton don't worry

[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:41.980]
Mrs. Reagan if something were wrong you we'd know about it say that just say no program yours getting a lot of play isn't it Nancy

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:48.960]
Dr. I'm trying to tell you Ronnie's not well Dr. Hutton of course he's not well he's just head surgery for cancer once he gets back on his feet maybe a little vacation

[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:53.960]
you'll see he'll be fine he's a warhorse Nancy trying not to believe trying to believe him thank you Dr.

[00:41:54.360 --> 00:42:00.680]
he gives her armor squeeze and heads down the hall Nancy stands there trying to collect yourself Kathy Osborne comes up to her with a cup of tea

[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:08.400]
Nancy's assistant here's your tea it's a little strong but you can add some milk to it and it'll be just fine Nancy turns to her bitterly

[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:15.400]
everybody keeps saying that it's fine everything's fine they tell me well everything's not fine it's not fine it's not he's

[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.460]
he's like that I like to like many of us suspect that he was suffering from Alzheimer's way back in the middle of his

[00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:28.960]
presidency early in the second term or maybe before that who the hell knows maybe when he was governor of California who knows

[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:36.460]
but God forbid we should be able to tell the American public the truth or what some people perceive as the truth no we can't do that we have to censor

[00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:42.620]
it and CBS is bending over man they're they're just spreading their cheeks all the CBS executives are bent over stark

[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:48.760]
naked with their cheeks spread okay stick it to me stick it to me you know like I laugh in socket to me stick it in there

[00:42:48.760 --> 00:43:03.880]
deep as you can man just absolutely unfreakable is it I believe it and a public is moving like that what kind of a

[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.880]
script to the government every day for the show and you know and then they could tell us oh well you can't say that and you

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:14.580]
certainly can't criticize the president and you can't say that about Heinrich Himmler of Rumsfeld that starts next year

[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:23.740]
oh is that it yeah bunch of communist crap part of patriotic forward in fact these people they got some nerve talking about Fidel they make him look

[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:36.200]
pretty good you know it is a bastion of freedom and free speech damn it anyway here's the email that you sent from Steve who says

[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:42.580]
hi Neil I hope one of these gets through can't spend hours trying to call please please please please for a police don't

[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:48.520]
discontinue the comedy bits they are hilarious and yet insightful the best of them affording you in your core

[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:57.300]
or it's a cohort's a way to make a point beyond simply stating it also that's what first attracted me to the show and that's one of the few remaining bastions of intelligent and independent thinking in South Florida

[00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:05.520]
absolutely correct in particular was kiss and eager good morning that I heard as I was driving through the greater well larger Miami area on my way down to live in T West last fall

[00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:12.360]
I've been a frequent listener ever since driving over to the beach every morning with a receptionist better but you won't be hearing that bit again of course Steve because we can't play it

[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:23.380]
my favorite parody is weapons of mass destruction which is absolutely run on both politically and musically I even spent the time in effort to table with my rudimentary equipment and replay it so I could learn it and play it on the streets and at Mallory Square

[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:32.300]
hoping to wake up some some I combatose minds in a process please continue the bits I'm sorry I only have one vote even in Florida but I hope this counts for more no problem Steve

[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:48.420]
Maryam elephant will send you a whole bunch of ballots and bear in mind ultimately you decide what to do on your show not the income poops I mean well informed citizens who call in your polls myself included PS I wish you put a track listing of the best of Neil Rogers on the website your perspective bars to make an informed decision well

[00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:55.380]

[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:05.440]

[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:39.640]
They show a newspaper headline in the movie in a miniseries newspaper photo of Reagan Nancy Doria and Ron

[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:46.220]
Ron Jr. The ballet dancer all smiling broadly arms about each other the headline players. He's not gay. He says proud Papa

[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.240]
We don't want to see that do it. Oh no God forbid

[00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:54.280]
That Ronnie Ray he has a wife. You know Ronnie Reagan Jr

[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.320]
What's his day again? So did rock Hudson Jim neighbors?

[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.800]
Anyway, here's an interesting story. Don't be fooled us from the same Pete times at John. Thank you John facts to us

[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:09.600]
Don't be fooled lottery is not helping education as it proclaims worst bet in the world biggest sucker bet

[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:15.680]
You got a better chance of going to Vegas and winning 50 million dollars than you do winning the florida lottery

[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:22.500]
Which is why I've played it maybe about three times and did get that 13 bucks from remember by the way. Thanks a lot. Remember you're the man

[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:27.060]
Oh, and this morning I was telling oh, I don't can't say that on here. Can I know?

[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:36.020]
I was telling Scott all about the knees pocket. Anyway one drawback to sticking around for a while and paying attention is that you remember old promises made to the public

[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.760]
It says by Howard Traxler

[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.720]
Covines for the same Pete times. Why is that such a drawback?

[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:45.980]
He asked because it upsets the stomach it's so much easier to believe blissfully than whatever's being said at the moment

[00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.420]
The topic at hand is the Florida lottery twice recently

[00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.980]
I find myself actually yelling at my TV because of the lot of his latest commercial

[00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:58.860]
Commercials the narrator brags about how much money the lottery is raised for education among the feats of which the commercial

[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.240]
Post is the construction of a hundred new schools

[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:07.980]
Listen the lottery was not supposed to build schools the fact that lottery money is building schools at all is not something to brag about

[00:49:07.980 --> 00:49:12.640]
It's something to be ashamed of the lottery was promised to the people of Florida's way to enhance education

[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:17.380]
Every dollar we were told in the 86 campaign was supposed to be an extra bonus

[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.220]
Grady for the kids of Florida on top of what we're already spending instead. Here's the truth

[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.920]
Education in Florida is worse off since the lottery began

[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.900]
Education got almost 61% of Florida's general revenue

[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:33.200]
1986 87 the year the voters approved the lottery today. It's getting only 53% 8% less

[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.740]
The lottery provided the legislature an excuse to take away from education where a lottery dollars came in the front door

[00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:43.060]
The legislature took away dollars out the back door look out for that back door back them

[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.120]
Besides the laws of budget cheer the floor lottery has a secondary bad effect

[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:54.600]
It's added to voter reluctance to support other ways of increased school funding. Oh, that's right the lottery's taking care of that

[00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:59.080]
We don't want to put anymore money in here plus when we got that asshole that calls in every time we bring up anything about schools

[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:03.020]
Oh, the date County budget is four billion dollars for the school where they can yeah

[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.340]
Why'd you conduct and oh here's Pete has become a chronic this isn't the

[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.400]
X-Bordop P visit I hope I don't know

[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:14.500]
Only no one here's Peter says I hope this gets through to you

[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:18.680]
I can't wait hours on the phone to get through so must not be chronic because he's got no life

[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.400]
Please, please please discontinue the one to two-comedy bits hour

[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:26.200]
I can't take an hour of parody songs maybe 50 minutes, but I'm an entire hour

[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.180]
My hope would be to devote that hour to bedtime stories. Hey, that's not a bad idea

[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:35.280]
You know the problem that beat now because that word more bedtime stories all through the show every day anyway as you notice today

[00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:38.900]
And it is bursting a collar too like this one from Miami. Hello

[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.840]
Hello, yes, sir. Hey, Neil how you doing today pretty good. I wanted to add one thing to your poll there

[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:51.540]
Man, how did you forget about the Marlin Stadium issue? Oh the Marlin Stadium issue excellent choice

[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:57.220]
Oh, it's got to be number one with a bullet today. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Apparently have a great day

[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:04.740]
Star-Marlin Stadium issue got it. Got it. Oh look at this look what's waiting a hand that doesn't surprise me at all

[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.000]
Doesn't surprise me at all the benefit man

[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:13.060]
Early votes just coming in to pull us up 31 votes Ben and J. L.o. 22

[00:51:13.060 --> 00:51:18.980]
Which of these are you the least interested in we've become most ponderous is nauseated by sports three oh

[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:20.960]
Clarence ain't gonna be too happy about that

[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:28.340]
Kobe Bryant rate case two Scott Lacey Peterson appear Elizabeth smart to and we're adding now Marlin Stadium issue for one

[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:36.580]
So it says so Pete says please play so we had the other one says please please continue it and this one says please

[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:42.220]
This continues Schmidt can't it man. Please master. Please can't handle it. Please master

[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.820]
Anyway, oh you finally facs me the second page of this good. Thank you

[00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:52.340]
There's a widespread voter misperception that the lottery somehow a solved education in Florida just the opposite

[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:55.800]
Lottery dollars represented tiny fraction of Florida's total school budget

[00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:00.880]
But you wouldn't know it from the lottery zone advertising which relentlessly talks about how much ticket sales help education

[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:07.840]
The lottery's website says its mission is to inform the public about these significance of lottery funding to the state's overall system of

[00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.880]
Public education if that were true

[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:14.040]
Really then here's what the lottery's advertising would say listen up Florida

[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:20.080]
We're glad you're buying lottery tickets, but no matter what you think lottery revenues are only still a drop in a bucket and what Florida schools need

[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.000]
Until 1997 we kept up the pretense the lottery was supposed to enhance schools

[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.500]
But well that year Democrats and Republicans got together decided they couldn't resist taking lottery money for construction

[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:34.760]
Led by the late governor walking lot and showers they created a program called classrooms first

[00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.400]
Heck who could be opposed to that that would use lottery money to pay off construction bonds today

[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.880]
$180 million a year goes to pay off that debt

[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.360]
Another big use of lottery money is to pay for the state's bright future scholarships

[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:51.140]
Which are based on academic merit. It's interesting and typical that Florida would use a lottery for such a purpose

[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.920]
Relying on ticket sales which come disproportionately from poor people to pay for academic scholarships

[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:59.000]
Which go disproportionately to the better off in essence?

[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.260]
We're lying on poor suckers to pay everybody else's freight. Don't worry. It's working just fine

[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:11.080]
By criticism of the Florida Lawyers limited only to it spreading of the misperception that it helps education would actually represent the net loss to Florida schools

[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:15.900]
But I voted for its creation back in 86 with eyes open on simple grounds that will be you know fun to have

[00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:22.980]
Ralph Turlington the former Education Commissioner who became the Godfather lottery campaign in 86 made another promise that he didn't

[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.180]
Get kept he said that if lottery passed he would ask for periodic votes every two to four years

[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.100]
I'm whether to keep it if it's gonna be a stake

[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:32.020]
He said you can build it in the beginning where you can vote it out

[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:37.320]
Promises promises right so this guy what else is name whoever it is in the same p times

[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:43.180]
Yeah, you can build it the beginning and if you don't like it and hold it out and we had a chance to vote it out

[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:43.500]
No

[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:46.000]
No, of course not we don't want to do that

[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.220]
A lot of suckers out there just waiting for the easy money man and

[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:56.000]
Like he points out the people who could least afford to play the lottery are the ones who are taking the lunch money

[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.880]
And I'm all for it. I'm all for the lottery if you want to throw away your money. It's a free country go ahead

[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:03.940]
But you and I both know that it's just it's just a way to throw away some money

[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:08.740]
Oh, it's it but it's wonderful. We want to have a dream. It's give us calls called a pipe dream a water pipe

[00:54:08.740 --> 00:54:10.340]
Three water pipe

[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:12.360]
That's the one dream

[00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:17.280]
45 votes Ben and J. L. O 33 they don't want to hear from you people

[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.480]
They don't want to know from you go off on a desert island and screw your brains out or maybe you can find a boyfriend from her for him

[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:26.740]
And a girlfriend for her or the other way around whatever we don't care. They're both boring

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:28.480]
That's another thing. She's got a big ass

[00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.380]
She can't sing for crap and she's just a warring actress

[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:37.000]
She couldn't act her out of a paper sack if he was stuck at a uzi upper big fat ass

[00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.120]
That's the right he's concerned. He's got the personality of a dead man

[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:43.140]
In fact, if Don Amos were a little bit younger. I think they were the same person

[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.040]
He has no you can't complain about Ben Affleck's personality. You don't have any none

[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:53.020]
And now that what's his name that Damon is turned a cold shoulder to him

[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.280]
He's jealous a cold something. What he's jealous of

[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:01.020]
J. L. Yeah, right. Yeah, that's a good story

[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:06.120]
The public ought to buy that 45 votes 33 for Ben and J. L. O

[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:12.280]
Sports for Kobe Bryant 3 Scott Lacey Peterson 3 Elizabeth smart 2 Marlon State of Michigan. Oh vote so far

We got the mad dog at two today. It's good to have him back the Humper 4 to 7 3 solid hours hang

[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.540]

Jack's break that the bush is given to the people who drive these hummers did you see that in the paper? Yes, uh-huh

[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:04.860]

I looked to you call but I'm not interested in any of these stuff

Why don't you have like none of the above all the above?

[00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.140]
Okay, you know like

[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.900]
For somebody like me that don't care about any of the stuff. You got all the above sounds good. Sounds like a weener

[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:50.320]
Thank you, man. That's the perfect option. Sometimes you know I both was something I don't really care right?

[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:55.360]
Okay, all of the above you got it. All right. Thanks. Thanks, pal. I asked the cameo. Beat us all of the above

[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:58.020]

[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.620]

Butterfly net. I mean if you really have a duty in all of these and you need some serious serious assistance

According to the media we all are yeah. Oh, yeah the media knows what's important

[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:20.860]
What did I tend to do it early on man? There's a classic example of how they took a a

[00:57:20.860 --> 00:57:25.840]
Personal family custody case and they made it into just an enormous worldwide

[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.100]
The world was like watching software to go

[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:34.880]
Like that and especially when they caught on a meris greasy ass and they said take a look at that thing

[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.300]
She made JLo look like a piker

[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:41.460]
She made my jalo's ass look like Karen Carpenter's after the they put her in a box

[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.980]
Meris greasy ass and once you mean like marry some 10 year old boy or something something like that

Yeah, we build the pool. I mean most guys out there they like to work on a pool every day, right?

[01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.420]

[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.740]
Bush will mark the beginning of the decline in fall of the American Empire

[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:21.540]
You got a good point Ed. Maybe he's more than that. Maybe a hundred years from now

[01:02:21.540 --> 01:02:25.200]
There won't be nobody around to write no history right the way things are going

[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:30.600]
Here's the facts. I'm from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I'm listening to you with through the internet

[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:34.480]
I just want to say that I'm relieved that there are people in America who were not blinded by the Bush administration

[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:38.840]
I love America. My name is my second home. I go to Miami every year since I was two years old

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:32.980]
You should retire. No, see I'm not ready now. That's the same guys last week the same guy doing a different voice

[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:38.500]

[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.380]
um if

[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:03.460]
They gave money to teachers rather than to build schools they couldn't steal it

[01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:10.100]
Yeah, I mean, oh this is that same guy. No, I'm the different guy. Okay, good

[01:04:10.740 --> 01:04:16.060]
Um, there's always you know plenty of money to build schools right because they can steal that but if they give it to the teachers

[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.000]
There's no way to get their hand on it right

[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.960]
I mean it's clear why they play you might as well cool but nobody take the graph out of it nobody wants it in Florida

[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.400]
Hey, exactly

Third, this program has uncovered like we usually do because the first guy is the same asshole that called last week

[01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:55.760]
But it retired at pull crap. Yeah, when is George going to be on again? Uh, we we just don't get any like a real normal living and breathing person from

[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:59.720]
Girl Gables ever and I don't think there are any who live there. I think it's a local ordinance who's speaking

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.720]
English I think along along with like no ducks and no pickups in the driveway and

[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:06.180]
Know this and know that no brains

[01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.400]
No brains allowed no IQ larger than your thumbnail if you live in the Gables

[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:17.080]
I mean all the years that I've been on here. I keep trying to think if I ever talk to like any rational person and cruel Gables

[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.060]
I don't think so

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.660]
Including when I used to do you in baseball people used to sit in the stand going

[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.040]
Oh

[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:33.580]
I never forget the first game that I worked channel 33 with Bob Greasy the first hurricane game on television

[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:40.000]
Now keep in mind I had done five years on radio and by everybody's accounts at a pre-dem good job

[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.740]
We filled up the stands everybody thought you know you and baseball was the cats me out with the hottest thing went to Omaha to the

[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.400]
College World Series five years in a row

So here's the first game at mark light stadium and I'm doing channel 33 TV and Bob Greasy's doing the color

[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:59.560]
I'm doing a play-by-play and Jero Keats gets on a PA before the game and announces and we also would like to welcome from

[01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:03.060]

That was called Gables that I mean I don't mind being food based on what what was there like a message there

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:21.200]

[01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:32.900]
hasn't been able to see they succeeded with alien where they're failing with benefit they succeeded

[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:36.420]
they had everybody whooped up and were frenzy because they convinced them that was and plus

[01:20:36.420 --> 01:20:41.000]
of course with the help of the South Florida media oh yeah and a bunch of old toothless Julios

[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:48.740]
and my cubans and my cuban it's a single crap you know how come now what did the Latin

[01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:54.020]
Grammys already it took place right yeah I guess boy must have been nothing really if sighting

[01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:59.540]
happened must have been no Kubano's tried to like invade the performers anyway look very quiet

[01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:04.400]
very low key there's John Stamos who still looks pretty good can't alone can't alone can't

[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:08.780]
tend to doing the spots for a 10 10 one of those phone card things you know one of those phone

[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:13.720]
services long distance deals yeah John Stamos he was on he was blacky on general hospital

[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:19.860]
what else was he on full houses at the name of that sitcom I don't know come on that's a sit calm

[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:24.240]
I don't know you don't like John I don't want to do you know like John Stamos no why what's not

[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.260]
to like about him what's to like he's just he's a pretty good guy he never stole a free train

[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:33.000]
I mean I like him because he looks pretty good but then I mean you don't have to like him is

[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:36.460]
it just because he looks good you don't like him no maybe you know like Tom Brady either you just

[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:40.260]
like Tom Brady I don't know from Tom what do you ever do with you with you with you

[01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:44.200]
no no and it's inconsequential to my life like John he never did nothing with me and that's

[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:47.680]
what I'm pretty upset about maybe John Stamos is going Tom Brady in a Patriots yesterday

need to stay in we've had in New York and they couldn't even hear anything out of our stadium I

[01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.160]
think it's great keep the one we got yeah only there's no losing money there what is the issue

[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:57.480]
there the issue there's that Wayne owns the stadium and the deal they got with Wayne precludes them

[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:02.360]
from making any money I see yeah that guy looked like a real tool or news right that's right

[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:06.980]
a couple interviews so the bottom line is they're going to have to like move someplace else because the

fathering a baby like lyric king and all these other acays Tony or what's that what's the other one

[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:54.720]
and maybe i'm wrong it coming old fashion oh he's too freaking old to be living with him why

does he get married to the bitch he probably want to yeah she's back all the cash that's

[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:02.700]
far advised everybody out there don't get married so here's the new deal from a bag

[01:37:02.700 --> 01:37:07.720]
that after that time at the same time i think we have to say that you know that there's it's

[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:14.060]
difficult to predict when these acts of this is the same guy with the same outfit on it we saw

[01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:18.760]
yesterday you've got to be kidding me pinch me if i'm awake okay i don't feel nothing i'm sleeping

[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.760]
that this is got to be the same exact headline multiple large explosions and central bag that

[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:28.780]
CNN's got the same turdburger on it the same silly as Brit that was on her yesterday with it all

[01:37:28.780 --> 01:37:33.240]
the only difference being at his mic is like off and he but there is a bob arna 35 to be able to be

[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:37.420]
able to make a big deal i'm not moving up and down to get the range they have feelings like that

[01:37:37.420 --> 01:37:42.560]
we didn't able to range the greens of meaning that they're waiting for our barna who used to be

[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.500]
doctor bob arna when he was on cds and now he's like an international collage and expert

[01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:52.000]
i spoke to the cp a day and they basically said it is only a matter of time until they start to

[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.460]
hit buildings and most senior u.s. compound will we heard and i which visit right out of our window

[01:37:57.460 --> 01:38:05.420]
here was first a very loud bump explosion and about two minutes later we heard two more i only

[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:10.040]
heard one land of course i'm on the other side of the building one of our crew actually saw a

[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:16.780]
flash and then smoke and that's believed to be directly adjacent to the green cell which is

[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:22.220]
the main headquarters of the administration now there are countermeasures available there are 105

[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:28.660]
millimeter howitzers at the u.s. armored division here can fire back if it's not in a heavily

[01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:34.080]
populated area unfortunately this is fairly heavily populated and so they're unwilling to take

[01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:39.480]
that risk where they launch from is a long the side of the river there what they call holes for

[01:38:39.480 --> 01:38:44.560]
you have trees a grove of freeze in there you don't have any that's how it sounds to me like we're

[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.520]
in one of them and one of them deep holes and we're not going to get out of it anytime soon

[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:52.040]
they're face plates sit there they're asmeth and they're bearing and fire those mortars

[01:38:52.040 --> 01:38:58.180]
lock them into central back that so it's an escalation here in terms of the war against the cpa

[01:38:58.180 --> 01:39:02.700]
by the terrorists i thought the war was over George but no more over to now president they say

[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:06.440]
hey guess what the war is over that phase of it is all over and now it's rebuilding and

[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:09.660]
doing this and grabbing a hold of the oil and whatever else we can squeeze out of here just

[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:13.300]
making the rebuilding going for halibut and beck tell all of our other good friends

[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:20.440]
man this is all the ramba don business now have children who are being taken out of schools

[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:25.100]
do you have parents who are hubby at home and the other thing is happening which is interesting

[01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:31.000]
it's just now the threat of increased kidnappings already some prominent lackeys and their children

[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:36.280]
have been kidnapped and the fear is that this will now escalate the foreigners and even members

[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.540]
of the press so it isn't escalating war here is you drive around the city honestly you don't

[01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:45.980]
actually feel that tension but it's in people's homes can you see that they are terrified for their

[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.440]
children and what may happen to them is this does escalate here well thank goodness the George

[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.300]
Bush and all these other glam okay really did have a good job Paul Wilfowicz and Richard

[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:58.820]
Puro and all these other people and Donna Rumsfeld and the Dick Cheney of course don't

[01:39:58.820 --> 01:40:03.180]
forget with his good friends at Halibut so there's the latest we'll have a little more whatever

[01:40:03.180 --> 01:40:08.940]
the hell comes along 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 you know what it falls down to more dead people more

[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:14.080]
wounded people more bodies more arms missing more legs missing and more mayhem in hysteria all over

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:20.420]
a bunch of lies that's what it is that's what it all is it's worth it and the democrats say you go

[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.340]
boys because we don't want to be perceived as not supporting our troops so here's 87 billion

[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:30.980]
I mean one and it's not alone it's a gift because we certainly don't want to leave this on the

[01:40:30.980 --> 01:40:35.240]
backs of the Iraqi children and mortgage their future away and have to repay all of this massive

[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:40.280]
debt plus that they've already got to repay so let's lay it on the American children of the future

[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:45.040]
a debt that they're going to have to be paying for the rest of their lives as we've already got

[01:40:45.040 --> 01:40:49.640]
the biggest deficit in history of the goddamn country this is a disaster if we had people with a

[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:54.160]
brain in this country they'd be marching on Washington there'd be caravans there'd be busloads

[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:58.340]
greyhound to be overbook people sitting on each other's laps and buses on their way to watch

[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:03.780]
them to say impeach the son of a bitch now and cut the crap stop the baloney and we could be

[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:08.380]
spending the eighty seven billion dollars really fighting terrorism really finding Osama really

[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:14.140]
disemboweling al-Qaeda and all these other crazy terrorist lunatic groups we could be taking all

[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:17.760]
the freaking money that we're giving to Israel every year and we could be using that money to fight

[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:21.760]
terrorism and make American citizens safe and give them an education and help people who are

[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:26.420]
starving to death and can't afford to buy their overpriced prescription drugs because we have

[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.280]
a bunch of propaganda is going on here every day talking about how the drugs that come from Canada

[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:35.960]
are tainted and they're from Pakistan and who only knows what's it yeah right God forbid that

[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:43.140]
American citizens should be buying drugs from a 10th world country like Canada a oh man what a

[01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:49.100]
pile of duty you know you can you can smell it oh thank God for Jean Crèchian I never thought I

[01:41:49.100 --> 01:41:53.600]
would say that for that fraud but thank God for him Jesus and talking about Dumbos

[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:58.660]
Jerry can make our country more secure yeah we're making our Americans and everybody more secure

[01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:07.380]
it's butchery is what it is it's mass murder and mayhem making us more secure I mean this man

[01:42:07.380 --> 01:42:11.040]
really believes he's talking to a bunch of morons people are as dumb as he is and you know he

[01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:17.780]
may have a point he may have a point America will never run not until we got all those hoses hooked

[01:42:17.780 --> 01:42:22.340]
up you know what I'm saying to our sucking every last drop of oil out of that Iraqi desert we won't

[01:42:22.340 --> 01:42:29.380]
run till the oil does I like it maybe that's going to be his campaign slogan next year I'll go get

[01:42:29.380 --> 01:42:37.380]
the buttons I'll ride five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:41.540]
and the public sits back and they watch this every day like it's a made for TV movie or something

[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:45.820]
like these aren't real people and God forbid we ought to be able to see the guy named coffins with

[01:42:45.820 --> 01:42:52.200]
the drape with the American flag hey because there's dead kids in there and it's easy for you to sit

[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.740]
back wow you're at the American I wonder if it was some of you punks out there or some of your best

[01:42:56.740 --> 01:43:00.840]
friends or some of your sons or some of your damn nephews or whatever it was I wonder what you'd be

[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:07.060]
saying that or some of your husbands it's like sending sheep to slaughter is what it is

[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:14.980]
and the public sits back blue I'm telling you you mark my words it's just a matter of fricking time

[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:20.600]
or here's MSNBC again with a pictures you know that oh Jesus I'm sure that these people will be

[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.640]
pinned up on that bulletin board again by the end of the week boy it's just it's just it's just

[01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:29.620]
enough to tear your guts out and not just the fact that it's happening but that the American

[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:35.360]
political system is just fallen apart you got a one-party system the Democratic party basically

[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:41.720]
doesn't exist doesn't exist the media doesn't exist other than just be a bunch of cheerleaders

[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.520]
give every give them all a bunch of pom-poms give Dan rather a pom-poms so we can go on CBS

[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:49.760]
tonight and announce probably probably that we cancel the Reagan series because we don't want to

[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:54.260]
piss off the president and all the other right-wingers who take it over to country in a boardless

[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:57.460]
coup that's right let's hear it Dan you go boy

[01:44:02.320 --> 01:44:06.100]
Jesus country that doesn't give a flying crap about human life and of course we're not even

[01:44:06.100 --> 01:44:10.460]
counting the country isn't even making an attempt to count the number of dead Iraqis number one

[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:13.980]
because we don't really care right number two because the number is way too embarrassing

[01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:18.580]
and humiliating and degrading unacceptable because each and every one of those people even though

[01:44:18.580 --> 01:44:22.960]
they were living under dictatorship and oppression every one of those people would be alive today

[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:28.520]
they were living every one of these American soldiers would be alive today if it weren't for

[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:32.240]
the biggest fraud perperty this even makes the stock market fraud pale into what significance

[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.080]
they're talking human life here which is there's no dollars amount you can put on it watergate

[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.620]
savings and loan scandal what else and run all of it all of these things

controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing is drilling it over and over

[01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:57.000]
into our heads that iraq has some weapons of mass destruction

[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:15.160]
the loss of civil rights is the rights that we're paying we're all suspects now not the ash crop

prof 20's science 60wq and what a day here let me see if this thing's printing out

[01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:11.120]
Yeah, here it is from the Fudge Report Miss Fudge, that's

[01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:14.780]
self-hating queen on her website, FudgeReport.com.

[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:19.040]
CBS statement regarding the Reagan, CBS will not broadcast the Reagan's the

[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:20.240]
ever 16th and 18th.

[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.900]
This decision is based solely on our reaction to seeing the final film, not the

[01:52:23.900 --> 01:52:25.980]
controversy that erupted around a draft of the script.

[01:52:26.820 --> 01:52:30.080]
Although the mini-series features impressive production values and acting

[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:33.600]
performances, and although the producers have sources deverified each scene in

[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:36.960]
the script, we believe it does not present a balanced portrayal of the Reagan's

[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:38.220]
for CBS at its audience.

[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:42.020]
Subsequent edits that we consider did not address those concerns.

[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:45.720]
A free broadcast network available to all over the public airwaves has

[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:49.300]
different standards than media the public must pay to view.

[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:52.340]
Different standards than media the public must pay to view.

[01:52:52.640 --> 01:52:55.660]
We do however recognize and respect the filmmakers right there for a certain

[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:56.340]
their film scene.

[01:52:56.740 --> 01:53:00.360]
As such, we have reached an agreement to license the exhibition rights for the

[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:03.860]
film to show time a subscriber based pay cable network.

[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:06.800]
We believe this is a solution that benefits everyone involved.

[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:07.420]
Right.

[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:09.340]
This was not an easy decision to make.

[01:53:09.420 --> 01:53:13.000]
CBS does tackle controversial subject and provide tough assessments of

[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:16.000]
prominent historical figures and events as we did with films such as

[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:17.800]
Jesus, 9-11, and Hitler.

[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.700]
We will continue to do so in the future and by the way people at CBS Hitler would be

[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:24.680]
proud of the way you caved.

[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.420]
Is that incredible or what?

[01:53:27.560 --> 01:53:28.520]
No, it's very credible.

[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:29.220]
Yeah.

[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:31.340]
It's American effort away now, man.

[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:35.220]
Because basically what they're saying is that the FCC doesn't have the same

[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:41.560]
control over the cable channels as they do over the over the air channels like us.

[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:43.860]
That's really what they're saying that have one line.

[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:44.240]
Right.

[01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:46.300]
Here's some good news you'll be pleased about.

[01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:51.360]
We're waiting to see how many three explosions inside the main US compound and

[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:52.880]
Bob Arden to his other on MSNBC.

[01:53:53.080 --> 01:53:54.580]
Bap, Bap, Bap, BPO, Phil and time.

[01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:58.720]
Walmart's store said today it's received a target letter from the US

[01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:02.720]
attorney's office saying the world's largest retailer allegedly violated

[01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.000]
federal immigration laws.

[01:54:04.040 --> 01:54:04.520]
All right.

[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:09.940]
The company is the target Walmart spokesman, Walter William said on October 23rd

[01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:13.520]
federal agents arrested about 250 allegedly illegal workers in the 21st

[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:17.180]
state sweep of Walmart stores federal prosecutors in Pennsylvania are handling

[01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:17.680]
the case.

[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:21.200]
William said company executives are not the subject of the inquiry.

[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:24.880]
Walmart was not surprised by this formal notification since it's in keeping with

[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:27.420]
comments made by federal officials after the raids.

[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:29.040]
William said the raids.

[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.320]
He said Walmart received a letter Friday in the grand jury will look at whether the

[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:35.780]
company violated federal immigration laws and connection with the USO third party

[01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:39.040]
floor cleaning contractors clean up your act of an air Walmart.

[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:39.960]
You grave robbers.

[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:41.180]
You crazy Nazi bastards.

[01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.300]
You we hate Walmart on a show.

[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:45.060]
We despise them for the passion.

[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:47.000]
How do you like that?

[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.740]
We're viled and we've voted by them.

[01:54:51.580 --> 01:54:55.740]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:54:57.060 --> 01:54:59.160]
Here's a call from a wrong line.

[01:54:59.260 --> 01:54:59.860]
Sorry about that.

[01:54:59.940 --> 01:55:00.880]
Hello, David.

[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:01.420]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:02.280]
How you doing?

[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:03.040]
OK.

[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:04.700]
You made it right on the head, man.

[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:07.860]
I don't know what happened to all the coverage of the war, but man, if they

[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:11.540]
had more of it, I think more people would be pissed off seeing these sons and

[01:55:11.540 --> 01:55:13.240]
daughters and friends dying over there.

[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:13.720]
Yeah.

[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:14.720]
But for what?

[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:15.780]
For nothing?

[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:16.740]
Because they ain't caught.

[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:17.900]
Side of yet.

[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.840]
They ain't caught getting lied in yet.

[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.900]
They probably hold up somewhere in Switzerland drinking and charting in all that.

[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:24.520]
Probably.

[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:27.540]
You know, you have a good day.

[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.540]
And you too, pal.

[01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:30.300]
Thanks for your persprications, observations.

[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:36.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and the rise of the month.

[01:55:36.320 --> 01:55:39.220]
Multiple large explosions and central bag that won't flutzkrieg is on here.

[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:40.280]
So must be pretty important.

[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:46.460]
In what's being described by our Jane Arath as the main coalition compound in areas where

[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:53.100]
there are a lot of US military personnel, civilian personnel and other coalition partners.

[01:55:53.640 --> 01:56:00.120]
It's a huge area of former presidential palace of the former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.

[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:01.500]
But you can see this area.

[01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.180]
You see the smoke coming up.

[01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:04.320]
It's already dark now.

[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:05.740]
It's after some.

[01:56:05.740 --> 01:56:08.620]
See another point all of this is they put the personnel over there.

[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:12.540]
The troops and all the other American personnel in harm's way without adequate.

[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:16.080]
Without adequate security is what they've done.

[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:19.440]
Yeah, they were not only with a old plan, they were totally unplanned.

[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:20.600]
They're going to work with heroes.

[01:56:22.860 --> 01:56:23.660]
I beg your pardon.

[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:25.460]
They're going to welcome us as heroes remember.

[01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:26.380]
Well, that's right.

[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:27.280]
I forgot about the candy.

[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.200]
They're going to be given as a cake and inviting us in for some halava.

[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:30.880]
Mm hmm.

[01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:31.600]
Stuff like that.

[01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:32.480]
I guess not.

[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.860]
Here's the call from Cutler Ridge.

[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:35.160]
Hello.

[01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.980]
Yeah, I want to talk about the dolphin.

[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:38.820]
Well, I don't.

[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:40.900]
5 6 7 0 5 6.

[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:42.580]
You see, there's what's wrong with America right there.

[01:56:43.100 --> 01:56:44.320]
He wants to talk about the dolphins.

[01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:45.240]
Go to hell.

[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:47.480]
They want to know what do you think?

[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:48.300]
Firemen are not Scott.

[01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:49.460]
He's done.

[01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:50.940]
He's he's toast.

[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:52.320]
No, we're turning just sick.

[01:56:52.460 --> 01:56:52.960]
I'm just sick of forking him.

[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:53.400]
He's done.

[01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:58.800]
Yeah, nor turn his waiting in a wings man like a like a vulture like an old turkey buzzard.

[01:56:59.340 --> 01:57:01.640]
I bet five six seven 0 5 6 don't know.

[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:02.080]
No, no, we're doing.

[01:57:02.080 --> 01:57:03.940]
I just because I asked you a little simple question there.

[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:04.620]
Don't get carried away.

[01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:07.000]
We're going to cut off those personal appearances and all those big bucks.

[01:57:08.980 --> 01:57:10.040]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:10.380]
Hello.

[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:11.220]
Hello.

[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:12.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:14.720]
Yeah, you can go on and raise it in a lot.

[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.360]
Here's a call from Papa.

[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:17.700]
Hello.

[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:19.400]
This is where is it?

[01:57:19.460 --> 01:57:20.040]
West Palm Beach.

[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:20.300]
Hello.

[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.620]
Hey, it's a schwa.

[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.180]
I call you.

[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:22.700]
How are you doing?

[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:23.440]
OK.

[01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:25.540]
Yeah.

[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:28.360]
You know, you're right all about all those things.

[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:34.860]
And one thing I'm mad is that the fact is I really still want to get you to read that

[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:41.520]
a high night poufax on the air and the one about a chainy with the sex with the Kathy

[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:41.980]
O'Brien.

[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:45.180]
Those fact I know I do what you're talking about.

[01:57:45.180 --> 01:57:47.680]
Well, I said those facts is about three times already.

[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:48.220]
Maybe.

[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:48.580]

[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.100]
Would you listen to me?

[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:50.400]
Yeah.

[01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:53.960]
Are you the guy to keep sending these long, long, ponderous facts that Georgia is getting

[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.620]
pork off about?

[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.220]
Is that what it is?

[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:56.840]
I don't know.

[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.120]
I don't know if it's that.

[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:00.760]
Well, how many pages of material are we talking about?

[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:05.900]
Only three for the Kathy O'Brien one and for the cyanide pouf was only one.

[01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:07.800]
What does that mean, cyanide pouf?

[01:58:07.800 --> 01:58:08.280]
What does that mean?

[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:13.280]
That means before he became the pope and he was in Poland as a door to door salesman of

[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:13.980]
cyanide.

[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:14.420]
Yeah.

[01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:16.540]
And other things.

[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:17.680]
And then he had a high.

[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.300]
OK, well, listen, facts are again to get lost.

[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:20.760]
Do you know what he's talking about?

[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.820]
No, it's a one-page thing like that.

[01:58:25.100 --> 01:58:27.900]
Then it might have been illegible, you know, like a big blocky thing.

[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:31.300]
Well, I mean, why do we want to talk about the pope who sold cyanide?

[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:33.740]
OK, why don't we talk about the bear people who made all that gas?

[01:58:34.480 --> 01:58:34.620]
Right.

[01:58:35.780 --> 01:58:36.680]
Experimented on the Jews.

[01:58:37.060 --> 01:58:37.320]
Right.

[01:58:37.540 --> 01:58:38.460]
Why don't we talk about that?

[01:58:38.660 --> 01:58:42.740]
Because nobody, I mean, the pope, we already know what a dottering old lunatic he is,

[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:44.260]
viewing Stone Age rhetoric.

[01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:48.060]
But the bear asked when people, not so many people know about that, was they should be

[01:58:48.060 --> 01:58:49.720]
taking St. Joseph's or something like that.

[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:50.000]
Right.

[01:58:50.220 --> 01:58:51.560]
What's some other aspirants?

[01:58:52.420 --> 01:58:52.780]
Aniston.

[01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:54.540]
Aniston, a bad hydrant.

[01:58:54.980 --> 01:58:56.480]
Anything except bear, OK?

[01:58:57.420 --> 01:59:01.220]
All you Jews out there, go to your medicine cabinet right now, take a look at the bear.

[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:01.660]

Call 33 at 5.60 W.Q.M.

[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:18.060]
So this is what AP is saying.

[02:02:18.240 --> 02:02:22.180]
Huge explosions rock central Baghdad on Tuesday night and Iraqi police had two mortars

[02:02:22.180 --> 02:02:26.520]
landed inside the compound, used as a headquarters of the US occupation.

[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:32.300]
Four large explosions could be heard about 7.45 p.m. a rack time and smoke could be seen rising

[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:36.420]
from the north end of the US compound near the bridge show over the Tigris River.

[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.240]
The US military command confirmed two impacts in the city center but didn't say where.

[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:45.920]
Iraqi police had two of the rounds impacted the US controlled green zone, a one square

[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:49.340]
mile area along the western bank of the Tigris where the coalition headquarters is located.

[02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:53.080]
It was the second straight nut to have the explosions in the center of the Iraqi capital.

[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:56.800]
And they're all pup pup because they don't know what happened yet.

[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:00.620]
We don't know if Jay Bremer by the way was in that compound.

[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:02.340]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:07.820]
Eric and West Palm Beach says couldn't hold on because he's at work but he'll lay the

[02:03:07.820 --> 02:03:08.560]
addition for our poll.

[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:09.120]
It's a good one.

[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.040]
Terry Shiavo.

[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:10.600]
Yep.

[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:13.780]
And they still haven't a field angle and nuts.

[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.720]
No, that really what they have been.

[02:03:16.680 --> 02:03:18.220]
And he don't want to hear about it.

[02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:20.040]
He's not interested in Terry Freak and Shiavo.

[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:21.360]
Pull the damn plugs already.

[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:22.380]
OK, pull the cords.

[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.800]
Pull them them cubes out.

[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:25.580]
And it's not the crap.

[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.720]
Terry Shiavo get harass on there.

[02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:33.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[02:03:33.800 --> 02:03:38.140]
A lot of open lines there now because we don't want to talk about the dolphins, I guess.

[02:03:39.900 --> 02:03:41.060]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:03:41.080 --> 02:03:41.400]
Hello.

[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:43.200]
Now, yes, sir.

[02:03:43.780 --> 02:03:45.940]
What are we going to do with Bill come out?

[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:50.260]
Like I said, here's Miami.

[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:51.920]
Hello, our last call.

[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:53.040]
Neil.

[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:53.860]
Yes, sir.

[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:54.580]
Hi, Neil.

[02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:59.200]
I haven't heard you speak about the state of Florida and Paw Beach County giving you

[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.720]
a half a billion dollars to that strip's research company.

[02:04:01.860 --> 02:04:02.820]
Have you aware of it?

[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.160]
Yeah, I saw read the story.

[02:04:04.380 --> 02:04:04.380]

[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:04.840]
Yeah.

[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:08.460]
This is a state that has no money for health care and no money for kids.

[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:08.740]
Right.

[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:08.960]
Right.

[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:12.420]
We have tax breaks for corporations and half a billion dollars.

[02:04:12.940 --> 02:04:14.120]
Now you're catching on, right?

[02:04:14.420 --> 02:04:15.220]
Yeah, terrific.

[02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:16.380]
Alrighty.

[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:18.800]
I live in the Toronto part of the time, eh?

[02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:19.800]
Have a great life.

[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.360]
5 6 7.

[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:21.700]
Look at that.

[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:22.780]
It's not a call on the board.

[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:23.760]
Nice going, guys.

[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:24.760]
You're really into it.

[02:04:24.800 --> 02:04:25.820]
See, like I said, they don't care.

[02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.880]
You can bring a horse to water where you can't make them drink.

[02:04:28.180 --> 02:04:29.500]
Same thing with the American public.

[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:30.860]
Like that.

[02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:34.520]
And that's why this continues going on.

[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:34.860]
Let's see.

[02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:38.300]
CBS cancels that they don't cancel that they ship it off the showtime because they

[02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:39.240]
know nobody can see that.

[02:04:39.420 --> 02:04:40.000]
They farmed it out.

[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:41.040]
They farmed it out.

[02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:44.640]
When it got because they got the heat off the CBS eye now is they're using some

[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:46.060]
fly scene to clear it up a little bit.

[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:52.500]
And we got another the Ramadan slaughter and massacre with the lunatics over there

[02:04:52.500 --> 02:04:55.700]
continues as we have our people in harm's way and more and more bodies being brought

[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:57.520]
every day, even though they don't want you to see it.

[02:04:58.980 --> 02:05:03.340]
For the first time ever, a pull has found the majority of Americans disapprove of of

[02:05:03.340 --> 02:05:08.100]
President's handling of Iraq even before yesterday's attack and today's zone going on.

[02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:12.560]
The pull was taken over the last week during which the mounting U.S. casualties were

[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:13.580]
denying the public's confidence.

[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:19.620]
The Washington Post poll showed the number who approve of Mr. Bush's handling at 47% the

[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:21.900]
number of this to this approval 51%.

[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:27.720]
So the number who approve of his handling of Iraq has fallen 28% as points since the

[02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:28.140]
end of April.

[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:33.960]
And the disapproving number 51% of the first time it's broken 50% since the war started.

[02:05:36.480 --> 02:05:41.580]
54% said the war was worth fighting 44% said it was not and again pull taken before yesterday.

[02:05:42.340 --> 02:05:46.940]
In March, the figures were 70% said it was worth fighting and only 27% not.

[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:54.280]
So there you go for what it's worth that 75% so by maybe three quarters of a cup of coffee at the

[02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:54.940]
Rascal House.

[02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:00.860]
Two state workers were fired Monday and Connecticut over a 2001 anthrax hoax that

[02:06:00.860 --> 02:06:03.660]
forced the evacuation more than 800 employees from an office building.

[02:06:05.740 --> 02:06:09.700]
Joseph Farniars and David Sattler were dismissed by Connecticut Department of Environmental

[02:06:09.700 --> 02:06:13.200]
Protection for engaging in an activity which is detrimental to the best interest of the

[02:06:13.200 --> 02:06:15.940]
agency or the state said Commissioner Arthur Rocai.

[02:06:18.340 --> 02:06:20.400]
Farniars, Farniars, what kind of a name is that?

[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:21.360]
Fairly New Yorkers.

[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:25.420]
The convicted last December of line to federal agents about the source of a white powder found

[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:30.660]
on his desk next to a piece of papermark with the misspelled word anthrax October 11, 2001.

[02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.700]
And there's one thing you don't want to be joking anybody about especially back then.

[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:38.700]
Believe you me was right or him because he ain't no joke.

[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.820]
I'll tell you what is a sick joke and it is this phone.

[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:42.480]
Take a look at that.

[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.660]
Nobody gives a flying crap.

[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:44.960]
Nobody's got nothing to say.

[02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:46.460]
But why don't you bring in C-SPAN?

[02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:46.860]
Sure.

[02:06:46.860 --> 02:06:48.180]
Bring in C-SPAN.

[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:52.160]
Had them hear the comments about your audience with all these things going on.

[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:54.620]
Here's a call from Kendall.

[02:06:55.120 --> 02:06:55.120]

[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:55.800]
Uncle Neil.

[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:56.560]
Yes, sir.

[02:06:56.800 --> 02:07:00.000]
Under your recommendation I rented network.

[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:01.600]
We're an amazing room, man.

[02:07:01.940 --> 02:07:02.160]
Right.

[02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:04.660]
They've got to remind me of like clear channel and.

[02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:05.800]
Five minutes matter.

[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:06.260]
Hell.

[02:07:06.640 --> 02:07:07.980]
What are those three things that you brought?

[02:07:08.240 --> 02:07:09.520]
More like channel seven.

[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:10.320]
I'll tell you that.

[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:11.900]
More like channel seven.

[02:07:13.420 --> 02:07:16.300]
I'll tell you that.

[02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:18.220]
You're got to be forced by Michael Moore.

[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.420]
Yeah.

[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:20.540]
You hear anything of that?

[02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:21.160]
No.

[02:07:22.160 --> 02:07:26.240]
Because I had sold Wesley Clark would have been a Republican if the.

[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:28.720]
Call row had only returned his phone calls.

[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:30.920]
Probably.

[02:07:31.160 --> 02:07:31.320]
Yeah.

[02:07:31.540 --> 02:07:35.560]
And you know, who did the same thing Eisenhower Eisenhower.

[02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.240]
Oh Yeah.

[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:36.840]
Yeah.

[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:38.320]
Yeah he was kind of like in the middle.

[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:41.480]
He was totally non-political and after WWW to the Republican.

[02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:43.800]
Originally, he thought he might have been a Democrat.

[02:07:43.800 --> 02:08:13.780]
But he wrote really good stuff about you. We have to be careful about the military industrial complex. Right. That's right. Well, he knew. Yeah, exactly. He knew firsthand. We need more people like that. Maybe Westagar is good. I don't know. I wouldn't say we need more people like Eisenhower. He was also very anti-media and was like one of the first to really try to intimidate and rip off rip the crap out of the media. I like the bit in the network last night. He was saying that it's the really is no religion. There is no countries that are all about the dollar and how the market works all over this.

[02:08:13.780 --> 02:08:28.720]
The definitive line in that movie is the world is a business, Mr. Biel. When Ned Vadeys there in the boardroom of IT and T, the world is a business, Mr. Biel. That's all you need to know. And he's done away. He was looking pretty good in that movie. I would have done it like that. That's what William Holden thought to. He was holding it.

Multiple largest explosions in central Baghdad

Four, count them four

[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.960]

[02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.820]

[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:13.920]
That was Silly Samson saying

[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:15.300]
We won the world series

[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.660]

[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:30.620]

[02:11:39.500 --> 02:11:39.960]
Yes sir!

[02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:40.980]
How are you, Zaneel?

[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:41.500]
Pretty good

[02:11:41.500 --> 02:11:44.880]
I had one for your poll I wanted to call earlier when it wouldn't matter

[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:47.420]
I'm so sick of Jan and Ben and Jail

[02:11:47.420 --> 02:11:49.100]
I want you to take them off the poll

[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:51.720]
But Jessica Lynch

[02:11:52.340 --> 02:11:53.400]
Yeah, that would be good one

[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:54.640]
They haven't been putting it on too much

[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:56.440]
But there's some TV movie coming up?

[02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.920]
Oh and Plus she's getting married too

[02:11:57.920 --> 02:12:01.260]
Which we have to keep hearing all the details about if she's doing a doogie-style or not

[02:12:01.260 --> 02:12:03.500]
Yeah, they're running the ads all the time for some TV

[02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:04.100]
Right

[02:12:04.100 --> 02:12:06.740]
Which I thought that her rescue was a made for TV movie

[02:12:07.360 --> 02:12:07.680]
Right

[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:09.220]
So it's like a TV movie of the TV movie

[02:12:09.220 --> 02:12:13.020]
Oh but it now it's the life story and the rescue and her marriage and all the lies

[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:15.040]
Then the fabrications they made up and all these things

[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:17.260]
I don't know why the right wingers are calling it the complaining

[02:12:17.260 --> 02:12:19.320]
Everything's working out so well

[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:20.020]
For them

[02:12:20.020 --> 02:12:24.060]
I mean, if everything they predicted the oil's paying for the war, the people...

[02:12:24.060 --> 02:12:24.280]
Right

[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.720]
I mean what if they got to be upset about everything's going to be great?

[02:12:26.720 --> 02:12:31.440]
All the people bringing our troops candy and smiling and shaking their hands and bow down to present along

[02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:34.100]
Why don't they be mad at you when they're having such wonderful success in Iraq

[02:12:34.100 --> 02:12:35.820]
And everything they said turned out to be true

[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:36.420]
Right

[02:12:36.420 --> 02:12:37.780]
Why should anybody be mad at you over there?

[02:12:37.780 --> 02:12:39.520]
Exactly, okay you said that, that...

[02:12:39.520 --> 02:12:44.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Fly

[02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.860]
How many times did he say that?

[02:12:45.860 --> 02:12:47.020]
5, 3, 2, 1, man!

[02:12:47.040 --> 02:12:48.460]
Here's a call from Pompano, hello

[02:12:49.420 --> 02:12:50.220]
Hello, Neil

[02:12:50.780 --> 02:12:51.220]
Yes sir?

[02:12:51.480 --> 02:12:53.340]
Can I speak to the gay whisperer please?

[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:54.380]
Yeah, yeah

[02:12:55.360 --> 02:12:58.540]
Go clean out about 45 pounds of flam, okay pal?

[02:12:58.700 --> 02:13:00.340]
When in doubt, spit it out

[02:13:01.880 --> 02:13:02.860]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:03.960]
Neil

[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:04.800]
Yes sir

[02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:09.820]
Hi, I'm originally from Boston, moved to Miami and have been listening to you ever since

[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:10.540]
Just in time, okay

[02:13:10.540 --> 02:13:16.620]
Well sir, I apologize to you for leaving a bastion of intellectualism into a sewer of mental decay

[02:13:16.620 --> 02:13:20.000]
I agree, I didn't really talk about it, it was till the other day

[02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:25.320]
I went to a Kmart with my wife and it was the day after the World Series

[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:27.720]
And in the Kmart, in the Kmart it had signs

[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:31.420]
We will not accept returns on mylons, baseball hats and mylons shirts

[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:35.260]
Some people were actually trying to return the stuff because the fever was over already

[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:41.100]
Well, maybe they should have had a place they just could have rented it for a day or two

[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:44.980]
I just didn't realize one second or two that maybe I lived it until that moment

[02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:45.920]
Absolutely

[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:47.380]
That's all I got

[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:49.260]
Okay pal, I see it, see it Walmart

[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:54.020]
There must be some little mom and pop stores where they sell stuff, right?

[02:13:54.420 --> 02:13:58.120]
Cut it stuff, not anymore, I mean any stuff, not anymore, they're all out of business

[02:13:58.120 --> 02:14:02.320]
Kmart and Walmart put them all our business, Kmart put them all first and Walmart put Kmart on a business

[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:04.340]
Target's still good, is it?

[02:14:04.580 --> 02:14:05.340]
Yeah, I like it a lot

[02:14:05.340 --> 02:14:06.060]
Never been there

[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:08.320]
Speaking of the public getting ripped off

[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:12.200]
Misty, what is Misty?

[02:14:12.300 --> 02:14:15.640]
Misty is somewhere in Broward, I get it, no she's in Broward

[02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:20.560]
She's just after being bombarded by frequent telemarketing calls, we registered for the National Do Not Callest

[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:25.320]
And I know exactly what she was going to say because the report I get from my house is we're starting to get calls again

[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:31.780]
We are still receiving calls and the one that called last night was nice enough to let us know that all that we registered nationally

[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:36.520]
We're not registered on a Florida's Do Not Callest, I didn't even know there was a Florida Do Not Callest, is there?

[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:36.820]
No

[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:38.900]
Nus to me, I never heard that

[02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.300]
So that's probably just a lie

[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:46.500]
By the way the FCC wants to go after AT&T and find them for a violating bill

[02:14:46.500 --> 02:14:49.820]
They do not call, which I hope they do, find them 80 billion dollars

[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:50.400]
That's fine

[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:51.200]
Right

[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.720]
How do we register? She says, what channels do we go through order to do so? I think 46 and 7, maybe 10

[02:14:57.640 --> 02:15:03.440]
How do we get rid of these assholes calling my house at 10 p.m.? I think the answer is please advise, says poor Misty

[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:05.780]
Well, I don't know what to tell you Misty because the reports I'm getting

[02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:11.440]
And of course there'll be some people in the audience saying, well you know if you wouldn't spend so much time at Toronto if you were down here

[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:17.260]
You'd really have more information about the Florida Do Not Call and about all this telephone and these unwanted calls

[02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:19.980]
And see one of the reasons I don't want to be there is you know what it is?

[02:15:19.980 --> 02:15:22.120]
It's that, too many of these calls

[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.060]
Bell South has a feature you can pay for

[02:15:26.860 --> 02:15:29.480]
Yeah, called Unknown Color Blocking

[02:15:29.480 --> 02:15:30.580]
Oh I know that, that sucks

[02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:35.880]
That sucks because then if you're getting a long distance call from somebody that you know, please I've been through that

[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:39.740]
Okay, I've called a friend down there and he got at the house

[02:15:39.740 --> 02:15:44.180]
Same thing, oh well, we don't accept calls from unrecognizable numbers

[02:15:44.180 --> 02:15:49.060]
And you'll have to like leave a 50 word message and you know, bullcrab

[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.780]
All of a sudden a horse ball stop that that's not the way to go

[02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:57.080]
The way to go is to get them to obey the law and start finding the crap out of them and cut the crap

[02:15:57.080 --> 02:16:03.020]
And the next time you get these calls you should immediately the first thing you ask is give me the name of the company you work for

[02:16:03.020 --> 02:16:07.800]
And where you're calling from and your phone number and then then you'll see what's going to happen

[02:16:08.240 --> 02:16:10.800]
And if they don't want to do it give them the Adalton immediately

[02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:12.840]
Cuss them out

[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:14.160]
When Adalcuss them out

[02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:17.840]
And if you can get the name of the company then just to report them

[02:16:18.580 --> 02:16:20.240]
And get them now, what how much is it?

[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:22.000]
A lot of notes, part of the total choice

[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.620]
$10,000 fine something like that

[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:25.000]
For each your fence

[02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.820]
$5670560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:16:31.820 --> 02:16:36.180]
As soft Lord has whipped up into a frenzy over the death and carnage over the insanity

[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:43.660]
Over the fact the CBSI is shedding tears because they have farmed off the Arraygan miniseries to show time that they know nobody's going to see it

[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:48.620]
They came into the right wing and our audience is going and you wonder why it's so we...

[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:52.660]
You know what it's like? It's like it's like it's like burglarizing an empty house

[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:54.140]
You know what I mean?

[02:16:54.980 --> 02:16:58.660]
Nobody's home, it's just easy pickings

[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:04.620]
And that's why the Republicans came along and they stole the damn election because everybody else in the country is sitting back

[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:05.920]
You're shlupping

[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:07.520]
They're all asleep

[02:17:07.520 --> 02:17:09.860]
They all got their finger up each other's ass

[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:13.560]
I'm kind of enjoying it too because George told me to do it

[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:16.440]
I think it's a finger, it's all of them

[02:17:16.440 --> 02:17:17.800]
It felt like a finger

[02:17:17.800 --> 02:17:19.320]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:23.200]
Yeah, listen, I got a question

[02:17:24.060 --> 02:17:25.200]
No, no chance

[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.540]
Here's a call from Poppano, hello

[02:17:27.540 --> 02:17:28.920]
Hi Neil, yes sir

[02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:32.240]
For myself, I'm just a sicker sports, I really am

[02:17:32.240 --> 02:17:37.060]
And I know it's on your list but I just want to have re-enter it, I can't stand it

[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:40.320]
But I want to ask you something regarding next year

[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:44.820]
I'm really afraid that I don't think there's going to be a presidential election next year

[02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:48.180]
I think once this administration realizes that they may not win

[02:17:48.180 --> 02:17:51.060]
They're going to find some way to keep the presidential...

[02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:54.380]
Well I have these new electronic voting machines that are very easy to fix

[02:17:54.380 --> 02:17:56.760]
So I mean we had to see the stories about that

[02:17:56.760 --> 02:17:59.000]
It's interesting, I read on my board

[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:01.600]
We had to stir in the website, they were about die-bold

[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:05.080]
And they contribute to GW's re-election campaign

[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:08.700]
They're the ones that make the machines and a bunch of college students that broke the code

[02:18:08.700 --> 02:18:12.100]
And they put all the stuff on the internet to show how easy it was to break through

[02:18:12.100 --> 02:18:13.740]
And now they're suing them, they're going after them

[02:18:13.740 --> 02:18:19.020]
And the universities, because of the fact they're claiming they're using confidential information

[02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:20.700]
And privileged information, all this other crap

[02:18:20.700 --> 02:18:24.480]
I mean if that doesn't show an appearance of impropriety

[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:27.460]
Yeah, like the fix is already in, I mean, it's incredible

[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:29.540]
And for this to...

[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:32.980]
Like you said, a lot of people, like their ostriches, they got their heads buried in the...

[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:35.560]
But not just a lot of people, but the media are leading away

[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:39.160]
The media are accomplices, they're co-conspirators, they're a bunch of lunatics

[02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:42.960]
And they don't have the balls, they've been totally intimidated and put in their place

[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:48.540]
And as a result, the only 99% of what the public gets is the crap from the media, which is all propaganda

[02:18:48.540 --> 02:18:53.880]
You mentioned a while back about watching the BBC or the KBC news

[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.900]
And that's all I watch now, I mean I cannot watch anything be cable, network news

[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:01.520]
I refuse to watch it, I don't read local newspapers

[02:19:02.900 --> 02:19:05.380]
I read publications from around the world

[02:19:05.380 --> 02:19:10.440]
I mean even just, even I do watch the BBC, but even watching like the local TV here in Toronto

[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:15.580]
And when it come on with the newscast, they don't just give you the powdery flowery or flag wave and stuff

[02:19:15.580 --> 02:19:17.920]
Because obviously Canada didn't participate in any of this

[02:19:17.920 --> 02:19:22.140]
When Bush came out and made that comment last week when they asked him at that press conference

[02:19:22.140 --> 02:19:25.900]
That the media at the White House about all of the bodies that were being...

[02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:30.920]
All the people being killed in his comment was well, it goes to show you that we were doing the right thing

[02:19:30.920 --> 02:19:33.040]
Because now they're really desperate, they're desperate

[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:35.600]
So they must really be desperate now with all the people that they're killing

[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:41.840]
And the report on a Canadian TV on CTV News was, this is like 1984 in Georgia all well over again

[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.540]
Good is bad and bad is good

[02:19:43.540 --> 02:19:44.880]
I remember well...

[02:19:44.880 --> 02:19:48.280]
It was exactly correct, you never heard that on the American TV so it stays in the West

[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:48.460]
No way!

[02:19:48.520 --> 02:19:49.820]
90% of it's propaganda

[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:53.880]
Tim Robbins was saying how, you know, if Congress decides we're going to go to war

[02:19:53.880 --> 02:19:56.980]
Then their children and their families should lead the charge

[02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:59.600]
And then we'll see how quickly they'll be willing to vote for you

[02:19:59.600 --> 02:20:00.620]
Hold your breath

[02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:01.300]
There you go

[02:20:01.300 --> 02:20:03.640]
Have a great day pal, hang in there, see you at the border

[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:08.600]
Yeah, when we start the next hour I'm going to read the couple of pages again from Michael Moore book

[02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:11.280]
Do you have the part about the media?

[02:20:12.060 --> 02:20:14.680]
And about the propaganda that the American people keep getting fed

[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.840]
Which is why most people don't have any idea what's really happening there

[02:20:18.460 --> 02:20:20.180]
And while we had so many people who were really...

[02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:21.820]
Of course you got a lot of stupid people to begin with

[02:20:21.820 --> 02:20:23.700]
But when you give the masses a lot of misinformation

[02:20:24.940 --> 02:20:27.340]
And disinformation, what the hell are they supposed to know?

[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:32.680]
And when you got like when you lost 3 million jobs since you were a stolen election 3 years ago

[02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:34.820]
You got a lot of people out there scrambling just to survive

[02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:40.520]
Who don't have time to be spending hours and hours scouring the internet trying to find out what hell's really going on in the world

[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:41.600]
They get looking for the truth

[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:48.640]
1256 at 560 WQM, how's the beast doing with balance for like do we have any idea?

[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:49.400]
No, we don't

[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:52.740]
Oh well anyway, summer's over, no more barbecues, no more vacations

[02:20:52.740 --> 02:20:54.980]

Everybody and their brother is peddling

[02:20:58.520 --> 02:21:01.900]
You know I noticed Dr. Phil yesterday because before the...

[02:21:01.900 --> 02:21:04.860]
Before some show that I watched Dr. Philazon maybe guiding light

[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:06.980]
And he's fat

[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:08.860]
Yeah, he's fat

[02:21:09.700 --> 02:21:12.760]
Well who the hell is Dr. Phil to be writing a damn diet book

[02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:16.540]
And telling other people lectures and all this other crap when he's a fat slob

[02:21:17.060 --> 02:21:20.380]

My, my, and local, this is sportswear-056-2-A-M

[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:39.860]
For the Spanternov since Phyllis Vida has won Natasha and I no longer have to look for motion squarer

[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:43.780]
Instead we listen to the near-roger's parallel balance one to two hour

[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:55.660]
No subtle hiding, a lot more than those

[02:22:56.980 --> 02:23:01.120]
They say their weapons of mass destruction

[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:08.660]
I say we sing a couple mega-times by my right

[02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:18.660]
In the Gulf War letting off the wolf

[02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:24.320]
I think it's time to give this butter wool

[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:32.240]
So it's time to load those wee ones up on their eyes

[02:23:34.320 --> 02:23:35.180]
Are you sure?

[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:37.900]
On their eyes

[02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:43.880]
Till there's nothing left to see on their eyes

[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:49.840]
Till stand and six feet deep on their eyes

[02:23:51.260 --> 02:23:55.320]
Blow up the creak while they're up

[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:04.880]
And their say has got some germs and chemicals that hurt

[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.360]
And that he might love in my postcards

[02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:16.280]
If we land the clear, we're not on the web

[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:20.760]
Because some of them stands won't be theirs

[02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.240]
I'm here up

[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:29.900]
And bring it to an end I'm here up

[02:24:29.900 --> 02:24:31.060]
Hey, Crably

[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:37.400]
We blow him up again I'm here up

[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:43.200]
And we'll fly on the sea and end I'm here up

[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:44.080]
Oh

[02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:46.840]
Bob era

[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:51.900]
Okay, the Pentagon is singing four people into that blast with the green zone

[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:54.900]
Is that like the red zone?

[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:56.720]
More like the green zone

[02:24:59.500 --> 02:25:03.300]
So where's the answer for Misty who sent us that desperate thanks about those

[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:06.280]
Oh, I wanted phone calls the Florida thanks whoever sent this in by the way

[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:09.240]
The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services maintains

[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:11.980]
The state of Florida does do not call list

[02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:16.300]
Florida residents who don't wish to receive sales calls may have the residential mobile or

[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:21.400]
Paging device phone number included on his list by paying an initial fee of ten bucks for each residential phone number

[02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:25.720]
A five dollar renewal fee for each residential phone numbers required for each year thereafter

[02:25:26.240 --> 02:25:30.980]
A small price to pay the fees are used to pay the expenses for operating the program and enforcing the law

[02:25:30.980 --> 02:25:35.480]
Residents who wish to join the program should call 1-800-HELP-FLA

[02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:44.460]
1-800-435-735-2-HELP-LIGH to receive an application or download the application in print and send it with your payment

[02:25:46.400 --> 02:25:51.780]
If you're on the list and get a call anyone who's on the list and receives a call that doesn't meet the exemptions outlined above

[02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:54.900]
Well, let's see what are the exemptions

[02:25:56.420 --> 02:26:04.300]
Solicitors may still call in response to the request of the person being called to enforce a contractor collected debt or to sell newspapers of descriptions

[02:26:04.920 --> 02:26:09.280]
Solicitors may also call any person with whom they solicitor has an existing see this is the problem

[02:26:10.460 --> 02:26:13.460]
With whom the solicitor has an existing or previous business relationship

[02:26:13.460 --> 02:26:20.500]
This is the problem so if you have like a city bank card an American express card a master card with a certain through a certain bank

[02:26:20.500 --> 02:26:28.400]
If a visa whatever the hell it is a serious charge card a bird eyes a a parking in a paratry a target a Walmart whatever

[02:26:29.260 --> 02:26:35.340]
Then they're exempted so what's the deal well what good does it do gets them some money

[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:40.800]
It's a state of Florida so money so I'm outsticked that away, but it's just not not my bag

[02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:46.160]
I don't want any unwanted calls I don't want any more than I want somebody knocking on my door and we hours in the morning or anybody else does

[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:48.600]
This is the kind of crap that's going on in America

[02:26:49.620 --> 02:26:51.960]
Anyway, Michael Moore writes in dude where's my country

[02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:56.140]
If you're going to sell a mess of whoppers you need a good advertising campaign

[02:26:56.140 --> 02:27:01.100]
Corporations paid big money for that kind of marketing but the Bush administration didn't have to spend a dime

[02:27:01.100 --> 02:27:08.380]
When the supposedly liberal media joined forces with the White House field office at Fox News to create a well-oraled pro-war propaganda offensive

[02:27:08.380 --> 02:27:09.960]
There was almost impossible to avoid

[02:27:10.700 --> 02:27:20.320]
And it worked even vegetarians were gobbling down these whoppers accompanied by round the clock patriotic march to war music and flag inspired graphics on the sorry excuses for news channels

[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:21.580]
The images were relentless

[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:29.000]
Teraful farewells from proud families as brave soldiers headed overseas heroic American girls rescued by daring American guys

[02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:36.840]
Smart bombs doing their brilliantly destructive work greatfully raki's toppling the Sodom statue a united America standing by our resolute and determined leader

[02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:43.360]
Then there was the footage beam directly to us from the harsher raki desert where reporters embedded with the ground troops

[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.280]
We're given great leeway to report without interference from the Pentagon as we are supposed to believe

[02:27:47.280 --> 02:27:56.940]
The result lots of up close and personal stories about the hardships and dangers faced by our military and virtually nothing examining why we had sent these fine young people in the harms way in the first place

[02:27:56.940 --> 02:27:59.920]
And there was even less said about what was happening to the people of Iraq

[02:28:01.020 --> 02:28:11.860]
So unless you ignored US news entirely and only watched the BBC or CBC or Les Journal from France with its convenient English subtitles for an American audience too lazy and too poorly educated learn another language

[02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:15.920]
You could pretty quickly find yourself believing that all the sacrifice was for a valid cause

[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:19.580]
And just exactly what was the reason for the war with Iraq?

[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:31.920]
We were so thoroughly whopperized that Paul showed that half of all Americans wrongly thought that a raki's were on the September 11th planes and at one point nearly half believed that the US had found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when no such discovery had been made

[02:28:32.760 --> 02:28:38.860]
One quarter of those surveyed thought that Sodom had unleashed a chemical or biological attack against coalition forces which also hadn't happened

[02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:48.340]
The widespread misconceptions were understandable. It was almost impossible to hear the perspective of anyone who questioned to oppose the Bush administration's rationale for rushing to war on American television

[02:28:48.860 --> 02:29:00.900]
The media watchdog group Fear studied the evening newscast of 6 TV US TV networks and news channels for three weeks starting on March 20th 2003 the day after the US bombing of Iraq began

[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:09.380]
The study examined the affiliations and views of more than 1600 sources who appeared on camera in stories about Iraq the results were hardly a surprise

[02:29:09.900 --> 02:29:15.800]
Viewers were 25 times more likely to see a pro war US source than someone with an anti-war pro-up point of view

[02:29:15.800 --> 02:29:19.160]
Military sources were featured twice as frequently as civilians

[02:29:19.900 --> 02:29:25.720]
Only 4% of sources appearing during the three weeks were affiliated with universities think tanks or non-governmental organizations

[02:29:26.600 --> 02:29:35.080]
Of a total of 840 US sources who were current or former government or military officials only 4 were identified as opposing the war that's out of 840

[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:44.560]
The few appearances by people with anti-war viewpoints were consistently limited to one sentence sound bites usually from unidentified participants on the street interviews

[02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:49.580]
Not a single one of the six telecast study conducted a sit down interview with anyone who opposed the war

[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:59.280]
In some cases journalists freely confessed was startling lack of objectivity the first study quoted CBS news anchor Dan Radler during an appearance with Larry King on CNN

[02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:07.560]
Look I'm an American I never tried to kid anybody that I'm some internationalist or something and when my country is at war I want my country to win whatever the definition of win may be

[02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:12.560]
Now I can't and don't argue that that is coverage without a prejudice about that I'm prejudiced he said

[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:26.880]
What an asshole during the three week study period fair found only one anti-war sound bite on rather CBS evening news was made by me meaning Michael Moore at the Academy Awards talking about the fictitious war wage bar fictitious president

[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:31.740]
Over at Fox News Neil Cavuto had this to say on air in response to a critic

[02:30:31.740 --> 02:30:37.460]
There's nothing wrong with taking sides here. You see no difference between a government that oppresses people of one that does not but I do

[02:30:38.700 --> 02:30:46.740]
MSNBC defend demonstrated its patriotism with America's bravest the billboard of photographs of military personnel fighting the war sent for display by their friends and families

[02:30:47.620 --> 02:30:57.640]
And Brian Williams of MSNBC and NBC said this about the killing of Iraqi civilians civilians used to be intentional military targets the fire bombings of the resident Tokyo and W.W.

[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:06.240]
W.2 or meant to kill civilians and then terrorized survivors here. We've seen the opposite happen the Army recently signed a $470 million

[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:20.940]
dollar contract with Microsoft which is co-owner of MSNBC along with NBC NBC is intern owned by General Electric one of the nation's largest defense contractors GE's military aircraft engine contracts run in the billions but the first that he found that NBC actually featured more to sending

[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:32.180]
Viewpoints about the war a whopping 1% more than any of the other US networks and on a coast Michael Moore do words my country ought to be reading it. He won't how many people in the audience you think you're going to or I have read that book

[02:31:32.180 --> 02:31:32.760]
I'm going to read it.

[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:33.740]
God damn it man.

[02:31:33.880 --> 02:31:35.400]
Cops, so you better read it to us.

[02:31:36.940 --> 02:31:37.640]
Oh yeah.

[02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:41.980]
Yeah, if you want to drive our way down to about a point three share that other to it.

[02:31:43.700 --> 02:31:49.040]
Like I said before you can't force feed the public man you can't give them what they don't want what they don't care about.

[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.520]
Here's the story about CBS.

[02:31:51.800 --> 02:32:00.420]
It was under heat from conservative groups that called the four hour film unfair and inaccurate CBS says it found it didn't present a balanced portrait after all.

[02:32:00.420 --> 02:32:06.600]
Yeah, we decided this was not an easy to ship it off the show time that there were cowardly racing like that.

[02:32:06.680 --> 02:32:08.920]
Not that we're caving in the way they like that.

[02:32:09.460 --> 02:32:09.900]
No.

[02:32:11.300 --> 02:32:23.880]
You know what it reminds me of reminds me of the thing that remember Mike Wallace nearly got can for that the thing he did about the tobacco companies right which was a good movie was a great movie with the al Pacino for Dustin Hoffman Russell Crowe.

[02:32:23.880 --> 02:32:24.300]
No.

[02:32:25.200 --> 02:32:26.440]
Was al Pacino with it?

[02:32:26.540 --> 02:32:26.880]
I don't know.

[02:32:27.220 --> 02:32:28.500]
I think I think so.

[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:29.600]
Somebody will know.

[02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:34.280]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 team for rise from wireless line.

[02:32:34.340 --> 02:32:35.280]
We got no games today.

[02:32:35.440 --> 02:32:37.260]
Panthers play LA in the arena tomorrow night.

[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.600]
So we got the man dog at two the hopper at four the big seven any 10.

[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:43.220]
Joe and Mark what the insider.

[02:32:44.740 --> 02:32:46.760]
That was the name of the movie the insider great.

[02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:50.480]
Well, I'm sure that Scott will look it up or I'll do it during the break.

[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:50.820]
Okay.

[02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:53.020]
I think Al Pacino was in there.

[02:32:53.500 --> 02:32:54.700]
Maybe it was Dustin Hoffman.

[02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:56.600]
Maybe it was Russell Crowe.

[02:32:57.140 --> 02:32:58.000]
He would be excited.

[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:06.100]
How about the outsiders 12 minutes after one I'm just I'm limped from all of this because it's just amazing.

[02:33:06.300 --> 02:33:11.960]
How many times have I said this 1000s and thousands of times over the years that I'm just never amazed.

[02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:15.000]
There are never ceases to amaze me the degree of indifference.

[02:33:15.760 --> 02:33:17.400]
You know, especially our crowd man.

[02:33:17.540 --> 02:33:17.980]
They don't care.

[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:19.640]
They just don't give a flying F.

[02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:23.860]
We can't have like thousands and thousands of bodies.

[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:26.320]
It could start to be the Vietnam two all over again.

[02:33:26.320 --> 02:33:30.160]
And if anybody wondered oh well, we're never you know you never repeat history.

[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:35.880]
Well, never again all these other cliches, but the only problem is we keep making the same mistakes and doing the same things over and over again.

[02:33:36.040 --> 02:33:36.680]
We never learn.

[02:33:37.500 --> 02:33:38.220]
Never ever.

[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:44.220]
And a public out there is what are we going to do about the dolphins man the seasons on a way down the toilet.

[02:33:45.620 --> 02:33:48.500]
I thought those people were still celebrating the Marlon victory in the world series.

[02:33:48.500 --> 02:33:50.580]

[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:56.360]
Hey imagine is that amazing or what is that unbelievable we want to refund it.

[02:33:56.480 --> 02:33:59.240]
We just bought it as like a prop for the parades man.

[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:00.720]
We don't want to really keep this thing.

[02:34:01.200 --> 02:34:02.020]
We wouldn't know man.

[02:34:02.220 --> 02:34:02.320]

They got that fed jury knockman on there in MSNBC.

[02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:12.300]
The CBS decision to schmit can't arrange it out.

[02:37:12.440 --> 02:37:13.140]
It's all about money.

[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.700]
The licensing of the whole of the aller.

[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.560]
You know what's how quietly that disappeared.

[02:37:24.160 --> 02:37:26.100]
The overturning of the FCC decision.

[02:37:26.340 --> 02:37:27.740]
Forget about it and can't happen.

[02:37:29.320 --> 02:37:32.240]
CBS dumps Reagan many series and what this is from news day.

[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:34.680]
And what could rank as the biggest TV program cancellation

[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:37.200]
New to political pressure since William Paley sacked

[02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:39.380]
the smothers brothers comedy hour in 1969.

[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:44.780]
CBS has dumped its mid-November sweep series The Regans.

[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.740]
This decision is based solely on our reaction to seeing the final film.

[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:51.060]
Not the controversy that erupted around a draft of the script.

[02:37:51.060 --> 02:37:53.060]
CBS said the statement released a short time ago.

[02:37:53.480 --> 02:37:56.820]
Although the many series features impressive production values and acting performances.

[02:37:57.180 --> 02:37:59.900]
And although the producers have sources to verify each scene in the script.

[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:03.740]
We believe it does not present a balanced portrayal of the Regans for CBS in its audience.

[02:38:04.200 --> 02:38:06.880]
Subsequent edits that we considered did not address those concerns.

[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:16.460]
The decision the cancel was made last night after top CBS executives had gathered in New York for the network 75th anniversary special on Sunday.

[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:20.260]
Although CBS chief Leslie Moonves had reportedly been mulling a cancellation.

[02:38:20.260 --> 02:38:24.580]
Ever since an article in New York Times to which you revealed that some of the dialogue had been fabricated.

[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:29.060]
A formal network announcement is expected later today in which what we already just had that.

[02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:35.100]
The expected move has already stunned the entire TV industry in particular the so-called long form portion of TV.

[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:38.520]
Which makes TV movies and has been deep and deep recession for years.

[02:38:38.880 --> 02:38:43.520]
But movies like the Regans based on real life subjects have been consistently successful and controversial.

[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:48.780]
A CBS mini series based on Hitler which aired in May had also been attacked by numerous groups.

[02:38:48.780 --> 02:38:50.740]
Flaiming the script had humanized the dictator.

[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:55.560]
CBS quickly re-edited the movie and the emphasis on a youthful Hitler hit the cutting room floor.

[02:38:56.460 --> 02:39:07.200]
But the Reagan biopic was apparently immune to radical surgery among lines that were expected to be ex-sized by CBS censors before air was one about Reagan declaring that people with AIDS in effect should die for their sins.

[02:39:08.100 --> 02:39:12.340]
The line became a lightning rod for critics of the film, including numerous pro-reg in groups.

[02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:16.900]
Reagan's son Michael, a right-wing tacos appearing on ABC's Good Morning America this morning,

[02:39:17.080 --> 02:39:22.280]
said he had recently seen an even eclipse of the movie adding it's appalling to see my dad in a way I'd never seen him.

[02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:28.600]
Reagan added that he had shown a clip to his mother and told her that the producers don't like dad but they hate you.

[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.920]
He also said my dad would be upset to put words in his mouth.

[02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:36.200]
We're talking about a man who was the president of the U.S. who went at the Cold War and to put words in his mouth.

[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:41.960]
Another thing you should know about it, my father is his godly, this man have him say Nancy Goddammett shut up.

[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:46.160]
He never used God's name in vain. It's just an absurdity. Can you believe he said that Goddammett?

[02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:48.620]
No way. Jose. Not Ronnie Reagan.

[02:39:50.100 --> 02:39:55.620]
The four-hour mini was through a beginner ring November 16 and was the keystone of the number centering of Ember Sweep strategy.

[02:39:55.620 --> 02:40:00.700]
The move not only demolishes that strategy but could force the number to give back millions of dollars to advertisers

[02:40:00.700 --> 02:40:05.460]
would already bought time in the mini which was expected draw high ratings.

[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:13.860]
However CBS also faced the threat of advertisers boycott so as the controversy grew suddenly unexpectedly found itself in a loose-lose situation.

[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:14.640]
How do you like that?

[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:16.560]
I don't.

[02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:20.600]
How political are we? How profit hungry are we?

[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:27.000]
I think it's going to be a very, very bad effect on the morale of people who work and sell stuff to CBS.

[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:34.180]
Nothing is the vision but the company itself. I think it's a lesson, a cautionary tale for all of us in the broadcasting business

[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:44.160]
that the era of these so-owner pioneers are gone. There is no more Leonard Goldinson at ABC. There is no more Bob Starnow owning essentially NBC.

[02:40:44.660 --> 02:40:50.060]
There is not more Bill Paley at CBS and it's a very different corporate slash political world now.

[02:40:50.060 --> 02:40:57.720]
Ten seconds before let you go. If there weren't the big campaign, a lot of comments on talk radio about this.

[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:04.800]
If talk radio weren't geared up as much as it is now to go against and take on a project like this, would this have happened?

[02:41:05.140 --> 02:41:14.220]
Who knows but you can't just look at the talk radio. There's this other animal called cable TV news which has also picked up the cudgel right and gone with it for several weeks now.

[02:41:14.220 --> 02:41:20.860]
Six or eight hours a day on a meeting Fox, meaning Fox, the Fox fascist Nazi news network is what he's talking about.

[02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:26.460]
560, 560, 560 on the AT&T line. Here's Wellington. Hello.

[02:41:26.680 --> 02:41:27.700]
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

[02:41:27.980 --> 02:41:35.820]
Okay, pal. It's incredible. The whitewashing and the bull crap and people just stuck it up. They just take it for granted.

[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:40.840]
Like, oh, okay, it's supposed to be this way. I got this in franchise. I can't vote today.

[02:41:41.520 --> 02:41:49.100]
Why is that? Well, I moved out of the county and I said, I might create work to have on my address change. I got my drivers license change and all that other crap.

[02:41:49.100 --> 02:41:54.620]
But I just went out of the courthouse up here in Bombay. And I'm just in franchise. Thanks a lot, Mr. Elephant. You can't.

[02:41:54.700 --> 02:42:03.300]
Nice going, Murray. I'm you idiot. More on. I can't vote. But of course I have a new form. I can re-register not, you know, that it makes any difference for today.

[02:42:03.720 --> 02:42:10.300]
No, it'll be a loss to the mail anyway. But thank goodness it wasn't a presidential election today because they already stole the last one, right?

[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:19.520]
How many more? How many more? You ain't seen nothing yet, pal. He just weighed. Well, that earlier call, uh, collar kind of spooked me a little bit.

[02:42:19.680 --> 02:42:28.380]
And I've been worrying about this myself for several months. That when the dog goes down the word, don't use the word spook in Murray, Meliphon, the same couple of paragraphs there.

[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:34.260]
We'll start getting all kind of people right. Yeah, okay. Yeah. I'll be just in franchise from up here. That is correct.

[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:41.780]
No, just wipe me off. But what's going to happen in the next election? Are we really going to have an election? I'm going to have more than one party.

[02:42:42.740 --> 02:42:53.020]
And also what you were saying about CBS and all about money, America's a business. It's got to be some dirty dealings because these people don't want the truth to come out about it all, Ronnie.

[02:42:53.500 --> 02:43:04.160]
Right. That's right. They don't want anybody else to be. I mean, wouldn't it be awfully embarrassing for America and for the right wingers for the entire world to realize that this man was had Alzheimer's.

[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:13.000]
Uh, early into his second prison, a man who had his finger on a button that could have blown the whole goddamn world up. And he didn't know whether it was on the button or up his ass.

[02:43:13.340 --> 02:43:24.520]
And so why should we surprise that he forgot all about that around country and Ali North and all that stuff? Oh, it was just a figment of your imagination. What do you think about? Right. Okay, pal, hang in there. I'll see you at the border. Right on. We'll send a limiter. Pick you up.

[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:31.680]
5 6 7. Everybody's called an agro falls. We'll send a bunch of limos and buses over there to pick you up and you can live in a civilized place.

[02:43:32.260 --> 02:43:44.680]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line. Look at that. Ben and JLo 185 all of the above 137 Elizabeth smart 25. So in other words, Ben and JLo is so far demolishing.

[02:43:44.680 --> 02:43:56.840]
Oh, another one we should put on here, even though it's embarrassing to put it on there, but it'll get votes. Yeah, these are the least interested in the war in Iraq. No, I thought that actually. Yeah, oh no, it'll get votes.

[02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:05.640]
The war in Iraq because we have a lot of ostriches out there. We have a lot of people think if they bury their heads in the sand, it'll just go away. And after all, these are, these people are dying over there.

[02:44:05.640 --> 02:44:12.420]
They're not their friends or relatives or sons or brothers or daughters. It's, uh, it ain't them. Only if you bury your head in Iraq, he's hand. Right. There you go.

[02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:15.360]
And maybe while you're at it, you can look around for some more oil.

[02:44:16.100 --> 02:44:18.120]
5 6 7. Everybody's called an agro falls.

[02:44:18.120 --> 02:44:25.740]
5 6 7. Everybody's called an agro falls. We're here.

[02:44:25.740 --> 02:44:28.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:45.480]
Oh, if you can't find a sum of bomber rack, if the markets are a drama bomber rack, if the terrorists are risking Pakistan is looking 50 North Korea is too risky bomber rack.

[02:44:46.080 --> 02:44:57.840]
If we have no allies with us bomber rack, if we think that someone's sister's bomber rack, so to help with the inspections, let's look up for them.

[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:17.560]
Oh, oh, you've heard this agree will call the trees and let's make more than half the season even if we have no reason bomber rack.

[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:26.780]
131 at 560 WQM. I'm looking back in Michael Moore, dude, where is my country page 210? He goes on. I'd forgotten just how lengthy he went on praising West Clark.

[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:31.180]
He doesn't really endorse him in here, but he has a lot of good things to say, including he just might win.

[02:45:31.960 --> 02:45:38.900]
And he says the Democrats might be very nervous about that because they have a tendency to put up candidates who can't possibly win even a fixed election. Al Gore proved that.

[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.040]
But he has a lot of good things to say about Howard Dean and Dennis Kassinich, other than he's got a bad haircut and he can't win.

[02:45:48.320 --> 02:45:51.760]
Jewish leaders wage campaign against Jews for Jesus in Palm Beach County.

[02:45:51.980 --> 02:45:57.880]
Oi! Alarm that a plant boy attended these good old religions, man. They just all love each other, don't they?

[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:08.880]
Sure. Jews for Jesus, my ass. Alarm that a plant campaign targeting their followers, Jewish leaders in Palm Beach County are waging their own campaign to warn their people away from the war.

[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:17.600]
And Jews for Jesus, look out for them. They want you. And they lie. Rally seminars and the thank God the other religions don't lie.

[02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:27.400]
Thank God. Rally seminars and big newspaper ads will attempt to blunt the Christian organizations' effectiveness before it's plant countywide blitz. Blitz or blitz? Blitz next month.

[02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:29.860]
If they were going to free blitzers, man, they could convert everybody.

[02:46:29.960 --> 02:46:32.000]
The blitz blitz. Especially the blueberry ones.

[02:46:32.860 --> 02:46:38.240]
Jews for Jesus typically draws iron for its claim that one can be Jewish and believe in Jesus at the same time.

[02:46:38.620 --> 02:46:46.360]
Right. Their offensive had made Jewish people uncomfortable, said Rabbi Joel Levine of West Palm Beach, chairman of the Messianic Task Force, part of the Jewish...

[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:48.080]
The Messianic Task Force?

[02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:53.580]
That's right. Part of the Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County and they exclude others from heaven if you disagree with them.

[02:46:53.580 --> 02:47:00.640]
For their part, Jews for Jesus insist they're simply taking the issue of Jesus to the public and the accused Jewish groups of intolerance.

[02:47:01.440 --> 02:47:09.640]
Right. I find it a shame that some people want to squal through minority voice, said Stan Meyer, Jews for Jesus South Florida director who lives in North Lauderdale.

[02:47:10.020 --> 02:47:15.800]
Hey Stan, Caxelhois. They can disagree with us, but they should teach respect for those with different opinions, he says.

[02:47:15.800 --> 02:47:25.320]
The Palm Beach County blitz is part of a worldwide plan aimed to hit 65 areas that are home to 25,000 more Jews by 2006 dubbed the Hold Your God.

[02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:32.360]
The campaigns have been conducted in number of cities around the world, including Los Angeles in December, London and Toronto this summer.

[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:38.760]
I must have missed it. And Dallas last month, Broward and David counties are planned for 2004, so look out now.

[02:47:39.840 --> 02:47:48.200]
My, my, my called saturation campaigns, the blitzes bring to the Eurethraeor 4th US evangelist wearing t-shirts and driving vans sport in the Jews for Jesus logo.

[02:47:48.620 --> 02:47:51.900]
They'll pass out Jews for Jesus, tracks in about how many locations?

[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:53.060]
About third man.

[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:57.920]
Also part of the operation will be direct mail phone calls into concert at FA and U. Can that great?

[02:47:58.500 --> 02:47:58.840]
Oh yeah.

[02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:00.060]
Jews for Jesus.

[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:01.300]
Jesus Christ.

[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:04.760]
That's like a Hindus for Buddha, right?

[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:06.960]
They did absorb Buddha, actually the Hindus.

[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:09.880]
Well, like I said, that was a very bad example.

[02:48:10.100 --> 02:48:10.720]
Did they really?

[02:48:11.020 --> 02:48:11.180]
Yeah.

[02:48:11.320 --> 02:48:14.020]
What do they really absorb, the more absorbed to Buddhism?

[02:48:14.340 --> 02:48:16.860]
So they said, Oh, Buddha is actually one of our many, many gods.

[02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:18.920]
Well, I can't say it's like Protestants for Krishna.

[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:19.880]
Okay.

[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:21.040]
Okay, is that better?

[02:48:22.260 --> 02:48:24.840]
It's like Catholics for Abraham, Solomon.

[02:48:25.800 --> 02:48:29.540]
Oh speaking of that, how do I let the show go so far in?

[02:48:29.540 --> 02:48:31.120]
Because we get important stuff like sports.

[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:34.960]
Well, no, this is very important because I'm glad.

[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:37.720]
Now I understand why they were taking their Marlon calves back, you see.

[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:40.480]
We didn't understand the rationale we were knocking on people.

[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:41.900]
I think you owe them an apology.

[02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:42.580]
I apologize.

[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:43.640]
I apologize.

[02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:46.280]
Cats catch your Ivan Rodriguez.

[02:48:46.560 --> 02:48:49.400]
Pudge the old Pudge Meister file for free agency yesterday.

[02:48:49.800 --> 02:48:52.720]
Just nine days after offering the Florida Marlins win the World Series.

[02:48:53.620 --> 02:48:57.820]
Pudge also became a free agent after the 2002 season when he didn't find a deal that

[02:48:57.820 --> 02:49:02.060]
was lucky he agreed January 20 to a $10 million one year contract with the Marlins with

[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:02.500]
the fish.

[02:49:03.740 --> 02:49:06.420]
He was voted MVP in the NL Championship series.

[02:49:06.660 --> 02:49:09.240]
Rodriguez had long been represented by Jeff Moore ad.

[02:49:09.360 --> 02:49:12.760]
He switched agents this year and will have Scott Boris negotiate his new deal.

[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:13.940]
Oh, look out.

[02:49:14.560 --> 02:49:18.580]
Through other Marlins filed for free agency Monday outfielders Todd Hollinsworth and Gerald

[02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:18.900]
Williams.

[02:49:19.440 --> 02:49:22.800]
He lived in players filed and all reason the total money for so the Pudge and the Fudge

[02:49:22.800 --> 02:49:25.620]
Meister I think he's Pudge packing is what it is.

[02:49:25.660 --> 02:49:26.840]
Don't look through good Scott does it.

[02:49:26.900 --> 02:49:27.280]
We won't see him.

[02:49:27.540 --> 02:49:28.280]
Money is over.

[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.040]
Is it?

[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:30.120]
That sure is.

[02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:32.620]
Well, I didn't last too long was it about two weeks?

[02:49:33.060 --> 02:49:33.580]
If that.

[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:38.360]
Now it wasn't even two weeks it was one week according to the callers.

[02:49:38.460 --> 02:49:41.220]
It was the day after the parade was a week ago today.

[02:49:42.540 --> 02:49:45.060]
Well no, some of those people who went to came out they were psychically.

[02:49:45.060 --> 02:49:47.540]
They knew there was going to be no more Pudge and they said, hey, I'm not keeping his damn

[02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:47.760]
cap.

[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:48.900]
I want my money back.

[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:50.260]
It was just for show.

[02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:55.340]
Florida students suspended for safer sex costume.

[02:49:56.060 --> 02:49:57.160]
This is in Kassimi.

[02:49:58.480 --> 02:50:02.220]
Oceola high school administrators thought our students Halloween costume was more trick

[02:50:02.220 --> 02:50:05.400]
than treat so they suspended her ass and the rest of her too.

[02:50:06.800 --> 02:50:11.160]
Linessa re-obed 16 was told to go to her home Friday after wearing a t-shirt decorated

[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:12.120]
with condoms.

[02:50:12.920 --> 02:50:16.820]
Linessa says she decided on the costume after seeing safe sex commercials on TV.

[02:50:18.720 --> 02:50:20.960]
Maybe there were like 20 or 30 condoms on anything.

[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:22.320]
Maybe she was just going to a party.

[02:50:23.140 --> 02:50:24.900]
Maybe the lot of my friends are sexually active.

[02:50:24.900 --> 02:50:26.120]
Rio told the Orlando Sentinel.

[02:50:26.120 --> 02:50:27.780]
I tell them if you're going to do it, be safe.

[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:33.060]
Rio btate condoms to a white shirt teacher and began passing them out to her classmates.

[02:50:33.560 --> 02:50:34.960]
Her first period teacher.

[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:37.200]
That's with a hyphen.

[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:41.800]
Her first period teacher alerted school administrators who sent her home with a three-day suspension

[02:50:41.800 --> 02:50:42.860]
for class disruption.

[02:50:43.160 --> 02:50:45.160]
They also said she had an insulin attitude.

[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:46.480]
Bitch.

[02:50:47.320 --> 02:50:50.880]
Oceola high principal Chuck Perredizo later reduced his suspension to one day.

[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:52.280]
This is not acceptable.

[02:50:52.420 --> 02:50:54.700]
He said this is something you don't do in a public school.

[02:50:55.480 --> 02:50:56.560]
Hand out condoms.

[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.960]
I bet you the Pope wasn't too happy about it either.

[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:03.080]
Rio b's mother Melissa supported her daughter's decision even helped her get condoms for the

[02:51:03.080 --> 02:51:03.480]
costume.

[02:51:04.060 --> 02:51:07.600]
Sex could be deadly and people need to know that Melissa said, I just can't believe this

[02:51:07.600 --> 02:51:09.040]
is spend it her for doing something good.

[02:51:09.360 --> 02:51:10.320]
Trying to educate kids.

[02:51:10.620 --> 02:51:13.220]
Trying to like teach them, hey, you ought to have some of these just in case, okay?

[02:51:14.280 --> 02:51:18.360]
Candy is dandy but a condom is, you know, I was saying go, you know what it is.

[02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:18.880]
Sure.

[02:51:20.280 --> 02:51:21.040]
Don't get wet.

[02:51:21.480 --> 02:51:22.980]
Yeah, don't rubber unless you got a rubber.

[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:25.880]
So there you go.

[02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:26.660]
Same old crap.

[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:27.700]
Everybody's getting suspended.

[02:51:27.940 --> 02:51:29.200]
Everybody's getting a, you can't do this.

[02:51:29.380 --> 02:51:30.000]
You can't say that.

[02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:31.840]
The CBS can't show the Reagan miniseries.

[02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:33.140]
We can't say anything no more.

[02:51:33.300 --> 02:51:37.860]
We got the Patriot Act parts one through a hundred and the public is going like that.

[02:51:38.080 --> 02:51:40.000]
And one thing about our audience, Vand, they're at least consistent.

[02:51:40.560 --> 02:51:40.780]
Right?

[02:51:40.980 --> 02:51:41.100]
They care.

[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:43.720]
Over the years, they've at least always been consistent.

[02:51:44.900 --> 02:51:48.100]
About the only time they get whipped up is when it has to do with some good old ethnic

[02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:48.920]
hate like alien.

[02:51:49.260 --> 02:51:51.480]
Then the phone was smoking, man.

[02:51:51.840 --> 02:51:55.840]
There was special physical smoke coming from our phone bank.

[02:51:56.320 --> 02:51:59.180]
Oh, that was the, oh, is the water pipe?

[02:51:59.960 --> 02:52:01.760]
No, seriously, the phones were on fire.

[02:52:01.980 --> 02:52:02.140]
Sure.

[02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:07.960]
Because, and we heard from people that will never hear from again ever, including a lot

[02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:13.780]
of hysterical women on both sides, both sides of the fence, outside, Maris Grisi,

[02:52:13.780 --> 02:52:15.620]
CBS's house and inside the fence.

[02:52:16.240 --> 02:52:17.520]
And alien, I was at a back ward.

[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:18.220]
Oh, is it playing?

[02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:19.020]
Take me home.

[02:52:19.140 --> 02:52:19.580]
Take me home.

[02:52:19.580 --> 02:52:20.000]
Is it playing?

[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:22.720]
Oh, you didn't say that alien what you said was, oh, don't take me.

[02:52:23.560 --> 02:52:24.080]
Remember that?

[02:52:24.320 --> 02:52:24.660]
That was beautiful.

[02:52:25.560 --> 02:52:26.700]
Here's a call from Pompano.

[02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:26.960]
Hello?

[02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:28.120]
Daniel.

[02:52:28.440 --> 02:52:28.900]
Yes, sir.

[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:30.000]
How you doing today?

[02:52:30.340 --> 02:52:30.720]
Pretty good.

[02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:31.520]
All right.

[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:35.580]
A couple weeks ago, I was down in Miami and I was on my way out.

[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:40.280]
Coming back up to Broward and I heard on the station that they were selling your merchandise

[02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:44.880]
there, I bought my estate and so I stopped by, bought my keychain, my CD and everything

[02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:45.740]
like I do every year.

[02:52:46.060 --> 02:52:46.500]
Thank you.

[02:52:47.060 --> 02:52:51.820]
But I don't want to say just heart and I just, I was real surprised that you didn't have

[02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:52.920]
that condolence a bit longer.

[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:55.540]
I know they stopped making you pay it on the air, but.

[02:52:55.700 --> 02:52:56.500]
You know, I get this a lot.

[02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:59.680]
So maybe you'll explain it to the audience on, you know, all at once.

[02:53:00.760 --> 02:53:01.960]
Well, I mean, explain what?

[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:03.840]
It was just that thing had to go away.

[02:53:04.040 --> 02:53:05.200]
It wasn't our option.

[02:53:05.320 --> 02:53:06.660]
We didn't have the option to put it on there.

[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:07.340]
It had to disappear.

[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:08.520]
Oh, okay.

[02:53:08.520 --> 02:53:10.060]
They made it from offer we couldn't refuse.

[02:53:10.800 --> 02:53:11.120]
Okay.

[02:53:11.160 --> 02:53:11.880]
That's too damn bad.

[02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:16.120]
You see, we have people like that one shmuck that called earlier, who's just a chronic

[02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:17.140]
idiot from Coral Gables.

[02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:18.180]
We have people out there.

[02:53:18.280 --> 02:53:19.600]
You know, well, you're a hypocrite and all of this other.

[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:21.140]
I see I need the cash.

[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:24.600]
If I was one of those people who was independently wealthy, first of all, I wouldn't be here anyway.

[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:28.620]
But secondly, if I was, I'd say, hey, if you don't like it, screw off, but I can't do

[02:53:28.620 --> 02:53:29.060]
that, see?

[02:53:29.420 --> 02:53:30.280]
Because I don't own the place.

[02:53:31.040 --> 02:53:31.800]
Yeah, I love that.

[02:53:31.900 --> 02:53:33.140]
I think it won't work, man.

[02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:33.780]
I got a plan.

[02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:34.120]
I'm a plan.

[02:53:34.820 --> 02:53:36.780]
Everybody at work wants to get a copy of that.

[02:53:37.140 --> 02:53:38.920]
Well, then they put the item one on there.

[02:53:40.020 --> 02:53:41.760]
Yeah, it says Condi Revisit.

[02:53:42.100 --> 02:53:42.380]
Right.

[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:44.680]
I got to poke a Brian has his hand on it.

[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:48.700]
Yeah, that's the one we can play.

[02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:49.760]
All right.

[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:52.060]
Well, I was just hoping it was going to be on there.

[02:53:52.060 --> 02:53:53.780]
I was going to make some tapes or a butt deal.

[02:53:53.940 --> 02:53:54.480]
I've never been on there.

[02:53:54.660 --> 02:53:56.660]
Well, just remember, sir, just remember where you are.

[02:53:56.780 --> 02:53:58.300]
Look around and remember you're in the good old USA.

[02:53:58.720 --> 02:53:59.340]
Keep that in mind.

[02:53:59.940 --> 02:54:00.300]
All right, Neil.

[02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:00.780]
Yeah, we good day.

[02:54:00.840 --> 02:54:01.320]
You too, George.

[02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:02.460]
Thanks, Pally.

[02:54:02.740 --> 02:54:03.240]
Thanks for your help.

[02:54:04.060 --> 02:54:05.860]
He's got a good point, but we just can't play it.

[02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:06.600]
We can't play that one.

[02:54:06.700 --> 02:54:08.780]
We can't play Kiss and a Grigid Morning because of the fact

[02:54:08.780 --> 02:54:11.200]
that we were management was sufficiently intimidated.

[02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:13.460]
Every time somebody farts, oh, jeez.

[02:54:13.600 --> 02:54:14.200]
You know, it's that.

[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:16.300]
And that's why there's no link to our website anymore

[02:54:16.300 --> 02:54:17.880]
on a QM website and vice versa.

[02:54:18.260 --> 02:54:19.680]
You know, payback is a bitch.

[02:54:20.040 --> 02:54:22.340]
We'll have people that appear in says with the disc in their hand

[02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:23.600]
and the money and the other one.

[02:54:23.720 --> 02:54:26.460]
Look at the back of the disc and then realize that neither one of those bits

[02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:27.340]
are on there and right.

[02:54:27.560 --> 02:54:29.240]
And they're not going to be put it right down and done.

[02:54:29.660 --> 02:54:31.820]
Including, by the way, some people would get to this

[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:34.540]
so they could use those bits to stir up all the crap all over again.

[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:35.820]
No, no one would do that.

[02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:37.020]
No, they wouldn't do that.

[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:37.700]
Would they, you think?

[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:38.220]
Uh-huh.

[02:54:38.260 --> 02:54:39.260]
Oh, what a shock.

[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:41.900]
Not good, honest, better than holier than now.

[02:54:42.000 --> 02:54:43.940]
Christians like those who are so much better than we are.

[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.180]
But those older calls are never wrong.

[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:48.500]
We are sports radio fighters.

[02:54:49.700 --> 02:54:50.100]
UAM.

[02:54:51.860 --> 02:54:52.840]
Those calls for day.

[02:54:53.140 --> 02:54:55.800]
This broad has been calling everybody except my mother.

[02:54:55.900 --> 02:54:56.460]
She had that number.

[02:54:56.540 --> 02:54:57.340]
She'd call that one too.

[02:54:58.000 --> 02:54:59.400]
For like days and days.

[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:02.260]
What business is it a view fascist at Fox News

[02:55:02.260 --> 02:55:04.260]
to be telling us what to be playing on your mime?

[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:06.200]
Or any other place, even in New York for that matter?

[02:55:06.960 --> 02:55:09.520]
You also call up Howard Stern and tell him what the hell to say on the year.

[02:55:09.760 --> 02:55:10.720]
And everybody else in IMS.

[02:55:11.180 --> 02:55:12.360]
Everybody else on here in New York.

[02:55:12.620 --> 02:55:13.640]
What the hell is it your business?

[02:55:13.740 --> 02:55:17.020]
In addition to which all this business about balanced and fair.

[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:19.160]
Like I said, all fascism all day.

[02:55:19.500 --> 02:55:20.360]
Unbalanced unfair.

[02:55:20.740 --> 02:55:21.160]
All spin.

[02:55:21.960 --> 02:55:23.780]
She's given me this impassioned defense of Connolly.

[02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:25.200]
If you like Connolly's her rise.

[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:25.860]
Great.

[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:27.200]
I have no respect for her.

[02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:29.760]
She can be one of the most educated bitches on the face of the earth.

[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:32.620]
But the fact of the matter is look at all the articles I've read about her.

[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:36.320]
The Chevron, the Chevron queen.

[02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:39.840]
The big oil queen just like all the other people in this administration.

[02:55:40.100 --> 02:55:41.940]
See, I hate to break the news dear Heather.

[02:55:42.300 --> 02:55:43.620]
But this is still the US of A.

[02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:46.080]
I realize that you and your ilk would like to eliminate all future elections.

[02:55:46.160 --> 02:55:47.660]
And just have a right wing kingdom.

[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:49.180]
None of us want to live in it.

[02:55:49.220 --> 02:55:50.680]
Most of us don't want to live in that kind of country.

[02:55:50.860 --> 02:55:50.960]
Okay.

[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:55.440]
And every time she must be a disciple of Vilus Spenano Riley.

[02:55:55.740 --> 02:55:56.660]
Don't confuse me with the facts.

[02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:59.140]
Because every time I orders a lot of people down here are upset about it.

[02:55:59.180 --> 02:55:59.820]
Well, name me one.

[02:55:59.940 --> 02:56:00.540]
Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:01.220]
Name me one.

[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:02.540]
But, but, but, but, but, name me one.

[02:56:02.860 --> 02:56:03.440]
Couldn't do it.

[02:56:04.180 --> 02:56:04.820]
She's filibustering.

[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:07.440]
And then before you know she hears the dial tone.

[02:56:07.860 --> 02:56:09.860]
I'm amazed they left her on that long to be honest with you.

[02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:13.380]
She's giving me a lecture on what I'm going to do on the new Roger show.

[02:56:13.660 --> 02:56:15.340]
And people in New York are upset about it.

[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:16.980]
How the hell the people in New York know about it.

[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:17.960]
We have people in New York.

[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.060]
Listen out of God damn website.

[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:20.500]
Have we ever had anybody complain about it?

[02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:20.800]
No.

[02:56:21.740 --> 02:56:21.920]
No.

[02:56:23.680 --> 02:56:24.000]
No.

[02:56:24.060 --> 02:56:24.320]
Not one.

[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:25.900]
Not one.

[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:29.520]
You see, I hate to break the news deal, but it's still legal.

[02:56:30.060 --> 02:56:34.900]
Not to like Condoleza or the president or even John Ascroft.

[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:38.800]
What a fox doing Heather.

[02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:40.920]
Oh!

[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:43.900]
What a fox.

[02:56:44.560 --> 02:56:44.760]
Oh!

[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:48.720]

[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:49.620]

[02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:49.620]

[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:52.280]

[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:52.280]

[02:56:54.060 --> 02:56:54.660]
Oh!

[02:57:03.740 --> 02:57:07.260]
What a fox.

[02:57:30.300 --> 02:57:32.360]
Ho-manquel' Taio

[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:32.700]
and

[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:38.200]
and

[02:57:38.200 --> 02:57:44.360]
and

[02:57:44.360 --> 02:58:04.700]
No i'm a nice bandant

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:04.700 --> 02:58:04.700]

[02:58:11.800 --> 02:58:12.860]
Buuuut

[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:13.680]

[02:58:32.780 --> 02:58:36.400]
So about the only info we ever got on those explosions and bagged out of ones today is

[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:39.500]
that four people got injured so it says the Pentagon and so far it no-mossed.

[02:58:39.760 --> 02:58:40.020]
I say.

[02:58:40.020 --> 02:58:43.500]
Cops hunt preacher man who married nine women and left the best of two.

[02:58:45.020 --> 02:58:46.760]
Another one then preacher man you know.

[02:58:46.960 --> 02:58:50.420]
Police in Gwinnick County, Georgia are searching for a self-proclaimed preacher.

[02:58:50.420 --> 02:58:54.320]
They say maybe at least nine women in Georgia Tennessee North Carolina, Alabama left

[02:58:54.320 --> 02:58:55.960]
him heartbroken in best of two.

[02:58:56.860 --> 02:59:00.000]
If there's anything worse than being a prostitute is being best of two.

[02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:04.520]
Anthony Glenn Owens 32 was supposed to surrender to Gwinnick police last week but hadn't

[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:06.580]
turned himself in as of seven o'clock last night.

[02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:08.160]
He was in Kanye's area.

[02:59:08.160 --> 02:59:10.840]
Kanye's you know who always has shown up in Kanye's Georgia.

[02:59:11.160 --> 02:59:12.280]
The Virgin Mary.

[02:59:12.380 --> 02:59:12.960]
Virgin Mary.

[02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:14.220]
Oh my God.

[02:59:15.260 --> 02:59:16.820]
You see how these things tie together.

[02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:17.800]
He's a man of the cloth.

[02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:21.260]
Maybe he's just stopping by to visit the Virgin Mary on the side of that bank building.

[02:59:22.080 --> 02:59:24.760]
He was in the Kanye's area last time we had contact with him.

[02:59:24.860 --> 02:59:28.180]
Police spokesman Captain, a corporal Dan Huggins said.

[02:59:28.680 --> 02:59:29.920]
They called him the preacher man.

[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:34.740]
He's a smooth talker said Maddie Nolan 37 who says she married Owens in 1999 in Alabama.

[02:59:35.220 --> 02:59:37.180]
He could approach you with a bunch of bananas you don't want.

[02:59:37.820 --> 02:59:40.140]
But after you talk to him you'll have bought those bananas.

[02:59:40.620 --> 02:59:41.920]
I guess you bought his banana.

[02:59:42.880 --> 02:59:46.660]
When I married him I had five cars in the house Nolan said when he got through with me I was dead bro.

[02:59:46.780 --> 02:59:49.400]
They broke known for wearing flashy suits.

[02:59:49.580 --> 02:59:55.560]
Owens would woo women with religious talk to women said but once married to him the women said they were taken for an unholy ride.

[02:59:57.380 --> 02:59:58.900]
That's what Linda lovely said too.

[02:59:59.040 --> 03:00:00.240]
And that's something like that.

[03:00:00.360 --> 03:00:02.120]
She was taken for an unholy ride.

[03:00:02.300 --> 03:00:03.460]
Something to do with the whole.

[03:00:04.240 --> 03:00:09.500]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T we got a few calls on there.

[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:18.940]
We don't want to like miss out on him you know what?

[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:23.220]
There's a lot of the calls much just to have the key to like the future of mankind.

[03:00:23.640 --> 03:00:24.400]
Here's Miami Lake.

[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:24.760]
Hello.

[03:00:25.160 --> 03:00:26.340]
I got the key.

[03:00:26.860 --> 03:00:27.640]
How are you Neil?

[03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:28.400]
OK.

[03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:32.520]
I like to tell you why I think the marines are looking for a new stadium.

[03:00:33.100 --> 03:00:38.420]
And it all has to do with in fact you were John a thing to September even you in a playoff night.

[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:42.780]
But the real reason is they're going to build this 40s coast tracks and that's done.

[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:45.480]
They'll now mean it's they got the money and study.

[03:00:46.020 --> 03:00:47.300]
So I'm from downtown Miami.

[03:00:47.520 --> 03:00:49.080]
All we have to downtown Palm Beach.

[03:00:49.660 --> 03:00:53.740]
So they want to put that thing somewhere on the railroad tracks connected with Metro rail.

[03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:56.800]
Then you got traffic real traffic and that's why.

[03:00:57.800 --> 03:00:59.960]
Because during the week it's a hard to put in out there.

[03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:06.520]
Oh that was great.

[03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:08.180]
I told you he's got the key.

[03:01:08.760 --> 03:01:09.560]
Here's Miami.

[03:01:09.600 --> 03:01:09.900]
Hello.

[03:01:10.460 --> 03:01:10.860]
Hello.

[03:01:11.320 --> 03:01:11.760]
Yes sir.

[03:01:16.480 --> 03:01:18.300]
Here's a call from North Miami.

[03:01:18.500 --> 03:01:18.680]
Hello.

[03:01:19.220 --> 03:01:19.540]
Yeah man.

[03:01:19.700 --> 03:01:20.220]
That's Beach.

[03:01:20.220 --> 03:01:21.320]
Hell at a hall at.

[03:01:22.180 --> 03:01:23.320]
Hall asked bitch.

[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:27.180]
Here's a call from a river or a beach.

[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:28.100]
Hello.

[03:01:29.620 --> 03:01:30.700]
Yes sir.

[03:01:30.700 --> 03:01:37.440]
It's the first time you just want to talk a little bit about the one Iraq and it's like the same problem we have is what we had before.

[03:01:37.760 --> 03:01:38.820]
Not enough truth.

[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:45.280]
I mean you had I think a general or ex general saying before the word that we need is about 300,000.

[03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:49.800]
Every one in there was what 1445,000 now we're down to 130,000.

[03:01:49.960 --> 03:01:52.360]
Okay now down to 130 and run straight up talking about okay.

[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:56.260]
Once we get the Iraqi stuff to strength and we'll back out with our slowly but surely.

[03:01:57.020 --> 03:01:59.380]
And now you have the guerrilla tactics going on.

[03:01:59.380 --> 03:02:02.440]
We're back and out already in a bunch of coffins is how we're back.

[03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:03.400]
Exactly.

[03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:12.060]
Now we have and now we have these guerrillas out tactics that they fear from the beginning and now we can't do anything to stop it.

[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:15.060]
It goes on and on and look what happened just two days ago.

[03:02:16.040 --> 03:02:22.520]
GH 47 shot down 15 dead and then you got these colors calling in saying, oh you know somebody on this stupid stuff.

[03:02:22.740 --> 03:02:25.820]
I mean I know you have a lot of comedy on your show, but it's a time in the place for everything.

[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:26.140]

[03:02:26.140 --> 03:02:27.120]
No, no, sir.

[03:02:27.260 --> 03:02:28.100]
Let me say this to you.

[03:02:28.380 --> 03:02:33.080]
The mental defectives that you're referring to would make any difference that they were dropping nuclear weapons on Miramar.

[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:35.940]
The people you're talking about would still be calling to the same crap.

[03:02:36.040 --> 03:02:36.640]
That's all they know.

[03:02:36.800 --> 03:02:39.000]
They don't have the capacity for anything beyond that.

[03:02:39.100 --> 03:02:41.040]
That's why we're going to pickle that we're in.

[03:02:41.660 --> 03:02:45.480]
I'll tell you if I get a chance, maybe I'll just move to another state because this is crazy.

[03:02:45.480 --> 03:02:46.420]
Now you just have.

[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:48.720]
Idiot. That's all I have to say.

[03:02:48.820 --> 03:02:49.260]
You'll have a good.

[03:02:49.260 --> 03:02:49.440]
Okay.

[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:50.200]
Now good luck to us.

[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:50.640]
Thank you.

[03:02:51.120 --> 03:02:57.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 we want some more intellectual calls before two o'clock rules are on the mad dog comes in.

[03:02:57.560 --> 03:02:57.920]
What?

[03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:01.380]
Well, when you last, oh, nothing about man, pull myself a joke.

[03:03:01.660 --> 03:03:06.060]
We want a lot of intellectual calls heavy to a, hey, listen, this guy's made been the best call we had all day.

[03:03:06.080 --> 03:03:07.280]
This last guy released a lot of many.

[03:03:07.400 --> 03:03:08.200]
No question about that.

[03:03:08.260 --> 03:03:09.500]
How many good calls we have about four?

[03:03:10.220 --> 03:03:12.240]
We've taken about 200 and we've had about four.

[03:03:12.260 --> 03:03:13.320]
They actually made any sense.

[03:03:13.680 --> 03:03:15.320]
And most of them were like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[03:03:15.500 --> 03:03:17.840]
But I do like that East Coast Railroad made it hop on it.

[03:03:20.640 --> 03:03:24.880]
This is 4 portfolio 5, 6, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5

[03:03:27.200 --> 03:03:30.560]
Deal got out of WQPR

[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:32.980]
Where is the fact?

[03:03:33.580 --> 03:03:37.580]
Where is the fact?

[03:03:37.580 --> 03:03:37.720]
All right.

[03:03:38.040 --> 03:03:45.060]
All right

[03:03:51.420 --> 03:03:53.760]
She looks like a guy

[03:03:55.180 --> 03:03:57.300]
She's seven feet wide

[03:03:58.460 --> 03:04:01.720]
She makes me want to describe

[03:04:05.520 --> 03:04:07.500]
A chick with a dick

[03:04:08.060 --> 03:04:11.620]
With two smelly chins

[03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:16.020]
A bloated and ugly fat dick

[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:22.580]
She wants the media to stop the music

[03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:26.460]
And ripping her and ask with songs like this

[03:04:26.460 --> 03:04:29.700]
But we find that a music

[03:04:29.700 --> 03:04:33.480]
From that self-promoting ugly dick

[03:04:35.140 --> 03:04:37.240]
How much were you paid?

[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:38.980]
How much were you paid?

[03:04:38.980 --> 03:04:40.720]
For Monica's Day

[03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:45.660]
My rich church seemed that in the scheme

[03:04:45.660 --> 03:04:48.200]
From what women women women

[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:49.700]
The trips of fancy

[03:04:50.940 --> 03:04:52.980]
I wish you all would read these love

[03:04:54.340 --> 03:04:58.080]
I'm just like everyone who's a few out there

[03:04:58.080 --> 03:05:00.800]
I think you'll be taken in it

[03:05:00.800 --> 03:05:02.200]
Maybe about the poverty

[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:05.840]
Just crew to you think you're a fool

[03:05:06.920 --> 03:05:09.460]
You've had a conscious ugly smelly dick

[03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:14.240]
You're really that drugshin of drifts

[03:05:14.240 --> 03:05:16.460]
I know it

[03:05:20.180 --> 03:05:23.240]
But she's got about 600 grand more than she had a few days ago

[03:05:23.240 --> 03:05:25.360]
Which of these are you least interested in?

[03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:27.940]
Ben and JLo 208, nobody cares about them

[03:05:27.940 --> 03:05:29.400]
Go away already

[03:05:29.400 --> 03:05:31.480]
All of the above 157

[03:05:31.480 --> 03:05:33.900]
Now it's interesting all of the above they voted

[03:05:33.900 --> 03:05:34.780]
And then we added

[03:05:36.580 --> 03:05:38.140]
Kobe Bryant rape case

[03:05:38.140 --> 03:05:39.460]
About 30

[03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:41.780]
Marlon's new stadium 29

[03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:42.860]
Elizabeth's Mark 29

[03:05:42.860 --> 03:05:44.280]
Scott Lacey Peterson 19

[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:45.340]
They like it

[03:05:45.900 --> 03:05:47.240]
WTO meeting in Miami 12

[03:05:47.900 --> 03:05:49.500]
Sports 10, Terry Shivo 2

[03:05:49.500 --> 03:05:50.580]
And the Warner Rack so far

[03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:52.880]
Nobody's had the balls to put anything on there about that

[03:05:52.880 --> 03:05:54.820]
Because we'll trace the world won't we?

[03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:55.500]

[03:05:55.500 --> 03:05:57.580]
We'll track him down and we'll come and get him

[03:05:57.580 --> 03:05:58.960]
Mad Dog's coming up next

[03:05:58.960 --> 03:06:00.040]
Bye bye bye

[03:06:00.040 --> 03:06:06.300]
I'm gonna get Ricky a blow

[03:06:06.300 --> 03:06:07.020]
I would do that
