[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.500]
Aaaaaaaming!

[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.320]
Coming soon to a theater near you!

[00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.280]
Christopher Reeve is Superman! Superman 5!

[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.800]
Hell, tell Superman, Superman Quig! Jimmy Olsen is drowning!

[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.120]
Hey, here comes Superman! Here he comes! He's in a wheelchair!

[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.980]
Hurry up Superman!

[00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.700]
Okay, where's Jimmy?

[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.380]
Too late!

[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.760]
Yeah, now to call you Super Gimp!

[00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.220]
Get out of here you freak!

[00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.800]
Oh, oh Clark!

[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.940]
Oh, nothing's happening! Get on top of me!

[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.660]
Arthur!

[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.520]
Ow!

[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.980]
I, the evil dog, have finally figured out a way to defeat Superman!

[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.680]
With, with, with Kryptonite?

[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.920]
No, steps!

[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.660]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.420]
Superman 5! The search for a bigger doorway, rolling into a theater near you!

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.080]
Poor Superman man, last night, Clark Kent was...

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.240]
Faaaaaaming!

[00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.920]
Ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.980]
Oh, that big Simmons boy, some of you people must be really desperate!

[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.720]
Oh, Neil! All that breathless cause we were getting down!

[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.280]
He was going to see Tom Walling naked tonight on the small field, yeah.

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.760]
Right.

[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.820]
Came out of that blast furnace flaming.

[00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.780]
And then, uh, yeah, little, uh, what did we see, huh?

[00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.660]
Maybe a little...

[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.040]
Back home!

[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.240]
Side of the butt cheek.

[00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.120]
Only the most desperate of the desperate were sitting there like with their nose glued to the screen.

[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.180]
Probably still can't get it off, and the nose either.

[00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.880]
Tony right now, hey, the mole this morning was all whipped up to a frenzy him and Gildi.

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.860]
I guess there must be nothing going on in sports.

[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.920]
Certainly nothing that they would want to talk about.

[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.560]
So they're talking about the athletes fraternizing.

[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.100]
Now, who's the one that pitched the no-hitter?

[00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.100]
Cause I didn't see about that.

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.820]
Was it, um, I don't know who was.

[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.680]
Was it Tom Glavin?

[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.160]
It must have been somebody else that's...

[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.980]
Yeah, Glavin.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.220]
So I guess he got calls from Greg Maddix and John Smoltz, his former teammates,

[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:22.500]
congratulating him with that.

[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.000]
He absolutely nothing wrong with that.

[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.880]
At all.

[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.300]
I mean, when you watch an NFL game, and the thing that really gets me is,

[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.940]
here's the voice of the dolphins and his little ass-sucking buddy there.

[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.420]
And they're the NFL.

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.860]
The real, I mean, that's the bread and butter of this radio station.

[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.120]
Let's face it as far as sports.

[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.960]
Beside this show.

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.840]
And after every single game in the NFL, every one of them, the game is over.

[00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.420]
The referee blows off his thing, and that's it.

[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.720]
And at midfield, as the two teams are crossing the field,

[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.840]
they go to locker rooms and shower with each other with their own teammates anyway.

[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.140]
You see dozens of guys, well, maybe not dozens, but a whole bunch of guys from the opposing teams,

[00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.040]
who are good friends.

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.580]
Maybe they went to college together, maybe they took showers together.

[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.600]
Who knows what the story is, and they fraternize.

[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.900]
And they go over to each other's house for dinner,

[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.560]
like someone leaves one to Kujo's house before that game in Detroit,

[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.100]
and there was a big simmiss about that.

[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.860]
That's life.

[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.120]
This isn't war.

[00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.900]
Like Alexander McKilney would say,

[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.760]
this isn't war we're talking about.

[00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.040]
It's a game, you idiots.

[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.120]
You morons.

[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.440]
It's a freaking game.

[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.300]
Oh, that's wrong.

[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.380]
He should be in Geldys all indignant and pissed off and fired up.

[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.140]
And of course, the same thing could be said of WQAM about sports stations,

[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.540]
about radio stations in general,

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.880]
since I'm finding out some real, real interesting information this morning.

[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.420]
A little bird told me, and in fact, it was like pecking on a window this morning.

[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.860]
It was like a little pecking on my window.

[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.820]
Yeah, a little bird told me.

[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.740]
And he said, can you believe that John Weiner,

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.800]
who used to be one of the sports nerds at QAM,

[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.100]
who's a pretty decent guy got a horrible voice,

[00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.400]
and doesn't belong on here just to say, hello, how you doing?

[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.000]
But anyway, he's over there doing morons on Fox Make Believe Sports Radio,

[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.520]
which has got like fractional numbers.

[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.640]
I mean, you could put their audience in a phone booth.

[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.380]
You could put their audience in that deli, I ate it last Saturday,

[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.380]
and have room left over.

[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.120]
That's how small it is.

[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.740]
And so we don't wish him any ill, John Weiner,

[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.420]
and if I was Mo, I'd be pretty porked off to find out,

[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.060]
come to find out that there are people inside our building.

[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.460]
I don't want to mention that one of them is our program director,

[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.200]
who is a former roommate of John, whatever name is Weiner.

[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.940]
A former Weiner lover.

[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.520]
And that these people are feeding him information.

[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.580]
If he needs a phone number, if he wants to get some athlete,

[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.260]
or some agent on the phone, or some hot shot in sports,

[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.060]
all he's got to do is call over to QAM,

[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.500]
and we're like feeding them all the information.

[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.900]
And this is the guy who's competing with us.

[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.240]
So Mo, if you're going to be upset about something,

[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.100]
I'd be a lot less concerned about these athletes,

[00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.680]
and a lot more concerned about what's happening right in your own backyard,

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.020]
right in your own backdoor.

[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.580]
That's what I'd be concerned about.

[00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.120]
There's probably like some infiltration into his smelly old bag,

[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.100]
wouldn't surprise me.

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.900]
Probably John Weiner knows the flavor.

[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.980]
He knows which piece Mo, or to work this morning.

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.700]
He's got all this info, because he's got his inside spies,

[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.460]
including his former roommate, Clarence aka Dero,

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.640]
what Josh, whatever name is.

[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.760]
The program director, that's disgraceful.

[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.980]
I mean, I've had friends when Bill Carter was working at IOD,

[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.540]
I was working at WINZ, whatever, on different stations.

[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.860]
Still were best of friends, we'd go to the track together.

[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.800]
We'd bitch about management, and how they all suck stuff like that.

[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.480]
That's allowed.

[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.140]
As long as nobody hears it.

[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.840]
But other than that, we certainly were like trying to feed each other materials,

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.540]
so we can put it on the ear, then I stay and like,

[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.460]
help each other show.

[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.140]
There's still like competitiveness.

[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.080]
But the idea that we have people inside the QA and building there,

[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.280]
in fact, Greg was walking around a couple of years ago,

[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.860]
wondering who's the mole, who's the mole.

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.640]
You got more than moles in there, man.

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.560]
You got like, uh, skabies.

[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.480]
Right?

[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.760]
I mean, I got a little mole over that one eyebrow there that you're always screaming about.

[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.780]
You know something, that's me.

[00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.060]
I went to the dermatologist and he said,

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.720]
forget about it.

[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.060]
He said, leave a worse mark than they already got there.

[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.560]
You look even worse if that's possible.

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.980]
Well, I don't want to do that.

[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.000]
I'm already looking pretty crappy.

[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.080]
I don't want to look any worse.

[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.680]
Not just David and going with life.

[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.180]
Right.

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.880]
So it's, I got a mole, but I mean, just a little thing.

[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.120]
But a skabies, that's nasty.

[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.000]
Yeah.

[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.080]
You can smell them, man.

[00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.760]
They're all over the place.

[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:25.680]
That's where we got a QM.

[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.120]
Not just the mole, we got skabies.

[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.820]
At least.

[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.060]
Working on conjunction with the competition, huh?

[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.520]
Chiggers are worse.

[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.620]
I'll start with that crap again.

[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.040]
But please.

[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.800]
Now look at this.

[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.320]
Why did you fix me this?

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.460]
Why don't you stop?

[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.820]
And Mary Poppins' chimney.

[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.380]
We're going to send, not Santa Claus.

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.040]
We're going to send a mole down your chimney.

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.880]
We're going to have him stick his bag down your chimney.

[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.220]
If you don't cut the crap, whoever fax this nonsense.

[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.980]
Idea for a poll.

[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.060]
Look at the way they spelled poll.

[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.680]
Who is the biggest pervert?

[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.220]
Bill Clinton.

[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.120]
Oude who's saying, Hank Goldberg or George Rodriguez.

[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.780]
Now, who did Oude have pictures of?

[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.820]
The twin booklet.

[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:03.020]
Oh, the Clinton sisters.

[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:03.660]
That's right.

[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.660]
I mean, the booklet sisters.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.260]
Sorry, excuse me.

[00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.280]
The booklet sisters.

[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.880]
Yeah, that's the true story.

[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.780]
We had it's one of our stories that we have on the website.

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.280]
Is it not?

[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.360]
Yeah.

[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.680]
I believe we have it.

[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.460]
Oude.

[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.780]
Oude said, holy tamales.

[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.140]
Look at those.

[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.060]
That's what he said.

[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.680]
You know, there's the raki's that begin tamales.

[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.880]
In fact, that's probably going to be the first fast food joint.

[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.580]
Not too late.

[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.320]
They already opened the right.

[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.700]
What was it?

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:27.080]
Pizza Hut.

[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.620]
What was the other one?

[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:29.100]
McDonald's.

[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.040]
Whatever.

[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:32.040]
They'll die.

[00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.340]
If we didn't get them with the gunfire, the bombs were certainly going to get them with the fast food.

[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.260]
The slow and more painful and torturous way.

[00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.900]
Terrain their kishkis out.

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.480]
Terrain their guts out with that American fast food.

[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.340]
And lots and lots of sodas with heavy duty sugar.

[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.720]
So that's all yesterday.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.200]
Now, I do realize that there was some tinkering going on here.

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.260]
There was some grand tinkering going on with the poll overnight.

[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.940]
Because when I went to bed last night, Kathy Bates for a performance.

[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:57.840]
I'll hear you the question.

[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.940]
What was the best all-time performance in a movie by an actress?

[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.800]
Kathy Bates was a couple votes ahead.

[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.760]
I get up this morning and Halle Berry and Monsters Ball is a bunch of votes ahead.

[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.780]
I would say 37 to be more exact.

[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.300]
And I realized that there was Diddlin going on, but you know something I don't care.

[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:15.880]
Because I don't mind Halle Berry winning.

[00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:16.820]
Do you?

[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:17.540]
No, not at all.

[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.760]
This kind of he likes Halle Berry.

[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.660]
That's fine.

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.000]
This crowd, this audience.

[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:25.740]
Whenever we take the whose hot polls and everything she always does really well with not winning.

[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:31.920]
The poll question was what was the best all-time performance in a movie by an actress?

[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:32.800]
Not whose hot.

[00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.220]
I know.

[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.800]
But I'm just saying.

[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.420]
Not whose bones would be like to hop on.

[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.100]
But you know how they are.

[00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.180]
They vote for who they like.

[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.380]
Halle Berry Monsters Ball 157.

[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.000]
Well, I don't imagine too many are anxious to hop on Kathy Bates.

[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.200]
But knowing our crowd is probably a few.

[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.020]
It'd be a soft landing.

[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:47.180]
Kathy Bates and Misery 120.

[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.760]
Now we've said, let's see that one.

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.340]
That one point.

[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:51.960]
You know something?

[00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.660]
That.

[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.020]
He really looked old in that movie.

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.480]
You know what?

[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:56.300]
James Cullin.

[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.040]
You're being your blood.

[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.660]
It brings all over your nice, I believe suit.

[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.160]
No, seriously.

[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.160]
I'm just thinking what year was Misery?

[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.860]
Because the Godfather, the Godfather one was 72 or three.

[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:05.840]
72, I believe.

[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:06.380]
Huh?

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:08.740]
Misery had to be like late 80s, early 90s.

[00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.560]
Carlos is looking it up.

[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.620]
No, I'll look it up.

[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.980]
Just relax, Boi.

[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.220]
Don't do it too much work.

[00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.280]
I've got my big fat one here, my book.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.860]
And by the way, quick call of people fat.

[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.260]
Zack.

[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.820]
It's one thing if I call people fat because I'm a fat slob.

[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.580]
But you make me look like Minnie Mouse.

[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.060]
1990.

[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.040]
Misery.

[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.100]
Directed by Rob Reiner.

[00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:28.660]
Meathead.

[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.140]
Did you know that?

[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.040]
I do know.

[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:31.980]
There you go.

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.820]
See, it's not even 915 yet.

[00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:35.920]
We're learning crap on the world famous Nearage show.

[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:36.580]
How do you like that?

[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.760]
It is Wednesday, by the way.

[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.000]
And you probably forgot about that.

[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:41.220]
No, I didn't actually.

[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.440]
Oh, so a big new one.

[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.220]
Really comedy guitar.

[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:43.940]
Wednesday.

[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.760]
This is what helps to keep this show going.

[00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:50.960]
The only thing that keeps me alive is the fact we get that little bump in the middle of the week that, you know,

[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:57.300]
the bump that gets you over the hump and leaves the lump and makes you take a big dump.

[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.060]
Right.

[00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.760]
Honest dump.

[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.660]
James Conn, Kathy Bates, Richard Farnsworth, Francis Sternhagen, Lauren McCall.

[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.140]
Lauren McCall was in misery.

[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.460]
Boy, I forgot.

[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.860]
What role did she play?

[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.360]
I'm going to have to get that again.

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.160]
I'm going to go out and get that today along with Fargo.

[00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:15.700]
And Paye or something.

[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.180]
There's a movie called Pierre South Dakota.

[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:18.080]
There is?

[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:18.600]
No.

[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.660]
Edward.

[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:21.120]
Who?

[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:21.680]
Edward.

[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.860]
And I'm getting Edward also.

[00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:26.180]

[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.140]

Kathleen Turner and Body Heat 48, Vivian Lee, Gone with the N47.

[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.440]
Yeah, and I told you this wouldn't get as many votes as much response as the other one, and it didn't.

[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.720]
It's just that sexist thing again.

[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:48.360]
Right.

[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:53.040]

Betty Davis, whatever happened to baby Jane 35.

[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.340]
You poo-pooed that one I told you to good.

[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:02.760]
Did you poo-poo it?

[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.020]
No.

[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.280]

Nurse Ranchit.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.520]
I want my cigarettes, Nurse Ranchit.

[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:15.640]
I love Chiswick, man.

[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:16.260]
He was great.

[00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:17.380]
I love Chiswick.

[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.820]
And then of course Danny DeVito.

[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.820]
It's the first time I think we ever seen Danny DeVito.

[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.260]
At least the night that got...

[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:23.320]
Huh?

[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:23.980]

[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.480]
Mr. Martini.

[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.140]
Martini Ja.

[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.660]
It came up to where Nickap, who was great.

The poor Billy-Babdel-Bab-babbabibbit.

[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.720]
And then the key, everybody in that movie was great.

[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.540]
The Chief, he was a Hoot, the Indian.

[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:38.740]
Right.

[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.480]
And of course Jack Nicholson had missed the poll from yesterday.

[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.320]
Jack Nicholson won for Cookus Nest as best male performance in a movie.

[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.780]
He won the Estitute.

[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:12.460]
addition wasn't well, of course they all went up at the same time. But I mean,

[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.640]
that was like an afterthought. You ate the only. Yeah. She was great. Especially

[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.640]
the scene in the beginning where they're burying the fat cousin. Yeah. And she's

[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:25.140]

[00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:29.920]
look like Zach. Oh, you're screaming. You said I'm a bitch. You remember that? That was great.

[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:40.620]
We told you don't eat. Don't eat. He always said something good on him, you know. He always had food on him. Oh,

[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.080]
God. What a great movie. But only us fat people really appreciate it. Right, Zach? You tub a crap.

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:50.060]
Quit picking on Josh Friedman. I'll understand Josh is bigger than an apartment complex. In fact, he may get a

[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.100]
complex about it. Let's pick on him a lot just for the hell of it because you hate him like poison.

[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.600]
See, you notice the silence? Yeah. Well, we know you do. You hate him like boy. I don't know what it is.

[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:06.900]
Yeah, you do so. You hate him. Well, yeah, you despise him. Here's a prick. Now that you mentioned it. Yeah.

Q and.

[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.400]
Don't get the honey tuner. I got an amand honey.

[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.120]
This is Bob and the knob of huge electronics where everything is stock is huge.

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:41.640]
Staryotes computers big screen TVs. If you plug it in, we've got it and it's huge.

[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.680]
We have just a wide selection of big screen TV. So come on down and take a look.

[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.240]
I am the queen of big screen TV. Just look for the huge picture tube in the sky.

[00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:00.040]
Just off highway 5. That's Bob on the knob. Huge appliances. I am the queen.

[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.140]
It's 9 18 at 5 60. If you heard me talking on the air, that means her inner

[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.460]
commas still beating on the air and I really don't care because it was very emotional moment.

[00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.640]
Did it go on the air? No. It didn't? No. How do you know?

[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.440]
Didn't hear it in here? But that is me. I think it bleeds through on the air.

[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.760]
This inner comm thing. But I don't like I said okay because our engineer Julio who's a great guy

[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.300]
and the lost 25 pounds thanks to me embarrassing him because he's I would like to see him live

[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.260]
along. He got screwed over by Bob DeMuth on our engineering mafia at QAM.

[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.700]
Not too many days ago. I mentioned that somebody had sent me some memos,

[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.260]
some that were posted and hiring three different positions in engineering and I said to George,

[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.680]
I said I don't think they're going to be hiring three new engineers.

[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:49.320]
And come to find out this was just a formality to enable them to lower everybody's salary,

[00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:54.380]
including lowering Julio's at a much much reduced rate and of course is the way of squeezing them out.

[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.060]
Rather than going to him and saying hey guess what we do the times are tough we can't afford to pay

[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.200]
you're eating too much or anything like that you know that would have been too honest.

[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:07.240]
So instead they blow them out. So I wish him an investor luck because he's a great guy.

[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.380]
He was up here and really did a lot of work finishing touches putting this studio together

[00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.300]
while Bob Ramuth ran around in circles as usual.

[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.640]
Bob Ramuth I just want to tell you man this is one more nail in your coffin.

[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.740]
In fact this really inspires me to go on here until a full story about how you call the

[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.660]
Beasley's a bunch of mugwomps that night in Amsterdam at that Indonesian dinner.

[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:31.000]
He said that the kid in the tree in deliverance he said he wouldn't even let them in there.

[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.340]
Now that's what he said he said that if the Beasley's would have climbed in the tree he'd have hopped

[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:37.540]
out because they would have ruined the neighborhood. That's what he said about them.

[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:44.440]
I haven't even told you what he said about Scoran and yeah but I'll get to it because you're

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.460]
really small potatoes vermoth you're real idiot and of course look at that great job he did putting

[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:53.520]
that stuff in Amsterdam. Oh my god there's a story there's a story.

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:57.400]
Of course they only had what six months advanced notice to get that thing in there.

[00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.240]
Yeah that's why it goes vermoth.

[00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:04.000]
And he finally just threw up his arms in here and left and left it all the poor mark that mark

[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.600]
in the dark that that's guy who's running around in circles trying to find the red light

[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.820]
district. Anyway let me go well before we do that because I want to finish up the results

[00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:17.920]
from the pool. Don't look either the new one. Lots of stuff baby lots of stuff to squeeze in only

[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:22.600]
three hours too that's the problem. We boxed it oh look at that look at that I'm pitched

[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:26.060]
about engineering and now my phone lines went down I don't think that's a coincidence I think

[00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:31.080]
somebody's passing you around back there you see that no dots. I don't we that ours but we have

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.760]
a little a little burp here a couple seconds ago. I think it was really a lightning strike.

[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.700]
Let me see what's going on here I think it's sabotage myself. Let me redo this thing.

[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.380]
I'll see.

[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.280]
Associate producer okay my thing is back on here do I see any dots. Oh yeah there they go.

[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.300]
Oh I told you well I'm a pro at this now I have to do my own engineering here.

[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.800]
Sure it's all couldn't call George Corso or Bob Vermoth because between the two of them

[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.860]
that's what you get. So nice going squeezing out the only guy that we had that we didn't know

[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:06.600]
what that he was doing as Julio. They're really cute he used to stick his big fat head in the door

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:11.520]
every morning 845 everything okay in here guys you need anything. That's probably why they

[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.480]
didn't like him too because he was actually helping us to try to get our technical act together

[00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.920]
which they don't like since this show is reviled and hated even though I'll give you those

[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:28.900]
hour by hours in a minute here again. Why not? Huh the four highest hours by far I'm WQM in a

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.260]
winter book are between nine and one by far I just mentioned that in passing again Greg I just

[00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:40.040]
mentioned that in passing okay and you two Mo you ought to be real you ought to be in fact Mo should

[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:43.800]
turn around on his way to Volkow he should turn right down around a minute where he is right now

[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.800]
and go right back and and pitch a fit with clearance. Sure was peace Adam for goodness no seriously

[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:55.580]
for concerning with the enemy for John Weiner I'd be I'd be full minute them out. I mean at least

[00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.520]
the shows they got in midday I don't think Roemi is calling up to get you know information about

[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.340]
sports numbers from clearance or anybody else at QM but to think that they got this punk who doesn't

[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.380]
belong on here just to say hello John Weiner they're in a morning on Fox Sports on Schlock Sports

[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.680]
which is Chief Channel by the way and we got people sleeping with the enemy didn't you say they were

[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:21.860]
roommates huh or do you say womb mates oh oh consorting with the enemy man Julia Roberts is pretty

[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.540]

people said it was the pits how about Brad he have any spots yeah let's do that one for the male

[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:49.580]
actors again see if Brad can get about seven what are you saying what's in the box seriously I'll

[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.360]
watch that in term movie just to see that see me I have done it I mean Morgan Freeman was

[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.880]
great in that movie but he's a sensation actor he's perfect but Brad Pitt I mean Brad is like

[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:04.700]
I'm trying to think of a movie that he was really good in California I didn't see that California

[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:10.180]
with a K if you hadn't told me that it was him I never would have guessed oh maybe that's why

[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.920]
was good because he really stopped I think about when he was in that fight club which was just a

[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:20.060]
stupid pointless violent gratuitous a piece of crap got to think it was and uh what else was he

[00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:24.140]
he was in that movie the river what the oh no he wasn't a good movie where he played the brother

[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:29.900]
the two fishermen the Montana movie yeah that was a good movie a river with Craig Sheffer

[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:34.320]
but that was when Craig Sheffer had like look black and blue eyes for your cyking again I just

[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:38.240]
watched that again over the like the weekend did you really get that was a very sad movie though

[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:43.840]
yeah it was I did Brad have to be the one who died 927 at 560 don't see there you go again with that

[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:49.280]
factory meal right you ran yeah that's right that's me that's me mr. Faggot I'm proud of it and we

[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:55.140]
saw Tom Walling's back home last night he was flaming I wonder if Moe watched that show he's

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:00.580]
probably a closet small villal fan you know no it's probably got a thing for Lana I got to think

[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:07.520]
for Lana so yeah yeah she's all right right here she said first you know what she said you call

[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.500]
that a penis let me tell you right now are you fat people out there you want to lose weight balance

[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.520]
for life is a great way to do it because it's delicious and it keeps you full all day a lot of

[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.880]
those programs out there you have to start to death or you have to eat a bunch of pre-fabricated

[00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.560]
crap that tastes like garbage it comes in small little containers that couldn't keep a bird full

[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.420]
well if balance for life they bring you plenty of food each day for your thing three gourmet

at your home at your work at the pub that you're hanging out under the overpass wherever you live

[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.300]
those checkered pants

[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:44.080]
my wife took their card at a wall she drives my viewer again she's three feet tall

[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:57.200]
I wouldn't ride with her no way I said I'd need it there later today so I'm just sitting on a bench in the

[00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:02.620]
way waiting for the libra's to take me away

[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:09.400]
or just sitting on a bench in the way with my friend's time

[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:21.660]
I'm trying to tell my James because the bus fans don't always say the same

[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.500]
all that gonna do with Jetta tells me to do

[00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:33.980]
the private her life she must be in jail just sitting here resting my bones

[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:42.300]
wondering why my wife won't leave me alone we've talked it over and I never win

[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:51.480]
I just wind up schlepping through the mall again oh so I sit on a bench in the rain

[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.420]
waiting for the lollipess to take me away

[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:24.440]
I'm 33 at 560 W. I'm ever to checkered pants are part of the official uniform in Del Rey and Boko

[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:29.060]
And you think you think you think that's probably the only reason Moe wears those he realizes how silly he looks

[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.300]
But you know when you live in Boko you're supposed to wear either lime green or checkered pants

[00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.000]
And what's the other one lemon yellow canary ale? Oh?

[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:44.260]
Yeah, with the blue shoes. That's really oh man a nice mustard yellow to talk about a fashion plate

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.100]
Anyway, speaking of that the hour by our numbers came in from the order rating book

[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.440]
And I just thought we'd mentioned against we can pet ourselves on a back

[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:52.860]
And I missed I don't get to hear that much of Moe show

[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:59.940]
So he may have actually been on your thanking me this morning for helping goose up his six to ten morning drive

[00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:05.340]
Slab which is why they moved this show from ten to two which where it belongs back to nine to one to try to goose up a desperate morning show

[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.400]
And we did it we goose them up by six tenths at a point

[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.560]
He would have had a 4.1 and men instead he had a 4.7 six to ten

[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:16.260]
Because his three hours two of them were horrendous and mom was very good

[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.680]
I don't understand that so I guess what it means is they can only take him in small doses

[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:25.940]
Well seriously because five to six the duty boys had a 3.7 share in men and then six o'clock

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.760]
Moe comes on and goes from a 3.7 down to a 3.3

[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.140]
He drops almost half a point when they hear his voice

[00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.440]
Then seven o'clock all of a sudden in that hour they go up to a 5.4

[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.260]
I that which is a stellar hour nice going air moe

[00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.080]
Yeah eight o'clock then they drop back down to a 3.4

[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.120]
A 3.4 for Moe

[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.300]
Nine o'clock we come on with a 6.4 which is like his six o'clock and eight o'clock hours put together

[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.320]
Almost see they got a 6.7 of those two hours put together

[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.980]
We got a 6.4 just in the nine o'clock hour at 10 o'clock

[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:02.000]
We go to a 9.5 11 o'clock at 9.2 and at noon a 7.3

[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.980]
I'm sure we get a little bit of a little damage from the

[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.880]
Lord asked my store noon hour from lord I

[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.260]
Well, I'm confident we probably still beat him

[00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:14.420]
But I sure be interested in seeing those hour by hours for IOD and big and semi-autostations

[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:20.120]
Friday Friday, Friday, Friday I was just told the

[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.760]
Sada today here who told you that?

[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:22.040]
Stuff

[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.920]
What are you talking about? He Bell will have him by noon, okay?

[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.800]
Don't give me this Friday stuff that's muffled you see he's too busy consort with clearance who's on the full with John Wiener right now

[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.700]
Oh, they're on to us. They're on to us, you know who you kid and clearance what a disgrace, you know

[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.920]
And let's see the days only the it's the 30 it's we've got many days away from payday

[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.100]
So I don't have to worry about pissing clearance off too close to payday

[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.840]
But seriously that that's bad when your program director is

[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:54.480]
Bunk but buddies with the guy to see what a morning show on another station and feeding him all kinds of information and

[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.580]
Phone numbers and contacts and trying to goose up his show if I'm low

[00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.460]
I'm on a way back to the station right now

[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.900]
Well, that would be like a host of one show being a guest on

[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.880]
Competitors when you leave him alone. I see you're picking on that silly old man

[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.740]
I'm just talking about how he thanked me profusely, didn't he?

[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.000]
Did I miss that beer boy or we all missed it? Oh, we all miss it too

[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.240]
That's okay, Mo that's what you get because payback is a bitch

[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.460]
Isn't that what somebody once said payback is a bitch? No one we got a 7.3

[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:27.940]
We got four stellar hours on there which we thank the audience profusely and I patent myself on a back

[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:28.840]
Yes, why not?

[00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:34.780]
Nobody else are doing I mean clearance. I mean not clear in fact clearance that he come in here and say nice job

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:40.160]
No, no ducted it about 20 times, but he's kind of a suck. No anyway, you know, it's dead when the numbers came out

[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.380]
He did not did so to me. Oh

[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.640]
Not to you to me never came in during the show and said great job guys great job, Neil

[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.700]
You're keeping your you're keeping us alive. You fat fat. He never said that

[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.360]
Well, that's what he's thinking

[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.460]
One o'clock we're going on to a five point what happened to the mad dog?

[00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:01.560]
I mean it took good hours, but not his usual stellar hours and I'm thinking that January, February, March

[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:06.120]
Probably people with an IQ larger than their thumbnail had other things that are mind-based sports

[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:13.080]
What do you think? No, come on which probably is why I did so well and why we did so well because we were the only show on a radio station

[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.740]
Talking about what was really happening in the world whether you agree or like what we were saying or not

[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:17.780]
That's another story

[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.940]
But we were the only ones doing it as opposed to much of stupid sports stuff which let's face it January, February and March

[00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:26.740]
You got the panthers and a heat does anybody care about them did they go to the play on?

[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:29.720]
No, you need to one have a good season. There you go. I rest my case

[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.520]
Now of course that they draft this past last Saturday now

[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.280]
We got some heavy duty full ball. Give me the ball. Give me the ball

[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.640]
And I still say that's a disgrace this morning. I didn't hear anybody call it in challenge

[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:44.460]
Although I did hear a couple of guys that were pissed off about those comments and they were right about guys

[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.380]
Socializing from different teams and congratulations. What's wrong with that? What is wrong with that?

[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.520]
Huh, they're ought to be a lot

[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.200]
And I'll give you a classic example

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.140]
Every time like the major anniversary on it remember on this last March one

[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.960]
Ricky Tiki called in Rick Shaw

[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:07.040]
We've never ever I've in fact I've never officially met Rick Shaw used to see him with it often games like I told him

[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.940]
We'd wave at each other he'd be a few rows down below me. I never officially met him

[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:16.100]
You don't ever shook your eyes hand, but he was had classy enough to call me up and say great go and a

[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:21.020]
Congratulations, Neelan you do great radio. Whatever you said it was it left a it left a nut in my throat

[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.300]
Left a lump in here. It was either that or the moxable from that deli but this preceded that

[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:28.740]
Remember that mm-hmm

[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:35.220]
So what's not so much so we work on different stations that I mean we can't congratulate each other when we like Rick

[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:38.340]
Shaw had his 40th anniversary on here. Did I comment on that? Yep. Yes

[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.760]
It's not a war. It's not the end of the world

[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:47.140]
It's not WW4 like we're in right now coined to what James Woolsey wants to pull the wools over your eyes. No

[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.640]
Just a goddamn game

[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:54.620]
And I'm so sick and tired of these sports nerds especially the ones that work around us on Q and the ones that were

[00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.740]
Surrounded by who take all of his soul life and death so seriously, you know

[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:04.480]
It's like these numbers we got. Yeah, it's a look at the draw if your people get diaries yet and they like you you look out

[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:08.420]
Okay, we knock on wood. I'm not gonna not right now. We've done good 25 years running

[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.440]
How are we done so good? We must have a lot of trained monkeys out there mo, huh?

[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.340]
About a trained monkey's long before you came to town all this crap about well

[00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.060]
We talked about as me. What would he do? I don't know somehow for 26 long

[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:23.220]
Excruciating years I survived before I even knew who the hell you were except the course for that tape

[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:25.080]
Which I recommended him for the dolphin job

[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:31.040]
Which he'll never make any comment about that recommended him when Bob Green gave me an advice of tapes

[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.280]
You knew that? Mm-hmm

[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.620]
Well, he was doing Monday night football before Westwood once said by the way don't come back because you're a piece of crap

[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:43.140]
You know talent. Yes great voice. Yes as a human being and then this morning the other thing I heard which I'm sure

[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:44.140]
Beenerboy also heard

[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:48.140]
Was that self-aggrandizing thing? You know, it's one thing to raise money for charity

[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:52.860]
It's another thing to go on odd infant item and patch yourself all over the back about oh, you know

[00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:56.200]
You know what I'm talking about oh that was a break his arm. Oh my god

[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.900]
We're gonna have to bring a chiropractor in there. This guy's twisted like a pretzel now

[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:06.280]
Back to bring a whole staff of chiropractors to put him back together after patent himself with both arms and his leg and then

[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.100]
The other was patent him on a yes

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.740]
Kind of like the I guess that's a sports thing, you know, right?

[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.700]
But that was just one thing to raise it nice gone

[00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:17.500]
We appreciate that and then I guess he I didn't hear it

[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:19.600]
But he must have made a comment yesterday morning or Monday

[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.680]
Or one of the colors did about me and how he's raising so much money for charity what the erudgers ever done

[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.140]
You know, it speaks for itself. Yeah, and somebody did call him later in straight him out about Camille's house

[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.000]
I didn't mention center one of the other ones too

[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.420]
But we've raised plenty of money for charity on the show. I just don't feel like spending a lot of time

[00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:36.640]
Patting myself on the back

[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:41.800]
I'd rather pat myself on the back for the great book. We just had since so that's a little more important to us right now

[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:42.340]
Yeah

[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:48.120]
In addition to which you know the audience cares about the arbitrarian because we made it important to them over the years

[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.180]
We when we took that pool as we that's one of the things that they do on here about and we'd like to hear about the hour by hour

[00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:01.320]
The other stations too if Maddie Bell would get on that because duff says Friday. That's unacceptable. Okay. It's an unacceptable answer to that question

[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.140]
Duff I don't want to pick on you because then you're under a lot of stress Duff get off this instantly right get off your ass and give it

[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:08.880]
It's fucking great. Yeah

[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.200]
Man just give him like a little tiny job, but he still can't handle it. That's what Karen's told me

[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:20.720]
That's why I could well never right nine forty one

[00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:27.020]
Now let me ask you speaking of that is the the lump gone from being a voice throat

[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:35.400]
No probably still some markings there after the parents got him up against the wall nine forty one at five sixty W to QM

Be a patriot not a little book leader the talented film Henry was once one of them

[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.960]
So we took him downstairs to the quiet room

[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:57.980]
We were aware that you're a nice guy Mr. Henry. I was a nice guy myself once. Yeah, oh I had my share of literal views in the past

[00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:05.720]
And I found out Mr. Henry that the world is a school of business. Are you sure there is no need for free thought or creativity?

[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.560]
Yeah, but let me say something for some let me say there is only a knee for clear channel

[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:12.740]
Halliburton

[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:35.580]
947 at 560 WQ. I'm this is a good pull question that Jack and Weston points out

[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:42.360]
Yeah, first he says did you ever get the second page to the facts about unusual activity in the stock market before 911 when you posted on your website

[00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:47.580]
No, I did not get the second page which pisses me off because I'm in the middle of reading a really riveting thing some really

[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:52.080]
Important information and I realized that the first page didn't match the second one

[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.900]
I was reading and the reason being that the middle page was left out

[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.160]
David and they never faxed us the other page

[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:03.320]
I mean we appreciate when people fax is good stuff, but come on, you know two out of three and kind of cut it

[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:08.580]
Anyway, Jackson's PS have been a loyal listener since 86, but I've never called thought it would make a good pull question

[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:12.140]
I didn't understand what he meant in the beginning and then I thought about that and I said yeah, that's right

[00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:16.680]
Have you ever called this show and then of course we can have different categories?

[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.420]
I think we'll do that tomorrow. Don't let me forget don't forget. Okay, I read it down

[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.760]
So Claire, it's came in to say congratulations to you

[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:29.580]
I told him that he would have to say it on the air get on mic and go on the air with it and he ran out because you wouldn't believe me

[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:35.060]
No, he ran out because he knows that I'm gonna talk about how he's in bed with John penis. I well weener

[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.740]
John penis was a different guy. He was a sales guy. John penis was a good sales guy. I should point out

[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.720]
He's gone just like Julio was a great engineer. He's gone

[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:46.540]
That you already told me that was gonna happen

[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.060]
Yeah, I mean you put two and two together and got 69 as usual

[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:52.480]
but

[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.380]
It's just very sad they get squeezed out and they didn't have they they never the decency to do it the right way

[00:40:57.380 --> 00:41:03.720]
They yes squeezed him on well. We can't afford you know the budgets really tight the economy sucks and advertising down a little bit

[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.120]
So what about if you work for $40 a week, huh?

[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:10.780]
And he said no and then instead of saying well, how about 70 they said

[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:16.800]
That was the end good luck to you Julio. You're a good guy. I like you a lot. He had a good time up here

[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:24.500]
Found me the alley. Oh, it's big at Toronto. It's sunny and good. It's 50 right now. I'm gonna be 61 today and we're off the list

[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.180]
Which I'm sure you saw I was

[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.340]
It was too bad because it happened right after we got off the Irmanu clock yesterday. I saw it. Did you see it? Yeah

[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.240]
And it was great

[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:38.220]
Well, wherever the list is we're off it

[00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:40.740]
No more travel advisory from the WH

[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:45.560]
I'm sure that the Toronto officials were over there in Geneva with bag full of money. I mean with a lot of scientific evidence

[00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:49.080]
There's no problem here and of course last night the blue jays

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.160]
Which is kind of unfortunate because the owner of blue jays the guy from Rogers cable

[00:41:54.260 --> 00:42:00.280]
I'll put up tickets for a bucket piece to try to fill a place up and a sold out allegedly almost 50,000

[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.420]
Which the skydome holds about 50,000 plus a little more and they announced the attendance is 48,000

[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.980]
But unfortunately, it's like a marlins attendance announcement because

[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:13.040]
There was no 50,000 people there about 30,000 would be about right

[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:17.180]
But nonetheless that was a lot of people were there because they didn't really care about the ball game that much

[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.800]
But they wanted to show a little solidarity because this is a community where people really do care about their city

[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.780]
I know that's a real novelty in South Florida

[00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.800]
But the people here have a sense of civic pride

[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.000]
They were pissed off and fired up about the WH in the way they screwed us to the tune of about two billion dollars in this time

[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.480]
It's gonna take a long time before people start coming back

[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:40.020]
Because once you put this stigma, look at that 68 tomorrow 54 on Friday and sunny and 50 on Saturday

[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:42.300]
It's beautiful come on up and bring a lot of money, okay

[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.340]
The hotels here and they make all kinds of special deals. I should point out too. Yeah, they are

[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.800]
All kinds of package deals. Where's Mikey when we need him, you know

[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:56.100]
Speaking of people who are not with us anymore. Olivia the havelin is not one of them

[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:02.340]
Somebody faxes me not one but two pages and in this case both pages are here which I could live without but thank you anyway

[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:07.340]
Olivia married to havelin was born to a British patent attorney in his wife July 1st

[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:13.080]
1916 in Tokyo, Japan, which means in just a couple of months. She'll be 87 that's not that old no

[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.920]
Especially by South Florida standards

[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:20.260]
So Olivia the havelin I take it back. I apologize profusely. She is still alive

[00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:24.600]
Which is even all the more recent she'd have been pissed off if she saw no votes for the snake pit

[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.500]
That was a very good movie wasn't I have to have about a hundred years ago

[00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.520]
No, you don't have to go see it was depressing was about a woman in a mental institution. Oh, thanks. No, thank you

[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.700]
Kind of like the QA'm story

[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:43.320]
Oh, look at this now. This is great treasure island tonight good thing you fact me this right now because we want to really promote it heavy duty

[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.720]
Join George McGell Vokobrine and Carlos

[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:47.940]
Benerboy

[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.960]
And when if you haven't met beener boy yet you'll understand as soon as you see him why I call him beener boy and why

[00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:56.220]
George calls him ugly Chuck now that's bad

[00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:02.060]
That's because you're heartless. I'm not gonna get some reputation as being cool and mr. cold and heartless

[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.240]
But you're the one that's really a heartless prick. Yeah

[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.800]
Yeah, I don't be dirty

[00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:11.120]
They'll be it happy our five to seven at treasure island right off the Palmetto just north of the 120 second street

[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.220]
Thanks. It's stop by to win prizes enjoyed drinks specials. Why do they you know?

[00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:16.560]
It's almost 10 o'clock. I haven't even got today's for yet right

[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.780]
Because I'm too busy talking about the numbers and pat myself on the back and all of these things

[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.780]
And Clarence still hasn't come into say nice book and congratulations because he knows that I'll rip him and ask about that

[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.920]
John Weiner thing and he and rightfully so speaking about yourself on the back before you get

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.100]
Totally off of the charity thing just for reference you raised well over a million dollars over the years

[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:40.900]
Between all the charities. Yes, and just just so mo knows no

[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.500]
He look it doesn't make any difference

[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:45.920]
He's come into this town with the idea because I didn't suck his ass from the beginning

[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.760]
Although I was the one guy because I'm not a sports guy that gave him a chance for about five minutes

[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.080]
I realized what a prick he was

[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:57.700]
But other than that no matter what it is we've accomplished on the show in terms of ratings in terms of reading money for charity in terms of being the

[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.700]
Centerpiece of the radio station in terms of moving the time slot to economy him

[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:07.080]
And his lazy tired old ass we can only work three hours all of and nothing you will ever get anything from him on that

[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:12.120]
Because he's not the kind of person who makes any accommodation for anybody else. He's relentless. He's heartless

[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.680]
He's obnoxious, which is why everybody else that he's every place else

[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:19.260]
That I know of that he's ever been they've said bye bye bye. Yeah

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.580]
Now you think that it's a coincidence or maybe there's a pattern there

[00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:29.200]
Huh and kill and believe you me when this last book came up the other day when these numbers came and we I mentioned this yesterday

[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:33.880]
There were some people in the building and management positions who weren't all that happy that the morning number went up

[00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:37.440]
Would have been delighted to say bye bye bye him as well, but you know

[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.940]
He's got a couple years left. You think they're gonna be new to that contract. No

[00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:42.000]
We'll see

[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:46.860]
We'll see a lot of things gonna happen a couple years. I could decide to hang it up real soon like in about five minutes

[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.360]
You know, I might just yeah come 10 o'clock. I might just say okay. That's it. That's long enough

[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.820]
I mean what what's the point other than the fact that I can use the cash

[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:00.240]
Thanks to certain people who helped me to lose a lot of money

[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.860]
To walk in any more free meals out of me

[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.960]
Here's today's poll question and we thank Alan our regular faxing friend who sent in some real good suggestions for polls

[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.940]
Don't be afraid to send the suggestions for polls even if they're stupid. Sometimes the stupid ones are the good ones right

[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:20.900]
Just like shows sometimes the stupid shows are the good one this shows here to prove that we can't I'll be intellectual like that morning

[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.600]
What Florida tourist destination would you uh

[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.660]
Tell your out of state friends to avoid

[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.060]
What Florida tourist destination would you tell your out of state friends to avoid I've made a list of six

[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.020]
And I'm sure this audience being as creative and hostile as they are they'll come up with some additional ones

[00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:40.920]
Uh Disney World. I don't think anybody vote for Disney World. Why would you want to avoid that?

[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:46.420]
But it's it's just so obvious, you know bush gardens. I like bush gardens, but I put it on there because it's obviously

[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:49.920]
See the problem with bush gardens is to go there. You have to go to Tampa. Yeah

[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.100]
Joe Stone crabs see and now Joe Stone Crabbs is not an amusement park, but it might as well be because it's

[00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.800]
It's a tourist destination

[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:01.920]
Right, that's well known. I'm not just talking about like amusement parks because there aren't that many in the first place

[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:07.260]
But it can be restaurants. It can be shopping malls. It can be any place that's a tourist trap destination

[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.420]
Whatever Joe Stone Crabbs overpriced another state of mind

[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:17.160]
Rascal house another state of mind and believe you me unless you're well might go into it, you know

[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.320]
Unless you like rudeness and croutness and just nasty old people

[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.820]
Oi, I want to say nasty old Jews that bitch will call back again

[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.680]
Whether go and eat at the rascal house they're allowed

[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:32.720]
I wonder if they feel as much stuff into their bag while they're waiting as the old Jews

[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.520]
Key West and the Sawgrass Mills malls that fills out my list of six Disney World bush gardens

[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:40.480]
Joe Stone Crabbs Rascal House Key West Sawgrass Mills mall

[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.060]
If you're if you're thinking about going to South Florida and you don't go to the Sawgrass Mills mall, okay

[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:48.120]
I know now you're laughing

[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:54.140]
But it's the number two tourist destination in the state. No, I know which tells me that either there's a lot of stupid people

[00:47:54.140 --> 00:47:58.280]
Uh, or they're doing a hell of a marketing job or they're just ain't all that much to see in Florida

[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:00.220]
In spite of all the crap about its paradise paradise

[00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.760]
Yeah, there's a lot of nice weather although it's raining and nasty there days after day after day is what I'm here

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:10.780]
And I even see some some problems here on your phone thing going out and I'm assuming that you're losing the power if you know and

[00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:18.040]
Uh, one one blip today, but I expect more it's uh, you must add another blip because it went out again here during that last break

[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.880]
And I got it back. I phone connection to the world

[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.540]
So there's some real tourists there with the weather. It's uh, we'll see. We'll see what else they come up with

[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:29.500]
Tourist destinations to avoid in Florida

[00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.740]

Stay at the hotel for practically nothing

[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.800]
Go out and get some good street meat

[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.020]
I'm telling you they got Italian sausage with fried onions here that is so good

[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:07.980]
It's just enough to make you scream it. Oh fried onions

[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:13.860]
I mentioned this yesterday, but I'm just looking to Palm Beach post. I couldn't find anything in there either. It's so sad

[00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.880]
So sad what about your horse ball newspapers you haven't saw Florida

[00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:23.980]
Jerry Williams who was one of the originators he was my idol as a child about a hundred years ago

[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.840]
Dean of talk radio and Boston dead at 79 now why would that be in a South Florida newspapers?

[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.280]
Number one, it should be in a Palm Beach post because Jerry had a home in Palm Beach for many many years

[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:38.720]
Number two he was on WNWS back in 1980 which is hardly a hundred years ago in the heyday

[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.440]
That was the greatest year of that station's history. We had a rating book

[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:47.080]
One of the books that year that was so gigantic. It was just humongous. It was huge huge

[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.100]
And he's dead at 79

[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:57.760]
Could I find anything in a hurled about Jerry Williams dying? No anything in a sunsend old times. I have a little piece on it. No

[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:06.180]
Well, I mean, well, what are we talking about here seriously? What the hell are we talking about and you wonder why the public is so ill-informed

[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:11.960]
If you ask me this radio station is about the only place in South Florida. You'll find anything that's going on in the world

[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.600]
That you really want to hear about, you know?

[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:15.240]
Mm-hmm

[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:20.240]
Seriously, I'm not talking about network news. I mean, that's not South Florida. Anybody can get that anywhere

[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.380]
But I'm just talking about in the South Florida area

[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:30.780]
You know, we get a couple lost puppies on the news in a couple of, you know, uh, illegal aliens that are washing up on shore the same old tire dreck

[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.560]
And the stories too

[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.840]
Oh, this is good

[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:40.760]
A tourist place to avoid inflow it and somebody says a Marlins game. I like that

[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.100]
Ha ha ha ha

[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:46.140]
Marlins game excellent and obviously a lot of people taking their advice

[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:47.500]
Marlins game

[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:54.920]
Okay, we can put that pull up anytime you want Eric. I don't want to start getting pushed because you've been doing a magnificent job of restraining yourself the last couple of weeks

[00:52:54.920 --> 00:53:01.460]
He did call an ask you called an ask if whether what do you tell or not? What do you tell him that we would let him know?

[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.900]
Well, I just let him know there you go. See must be psychic powers working again

[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.400]
What Florida tourist destination would you tell your out of state friends to avoid

[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:16.380]
We got so far Disney World Bush Gardens, Joe Stone Crabbs, Rascal House, Key West, the Soggrass Mills Mall and the Marlins game

[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.540]
And I'm waiting to hear it go to phones again. There we go

[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:22.100]
Now this is a tough one. What am I going to vote for? I wonder

[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.840]
My choice is clear and what well. I'm let's see. Yeah, you'll see

[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.220]
Uh

[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.760]
I'm going to say the Soggrass Mills Mall because I live out five day number one and number two for the life of me

[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.920]
I can't imagine why anybody I mean, oh, yeah, Joe Stone crab is George voted for

[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:42.020]
But why would anybody go to the Soggrass Mills? Well, there's nothing there. There's no anchor store

[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.200]
Well, they're like big. They're the main thing. Huh? It's a mall

[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.200]
Well, when you go out of town to

[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:54.320]
You go to a mall. No, I mean, I take that back in Amsterdam for example. There's a mall

[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.960]
I'm trying to think what's all the name. It is

[00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:01.860]
At least they have a big one of the big chain record stores in there. I mean, they need the big chain record store

[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:06.020]
Virgin spec. Okay. It was the only virgin in town in Amsterdam with the record store

[00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:11.500]
But they're out of business. But anyway, there there's a big shopping mall there. They used to be some kind of a big

[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:15.180]
Palace or something and that's a neat place to go see

[00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:19.020]
Yeah, but I mean, I wouldn't consider it as a tourist destination

[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:25.200]
Now, I will say this like in Vegas, Caesar's and the NGM just to name a couple have these huge malls within the hotel

[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:32.160]
That's just a part of uh, well, yeah, but there's a great the big shopping mall in Vegas though is so what's the name of that to the fashion

[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:39.160]
Something mall now you probably never win there because you weren't there enough uh long enough right that is one sensational mall

[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:43.260]
They'll just have your ordinary pedestrian stores. They have like these old collectible store

[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:47.660]
There's one of them and it just some really nifty stores in there the fashion something mall in Vegas

[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:52.920]
So that's one of the places you would go, but the sawgrass mills mall there's there's nothing to attract you there

[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.340]
I mean, they've got a couple of food courts and they got

[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.940]
Name me one thing they got there that you would go to see

[00:54:58.940 --> 00:54:58.980]
Maybe

[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:06.540]
Besides a bunch of people who can't speak English you don't need to go there to see that huh? I'm done. I don't I just don't get it

[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.060]
WQ I am

[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:14.560]
Yeah, I like to add something on it was let go ahead uh the swap shop

[00:55:15.260 --> 00:55:20.480]
Ha ha ha ha okay, okay, that's the end of that and then I still need a press in the swap shop

[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.760]
Huh? That's one of our fine sponsors in the past

[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:27.100]
Yeah, but he's entitled high he's in town. What was his opinion?

[00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:30.200]
I mean if I was a tourist coming to town unless I was a french Canadian

[00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.560]
I'm not so sure I'd go and smell the elephant dust, but it's uh than if he played

[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:33.840]
huh

[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:38.960]
It's a nifty place for the people who live in town and know where the bargains are at the swap shop

[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:43.920]
But there you go. See that guy's probably from our third channel, huh? You've had out of town friends come to town. I take it

[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:49.460]
yes now would you tell them to go to the swap shop for the smell grismals? Would anybody tell them? No

[00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:53.340]
Okay, I wouldn't come to go to the brouwered mall. I wouldn't come to go to day land. I wouldn't tell them my daily

[00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:57.260]
uh... any mall go to the strip shopping center as a as a matter of fact you

[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:59.380]
know i was in the eatin center the other day here on the weekend

[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.980]
don't say the series and i think i said sorry center

[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:04.260]
uh... and

[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.520]
that there's no more in south Florida like that it's like three floors three

[00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:09.120]
stories

[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:13.980]
or for me i'm not really sure it's huge gigantic

[00:56:14.540 --> 00:56:17.640]
there's not a mall in south for anything like that not even close

[00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:21.500]
and they have a lower c-court in their two

[00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:22.060]
uh...

[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.000]
don't ask okay

[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:24.680]
that you can

[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:31.340]
and you hear that yeah that was that telltale sound we were out of that

[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:32.240]
that you can't have

[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:34.900]

[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:38.360]

[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.480]

[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:03.300]
ample number of watering holes you can get drunk anywhere you want including right at home you don't

[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:08.500]

[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:19.720]
though i think he mislabeled either that or got the wrong disc and the wrong thing you think

[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.100]
that's possible no and oh i do not have the wrong disc and the wrong thing

[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:28.440]
because that's i mean that's a fine bit you know especially the part where he talks about the

[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.340]
mustard and old Jews or something get that one old bitch upset but that'll see that's the wrong

[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:43.980]
or cut i think he's got to mix up with i don't think any of these match it's kind of like mix

[01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:47.920]
and match in fact some of these might even not have any bleeps in them let's play some of those

[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:52.460]
and see how they come out huh oh wait let's go back to number one which is supposed to be f

[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:57.700]
doctor Laura or dower bitch on right that's right number two is supposed to be 20 blears

[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:09.140]
how do you like that one the hell oh that's my favorite book of bribe bit of all time

[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:15.380]
number three is supposed to be wore with a happy face huh that's your as hell is an ass

[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.060]
what is that this is uh

[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:45.740]
I don't know, maybe it is the wrong disc.

[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:48.240]
It matches what I have on the label, but that's okay.

[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.280]
It makes it more fun that way.

[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.080]
Here's the fact that it says,

[01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:53.700]
did you see the news last night that Texas Wildlife Officer

[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.380]
dragged the alligator that was alive down the road

[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.000]
behind his pickup truck?

[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:00.440]
It said this was unreal,

[01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:02.040]
the gator was rolling and fighting.

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:04.420]
This guy should be brought up on criminal charges

[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.680]
and thrown in jail.

[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:08.840]
PS it says, probably is related to GWV.

[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.300]
I guess the statute didn't hear about when Laura Bush

[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:16.220]
was speaking at Gainesville and said,

[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:18.120]
Can't beat that gator meat.

[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.380]
I guess you didn't hear about that.

[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.680]
567, Sergio says, how about Kai Ocho?

[01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.060]
I think that's a little event, isn't it?

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:26.340]
Right.

[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.100]
It's on the Ilian Museum.

[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.660]
Well, when we build the Ilian Museum,

[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:31.640]
I think that would be, in fact, can you imagine?

[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:35.180]
Lots of tourists would go see the Ilian Museum.

[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:38.260]
We can have a little, we can have some of the rappers

[01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:40.040]
from the happy meal at the daddy bar.

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:43.000]
We can have some of the old beer bottles from Lazaro.

[01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:43.920]
Yeah.

[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.600]
We can have some samples from Marist Risi's ass.

[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.320]
I have a great column here, boy.

[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.780]
This is the winner today on our website.

[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:53.080]
A lot of great ones on it as always,

[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:56.580]
but this one's the winner in my humble opinion.

[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.020]
It's not that long either.

[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:01.120]
See, I don't wanna start it right now,

[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.040]
because then I'll interrupt myself and I wanna do that.

[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.220]
I've learned time myself reading these bed times.

[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:08.600]
There is, you don't wanna get up against a break

[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.180]
and then I'll have to interrupt your important stuff.

[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:12.200]
Operation Medium and Opal-E Freedom.

[01:08:12.820 --> 01:08:15.320]
I'm gonna read it in a few minutes by Nancy Snow.

[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:19.280]
Statement by Nancy Snow to the FCC Public Forum

[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:20.360]
on Media Consolidation.

[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.820]
She's the author of Propaganda Inc.

[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:23.780]
and Information Wars.

[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.000]
She's Assistant Professor Communications and Journalism

[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:27.480]
at California State University,

[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.900]
Edgent Professor at USC's Annabelle School for Communication.

[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:31.460]
So she's got just some schlepper

[01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.720]
that came off of a banana boat somewhere.

[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.980]
She's got some pretty heavy duty credentials behind her.

[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:38.240]
Operation Medium and Opal-E Freedom.

[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:39.680]
And the timing of this is great because

[01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.440]
coming up on June number two,

[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.240]
that's when the FCC is gonna put the last nails in a coffin.

[01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:46.360]
And the Republican Party is gonna put the last nails

[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:48.540]
in the coffin of any possibility ever

[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:50.460]
of any diversity in radio or TV

[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.240]
or newspapers for that matter.

[01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:53.720]
That's gonna be the end.

[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.960]
Wonder what Alan Greenspan thinks about it.

[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.800]
Households appear to have become somewhat less apprehensive

[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.180]
about-

[01:08:59.180 --> 01:08:59.920]
Say how do you like that?

[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:00.760]
He's got something to say.

[01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.160]
Same old tired crap, you know?

[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.440]
What the hell did that?

[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.340]
He must really be loaded.

[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.200]
It's no-oho.

[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600]
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

[01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:11.220]
Yeah, he's got all-

[01:09:11.220 --> 01:09:13.080]
he's got money that hasn't been printed yet, right?

[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:15.420]
He's married to what's your name from NBC News?

[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:16.280]
What's her name?

[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.640]
Do you know the one I'm talking about?

[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.140]
The one that's always on Eat the Press?

[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.480]
Oh, yeah.

[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.440]
I can see or I can't think of her name right now.

[01:09:23.460 --> 01:09:23.880]
That's bad.

[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.000]
Somebody will tell us.

[01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:28.840]
What Florida tourist destination would you tell your

[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.040]
opt-town friends to avoid, like to plague?

[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.540]
Songrass Mills Mall 27.

[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:35.720]
Joe Stone grabs 18.

[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.200]
What the hell is her name?

[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:39.200]
It almost just came to me there.

[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.640]
Rascal House 13, Key West 10, Disney World 5.

[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.760]
Little Havana's got up here.

[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.140]
Two for Little Havana.

[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.000]
Ain't good to eat, Blitz.

[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.580]
Bush Gardens got one, Marlins Game 1,

[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:51.320]
a Swap Shop 1, and none yet.

[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.440]
None for the My Kai, Bayside or this Equarium.

[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.100]
Out of 79 votes.

[01:09:56.220 --> 01:09:56.900]
There'll be some more coming.

[01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:57.920]
Guaranteed on that.

[01:09:59.520 --> 01:09:59.920]
WDQAM.

[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.100]
QAM, hello?

[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.780]
Nobody there?

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.400]
Nope.

[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.440]
Maybe there are dancing in a rain with Martha and

[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.480]
Abendellas or KC WDQAM.

[01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:15.000]
Going once.

[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:15.480]
Oh, man.

[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:16.780]
Oh, there's nothing.

[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:17.420]
Oh, there it is.

[01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.680]
Oh, there was nothing happened.

[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.520]
I got real panicky.

[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.860]
This thing's acting up now.

[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:21.420]
See that?

[01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:24.040]
Oh, I'm Mitchell.

[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:26.040]
Andrew Mitchell, thank you.

[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:27.420]
Thank you.

[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.180]
He's wearing an Andrew.

[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300]
Well, that's why they were all caught.

[01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.440]
See, I can't get this thing.

[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:31.180]
I can't get it off.

[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.040]
And the phone, really?

[01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.340]
Well, no, it's just.

[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:36.900]
WDQAM.

[01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.400]
See now it's going back to line two again.

[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.640]
This thing has all screwed up.

[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:40.700]
Now there's nothing lit up here.

[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:42.380]
What do you mean by that?

[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:43.980]
I mean, there's nothing pressed.

[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:44.640]
Third is three.

[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:46.540]
Hello, three is pressed.

[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:47.780]
I don't, I didn't press it.

[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:48.240]
Hello.

[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:49.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:49.800]
Neil.

[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:50.460]
Yeah.

[01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:51.780]
Isn't it the forum shop?

[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.040]
The one down from Feesers.

[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.180]
Is that the one you're talking about?

[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.720]
The forum shops?

[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.180]
In Vegas, that mall.

[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:58.020]
Oh, that's it, right.

[01:10:58.140 --> 01:10:59.120]
That's a graveyard we've been in there.

[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:01.360]
But you got to have at least five grand before you walk

[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:01.740]
in the door.

[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:02.260]
Yeah.

[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.600]
Not only is there a real nifty place, but very, very pricey.

[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.820]
You have to go in with like some of these credit cards.

[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:10.120]
OK, thanks.

[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:11.720]
Forum shops and Andrew Mitchell.

[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.640]
I'm having a bitch of a time making this damn phone thing.

[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:15.640]
See, they get right out of the hole.

[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.520]
And right away, everything stops working again.

[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:19.920]
I don't think it's a coincidence either.

[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.620]
Now, what kind of a flunky moron are they

[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.920]
going to bring in now to replace Julio?

[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:27.220]
Do we know where they're just going to let that job kind of float?

[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:27.840]
We don't know.

[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:28.620]
Uh-huh.

[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.660]
Probably somebody that couldn't make it for the sales department.

[01:11:34.020 --> 01:11:34.980]
Who would like to be?

[01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.000]
Line 9 is always dependable.

[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:36.860]
Dominic QA, I'm Hello.

[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.520]
Yes, I speak to Neil, please.

[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.000]
Speaking.

[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.080]
Hi, Neil.

[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:40.780]
How are you doing?

[01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:43.280]
Listen, did you have a little satellite TV?

[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.860]
Did I have a little satellite TV, yes?

[01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:48.740]
Yeah, do you have a little satellite TV?

[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:49.380]
Yes.

[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:53.680]
You need to go to free speech TV, 9 415.

[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.160]
Well, I don't have that here.

[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:56.380]
And I don't have that right here.

[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:56.620]
No.

[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.620]
I had that at home.

[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:02.300]
Yeah, at home at 7 o'clock, you can watch free speech TV.

[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:05.320]
They'll tell you exactly what's happening in the United States.

[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:09.460]
They don't want us to know, like just Jessica Lang's story.

[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.760]
That was a fake.

[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:15.020]
That was the boost morality in the United States.

[01:12:15.360 --> 01:12:16.520]
Saving private Jessica?

[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:17.040]
Yeah.

[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:20.260]
They said that they interviewed the doctor.

[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:21.620]
They called the army.

[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.220]
Yeah, we had that on our website on the website, like 10 days ago,

[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:26.520]
that it was all stayed.

[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:26.860]
Yeah.

[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:30.680]
One of them runs out going to go see the people and look in their eyes.

[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.840]
The ones that he wounded.

[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:32.440]
No.

[01:12:32.940 --> 01:12:33.560]
And have a great day.

[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:34.960]
OK, have a great day and say how to Randy.

[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.740]
My vote says this factor for Bayside, one of our most chronic factors.

[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.980]
Also, the pirate jungle since we opened in June or July,

[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:43.560]
knew it improved.

[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:44.580]
So we can't put that on there.

[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:46.260]
In fact, that might be one you'd recommend.

[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.220]
Go see the new and improved.

[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:50.460]
Also, Ricky Tiki went off big time on the Dixie Tix today,

[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:51.720]
who says he's not a Nazi.

[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.020]
Ricky Tiki went off on the Dixie Tix.

[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:57.600]
What the hell is the Dixie Tix got to do with the magic?

[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:58.140]
It's a lie.

[01:12:58.360 --> 01:12:59.380]
I am not a Nazi.

[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:02.020]
It says does magic play the Dixie Tix?

[01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:02.220]
No.

[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:03.240]
So what does he wish this time?

[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.320]
Oh, don't tell me that they got to him too.

[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:08.000]
OK, they must have looked under his cap and done a lobotomy.

[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:08.460]
It's a lie.

[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:09.700]
I am not a Nazi.

[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.540]
God, that's tragic.

[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:11.920]
OK.

[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.680]
That is so sad.

[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:16.800]
Well, I guess he's going to have to go off on Bruce Springsteen too,

[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:19.540]
because he was pissed off about the way that everybody came down on Dixie Tix.

[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.400]
It's strictly a polycrab.

[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.880]
Like I said, Ricky Goshron never impressed me too much.

[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:27.800]
1026 at 560 QAM.

[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:32.040]
My life and look all this is 420560.

[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.140]
Way to go, yeah.

[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:35.680]
Get, baby.

[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:40.420]
R. Kelly, he's known for his seductive style, his suggested lyrics,

[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:46.480]
and for having relations with underage girls, which means now all of his songs are inappropriate.

[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:48.820]
That's why jail mate records presents.

[01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:53.860]
R. Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits with inappropriate tunes like,

[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:57.740]
Oh, man, is that ever inappropriate?

[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:01.740]
And that's why it's called, R. Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits,

[01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:04.340]
with improper favorites like, Bump and Grind.

[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.520]
Yikes!

[01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.060]
It's R. Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits.

[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.180]
You'll ask, what is this per thinking?

[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.400]
When you hear completely inappropriate songs like,

[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.480]
Sex Me, your body's calling,

[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:22.680]
Down Low.

[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:25.560]
And is most recent inappropriate hit, Ignition?

[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.080]
Come on, R. Kelly.

[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:38.960]
She's not even old enough to drive.

[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.580]
So, she'll have to get a ride from her mom to pick up a copy of,

[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:45.620]
R. Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits.

[01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.740]
Hi, my name is R. Kelly.

[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.500]
Please buy my new CD,

[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:53.340]
so I will have enough money to free the country life from up to ESC.

[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:54.620]
Thank you very much.

[01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.340]
R. Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits,

[01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:00.940]
available wherever records store owners have no scoop with lots of weapons.

[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.680]
1031, I bet you'd enjoy a shopper in Virgin Records, what do you think?

[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.240]
Shopping?

[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.680]
Avoid Metro Zoo, and Lion Rippoff Safari, I mean Lion Country Safari, it says.

[01:15:11.880 --> 01:15:14.760]
Well, let's put those on our Metro Zoo, Ron McGill be upset about that.

[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.820]
You ever ridden of the Metro Zoo?

[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:17.780]
No, it's a matter of fact.

[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:18.740]
Neither was I.

[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]
How the weather hell, it's way, way down there.

[01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:21.520]
It's a slut.

[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:23.260]
Been there years and years ago.

[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.320]
And it was fine, I mean, I was a little kid, but it was fine.

[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:28.220]
Well, what the hell would you know?

[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:29.420]
I mean, even now, what do you know?

[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.360]
So, back then,

[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:32.860]
Metro Zoo and Lion Country Safari,

[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.300]
and I know is what do we got so far?

[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.000]
Sog Rasmus, Mal, 30 people,

[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.040]
say they would tell their friends to avoid it like a plague.

[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.220]
Don't go there.

[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.260]
22, say, little Havana.

[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.200]
22, Joe Stone Crabbs.

[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:44.340]
14, Rascal House.

[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.280]
10 Key West.

[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:46.720]
Everybody also for on single digits.

[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.120]
Single digits.

[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.620]
Let's see, what's on the agenda today?

[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.820]
We got a one o'clock to mad dog, usual schedule.

[01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:55.500]
But then a tree from a sure list, take two,

[01:15:55.620 --> 01:15:56.300]
it's our buddy.

[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:59.920]
Because Hank Subzziplunchin has guts on the Derby, I guess.

[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.000]
He's in Louisville,

[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.060]
and he must be doing like other things.

[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:03.580]
Man.

[01:16:04.120 --> 01:16:06.920]
Josh Freeman at seven o'clock, Georgia's favorite fat guy.

[01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:07.980]
Not.

[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.720]
Marlins on deck at nine,

[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.260]
and Marlins in the diamond backs again.

[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.920]
Did the Marlins win that last night?

[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:13.940]
They were at five nothing.

[01:16:14.960 --> 01:16:15.680]
We don't know.

[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.240]
Don't know.

[01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:17.580]
What do you mean you don't know?

[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.200]
Marlins at the diamond backs, nine, 35,

[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.260]
the night game time.

[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.880]
Or what is that all about?

[01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:24.220]
Is there a, what kind of a schedule?

[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.240]
Oh, any K, holy cow.

[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.360]
It's going to Vegas.

[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.600]
So he must be on route.

[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:32.200]
So the big O is going to be on the night.

[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.580]
Too much of the big O on lately.

[01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:35.500]
And Mark Eisenberg back to back two to six.

[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:37.080]
Boy, that isn't quite a quinella.

[01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:39.140]
Oh, the big O followed by Mark Eisenberg.

[01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:40.920]
You know what that's called in Broadcasting?

[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.020]
It's that.

[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.400]
Test pattern.

[01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.720]
Operation Media Monopoly Freedom writes Nancy Snow.

[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.980]
This was her statement to the FCC public forum

[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:52.000]
on media consolidation.

[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.300]
Washington DC is the in the liberating people

[01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:57.920]
in other countries have at these days.

[01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:00.300]
Mr. Cops, we the people of the United States

[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.140]
could use more than our own fair share of liberation

[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.400]
from our media oligopoly.

[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:06.080]
About a month from today, June 2nd,

[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:08.160]
the FCC is expected to substantially relax

[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:10.120]
the regulatory cap on how many TV stations

[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.400]
in a single company may own.

[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.760]
Right now, rules bar American broadcasts

[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:16.960]
are promoting TV stations reaching more than 35% of homes.

[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:19.740]
They are likely to be raised to 45% coverage.

[01:17:20.160 --> 01:17:22.180]
Further, it's very likely that rules will be lifted

[01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.700]
to the limit the ability of broadcasts

[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.540]
to buy second TV stations in their markets,

[01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.060]
or borrow cities and newspaper and broadcasts station

[01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:28.580]
from merging.

[01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.100]
While the FCC has been holding a few window

[01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:32.920]
dressing public forums across the country,

[01:17:33.340 --> 01:17:35.700]
the real decision making regarding the new FCC rules

[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.100]
is being made between the few existing media companies

[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:39.760]
and a government agency with appointed,

[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:40.680]
unlected officials.

[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:44.200]
The FCC will do what is politically expedient

[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.280]
while the public interest will continue to be talked

[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.560]
about in newspaper editorials and college textbooks.

[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:49.720]
How do I know this?

[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.820]
Because of what happened with the Telecommunications Act of 1996,

[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:55.280]
when the public was left completely out of the discussion.

[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.640]
Brian Lowry, media writer of the LA Times,

[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.600]
has stated that the new FCC rule changes

[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:02.420]
affecting consolidation and ownership of the media

[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.180]
is tremendously underreported,

[01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:06.300]
perhaps the most underreported news story of our time.

[01:18:06.300 --> 01:18:08.720]
In fact, the consolidation story is being reported,

[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.220]
but not on the front pages of our newspapers.

[01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.020]
It's in a business in finance,

[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.780]
sex and newspapers, and broadcast industry publications

[01:18:14.780 --> 01:18:16.900]
for only those in the know and industry insiders

[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:17.980]
follow the subject.

[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:20.980]
We, the people, have become water liplens be wilted,

[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.520]
heard, and are forced to function like the angry mob

[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.860]
at the gates or the proverbial peanut gallery,

[01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.060]
occasionally whining that nothing is on to watch,

[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.700]
but we know not where to turn for help

[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:30.600]
so we just keep watching.

[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:32.580]
And by the way, no one in this room

[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.840]
is bothered to address the addictive qualities of television.

[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.340]
Jerry Mande wrote about the insidiousness of TV

[01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.400]
over 20 years ago in four arguments

[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.760]
for the elimination of television.

[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.240]
It's truly ironic that as we sit here

[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.940]
today discussing American press ownership,

[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:46.720]
the U.S. government's rebroadcasting,

[01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.580]
Dan Rather, Tom Brokhan, Peter Jennings, and Iraqi TV

[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:52.060]
to show the Iraqi people what a free press looks like

[01:18:52.060 --> 01:18:52.700]
in a democracy.

[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.160]
Before we teach others about democracy,

[01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.180]
we might try practicing it here at home.

[01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.560]
Media power is political power,

[01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:01.140]
and one of the public is being left out of this

[01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:02.960]
major decision that affects all of our lives.

[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:05.040]
We've been asked to sit on the sidelines,

[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.880]
keep shopping, follow the NBA playoffs,

[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.080]
or watch Must-C-TV, while the corporate mega-media

[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.320]
and their appointed friends and government

[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.000]
cozy up and bring us anything but the democratic landscape

[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.600]
of information and news we can use.

[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.640]
If democracy is about vigorous and antagonistic debate,

[01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.580]
full of a wide spectrum of voices and opinions

[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.700]
were hardly their brothers and sisters in Iraq.

[01:19:24.100 --> 01:19:25.600]
We have less than a handful of media

[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.720]
who bring us all our news and those news sources

[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:29.660]
that bring us the news are increasingly dependent

[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.480]
on their close ties to official Washington

[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:33.300]
and other corporate sources of news.

[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:37.380]
Our 24-hour news cycle requires constant feeding,

[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:40.180]
which advertising and publicity pre-packed sources of news

[01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:41.480]
are only too happy to nourish.

[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.980]
In the federal government, the largest public relations

[01:19:43.980 --> 01:19:45.460]
of vision is inside the Pentagon,

[01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:47.880]
where government public relations specialists provide

[01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.240]
Monday through Friday feeds to the national media.

[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:52.920]
Embedded reporters didn't just accompany the military

[01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.860]
to the Middle East, but they also sit regularly

[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:57.100]
for pre-arranged briefings from Donald Rumsfeld,

[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.780]
Tory Clark, and Erie Fleischer.

[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:00.820]
In a corporate media environment today,

[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:03.080]
the best journalist is increasingly the beautiful journalist

[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.280]
who understands that symbiotic relationship

[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.080]
between official channels of information sources

[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.240]
and the news story product.

[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.500]
Long gone are the days of independent journalists

[01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.780]
like George Selva, who would have gladly been kicked out

[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:14.260]
of his first Washington press briefing

[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.320]
in exchange for the neighborhood going on back home.

[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.820]
Just last week, a little truth emerged from the fog of war.

[01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:22.800]
MSNBC journalist Ashley Banfield told the gathering

[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:25.420]
of students of Kansas State University that the American people

[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.580]
didn't see what happened after mortars landed in Iraq

[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.760]
only the puffs of smoke.

[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.440]
There were horrors completely left out of the war coverage

[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:34.740]
in the US. What we did see was at what advertising

[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:36.580]
converging media and official sources of news

[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.940]
won us to see a non-stop flow of images

[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:40.740]
by cable news operators who wrapped themselves

[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:43.640]
in the American flag and go after a certain target demographic.

[01:20:44.220 --> 01:20:46.120]
It was, she said, a grand and glorious picture

[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.280]
that had a lot of people watching and a lot of advertisers

[01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:51.160]
excited about cable TV news, but it was not journalism.

[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.400]
Nancy says, I teach in a college of communications

[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:56.520]
where journalism concentrations are all but dead

[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.700]
while advertising in public relations concentrations

[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:01.840]
are thriving. Why? Because students are wise to the fact

[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.320]
that the news businesses where the jobs are not creating

[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.760]
the next mural or crank height. They know that broadcasting

[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.840]
used to have a clear mandate for public service

[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.820]
that's been lost in the fog of consolidation.

[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:13.620]
Try telling someone that the American people are the real

[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.120]
landlords of the broadcast airways and that broadcasts

[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:18.640]
are enjoying rent control, person, see what kind of looks you'll get.

[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:21.460]
We all know the truth of what's really going on here.

[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.520]
When President Bush assured the Iraqi people that

[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.040]
the Iraq's oil fields were properly owned by the Iraqi people,

[01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:28.680]
I couldn't help but think about that other hot rhetoric we hear

[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.520]
so often that the American public owned the airways.

[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:33.780]
We're sick of empty promises. Everyone in this room needs to carry

[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:35.920]
around the following statements and organizing principle.

[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.400]
The airwaves did not belong to the broadcasters.

[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:41.180]
They did not belong to the advertisers. The owners of the broadcast

[01:21:41.180 --> 01:21:43.440]
airwaves by law are the people of the United States.

[01:21:44.020 --> 01:21:46.100]
Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed

[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:48.440]
citizens can change this dynamic we will.

[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:51.760]
And it's the best advertisement we can have to a rack Afghanistan

[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:54.000]
or a place else about what a truly free and liberated

[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.360]
people's media looks like. Nancy Snow, professor of the author

[01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:01.040]
of Propagand, Incan Information War and professor of communications

[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.620]
and journalism at California State.

[01:22:02.980 --> 01:22:04.740]
Good column, Nancy. Nice going, sweetheart.

[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:06.840]
Right on target, baby. She's better come on.

[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.940]
All spin all day. That's with the American people like

[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:14.640]
Nancy has been cut in the middle of a dryer of a war or

[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.280]
war-shing machine. All spin all day. They run at cycle

[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.060]
and they can't get off.

[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:23.560]
5.670560, pound 560 on the 18 and T line.

[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.100]
What Florida tourist destination would you tell your

[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:29.780]
out of state friends to avoid like the plague, like a

[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:34.160]
Saras Pit, 156 votes so far in the pool?

[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.300]
Song Rasmills Mall is leading as a place to avoid 36

[01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:42.700]
little of Anna 31, Joe Stone Crab's 23, the Rascal House,

[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.460]
14, Keywise 12, the Swabstrop 10 and Disney World 10.

[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:49.860]
I'll tell you one thing, you know who should avoid

[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:52.260]
the Rascal House? Yeah, I don't know.

[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:55.960]
The Beast. The Beast. That was the end of him.

[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.320]
That's what put him over the edge with us and probably

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:02.360]
a lot of other people too. I guess he's just practicing

[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:04.600]
on being an old antivore, but I have a bad news for him.

[01:23:04.620 --> 01:23:07.100]
If he continues with his roadtunned ways, he will not be

[01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:09.420]
around to be an old antivore in South Florida or any

[01:23:09.420 --> 01:23:11.840]
play-sense. Just a little word of warning, okay?

[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.500]
From some federal tub, who knows, which being me?

[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.960]
21 before 11 at 5, 60 WQM, I cannot believe that brand

[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.260]
issues will be celebrating the 25th year in business this

[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:24.920]
year, but they are. Any independent family, shoe store

[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.060]
at any market that sticks around at longs got to be doing a

[01:23:27.060 --> 01:23:29.080]
lot of things right, and they are brand-eats. They continue

[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:31.280]
having more and more people come in over and over again

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.980]
because you can't beat their deals and their service and

[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.420]
their selection too. They offer you the top brands in the

[01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:38.000]
shoe business. They got rock ports, echoes, Mephisto,

[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.880]
Timberland Clarks, SAS floor shim and lots more, and whatever

[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.720]
size you got a teeny tiny foot, you got a hard to fit big

[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:46.960]
fat one and a foot too. They got men size of 6 to 15, women

[01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:49.820]
5 to 12, and width from the very, very narrow to the very

[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:53.100]
wide, like a platypus foot. And don't forget their professional

[01:23:53.100 --> 01:23:55.320]
sales staff, no speed inside and out, they'll make sure you get a

[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:58.760]
perfect fit every time. And with over 40,000 parents stocking

[01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.580]
their 8,000 square foot megastore, you can bet, get these

[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.540]
life on it that they got exactly the period you're looking for

[01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:06.340]
in the size you need. So treat your feet right at brand-eats.

I am the local, this is 560, the radio's on your town.

[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:28.500]
QAM.

[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:35.980]
It's time for the W-U-A-M beauty and the Beast Contest.

[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:03.960]
Let's meet our Beast Judges, start him with the illustrious

[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.740]
and the winner is Betz-Lorette number one.

[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:11.840]
Okay, Beast. I am the Beast.

[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:14.900]
You're a little toyed behind that curtain as you think.

[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.120]
Is it going to be Betz-Lorette number one or Betz-Lorette number one?

[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:19.880]
Let me say number one.

[01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.380]
I had figures, he can't think we're all that fat, you hear?

[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.280]
Wait a minute, oh you're only a part of me. Give me a minute here.

[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:28.260]
I can't think, I... number one.

[01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:32.580]
Take up your mind, move your feet up, move your feet up.

[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:35.080]
All right, Beast, meet your mystery date.

[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:38.480]
Sport hole radio program director, Clarence.

[01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.520]
I was hoping you'd pick me.

[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.440]
Well, I always thought you were trying to cute.

[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.980]
Maybe later we can talk about sports, you said sports.

[01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.440]
Stop it, Clarence.

[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.480]
I am the Beast and you're mining my arm.

[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:52.140]
Stop it.

[01:25:52.260 --> 01:25:53.900]
All right, you two more than heads like it all.

[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:54.920]
Get in the back of your head.

[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:55.500]
What formal?

[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:57.500]
Grasio, one, you moron.

[01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.520]
Now my guts are to escort you son and date to the crazy horsey horse stripping.

[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:02.980]
Here we are, kids.

[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:04.440]
Go ahead, I got time.

[01:26:04.660 --> 01:26:05.900]
Hey, switch off the brawl.

[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.240]
It's a cake, club ball.

[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.220]
And the mother, it looks like a Hollywood's anneal.

[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.280]
Is the meals audience?

[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.740]
Ah, that, that, backstab and ice mug up.

[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:13.280]
What the?

[01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:13.800]
Sport.

[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.920]
I can't hear you, use it to that.

[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:16.460]
What was that?

[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.140]
Sport.

[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:17.780]
What?

[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.340]
I said sports.

[01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:20.420]
Sports.

[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:23.360]
Oh, I don't know what it is.

[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:28.320]
Sport.

[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:29.180]
Sport.

[01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:31.720]
Sport.

[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:32.240]

[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:32.340]

[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:32.340]

[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:32.340]

[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:40.980]
Sport.

[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:41.160]

[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:41.160]

[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:41.160]

[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:41.280]
Sport.

[01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:41.580]

[01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:42.380]

[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:42.800]

[01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:42.800]

[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:42.860]

[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:42.860]

[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:42.860]

[01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:42.860]

[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:44.580]
1044-560 WM.

[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:48.020]
How'd you like to do a little free Tony Burr thing I dropped in line there?

[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:48.840]
Is that what that was?

[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.600]
That's all Tony's saying these days.

[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:55.800]
He's kind of embarrassed by the last month or two that's all you see.

[01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.200]
Theater of the sea.

[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.060]
I don't even know what that is somebody should be either.

[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.480]
Theater of the sea?

[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.660]
Never heard of it.

[01:27:01.860 --> 01:27:02.600]
It says it sucks.

[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:03.540]
Should we put that on it?

[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:04.700]
Do we know there's really such a place?

[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:05.440]
Theater of the sea?

[01:27:06.900 --> 01:27:08.560]
Oh, I'm just going to hold that one off to the side.

[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:08.920]
Okay.

[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:10.320]
Hold it until somebody can verify.

[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:13.040]
Somebody who hates the monkey jungle says the monkey jungle.

[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.380]
I'm not going to repeat what the rest of it says.

[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.940]
Oh, that's, that has been a big story over the years down here about that gorilla.

[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.400]
About the gorilla they've kept in solitude for 30 years.

[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.200]
I'm not going to say that.

[01:27:21.700 --> 01:27:23.440]
But anyway Steve hates the monkey jungle.

[01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:25.040]
We're going to put that on a list monkey jungle.

[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:25.360]
We got it.

[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.440]
That's the owner boy trained monkey jungle.

[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.380]
That's right.

[01:27:29.440 --> 01:27:30.740]
That's where they keep most of our audience.

[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.740]
What the hell was that?

[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:34.260]
Well, I said this day.

[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:35.940]
Did you hear that?

[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:37.220]
Yeah.

[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.060]
Well, that's because I had an on cue and on here.

[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.080]
That's like a double double.

[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.500]
Let me try that one more time.

[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:42.960]
I like that.

[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:44.840]
Oh, that was good.

[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:50.040]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.

[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.920]
One million pounds for Neil Rogers.

[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.180]
He's in the his out in Verizon Wireless line.

[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.020]
WDQ I am.

[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:58.300]
Hello?

[01:27:58.680 --> 01:27:58.680]

[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.460]
Hey Neil, how's it going?

[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:01.060]
Okay.

[01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:02.260]
I have one to the list here.

[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:04.880]
Uh, pompe and opeer.

[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:06.400]
The pompe and opeer?

[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:11.440]
Yeah, the fisherman's war if I didn't want to say the name, but it's just, it's.

[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.140]
What does it really call?

[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:13.880]
Fisherman's war?

[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:16.280]
Well, that's the restaurant right at the pier.

[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:17.680]
But just that whole little spot.

[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:18.980]
It's definitely the armpit.

[01:28:18.980 --> 01:28:20.020]
Pomp and opeer.

[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:20.440]
We got it.

[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:20.660]
Okay.

[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.180]
Thank you, sir.

[01:28:21.300 --> 01:28:21.800]
Thank you.

[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:23.360]
Let's go there and take a long walkoff.

[01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:29.280]
For short, worth 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless line.

[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:31.180]
Little Havana's just moved in the lead, George.

[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:31.980]
Oh, is it?

[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.080]
Can't imagine why.

[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.640]
I think there's kind of a turning point in everybody's life today.

[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.160]
You know, we finally got Toronto off that list.

[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:42.220]
The sun is shining here.

[01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:43.720]
We had that great book.

[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:44.520]
Let's do it again.

[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.520]
Let's give those numbers again.

[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.000]
Speaking of numbers, where the hell is muff?

[01:28:47.660 --> 01:28:49.220]
What is that girl doing, huh?

[01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:52.640]
Is she back into the door knobs again?

[01:28:53.700 --> 01:28:56.900]
Probably on his way to come in there, but keeps banging into the door knobs on a way to the hallway.

[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.600]
Come on, my, let's have those damn numbers.

[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.280]
They're requiring minds 1 and 0.

[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.500]
How about 9 to 10 hour turn out?

[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.160]
How did the noon to 1 hour turn out?

[01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:06.900]
I bet you all those right wingers are hyperventilating.

[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:11.100]
God forbid that we actually beat Lardass again, which we just about always do and have for many, many years.

[01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:15.780]
Remember that one, Simmons, about, oh, there's no way that Neil Rogers could beat Rush Limbaugh.

[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.260]
Right.

[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.360]
This after about 15 years, right of doing it every hour and every year book.

[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:21.340]
No way.

[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:24.000]
Somebody QAM?

[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:27.600]
Hey, you should put on the polis, Jimbo.

[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:29.220]
Jimbo's?

[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:33.460]
Yeah, Jimbo's that little shrimp place by on Virginia key.

[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:35.580]
That's a tourist place?

[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:36.280]
Yeah.

[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:36.960]
Okay, great.

[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:41.460]
Well, when we put Alabama jacks on there while we're at it.

[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.020]
There you go.

[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:42.780]
How about the shorties?

[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.620]
The Burger King of 40th and 87th.

[01:29:45.620 --> 01:29:46.320]
That's a good one.

[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.320]
The stay away from there.

[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:49.820]
Oh, man, don't want to go there.

[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:50.420]
No way.

[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:51.260]
No, how?

[01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:53.160]
I'm not going to put up a billboard.

[01:29:53.260 --> 01:29:54.100]
Stay away from that one.

[01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:58.340]
567-0560, pound 560.

[01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.300]
I love the way the audience reacts to the poll question.

[01:30:01.380 --> 01:30:03.420]
Anybody that knocks our poll, man, you don't know your poll.

[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.960]
Because no matter what the question is, it's always something else with about 50% of this audience.

[01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:11.540]
I wonder what Tony Blair would say about it.

[01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.460]
Yeah, probably.

[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:15.180]
W-Q-I-M.

[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:16.980]
A-L-A.

[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:17.400]
Yes, sir.

[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:18.820]
Hey, can I talk to Neil?

[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:19.520]
Speaking.

[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:21.040]
Hey, Neil, how's it going?

[01:30:21.260 --> 01:30:23.540]
First off, the theater of the seat definitely blows.

[01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:25.160]
There is such a place.

[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:25.700]
What is it?

[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:30.580]
It's like the seagrass and it's down near Holiday Island in the Keys.

[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:32.740]
Okay, it's on our list.

[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.680]
And I don't know if anybody said it because I just tuned in.

[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.980]
I'm just catching up here.

[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.120]
Is there coral castle, I think?

[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:41.600]
Coral castle?

[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:49.120]
Yeah, and now like that place, if you built it, it's down on Bixie.

[01:30:49.820 --> 01:30:51.140]
Yeah, I know Bixie.

[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.500]
I mean, down on Bixie too.

[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.200]
And it's on the way to Keys.

[01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:56.060]
And it's touched?

[01:30:56.780 --> 01:31:04.680]
And homestead and it's, I don't know, some guy built it for some lady to make some castle for, but she never showed up.

[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:05.520]
I'll be back.

[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.740]
Okay, we got you down, man.

[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:07.500]
Thanks, everybody.

[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:08.980]
It's a curiosity.

[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:13.300]
Coral castle, you used to take field trips there in school to do what?

[01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:14.780]
It's a curiosity.

[01:31:15.020 --> 01:31:17.740]
One little guy like four feet tall, built it all with his bare hands.

[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:21.840]
Oh, what's another place in Miami that the Veskaya didn't they?

[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:22.820]
Yeah, down or something?

[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.800]
No, it's still there.

[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:24.880]
Still there Veskaya?

[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:25.280]
Yeah.

[01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.260]
What the hell is anybody want to go there for?

[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:28.220]
Right there.

[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:29.260]
Huh?

[01:31:30.220 --> 01:31:30.500]
Weddings?

[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:32.780]
Veskaya, put that down on list two.

[01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:34.900]
Okay, because they're always making a big semi-sub-ab Veskaya.

[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:37.960]
See, really when you come right down to it, what the hell is there to see?

[01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.420]
Is there like a really great museum?

[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:39.680]
No.

[01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.520]
Seriously, what is there to see?

[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:43.940]
See this?

[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.820]
I do see that.

[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.300]
We're going to put Coral Castle on?

[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:47.980]
Yeah.

[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.080]
Coral, what do you mean?

[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.460]
Are we going to put on theater or the sea?

[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:52.780]
Pop and O'pear and Coral Castle and Veskaya.

[01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:53.580]
That's like this for you.

[01:31:53.660 --> 01:31:54.480]
Better move fast, man.

[01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:59.920]
Don't forget we got a short show today to only know when we have our big noon to one Wednesday comedy bits are, that I'm salivating waiting for.

[01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:03.860]
In fact, I'm thinking the whole hour just playing my favorite new bit that I was going to.

[01:32:03.860 --> 01:32:08.760]
I don't understand what I can't find what this disc is really all about where it's from.

[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:11.160]
It's just a disc from hell, I guess.

[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:15.220]
But it sure brought us tremendous amount of entertainment and enjoyment.

[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:17.800]
That you couldn't get for a twice the price.

[01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:23.660]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Horizon Wireless Line.

[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.580]
What Florida tourist destination would you tell your honest state friends to avoid?

[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:29.420]
Little Havana 48.

[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:32.000]
Song Rasmills Mall 40.

[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.360]

The Swap Shop 15.

Key West 14.

[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.700]
Disney World 13.

[01:32:41.100 --> 01:32:42.260]
The Mika in Yine.

[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.060]
The Marlins Games 8.

[01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:46.760]
C Quarium 7.

[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:47.740]
Bayside 5.

[01:32:47.880 --> 01:32:48.540]
Bush Gardens 2.

[01:32:48.860 --> 01:32:52.160]
And no votes yet, although I guess they just went up for Metro Zoo or Line Countries to Fairy.

[01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:53.940]
And the other ones are going on the other four.

[01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:54.940]
Florida, we just mentioned.

[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:57.260]
Oh yeah, let's go to the sky, man.

[01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:57.920]
It's going to be great.

[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:01.220]
Well, what's the place Johnny Versace is a place?

[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.040]
What is that called?

[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.540]
I don't know, Gay House.

[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:06.260]
House of a dead guy?

[01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:06.520]

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.060]
Oh, doesn't that place have a name?

[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.340]
Dead Fagria States.

[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:10.860]
I don't know.

[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:12.800]
It's most of like Chinese.

[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:15.120]
WQAM.

[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:16.900]
Neil, good morning.

[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:17.880]
Good morning, too.

[01:33:17.940 --> 01:33:19.260]
Main Petersburg calling you.

[01:33:19.820 --> 01:33:21.060]
How about adding to the list?

[01:33:21.100 --> 01:33:22.560]
I already made my vote for Key West.

[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:27.900]
But how about adding to the list any major league baseball franchise in the state of Florida?

[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.380]
Well, we got the Marlins.

[01:33:30.520 --> 01:33:32.920]
We got the Marlins, we got the Ray Demo-Rays up here.

[01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.080]
Well, the Demo-Rays aren't like a real major league franchise.

[01:33:35.240 --> 01:33:37.440]
Well, yeah, they're not, almost minor league, almost.

[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:40.060]
Okay, thanks.

[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:40.380]
Thanks.

[01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:40.480]
Thank you.

[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:42.280]
Okay, you're right.

[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.980]
Baseball sucks, and nobody cares about it in Florida.

[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:45.380]
And Spider-Man, it's spring training stuff.

[01:33:45.480 --> 01:33:48.000]
What they see, what they don't understand, is all the spring training.

[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:51.680]
First of all, they play a little tiny ballpark, and a few thousand people fills it up.

[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:55.920]
And the teams that play there aren't like the Yankees and the Orioles.

[01:33:55.920 --> 01:33:59.240]
The teams from up north and the fans of those teams that are ones that went and saw them.

[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.500]
Is what that was all about.

[01:34:01.240 --> 01:34:04.020]
But the idea that baseball being played in the summertime is,

[01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:08.040]
opposed to spring training when there's still people in South Florida, uh, forget about it.

[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.640]
Tampa, what's their excuse?

[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:13.840]
I don't know what their excuse is, because the lightning still survived there.

[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:15.000]
How about those lightning, baby?

[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.100]
They're still alive.

[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.960]
They want to game the other day against the devils.

[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:18.580]
They're still alive.

[01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:19.480]
They're hanging on.

[01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.420]
But I just, uh, for whatever reason.

[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.060]
And like I said, the summertime, it's 100 degrees in the shade.

[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:26.860]
It's hotter than hell.

[01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.840]
Uh, there's nobody in town anyway.

[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:32.460]
Once Passover and Easter are done, everybody's gone.

[01:34:32.540 --> 01:34:33.600]
Everybody can get the hell out.

[01:34:33.700 --> 01:34:34.140]
It gets out.

[01:34:34.260 --> 01:34:35.580]
When in doubt, they fly the hell out.

[01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:40.580]
Because if it's not 100 degrees in the shade, it's raining and storming and nasty and cloudy.

[01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:43.620]
It's the one or the other from what we just say, like, uh,

[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:46.440]
the fruit from like the middle of April till, uh, what, November.

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:47.380]
The whole Christmas.

[01:34:47.700 --> 01:34:47.800]
Right.

[01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:53.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line.

[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:53.960]
WQA, hello.

[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:54.980]
How you doing?

[01:34:55.460 --> 01:34:55.640]
Good.

[01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:56.740]
The Everglades.

[01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.620]
The Everglades?

[01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.240]
Mm-hmm.

[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:00.360]
Yeah, that's pretty exciting.

[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:01.240]
Okay.

[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.260]
Okay, thank you.

[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:03.440]
Everglades.

[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:04.960]
Do people really go out to see the Everglades?

[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:05.740]
I guess they do.

[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:06.840]
Huh? Sure they do.

[01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:07.640]
And what do they see there?

[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.140]
Oh, that's right.

[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.520]
They go out and there's a little one of the colors, the airboats.

[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.400]
It's a airboats.

[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.280]
It's a freaking national park.

[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:13.420]
Oh, come on.

[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.440]
It's half the freaking state.

[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:16.300]
No, I understand that.

[01:35:16.300 --> 01:35:18.580]
It's a gigantic swamp is what the state is.

[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:18.760]
Right.

[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:21.120]
They got egress and cranes and gators.

[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:21.800]
You have egress?

[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:23.780]
Agers?

[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:24.040]
Agers?

[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.080]
Do you know, I was sitting out eating some street meat.

[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.820]
One of my Italian sausages the other day.

[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:31.980]
And I was sitting like on a stump.

[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:32.880]
You know what I mean?

[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:33.620]
All right.

[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:39.380]
No, and what happens is, because I do the Atkins kind of a thing when I have either a hamburger or a hotdog.

[01:35:39.660 --> 01:35:40.260]
I don't eat the bun.

[01:35:42.060 --> 01:35:42.420]
Okay.

[01:35:42.420 --> 01:35:44.340]
And so the birds come around.

[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:47.080]
And they sniff around.

[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.880]
They suck around and take a little piece of bread and throw it in the spirals.

[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:50.160]
He didn't.

[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:50.780]
And then the bigger bird.

[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.680]
Then the big bird start coming around.

[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:56.080]
And then there was a black squirrel that came and took a close look.

[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:59.160]
Now, black squirrel, have you ever seen a black squirrel?

[01:35:59.300 --> 01:35:59.420]
Yeah.

[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.840]
They're beautiful animals.

[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:04.080]
Well, the squirrels are dangerous because a lot of them have a rabbi.

[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.180]
Three rodents.

[01:36:05.900 --> 01:36:06.080]
Right.

[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:07.120]
But they are pretty.

[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:09.880]
And I gave them kind of a dirty look and he hauled ass.

[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:15.280]
And then speaking of egress, then the big, they're not egress or seagulls, I guess, huh?

[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:15.980]
You know what they are?

[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:16.420]
Mm-hmm.

[01:36:16.740 --> 01:36:18.960]
A lot of seagulls here that fly over Lake Ontario.

[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:20.260]
And then they start sucking around.

[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:23.940]
It's really interesting that the smaller birds, the sparrows come in the beginning.

[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:27.060]
And then the bigger, you know, they push all the little ones out of the way.

[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.100]
Well, you're probably used to that.

[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:31.480]
WDQA and hello.

[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:32.280]
Neil.

[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:36.220]
Hey, all this government bashing sounds like Danny and Jimmy.

[01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:37.200]
Jimmy and Danny.

[01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.600]
What are we going to finish this?

[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:39.640]
The worst over time.

[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:39.820]
What?

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:40.880]
Finish what?

[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:42.200]
This government bashing.

[01:36:42.480 --> 01:36:43.700]
What are you talking about governments here?

[01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.380]
What the hell are you talking about?

[01:36:44.380 --> 01:36:46.480]
You're about to use government, that's your, that's your, that's your, that's your.

[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:47.280]
The screw on my new two, okay?

[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:49.080]
Put them in the same damn banana boat and get lost.

[01:36:49.940 --> 01:36:51.360]
5'6'7'0, 5'6'8'0.

[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:53.340]
We're doing the show mainly about what we're talking to pull out red.

[01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:55.160]
One article there that this guy can't handle.

[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:58.180]
Maybe you'd like to have one company own all the radio stations, okay, sir.

[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.980]
So you wouldn't be able to call and talk to anybody.

[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.800]
All the calls will be on tape.

[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.040]
They'll all be piped in from people who are just saying,

[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:06.620]
Ditto, Ditto, Ditto, Echo, Echo, Echo.

[01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:07.940]
Maybe that's what you would like.

[01:37:08.100 --> 01:37:10.680]
You moron, you simple to knew, you idiot.

[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:12.720]
And by the way, what time is the ball game start?

[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:15.480]
How about you QIM?

[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:19.100]
Hey Neil, I went to that Lion Code you saw like two weeks ago.

[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:19.520]
Yeah.

[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:23.700]
And when you first get there to give you a CD so you're all impressed and you drive around.

[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.020]
You see a bunch of birds and frogs and whatever.

[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:29.140]
And you know how many lions are actually in the place?

[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.120]
The whole set up.

[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.800]
I mean, couldn't you smell them in a million miles away?

[01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:36.060]
You could smell it.

[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:37.260]
It must have been from the eagre.

[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:39.900]
It must have been smell like eagre, throughout things to me.

[01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.360]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:45.060]
This guy just like Greg, you know running around just like little parrots

[01:37:45.060 --> 01:37:45.800]
beginning to the parrots younger.

[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:46.700]
That's what we got out there.

[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.800]
The American public are pirates.

[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:51.540]
I say something on here, then they're saying it about 30 man, about 30 man, you know.

[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.500]
Or maybe it's like, what whatever it is, it doesn't make any difference.

[01:37:57.080 --> 01:37:57.380]
Right?

[01:37:57.780 --> 01:37:57.880]
Right.

[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.960]
How many times, over the years, in fact, that's a good pull question.

[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:05.580]
What expression was you heard on the arrived show was your favorite?

[01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:06.840]
I'm dying out of here.

[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:10.020]
Right, which I mean, we didn't originate that, but that drop in was a real collar

[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:10.580]
who's dead.

[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:11.220]
Sure, unfortunately.

[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:12.080]

[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:12.600]

[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:14.400]
That's an excellent pull.

[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:15.260]
Don't you think?

[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:15.960]
I do.

[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:17.580]
What's your favorite expression?

[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:20.000]
Anyway, something, something to chew on.

[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:21.380]
Right back down so we don't forget it.

[01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:23.780]
10, 56, 5, 60.

[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.200]
Who on the mad dog at one?

[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:27.400]
Joseph Gackie for the hopper at 3 to 7.

[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.340]
I've known Hank's busy punching on the pick 4 and a pick 6 and pick this.

[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.060]
Hey, olio mitzoth, Joseph.

[01:38:32.180 --> 01:38:33.900]
I'm still waiting for my olio mitz by the way, Skippy.

[01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.080]
I just mentioned that and I have the phone.

[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:38.560]
Did ring this morning, which means he's got some CDs waiting for me down there.

[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:41.380]
Hopefully CDs that don't sound like that, like that.

[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:43.920]
And naming my olio mitz here too.

[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:45.680]
I'm Jones and fork as I'm almost out.

[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:49.020]
And I'm looking forward to continuing to take olio mitz for my blood pressure

[01:38:49.020 --> 01:38:51.840]
because it's really doing wonders and it can do the same for you and a lot of your health needs.

[01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:55.940]
Olio mitz contains the best olive oil that money can find, not just ordinary olive oil,

[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:59.060]

They are nervous folks, very nervous, which they have every reason to be given.

[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:28.940]
We're sitting in Bloomingthaw violently, still giving his past bravery, and standing up to the right wing, Burbupagans, and the media horror is given that all he probably knows and gives his brilliance as a writer and reporter.

[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:36.400]
Even Miss Sludge, who had yet read a word on the book, but reports on it anyway, let's let the Bloomingthaw's book is detailed and written authoritatively.

[01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:44.920]
A good guest given that the Clinton Wars is nearly 600 pages long, and given that if anybody's got the facts to explode the lines of what happened five years ago, it is sitting in Bloomingthaw.

[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:51.560]
Now, where's the release date on this? I don't see that. I don't see it either looking.

[01:45:52.180 --> 01:46:01.260]
We can find out online, huh? You can buy it online. That's what this thing is. It's this order in advance copy of the city Bloomingthaw's The Clinton Wars at 30% off with the print.

[01:46:01.460 --> 01:46:06.420]
You might not just go to Amazon.com. That's the easiest way and you'll find that on the room and tell you what the release date is.

[01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:14.160]
560560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. WQAM. Hello.

[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:16.820]
Wishing lunch, fellow lunch, fellow.

[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:19.780]
WQAM. Hello.

[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:20.920]
Hi, Neil.

[01:46:21.300 --> 01:46:25.020]
Yes, sir. Just an addition to your list if you don't already have it.

[01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:27.780]
Oh, yeah. Jungle Queen Cruise.

[01:46:28.500 --> 01:46:29.280]
Jungle Queen.

[01:46:30.500 --> 01:46:32.280]
Operates out of Waterdale.

[01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:33.500]
I've heard of that.

[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:42.440]
Yeah, it takes you to the Seminole Indian Village with the fat Seminole's Russell, the old drug alligator.

[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:47.140]
I hear that's where a D-Fo wrestles with this conscience. That's what I'm hearing.

[01:46:47.520 --> 01:46:48.540]
Okay, thanks a lot. We got it down.

[01:46:48.560 --> 01:46:48.640]
Yeah.

[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:49.660]
Thank you.

[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:51.880]
Jungle Queen. You got it. Beenervoy. We got it.

[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:52.440]
Get it.

[01:46:52.720 --> 01:46:58.200]
Don't forget to join George, Miguel, Bokobrine, and Beenervoy today. Happy our five-seven at Treasure Island located right off the Palmetto.

[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:01.220]
Just north of the 120-second street exit. Stop out of wind.

[01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:03.420]
Some of our usual very low-budget QAM prizes.

[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:06.660]
And enjoy drinks, specials while you're there. And maybe you'll get lucky too.

[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:09.720]
Maybe a Bokobrine will take a shine to you. Or at least his head will.

[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.940]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound, five, sixty on the eight. Is he there yet?

[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:15.460]
No.

[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:17.920]
That's right. He don't show up till like next hour.

[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:18.680]
Next hour. Right.

[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.660]
Well, when he gets there, it's gotta be my fault.

[01:47:22.800 --> 01:47:24.560]
I have to have the wrong disc and the wrong one of these things.

[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:26.760]
But it's really interesting to hear.

[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:29.180]
That.

[01:47:30.500 --> 01:47:32.240]
Maybe it's a bit and we just don't know yet.

[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:33.500]
WDQAM.

[01:47:35.540 --> 01:47:36.860]
Doggy line QAM. Hello.

[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:39.800]
May 20th.

[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:41.260]
May 20th. The book has been released.

[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:43.940]
Like I said about a month. Just a hair under a month.

[01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:46.180]
I'm ordering me like several advanced copies.

[01:47:47.380 --> 01:47:51.120]
I wonder if it talks an air about the Mac Grudge sending George Flowers roses.

[01:47:53.140 --> 01:47:53.540]
WDQAM.

[01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:56.360]
QAM.

[01:47:57.740 --> 01:47:58.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.540]
Hey, yeah, where it's safe up then.

[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:06.040]
It's raining pretty hard. I've got to get my hands on it in the wheel too.

[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.940]
Yeah, but the reason I was caught was watching Bill Marl last night.

[01:48:10.100 --> 01:48:10.600]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.340]
Yeah, I had all the crap there.

[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:17.700]
And it showed one thing, you know, stuck out that you said that, you know,

[01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.620]
if it wasn't for the Democrats, everybody was coming at tack us because of the craziness

[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:25.280]
this guy is doing, you know, this Joe Bush guy.

[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:26.420]
Joe Bush, yeah.

[01:48:26.860 --> 01:48:30.020]
Yeah, yeah, but, you know, there was one black kid on his.

[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:36.140]
He's saying the same thing that, you know, you said a few times that, you know,

[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:40.580]
that, you know, the trying to impose all this right wing stuff on everybody

[01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:45.440]
and the rest of the world doesn't do what they do, and they're wrong and all that crap.

[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:47.520]
I was against that, maybe the good guys in the bad guys.

[01:48:47.700 --> 01:48:49.260]
It's the Cowboys and Indians all over again.

[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:53.320]
And said, Wild West, GW Bush, my teller, to give me that 10 gallon hat and my six shooter.

[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:55.080]
And let's go out and take over the world.

[01:48:55.100 --> 01:48:56.480]
You're either West or Augustus.

[01:48:57.700 --> 01:49:01.640]
Yeah, this thing that they're doing is business of well, what kind of pressure can we bring?

[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:03.940]
How can we penalize those people that go along with them?

[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.380]
Whoever heard us such a thing, it's kind of like, well, the thing with them,

[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:09.400]
it's kind of like what I was just talking about with the media.

[01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:13.280]
We're all supposed to have the same opinion as them, and if we don't, then we're the enemy.

[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:17.320]
We're all supposed to have the same opinion as Limbaugh and O'Reilly and all these other right wing assholes

[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:20.380]
and Sean Hannity, and if we don't, then we're the bad guys.

[01:49:21.460 --> 01:49:25.880]
Whoever heard us such crap, and this is what we're exporting to Iraq or anyplace else in the world,

[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:30.500]
this is our idea of democracy that we want to export, like the column I read before,

[01:49:30.920 --> 01:49:34.560]
said, why don't we start doing it at home first before we try exporting it?

[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:35.780]
Let's get it right at home.

[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:39.480]
Operation American Freedom, that's the one I want to start seeing.

[01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:46.000]
Oh, and speaking of that, I don't want the whole hour to slip away without just mentioning.

[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:47.200]
No one will read it.

[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:50.480]
City Council, because more and more of these cities are voting on this,

[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:53.720]
City Council votes to consider joining opposition to Federal Patriot Act.

[01:49:54.180 --> 01:49:56.560]
This is in the Arizona Daily Star about Tucson, Arizona.

[01:49:57.260 --> 01:50:05.140]
It says Tucson could be the latest city of question the USA Patriot Act passed by Congress in 2001 that expands the ability of law enforcement to track and trap terrorists.

[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.000]
The Council voted Monday, four to three along a party line split Republican Mayor Bob Walkup and Council members,

[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.860]
Kathleen Dunbar and Fred Ronstett opposed to decide in May whether to join some 83 other cities across the country,

[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.140]
and expressing concerns over whether the zeal to catch terrorists has overridden civil liberties,

[01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:23.480]
which of course is absolutely correct.

[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.480]
How do you like that?

[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:30.620]
Council member Steve Leal, a Democrat who brought the issue to colleagues at the prompting of a loose coalition of civil libertarians in Tucson,

[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:35.360]
said the great irony of the act is that in trying to strengthen the country, the road's core values.

[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:41.080]
The pay-peed act may create a systematic, systematic climate of fear by dividing Americans, Leal,

[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:45.000]
said among the concerns he cited, the act allows wiretaps without probable cause,

[01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:49.380]
and allows monitoring of religious organizations whether there's any indication of criminal activity or not.

[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:54.780]
It's kind of that business about, we think you're going to do something illegal, and don't mess with us.

[01:50:55.640 --> 01:51:00.060]
We'll listen in, we'll watch in, we'll check with VNOTA Unice, and we'll do whatever the hell we want.

[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:06.100]
Sounds like fascism to me, I could be wrong on that, that sounds an awful lot like creeping fascism.

[01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:08.640]
Wonder what Tony Blair thinks about that.

[01:51:10.860 --> 01:51:16.040]
5667-0560-0.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line, 12 minutes past 11 a.k.w.am.

[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:19.560]
If you're in a dead end job, if you're just at the end of the road,

[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.260]
if you just can't get two nickels to rub together like poor Beenerboy,

[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:28.020]
the answer for you is you get yourself some training and get you in a great new high-paying computer job.

[01:51:28.020 --> 01:51:31.040]
Call fast train, they'll get you the training in even just four short months,

[01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:34.420]
and you can really say goodbye, say go to hell to your crappy boss, okay?

[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:36.460]
Tell them to drop dead, stick it.

[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:40.040]
Flip them to the bird and just walk out that door with your chest,

[01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:43.760]
puffed up like a peacock, and head for a great new job.

[01:51:44.020 --> 01:51:48.640]
Call fast train 1-866-FAST train, they offer you convenient day-evening weekend classes,

[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.680]
and they got locations all over town so it is bound to be one year by you.

[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:54.080]

[01:52:11.940 --> 01:52:13.860]
You see my pen, Lord?

[01:52:14.540 --> 01:52:16.120]
This is sports radio classic?

[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:17.680]
You way up.

[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:20.380]
This is Ward!

[01:52:20.620 --> 01:52:21.440]
Not as pedophile?

[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:40.160]
Well, I just heard the news today.

[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.080]
I asked you out.

[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:47.300]
You said no way.

[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:51.060]
The weekends here.

[01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:54.260]
I'm all alone.

[01:52:55.460 --> 01:52:57.660]
I'm morning now.

[01:52:59.300 --> 01:53:04.000]
And grab my phone with home, I don't feel.

[01:53:04.900 --> 01:53:10.740]
And then I close it up and down.

[01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:17.600]
Routine, thank God for fasts of leading with home, I don't feel.

[01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.780]
I'm 14 at 560 W.A.C.Y.M.

[01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:23.560]
This is kind of cute.

[01:53:23.700 --> 01:53:27.620]
The Roman Catholic Church in Keto Ecuador suspended a fugitive priest with that budget.

[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:36.200]
A fugitive priest on Tuesday after he was accused of leading a corruption ring at a local customs office, the Custa Country 10 million bucks.

[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.600]
The Reverend Carlos Forase, who was named head of Keto's customs office, as part of an anti-corruption drive in 2000,

[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:48.660]
due to his honest reputation in political connections, has been missing since last week when police sought to detain him for his alleged role in a corruption ring.

[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:51.600]
And it goes on with all the glory details.

[01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:58.020]
A Belgian lawyer is planning to press ahead with the war crimes lawsuit against US General Tommy Franks, despite American anger.

[01:53:58.460 --> 01:54:03.400]
The suit brought by 19 Iraqis accused the general Franks of war crimes during the Iraqi conflict.

[01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:11.080]
Lawyer Jan Ferman, who's acting on behalf of the Iraqis, described a plaintiff's victims of cluster bombs and a US attacks on ambulances and civilians.

[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:16.500]
We have a very specific case with specific evidence Mr. Ferman said, I don't see how they can reject it.

[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:22.200]
The case will be presented in court on May 13, including evidence which have been gathered by Belgian doctors working in Baghdad.

[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:28.220]
Mr. Ferman said there were 17 specific incidents in which US soldiers and commanders had violated the law.

[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.100]
Oh, that's got to be a mistake, I'm sure.

[01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:34.460]
I think we just had bad aim like that Chinese embassy we bombed that time.

[01:54:34.460 --> 01:54:41.160]
We just every now and then have bad name, friendly fire, a fairly friendly fire, hostile fire, etc. All of these things.

[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:43.660]
Which Florida tourist destination?

[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:47.460]
Would you tell your friends out of state friends to avoid?

[01:54:47.820 --> 01:54:49.720]
That's our poll question at any of Rogers.com.

[01:54:49.980 --> 01:54:52.060]
We got down near 300 votes, 291.

[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:54.960]
Beanerboy is impressed by that.

[01:54:56.680 --> 01:54:59.860]
Always not impressed by the fact that she's a little Havana, 76.

[01:55:00.340 --> 01:55:03.660]
See, we could have put Kaya Ocho, but that's such a short term thing, you know.

[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:03.980]
Right.

[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:09.160]
As opposed to like little Havana in general, which I'm sure is considered to be a tourist destination, right?

[01:55:09.160 --> 01:55:13.940]
I guess for people most speaking English, people want to see Meris Grisi as his house.

[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.940]
Want to see this 10-year-old kid, 19-year-old kid, she married?

[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:19.200]
A little Havana, 76.

[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:20.120]
How old was he, 19?

[01:55:20.260 --> 01:55:21.120]
Well, let's take a look at him.

[01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:22.060]
Let's see what he does look like.

[01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:23.300]
Maybe he's got a...

[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:23.600]
Bracko!

[01:55:23.700 --> 01:55:25.760]
Even better than Tom Swallowing last night on...

[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:26.660]
...Saugrass.

[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.560]
I mean, on the...

[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.160]
That's not real.

[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.420]
Now, it was a good show.

[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:31.220]
It was a very good show.

[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:31.540]
All the way.

[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.720]
I have to wonder how come there's so much kryptonite floating around.

[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.240]
I know they had that meteor shower.

[01:55:36.540 --> 01:55:36.860]
Scads.

[01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:39.660]
Are we going to get to see Tom Wally take a meteor shower?

[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:42.340]
I'd be impressed with that.

[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:43.920]
Because we didn't see much last night.

[01:55:44.020 --> 01:55:44.580]
And spread it out.

[01:55:44.860 --> 01:55:47.400]
Breathless, hypervading, and some really desperate queens.

[01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:48.680]
I mean desperate people out there.

[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.160]
We're going to get to see Tom Wally's ass.

[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:52.440]
You know, like that.

[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:55.580]
I mean, anybody get excited about what they showed there last night.

[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:58.820]
Has really, really got a serious problem.

[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:02.340]
Desperately needs to get that search party and find a life.

[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:03.860]
Find something alive to touch.

[01:56:05.020 --> 01:56:06.180]
That's not connected already.

[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:08.240]
Little Havana 76,

[01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:09.900]
Sogras Mills Mall 50,

[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:12.880]
Joe Stonecrab's 34,

[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:14.380]
a very respectable third place,

[01:56:15.700 --> 01:56:16.480]
overpriced, overrated.

[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:18.240]
I've never been there, but everybody tells me that.

[01:56:18.420 --> 01:56:19.240]
Everybody in the other.

[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:20.360]
Because I don't like stonecrab.

[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:21.200]
So why would I go there?

[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.940]
Right. Well, they have other food as well.

[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:25.180]
I understand that.

[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:26.080]
But I don't...

[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:28.140]
I'm not going to shmere anybody to go and get in.

[01:56:28.220 --> 01:56:30.020]
I'm not interested in one of those plastic places

[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:31.420]
where you have to know the May to D.

[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:33.280]
I'm just not into that whole scene.

[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:34.900]
They treat people like cattle.

[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:37.280]
What do you mean like the Rascal House,

[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.580]
which is a little ways down the list?

[01:56:39.240 --> 01:56:40.380]
Joe Stonecrab's 34.

[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.080]
Have you been there?

[01:56:41.740 --> 01:56:42.080]
Joe's?

[01:56:42.380 --> 01:56:43.080]
Yeah, twice.

[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:45.080]
And they treat you like cattle?

[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:46.000]
Crap.

[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.100]
Well, who the hell?

[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:47.460]
Who the hell?

[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:49.660]
Nice, but that's only because the guy that I was with

[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.520]
ended up like shmereering the guy, a hundred bucks.

[01:56:51.740 --> 01:56:52.460]
Right, very good.

[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:54.260]
When in doubt, shmere them off.

[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:55.160]
That's the way you do it.

[01:56:57.520 --> 01:56:59.020]
I'll see Swap Drop 23,

[01:56:59.180 --> 01:56:59.920]
Disney World 21,

[01:57:00.100 --> 01:57:00.840]
Rascal House 21,

[01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:01.800]
tied with Disney World.

[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:02.660]
I'll tell you one thing.

[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:04.040]
I sure rather go to the Disney World again.

[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:05.740]
I've been there a many times than the Rascal House.

[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:10.280]
I wouldn't go to the Rascal House if they paid me 50 bucks per bite, you know?

[01:57:11.420 --> 01:57:12.460]
Would you?

[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:13.380]
Would you go eat there?

[01:57:13.780 --> 01:57:14.380]
I've never been there.

[01:57:15.220 --> 01:57:17.540]
You have never been to the Rascal House?

[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:18.360]
No way.

[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.140]
Okay, I'm going to tell you that story again.

[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:22.920]
All right.

[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:26.980]
Key West 19, Marlins Game 18,

[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:28.140]
Mike High 11,

[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:29.340]
Bayside 7,

[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:30.680]
Sequarium 7,

[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:32.160]
Lyoncutter Safari 4,

[01:57:32.160 --> 01:57:33.080]
is that safari.

[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:34.720]
What is it?

[01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:37.060]
Bush Gardens 2 and the Metro Zoo 1,

[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:38.300]
out of 301 vote.

[01:57:39.860 --> 01:57:41.040]
Places to tell your friends

[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:41.980]
who are coming in from out of state.

[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:42.960]
Stay in a hell of a way.

[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:43.280]
Now,

[01:57:44.060 --> 01:57:46.860]
so I'm working 8 to midnight at W.I.N.Z. many years ago, right?

[01:57:47.420 --> 01:57:47.640]
All right.

[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:49.640]
And at midnight, very frequently,

[01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:50.620]
my producer and I,

[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:51.620]
whoever my producer have it,

[01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:52.100]
we have to be at that time.

[01:57:52.180 --> 01:57:52.660]
We'd go eat.

[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.140]
Even at W.S. News,

[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:54.900]
when I did 8 to midnight,

[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:56.720]
see this is one of the reasons that I'm fat,

[01:57:57.140 --> 01:57:58.260]
besides being a fat slum.

[01:57:58.620 --> 01:58:00.000]
But you don't eat at midnight.

[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:00.740]
Not a good idea.

[01:58:00.740 --> 01:58:01.760]
But I've to even work in.

[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:02.360]
I mean, like, yeah.

[01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.000]
Like now.

[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.020]
I work 9 to 1 when I get done with work.

[01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:05.940]
What a clock I go eat.

[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:08.960]
So many, many times we go to

[01:58:08.960 --> 01:58:10.080]
lums or somewhere,

[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:11.020]
like, or wags.

[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:11.660]
I loved wags.

[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:12.960]
I don't care what anybody says.

[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:14.080]
Wags wasn't gourmet,

[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:15.960]
but it was open 24 hours.

[01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:18.880]
And the food was like several levels up from Denny's.

[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:20.380]
It was about 20 levels up from that.

[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.100]
It was just fun.

[01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.700]
So anyway, I had been doing my

[01:58:22.700 --> 01:58:24.580]
hellendale thing and a thing with the old Jews.

[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.560]
It was getting on my case in sunny Rosenberg.

[01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:29.680]
And talking about the rascal house and about the old rascal stuff

[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:32.140]
and the pickles and the stuff in their bag and stealing the silverware.

[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:33.760]
And so I was challenged.

[01:58:34.300 --> 01:58:39.040]
I was invited to go eat at the rascal house after work this one night at midnight.

[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:39.440]
Okay.

[01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:40.000]
All right.

[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:41.860]
This is an INZ.

[01:58:41.860 --> 01:58:43.260]
So about there in the Carroll City.

[01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:45.140]
Get on a Hershey highway.

[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:48.040]
Drive up there to North Miami Beach and go over to the rascal house.

[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:48.420]
What is that?

[01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:49.800]
183rd and Collins?

[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:50.420]
Okay.

[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:51.300]
Something like that.

[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:53.100]
Go to the rascal house.

[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:54.240]
It's about 12.30 in the morning.

[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.800]
It's just still fairly active in there.

[01:58:55.920 --> 01:58:57.500]
In fact, this is one of two stories.

[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:02.120]
The last time I ate there, which was after this, I believe, they shoved me in.

[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:05.560]
And here's a guy with like a t-shirt and tattoos sitting next to me.

[01:59:05.760 --> 01:59:08.940]
He was sitting close enough to me that he could have, if he would have had

[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:10.140]
SARS, that had been in big trouble.

[01:59:10.680 --> 01:59:13.760]
If he would have had like herpes, I could have caught it just by him breathing on me.

[01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:17.040]
But anyway, so this other time we go in there.

[01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:18.720]
And here's a table right next to us.

[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:21.060]
And there's about a half a dozen college kids.

[01:59:21.220 --> 01:59:21.600]
Well dressed.

[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:22.860]
Nice looking couple of girls.

[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.080]
Two or three guys, whatever.

[01:59:25.740 --> 01:59:30.980]
And when they're well dressed, they obviously were coming from some kind of a party or some kind of a, you know,

[01:59:31.120 --> 01:59:33.460]
they were dressed fancy, not sloppy.

[01:59:33.900 --> 01:59:35.700]
No jeans, but like, you know what I'm saying?

[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:36.160]
Right.

[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.220]
So the one kid is having whatever he's having, he has a glass of orange juice.

[01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:46.180]
So the waitress comes over and she brings them the food and she puts the orange juice out.

[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:49.460]
And then she accidentally knocks the orange juice over.

[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:49.760]
Yeah.

[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:51.720]
Now, I've heard the story.

[01:59:51.940 --> 01:59:52.500]
I've heard of this.

[01:59:53.060 --> 01:59:59.560]
The orange juice is running over the edge of the table out of this kid's nice new freshly pressed pants.

[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:00.640]
Okay, white pants.

[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.880]
And it's just, and of course it was a big glass of orange juice.

[02:00:04.100 --> 02:00:04.720]
It's like we'll have it.

[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:05.900]
You know, like about a half a gallon.

[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:07.940]
And it's rotten.

[02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:12.140]
And she stands there and looks and says, ah, sunny, that should be your worst problem.

[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:19.260]
And she took her sweet time and going to get a rag or whatever it is she brought.

[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.260]
Sunny, that should be your worst problem.

[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:27.360]
I think it's stories like that is the reason that I had never bothered to go there.

[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.860]
And you know, something that's probably one of the bitter stories.

[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.200]
Although I did eat it pump or nicks once.

[02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:32.960]
Yeah.

[02:00:33.740 --> 02:00:34.880]
Oh, same thing.

[02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:35.600]
Same deal.

[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:39.940]
And it's not, and of course there used to be in my mind a chicken and a yoke thing.

[02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:41.520]
Like it wolfies on the beach.

[02:00:41.740 --> 02:00:46.840]
It wasn't so much where the help like this in the beginning or the waiting on the client's hell over the years make them like that.

[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:48.680]
And in my mind now there is no doubt.

[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:49.020]
Right.

[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:54.640]
That in the beginning they may have all been very nice people very considerate the people working in these restaurants.

[02:00:55.040 --> 02:01:02.740]
But after putting up with a clientele for a certain period of time, they just became inseparable, hateful, uh, psychotic lunatics.

[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:08.840]
I really enjoyed the rat maze that they make you go through before you leave to make sure that you can't sneak out the one that takes you right in front of the cash register.

[02:01:09.140 --> 02:01:09.300]
Right.

[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.780]
You know, with the turn style and everything.

[02:01:10.780 --> 02:01:11.100]
Uh-huh.

[02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:17.800]
560, 560, 0560, 0560 on the 18 and 10.

[02:01:18.140 --> 02:01:22.580]
And yet when I say that to certain people, they become outraged.

[02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:27.120]
They're just indignant that there's anybody who's not in love obsessed with the rascal houses.

[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.800]
So this is the place you must eat in South Florida.

[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:34.800]
And I have one reply, one very short three letter reply to them.

[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:35.540]
Fé.

[02:01:36.520 --> 02:01:39.120]
Not just to the food, but to the entire experience.

[02:01:39.120 --> 02:01:42.040]
You must miss the rascal house experience.

[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:43.580]
WDQ I am.

[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:45.240]
Uh, nail out on that list.

[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.020]
And those are day cruises we got in those rip offs that take you out in the middle of nowhere and steal your money.

[02:01:50.900 --> 02:01:52.980]
Yeah, well, something mentioned in the jungle queen.

[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:56.560]
No, I mean, I don't know if the sponsor year started want to say the names.

[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:57.160]
Why not?

[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:58.860]
We got to have a snapshot on here.

[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:01.840]
We got to have a snapshot on cruise and the other one that day cruise.

[02:02:02.020 --> 02:02:04.160]
See, yeah, he got a shipwreck.

[02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:10.780]
Every time they sing that jingle that shipwreck doesn't sound too good, you know.

[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:11.500]
Okay.

[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:13.920]
I'm not really sure what that word was.

[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:14.600]
What?

[02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:16.140]
Now, do that work what I just did?

[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:16.900]
I don't know.

[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:18.000]
How are we supposed to know?

[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.100]
I think you're pardoned.

[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:25.260]
560, 0560, 0560.

[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.580]
Well, if not, Tom Jekker, I'm sure we'll have to smell one way there.

[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:29.220]
That's real assuring.

[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:31.260]
How are we supposed to go?

[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:32.760]
Well, great.

[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:34.760]
WDQIM.

[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:38.800]
I'd like to have a name for the list.

[02:02:39.340 --> 02:02:39.860]
Yeah, go ahead.

[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:41.540]
How about Dave County?

[02:02:42.660 --> 02:02:43.400]
That's excellent.

[02:02:43.740 --> 02:02:44.160]
Very good.

[02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:44.720]
It's perfect.

[02:02:45.100 --> 02:02:46.180]
That's the best way the whole day.

[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:46.940]
Who is it?

[02:02:47.800 --> 02:02:48.880]
Who do you think it is?

[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:49.440]
George?

[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:50.020]
No.

[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.400]
George is small potatoes.

[02:02:51.420 --> 02:02:52.520]
You want to talk to George?

[02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:55.220]
Hey, listen, I got something you can help me with.

[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.120]
Yeah, I bet.

[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:57.220]
How old are you?

[02:02:58.620 --> 02:02:59.220]
What's the result?

[02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:01.500]
About 1992.

[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:08.260]
There was an article that came out on a man's magazine, like a maximum, didn't exist back then.

[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:12.620]
But it was 500 reasons why not to vote for George Bush.

[02:03:13.140 --> 02:03:13.340]
Yeah.

[02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:15.580]
I can't find it anywhere.

[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.420]
What does that have to do with how old I am?

[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:18.240]
Oh, not the point.

[02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:19.560]
You were a little older.

[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:20.580]
You might have remembered it.

[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:22.600]
Like, George is like 25 or 10 years ago.

[02:03:24.180 --> 02:03:25.760]
George is 25.

[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:27.080]
Yeah, I'm 22.

[02:03:27.480 --> 02:03:29.000]
Okay, so he's been around a hundred and twenty.

[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:29.840]
12.

[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:31.480]
One second.

[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:33.380]
I was trying to find it.

[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:34.680]
This thing don't work.

[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:35.440]
Oh no.

[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:38.960]
No, I just, I'm trying desperately to get the cut him off.

[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.000]
Don't work.

[02:03:40.380 --> 02:03:40.800]
He's off.

[02:03:42.740 --> 02:03:43.660]
He's off now.

[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:45.200]
Let me try one.

[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:46.820]
It's not that I'm lagg apparently.

[02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:48.120]
This, this ain't working.

[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:51.160]
See, and it went on.

[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:56.560]
This is QA, I'm yes, sir.

[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.260]
This is not going to work, George.

[02:03:58.700 --> 02:03:59.240]
What is that?

[02:04:00.400 --> 02:04:00.920]
You see?

[02:04:01.260 --> 02:04:01.720]
Oh, it did work.

[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:02.580]
He I got rid of.

[02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:04.260]
It's just a lag.

[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:05.140]
We're, huh?

[02:04:05.440 --> 02:04:05.920]
It's a lag.

[02:04:06.560 --> 02:04:07.580]
No, no, it's not a lag.

[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:09.300]
We're having some spastic problems here today,

[02:04:09.320 --> 02:04:10.220]
which is very enjoyable.

[02:04:10.220 --> 02:04:11.460]
We're having a good time with it.

[02:04:11.500 --> 02:04:11.580]
Right?

[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:12.960]
I'm sure it's the thunderstorm.

[02:04:14.140 --> 02:04:14.980]
Is that what it is?

[02:04:15.300 --> 02:04:16.320]
I'm just making up excuse.

[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:18.080]
You sure got a spastic phone situation?

[02:04:18.160 --> 02:04:18.920]
I'll tell you that.

[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.040]
I'm sorry.

[02:04:20.320 --> 02:04:20.980]
I'll tell you that.

[02:04:21.040 --> 02:04:21.140]
I'm sorry.

[02:04:21.140 --> 02:04:22.680]
You got Dave County on there, being her boy?

[02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:23.860]
We got it.

[02:04:24.380 --> 02:04:24.920]
Dave County.

[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:27.480]
In fact, not just for people from out of state,

[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:30.540]
but people in state, avoid Dave County like the place for locals too.

[02:04:30.840 --> 02:04:31.820]
Yeah, avoid Dave County.

[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.260]
Of course, the good thing is the Rascal House is in Dave County,

[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:35.420]
and so is Joe Stonecrabbs.

[02:04:35.620 --> 02:04:37.160]
So you can kill three birds with one stone there.

[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.140]
You can vote all three of them.

[02:04:39.480 --> 02:04:40.460]
And then of course, uh,

[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:42.260]
Lion Country Safari.

[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:42.960]
Now where is that?

[02:04:44.200 --> 02:04:45.400]
Uh, up northish.

[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:47.380]
I forget exactly which county in Broward.

[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:48.440]
No, no further.

[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:50.620]
Point Pumbi and one of those.

[02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:50.860]
Yeah.

[02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.260]
Metro Zoo, that's in Dave County, the monkey jungle.

[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:55.500]
We didn't put the perch on here anyway.

[02:04:55.640 --> 02:04:56.220]
And for good reason.

[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.800]
Now I like the perch on here, and it's going to be new and improved and open again.

[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.220]
Don't be knocking in.

[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:05.900]
26 past 11 at 560 WQM on a really spastic Wednesday.

[02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:06.960]
Just the way we like it.

[02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.880]
We're going to QM, the more spastic, the better.

[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:13.080]
Little Havana 91, Saga Rasmills, mall 57, Joe's 42.

[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.660]
Little Havana's pulling away.

[02:05:14.980 --> 02:05:15.620]
Thank you, Dave.

[02:05:15.720 --> 02:05:16.740]
Just the way we like it.

[02:05:17.940 --> 02:05:20.700]
And of course, the little Havana, there's some more overlap with Dave County, right?

[02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:24.020]
But if you put Dave County, then you get like a bargain, you know, right?

[02:05:24.420 --> 02:05:26.660]
You get a whole bunch of extras all thrown in for one price.

[02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:31.180]

That's 1,885,344,211.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.00.

[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:11.640]
But whatever. I'm here to tell you that everything is going well for Saddam's Republican

[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:17.040]
God and we are this close to defeating the great infidel Americans.

[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:20.080]
Once again, they are not even in Iraq.

[02:07:20.600 --> 02:07:22.380]
They're not even close to Baghdad.

[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:26.400]
They have not gotten closer than 100 miles to Baghdad.

[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:28.920]
Oh, you shite.

[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.620]
What happened to the lights?

[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:36.720]
Probably just someone with a gas grill didn't look in that bright or something.

[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:37.860]
Nothing to worry about.

[02:07:38.100 --> 02:07:39.380]
Nothing to worry about.

[02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:40.720]
Baghdad is safe.

[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:46.360]
And we, the army of the great Saddam Hussein, are here to protect you.

[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:49.560]
Don't worry.

[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:52.500]
That's not gone fire that you hear.

[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:55.500]
That is firecrackers.

[02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:56.160]
That's crazy.

[02:07:57.160 --> 02:07:59.120]
We celebrate Chinese New Year.

[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:03.640]
Crazy Chinese people here in Baghdad.

[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:05.100]
Not to worry.

[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:06.140]
You are safe.

[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:13.160]
I know that the large vehicles passing by with the gunfire behind me.

[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:15.260]
They look like America tanks.

[02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:19.400]
They're really ice cream truckers.

[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:21.320]
Saddam, bitch.

[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:22.920]
Getting out of the car.

[02:08:24.040 --> 02:08:25.440]
Look at this.

[02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:26.640]
Fuck it.

[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:27.720]
I'm going home.

[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.000]
I can't leave this.

[02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:30.860]
You're not there yet, huh?

[02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.140]
Because I can't leave this.

[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:32.900]
I'm going home, home, home, home, home.

[02:08:37.640 --> 02:08:42.140]
Number 32 at 560, TV job offer for former Iraqi Information Minister.

[02:08:42.260 --> 02:08:42.660]
Do you see this?

[02:08:43.080 --> 02:08:43.240]
Yes.

[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:47.440]
An Arab TV news channel is offered a job to Saddam Hussein's top spin doctor,

[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:50.400]
former Iraqi Information Minister, Muhammad Saeed Al-Sahab.

[02:08:51.080 --> 02:08:52.000]
Sa'hab will be here.

[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:53.480]
In fact, he'd be great on Fox News.

[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:55.740]
Talk about a great spin, Master.

[02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:00.300]
Sa'hab will become a global celebrity for his persistent refusal to admit that US troops

[02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.840]
who were in Baghdad has been told by the Dubai-based Al-RbO channel that there's a job waiting

[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:05.260]
for them.

[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:07.980]
We see no problem in having Mr. Sa'hab join us.

[02:09:08.100 --> 02:09:12.320]
First of all, Sa'hab is not on the list of the 55 Iraqis most wanted by the Americans.

[02:09:12.460 --> 02:09:13.540]
He's not in that tech of cards.

[02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:16.320]
Anyone international famed during the war.

[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:17.760]
We would be happy to have him on our team.

[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.000]
Ali Al-Hedithi.

[02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.180]
They head of Al-Arabia to the AFP.

[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:25.540]
During the war, there'd be spectacle Sa'hab won fans worldwide for his in-your-face defiance

[02:09:25.540 --> 02:09:28.860]
as US and British troops swept through the country in their gravity-topped Saddam.

[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.160]
He's dropped out of sight since US forces took the Iraqi capital abruptly ending Saddam's

[02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:34.200]
24-year-old rule.

[02:09:34.740 --> 02:09:38.480]
Even President George W. said last week he had stepped out of meetings in Washington to

[02:09:38.480 --> 02:09:40.460]
catch a few of Sa'hab's daily press conferences.

[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.900]
He was great pushed to land DC television.

[02:09:43.980 --> 02:09:44.960]
How do you like that?

[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.720]
Even the Bush-Mistar himself couldn't help but let out little chuckle every now and

[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:52.280]
then like like that.

[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:56.140]
Oh see this is bad.

[02:09:56.340 --> 02:09:58.600]
No wonder we got to give clear channel all radio stations.

[02:09:58.880 --> 02:09:59.320]
Thanks Lynn.

[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:03.880]
Clear channel communications, Inc. the number one US radio station owner.

[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:06.820]
Today posted a lower first quarter profit.

[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:07.660]
Oi!

[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.600]
This is probably why we had to let go Holy O too because of the fact that Beasley is probably

[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:14.000]
reading the crap or because of clear channels losing money you can imagine.

[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:15.240]
Oh brother.

[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.440]
Posts that are lower first quarter profit is flat radio advertising and a weak live entertainment

[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:23.280]
promotion business offset the strong outdoor ad business of cheap channel.

[02:10:24.140 --> 02:10:27.660]
While clear channel managed to report flat radio revenues against the backdrop of the

[02:10:27.660 --> 02:10:32.560]
Warner Rackets promotion business was stung by weaker concert ticket sales with no blockbuster

[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:36.900]
tours to match last year's cross-be-swill nation young and Billy Joel and Elton John concerts.

[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:42.680]
Which Billy Joel and Elton John, you notice that canceled their Toronto Appearance

[02:10:42.680 --> 02:10:43.180]
there.

[02:10:43.180 --> 02:10:43.180]

[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:44.580]
Assholes.

[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:51.280]
There's absolutely nothing going on here and I'm going to say it again a rod and pay

[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:55.440]
rod and Elton and Billy Joel and all you other pushies out there shame on you.

[02:10:56.260 --> 02:10:58.580]
Like sticking the daggers sticking a focus.

[02:10:59.340 --> 02:11:02.180]
Isn't that what the information minister just said something like yeah.

[02:11:02.940 --> 02:11:07.420]
San Antonio Texas based clear channel reported net income of $71 million dollars a twelve

[02:11:07.420 --> 02:11:12.080]
cents a share compared with a year ago profit of 93.3 million or 15 cents a share.

[02:11:12.080 --> 02:11:16.540]
Excluding one time gains the company posted a year ago profit of 12 cents a share.

[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:22.060]
And on and on it goes about clear channel in arrival infinity which is owned by Viacom

[02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:26.540]
posted a 2% decline in revenue one of the weaker performing units of the Viacom family.

[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:31.040]
In February clear channel warned that war jitters that already begun to curb ad sales and

[02:11:31.040 --> 02:11:33.500]
forecast first quarter a ebit.

[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:37.220]
If you know they use that on cbc I don't have any idea what that means ebit.

[02:11:37.360 --> 02:11:37.600]
No.

[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:42.260]
It's like a new term they made up for earnings before they put in the funny figures.

[02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.100]
Got it.

[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:44.520]
Wow.

[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:47.140]
That's that's holder fundraiser for a cheap channel.

[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:47.660]
What do you say?

[02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:47.900]
Huh?

[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:52.320]
Let's raise some money for PD Bulger and all those poor bastards over to our cheap channel.

[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:56.340]
We could have a telephone and come in the second of June when they own every guy then

[02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:03.000]
radio station and TV station and gas station in America and every newspaper and every billboard

[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:07.320]
in every place else that they can spew in a right wing propaganda on behalf of the very

[02:12:07.320 --> 02:12:10.720]
people who are empowering to do these things then they can watch those profits go off.

[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:11.100]
Yeah.

[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.280]
Because once you don't have any competition anymore it's kind of hard to lose money.

[02:12:17.160 --> 02:12:21.440]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 t and Verizon line.

[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:22.840]
Have any Q a.m.

[02:12:23.100 --> 02:12:23.360]
Nobody there.

[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:25.680]
See now that it's working out they don't want to talk.

[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:28.460]
Have any Q a.m.

[02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:29.460]
How you doing?

[02:12:29.740 --> 02:12:30.080]
Good.

[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.240]
Can I get on with you?

[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:32.540]
You're on right now.

[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:33.180]
Oh, okay.

[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:33.700]
How you doing?

[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:36.240]
Topic was racism the other day.

[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:39.000]
It just goes to show the level of intelligence on the morning show.

[02:12:39.540 --> 02:12:40.740]
It has nothing to do with sports.

[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.920]
The topic it was racism on our morning show and most show?

[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:45.680]
Yeah.

[02:12:46.160 --> 02:12:47.260]
Topic was racism.

[02:12:47.880 --> 02:12:54.100]
I just merely had the comment where I said that the unfortunate part of modern day society

[02:12:54.100 --> 02:12:59.580]
is that if you were to really analyze it the most racist people are the Afro-American

[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:00.160]
Thor does.

[02:13:01.140 --> 02:13:04.280]
He didn't seem to understand that and he called me to me.

[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:05.700]
Why are you telling me this though?

[02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:07.580]
In other words you're making the same call to me that you made him.

[02:13:07.580 --> 02:13:09.240]
Are we talking about racism on this show today?

[02:13:09.380 --> 02:13:10.320]
No, no, no, no.

[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:16.400]
I just had a vent because I was so frustrated with this man the way he is veering and the way he thinks.

[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:20.000]
But I just wanted a vent and this guy's a go to the lolly.

[02:13:20.420 --> 02:13:22.740]
No, see that was worth it.

[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:23.660]
Well, there you go.

[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:28.760]
Well, he seems to keep coming back to that topic over and over again.

[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.220]
Seems like he's obsessed with it the moment.

[02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:34.100]
Oh my God.

[02:13:34.340 --> 02:13:36.340]
Dave Barry about the guy.

[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:37.840]
No, no, no, no.

[02:13:38.180 --> 02:13:39.580]
It's not going where you think it is.

[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:40.180]
Okay.

[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:45.960]
A friend of mine recently gave me a Dave Barry book to retell me it was hilarious.

[02:13:46.200 --> 02:13:50.260]
The book's topic is on politics and Barry goes on and on about the comedy that comes from our city

[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:51.840]
county state and federal politicians.

[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:58.620]
He talks about how funny this is that these Cuban fascists running our county and how hilarious the alien debacle in 2000 election was.

[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:06.300]
I don't think there's a goddamn thing funny about a corrupt government being run by individuals who have no respect for human and civil rights unless they belong to the right ethnic group and hold certain opinions.

[02:14:06.680 --> 02:14:07.620]
It's tragic and pathetic.

[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:14.280]
I nominate Dave Barry as one of the leading assholes of the community and told my friend Dave Barry can stick the book up his asswear and pull out his house.

[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:14.860]
How do you like that?

[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:17.560]
One thing most sensible people believe about Dave Barry.

[02:14:18.140 --> 02:14:19.460]
He's an asshole right.

[02:14:21.200 --> 02:14:23.580]
See, there's another state of mind from South Florida.

[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:28.500]
Rascal House, Joe Stone Crab, DeForge, Dave Barry, all a state of mind.

[02:14:28.980 --> 02:14:31.020]
Dave Barry is about as funny as cancer than he can't.

[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:36.140]
He's about as funny as popping a gigantic purple grape-sized hemorrhoid.

[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:42.400]
Here's one and you know something this is the only response I've had about Jerry Williams passing away.

[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:44.020]
There's something wrong.

[02:14:44.340 --> 02:14:45.580]
There is something very, very wrong.

[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:49.760]
I realized that he was on with me and WNW West in 1980, it's 23 years ago.

[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:55.380]
Most of the people listen to those back in those days are probably dead by now because Jerry used to joke about our ancient demographics.

[02:14:56.620 --> 02:14:58.780]
He was really a very funny guy.

[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:02.440]
Jerry was known. He made his career even though he was a little devious and backstabbing.

[02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:06.040]
But he made his career based on the real heavy-duty political talk in Boston and Chicago.

[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.100]
But when he came down here, he said to me, be down in the afternoon, what was 100 degrees in the shade.

[02:15:11.100 --> 02:15:14.580]
People wanted mostly fun and games to keep it light.

[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:17.400]
And he was right. He was absolutely right.

[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:23.120]
And I should, in honor of his passing way, I should tell Jerry Williams through about the last night in town.

[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:23.640]
Yeah.

[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:26.120]
About the robbery in our building. I've put it that.

[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:28.340]
I will tell you that in a minute.

[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:32.080]
Anyway, subject Jerry Williams yesterday when you mentioned the passing of Jerry Williams, the name stirred my memory.

[02:15:32.240 --> 02:15:35.560]
This is Robin Pennsylvania. You probably heard him on DB and he obviously did because I'm reading ahead.

[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:38.560]
It was that until you mentioned Bill and Dolly Banks that hit home.

[02:15:38.560 --> 02:15:42.980]
It's been more than 20 years since Jerry left WWDB in Philadelphia for Florida.

[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.260]
At that time, he was my favorite talk show host.

[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:47.920]
He had a firing techno-guff style much like yourself.

[02:15:48.120 --> 02:15:52.200]
That was back in the days when there was a healthy mix of left and right level conservative talk radio hosts.

[02:15:52.600 --> 02:15:55.200]
Unfortunately, both those days in Jerry Williams are now gone.

[02:15:55.640 --> 02:15:58.280]
Thanks for the memories, says Robin Pennsylvania. And you are as usual.

[02:15:58.400 --> 02:15:59.960]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:00.620]
Yeah, he was great.

[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:04.020]
He was a great talk show host.

[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:04.880]
Took on a lot of issues.

[02:16:05.100 --> 02:16:06.620]
The turnpike tolls and massive chews.

[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:08.920]
I mean, wasn't afraid to take anybody on.

[02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:16.180]
So anyway, his last night at WNWS, he had just had it with South Florida and won any part of the whole ambiance.

[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:18.900]
And he had an offer to go back to Boston, I believe it was.

[02:16:20.800 --> 02:16:22.260]
And so I'm working eight to midnight.

[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:26.780]
Now, Jerry was on between two and six.

[02:16:26.780 --> 02:16:28.900]
I want to say it. Two and six was stuttley was on there.

[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.780]
I just love Israel. The Jewish people that the right wing bitch.

[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:32.880]
He was on between six and eight.

[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:36.920]
So anyway, it's he's in the building. He's getting all this stuff together.

[02:16:36.920 --> 02:16:38.680]
He's leaving. He's got a few cartons of stuff.

[02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:40.620]
He's going to pack up on his car and head back to Boston.

[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:46.000]
And I'm on the air. It's like about 830 and all of a sudden he comes to the door of the studio.

[02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.960]
Now, keep in mind, this is studio with no windows.

[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:50.700]
I mean, you think you're a close student like back in the corner.

[02:16:51.960 --> 02:16:53.940]
No exit. No window only one door.

[02:16:54.040 --> 02:16:55.480]
No way to run. No way to hide. No window.

[02:16:55.680 --> 02:16:57.280]
And there was a window in the door though.

[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:00.140]
And I see his face in the window with look of terror.

[02:17:00.140 --> 02:17:02.420]
I mean, it's white. There's a sheet almost as pale as George.

[02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:05.940]
And he opens the door and he says to me, and I call her.

[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:07.420]
I was going to say hello. Hello, me old.

[02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:09.520]
My lips are blue. You know, they're old. The end is going on.

[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.920]
And so I shut off my mic. And he says three black guys with guns.

[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:14.920]
They took my chain. And he's pointing around.

[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:16.480]
Yeah. And then he disappears.

[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:17.480]
That he vanishes.

[02:17:18.380 --> 02:17:20.440]
Now, keep in mind that I'm sitting in the back.

[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:22.960]
And of course, our building, we used to be a beauty part of that building.

[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:24.720]
And it didn't look like a radio station.

[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:26.640]
Didn't have a big sign in front of it. It could have been anything.

[02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:31.200]
And so obviously the guys that broke in, they didn't know what kind of a business was.

[02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.120]
They were just interested in making arm robbery.

[02:17:34.060 --> 02:17:38.000]
So I'm sitting in there and visions of sure plums are dancing in my head.

[02:17:38.040 --> 02:17:39.480]
Because I got nowhere to go, baby.

[02:17:40.260 --> 02:17:42.220]
I got nowhere to go. I could hide out of the counter.

[02:17:42.380 --> 02:17:44.660]
But they can't hide too long in a room. That's about two by four.

[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:50.320]
And so I, you know, and I said if I said we're having an emergency in a building,

[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:53.340]
and with some of them, please call 911 and have them come to the radio station.

[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:55.120]
And I give the address and load them a road and Dixie whatever.

[02:17:55.120 --> 02:18:01.220]
And to make a long story short, they, they've amused because I guess they finally realized that it was a radio station.

[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:05.400]
They were winding their way back and they looked and they saw the equipment and the holy crap were in a radio station.

[02:18:05.920 --> 02:18:06.920]
They know money here.

[02:18:07.060 --> 02:18:11.420]
So I brought him in after the break and I put him on the ear and he told the whole story.

[02:18:11.420 --> 02:18:12.140]
And he was still pale.

[02:18:12.140 --> 02:18:16.560]
And so this was Jerry Williams last night on the year in South Florida.

[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:17.280]
On the way out.

[02:18:17.660 --> 02:18:20.540]
Yeah. True story.

[02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:24.820]
If your Williams dead at 79, nothing in a hero, nothing in a sunset.

[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:27.440]
Well, I'm going to probably take a little bit too much research in the homework.

[02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:30.980]
In fact, I'll probably call them a Jimmy Williams, you know, just like Rick Casper.

[02:18:31.440 --> 02:18:31.540]
Yeah.

[02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:36.140]
We got such a bunch of bozos there right in crap, man.

[02:18:36.140 --> 02:18:37.820]
It's the perfect place off photo.

[02:18:39.340 --> 02:18:42.700]
You've heard that maggot magnet, South Florida is a crap magnet.

[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:45.540]
You can almost smell it.

[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:51.420]
Lavin 42 or 560 WQV, you can almost smell your pool because it's looking and smelling pretty crappy these days.

[02:18:51.420 --> 02:18:53.140]
It's stained, dirty, cracking maybe.

[02:18:53.620 --> 02:18:54.580]
Well, do something about it.

[02:18:54.740 --> 02:18:59.140]
Don't have no mole ugly pool, especially with all these hot days coming up that might not actually be raining.

[02:18:59.700 --> 02:19:00.680]
Hot summer weather is coming.

[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:02.600]
You want to be different in that pool as much as possible.

[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:07.680]
So call our good friends at Atlantic Marseille, who are real professionals, not just a couple of illegal aliens,

[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:11.340]
rather than a beat up rough that our old pickup truck, who are pretending to be pool guys.

[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:14.320]
This is a real honest degree of this construction company.

[02:19:14.620 --> 02:19:21.760]
Atlantic Marseille uses only full-time employees, not subcontractors, and they specialize in the most incredible innovation at the pool business, Diamond Bright.

They even train other companies internationally how to do diamond-brighting and do it right.

[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.660]
They'll give you the same price to give the contractors.

[02:19:32.100 --> 02:19:34.980]
They serve North Miami, Broward, Palm Beach, so call Atlantic Marseille.

[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:37.480]

[02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:44.600]
They also do a stupidest unbeatable job of pool and deck renovations, custom lighting, pool heating, and exotic water features too.

[02:19:44.700 --> 02:19:45.260]
You can't beat them.

[02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:49.460]
So for the best job at a price that's unbeatable, call Atlantic Marseille, tool free.

[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:52.400]

That's 1-800-558-883.

[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:59.200]
Diamond Bright, do it right because Diamond Bright is your pool's best friend.

[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:03.460]
My life and local, this is for 205-60.

[02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.640]
Way to way, yeah.

[02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:08.220]
Eisner!

[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:12.380]
Cindy, I told you not to bother me.

[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:12.940]
Eisner!

[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:14.200]
Mr. Mouse!

[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:16.040]
Are you snapping at Eisner?

[02:20:16.520 --> 02:20:18.680]
Oh, no, nothing sir. How are you?

[02:20:19.340 --> 02:20:20.100]
I'm not good!

[02:20:20.660 --> 02:20:23.080]
Oh, no. What's wrong now sir?

[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:25.680]
Oh, one of my balls turned black.

[02:20:26.180 --> 02:20:26.920]
Sure you're balls?

[02:20:27.160 --> 02:20:30.420]
My basketball, my garage, it froze and turned black!

[02:20:30.940 --> 02:20:32.220]
Oh, that's terrible.

[02:20:32.440 --> 02:20:33.920]
I'm a big basketballer.

[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.520]
Horrible.

[02:20:34.760 --> 02:20:36.020]
Make the call, Eisner.

[02:20:36.320 --> 02:20:37.340]
What call, sir?

[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:37.680]
Get a burger.

[02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:40.280]
I ran the paper, she's getting a divorce.

[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:41.920]
Well, she's separated.

[02:20:42.060 --> 02:20:43.760]
There's some chemistry there, Eisner.

[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:47.340]
She wants me, I think she was just afraid to make the move on the big guy.

[02:20:47.700 --> 02:20:50.820]
But sir, with all due respect, you're a mouse.

[02:20:51.280 --> 02:20:51.660]
Hey!

[02:20:52.480 --> 02:20:54.520]
Don't tell me, I know I'm a mouse.

[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.140]
I'm hot, though.

[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.580]
She wants me, I can tell.

[02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:59.360]
You're my pinbizer.

[02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:00.600]
Okay, okay, sir.

[02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:01.380]
I'll make the thing.

[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:02.720]
Oh, hang on a minute.

[02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.100]
I said, hey miss!

[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:07.960]
I am so sick of that song, Remus.

[02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:09.260]
Do not sing.

[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:12.180]
That song, anymore, Zipity, do not Zipity A.

[02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:13.580]
Happy song, Bob.

[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:15.360]
It doesn't make me happy, Remus.

[02:21:15.940 --> 02:21:17.820]
It makes me want to strangle you.

[02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:19.340]
Iser?

[02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:20.660]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:20.860 --> 02:21:22.640]
I do want to tell you one good thing you're doing.

[02:21:23.200 --> 02:21:23.520]
Okay.

[02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:26.100]
That's off to you for American Idol.

[02:21:26.720 --> 02:21:28.640]
You're finally putting us on the map of that thing.

[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:29.140]
Oh.

[02:21:29.800 --> 02:21:31.160]
Way to go, Eisner.

[02:21:31.160 --> 02:21:33.460]
Well, sir, that's actually the Fox Network.

[02:21:34.140 --> 02:21:35.360]
Don't correct me, Eisner.

[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:37.160]
Remus?

[02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.360]
What are you doing, Remus?

[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:41.540]
Get A. Boss and play a little more.

[02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:45.300]
Don't play the symbols on the phone, Remus.

[02:21:45.480 --> 02:21:47.580]
Frank Simper, it didn't even have to hand balls.

[02:21:47.820 --> 02:21:49.200]
It didn't even land, fan.

[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:50.160]
It's terrible.

[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:51.420]
That's right.

[02:21:51.640 --> 02:21:52.640]
They need me, Bob.

[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:54.800]
Don't play a little again, Remus.

[02:21:55.900 --> 02:21:56.280]
Iser?

[02:21:56.500 --> 02:21:57.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:21:57.580 --> 02:21:58.300]
What are we, Robin?

[02:21:58.780 --> 02:22:00.040]
Well, sir, we've got the bachelor.

[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:01.440]
Oh, that's right.

[02:22:01.820 --> 02:22:05.140]
That stupid fire steam kid with that pool peat and grin.

[02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:06.100]
No, no, sir.

[02:22:06.260 --> 02:22:07.600]
It's a fire stone.

[02:22:07.860 --> 02:22:08.300]
Ah, no.

[02:22:08.680 --> 02:22:09.360]
Yes, sir?

[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:11.140]
Don't you correct me.

[02:22:11.760 --> 02:22:12.480]
What's his name?

[02:22:13.780 --> 02:22:14.620]
What's his name?

[02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:16.240]
Fire steam.

[02:22:16.660 --> 02:22:17.520]
No, you're waiting in.

[02:22:17.580 --> 02:22:18.420]
It's fire stone.

[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:20.260]
You live in all the name of a bachelor.

[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:22.120]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:22.680]
Heaven's sake.

[02:22:22.880 --> 02:22:25.500]
What's this information I have to read about Peter Jennings?

[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:27.040]
What about Peter, sir?

[02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:27.840]
He's doing a fine job.

[02:22:29.800 --> 02:22:31.720]
That was a douabah.

[02:22:31.980 --> 02:22:34.700]
Remus, I swear to God.

[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:41.500]
I will take your hand between my white glove hands and fluke it.

[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:42.580]
Ah, both are.

[02:22:42.800 --> 02:22:44.320]
Well, I'm under a little stress, Bob.

[02:22:44.780 --> 02:22:45.160]
What's the matter?

[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:46.720]
It's a naked-dermed patch, do you hear it?

[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:48.320]
The naked-dermed patch.

[02:22:48.380 --> 02:22:49.300]
It's not smoking, Bob.

[02:22:49.380 --> 02:22:50.860]
You don't smoke, Remus.

[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:53.520]
Get out of here.

[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:53.840]
You moron.

[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:56.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:57.220]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:57.220 --> 02:22:59.140]
Well, Mr. Jennings is doing a fine job.

[02:22:59.480 --> 02:23:01.360]
Peter Jennings is terrible.

[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:02.740]
He's French.

[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:04.800]
Well, I actually saw his Canadian.

[02:23:05.320 --> 02:23:06.840]
Uh, uh, uh, is there?

[02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:07.300]
Yes.

[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:08.500]
What I tell you about correct him?

[02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:10.700]
What is Peter Jennings?

[02:23:11.160 --> 02:23:12.640]
Is French?

[02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:14.680]
No, you moron.

[02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:15.540]
He's Canadian.

[02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.100]
He's the anchor of our network.

[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:18.160]
You don't even know what he does.

[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:20.560]
Why do I keep you around, Eisner?

[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:21.500]
I don't know.

[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:22.620]
Why, Eisner?

[02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:23.200]
I don't know.

[02:23:23.620 --> 02:23:25.140]
You are...

[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:25.780]
Say it.

[02:23:26.500 --> 02:23:27.040]
You're killing me?

[02:23:27.180 --> 02:23:27.820]
No, I'm not.

[02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:28.920]
And you know what?

[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.920]
Try to get me on that bachelor's shelf.

[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:32.580]
But, sir, you're married, Mouse.

[02:23:32.900 --> 02:23:33.740]
Hey, Eisner.

[02:23:34.040 --> 02:23:34.140]
Yes?

[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:35.360]
I don't want to marry him.

[02:23:35.640 --> 02:23:37.800]
I don't want to date those 25 girls.

[02:23:38.260 --> 02:23:40.060]
I just want to serve them!

[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:41.660]
Leave it!

[02:23:42.620 --> 02:23:44.180]
Look, 48-12 minutes to noon.

[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:48.000]
We got the man dog of one, Joseph Gackie, for Hanky 3, and then some stuff.

[02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:53.220]
Uh, I'd like to have one person call in who remembers Jerry Williams on that year when he was a WNWS,

[02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:56.280]
or remembers him from Boston, or Philly, or Chicago, or Nellie.

[02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:57.340]
Would that be, Eisner?

[02:23:58.440 --> 02:23:58.780]
Okay.

[02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:01.260]
Well, I mean, let's have something.

[02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:03.940]
Let's have a little something here.

[02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:07.760]
Guy was in broadcasting for about 100 years.

[02:24:07.800 --> 02:24:09.380]
He was a real pioneer in talk radio.

[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:11.760]
You think somebody out there would have something to say about Jerry Williams?

[02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:12.480]
Did that or anything?

[02:24:16.100 --> 02:24:16.920]
That was that.

[02:24:17.060 --> 02:24:17.380]
Fanfare?

[02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:18.820]
He just died, though.

[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.480]
You don't have a fanfare when somebody dies.

[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:22.480]
Oh, we can celebrate his life.

[02:24:23.040 --> 02:24:23.780]
There you go.

[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:25.480]
I wouldn't get that carried away, okay?

[02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:27.760]
WQAM?

[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:29.540]
Yes, good morning.

[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:30.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:32.840]
Nell is asking people to remember Jerry Williams.

[02:24:32.980 --> 02:24:33.620]
Oh, I sure am.

[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:35.060]
You're on right now, sir.

[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:35.960]
Oh, hi, Nell.

[02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:36.580]
How are you?

[02:24:36.920 --> 02:24:38.740]
I got a crew up in the Boston area.

[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:42.940]
And as a kid, I used to listen to Jerry Williams at that time.

[02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:43.920]
He was on WBZ.

[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:44.560]
Right.

[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:46.880]
You remember he was also on WMEX once upon a time.

[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:47.420]
That's right.

[02:24:47.420 --> 02:24:51.960]
And at that time, they used to call it the 10-Dermed Night Ride of Jerry Williams.

[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:54.960]
And then after that, Larry Glick would come on.

[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:55.300]
Right.

[02:24:55.540 --> 02:24:56.320]
With his lemonade stand.

[02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:59.100]
Yeah, I was always kind of addicted to radio.

[02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:02.120]
And then I was up in Boston about five years ago,

[02:25:02.220 --> 02:25:04.880]
and he was on the air doing a kind of a...

[02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:07.020]
As you said, he also had a good sense of humor.

[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:07.580]
Yeah.

[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:12.260]
He was doing a show where, you know, was very light.

[02:25:13.220 --> 02:25:16.300]
At the time he was a go, he was very against the Vietnam War,

[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:18.280]
and I was just a kid on 46 now.

[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:18.800]
Right.

[02:25:18.940 --> 02:25:19.960]
And I thought he was wrong.

[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:21.640]
You know, at the time, I didn't know any better.

[02:25:22.160 --> 02:25:24.480]
I learned later on what was really going on.

[02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:27.380]
But I remember, you know, in those days,

[02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:31.300]
before they ruined radio, you could turn the dial and you had all...

[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:37.060]
A huge variety of music and different opinions that's nothing like today.

[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:38.840]
So yeah, I'm sorry.

[02:25:39.020 --> 02:25:44.460]
Even on the music stations back when we used to have music on A and back before FN became anything meaningful.

[02:25:44.460 --> 02:25:44.960]
Right.

[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:48.040]
WBZ was a great station in WMEX with Arnie Ginsburg.

[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:49.240]
You had personalities.

[02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:50.420]
That's all gone now.

[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:52.520]
There's no sitting on music on FN today.

[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:53.800]
There are almost no personalities.

[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:55.020]
All you have is a jukebox.

[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:57.960]
It's all the same, and it's both mostly the same owners.

[02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:01.140]
The only thing really worth listening to these days is you.

[02:26:01.580 --> 02:26:01.960]
I agree.

[02:26:03.400 --> 02:26:05.100]
So sorry to hear he's gone.

[02:26:05.380 --> 02:26:10.800]
I had heard he had moved down here, and I was hoping he might be on some way down here.

[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:13.340]
But anyway...

[02:26:13.340 --> 02:26:15.900]
I guess he was living somewhere in New England.

[02:26:16.260 --> 02:26:17.900]
The Thuun or somewhere where at the time he died.

[02:26:18.140 --> 02:26:18.500]
I see.

[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:19.620]
Neil...

[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:24.440]
Like I say, I grew up with the radio falling asleep at night as a kid and everything else.

[02:26:24.580 --> 02:26:25.460]
And you're the only one left.

[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:27.980]
And when you retire, that's the end of it.

[02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:30.060]
That point we'll throw our radios away.

[02:26:30.180 --> 02:26:30.740]
I think so.

[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:31.560]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:32.100]
Bye bye, Neil.

[02:26:32.320 --> 02:26:33.700]
See, that was something nice.

[02:26:33.840 --> 02:26:34.940]
See, people say you're so negative.

[02:26:35.320 --> 02:26:35.820]
I'm not negative.

[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:38.580]
I want to say something nice about a guy who was a great broadcaster,

[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:41.440]
who was a pioneer in talk radio and in radio in general.

[02:26:41.440 --> 02:26:45.880]
He was a great, great broadcaster, Jerry Williams, and had a big pair too, by the way.

[02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:50.140]
He was extraordinarily ugly, which is another reason I like Jerry.

[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:52.680]
He was even uglier than I am, which is not easy.

[02:26:55.500 --> 02:26:56.500]
So you know, there's no comment?

[02:26:56.880 --> 02:26:56.980]
What?

[02:26:58.020 --> 02:26:59.040]
What am I going to add to that?

[02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:00.660]
Nothing, I'm just saying.

[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:01.380]
He was a very ugly.

[02:27:01.500 --> 02:27:02.600]
I mean, I'm not going to make him a bad guy.

[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:05.520]
I'm just saying that when you're ugly, you always really like people that are ugly.

[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:07.920]
You hang out with people that are a lot uglier than you, right, Carla?

[02:27:08.020 --> 02:27:10.800]
Because if you're ugly and hang out with good-looking people, then, you know, by comparison.

[02:27:10.800 --> 02:27:12.720]
It looked pretty bad.

[02:27:12.900 --> 02:27:13.620]
W-W-A-Q-A-M.

[02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:16.100]
I remember Jerry Wichner.

[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.160]
You know, that was the lineup too, which there was on him midnight.

[02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:21.840]
Oh, boy.

[02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:23.820]
I'm getting back into my corner now.

[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:24.340]
You see it?

[02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:24.680]
Uh-huh.

[02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:26.180]
What are you going to do?

[02:27:26.180 --> 02:27:32.560]
Mike Winnery, Jerry Wichner, Charlie Capus, Jerry Williams, Dick Casper,

[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:38.600]
Bill Colder, Bill Colder, Stanmaid, you're not, but he sure looks like it, I gather.

[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:39.380]
Oh, sonny-hersh.

[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:40.680]
Sonny-hersh?

[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:41.340]
Oh, no.

[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:44.480]
Sonny-hersh, you had to throw that in there and really...

[02:27:44.480 --> 02:27:44.920]
No, it really hurt me.

[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:48.360]
And here I am, just barely hanging on.

[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:49.180]
Oh, god.

[02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:53.020]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:53.380]
Yeah.

[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:56.820]
The time is ticking and I'm taking a lickin' man.

[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.240]
Yeah, how is the old ticker anyway?

[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:00.720]
It's, uh, my, uh, it's got a good squeeze.

[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:04.260]
I got a good squeeze.

[02:28:04.620 --> 02:28:06.320]
I'm not sure what he was talking about that asshole.

[02:28:06.320 --> 02:28:09.080]
I thought he was bush over there, Cleveland Clinic.

[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.520]
Otherwise, those Rimmer deals, huh?

[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:12.080]
Hey, Rimmer, have a great life, okay?

[02:28:12.200 --> 02:28:12.760]
Lose my number.

[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:13.540]
Just go away.

[02:28:15.300 --> 02:28:16.680]
Oh, no, this is bad.

[02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:17.700]
This is terrible.

[02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:18.180]
Oh, no.

[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:18.880]
Somebody named...

[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:19.880]
Why did you send this to me?

[02:28:19.920 --> 02:28:21.220]
This is in such poor taste.

[02:28:21.780 --> 02:28:24.180]
Somebody named Goldie Goldstein passed away.

[02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:26.900]
And so, somebody faxes us the old bit here.

[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.320]
And it says we can only hope Moe is next.

[02:28:29.600 --> 02:28:30.980]
Now, that's bad.

[02:28:31.280 --> 02:28:32.420]
Because it wasn't our Geldie.

[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:32.660]
Go ahead.

[02:28:32.680 --> 02:28:33.940]
This is Goldie, not Geldie.

[02:28:34.060 --> 02:28:34.940]
See, I know the real name.

[02:28:35.620 --> 02:28:41.940]
And as far as Moe is concerned, I would dance on his grave, but other than that, that's a very, very poor taste.

[02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:45.240]
So thank goodness we had the one guy that knew your wins.

[02:28:45.300 --> 02:28:46.400]
Maybe we'll have one or two more.

[02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.440]
What are you laughing about?

[02:28:48.480 --> 02:28:49.580]
Oh, just about that.

[02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:51.460]
About dancing on Moe's grave.

[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:51.800]

[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:52.700]
I really would.

[02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:56.040]
In fact, we can talk about raising money for charity.

[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:57.920]
Can you imagine we could pay that mission to see that?

[02:28:58.340 --> 02:28:58.960]
To raise millions.

[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:01.720]
Oh, and the phone just went dead again.

[02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:02.020]
Look at that.

[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:02.780]
This is over the line.

[02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:03.940]
Oh, and I just for a second.

[02:29:05.600 --> 02:29:08.060]
You're having little problems on that end.

[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:09.320]
WDQAM.

[02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:10.400]
Hi, how are you doing?

[02:29:10.820 --> 02:29:11.160]
Pretty good.

[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:11.700]
Good.

[02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:12.360]
Can I talk to you?

[02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:13.040]
Speaking.

[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:14.180]
Oh, I'm fine.

[02:29:14.480 --> 02:29:14.860]
How are you?

[02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:17.400]
I was listening to the night that Jerry got robbed.

[02:29:18.020 --> 02:29:19.220]
And it was an incredible or what?

[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:26.160]
Yeah, and when Richard came out, he made note that he was going to bring the gun in there and wait for somebody.

[02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:26.660]
Remember that?

[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:27.740]
Yeah, I sure do.

[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:28.240]
Yeah.

[02:29:29.120 --> 02:29:29.940]
Okay, take care.

[02:29:30.260 --> 02:29:30.540]
Thanks.

[02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:31.820]
Here's the guy with a good memory.

[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:32.780]
Those were the days, man.

[02:29:32.880 --> 02:29:33.760]
What's there used to bring in?

[02:29:33.840 --> 02:29:35.300]
And I about told that story a million times.

[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:36.980]
So I come on, tell me his old time radio stories.

[02:29:36.980 --> 02:29:38.100]
I must be on a way out too.

[02:29:38.180 --> 02:29:38.480]
What do you think?

[02:29:38.820 --> 02:29:39.120]
Probably.

[02:29:40.060 --> 02:29:43.240]
But he used to bring in his 747.

[02:29:45.340 --> 02:29:45.640]
Yeah.

[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:47.420]
It was a big plane.

[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:51.660]
No, he used to bring in a, what the hell's the damn, the big gun?

[02:29:53.540 --> 02:29:53.660]
What?

[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:54.280]
45?

[02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:55.460]
Yeah, got it.

[02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:56.480]
No, it wasn't a 45.

[02:29:56.720 --> 02:29:57.700]
A big...

[02:29:57.700 --> 02:29:58.620]
38 magnet.

[02:29:58.980 --> 02:29:59.400]
No, no.

[02:29:59.560 --> 02:29:59.900]
Keep going.

[02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:00.580]
357?

[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:01.760]
A 35, that's what I meant.

[02:30:01.900 --> 02:30:02.820]
What did I say 747?

[02:30:03.180 --> 02:30:03.180]

[02:30:03.220 --> 02:30:05.380]
Well, my brains are fried now, but I realized I'm on a way out.

[02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:10.420]
And anyway, he used to have it in his briefcase, big silver baby.

[02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:15.060]
And he'd owe every night, same routine, put the briefcase down on a counter.

[02:30:15.060 --> 02:30:16.340]
He'd come in about 20 till midnight.

[02:30:16.680 --> 02:30:18.640]
He used to work midnight till 5 or 6 a.m.

[02:30:20.900 --> 02:30:26.960]
And he'd set the briefcase down off to the side, and he would open it up, and he would pull out the gun.

[02:30:28.280 --> 02:30:32.900]
The 357 magnet, he pulled it out, and he'd pull it out in a way like, as if he were pulling out of a holster, you know?

[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:33.160]
Yeah.

[02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:39.000]
Like a cowboy, and he would pull it out of the end, he would set it down in a certain spot, just in case.

[02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:39.580]
Right.

[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:45.340]
Well, I don't know, that was just him, or he would, and in the briefcase, I mean, not on the counter, but he'd set it over in a certain spot in the briefcase.

[02:30:46.140 --> 02:30:55.680]
And the night I had that rabbi in his daughter on, back in the days, I used to do the topical crap and screaming about religion and all this, and I got this rabbi on there, and we're screaming in the Ellen talking our thing and arguing.

[02:30:55.680 --> 02:30:57.860]
And Jerry comes in, it's 20 to midnight.

[02:30:58.580 --> 02:31:04.460]
And the rabbi is sitting there in his daughter, she's not on the ear, she's just sitting there watching the show, just soaking up the amusement.

[02:31:05.600 --> 02:31:13.240]
And Jerry comes in and opens up the briefcase and sits it way down at the end of the counter, and he opens it up and pulls out the gun.

[02:31:14.140 --> 02:31:23.660]
Well, I want to check you with the eyes on that rabbi, bulls-dout, anybody that watches passions and knows the eyes on Mrs. Wallace on Beth's mother that are bulging out of her head.

[02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:27.340]
That's how her eyes bulge out. And he put his hands straight up in the ear.

[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:28.460]
I can't just hold up.

[02:31:28.540 --> 02:31:37.780]
I'm not making that up into true story. And his daughter, she didn't know how to scream like that, but an audible one, but she let out a gasp, kind of like, yeah, you could tell that she thought the jig was up.

[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:40.040]
Yeah.

[02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:45.140]
The rabbi shot his hands up in the ear like he had been shot out of a cannon.

[02:31:47.940 --> 02:31:49.240]
It was incredible.

[02:31:49.860 --> 02:31:55.720]
I should write that book. You're right. You should just a little thing. Yes, that I'm telling on the ear. And this, of course, is only the tip of the iceberg.

[02:31:55.900 --> 02:32:01.100]
He ports too late. There's these are only like little tidbit. The abbi ports too late because once you did, it's hard to write your bio.

[02:32:01.160 --> 02:32:01.900]
Yeah. Right.

[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:05.660]
Once really very difficult. Maybe I'll write it from the other side.

[02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:07.320]
We'll get John.

[02:32:07.420 --> 02:32:10.760]
Oh, I'm thinking of that. I look since I got time. It's a short break.

[02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:17.020]
Got some bad news. One of my barbers died. I put you a long time ago. I found a great barber shop here that are really low.

[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:24.680]
So come on. Whatever. I think it was last Saturday. A week ago this Saturday. I go in here to get a haircut.

[02:32:25.320 --> 02:32:30.200]
In fact, I'd gone into the first week I came back up here. I went in because I was long overdue for her cut.

[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:35.080]
And I go out of my favorite barber shop and there's a sign on that were closed for 12 days because of family emergency.

[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:38.220]
And of course, with everything else going on in town, you wonder, uh-oh, you know.

[02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:44.160]
So during the course of the week, I would every day want to get off the ride, walk over there.

[02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:49.140]
And I'd look and they'd have like 10 people 10 guys sitting around waiting and they're only one barber just jammed up.

[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:54.960]
And I'd wave to me way back. But I wasn't going to sit around waiting. I just don't have the patience waiting for 10 guys to get a haircut with one guy working.

[02:32:56.160 --> 02:33:01.640]
So to make a long story short, this past Saturday I go in there. I got up real early. They open early in the morning. I go in there.

[02:33:02.600 --> 02:33:09.880]
And again, there's my one and one of the two barbers who always cut my hair. And he waves at me and I sit down and there's a guy sitting ahead of me.

[02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.400]
And he says, you know, Rocco died, which was the other barber.

[02:33:13.680 --> 02:33:18.560]
Hmm. He was 65. He had just cut my hair like a few weeks before last haircut I had.

[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:23.400]
65, it looked like in great health, a real Italian, not a Guido, but like a real Italian from the old country.

[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:25.020]
And he died.

[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:26.140]
Bummer.

[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:28.380]
And if he pressing, yeah, it is.

[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:36.700]
I don't know. I'm going to go slash my wrist now. Yeah, it was depressing. I'm trying to get everybody into a much better mood and to list up the public into what I feel happy mode, huh?

[02:33:37.680 --> 02:33:39.280]
And my barber died.

[02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:43.460]
65 stroke.

[02:33:44.380 --> 02:33:46.800]
Really? Yeah. Stroke.

[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:48.240]
I did.

[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:56.080]
So anyway, I wondered why I'm telling the story. I forgot the whole purpose of my telling you that was the guy that's getting the haircut ahead of me now.

[02:33:56.260 --> 02:33:59.640]
He's talking to the other barber about this other guy.

[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:06.500]
And he starts talking about death and about, well, you know, my sister told me that she had a near death experience.

[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:10.900]
And when you go to the other side and he starts describing this whole thing about where you go.

[02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:14.660]
And he says, the first thing all your relatives are there waiting for you when you get to the other side.

[02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:15.060]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:16.840 --> 02:34:18.940]
I'm telling you the thing on that. I don't want to go there.

[02:34:19.460 --> 02:34:23.120]
And so the barber, it looks at me, you know, because I'm sitting there waiting next to me.

[02:34:23.120 --> 02:34:26.840]
He looks at me like kind of like a nod like, like, like, like, like, like that.

[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:32.440]
And then the barber says, he says, I guess that all depends on which direction you're going.

[02:34:33.380 --> 02:34:34.220]
That's kind of cute.

[02:34:35.280 --> 02:34:38.740]
A minute till noon at 5.60 on WQM death radio.

[02:34:39.200 --> 02:34:41.440]

We put a gun to the head of 100 loyal Iraqi take a, and ask them who picture you have most of in your home.

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:58.080]
Slingling them your goat has sounded fresh.

But yeah, your family.

[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:00.040]

Same family you can still point now.

[02:37:02.720 --> 02:37:04.740]
All loyal Iraqis have pictures of Saddam.

[02:37:04.880 --> 02:37:06.540]
That is correct. This is number one answer.

[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:08.580]
Most picture of Saddam.

[02:37:08.580 --> 02:37:10.520]
Who would have ever seen such a thing.

[02:37:10.760 --> 02:37:13.680]
Oh, what the fuck? You never put your, that was your mother.

It smells un-gummed, that's what it smells like

[02:54:13.580 --> 02:54:16.480]
It smells like you stole your ass to the devil

[02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:18.500]
I don't know if it's a hand

[02:54:18.500 --> 02:54:20.620]
Well, how many is it? How long is it?

[02:54:20.820 --> 02:54:22.440]
It's not as long as my arm

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:25.900]
I don't think it's fun, why y'all

[02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:27.900]
This is not fun, I got a damn

Too far for it, my back seat

[02:54:30.640 --> 02:54:32.660]
You know, I think it's just a racial

[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:34.860]
That's what they call it

[02:54:36.540 --> 02:54:41.660]
A little kid is running away from it

[02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.880]
I'm going to go find this funny

[02:54:46.760 --> 02:54:48.020]
Oh, okay

[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:49.640]

Oh, all right, all right

[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.520]

And Jim, it's me

[02:55:08.300 --> 02:55:09.700]
How long is it, huh?

[02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:12.840]
I am taking this as a fresh shirt

[02:55:12.840 --> 02:55:15.200]
Okay, what you need to do

[02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:17.840]
Is you need to bring that shirt back

[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:20.380]
And we'll match it up, we have a lineup

[02:55:20.380 --> 02:55:21.700]
We'll match it up with the

With the other shirts that we have

[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:27.400]
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toy

[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:29.420]
You're saying I can bring the shirt back to me?

[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:31.200]
No, you know what?

[02:55:31.420 --> 02:55:32.000]
Is this the sample?

[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:35.000]
No, I'm starting to like it

[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:36.720]
You're going to keep it as a fact?

[02:55:36.880 --> 02:55:37.640]
I'm going to keep it

[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:39.940]
Because it's a nice book, you know what?

[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:41.720]
It's a nice conversation, please

[02:55:42.380 --> 02:55:43.600]
Okay, cool, okay

Yeah, but as they get older, they all figure out

[02:57:06.480 --> 02:57:10.560]
We're hiding our late ten-seed

I want to make movies for you.

[03:19:06.400 --> 03:19:08.900]
I'm going to play a Hollywood's joke.

[03:19:09.300 --> 03:19:11.860]
Unfortunately, I speak like I had a stroke.

[03:19:12.060 --> 03:19:14.160]
First blood came in 82.

[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:17.160]

[03:19:25.100 --> 03:19:25.460]
My gun.

[03:19:25.860 --> 03:19:28.300]
I did not make this movie with my son.

[03:19:29.300 --> 03:19:32.020]

[03:19:32.020 --> 03:19:33.140]
The tunnel movie.

[03:19:33.200 --> 03:19:35.760]
A little big cash is what I mean.

[03:19:44.300 --> 03:19:46.460]
I guess nobody ever saw Kathleen.

[03:19:47.080 --> 03:19:47.700]

[03:19:48.020 --> 03:19:49.120]
I guess I understand.

[03:19:49.680 --> 03:19:52.060]
My whole life is about to come in.

[03:19:52.460 --> 03:19:54.960]

[03:19:56.800 --> 03:20:01.020]

[03:20:15.040 --> 03:20:17.400]
The only thing I will undo is have sex with a llama.

[03:20:17.840 --> 03:20:20.200]
So give me a break for goodness sake.

[03:20:20.580 --> 03:20:21.560]
I used to be out of opera.

[03:20:21.660 --> 03:20:22.960]
Now I can't get on Ricky Lake.

[03:20:23.300 --> 03:20:25.700]

[03:20:26.020 --> 03:20:27.820]
Basically I'm an unemployed gypsy.

[03:20:28.120 --> 03:20:30.260]
A little bit of cash is what I mean.

[03:20:30.260 --> 03:20:32.860]
I got to get a mole from the follow-through.

[03:20:32.980 --> 03:20:35.580]
I got to have another head movie.

[03:20:35.980 --> 03:20:38.420]
Or a Broadway show like Nellahean.

[03:20:38.660 --> 03:20:40.780]
I guess nobody ever saw Kathleen.

[03:20:41.200 --> 03:20:42.320]
It was stupid.

[03:20:42.700 --> 03:20:43.760]
So I understand.

[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:47.240]
My whole life is about to come in.

[03:20:47.960 --> 03:20:49.920]
Oh, I got left this gentle flame in.

[03:20:51.100 --> 03:20:52.580]

Oh babe, I said let's pop some now.

[03:21:16.960 --> 03:21:20.820]
A fine little pill from all the way.

[03:21:21.200 --> 03:21:22.180]
Can help you.

[03:21:22.180 --> 03:21:24.800]
Oh, sex, that's what to say.

[03:21:25.200 --> 03:21:28.880]
From the egg of a chicken that cools, cluck, cluck.

[03:21:28.960 --> 03:21:32.380]
No yolk, it's a pill it really makes you pluck.

[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:34.240]
Le Bito Bito.

[03:21:35.320 --> 03:21:37.820]

[03:21:39.060 --> 03:21:42.000]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I said Le Bito Bito.

[03:21:43.020 --> 03:21:45.720]
Oh babe, I said let's pop it now.

[03:21:47.940 --> 03:21:51.800]
Every night at 10, you lay like a hand.

[03:21:52.580 --> 03:21:55.600]
Take your pill, then do it again.

[03:21:56.100 --> 03:21:59.480]
Like a Spanish flying Afro-VG act.

[03:22:00.240 --> 03:22:03.380]
And you get used to feathers in the sack.

[03:22:04.100 --> 03:22:05.220]
Le Bito Bito.

[03:22:06.320 --> 03:22:08.920]
Oh babe, I said a pop it now.

[03:22:10.120 --> 03:22:12.960]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I said Le Bito Bito.

[03:22:13.700 --> 03:22:16.860]
Oh babe, I said let's pop some now.

[03:22:17.960 --> 03:22:19.660]
Oh babe, I said let's give a shit of Russia.

[03:22:30.880 --> 03:22:35.260]
The Middle Easter's world will be exploded.

[03:22:35.660 --> 03:22:39.660]
Saddamit people go with the gas that we sold him.

[03:22:39.660 --> 03:22:43.600]
First time aggressor nation and the only one that's growing.

[03:22:44.120 --> 03:22:47.960]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[03:22:48.420 --> 03:22:52.540]
Forget about Korea and the nooks there to humanity.

[03:22:53.280 --> 03:22:59.340]
Right wing is drilling it over and over and to our head.

[03:23:00.520 --> 03:23:02.440]
At Iraq has sunk.

[03:23:03.300 --> 03:23:05.820]
Fampons of master's destruction.

[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:19.040]
Three thousand people killed.

[03:23:19.500 --> 03:23:22.560]
Are now forgotten, let's exploit them instead.

[03:23:23.100 --> 03:23:25.200]
Hey, there's oil to be caught in.

[03:23:25.520 --> 03:23:27.260]
Going after Saddam too.

[03:23:27.820 --> 03:23:29.000]
Plankato Sama.

[03:23:29.440 --> 03:23:31.480]
There's no longer mention of.

[03:23:31.760 --> 03:23:35.620]
It's a name in law that's but no one seems concerned all.

[03:23:35.620 --> 03:23:41.340]
Come be in complacence, believe in every word of this cartel administration.

[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:44.260]
That control this white bear through me day.

[03:23:44.420 --> 03:23:52.840]
I'm a manipulation and a right wing is drilling it over and over and to our heads.

[03:23:53.760 --> 03:23:55.620]
At Iraq has sunk.

[03:23:56.500 --> 03:23:59.120]
Fampons of master's destruction.

[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:14.000]
The loss of civil rights is the right that we're paying.

[03:24:14.340 --> 03:24:17.960]
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.

[03:24:18.540 --> 03:24:19.900]
I have nothing to hide.

[03:24:20.380 --> 03:24:22.160]
Tables, pockets, all are saying.

[03:24:22.560 --> 03:24:26.020]
Lino-pedian cattle don't have any reservation.

[03:24:26.860 --> 03:24:30.540]
Out of provoked, battle, and world annihilation.

[03:24:30.540 --> 03:24:36.580]
Old regime must fall in half a virgin installed with no objection at all.

[03:24:36.860 --> 03:24:46.840]
Then the craft don't have the fall and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to operate wash pants.

[03:24:46.840 --> 03:24:48.660]
I rack has sunk.

[03:24:49.280 --> 03:24:52.120]
Fampons of master's destruction.

[03:24:53.180 --> 03:24:56.720]
Booth, only I rack has sunk.

[03:24:57.600 --> 03:25:00.280]
Fampons of master's destruction.

[03:25:04.840 --> 03:25:06.940]
Bye bye bye!

[03:25:07.540 --> 03:25:11.660]
The new Roger Show un-fines into the NQA and might be for Lino.

[03:25:12.060 --> 03:25:12.900]
The Cubs start.
