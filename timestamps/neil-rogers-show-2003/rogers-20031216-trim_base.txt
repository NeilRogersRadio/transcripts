[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660]
A

[00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.900]
Stance of power, Menor covers over this performance by the Dolphins

[00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.260]
Nobody move, I'm your football player, don't you make a sound? I'm just gonna wake you up and leave quietly

[00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.400]
Don't let this happen to you. Today's National Football League Cracket athletes are above the law

[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.600]
Protect your family from the horrors of unwanted NFL players in your home

[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.600]
With the new Miami Dolphin Home Alarm System

[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:53.680]
Every Miami Dolphin Home Alarm System comes with a jury Johnson's seal of disapproval

[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.940]
I never met a criminal, I didn't lag and if they can catch the ball or run with the ball, why?

[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.580]
There's something special! Take criminal athletes off the field and put them in a jail cell where they usually find God and the wife names I wrote

[00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.100]
The Miami Dolphin Home Alarm System, the seal will go crack deeper for the jail

[00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.440]
It's the 10-0-1 at 5-60 WQA, and it's a very sad Tuesday in South Florida

[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400]
And it's sad, don't you feel like you just want to commit suicide?

[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.560]
You just want to blow your brains out?

[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.420]
Nope, I don't either

[00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.920]
Nice, on-site kick like I said, Olen de Mare

[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.300]
He just kicked him a little bit sideways these days, he's kicking side-settle

[00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.200]
And it's just like a... I mean, there was no chance that we're gonna get even in the game anyway

[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.420]
But there was like one last gasp, a little bit of hope

[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.740]
And why should they gotten back in it? Because all the Dolphin fans, those so-called fans left anyway

[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.200]
Seven minutes to go in the game, they're down by a touchdown at that point

[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.080]
That's before the Eagles kicked that last field rule, they're down by a seven

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.480]
And everybody went and bailed out of there like they had a bomb scare at P.P. Park

[00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.240]
And then they're calling in Joe this morning, whining, well gee, there's nobody left but Eagles fans there

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.380]
Well, I wonder why? Don't tell me that you folks weren't some of the ones that left there with seven minutes to go in the game

[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.560]
But at any rate, it's the same, you know, the expression neurotic repetition

[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.760]
It's the same with South Florida sports, except for the Marlins

[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.100]
In fact, even the World Series, I guess, was neurotic repetition

[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.040]
Because nobody cared all year just like 97

[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.360]
And then all of a sudden, just everybody jumped on that bandwagon right at the end

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.420]
Right at the end, right at the end

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.580]
It's the same thing with this

[00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.000]
Anyway, getting back to the important stuff, how about that strong thermon?

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.360]
Right! Didn't know the old guy handed in him

[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.440]
Have you seen that story?

[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:32.240]
Yes

[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.820]
About his mixed race daughter, one of the great segregationists of all time

[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.160]
Yup

[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.920]
And he was banging some darky lady, well anyway, we're getting banned

[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.400]
Here's the results from my yesterday's pool

[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.200]
I think because it's a holiday season, because I got like this little scratch

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.700]
I must say though that for an old fart like me, I made nice recovery

[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.080]
You must have been thinking for sure that you were going to get to do the show today

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.500]
Nope

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.660]
You weren't?

[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.940]
No

[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.640]
Because I was right on the edge of a real bad head, cold

[00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.720]
I knew you'd pull it through

[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.600]
I pulled it

[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.120]
Right through the window

[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.660]
I dragged it in here

[00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.160]
And it brought me back to life

[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.120]
What's your take on the capture of Sodom who's saying we asked yesterday?

[00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.880]
We broke all records, mine, and the last number I looked at when we got out here

[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.980]
I remember we couldn't get the thing to sit still because there were so many people on the website

[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.320]
It was a 904

[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.880]
I looked at like 944 about a minute after 2, 944

[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.280]
That was shocking

[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.920]
Breaking even those alien records, how do you like that?

[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.780]
Okay, breaking poor little alienito's records of hysteria and foaming it to mouth in his audience

[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.880]
1674 votes for a weekday pool, that may be also right in the, I don't know, maybe Erkencheck, I doubt it

[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.220]
What's your take on the capture of Sodom who's saying it's fine, but where's Osama?

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.140]
Remember him?

[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.180]
Osama Yamama

[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:45.740]
563 votes for that

[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.780]
The whole invasion was bogus based on lies

[00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.360]
Can't believe he's going to change his ways

[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.240]
No, you're not

[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.560]
544 votes on that

[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.140]
Whole Iraq attack was bogus

[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.800]
That's one small step for humanity in one giant political leap for George W. Bush 295

[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.280]
Fry the bastard on Channel 7, fry Sodom on Channel 7 right in, with Spooky's the right pool in the switch

[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.280]
168, Spooky's the right was there, he probably would beg in for it

[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.080]
And no matter the cost, it was well worth it only 105, 6.2%

[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080]
Guess who Chris Matthews on hardballs which I never watch

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.920]
But I was a Channel surf me for the football last night

[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.500]
Guess who Chris Matthews made look like a real asshole

[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.140]
Who's that?

[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.660]
Oi

[00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.340]
Julie Berman

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.980]
Man he had him stammering and fumping and bumbling it was great

[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.840]
And he refused to answer the questions like he asked him about how come we were buddies with Sodom back in the 80s and yadda yadda yadda he was the good guy

[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.320]
And he kept changing the subject

[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.800]
But I beat, but I bop, but I bop

[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.880]
Julie Berman you were disgrace really are and all you old Jews down there that are supporting him just because of the fact that he ate

[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.160]
He ate a couple of pieces of humankind a few years ago

[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.080]
That's really sad

[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.060]
That's pathetic

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.560]
Just because he had some grubbinus once in his life, you ever have grubbinus?

[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.460]
Uh no

[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.240]
You have never had grubbinus?

[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.720]
No

[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.420]
Oh come on

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.520]
What is that?

[00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.340]
It's like, uh, I don't even know how to describe it, it's poison, it will definitely kill you

[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.260]
But it's like chicken fat, like fried chicken fat

[00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.540]
I'll pass on that one

[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.840]
Huh?

[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.740]
I'll pass

[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.600]
No, I don't know what the, what the, oh, you, no you like it

[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.380]
Believe me what I tell you

[00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.460]
Although it will make you crap your brains out for hours, it keep you busy, keep you out of clearance

[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.000]
And the good news is the Beast God is new king cruel bed from battle, my friends

[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.840]
Let's hear it, he said that he, he and Clarence had a wild time

[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.080]
I'm the new mattress last night, now were you the king, Coral or the queen, Coral?

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.720]
Oh, I'm definitely the man, the king

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.720]
You the man?

[00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.740]
That's what Clarence said, he said the beast, he the man

[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.700]
Now all we got to quit screwing around right now because before we give him today's pool

[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.820]
And now I'm going to play a lot of stuff today and take a lot of calls

[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.800]
I wonder if people ripped the dolphins today, wouldn't you love to hear that for four hours?

[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.160]
Yeah

[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.400]
I love it, it's the same crap every year, you know?

[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.120]
If it gets a little old, stale

[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.880]
All the belly aching and oj feedlers sucks and they've wadds that sucks and this one sucks

[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.920]
And what's with those dreadlocks Ricky and all that other crap, you know

[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.220]
He, I never realized until last night just how grotesque looking he is

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.800]
He really is gruesome

[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.720]
Boy

[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.400]
Not that it would make any difference, and him and edgy, and of course that's a U.M. thing, that edgy thing, right?

[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.860]
That's a hurricane thing, which you don't want to get into

[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:27.640]
Because you're a pipe, you mean edgy?

[00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.980]
We are going to spend an hour ripping microzenthal today

[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.140]
Nobody's sipped the beast and I know who the hell that is

[00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.800]
I'm in newstime, it's 322 WVN time

[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.580]
You made a mistake, Neil, you made a mistake

[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.480]
We're going to rip budgero keach and microzenthal today, it's a little on the inside hurricane kind of crap

[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.100]
No, we're not

[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.880]
You're just jealous of microzenthal because of the fact that he's a big success now

[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.180]
He's a big superstar, what does he do?

[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.600]
I believe he's a math teacher

[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.320]
He's a math teacher, oh a perfect math teacher, please don't tell me he has a wife

[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.920]
I don't know

[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.540]
Does he have a penis? I sure doubt it

[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.060]
Anyway, we got to figure out we're going to have the van hit today

[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.020]
We got 47,500 bucks

[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.860]
Now did Miguel ever show his lovely ass in air and tell you that we got this other thing straightened out

[00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.160]
No, no

[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.080]
The other thing from yesterday?

[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.480]
Well he said yesterday that he would, he said just disregard it

[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.960]
I don't know why he did that

[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.420]
Oh and also we got to rip Carlos, now there's so many Carlos's in that place

[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:31.840]
We're not talking about Carlos the freak that sits out at the reception desk

[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.820]
There's an embarrassment to all of us even Susan Lucci hates him like poison

[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:40.460]
But and we're not talking about Carlos Beener boy who they dragged out of there on an intensive care somewhere

[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.760]
With tubes hooked up to his ass we're talking about what is what's Carlos's last name do we know?

[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:46.580]
Picari

[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:48.620]
Carlos Picari

[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.280]
Carlos Picari you are a total asshole man you are the ultimate asshole

[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.660]
I don't even know if I've ever seen him or ever laid eyes on him

[00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:59.020]
I doubtful doubtful

[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.360]
I'll tell you this I don't want to see him

[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.000]
Every single time

[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.340]
Every time Lisi's consistent he's consistently an asshole

[00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.980]
Every time we have like multiple ball games

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.300]
On this radio station which is how many times a month does that happen?

[00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.200]
About third man

[00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:17.020]
They're in that studio right there where your fat ass is sitting staining that chair

[00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.420]
It's probably seeping all over that chair

[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.040]
And he's in there dicking around with stuff

[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.240]
And as a result the next morning when we try to get on with a show

[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.400]
Since we don't do our show the same place as the sports shows

[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.720]
We can't get the damn thing going same thing again this morning

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.520]
Doppin game and a Panther game on what was it 1890 on AM dialects that the Panthers lost

[00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:38.780]
It was on the surf

[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.660]
If you go up like the 2500 on your AM dog you might be able to hear it but I doubt it

[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:45.840]
And so we have all this different crap going on at the same time

[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.500]
Because naturally it's the only way they can ever make enough money to pay me

[00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.280]
So anyway they're in there dicking around, dicking around

[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.520]
I come in this morning I'm sitting here and I'm not as early as when George is here

[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.400]
In fact I'm getting I'm trying to get in the smart

[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.860]
What do I need to be here at 7 30 in the morning for?

[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.940]
Well what's the point for that?

[00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.400]
Get caught in the seat or something?

[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.860]
No seriously what do I mean?

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.260]
I mean my bedroom is like six feet away from the studio here

[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.540]
What do I need to drag my ass in here 7 30 in the morning to confabulate with the little guava love and spick every morning?

[00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.120]
I don't need that

[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.340]
So this is a lot better I come I come crawling in here about 8 30

[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.500]
That's fine and I'm listening they got they got the little dog is on there

[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:26.620]
It's loud enough that the damn the speakers are bouncing off the walls here

[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.540]
That's how loud he was

[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.580]
I thought his gigantic head was going to come popping right through this board

[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.620]
And I'm sure that Josh was probably trying to talk to me and I couldn't hear him and the beast but a beep but a boop but about

[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.020]
And it took about 20 minutes to try to unearth everything that Carlos Vicari left there screwed up again

[00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:50.140]
Every single time he does it no matter how much we complain and carry on with Duff and with Clarence and all the other middle level flunkies in there

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.000]
It doesn't do any good

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.080]
Because see what's important on QA is not that he or

[00:09:54.080 --> 00:10:08.000]
Roger show not the ratings not the money what's important is ball games that's what's important ball games the more balls the more games the more excited they are that's what Greg reads all about because he's he's he's not a dumb jock he's just a dumb jock sniffer is what he is

[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.080]
I think that Greg in spite of all of his womanizing I think that Greg probably somewhere inside of his psyche is probably a closet moog

[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.540]
Absolutely because he sure likes them the guys with John straps he probably would like to shower with the teams is what I'm thinking

[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:31.980]
But get that Carlos Vicari out of our studio at least put stuff back together again the way you left it now what was his comment to you?

[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.540]
He just wanted to you know make sure that everything was fine because he wasn't sure if he left it okay

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:46.920]
Yeah, you left it all right you left it the same screwed up like you always leave it okay coming in your pocket around with everything you get your hands on and then you just leave it like a mess like a turl it

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:56.720]

Yeah, I guess it's okay like to find your way around in the dark if there's like a little beam of light you can always use your head as a reflector but other net it looks like crap if you want to look younger and better than you ever dreamed again there's one guy ought to be called that's my good buddy Chuck Alphiari in fact it's a holiday time I give yourself the gift of here this holiday season called Chuck and get that natural hairline system it's the best there is it's as simple as that you don't have to make a big song to dance about it everybody and their brothers try to probably a some kind of a mousey looking muskrat piece like the one you know who wears absolutely although I do you know I thought about it I like

[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.140]
begged up straight to the bone

[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:12.240]
grandma's now right out of action in a hospital she sits after a body is in traction

[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.940]
and she even needs a nurse to take us back

[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.240]
grandma got run over at the Walmart

[00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.340]
travel under shoppers greedy feet

[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.140]

[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:05.380]
yeah that's right the words of Moe and Geltie they've been very

[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:11.180]
absolutely lucky those 10-2 words and of course Moe had to get his beauty rest this morning so he certainly wasn't in

[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.940]
no mad dog either no mad dog today saw my skates well you're either buddy must have worn him out last night

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:18.860]
it'll be a jog boob shambi

[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:23.040]
the boob my steer maybe we can get boob on a hotline for another 30 seconds like those

[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.120]
civilating calls during the Amarlands parade their world serious victory

[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.140]
let's see the boob steer how come I have is he going to be a chulas or is he going to be in a studio

[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.060]
that I don't know heck my studio though

[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.860]
I beg your pardon?

[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.180]
heck will be in studio

[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:40.540]
oh this this schedule is all screwed around man you've must have worn clearance out he's just way behind the eight balls

[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:41.980]
he just ain't doing it

[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.280]
one thing I will say though about the boob steer

[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.300]
you like him a lot

[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:50.180]
he's got quite a good one here

[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.180]
we like boob and like

[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.020]
and pasty complexion he's a good guy

[00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:58.880]
unfortunately he has to work in fact this would be a great day maybe he'll call in now in a

[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.160]
bat line and he and I can discuss what it's like to work with Dave and boring

[00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:03.620]
oh

[00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:11.040]
I don't think he could be doing any crossovers with me again at any time if he fills an 8 to 10 like he did that one day

[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.880]
I should apologize

[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.280]
now I go to apologize no it was fun

[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.900]
it was a lot of fun because I put him on a spot I kept pretending just like you

[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:22.700]
Lieberman did last I with Chris Matthews and hardballs he kept pretending he didn't hear the question

[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.580]
and he kept talking about anything else beside the obvious

[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.760]
now sir see I can understand why you stuck up to Joseph Gacky

[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.720]
because like Dave and boring he's an ice guy I like to war a lot but he's terrible on the air he's awful

[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.760]
but you can't say that because you have to work with him and you want to cover your ass

[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.540]
you don't be like another micro zenthal

[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:42.860]
but as far as Dave and boring what have you got to a benefit by sucking his ass

[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:49.820]
nothing so why can't you just no no no don't start doing it George

[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:54.400]
they in pain a little that ain't going to fly this week okay that's bullcraft that's a cop out

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.560]
or speaking of cop out Dave the cop can give it a rest for this hysterical facts about the pot laws

[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.680]
and you can do this and they can arrest you if they put you over the drugs even if the drugs aren't yours

[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.880]
and all of a sudden you know something it's a holidays man just lighten up a little bit Dave the cop

[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.660]
out of control as usual calm down now where we're going to do the van hit today I love it at this point

[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:20.860]
I love it at this point I beg your pardon me girls all upset he says on his way he's very very upset today

[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:25.960]
I've said about one he's like yelling at you yelling at me oh about the ball game last night is that what it is

[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:30.400]
very angry or maybe he got cut off by his lovely wife last night maybe she cut it off

[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.340]
maybe she finally wise up or maybe somebody else quartered him in a hole and said get her off the suspended list

[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:43.980]
or she's going to attack him again she's still on the on the VL the SL we have an SL it's not this bedelist it's the schmit list

[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.040]
I can't mention it's the Reno so where is it it's on its way to wear

[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.420]
and what is that that you're playing what is that you just sent you a fact but it's going to be Scott Jr

[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:00.340]
yeah Scott Jr is going to be out there with batteries I think he's going to be hiding in his back home

[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:06.140]
yeah he's going to be rolling him around in his hands he couldn't find any steel balls like in the canine mutiny

[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:10.300]
so he's rolling little batteries around in his hand crazy person Scott Jr you're really

[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.300]
enjoying it a kick out of looking at him just if you don't want to give us any money for a van and pay rescue

[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:22.060]
just stand outside the van and stare at him would that be fun oh and you'll never make eye contact anyway

[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:27.180]
because you want to look back at you oh I see so in other words we've I don't get this I don't understand this at all

[00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:33.320]
so in other words we've been lied to again we've been lied to again I thought this was a place of our choosing they didn't you

[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.320]
it says next van hit tomorrow 11 to 2 somewhere that was yesterday's memo so I look at it today

[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.980]
Scott Jr. knew the two in the parking lot at the crossway we've been in cross brings to God damn much

[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:50.560]
there's no money up there they got a horizon break was going to go with this toy drive so that's what they were promoting last night

[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:58.700]
so I figured we just go there so in other words again we're just tagging along no they don't just we're just an afterthought just like with a ball games

[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:04.500]
with Carlos Picare there whatever the hell is name and same kind of crap I mean I realized we're not as important as the

[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:12.260]
Panther Red Wing game on 14 90 on our AM dollar whatever 1980 on the dial on a station it's got 45 watts that go straight up into the

[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:17.460]
year that nobody ever heard of before that we don't even know the collars of anymore that used to be WSRF back a hundred years ago

[00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:25.440]
when band Patrick of the lions put it on the year did you know that by the way uh van Patrick the late great uh football now

[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:32.000]
so the detour lines he was the one that put WSRF on the air for a lot of now I know Dan Patrick many years ago

[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.160]
I'm turning the demolition to Dan Patrick van Patrick who used to call them the Philadelphia Eagles he was he was a big fat guy

[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:45.280]
he was good I mean he was no more Howard David but thank God well who is really nobody and we're really he's one of a kind man

[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.500]
after they made him they threw them all the way it was pretty moldy after they made that muskrat they threw the moldy thing away

[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:58.660]
well I bet you can't wait to see him again and bond with him tomorrow morning you must they must leave something out of your life when he is and they like today after a tough loss like last night

[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:05.960]
and the most recent there for you like you know scowl at in the morning I can't wait do you like make eye contact with him is there ever any conversation

[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:13.560]
no he won't talk to me well wait a minute how about when you ever talk to him I'll be kind of a conversation with him

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:19.720]
well you're really what a guy in fact you probably should say boy I see the papers what a guy on Sunday what happened last night

[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:30.020]
mo that would be good mo and the rumor I'm here and speaking of mo is that because we got all this problem with we don't even know if Joe Rose is going to be stay on or not

[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:37.540]
that they're thinking I hope it doesn't happen it's going to be when when guilty move up to Joe Rose it's going to be the big with him

[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:55.640]
okay now it could be the mo oh show but that just never into it so it might be the almost show I'm a homo no homo not homo I'm a homo no you know and then we can have the mad dog between the tub and the shrub or however that goes what was it the the toad and the load

[00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:03.660]
I like that mo he's come up with some pretty good material lately that's not time too late I think the trend or anything but what do you want to do

[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:10.580]
I beg your pardon that to rush you or anything but what do you want to do what do I want to do with what you want to go here to Coral Springs or you want to go somewhere else

[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.220]
do you understand what this man is talking about?

[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:21.940]
Scott Jr. why do you want me to send him sir I thought this was a done deal already I thought this was another one of your

[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.020]
a rakeoffs that somebody's shmaring you with which is usually what it is like that other bogey thing that you set up

[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:35.020]
about that in the sports or whatever that thing was you use me read the bottom of the page there the bottom of what page I'm trying to get what I can

You want to do that again?

[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:02.100]
Couldn't hurt.

[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:03.960]
No, I don't think so.

[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:05.140]
I don't think so.

[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.540]
How about the corner of sunrise and university?

[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:10.320]
Okay.

[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:10.720]
Okay.

[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.880]
What is that gas station?

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.920]
There is a shell station.

[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:14.360]
The shell is at Broward University.

[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.460]
What's the one on the corner?

[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.040]
I think it's also at Shell, isn't it?

[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:17.940]
Yeah, sure.

[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:18.200]
Why not?

[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:19.500]
It sounds like that.

[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.640]
Whatever it is on the northeast corner of sunrise and university.

[00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.600]
There's a gas station.

[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.080]
Look for the QM van there from 11 to 2.

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.800]
Why don't you just send me to Loots?

[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:29.220]
That wouldn't be bad.

[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:30.040]
Only one way to get there.

[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:30.420]
You leave me now.

[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.580]
So he'll be there when he gets there.

[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.840]
He'll be there when he gets there from 11 to 2.

[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.480]
We got 47.5.

[00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.540]
We want to get to that 50 grand before this week is out.

[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.500]
We're going to be really pissed.

[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.380]
Peace out, old man.

[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:39.840]
Pizza?

[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.060]
Play off this.

[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:42.980]
Ow!

[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:43.960]
Good morning.

[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:49.120]
This is former vice president and is in the inner of the inner of the

[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:49.940]
Al Gore.

[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:55.980]
I'm here to set the record straight about my endorsement of Democratic

[00:23:55.980 --> 00:23:58.880]
Presidential candidate, Jane Steen.

[00:23:59.060 --> 00:23:59.600]
It's Howard.

[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.180]
Bob-Bob Bowie.

[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:01.940]
Bowie.

[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.620]
The 13th is the Maithing Orator and Ward Smith.

[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.300]
Not to mention, he makes a fine sausage.

[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:11.460]
That's not him.

[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.680]
A former governor for Mont and winner of the prestigious Michael

[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.700]
Thurup-Gusling Contest.

[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.800]
Never happened.

[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:25.540]
Apparently, I have ruffled some feathers in the Democratic party.

[00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.700]
Specifically, with my former running mate, Hal Lieberstein.

[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:31.460]
It's Joe Lieberman.

[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.620]
If there's one man in the donkey party that's even more whining and monotone than me,

[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.560]
it's Jim Lieberman.

[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:47.240]
When I pulled this endorsement from my secret lock box, I did so after much

[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.940]
consideration, thought, and a game of rock paper scissors.

[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:59.960]
If Mr. Lieberman is heard that I am sorry, but John Shaw, Landon Burr, Lieberman

[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.560]
must realize I'm a sharp political mind whose choices to shape our nation's

[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.180]
leaders are important.

[00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.100]
You lost me.

[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:11.140]
In conclusion, let me say this to Mr. Lano-Witt.

[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:11.960]
Lieberman.

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.000]
And Mr. Bean.

[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:13.620]
Bean.

[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.780]
I love you both, like a gay man would, but without the rumpular inflation.

[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:19.860]
I think we're done here.

[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.140]
Now, of course, viewers, Arizona and have no affiliation with the Democratic National Committee to elect the president.

[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:24.620]
Welcome.

[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.600]
1034-560-W2.

[00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.720]
And by the way, we've got the appall Kurgman's story on our website this morning.

[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.320]
These people are keep faxing stories that we already have on our website.

[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:36.240]
It's kind of like, thank you so much, but yes, I read the New York Times.

[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.320]
Thank you.

[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:38.060]
Assholes.

[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.320]
Here's today's poll, which we already got a bunch of votes on here.

[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.400]
How do you think the capture of Saddamal affected 2004 election?

[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.320]
Five choices for you.

[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.240]
Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead.

[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.260]
It's too early to tell.

[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.360]
Lots of Schmidt happens.

[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:53.820]
No difference.

[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.760]
The Democrats are way behind the eight ball.

[00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:57.460]
That's what I voted.

[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.840]
They better get there a crap together.

[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.220]
Or Bush is in.

[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:01.500]
He's in.

[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.720]
Like Dan Rather said, game set and snatch or something like that.

[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.100]
He said Sunday morning.

[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.780]
Hey, Dan, book up a little bit.

[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:08.320]
You asshole.

[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.180]
God, I'm staring at whatever little respect I had for him, which wasn't very much.

[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.540]
I'm starting to lose it all real fast.

[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.620]
Just like whatever little respect I had for a carless for Curie.

[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.820]
Which I have no idea who he is.

[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.260]
Here's the result.

[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.760]
So far, how do you think the capture of Saddamal affect the election?

[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.040]
122 votes, while I wasn't even looking.

[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.480]
It's too early to tell.

[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.460]
Lots of Schmidt happened.

[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:27.940]
60.

[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:30.360]
The Democrats are way behind the eight ball.

[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:30.800]
21.

[00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:31.600]
That's right.

[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:31.960]

[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:32.900]
Right.

[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.340]
Correct answer.

[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.540]
Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead.

[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:36.980]
20.

[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.020]
The interesting thing is not only doesn't it seem to put him far ahead.

[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:45.260]
For those of us who are praying that we don't have to go through four more years of fascism.

[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:49.320]
But that big rally, that Saddam rally, like yesterday, the decision will right out.

[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:50.660]
Markets actually went down a little bit.

[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.240]
Anyway, a big boost for Bush puts him far ahead.

[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:53.580]
20.

[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.540]
Bush is in.

[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:55.100]
14.

[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:56.840]
And no difference.

[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.600]
Seven out of 122 votes.

[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:06.140]
Strom Thurman, one of the great segregationists of all time, a racist goofball bastard who died last year at the age of 100.

[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:15.700]
The late Senator Strom Thurman's family yesterday said it acknowledges a California woman's claim that she is his illegitimate mixed-raced daughter.

[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:18.840]
Her lawyer said the statement brought her a sigh of relief.

[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.920]
As Strom Thurman has passed away, cannot speak from self-thurman family acknowledges Miss S.E. May Washington, Williams claimed or heard it.

[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.000]
Miss S.E. May.

[00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.320]
Oh, that sound like something from Gond with your wind.

[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:33.620]
Huh?

[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.460]
I mean, now it's like Laquicia and names like that.

[00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.940]
Who had I ever heard of S.E. May?

[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.100]
We hope this act has been a bring closure from his Williams, the family's lawyer, Jay Mark Taylor said in a brief statement.

[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:51.620]
Contacted as Orifist Taylor confirmed he was speaking for the Thurman family, but refused to give detail answer or any questions, including whether the family was in fact verifying the claims of Williams.

[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:59.500]
A 78-year-old retired teacher lives in Los Angeles. I guess back in those days in the day, L.S.E. May was like a more popular name than Laquicia.

[00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.340]
The interesting part of this whole deal is where the hell is it?

[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:12.680]
In seven decades of politics, Thurman gained fame and infamy as an art segregationist, but later came to support a holiday for Slainsel rightfully to Martin Luther King.

[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.240]
When he became seen, I once started drooling a lot on the center floor.

[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:26.080]
Williams claims Thurman fathered her with now listen to this. When he was a 22-year-old living in his parents' home in Edgefield, her mother, Carrie Butler, had been working as a maid in the Thurman's home.

[00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:28.660]
Guess how old the mother was when he knocked her up?

[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.140]
Hold.

[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.460]
Sixteen.

[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:34.920]
Huh?

[00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:38.500]
Sixteen.

[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:48.660]
Here is a right-wing, of course he's dead now. I hope he's rotten in hell. I hope the worms are really having a good, uh, field day.

[00:28:50.720 --> 00:29:00.780]
Right-wing, holier than thou, miserable, bigoted, nasty rotten, racist son of a bitch, strom Thurman, and he had knocked up this chick, this black girl, she was 16 years old.

[00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.200]
How young is too young?

[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.560]
So I don't want to say he was like a hypocrite, but at least the one good thing is he's a dead hypocrite.

[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:13.000]
Strom Thurman, you phony bastard, you're all the same, they're all doing it.

[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.800]
The only difference is that some people admit doing it and some people are too stupid to cover it up like take the dress to the cleaners.

[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:29.440]
Anyway, let's see, also we got Joe Costello of night 739-30 at the glory hul- the glory days grill, 4746 North Congress Avenue. That sounds like Palm Beach to me.

[00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.780]
Doesn't even say where the hell it is. Is that in Bointin? Yeah, I think it's in Bointin.

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:42.740]
Man, I'll tell you, I know it's the holidays, but boy, some people, of course some of you else under a lot of stress with what's your name being on a suspended list.

[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:46.940]
4746 North, when you stop playing that, what the hell is that?

[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:52.180]
Well, that one I know, but what's that other thing you're playing? That I was the same thing.

[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.560]
It sounds like you're spinning a draped long clarences ass.

[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.720]
He was just in here, actually.

[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:04.780]
40s that were doing what? Nice job on the schedule, by the way, Clarence Van, you really must be worn out from last night's breakin' into that new king-crawled bed with a beast.

[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:12.660]
You must have worn his ass out. And by the way, can I ask you that question? The dancer wanted to know, can you describe to us just how smelly the hole is?

[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:22.580]
I say that because I'm never gonna let that thing go. I can't believe it. That's journalism, baby. That's America for it. A brilliant journalism.

[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:29.860]
Can you imagine on the BBC one of those distinguished reporters saying, can you explain to us just exactly how smelly that hole is that you're standing by?

[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:36.700]
And I love the way that all these assholes from the various networks, the photo ops that gave them a tendency to see them all crawling down into the hole.

[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.000]
Yeah, Robert's an un-CNN.

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.860]
Right, crawling into the spider hole.

[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:41.980]
Man.

[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:51.160]
Anyway, so Joe and I will be a 739-30 de-Glory Days Grill, 4746 North Congress Avenue in Pointe and Peach, with our best idea which you won't get any money for that.

[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:56.480]
But drop off donations for their toy drive to make them feel better like somebody cares. So that's the agenda today.

[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:00.420]
Scott is gonna be at that gas station momentarily. We better raise some serious hopes for that.

[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:03.080]
He hasn't left yet. Why not?

[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.940]
I don't know. He's in here right now. I'll give him the CD.

[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:11.460]
Get out of there. You geek, you jerk, you clown, you idiot. Get out. When it doubt, get the hell out.

[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:12.760]
Man.

[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.040]
Pointe in the right direction. Okay, spin him around like a dreidel and pointe in the right direction to kick his ass out the door.

[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.740]
20 to 11 at 5. See if we're gonna take a lot of calls today. Maybe we're gonna take a thousand calls.

[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.700]
A third, man.

[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:29.380]
Before two o'clock today. Make no mistake about that. We got the abook steer for my dog.

[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:35.480]
My dog's probably like to look in his wounds after last night. Anyway, I would think. Can you imagine the embarrassment and humiliation?

[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:45.120]
I will say this that they they made it a game. You know what I mean? I didn't expect that because the Eagles are a far superior team and they made it a game.

[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.660]
It was pretty entertaining and when it was 24 24, I thought, well, let's say, you know, they could look out, but did they look out? No.

[00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:50.940]
No.

[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.280]
Because the cream rises to the top. You know what I'm saying? Just like when the papers were played in those two times.

[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:03.120]
They had their chances. Couldn't do it. They choked. You could hear those gagging and choking sounds all over North America.

[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:11.920]
It's that great time of the year. Unless, of course, you have to go shopping and get those last minute of holiday gifts. You have to fight with everybody out there in the roads in the stores, the lines, the parking.

[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:16.000]
Make your gift giving a lot easier this year for you. And the ones you love a gift certificate from.

[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.400]
File a mattress. Call them right now at 1-800 mattress. Give the gift of a taking you for a year and a year out and night in and night out.

[00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:29.460]
The other mattress has got gifts and certificates in any denomination. Don't forget they got all the top brands in the world including now Sterns and Foster.

They got the guaranteed lowest prices anywhere in the world on Sterns and bananas Foster.

[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.900]
And a beast and clearest last night broke in their new king coiled bed from the other mattress. Did they show up on time?

[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.660]
On time took five minutes took out the old bed. It was great.

[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:49.860]
Took away the stained nasty smelly soil bedding with all that food. You can imagine the food stains on the beast bed. Oh my god.

[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:55.840]
They took all the crap away set up the brand new one and he was ready for a really hot night after the ball game and maybe at halftime with clearance.

U. A. M. Women.

[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:44.700]
Well, Buffalo has a football team the greatest in the land and everybody thinks they're great.

[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:51.060]
I'm daily. The Buffalo bills on and out for once. See what I mean. So just sing.

[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:59.260]
When you say Miami when you say Buffalo Super Bowl and near the Buffalo Bells Buffalo Bells.

[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:03.580]
Degraders team and the history of human race.

[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.340]
Buffalo Bells.

[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.320]
Degraders.

[00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.040]
Since sliced bread and canned beer.

[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:17.080]
Yeah, there you go. And you and your chance up that redneck stuff.

[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:24.360]
Listen, that banjo holy sweet god. Listen, that we say Buffalo bills and don't sound so redneck. He do it.

[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:30.280]
Everybody's single or now. Are you bill fed? Here we go.

[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.960]
Well, the Buffalo bills are the best team. They have the best record over the last five years.

[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:42.280]
And they went to the Super Bowl four times, which is what I can say for this scum sucking vision and their ad the greatest.

[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.560]
Because I really like that uniforms. They sure is hell beat the heck out of having a fish on the helmet.

[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:53.560]
But because they're Buffalo home bills. The best football teams.

[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.900]
What I ever seen in the history of my life. They are the Buffalo bills.

[00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:05.100]
The Buffalo bills. The whole of young Kelly. The greatest quarter back in the league.

[00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.600]
Yeah, everybody. The Buffalo bills. They're the Buffalo bills.

[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:17.320]
And they've been around longer than the stinkin' rotten fish. Well, they're the Buffalo bills.

[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.560]
Buffalo bills. What would you rather have as a pet a Buffalo or a fish?

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.380]
1047 and 560 WQM. Thank you, PR Ralph. We're reminding me to play that. Get everybody whipped up for Sunday.

[00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:34.700]
He also mentions that he's got a good point on the Northeast corner of Sunrise University as a Chevron. That's what I was afraid of.

[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:40.640]
On the Southwest corner is that shell station. And you'll have more traffic at Shell because they're always busy and they have crispy cream donuts.

[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.540]
All right. That should do it. Kago.

[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:51.180]
Let me say it again. Let's do the shell station on the Southwest corner of Sunrise and University.

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:53.080]
Okay. Is that where we're going?

[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:54.640]
Chats of Scott, Jr. gets that right.

[00:35:55.920 --> 00:36:00.980]
Get whether it's Scott, you jackass. Well, let me face it. If there's crispy creams, they'll find it.

[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.020]
Okay. We got 171 votes on a poll up here, which I only mentioned at one time.

[00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:07.280]
Man, there must be something going on. You think there is? I don't know.

[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.640]
How do you think the capture is Sodom will affect the 2004 election?

[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.500]
It's totally the tell lots of Schmidt happens. 78.

[00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.800]
The Democrats are way behind the eighth ball. 34.

[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:27.100]
Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead. 27. Bush is in 21. No difference. Only 11. Only 11 people say they're going to make no difference.

[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:27.980]
We'll see.

[00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:35.640]
But a lot of Schmidt came happen. That's for sure. Let's see. Here's the fact. New Jersey.

[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:38.100]
It wasn't in New Jersey by the way. It was in Pennsylvania, but you're close.

[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.200]
The big bear how I see it. New Jersey's big bear hunt ended with 328 confirm kills.

[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:48.460]
Vice President Dick Taney reportedly killed more than 70 farm raised ring that presence during a canned hunt.

[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.260]
That was in Pennsylvania. We had that story on. I thought this was like something new and different.

[00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.060]
Now again, thank you. We had on days ago. Days ago, I talked about that.

[00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:01.180]
Jesus, God almighty. President Lincoln still hasn't seen the second act of the play yet.

[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:09.160]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18th. Guess what else we're going to have to chew on this week besides those trends coming out Thursday?

[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.320]
That's a one o'clock Thursday. So we won't really be able to it. You're regulated about that till Friday at length.

[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.880]
Formal charges against Michael Michael expected this week.

[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.540]
Formal charges against pop star Michael Jackson. We filed late Thursday or early Friday.

[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:31.160]
The Santa Barbara District Attorney's office had yesterday. The eight Tom Steddon sent the statement to charges be filed in Santa Barbara County Superior Court in Santa Barbara County.

[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:34.500]
Maria a working class town close to Jackson's Neverland Ranch.

[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:39.420]
Snedden earlier to file charges this weekend. Scott that suggestions his case was falling apart.

[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:45.360]
Everything will become clear when the charges are filed. He told CNN's art Harris nearly two weeks ago.

[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:50.920]
Monday's statement said a news conference will be held tomorrow to clarify exactly when the charges would be loved.

[00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:53.900]
So they're going to hold a news conference to tell you when they're going to make an announcement.

[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:58.660]
And I think today later on, they're going to hold a news conference. Tell you what time they're holding tomorrow's news conference.

[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.060]
Must be some slow news days this weekend. I guess it's the holidays.

[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:07.700]
Okay, let's get our whole bunch of calls thousands of them before we get to the Rush Limbaugh story.

[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.240]
5 6 7 now line one is working. I'm pretty sure about how come I.

[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.520]
See that? I don't know. It didn't work that well in the morning.

[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:18.120]
Oh, really? I like that sound though. Don't you?

[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.740]
Showing the sound of the dial phone, but just kind of the way to kind of feeding back.

[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.560]
I think we have it. No, it was really good. Let me try it again. Let me punch it up.

[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:31.820]
See how that's on. See what I mean? It's like a reverb on there. I feel like I'm on WAVC without the money.

[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:39.380]
5 6 7 0 5 60. So line one is like a half and a half out. Okay. Got that for a fix it. If he ever decides to show up.

[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:43.500]
It's half and a half out fix it. Kind of like a clearance was this morning when the beast woke up.

[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:51.280]
Oh, I think I touched on a raw spot there. You know what I'm saying? I think I did.

[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:56.740]
Better check yourself when you get home. Always go especially somebody fat and squat like you to have those

[00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.960]
the rooms that have the mirrors all the way around that we can just kind of like squat down and look straight behind you.

[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:08.760]
WQA. I'm Hello. That was pretty funny. Neil. That's why they call it the rear view mirror. Yes, sir.

[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.360]
Alrighty. Oh, your family. Oh boy. They freed me again. Major asshole.

[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.760]
Fat boys neighbor. Die, die, Dave. Die just before the holidays will be really good.

[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.180]
Just before Chanukas. So we have something to be grateful about W.A.

[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.940]
M not there. They also like that. Look at that.

[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:30.780]
What is going on with this phone screwed up today? We may have to play comedy bits all day. The phone is a mess WQ.

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:34.620]
I am. Hey, got a quick question. There is one that works. Yes, sir.

[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:42.760]
Hey, I'm up in a point beach. I'm so sorry. And yeah, I happen to be one of the porkers up here.

[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:45.680]
What time are they going to have to band up there at the, uh,

[00:39:47.660 --> 00:39:53.200]
give away. I think glory hold real 730 to 930 tonight.

[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.720]
All right. I'm on days. May we also buy that later? Excellent. Say how did you give them a kiss for us?

[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.620]
Yeah. All right. Yeah. I'll give them a go. Oh, you haven't seen them yet.

[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:07.360]
5 6 7 0 5. I think it's going to be a lot of fun with these phones today based on the way they sound.

[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:11.840]
Oh, two. See, because it's the holidays and obviously nobody really cares. We don't give a shmit.

[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.720]
So we're just, you know, we're just fun in you. We're just having a little good time before I bail out for a long extended vacation at the end of the year at the

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:23.600]
S end. George will be on all week next week. That'll be goodness for Teddy Botswana. Hey, Teddy, get your blow up.

[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.420]
I'll already for next week, man. You can be hopping on it for four hours every day.

[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.560]
Tend to Monday through Friday next week. George will be with you all day.

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.700]
Although, let's see. Now what, uh, that can't be right.

[00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.960]
What happens? What do we have? Do we have like ball games on Christmas day or what?

[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:45.460]
Next Thursday, December 25th is Christmas day. Okay. Yeah. Nobody works on Christmas day.

[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:50.200]
I probably will. You will. How to get you? I work on Christmas. I'll be damn.

[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:55.760]
And of course this Friday is the beginning of Chanukah, right? Yep. Friday night at sundown. Is it?

[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:02.400]
But we got that big stars panthers hockey game on and we also got the Humperwoody and Dave wants that show.

[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:09.000]
Very that should be good. Although hopefully if they're at least on the dolphins part, if there if Wayne's got any brains at all by Friday,

[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:15.900]
Dave wants that'll be back in Chicago with a banjo on his knee. He'll be long gone. Why is he waited so so long? You think what's he waiting for?

[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.160]
Dave's a good guy. Yeah.

[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.160]
So in other words, only the good guy should have the jobs no matter how inept they are like they've been boring and Dave wants that.

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:32.140]
And then it'll be the world to be so much better place. I mean, you know, everything will be really crappy.

[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:37.360]
But at least I'm trying to think of somebody who's not a good guy who ought to get canned. Absolutely.

[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.920]
Oh, one name comes to mind immediately. Would you agree? Yes. Well, what happened to be?

[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:50.540]
You would probably have to you and clearance. We have race out the door down an elevator hand in hand arm and arm and race home to hop on that new king.

[00:41:50.540 --> 00:42:01.100]
Well, Mattress again, just as a celebratory gesture. God, can you even begin to imagine the parties that would break just spontaneously all over the building on that day?

[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:08.180]
Hey, they hate you like poison, Mo and take it from the tub and the shrub and the toad and the load and all the other crap.

[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:15.020]
I do like that. I thought I was cute. Yeah. The mad dog is on a new to four sandwich between the toe and the load.

[00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:18.480]
Yeah, like that. He had his New York writers come up with that. Did he really? Yeah.

[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:25.020]
Well, of course, didn't he with us this morning because he was resting his aching old bones after a long desperate night last night?

[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:28.480]
I wonder if he was belly-hicken about the officiating. I was actually cuddling with Jay.

[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:33.840]
Was he really with J. Roqueach? Not exactly. Oh, it's a feeler and J. Roqueach. The vote Jewish.

[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.040]
Maybe he had J. Roqueach let him have one of them pickles. WQ I am.

[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:45.340]
Is your post on the side of that? He haven't heard from him and quite a while now. Happy holidays to you, sir. WQ I am. Hello.

[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:52.440]
Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I have a poll suggestion. Yes, sir. For a future poll. Always open for a good poll.

[00:42:52.940 --> 00:43:00.320]
Well, with the. With the cell phone now, you can take your number one. It would be like a two-part poll.

[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:07.620]
Are you going to do it? And if so, who are you going to? Which would tell us who people think is the best cellular provider?

[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.760]
And they could and then there could also be a choice. I don't have a cell phone. And there could be a choice.

[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.880]
Another I know it comes as a shock to you, but there actually are a few people.

[00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:20.740]
There are a lot to don't who don't have a cell phone. There's a lot to. Yes. Right. Not too many.

[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:29.220]
Okay. There was a program on another at our AM station a couple weeks ago on a Sunday morning where they were evaluating cell phones.

[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:36.360]
Right. They're cell services. Right. Right. And I that couldn't listen to it all, but I mean, now that you can do it, I'd like to.

[00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:42.400]
I'd really like to hear what the population of this area you know thinks about it. You're the best. So. That's a good suggestion. We'll do it soon.

[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.540]
Thank you, sir. Thanks. Family. Have a great holiday. Keep up the good work. All right. Bye.

[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:52.100]
That is a good idea. Don't you think? I mean, it's not scintillating. It's not like dynamics, it's not controversial.

[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:56.360]
But I think you know, it might be a little bit useful or not as a case. Maybe it'll kill a poll one day.

[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:02.720]
And then we can get people to call it on their cell phones. We can find out what kind of service they got and what kind of phone you're using.

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.180]
And we can see how crappy it sounds, which in almost every case, it'll be our fault. The equipment. It'll be a fault.

[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:13.180]
Like it is today. I can't believe how bad it was. In fact, line one is ringing. This ought to be really good. Q.A.M. Hello.

[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.840]
Neil. Boy, look how good that is. Clear is about. Yes, sir.

[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:35.160]
Hi. I don't know if you've discussed this yesterday or not, but I don't know if you noticed the newest double speak, the 1984 or Welley ending the government's giving us that they discovered Sadams were about by rounding up his family and close associates and conducting hostile questionings.

[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:43.980]
Yeah. Which I guess is the nice way of saying that we torture people now. Right. We plucked out their eyebrows and their fingernails and we said, well, how when you want us to stop?

[00:44:44.340 --> 00:45:00.440]
Right. They asked him, well, who's going to get the 25 million? Oh, no one's getting it because they didn't volunteer the information. We dragged it out of them with hostile questioning. Well, no, they said the 25 million. They can't give because the person who actually gave the exact location is already in custody for accused terrorist acts. So that's what they claim.

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:11.940]
Yeah. So basically we're the good guys, but now we torture people. Right. Is there any doubt? In fact, they had a guy in last night who was talking about the psychological what they're going to do to Sadam now.

[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:17.940]
They're not going to torture them because they would look make us look really bad if it got out, but they're going to like do all sorts of things just short of that.

[00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:25.120]
You know, like, like put him in a room where he's disoriented and put water on the floor and have really loud music like in a clockwork or and stuff like that.

[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.760]
And did you notice how drunk he looked in the video yesterday? Yeah, look, they said disoriented. Yeah.

[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:37.600]
Yeah, disoriented because they're pumping him full of something. Have a great day, Pally. Okay. See you.

[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.780]
Hey, we wouldn't do that because we're America, baby. We used to be great.

[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.820]
This is sports radio, which is you way.

[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:57.360]
A stench of power manure covers over this performance by the dolphin.

[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:04.600]
Unmistakably, this is television. That it's best. What is the message there? The message is that there are no knowns.

[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:13.720]
There are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns. That is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know.

[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:21.220]
Strong, bewildering words, but there are also unknown unknowns. There are things we do not know. We don't know.

[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:28.660]
Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? I'm just talking. This is blah, blah. This word.

[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:31.720]
This has been a presentation of ABC News.

[00:46:32.140 --> 00:46:37.680]
Hermann Gearing-Rombsfield. I hope everybody had a chance to take a puke at that. The picture of him shaking his hand, squeezing it really tight.

[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:47.760]
That's on our website on neo-rangers.com. 1983, 20 years ago, shaking his hand, squeezing it. He was our beloved buddy over there. He was our ace in a hole. Now he's the ace in a spider hole.

[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:56.460]
I just love that thing with the deck of cards. Oh, he was the ace of spades. And Brian, okay. Look, a bunch of children. Speaking of children, Dave Heiss neighbor faxes in.

[00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:02.560]
I haven't listened to your show in a few months, nor called either. Oh, yeah, right. In a few months, you should live so long, Dave.

[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.940]
Well, I was there. When I was out there in November.

[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:11.220]
A few were getting faxes from him. Someone has told me that someone calls you show and you think it's me. It's not.

[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:16.860]
I respect you when you show it so much. Besides, I use the fax, not the phone. Regardless, Jeff Heiss neighbor, David.

[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:20.560]
Right. Who's out. You know he's listening right now. Hey, David.

[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:25.660]
Hi, Sally. Get a life. And it's not only that Jeff Heiss former neighbor. Isn't that something?

[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:34.140]
What if that was your the thing, your tag on your life? What did you do in your life? What were you known by? Oh, I was Jeff Heiss former neighbor.

[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:42.400]
That's what made me known. That was my thing in life. Wouldn't you probably like just blow your brains out?

[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:50.200]
Something to think about, Dave. Limbal wants to keep seized medical records private. How do you like that?

[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:56.780]
Tom West Palm Beach, Russia Limbal claims investigators who seized his medical records, violated his privacy.

[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:01.520]
He's asked for a court hearing to help keep the records from being released according to a petition as a attorney's file yesterday.

[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:11.480]
Limbal argues that he cannot be treated for his serious medical conditions because the state seized all of his original charts and files last month and intimidated his doctors.

[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:24.860]
His serious medical conditions. The Palm Beach County State attorney's orifice seized records for its investigation into whether limbal engaged in illegal drug use and went doctor shopping for prescription painkillers.

[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:39.160]
State attorney spokesman Mike Edminson said yesterday that limbal's rights have been scrupulously protected. Limbal's attorney Roy Black has previously accused the Palm Beach State attorney's office of having political motives for investigating whether they consider the radio commentator bought painkillers illegally.

[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:50.420]
Black didn't return phone calls on Friday. The search warrant list prescriptions for more than 2000 pills from March 24 through September 26th this year alone, 2003.

[00:48:52.300 --> 00:49:02.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Great day to get out of your system. Let's hear all those doll fans call it and whining and whipping and mowing it today, right?

[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:08.100]
I like your the whole station doing that all day today. They would be great. That'd be awesome. Having a cry fast.

[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:15.580]
Yeah. And then I heard that one guy called and showed this morning whining about the officiating. It must have been the officials. Can you believe that?

[00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:26.380]
Good. Golly Miss Molly. It's always somebody else. It's a bad call. It's a crappy break. It's this. It's that it's not the gagging. See somebody what the Eagles kept doing is they had.

[00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:33.080]
Are you were the fact that under helmets they had calendars like a large small page of counter said December on top? No way. Yeah.

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:34.840]
That's awesome.

[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.780]
It's a good idea though. Isn't it? Yeah. Suggested to the bills on Sunday.

[00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.500]
Soon as the dolphins man, as soon as that defense gets out and they'll all up, they say, oh December and they start gagging and choking and puking on it.

[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:56.680]
Did Mark do bring any of the good stuff last night? I'm sorry. Anyway, I think 200 isn't something how we're just supposed to forget about everything.

[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:15.560]
He's a good guy now. You know, he's one of the going to honor Lee Roy Phillips. Who? Lawrence Phillips. What are they? Lee Roy. Lawrence Phillips. Do I say Lee Roy? Oh, excuse me. Yeah. How about Cecil Medisal? Cecil Medisal is coming back. In fact, he's going to break into one of the sky boxes in the middle of the night.

[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:25.520]
Probably try to attack a Marty. 244 votes. How do you think the capture of Saddamal affected 2004 election? It's too early to tell.

[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:39.980]
Lot'sishman happens. 118. That's a good choice. The Democrats are way behind the eighth ball. 48. I voted for that to be voted for that. They got a long way to go to get with it. Get with it. All the one good thing though. I'm serious. I hope that at least a few people saw.

[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:56.420]
Hardball's last night. And so do I. Julie. We got just chopped up by Chris Matthews. Any audience you could tell was really a gassed at most of his answers. It was just it was pathetic. Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead. The Sodom capture. There he is again.

[00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:26.080]
We'll come both with all them. Lies. 37. The Sodom that is. Bush is in 27 and no difference 14. Oh, look at that. There's Wesley Clark. You know where he is right now. He's in the testifying in the trial. He's in Needlelands. He's in the hagg. Iraq. He's an international elements present in the court. I think you have to be clear that that knows he's a testifying history at the cost. Slavio. It can't be a court that can't impose the death penalty. I think the significance of the crimes.

[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:55.900]
Mandate that death penalty beyond the table. Put it on the table. In fact, just put his ass on the table and let the Iraqis have Adam. Just like the Italians do with Mussolini, the only problem there is he was already dead. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. And they keep showing this file footage here of the phone. There he is again. You watch and see in there. There's the fakes that I'm standing in the middle of the crowd like the real Saddam would stand there in the middle of a crowd. Not knowing who to hell had a piece. You know, who the hell are they? Kidding. Man, these people are crazy.

[00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.480]
WQA. Hello. Yes, sir. I do. First of all, that's a mobile on that sunrise.

[00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:13.940]
Corn on our watch. The crispy cream. No, not a need. None of these things. I'll be then. Did you watch? I guess you watched again. Did you hear that broadcast by the old

[00:52:13.940 --> 00:52:21.760]
C now, Michael? But you still like him. But he was called people by names of astronauts and stuff. He was where he was last night.

[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:26.040]
When he just turned 80, Michael, I think maybe it's time for him to start considering laying a

[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.860]
leg in the mic down on the floor. One thing I thought maddened said when the first half was pretty

[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.860]
interesting. And when he said that after feedless through a past that was like 20 yards from the nearest

[00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:39.000]
receiver, he said, you know, he said he's a tough competitor, feedler, but he's not accurate.

[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.980]
And I thought, hey, somebody had the balls to say it. Wow. With somebody on this radio station,

[00:52:43.980 --> 00:52:49.660]
and the balls that say one that should go besides the big old, he's really willing. Any balls that.

[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:53.340]
And he had in the big old. There's never any idea what he's talking about. So if even he can see the

[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:59.600]
coast of short, what a bunch of whims we got on here. The big old giant fat jude that comes on

[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:06.600]
later in the day with the fastest dripping off of them. Yeah guy will not. He will not be critical ever.

[00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:11.060]
Never. And man, it's. But wait a minute. But wait a minute. Don't forget you see I'm not defending the

[00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:15.080]
load, but you got to remember the load. His got to he's got interview the coach. So it no matter

[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:20.100]
who the coaches, he got to suck up because he does the coaches show. Yeah. And then you got Mo and

[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:24.500]
the mad dog who are the dog who are employees paid employees by the dolphins for the broadcast.

[00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.740]
So you know, they're not going to rip the coach in ass. What do you got left? Remember thanks,

[00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:33.280]
given when you when you went and looked at the turkey and that and you took that plastic thing off

[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:38.040]
the turkey and it was just kind of like skin and fat. That's where the head looks like.

[00:53:39.220 --> 00:53:44.020]
The spot just tripping off. Okay, well, listen, have a great holiday and bring some hand by. He likes

[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:47.820]
that too, even though it's not kosher. Ripping my poor friend the load. How do you like that?

[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:53.380]
By the way, Hank will be on not a chulis today because he's dieting for the holidays and we

[00:53:53.380 --> 00:53:57.320]
got boogat to the Humphurit 4 Ricky William short seven. That should be really special

[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:03.560]
at the Cleveland. As Dan La Bastard does a rim job. I'm Ricky. And then you got the big O at

[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.100]
eight o'clock, eight o'clock, eight o'clock, 10 and Joe and Mark overnight. But this last guy

[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:11.360]
is sucking up to the big. That's pretty embarrassing. The big goes nickname is the voice of the angry

[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:14.960]
fan man. Is that what it is? Yeah, that's what they call him. I wouldn't know because I can't

[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:19.160]
listen to him. He just that once he starts with that spanglish baby talk stuff, I just it just

[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:24.140]
leaves me limp. Anyway, wait a year. This, this will leave you limp even a pig like you. Contractors

[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.840]
serve troops dirty food and dirty kitchens. Maybe not quite as dirty as the kitchen we saw there in

[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:35.800]
Saddam's shack. The Pentagon repeatedly warned contractor Haliburton KBR that the food at served

[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:42.620]
US troops in Iraq was dirty as were the kitchens. It was served in NBC news reports. Haliburton

[00:54:42.620 --> 00:54:47.220]
Kellogg Brown and Roots promises to improve have not been followed through according to a Pentagon

[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:51.760]
report that warned serious repercussions may result if the contractor didn't clean up and

[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:58.900]
clean up their act too. The Pentagon reported finding blood all over the floor, dirty pans,

[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:05.000]
dirty grills, dirty salad bars and rotting meats and vegetables in four of the military

[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.320]
messes the company operates in Iraq and BC said citing Pentagon documents. Should I read that

[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:17.360]
again? Blood all over the floor, dirty pans, dirty grills, dirty salad bars and rotting meats and

[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:22.280]
vegetables. Any scallions or green onions? The report came as President George W. Bush

[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.720]
funded off Pentagon reports that Haliburton KBR over charged $61 million for gasoline and sold

[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:30.840]
the military in Iraq. Dick Cheney ran Haliburton for five years until becoming vice president and

[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:37.360]
a commander assistant commander in thief. The company feeds 110,000 US and coalition troops daily

[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.900]
to cost a 28 bucks per troop per day in BC said the B said he couldn't even eat breakfast for that

[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:47.660]
amount. The Pentagon found unclean conditions at four locations in Iraq including one in Baghdad

[00:55:47.660 --> 00:55:51.680]
and two in Tekreq. Even in the mess hall where Bush served troops there Thanksgiving dinner,

[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:55.960]
it was dirty in August of September, October according to NBC. They probably cleaned it up a little

[00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:02.000]
bit when he got there. When he had that fake bird. This adds up to a company that arrogantly is

[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.060]
overcharging when they can get away with it and not providing the quality of service that they

[00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:10.140]
agreed to do, Representative Henry Waxman of California told NBC. Haliburton Kellogg Brown and

[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:16.300]
Root told NBC that hostile conditions pose special challenges as they serve the 21 million meals so

[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:21.320]
far to the troops at 45 sites in Iraq. We've taken quick action to improve the company said as they

[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:26.960]
brushed aside that rotting meat. God almighty and that's on appetizing. That's the thanks we give

[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.140]
to our troops who are putting their lives online over there in Iraq where they shouldn't be in the

[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:35.980]
first place is to feed them a bunch of rotting bloody crap. Lovely. Nice going. I have to mention of

[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:41.440]
course the screwing the veterans are getting here right at home from these chicken hawks. The neo-cons. I

[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.920]
think these are the people that put the con in neo-con. I'll guarantee you that. For a minute

[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:54.060]
after 11 at 560 WQM how's that pull coming folks are just pouring in 270 not like yesterday

[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:58.400]

teams and the league I am the dolphins Miami dolphins take all his signals in Hebrew

[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:51.800]
the dolphins have no defense and their offense is a joke like George Bush eating pretzels you know

[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:59.120]
they're gonna choke they'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race with fewer points

[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:09.420]
than parkmarks on high zingas ugly face and there the Miami dolphins Miami dolphins Miami dolphins number

[01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:21.380]
all what the hell 32 Miami dolphins Miami dolphins Miami dolphins Miami dolphins now they're through

[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:35.380]
1121 at 560 and they still got those two games baby they're still hope we still got a shot you know

[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:40.160]
I'm saying still got a shot Denver's got to lose two in a row and Baltimore's got to lose and Tennessee's

[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:43.360]
got to lose and everybody else in the league's got to lose in fact both teams playing all remaining

[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.000]
games have to lose and the dolphins have to beat the bills and the jets think it's gonna happen no

[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:56.480]
what do you think we got a shot no I said we are the past yeah yeah we got a shot see don't

[01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:01.060]
don't lump yourself in with the losers just like the hockey thing you know oh I last

[01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:04.180]
that I'm watching a little bit of that too in between hard balls and the dolphins and all

[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:10.380]
other stuff I'm watching and here's my great-close personal buddy the rim man oh my gosh these

[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.340]
youngsters in the organization and this kid is gonna be great you know I don't know how long

[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:20.020]
they think they can keep pedal at yeah how long you yeah how long would be every announcer for

[01:03:20.020 --> 01:03:25.100]
every team no no I'm not playing in rumor but I'm just saying that that whole this is the this is

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:30.900]
the storyline and to keep trying to pedal to the public it's not gonna fly Alan it's not gonna

[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:35.220]
fly public and buy in it they're not showing up even the people with the freebie tickets aren't showing

[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:41.540]
up that whole thing I mean that goes back years now the youngsters in the organization yeah they

[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:45.560]
do have some good young kids out there but first of all nobody knows who most of them are because the

[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.620]
the names keep changing like every couple of weeks you need to have a scorecard with a pencil and

[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.340]
a bigger racer and number two you can't have a team made up of all youngsters in the organization

[01:03:55.360 --> 01:03:59.360]
and a team that's losing 17 million dollars or maybe 20 million year whatever the hell it is

[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:04.920]
uh they got real serious baby they got problems and I don't say that with any delight I think it's

[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.040]
gonna be a sad day when hockey leaves South Florida but I think it's just inevitable boring some kind

[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:14.140]
of a miracle you see hockey being around in South Florida assuming that they somehow the NHL

[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.860]
and the players union resolve the thing even with one year off you think in five years if there's

[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:22.700]
still an NHL there's gonna be a team in South Florida no no no no I don't see it but the commissioner

[01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:28.660]
was down he had so much fun yeah oh yeah the commissioner mr. blue sky see that knows is so big

[01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:32.540]
every time he looks up to the sky he can't see what's really going on up there so it could be

[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:36.120]
snowing five feet of snow in the middle of an end and he'd think the sun was shining and it was

[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.000]
90 degrees you missed the great interview that Goldie did with the commissioner at the game on the

[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.820]
big oh I can imagine a color of that tongue after that Kelly really give him a good lick job

[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:54.700]
huh oh come on don't be playing that oh you're actually Goldie did a good job and then had a

[01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:58.000]
little joke at the end and he said you know commissioner here you're gonna bring the all-star game

[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:06.300]

South Florida team i guess well we'll change it at one okay by the way that player was something

[01:12:06.710 --> 01:12:11.150]
underwood right the defensive line in the Tony underwood no it's uh

[01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:17.290]

[01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:34.570]
they what are the overs and unders under the matrix under our overwood i remember i friend the

[01:12:35.170 --> 01:12:38.890]
my close personal friend back in the days when the Cecil stuff was going on and you know i

[01:12:38.890 --> 01:12:43.950]
a hand can i get a long read i love hang but he was so desperate to try to like you know because when

[01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:48.010]
you get close to the team you can't be objective this is one thing that bothers me about our station

[01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:52.330]
is that we got too many people on the earth very close to coaches or players and you can't be

[01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:58.850]
objective at all i'm not mentioning no names don't i absolutely like guys that have their head

[01:12:58.850 --> 01:13:04.630]
up j-feet leaders as right go yeah powered from bokeh right i mean he's not the only one we've

[01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:09.790]
got some other people on the station you're very very excited we get some dan marino liquors on

[01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:14.350]
there always no matter if Danny had a crappy game that always make excuses you know but the fact

[01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:19.150]
that matter is back when Cecil the story was going on and and the load said well maybe he was

[01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:24.130]
just trying to take a look maybe just want to take a look when he broke into broads window you know

[01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:29.310]
and i talked to myself it's kind of like when you go into a department store you know and you're

[01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:32.930]
kind of browsing around when the salesperson comes over the may i help you and you say no just

[01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:38.530]
looking and so when the woman's husband came and said what you doing here man and i'm just looking

[01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:44.810]
maybe he just wanted to get a look that was funny that was one of your really uh funny that was a

[01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:48.890]
bad moment maybe his blood sugar was about 800 that day he just wanted to get a look

[01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:49.050]
uh

[01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:55.450]
do we now speaking of people who are a little bit off how about Scott Jr. where now we decided

[01:13:55.450 --> 01:14:00.930]
where he's gone actually yeah he's there uh he's got the shell at the shell where where there is

[01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:06.070]
no shelter uh he said he's uh he's already there at the show is that some shell somewhere you know

[01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:10.570]
well no that's that's not going to cut it to shell where there's a shell i'm trying to think

[01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:15.370]
in my mind there's a shell on browing university we've been there but we already been there

[01:14:16.190 --> 01:14:20.910]
sunrise and university now let's see i'm getting confused pineapple at university that's that's the

[01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:28.130]
shell right i don't know i don't venture to brow it so who knows you don't venture to brow

[01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:33.270]
no i live in the m.i.a. i live in the 305 how can there be a pineapple of university it's like

[01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:39.450]
they run parallel i mean pile on and sunrise that's where the um shell station is i'm thinking of

[01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.330]
sunrise in university that's one where there's a flood puckers on a one corner

[01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:48.390]
maybe a scot jr can give us a call back and let us know there's a mobile across this

[01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:52.130]
three and i'm sure the guys right i'm sure it's a chevron next to those awful movie theaters

[01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:57.350]
there where i saw godfather 300 years ago never saw huh but i'm i'm we're just trying to figure

[01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.270]
out what we i said we could tell the audience where the heli was that might help a little bit

[01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:04.590]
or maybe we can start a new deal when we do the fundraiser find a qa and van

Alright

[01:19:17.910 --> 01:19:23.370]

They played for a carway, they're all new and just cocaine

[01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:06.190]
Love 45, it's gonna be a tough battle

[01:20:06.190 --> 01:20:08.610]
Which athlete was the biggest comeback they ever played for a son photo?

[01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:11.230]
Tim, we got a short list so far, we'll have lots more I'm sure

[01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:15.030]
Cecil Collins, Lawrence Phillips, the meekiest underwood

[01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:18.210]
I don't think he ever actually played, did he play a game?

[01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:24.310]
I'm sure they signed him, they signed him and then he freaked out again

[01:20:24.310 --> 01:20:27.270]
Mark Fitzpanktick or Michael Urban, that's the start

[01:20:27.270 --> 01:20:30.270]
You're gonna be so psychotic all of you when you hear this, maybe

[01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:34.350]
Cardinal says US treated Saddam like a cow

[01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:40.770]
A Tom Vatican official said that he felt pity and compassion for Saddam Hussein

[01:20:40.770 --> 01:20:45.530]
And criticized US military for showing video footage of him being treated like a cow

[01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:50.050]
They left the ARD off the end of it

[01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:54.590]
Cardinal Renato Martino, head of the Vatican's Justice and Peace department

[01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:58.150]
And a former papal envoy to the United Nations told a news conference

[01:20:58.150 --> 01:21:04.310]
It would be illusory to think the rest of the former Iraqi president would heal all the damage caused by a war which the Holy See opposed

[01:21:04.770 --> 01:21:08.970]
I mean that's one thing, I agree with him on that but we treated him like a cow

[01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:10.590]
What do they want us to do?

[01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:12.850]
Cater like a nice Christmas dinner?

[01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:19.110]
I felt pity to see this man destroy the military looking at his teeth as if he were a cow

[01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:22.330]
They could have spared us these pictures said Cardinal Martino

[01:21:23.150 --> 01:21:26.870]
Seeing him like this, a man in his tragedy despite all the heavy blame he bears

[01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.910]
I had a sense of compassion for him

[01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:31.130]
See, one thing just like Jimmy Johnson

[01:21:31.810 --> 01:21:34.010]
The Vatican never met a scumbag they didn't like

[01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:40.130]
Martino was referring to the videotape released by the US military we know what tape it was

[01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:43.830]
Martino was one of the Vatican officials most strongly opposed to the US let invasion of Iraq

[01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:49.290]
He said it was true we should be happy that this arrest has come about because it's the watershed that was necessary

[01:21:49.290 --> 01:21:52.050]
And hope that this will not have worse than other serious consequences

[01:21:52.050 --> 01:21:54.990]
But it's not the total solution to the problems of the Middle East he said

[01:21:55.990 --> 01:22:00.870]
Martino said the Vatican hope the arrest of Sodom can contribute to promoting the peace and democratization of Iraq

[01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:08.330]
But he added it seems to me to be illusory to hope this will repair the dramas and the damage to the defeat for humanity that a war always brings about

[01:22:09.010 --> 01:22:10.150]
And it goes on and on

[01:22:10.770 --> 01:22:15.770]
I can agree with him about all that other stuff but about he feels sorry for Sodom who killed hundreds of thousands

[01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:17.210]
Maybe a million people

[01:22:18.230 --> 01:22:19.890]
Because we treated him like a cow

[01:22:20.930 --> 01:22:22.510]
We looked inside of his mouth

[01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:25.470]
Oh man

[01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:29.070]
Like I said they had a fucking apart sell by sell

[01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:30.190]
And that'd be great

[01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:34.790]
Could drag that out for like months and months maybe years making into a miniseries

[01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:40.550]
560-560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:45.570]
So strong thermon knocked up a 16 year old black girl it's kind of like shades of town as Jefferson all over again

[01:22:45.570 --> 01:22:50.870]
Although generally speaking when you think of town as Jefferson you don't think of strong thermon in the same moment

[01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:53.830]
I could be wrong

[01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:57.610]
And what do you think about that idea of going back to a separate north and south again

[01:22:59.610 --> 01:23:04.110]
All among Wums they can have the south back again all the red necks all the Yahoo the trailer trash

[01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:07.450]
They can have the south back again and the civilized people can all live in the north

[01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:10.510]
Okay, well I have to give some you know little extra clothing like I got here

[01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:15.270]
Oh the blades brothers Brian blades

[01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:17.530]
Isn't that the one we want?

[01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:21.510]
Yeah the receiver Brian the receiver

[01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:24.970]
Well there was two of them Benny was the I know Benny in the jets

[01:23:26.150 --> 01:23:27.650]
Benny was with the alliance right

[01:23:28.690 --> 01:23:32.210]
And Brian played for Seattle and he went he was with Seattle Dennis Erickson said

[01:23:32.210 --> 01:23:37.670]
Oh we don't have time for any of them I wasn't Dennis Erickson it was his agent who said he's got to go out to training camp

[01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:43.730]
He's got a we got a run fast and jump high something like that or get high Brian plays

[01:23:43.730 --> 01:23:46.130]
Okay, you inspired me for the next bit I'm gonna play

[01:23:46.130 --> 01:23:46.490]
Okay

[01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:52.170]
Let's see it says this is a fact biggest scumbags the guy who shot and killed this cousin can't remember the name

[01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:58.350]
Oh did you hear the big news story this morning the co-star caught 50 illegal immigrants on a boat in Miami

[01:23:58.350 --> 01:24:02.930]
Can you imagine the illegal immigrants on a boat or I mean not really I never heard of a thing like that what a concept

[01:24:03.730 --> 01:24:08.930]
Market down market on the counter that December 16 2003 there were illegal aliens on a boat

[01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:13.890]
Maybe we got another aliens little something for next year but it would be great wouldn't it be good?

[01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:21.350]
Have another alien to curious over for months and months of weakness screaming yell and how are we get all the more old crazy or Cuban colors back in again

[01:24:23.910 --> 01:24:32.270]
Like that nobody QM hello. Hi Neil how you doing? Yes sir pretty good. I got another scumbag for you. Okay. How about Naja Davenport?

[01:24:33.190 --> 01:24:40.410]
Remember he's the young guy who took a dump on that laundry basket in New York. What was his name? Naja Davenport. Naja?

[01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:46.370]
Naja? Naja? That's the piece. Yeah, you know, and I know the thing I remember that show when I was

[01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:57.050]
I remember that show when Hank was trying to defend what before this before yeah he said he just wanted to look around. No he was he was just trying to dip his wig. He's what he said.

[01:24:57.070 --> 01:25:04.970]
Yeah, remember that that was part of the ongoing. Yeah, he just wanted to dip his wig. That was before that kind of getting in that book of brand but right.

[01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:13.090]
Exactly. I was before the fact came out. All right Neil. How a good day. Thanks. I have a great holiday. Naja Davenport. Now you should probably be pretty familiar with Naja. Naja?

[01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:18.250]
Sure. You should even ask how it smelled probably you should know what the aroma was what he had for dinner night before.

[01:25:19.890 --> 01:25:31.030]
You know what they say Jimmy crack corn and Naja aided. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 8th and T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:25:31.230 --> 01:25:33.670]
Yeah, I like that pull a lot better. We'll change it around 12.

[01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:41.710]
12 30. So we find out where Scott Jr. is yet. No. He hasn't called in to tell us where he is.

[01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:53.750]
No, what a jerk man. What an idiot. I just I just don't understand it. I do understand. It's the QA method. Wait, it's just I mean if you're totally incompetent.

[01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:59.430]
If you're like having got a clue, what the hell what side is up and what side is down? You're hired. Believe me.

[01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:06.510]
See as much as I like for real a lot. The fact that he brought him and dragged him along with him. That was part of the baggage we had to put up with.

[01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:13.410]
5 6 7 0 5. The for else didn't really bring him in. He just kind of followed. He followed him down the Hershey highway.

[01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:21.750]
How do you think the capture of Saddamal affected 2004 election? That's pull number one today. We got 374 votes. Not too bad.

[01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:26.570]
It's totally to tell lots of shmink happens. 182. We got 11 months to go, baby.

[01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:33.990]
The Democrats are way behind the 8th ball. 75. Be stoded for that and so did I. They got to get with it. Get with it. Hop on it.

[01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:45.270]
Big boost for Bush puts him far ahead. 57. Bush is in 38. King set and match. And no difference. Only 22.

[01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:49.830]
I don't know. I didn't know the market is up a little bit today, but it has nothing to do with that.

[01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:55.970]
It has to do with the housing starts. They had the CPI went down to a tenths of a point, but we had a record.

[01:26:55.970 --> 01:27:00.610]
High number housing star. All of a sudden bull crap. So that was up 61 and has that down about 8.

[01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:09.230]
They can mean say anything. No. No. The good news is that Walmart said their sales for in the crapper. Not good.

[01:27:09.330 --> 01:27:15.030]
Not a good report from Walmart to which we say. Oh, right. So anything that's bad news for Walmart is good news for America and the rest of the world too.

[01:27:16.370 --> 01:27:26.390]
WQ I am. Yes, sir. I have. I have a suggestion for your power. Go right ahead. Ramon Castro.

[01:27:28.010 --> 01:27:36.710]
Ramon Castro. Yeah, he's the the Marlins catcher who the rapist alleged. Yeah. I forgot all about that. He deserves a place on that.

[01:27:36.710 --> 01:27:42.550]
He deserves honorable mention. Right. Exactly. Thanks a lot, pal. You got a baby. I have a great holiday. Ramon Castro.

[01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:47.330]
Of course, again, that's still in limbo right. He hasn't got a trial. Right. Yeah.

[01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:54.910]
What have I been so many? You know, so many scumbags and so little time. Who else was it that often said I used to snort the chalk lines? Who was that?

[01:27:55.730 --> 01:27:59.830]
Which one? Well, give me a name. I don't know. Running back.

[01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:11.150]
Number 33. I'm just picking a number out of here. Oh, come on. You've got to know what I'm talking about. I have no idea. Okay. Fine.

[01:28:11.610 --> 01:28:19.710]
Oh, here's a good one. Nice go. I'm liking plantation excellent choice. Jose can suck. Oh, never stole a freight train. But other than that, he done it.

[01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:25.410]
It said he's definitely a scumbag and a soft floor athlete. Although, I don't think I actually played here while he's a soft floor to.

[01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:32.330]
Well, you're right. Maybe it doesn't qualify. Never played. Not across it out. Sorry. Never played for soft floor to team.

[01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.810]
I'll tell you is a scumbag in different category in my book. You know, most people would not agree.

[01:28:39.810 --> 01:28:47.350]
And that's the Pudge Master. You know how did you Marlon sent Pudge back in? I just can't deal with a guy who built a gigantic statue as a monument to himself in his yard.

[01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:53.690]
And then number two says, oh, gee, you know, seven million year plus the three million that from the first year scumbag. 10 million year to the next two or three years.

[01:28:53.690 --> 01:29:07.410]
And then he could buy me enough beef burritos to keep my ass as fat as it already is. When you say that qualifies him as a scumbag. Well, rumor I've heard through the grapevine. Yeah, that when he left Texas, he was completely had no money.

[01:29:08.610 --> 01:29:19.970]
Oh, like every other professional athlete just gotten rid of all this cash. What a shame. So, you know, he needs to support the lifestyle. Maybe he's got a little bit of yom or yom or yom or problem. Maybe like to go to Vegas and you know, world of ice a little bit.

[01:29:20.670 --> 01:29:25.990]
Put him on there. Pudge Rodriguez. He might get some votes. Just not a frustration from people that are pissed off about his crappy attitude.

[01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:33.790]
All this all that you know, they kept saying, oh, this is going to come to an end of when I can spend this kind of wild money and all this craziness is going to never going to end.

[01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:44.830]
Never going to end. It's destroyed. The National Hockey League. They're about done. They're about finished destroying baseball and it keeps saying, oh, no, we're going to stop with that seven million and enough. 10 million and enough.

[01:29:44.830 --> 01:29:53.770]
What did he hit like 297 last year? He was big in a playoffs. See, I'm doing a sports show now. Damn it. I hate this. But he and what he had like 16 home runs. Yeah.

[01:29:55.590 --> 01:30:10.450]
Is that worth like 10 million? Is that worth $10, $12 million a year? No. Pudge Rodriguez. You make me sick to my stomach, but and I used to like him. I used to admire him. I thought he was a hell of a player. He's no a rod. He's no pay rod.

[01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:21.130]
Well, that's your team. You're a team. They're making that Ramirez pay rod deal. I keep reading about it in a Boston Globe. What? I hope so. You hope so. Yeah. I hope you are settled with his 25 million year. I hope you have to pay all of it.

[01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:28.790]
And then I hope he breaks his leg in opening day. 5 6 7. I can't stand him. Man, it just leaves me limp. Leaves me limp.

[01:30:30.290 --> 01:30:37.370]
I mean, it would be like working in a radio station where they pay you a fortune. Everybody else is working for like five six bucks an hour, Beast. Yeah, I know that deal.

[01:30:40.750 --> 01:30:54.890]
Oh, WDQ I am. Hey, Mercury. That's it. Thank you, sir. He used to be number 22 number 22 in your heart. Number 40, a 427 85, any prison cell. And I would say play for four part senior.

[01:30:55.290 --> 01:31:06.510]
I just like for team down here. He had been put in his ass right back on a good point. Thank you. Mercury, more sold murk. He was on QA. I'm for about five minutes. And Jose can suck. Oh, makes it back on list. Good point.

[01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:20.030]
Played his high school balls. Hey, Jose, what's that in your hand? Him and his brother just seem to have. You know what it is? I think trouble follows them around. You know what I mean? By the way, yes, a factor by the way, something.

[01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:29.610]
A factor suggested this is a great website with which details every criminal athlete there ever was really. So if you want to go in there in the break, you can probably find some good ones. It's okay.

[01:31:30.170 --> 01:31:46.190]
Crack smoker dot com. Oh, great crack smoker dot com. I'm surprised I didn't have worked there with the Dupor and Clayton last night. Dupor and Clayton were great. I'm not knocking and they were great. I was even a doll fender in those years. Can you believe that?

[01:31:46.190 --> 01:31:52.570]
No, all the games me and fat rich, the fat man getting their early eating and big sub sandwiches from downer and Kendall.

[01:31:53.470 --> 01:32:04.830]
And then the fact rich would bring all his silly hercune fan buddies over there, but they're hercune outfits on. And I finally said to myself, you know what? These people are a bunch of jerks. This is for more on. If there's one thing I cannot stand it, say, mo.

[01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:06.050]
Absolutely. Ron.

[01:32:15.270 --> 01:32:17.110]
I am for all I like.

[01:32:19.050 --> 01:32:26.090]
And I like rubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from Jews and listening to the near okay.

[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:51.050]
I'm gonna eat the hour.

[01:32:56.090 --> 01:33:00.930]

So well as Brian. What did you do?

[01:33:15.530 --> 01:33:23.250]

Brian. Brian. Brian. It's not to understand. It was an accident.

[01:33:43.610 --> 01:33:59.070]

well I heard I just don't understand how so so many people in this dog get a free pass I don't

[01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:42.070]

oh get out of here he never he never ever ever got more even when he has an orgasm he never

another guy for some strange reason he just he used to be there came to South Florida I mean I

[01:44:08.490 --> 01:44:14.010]
like Joe Joe is pretty good and especially compared to that egotistical arrogant prick Dave

[01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:17.450]
O'Brien was a tension between those two in the back and then of course they hated he said it was

[01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:23.250]
kind of like Mo and the Joe the old Mo Joe Mo and Goldie and Mo and Gildi why is there that much

[01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:29.730]
tends to between them now I guess probably because Mo knows that Gildi wants off of that show absolutely

[01:44:29.730 --> 01:44:33.830]
desperately and hates him like poison and is making making it more known around a building than he

[01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:37.490]
used to because he's hoping that he'll get him on with his buddy Joe was between eight and 10 and

[02:23:36.310 --> 02:23:39.970]
because you're like leaving him hanging. Time like the way Scott Jr.'s leaving us hanging.

[02:23:40.350 --> 02:23:43.950]
This today, this has got to be, I don't even know what term to use, it's just insanity.

[02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:48.050]
To see what you, it's not bad enough that this is a tough year to raise money for charity

[02:23:48.050 --> 02:23:51.210]
and everybody's a little on the tight side and don't know whether their job is going to

[02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:55.210]
be a stiller after the first of the year and maybe they already lost it and they're kind

[02:23:55.210 --> 02:23:58.490]
of like hanging on there every nickel they can. So everybody is bellyic in this year.

[02:23:58.590 --> 02:24:01.610]
It's really tough to raise money for charity and we're finding that too. But especially

[02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:05.750]
when you have an opportunity, this close to Hanukkah and Christmas time, when people are

[02:24:05.750 --> 02:24:08.770]
a little more into giving mood and want to pick up a neat gift for somebody for the holidays.

[02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:15.450]
And here we got this goofball, this bozo, this cretin, driving a van around like doing

[02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:19.770]
like an acid teacon and he's doing figure eights in the middle of the roads out there.

[02:24:22.430 --> 02:24:30.430]
He's at the corner of university in the sunrise, getting some gas. Yeah, update 120 bucks.

[02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:41.810]
Wow, he's doing it like I said. QAM, hello. QAM, going once, long gone, 120 bucks, I didn't think he'd

[02:24:41.810 --> 02:24:45.690]
get like a dime. So he's still got an hour to get out there and look at him and say, well once you look at him,

[02:24:45.690 --> 02:24:49.690]
you'll understand what this is all about. Those of you who think that we're exaggerating, just take a look at him.

[02:24:50.490 --> 02:25:00.770]
WDQAM, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going? It's going great. Fantastic. I got another scumbag for your list.

[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:09.010]
Okay. How about one step? He's on there, man. The step is on there. Damn, I missed that one.

[02:25:09.150 --> 02:25:14.310]
Okay. How about Brian Cox? He's on there. Well, I better pay attention, I guess.

[02:25:14.670 --> 02:25:19.690]
Start paying attention. Have a great holiday and get with it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, how about Cecil Collins?

[02:25:22.750 --> 02:25:26.330]
It's the same as the people that thanks you the stuff they did. Look at your website and they say,

[02:25:26.390 --> 02:25:31.190]
oh, that's a good story. Why don't I thanks you to Neil? Like maybe they think you just came.

[02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:35.170]
Oh, look at that. The French and German's not the West Germans this time. CNN finally got it right.

[02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:40.690]
Somebody finally told them there ain't no more West Germany. Surprise. WDQAM, hello.

[02:25:40.690 --> 02:25:44.350]
Could you please add something? Somebody of Randy Rose, the newest one of Randy Rhodes. Thanks.

[02:25:45.850 --> 02:25:52.870]
What was that? What was it? Oh, he wanted, oh, I know what he wanted to hear. Jesus, God, all mighty.

[02:25:54.110 --> 02:25:58.550]
Randy. What? Hello, Randy. What? Are you laughing to me? No.

[02:25:59.350 --> 02:26:02.710]
He sounded like one of them groupie-tepigas. He just wants to hear like drop-ins.

[02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:09.710]
I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite.

[02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:11.930]
That's number one with two bullets already. Absolutely.

[02:26:12.770 --> 02:26:15.250]
Just as I went on to listen, it's already zoomed to the top. What's that?

[02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:22.790]
The, uh, dropping them all my stuff. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite.

[02:26:22.870 --> 02:26:26.470]
I'm the bite. I'm the bite. If we're a little sure on time, we always have the abbreviated version.

[02:26:26.650 --> 02:26:31.690]
I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. I'm the bite. Like that. God, love it. You're a man.

[02:26:31.690 --> 02:26:37.270]
You're a man. The mo-myster. By the way, there's no, there's no greater sight than when during

[02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:43.430]
Howard's show, when, when Zach plays the, uh, the promos for the best in the LCDs and one of those

[02:26:43.430 --> 02:26:51.370]
bits comes on. Oh, man. What does he do? The action just, the man, things start spinning and on the head.

[02:26:52.290 --> 02:26:56.630]
The, the muskrat starts racing around in circles and his eyes start rolling and they start squeezing

[02:26:56.630 --> 02:27:00.730]
the bag. The little bit of the blue nose, Zach plays it on purpose just to get around. Nice going,

[02:27:00.730 --> 02:27:06.010]
Zach. Always like I told you, the good people are the fat people like the, uh, what is it?

[02:27:07.050 --> 02:27:11.190]
Slow toe, the toe, the toe, the toe, the toe, and the load.

[02:27:14.170 --> 02:27:18.210]
Nice going, mo. Guys, been on the air for a year and a half. He finally came up with a line.

[02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:28.630]
WDQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. We did it. There. We won the wheel series. How are you? Okay. I just want to let you know.

[02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:39.670]
This is going to be David Samson in the Lyle. I just became a man today. I'm originally from Holland and I tell you the reason why it's just because I can easily travel now. I leave this country.

[02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:43.070]
World series.

We love you. Do it. Okay. I'll stay. I'll stay. Do it. Do it. Do it. Cook scenes. Get out of here.

[02:27:51.450 --> 02:27:57.490]
5670560. Pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon, Marla's Lyle. Let's hop on a plane and go to Amsterdam. What do you say? It sounds good to me.

[02:27:57.490 --> 02:28:00.670]
All right. Might just be in my plans. You never know. You never know with me.

[02:28:01.810 --> 02:28:08.550]
Jose Konseco. Look what he's got. The biggest scumbag athlete to ever play for a soft loaded team, which he played high school ball.

[02:28:09.370 --> 02:28:14.470]
Jose's got 30. Lawrence Phillips 24. Cecil Collins 18. Ryan's Cox 15.

[02:28:15.350 --> 02:28:19.890]
Warren the satmeister 8. Michael Irving only 6. How can Michael Irving have only 6 votes?

[02:28:20.630 --> 02:28:21.710]
How soon they forget?

[02:28:23.030 --> 02:28:26.470]
Ryan blades 4. The meteor center would 4. Sammy Smith 3.

[02:28:27.490 --> 02:28:34.570]
Don't give Sammy that thing. Brian Benny blades 2. Pudges got a pair and everybody else got one. What about Bobby Humphries has non-sea?

[02:28:34.890 --> 02:28:39.170]
They all forgot about him because he was only in town about a week, I think. How about Stan Humphries?

[02:28:40.610 --> 02:28:46.210]
Stan Humphries? Who the hell is Stan Humphries? I don't know some TV person who knows.

[02:28:47.490 --> 02:28:53.150]
567 or how about Humphries Bogart as long as you're going to come up with crap? WQA him. Hello.

[02:28:53.610 --> 02:28:59.210]
Yeah, Leo. Yes, sir. How you doing? You forgot that my Cooper. He was laundry money a few years ago.

[02:28:59.610 --> 02:29:03.970]
Right. You should we put him on the list there and we honored him last night. Man, he honored him and Mark Clare.

[02:29:04.770 --> 02:29:12.470]
And it closed in single moccola. Nari's there. But it's okay. We don't have our interpreter here today, Pals. We got to chop it off.

[02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:15.870]
I don't have any idea what he said. Something about.

[02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:22.330]
That's whom we get lucky. Mark Dupor put him on there. Okay. With or without the honors last night. He had a little problem with his own.

[02:29:22.330 --> 02:29:30.950]
But he's better now. Who else was it that what receiver was it that had the problems? Jesus, I can't believe I forgot his name one of our favorite people about three, four years ago.

[02:29:31.990 --> 02:29:45.830]
Money laundering. Oh, come on. My stop and receive. Yes. There was actually there was a running back from UM James Stewart. Who was that? No, no, no, no. Very popular hurricane receiver. My God.

[02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:56.530]
The geez just faded out. You see that's about how it goes when you stop following the fish. Jamie German, not Jamie German. I said very famous. Well, no, he was.
