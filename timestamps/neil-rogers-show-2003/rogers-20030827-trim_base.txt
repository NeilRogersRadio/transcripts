You know, you know, I finally figured out why he was so bent out of shape about my show yesterday about the pull

[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.960]
I'm gonna give you two words that'll answer it for you Rick Weaver

[00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.220]
Rick Weaver yeah, he is so paranoid about the fact I said and and Weaver did very well in a pull by the way

[00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.600]
Oh, he's so paranoid about the fact that he couldn't lick Rick Weaver's ass. He couldn't carry his jock strap, you know

[00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.020]
Weaver

[00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.060]
You know who Rick Weaver see I'm not Mr.

[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.180]
My am the over here like you see that's why you were both were upset because neither you're both a couple of punks

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920]
I don't know any of the people around the podium that may be true Johnny come lately. I think I heard of a guy from my camera

[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.000]
Right Greg was just in here patting me on the head said it's nice to see you guys are doing great. Yeah Greg read

[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.320]
He's in there right now and he's in my house. I'm gonna get rid of Moe. He said how are we gonna get rid of that man?

[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.540]
I don't know they were working on it. Yeah, I think his lawyers got Greg on the take. I'm listening

[00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.220]
So he had so he had a little bit of a late start I guess this morning he put that thing on like ass back

[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.860]
Where does I thought it was Rick James when I first came into the building?

[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.320]
He's gonna be this voice is Daniel Boone was doing a morning show this morning

[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.460]
I said what do you mean is a Daniel Boone his hair was like he had a crunskin cap on

[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:50.140]
And he also stole the football blowout preview from the Sun sentinel today and to mom and a chop off his package

[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.560]
I'm listening. We's not gonna be here tomorrow

[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.560]
He's not gonna be here. I know why he's going so you can sit on the free ride

[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.440]
I've missed my last opportunity to bond with Moe

[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.040]
He's ain't gonna be here the rest of the way. Are you upset? I'm for Lauren. I hope he goes to New Orleans and has

[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.440]
Jumbo Laya ass, which is a combination of soup burn and

[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.420]

I know because he's gonna go over there and eat some some spicy food

[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.940]
And I hope when he's doing the Dolphin game with man is they both have just ass fire. I'm listening

Young man you man we see show to not

[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:08.060]
10 or 6 and 5 60 WQM happy Wednesday to you there moving the monument Alabama baby and CNN would like you to believe this is a big story

[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.400]
Is it a big story? No, it's a bunch of crap

[00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.940]
They're forcing it yeah, they're forcing it on us. That's what so late dad or Brian had so little bit to be on MSNBC

[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.940]
They keep it's like revolving cheers one week. They're unfoxed and they're on MSNBC

[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.740]
Then they're on CNN then they go back to fair and balanced Fox by the way. I got to get the Al Franken book

[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.160]
Yes, you did

[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.740]
Huh read excerpts of that instead of the swillery book? Oh, okay, that's not a bad idea

[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.440]
What's the name of the book?

[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.440]
It does say fair and balanced on a cover, but that's lies. What they must have been talking about mo

[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.600]
I'm listening about the lies lies in the lying liars who tell them or something like that

[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.820]
I see at any rate there are a movement of monument and they just moved it

[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.440]
It was two tons in the head of movement and go through a big star to dance. And this is a little bit like alien

[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:58.160]
Huh, yeah, I mean it won't last as long as alien, but it's on the same level as the once again the oh there is

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.320]
They had the spout

[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.320]
The audio is concerned we'll keep our and here's all these gets fees all these board again lunatics sitting there

[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.340]
And they're praying and they have their eyes closed and they're blah blah blah blah and the Lord this crazy people

[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.080]
That's America for you. This is the reason that we're in the shape that we're in

[00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:24.700]
Your president is one of these lunatics your president. He's a faker anyway. Well, he's faking it

[00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.140]
But in any rate the movers moved the controversial tent commandments monument at the Alabama judicial building

[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.580]
and

[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.780]
Chief justice Roy Moore told reporters

[00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.140]
That's what he said. Yeah, that's what he said

[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.340]
Workers inside the building move rope lines surrounding the monument shortly after 8 o'clock this morning and they put this thing on like on a dolly

[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.480]
Louis Armstrong was singing hello dolly in a background and they were ruled it. They're rolling it

[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.820]
They're rolling a big fat one and they got get used up there with their microphone

[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.180]
The commandment in the rotunda of the state

[00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.540]
Supreme Court is

[00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.880]
Pretty clearly to every judge that's looked at it an endorsement of

[00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.940]
Christianity right and it's unconstitutional and that should be the end of it

[00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.420]
But you got a bunch of religious fanatic getskeys like this and that's America for it's very very sad

[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.640]
Now I'm gonna do two polls today. How do you like that? Just to piss off mo

[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.800]
I'm listening because I know he's listening right now before his big trip to New Orleans and we sure hope that he has a safe trip

[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.620]
Be safe mo be safe

[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.800]
Uh this morning evidently because I heard just a little bit of it on here

[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.020]
But I didn't realize his performance inside the building was as psychotic as it evidently was partly read in the face hyper ventilating over the pool

[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.240]
We took yesterday and the amazing part of it mo

[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.460]
Is that we had more people vote on the pool even though I and I said we wouldn't get a lot of votes

[00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.640]
I mean we had 1200 that they before on whatever it was

[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.160]
976 that's more people than listen to mo in it sure

[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:53.480]
And it wasn't upset because of the fact that the wow it's the first time I listened and four months and if that's entertaining talking about dead people

[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.460]
Used to be on the radio but now that's not what I've said him and all the fact was that I talked about Rick Weaver and mr. Weaver by the way

[00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.980]
Who's as you couldn't lick with the longest tongue in a world mo with John Holmes tongue and penis

[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.140]
Uh, he came in a strong second

[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.640]
So what I'm gonna do just out of fairness

[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.860]
I'm gonna save the second mo bashing pool for a little bit later for a little bit not too much later, huh?

[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:17.460]
No, we're gonna take a preliminary mo bashing pool and maybe he'll turn out great

[00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:23.260]
Because I know he's listening right now and his ego took a tremendous wall up wait till I tell the Todd Brecht story about mo

[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.400]
I'm letting it all hang out today, huh? Good. No, I am. I'm holding nothing back

[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.080]
Wait till I tell you this story about his psychotic behavior a man who is toast

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.000]
He's like walking. Oh is it papyrus?

[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.320]
What's the onion skin? You know I'm talking about right to write on papyrus and ancient times papyrus or onion skin papyrus

[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:50.620]
Whatever that is thin skin man a man who's humorless a man who takes himself very seriously because he's got a drug and an ego

[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:56.340]
And he's an old funny dutty and everybody hates him like poison and he refuses to accept it. It's not me. It's everybody

[00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.240]
I'm listening. Well good have a good time. Okay. I'll be a phlegially to yourself

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:04.080]
Like you're listening. Hope you open up bloody wounds and sores like Pharrell said

[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:05.760]
Especially in your back. Oh

[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.460]
Anyway, so here's the preliminary poll which Eric isn't ready for this. He's gonna be he's well, man

[00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:16.300]
I'll still let him be upset. Oh, Faxid that'll make him ready for it. I have a written it out. Oh, I'm just making it up right now

[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.060]
No, I'm creating it. I see no

[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.080]
Because I know it was the Rick Weaver references that really got him all been out of shape and then he covers it up

[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.240]
Well, that was the worst show and my show is better any day the only problem is nobody listens to your show

[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.140]
No, that's the problem even Greg was just in here

[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.880]
Smirking about that he knows

[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:35.360]
He knows we'd like to get just like they had the dolly to move that goddamn monument in Alabama and Montgomery

[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:40.960]
Just moments ago we'd like to put you on a dolly and move your ass out of here. No, but they don't know how to get rid of you

[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.200]
That's the deal that that's the honesty in this truth. I'm listening

[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.660]
Like nothing better to move you to Alabama with a banjo on your knee or on your

[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.380]
Hairpiece and by the way next time get up a little bit earlier and get that thing straight enough

[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.860]
Can you believe somebody that looks in the mirror and comes to work looking like that?

[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.320]
Well, it was messed up in the back to quote him. Yeah

[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.800]
And maybe he doesn't have one of those mirrors, you know, where like the barber does that kind of barber finishes your hair cutting

[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:08.860]
He holds up the mirror in the back to see if you prove it the way he did handbearer. Right exactly. He's a big hand one

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.800]
It's it's I'll give you the first pull right now and then Eric can you write it down

[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.400]
You can maybe call him or not is the guy don't know. We'll get it on there. He's the season. He's in touch with it

[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:25.220]
The pull is the greatest dolphins play by play voice of all time was we did this once before long time ago

[00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:29.800]
We did yes long ago, but we hadn't given more enough time yet. Now he can't bitch about that

[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.120]
uh rick weaver

[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:35.640]
Bill Zimfer or Moha or David and

[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.980]
Then we'll also put a choice on there. I don't listen to the dolphin games, huh?

[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:43.700]
I mean we can put the mad dog on there. Nobody doesn't do the play by play

[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.440]
He'd win hands down because he's certainly the most popular if anybody ever connected with the games

[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.160]
But he doesn't do the play by play where the most the best dolphin play by play voice ever

[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.320]
You got it got it was Rick weaver bills him for or Moha or David or I don't listen to the dolphin games

[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.020]
And then we'll get into the real me to the matter since he inspired me because uh

[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.440]
I'm listening he listened for the first time of the show yesterday for four hours

[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.640]
And was just psychotic about how bad that pull was and I had to pull about dead people about how dare you do that

[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.520]
I better print it out that I print it out

[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.480]
Yeah, I did print it out so not Eric can change it anytime he wants

[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.300]
12 minutes after 10. I apologize profusely don't I?

[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:08.940]
The voters and we'll marry you again with grand name for real

[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:15.300]
Being that she's not she'll be and like it's not going well. He's been accused of being a woman

[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.820]
I don't read now. I don't read what I'd like to

[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.320]
Excellent

[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.980]
To the voters

[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.140]
What a suck up

[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:44.020]
10 17 at five 60 WQ I am let's see here's the facts from the name of the book by the way was the lies and the lying liars who tell them

[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:44.660]
That's the name of the

[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.800]
Al Franken book which is number one amazon.com already how do you like that?

[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:55.500]
Thanks to Fox News and the assholes on there to give them all that free publicity and then had to drop that lawsuit with their tail with a raccoon tail between their legs

[00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:01.180]
Okay, here we go the poll is up the early poll now. We're gonna leave this up there till what 11

[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:05.380]
What do you say what do you think what do you know won't need to leave it up that long

[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.200]
Oh, I look at little Jerry keeps writing Jerry. I don't read your facts

[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.780]
Okay, if I go back to typing them out you got a better chance of my at least reading one or two words little Jerry

[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.780]
I don't read any year pull any year of faxes or your pull if I don't think he's got a pull

[00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.720]
Here's the poll result from yesterday the one that Moe was so upset about

[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.540]
973 votes we had damn near a thousand votes

[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:27.440]
Now I'm gonna tell you something uh, there's nobody here

[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.280]
There's nobody in this town

[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.660]
So I'm pretty pleased with that

[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.200]
I mean you can see the results you can track the

[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.420]
number of people who are here based on the hits on our website

[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.020]
I'm serious. It's like a barometer of who's here and who's not

[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:45.240]
Let's get a hits. Yeah, those pictures of the beast should be up there

[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.560]
And there'll be a big hit quick the pictures of the beast will be on our website

[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.760]
That's another reason to go to the website today near Rogers.com is to see the beast with his raccoon cap on being like Moe Jr

[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.100]
I think I'm a urban kind of a younger shorter squatter

[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.440]
Better looking Mo. Well

[00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:06.100]
Huh? Well, although at least see this is part of the problem when you've got to get up at three o'clock in the morning to do a show

[00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:11.200]
That's five to eight or three thirty one you've got to get up an extra 15 minutes early to put the piece in place and glue it in

[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.580]
You know paste it down realize that time for that

[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.100]
That early in the morning somebody that's as vain as he is

[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.800]
But he's not that vain because he didn't take the time he needed it

[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.700]
He didn't take the time he was in a big rush

[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.080]
He won't be doing that again because everybody in a building was talking about his Daniel Boon do this morning

[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:28.640]
And about how his piece was like flying off in all directions

[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:34.620]
It was like a muskrat. We're like a muskrat in it couldn't figure out which direction it wanted to go in you know

[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.540]
Or maybe he had like a family of coons on his head that could have been it but two headed possum

[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.420]
Maybe he's the one that put the coons on my roof a couple of days ago

[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.780]
Anyway, we got thirty votes on the first pool here the best off and played by play voice ever

[00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:51.060]
Oh, I sure hope you to because this this will put him over the edge before his big trip to New Orleans

[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.480]
I don't want to do that. Do I? Oh?

[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:53.540]
Oh

[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.520]
Look at that. I never even realized we had this dropping malicious

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.840]
Haha it would be a malicious thing to do wouldn't I'm listening oh, I'm sorry

[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.720]
30 votes the best off and played by what play voice ever was I don't listen to the dolphin broadcast 12

[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:12.520]
Rick Weaver 11 builds in for five Mohawar David two so far

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.720]
Why are you trying to restrain your soul figure out who the second vote might have come from oh

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:24.320]
Oh, uh, muff was the first one and Mo was the second one. Mo probably got his laptop

[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.820]
He pulled off to the side of the road to vote because we know I'm listening

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.860]
He's listening even though he lies to his teeth and was the first time I listened to that show in four months

[00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:36.060]
He did a pull about dead people here's the results of the pull by the way Mo because I know you're very concerned

[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:40.040]
I thought we had a good time with it yesterday sure. That's probably what bothered him

[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:45.800]
See what bugs you was that people aren't interested in sports. Okay. See that's why for relis so much fun

[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.380]
He mixes a little bit of sports in there, but generally speaking it's with his craziness

[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:55.940]
It's would just be in a nutcase and with big racks and big these and big packages and would get in stone and stuff like that

[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.420]
That people care about as opposed to like a little bit of sports

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:05.040]
Horses that rational right a lot of horse and sluts that rational people care about as opposed to well that little league baseball world

[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:09.260]
Surrey's in that fluff tanner with a great arm. All of a sudden the bullcraft nobody cares. It's boring

[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.340]
It's ponderous. It's terminal and your pomp pomp is as even guilty hates him like poison

[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:21.300]
Anyway, who was your favorite soft food or radio or TV personality who was now dead and also one must have pissed him off as we didn't put him on there

[00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.640]
Because he's very close to qualifying when you think uh-huh

[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.480]
Micronary 164 one hands down nice going Mikey and let me say it again

[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.280]
Micronary was a good guy. Yes, he was we enjoyed working with her in area and Bob green you helped to kill him

[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.860]
You helped to put him in a premature grave. That's what his business does to people

[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.680]
That's why keep telling all you young punks out there to want to get into radio. Don't do it

[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:45.760]
Don't do it. You regret it. It's not stick. It's not a joke. I'm begging you

[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.040]
I'm begging you especially if you look good get a real job, huh? Get a real job. No, no

[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.120]
I mean some of us but very few you know they probably say well look at you

[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:56.500]
I mean you sit there on your ass four hours a day and you're making a fortune

[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.680]
How many people have been it not gone? I'm not gonna with both hands on wood okay, right in addition to which

[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.520]
I've gone through the ringer man to get to where I am now and you can tell by looking at me

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.940]
Oh, that was that is I used to look pretty good till I got in this business. Oh man

[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.780]
Ringer marks exactly

[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.660]
And stretch marks

[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.980]
Rick Weaver 107 very strong second for mr. Weaver who's on top now with 30 votes

[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:24.380]
See the people who are the real dolphin, but like for real this morning. I'm amazed that he said that can you believe that?

[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:25.660]
He didn't know who Rick Weaver was

[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.080]
What he's not from he you don't have to be am I from Pittsburgh do I know who Bob Prince was?

[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.180]
I don't know am I from New York? Do I know who male Allen was? I don't know who those people are

[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.240]
Am I from a Detroit all the way to the liver do I know who earning a hardwell is huh?

[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.540]
Am I from St. Louis or Chicago do I know Harry care even you know Harry?

[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.480]
Oh, yeah, he almost does drooled on us. There you go

[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.560]
So I'm really a little bit of course it's a sports thing and hurrah isn't a sports from plus probably mr. Weaver had a small v

[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.220]
Oh, let's see Rick Weaver 107 sunny hers 96 another good guy

[00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.160]
When you said Rick Weaver see I didn't know Rick well enough in addition to which my

[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.660]
My feelings about Rick Weaver were somewhat tainted by Bill Calder because Bill was my best friend at that time and

[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.060]
Bill, I don't know why didn't hang out with him personally just thought that Rick was a real dick

[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:20.940]
Maybe he was to think he had a huge ego, but I guess that goes with I will say one thing yeah for Zimper of the three people

[00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:27.320]
You know as much as I knew them or know them or whatever Zimper was the one guy that didn't have the big the big ego

[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:34.080]
Right, it's just a natural over here. We got with me slap happy guy. Didn't a nice workman like job

[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.120]
He and mad dog got along well. He didn't step on each other. He didn't infringe on mad dog's ability to do the thing

[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.480]
To do his thing, you know

[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.400]
Anyway, sunny hers 96 Glen the bird of hill had 88. How do you like that good for him?

[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.900]
Where the hell is it? Oh

[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:52.000]
And Bishop 85 big Wilson 68 Ralph Redneck had 49

[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.120]
See these Johnny come lately is that have been in the market for like five minutes if you said Ralph Renner could who's that who's that

[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.480]
David Bloom 41 what a what a tragedy good guy

[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:09.740]
Bill call to 36 great guy jack hole 35 Dave Dixon 30 Kevin Kitchens 18 roby young 17

[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.960]
Alan Burke 16 Larry can 15 Wayne Chandler 13 a wonderful guy. I want to do it just wait a wait

[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.520]
Lee Fowler and Mark Ludnermich had 11 Jerry Wichner and crazy Kramer each had 10

[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.940]
I don't think you've seen the two of them together Glenn rinker eight Jerry William seven Charlie backster six

[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:27.280]
I see I don't know who that was

[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.360]
You it was for kids mostly creature features remember creature features on channel six in the afternoon

[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:35.760]
No, he had a unibrow. No, he was the goal with the unibrow

[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.980]
Right Jim Dunlap five Ron Harrison for Claire Mosher for Richard Witt comes still spelled wrong

[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:46.040]
But less embarrassing and Alan Courtney and Del Frank each had three Del Frank may have been the greatest newsman

[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.680]
Whoever I was in this market. He was

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.340]
Professional bill Ross Alan Corbett Leijalett Dick Fennel each had a pair Jim Harper and Prescott Robinson one no votes for Gabriel heater

[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.840]
Because I still am not sure he was here more than five minutes and Ron hundred didn't have any maybe that's why he blew his brains out

[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.140]
Because nobody liked him

[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:04.880]
Oh, I shouldn't have said that because then Greg Budell might think about it, you know

[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.640]
They don't like you Greg. They hate you like poison everybody hates Greg Budell don't think

[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.940]
and of course

[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.340]
Huh see people that take it all serious. It's just a radio show. That's all

[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:19.160]
Don't take me all up tight

[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.960]
Don't take this uh like the end of the world

[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:28.040]
It's just a radio show that's all but some people take it serious. I'm listening. Okay. Well, how are you doing so far?

[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.640]
I'll look at that 83 quick votes on there

[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:34.280]
The best off and played by play voice ever ever

[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.220]
Rick weaver 35

[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.520]
I don't listen to it often broadcast

[00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.520]

Let's see him his wife is office

[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:04.880]
Errogant condescending

[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.400]
You know the whole deal they just see this is what happens and this is this is the best part of his work

[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.020]
Would be on a question even he'd agree with that

[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:17.800]
That's his best work and they still don't like him because they dislike you so intensely mo because you're such an old hard-ass

[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:25.620]
Even clearance said that the the beast is lightning up a little bit. He's not as much of a hard-ass as he used to be soft-ass

[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:29.100]
He's more like exactly like a soft-ass an old soft-ass

[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.800]
Now seriously, I think you know something if you keep rubbing with him as much humor as we're making about this

[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.740]
I think there may actually be something there. I think no. I think there's something

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.500]
No, seriously. I think there's something there for the both of them because neither one of them is ever going to

[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:48.680]
It laid with a female or like another human being beside you know, maybe they don't care. So it's then against the world

[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.140]
It's them against each other. They'll always have each other is that friction then against each other

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.480]

[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.740]
Almost 300 dead

We're gonna send him a message

[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.940]

Grade Z movie actor running for governor of the largest state in the country. That's our smallest problem

[00:25:30.980 --> 00:25:33.460]
And what is the news media worried about?

[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:38.820]
They're worried about the monument in Montgomery, Alabama in the state house

[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:39.300]
Marguerite

[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.100]

Mm-hmm my my my

[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.580]
So once again that part about in bowling for colabine where he shows the Canadians watching like the cbc

[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.860]
And like real honest to goodness news and then the Americans watching all this if it bleeds it leads hysteria

[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.520]
They're doing bled shit right on the highway and moving out of the crazy religious nuts. Oh look at that

Here's the fact that I can barely read bad the ink

[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.100]

[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.100]
Come on get with it forgot

[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.640]

[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.440]
You better get your uh ducks in order in a row

[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.740]
144 votes on our first temporary pool

[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.620]
That's probably more than moe has people listening per quarter hour. I'm listening 152 votes now like I said

[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.160]
Best off see it. Here's the bottom line moe. We're not programming to you

[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:52.120]
We're programming to the best. I know that comes as a great shock

[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:56.320]
We're programming to the best audience out there to like have a sense of humor and hate you like poison

[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.620]
That's who we're programming to

[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:04.820]
So the best idea is if you don't listen I'm listening just like Joe Rose said don't listen to none like easy 101.5

[00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.460]
To not some slush turn on k a t

[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.880]
Listen to a Bach and Beethoven through all the slush and nostalgic and have a good time and get out of our face

[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.420]
Requiver the best off and play my playboy's ever was and that is the right answer

[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.460]
Requiting I see you got to also keep in mind that rick weaver didn't do the hasn't done the games for like 10 or 11 years now

[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.900]
Even clearance would admit that the rick weaver was the best

[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:34.700]
See, Clarence says yes, that's right and didn't he just say that he raised his head you didn't you phony baloney you ass sucker

[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.160]
Man, I'm gonna tell all the stories about you in the beast if you look at it. He now he's attacking George

[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:44.520]
Oh, he must have the beast must have to put out last night now. He's coming up on George from behind

[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.700]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:51.260]
He said he'll see the night at the ramrod George would have read by that

[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.100]
Something about Ramrod

[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.600]
Was I just say before he came in here and got me all thrown off course right now about

[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:04.040]
Weaver didn't do the games for like what 11 years ago, cuz since we're gonna listen to me forget about him

[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.040]
We're in the middle of our god damn show. Forget about small possubus or a problot talk. What is that?

[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.420]
It's important to holol talk I believe that I believe that

[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:16.860]
so uh... zimper did a games for nine years

[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.560]
and more than a for like a year this is a second season so it's about ten or

[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.120]
eleven years since mister we've been all games so in spite of that he's still

[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.580]
number one with fifty seven votes

[00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.040]
zimper forty four

[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.540]
i don't listen to the often broadcast forty which is probably a lot of us who

[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.000]
watch them on tv note-run on the radio

[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]
or just don't care on the other hand and mohauer david only eleven out a hundred

[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.840]
fifty two votes

[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.660]
that's only seven point two percent

[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.980]
while if you were listening i'm listening that would like to just just

[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:44.260]
burst his ego you know

[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.040]
you you in fact you you can probably hear it on the highway

[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:48.780]

over the place this morning

[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:08.460]

[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.180]
since slumping hair piece in slumping ratings

[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:15.120]

[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:29.500]
yeah

[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:40.800]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again.

[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.700]
Nah, I don't think so.

[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:47.500]
So we had Luke the Brassi Pam a little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature

[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.280]
would wind up on the contract.

[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.440]
That's some of a bitch's cute.

[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.100]
All right.

[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.080]
All right.

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:36:59.480]

[00:36:59.480 --> 00:36:59.480]

[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.600]
And it's sings.

[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:05.760]

[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.260]
It's 11 to 11. We hit a natural here at 560 WQM. Happy Wednesday to you

[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:37.420]
207 votes on a pool so far. Let's get those phones going. What do you say don't answer them by the way? Oh good

[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:42.660]
Why no? Well, they're screenless all this week because it's the very least that I can do

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:49.040]
207 votes the best off and play by play voice ever on you just missed if you aren't watching CNN

[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.020]
If people out there in the audience you just missed jack orkheimer the stargather

[00:37:53.860 --> 00:38:00.000]
She was on there with on CNN with the worst piece even making mosehair piece look like real like Charles Alfieiri

[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.740]
I'm in here. I have never seen nothing like that. It looked like you said it looked like it fell out of the sky

[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:09.840]
Maybe it felt from Mars. It's the red planet. It was a red piece just fell on this horror-commerce head

[00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:15.000]
And didn't have time to like shove it back into place bad hair pieces man. Not a good idea

[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.240]
Another good reason to go see Chuck Alfieiri, which I see that spots coming up momentarily nice segue Neil. Thank you

[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:26.120]
207 votes on a pool Rick Weaver the best off and play by play voice ever 78 votes

[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:32.560]
And when you consider the passage of time like I said it's been like 11 seasons now since mr. Weaver did a dolphin game

[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.440]
That's a great tribute to a once living legend

[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:38.600]
Yeah

[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.420]
Bill Zimper 60

[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:46.320]
60 votes for Bill Zimper I bet you know who voted one of the votes for him. Oh right. Yeah

[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.840]
I don't listen to dolphin broadcast 57 and mohauer David had 12

[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.180]
5.7% out of 207 votes

[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:04.180]
And I realize these polls are very bad radio. It's a bad show. I apologize profusely for doing such bad radio for nearly 30 years in this time

[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.800]
But it's the best of the people old man like me can do and of course saddle with George what do you expect from us?

[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:14.780]
So we're just in addition to a speaking of that little gravel ovens thick that he's always like picking on your ass and trying to get you fired

[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:19.040]
And I am gonna do an entire show about him today every everything I talk about no seriously

[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.960]
I it was the farthest thing for my mind until I got in the car this morning

[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.780]
He was ranting and raving about I'll show on dead people yet and then I come in here

[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:32.400]
Fight out that he was a ballistic and right in the face about it and screaming at guilty and for all and everybody about that show

[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:37.080]
Rick the janitor he was screaming at Rick the janitor because he thought that he was related to Rick Weaver

[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:42.200]
Anybody named Ricky ain't too crazy about it. I guess you don't like dick

[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.860]
Only 14 votes for the moment out of 213 that's sad now

[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:51.500]
What was I just about to say that was so important you were gonna read me or something?

[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:53.280]
No, no, no, no, no

[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:59.180]
Since I know that I'm listening you're listening probably right there in your house in Boka which I have the address right here

[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:05.400]
Not really don't see we wouldn't stoop to that because we don't have to what's the point we keep it right here in the building

[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.420]
There's more than enough to go around you

[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.200]
But the fact of the matter is that like in the last trend and in the last book

[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.920]
Well, let's just take what the last trend because you were on more than I was in July

[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.060]
beat him

[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:23.840]
And when you when you excreparate what the for real probably didn't that morning, you know

[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.580]
They had a five and then we had a seven one

[00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:29.600]
But when you consider that Moe had about a two and for all had an eight probably

[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:31.460]
What's could they move them into the night otherwise?

[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:36.020]
Listen to me the point I'm trying to make and also last summer didn't you beat him last summer?

[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:40.740]
Well, yeah, yes, so here's little George who takes so much crap from almost everybody out there

[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:47.160]
He sucks. He's boring. He talks about eating ass too much. He's a guava love and speck all of these things and

[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.220]
It still beats the crap out of you Mo

[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:57.500]
So what's what's the deal that we do such boring crap and the pull was embarrassing and you're all flustered and full

[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:03.520]
The bottom line is you're a flustered because of the fact I talked about Rick Weaver and the fact is that he was legendary

[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:10.380]
He was identified with the dolphins like from the inception of the team practice right and run on for the day that he hung up his jock strap

[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:17.340]
That's correct broadcast both years the dolphins won the Super Bowl the undefeated the phenomenal year

[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:21.720]
All of these things I even remember that how do you like that?

[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:29.920]
As opposed to a guy who comes in here with suspicious origins with the green and white they hated jets and

[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.540]
Sucks up to people like the anxious mark the jets fan people like that. Oh

[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.480]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.960]
So you've gone out of your way to see you ought to be ecstatic you ought to be happy because he's worked over time to turn everybody

[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:48.240]
Against them, which I guess he does everywhere that he lands and he succeeded in

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.840]
In his book successes making everybody hate him like and you've succeeded. Oh, I've gone, baby

[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.040]
We all hate you like poison

[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:00.280]
And I'm if I would have realized that he wasn't gonna be here tomorrow and Friday because naturally

[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:03.480]
He's got that big game in New Orleans tomorrow that lasted the exhibitionist games

[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.720]
And you don't think that they're gonna be able to get back here in time for him to be up Friday morning

[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.420]
Do a show do you know?

[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.020]
So I see that girl the solo tomorrow and Friday, which means we'll have a real good time in here

[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:17.580]
Can you imagine how pleasant the environmental being is I can come in like 730 huh?

[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:23.480]
Because even somebody I don't want to get anybody in trouble, but somebody was saying to me a little while ago

[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.360]
How it's fun to come to work now now that we got for well in there sure as

[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:31.200]
Supposed to be for for well was here and you know

[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.320]
It's coming during the same period of time and everybody was walking on eggshells and afraid to fart in the hallway

[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.440]
Or they get bitched out for it, you know now it's fun

[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:43.160]
We said just huddling our little rooms because now from 8 a.m. Till midnight. We're kicking ass on Q.A.M

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.480]
I don't mistake about it

[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.660]
Look at that

[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:53.680]
What time did we start this poll what time did I get it up like 1015 1015 so 40 minutes less than 40 minutes

[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:55.000]
We have 229 votes

[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.360]
And this is just a preliminary poll. This ain't even the meat of the matter. This ain't even the heavy duty

[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.120]
The best off and played by play voice ever

[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:09.360]
229 votes. It's just changing again 233 vote

[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.500]
Mr. Weaver Rick Weaver 88

[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:18.220]
I don't listen to the dolphin broadcast 67 those in for 64 and Mo. Howard David had

[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.620]
14

[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:23.380]
And even 6

[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:33.360]
Is that in just heads is that embarrassing is that humiliating is that degrading is that just unbelievable?

[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.040]
Don't forget go out and see what's his name Troy Troy the boy the sac canon and Miguel

[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.340]
I wonder if that pictures up on our website. I did email that successfully the Eric by the way

[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.700]
Probably take my mom or two to get that on it. I'll check with him. It is cute. I mean

[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:52.920]
I'm not saying it's like Earth shaking. It's not like a mole morphs into a Celia Cruz

[00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.860]
Quite that entertaining, but it is it's amusing

[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.620]
It's instructions on how to pitch a tent

[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.960]

Last week when I was

[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:20.480]
Listening to the real Howard who went on to a major commercial. I flipped over to the other Howard and this caller called up and

[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.640]
Was just telling him how wonderfully was how great he was for standing up to Neil

[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:30.540]
Yeah, and I'm thinking myself you got to be kidding me. I go this guy Neil

[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:38.400]
Is destroying this guy verbally. He did the Steve Kane and you think that this guy's actually

[00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:44.300]
Standing up to Neil and it was like unbelievable how he was like same. Well, I'm from Brooklyn in

[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:49.060]
New York and coming across people like Neil is no big deal

[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:52.680]
Yeah, but he's from Brooklyn. So what does that mean? What was that proof?

[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.600]
Not much to me. I'm from Rochester. What the hell does that mean?

[00:44:55.700 --> 00:45:00.300]
You know I'm from England. They're all well. Listen. We nobody's perfect exactly. At least you're not from Buffalo

[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:33.180]
We're gonna have 272 votes on our preliminary pool on our little four-play pool two hot nearly 300 votes in considerably less than an hour

[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.220]
How do you like that? Mo

[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:42.440]
The best off and played by playboys ever was Rick weaver 106

[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:45.480]
Don't listen to the dolphin broadcast 82

[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:50.440]
Bill's in for 69 and Moe Howard David had

[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.380]
15 5.5 percent out of 272 15

[00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:58.520]
They're just voting that way because you talk bad about it

[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:04.560]
When we bitch about her right right no chance

[00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:06.240]
No

[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:14.380]
Okay, here's the arrest of the poll we'll get rid of that thing because it's pretty obvious mr. Weaver winsít in for a second

[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:17.820]
they don't I mean dead last there were only four categories, you know

[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.200]
It shouldn't have been too hard when there were only been three people who done the dolphin games over the years

[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:24.440]
It should be kind of difficult to come in worse than third

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:26.640]
But he came in fourth

[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:33.260]
And I mean a distant fourth even 69 votes for Bill's infer but only 15 from Moe Howard David had

[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:38.840]
they don't vote because i tell him how many times they they always say yeah

[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.320]
whatever they vote they vote they feel it

[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.460]
they emoted here's the real pull now let's get to it eric and oh and by the way

[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:36.280]
he had a big ego he's 21 out of his jockstrap he knew his stuff but uh

if you have a problem with athletes who leave sports they go into broadcasting

[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.240]
and then they slam the media all the time yeah and i was going to say you know

[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.020]

up america first is able so it's not some professional i don't know i mean

[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.500]
they're just all crazy there is one sentence in here that's right dozens of

[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:19.220]
Jewish children have been massacred at pizza parlors night clubs and on buses

[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:22.480]

you know this bull crap about well it's the last democracy in the middle i say

[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.280]
let's just get that out of there it's a lost cause and all this crap the road

[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.040]
mad for peace and then bushes on her saying well you know the uh... rack attack

[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:53.280]

[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:56.080]
terrorism than he's right yeah because then it worked like a charm was vital

[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.700]
right i mean you know the american public has got to stop being quite so

[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.440]

[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:09.020]
jackass right wing born again bible thumping asshole in munchery alabama

[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.340]
and the fuss they're making about that which would come as no surprise

[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.040]
because we know we know all we need to know about religious fanatics

[00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:20.120]
we have we need and every time there's any kind of a story where they can find some

[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:24.520]
kind of an angle here's Jerry fallwell here's pat robertson here's some other

[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.380]
getskey on air hot kind of china with bull crap okay what what all they got to do with

[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.100]
keep your nose out of american life because if you're religious if you're uh

[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.880]
groupies if you're gasky's if they want to follow you and subsidize you that's

[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:41.000]
up to them but leave the rest of us alone and quit coming on their pretending

[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.980]
to the tap it's just like the pope the pope telling us to do this and not to do that

[00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:50.060]
and get nervous breakdown about gay marriages what the hell is it his god damn

[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.640]

[00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.460]
votes to get to an even three hundred in an hour that would be good not record breaking but damn

[00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:32.900]
near almost alien type especially with nobody in town while we're still kicking ass how do you

[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:37.360]

[01:12:38.820 --> 01:12:40.300]
we got Joe Rose in today

[01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:41.200]
oh look out

[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:41.980]

[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:42.640]

[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:46.940]
for the ball game

[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:50.420]
Then for a look at this we got the Humber back today.

[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.140]
Oh right.

[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:55.440]
Thank you son from Vegas another tough assignment for Hank 4 to 6 30.

[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.540]
Another tough two and a half hour show that in fact it's not even that you want to know why why because of the ballgame beat on tomorrow.

[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.500]
It's kind of like a Friday before a Sunday.

[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.720]
So we got the Dave wants that show 5 to 6 on tape.

[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:15.780]
So thanks on for an hour and then for like a half hour after the wants that show nice going Humber.

[01:13:15.940 --> 01:13:16.560]
I love it.

[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.100]
What a scam him and they learn from the best.

[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.600]
In fact, mad dog told me when he was in here the other day on Monday.

[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.740]
He said I learned from the master less work more pay and they're doing a hell of a job of it.

[01:13:27.100 --> 01:13:34.320]
Then you got Marlon's on deck at 6 30 Marlon's who've lost 6 out of 7 but miraculously are still tied with a Phillies who are who lose every day.

[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:37.520]
For the wild card at the moment, but Arizona's on it.

[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:40.020]
They got like 7 teams now within 2 games for the wild card.

[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:43.540]
Marlon's at the pirates tonight, 7 0 5 after the Marlon's on deck.

[01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.240]
Eddie K follows the baseball game.

[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.100]
Jo and Mark overnight.

[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.040]
Now you almost let me forget something very important today.

[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.400]
Hey, don't forget because people are always saying, oh, all you do is rip and rip.

[01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:54.140]
You don't fat rich reminds me of my mother.

[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:54.880]
It was about fat rich.

[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.820]
Yeah, well, you didn't tell me to remind you to say it on the air.

[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.720]
That's when I was talking about it.

[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:00.700]
I said, don't let me forget.

[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.760]
I want to mention it on the air now because he deserves credit.

[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.580]
It'll inspire him and he deserves it.

[01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:14.040]
I mean, you know, about 20 or 30 near death, about 30 near death experiences may have inspired him, but nevertheless better late than never.

[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:14.440]
Right.

[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:15.400]
Better late than dead.

[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.320]
He's lost 120 pounds.

[01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:19.240]
So I'm at Pompeo last night for the summer casting.

[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.000]
My friend Derek had the luring riders to refuse on it.

[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.220]
So he stayed like, thanks for staying away, Derek.

[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:24.900]
You're a great guy.

[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:25.280]
We love you.

[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.980]
But you know, he was considered enough.

[01:14:28.100 --> 01:14:30.100]
He didn't want to give us whatever he's got, especially me.

[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.280]
I don't want before I have a trip and I'm getting a hell out of here.

[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.140]
Yeah, when it be something to come down here and get sick again, that would be bad.

[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:37.820]
That would be bad.

[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.200]
That would be bad.

[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:42.620]
Especially since I've been so healthy except the last time I was here, I had that little stroke.

[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.820]
From being lethargic and being fat.

[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.760]
And he inspired me, fat rich last night.

[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:49.640]
That's inspirational.

[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:50.600]
He really looks good.

[01:14:50.860 --> 01:14:51.840]
Slimy looks for him.

[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:52.440]
He looks great.

[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:56.080]
He needs to get like, like maybe one size smaller shirt, Richard.

[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.300]
No, he's still crazy.

[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.600]
He's still wearing those same pub tents and it looks kind of like ludicrous and pulling up the pantaloons.

[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.820]
But as fat people, we're used to pulling our pants up, you know.

[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:04.880]
Huh?

[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.420]
They have suspenders now.

[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:07.220]
Oh, I see.

[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.660]
Nice ball, where do you keep it up?

[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.160]
He look great.

[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:16.480]
Jason and sunrise faxes me an article from the news insider.org about the message behind a blast.

[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:21.380]
You when was hit for a reason already had that on our website that maybe not exactly the same article, but we had it on there.

[01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:27.620]
Also Jason says the people in Alabama wouldn't care for was the Quran instead of the Ten Commandments.

[01:15:27.620 --> 01:15:29.880]
And Jason, you are absolutely correct.

[01:15:30.180 --> 01:15:32.080]
Of course not because they don't care from the Quran.

[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:38.220]
They don't care from the Mormon Joseph Smith and his 14 tablets take to and call me in the morning.

[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.660]
They don't care about that stuff.

[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:47.660]
All they care about is the Christian Bible, the Ten Commandments and the Christ name and all this other crap, you know.

[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.920]
In Colourment Goium, that's the biggest problem in America today.

[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.640]
Stupid people and in Colourment Goium, that's our poor for tomorrow.

[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:55.920]
That's a good poor, huh?

[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:02.480]
I mean, we did that thing about what bugs you the most on Monday, but I think this is the America's biggest problem.

[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:03.460]
There you go.

[01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:04.600]
George W. Bush.

[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.300]
Stupid, stupid, stupid, idiotic people.

[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.060]
Exactly.

[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:10.060]
Evil douish.

[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:10.920]
Evil douish.

[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.580]
In Colourment religious assholes.

[01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.280]
We got a whole lot of them.

[01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.000]
Don't let me forget.

[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:16.880]
Amor Grants.

[01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:17.700]
Don't let me forget.

[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.200]
All right.

[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.460]
You won't like this facts though.

[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:20.380]
Whatever.

[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:24.320]
Although I don't like the facts either, I am so sick and tired of people who keep asking me about this.

[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:24.940]
It's stupid.

[01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.700]
Hello, Neil. Welcome back.

[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:30.900]
It says we'd like to know if the battle between you and Moish, stick or not.

[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:31.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:32.840]
I am tired of that.

[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:34.420]
There's no stick.

[01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:36.680]
Okay, the only stick is I say to him.

[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.500]
Stick it up your ass.

[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:41.060]
I don't do it appearance without three people asking me that.

[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.560]
No, there is no stick.

[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:47.400]
And in spite of the fact, remember that time he was trying to like suck up for whatever reason?

[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.480]
Because he was looking for an ally when Joe Rose started on leash unloading on him.

[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.820]
So he thought he would turn to me as an ally.

[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.020]
You're turning the wrong way, Mo.

[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:55.320]
Maybe that's why that piece is drooping.

[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:57.100]
Forget about it.

[01:16:58.060 --> 01:17:01.640]
I mean, ordinarily, I'm not the kind of person that holds a grudge, but in his case, I'll make an exception.

[01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:06.020]
Because there's so much crap that he pulled starting with trying to get your ass fired.

[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.440]
And then of course all the crap that he pulled on me and this show and everything else.

[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:10.920]
It's unconscionable.

[01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:16.520]
Not to mention the other people in there that he between Carolyn and the Beast and you name it right on down the line.

[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:16.740]

[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:20.280]
The man has just pulled off too much crap.

[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.640]
He's alienated everybody, but including the salespeople, including Todd Dreck.

[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:29.660]
You know, that sexual harassment that the corporate meeting that you had last week or whatever the hell it was, weaker two ago.

[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.420]
Yeah, last week.

[01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:32.980]
So he goes in there.

[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.640]
It wasn't the meeting you were at because you were on the air.

[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:39.880]
So you went to the second one, but the preliminary meeting with Greg Reed supervising, which I still think is amusing.

[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:45.500]
And anyway, he goes in there and Todd says, damn, hey, Mo, something about, you know, mode this mode that.

[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:48.300]
Well, needless to say, he don't care for that.

[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.620]
And I forget the rest of what Todd said.

[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:52.340]
Something I'm using, something that nobody would pay any attention to.

[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:54.180]
So lo and behold, the meeting ends.

[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:55.560]
Mo drives home to Boka.

[01:17:55.920 --> 01:17:57.780]
And within moments of his arrival in the house.

[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.940]
There is an email pops up on Todd Dreck's email.

[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:03.660]
Todd Dreck.

[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:05.140]
Do we have some kind of a problem?

[01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.520]
Is there something I've done to offend you?

[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:15.540]
Do we have a whole defensive, psychotic email pops up over over nothing from him from Mo.

[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:17.420]
He emails people.

[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.100]
He calls the hotline calls the house line.

[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:21.320]
He emails people.

[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:22.980]
Right.

[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:29.100]
See, my best suggestion, and I do, you know, you play a lot of golf, which is for people who are bored to tears.

[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:29.820]
Get a life.

[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:31.280]
Find a hobby.

[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:32.460]
Take up Ma Zhong.

[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.420]
Take up a part easy.

[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.580]
Shuffleboard would be great.

[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:37.420]
It's good exercise.

[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:39.300]
There's probably more exercise than that than golf.

[01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:41.540]
You could have just turned around and said, you talking to me, asshole?

[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:42.480]
I'll take you out.

[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.520]
Something is something to Todd.

[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:46.920]
Todd comes up to his knee.

[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:47.100]
Right.

[01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.680]
He could have just stepped on him.

[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:48.720]
Right.

[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.600]
He could have stepped on him.

[01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:51.140]
He could have stepped on him.

[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:51.960]
He could have hit him with his bag.

[01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:53.800]
That's the thing, but you're missing the point.

[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:55.320]
It was all over nothing.

[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:55.860]
Right.

[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.780]
But, you know, if somebody says something to you that you don't like.

[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:02.020]
Like what?

[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:04.280]
Like, uh, hey, faggot.

[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:04.820]
Yeah.

[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.360]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.200]
Let me find out.

[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.080]
I say that to me, as my name don't wear it out.

[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:08.600]
Hey, Nelly.

[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.040]
Hey, Nelly.

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.620]
You know, something.

[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:10.740]
You know, you don't call me that.

[01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:11.340]
Hey, asshole.

[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:13.060]
You know, you, you just tell him right now.

[01:19:13.140 --> 01:19:14.800]
I don't have any problem with any of the things you just said.

[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:14.940]
Right.

[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.340]
But just a, for example, you just say it right there.

[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:18.340]
It's like, hey, asshole.

[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:22.180]
Don't, uh, you know, you'll call me that and I won't call you something, you know, make something up.

[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.900]
Anyway, this fac says, goes on to say I'm glad that I had that exchange with you right there.

[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.120]
It says, um, if not, how does management love those great picks of money on a website?

[01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.180]
Management has no control over our website.

[01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.160]
Management, I'll say that, but I can't say much for them.

[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:38.600]
They got nothing new with our website.

[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:41.740]
And please replace George with suds.

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:42.940]
Your share would double or more.

[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:44.520]
It's not personal and strictly business.

[01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:46.360]
It says somebody again, pick it on you.

[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.980]
Even though you kicked ass in in July and in the summer book.

[01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:49.240]
Right.

[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:51.520]
And even though suds wouldn't be in the building if it worked for my efforts.

[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.500]
And even though suds as much as I love him, he can't do the show alone.

[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.340]
When Rick would be out sick, there was a tape.

[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:58.300]
There was no reconcensual.

[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.820]
He's a good sidekick.

[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.240]
He can't do the show alone.

[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:04.880]
For some bizarre reason, which we've never been able to figure out.

[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:05.860]
I asked him about that.

[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:06.320]
What he said.

[01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:07.660]
They just wouldn't let him.

[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.360]
So the theory is you can fill in all these blanks.

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:11.580]
No.

[01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:12.920]
As, uh, no.

[01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:13.620]
That's something to do with it.

[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:14.100]
Why?

[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:15.320]
Maybe Rick had to.

[01:20:15.320 --> 01:20:18.620]
Oh, there he goes again, picking on my close personal friend Rick Riley.

[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:20.020]
That's not, that's a lie.

[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:21.940]
Oh my god.

[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:22.540]
Did you think the theory?

[01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:23.500]
Something to do with it's possible.

[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.360]
No, I don't believe that.

[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:30.600]
He just doesn't, uh, he, he doesn't have the presence to do a show alone.

[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.300]
Do you know what I'm saying?

[01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:33.840]
No, I don't know how to explain it to you.

[01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:34.880]
Have you heard his thing?

[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:35.640]
Have you heard him do a show alone?

[01:20:35.660 --> 01:20:35.900]
Yes.

[01:20:36.100 --> 01:20:36.740]
Okay, I didn't.

[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.200]
He, I don't know.

[01:20:39.560 --> 01:20:40.560]
I don't want to pick on suds.

[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:41.480]
He's listening right now.

[01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:42.060]
He's a good guy.

[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:42.660]
Love suds.

[01:20:42.740 --> 01:20:44.300]
But it's just not, not his bag.

[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.340]
I'm listening.

[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.420]
See, he's even, uh, imitating Yamona.

[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.280]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:53.160]
18 till noon at 560 WQM on a great Wednesday, man.

[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:53.680]
It's phenomenal.

[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:56.300]
We got the mad dog in the, we had no, we don't.

[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:57.820]
We got the mad dog going to wait in New Orleans.

[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.920]
We got Dave Hagen who took the call that day that prompted your roast to go ballistic on the air.

[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:06.500]
Yeah, that fake call that never happened.

[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.980]
Maybe, maybe, maybe with suds, fake in most voices.

[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:09.740]
Yeah, we're listening.

[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:10.540]
I'm listening.

[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:11.660]
He suds does a good mo.

[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:14.420]
18 till noon at QA.

[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.480]
And by now, I am positive that you heard me talk a lot about laminits arussian.

[01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.840]
How laminated wood flooring from laminits arussian is the easy, the smart, the low maintenance alternative to natural wood flooring.

[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.240]
And that natural wood flooring is so expensive, by the way.

[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:30.600]
Laminits arussian is the best place to find laminated wood flooring at affordable prices from the top names in a binus.

[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:33.580]
Peridor, Pergo, Wilson Art, Uniflor, and Quickstep, they got them all.

[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:36.640]
All the top names all installed by Pergo certified installers.

[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.820]
Here's another reason why I'd be calling laminits arussian.

[01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:40.220]
Their prices will floor you.

[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.100]
Right now, you can get their summer special for just 1995 bucks.

[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.060]
Let me say it again.

[01:21:45.420 --> 01:21:50.420]
Just 1995 bucks gets you up to 380 square feet of beautiful laminated wood flooring.

[01:21:50.420 --> 01:21:52.140]
It is positively unreal.

[01:21:52.740 --> 01:21:55.160]
And laminits arussian will match any legitimate written offer too.

[01:21:55.560 --> 01:22:03.980]
For a free and home estimate with positively no obligation, call laminits arussian toll free, 1-877-773336.

[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:04.940]
What could be easier?

[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:09.620]
They could be a free carpet disposal, fee furniture, moving at 25-year warranty and years and years.

[01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.120]
A beautiful easy care laminated wood flooring.

[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.840]
Call laminits arussian toll free until that old, that old asshole Neil Thurde to call.

[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:16.420]

[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.620]

Sだideo Break them down anão

[01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:00.500]
If you think you are a Los Angeles

[01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:05.580]
built computer. And I said your site is my home page excellent but I can't

[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:11.800]
listen live, can't vote, can't buy a CD. All saved page cannot be displayed if

[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.700]
Carlos or someone can tell me hey Dennis you got a great sense of humor. Carlos

[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:21.280]
saying here no mo won't hear him no mo. I can tell you what my internet settings

[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:24.200]
for my tools menu ought to be I'd appreciate they'll also have a visa rated by

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.960]
the new CD. What do we do? It tells us a problem with his internet service provider

[01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:33.240]
to me. He needs help with his tool. Please help Neil if you call me I'll

[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.180]
personally give my credit card number to purchase the CD. No what we should do

[01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:41.560]
is give him a Miguel's number. What do we what do I do with that? Do I be

[01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:51.500]
having it? You got it? 305. Wait a minute 305. 650. 650. 01. 56. 0156. I should be

[01:24:51.500 --> 01:24:58.520]
writing that down here. 305. 650. 0156. Yes. Call Miguel direct leave a message

[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.940]
if he's busy servicing Doreen and leave a message in there and he'll get

[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:06.280]
back to you Dennis and he'll arrange it for you. As far as the internet thing is

[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:09.200]
concerned it's probably something in his settings he's got a brand new

[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.440]
computer he needs to set it up right. Presence is I can't vote no mo and that's

[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:18.000]
bad because a lot of people want to vote on no mo. Where the hell is that drop it?

[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:25.000]
Oh so here's the result so far. On their second pool now it's interesting he's

[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.900]
doing a little bit better on this pool than he was on in fact quite a bit better

[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:32.520]
than to play by play which everybody thought was his strong suit you know the

[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.860]
one with the lemon green pants and lime jacket. 144 votes why don't you listen to

[01:25:37.860 --> 01:25:42.160]
the Mohauer David at your own QA him he's a pop his old ass 58 he's acting

[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:04.860]
himself nine oh okay well I mean I'm sure he's up there in Boker right now

[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:08.940]
listening even though we claims he don't listen to this show and lies through

[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:13.700]
his teeth about it I mean I just how can you possibly go through your entire

[01:26:13.700 --> 01:26:18.140]
life being having to lie about even a little tiny things and make it a big deal

[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:22.640]
I it's just a man in search of a life why bother what's the part well exactly

[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.760]
what's the cops it's called being obsessed obsessed so anyway good luck

[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.760]
Dennis and thanks for doing your thing for us now we got something very important

[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:35.860]
come up at noon what do you look like that for noon to two today we got our

[01:26:35.860 --> 01:26:39.600]
he vandead oh that's right well it's big in a hit so anyway the guy in Chicago

[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:45.420]
was shot he's still alive and the part I like is he's in custody but they don't

[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:49.020]
know whether the cops shot him we shot himself but he's still alive so in other

[01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:51.920]
words if he shot himself he's a bad aim you know like you shot himself in the

[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:56.880]
foot probably not a good idea and he shot a couple of people inside the factory

[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.820]
and the whether they're dead or alive they still haven't bother telling us yet

[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:03.640]
and that's it and now Leon Harris goes on other stories because it wasn't you

[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.800]

Copens between now and two o'clock is that like a bar or something a restaurant

here no we don't know if I've got one of these repeats I don't know because I'm

[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:51.620]
getting so far ahead of myself I keep like throwing the pages of log in the

[01:31:51.620 --> 01:31:58.680]
Schmidt can you know I'm saying no what I it's not important for you it's

[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.300]
important for me that I get all this stuff lined up over here I'm not I'm not

[01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:04.700]
really paying off a lot of attention that's all right nobody else I mean I

[01:32:04.700 --> 01:32:07.720]
get I get paid the same with the right pay a lot of attention or like not at

[01:32:07.720 --> 01:32:21.260]
all I prefer to ladder Mark Morgan is the 12 to 1 hour on Q a m

[01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:26.580]
of

[01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:50.860]
mentally

[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:50.860]

[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:50.860]

[01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:51.080]
mac

[01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.280]
No one should say this cause it is crap

[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.020]
I could have made me just special in my ass

[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:58.400]
No one would see a movie with a three pass

[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.300]
Cause no one said I'm movie-fied

[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:03.480]
It's powerful and the big star

[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:06.200]
Because if you admit the worst movie by far

[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:08.580]
And the thing that really hurts it must be we sure

[01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:11.600]
Now everyone knows I'm movie-re-device

[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.220]
We as nuclear programmer are either progressing nicely

[01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:16.680]
For that more US soldiers killed in Fallujah in Iraq

[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:18.680]
They're every day they're dying, they're dying over there

[01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.740]
You know for a pompous fact guy that talks at you good game now because that Eric or mole

[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:20.460]
That we're talking about

[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:25.200]
But Eric has done a spectacular job since we a Schmidt-Candat little a

[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:31.720]
Beener turdburger that you had in here that little a professional puddle of trouble rub it in and now you hear this morning

[01:54:32.420 --> 01:54:36.240]
Ferrell is still making Carlos this guy quit talking about Carlos for well

[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:40.020]
I mean you can do whatever you want, but that's just my strong suggestion it would be a good idea

[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:43.800]
Maybe he could hire him back to produce that you know, I keep talking about dumping the beast

[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:48.880]
I think they fit in like a glove up your ass. I think they fit in perfect. I

[01:54:48.880 --> 01:54:50.180]
Think it'd be a great match

[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:56.760]
Well, we just want every way to know and I'm serious. I'll put up a thousand dollars to build that statue for Scott Ferrell

[01:54:57.740 --> 01:55:00.420]
Just what we were seriously we were for Lauren

[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:04.760]
Yeah, we had basically given up any hope of ever getting back tended to

[01:55:05.580 --> 01:55:09.820]
Of ever being able to come in here in the morning or even just start to show in the morning whether I'm here or not

[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:14.420]
By long distance and have everybody in a good mood. We had given up all of these things

[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.560]
And then along came Ferrell

[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:23.000]
Right and of course clearance and Greg just I mean

[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:28.020]
They they were using them like a human wishbone each one had a hold of one leg

[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:33.820]
You know what I'm saying? That's how that's how much they were obsessed with Ferrell now of course Greg loves him

[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.640]
But when he was in here earlier Greg read says to me

[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:41.660]
He said and I you know, I don't want to tell tales, but he said he worries me a little sometime, you know good

[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:45.120]
I said yeah, he worries me a little bit too, but he's great

[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.020]
That is good the fact that he worries him because it means he's like right on the edge or maybe a little bit over the edge or maybe like

[01:55:51.020 --> 01:55:53.460]
Way over it, but whatever you know

[01:55:55.920 --> 01:56:00.180]
Yeah, I mean if you're gonna have great success you're also gonna have to have a few schmilkies over a two Greg

[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:02.480]
I'm sure that one of

[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:05.200]
I'm trying to think how many what what you used do we have in like

[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.220]
Executive positions in this place. I was gonna say somebody's name that he fell

[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.640]
Maddie Bell is Jewish. That's right. What am I thinking?

[01:56:13.300 --> 01:56:15.680]
You can tell about Maddie Bell by the smell

[01:56:16.160 --> 01:56:21.000]
But he swell and he ought to go to hell. No, but seriously. He's he's Jewish

[01:56:21.640 --> 01:56:29.860]
Yeah, he's the the second way to explain what spielki's mean Greg. He can he can give him a few 27 past noon at five sixty WQ

[01:56:29.860 --> 01:56:30.860]
I'm speaking of spielkeys

[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:33.000]
She's no Ray

[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:37.800]
I was coming. I don't know who she is either. She's a young lady who works here. She's heavy set

[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.400]
I should know who she is, but she works over like on the other side. Maybe she works at power

[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:48.620]
And she was telling me she lost 88 pounds on the atkins. You know what I'm talking about no very nice

[01:56:48.980 --> 01:56:52.720]
But anyway, a lot of people are on the atkins and you want to know why because for many many people it works

[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:53.880]
It's a great way to lose weight

[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:55.500]
It's delicious. You need all kinds of stuff

[01:56:55.500 --> 01:56:58.440]
The only problem with it is can be very one-dimensional and really boring

[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:00.000]
Which he was complaining about that too

[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:05.360]

[01:58:28.700 --> 01:58:29.460]
You

[01:58:29.460 --> 01:58:39.540]
There was in no farmer who lived on a ride he said in the middle just shaking his fist at some boys who were down by the prick

[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:46.420]
They're feeding the water their hands on their marbles and play things and at half past four

[01:58:46.420 --> 01:58:53.140]
There came a young lady she looked like a pretty young creature. She sat on the grass

[01:58:53.140 --> 01:58:59.600]
She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumbles and laces and white bluppied

[01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:06.800]
She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children so they would not spin

[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:13.620]
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling refuse and litter from yesterday's hut

[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:20.440]
While the girl in the middle was rubbing her eyes at the fellow down by the dock

[01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:27.280]
He looked like a man with a size of a home in the country with a big fence out front

[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:34.120]
If he asked her fun lightly she'd show him her little pet dog who was subject to fits

[01:59:34.120 --> 01:59:40.820]
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her small tender hands with a movement so quick

[01:59:40.820 --> 01:59:48.140]
And then she'd been over and suck out his candy so tasty made of butter Scotch

[01:59:48.140 --> 01:59:54.420]
And then he spread wood cream all over her cookies that she had left out on her shelf

[01:59:54.420 --> 01:59:58.420]
If you think this is dirty you can go f*** yourself

[01:59:59.280 --> 02:00:04.800]
26 to 1 at 5,60 WQAM the home of the a mad dog who's on a way to a New Orleans

[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:08.020]
Now he loves a place like New Orleans that's his kind of joint

[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:14.040]
I personally do not like New Orleans in any way shape or manner it is filthy and scrotesque

[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:18.720]
And I still don't understand although you know I realize what the come back with me

[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:23.920]
You can go and get drunk anywhere right I mean this business about keywashed and New Orleans

[02:00:23.920 --> 02:00:26.720]
You can get drunk anywhere you have a great time and get plastered

[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.180]
Yeah but how many other drunk people are there

[02:00:30.340 --> 02:00:33.660]
Are where wherever you happen to be getting drunk at you mean up the block

[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:34.840]
5th third man

[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:39.800]
No seriously and then people would say well you know why do you go to Amsterdam

[02:00:39.800 --> 02:00:43.360]
People gonna have sex anywhere they want you know people are going to Amsterdam for sex and drugs

[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:45.020]
Stuff like that I mean I was shame on them

[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:47.900]
But I guess maybe that's a good point

[02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:53.980]
But perhaps it isn't as readily available or it's not as erotic or exotic or all of these things you know the quantity

[02:00:54.500 --> 02:00:56.640]
quantity of what drugs or sex both yes

[02:00:57.800 --> 02:01:02.500]
Just a whole different ambiance just a different aroma and atmospheric booted you know

[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:08.400]
Just like here in America everything has got to be like oh it's like unclean and uptight and uh you know

[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.880]
It's it this is no wonder people are so stressed out here see that's another thing about living in the Toronto part of the time

[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:16.000]
That's not fat boys it

[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:19.900]
See I all I did was see the shirt I didn't even see any other part

[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:24.940]
I knew it was that fat turd what do you want well by the way I got my panther tickets my season tickets yesterday

[02:01:24.940 --> 02:01:28.160]
No parking passes see I'm glad he came in there for a moment

[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:31.160]
No seriously what kind of crap is that they're trying to get season ticket holders

[02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:33.560]
I get my package yesterday my big package

[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.760]
And no parking passes

[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:42.180]
Now what was I just saying before that that was a hell of a lot more important until I started pressing in America

[02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:48.660]
And it is because people are uptight right life is so much less stressful in Canada a much less so

[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:56.500]
Even with the SARS and the blackout in spite of all of these things it's still more laid back and less stressful

[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.860]
It's less stressful in places that have less of whatever we have indoor plumbing

[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:07.020]
And we have plenty of indoor plumbing in Canada

[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:07.580]
Yeah

[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:08.960]
Yeah lots

[02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:10.760]
Well not the part of Canada I was visiting

[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:12.560]
Well I'm sure I'm going to bring the bodies

[02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:15.040]
They wouldn't let you in any part where they have like indoor plumbing

[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:16.540]
Oh they let everybody in

[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:17.840]

Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:12.080]
They were one of the most creative bands of the 80s

[02:09:12.080 --> 02:09:19.960]
But all that goes out the window when you get a song in a John Hughes movie they were orchestral maneuvers in the dark

[02:09:27.100 --> 02:09:34.720]
Oh wow did you like it to meet mothering mouth? I think so once maybe oh my god

[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:37.500]
She was so totally my idol

[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.340]
There's just like not one girl that I knew who do not want to be Molly Ringwald the marketing people at inside the behind

[02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:50.460]
Decided to let an ordinary woman who came of age in the 80s conducting interview with Andy Mcluskey of O MD

[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:57.800]
Well, you see we were really influenced by some of the experimental keyboard bands like craft work. Oh, did you not want to sleep with Andrew McCarthy?

[02:09:58.260 --> 02:10:02.280]
Well, I mean if you were a girl. I mean maybe if you were gay were you gay look?

[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:08.520]
We talk about the importance of OMD to that hope period could we you were like so lucky to get a song in pretty in pink

[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:11.840]
I bet you thought like wow I get to meet John Crier

[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:18.140]
You know he's overlooked, you know, but he was like hot too John Crier was just like as much as the 80s

[02:10:18.140 --> 02:10:25.400]
It's like Andrew McCarthy was it's true. What about the music? Oh, I know every time I hear the beginning of that song

[02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:30.120]
I am like so back there thinking about the movie who did that song anyway?

[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:31.660]
What you little? Oh

[02:10:31.660 --> 02:10:38.840]
You mean you're free or Kestrel maneuvers in the dark. It's the oldest equation in the music business

[02:11:04.300 --> 02:11:05.420]

[02:11:21.220 --> 02:11:21.740]

[02:11:21.740 --> 02:11:26.140]
Oh, but he started that I'm so glad I usually only play that first line. Oh, man

[02:11:26.920 --> 02:11:29.300]
Over the top. I mean just out of control

[02:11:30.060 --> 02:11:36.420]
Sounds like a an old Cuban abuela. Mm-hmm probably wasn't old Cuban abuela when he came right down to it

[02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:40.920]
This is disgusting a politically prominent Brooklyn rabbi

[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:46.900]
Oi use the seven hundred thousand dollar federal grant for disabled preschoolers as his personal ATM

[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:50.980]
Prosecutor charge yesterday by the way, how about that Pat Turnillo? We had that on our website

[02:11:51.760 --> 02:11:56.520]
Using the money from the teachers union you see all the stuff that he was using all the trips in the

[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:01.300]
What a piece of crap pat and it comes under he's got the tubes in his nose because he needs oxygen

[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:06.360]
You know maybe there is a god. No, God anyway getting back to this reby

[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:13.980]
The charges were leveled against rabbi Milton Balkany the 57 year old director of the bias Yakov girl school in Burrow Park

[02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:16.620]
bias jack-off girl school

[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:20.420]
Prosecutor said the Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded balcony the grant in December

[02:12:20.420 --> 02:12:23.340]
1999 to build a preschool for disabled children

[02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:28.900]
But Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Jim Comey said ball can't use the money to line his own pocket and reward others

[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:34.940]
I mean, this is what makes it extra disgusting a federal grant for disabled preschoolers

[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:39.960]
The rabbi allegedly gave three hundred thousand dollars to a son of law in Israel

[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:45.960]
Cox a hoist and five thousand dollars to another son of laws import business in Ridgewood in the Queens

[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:54.760]
Some eighty three thousand dollars allegedly went to other rabbis and Jewish schools and organizations in Brooklyn another 78 grand was on personal bank account

[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:01.620]
Prosecutors also said balcony used grant money to pay his life insurance premiums credit card bills for dinners and clothing

[02:13:01.620 --> 02:13:05.120]
I'm sure was a kosher of course and personal federal income tax

[02:13:05.700 --> 02:13:09.040]
The French lawyer Benjamin Braffman said his client is innocent

[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:16.760]
We are confident that we'll be able to demonstrate that now one penny was misappropriated that every dollar was indeed used for the benefit of learning disabled children Braffman said

[02:13:17.340 --> 02:13:21.600]
balcony is known and controversial for his political fundraising prowess

[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:27.840]
He was dubbed the Brooklyn Bungler in the 1980s for his ability to present candidates with individual donations in bunches

[02:13:27.840 --> 02:13:32.560]
He is supported among others former Mayor Rudy Giuliani and governor George Pataki

[02:13:33.700 --> 02:13:37.100]
So he's a Republican by Cracky generally speaking

[02:13:39.060 --> 02:13:47.440]
New York Daily News probe in 2000 detailed his role in corralling daycare vouchers for families in four Brooklyn Orthodox Jewish communities prompting a federal probe

[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.940]
Questions were also raised several years ago after former Senator Robert Dull helps secure a federal grant for balcony

[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:57.840]
Dull was running for president of the time and blocking. He was a big fundraiser like I said George Lane Oberolas

[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:03.660]
Cox a hoist you have no shoes far bison piece of crap you 50 years no questions asked

[02:14:04.600 --> 02:14:11.000]
And you know that guy that was in there with father Gagan. Yeah, put him in the cell. Maybe he can make a visit. What kind of crap is that?

[02:14:11.780 --> 02:14:15.940]
Yeah, I see him. Okay. Why the skinhead? He was molested when he was a kid right?

[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:18.420]
Just wondering if you didn't talk about it

[02:14:18.420 --> 02:14:23.020]
What is there to say about it? He was a skinhead who was molested by a kid and get revenge and uh, right?

[02:14:23.060 --> 02:14:28.960]
Oh happy day and he was just in there by coincidence. No, of course not. No, of course not. Oh well. Yeah

[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:32.020]
Well, we just happened to be in there and there was only one guard on duty at the time

[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:35.480]
And he was out to lunch. Can we get the address so we can send him a fruit basket? He was busy

[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:38.860]
How many years should they give this rabbit?

[02:14:39.920 --> 02:14:40.560]
At least minimum

[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:44.220]
Now speaking of a scumbag Jews of Astor from New York

[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.140]
Why don't you listen to the Mohawar David and show?

[02:14:48.380 --> 02:14:55.360]
314 votes. He's a popus old ass 112. He's effing boring 97. I don't give a shmit about sports 52

[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:00.460]
I do listen. He's great 34 or 10.8 percent. He's great say 10.8 and

[02:15:01.340 --> 02:15:07.080]
He's his muskrat is on too tight 19 all the way at least this morning kind of let his hair down a little bit

[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:07.780]
I was good

[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:10.220]
Maybe he's taking my advice

[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.460]
If he would just buy this hair down a bit now we had 400 boxes of 1230

[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:18.820]
At Brandys and with that big one and two comedy vets hour coming up

[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:23.600]
Which we'll continue through this week now next week after Labor Day George will be here on Monday because it's Labor Day

[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:28.160]
And I'll be damned if I'm working on Labor Day and I'm playing all kinds of long. Good. Have a good time

[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:31.160]
I don't give a fly track whatever. What's per hour great?

[02:15:31.980 --> 02:15:34.880]
But then starting next Tuesday September the tooth

[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:36.480]
Right

[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:40.540]
Well, it's got to be the first is Monday it's Labor Day not that huh?

[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:46.260]
So next Tuesday September 2 we will attempt although that may be a bad mistake

[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:56.000]
No seriously because there are a lot of people who go away for their last gas summer vacation this week and last week these two weeks are like hopeless

[02:15:56.760 --> 02:15:59.840]
Feel it out. You don't think that's where we don't have to make no commitment

[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:04.900]
And even if we do we lie a lot we change our minds. We always keep our options open. That's all

[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:08.160]
I'm not gonna sit here dying anymore. I mean like today has been good

[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.260]
We had a lot of calls only a couple of idiots which is good. We like a couple

[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:16.860]
So anyway getting back to Brandys I want to pump this hard because you got another hour and seven minutes and

[02:16:16.860 --> 02:16:18.780]
Miguel is there and like I said, I want to pump it hard

[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:25.020]
From now until two Brandys shoes is the location 1290 North Federal Highway in Pombo Beach between Atlantic and Covins

[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:29.620]
We thank our friends at Brandys for being a part of this whole thing twice Bradford is there. He'll give you like an autograph

[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:30.160]
I bet

[02:16:30.800 --> 02:16:35.280]
In fact, he'd be he'd be amazed if anybody took his autograph. He may pay you to take it

[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.100]
You'd be amazed with what how many people care about Troy?

[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:41.240]
Mm-hmm. He's a great guy. Yes, he is

[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:43.020]
So you'll never hear me knock Troy's draught for it

[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:44.580]
I mean every now and then he screws up on the count

[02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:48.260]
But that's because he's in our sales department, but he's as personally he's a wonderful guy

[02:16:48.260 --> 02:16:52.040]
We like Troy a lot. He does care just sometimes, you know, no, and he really is conscientious

[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.300]
I mean, he's a little bit slow

[02:16:54.060 --> 02:16:58.300]
But he's a good guy. So anyway, he's there with Miguel who's not slow, but just paranoid because he's Cuban

[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:02.920]
And there's free food from Atlantic City subs where I remember makes the difference of those great sub sandwiches

[02:17:02.920 --> 02:17:08.200]
Which you notice I have eaten nothing but the bacon please how he's going to begin tomorrow on Friday, please please

[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:11.240]
No, I didn't know what that was there was a

[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:17.140]
Styrofoam container in there because usually it's just those little aluminum foil things and there's a few strips of bacon

[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:19.440]
I open up that thing

[02:17:20.480 --> 02:17:24.880]
Right, and there's like 700 pieces of bacon in there so I brought it in here figuring out a few

[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:27.560]
I had to hold them for every every strip

[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:29.140]
All the white one

[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:32.880]
Well, but they're there had to be 50

[02:17:33.440 --> 02:17:34.820]
Maybe not blowing, huh?

[02:17:35.660 --> 02:17:40.120]
Maybe 30 man. Yeah, at least there was a lot. I mean, I ate like a russia of bacon and

[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:44.560]
Then all of a sudden I'm talking to my good close friend from a fast train here this morning and

[02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:49.420]
No, I am glad that you know our conversation at that point was winding up

[02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:55.140]
We talked about all kinds of stuff we ripped Moe and asked I was wondering what the beads of salt performing on your lips

[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.080]
I made a b-line

[02:17:56.920 --> 02:18:02.380]
Magic room and thank goodness nobody was in there. No, no, it was it wasn't aromatic. It was just like quick and powerful

[02:18:03.220 --> 02:18:06.340]
It was like a jodaphrac. It was like a purge. I mean, woo

[02:18:07.080 --> 02:18:08.320]
Talk about heavy duty

[02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:12.660]
Bacon induced when there's a lot of grease a lot of fat and grease in there and

[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:15.220]
Of course the grease makes like for sliders

[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:19.920]
So in any way it was great. There's the a total now nine wow. That's pretty good

[02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:23.360]
I will not only make the thousand like I said I want to go for two thousand a day of brandy guy

[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:29.760]
This is good. I'm telling you this year. We are gonna raise a hundred grand net net for abandoned pet rescue

[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:34.680]
They do wonderful work. I know there's a lot of other good animal places, you know, and we can't do them all

[02:18:35.500 --> 02:18:40.680]
But I also don't believe of doing like you know a whole bunch of different places need to give one place five grand and three

[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:43.320]
You know you divide it up. It really doesn't have any impact and

[02:18:44.420 --> 02:18:49.740]
I hate to say this because my mother's probably listening, but and by the way, I'll see you tomorrow or Friday, honey

[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:54.000]
I'm not going there on Saturday because I'm going you know, I'm not going there

[02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:00.140]
So I'll go there tomorrow or Friday and if you don't like it. I'll see you're one of these days. You know, I want to get around it

[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:00.740]
Well, I'm good and ready

[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.940]
Now what was I just saying about my what inspired me about?

[02:19:05.460 --> 02:19:10.460]
No, what that was I just saying it was a rescue you were talking about a bad bad about the dogs

[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:14.220]
Because remember I did the show that day, which I'm embarrassed for doing that show now

[02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:18.920]
That was a show mocha to rip before that was a bad show. I mean it was it was okay, but that was terrible

[02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:22.780]
The dog show and people coming that was that was a terrible show the dog breach

[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:24.520]
Yeah, that was awful started out

[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:31.820]

[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:35.480]

[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:36.960]
but

[02:19:38.200 --> 02:19:39.360]

I have

[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:35.740]
I

I

[02:23:37.900 --> 02:23:38.000]
am

[02:23:45.260 --> 02:23:50.560]
But I still

[02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.360]
have

[02:23:53.260 --> 02:23:55.240]

can I find any Pokemon

[02:24:07.080 --> 02:24:11.440]
I've been in every store

[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:14.040]
And I can't find

[02:24:14.040 --> 02:24:20.300]
But the song is so freaking hard

[02:24:21.080 --> 02:24:23.940]
To find Charizard

But they were not at every horse

[02:24:34.620 --> 02:24:38.260]

[02:24:39.940 --> 02:24:42.780]
I've got shopped in Japan

[02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:47.840]
Cause I still have

[02:24:47.840 --> 02:24:51.100]
And found any Pokemon

[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:52.820]
No

[02:24:53.840 --> 02:24:55.580]
No I still

[02:25:00.660 --> 02:25:03.160]
Last night I dreamt of

[02:25:03.160 --> 02:25:04.400]
Can say go

[02:25:05.740 --> 02:25:10.280]
Just like he never let my side at all

[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:11.860]
I'd wait with hope

[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:13.720]
They can say go

[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.960]
He showed me

[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:19.140]
Just how to handle the ball

[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:21.380]
I should always stay how to vote

[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:23.600]
The back of breath was kind of vote

[02:25:23.600 --> 02:25:25.480]
I took off my clothes

[02:25:25.480 --> 02:25:28.140]
He kept on his plea does

[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:30.640]
I miss coming round their base

[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:32.840]
And sliding into his face

[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.700]
Get the shower with Jose

[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:37.060]
Must finish the live-on

[02:25:45.480 --> 02:25:47.520]
Now in a supermarket near you

[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:48.780]
Caned Millie Vinyl

[02:25:48.780 --> 02:25:51.060]
Yes Millie Vinyl is in concert

[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:53.040]
Lipsinking to pre-recorded music tracks

[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:54.260]
It's all canned

[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.240]

[02:25:56.240 --> 02:25:58.980]
You'll pay premium prices for canned Millie Vinyl

[02:25:59.720 --> 02:26:00.020]
Redelabel

[02:26:00.020 --> 02:26:02.020]
Caned Millie Vinyl is all artificial

[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:04.080]
It's all hair and no talent

[02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:06.520]
Hopefully it'll have a short shelf life

[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:08.920]
Caned Millie Vinyl at your local supermarket

[02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:10.300]
In the fruit section

[02:26:10.300 --> 02:26:12.540]
Just look for the wrapper with the dreadlocks

[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:17.740]
Now we're up to our long distance dedication

[02:26:18.300 --> 02:26:20.420]
And this one is about kids and pets

[02:26:20.420 --> 02:26:22.960]
And a situation that we can all understand

[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:25.100]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither

[02:26:25.100 --> 02:26:27.560]
It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio

[02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.800]
And here's what he writes

[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.140]
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request

[02:26:33.140 --> 02:26:36.620]
But I'm quite sincere and it'll meet a lot if you play it

[02:26:36.620 --> 02:26:39.060]
Recently there was a death in our family

[02:26:39.060 --> 02:26:41.580]
He was a little dog named Snuckles

[02:26:41.580 --> 02:26:44.680]
But he was most certainly a part of us gonna start again

[02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:46.860]
From coming out of the record

[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:48.820]
Play the record, okay?

[02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:50.260]
Please

[02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:59.420]
See when you come out of those up-tempered damn numbers, man, is impossible to make those transitions

[02:26:59.420 --> 02:27:01.780]
And then you gotta go into somebody dying

[02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:03.840]
You know, they do this to me all the time

[02:27:03.840 --> 02:27:05.240]
I don't know what the hell they do it for

[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:07.560]
But damn it, if we can't come out of a cell record

[02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:09.800]
I don't understand it, is down on the phone

[02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:18.640]
Okay, I want a damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record every time I do a f***ing deaf dedication

[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:24.600]
Now make it and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week

[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:27.200]
It's a god last f***ing damn time

[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:31.400]
I want somebody who uses f***ing brain to not come out of a f***ing damn record

[02:27:32.680 --> 02:27:36.080]
That's up-tempo and I gotta talk about a f***ing jaw dying

[02:27:37.180 --> 02:27:39.360]
Boy, this f***ing ponderous, man

[02:27:40.380 --> 02:27:42.420]
Ponderous f***ing ponderous

[02:27:42.420 --> 02:27:46.080]
I've broken through her bedroom window

[02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:52.080]
And by the end, she did my wick

[02:27:55.480 --> 02:27:59.080]
Now what I did, I knew, was a dribbler

[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.540]
But that ain't no to do if you play for the fish

[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:11.080]
Against my girlfriend forgot to tell me

[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.720]
That another bitch was someone else's wife

[02:28:17.720 --> 02:28:24.000]
A friend, a servant of them was being innocent

[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.320]
And I found out when it changed me with a knife

[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:33.280]
Why didn't that bitch tell me?

[02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:38.780]
It was too dark to see

[02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:45.820]
She'd be in bed with her own bed

[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:52.840]
And that's killed the bitch, not the bitch, you know, bail me down

[02:28:54.500 --> 02:28:55.180]
Absolutely

[02:28:55.180 --> 02:28:58.600]
109 at 560 WDQM, happy Wednesday 2

[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:02.040]
We got 351 votes on our second poll, not too shabby, I would say

[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:06.100]
Why don't you listen to the Mohawar David to show that's our poll question

[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:08.860]
They were trying to find out how come most everybody hates him like poison

[02:29:09.700 --> 02:29:11.780]
He's a pompous old ass, 126

[02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:13.700]
He's effing boring 113

[02:29:14.120 --> 02:29:16.360]
I don't give a shmit about sports 57

[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:19.600]
I do listen to his grade 359.9

[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:23.920]
And his muskrats on 2-Tight 20

[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:27.800]
Speaking of people with muskrats, don't forget to check out the beast on our website

[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:33.200]
And speaking of the beast, he will say this, I don't see him much eaten, I don't see him eating this stuff from how he's

[02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:35.960]
Well, we will, you know how fat people are, you're sneaky, you sneak it in

[02:29:35.960 --> 02:29:36.220]
Yeah

[02:29:37.220 --> 02:29:39.600]
Like Clarence said, he likes to sneak it in when the beast ain't looking

[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:44.380]
Anyway, the beast is back on balance for like the reason being because he realized that it's gonna save his life

[02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:48.020]
He went off the wagon there for a little while, his parents were trying to kill him

[02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:50.880]
And he said, I screw you guys, I'm gonna go back on this black sack

[02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:53.600]
And that's what it's all about, the little black sack

[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:55.240]
Remember the little black brown coupe?

[02:29:55.960 --> 02:29:56.300]
No

[02:29:58.140 --> 02:30:00.580]

I might use it as a baseball bat, but my true rules out, both of us

[02:31:46.860 --> 02:31:47.780]

No constriction, feel no good

See you around your neighborhood

[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:27.200]
Well, I got no class

[02:32:28.860 --> 02:32:30.960]
And I got no principles

[02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:34.540]
And I got no intelligence

[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:39.220]
Discrack down out of my mind

[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:44.540]
I choose out, both of us

[02:32:46.440 --> 02:32:54.500]
I choose out, in and where I'm

[02:32:54.500 --> 02:32:58.660]
I'm at your boat, call, release

[02:33:04.540 --> 02:33:05.020]
Hahaha

[02:33:08.120 --> 02:33:12.320]
The Xbox though

[02:33:20.060 --> 02:33:22.380]
A

[02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:38.720]
I am a stealier, a victim, I have a fact.

[02:33:39.360 --> 02:33:42.220]
Popsin' won't get stole, I breath. Jesus, fix that back.

[02:33:42.720 --> 02:33:45.680]
Jesus, face it, super, if we never shut up, choke.

[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:49.120]
Popsin' won't get stole, no more. We should choke, choke.

[02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:52.920]
The pope's power to dump. God gave him the grass.

[02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:56.440]
The pope's power to dump. He likes his bugamad.

[02:33:56.900 --> 02:34:00.140]
The pope's power to dump. He's a gloomy head.

[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:03.880]
The pope's power to dump. The pope's power to dump.

[02:34:04.940 --> 02:34:12.140]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

[02:34:12.220 --> 02:34:14.220]
We're checking to win a deal.

[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:16.080]
We should fake safe, fella, watch that.

[02:34:16.480 --> 02:34:18.020]
Chills for cats and take up hell.

[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:19.320]
Our knives just got it, Johnson.

[02:34:20.020 --> 02:34:21.640]
Token, children, that ain't choked.

[02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:22.940]
Four ain't proven, hope.

[02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:26.500]
First and shot can be a choke of marijuana, smoke.

[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:28.540]
The pope's power to dump.

[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:30.240]
God gave him the grass.

[02:34:30.760 --> 02:34:33.760]
The pope's power to dump. He likes his bugamad.

[02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:37.500]
The pope's power to dump. He's a gloomy head.

[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:41.340]
The pope's power to dump. The pope's power to dump.

[02:34:42.180 --> 02:34:46.900]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:51.400]
The pope is getting higher.

[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:56.280]
I'm higher. I'm higher.

[02:34:56.740 --> 02:34:57.400]
I'm higher. I'm higher.

[02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.900]
I'm higher. I'm higher.

[02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:11.280]
The pope's power to dump. He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:14.080]
He likes his bugamad. He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:14.080 --> 02:35:14.840]
He's a gloomy head.

[02:35:15.200 --> 02:35:20.560]
The pope's power to dump. The pope's power to dump.

[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:27.580]
The pope's power to dump. He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:27.580 --> 02:35:34.280]
He likes his bugamad. He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:35.080]
Take that.

[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:36.760]
Take that.

[02:35:36.880 --> 02:35:36.900]
He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:36.900 --> 02:35:47.120]
He likes his bugamad.

[02:35:47.120 --> 02:35:47.960]
Alcatel.

[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:52.000]
Alcatel.

[02:35:53.460 --> 02:35:59.420]
Slippin' them on fire. Alcatel.

[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:04.720]
So it on the TV.

[02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:08.600]
The grand and more exact.

[02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:14.320]
Those laundry heads must all be smoking crack.

[02:36:17.420 --> 02:36:19.740]
I got a funny feeling.

[02:36:21.040 --> 02:36:23.340]
They won't be too inject.

[02:36:23.340 --> 02:36:27.340]
No.

[02:36:57.240 --> 02:36:58.720]
Alcatel.

[02:36:58.720 --> 02:36:59.960]
Hey, wait.

[02:37:03.160 --> 02:37:04.640]
Alcatel.

[02:37:07.340 --> 02:37:08.080]
Alcatel.

[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:13.340]
Ready, aim, fire.

[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:15.540]
Alcatel.

[02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:19.900]
Blow my palm.

[02:37:20.060 --> 02:37:21.380]
Blow my palm.

[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:23.720]
Blow my palm.

[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:24.220]
Blow my palm.

[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.360]
Blow my palm.

[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:28.860]
Alcatel.

[02:37:28.860 --> 02:37:30.320]
Today.

[02:37:33.540 --> 02:37:34.620]
Alcatel.

[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:38.400]
Alcatel.

[02:37:40.860 --> 02:37:42.380]
Welcome to Temptation Island.

[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:44.460]
And there they are.

[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:46.860]
Direct from the motor city.

[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:48.080]
Motown.

[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:52.120]
The sweet sounds of the temptation.

[02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:58.240]
Come sit down, relax at the Temptation Tiki bar.

[02:37:58.620 --> 02:38:00.280]
Sit down on the leather capsule.

[02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:05.160]
Or head on over to the eight-two-proud of vague thunders.

[02:38:05.300 --> 02:38:06.940]
With a lady, vague freely.

[02:38:07.380 --> 02:38:10.620]
And if you happen to get separated and you know because it's a big place.

[02:38:10.940 --> 02:38:14.120]
And you lose your baby on Temptation Island, you can go over to the...

[02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:17.060]
Since I lost my baby, lost and found.

[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.360]
And it's not, don't worry.

[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.060]
Because there are plenty of lovely ladies all around.

[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.520]
Oh and guys, when you're done shaking, they can on the beach rolling around in the sand with your lady.

[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:31.920]
And you head on over to the guys shower.

[02:38:32.700 --> 02:38:34.240]
Just don't look back.

[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:38.140]
That's right, you roam with the fool.

[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:39.500]
Temptation Island.

[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:42.360]
Be the mapper and the scuba flatly accepted.

[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:51.920]
Who's that group of Muslims?

[02:38:53.740 --> 02:38:55.280]
Helping terrorists.

[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:02.500]
It's a bunch of backward-thinking fundamentalists in the Taliban.

[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.120]
Who are those fanatics?

[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:10.420]
The adults feel with hate.

[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:17.300]
If you're caught stealing, it's your handle and you hate the Taliban.

[02:39:19.300 --> 02:39:21.520]
The Taliban can.

[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:29.480]
The Taliban can cause the rule of Afghanistan but there are up to no good.

[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:37.540]
A Taliban man, he doesn't give a damn about his country's starving masses.

[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:45.300]
Show us where the Kiberpasses, so we can go and kick their asses.

[02:39:45.480 --> 02:39:45.760]
Welcome.

[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:51.600]
Who keeps on the women, covered at the toll?

[02:39:53.940 --> 02:39:58.440]
It could be Osama under there, you'd never know the Taliban.

[02:40:01.060 --> 02:40:02.940]
The Taliban can.

[02:40:04.660 --> 02:40:10.500]
The Taliban can cause the rule of Afghanistan but there are up to no good.

[02:40:20.660 --> 02:40:23.220]
I didn't know you liked to do it in the rapids mode.

[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:24.380]
That's a man like Dignando.

[02:40:24.820 --> 02:40:25.500]
And I like men.

[02:40:27.380 --> 02:40:29.040]
Don't hit me with that horn.

[02:40:29.580 --> 02:40:30.060]
What?

[02:40:31.740 --> 02:40:34.240]
Did you think this thing was a good look?

[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:36.580]
No, I just watched this horrible video.

[02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:40.320]
Let me get a good look at you.

[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:43.000]
I'm going to get a fence over the sea.

[02:40:43.280 --> 02:40:46.220]
It's a fence over the sea.

[02:40:46.220 --> 02:40:50.440]
It's a fence over the sea.

[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:52.760]
Well, you can push me over, boy.

[02:40:53.360 --> 02:40:53.600]
Why?

[02:40:54.200 --> 02:40:54.200]

[02:40:56.940 --> 02:40:58.940]
What is going on?

[02:40:58.940 --> 02:40:59.400]
No way.

[02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:01.100]
We're heading for a waterfall.

[02:41:01.560 --> 02:41:03.180]
You can take a bullet but don't trick.

[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:04.020]
Why not?

[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.140]
We're on shore.

[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:17.400]
Yeah, the wood.

[02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:20.920]
And not a fighting message got me in too.

[02:41:21.860 --> 02:41:23.880]
Yeah, let's see who dropped in here, Jam.

[02:41:25.040 --> 02:41:26.320]
Hey, fellas, Dylan.

[02:41:26.780 --> 02:41:27.560]
I'm Georgie.

[02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:29.360]
That's my uncle, sister, Jam.

[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:29.800]
Howdy.

[02:41:29.940 --> 02:41:31.780]
And this here's my brother and my pal, Martha.

[02:41:31.940 --> 02:41:32.400]
I heard it.

[02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:34.000]
Mama named us after all.

[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:34.000]

[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:34.000]

[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:38.480]
All the bushes in honor of the greatest president in this country ever had.

[02:41:38.780 --> 02:41:40.420]
George Washington, Bush.

[02:41:40.740 --> 02:41:41.960]
Well, it's real nice meeting you and I.

[02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:43.600]
You ain't doing anywhere, sister.

[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:44.200]
Oh, see?

[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.100]
Here are my good Christian friends.

[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:48.320]
Drop your jersey and get on your knees.

[02:41:48.660 --> 02:41:49.800]
You two, girl, friends.

[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:51.180]
But wait, I'm a boy.

[02:41:51.380 --> 02:41:54.560]
You sure sound funny, but I like your lips.

[02:41:55.260 --> 02:41:55.920]
Don't you?

[02:41:56.260 --> 02:41:56.680]
No!

[02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:00.100]
No!

[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:02.320]
That pipe down.

[02:42:02.320 --> 02:42:03.720]
Now they you'll get used to it.

[02:42:04.020 --> 02:42:05.720]
George, George.

[02:42:05.800 --> 02:42:07.520]
No, no, no, no.

[02:42:08.760 --> 02:42:11.000]
Yeah, you'll be feeling like a woman in no time.

[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:13.500]
I got a bad tip.

[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:14.500]
You get the hurt.

[02:42:14.720 --> 02:42:16.960]
I suppose you want me to steal now, huh?

[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:18.840]
Don't cheat, how you gonna?

[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:21.320]
You're not gonna put that on me.

[02:42:26.980 --> 02:42:29.020]
I'm going to put that on me.

[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:32.300]
I'm going to put that on me.

[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:39.320]
This is the Neal Roger Show.

[02:42:40.940 --> 02:42:42.100]
This is your brain.

[02:42:44.060 --> 02:42:45.040]
Any questions?

[02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:49.420]
Forget Bored Shorts and Speedos if you want to get noticed on the beach.

[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:51.460]
Show up with a Sandy Johnson.

[02:42:51.860 --> 02:42:53.600]
Sandy Johnson swimwear from men.

[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:55.720]
As the latest looks to get you noticed.

[02:42:55.980 --> 02:43:00.480]
That's because every Sandy Johnson swimsuit comes with real beach sand sewn right in the

[02:43:00.480 --> 02:43:00.920]
crotch.

[02:43:01.100 --> 02:43:05.500]
So when you walk the leg of down the beach, everyone will know you got a Sandy Johnson.

[02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:08.020]
And for gals, there's Sandy Gapswimwear.

[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:11.680]
Where it is, Tuddy Thong, and you'll know why it's a Sandy Gapswim suit.

[02:43:11.940 --> 02:43:14.580]
Sandy Johnson and Sandy Gaps are available only at the gap.

[02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:16.460]
Let's go to the head!

[02:43:20.220 --> 02:43:22.740]
Water, 14 feet above the keel.

[02:43:23.340 --> 02:43:24.680]
It's like I pick a wrong week.

[02:43:24.880 --> 02:43:25.140]
Quick smoke.

[02:43:25.460 --> 02:43:26.020]
In a forky.

[02:43:26.360 --> 02:43:27.080]
In all three holes.

[02:43:27.740 --> 02:43:28.540]
And in boardroom six.

[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:30.460]
It's like I pick a wrong week.

[02:43:30.680 --> 02:43:30.960]
Quick drink.

[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:32.800]
When can we get on the way, dammit?

[02:43:32.880 --> 02:43:34.020]
Get that finger out of your ear.

[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:35.340]
You don't know where that finger's been.

[02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:38.060]
That's five compartments and it looks like a big tile and all.

[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:38.880]
She can say it flows.

[02:43:39.320 --> 02:43:41.360]
With a first four compartments, briefs, but not five.

[02:43:41.540 --> 02:43:42.600]
I'm the barber at Stairway.

[02:43:42.860 --> 02:43:43.340]
Not five.

[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:45.820]
The leg I pick a wrong week when I'm fed a beach.

[02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:47.980]
The water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads.

[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:48.800]
There's no stopping.

[02:43:49.080 --> 02:43:49.700]
Get heat!

[02:43:50.060 --> 02:43:51.520]
Get the fire in the barn.

[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:52.980]
From this moment no matter what you do.

[02:43:53.180 --> 02:43:53.760]
Me, John.

[02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:54.560]
Big three.

[02:43:54.840 --> 02:43:55.180]
Titanic.

[02:43:55.180 --> 02:43:56.220]
We'll find her.

[02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:57.480]
I just want to tell you both good luck.

[02:43:57.900 --> 02:43:58.560]
We're all counting on you.

[02:43:58.700 --> 02:44:01.080]
Well, I believe you may get your headlines from Mr. Smith.

[02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:02.840]
There's a sale at pennies.

[02:44:03.680 --> 02:44:05.820]
Jack, I want you to draw me like one of your French girls.

[02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:06.960]
Where's this?

[02:44:07.220 --> 02:44:08.840]
Where did you get that dress?

[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:11.700]
It's awful on those shoes and that coat.

[02:44:11.940 --> 02:44:12.320]
Jeez!

[02:44:38.720 --> 02:44:41.440]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:42.740 --> 02:44:43.160]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:43.320 --> 02:44:46.420]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:46.420 --> 02:44:48.140]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:50.020 --> 02:44:51.800]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:52.620]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.620]

[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:52.800]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:53.420]

[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:53.960]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:55.160]
I'm not sure.

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:55.160]

[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:59.120]
That's all the little too close.

[02:45:00.060 --> 02:45:04.020]
Here's not all this just a little too long.

[02:45:05.540 --> 02:45:07.740]
But while they've grown in,

[02:45:08.480 --> 02:45:10.260]
I've built them on each other.

[02:45:10.820 --> 02:45:13.440]
And here's got a really big travel travel.

[02:45:14.940 --> 02:45:18.260]
The public's cream if they let it out.

[02:45:19.780 --> 02:45:22.900]
Here's got a really big travel travel.

[02:45:22.900 --> 02:45:24.900]
Fishing for gold.

[02:45:29.120 --> 02:45:32.420]
They got a really big travel travel.

[02:45:32.900 --> 02:45:34.540]
Fishing for gold.

[02:45:38.780 --> 02:45:40.540]
Fishing for gold.

[02:45:40.580 --> 02:45:40.780]
They're all crazy.

[02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:43.640]
They're all crazy.

[02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:44.960]
They're all crazy.

[02:45:46.000 --> 02:45:46.160]
They're all crazy.

[02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:49.680]
They're all crazy.

[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:53.300]
When the child becomes a ship of war

[02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:10.860]
When the squad of back gets lonely

[02:46:12.460 --> 02:46:15.940]
He likes receivers that are wise

[02:46:15.940 --> 02:46:22.320]
Some people say that number rate is gay

[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:28.680]
They say Troy loves the big brown egg men

[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:33.140]
He goes down on his knees, Eggman

[02:46:34.700 --> 02:46:38.520]
His guy's he likes to please Eggman

[02:46:39.700 --> 02:46:43.680]
He loves to snap cowboys on their behind

[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:45.180]
Rack them

[02:47:14.900 --> 02:47:18.600]
I can't some balls to squeeze Eggman

[02:47:20.680 --> 02:47:27.380]
Don't let him cause he likes it from behind

[02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:46.080]
Look at the age head

[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:49.440]
My current memories be disobey

[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:51.540]
Put your pens on me

[02:47:51.540 --> 02:47:54.200]
So age head

[02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:58.360]
I can no longer be cause you see my prostate

[02:47:58.360 --> 02:47:59.920]
We're not meeting

[02:48:00.680 --> 02:48:03.160]
But still I think I'm 23

[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:10.320]
I know dated I found 82

[02:48:12.100 --> 02:48:16.500]
And I've got to keep my teeth healthy

[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:19.080]
And with you

[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:22.980]
Yeah I'm so aged

[02:48:22.980 --> 02:48:26.380]
But I can still keep rocking you

[02:48:32.580 --> 02:48:36.900]
Listen former bath president of the United States Al Gore

[02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:44.180]
I've recently poked my head out of the shadows of oblivion to take pot shots at the president

[02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:46.340]
I have reappeared

[02:48:46.900 --> 02:48:53.800]
Much like Puck's the Tony Phil, the groundhog creature that reappears each year to determine

[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:56.320]
whether or not we'll have an early spring

[02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:03.300]
I wish it to be known, but it was I who was responsible for saving the lives of those

[02:49:03.300 --> 02:49:06.240]
nine minors in Pennsylvania over the weekend

[02:49:07.300 --> 02:49:12.540]
I had asked the media to keep my name out of it as not to appear a spotlight hog

[02:49:13.220 --> 02:49:17.660]
However, I feel the American people have a right to know the truth

[02:49:18.380 --> 02:49:19.600]
Here's what happened

[02:49:20.300 --> 02:49:23.480]
Upon hearing of this unfortunate accident

[02:49:24.300 --> 02:49:25.800]
I will race to the thing

[02:49:26.800 --> 02:49:32.860]
I lowered myself into the mine using an old Ron Popeo pocket fisherman and some bailing wire

[02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:37.600]
Down, down, down into the depths of darkness I think

[02:49:37.600 --> 02:49:43.420]
Never thinking of my own safety, but rather of the safety of those men on the ground

[02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:46.860]
When I reached the miners they said to me

[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:50.300]
Hey, you're the guy that invented the internet, right?

[02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:52.120]
I said yes

[02:49:52.120 --> 02:49:57.240]
We all had a Mike's heart lullaby made, which I brought with me down into the hole

[02:49:57.240 --> 02:50:01.320]
And then we sat around and reenacted the fart thing from blazing saddles

[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:03.640]
I thought you should know the truth

[02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:12.780]
And now, much like the groundhog creature Puck's the Tony Phil, I'll flink back into the darkness of oblivion until I am needed again

[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:16.100]
This is Al Gore, sleeper hero

[02:50:23.120 --> 02:50:24.060]
Oh my God

[02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:29.060]
Don't lie, all the Harper

[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:34.420]
Don't go down every time I see

[02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:36.540]
Don't go down every time I see

[02:50:36.540 --> 02:50:40.560]
That retard it didn't win

[02:50:40.560 --> 02:50:44.380]
Don't go down all my TV

[02:50:45.120 --> 02:50:47.740]
He's President of the ****

[02:50:48.740 --> 02:50:53.380]
Rap out the kid muscle in, and in our kingdom in India

[02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:59.160]
I don't know why they would want this guy, but not easy

[02:50:59.740 --> 02:51:02.620]
First person in four years

[02:51:02.620 --> 02:51:04.680]
With President Thumb's ****

[02:51:08.440 --> 02:51:14.120]
Oh what I get to know both were small

[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:19.020]
And get to we all voted for

[02:51:20.120 --> 02:51:21.060]
Why?

[02:51:22.200 --> 02:51:24.480]
Here you want this

[02:51:25.120 --> 02:51:28.780]
Don't go down every time I see

[02:51:28.780 --> 02:51:30.720]
That retard it didn't win

[02:51:30.720 --> 02:51:35.520]
And this drunk in rich kid

[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:38.940]
Don't go down easy even

[02:51:38.940 --> 02:51:40.940]
Some are them me

[02:51:40.940 --> 02:51:43.860]
Rap out the kid's President Thumb's ****

[02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:46.880]
Yeah, don't care what it's up

[02:51:46.880 --> 02:51:49.380]
You got a man by her front

[02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:50.580]
Roll up the Christian

[02:51:50.580 --> 02:51:52.540]
Roll it on, what's best

[02:51:52.540 --> 02:51:55.500]
You and I will have no fear

[02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.660]
We've got a great leader

[02:51:58.940 --> 02:52:00.980]
With President Thumb's ****

[02:52:01.940 --> 02:52:03.400]
President Thumb's ****

[02:52:04.940 --> 02:52:06.200]
President Thumb's ****

[02:52:06.200 --> 02:52:09.180]
President Thumb's ****

[02:52:09.180 --> 02:52:11.080]
Thumb's ****

[02:52:11.080 --> 02:52:13.180]
My life and locals

[02:52:13.180 --> 02:52:15.400]
This is 4.2560

[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:17.900]
You ain't way, you ain't way

[02:52:36.420 --> 02:52:38.720]
When they 10 may call me Melanoma

[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:41.240]
I 10 until I'm almost in a coma

[02:52:41.240 --> 02:52:43.780]
How Y E my amy

[02:52:43.780 --> 02:52:46.020]
And they never ever use any sunscreen

[02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:48.380]
Sun with me, 10 with me

[02:52:48.380 --> 02:52:50.780]
Hope you don't mind I'm a little freckling

[02:52:50.780 --> 02:52:52.880]
If I hear the sun till we get Melanoma

[02:52:52.880 --> 02:52:55.120]
I think like a bun you can smell the aroma

[02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:57.480]
Our lights are all on, but there's nobody home

[02:52:57.480 --> 02:52:59.360]
Hey Melanoma

[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:01.800]
I spend the day at work planning

[02:53:01.800 --> 02:53:04.440]
That when I get off I go tanning

[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:07.300]
I get naked and fake fake kids

[02:53:07.300 --> 02:53:09.660]
How much longer is my skin gonna take it?

[02:53:09.760 --> 02:53:14.360]
My astrologist and numerologist have to help me find a dermatologist

[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:16.320]
If I'm in the sun till we get Melanoma

[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:18.640]
We bake like a bun you can smell the aroma

[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:20.960]
Our lights are all on, but there's nobody home

[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.800]
Hey Melanoma

[02:53:23.440 --> 02:53:25.740]
We lie in the sun till we get Melanoma

[02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:28.040]
We bake like a bun you can smell the aroma

[02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:30.440]
We've got lots on our skin bigger than a mesh redoma

[02:53:30.440 --> 02:53:32.180]
Hey Melanoma

[02:53:32.180 --> 02:53:33.320]
Hey Melanoma

[02:53:33.320 --> 02:53:35.080]
We don't care if we get Melanoma

[02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:37.420]
We've got the best tan from here to Arizona

[02:53:37.420 --> 02:53:39.960]
We're glad we don't have genital condoloma

[02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:41.600]
Hey Melanoma

[02:53:42.180 --> 02:53:42.640]
Hey

[02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:44.180]
Hey Melanoma

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.260]

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.260]

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.260]

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.260]

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.260]

[02:53:53.260 --> 02:53:53.280]
Hey
