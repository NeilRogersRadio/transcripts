[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.640]
I

[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.260]
You're gonna build me up into a fever picture my grilled cheese sandwich would bake it on the whole wheat toast

[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.760]
Anyway, where the hell is that oh first this facts arrogant for dry

[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.160]
And I didn't say that we were arrogant for dropping about my was reading Nelson Mandela's comments

[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.300]
I don't believe that for a second

[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.440]
I think Truman had big balls and we need to do that and save the hell a lot of American life it was war baby

[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.940]
That's right in addition to which does anybody remember Pearl Harbor?

[00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.920]
I don't say any comparison between what's happening in Iraq and how come he keeps saying Iranians again

[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.620]
I have to correct himself with somebody please show our president like get him a compass in a road map

[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.180]
And show him where I rack and I ran our on a map and explain him that Iranians don't live in Iraq or Iraq

[00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.860]
Anyway, it says I were given by my boy has to be the dumbest thing ever her

[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.240]
Well, there are a lot of things that are being said that I don't agree with for example the thing with the French

[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.720]
We got an article on our website today about the French which has got some with points for the fact of the matter is the French number

[00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.320]
One never met a terrorist they didn't like and number two of the French were the ones that sold the nuclear reactor to Sodom in the first place

[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:07.220]
We'll see Israelis had a blow up for us so they did not have nuclear weapons anybody remember that I sure do so you know

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.160]
We say about the French

[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.660]
FM that's what we say about the French haven't I always told you about that?

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.440]
That's the French exactly absolutely at any rate green peas boats sink and frogs scumbags

[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.860]
And by the way your food sucks, okay

[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.180]
Here's when it says sorry if you've heard this but saw in WB 39 this morning the Sun sent them next Wednesday will include a

[00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.140]
Smallville poster

[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.440]
Tom Malink isn't naked is we'd all hope but but keep in mind that from the neck up

[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.260]
He looks really good. You don't want to see anymore especially those big size 82 feet

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.860]
By the way didn't hear the whole show yesterday, but it sounds like my suggestion the monkeys hit a nerve take care K

[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.160]
Whoever to help K is well, thank you K

[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.500]
But what does that mean? Oh, that's because George doesn't like the monkeys and we're not doing that pool by the way

[00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.860]
I changed my mind and I said I yesterday when I do that pool about artists because like I said and how did I ever get sucked into that?

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.800]
I don't know how did I ever get sucked into that

[00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.920]
Because well, it's not easy coming up with an interesting port especially something people will talk

[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.220]
But don't answer the phone because we're gonna do screenless 9 to 10 every day

[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.160]
I'm talking about what the calls I take. I'm not gonna say the whole hour to scream was you'd have to be you'd have to be suicidal to do that

[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.280]
But I'm saying the calls I take that I was in genders more response spices up a little bit

[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.340]
What'd he give me like a bug I look now plus it makes your life a lot easier would you're all excited about the the comedy if it's 9 to 10 hours

[00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.780]
So here's another guy and even sit there and he's trying to

[00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.660]
Who's probably about it?

[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.200]
Bank account

[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.460]
I don't hear what he has to say and tell him

[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.080]
I'm going 50 dollars. Who the hell wants you what he has to say no but once here what he has to say and still he says it

[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.980]
I mean don't take it personal

[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.100]
It's like when I was in there taking a dump this morning

[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.680]
He's in there end of in the sink again floating around and that came in

[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.220]
God

[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.820]
Zach I thought was gonna mistake him for like a piece of leftover sandwiches something and eat him right there in a goddamn zero

[00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:57.780]
I could say something but and it was like all of that food out there too. I didn't have a couple of strips of bacon

[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.220]
So in other words, you're telling me now we have to wait for a ponytail to call you back

[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:07.180]
I'll keep trying all the way to the office to pick up a grilled cheese sandwich across the street of the stadium diner

[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.720]
sure

[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.640]
If you don't get a call back soon. I'm I'm just horny for a

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.880]
That was really good in fact it's really was really my friend which he's not but if y'all he was really my friend

[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.400]
When those guys get the food from how is it in the morning? How come there's not a grilled cheese on a whole wait for me in there

[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.580]
I'll pay him for it. Do you think they're paying for that food or not?

[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.440]
Is it a freebie? I'll be more than happy to pay for it

[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.060]
So I've heard no not that. Oh, wait

[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.220]
Here's a Keith Blaney who's stuff on oh another reason I've played that in Mickey thing here's this fact

[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.160]
Jonathan says I'm one of your younger listeners have been listening to your show for close to two years since I moved down here

[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.840]
I'm 25 and I love your show. That's what we want is a lot of 25 year old guys

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.840]
That's what I want don't change a thing and contrary to what the other facts who said the comedy bits are hilarious

[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.820]
I think the new Moe songs ginger and Moe gay union and watch your backseck are classics and you know what?

[00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.300]
Correct Jonathan says keep playing them also used to play in a rickie song that said something like tell me

[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.040]
I want him to come over which I just played was hoping you could play it sometime as a heaven or in a long time

[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.560]
Take care of all the best to you. There you go Jonathan and there was the how do you like that? Huh? Right on top of it, baby

[00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.740]
So all you naysayers all you poo-poors out there poo-po on this okay. That's what we say here

[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.680]
As we try somehow desperately to undo the damage that Greg read is done to our line up into this program

[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.600]
Try to put the pieces together like frickin Humpty Dumpty next time he comes in there and talks to you long after I'm gone when it's the

[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.460]
Coast is clear and things are safe tell them we really appreciate the nice job he's done here

[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.000]
Some we'd rather we'd rather follow the test pattern

[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.380]
Here's West Miami. Hello

[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.640]
Yes, sir. Hey, that's actually was right man. Your show's really gone crappy. Yeah

[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:47.260]

[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.660]
And that's it and thanks for listening

[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.080]
Thank you. Okay, five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on again

[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.960]
See, I mean this like I've said before what what do those calls mean that the guys got mental problems

[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.020]
He's listening. Not only is he listening. He's calling to share that with us

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.940]
Our show is gone crappy. It's gone in the crapper

[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:12.940]
Um, I'm just I'm crushed. Yeah, I haven't got a clue what we're gonna do now. Here's the tell five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty

[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.260]
Eighties and four eyes in line WQ I am

[00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.040]
Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.500]
The show's not gone crappy and I don't think you should try a format it your best shows are when you just come in and start

[00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.260]
About doing your stuff starts screwing around just you know, I mean you don't need no

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:35.200]
This format from nine to ten right come in that's right. That's right. That's right because the best stuff happens

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.120]
Spontaneous like oh, I was like when George was rolling around on the floor before

[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.380]
And another thing. Carlos push push sucks

[00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.020]
Okay, and then my last my last comment is

[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.520]
Um, are you gonna go to the the off-star game this week? No

[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.980]
No, no, let me say it again. No

[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.260]
I never do I in fact I know even on television. I won't be watching it

[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.220]
Really? I don't care about all star games of any sport or just the caca when I go to see a hockey game. I want to see a real game

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.980]
I'm neat too, but I think I still enjoy watching all the getting all the best players and one

[00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.020]
But all the best players aren't gonna be there. There be no myriot no mad sundine no

[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.360]
Sacco coivo. There's a lot of guys that aren't letting no Eddie Bell for

[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.660]
Yeah, you're right. Anyway go leave scow

[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.200]
I too over land a last night have a great day sir enjoy the game. I'm not going to know all star game

[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080]
Let me say it again. Why do these people add so super?

[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.660]
Oh, you're not a real hockey fan bull crap. I watched more hockey last night than most of you in your life

[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.740]
Just last night. So a good part of the penguin washing in game. So to leave skam beat in Atlanta 5-2

[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.680]
Panthers and Detroit are very boring too too. Ty what else did I watch there must have been another one?

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.040]
There's one other one. I gotta have like six I'm gonna have to have six sets like Rimmer now

[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.200]
So I can watch like a whole bunch of games at the same time

[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.280]
But I do I watch a lot of time joy. I love it if it's a good game

[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.860]
Penguin washing game was a coma inducer, but nevertheless

[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.800]
And these people all right you gotta go. I don't know. I'm interested in the all star game

[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.360]
There's no hitting. It's the next division game the score is like 15 to 10. It's a joke

[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.600]
But I'm not discouraging people the place is gonna be packed gonna be a lot of people there are pretenders like mode this morning

[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.360]
Oh, it's all star weekend. He hates hockey. He's not gonna be there. He's not interested

[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.540]
Gellie told me that he was like under penalty of death if he talked about it for more than 30 seconds consecutive on that show

[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.520]
penalty of death

[00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.720]
He said that Moe was gonna you know put that chord that the

[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.080]
Kloss may bad chord around his neck and strangle him

[00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.520]
Especially during football season. It is a no-no is what it is. It's a no-no

[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:38.880]
During that show mo moe. See now you got me confused. I don't know what the other column well

[00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.940]
I do know what to call he's an asshole WQ. I am

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.980]
Yeah, like talking you speaking. Yeah, sir

[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.180]
Uh, I just wanted to say something about bush, you know

[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.220]
It really bugs me that this guy is the hero of 9-11

[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.340]
When he got a specific warning on august 6

[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:04.340]
2001 that we were gonna have an attack and he did nothing about it

[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:05.940]
Yeah, well we've already been through all of that sir

[00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:10.500]
But the problem is the american people most of them are just as ignorant or even dumber than he is and so as a result

[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.120]
You know wave the flag and they get all whipped up and emotional and they don't understand they don't see you through all of this crap

[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:22.840]
Right and the press goes along with and you notice in all of these weeks and months now that they're going on where they've had to make the case for this invasion of Iraq

[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:30.780]
They because they can't find specifics they keep making all these illusions to these general things that that don't exist and they keep having a press conferences and they

[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:35.560]
Press core they yuck it up with rumsfeld, you know, and everything's a big joke and they yuck it up without a fly sure

[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.180]
The other day everything's a big yuck yuck and in the meantime we're talking about dropping nuclear weapons

[00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.360]
Right and you know and i've heard that anybody that asks the really tough questions

[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.860]
They kind of get excluded. Yeah, they suddenly don't call them anymore like the kid that gets put in the back of the classroom

[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.920]
Exactly well good luck to you pal hang hide under the bed. I'll be seeing you okay

[00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:00.960]
Nukes use in a rack could spin out of control right senator Ted Kennedy it's and from the LA times it's in the day sun sentinel

[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.120]
Do i have time to read it now? No, in fact, I may not read it

[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.580]
But you ought to read it

[00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:10.380]
Threat there in your sunset. All on the op-ed page nukes use interact could spin out of control

[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.680]
A dangerous world. Just grew more dangerous as Teddy Kennedy reports that the administration is kind of playing in the preemptive use of nuclear weapons

[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.480]
Interaction set off alarm bills that this could not only be the wrong work the wrong time

[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.300]
But it could quickly spin out of control

[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:29.140]
Initiating the use of nuclear weapons would make a conflict with Iraq potentially catastrophic says senator 10

[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.260]
Which we know and the public is going

[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.280]
But we're listed on bad we'd be good. You know and square everybody else

[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.620]
How about everybody? Oh, when that when that statement that foreign policy statement came out several months ago

[00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:42.700]
Remember and I read it on a year right and it's in mother Jones

[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.200]
How I'll come everybody was like saying are you out of your mind?

[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.900]
You make Teddy Roosevelt look like a Sunday school preacher. Are you crazy person?

[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.400]
All of a sudden we're going to become imperialist and we're better than everybody else and

[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.480]
Nobody else is gonna about

[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:59.560]
It's that we're like that. Do you hear that? I heard it. That was jack caper. He's another he's another asshole

[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.280]
We're supporting you five six

[00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.840]
You a. Yeah

[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.780]
This is the new Roger show

[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.600]
This is your party

[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.540]
Any questions

[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.100]
I

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.340]
Said when I grow up that's what I want to do

[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.640]
Now it's run by greedy corporate

[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.060]
with

[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.580]
And

[00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:49.000]
It

[00:10:59.140 --> 00:10:59.520]
Is

[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:03.560]
Where you are?

[00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.640]
The lighter radio you want we take your place

[00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.980]
They told us that our lights are storming out and change

[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:20.480]
And find the way for thousands of hours in the fair

[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.960]
It's you expect that if you're strong to play it on the air

[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.040]
Play it all with you

[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.720]
Not in this for a friend

[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.840]
We're champions of radio stars

[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:34.100]
We're champions of radio stars

[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.840]
We're champions of radio stars

[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.740]
We're champions of radio stars

[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:41.800]
You don't care

[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.120]
10, all three and five, 60 W quimits are official start of the show now

[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:51.700]
That's what we do, 90, 10 we screw around and we start to show a 10

[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.880]
Now could I think we solve it again and maybe not

[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.880]
And if not then Monday will solve it a different way

[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.320]
Huh?

[00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:58.580]
We'll do something

[00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.640]
Oh by the way, Lowry Maze, you asshole and David Ross

[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.520]
You asshole

[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.660]
Yeah, I keep 10, let's read the replay that

[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:07.420]
Hearings yesterday in Washington and Clear Channel says

[00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.020]
Oh well we succeed when radio station serve the needs of local community

[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.660]
Right, what's that gonna start?

[00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:15.800]
You cookie cutter morons, you asshole

[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.820]
Right, oh he, I like the way he says that you know what?

[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.860]
That is like with real, in fact, Betje Lin has just got emotional now

[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.340]
He probably reached for the cucumbers

[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:25.660]
Man

[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.540]
Well she gets excited when she hears that

[00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.380]
You asshole

[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:30.360]
Sorry

[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.420]
Try to spruce up her sex life a little bit

[00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.560]
That was our poll yesterday which we'll get to momentarily

[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:37.420]
After I've read about Clear Channel Communications

[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.320]
The head of Clear Channel Communications Inc yesterday

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:45.260]
sought to convince skeptical US lawmakers that the nation's largest radio station

[00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:48.640]
owner is not the armed twisting brute portrayed by smaller rivals and musicians

[00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.820]
Clear Channel CEO Lowry Maze

[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.700]
You asshole

[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.760]
Plantly denied allegations from Rockstar Don Henley and other critics that the media empires

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.340]
1200 plus stations have muscled out smaller rivals

[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.520]
Taken bribes to play songs or engage in other anti-competitive practices

[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.340]
You asshole

[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.960]
Facing sharp questioning from members of the Senate Commerce Committee Maze pointed out

[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.740]
He painted Clear Channel as a fierce competitor that has thrived since media regulations

[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.660]
who were released in 1996 under Bubba due to its careful audience research

[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:18.740]
Now we do understand that he didn't appoint all the members of the FCC but nevertheless

[00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.100]
It was during the Bubba era

[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.940]
So it's when you can't the blame on Bush

[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.560]
We succeed when radio station serving the needs of local communities Maze said

[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.320]
You asshole

[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.240]
Clear Channel takes in now listen to this

[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.940]
Roughly one out of four advertising dollars in the radio industry

[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:37.020]
And also overseas rapidly growing concert promotion and billboard advertising businesses

[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.620]
If ever in fact if you look up Parker Brothers Monopoly

[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:42.240]
You'll see a picture of Pete Bolger

[00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.060]
And David Ross

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.000]
You asshole

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.080]
And Ronna Thank Wolf

[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:47.020]
You asshole

[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:49.220]
Critics say it's created a blend that we're here we go

[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.760]
Here is the definitive comment about cheap channel

[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.040]
Critics say it's created a blend network of sound alike stations that very little from city to city

[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.920]
Which I just got through San Olme moments ago

[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.660]
Here is Dr. Laura

[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.020]
Here is Lord Aslan Ball

[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:03.480]
Here is the Schnittmeister

[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.740]
Here is whatever else

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.560]
So that's all I got

[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.280]
No thanks

[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.660]
Car wash guys just asking if I wanted my car wash

[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:11.880]
We don't get nervous about it

[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.120]
What was you talking about?

[00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.020]
That's how it was

[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:14.980]
I just said no thanks

[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:18.220]
Maybe the thought Miguel just came in here and flashed through something I don't know

[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:20.240]
I'm doing a radio show now

[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.960]
Camagel's not nice to talk with your mouth full

[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.140]
They've also charged a clear channel with using their radio market power to squeeze out rivals

[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:30.160]
Jack up concert ticket prices and steer business to its concert promotion arm

[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.120]
That's why they got all those billboards by the way

[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.480]
Beside the fact that this place is such a cheap pass outfit and lies a lot

[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.980]
But that's why they got all the 80 million billboards is because they own them

[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:39.940]
Haha

[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:47.680]
Alligations of pay all alike pay for play practices have dogs pretty cheap channel along with the rest of the music business

[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.620]
Don Henley accused clear channel of blackballing artists who didn't tour with its concert promotion arm

[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.560]
Or play for free at benefit shows put on by its radio stations

[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560]
You know what it reminds me of?

[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.100]
You remember when they were out there in Vegas

[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.680]
And they were talking to Al Martino

[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.780]
Johnny, I thought it was Johnny Fontaine

[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.360]
Right

[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.200]
And they had him sign a contract

[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.700]
We know we appreciate the guy father likes that ade and forming so much to perform for many times

[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.340]
You're gonna encourage some of your friends in the business to do the same

[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.980]
Etc. That's what it reminds me of

[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.960]
Henley who's greatest hits package with his band Ego's ranks is the number one selling record of all time

[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.740]
City could be scratched from clear channel playlist for testifying in private committee

[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:28.300]
But maize dismissed his charge

[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.940]
As long as our audience wants to hear Mr. Henley's music he has no threat of recognition maize replied

[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:39.380]
Over the past year clear clear channels emerged as a poster child for both the drawbacks and benefits of media consolidation

[00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:43.220]
As the FCC considers whether to relax ownership limits further

[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.000]
Quartz Quartz

[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.360]
Oh my god, yeah that's what they're doing

[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.520]
Yeah that's what the big fear is about

[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.200]
We're doomed

[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:50.940]
Well not that fear

[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.240]
Some lawmakers point to clear channel when they voice concerns that loosen ownership caps with a lot of broadcasters

[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.480]
To focus on cutting costs by laying off staff

[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.040]
Rather than serving local markets are providing a wide range of news entertainment programming

[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:07.860]
We must preserve radio as a medium-forward democracy said Wisconsin Democratic Senator Russ Feingold

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.760]
Who is introduced to bill over rent cheap channel from expanding further and curb its alleged anti-competitive practices

[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:17.380]
But several Republican senators said oh here's my favorite all you good right wingers out there

[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:24.620]
Several Republican senators said the company was simply practicing sound business and helping turn around the industry that was largely unprofitable ten years ago

[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:25.660]
Huh

[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.760]
Feingold and California Democratic representative Howard Burman said they had asked the Justice Department to investigate but it got no response

[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.560]
The Justice Department did not return a call seeking comment. This is from Washington Post

[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:42.160]
Arizona Republican Senator John McCain peppered maze with questions and quibbled with them over several claims

[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:46.340]
But did not indicate whether his committee would take up fine goals bill or otherwise press the company further

[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:46.600]
Yeah

[00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:51.760]
Several Republican senators said the company was simply practicing sound business practices

[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:56.360]
In other words we like monopolies we like big business. That's our bread and butter. That's what it's all about

[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.280]
And by the way no butter on my grilled cheese please pony tail

[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:06.040]
Well he made such a production out of that Carlos you know we turn a call when you are taking a crap or whatever you were doing. Is that what you were doing?

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.920]
I was taking a pee

[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:14.300]
Well okay don't have to get sensitive about the audiences now marking these things down okay

[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.160]
1003 George takes a pee and don't blame me okay see

[00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:26.980]
Just calm down you asshole he just says that would set the emotion of it from the bottom of his big road man

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.940]
Sounds like it starts in his back home comes out his mouth like a lot of other things he says

[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.000]
So anyway there you go cheap channel says it's a for what they're basically trying to say is

[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.800]
I mean I thought it was like free enterprise so in other words if the radio was unprofitable

[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.880]
It's like every other industry the right blue can make it you know they survive

[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.980]
But at least they have the opportunity to come in and bring it alternative program into create jobs for different people

[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:58.440]
To give the audience out there something to choose from it's same as a set of the same cookie cutter crap in every market in the country

[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:03.660]
The good ones thrive the bad ones right but of course the people some people in this country aren't for free enterprise

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.020]
All they care about is big business making it stronger and giving you fewer choices

[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.000]
For example the people who were buying drugs on the internet from Canada you see that story this way

[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.280]
Yeah right I'm right I want to stop that right you cut off your water if you keep doing that up

[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:23.820]
Because we want to be able to gouge the public right in other words if you can buy something for a dollar instead of ten dollars

[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.700]
Shouldn't you be able to do that that's called the free marketplace not if it's medicine and your life depends on it

[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:34.660]
Oh I forgot about that and you have to choose between having a meal and like taking your medicine things like that with so many people are doing

[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:42.240]
Well I'm going to tell you something I think I think that a lot of people in this country do like to get raped and I really do

[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.160]
Well it's funny because it's happening every day

[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:52.120]
Nine minutes after ten I what am I getting so worked up about here okay just calm down relax it's Friday we're very excited about that

[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.160]
We finally figured out that nine to ten hour we'll just do the comedy bits nine to ten on Wednesday mornings

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.940]
Which I'm sure will upset Pete from okay to you whatever he's but that's the way it goes you can't please everybody in fact in this town

[00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:08.720]
It's a miracle if you can ever please anybody I got it yeah greenless comedy bedtime stories screenless comedy bedtime stories

[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:19.300]
With two or three poles and music and a lot of music and some bg you asshole and a lot of sports scores

[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.960]
Four to three two to one five two maple leaves

[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:28.760]
We could have Zach do updates as a matter of fact we don't want Zach to an updates on this show

[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.880]
We don't take it personal Zach we like you but we don't have room in here for you

[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:39.400]
We don't we don't do we have room in here for him no no this is not a big studio okay Zach

[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.460]

Great good answer like they said family feud good answer good answer George that is what he's thinking about

[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.740]
And he said something about you know like 30 sleepless nights because he's under such tremendous pressure you know

[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:25.700]
Fred that he might fart in a mose face or like the wrong flavor or something like that look at him cross-eyed and right away you asshole you're out

Now we know what's your problem is Moe it's a four-letter word it's called life

[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.480]
How's speaking of food how about bagel high man the bagel high is now under new ownership with the same great name and even better food than ever

[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:50.220]
The bagel high restaurant and deli at the southeast corner of Pines University has gotten orders Brian and Fran and the place like I just said only moments ago is even better than used to be

[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:56.960]
They feature hand ruled bagels and everything is made fresh from scratch white beef salad egg salad tuna salad chicken salad and more

[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.460]
Stopping the day for the best lunch special in the universe you'll get a sandwich pile

How would delicious corn beef pastrami turkey or salami fries, coleslaw, pickle and soda only 599

[00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:27.040]
The bagel high opens daily for breakfast at 6 a.m. with hot fresh handmade ruled bagels seven days a week and a 259 breakfast special which includes two eggs, potatoes, oatmeal, coffee and a bagel

Now that they want a Super Bowl they thought they were bad before now they're really move like like that

[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.880]
Here's one that said this is interesting

[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.100]
It says you spoke about guys that are good looking but get up here as they take off their clothes

[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:03.420]
Oh you won't believe who I threw a fax away from besides crazy HH for more ever is Mitch

[00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.920]
And for Mitch from video waves

[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.520]

And he's like screating me about well Sandwich or Sandwich Olof you're an idiot Mitch

[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.680]
At least you're consistent okay don't give me lectures about what to say on a year

[00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:22.920]
Okay the organization is just continuing to dismantle the team and don't be S.M.E.

[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:27.420]
Anyway you spoke about guys that are good looking but get ugly as they take off their clothes

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:33.560]
I also heard you some time ago mention that Matt Damon in the tell that Mr. Ripley looking so pale and pasty which was on purpose

[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:39.180]
There's one scene in the born identity where Mr. Damon is washing a woman's hair and takes off his shirt

[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:44.700]
Let me tell you this is one scene and just his arms alone make the DVD purchase worth every penalty

[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.780]
Mont Penny Mama Mia it says how do you like that?

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.500]
See I can't you know what bothers me about him?

[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:55.960]
The teeth he's got when he smiles or laughs like there's something about his teeth

[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.340]
When you see this scene you won't be looking at his face it says of course he doesn't take enough off in the scene

[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.660]
It isn't she says it's not very long or he or whoever it isn't very long

[00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.840]
I thought it was just if he didn't take his clothes off how do they know it isn't very long

[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.980]
No I'm not this whole face you think that he's ugly?

[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.100]
I think he's ugly like kind of like horsey looking you mean?

[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:20.060]
Like Carlos I know that's now you really have lost it okay

[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.380]
Now I know that your shipment must have come in time for the weekend

[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.760]
Anybody out there needs some real good drugs called George okay because obviously the shipment came in

[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:34.160]
You asshole he's wrong with mediocre Matt Damon right that's not true

[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.420]
All right well what do you know about guys anymore what do you know about with it?

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:40.880]
Plenty I know good looking women I'm gonna want to turn you on a Britney Spears right?

[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.920]
I see admits that you wouldn't know Britney Spears from your ass okay if it wasn't for me

[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:51.960]
He's like like me stop I know a beautiful a hot looking babe when I see one doesn't mean I want a door but I sure can recognize it

[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.720]
Well I know what is it what's all that I look like

[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:58.780]
Oh well when you're sitting right next to one you can just go just anything that looks anywhere close

[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:01.240]
You got all mighty as he grotesque when how do you find him?

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:05.540]
I mean here's when it says I'm telling you the fast people are psychotic today

[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:09.780]
What do you mean you're not doing the rock and roll bands that shouldn't be a player you asshole?

[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.800]
That's what it says you asshole

[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.780]
It's Friday we want to have some fun you're getting us all worked up relax brother

[00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:18.420]
It's an I'm relaxed do I sound a little hyper today not me I'm relaxed

[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:20.100]
How's wrong with you?

[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.700]
No the reason we're not doing that poll is because it dawned on me once we started

[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:29.960]
That way it could go on for like months I mean with it if this is a market where there were like some reasonable music stations

[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.800]
Then it would be like a limited number but since they don't play any good groups for the most part

[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:37.940]
Then we could have every every group you like that's what you'd like to have on that pool

[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:43.640]
And you'd be right even the monkeys George even the most still foaming at the mouth about what you said

[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.320]
You asshole about the monkeys yesterday

[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.620]
A lot of people like the monkey look let's face it we're talking different era

[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:55.080]
The music that they're sending all these facts and which is a good sign that means we got somebody under the age of a hundred out there listening

[00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:02.280]
I like the monkeys I don't think I'm talking about the zoo okay I'm not the metro zoo I'm talking about the music

[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.000]
I don't think they're being underplayed

[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:10.120]
I can't tell you the last time I heard a monkey song of course I also can't tell you the last time I turned on FM

[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:17.320]
Do you think that man you can who plays the monkeys besides magic who else would play the how would I know

[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:22.560]
How do you know that they're not being that they're not being played too little if you're not listening

[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.160]
I'm not used to listen to the radio every once in a while you know

[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:31.460]
When was this what year was this what decade what century huh 1980 1980 that's about the last time I tried it too

[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.980]
In fact last time I listen to FM was when I was on Zeta sounded good to me

[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:42.720]
What do you laugh at about we had to invite away casted over we had I have big big big fat numbers in there okay

[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:49.720]
Who the hell you can and we had like not just one show to compete with which is all you got we had like eight million shows

[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.720]
We're waiting for the morning and tonight I talk my feet for your chars

[00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.820]

How happened to the not the bird I mean what happened to the cart the cackle it should be right there

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:33.600]
Well guess what it's not mister that or fact I was playing it once when you were a kid right I know that I heard that so I know that you were

[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:41.780]
Dicking with that cart okay and that's what it's not here that would be there not not here oh no anyway now what was that in response to

[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:47.200]
I wasn't responsible the fact of music on FM here sucks but they have these amazing things called CDs and once in a

[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.080]
Watt you might buy one and you can get like a rebate in between downloading all the music for free from well we're not

Suggesting that but we know you're all doing that okay from when mix and all the others what what what do you listen going like that?

[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:07.820]
Well why is he putting his I mean they're all doing that already oh he's not a secret he's calling about the CD rebate I hate to break the news

[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:19.820]
It's not a secret okay that people I don't want to mention names are downloading music by the thousands and thousands and thousands of titles free from the Internet

[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:29.660]

[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:39.080]
Bishop and Bush's church in new anti war add the National Council of Church is a beginner in a television commercial today in which a bishop of the United Methodist Church President Bush's

[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:49.180]
Denomination says going to war against direct violates God's law and the teachings of Jesus Christ how do you like that huh why do that yeah well this is his

[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:21.840]
peace movement is in the middle of the road in Patriotic corn to win without wars National director former representative Tom Andrews Democrat

[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.940]
of Maine some national TV networks and local stations ever injected the anti war coalition's ever to by advertising time

[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:33.400]
signed in controversial content of its ads the first spot which aired in 14 cities beginning January 16

[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:39.000]
showed a little to a plucking pedals from a daisy during a missile launch countdown followed by a nuclear mushroom cloud

[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.780]
it was a remake of one of the most famous political ads in history and attempted 1964 by President Lyndon B. Johnson's campaign

[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.700]
the portrays are public and opponent Barry Goldwater as a warmonger what do you mean an attempt

[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:55.540]
oh oh and isn't interesting after a Goldwater lost that election how all of a sudden became so moderate and so

[00:30:55.540 --> 00:31:00.620]
reasonable huh just a man oh speaking of moderate and reasonable there's Tommy who looks like he just came from hell

[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.000]

break first you know so we don't have to interrupt ourselves in midstream a lot of people out there

[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.520]

[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:30.500]
they have to keep interrupting in midstream which is not easy to do by the way though we asked yesterday

[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:22.640]
feel I don't know what was going on this building this morning I came in and khiki Carlos was bent

[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.840]
over a chair behind a reception desk. Anyway, here's the result of the poll.

[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.040]
From yesterday, which of these statements best describes your sex life speaking of that?

[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:38.020]
1168 votes. Could be better, 199. Sensational 190, 16.2%.

[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:43.120]
Aren't we jealous of those 190 people? Aren't we jealous?

[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:51.180]
Oh, assuming we believe them. Oh, hey, listen, it's all relative. Sensational means maybe they're

[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.880]
late once every six months. Who the hell knows? Who knows what they consider to be sensational?

[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.140]
Who knows what kind of disgusting Harry Grotesque look and women are sleeping with?

[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:05.700]
That smell real bad and have bad breath and doors fart a lot. Who knows? Or guys?

[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:15.420]
Let's see, could be better, 199. Sensational 190. Okay, 183. Could be a lot better, 182. Solo 127, 10.8%.

[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:23.380]
Non-existent 97, something of the past 87. I'm desperate 56. And weak, would you poo poo that 47?

[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:29.240]
Even though it did come in last week. I just thought it was too similar to another entry.

[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:34.960]
Yeah, but whatever. To another entry is that another one of your little double-on-tons here to another entry as in...

[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:38.400]
No, we seem to be obsessed with... Got a brain. Not me.

[00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:43.020]
Here's a... So we got on our website also this column, which I'm not going to waste my time with

[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.720]
that Christoph, flogging the French. I'd rather we do something else to the French because it's with an F.

[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.120]
But there is one interesting second paragraph. The European edition of Time Magazine has been

[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:57.960]
conducting a poll on its website. Which country poses the greatest danger to world peace in 2003?

[00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:05.240]
With 318,000 votes cast so far from all over the world of Europe, the responses are North Korea 7%,

[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:08.240]
Iraq 8%, the United States 84%.

[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:10.080]
Ah!

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:15.100]
So when somebody tells you that the whole world hates us already and that if we start reading

[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.440]
doing wild and crazy things, they're going to hate us even a lot more, which makes our security

[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:23.980]
in your very life worth a lot less. Don't poo poo it, okay? Like George is so quick to poo poo things.

[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:24.820]
You asshole!

[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:25.320]
Yeah.

[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.680]
Oh, you know something I get... I think I get like a little tremor when I hear him say that.

[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:34.480]
I'm going to admit it. I just get like a little... I don't want to say where, but...

[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:34.780]
Back home!

[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.500]
Yeah. He uses that big announcer.

[00:38:36.500 --> 00:38:37.960]
Quiver when he says...

[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.720]
You asshole!

[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.080]
Oh! Man!

[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.060]
Puts me in my place.

[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:47.140]
Here's today's poll, which we thank chronic, a real sick person out there. I don't want to

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:51.100]
mention Jeff Heist former neighbor. I guess it shows that if you throw enough crap out of the

[00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.800]
air sooner or later, some of it will come down and hit the ground.

[00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:56.960]
Today's poll, movies that made Krampman cry, but they won't admit it.

[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.320]
Now here's the list so far, most of which he sent.

[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.280]
Now where's the ones that we added?

[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.080]
Any idea?

[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:05.980]
None.

[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:09.220]
Well, I've only got 6,000 pieces of thing here in front of me here.

[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:09.700]
Huh?

[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.860]
Oh, here it is. Here's the ones we added.

[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.440]
Well, it's only the one I added, which is Rain Man.

[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.160]
That was pretty like it's a...

[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.160]
Emotion moment, sir.

[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:21.420]
It was.

[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:27.020]
Anyway, movies that made Man Crybo, and although I do admit it, see, then bother me, it won't hurt my image.

[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:28.240]
ET

[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:30.500]
Feel the dreams.

[00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:31.920]
Pretty woman.

[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.480]
Brian Song.

[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.180]
Shindler's list.

[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.880]
Oh, you see that yet?

[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:37.280]
Yeah.

[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.400]
Driving Miss Daisy is a really good Rudy love story.

[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.080]
Rocky won.

[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.800]
And she dead?

[00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:45.120]
Adrian.

[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:48.180]
Adrian.

[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.400]
For Rocky?

[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.600]
No, no, no, no.

[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:51.240]
Love story.

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:51.940]
What was your name?

[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.980]
Ryan McNeil, and I can see your face.

[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.600]
Oh, man, I see that's bad.

[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:01.500]
Oh, it's coming to me.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:02.420]
I think she died.

[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.860]
I don't think so.

[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.320]
And doesn't he have...

[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.840]
He has something like old age or something.

[00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:08.560]
Yeah, he has old age.

[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.360]
Ryan McNeil's got...

[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.420]
Oh, he's got some kind of a thing.

[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.460]
Ryan McNeil and something in love story.

[00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:16.240]
Come on, let's see who's got the worst dead brain death disease.

[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.800]
I can see her face right now.

[00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:19.560]
I'm looking at her.

[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.380]
I see her.

[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.200]
What's his name?

[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:21.440]
Ray Mulan.

[00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:21.620]
I'm a great...

[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.100]
Ray Mulan.

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:22.780]
Alan Mulan.

[00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:23.340]
Very good.

[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.620]
Ray Mulan played the daddy.

[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:25.600]
Remember that?

[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:27.980]
No.

[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.400]
Ray Mulan played his daddy.

[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:31.160]
No, I don't remember.

[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.440]
The hard, hard, and nasty miserable obnoxious.

[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.320]
You went home long ago.

[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.220]
I think it was too much of a deal.

[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.880]
Well, that's so good points for me.

[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:37.680]
You got Alan McGraw.

[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.360]
Got Ray Mulan.

[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760]
And Carlos who got the Ryan McNeil,

[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.980]
who's old and got something.

[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:44.960]
Rocky one and FATSO.

[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.140]
Now I put down Ray Man.

[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.000]
And also it's a wonderful life.

[00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:48.820]
I got my choice.

[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:49.440]
And you know what?

[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.880]
I do cry when I see wonderful life.

[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.140]
But not during the movie.

[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:54.100]
That's when I see it comes on my screen and I change it.

[00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:54.980]
I cry a lot.

[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.880]
I don't that it's I didn't want to say it.

[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.660]
Because Jimmy's I like Jimmy Stewart.

[00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.700]
Like in Weird Window and there were a few movies.

[00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.540]
I thought he was very good in the Hitchcock movies.

[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:04.940]
Rope.

[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:05.840]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:08.680]
But it's a wonderful life.

[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.800]
Is the was the stereo type of what Jimmy Stewart became.

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:15.340]
In the start of a kind of.

[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.480]
I don't like that Jimmy Stewart.

[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.080]
Every time you mention it, I keep Jones and for that bit we have.

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.260]
Jimmy Stewart screws who?

[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.080]
Catherine Hepburn.

[00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:23.820]
No.

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.980]
Now what what a what kind of a thing is that we got Jimmy and Danny.

[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:28.700]
Jimmy and Danny.

[00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.200]
And now the sound of Jimmy Stewart.

[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.740]
Mickey love the Catherine Hepburn.

[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.420]
Now what?

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.980]
Oh yeah.

[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:39.720]
What are you doing?

[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.020]
Yeah.

[00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.480]
What are you doing?

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:45.900]
Yeah.

[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:51.360]
Get the fuck out of here.

[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:51.720]
Oh.

[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:53.440]
Oh.

[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.360]
21 to 11.

[00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:03.980]
This got a phony Brian Craig facts very bad very weak phony.

[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.640]
A New England Paul speaking of phony fax.

[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.840]
He says don't know who sent that fax.

[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:07.160]
You're right.

[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:07.880]
Apologize.

[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:08.680]
It wasn't me.

[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:09.780]
It wasn't the New England Paul.

[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.540]
If I want to get blamed for something or be called an asshole if I deserve it.

[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.440]
You're right.

[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.000]
New England Paul.

[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:14.540]
So sorry.

[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.400]
It was the other chronic Paul has also become really even more chronic than the New England

[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:18.700]
shoulder.

[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.020]
Brian Craig by the way is going to be taking over Georgia's jobs.

[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:22.580]
Starting Monday.

[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:25.440]
So let's see if we got a few here.

[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:25.580]
Huh?

[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.100]
And I'm sure we'll get a lot more of these real tear jerks.

[00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:28.620]
Go to the petite.

[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.840]
And from what I'm seeing here on our pool there must be a lot of jerkers out there.

[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:36.200]
When you think since we're doing tears today.

[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:37.780]
So let's see.

[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.260]
George again you notice the pattern you caught me into playing that because I think he's

[00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.880]
getting paid off by somebody who does not see this show do too well.

[00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.560]
Getting me to play all those unfunny comedy.

[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:48.800]
I thought it was very amusing myself.

[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.400]
I thought it was funny but you Howard thought it was funny.

[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.060]
Who?

[00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:53.700]
You asshole.

[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.520]
Just relax.

[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:54.900]
Okay.

[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:55.200]
Stop.

[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:56.040]
Will you stop it?

[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.640]
See when you're on by yourself.

[00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.360]
You don't have the balls now that you got the new contract.

[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.100]
That's not true.

[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:00.160]

[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:00.640]
What?

[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.000]
I said everything that was worth saying during those two weeks of vacation.

[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.220]
About what?

[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.660]
About anything and everybody.

[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:08.820]
About him trying to get your ass fired.

[00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.080]

[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:09.460]
Yeah.

[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.760]
And being a hard ass.

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:11.000]
Yeah.

[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.880]
And having a bad hair piece.

[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.360]
That too.

[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:14.980]
And playing too much Marjolton and shuffleboard.

[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:15.500]
All of it.

[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:18.240]
And where your chuckered pants and having bad varicose veins and playing too much golf.

[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:19.660]
With old people in Boka.

[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.040]
Carlos said you never see this.

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:21.660]
Did you ever say anything about it?

[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.220]
He's shaking his head.

[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.160]
He said never said a word.

[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:24.800]
But what would he know?

[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.280]
Not much.

[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.720]
Where is that sandwich ponytail?

[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:29.260]
Let's go.

[00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:30.400]
How hard could it be?

[00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.480]
We didn't have to make a big production about this.

[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:33.880]
I don't want to sound pushy or ungrateful.

[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.560]
But since I saw that, I should have taken Geldy's sandwich.

[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:36.980]
You know what?

[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.620]
Screw him.

[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:40.980]
Got to try to stab my good friend Jogs in the back.

[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:42.920]
Try to get that Panther play by play job.

[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.880]
Hi everybody.

[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.260]
It's time for the Panther game.

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:47.440]
I mean, you know, what is that?

[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:49.440]
What is that?

[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:53.500]
That was okay for Foster and Bill Hewitt that high pitched false set okay, you know.

[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:57.420]
But I mean, I don't think that's the sound that people want to hear on a sports cast.

[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:57.840]
Do you?

[00:43:58.640 --> 00:43:59.300]
You think so?

[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:00.600]
How would I know?

[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:02.660]
Well, you better get with it, mister.

[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.260]
You've been to a hockey game or two in your time.

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:04.500]
Right.

[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:04.880]
See?

[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:07.180]
Do you want to hear somebody doing play by play?

[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.220]
Who talks like that?

[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.120]
I don't think so.

[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:10.780]
So I'm next time there's one out there.

[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.780]
I'm going to eat Geldy's damn.

[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.400]
That's going to be my new diet, by the way.

[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:15.220]
Although he was really good.

[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.040]
Oh, Dr. Bob was on the Donny Who last night.

[00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:18.540]
I was one of the 10 people watching briefly.

[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:22.880]
And between the hockey games, there was Dr. Bob on there who looks very old, by the way.

[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:24.920]
Your close personal friend Dr. Bob Atkins.

[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:25.300]
Yeah.

[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.460]
Atkins is good.

[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.240]
It really is.

[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.500]
If you can do it.

[00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.040]
Right.

[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:29.640]
Yeah.

[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.960]
If you can do it, I can't do it.

[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.400]
I'm just telling you right now, I can't do it.

[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.260]
He says, don't make excuses.

[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:38.240]
That's your emotions.

[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.620]
It's there.

[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:39.740]
I can't do it.

[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:41.840]
I need to put a thing.

[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:43.660]
And how about if you?

[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:44.640]
Sweet.

[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.340]
Like maybe some of them calls a cough drops.

[00:44:47.460 --> 00:44:48.460]
Those halls are sorbeter.

[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.500]
Oh, wow, by the way.

[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:50.100]
Yesterday.

[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:51.000]
Nice job.

[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:54.300]
Hey, I tell you speaking to something sweet and the Atkins die, which I just got through

[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:56.680]
Tony is so good for a lot of people if they can do it.

[00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.260]
The lights of white spoke is a story that will help you stay on it because other than just

[00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:04.660]
meat and cheese and lobster and steak and bacon and eggs, you know, even with all those things

[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:05.460]
under it sounds great.

[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.860]
But after a while, it gets ponderous repetitive.

[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.860]
If you want to find zillions of other great things that are low in carbs and they're

[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.480]
safe for that diet, the lights of white spoke is like a find in the desert.

[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.040]
Like a miracle.

[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.760]
I've got over 600 delicious low-carb food products all in this one great store.

[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.260]
This week tried the simply low-carb loaf of delicious new bread with just three grams of digestible carbs per slice

[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.020]
and delicious taste of whole wheat bread.

[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.480]
In fact, how come we don't have some of that?

[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:29.180]
What did you do with that loaf that PDLini brought in?

[00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:31.280]
That'd be great for like a grilled cheese sandwich with bacon.

[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:32.700]
Took it home.

[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.700]
You took it home?

[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:34.160]
Was it any good?

[00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:35.180]
Yeah, that's all right.

[00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.960]
So whether it's carb or light ice cream bread, chips, muffins, cheesecakes, pasta, and sauces,

[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.740]
the lights of white spoke is the place you'll find it.

[00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.520]
And you can track before your profit and your push.

[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.800]
Or before your buy at Hoseko, they got an eligible staff open seven days a week from 10 to 10

[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:53.000]
and they create the most complete line of Atkins products in the world that are always 25% off all day every day.

[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:54.080]
I'm sure you've heard the reports.

[00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.180]
Maybe you saw Dr. Bob on Fildon, he who last night.

[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.840]
Maybe you wanted to fill 10 viewers.

[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:02.300]
So if you're on Atkins and you want to get a whole variety of great things that are low in carbs and sugar,

[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:04.940]
here's the number one low-carb sugar-free store in the university,

[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:10.100]
lights of white spoke and you'll find it on the northeast corner of blades in 441 right next to Boston Market

[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.000]
or call them tool free at 1-877 Low Carb

[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.380]
or you'll find them on the world wicked wide web at lowcarb.com

[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:31.880]
One of the most acclaimed films of our time is now the musical event of the decade.

[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.600]
You want your love for and you want your love for out.

[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:38.060]
A story about what it means to hope.

[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.640]
A story about what it means to hope.

[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.520]
Scoring Academy Award winner Daniel Bay Lewis.

[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:45.600]
That's what is all about.

[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.440]
My left foot.

[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:48.600]
The musical.

[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.620]
Uh, you put your left foot back in.

[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.620]
You put your left foot back out.

[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:55.840]
My left foot.

[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:56.740]
The musical.

[00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.780]
This guy, he's putting his best foot forward.

[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.620]
1047, what, when I, what are you doing with my food?

[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.220]
Jeff Collins here from the Petzelov,

[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.980]
you brought me to food and what are you doing there?

[00:47:06.100 --> 00:47:07.620]
I'm just, I like having a mess here, okay?

[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.440]
I'm not turning to my concert just leave it up there.

[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.400]
Eat your sandwich and thank you very, very much.

[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.100]
Where's this from again?

[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:14.400]
Fried green tomato.

[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.780]
Fried green tomato, griffin and where?

[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:16.640]
Griffin and pine.

[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.220]
I'll thank you.

[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:17.840]
It was very, very good.

[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:20.100]
Grilled cheese on a whole wheat bread with bacon.

[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:20.720]
No butter.

[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:21.480]
No butter.

[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.340]
Gonna be my new diet.

[00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.420]
So I'm gonna eat his grilled cheese sandwiches with uh,

[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.240]
with or without bacon.

[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.400]
What are you laughing about on a whole wheat bread?

[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.700]
I'm not supposed to eat bread because it's high in carbohydrates,

[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.180]
but you know, this is a whole wheat bread.

[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.720]
And maybe George will bring back some of that really great bread

[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.220]
we were just talking about from PD Lenny.

[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:40.200]
That you all.

[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:43.760]
Anyway, here's a fact that says the following two stories

[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.740]
confirm suspicions of the Bush-Raysian

[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.800]
and his fabrication of evidence.

[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:48.620]
Look at that phone by the way with all the suggestions

[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:51.300]
on our poll on how many facts is not one call on the board.

[00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.880]
Boy, you people are just stiff, you know?

[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.580]
Don't look at us on this end of the show.

[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.540]
This end of the show is cook and man is smoking.

[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.440]
You people out there is a stiff as a piece of cardboard.

[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.560]
You know what I'm saying.

[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:03.120]
Of course you can't knock him because they're your customers.

[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.860]
By the way, pizza loft, two locations,

[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.140]
Davy and the plantation.

[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.560]
Right beyond Walgreens and plantation.

[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:09.700]
You can't see it from the street.

[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:11.480]
Right beyond Walgreens, not killing sunrise.

[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.020]
It's great.

[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.440]
Same great food is the other one and cheap prices and good food.

[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.800]
What I just say before, we got $80 million worth of free plug.

[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:19.740]
That's why he's still in business.

[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:21.800]
He voted on our poll yesterday.

[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.480]
He said his sex life was sensational.

[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.600]
You don't have one anymore.

[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.520]
Since he got dumped by that brought from my mirrors.

[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.120]
The following two stories confirm what we have bush lying about the IAAC.

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.100]
I don't think that's the right report that never existed.

[00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.220]
We have bush repeating, we firmly refuted nuclear aluminum tubes for applications.

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:43.920]
And now there's evidence and estimate for quite a while since the 1990 Defense Intelligence

[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:46.560]
Agency report that Sodom did not gas his own people.

[00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:47.340]
How do you like that?

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:50.000]
The lies are going to be deep and dangerous.

[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.180]
What do you mean, yeah, right?

[00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.100]
How do you know?

[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.560]
And if he did it with our gas anyway, we gave him the gas.

[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.100]
Yeah.

[00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:56.720]
What was the case?

[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:57.400]
We gave him the gas.

[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.600]
Why do we give him the bomb?

[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:01.220]
And what did we say about it then?

[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:02.300]
Did we say anything about it then?

[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.240]
Was Rumsby a love of their shake at his hand and smiling and kissing his ass?

[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:05.460]
Yes.

[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:06.940]
Everything we did is both good.

[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.640]
I mean, it's bad.

[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:07.980]
Right.

[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.940]
See, it's a good thing his mic is off, okay?

[00:49:11.120 --> 00:49:14.160]
Okay, I don't really, you know, if we went over there and we like blew his brains out,

[00:49:14.240 --> 00:49:14.920]
that's fine with me.

[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:15.380]
That's great.

[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.100]
But the idea that we're going to like start World War 3 maybe,

[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.600]
where God only knows there's an instigator, a whole bunch of terrorist crap

[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.400]
and jeopardize the lives of not only our troops but all the American people,

[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.940]
is a little bit unnerving but nevertheless.

[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:28.820]
Why are you talking?

[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:29.700]
Nobody can hear you.

[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.280]
I'm not going to turn on your microphone.

[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.200]
Are you going to start doing politics now?

[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:35.960]
Do you want to start doing politics?

[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.560]
Jeff Cohen of the pizza loft with two locations in Rowered County,

[00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:39.820]
making a lot of money and great food?

[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:40.420]
That'd be cool.

[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.020]
No, no, no, no, bad idea.

[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.080]
No, I'm going to tell stories about you pretty soon.

[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.840]
No, not a good idea.

[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:53.000]
Are you starting to make trouble for the automakers now and for the right wingers?

[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.340]
Two movies, Coco's Nest at the end when Nicholson has the lobotomy.

[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.060]
I didn't find anything tear jerking about Coco's Nest.

[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.360]
Did you?

[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.520]
Even when the Indian ran out?

[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.980]
I thought it was funnier in hell.

[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.520]
When the Indian ran out, I thought it was tear jerking.

[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:08.360]
Why?

[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.160]
Are you serious?

[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:10.760]
No.

[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:14.320]
Dear Hunter, when Christopher walking goes over the edge.

[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.400]
I don't need you to show me how to eat a hedge.

[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.700]
That's because you piled these up on a plate idiot.

[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.520]
Could you please play the bit Santana plays guitar?

[00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.480]
I have no idea what that is.

[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:27.060]
Is that in there?

[00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:27.620]
Santana?

[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.280]
Now are there napkins around here?

[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:29.740]
Something like that?

[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:31.820]
I'm going to have to like, smear up everything here and get it all oily.

[00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:36.280]
This is the only man in the world can make like a major giant production

[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.580]
about a cheap grilled cheese sandwich.

[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.860]
Which is not that I'm ungrateful.

[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.480]
I appreciate it more than you'll ever know.

[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:43.620]
But I mean, a major major production.

[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.380]
Here's a good fact that from the movie Maven, it says,

[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.960]
Allie McGraw's career died.

[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:49.820]
She's still alive.

[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:53.420]
We're building this pool, but of course Carlos is doing everything

[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:54.580]
but working feverishly on it.

[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.440]
He's bouncing around.

[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:55.940]
What's that?

[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:57.500]
Now let him take care of it.

[00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.040]
I don't want to sound ungrateful, but he's the food man.

[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:03.260]
Like I said, thanks for bringing him in.

[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.080]
He can't find one of the gun up his ass.

[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:08.560]
We got two of that.

[00:51:08.560 --> 00:51:09.660]
Enough napkins already.

[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:11.060]
Jesus Christ.

[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:13.880]
How about Old Yeller?

[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.440]
Says Sean.

[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:17.360]
You know, chronic Sean and Hollywood says, maybe it's another Sean.

[00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.060]
Old Yeller.

[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.320]
That's the classic, dude.

[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.580]
We got a couple of votes for Old Yeller.

[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:21.680]
Get that on there, Carlos.

[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.480]
I'm not right now.

[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.420]
He's down on busy eating.

[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.580]
These great grilled cheese.

[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.240]
I'm assuming you have to pay for it.

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:29.080]
Oh, Lord.

[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:29.680]
Thanks for a lot.

[00:51:30.340 --> 00:51:30.420]
Huh?

[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:30.940]
Well, Lord.

[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:31.660]
They're for a roof.

[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.480]
He bought a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches for like three and a half bucks

[00:51:35.480 --> 00:51:38.480]
and they gave him already $5,000 worth of free advertising in 10 minutes

[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:39.680]
and just started.

[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.960]
Don't start with a policy because it's not good for booze.

[00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:44.960]
One.

[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.400]
Hey, I don't know what it is.

[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.060]
I'm Jones in for a grilled cheese sandwich.

[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.740]
Which is a lot better than Jones in for like yesterday.

[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:53.560]
What are we talking about?

[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.320]
Spores.

[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:54.980]
Oh, yeah.

[00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:56.500]
Ice cream and candy and all that crap.

[00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:59.160]
So Dr. Bob last night, I'm thinking of myself.

[00:51:59.620 --> 00:51:59.840]
Mask.

[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:01.380]
Here's what it says, mask.

[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.120]
And my left foot, which is why I just played that.

[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:06.760]
Being a hard-hearted bastard that I am.

[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.140]
Never saw either one of those.

[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:09.840]
Mask wasn't that sheer, was it, mask?

[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:10.220]
Yeah.

[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:10.840]
She ought to be where it went.

[00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:12.560]
Believe me.

[00:52:13.800 --> 00:52:15.780]
Christ, you should have shared it with her ex-husband.

[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:19.520]
Look at her response.

[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:20.700]
We're getting on the phone on this.

[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:24.180]
See, I'm not going to, I didn't play the comedy, but it's 9 to 10 days.

[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:25.600]
We might do it through like 11 to 1.

[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.320]
I love these people.

[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:31.720]
Like give me all these instructions and lecture and praxis.

[00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.120]
And you do this and you look at a phone.

[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:34.940]
It's the same old crap.

[00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:35.880]
Here's never going to change.

[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.760]
Never going to change.

[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:42.420]
Here's a car and here his cell phone is going off in here.

[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:43.380]
Here's a car from Hollywood.

[00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:43.740]
Hello.

[00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:45.280]
Hey, how are you doing?

[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:45.660]
Okay.

[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.560]
I have a phone for you.

[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.480]
I just buy anyone not to rub it like a baby when they watch this.

[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.880]
It's called My Dog Skip.

[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.680]
It's more recent film, but it's a real tear jerker.

[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:57.340]
Oh, not about a dog dying.

[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.220]
Yeah, yeah, it is.

[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.580]
Dying dog always make you cry.

[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.060]
All right.

[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:03.380]
Well, usually,

[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:04.960]
yeah, I have a question.

[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.940]
I have one that's coming up pretty soon and I'm not so sure I'll cry too much.

[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:08.500]
Yeah, go ahead.

[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.340]
Who the hell is Defo?

[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:11.540]
Defo?

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:12.600]
Defo.

[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:13.900]
There's these doorboards.

[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:14.680]
Defo.

[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:15.980]
This guy with uh...

[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.120]
He used to play in Def Lepard.

[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.540]
Headphone to Defo.

[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:20.500]
Good question.

[00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:21.380]
We'll find out for him.

[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:22.020]
All right.

[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:22.380]
Thanks.

[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.560]
By the way, Chief Channel Loans and Billboards.

[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.220]
He don't work for them.

[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.460]
They actually had a buy and that's something out in the light bulb.

[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:30.140]
Had a buy those billboards or wherever he works for now.

[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:32.560]
Now, the rumor is we're going to have billboards here.

[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:33.580]
It was supposed to be in January,

[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:34.900]
but since today is the 34th,

[00:53:34.980 --> 00:53:35.660]
you see any coming over?

[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:36.020]
No.

[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:37.580]
That's the rumor.

[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:41.420]
The same billboards they've been promising me since before

[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:42.420]
Jesus was a baby.

[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:45.520]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.880]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T line.

[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:49.520]
Try to build a pool and no response.

[00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:51.220]
Movies that made men cry

[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:52.240]
but they won't admit to it.

[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:53.980]
It's a great pool.

[00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.060]
Even though it came from this truck and he stole it off the internet.

[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.140]
It's a sensational pool.

[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.180]
And you know what?

[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.200]
They just won't admit to it.

[00:54:01.220 --> 00:54:01.840]
That's the problem.

[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:03.040]
Here's Miami.

[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:03.380]
Hello.

[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.360]
What's up, Neil?

[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:04.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:07.060]
Hey Jeff, stick with the magic show.

[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:07.860]
That's first thing.

[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.320]
That's right.

[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:09.020]
Second thing.

[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.980]
No politics, man.

[00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:13.820]
Don't these right wingers know as soon as that first bomb

[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:19.100]
drops on Iraq, there's going to be terrorism all over the United States.

[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.080]
Right, all over the world.

[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.700]
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.620]
This guy is trying to find every way imaginable

[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:29.520]
and makes them up to just go after Iraq.

[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.980]
I mean, this is just ridiculous.

[00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:33.780]
I mean, that's it.

[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.000]
I'm going to the app to the mountains with George.

[00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:37.360]
Have a good time.

[00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:38.440]
Say it.

[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:39.320]
What's his name up there?

[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:39.840]
Mark Furman.

[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.600]
Al Qaeda is making dirty bomb, by the way,

[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:43.360]
to BBC reports.

[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.720]
British officials presenting evidence,

[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.380]
which they claim shows Al Qaeda has been trying

[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:50.200]
with several radioactive material to build a so-called dirty bomb.

[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:56.540]
They revealed that Osama bin Laden's weapons program was further on than anyone thought.

[00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.300]
But I think we need to go into Iraq because we know that they have some ties.

[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.720]
I love that line about, well, there were some Iraqi officials

[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.680]
who were like that one at the end of Kilden Jordan.

[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.600]
Once we're in Baghdad.

[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.600]
I guess the relic is that we know that there were a lot of Al Qaeda people

[00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:11.780]
in this country, huh?

[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.720]
And probably still are.

[00:55:12.820 --> 00:55:14.360]
So why don't we just drop bombs on the US?

[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.260]
Oh, there you go.

[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:15.940]
There's some ties.

[00:55:16.700 --> 00:55:17.760]
There's some ties there.

[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:19.400]
We know they were in Buffalo.

[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:20.900]
Let's drop some bombs on Buffalo.

[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:23.100]
So I bet you we have a unanimous vote on that.

[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.160]
I heard they were bow ties.

[00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:25.240]
Oh, well, I hope to the fall.

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:27.160]
I make sure the wind is blowing like south that day.

[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.260]
I don't want to float up there to Toronto.

[00:55:28.260 --> 00:55:28.920]
It's too close.

[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:32.660]
Yeah, we're invading Buffalo tomorrow, by the way.

[00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:37.100]
The French and Indian War Part Two.

[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:38.260]
Oh, look at that.

[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:39.620]
Just a bit of a little sandwich right there at Jeff.

[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:40.760]
Don't take it personal.

[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:45.860]
You notice that Iraq is building the pool on us.

[00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:47.000]
We speak right longer in the show.

[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.240]
See, we're all on one page here on this end.

[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.880]
The audience, by the way, still sit out there trying to figure it out.

[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:54.060]
Trying to figure out exactly.

[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.220]
And you know who started it all?

[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:55.800]
Good guy.

[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.260]
We appreciate his listening all these years.

[00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.400]
What that was his name?

[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.980]
The one who's the Pete, the KAT.

[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.280]
Listen, he's been listening to me a hundred years.

[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:02.420]
You asshole.

[00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:04.680]
My life and local.

[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:06.960]
This is 420560.

[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:08.780]
You way, you way.

[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:12.880]
Why the, you bastard.

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:17.280]
Have you ever turned on the radio and said that song makes me sick?

[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:18.320]
Girl, no.

[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.500]
K.O.P.K. Records presents.

[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:23.300]
Songs that make you wanna throw up.

[00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:24.980]
I got a job to go to.

[00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:25.920]
I'll check on you.

[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.040]
I got a case of stealing you.

[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.740]
I got a job to go to.

[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:32.740]
I got a job to go to.

[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.320]
Yes, I'm songs that make you wanna throw up.

[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.400]
You get sting.

[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:43.280]
I can't complete Barforama.

[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.340]
And who could forget their classic?

[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:47.000]
Puk, pu, pu.

[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:48.760]
Puk, pu, pu.

[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.460]
Puk, pu, pu.

[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:52.640]
Puk, pu, pu.

[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.120]
Puk, pu, pu.

[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.380]
You know you make me want a bar.

[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.660]
This is my goal, dream.

[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.440]
I'll go watch out now.

[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.400]
I'll come my cool, keep my,

[00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:02.960]
I'll come my new, the bar.

[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.160]
You don't do man.

[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:05.900]
You can do the puk, it.

[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.620]
Songs that make you wanna throw up.

[00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:10.320]
You make me want a baby.

[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.120]
You asshole.

[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:13.620]
111 and 560.

[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.920]
WQ, I'm happy, Friday 2.

[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.100]
I got a pristine lineup today.

[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.760]
No ball games, no, uh, Hazarai.

[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:20.320]
Jim had to do one, Hank Goldberg at 3.

[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.080]
The Hercune Hotline at 7.

[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.800]
The big 8 to 10.

[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.100]
That's where Landu Alseguiri and Dig is the operative word.

[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.600]
Eddie K from GA at 10 and, oh boy, caught myself in midstream.

[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.200]
By the way, happy birthday, Joe Castello.

[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.580]
We forgot yesterday, it's your just fault.

[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:36.120]
I wrote it on the 10th.

[00:57:36.120 --> 00:57:36.960]
He has to be in radio over it.

[00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:40.140]
Yeah, and we, I said, I saw it out of the corner of my eye on Wednesday.

[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:43.700]
So I gave you know, it's better to say it ahead of time, which we did on Wednesday than

[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.080]
too late.

[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:47.540]
Like even a birthday card to somebody a week after their birthday, because you forgot it.

[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.220]
It just doesn't have the same impact, you know.

[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.820]
In fact, it makes you feel really bad.

[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:56.240]
Like you did this just because somebody told you it was my birthday and you missed it.

[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.460]
And you really didn't care enough to send your very best in the first place and you suck.

[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.760]
You, uh, you asshole.

[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:02.020]
Yeah.

[00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:05.360]
Here's a fact from a chronic who says speaking of billboards.

[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:08.880]
By the way, thanks again, Jeff Cohen from the pizza law for a great grilled cheese sandwiches

[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:10.020]
about 10 of them.

[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:11.580]
Good, good stuff.

[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:12.860]
What did you say was from the fried pickle?

[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:14.820]
The fried tomato?

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.240]
Fried, uh, green tomato.

[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:19.740]
Oh, fried green tomato.

[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:21.340]
Don't be talking with your mouthful, mister.

[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:22.080]
That's bad radio.

[00:58:22.180 --> 00:58:23.480]
Bad, bad, bad radio.

[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.060]
Pretty soon you'd be working for a clear channel for about a fucking half an hour.

[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:31.700]
Pretty soon you'd be working for David Ross and all those other great, and PD Bulger.

[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:32.540]
You asshole.

[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.220]
You know something?

[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:35.460]
That's what I wish.

[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.400]
I don't wish ill-health on anybody, but you know what I wish?

[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.060]
I wish that a certain somebody who works in the morning on this station would wind up working

[00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.160]
for Pete Bulger.

[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:44.980]
Oh, oh.

[00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:50.180]
I would constantly be like, scored, scored down my pants, scored, scored all day long,

[00:58:50.180 --> 00:58:50.680]
scored, scored.

[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:51.960]
You having like scored scored?

[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.140]
Sqord, scored, scored.

[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:53.540]
Sqord, scored.

[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:57.920]
Anyway, speaking of billboards, I've seen way too much Schmidt Schmidt.

[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:58.940]
He's one hideous dude.

[00:58:59.300 --> 00:59:01.940]
At least one billboard with your old ugly ass in a pull-off fit, it said.

[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:02.200]
Yeah.

[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.120]
With anything.

[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.880]
Even in no outfit, just naked, anything.

[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:08.840]
Not this outfit.

[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.840]
I'm not voting until we get the list completed.

[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.440]
Then again, the thing is, which movie, uh, now what do we say?

[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.020]
What's your favorite movie that made men cry but won't admit it?

[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.160]
It's kind of awkward the way we're wording it, but how else do we do it?

[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.800]
And the reason it was so hard to get them to calls because they don't want to admit it.

[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:33.480]
And then there also has to be a category on their Eric, uh, never cry to the movie.

[00:59:35.260 --> 00:59:35.580]
Okay?

[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.160]
I'm sure that there are people out there, maybe even some women.

[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:39.880]
Maybe?

[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:41.020]
You want to have two categories?

[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.720]
Like, I'm a woman who never cried to the movie or I'm a man who never cried to the movie.

[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.360]
We could make it gender neutral.

[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.800]
I'm not sure who I am, but I never cried to the movie.

[00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:50.720]
Movie that made me cry.

[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:51.480]
I'm a little trope.

[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:56.900]
I once said in a movie with Brian Craig, cried my eyes out, bald my brains out.

[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:57.900]
You just what?

[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:58.500]
What's Brian?

[00:59:59.080 --> 00:59:59.300]
Bald.

[00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:00.360]
I didn't.

[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:00.720]
Oh, I know.

[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:01.560]
Norma.

[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.680]
Uh, and what was I just saying?

[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:03.880]
Okay, let's have two more categories.

[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.480]
I'm a woman who never cried to the movie and I'm a man who never cried to the movie.

[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:08.320]
Just for those people who can't vote for the other ones.

[01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:09.900]
I'm not saying everybody cries in the movies.

[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:11.960]
Like a bunch of silly, weak emotional.

[01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:12.920]
You know, it's just a movie.

[01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.640]
It's just a movie.

[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:15.500]
Lassie.

[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:16.620]
Oh, no, lassie.

[01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.960]
But he had to shoot yellow.

[01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:19.440]
Yeah, I didn't see that.

[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:21.400]
It was sad.

[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:22.460]
Was it sad?

[01:00:22.460 --> 01:00:24.980]
I don't remember, but I was a little kid, so I probably called.

[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.540]
Oh, and speaking of people, Miss, uh, treating dogs, did you see that story on the news last

[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.340]
night about that guy?

[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:30.880]
Where was that?

[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.320]
In Hollywood?

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:36.620]
With the two dogs tied to the tree, the two of me, she had no, oh, and I got my fingers crossed

[01:00:36.620 --> 01:00:38.020]
that we don't get a phone call today.

[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.940]
Two really nice dogs.

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:42.820]
I had them tied up with rope.

[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:45.340]
The one had the chain around the next so tight.

[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.840]
I mean, in the middle of my lunch, I don't want to tell you.

[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:50.660]
And had fleeced so bad that part of his ear fell off.

[01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:52.480]
And they arrested the guy.

[01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:53.720]
No food, no water.

[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.160]
Abused dogs.

[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.740]
I mean, just how could anybody do that?

[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:58.820]
Anybody.

[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.300]
But anyway, I guess they're doing okay.

[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.660]
And they were like, had a big thing on the news.

[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.780]
And they were going to be adopted or whatever.

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.600]
They were in cruel springs, some hospital up there.

[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.700]
That lady, by the way, I'm always happy to help out.

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.280]
But don't push your luck, okay, lady?

[01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:14.140]
If I were a multi-media there, I would just have a whole show here.

[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:15.280]
And all I would have, I wouldn't have any show.

[01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:15.840]
I'd just be gone.

[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:19.380]
But if I still was here, you know, assuming I was a schmuck.

[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:23.920]
And all I would do is have people called in for abandoned abused animals.

[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:25.900]
And I'd like, we'd raise money every day and I'd write a check.

[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:26.500]
See what I'm saying?

[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.820]
Like that asshole at right wing of schmuck.

[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.260]
What's his name?

[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:30.980]
Winsone's those money.

[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:31.640]
What is his name?

[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:32.360]
Benstein.

[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:33.020]
Benstein.

[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.060]
Oh, I Benstein.

[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:34.960]
You asshole.

[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:36.300]
God, do I despise him?

[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.660]
Talk about an arrogant, ecotistical schmuck.

[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:41.220]
Benstein.

[01:01:41.780 --> 01:01:44.160]
You make me want to, you make me nauseous.

[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.920]
You want to make me get my foreskin back.

[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.160]
That's how much I can't stand you.

[01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.060]
Benstein.

[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:48.880]
You asshole.

[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:50.560]
Here's Miami.

[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:50.860]
Hello.

[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.120]
Hello, Neil.

[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:53.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:54.580]
All right.

[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:55.360]
Can you hear me okay?

[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.520]
I'm in the car with this little earplug hand-free thing in my phone.

[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.340]
Here you good.

[01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.180]
Oh, and if I got two pretty good movies that made me cry at the end of them.

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:04.520]
Okay.

[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.080]
Shashang Redemption.

[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.000]
Okay.

[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.300]
And Gladiator.

[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.120]
Gladiator?

[01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:11.620]
Gladiator with Russell.

[01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:11.980]
You've got to go.

[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.620]
At the very end when he's dead and he sees a salm, he has a, that was pretty nice.

[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:16.560]
And you cried?

[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.700]
I'm not really cried.

[01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:19.520]
Weeping cry.

[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.220]
A little, a little bit of, you tear it up a little bit.

[01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:22.580]
A little bit.

[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.620]
A little choking, choking up action.

[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:24.880]
Yeah, I'll admit it.

[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:25.960]
Okay, thanks a lot, pal.

[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.540]
I, I, I cry very gladiator.

[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:27.720]

[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.960]
Starting at about the middle of it when I realized how to, what I thought it was.

[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:31.140]
I knew it.

[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:32.780]
And then all the way, it rests the way through.

[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:33.060]
Yeah.

[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.420]
Now, who was in that Peter North?

[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:37.740]
Russell Crowe.

[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:38.420]
Gladiator?

[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:39.840]
Yes.

[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:41.720]
He was.

[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.220]
Ron Jeremy.

[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:45.320]
And I said, Ron Jeremy, the middle of my lunch and I'm still here.

[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:45.420]
Oh.

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.180]
I said, I didn't gag.

[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.280]
Didn't gag, didn't choke, didn't, because I'm trying not to think about it.

[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.620]
How about the Randy West?

[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:56.080]
Oh.

[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.280]
Now, what you interrupted me in the middle of a very important thought.

[01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.280]
This guy was saying what?

[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:03.540]
He gave me a few moves.

[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.180]
He saw a strike.

[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:04.680]
He saw a strike.

[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.620]
Did you ever see that?

[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:05.920]
No.

[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.060]
No, sorry Jason.

[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.640]
And by the way, we don't want to see any more pictures of your excrement either.

[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.660]
That was disgusting.

[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:15.820]
It takes a pull towards snapshot of his J in the bowl.

[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.840]
The only thing I would like to see is OJ in the bowl.

[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:20.980]
I pay a lot to see that.

[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:22.740]
Like in pieces, dismembered.

[01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:24.900]
Hey, OJ, we hate you by the way.

[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.660]
KCNA doubts dismember here.

[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:28.460]
No, that member over there.

[01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:29.460]
Here's deer field.

[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:29.720]
Hello.

[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:32.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:33.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.540]
Trick-quick ones for you.

[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.120]
Let me interrupt you.

[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:42.540]
And the good part of it is, unlike almost every other pool, if you have two or three, no problem, because you know, you can have, although we're saying what's your favorite.

[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:43.900]
That's not the figure.

[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.920]
But that's okay.

[01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:47.520]
The first would be terms of endearment.

[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.140]
Oh.

[01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:49.660]
With Shirley McClain?

[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:50.240]
Yes.

[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.660]
I'm trying just thinking about her now, her psychic reading.

[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.100]
And the second for anybody would ever serve in the military, it's the more recent movie.

[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:00.140]
It's with Mel Gibson, we were soldiers.

[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:02.920]
I cry a lot when I see Mel Gibson.

[01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:04.560]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:05.260]
Have a great weekend.

[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:05.820]
Have a good one.

[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:06.900]
We were soldiers.

[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:07.780]
It was heavy.

[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:08.760]
Mel Gibson.

[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.280]
I don't watch Mel Gibson movie.

[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:11.960]
Sometimes he makes my skin crawl.

[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:13.260]
Nevertheless.

[01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:14.280]
I just don't like him.

[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.100]
It was heavy.

[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:15.900]
I like Gene Hackman.

[01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:17.600]
I like Al Pacino.

[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:18.560]
I like Robert De Niro.

[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:22.120]
I like, um, most of the actors and actresses.

[01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:24.600]
I like Karen Black with her crossed eyes.

[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:25.580]
Robert Darni, Geneal.

[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.680]
No, I don't like Robert Darni, Geneal.

[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.100]
Although he, now he was in a good movie.

[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:33.300]
Oh, what was the name of the guy who I can never think of his name?

[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:34.760]
Sex lies in the video tape.

[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:35.540]
What was his name?

[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:36.580]
James Spader.

[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:37.780]
Very good.

[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:39.040]
Oh, let's hear it for George.

[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:40.940]
Wasn't he in that movie?

[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:42.020]
Yeah, he was in him.

[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.300]
It was, uh, that fact.

[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.480]
I mean, that, uh, that good looking young, uh, what was his name?

[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.540]
See, I'll have a set I'm lost.

[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.640]
This is bad for me because when he gets to be this old.

[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.340]
You're mixing your movies.

[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:54.980]
Don't you know who played the villain that movie, James Spader, was in where they were up on the roof?

[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:57.540]
And he was like toasting his girlfriend like a marshmallow.

[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.780]
And he had her tied to that thing.

[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:01.080]
And he was about to see that movie.

[01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:02.220]
That was a good movie.

[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.560]
The evil guy that came back to town in Chicago, where he was, uh, uh, uh, uh,

[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.860]
Well, see the reason I paused is that we're both thinking real hard.

[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:13.640]
Oh, I never saw the movie.

[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.400]
As soon as I tell you who the other guy was and I can't believe I can't think of his name.

[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.400]
I would remember a movie where a girl was being tortured on a roof.

[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.540]
Yeah, I guess you never saw that.

[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.120]
No.

[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:25.460]
What's the name of it, Carlos?

[01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:29.900]
Look up James Spader on the internet.

[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:31.860]
Because how many movies did James Spader made?

[01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:33.700]
A lot too many.

[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:34.120]
Too many.

[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.460]
You don't like James Spader?

[01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.100]
No, he was okay.

[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.500]
He was no Christian Slader.

[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.620]
Oh, no.

[01:05:39.220 --> 01:05:39.220]

[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:39.960]
Slow bird.

[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:40.800]
Slow bird?

[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.220]
He's just looking up the database.

[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.240]
I don't know.

[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.440]
I don't think that's good.

[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.720]
If he's getting cooked on the roof, that kind of like a bird.

[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:52.440]
A kind of just like in the hitcher, like she was like tied between the two troopers.

[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.380]
They're just like, kind of like the same thing.

[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:55.200]
See Thomas Hall.

[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:56.600]
See Thomas Run.

[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.380]
See Thomas.

[01:05:57.620 --> 01:05:58.120]
They could.

[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.200]
I can't believe I can't think of the other dudes name that's in that movie.

[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:09.620]
I mean, it's a such an obvious piano race.

[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:10.380]
It just came to me.

[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:12.120]
See, when you stop, yeah.

[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:13.760]
He plays the bad guy.

[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.380]
That would make you happy.

[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.500]
And in the end, right off the roof, I think, is our recall.

[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:20.600]
Pretty tense.

[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:21.800]
Oh, thanks for rooting for me.

[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:26.060]
You're not going to go see the inner five-end movie or rent that movie.

[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:28.200]
You don't like Game Spader, you can't hate piano, right?

[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:29.820]
Which I'm not that fond of, either.

[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.400]
See, the difference between not being too fond of an actor actress

[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.120]
or having just liking them so much, you won't see the movie like Mel Gibson.

[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:37.640]
Like Leonardo.

[01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:39.660]
Yeah.

[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:41.600]
I mean, he's just ridiculous.

[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:43.660]
You know, he's the, what's the point?

[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:47.140]
That's like, he's like the rascal house of movies.

[01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:48.720]
He's just like, that's how I feel about that.

[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.080]
Or like, Slice the Loan.

[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.400]
Oh, well, that's another category.

[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.440]
Is there enough money in the world to pay us to go see a movie with Slice the Loan?

[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.880]
Well, why don't they make us an author and we'll see.

[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.760]
I mean, you want to know why there's so many dumb people in the world?

[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.220]
Just go see a Slice the Loan movie.

[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:03.700]
You think?

[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:03.800]

[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.560]
I mean, that's it. That's him.

[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:06.580]
You know, Adrian.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:07.920]
That's it. It's all the rest.

[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.960]
He makes OJ look like a great actor.

[01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:15.520]
Well, at least he was in some funny movies.

[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.960]
Naked gun. Wasn't he a naked gun?

[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:17.660]

[01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.000]
And Leslie Nielsen, good Canadian boy, by the way.

[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.020]
I just spit out a little piece of my sandwich.

[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.400]
11 past 11 at 5.60.

[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.440]
And let me tell you if you want to put something good in your post that's good for you.

[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.400]
How about Oliomet?

[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:36.400]
Oliomet is Mediterranean formulas or advanced combinations of pharmaceutical-grade olive oil combined with lots of really good healthy stuff.

[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.440]

That's 1-866-653-6633.

And of course, you can always order their products on their website, oliomedamerica.com.

[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.780]
Start feeling great today with the help of Oliomet.

[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:31.160]
Find a local BCC's 560.

[01:08:31.620 --> 01:08:32.920]
The radio is on your side.

[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:34.800]
Q&A!

[01:08:37.660 --> 01:09:02.500]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:19.320]
I'm a cranky homo foe, not that I mind it but I'm way too old I fantasize about feeling

[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:27.680]
in bed and at rest with feed loads my man friend I'll just make up with Jinner at some day

[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:35.280]
and then ask him to rate my fun, no very no very again

[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:48.380]
though I would not deal with more spools, and I would not be ashamed about a Jinner and more gay union

[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:53.220]
just bold and then stroking away, what's the thing?

[01:09:54.220 --> 01:10:00.700]
boy, baby, kill me, you're not my type, just sound like a nine year old kid

[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:09.660]
only a much old manly guy, you don't know this, that makes me flip my wig

[01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:16.840]
Jinner was a lover of mine gang rakes, I bury my boldest, skinny nose

[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.680]
inside his hip blee rear end today

[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:29.260]
no I would not be a sport home, if I was not the closet of the face

[01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:37.260]
that's why a Jinner and more gay union would make me feel dizzy and gay

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:39.760]
everybody follow my thousand balls

[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:46.820]
Jinner and more gay union would make my sorrel pony ass feel safe

[01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:54.200]
if we had a Jinner and more gay union, then he wouldn't have to get me raped

[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.200]
you asshole!

[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.420]
1118 at 560 WQAM

[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:01.000]
see the reason I couldn't think of it was Jud Hersh

[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.420]
you wanted to lie?

[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.400]
taxi

[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:05.740]
Tony Dazza

[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:08.440]
last name reminds me of Mitchersh

[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.000]
oh, it's a mental block

[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.940]
anyway, there's a movie called Without a Trace

[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.860]
that's a great movie, I mean very depressing and very sad

[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.060]
put that on there, you got it

[01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:20.820]
and what's her name that plays that she's a great actress

[01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:22.380]
that plays the mother of the little kid

[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:25.780]
well, look it up on her, you got it, you already checked that out

[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.380]
and Jud Hersh is in there

[01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:33.760]
and he plays the cop that eventually eventually finds the kid in the end

[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:36.220]
by the way up there in New England somewhere in some little town in Connecticut

[01:11:37.300 --> 01:11:41.280]
and he old broad that's got the kids, he reminds me of Bet's mother on passions

[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.440]
by the way, she's not dead

[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:44.400]
Mrs. Wallace ain't dead

[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.560]
see, I just spoil it for all the passions people

[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.920]
that's okay, they're like a little bit of, they know that anyway

[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.280]
if they killed her off, that would be the end of that show

[01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:53.380]
well, missy!

[01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:55.020]
she's the best, she's absolutely the best

[01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.200]
what's the name of the actress?

[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.180]
Barbara Hershey?

[01:11:58.960 --> 01:11:59.280]
no

[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.140]
Barbara Hershey, are you off here right?

[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:01.680]
somebody said

[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.980]
no, not Barbara Hershey, it's not even close

[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.840]
Yvonne, what, no

[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.900]
Yvonne Eleman?

[01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:07.280]
Yemi?

[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.300]
no, Yemi?

[01:12:08.580 --> 01:12:09.220]
Yemi Yomami?

[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:09.600]
no

[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:11.540]
Jenny McShane?

[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:14.540]
well, what, are you looking for what I'm trying to do?

[01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:15.880]
she's the star of the movie

[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.520]
without a trace

[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:18.420]
versatile, me?

[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:18.840]
no

[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:22.660]
Barbara Billingsley?

[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:26.480]
Barbara Billingsley played June and Hugh Beaumont is Wally

[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.700]
I mean, he's the dead

[01:12:29.100 --> 01:12:30.120]
and Tony Dow

[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.800]
here's one of the systems, sorry to bother you

[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.880]
it's from Michelle, the answer is

[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.620]
1-800-248507 once you want the number for drug concepts

[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:38.200]
what?

[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.200]
Kate Delegant elegant

[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.860]
see what's wrong with you, it's a Kate and elegant

[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:41.660]
man

[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.920]
1-800-248507 once for drug concepts, Michelle

[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:49.620]
1-800-248507 once, 2-48507 once, got it?

[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.420]
they're great, thanks Michelle for asking

[01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.320]
they'll do you a good job

[01:12:55.540 --> 01:12:56.260]
here's one that says

[01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:58.780]
I tear up at the end of movies all the time but some of my favorites are

[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.480]
and this is from Brian Awasian in DC

[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:02.600]
who says he's listening over the internet

[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:04.460]
dead poets society

[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.840]
I cried all Robin Williams movies

[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.540]
wanting to why?

[01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:10.680]
because he's in them

[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.160]
because he's in them

[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.400]
oh, well it's so sad

[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:15.740]
a big daddy

[01:13:15.740 --> 01:13:18.540]
a big pardon?

[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.680]
the epic Sandler movie?

[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.760]
I don't know, I never saw that

[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:22.920]
I don't like Adam Sandler either

[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:23.960]
oh you're like anybody

[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:25.100]
Adam Sandler is a hoot

[01:13:25.100 --> 01:13:27.360]
he's about as funny as having cancer in every toe

[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.220]
thank you

[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:29.920]
oh thank you

[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.120]
Adam Sandler, I mean see that's another thing that makes me like an old fart

[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.220]
and I'm happy I don't want to be cool I don't want to be hit

[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.140]
I don't want to put on an act

[01:13:36.140 --> 01:13:36.960]
I'm an old fart

[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960]
okay but down here I'm still like a teenager

[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.360]
but Adam Sandler it's got not a generate

[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.200]
I think Mike Myers is hysterical

[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:43.800]
he's very funny

[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.740]
of course he is and he's a good dog

[01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.100]
but Adam Sandler is not funny

[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.280]
you know what that movie was sad

[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.540]
he's really sad

[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.420]
that movie big daddy

[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:52.560]
what was it?

[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:53.860]
it was said that they made it into a movie

[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:56.400]
it was a glorification of this assholes

[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.520]
abhorrent anti social behavior

[01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:58.900]
you know

[01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:00.540]
homing vading assaulting people

[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:02.840]
and making him a hero out of it because of it

[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:03.880]
that's what that movie was

[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:04.720]
crimson tide

[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:05.600]
huh?

[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:10.000]
that's what it says here on this list

[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.380]
okay from Brian and Washington

[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.660]
crimson tide

[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:13.580]
is that science fiction?

[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:14.420]
I don't know

[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.820]
put it down there okay?

[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.620]
Elizabeth and a few others

[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.480]
and then he says and gives us a lot of the where Brian's coming from

[01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:22.000]
here's an idea for a poll

[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.100]
your favorite male porn star

[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:26.660]
see Brian I hate to break the news to you

[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:28.620]
but other than you we have like maybe four or five fags

[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:29.720]
listen to the show that's number one

[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:32.660]
and number two as far as the heterosexual male population

[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.640]
which is the overwhelming majority of this audience

[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:36.600]
I don't think most straight guys

[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.520]
care about who the guys are in a porn movie

[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:39.060]
at all

[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:39.840]
right

[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.160]
good call

[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:41.860]
huh?

[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.480]
we don't even want them in there

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:46.440]
as if we had a favorite

[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:47.220]
oh no that's right

[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:49.500]
most guys would prefer there wouldn't be nothing but lesbian scenes

[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.220]
but you know

[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.720]
the guys would be to just gratuitously

[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.300]
for like a little

[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:52.900]
squirt squirt

[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:53.680]
or something else

[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.760]
to keep the uh... babes all worked out

[01:14:58.100 --> 01:15:00.160]
and speaking of that Bob the builder says

[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.080]
Debbie does Dallas made me cry

[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.120]
because I had a cast in my hand the time I saw it

[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:07.260]
he only has one hand

[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.200]
Debbie does down he's not ambidextrous

[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:11.820]
Debbie does Dallas was a great porn movie

[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.920]
with every family woods

[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.060]
but see now there's a man

[01:15:15.060 --> 01:15:17.140]
you never saw Debbie does that not ever saw

[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.320]
if you don't think you thought

[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.880]
you thought that Brittany was caught okay

[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:21.980]
bambi woods

[01:15:21.980 --> 01:15:23.200]
ain't far in her behind

[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:24.420]
okay she's right there

[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:26.920]
now it's old but I bet you can still find it

[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:27.540]
I'm sure

[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.080]
Debbie does Dallas

[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.320]
there's a lot of time

[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:30.740]
I know these

[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.020]
yeah maybe on a real

[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:34.480]
trying to think of

[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:36.160]
well some wild the usual cast of mister

[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:38.240]
in fact they see the problem with a male porn stars

[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.320]
in those straight movies is that

[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.760]
it's the same

[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:41.860]
eight people

[01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.140]
but they're like nasty

[01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.220]
prison escapies

[01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:45.620]
with the jailhouse tats

[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.740]
and the greasy hair

[01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:48.120]
no longer go there

[01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.340]
there were maybe a couple of guys

[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:49.880]
that looked human

[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:50.720]
back when Debbie Ford

[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.280]
Tom Barron decided to become a freak

[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.040]
and wanted to be like

[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.200]
John Holmes Part 2

[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:54.800]
huh?

[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:55.640]
I don't remember that

[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.400]
Tom Barron

[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.160]
I don't remember any attractive male

[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.120]
it's not true

[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:01.960]

[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.380]
not true

[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.880]
not true

[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.300]
big nose hairy reams

[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:05.580]
not true

[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.340]
uh... hairy reams

[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.280]
was in like one movie

[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.080]
was in deep throat

[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:10.340]
yeah that's the one I saw

[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.420]
and that wasn't his name

[01:16:11.420 --> 01:16:12.740]
that was just an act

[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.340]
if hairy reams does bambi

[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:15.780]
well whatever

[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:16.960]
yes she would

[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:18.600]
uh...

[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.040]
five six seven

[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:20.700]
oh five sixty

[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:21.820]
we're building the list on here

[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:23.420]
of course the very good put rainman on it

[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.080]
I could vote

[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:25.480]
I don't want to get pushy

[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.900]
here but and he has no way of knowing that

[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.980]
because you haven't fact in the rest of the list yet

[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:31.860]
see i'm looking at this way since this is the poll for the weekend

[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:33.440]
there's no emergency on here

[01:16:33.440 --> 01:16:33.800]
and of course

[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.620]
and our carlis has been after leave early

[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:36.680]
because he got to go to the bank

[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.820]
and they give him a bunch of pennies

[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.900]
and try to cover that bad check

[01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:39.280]
I mean

[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.100]
and now what time you leave him

[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:42.900]
by noon

[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.960]
about ten minutes from now

[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:45.480]
any minute

[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:47.480]
so this is going to

[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:48.300]

[01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.580]
gonna fall in your arms

[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:51.180]
oh there he goes

[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.640]
what's a big deal okay

[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.900]
it's a talk for us to cover it

[01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:57.860]
my vote for the status movies are ET

[01:16:57.860 --> 01:16:59.160]
we had bad terms of a German

[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.720]
so that we mentioned without a trace

[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.580]
with Kate and elegant

[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.340]
there's a moo

[01:17:02.340 --> 01:17:02.900]
is there a

[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.460]
some show on tv now

[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.140]
coupled out of trace

[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:06.580]
yeah that's got nothing to do with that movie

[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:07.540]
they just call the name

[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:10.180]
are you seeing that right

[01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:11.100]
yeah

[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:12.720]
and a little kid disappears

[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.120]
and then they think that the fact

[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:16.260]
i mean that the worker

[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:17.240]
whatever he was

[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.280]
the handyman did it

[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:19.160]
because he was gay

[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.080]
and they found the soil

[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080]
bloody panties

[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.600]
and he turns out he cut his hand

[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.580]
in the sink or whatever

[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:25.320]
kind of like oj

[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.100]
you know i haven't seen everybody

[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.160]
they cut their hand in the sink

[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.200]
right

[01:17:29.660 --> 01:17:30.680]
and then coming to find out

[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.780]
that old bag had kidnapped that little kid

[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.500]
and at the end of the movie

[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.340]
she's coming home

[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:36.080]
with her gross reason

[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.020]
or arm in that dog

[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.360]
i think it was a golden retriever

[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:40.000]
wasn't that the dog

[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:41.680]
who played the dog

[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.020]
by the way

[01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:42.660]

[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.060]

and tracian kindel says

[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.180]
the status part is actually

[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:53.740]

[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.280]

[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:18.580]
on this guy before

[01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:19.780]
earlier

[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.200]
a roman catholic priest

[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:21.980]
played a gildi today

[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.480]
to sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy

[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:23.960]
in 1982

[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:25.040]
was given a suspended

[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.380]
a 20-year prison term

[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.540]
suspended a sentence

[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:29.340]
prince

[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.180]
of George County

[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:31.180]
circuit judge told the Reverend

[01:18:31.180 --> 01:18:32.200]
John P. Blankenship

[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.060]
that if he misbehaves

[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:33.620]
during that period

[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.120]
he would impose the entire 20 years

[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:35.340]
sentence

[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.060]
the maximum allow

[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:36.840]
for the four

[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:37.960]
courts

[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.580]
the prosecution said

[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:41.460]
the crimes took place

[01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:42.260]
between June 82

[01:18:42.260 --> 01:18:43.120]
November 82

[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.260]
when the victim has mother

[01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:45.620]
went to the church of the sacred part

[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:46.020]
a heart

[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:47.140]
in prince cow

[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:47.760]
George County

[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:48.860]
to do housekeeping chores

[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:50.580]
the attacks occurred when the boy was left

[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:51.600]
in black and jim's care

[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.600]

[01:18:54.600 --> 01:18:55.360]

[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:55.940]

[01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:58.040]
from the Vatican

[01:18:58.040 --> 01:18:59.580]
that they get one freebie anyway don't they

[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:02.500]
as long as it's not passionate

[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:03.380]
here's one that says

[01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:04.760]
I was mistaken about today's survey

[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.500]
never saw my husband

[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.800]
cried during stepmom

[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:07.580]
and would never admit it

[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:08.800]
thanks to tracing cam

[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:09.720]

[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.640]
drowning her own tears

[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640]
like Allison Wunderland

[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:14.260]

[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:48.560]
they train us to believe

[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.540]
and anyone who says that

[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.820]
obviously

[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.820]

with our hand in the sand

[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.140]
and lightly follow

[01:23:11.140 --> 01:23:12.360]
the powers that

[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:12.780]
be

[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.940]
apathetic

[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:19.120]
from news on a 65-inch

[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:19.860]
screen

[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:21.440]

[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.020]

everything's

[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:23.920]
okay

[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:28.020]
in the goddamn USA

[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:32.600]
got the majority

[01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:33.660]
later in a distinguished

[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:34.540]

senator fine gold

[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:37.040]
peep

[01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:37.900]
26th

[01:23:37.900 --> 01:23:38.160]
till noon

[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.200]
I just that's as much as

[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:39.680]
I can take

[01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:40.940]
I'd have the president

[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:41.720]
as a guest on our show

[01:23:41.720 --> 01:23:42.400]
a couple of minutes

[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:43.360]
a couple of seconds

[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.280]
how about the champ

[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:44.920]
with rich rotor

[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:47.360]
and I was telling Jeff Cohen

[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:47.940]
as much as

[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:48.760]
of course he don't care

[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:50.100]
but I actually saw rich

[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:50.700]
rotor on some

[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:51.360]
word I was channel

[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.000]
surf in the other day

[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:52.620]
in fact maybe it was

[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:52.860]
yesterday

[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.640]
I don't know what it was

[01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:55.600]
in a show, a movie

[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:55.860]
or what

[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.100]
and he actually looked

[01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:57.840]
almost human

[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.440]
rich rotor

[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:01.960]
just turned 62

[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.420]
but it looked too bad

[01:24:04.940 --> 01:24:05.780]
because in the past

[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.440]
I always found him

[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:07.500]
extraordinarily anxious

[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.880]
and unsettled wasn't he

[01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:09.360]
in that movie

[01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:10.640]
with the Brad Pitt

[01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:11.600]
yes

[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.400]
he played his brother

[01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:13.300]
the other side of the

[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:14.120]
tracks or whatever that movie

[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:14.660]
was that set

[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:15.680]
with that name of the movie

[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:16.300]
something like that

[01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.060]
other side of the tracks

[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:18.960]
how do you like that

[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:19.740]
then their tracks

[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:20.640]
now when we go back

[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:21.540]
to the pool the other day

[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:22.440]
about the hottest person

[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.140]
and who I'm going to tell you

[01:24:23.140 --> 01:24:24.200]
Brad Pitt in that movie

[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.300]
see in that movie

[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.180]
that's a long time ago

[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:26.780]
you just like the

[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.660]
underwear scene

[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:28.360]
yeah

[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.200]
of course

[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:31.440]
listen if it would have been

[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.600]
like a fat rich

[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.180]
in his underwriter

[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:34.060]
I think I would enjoy it

[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:34.740]
a lot of people

[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.420]
that could have been people

[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:35.980]
in their underwear

[01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:36.820]
that's not the point

[01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:38.240]
in their fruit of the loom

[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.120]
anyway we're doing

[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.040]
your favorite

[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:42.940]
how are we wording it

[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.580]
what's your favorite

[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:44.600]
movie that made Ben cry

[01:24:44.600 --> 01:24:45.400]
but they wanted to admit it

[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.180]
that's a very good way

[01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:46.400]
of wording

[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:47.340]
who did that did you do that

[01:24:47.340 --> 01:24:47.800]
or Eric

[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:48.940]
Carlos

[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.000]
Carlos said he done it

[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.420]
Eric says on the other hand

[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:54.720]
ordinary people

[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:56.680]
did we already do that

[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.560]
with Mary Tyler Moore

[01:24:58.560 --> 01:24:59.780]
that one

[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.460]
yeah

[01:25:00.460 --> 01:25:02.220]
I don't know I didn't see it

[01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:03.920]
I cried that I spent money

[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.060]
to go watch it

[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.040]
you know what I'm saying

[01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:06.540]
you're a good movie

[01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:08.220]
you spent money

[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:10.400]
with Mary Tyler's more

[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.680]
holy crap man

[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.240]
you're like not too sharply

[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:15.280]
since all the pressures

[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.200]
are getting to you

[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:16.780]
you know what I'm saying

[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.740]
you asshole

[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:19.520]
god what a waste

[01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.440]
of a budget

[01:25:20.440 --> 01:25:21.220]
that not be proud

[01:25:21.220 --> 01:25:21.980]
with Robbie Benson

[01:25:22.460 --> 01:25:22.820]
huh

[01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:24.020]
speaking of people

[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.280]
I used to look really, really good

[01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:26.500]
what was that movie one on one

[01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.660]
where you play the basketball player

[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:28.560]
I guess that one

[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.040]
we told the coach

[01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:29.860]
to stick it up his ass

[01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:30.620]
with the red hot poker

[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.200]
I'm like that

I think we do know is that Geldie has got a much larger penis than Brian Craig because the sports people around here have to shower together at the end of the day every day.

[01:38:15.940 --> 01:38:22.240]
Do you have seen Geldies too? No, only Brian's. I checked with everybody else around here. They went like this.

[01:38:23.140 --> 01:38:26.800]
They went like this. Arms extended wide. Here is Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:35.660]
How are you guys doing? Okay. Good. I got two of the off time movies. I would consider definitely God for climate movies.

[01:38:35.660 --> 01:39:05.640]
Okay. Oh yeah. What's the other one? I don't know. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back.

[01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:35.620]
He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back.

[01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:05.560]
He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back. He'll call back.

[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:09.700]
who is in there with a mail carrier is a little bit agitated by the helicopters. Do you

[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:14.880]
think that the police might ask the TV choppers to back off?

[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.120]
I tell you what, they better because they look how close they are. The picture you can

[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:22.980]
even see his armpits before the person is obviously made threats against the helicopter.

[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.360]
But I can see that happening. Definitely. Or at least asking us to stand back.

[01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.600]
All new people expecting your social security checks in that one area, by the way.

[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:38.560]
Good luck to you. Is the police helicopter in relation to the view? They take a little

[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.520]
more liberties with altitude. They take a lot more liberties. I think I might be able to

[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:46.220]
get a shot of it here. You know something Steve Wolford is like a real

[01:40:46.220 --> 01:40:48.660]
newsman. I want to say that over there. Channel 4 where they don't have too many

[01:40:48.660 --> 01:40:51.700]
news people. They really, but Steve Wolford I like a lot. And who's the other one

[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:54.960]
that brought it on there? I can never think of a name in not Angel Array. That's

[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:58.340]
not what Steve Wolford on Channel 4 news. You told me the other day. You would just

[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:03.440]
tell me the other day who it was. I forgot. Damn it. She's good. Okay. Can you give us an

[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.560]
idea? Where is that? Her name is not Elliot Rodriguez. Make so many turns and

[01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:11.740]
twists and moves. Where are we? Southbound a 22nd Avenue coming up on the Palm

[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:16.820]
Meadow. Oh, coming up in the Palm Meadow. There are 22nd Avenue. I hope that when

[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:23.300]
these male trucks go out. And as we said, the police ground units have ended

[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:28.640]
their part of the chase. So we understand that there are no longer police on the

[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:33.940]
ground chasing this male truck. Pull it over you idiot. You asshole. We believe

[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:40.280]
a hostage situation, a male carrier and find that truck driving the truck and

[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:45.240]
another person in there possibly holding that person hostage. Maybe he found

[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.400]
his check from Edmund Mann and it came up to find out there was already a dead

[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.300]
line two days ago. The police helicopter continues to follow this truck as it

[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:56.980]
makes its way Southbound 22nd Avenue. As you said, Tony, approach to the

[01:41:56.980 --> 01:42:01.140]
Palm Meadow. Are they still ahead of the truck? Oh, there's pressure on. Just went

[01:42:01.140 --> 01:42:06.100]
underneath the Palm Meadow. Are the police still ahead of the truck trying to

[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:12.140]
hold off traffic? No, they are hanging way back. They're about maybe

[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:16.800]
eight and a half miles back. They are still following the truck. We got a male

[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:23.440]
truck chasing South-aid. Right up on it like they were before. Is this in

[01:42:23.440 --> 01:42:28.000]
South-aid? How can it be in South-aid? No, it's in North like I said. If the person

[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.140]
in that male truck got away to the truck, maybe wants to go see a bus.

[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.640]
We can get on the Palm Meadow. A cell phone or something like that other than just

[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:39.620]
yelling out the window which that person has apparently done a couple of times.

[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:43.680]
Yeah, all the threats have been made at people standing around. You saw earlier,

[01:42:43.900 --> 01:42:48.520]
you saw almost a stop but there's a group of people. Apparently they have

[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:51.660]
been pulling in the left hand lane now. The threat he's just made for the police.

[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:55.880]
There's a stoplight and going to stop. I don't think we know anything.

[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:02.840]
I decided to go back at the right hand lane. I believe that was the first time we

[01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:05.140]
seen him actually. There's a group of people on the other side.

[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:08.560]
You see some kids running. I don't know what's...

[01:43:08.560 --> 01:43:13.180]
They jumped out of the truck. I don't know if there's been a shot fired or anything.

[01:43:13.540 --> 01:43:17.660]
Maybe he was being held hostage, you think? Yeah. What street is this on?

[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:19.100]
He's still on the bus. He's still on the bus.

[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:20.060]
He's still on the bus. He's still on the bus. He's still on the bus.

[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:26.200]
I think you're wrong. I think the kid was behind the fence. Do you think the kid jumped

[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.900]
over the fence? No. They were looking.

[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:36.780]
They were goose-nakers. You could almost make out the croak file of somebody

[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.860]
leaning over some of those... The guy rode in the back of the van.

[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:43.220]
The male containers. Yeah, suppose this guys aren't walking in.

[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:45.420]
They were on a residential area. I was just going to say that.

[01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:48.020]
They were going to start it off in a neighborhood

[01:43:48.780 --> 01:43:50.680]
went to one of the main highways.

[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:53.200]
Not coming to a stop here. I can't remember what's in the back of the restaurant.

[01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.300]
Park on the other side of that truck. Stopping.

[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:57.920]
The truck stopped. Maybe he's going to re-deliver the mail there.

[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:02.500]
I'll be like, for a second though, as he puts up speed and this has been as we've been following.

[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:05.200]
It has been a low-speed chase. Now wait a minute.

[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:07.840]
He's stopping to pop this on dude. What else that all about?

[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:10.640]
He's having a conversation. He's coming back.

[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.920]
My mind and local.

[01:44:15.420 --> 01:44:17.180]
I hear sports radio 560.

[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.840]
You ain't. You ain't.

[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.820]
Why the hell you bastard?

[01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:34.600]
No startles hiding. A lot more than guns.

[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:37.500]
They say they're weapons.

[01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:39.800]
A vast destruction.

[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:46.000]
I say they say a couple megatons.

[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:47.500]
Bound me around.

[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.420]
In the Gulf War, let him off the world.

[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:03.180]
I think it's time to give his butter wool.

[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:10.700]
So it's time to load those B-wons up on their own.

[01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:16.440]
You are here on.

[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.500]
Till there's nothing left to see.

[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:22.240]
I'm here on.

[01:45:23.940 --> 01:45:26.480]
Till Saturday 6 feet deep.

[01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:28.040]
I'm here on.

[01:45:30.140 --> 01:45:32.040]
Blow up the creed.

[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.600]
Blow up the creed.

[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:41.220]
And they say he's got some guns.

[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.660]
And he ever goes to heaven.

[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:46.420]
And he's not lovin' up all scars.

[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.580]
If we land the creed.

[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.980]
We've blown him up.

[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:58.020]
I'm on.

[01:45:59.780 --> 01:46:00.320]
I'm on.

[01:46:00.320 --> 01:46:00.720]
I'm here on.

[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.500]
I'm here on.

[01:46:09.500 --> 01:46:11.140]
I'm here on.

[01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:12.340]
I'm here on.

[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.100]
I'm on.

[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:15.100]

[01:46:15.100 --> 01:46:15.540]
I'm here on.

[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:15.540]

[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:16.980]
I'm here on.

[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:18.080]
I'm here on.

[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:19.900]
Okay, here's a very emotional fact.

[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.520]
By the way, to pull this up, what's your favorite movie that made men cry?

[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:25.320]
But wanted to be a Bryan Song 18.

[01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.620]
I was gonna appropriate on a sports station like QAM.

[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:29.360]
It would be a sports movie.

[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:31.080]
I know I wasn't very good movie, by the way.

[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:32.460]
And who's in that?

[01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:33.680]
James Cahn.

[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:34.200]
James Cahn.

[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:34.980]
Very good.

[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:36.620]
And who played G.L. Sears?

[01:46:38.140 --> 01:46:38.720]
I forgot.

[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:39.640]
I don't remember either.

[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.720]
And who played Bryan Piccolo?

[01:46:40.960 --> 01:46:41.360]
I don't remember.

[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:43.220]
That was a, what's his name?

[01:46:43.520 --> 01:46:43.680]
James Cahn.

[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:45.940]
Good movie, Bryan Song 18.

[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:48.300]
I'm a man who never cries in movies 17.

[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:50.600]
Okay, we have to take your word.

[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:52.280]
I mean, you know, if you want to be much old man,

[01:46:52.940 --> 01:46:54.380]
if you want to put on a good act for us,

[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:55.780]
you've never ever cried in a movie,

[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.840]
ever brought a tear to your eye.

[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:57.920]
Have you got a little choked up?

[01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:58.740]
A little gale?

[01:46:59.200 --> 01:46:59.360]
Huh?

[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:01.140]
You buy it?

[01:47:01.340 --> 01:47:02.380]
Boca Bryan recommended one.

[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:03.260]
So I wrote it down.

[01:47:03.320 --> 01:47:03.540]
Okay.

[01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:04.940]
The amazing colossal man.

[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:09.400]
His own son had to pull the switch.

[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:11.480]
Pull wasn't a tragic.

[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.260]
The switch that turned him off.

[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.500]
That turned his life off.

[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:15.500]
But that sounds like guiding light.

[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:16.720]
Like Riva and what's his name?

[01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:17.060]
Richard.

[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:18.120]
Well, that's right.

[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:18.900]
You don't watch that either.

[01:47:19.020 --> 01:47:19.700]
And neither do I anymore.

[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:23.160]
Shindler's list 10, ET10, all the LR9.

[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.000]
Oh, gee, we don't have to put all the LR down.

[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:26.920]
It's a wonderful life five.

[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:29.840]
Makes me want to put James Stewart down,

[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:30.680]
but I guess it's too late.

[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:32.580]
Feel the dreams for Rudy Ford,

[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.460]
dead, uh, poet society for,

[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.240]
Shawshank for, Rainman for.

[01:47:37.040 --> 01:47:38.180]
Well, I feel good about that.

[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:38.780]
Rainman's got four.

[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:39.280]
That was my vote.

[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:40.520]
My dog's skip three.

[01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.180]
How about my dog, Tiny?

[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:43.820]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:45.720]
See, I'm not going to sound insensitive because maybe,

[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.120]
I mean, you know, just that time, Tiny.

[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:49.780]
Mask three.

[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:50.760]
Love story, a pair.

[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.580]
I'm a woman who never cries in movies too.

[01:47:53.040 --> 01:47:53.400]
Wow.

[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:55.100]
Philly D Williams.

[01:47:57.020 --> 01:47:58.240]
Played the Gale Sergat.

[01:47:58.440 --> 01:47:58.640]
Thank you.

[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:00.780]
I've done say the other guy, Gale Sergat.

[01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:01.800]
Where do I know?

[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:02.920]
Walter Peyton.

[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:04.160]
The only reason I know Brian,

[01:48:04.340 --> 01:48:04.780]
Jim McLeod, man,

[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:06.020]
who used to live right by his park.

[01:48:06.340 --> 01:48:07.420]
Brian Piccolo Park?

[01:48:08.920 --> 01:48:10.720]
Uh, did I say love story, a pair?

[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.140]
Well, all these others either have two or one.

[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:13.020]
Fatsos got one.

[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:13.980]
And I don't get it.

[01:48:14.500 --> 01:48:15.720]
I don't understand why.

[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.560]
I mean, I, I guess,

[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:20.740]
if you're as fat and frustrated as he was, you know,

[01:48:21.300 --> 01:48:23.120]
didn't it have a happy ending though all together?

[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:26.260]
Yeah, I sure he got married and they had all of those kids.

[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:27.220]
And it showed pictures.

[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:27.860]
He was slimmer.

[01:48:27.860 --> 01:48:28.520]
He was fatter.

[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:30.160]
But in the meantime, life went on, you know,

[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:31.120]
you wake the youngy.

[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:31.980]
Yeah, that was the problem.

[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:33.220]
He was great.

[01:48:33.380 --> 01:48:36.340]
Any pull we take on under,

[01:48:36.460 --> 01:48:39.280]
that would be a good pull underrated actors or actresses

[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:40.240]
and bankrupt.

[01:48:40.620 --> 01:48:40.880]
Right.

[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:41.980]
She's just great.

[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.100]
And young people, that she wrote that?

[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:45.820]
No, he told me that before.

[01:48:45.880 --> 01:48:46.560]
I think directed it.

[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.900]
I'm not sure, but she at least wrote that.

[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:48.920]
She's great.

[01:48:49.060 --> 01:48:49.620]
She is great.

[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:50.780]
Mary Demelle Brooks.

[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:51.300]
Right.

[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.780]
So can you, can you, how do you like to be a flyman in that house?

[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:54.640]
But I don't know.

[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:54.980]
Like that.

[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:56.340]
Even worse than Boka Brian's house.

[01:48:57.380 --> 01:49:00.320]
Well, here's the facts from Harris Kay and Coral Springs who says,

[01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:02.980]
for all you peacen eggs who don't believe Al-Qaeda and Saddam

[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:03.620]
are in bed together.

[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:06.460]
I probably the same ones who think the mob has nothing to do with gambling.

[01:49:07.300 --> 01:49:07.620]
Right.

[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:08.840]
It's an amp.

[01:49:09.660 --> 01:49:10.240]
It's an amp.

[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:12.600]
Saddam has brainwashed all your many minds

[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:14.200]
in making him look like some kind of a saint.

[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.660]
Have we ever said he's a saint?

[01:49:15.740 --> 01:49:15.880]
No.

[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:16.600]
No.

[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.820]
Have we ever said we want to keep him

[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:18.200]
alive?

[01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:18.400]
No.

[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:20.400]
Have we ever said he's anything but a scumbag

[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.680]
and a murdering and a piece of crap?

[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:21.920]
No.

[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:22.500]
Anyway.

[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:27.100]
And if all you would stop bitching for just a minute and use your weak minds

[01:49:27.100 --> 01:49:28.900]
and realize the world without American interference

[01:49:28.900 --> 01:49:31.880]
would consist of North Korea attacking South Korea in Japan,

[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:33.380]
China taking over Taiwan,

[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:35.240]
Indian Pakistan going nuclear.

[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:37.660]
Oh, Indian Pakistan going nuclear.

[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.200]
I thought they'd go on nuclear.

[01:49:39.800 --> 01:49:40.120]
I thought they'd go on nuclear.

[01:49:40.120 --> 01:49:41.580]
Iraq blitzing through the Middle East, etc.

[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:42.660]
We should have.

[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.860]
And as far as Iraq blitzing through the Middle East,

[01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:45.800]
I hate to break the news to you,

[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:47.680]
but Israel has these things called nuclear weapons.

[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.900]
We say haven't used so far.

[01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:51.140]

[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.220]
Thus far.

[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:54.900]
As yet.

[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:55.980]
As Moa was saying one,

[01:49:56.100 --> 01:49:57.140]
I'd say there have been any complaints

[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:58.580]
by the University of Miami as yet.

[01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.240]
We should all get on our knees and pray

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:03.480]
that every day that France does not ever replace the USA

[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:04.420]
as a world superpower

[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:06.080]
for the world would turn to crap.

[01:50:06.860 --> 01:50:06.860]

[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.820]
Crap is what he's trying to say.

[01:50:09.060 --> 01:50:10.860]
Have we defended France on this program today?

[01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:11.240]
No.

[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:12.400]
Oh, that's right.

[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:13.060]
I'm doing this fast.

[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:13.760]
It makes sense.

[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.520]
He's not getting close.

[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:17.760]
I'm just wondering what the conversation is.

[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.540]
You think I just can't help it?

[01:50:20.620 --> 01:50:20.780]
Wonder.

[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.480]
So this mailman is being hijacked,

[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:23.320]
which is what I thought.

[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.780]
That was my first and there were shots fired.

[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.020]
He's got somebody with a gun.

[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320]
And I always stopped at some residence there in Opalaka.

[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.860]
And he's talking to some lady who's standing

[01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.100]
by the fence in Chattanoon.

[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:32.220]
Everybody stops talking to him.

[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:33.060]
Maybe he wants to.

[01:50:33.060 --> 01:50:34.620]
Maybe he wants a grilled cheese sandwich.

[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.140]
I don't know.

[01:50:35.200 --> 01:50:37.380]
Maybe he heard the show and he got the Jones of her grilled cheese.

[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:39.980]
And talk to someone in one of those police units.

[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.480]
Yeah, earlier.

[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:41.740]
Yeah.

[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.080]
Tony, give us an idea.

[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:44.500]
And the best part of his, he stopped to make

[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:45.100]
a couple of mails.

[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:45.900]
We'll be right along the way.

[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.600]
Still around the area of 27th Avenue

[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.360]
in about 150 first.

[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:51.620]
They just keep going in circles.

[01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:52.540]
Let's go over there.

[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.240]
I don't know.

[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:53.920]
Here's all that.

[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:54.900]
Not for street.

[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.120]
Not sure the Avenue bottom.

[01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.420]
Yeah, audience out there.

[01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.420]
Listen, don't be zipping over in that area

[01:51:00.420 --> 01:51:01.340]
so it can like rubber neck.

[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:02.940]
OK, this is like we don't know the guy.

[01:51:03.100 --> 01:51:05.580]
The mail guy, the letter carrier inside the vehicle,

[01:51:05.700 --> 01:51:07.460]
is obviously his life is in jeopardy.

[01:51:07.460 --> 01:51:08.840]
Got an armed wacko in the thing.

[01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:10.280]
And he's been hijacked.

[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:12.380]
What, you know, he's been mail jacked.

[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:15.100]
But the situation is with the police units there

[01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:16.000]
that are in pursuit.

[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:17.020]
They're way off now.

[01:51:17.260 --> 01:51:18.880]
They, they are in the area.

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:23.500]
They're probably setting up grids

[01:51:23.500 --> 01:51:25.720]
or trying to figure out where this person is.

[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:26.460]
He's a grits.

[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.320]
And they strip down or something to that.

[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.600]
In fact, they're definitely keeping an eye on the unit.

[01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:31.600]
They just made a U-way there.

[01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:32.220]
There's some more buddies.

[01:51:32.580 --> 01:51:33.760]
I know some more guys on the corner.

[01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:35.680]
Like, I'm telling you what.

[01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:37.020]
Yeah, if I was in my get-

[01:51:37.020 --> 01:51:38.700]
Yeah, they're getting out of the real fast.

[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.800]
Those kids are getting out of their real pronto.

[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.960]
Anyway, so anyway, and it goes on to say,

[01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:45.100]
it's only a matter of time before the world will thank America

[01:51:45.100 --> 01:51:47.040]
for pursuing freedom all over the world.

[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:48.160]
Right.

[01:51:48.620 --> 01:51:49.560]
Okay, whatever you say, sir,

[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:50.980]
just keep twisting our words

[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:52.900]
and keep manipulating back again and again.

[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:55.440]
So that's pretty soon we can take over the whole world.

[01:51:55.560 --> 01:51:56.720]
We can have like the British Empire.

[01:51:56.880 --> 01:51:57.520]
That worked out real well.

[01:51:57.540 --> 01:51:58.580]
Everybody can be free.

[01:51:58.720 --> 01:51:59.180]
Like we are here.

[01:51:59.260 --> 01:51:59.800]
Right, like the beast.

[01:51:59.900 --> 01:52:01.140]
Though the beast just came in to get weighed.

[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:03.060]
All right, let's do the break.

[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:04.500]
And after the break, we'll have the exciting news

[01:52:04.500 --> 01:52:06.360]
of just how much more weight the beast has lost.

[01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:07.620]
I don't want to put any pressure on him,

[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:09.440]
but it better be a real significant amount.

[01:52:11.320 --> 01:52:12.840]
It better be a real good amount

[01:52:12.840 --> 01:52:14.000]
or might lose the account.

[01:52:14.240 --> 01:52:14.480]
Okay.

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:17.640]
Follow him, Sam.

[01:52:18.440 --> 01:52:20.540]
It better be a big fat amount

[01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.660]
or you're going to blow the account.

[01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.040]
And you know what they're going to say to him?

[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:27.800]
If he hasn't lost a lot more weight,

[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.520]
at least at least five pounds.

[01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:31.500]
I don't want to put too much pressure.

[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:33.180]
At least five pounds since last week,

[01:52:33.180 --> 01:52:33.760]
they're going to say,

[01:52:33.860 --> 01:52:34.500]
you asshole.

[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.880]
10 past noon at 560 WQM.

[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:38.640]
It's big enough food.

[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:39.940]
Close your ears, beast.

[01:52:39.940 --> 01:52:40.540]
Don't listen to his.

[01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:41.640]
Flores is really, really good.

[01:52:41.740 --> 01:52:43.040]
Good thing he wasn't here that Tuesday when

[01:52:43.040 --> 01:52:44.140]
he brought us the food here in the studio.

[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:44.800]
It was sensational.

[01:52:45.300 --> 01:52:46.880]
He brought us back to those old and days at IOD

[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:48.540]
when we used to be on the 79th Street Causeway.

[01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:50.440]
We're going to even his head loss some weight.

[01:52:50.880 --> 01:52:51.840]
He looks down right.

[01:52:53.140 --> 01:52:54.560]
Well, not right fat.

[01:52:55.660 --> 01:52:56.300]
He does.

[01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:58.820]
But not his head isn't as fat as it was last.

[01:52:58.820 --> 01:52:59.980]
We've been out stuck in the door.

[01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:01.040]
Oh, he grew some hair.

[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:02.560]
Grusom is the obvious word.

[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:04.600]
Anyway, freshly made pizza dough

[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:05.980]
and fresh baked garlic rolls at Flores

[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:06.960]
that they can write through every day.

[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:07.760]
I write on the spot.

[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:09.120]
The portions are gigantic

[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.560]
and they use more cheese and meats

[01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.520]
on their pies than anybody in town.

[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.020]
Boy, you think that George's got cheese.

[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:15.860]
George and Miguel thought the food was great too

[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:17.000]
and especially when they like the price.

[01:53:17.420 --> 01:53:18.940]
You'll be fighting for that last slice of pizza

[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:20.260]
if it's from, if it's from Flores.

[01:53:20.520 --> 01:53:21.520]
But don't take my word for it.

[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.180]
Find out for yourself.

[01:53:22.340 --> 01:53:24.460]
Go to 731 Northe 79th Street.

[01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:25.140]

[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:39.780]

[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.920]

[01:54:14.820 --> 01:54:15.280]
Do you know?

[01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:18.280]
I am mohar with the day I regret it.

[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.140]
And I mentioned all of my old face on

[01:54:21.140 --> 01:54:22.320]
who with red is purple.

[01:54:22.780 --> 01:54:24.980]
They I don't know why they hate me.

[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:26.820]
Oh, why they always rape me?

[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:28.860]
It must be because that's where.

[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:29.840]
But when red is purple.

[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:32.660]
They on my arm like a rimic.

[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:33.480]
Now we map a lot.

[01:54:33.640 --> 01:54:33.960]
A lot.

[01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:35.320]
I got beans on my nose.

[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.880]
Nobody knows that under my clothes.

[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:37.920]
I wear pinty hos.

[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:41.680]
But that don't mean that I'm gay. If you think my arms are bad you ought to see my legs

[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.760]
I might as well keep on smoothing shade to show a little glazed the next time I'm raping it

[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.280]
I can vote to a surgeon but that gives me the shivers. I wouldn't want to walk out looking like Joan Rivers

[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:56.960]
Where am I? I'm Ryan the beast the fat little freak. I did him a favor now again afford any

[01:54:56.960 --> 01:55:02.400]
The reason I dismissed that snake and fat bastard is because he wouldn't shut up and he can't play conest

[01:55:03.500 --> 01:55:07.300]
I saw the dog over there nobody talks when I ran. I ran ten you talk

[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:13.640]
Like look at me I'm hit I ain't no square. I'm a thing done daddy man. I'm really dead

[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:01.780]
Almost as much as when he sees Michigan get their ass beat

See I can't I cannot even imagine a woman who never would cry unless they just haven't seen many movies, you know

[01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:51.160]
Or maybe the really hard bitten like Janet

[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.820]
Untamed heart never heard of it with christian slater George for some reason George just hates

[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.600]
christian slater he just despises him

[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:22.380]
Is there any special reason is it just like in general principle?

[02:00:22.740 --> 02:00:26.840]
It could be that he only plays one character which is a poorer imitation of jack Nicholson

[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:30.060]
Is that what it is? Yeah, because I don't hate Kurt Russell. It's just that he reminds me of

[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:31.680]
Disney all the time

[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:36.920]

That would be such a great movie for that really old en narration. They made such a bad mistake

And of course a lot of people tell you it's a great movie it's a good movie, but a good fellows

[02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:20.660]
But it could be a great fellas, you know?

[02:04:22.320 --> 02:04:26.180]
Don't you agree that they it's irritating and annoying. I mean when it comes on TV

[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:29.560]
I do I do watch it again because I like that scene with Joe Peschew

[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:34.320]
You know that like that and I think I'm all combine and of course you got to start laughing

[02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:43.780]
The drug scene of course because where he's like cooking and drugging and drugging and cooking because that's your drug thing again

[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.640]
You know, I'm talking about the cooking in the prison

[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:50.320]
That didn't have anything to do with their drugs. I thought you were talking about when he was cooking in the kitchen prison cooking

[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:52.280]
That's right. They were they had to read. Oh, yeah, what's his name?

Kidnap or the hijack everyone they see a gangster on the side of the street. They stop and talk to him

[02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:18.500]

[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:01.000]
Says that with such emotion. I'll tell you if you would do the whole show with that much emotion you might make a three-share but

[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:07.040]
Might being the operative term. Oh, there's a show on tonight beyond with James van Prague where

[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:14.060]
Juliet Mills who plays Tabithon passion. She's great. We'll try to contact Josh Evans who played Timmy from beyond the grave

[02:10:14.060 --> 02:10:19.040]
This is not a passion story have seen the promos. This is really a guy who thinks like Jonathan Edward

[02:10:19.540 --> 02:10:24.820]
Communicate with the dead. Let's see what Timmy has to say and what's up with both of those guys Jonathan Edward and that James van

[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:28.680]

I know what Timmy is gonna say. I'm dying over here. That's what Timmy is gonna say tonight

[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:41.680]
They make special mention of him in that pen and teller thing that show. Oh, you see it. I forgot about that. I forgot

[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:48.900]
Oh, but it's gonna be on some more apparently there go it's a series and they're going to out other things other scams

[02:10:48.900 --> 02:10:51.680]
Really? Yeah good long overdue

[02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:56.460]
And they say every word in the book by the way as they're doing it. It's great

[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:00.000]
Here's the fact that says Shane come back Shane

[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:05.900]
You said that before the show. I did say because there's a lady coincidentally that just called it once to talk about Shane

[02:11:05.900 --> 02:11:09.560]
Is he on a grand and she's on the now she's the lady. Here's a lady in Hollywood. Hello

[02:11:10.240 --> 02:11:11.860]
Shane come back Shane

[02:11:12.540 --> 02:11:18.600]
That my husband named our son Brandon because of that is an idiot. I need you. I need you

[02:11:19.660 --> 02:11:25.440]
Come back Shane. He cries every time. Yeah, I never saw that movie that was Alan lad

[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:27.140]
And

[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:31.920]
Brandon the world that yeah, but that was Brandon the world was like a little boy in that movie right?

[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:32.980]
I really couldn't care about him

[02:11:32.980 --> 02:11:38.220]
But when he was an all fall down with um Carl Maldon and with Warren Beatty then he became very interesting

[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:40.120]
Brandon the world and then he died

[02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:46.920]
And have a great day. It's good for your church. Okay. Thanks. All right. Yeah

[02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:51.620]
Well, what would you what were you so excited about that you want that's because that's what you wanted to say with Shane

[02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:54.740]
Come back Shane. I didn't see the movie. So what do I say to the box?

[02:11:56.480 --> 02:12:00.460]
It was a little bit disconcerting that Brandon the world ahead that scar on his face

[02:12:00.460 --> 02:12:03.640]
Kind of like Aaron Gabie the hockey player he had a scar on his face

[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:07.240]
Which I guess the Lord works in mysterious ways. You just want to prove that nobody can be perfect

[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:12.760]
You know the hostages a female man. It's confirmed a female man. Yes. Okay. Oh, and by the way

[02:12:12.760 --> 02:12:19.540]
They're still going round and running like curry come on just started to heat up now within the past few minutes for the past

[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:24.340]
40 minutes now what's going to happen when they run out of gas basically hung back

[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:30.600]
Fearing the safety of the male carrier, but as you can see now the police are right on top of that truck Tony go ahead

[02:12:30.600 --> 02:12:31.960]
There they are definitely

[02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.720]
We're there there boy there when it goes

[02:12:34.720 --> 02:12:39.860]
This will win soon I believe there

[02:12:39.860 --> 02:12:42.380]
I also receive word that they have

[02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:45.440]
snipers as well ready to

[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:46.100]

Sniper's are standing by can really mess with him, huh?

[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.020]
Here's the fact that says I'd like to put my two cents in what about Jerry McGuire with Tom Cruise

[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.480]
Don't look at me. I didn't see no Jerry. I didn't see it. I didn't think it was that kind of a right it down

[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:02.180]
right

[02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.620]
What kind of a movie?

[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:09.760]
It's enough to make me cry also. He says PS tell George the shipment came in

[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.000]
Who's that from a friend of yours? Which one?

[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:16.180]
How do I know who to call

[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:21.600]
Here's one that says the movie version of flowers for Algonon of course I never know what I read the book

[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.600]
Uh the book and the movie are both here

What about that very sad movie he was in where he played the return to guy Charlie that's flowers for Algonon

[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:35.820]
Is that the name of the name of the movie yes

[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:38.940]
I never knew that I thought the movie was called Charlie

[02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.700]
Are you sure?

[02:13:41.280 --> 02:13:44.380]
Well, you sure movie version of the book is called but I thought

[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:48.920]
Okay, put down flowers for Algonon and maybe in parentheses, uh, Eric will know he'll look it up

[02:13:50.140 --> 02:13:53.560]
Won't you Eric won't you look it up? No, maybe uh, because we would have Carlos though

[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.180]
But he's busy trying to rob a bank so we can cover the check that he wrote to uh clearance

[02:13:58.540 --> 02:14:01.920]
I'll tell you we got such high finance going on here among all these uh, Macy Pippets
