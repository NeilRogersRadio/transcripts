[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]
They tap off or know without their piece.

[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.100]
Damn, bagger, I can't stand up.

[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.800]
I'm tap-boy Latoya with your telephone book.

[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.780]
Exposing the checks and family you're a cook.

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.640]
But neck in and playboy, you bear all for some cash.

[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.040]
You're more suited for the inquire girl, your trash.

[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.000]
All the dirt, all the checks and you tell.

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.980]
Michael and his monkey juicy style.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.340]
With all his witness, you make my signal normal.

[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.400]
Girl, just shut up.

[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.840]
You're tap-boy Latoya, damn unless I blame.

[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.080]
Time to make a sleazy book of your family's name.

[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.160]
Lomi Shostiras.

[00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.060]
I guess somebody must have loaned somebody a lot of money for that tough piece last night, man.

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.740]
There she was again. Her first outing in six years, Latoya.

[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.160]
I would have King Meister.

[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.620]
That was pathetic.

[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.140]
All of that stuff that he wrote in the book and all of those things that he said.

[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.320]
Come to find out that her former manager, a slave master, he forced her to say all those things.

[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.540]
It's a very functional family now.

[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.260]
No more dysfunction in the Jackson family.

[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.180]
They all love each other.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.240]
And Michael is just a wonderful, like a big teddy bear.

[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.280]
He's a great guy and a very tough businessman.

[00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.280]
And yada yada yada in the duty, duty, duty, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.000]
Oh my God.

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.380]
I kept coming back to it because it was like watching a gigantic train wreck.

[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.360]
I kept going back to it as better or much at least get the beat and all that stupid crap on their game.

[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.600]
It was amazing.

[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.640]
And the callers, they must not only just screen the calls, they must make the calls.

[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.960]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.240]
They must have a staff of phony callers that call them.

[00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.200]
That's what we ought to do.

[00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.840]
Can you imagine the great calls we could ever read?

[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.120]
We'll just have a whole staff of phony people call them in.

[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.180]
Maybe Muff could make a call.

[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.740]
He likes their calling up here all the time.

[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.120]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.260]
Just go away, duff, okay?

[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.760]
Just go find something more productive to do.

[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.080]
Like picking a good one, you know?

[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.740]
Anyway, it's a 903 of 560 WQM.

[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.640]
We give this audience a lot to do.

[00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.760]
We keep them off the streets on your empty of that, huh?

[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.720]
What a public service.

[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.260]
Oh, look at that.

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.680]
Since I printed this out, we already got six more phony votes for Key West.

[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.920]
Wow.

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.300]
This audience has been real busy since I went to bed last night.

[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.680]
You'd think that if they're going to pick a pool, pick a peck a peck a peater.

[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.500]
No, to crank that they find something more important than this one.

[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.460]
Well, yeah.

[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.900]
But I guess the reason they did that is because it was not Miami.

[00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.560]
We asked yesterday the most overrated city in the world is.

[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.480]
And Miami, of course, won hands down.

[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.680]
But between the time I went to bed last night in this morning,

[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.180]
Key West is about 200 and some odd to crank votes.

[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.720]
That's a more like a 250.

[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.520]
And just the votes pouring in there.

[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.420]
Key West only, they're going to get zapped.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.100]
Small potatoes.

[00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.880]
Let it turn over to 400 first.

[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.020]
Oh, well, it will, Billy.

[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.400]
It will.

[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.460]
Yeah.

[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180]
Let me refresh it here.

[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.440]
It'll certainly have 400 votes.

[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.020]
So we had 1,500 some odd votes, some of which about maybe 20 or 30, which were really real.

[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.600]
There you go.

[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880]
400 on mine for Key West.

[00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:31.980]
300, which were phony votes at least.

[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.660]
Anyway, Miami is the winner.

[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.360]
I heard Hank pick up on this yesterday.

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.060]
And I said, hey, that's a runner.

[00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.620]
See, Hank at least listens to this show.

[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.760]
He wants to integrate while picks up on something that we do and embellishes it,

[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.680]
elaborates on it, kills an easy hour with it like he did yesterday before I were a game on.

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.560]
Nice go, Humber.

[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380]
It is an interesting topic.

[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.760]
In fact, the poll we're going to today is even like a kind of a spin-off on it.

[00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.520]
How do you like that?

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.560]
We're spinning it off.

[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.020]
Miami wins hands down.

[00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.560]
All I did here, Hank, say, you know, as far as one of his favorites, you know,

[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.040]
Miami would have to be on the list based on what?

[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.340]
I don't know.

[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.560]
A guy that's traveled around as much as he has.

[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.680]
Maybe he's found interesting places down here.

[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.240]
Or maybe a lot of good hookers.

[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.080]
I don't know one of the other.

[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.580]
I think that's more likely.

[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.240]
More power to him, you know, a lot of good hookers.

[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:19.720]
That's got to be it.

[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.540]
What else could it be?

[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.400]
I don't know.

[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.820]
The one that.

[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.040]
Ah!

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.120]
Got two inches of snow on a grounded tarot here.

[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.660]
And you know, something big-stinking deal.

[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.280]
Who cares?

[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.540]
The hotel he is.

[00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.120]
Yeah.

[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.780]
Miami 328 votes wins hands down.

[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.320]
Nobody even closed, including the phony votes for Key West.

[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.320]
There were some other phony votes on here too.

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.680]
They just had a blast with this poll.

[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.480]
You know, it's good that we keep people off the streets with us.

[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.500]
Now that we're getting ready to blow the world up.

[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.120]
New Orleans, 152.

[00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.440]
I heard, who the hell called in?

[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.760]
Who was it saying that?

[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.200]
Oh, yeah, Hank was talking about it.

[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.780]
That it's a CD and it's a toilet and it's a source.

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.800]
Not exactly what I said.

[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.620]
Yeah, pretty much.

[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.240]
We're right.

[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.280]
And about that fatty food and a real extra spicy food that will get your

[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.020]
Roads popping all over the place.

[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.280]
If you want to have bleeding hemorrhoids like Ray Foster.

[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.480]
Ro!

[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.980]
Okay, right now that's the perfect place to get them whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:11.920]
You'll have grapes.

[00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.180]
I'm telling you, you won't be able to sit down for a month if you eat that crap down there.

[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.080]
A Paris 124 was third.

[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.300]
Then Los Angeles 93 in New York 91.

[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.420]
This is the most overrated city in the world.

[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.800]
NASA out of Bahamas 74.

[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:29.660]
That was the late edition.

[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.440]
And congratulations to everyone who called in to remind me on that.

[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.220]
Good choice.

[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.020]
Yeah, man.

[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.820]
What a dump.

[00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.880]
The Bahamas.

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.740]
I'll see Hank didn't want to say that because every now and then he has need

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.600]
some shows over there.

[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.600]
Right?

[00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.880]
Yeah.

[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.620]
Him and Eddie Kay.

[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.160]
Sure.

[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.880]
Because I guess they get a free deal over there and they get to go and plunge their brains out one of those casinos.

[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.840]
But man, you talk about our rip off place.

[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.280]
That hotel, I know it's years ago, but nevertheless.

[00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.420]
That world, Bahamas, Bohemian, whatever that place was in NASA.

[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.800]
It was so mildly and moldy in there that everything we loved.

[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]
The walls were soaked.

[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:00.000]
Everything was soaked.

[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.760]
It was grotesque.

[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.240]
$50 for a cab driver.

[00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:05.420]
You could have walked in 13 seconds.

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.040]
Just hand over your money, man.

[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.560]
We'll give you a show you a good time, man.

[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.420]
Hanvi over your wallet.

[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.160]
Let me just to clean you out, man.

[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.080]
What's your grave ravers, all your Bahamians?

[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.260]
We know that you're listening to QM.

[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.160]
We know you love this show.

[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.080]
We only wish we could say the same about you.

[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.520]
We know that you just rip us off and hate us like poison.

[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.000]
See all this business about people hating Americans.

[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.680]
One thing about it in Bahamas, they always hated us and they still do.

[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.640]
They just want our money, man.

[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.040]
At least they're pretty upfront about it.

[00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.380]
Yeah, just turn the money over to me, man.

[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:30.940]
Get in.

[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.720]
All into food.

[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:32.660]
Oh my god.

[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.460]
I don't think it.

[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.180]
I forget what the casino was.

[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.520]
It was before they built these new ones.

[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.560]
So this is many years ago.

[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.000]
And I'm not going back to check it out to make sure how nice it is now.

[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.240]
I don't want to find out about it.

[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.300]
The food was grotesque.

[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.560]
Really? The goat wasn't fresh?

[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.100]
The goat was old and used and had been nailed up on somebody's door.

[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.120]
Front door for a few months.

[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.920]
Orlando 66.

[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.920]
I think they should have done better than that, don't you?

[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.500]
Absolutely.

[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.980]
Orlando should have more than 66.

[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.060]
Talk about overrated.

[00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.680]
Sorry, Eric.

[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.060]
Talk about our...

[00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.000]
Well, he can't help it.

[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.160]
It's a real Mickey Mouse...

[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.900]
I can't...

[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.360]
He's cut it down.

[00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:03.240]
Vegas 50.

[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.820]
Man, that's kind of like a median number there.

[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.500]
It's not too bad.

[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.380]
And the one guy called in and said, yeah, Vegas is overrated because the...

[00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.020]
The sex life out there isn't so great.

[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.520]
The hookers.

[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.020]
Yeah.

[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.160]
Not as affordable.

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.080]
What is that?

[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.100]
Is that the only thing the parameter?

[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.340]
I mean, you can get lucky anywhere.

[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.460]
He could get lucky in like Jackson, Michigan.

[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.120]
He could get late.

[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.620]
How do you know?

[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.880]
You don't know what he looks like or how much money he has.

[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.500]
Like I said, there's a guy that couldn't get late in Jackson, Michigan.

[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.460]
That guy that called yesterday.

[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.900]
Tampa 45.

[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:29.800]
And I'll say it again.

[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:30.120]
I don't...

[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.320]
When I travel the world, I never hear anybody say, oh, we can't wait to go to Tampa.

[00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.740]
Well, they got that bridge.

[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.320]
So what is that all about?

[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.400]
Why would you say it's overrated when nobody ever says anything good about it?

[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:42.940]
I say...

[00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:44.040]
That's what I say.

[00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.640]
Unreadable.

[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.000]
Tampa.

[00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.260]
Amsterdam 32.

[00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.140]
Although nobody would call it and tell me why.

[00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:50.480]
I guess that was just to be contrary.

[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.940]
Dallas 28, which again, I never heard anybody say, oh, let's go to Dallas.

[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.800]
Let's see where the...

[00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.220]
Yeah, I don't know.

[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.660]
Assassination took place there.

[00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.660]
Philadelphia 24.

[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.180]
I mean, have you always wanted to go to see the Texas Schoolbook Depository?

[00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:04.160]
The Grassy Noll.

[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.220]
And the Grassy Noll.

[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.880]
And see if Lee Harvey Oswald was really up there with all in cardboard box.

[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.960]
And to look for shell casings.

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.840]
Philadelphia 24.

[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.380]
Aspen 17.

[00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:16.700]
They were just kissing the Carlisers' ass after he put that one under by himself.

[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.980]
Hey, don't be putting any more stuff on here by yourself, Mr. Smarty Pants.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:20.520]
Sure.

[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:22.060]
I'm positive.

[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.120]
All right.

[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.760]
After that article you put on a website.

[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.180]
Oh, I'm never going to get over that.

[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.200]
That was just...

[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.240]
Am I not sending you enough material the last two days?

[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.440]
I must have fact you 600 articles in the last two days.

[00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.200]
And he's putting his own crap on there, including one that...

[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.660]
When I saw that this morning, I wanted to kill somebody and it wasn't myself.

[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.600]
It wasn't on there long enough to taint anything.

[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:43.040]
Oh!

[00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.200]
Yeah, the hell it wasn't.

[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:45.960]
Taint thing.

[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.480]
They were all...

[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.200]
I can smell it all the way up here.

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.000]
Get it off of there.

[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.680]
Aspen 17.

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.100]
San Francisco 15.

[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:52.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.960]
I heard somebody call Hank yesterday talking about...

[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.060]
Where now was it Singapore?

[00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.820]
And about what a wonderful city was.

[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.780]
Only his misfortune.

[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.900]
He was there during the gay week.

[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:04.680]
Yeah.

[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.000]
I think that's what he was trying to say.

[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.460]
Yeah, that's like my being here during that roster week, whatever they call that.

[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.340]
What do they call it?

[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.280]
The Goomba...

[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:12.980]
The Goomba Festival.

[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.080]
In fact, I wish I'd rather be here during the Goomba Festival,

[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.360]
might at least get some good sausages out there on the street.

[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.160]
Some good weenies.

[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:24.080]
San Francisco 15, most overrated, Luxembourg 7 and San Diego 7.

[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.280]
See, the reason I mean, it's got to be cranked, folks,

[00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.240]
because how many people have been Luxembourg?

[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:30.880]
I don't know, maybe...

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:30.880]

[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:31.900]
That many, maybe seven.

[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:32.560]
None.

[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.520]
Maybe it really sucks, I don't know.

[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.840]
How about how would anybody go to Luxembourg in the first place?

[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.540]
Which leads us to our poll today, but before we get to it.

[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.860]
I don't know, they're poll.

[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:44.400]
Yeah, let's see how long before that guy calls in.

[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.420]
I'll start in time.

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:45.840]
First through the next.

[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:48.680]
Oh, yeah, another poll show.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.040]
Another poll show.

[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.020]
Oh, man, you just gotta love it.

[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.040]
You know, all the sick, crazy bastards we have out there.

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.480]
It's wonderful. That's why people listen.

[00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.900]
Because we got sick, crazy bastards.

[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.160]
In fact, that's all we basically want to hear from anymore.

[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.200]
It's sick, crazy bastards.

[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.080]
Not all these people want to tell us about the war

[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.720]
and about the evils of the world.

[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.980]
Yeah, what are we gonna do about that?

[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.260]
Just like Lignis today, he wants me to play some fag song

[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.200]
by George Michael about you, some anti-war song.

[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.920]
Let's start playing Buffalo Springfield for what it's worth.

[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.360]
What do you say?

[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.720]
We'll get all the old folk music from the 60s.

[00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.160]
Thundercrack, new bloody song.

[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:26.840]
I'll count that CD over here while I was sorting some things out.

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:26.840]

[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.260]
Thundercrack Newman.

[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:28.940]
Gotta play that.

[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.600]
Really? Sure.

[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.440]
Huh.

[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.240]
Can smell it.

[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]
There's something in the air, all right.

[00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.560]
Probably Mo's bag overflowed.

[00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.560]
Oh, it's speaking of Mo.

[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.740]
Cause I heard a comment about Nickers, and if I was there,

[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.060]
we all gotta wear Nickers at the golf.

[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.640]
See, the reason that if I was in town,

[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.100]
I wouldn't be at the golf term is I don't do golf term in smoke.

[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.460]
Golf is boring.

[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.420]
It's not a sport, it's a game.

[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.520]
And number two, even if it works, I think there's no tiger,

[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.220]
there's no filmickelson, there's no, uh, there's nothing.

[00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:57.080]
So, D'Areal, even though the station is out there

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.400]
and obsessed with trying to squeeze a few bucks out of it this year,

[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.540]
like always, D'Areal is like a throwaway.

[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.080]
So throwaway.

[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.380]
And Nickers went out with bad hair pieces, like I said before.

[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.560]
The fact that Nickers were a part of golf,

[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.420]
you do understand, remember,

[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.260]
you've seen pictures of Ben Hogan and Sammy Sneed.

[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.400]
Sure, and the Sammy Sneed, by the way,

[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.200]
he putted side saddle, Sammy Sneed.

[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.420]
Like a girl, side saddle.

[00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.700]
But anyway, yeah, that's when they started.

[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.000]
The Scottish invented it.

[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.460]
The whole thing.

[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.720]
With their kilts, and then it became Nickers,

[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.840]
and they were all dolled up, like a bunch of, you know,

[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.520]
justified country rich and snobs.

[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.740]
And that's, of course, what they were.

[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:33.520]
Plads socks.

[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.620]
Yeah, a flat, flat, big, flat socks.

[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:36.400]
Mm-hmm.

[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.020]
Oh my God.

[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.580]
Oh, you got to look the part.

[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.560]
In fact, I thought it was hysterical.

[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.100]
The first thing most said to Guilty this morning,

[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.260]
take off those checkered pants.

[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.240]
I thought it was cute.

[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.300]
This story just frosted my ass.

[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.420]
I guess we better do the break first about the man-charge

[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.680]
with trespassing with the tea,

[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.660]
or the Albany Mall.

[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.260]
Yeah, you don't want to.

[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.540]
This could show you how far America has come down the ladder.

[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.640]
All you people still think you're in the land of the free.

[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.820]
Get real, man.

[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.640]
Get serious.

[00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.420]
You must be in a dream world.

[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.160]
Land of the free as in the past.

[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.040]
As in the ancient past.

[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.420]
Land of the free.

[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:10.000]
As in the BB before Bush.

[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.860]
913 to 560.

[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.260]
Don't let me get all whipped up again today,

[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.180]
even though I have to be a lot better at being a baling strength.

[00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:18.980]
Back in duck, don't call me this afternoon.

[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:19.760]
Don't call me.

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.260]
I will slam the phone down.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.440]
Calls me again yesterday.

[00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.100]
Pope Cabranda, this is what I mean.

[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.280]
I just figured out yourself, okay?

[00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.440]
Do something constructive and useful for once in your life.

[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.200]
Make a decision.

[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.740]
Oh!

[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:32.660]
Oh!

[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.240]
Make a decision!

[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.540]
Rumor has it that sometimes muffsits in the old in the tea room in air for hours.

[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:43.220]
Trying to figure out because especially if it grays out of the building,

[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.880]
not that you can't tell him which hand to wipe with.

[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.840]
Paper plastic.

[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.000]
Either that or maybe he's drilling glory holes.

[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.480]
I'm not sure.

[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.660]
913 at 560.

[00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.400]
W2QM, if you're still reluctant about ordering a bed over the phone,

[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.760]
don't do it because I've been doing it.

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:57.640]
George Dunnett, Miguel did it.

[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:00.840]
Over a million people of bottom-up mattress over the phone from Dalam mattress,

[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.300]
plus hundreds more are doing it every week.

[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:02.760]
Why?

[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.720]
Because it's the smart thing to do, not dumb like Frito.

[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.180]
Our good friends at Dalam mattress ought to be like right on the tip of your tongue

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.720]
because we talk about him every day on the show and nothing's got a bigger impact

[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.240]
on your life and the way you feel, each and every day, they're getting a good night's sleep.

[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.680]
Look at me, I had a great night's sleep last night and I don't even have my Dalam mattress yet.

[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.240]
It's coming though.

[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.380]
Call 1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S right now and you'll have a great night's sleep from Dalam mattress too.

[00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.300]
Take it from me.

[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.440]
It's the easiest piece of shopping you can do in your life.

[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.760]
Just that one quick phone call gets you exactly the mattress you're looking for.

[00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:32.060]
They got the best in the business.

[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:37.980]
Seely, Serta, Simmons, King Coil, Erie, Sais and Style, no substitutions, no bait and swish.

[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.580]
Dalam mattress is ranked number one in customer satisfaction in the universe.

[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.200]
They've got more repeat and referral customers than anybody because they know how to treat your right.

[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:49.300]
Once you buy a mattress and Dalam mattress, you'll never go back to a showroom and get ripped off again.

[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.020]
And don't forget when you buy your mattress and Dalam mattress, they set up the brand new bedding

[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.820]
and take away the crappy old smelly bedding for free.

[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.560]
That's right, no matter how nasty and sore and grotesque and unmanshable the old bedding is.

[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.640]
They take away the old bedding and set up your brand new one for free when you do business with Dalam mattress.

[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.040]
Make that call right now and enjoy a great night's sleep as soon as tonight and for months and years to come.

[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.640]
1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S Tomat Fatboy told you to call.

[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.860]
That's my life and look all this is Fort Real 560.

[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.320]
2-800-M

[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.260]
Gangrape is funny.

[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:24.680]
What's next?

[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:25.340]
Dead babies?

[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:32.460]
All of America is tuning in to find out who will be the next un-American idol.

[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:39.960]
Tonight, Fun Candy Hard, my talentless Taliban creeps face the judge who will be eliminated.

[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.520]
Will it be Mohammed?

[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:42.620]
Mohammed?

[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:43.560]
Mohammed?

[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:44.380]
Mohammed?

[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:45.180]
Over?

[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:45.920]
Mohammed?

[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.380]
And now, the end is near.

[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.280]
We will destroy the great Satan.

[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:05.520]
And when they're done, each un-American performer is judged on the spot by an un-American idol judge like Simon.

[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.780]
Will no Mohammed?

[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:13.480]
I thought your performance was repugnant, repulsive, revoking, in other words, your fabulous.

[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:19.320]
On the American Idol, where bombing on stage takes on a whole new meaning.

[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.240]
Oh, summer, you deserve it!

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:22.100]
You deserve it!

[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.400]
You've blown my mind to summer!

[00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.140]
Oh, Tadalatadalat!

[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:31.900]
On the American Idol, where even the winners are losers!

[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.520]
18 and 560 WQA and we are radio-ish.

[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.140]
Now, let me ask you, why are you faxing in the sub-boring crack?

[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.760]
Well, it's half of what was faxed over here.

[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:43.400]
Yeah, but that's not the point.

[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.500]
I mean, why are you faxing me all of these bedtime stories?

[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.860]
I don't know.

[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.680]
I thought we aren't doing that anymore.

[00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:50.100]
Just so you have it, so you can see it.

[00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:50.260]
Why?

[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:50.960]
I don't know.

[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.000]
So I can get depressed.

[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.600]
Okay.

[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.180]
Do I need to see anything new about Dick Cheney or about fancishism by this federal government?

[00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.260]
I don't need to see him more.

[00:15:58.320 --> 00:15:59.640]
But you're just depressing me now with this crap.

[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:03.700]
Between you and Bokobrine and Carlos, I think Eric is the winner in this contest.

[00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:05.740]
Eric's starting to look a lot better.

[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:07.880]
What are you laughing about?

[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.380]
And all these people just making their own little...

[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:13.580]
Just be good little soldiers.

[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.140]
They're okay.

[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.000]
Just go step along.

[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:17.480]
Speaking of that, do you have that Latoya card still handy?

[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.760]
That is on a card isn't it?

[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.500]
Well, there is very much aware of all the children that were there.

[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.160]
All the boys had stayed there.

[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.140]
And she is the one who always said that Michael...

[00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:27.860]
Excuse my expression, but he's a faggot.

[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.180]
And she would say that damn faggot, I can't stand him.

[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.020]
Oh no, but last night she changed her tune, Latoya.

[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.960]
And now that she's in, not under that evil spell.

[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:38.140]
Speaking of evil spells and voodoo, which we'll get to momentarily.

[00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.460]
Yeah, Michael Jackson, no matter how much we want him to go away,

[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:41.520]
he just will not go away.

[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:42.100]
He refuses.

[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:48.000]
And Rick Faxeson says it was nice to see that Larry King never asked Latoya.

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.340]
What time she had to return Michael's nose back to him?

[00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:52.560]
Larry is so lame.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:53.280]
Yes he is.

[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.000]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:54.920]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:56.660]
He's lame all right.

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.760]
Talk about letting somebody off the hook.

[00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:01.900]
Just, you know, he would pretend that he was following up the question.

[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.940]
Like, you read that stuff and you really...

[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]
wanted to read it.

[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.020]
I mean, you know.

[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.200]
He just let her say whatever else you wanted to send.

[00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:11.540]
And they put on a bunch of askuses.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.220]
Oh, Latoya, it's so wonderful to see you.

[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.200]
And you look so good.

[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.900]
Now you're going to be performing live and Sweden here.

[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:20.960]
And those are the only cause I heard where Ackler calls.

[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.700]
Not how, not how come you wrote all that crap in the book.

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:24.800]
And now you're changing your tune.

[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.860]
Because your brother's a child molester.

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:27.720]
And you're changing your tune.

[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.780]
I want to talk about that anymore.

[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.940]
Because it's bad for business.

[00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.160]
Anyway, don't get me started on that bitch.

[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.940]
That's a cool thing.

[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.180]
Man charged with trespassing after refusing to remove pro-peace shirt and mall.

[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.140]
This story is so freaking what America is all about right now

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.020]
that it's as scary as what it is.

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.400]
People ought to be hiding under the God damn bed is what they ought to be doing because...

[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.840]
That's the American fucking way.

[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:50.060]
Right.

[00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:53.000]
Albany, New York.

[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:58.820]
A man was charged with trespassing in a mall after he refused to take off a t-shirt that said,

[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.320]
peace on earth and give peace a chance.

[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:10.080]
Mall security approached Stephen Downes, 61 and 31-year-old son Roger on Monday night

[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.700]
after they were spotted wearing the t-shirts at the cross gate's mall

[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:16.040]
in a suburb of Albany, the men's side.

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:20.700]
The two said they were asked to remove the shirts made at a store there or leave the mall they refused.

[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.780]
The guards returned with a police officer repeated the ultimatum.

[00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.560]
The son took off his t-shirt but the father refused.

[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:32.100]
I said, all right then, arrest me if you have to.

[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.180]
Downs said, so that's what they did.

[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.020]
They put the handcuffs on and took me away.

[00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:35.880]
Based on what?

[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.180]
Based on they didn't like his freaking t-shirt.

[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.200]
Oh, I understand that, but what law are they citing?

[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.820]
Downs pleaded innocent to the charges Monday night.

[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.720]
The New York Civil Liberties Union City would help it with this case if asked.

[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:50.780]
Police chief James Morley said his officers were just responding to a complaint by mall security.

[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:57.260]
We don't care what they have on their shirts, but they were asked to leave the property and its private property, Morley said.

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.520]
A mall spokeswoman didn't return calls Tuesday seeking comment.

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.740]
Monday's arrest came less than three months after about 20 peace activists wearing similar t-shirts.

[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.420]
We're told to leave the mall by security and police that were no arrest in that incident.

[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:09.220]
How do you like that?

[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:18.200]
So in other words, like kids going to school, they're going to get sent home if they're going to t-shirt that the teacher decides is unpopular or provocative or has a message they don't like.

[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.940]
And now if you go to the shopping mall, so I think that everybody in Albany, New York, that's what these people ought to be doing as organizing.

[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:29.940]
Everybody who wants peace or give peace a chance or doesn't agree with a goose step into line, they should just not shop for that mall anymore.

[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:30.960]
Sounds good to me, right?

[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.940]
Tell them just the old FU sounds good.

[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.760]
Since when do malls have a dress code?

[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.500]
Because that's the excuse at schools. You can't wear anything provocative because of the dress code.

[00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.020]
Right.

[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:45.400]
You can't have free speech is what if boils down to you.

[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:54.780]
You can't display anything on your shirt. It reminds me of Hollywood Beach not that many years ago when Mayor Mara Golanty, the fascist mayor of Hollywood, life is a beach.

[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.440]
Oh no, you can't be wearing those!

[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.520]
And I forget what the other ones were. The other slightly more provocative t-shirts they were wearing on there.

[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.680]
Oh, you can't have those on Hollywood Beach, right?

[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.560]
Or the phone police, don't forget them.

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.400]
We're going to turn you into a frog, okay?

[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.080]
As if we don't have enough of those already down there.

[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:18.600]
Just disgraceful, all this bull crap and all this pseudo patriotism and putting the hand over the heart and saluting the flag in one nation under God.

[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:20.720]
Yeah, right, you're living in a past, okay?

[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:33.460]
You got a bunch of fascists now deciding who can say what, when they can say it, where they can say it, where they can express themselves, what we can say on the year, yaddy-addy-addy-addy, whether or not we can play condolence, all of the other crap.

[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.700]
Forget about freedom. That's in a past we're taking gigantic leaping, not just steps.

[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:53.620]
That's indicates like, you know, one step at a time. We're taking gigantic bounds, you know, how like a kangaroo leaps from one spot to the back into the distant past, where freedom was just a fantasy in somebody's mind, just a big newton of somebody's imagination.

[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.900]
Freedom, my big fat frickin ass.

[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.900]
God, better take this miney call. Hello?

[00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:10.540]
Hello? Yes, sir. Hey, my mother had a friend who was curator at that museum in Texas, Dallas, the school of the positive toward museum.

[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.780]
Anyway, I went to the opening with him and there's a film in there. I guess it was a home video or something.

[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:15.860]
These are a food or film?

[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.680]
These are food or film? Is there a copy of it?

[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:27.500]
I don't know. They had it in the, anyway. It shows it towards the grassy knoll and there's a puff of smoke coming into the damn trees.

[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:29.000]
Oh, there's no question about it.

[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.400]
And there's people running towards the trees and I'm like, what's the deal here?

[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.360]
All the people in the crowd are at least most of them ran right toward the grassy knoll because that's where the gunshots came from. They did not come from the Texas Schoolbook Depository.

[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:42.780]
Well, if you ever go there, check out the film in there and show you can see smoke.

[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:43.660]
Okay.

[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.500]
Sorry, man. Probably Georgia's lit up a big fat one up there.

[00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.860]
Yeah, that's what the smoke is.

[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:54.040]
Well, seriously, I mean, anybody with a brain knows that it was a conspiracy that the Harvey Oswald was a patsy.

[00:21:54.120 --> 00:22:00.660]
Just like he said, he was set up to take the fall for the assassination of prison Kennedy and for the shooting of the police officer officer Tibits was at his name.

[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.040]
I guess.

[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.400]
What do you mean you guess?

[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.620]
You're supposed to be the expert. I'm supposed to be the old seamow fart.

[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.220]
Officer JD Tibits, I believe, was his name.

[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.080]
But nevertheless, I'll take your word for it.

[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:17.640]
He was a patsy Oswald. He never shot anybody except of course Jack Ruby.

[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.220]
And that was another whole story.

[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.660]
Or was the other way around. I'm sorry. I had a bad movie too.

[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.640]
Yeah, Jack Ruby shot him at the, yeah.

[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.640]
Yeah, just coincidence that they just happen to let Ruby walk in there because he was known to the police.

[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.920]
They just let him kind of walk in and oh, but I'm being.

[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.380]
And so now we'll never get the real truth from Lee Oswald.

[00:22:33.820 --> 00:22:36.000]
And then Jack Ruby and Jalen, Dorothy Kiel-Gallon.

[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.620]
Vooka Brian will tell you about that one of these days.

[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.980]
In between them, make it a lot of bits that we can't play on the year.

[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.360]
Dorothy Kiel-Gallon.

[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.240]
Yeah, no, no, no. She died real suddenly, too, very suspicious, huh?

[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:51.940]
And then next to it was John Charles Daly and Bennett surf and they all died from what's my line?

[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.640]
Separately in Francis. She just refuses to die. She didn't die. Did she? I think she's still alive.

[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:57.560]
Huh?

[00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.260]
She just refuses to die. Arlene Francis, everybody else on that show,

[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.140]
it was everyone who said, soupy sales and Arlene Francis, they all died.

[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.980]
Yeah, what? What's my line?

[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.440]
Which John Charles Daly, boy, that was a bad show.

[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:12.860]
But it goes to show in the early days of TV no matter what crap they put on, we'd watch it.

[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.180]
You want to know why? Because that's what was there.

[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.880]
Yeah, not like now. Now when you got a choice of 50,000 different channels,

[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:24.220]
I was telling George before the show today. I watched yesterday a Spanish language version of Dracula from 1931 with subtitles.

[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.400]
Dracula. It was a camp. It was funny.

[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.200]
It sounds like it would be funny. It was very amusing.

[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.700]
So we'll get to today's pull momentarily when we're good and ready.

[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.580]
We'll take some more of these fantastic calls. We're trying to lighten things up a little bit for you.

[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.640]
Instead of getting you mired all of this nervous, nearly crap.

[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.640]
What are we going to do about it? Look on our website.

[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.680]
We got 50,000 SIDLATING STORIES on there about the war and about bush did this

[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:49.940]
and Bush is going to do that and as Krop says this in Tom Ridges and Asshole, stuff like that.

[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:51.000]
It's all on there.

[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.160]
But as far as the show is concerned, that guy yesterday, that screamer that called on the show yesterday,

[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.520]
remember he's going to be a song of dance about what I should be doing.

[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.780]
He was like one step away from that bitch that calls about how difficult it is.

[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.620]
It's not difficult at all. People want to be entertained. They want some amusement.

[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.560]
They don't want to be beat. At least I don't want to be beaten over the head with this crap all day.

[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.880]
What are we going to do about it? It's not a question of if it's a question of when.

[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.840]
I say March 12th. Pick that. That's a week from today.

[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:19.400]
All right. Got it written down. Got it written down.

[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:23.120]
I'm not using the office pool for the first La Bomba.

[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.280]
When a Bomba Grande on a bag there or somewhere there.

[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.980]
You already said between the 10th and the 20th.

[00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.120]
I'm being specific now. I'm being very specific.

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.180]
March 12th. What do you say?

[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.340]
12th sounds good. We're going to do an office pool. That's a good idea.

[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.420]
How about the 14th?

[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.480]
Okay. And Carlos.

[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.520]
We're just Friday. 17th.

[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:40.480]
17th.

[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:42.040]
I already was going to go there.

[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.940]
And Miguel, you can take a pick too since he happens to be writing something.

[00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.700]
What's Miguel got in the office pool? What date?

[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:48.880]
And write them all down. Write our names down.

[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.700]
The trend day. He's voting for the 27th.

[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.040]
Oh, that's when the trends come on.

[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:56.520]
Yeah. Oh, brother. That's going to be detail.

[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.520]
Big day. Wait and see that. If we have another one.

[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.740]
There's real bad trends.

[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.980]
And if Mo goes up again, we'll have to start sucking his checkered pants.

[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.960]
Hey, but look on the bright side.

[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.480]
Yeah. Remember the previous goal for our ratings went way up because nobody else in town is doing.

[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.020]
You know, talk about that.

[00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.220]
That was on WIOD.

[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.860]
You see, right? That was an IOD.

[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:15.540]
That was a news and talk station.

[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.900]
Not a sports station.

[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.220]
Oh, I don't think too many people are going to be doing a sports station to find out what's going on in the world.

[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.200]
On the same station that when 9-11 took place,

[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:25.500]
Geldy was in on their babbling.

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.200]
What are we going to say about it?

[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:27.780]
What are we going to say?

[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:28.760]
Let's talk sports. Come on.

[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:30.000]
You know that. Remember that?

[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:30.520]
Inversement.

[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.180]
Sports.

[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.200]
9-28-560 WQM.

[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.200]
And I guarantee a guy's size makes a difference. Trust me.

[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.280]
Take it from somebody who knows.

[00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.580]
According to the Florida Department of Labor,

[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:45.360]
computer professionals have big, big, impressive mushrooming paychecks.

[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:46.800]
That's what we're talking about.

[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:47.720]
According to the state of Florida,

[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.280]
computer careers are among the highest paid and in highest demand.

[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.420]
And fast-ranking up, you get a big fat one too,

[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.200]

[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.900]
And they can train you just four short months.

[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.860]
Fast-ranking's got locations all over town,

[00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.860]
so no matter where you be living,

[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.740]
there's probably one right by you.

[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.580]
They're in candle. They're in Miami for Lauderdale and Pemberg Pines.

[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.440]
And they've got day-evening a weekend schedule.

[00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.720]
So no longer do you have any excuse to stay in a crappy,

[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:11.240]
minimum wage, dead end job, working for some schmuck.

[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.700]

1-866 Fast Train.

[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:36.160]
My life and local, this is 420560.

[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.940]
You ain't can't wait.

[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:38.260]
I'm here.

[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.420]
The World of America.

[00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:50.540]
The World of America.

[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.020]

[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:51.240]
The World of America.

[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:51.620]
The World of America.

[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.180]
The World of America.

[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:53.560]
The World of America.

[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.520]
The World of America.

[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.080]
The World of America.

[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.660]
The World of America.

[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:04.460]
The World of America.

[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.220]
The World of America.

[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:07.920]
The World of America.

[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.240]
Mohammed, over!

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.760]
Mohammed, and...

[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.440]
Can I just play that or am I a host, knitting?

[00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.240]
No, you played it.

[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.380]
Huh? You played it?

[00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.880]
See, you see, I asked him, Carlos, he's like,

[00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.300]
ah, I was across the road.

[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:23.060]
Well, I'm not listening to this crap.

[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:26.360]
Dr. Phil, he's the fresh new face of TV talk.

[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.020]
Now, his folksy pearls of wisdom are available on this new compact disk.

[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:35.560]
Introducing the best self-darker Phil with great Dr. Phil quotes.

[00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.360]
Like...

[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.940]
You want to know where the truffles are?

[00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:39.580]
Just follow the peg.

[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.200]
And...

[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.200]
Have you fall off the horse?

[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.820]
Don't give back holes?

[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.780]
Shoot the dang thing in by car!

[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:48.400]
Huh?

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.140]
But that's not all.

[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.080]
When you order the best of Dr. Phil,

[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.520]
you'll get hundreds of pithy and peculiar things like these.

[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.860]
The farmer wouldn't need a tractor

[00:27:57.860 --> 00:27:59.840]
if the ox ran on diesel.

[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:00.300]
What?

[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:01.960]
Plus...

[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.340]
If you treat your marriage like a turkey ranch,

[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:07.240]
you better keep your eye on the giblets.

[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:11.500]
If you enjoy getting advice that's both down home and downright confusing,

[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:13.740]
get Phil Best, Phil Dr. Phil.

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.800]
Hi, I'm Dr. Phil McGraw.

[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.120]
And before you order, think about this.

[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.380]
If you're sitting on a stool that's too high,

[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.540]
you ain't never gonna reach the other.

[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.300]
Emma, make him a self-clear.

[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.580]
And...

[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:28.580]

[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.740]
Operators are standing by anyway.

[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:32.380]
Yeah, that Dr. Phil.

[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.120]
He's an asshole.

[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.140]
He makes me physically ill when I see him on the TV.

[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:36.800]
Dr. Il?

[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:37.860]
Dr. Il.

[00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.520]
Anyway, on the next break,

[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.740]
let me be sure and play this one.

[00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.340]
Oh, the farmer ain't going to eat it.

[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.000]
Well, what the hell do I know?

[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.340]
Okay, I've never been any attention.

[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.000]
I'm busy playing.

[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.340]
I'm busy watching it snow out there anyway.

[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.720]
Oh, it is Wednesday, too.

[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.200]
Don't forget our big new and the one out there.

[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.280]
That was just practice for a big comedy bit,

[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:54.980]
so I'll have fun with the new and the one.

[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:55.800]
Yeah, you can play it again.

[00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:56.580]
It's just snowing out there.

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.580]
I'll play it then fact.

[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.040]
Oh, the farmer ain't going to eat it.

[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.260]
Let's get started with that right now.

[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.060]
It sounds good to me.

[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.480]
Here's a call from Del Rey Beach.

[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:04.720]

[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:05.780]
A meal.

[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:06.600]
Yes, sir.

[00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:09.080]
How could you have had a list of liberated cities

[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.240]
with that including Chicago, Toronto, Boston, or Pahokie?

[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:13.260]
Yeah.

[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.820]
In Battle Pops, our Michael Jackson,

[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.940]
wears a prosthetic nose and once paid $150,000 for a voodoo curse

[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:23.280]
or as Paul said this morning on CNN, voodoo.

[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.400]
A voodoo curse to kill directors Steven Spielberg,

[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:28.880]
despite being deep in dead Vanity Fair magazine reports

[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.680]
in that big article.

[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.940]
I just want to caution you that the person who

[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.900]
wrote the Vanity Fair article is her name in here?

[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.440]
Is that the bitch that's been on all the little interview shows?

[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.660]
Word hell is her name?

[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.160]
She's married to Tim Russell from Meet the Press.

[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:44.880]
Okay.

[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:46.620]
That pasty face to Irishman Tim Russell.

[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:46.800]
Right.

[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.880]
And she also wrote the book about Andrew Koonan

[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.720]
and I remember when that came out at the time after all that stuff went on,

[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.400]
especially in South Florida, which nobody cared about,

[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.660]
because it was a fag thing.

[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.740]
But anyway, she didn't know what a glory hole was.

[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.080]
So how could some bitch who doesn't even know what a glory hole is?

[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.000]
Or will be right about Michael Jackson and little boys?

[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:03.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.060]
Maybe she should have been able to have an occasion to use one.

[00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.320]
Yeah, well, the Vanity Fair and its article

[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.620]
for its April issue also reports that Jackson bleaches his skin white

[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:13.280]
because he doesn't like being black.

[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.380]
Oh ho ho.

[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.260]
It's surprised.

[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.460]
The 44-year-old singer sometimes refers to black people as

[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:20.840]
spa books, the magazine said.

[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:21.560]
Spa books.

[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:24.040]
Which is a combination of what?

[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:24.720]
Spooks and what?

[00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:27.100]
Blacks book?

[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:27.600]
I don't know.

[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:28.540]
Spa books.

[00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.060]
I'll let it go.

[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.360]
It's got kind of a ring to a spa book.

[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:31.820]
Spa book.

[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:32.220]
Spa book.

[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:33.060]
No, no, no.

[00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.140]
No, no, no.

[00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:33.260]
No, no, no, no.

[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.700]
Just keep saying it over and over again.

[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.860]
I won't have any meany spa books, spa books, spa books, spa books, spa books.

[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:38.980]
Oh, you know what that sounds like?

[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:39.960]
Eddie, I know that.

[00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:41.880]
That's what spa books, spa books, spa books.

[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:42.240]
Yeah.

[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.320]
This is Eddie's spa books, spa books.

[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:46.320]
Maybe that's what he was saying.

[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:50.760]
Anyway, Jackson's manager did not immediately return phone calls

[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.660]
in a fact request for a comment on the article.

[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.980]
Jackson's London Public Schools could not be reached for comment.

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.360]
Vanity Fair reports in the article,

[00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:02.040]
and in 2000, Jackson attended a voodoo ritual in Switzerland

[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.220]
where a witch doctor promised at Spielberg,

[00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.640]
music mogul David Geffen,

[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.880]
and 23 other people on the entertainer's list of enemies would die.

[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.160]
What about Tommy Metolia?

[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:11.780]
I bet you he was on the list.

[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.860]
Jackson wanted to win a blood bath as part of the ritual,

[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.040]
and ordered his, he wondered what a blood bath is part of the ritual.

[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.080]
Don't just gloss over that.

[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:19.660]
Yeah, no.

[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:20.580]
Well.

[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.480]
Oh, the American!

[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:21.760]
Okay.

[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:27.100]
Then ordered his former business advisor,

[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.160]
Myeongho Lee,

[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:32.280]
to wire $150,000 to a bank in Mali

[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.900]
for a voodoo chief named Baba,

[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.560]
yeah, who sacrificed 42 cows for the ceremony,

[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.580]
the magazine reported.

[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.120]
Woohoo!

[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:40.440]
How do you like that?

[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.060]
Baba.

[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.480]
You think that it was Baba Buik?

[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.180]
Boop.

[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.800]
Or Baba Ganon?

[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:46.540]
Baba Spabook.

[00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:49.300]
Or maybe Baba Buik.

[00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:50.020]
Or Baba Blah.

[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:53.520]
The Vanity Fair report of that Jackson was a page boy wig in prosthesis

[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.680]
that serves as the tip of his nose.

[00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:57.120]
Yeah.

[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.540]
The magazine interviewed a source post-adjection who said that without the device

[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:02.760]
Jackson resembles a mummy with two nostril holes.

[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.220]
He's got two holes.

[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:05.920]
According to the magazine,

[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.280]
Jackson's extravagant lifestyle and declining record sales

[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.740]
had left him $240 million in debt.

[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.200]
Oh, right.

[00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.360]
Or better go out and buy some Michael Jackson records right now to get the king of pop.

[00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.520]
His money back.

[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.300]
One million pounds for Neil Rogers.

[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:18.400]
He's in the his house.

[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.680]
Yeah.

[00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:21.680]
That amazing how that happens when your fingers slip.

[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:22.540]
That was kind of cute.

[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.540]
That's what I was really hoping for.

[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:30.440]
But the article which relies in part on court filings in a $12 million lawsuit against Jackson

[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.780]
by Lee said that since the mid-1990s,

[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:37.160]
the reclusive entertainers relied on a series of multi-million dollar loans to cover his expenses.

[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.800]
In addition to the lawsuit by Lee,

[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.900]
Jackson's also in meshed in a $21 million court battle with German concert promoter Marcel Avram

[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:49.440]
over cancel millennium concerts has been sued by South of these auction house for $1.6 million.

[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.220]
And Yadda Yadda.

[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.600]
He's got Soros, baby.

[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:54.880]
And that's why we need to look for you on their last night to suck up with Larry

[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.280]
and he sucked up with her and to make everything look good.

[00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:02.140]
And the guy's right that said the fact she didn't have what used to be Michael's nose on her face last night.

[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.420]
The old nose.

[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.020]
She's got the old nose before he just had the two holes in his...

[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.540]
He said he's got two holes in her post too.

[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.900]
This is a disgusting article.

[00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.860]
That's a megalbi very interested in this.

[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.020]
He's out of there now, right?

[00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:16.380]
Yeah, right.

[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:16.700]
Good.

[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:17.480]
He get...

[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.920]
He get...

[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:18.960]
Psychotic have he heard this.

[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.540]
Arifart and Castro listed among the world's richest rulers.

[00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:26.300]
Yeah.

[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.400]
Palestinian leader Yesor Amifart and Cuban President Fidel Castro have been listed among the world's richest rulers,

[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.960]
although their estimated fortunes pale in comparison to those of established monarchs.

[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.000]
Forbes magazine, which is compiled the list of the richest kings, queens, and despots

[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.880]
and published it in its latest issue, puts Arifart's holdings of $300 million and Castro's at $110 million.

[00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.880]
Oh, they're no Oprah.

[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.380]
No, they're not.

[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.700]
The publication admitted though that valuing these fortunes is a tricky business.

[00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:59.740]
It said it calculated Castro's wealth, for example, as a percentage of Cuba's gross domestic product.

[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:07.640]
The list is led by Saudi-Aylen King Fad bin Abdul Aziz, who said to be worth $20 billion right.

[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:15.500]
He's followed by the Sultan of Brunei, Haish Hassaniya Volkia, whose net worth is estimated at E.A. Paul 3.11 billion.

[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:16.720]
Well, that's totally sure it's slipping.

[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:22.320]
The Prince of Lichtenstein, Hans Adam the Tooth, was tied in third place with the Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,

[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.880]
the fortunes of east to the east of the Maristimated $2 billion coin to four.

[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.420]
Pikers, small potatoes.

[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:28.300]
Bill Gates has what?

[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.400]
Small potatoes is the freaking Saddam Hussein.

[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.640]
Okay, here's the poll for today and we'll build it.

[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.500]
I realize it's another poll.

[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:35.260]
What?

[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:36.220]
Yeah, another poll?

[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:39.760]
Well, I wanted to say this so that the guy can call him again, which he will.

[00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:40.220]
Oh, very good.

[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.380]
Mr. Negatory.

[00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:42.380]
Another poll.

[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:43.280]
Another poll.

[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.660]
Like that punk who has sent the facts a couple of days ago,

[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.720]
oh, and don't even get me started on those polls.

[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:49.500]
Okay, we won't even get you started, Billy.

[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:50.580]
Whatever your name is.

[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.160]
And get your finger out of your boyfriend's back home.

[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.380]
People are starting to talk or he'll wash it off while you're at it.

[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.780]
Please. And the finger too.

[00:34:58.200 --> 00:34:59.040]
Here's the poll today.

[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.980]
Very similar to yesterday, but it's a spin-off.

[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:04.880]
I mean, if Hans spun it for a little while, why can't we spin our own?

[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.320]
A roll our own.

[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.980]
What's the one place in a world you've been never been to that you want to visit the most?

[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.420]
Now, you insist that I've done this before.

[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:13.120]
I don't think so.

[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.040]
I think you did cities before.

[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.880]
You're positive.

[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.060]
You're positive what?

[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.320]
That you did cities before.

[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.620]
Cities that you want to visit or some variation of this.

[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:23.220]
Full of crap.

[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:23.580]
All right.

[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:27.040]
What's the one place in a world you've never been to that you want to visit most?

[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.820]
Now, I start with a list of one because I put my own on their Prague, right?

[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:32.540]
I added one.

[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.520]
And that is New Zealand.

[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.220]
So you can be a country, a city, you can be one of my new Zealand.

[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:38.680]
Yeah.

[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:40.060]
So do you want to go there for it?

[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:41.540]
Exotic. They got those mawries.

[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:44.240]
Every picture that I've seen looks really beautiful.

[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:45.500]
They're peaceful people.

[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:47.380]
So yeah, I want to check it out.

[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:48.180]
Mmm.

[00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:50.600]
Oh, it's exotic out in the middle of nowhere.

[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:51.980]
What about Australia?

[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:52.780]
That too.

[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.800]
I mean, there were a lot of places.

[00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:54.700]
I thought about it a lot.

[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.460]
A lot of places I wanted to visit.

[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.520]
So that's our poll today and we start with only two so that leaves it wide open.

[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.740]
The one place and not a list.

[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:06.660]
See, not a whole but not the 85 places you've never been to that you'd like to see.

[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.320]
The one place in a world you've never been to that you want to visit most.

[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:13.660]
In other words, if you were to win a ticket, they used to do that on some of the game shows here.

[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.180]
I go on the quiz shows, name a place.

[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:15.960]
Right.

[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.500]
You'd want a trip to any place in a world and you have to pick one place you couldn't say.

[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.160]
Well, I want to go to these 45 places.

[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.020]
No, we don't think so.

[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:22.400]
One.

[00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:23.240]
There's a big one.

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:27.180]
You could vent about that all day long and they'll still call up in facts lists.

[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:28.260]
That's what you think.

[00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:28.640]
All right.

[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:33.280]
Because you know what they're going to get if they do that either on the phone or on the

[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:33.780]
facts machine.

[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:38.260]
The old DQ maybe they're going to get the old DQ which stands for of course the old dairy

[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:39.000]
queen.

[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.300]
942 at 560 rhymes with the Q942.

[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:46.580]
Let me tell you about a place you'll love.

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.100]
Pizza love.

[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.760]
I'm sure most of you if you've eaten there but if you haven't what are you waiting for?

[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:55.460]
Two-broward locations and Jeff Cohen continues to be the mastermind of delicious food at

[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.480]
teeny tiny prices.

[00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:59.220]
That's why the rumors go there all the time because the price is right.

[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.620]
Especially for them.

[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.460]
Every Monday night at the loft is Lasagna night two days egg plant night by one of these

[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:06.320]
dinners on these nights get the second for only five bucks.

[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.300]
Wednesday a kids eat feed with it all second seed Jeff's famous magic show like tonight.

[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:14.160]
Every Thursday is bike night at both pizza lot locations come on a motorcycle.

[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.800]
Why put off by one dinner get the second one for half price.

[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.620]
And of course the dinners are sensational.

[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:22.420]
If you want to try a little Vistula event get a combination dinner chicken and veal and

[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:22.660]
seafood.

[00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.940]
They got three different kinds of great pizza including that spicy Fuganza pizza.

[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.400]
They got Calzone super subs the best garlic rolls I guarantee you've ever put in your ugly

[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:30.680]
pus.

[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.340]
So if you want like I said delicious Italian goodies at very inexpensive prices take the

[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:38.360]
whole gang for lunch dinner late nights snacks to either brow or location of the pizza

[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:38.580]
lot.

[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.940]
They're in Davy a university drive between Griffith and 595 that's probably where you'll

[00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:44.160]
see the rumors eat a lot of free meals.

[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.320]
That's right in the pizza lot plies up kitty corner armadillo cafe behind period and I

as his envoys to meet with the US president George W the Pope said the day of fasting today

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.040]

rerun on small bill it's only the first week in March and I'll read their show and reruns at a

[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:00.820]
disgrace an absolute disgrace what TV does to us they come up with maybe like a half a dozen new

[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:04.260]
episodes for each of these shows every year maybe if we're lucky and the rest of it they just

[00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:08.480]
filler stuff they just you know throw it in there and you'll shut up and like it right just just

[00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:14.440]
to kill time they throw crap in there like all of America yeah like that five six seven oh five

[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:19.720]
60 pun this is not starting off real exciting here today you know what I would as Anne Tarkticae

[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:25.120]
went went on asking to be clever we're asking like a real I realized it's not funny it's not

[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:32.300]
amusing it's not hysterical it's not a panic but it is interesting and I and I realized that

[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:36.040]
also we deal with a lot of very parochial people for a place that's as transitive south Florida

[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:40.180]
and a place that's got as many people who have come from other places they sure have a lot of like

[00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:45.340]
nobody goes anywhere you know right people that haven't been more than two blocks from home

[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.620]
like George here's at least recently here's Miami hello

[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:58.140]
me oh Miami yes sir hey me how you doing okay uh for your poll I got uh got a possibility how about

[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:01.760]
Alaska you see oh if people taking those Alaska increases supposed to be gorgeous up there

[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.000]
and that's the one place in a world you'd want to go if you had a champion the unlimited amount

[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:14.180]
of money you could get a ticket to anywhere you wanted that's the one place you'd go yeah so I

[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.700]
question for you Neil how come you're always talking about Tom Welling and Tom Welling's feet I

[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:21.360]
have been listening for a long time he always seemed to bring up that subject

[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:29.900]
how come I'm always talking about Tom Welling and his feet yeah did I bring that up today or

[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.480]
did you bring it up today you brought up Tom Welling and yesterday right before the end of the show

[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.980]
you brought him up and he seems every time you bring him up you talk about the guy's feet he's got

[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:43.800]
big feet yes or what size 14 so what piece of information you don't care about Tom Welling's

[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:52.240]
not really well I do and I hope you have a good time in Alaska like that line in the movie I had

[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:57.620]
a lousy time in Yugoslavia remember Jack lemon what that was in the movie mass appeal very good

[00:46:57.620 --> 00:47:04.020]
Charles Durning was the priest the father and I had a lousy time in Yugoslavia and he like slams

[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:10.840]
the door walks out nice go he was great boy Jack lemon yes dead Charles Durning and now he's

[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:14.640]
still alive please tell me he's still alive he's probably not no you don't think so he's fat

[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:19.300]
is he he's either last fat living person who's not a talk person on QA

[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:26.540]
gotta be five six seven I'll tell you so far this poll is going no place fast so you know I mean

[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.220]
these are the worst solutions and it's kind of I'm always talking about Tom Welling and his

[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:34.980]
feet because I feel like it okay maybe like to lick his feet or lick something okay and got a

[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:39.560]
stupid question everybody knows why right because if you have big feet supposedly you got a big

[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.580]
penis okay I like Tom Welling he's lovely he's beautiful okay guarantee looks a lot better

[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:50.540]
than you do sir God what a schmuck but he wants to go to Alaska I think I think with your personality

[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.080]
in your common sense it'd be a perfect place for okay somewhere in a wilderness somewhere you can

[00:47:55.080 --> 00:48:00.360]
only get by boat what's the one place in the world you've never been to you want to visit most

[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:04.520]
Prague and New Zealand are the choices for me and George and even the age of from the goddess

[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:09.700]
as you want to go see the pyramids and that's it in a half an hour we're building one hell of a

[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.620]
what's the one place in a world you've never been to that you want to visit the most prognos

[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:40.120]
in the egypt so far that's it maybe that'll be the whole list i don't know what's going in

[00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:45.520]
and uh it's a good choice i think who did Miguel and he said Ibiza Ibiza

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:51.080]
see did he say Ibiza we'll list the people there speak with us yeah Ibiza is supposed to be

[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.180]
pretty hot place that's what i hear so we're putting Ibiza on the list that's a good place

[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.520]
how come all the good suggestions are coming from inside the building and the audience is

[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:05.120]
usual a bunch of losers man i'm gonna go to Alaska and Antarctica uh vatavia new york uh boy

[00:52:05.580 --> 00:52:09.580]
what about your losers all i was anyway talking about my psychic powers yeah

[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:15.200]
so i was thinking about doing a poll again because i screwed it up last year when we did it i did a

[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.220]
really bad job i was in a saramu that day somebody ate my cornflake to pee in my uh some of these

[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.740]
but anyway uh the thing about the most beautiful actress all right and i was thinking of myself we

[00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:31.780]
could do this one and just say movies or television actress right and i'm thinking well that'll

[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.740]
eliminate britain because she's not an actress so i'm channel surfing yesterday on this movie over

[00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.460]
the channels right and there's some cheesy movie that she made last year right we don't know what

[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:46.480]
the name of that is uh crossing over crossing whatever it was in it's true you know now i

[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:50.320]
watched it for like 15 seconds to make sure it was her which it was yeah probably we watched it a

[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:55.060]
lot longer i'm sure but i was more interested in finding out about time wellings feet but nevertheless

[00:52:55.060 --> 00:53:00.640]
so i guess if we ever do do do do that it'll have to she'll have to be in there although she's not

[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.620]
an actress just because she was in a movie oh man is she an actress no she's not a single

[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:10.140]
i figure part need is Madonna just because you made a movie that doesn't make you an actress right

[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:15.660]

[01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:05.280]

[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:45.400]
what a spectacular place see we have done pulls in the past and we've asked people where are the

[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.860]
most beautiful people in the world you know like what country but why are we talking to these people

[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:54.520]
about that because most have never been more than 10 blocks from how they're house anyway you know

[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.000]
the same right I mean we've got some people are world travelers far more so than me but we also have

[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.900]

[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:11.240]
like a major journey an adventure not exactly the greatest world travelers in South Florida so what

[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:17.660]

saying Germany oh wow see I could say a whole bunch of places either they're you're fueling

[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:29.800]
that attitude then you keep saying that they're going to think that's the most racist concept that

[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:35.400]
they worked it worked seriously the people in Berlin and Kelow knows the only two German cities

[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.060]
