[00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.300]
See this one I don't want to say it because I can't do it justice.

[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.640]

[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.220]
It's got a lot of competition.

[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.600]
Come on.

[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.000]

[00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.780]

One for eight is so hard.

[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.840]
It's Friday you bastards where you're fudge packet.

[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.060]
I'll write man dog in the rest of know having a yet.

[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.820]
But we're just we're just getting going now.

[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.660]
You follow my it's my friend.

[00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.140]
I follow you know speaking of this thing in the

[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.740]
Mandage key chain in the impending fundraiser and everything.

[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.660]
Yes already since we were talking about you know what we're doing.

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.240]
Already people are talking about which key chain if we're going to do a key chain and.

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.540]
Well, I've already discussed this because I'm sure I know exactly where you're going.

[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.780]
But I already said no.

[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.460]
Yeah, but in fact I don't think he was the one that said no.

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.400]
I think that somebody mixed it before it actually got back to

[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.900]
Maul right that's what I'm getting that I think that now maybe that he and I are so tight right.

[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.500]
Those are balls.

[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.840]
I think maybe we might just lighten up a little bit.

[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.000]
I think it would be criminal if we did a key chain and it wasn't that.

[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.380]
Especially since we're going to raise money for charity again for one of the

[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.360]
Dorgie charities again who could have a problem with that and especially since he's a dog lover.

[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.160]
He's got a dog right and he's got that doggy here piece.

[00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.740]
What are you saying, Maul?

[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.300]
Those are balls.

[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.420]
Come on.

[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.280]
Huh?

[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.160]
I think we should work on that.

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.020]
Come on, Maul.

[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.820]
Won't you consider?

[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.660]
The other boss.

[00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:24.000]
Okay.

[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.780]
He's going to be as a boss and all.

[00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.500]
What a softie.

[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.260]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound.

[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.840]
You know, he talked to the powers that people they're scared of him.

[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.300]
They're scared I can understand why but they're afraid that they're terrified.

[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.620]
It's for charity, Maul.

[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.480]
I know you go along with it.

[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:37.440]
We would do the same for him.

[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.860]
Sure.

[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.440]
When we do the same for him.

[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.500]
We do something for him.

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.900]
Absolutely.

[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.120]

[00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:54.800]
Because I think he says gangster here.

[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.280]
Wait a minute.

[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.160]
I can find it.

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.300]
Yo, Maul, what's up with you?

[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.220]
Got some a spoiler.

[00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.240]
Excellent.

[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.400]
Hey, I like the Charlton Hathen you.

[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.260]
It's kind of a big.

[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.180]
Okay, thanks.

[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.260]
Poor Charlton Hathen.

[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.480]
He's shot.

[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.700]
Actually, it's interesting because it says on it and whoever put this in here,

[00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:13.860]
gangster mispocha.

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.600]
Right?

[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.820]
Which is how it's always easy to find.

[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.820]
Because I know how it's spelled in there.

[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:18.960]
But gangster.

[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.320]
Yo, Maul, what's up with you?

[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.240]
Got some a spoiler.

[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.320]
So obviously, that was put in there by Goiim.

[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.580]
10.56 and 5.60 QAM.

[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.540]
I am.

[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.780]
This is course where you'll buy city QAM.

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:34.540]
It's Friday.

[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.860]
You first.

[00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.680]
Okay, coming up on 11 o'clock at 5.60 W.C.

[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.080]
I'm not sure.

[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.460]
I hope now.

[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.120]
Do you tell Dave that I put him on hold or not?

[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.660]
No.

[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.820]
See what I mean?

[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.580]
He's like totally out to lunch.

[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:46.300]
You there, Dave?

[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:47.280]
I am.

[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.280]
Thank goodness.

[00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.400]
Yeah, I knew that he'd be patient enough because I have no technical way of picking it up and talking to you in our board officer.

[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.380]
Pages who little actually talk to the people on the phone.

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.420]
So you know I was here.

[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.080]
Hey, I got a winner for you this year, Dave.

[00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.900]
Who is it?

[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:00.960]
I have the winner.

[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.160]
Well, don't say who was it and we're going to put you on a spot first.

[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.300]
I am not picking the truck.

[00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:05.280]
I'm through with that game.

[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.780]
Why would I get out in this?

[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.420]
This is the voice of the Kentucky Derby since regret one.

[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.660]
It wasn't in 1915.

[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.780]
There's a rumor that I was here for the first one in 1875.

[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:16.600]
It's not true.

[00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.700]
No, that wasn't you.

[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:18.580]
That was Mohawar David.

[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.820]
Who used to watch Ty Cobb a plane as a little child.

[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:23.780]
He enjoyed that so much.

[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.040]
Anyway, I'll tell you who I like.

[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.720]
Indian Express, the Bob Latter Horse, written by Tyler Bayes.

[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.240]
I picked that.

[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.300]
I'm going to use that horse in my exact as I think he could go right to the front and never look back.

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.680]
But I think he might get caught though.

[00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.500]
Do you really?

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.020]
Yeah, I like him, player maker.

[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.320]
I think he hasn't won his best race yet.

[00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.200]
So I think the best is yet to come for that horse.

[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.600]
Taking the easy route out again, Dave.

[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.320]
Taking the truck.

[00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.700]
Six to five in the morning line.

[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:54.680]
I didn't, you know, the aradzi was the biggest favorite before this horse.

[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.340]
And I'm telling you, this horse might even win the triple crown.

[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.020]
Out of the 12 hole in a big field.

[00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:03.700]
Well, let's see.

[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:06.420]
Let's see.

[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.220]
I got a great, I got a great column here from the Boston Globe this morning because I did a little bit of my homework.

[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:12.980]
Yeah.

[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.240]
And it's all about this horse in the express.

[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:21.380]
It says express appears on a fast track and it tells the story about how Lafitte Pinkard Jr.

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.500]
picked the horse out and turned Bob Afford onto him.

[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.160]
And bottom part of his own story.

[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.260]
I mean, you know, this is the wildest story in the express.

[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.180]
There are 30,000 falls a year registered.

[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.080]
And in 2000, there were only 106 registered from the state of Utah.

[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:46.320]
I mean, this horse grew up on a tough ranch with rattlesnakes and coyotes and things.

[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.160]
He's a tough mother.

[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.880]
I'm telling you.

[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.840]
I sure hope he's got a better disposition than Dick Cheney.

[00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:54.740]
You know, the owner is?

[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:57.120]
Who is the owner, George?

[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.700]
A Phil Chas of Chas Records.

[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.480]
Oh, that's right.

[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.360]
The head of Chas Records is the owner of the horse.

[00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.700]
That's right because it's in the story.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:06.140]
He's 81 years old and he loves to bet.

[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.340]
Well, who the hell doesn't?

[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.100]
Let's hope we make it to 81, Neil.

[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.340]
And of course, listen, you and I will be doing these things for 30, 40 years, making no mistake about it.

[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.640]
I'm third, man.

[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.200]
I've rediscovered radio, so boy, am I happy?

[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:24.640]
What do you mean by that?

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:25.360]
Oh, that's right.

[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.260]
I'm on the radio.

[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.440]
I understand that.

[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:27.920]
So am I.

[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.280]
Of course, I was always on a radio.

[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.180]
He used to be on TV.

[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.960]
So one of us is moving in a wrong direction.

[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.280]
But when you got that kind of cash, what difference does it make?

[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.940]
Just laugh all the way to the bank.

[00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.860]
And not only that, but you probably still have that old...

[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.660]
You could probably, as an heirloom, get that old Howard Coussell hair piece.

[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.180]
Get that on the mouth, balls.

[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:44.680]
Huh?

[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.600]
I was thinking about this yesterday.

[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.460]
You know, we all have our cross-the-bearing life.

[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.620]
I've got more Howard David than you had Howard Coussell.

[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.680]
I had Howard Coussell for what he was tough.

[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.240]
We've all got one Howard in our life, one too many.

[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.600]
So you're picking, you're sticking with the Empire Maker, Jerry Bailey.

[00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:00.740]
Right through the triple crown.

[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.120]
He's going to win it all.

[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.780]
Really?

[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.140]
Oh, we've heard this from you before.

[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.220]
When?

[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.040]
About every year.

[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.720]
Every year we have the same conversation.

[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.780]
We could put it on tape.

[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.980]
And I usually get sucked into doing the same thing.

[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.680]
But not this year.

[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.800]
Indian Express written by a 20-year-old Tavar Bayes.

[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:18.580]
He's 18.

[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.160]
It says in my story, he's 20.

[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:21.800]
He's 18.

[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:22.760]
He's 18.

[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.100]
You sure you just still won him?

[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:24.920]
It says,

[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:26.240]
He's written by Tavar Bayes.

[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.600]
A 20-year-old is that, yeah, I'm not touching that line.

[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.080]
He's written by Tavar Bayes.

[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.140]
A 20-year-old is never written in the Kentucky Derby.

[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.800]
Now, is he the son of Russell Bayes?

[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:35.460]
No.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.160]
I think he's a cousin of Gary Bayes.

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:39.420]
I see.

[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.900]
But that's a racing family.

[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:43.320]
A lot of history, California.

[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.140]
And evidently, a lot of bases out there on a West Coast.

[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.400]
Okay, well, we're going to write these down and we'll do the same thing.

[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.420]
But I'd imagine you're a 50 grand away on each one.

[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.360]
And we'll see who comes out head the other triple crown.

[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.420]
Very good.

[00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:58.020]
Have you run into our close personal friend Hank out there yet?

[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.720]
I saw him, but we had a bowl of soup together yet today.

[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.000]
And this is just so much fun to come to the Derby.

[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.580]
And talk horses with Hank.

[00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.440]
And we talked about you.

[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.140]
I knew my ears were burning.

[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:14.380]
Those ratings are enormous.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.980]
I'm glad to hear it.

[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.380]
Well, everybody's going to have something big in their life.

[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.040]
You know what I'm saying, Dave?

[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.680]
Okay, listen.

[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:21.100]
Toronto.

[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:22.280]
How's it going, Ferrin?

[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:23.440]
Are you still in Toronto?

[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.360]
I'm in Toronto.

[00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.240]
I'm disease-free.

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.180]
Everything is great here.

[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.460]
Tell everybody you know to come on up with no problem here.

[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.200]
Everybody's happy.

[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.780]
Nobody run around with masks.

[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.100]
Everything is great.

[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.020]
That's great.

[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.540]
And believe me, we need to cash.

[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.780]
I'll see you at Goodvine, Dave.

[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.060]
Okay. Good luck.

[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.260]
Talk to you for the breakfast.

[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:39.780]
Take care.

[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.160]
Thanks.

[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.360]
Dave Johnson, great guy.

[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.200]
Great race, scholar.

[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.380]
Indian Express.

[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.020]
And you saw you had picked the same thing, huh?

[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.280]
Yeah, based on that, because Ken was telling me about that.

[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.640]
I was having him help me.

[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:52.520]
And he told me, Ken Maldon.

[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.400]
Right, Ken Maldon.

[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.400]
How's Ken doing?

[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:55.200]
He's doing great.

[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.240]
It's a lot pappy-pappy.

[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.600]
Take care of yourself, Ken.

[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.540]
Watch your back in that place.

[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.580]
Ken Maldon, he's a survivor.

[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.880]
You know, there's some people who are survivors, and there are other people like, you know, fall by the wayside.

[00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:08.480]
Now, ask me and Dave Johnson and Ken Maldon, survivors.

[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:10.600]
Thought you believe me?

[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:10.920]
No.

[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:13.580]
Don't let me forget.

[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:14.340]
I'm going to read that article.

[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.120]
I'm looking at the faxes that came over here.

[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.580]
Let's see.

[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.600]
The Schmidt Meister may be getting fired for posting the Toplis Zeta Jones pictures on his website.

[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.820]
Toplis was smoking...

[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.220]
What does that say?

[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:28.120]
Pregard.

[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.580]
Oh, I'll...

[00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.560]
Oh, Toplis was smoking Pregard.

[00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:32.860]
The last two letters are...

[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.700]
The smoking gun.com as the paper worked filed by his lawyer against the Chief Channel.

[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.040]
More importantly, what's his website so I can see those pictures?

[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.080]
I don't know.

[00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.040]
We want the website immediately if not sooner.

[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.240]
So, Billy in Boca, please pass again.

[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.240]
In Currie, Mike, Bob, type of the other pictures.

[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.020]
What is it?

[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.100]
Tophless.com.

[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:55.700]
And speaking of Tophless and the clueless, Scroan has a memo now.

[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.720]
I'm excited to announce the having of Curtis Raymond.

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.120]
There's the new Sports Hales Manager of WDQAM.

[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.760]
Welcome to the family, Curtis, whoever the hell you are.

[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.540]
Can't let her.

[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.240]
Another...

[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:06.240]

[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:07.720]
Another...

[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.480]
Curtis will oversee.

[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.620]
I love the way she's got two separate words overseas.

[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:12.760]
This is our sales manager.

[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.420]
Okay, boys and girls, she can't spell.

[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:19.940]
Curtis will oversee all sponsorship sales of the Dolphins, Pathas, Marlins and Canes.

[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.760]
Curtis comes to WDQAM after 10 years at infinity sports Boston

[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.520]
as sales manager in the New England Patriots and Boston Bruins Radio Networks.

[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:28.720]
Oh, this guy won't last long.

[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.720]
He thinks he's going to stick around after 10 years in Boston.

[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.280]
He's going to stick around her very long.

[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.060]
And he probably don't even know about...

[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:35.200]
Roy and that stuff.

[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.020]
And about her being plastered at that Dolphin thing.

[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:39.760]
Or is it the Marlin?

[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.980]
Whatever it was, a PP Park.

[00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.860]
Please join me in welcoming Curtis to the QM family, says,

[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:44.820]
Guran, welcome Curtis.

[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:45.280]
Welcome.

[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.680]
Whoever the hell you are.

[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.340]
That is amazing.

[00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.840]
It's just like a revolving door we got here in sales in and out and in.

[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.160]
And I'll wish of course this Guran especially in and out.

[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.400]
Should I be disarticle again now?

[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:57.760]
Please.

[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.440]
I mean, I'm sure we'll have some more additions for the pool,

[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.340]
but we talked to Dave Johnson.

[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:02.700]
We got our picks in for the Derby.

[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.480]
He's there with the Humbermletty.

[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.340]
And I'm glad he said I had a bowl of soup with that.

[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:07.800]
You know what I said?

[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.980]
I'm glad he told him to say that.

[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.880]
Because we've got to keep Hank alive.

[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.420]
He has re-even right on the head.

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:13.880]
He didn't say why.

[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.700]
I just think it might have been a cheese onion soup.

[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.280]
So what's wrong with that?

[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.020]
That's still okay.

[00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.520]
You're not going to get fat from meeting a bowl of soup.

[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.780]
Believe you me, it's all the accoutrements that go with it.

[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.340]
Crackers.

[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.420]
Don't eat no crackers.

[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.660]
Crackers are for going.

[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.240]
Derek Z. Jackson in the Boston gloves.

[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.440]
He even comes back to Boston.

[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:32.460]
Jerry Williams just died.

[00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:35.340]
We got Curtis Raymond, our new sports hails managers from Boston.

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.620]
And at least he worked there for 10 years.

[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.260]
And this article from the Boston Globe.

[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.120]
As we're trying to present another picture to you

[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:44.140]
while the endless media pep rally goes on.

[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:45.780]
All the people with the pom-poms out there.

[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:47.660]
That's what it is.

[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.880]
It's an endless pep rally.

[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.080]
It's all spin all day.

[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.620]
All good news, man.

[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.020]
Everything that, that, that, that.

[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.000]
Oh, we got to play that again.

[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.760]
What is that?

[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:55.520]
Stars and Strips?

[00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.100]
Yes. It should be in yours too.

[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.060]
Is it in mine?

[00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:58.760]
I think so.

[00:14:58.820 --> 00:14:59.520]
Oh, I never knew that.

[00:14:59.640 --> 00:14:59.940]
Oh, it is.

[00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.120]
Oh, yeah!

[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:02.840]
Oh, yeah!

[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:03.380]
Oh!

[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:03.820]
Oh!

[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:04.660]
Oh!

[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:06.040]
Oh!

[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:06.060]
Oh!

[00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:07.560]
Oh!

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.600]

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.600]

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.600]

[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:07.600]

[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:08.600]
Oh!

[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:12.540]
Okay.

[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.260]
Defense CEOs are big winners of Iraq War.

[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:16.840]
Is this article?

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:18.940]
I'll try to read it even better than I read yesterday,

[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.740]
which won't take much.

[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.260]
More than 130 American soldiers died in a dubious war

[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.680]
in a dusty oil rich land.

[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:27.680]
In dust-free boardrooms, the CEOs behind our bombs,

[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:29.680]
missiles, tanks, and planes went to corporate heaven.

[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.920]
On the dust, 12 teenagers paid the ultimate sacrifice.

[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.300]
In the boardroom, men in their 50s and 60s

[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.420]
filled their sacks with cash.

[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.760]
12 soldiers will never see 20.

[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.440]
At least 13 weapons executives

[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:42.640]
took home more than 20 million dollars in compensation

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.960]
since 2000.

[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.440]
The young paid dearly, middle-aged and graying CEOs were dearly paid.

[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.300]
Neither the clouds of dust or the closed doors of the boardroom

[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:52.140]
can hide the bankruptcy.

[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.580]
The Boston-based watchdog group united for a fair economy,

[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:58.820]
known in general for its reports on the vast pay gap

[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.880]
between CEOs and workers, this week published a report

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:05.180]
on the even more insane gap between soldiers and weapons CEOs.

[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.920]
Using federal corporate and think tank data,

[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:09.640]
the group found that while the average army

[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.220]
private-interracurance about $20,000 a year,

[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:16.300]
the average CEO among the 37 largest publicly traded defense contractors

[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.680]
made 577 times more money in 2000,

[00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.380]
$11.3 million and that's the average.

[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.800]
Since 2000, the 37 defense contractors CEOs

[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.420]
actually given our first strike war,

[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.700]
it is more appropriate to refer them as offense contractors,

[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.420]
have taken home $1.35 billion.

[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.700]
That may not be Bill Gates,

[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.760]
but it still means that just 37 men have made enough money

[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.900]
in the last three years to, for instance, pay for two years

[00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.340]
of running the Boston public schools.

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:44.920]
Meanwhile, everyone knows how the budget cuts have turned

[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.020]
public school systems into their own little bagdads,

[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.080]
because their government say there's no more money

[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.220]
after war, tax cuts, corporate giveaways, and sports stadiums.

[00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.140]
In a less predatory America,

[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.980]
it would be rude to brag about financial winners

[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.760]
as a result of the terrorist attacks of 9-11-2001

[00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.940]
and the attack on Iraq.

[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.620]
Yet between Homeland Security, Afghanistan,

[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.580]
destroying Iraq and rebuilding Iraq,

[00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.660]
it was hard to tell whether offense contractors

[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.980]
were patriotic eagles or bouncing vultures.

[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:12.200]
Sacrifice, not one the 11.3 million dollar average

[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.120]
pay-of-offence industry executives is nearly $4 million a year

[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.220]
more than the average for the largest 365 companies

[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:19.340]
surveyed by business week.

[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.880]
CEO Pay-A-Lockheed Martin went up from $5.8 million

[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.300]
in 2000 to $25.3 million in 2002.

[00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.640]
It went up a general dynamics tanks and submarines

[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.940]
from $5.7 million in 2001 to $15.2 million in 2002.

[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.520]
It went up at Honeywell Aircraft from 12-9 to $45 million in 2002.

[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:43.220]
It went up at Northcraft, an Northrop Grumman from $7.3 to $9.2 million in 2002.

[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.180]
Pay-Winup at a lion, bullets and bombs from $1.4 million in 2000

[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:49.340]
to $10.5 million in 2002.

[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.740]
It went up at Cardinal Health Medical Supplies

[00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.660]
from $2.9 million in 2001 to $17.7 million in 2002.

[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.840]
It went up at United Defense Industries Guns and Cannons

[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.340]
from $794,000 in 2000 to $2.7 million in 2002.

[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:08.140]
At Raytheon, missiles and bombs who went from $8 million in 2000,

[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.300]
down to $2.6 million in 2001 and back up to $8.9 million in 2002.

[00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.340]
In a radio address in May 1940 during the Defense Buildup

[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.580]
Party, West entry into WW2, President Roosevelt said,

[00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.940]
our present emergency in a common sense of decency make it imperative

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:26.580]
that no new group of warmen in Ershul come into being in this nation

[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:28.340]
as a result of the struggles abroad.

[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.320]
The American people will not dwell as the idea of any American citizen growing rich in fat

[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.700]
in an emergency of blood and slaughter and human suffering.

[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.920]
In the same speech Roosevelt also said,

[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:41.440]
we must make sure in all that we do that there be no breakdown or cancellation

[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.140]
of any of the great social gains which we made in these past years.

[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.920]
We've carried on an offensive on a broad front against social and economic inequalities

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.160]
and abuses which had made our society weak.

[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.640]
That offensive should not now be broken down by the Pinchers movement of those

[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.820]
who would use the present needs of physical military defense to destroy it.

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.880]
Six decades later, war millionaires run the country,

[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.840]
whether that be Vice President Dick Cheney's old connections to Haliburton

[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.080]
for the $13.6 million at Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman,

[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.420]
General Dynamics Raytheon and United Technologies have given in political contributions since 2000.

[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:16.260]
Military spending after falling from $320.9 million to $266.96

[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:18.440]
has sorted the $400 million level.

[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.700]
As the war millionaires saw using the majestic patriotic mass of eagles

[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.840]
to disguise the ugly vulture waiting for a handout,

[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:29.400]
the U.S. is creating a new definition of friendly fire for the budget broadsides

both as a result of America's struggles abroad and it's abandonment of the struggle at home.

[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:41.440]
There you go.

[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.640]
It was worth re-reading.

[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.140]
Have you noticed what a much better reading was?

[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.240]
Yes, much.

I have no life.

[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:12.080]
I have no cavities, I have no taste.

[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.020]
Bye bye bye!

[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.420]
You son of a bitch.

[00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:21.500]
I have no life.

[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.740]
I went to the South City party,

[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:27.980]
I was invited by the priest.

[00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.420]
He said, turn with me,

[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.960]
I have some friends to see back in the,

[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.640]
for red durian.

[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.460]
When we got to the South City party,

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.540]
there were some other priests in the book.

[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.700]
Then he dropped his pants and said,

[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:45.960]
be a good lad,

[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:48.460]
your face I want and stuff.

[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:52.020]
And I realized now,

[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.400]
I didn't do very well.

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.720]
You see, because the priest couldn't get all,

[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.160]
so he had to please himself.

[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.460]
I want to go home.

[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.100]
I want to go home.

[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:16.440]
I want to go home.

[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.640]
Then the priest at the South City party said,

[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.560]
have faith son, try again.

[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:23.940]
Shoot them in the land.

[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.200]
Then he said,

[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.440]
let me go get, try to understand.

[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.580]
He said, there's something I must remind you,

[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.700]
before you give it another chance.

[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.320]
The holy men who wrote the Bible,

[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.440]
were wearing any pants.

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.820]
Now I'm alright now.

[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.080]
I can do that very well.

[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.340]
I put my pants.

[00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.460]
I can please say it was,

[00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.160]
and I won't go to hell.

[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.540]
God there's so many of these.

[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:03.800]
1118 to 560 to 8KWM.

[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.440]
Charlton has been robbing Tom and the Beats.

[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.900]
We got that on and out and you son of a bitch.

[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:08.660]
Charlton has been got it.

[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.060]
Shoot them in the leg.

[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:11.520]
Got it.

[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.060]
I pooped my pants.

[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:14.860]
Okay, maybe you did.

[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.940]
I pooped my pants.

[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:18.840]
Been there done that.

[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.880]
How about one of my favorites,

[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.440]
and especially now it was so appropriate.

[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.040]
The needy-ass is sick and you talk badly.

[00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:29.200]
Okay, like it.

[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.740]
In case you're too many in mainstream,

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:31.960]
wonder what the hell we're talking about.

[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:32.940]
Our poll question today,

[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.980]
what's your favorite expression or product you've got

[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:35.920]
from the Neorodger show?

[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.240]
Got it?

[00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:38.660]
We got it.

[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:39.560]
I do like it.

[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.000]
The needy-ass is sick and you talk badly.

[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.560]
And then somebody, it's a mole one.

[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.220]
I thought they'd probably like this.

[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.040]
If there's a butt.

[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.740]
If there's a butt, I smell it.

[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:51.980]
I think that deserves to be on there.

[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.140]
What about Sally Fitz?

[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:58.180]
I realize I'm asking for an awful lot here.

[00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.920]
And of course I have no idea what's eventually going to show.

[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:00.780]
How about Harry Carey?

[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.420]
They deal.

[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:02.440]
Fuck you.

[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:02.740]
Huh?

[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:03.880]
No?

[00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:04.300]
Yeah.

[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.460]
And certainly what about...

[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.300]
Get off, get me fired up when I hear someone say that.

[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:10.660]

[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.960]
And then Peter, who sent us this lengthy list,

[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.840]
is I voted for...

[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:16.680]
I'm third man.

[00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:17.660]
Which he says is the best.

[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.620]
I tend to agree.

[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.560]
I think I voted for that.

[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.060]
What'd you vote for?

[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:22.340]
Okay.

[00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:23.840]
But that's right.

[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:24.980]
Ah-han, that was your choice.

[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.700]
This story, I think we ought to put it on the website.

[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.380]
But we'll save it for tomorrow, KBN, boy.

[00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:31.200]
Sure.

[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.480]
But you already got enough for the handle.

[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:34.360]
No.

[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.080]
April 11, Kuditha, linked to U.S. President George W. Bush,

[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.980]
Dirty Wars team.

[00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.520]
This is something somebody faxed in this morning

[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:47.460]
from a great website, vheadline.com.

[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.860]
A venet whalen related this story.

[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.380]
London's observer newspapers is the April 11, Kuditha,

[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.840]
against the democratically elected government

[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.060]
of President Hugo Chavez-Frias, has been linked to U.S. President

[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.080]
George W. Bush's team, specialised in the Dirty Wars

[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.000]
of the 80s encouraged the plotters who tried to

[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.020]
try to topple President Chavez, where its observer

[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.320]
world view corresponded to Edville, Yami from New York.

[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.640]
The observer has established that the failed coup in Venezuela

[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.300]
was closely tied to senior officials of the U.S. government.

[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.920]
They have long histories in the Dirty Wars of the 80s

[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.300]
and links to death squads working in Central America at that time.

[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.320]
Oh, this sounds like that thing about Guadamala

[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.480]
was talking about just the everyday.

[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:24.900]
See?

[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:26.660]
Remember that I did see it.

[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.100]
So, well, that'll be on the website tomorrow.

[00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.780]
We got to say it holds something back.

[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.540]
But speaking anyway of that sausage party,

[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.040]
please have played that, is we got a couple other stories

[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:35.900]
that were faxed in.

[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.260]
Not that we're looking for these, but they seem to be popping up.

[00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.580]
These priest stories, they seem to be popping up

[00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:41.860]
all over the place if I can say that.

[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:43.360]
Toledo.

[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.920]
A Roman Catholic priest and high school religion teacher

[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:48.360]
was charged with possessing child pornography.

[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:52.840]
The Reverend Stephen G. Rogers, no relation, 54,

[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.360]
has been on leave since U.S. Custom Service Investigators

[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.200]
searched his sleeve at Toledo, home in December.

[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.680]
The single cow was filed Wednesday this week in U.S. District

[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.220]
court under a legal procedure that does not require

[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.300]
a grand jury investigation.

[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:07.240]
If convicted, the maximum sentence is five years in prison

[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.820]
and a $250,000 fine.

[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.980]
The priest did not wish to comment said as attorney.

[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.600]
Rogers recently completed a residential therapy program

[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.160]
and the diocese of Toledo is cooperating with the investigation.

[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.980]
He continues to be on leave until this whole issue

[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.120]
that's built with a W. White.

[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.960]
This whole issue is resolved,

[00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:27.760]
brilliant city's not in the active industry.

[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.560]
Rogers subscribed away child pornography website

[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:33.400]
from December 23rd, 98 to June 27th, 2001.

[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.980]
The San Descunative was ordained in June 1995

[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.380]
and previously served as an associate

[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:40.040]
at Pranster, Wilcozano, in Toledo.

[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:41.400]
And you like that?

[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.980]
Another one was the superb priest and Los Angeles.

[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:49.200]
Pransecute is filed five more felony sex abuse charges

[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.920]
against the former Roman Catholic priest

[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.200]
after a former altibor came forward to say the clerk molested him

[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.620]
at least 168 times before he turned 18.

[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.120]
But you get that number, huh?

[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.160]
You get that number.

[00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:03.740]
The church?

[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.520]
He must have been 168.

[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.040]
He must have been keeping track of every sport of the world.

[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.640]
Hashmarts.

[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.120]
Yeah, that might be it.

[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.080]
One, two, three, three, three, four.

[00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:16.780]
Michael Steven Baker, 55, now faces a total of 34 felony charges.

[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.820]
He's already scheduled to stand for all on 13 counts of loot,

[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.300]
acts upon a child under age 14 and 16 counts of oral copulation

[00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:24.820]
with a minor.

[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.800]
He must have been in that Kunstorganization oral as moral.

[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:31.060]
Baker was played innocent.

[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.580]
The new counts stem from testimony to a preliminary hang by

[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.700]
alleged victim Matthew Severus in 35,

[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.640]
who said he were, oh, geez, who said he was repeatedly abused

[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.200]
by Baker in church rectumries.

[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.280]
He said the abuse began when it was seven or eight years old.

[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.560]
Baker declined to comment Wednesday.

[00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.460]
His arrangement was postponed till May 20th,

[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.940]
so his lawyer, Donald Styer, can review the preliminary hearing transcript.

[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.640]
Styer said it was unlikely a jury would be swayed by the five new charges.

[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:01.240]
Okay, I just mentioned that in passing.

[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.500]
And for those who like him young,

[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:06.720]
and the son sent them today,

[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.340]
two Lake Worth women charged with having sex parties with young boys.

[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:10.900]
All right.

[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:15.600]
Lake Worth, an elementary school employee and a Girl Scout worker,

[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.500]
I wonder if she was selling them cookies?

[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.040]
Yeah, thin mints.

[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:26.140]
In fact, that would be a possibility for the,

[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.480]
and Jennifer Remdesyres, how about...

[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.180]
Can't beat that date or me.

[00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:30.480]
Huh?

[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:31.900]
Right?

[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:32.200]
Don't think?

[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:32.640]
Sure.

[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.700]
I mean, that doesn't fit this story.

[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.580]
This story is more like...

[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.040]
Want a lollipop little boy?

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.880]
But I think Jennifer Rem definitely belongs on our survey today with...

[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.620]
Can beat that date or me.

[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.080]
Lake Worth, an elementary school employee and a Girl Scout worker provided alcohol

[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:51.040]
watched adult movies and had sex with minors at parties they hosted

[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:53.840]
while one woman's husband was at work authority, so yesterday,

[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:57.280]
Amy Dwayne, a data entry processor

[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.320]
and discovery key elementary school west of Lake Worth,

[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:02.440]
was arrested when's the in charge with lood acts on a child under 16

[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.960]
and providing alcohol to persons under the age of 21?

[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:09.660]
Alligations of the escape surface staff to sheriff's officials

[00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:14.420]
learned that Dwayne 37 and far have hosted several parties over a four-month period at Dwayne's home.

[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.900]
Authority said the woman provided McCarty, Rums, Murau, Vodka, and Beer

[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:24.420]
to the boys ages 12 to 14, under the condition they invited by Amy's rule.

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.640]
She was concerned they wouldn't get two drunk sheriff's spokesman Paul Millar said of the rule.

[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.700]
At one of their parties in March Dwayne watched a pay-per-view movie with a 13-year-old

[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.940]
seduced him had intercourse with an official said,

[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.240]
another time far have had sex with a 16-year-old.

[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.560]
It's shocking. No question about it Millar said this is pretty serious, very unusual.

[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.100]
I'm not saying it hasn't happened before. Oh, no Schmidt.

[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:49.360]
Dwayne was released from Caledia Wednesday on $15,000 as bought a judge

[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.620]
or to the mother of three not to have any contact with the victims

[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:54.100]
and have only supervised contract with her own children.

[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:59.220]
Steven got her a dresser and like worth, she'll be reassigned from her $18,000

[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.200]
a year job, a routine procedure pending the outgoing investigation said her principal,

[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.660]
Steven Sills, not still Steven Guttler.

[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:10.800]
Far have worked in a registration capacity for the Girl Scouts Authority said

[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:15.280]
neither woman supervised children in the job, none of the boys involved attended discovery official said.

[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:21.100]
Dwayne's husband, a firefighter, is not suspected of taking part in the activities.

[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.540]
According to the investigation, he wasn't aware of this. He didn't know anything.

[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:26.480]
I think he was at work at the time and he was just devastated.

[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.780]
It says any a son sent him. He was devastated.

[00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.300]
26 after 11 at 5.60 W.D. Q.A.M.

[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:37.400]
Now that's kind of surprising to me. Look what's leading the pack so far.

[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.640]
What's your favorite expression of product from this show over the years?

[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.480]
I thought it would be number one, but it's number two.

[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:51.080]
As number one, with a pretty good cushion now, 65 to 53 is...

[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.500]
Yeah, aren't you surprised?

[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.980]
No tags in the church, 33. It puts the lotion in the basket, 31.

[00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.900]
Your gay, 28. The famous Reverend Jones with a bad baseball camp.

[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.820]
I'm dying over here, 27.

[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.340]
Manage keychain, 23.

[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.320]
Doido doido, 22. I'm getting better at that.

[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.920]
Reckon, 19. O.A.18. Eisner, 17.

[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:15.620]
That's the American FNW 15, Facebook, 13.

[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.300]
Unbelievable nine. And a-ha.

[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.160]
It's only got eight, George. That's your story.

[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.780]
It's only got eight. Well, that doesn't necessarily mean anything.

[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.300]
There's probably only eight people, eight of...

[00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.800]
You know, the finest restaurant in town in one hour.

[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.440]
While thousands ate in McDonald's. Look at it that way.

[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:32.600]
All right. It's called rationalizing.

[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.200]
11.27 at 5.60 W.D. Q.A.M.

[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.760]
The Panthers and the Heat are well done for the season.

[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.000]
Stick a folk in them. And so it's college basketball.

[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.160]
And it often still could start at another three months in spite of all the football talkier on his station.

[00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:47.340]
But there is some action going on every night and every day.

[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.640]
Seven days a week, he got cymbal casting at Pompeau Park and three nights a week.

[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.000]
Every Wednesday, Friday, like tonight and Saturday, he had live harness racing, outstanding.

[00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:57.080]
First race, post time, 7.15 PM.

[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.860]
Free general parking and free admission as well. What's not to like?

[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.980]
Come out to Pompeau Park and enjoy the thrill of not a great horse racing action.

[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.460]
And don't forget, since we were talking today, Johnson just only moments ago,

[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.960]
that tomorrow's the Kentucky Dury and Pompeau Park as they do every year will feature cymbal casting of the run for the roses.

[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.340]
The 129th Kentucky Dury plunge your guts out on...

[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.940]
What was that horse? Indian Express.

[00:32:19.820 --> 00:32:21.420]
Mr. Think? Absolutely.

[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.320]
I'm fact, if I were you, I'd be out Pompeau Park tonight.

[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.000]
Because early bird wagering starts at one o'clock this afternoon.

[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.420]
You can watch wagering, join the crowds tomorrow for the Kentucky Dury from Churchill Downs at Pompeau Park.

[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.180]
But let me say it again, you can advance wagering your early bird wagering on the Derby Sturdy and won this afternoon at Pompeau Park.

[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.400]
So right after the show, you can drive on up there with Vienerboy.

[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:40.820]
Oh, okay.

[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.100]
I can bet a few cent on it.

[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.420]
Don't forget there every Wednesday at Pompeau Park is Dollar Night for Draft Beer Hot Dog Soda's and more like I said every day, seven days a week.

[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:52.660]
You got cymbal casting at Harness Racing Highlight Thurberd Racing from all over North America from noon till the wee hours of the morning.

[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:57.940]
Pompeau Park, don't forget a live racing card, 715 tonight, a block-suffer Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.940]
My life and love, this is 4205 City, the way you are.

[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:08.740]
Carnished with the sewer of this place.

[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.500]
Did you see all ratings for the last book?

[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:12.700]
Yeah, I know it's more time-in.

[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.940]
Sure, could possibly be us.

[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.640]
What's your back?

[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.600]
Back to where you won't wait for more.

[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:38.920]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:33:44.200 --> 00:34:06.760]
Oh, brother, all that glove I don't understand, you can eat from a trough while you're in both him and you're just like clinton, it's all you are far from the straight lip fat ass out

[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.300]
Well, we'll take the intruder you amount

[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.940]
That's right-Wh Lower your back

[00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.800]
For you oh, know, know, know, know, sangiverille

[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:20.800]
De

[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.340]
There's that Gully sound.

[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:41.680]

[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.200]
1132 at 560 WQM.

[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.320]
This is pretty interesting.

[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:52.600]
From Swiss info, Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense was on the board of technology

[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.320]
giant ABB when it wanted to deal with supply North Korea with two nuclear power plants.

[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.640]
It's on our website today, this story, who want to read the whole thing.

[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.740]
Weapons experts say waste material from the two reactors could be used for so-called

[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:05.700]
dirty bombs.

[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:11.040]
The Swiss-based ABB on Friday told Swiss info that Rumsfeld was involved with the company

[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.020]
in early 2000 when it ended a $200 million contract with Pyongyang.

[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.380]
The ABB contract was to deliver equivalent services for two nuclear power stations at

[00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:22.140]
KUMHO, an Earth Korea's east coast.

[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.060]
Rumsfeld, who's one of the Bush administration's most stride and hardliners on Earth Korea,

[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.160]
was a member of ABB's board between 1990 and February 2001 when he left to take up his

[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:32.900]
current post.

[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:40.960]
Wolfram Averhart, a spokesman for ABB, told Swiss info that Rumsfeld was at nearly all

[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.840]
the board meetings during his decade-long involvement with the company.

[00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:47.260]
However, he declined to indicate whether Rumsfeld was made aware of the nuclear contract

[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:47.880]
with North Korea.

[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.180]
This is a good question, but I couldn't comment on that because we never disclosed the

[00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:54.460]
protocols of the board meetings Averhart said, maybe this was the discussion point of

[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.720]
the board, maybe not.

[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.600]
Maybe and maybe not.

[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.120]
Just like maybe Dick Tainted didn't know about Haliburton having all of them deals with

[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:06.080]
Sodom in Iraq with that butcher of Baghdad.

[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.380]
I just mentioned it in passing.

[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:15.480]
And also, oil firms work for terrorist sponsors, challenge giving contracts to Haliburton

[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:15.880]
question.

[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:22.360]
Oil giant Haliburton and their work in countries considered sponsors of terrorism came under

[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.520]
fire Wednesday from California representative of the Baltic and Henry Waxman, who questioned

[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.900]
whether the company should receive lucrative government contracts.

[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:33.600]
In order to defend Secretary Donald Hermann Gearing Rumsfeld, Waxman said Haliburton companies

[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:38.220]
of city areas and joint ventures had dubbed business in Iran, Iraq and Libya in spite of

[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.740]
U.S. sanctions against those countries.

[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.120]
It appears that the company is that is performed and apparently continuing to perform work

[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.140]
for state sponsors of terrorism has been given a prominent rule in the administration's

[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:50.520]
war on terrorism Waxman wrote.

[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.900]
Waxman's letter did not directly accuse Haliburton of bringing law instead Waxman asked Rumsfeld

[00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:59.580]
whether the White House had examined the legality of Haliburton's work in Iraq Iran and

[00:36:59.580 --> 00:36:59.820]
Libya.

[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.540]
He also asked whether the administration plans to do so before awarding Haliburton any

[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.240]
more contracts.

[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:07.140]
And you can read the rest of that story on our website today too.

[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.160]
I just mentioned these things in passing, okay?

[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.520]
Not that we want to get too heavy duty, do we?

[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:13.700]
Sure.

[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.100]
Sure we do.

[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.320]
Because I hate directed news to Virginia, but life ain't just one long never-ending

[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.240]
pip rally, okay?

[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.760]
Give the pom-poms a rest.

[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:26.600]
Here's a good facts from Jason.

[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:30.100]
He says, I voted for about 30, but it lets a man it's one's off.

[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.280]
For example, and I'll pass him by.

[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:35.480]
I mean, the list is getting a little bit long, you know?

[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:36.100]
A little bit.

[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:36.820]
Is it?

[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:37.480]
It's long.

[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.420]
Well, in fact, he also even Jason didn't put this.

[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.460]
Only in the banana republic, baby.

[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.460]
Only in Miami.

[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:44.740]
Yeah.

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.640]
And we got a million manage drops in the world.

[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.560]
I want to bang in the butt, honey.

[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:51.680]
And then Jason, like, oh my God, your breasts are beautiful.

[00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.440]
But I'll leave it up to you in being her boy, okay?

[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:54.640]
I just, um, stand up.

[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.780]
That's not even my favorite.

[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.520]
What's your favorite?

[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.280]
If I'm going to suck on something, it's not going to be an oyster.

[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.240]
What about?

[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.680]
Who's going to get Ricky a blow?

[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.980]
Yeah, there's so many, you know?

[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.140]
Well, we got the manage key chain, even though right, and most of these weren't on it.

[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.760]
You know something, let me say this to you.

[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:16.060]
How about manage key chain part two if we can't get the most stuff or we can't get permission

[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:16.700]
from his highness?

[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:17.820]
That's a good plan B.

[00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.220]
I think that's an excellent plan A.

[00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:23.460]
A, a lot of Jason says PS, I think I'm all how we're debited.

[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.200]
Keychain would sell about 30 million.

[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.180]
30, man.

[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.080]
Million no question.

[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.780]
So a lot you're indeed, but if we can't get that, we've always got the mad dog.

[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.000]
Did he talk or did he cock it?

[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:36.520]
See what I'm saying?

[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.340]
Here's an excellent fact from Joe, a real butt-licking one, which I always like a little butt-licking.

[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.320]
While on my adventures across the end of this, it also pisses me off.

[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.100]
You read this, I assume?

[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.300]
Yeah.

[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.640]
While on my adventures across the west, I had many occasions to listen to XM radio, satellite radio.

[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:59.420]
I heard such people as Sonny Fox, Dave Grave Line, Phil Henry, and a host of others.

[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:00.100]
Are you sure?

[00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.880]
I haven't heard the love doctors from WZZR.

[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.240]
They put on a good show by the way they seem to be let, they never seem to be lacking for callers either.

[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.660]
They also happen to be fans of yours.

[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.560]
But why aren't you on it?

[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.700]
XM, question Joe.

[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.880]
You have more talent than the lot of them combined.

[00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.920]
It says you'd be a sensation on XM perhaps, and here I even underlined this.

[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.420]
Because it just pisses me off.

[00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:23.200]
Perhaps you need more aggressive representation.

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:29.460]
Yeah, maybe if I had an agent, a real lawyer who was more interested in like really getting me where I should be,

[00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:35.580]
making me a contender, instead of like worried about his damn, how much weed he's got to smoke

[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.360]
and about his house for boys and all that crap.

[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.060]
I think he ought to be worried about that, but he's not, and he's not going to change.

[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:40.840]
I can't read for him.

[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:41.680]
I'm about, huh?

[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.680]
A contender instead of a pretender?

[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:45.380]
That's right, never going to be a contender.

[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.560]
I would normally count at the home.

[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.600]
And by the way, Nora Kentz got the same number as Bill O'Reilly in the South Florida market.

[00:39:50.820 --> 00:39:51.800]
A big zero.

[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:56.760]
It says, fire that stiff you have now and hire yourself a real bulldog and get these things done.

[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.020]
It says you may be interested in knowing that on radio and records.com there's an interesting article about Arbitron.

[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.120]
Joe, we already know this.

[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.880]
David knew this for years.

[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.500]
It says they're giving minorities more money and incentives than whites to fill out their diaries.

[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.160]
Reverse discrimination question mark.

[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:12.200]
You'll be the judge if you get it.

[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:13.040]
But we already know about that.

[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:13.820]
They've been here for years.

[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:20.780]
And the reason being they say that they have a more difficult time in getting sufficient minority representation.

[00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:22.740]
So as a result, they have to have a greater incentive.

[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.900]
So instead of two bucks, they give like five, or I don't know how much you'd rate.

[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:26.960]
How much do you think it's up to now?

[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:27.760]
About 30 million.

[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:28.580]
Well, whatever they're given.

[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:33.680]
So they get a much greater return on the ethnic diaries than you do on the cracker diaries.

[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.900]
Remember that movie to cracker diaries?

[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:36.220]
No.

[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:37.700]
You do why?

[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:38.760]
Sounds like good title, though.

[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:39.680]
Let's make it.

[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.280]
Here's an excellent column.

[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.080]
You don't want to like read all the way to one o'clock.

[00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.080]
It's only 1138.

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.220]
God, it seems like I've been here forever.

[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.260]
I've got a couple of more bedtime stories.

[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.740]
I definitely want to squeeze in here.

[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:49.640]
I'll get to them.

[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.960]
What's your favorite expression or product you got from the near-roger show?

[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.640]
Absolutely correct.

[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:01.340]
Here's got 71, about 30, 53, no fagin' that's here.

[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.220]
It's 37, puts a lotion in the basket.

[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.520]
36, your gay, 32.

[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.520]
And I'm dying over here.

[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:09.360]
How many of that's got?

[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.320]
About 30, man.

[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.600]
Right.

[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.240]
Somebody to QA him, hello.

[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.540]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.580]
Man, I've been trying to call for two and a half hours.

[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.680]
I got something that I got my whole family saying.

[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.520]
I'm not sure if you like it, but we love it.

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.500]
And it's open wide for chunky.

[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.380]
You can say it to your two-year-old when you're trying to get him to eat his strange carrots.

[00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:35.500]
You can say it to the white, but he's about to, you know, take care of her duties, man.

[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.740]
Open wide for chunky.

[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.360]
I hear Father O'Toole like to say that, too, is what I'm hearing.

[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.900]
Okay, thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:42.220]
Thank you.

[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.760]
Open wide for chunky.

[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.520]
You're not putting that on there, but I did not mention that.

[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.540]
I think I mentioned it yesterday.

[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:47.440]
I forgot.

[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.800]
Or maybe it wasn't on the ear.

[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.280]
567-0560.

[00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:55.400]
Pound 56 on the 18th, Steve Verizon Wireless Live.

[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.320]
My life and local.

[00:41:57.820 --> 00:41:59.380]
This is 420-06.

[00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.380]
You a QA.

[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.480]
Fred, get very afraid.

[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:07.760]
Yes.

[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.480]
I like it when the guy stopped by.

[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.320]
For a Hummer.

[00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.820]
Do you remember?

[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:20.260]
Do you remember?

[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.820]
When you got that Hummer,

[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:28.820]
New Key is on the block really has smoked Chinese shoes, have no...

[00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:30.760]
I am living live in the guy's stuff.

[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:31.880]
Or a Hummer.

[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:32.960]
Or a Hummer.

[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:37.020]
I like guys who start at home, they want to...

[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.960]
Extractors who they make their wish.

[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.640]
Cause they get long from my Hummer, from my Hummer.

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.280]
Big one, Daddy, stick it in my hand.

[00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.160]
I gave you a Hummer, and it all began.

[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:50.020]
You had the biggest one that I ever did to see.

[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.400]
It fell to the floor when you tried to be.

[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.800]
When you undid, I can't help but want.

[00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:57.500]
But it's so big that you just have to flaunt it.

[00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.760]
You wet my whistle with that big thing, baby.

[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.260]
I've probably done my throat man, it drives me crazy.

[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.600]
Now I think about you and it makes me sad.

[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.560]
You went away, it never came back.

[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:09.240]
I gave you a Hummer and you went back home.

[00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:11.760]
My only pumpkin was the size of your dog.

[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.940]
I felt even love when you gave me a beat.

[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.600]
Now I'm a little bit like Alex, me key in.

[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.680]
When I met you, I knew that you were sick.

[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.280]
It really doesn't matter the size of your stick.

[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:26.220]
New kids on the block really have smoked Chinese shoes, have no...

[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:28.180]
I am such a fly from the guy's stuff.

[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.260]
I for a Hummer.

[00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.440]
For a Hummer.

[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.660]
1144-562-WQM.

[00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.920]
I should have asked Dave how come the Hummer isn't going to be on today speaking to him.

[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.440]
I guess he's too busy punching his guts out at the Churchill Downs.

[00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.700]
Probably.

[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:42.700]
That's a good reason.

[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.820]
Eddie Cable will be on following the Mad Dog, Mad Dog will be on 1-3.

[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:49.680]
Eddie Cable from Vegas 3-7 on your gambling on your GA station.

[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.660]
Let's just change the colors from WQM to WGA.

[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:55.680]
Gambers anonymous.

[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.380]
Okay, yeah.

[00:43:57.020 --> 00:43:59.880]
Josh Friedman 7 o'clock for the Fathower.

[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.780]
730 at Marlins on Dreck.

[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.840]
Marlins at the Astros 805.

[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.880]
And in the Beast after the baseball game till 2 in the morning, ESPN radio overnight.

[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:09.560]
The Beast.

[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.400]
The Unchist one.

[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.640]
The Man with the Death Wish.

[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.960]
5-6705-60, pound 5-60 on the AT&T.

[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.140]
Oh, the reason I played that...

[00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:20.640]
Be a friend.

[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.120]
Be very a friend.

[00:44:22.300 --> 00:44:22.860]
That drop-in.

[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:26.300]
I want to dedicate that to Miguel and George Corso.

[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.200]
Because when I come back, number 1, I'm not going to give you any advance.

[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.720]
I'm going to run around the halls and breathe on everybody.

[00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:33.320]
Be a friend.

[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:34.800]
Be very a friend.

[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.420]
I mean, that thing, I still can't get over it.

[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.180]
It's so stupid.

[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.360]
Just like, I'm trying to remember which paper was in so I could like click out of it here.

[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:44.600]
I think it was in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:47.620]
I don't know.

[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:48.480]
It was not in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:49.600]
It was in the Globe, I believe.

[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.340]
About some young girl who came with her family to Toronto.

[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:55.240]
And now it's a suspected SARS case.

[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.120]
She got a cold, a sore throat, and a cough.

[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.060]
And now, what's that SARS-DF family, wasn't Toronto?

[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.020]
Is she in the hospital?

[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:03.220]
No.

[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:04.240]
Is she like Deathly Hill?

[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:04.500]
No.

[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.520]
Is anybody else got it?

[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:05.700]
No.

[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:08.780]
So let me just say this.

[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.660]
Anybody that comes up here, we want your money back.

[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.640]
Lee City is now making phenomenal deals to let...

[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:17.360]
You know, entice people to come back after they've butchered the reputation of the city.

[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:19.280]
But don't get a cold.

[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:21.700]
Don't get a sniffle.

[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.980]
Don't cough on a plane.

[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.720]
Don't look at anybody cross-eyed.

[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.960]
Don't get a scratchy throat.

[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.940]
Because right away, it'll be SARS.

[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:35.560]
Just stop and think about what kind of Neanderthal assholes you're dealing with in that building, okay?

[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:39.020]
And this was in a meeting, probably in the one of them department head meetings.

[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.820]
What do you think?

[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.460]
I have no idea.

[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.340]
Or something like that, because I know Muff was in on it.

[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:47.000]
That's what I'm hearing to the grapevine.

[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:51.800]
Not that we want to give Muff and any trouble, but he's got a solid position now in here.

[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:51.960]
No.

[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.500]
He's got a real strong contract.

[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.580]
You don't have to worry about things like that.

[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:57.880]
WDQAM, hello.

[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:00.780]
QAM.

[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:02.540]
He died?

[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.080]
My phone is ringing.

[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:05.540]
You know what that means?

[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.280]
That means my office applies you downstairs.

[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:08.520]
Not exciting?

[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:09.080]
Mm-hmm.

[00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.500]
I'm gonna have to go get him now.

[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.280]
Although it'd be interesting.

[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:11.680]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.040]
No, I'm not gonna do that.

[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.180]
See, I make the call one day.

[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:17.520]
The next day I got me another case of fax paper coming.

[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:25.720]
I got me a couple of extra toner cartridges so we don't have the problem like you got where you have to beg and plead with your ex-oly to come by because the station's too cheap to give us supplies that we need.

[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:29.000]
It's really great.

[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.860]
Like it's like my own little real radio station here as opposed to QAM.

[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:35.020]
By the way, yes.

[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.800]
I heard Mark talking on the TV this morning.

[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.240]
You're Mark Morgan on TV, right?

[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.220]
He didn't do that.

[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:42.380]
Really?

[00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:42.860]
Really?

[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.340]
He didn't do the spas routine.

[00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.340]
I wonder if I still have that on there.

[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.600]
That's traffic and weather.

[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.340]
I'm Mark Morgan on sports radio 560 QAM.

[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:52.460]
He didn't do that?

[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.120]
No, no shit.

[00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:55.000]
Straight up by like a normal person.

[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.760]
Oh, like a normal person like a real traffic and weather guy.

[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.560]
As opposed to that.

[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:00.280]
That's traffic.

[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.160]
I'm spasley.

[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:01.640]
Mark Morgan.

[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:02.440]
QAM.

[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.600]
You know, it's just, what does it say?

[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.220]
What does it say?

[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.900]
I see if we had any real management.

[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:12.360]
Wouldn't you think that one of our people since we've had about 50 PDs and 50 PDs.

[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.600]
And all these intermediate paper pushers running around.

[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:19.780]
Wouldn't you think somebody would say, hey, Mark, you know, if you want to keep doing a traffic

[00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.200]
under station, tone it down a little bit.

[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.280]
Okay, stop with a wild drama.

[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.240]
It's embarrassing.

[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.980]
Boy, you've been out of here a long time.

[00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.800]
And I'm curious how come that Mo who was so upset with a beast being unprofessional.

[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.340]
What could be more unprofessional when I just played there, huh?

[00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:33.580]
QAM.

[00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:34.960]
You know who else used to do that?

[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:36.460]
Who?

[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.480]
The big.

[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:37.840]
Oh!

[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.240]
Remember that one he used to do updates?

[00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:40.200]
No.

[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:43.120]
He had the similar kind of a spastic way of doing that.

[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:43.280]
Yeah.

[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:44.500]
Can I make a stand there?

[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.060]
And then the beast started doing that.

[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:48.680]
Remember that?

[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.200]
I am the beast.

[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:54.080]
Well, anyway, let's not talk about the beast because he's an overgrown child.

[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.500]
He's just a big, chubby child.

[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:56.640]
Go ahead.

[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.640]
B-ha!

[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:00.400]
Yes, they have to be a bit of a call right.

[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.020]
B-ha!

[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.060]
B-ha!

[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:02.500]
B-ha!

[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:04.060]
We don't know how to spell that.

[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.440]
You're suggesting as duly noted.

[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.360]
And Eric says, quit already.

[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.300]
Okay, I got 50,000 choices on here.

[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.080]
It's going over pretty good though.

[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.180]
We got 504 votes.

[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.160]
It's not even noon yet.

[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.480]
It's not even noon yet.

[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:19.480]
Absolute.

[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.140]
I don't think they're going to catch absolutely correct.

[00:48:21.260 --> 00:48:22.280]
Oh, I'm going to play that more.

[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.440]
Absolute incorrect.

[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:25.420]
Absolute incorrect.

[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.280]
Absolute incorrect.

[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:27.280]

[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.080]
Absolute incorrect.

[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.220]
Absolute incorrect.

[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:32.900]
Yeah.

[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.820]
In fact, we might do a whole day of that on Monday.

[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:36.880]
What do you say?

[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.040]
Well, then on Tuesday, I got this thing down to a science now.

[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:41.300]
Tuesday, your favorite fart.

[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:41.860]
Number three.

[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:42.640]
Number four.

[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:43.140]
Huh?

[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.600]
I like the one that sounds like a rimshot.

[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.740]
I think that's number seven.

[00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:47.360]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.080]
Oh, all right.

[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:50.500]
Now, what kind of rimshot were you talking about?

[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:51.620]
I know you're a basketball fan.

[00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:52.720]
Oh, yeah.

[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.040]
Oops.

[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.240]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.800]
Don't forget, did we ever find out why there was no Joe and Marshall last night?

[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:00.140]
No.

[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.500]
Excuse me.

[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:05.300]
And I'm not going to get upset about it because I'm looking forward to lunch.

[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.080]
There's nothing I can do about it.

[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.760]
They just don't want to tell us nothing that's going on.

[00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:10.860]
We're just totally right in the dark.

[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.780]
So we'll fight out for it.

[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:16.780]
Not that anybody cares.

[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.900]
You know what's all the calls we had saying?

[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.880]
You were in a house that you were on Mark's show last night.

[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:20.320]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:20.600]
No.

[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:23.160]
We're up all night waiting for that thing to come on.

[00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:24.820]
And the show too.

[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:25.460]
Call the phone.

[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.220]
Anyway, Joe's off on his honeymoon.

[00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:28.180]
It's wait, but you can do it.

[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.300]
Mark Eisenberg of the Joe and Mark's show.

[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:30.660]
No, no.

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:32.500]
Any minute now he'll be doing his thing.

[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.760]
No, no, two of these singular wireless off the palm.

[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.800]
I don't want 57th Avenue.

[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.500]
Stop idle when prizes and register when tripped for two to the major league baseball all-star

[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:41.800]
game in Chicago this summer.

[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.000]
And a Marlon sky box party at the pros and pretty damn good prizes.

[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.480]
How does he wait to get that?

[00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:47.980]
Don't know.

[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.400]
When every time you guys go out, you get squat.

[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.660]
You get cramp.

[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:56.020]
Watch a diddly squat that nobody would take if you threw in a $50 bill on the envelope.

[00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:58.720]
But you might try that.

[00:49:59.120 --> 00:49:59.800]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:00.260]
Hello.

[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.100]
Yes, sir.

[00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:01.760]
No, are you doing?

[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:02.320]
Good.

[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.220]
I agree with you about it.

[00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:10.540]
It's all about oil and big contrast and big cooperation running this country.

[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:11.540]
Forget about democracy.

[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:17.200]
I got three, I dropped three expressions about historic triangle and the boyaka.

[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.740]
Shocking the chicken and mama la pingo.

[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.480]
And it's big.

[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.920]
It's big and the bottom of us.

[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:23.960]
Okay.

[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.300]
What is the worst last one?

[00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:25.600]
Big one.

[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.380]
I think he was.

[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.060]
I think it's the first time looking for you call that a penis.

[00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:35.460]
Yeah.

[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.180]
She might put that on there or not.

[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:37.400]
Sure.

[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.820]
I'm going to put one hula one on there for the ring.

[00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:41.380]
You laying go.

[00:50:44.700 --> 00:50:45.560]
I'll pull you.

[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:47.040]
He's choking at baby.

[00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:48.340]
It's gagging over there.

[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.600]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Marlis line.

[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:58.540]
Of course I want to ask Brian Andrews, our former colleague.

[00:50:59.440 --> 00:50:59.480]
Huh?

[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:03.440]
Who says that our former colleague out there said what does a choking chicken sound like?

[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.340]
And that was his rendering.

[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.900]
Think about your rendering is Brian.

[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:12.960]
And by the way, Adam is still interested.

[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:15.400]
WDQA.

[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:15.560]
Hello.

[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:17.220]
What's up, Neil?

[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:17.620]
How's it going?

[00:51:17.620 --> 00:51:17.920]
Yes sir.

[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:18.420]
Okay.

[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:24.280]
That website you were looking for, but as a niche old thing there,

[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.680]
the smoking gun.com.

[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.500]
Oh, that's right.

[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.020]
And I got the, I got a couple for you.

[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:34.600]
How about Georgia favorite, great AT&T?

[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.300]
What is it?

[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:38.720]
Great AT&T.

[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.000]
Oh, okay.

[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.180]
And the bottom right here too.

[00:51:43.220 --> 00:51:43.360]
Yeah.

[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.180]
Yeah.

[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:45.800]
And Joe is a gaggy suck.

[00:51:47.160 --> 00:51:47.980]
Couldn't leave that out.

[00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:48.840]
Okay, thank you pal.

[00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:50.020]
I know the TV.

[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:50.800]
So you're.

[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:53.280]
Georgia gaggy sucks, okay?

[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:54.240]
Greg hate you.

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:56.840]
Georgia gaggy sucks, okay?

[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:57.660]
Greg hate you.

[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.460]
Georgia gaggy sucks, okay?

[00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:00.380]
Greg hate you.

[00:52:00.540 --> 00:52:02.420]
And you know, there's a certain rhythm to those two, you know what?

[00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:02.700]
Yep.

[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.600]
And they do need to be on there both of them.

[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:06.920]
Are they really?

[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:07.820]
Well, they're going to be.

[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.980]
Now, since we put Greg on there, we don't want to let Muffa feel left out.

[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.000]
How about, uh, get off this instant.

[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:14.800]
You know like that?

[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:15.280]
Sure.

[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:16.760]
For good friend Ken.

[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.560]
Oh, look at this.

[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.500]
The Republican Theocracy by Ellen Goodman in the Boston Globe.

[00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:24.680]
See how the way of this stuff all seems to come back to Boston.

[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.920]
Even that little girl that had a cold, had a sniffle.

[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:27.980]
Oh, she's got stars.

[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.680]
They were Toronto.

[00:52:29.640 --> 00:52:31.220]
I am so nauseous from that.

[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:37.640]
Ellen Goodman says, as a certified flap watcher, I'll look back on a Rick Santorum

[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.820]
controversy as the quarmorant of its species.

[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:44.640]
See in the very first sentences, God, words that were looking up.

[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:45.420]
The quarmorant?

[00:52:45.540 --> 00:52:46.140]
Yeah, the Big Bird.

[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:46.860]
Oh.

[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:50.800]
It took an enormous amount of energy to achieve a modest lift off and then it

[00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.960]
flopped unceremoniously back into the political ocean.

[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.880]
The flapping began after the Pennsylvania Senator offered his comments on the

[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]
Texas Sodomy case.

[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.740]
If the Supreme Court said that you have the right to consensual sex within your home,

[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:03.220]
then you have the right to bigamy.

[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:04.400]
You have the right to polygamy.

[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.320]
You have the right to win says you have the right to adultery.

[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:07.140]
You have the right to anything.

[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:10.860]
This brought outrage from the usual and unusual suspects.

[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.820]
The log cabin Republicans, the masochistic wing of the gay movement protested.

[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:15.820]
Another great liar.

[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:16.720]
Oh, God.

[00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.620]
The list of that misgride you silly queen.

[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.620]
The log cabin Republicans, the masochistic wing of the gay movement protested that he was

[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:26.040]
tarnishing homosexuals.

[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:30.340]
O, and alert, the leader of the breakaway Mormon sect protested that he was tarnishing

[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:30.940]
polygamists.

[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.080]
Meanwhile, the White House kept its lips zipped except to say that the Senator often

[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.720]
described as the original compassionate conservative was an inclusive man.

[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.980]
When the aircom, many wondered why nostalgia for segregation had taken down the number

[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.940]
one Republican Senator Trent Lott while gay trashing it left the number three Republican

[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:47.600]
unharmed.

[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:51.680]
But all in all, this was less a flap about homosexuality than about theocracy.

[00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:54.800]
Centurum opened another front, the ongoing inter-seeing battle,

[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.820]
the struggle between what maybe described as the she-eyed and suing wings of the Republican party

[00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:02.420]
or if you prefer between Taliban Republicans and suburban Republicans.

[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.680]
Let's go back to our friend Rick Santorum.

[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:09.700]
Last year he told the Catholic newspaper that JFK's vow to separate his faith from politics

[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:12.140]
was wrong and has caused much harm in America.

[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:15.120]
Judy Brown of the American life league said approvingly,

[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.900]
Senator Santorum is a very good example of the Catholic who practices his faith

[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:20.260]
24 hours a day.

[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.860]
He doesn't leave it at home when he goes to the office.

[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.880]
This may have a nice holistic green to it until you remember that this government

[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.780]
was found in a separation of church and state.

[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.260]
And the line has gotten increasingly fuzzy under Bush too.

[00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.300]
It's not just prayer meetings in the Attorney General's office.

[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.260]
It's not just abstinence only education and the rather heubritic assertion

[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.900]
that God is on our side in battle.

[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.160]
It's on the home front too.

[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:46.000]
A couple of weeks ago there was a flap that didn't even reach the Santorum altitude.

[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.880]
In an article that I bet his paper titled America's Education Evangelist,

[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:52.340]
Rod Pade's the Secretary of Public Education,

[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.560]
expressed his preference for college education.

[00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.480]
All things being equal, I would prefer to have a child in a school

[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.700]
where there's a strong appreciation for values,

[00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:02.920]
the kind of values that I think are associated with the Christian communities.

[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.440]
Nobody say to those who disagree with him, I would offer them my prayers, he said.

[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.980]
I know this is what's called playing to the base,

[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.560]
but the base is awfully basic, even a fundamentalist.

[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.120]
Remember what Jerry Falwell said after 9-11?

[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:17.880]
I really believe that the pagans and the abortionists and the feminist and the gays and lesbians,

[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:19.900]
all of them who tried to secularize America,

[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.740]
I point the figure in their face and say, you helped this happen.

[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.680]
Pat Roberts and none of his head in agreement.

[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:28.940]
Now, fast-forward to the list of people who have been nominated to the Theocracy,

[00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.140]
excuse me, the judiciary, among those who are debt-relatively moderate

[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.080]
is Bill Prior, a Korean Alabama Attorney General,

[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:36.720]
nominated the D. West Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit.

[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.120]
Prior not only worked with Roberts and to defend student-led prayer in school,

[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:43.220]
he also defended the judge who displayed the tent commandments in his courthouse.

[00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.740]
At a public rally, he said, God has chosen through a son Jesus Christ,

[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:50.240]
this time in this place for all Christians to save our country and save our courts.

[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:53.240]
The same Prior wrote in an Amicus brief in Texas,

[00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.980]
in the Sodomy case that might have been dictated by Santorum,

[00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.060]
except for Prior's belief that protecting homosexuals would also protect

[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:00.160]
necrophiles.

[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.420]
How's the hunchback in order to name it?

[00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:05.040]
The Taliban are the suburban,

[00:56:05.220 --> 00:56:08.840]
the Republican Party has patched together a coalition of those who want to keep the government out of your pocket,

[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.400]
and those who want to put the government in your bedroom.

[00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.140]
But these Theocrysties are giving them more trouble than the Democrats.

[00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.060]
What do you say about a law that lets police break into an apartment

[00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:19.200]
and the rest who went for having sex with the wrong person, Tally Ho Taliban?

[00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:21.880]
Before they sent toarm flat when flat,

[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:25.180]
it rubbed some of the compassion out the conservative, memo to Rick,

[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:27.040]
a swing voter is not a swinger.

[00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:28.160]
Memo to the White House,

[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:29.900]
what happens in the privacy of a home

[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:32.220]
may show up in the privacy of the polling booth.

[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:45.000]
I am Fraa, Ili and our Roch Ledman,

[00:56:45.300 --> 00:56:48.940]
and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels,

[00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:53.140]
and listening to the near Rochet, a Munista hour.

[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:53.900]
Take higher!

[00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:55.140]
Wooo!

[00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.200]
Wooo!

[00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:57.720]
Wooo!

[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:01.680]
I think my friend is right.

[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.640]
Hover and hotter is burning right through my role.

[00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:09.600]
Yeah!

[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:13.040]
Push, push, push, push,

[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:15.400]
I just sent my guy to Rio de Valle.

[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.980]
If the police display me,

[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.280]
I go low which way do you go?

[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.320]
The explosion of burners in Walker

[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:31.100]
takes the correct route just like Walker.

[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:35.960]
It lets up the better guy burn your muscles.

[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:41.140]
Just a bunch of burns in Walker's muscles.

[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:42.560]
Wooo!

[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:44.060]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.100]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:47.360]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:48.580]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.940]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:51.000]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:51.360]
I want to go to the White House!

[00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:52.280]
Wooo!

[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.160]
Hover one is 560 W,

[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.380]
and that was a great segue between Iliana and Ethbit.

[00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.160]
I like that.

[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.220]
Who served in the military from the website,

[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.420]
AWOLBUSH.COM?

[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.380]
It's on our website today.

[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.900]
We certainly don't have time to go down the list,

[00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.540]
but it is interesting looking at the prominent Democrats

[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.320]
and the prominent Republicans,

[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:13.300]
and to see their distinguished service to their country.

[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:14.400]
For example,

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.400]
prominent Republicans speak for the House,

[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.220]
then he has to avoid a drafted and served.

[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:21.560]
Former House Majority Leader Dick Armee,

[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:22.760]
a void of the draft and served.

[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:24.940]
House Majority Leader Tom Delay,

[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.860]
a void of the draft, didn't serve.

[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.560]
He said so many minority youths had volunteered

[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:31.880]
that there was literally no room for patriotic folks

[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:32.560]
like myself.

[00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:33.940]
Ha ha ha ha!

[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.080]
All my hemorrhoids twitch when I read that.

[00:58:37.620 --> 00:58:39.820]
House Majority Whip Roy Blunt did not serve.

[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.380]
Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist did not serve.

[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.580]
Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Laude,

[00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:46.840]
a void of the draft did not serve.

[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:48.980]
But Sura waived a mean pom-pom.

[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.900]
Too bad he's not around now that we got these...

[00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:53.160]
Sura, these pepper alleys going all the time?

[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:54.900]
I mean, he's still in the Senate,

[00:58:54.980 --> 00:58:56.500]
but he's not the cheerleading at the top.

[00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:01.220]
Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld served in the US Navy 54-47

[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:02.720]
as an aviator and flight instructor,

[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.020]
served as Reagan Special Envoy of the Middle East,

[00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:07.060]
a med with Southern Hussein twice in 1884.

[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:10.900]
George W. Bush decided that a six-year National Guard commitment

[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:13.680]
really meant four years still says that he's been the war.

[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:14.720]
Ha, it says.

[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:15.800]
Question mark.

[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:18.240]
Vice President Cheney several deferments

[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.880]
deliathed by marriage in his own words

[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.720]
had other priorities than military service.

[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:22.360]
Oh!

[00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:24.300]
Do you ever hear of that as an excuse?

[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.420]
Sure, I'm busy.

[00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:26.920]
Yeah, I got other priorities.

[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.240]
I got another fish to fry.

[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:28.740]
I get lost.

[00:59:29.540 --> 00:59:31.380]
Attorney General John Ascroft did not serve.

[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:34.040]
sought deferment to teach business ahead at Southwest Missouri State.

[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.060]
Jeb Bush, Governor Florida, did not serve.

[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.980]
All of a sudden, the mean building increased those local phone bills.

[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:41.720]
What would you get to that?

[00:59:42.260 --> 00:59:45.020]
Carl Roll, who avoided the drafted and served to busy being a Republican,

[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:45.460]
says.

[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:48.500]
Former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who avoided the drafted and served.

[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:52.540]
Former President Reagan, due to poor eyesight, served in a non-combat role,

[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:55.920]
making movies for the Army in Southern California during WWII.

[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:59.320]
He later seems to have confused his role as an actor playing a tail gunner

[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.220]
for the real thing.

[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:06.280]
B1 Bob Dornan, avoided Korean war combat duty by enrolling in college acting classes

[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.000]
and listed only after the fighting was over in Korea.

[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:13.340]
Phil Graham, avoided the drafted, not served, had four student deferments.

[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.140]
And then listen, Republicans who did serve a distinguished senator, John McCain.

[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:23.600]
Silver star, bronze star, Lee's, and a merit purple heart, distinguished flying cross.

[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.700]
And then it says, why did the Bush campaign swear to smear him so badly?

[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.660]
Former Senator Bob Dool, an honorable man who served.

[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:34.360]
In fact, he behavior, a saying, an autograph.

[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:38.260]
Chuck Hagel, two purple hearts and a bronze star for Vietnam.

[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:42.060]
And then it's got the prominent Democrats and lists an amazingly,

[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.780]
most of them, representative Dick Hurt, served as company uniform 65-71.

[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.700]
David Bonnier, served as company uniform 68-72.

[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.700]
Senator Tom Dachel, served as company uniform 69-72.

[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.080]
Bob Kerry, Medal of Honor in Vietnam.

[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:57.580]
Daniel Inui, Medal of Honor World War II.

[01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.820]
John Kerry, Silver star, bronze star with combat, and three awards of the purple heart for a service in combat.

[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.740]
Charles Rangel, bronze star, Korea, and then it goes on and on and on.

[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:12.040]
And this is listed as the full chicken-hawk database.

[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.820]
Now you understand what that expression came from?

[01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:17.220]
I like, of course, what it used to be.

[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:18.380]
Right.

[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:23.800]
566-70560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.140]
Governor Boyce sent Bill that could lead to the record rate increases for local phone service.

[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:34.400]
Legislation that could lead the record rate increases for local telephone service was passed there.

[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.420]
They bought a Florida house and Governor Jeb Boyce says, awrye-wrye.

[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.200]
The governor who vetoed some of them, now do we have an updated store on this sub?

[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.940]
Beena Boyce, because I put this on the website.

[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.440]
I'd hate to put on something that was updated that would be embarrassing, wouldn't it?

[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.080]
As far as I know, no.

[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:51.440]
Well, I'll look.

[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.340]
I'll look as to put on an updated store would be a no-no.

[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:58.340]
You know?

[01:01:58.920 --> 01:01:59.020]
No.

[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.000]
Well, kill some time for a second, okay?

[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.180]
I don't know.

[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.780]
The governor who vetoed similar legislation just a year ago, six months before his reelection,

[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:14.220]
is already indicated he would sign the new version because it gives more authority to the PSC to control rates.

[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.920]
The House passed the measure 93 to 20 to Florida House.

[01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.760]
The Senate approved the Bill Wednesday, 27 to 12.

[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.680]
Consumer groups, including the AARP and Florida Legal Services, have opposed the bill containing.

[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.520]
It doesn't guarantee increased competition.

[01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:31.420]
It would increase rates for those who can lease, afforded such as poor and elderly people who make too long distance calls.

[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.340]
How do you like that?

[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.880]
Now, it still, this is, it looks to me like the same still story.

[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:48.760]
Florida telephone customers should prepare to open their wallets, legislators on Thursday gave final approval of the biggest local phone rate increase in the state's history,

[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.560]
and set the measure to the governor who is expected to sign it.

[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:55.220]
I was thinking maybe there might be an update on it, but that's the update on the sunset, okay?

[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:57.960]
He'll sign it because he's not running for reelection right now.

[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.340]
Although I understand you've got some devious plans.

[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.880]
56650560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon line. WQAM, hello.

[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.840]
Call. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:15.520]
You missed dial? No, he missed dial, I'm sorry. How's that possibly missed dial? Do you believe that?

[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.740]
No. Now he panicked. Went into a total panic.

[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:21.640]
I'm not a joke. Who was it? He choked. He chucked.

[01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:26.700]
56650560.560 on the AT&T line. WQAM, hello.

[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.640]
Hi, would you speak with Neil, please?

[01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:33.960]
Speaking. Hi, Neil. I'm one of your daily listeners I called in several months ago,

[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:40.920]
and I just wanted to say last night I don't know how you felt, but when I watched the president get out of the house.

[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:44.000]
I didn't watch it. I don't want to hear of it. I want one second of it.

[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:50.260]
I had my husband said I refused too, but when he got off that plane in that uniform holding that helmet,

[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.220]
and you know, here he was, AWOL.

[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:56.560]
Please try to make up for that time that he disappeared when he went AWOL.

[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.340]
Exactly. Well, they say this is all going to be for the political convention,

[01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:05.320]
but I just want to let you know that I have read every book that you have recommended

[01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:09.860]
from Stupid White Man to the Honey of the President for Bid and Truth,

[01:04:09.860 --> 01:04:14.420]
and last night I have been so disheartened with the journalist,

[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:22.760]
but in Tom Broca, especially, but last night he showed Colin Powell sitting there pointing out

[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:25.500]
the five things that they had against Sodom and his saying,

[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:32.940]
and then today, you know, as of last night, none of those things that he presented in front of the UN,

[01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.440]
nothing has been presented.

[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:40.180]
So maybe the journalists are coming around because I think America is waiting out.

[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.520]
No, I don't think so.

[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.720]
I hope you're right, but I don't see that at all.

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.440]
Every time I even, because I try to avoid CNN and MSNBC, we don't have Fox here, thank goodness.

[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.000]
But I try to avoid watching it all because it gets me so depressed,

[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:57.100]
but every time I do go by the channels, all I see is another puff piece and more flag waving

[01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.780]
and more patriotic rallies, and more isn't this wonderful.

[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.220]
And here's another ceremony on a White House lawn, and all I hear is a bunch of so-called journalists

[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:06.020]
just suck it up and endorsing all of it.

[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:10.520]
But the thing is, that's true, but the American people have to begin to see through this.

[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:13.440]
We've got 44 million Americans unemployed.

[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:16.140]
We have 20-something million without help and insurance.

[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.120]
Oh, no, I've got bad news for you.

[01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:18.540]
What?

[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.480]
Scott Peterson's new attorney with a big mustache.

[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.560]
Mark Garragos, you know, the professional talking head on Larry King with a big mustache.

[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:25.980]
Right.

[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:27.980]
He's going to be Scott Peterson's new attorney.

[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:28.700]
I'm sorry, go ahead.

[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:29.400]
Oh, they're gone.

[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.080]
I just turned on CNN to see what they were showing right now.

[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:37.060]
Again, I said Americans, you can wave all those flags and you can do this and that.

[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:45.380]
But when you don't have jobs and you don't have health insurance and schools are closing and veterans aren't getting benefits, we cannot be that stupid.

[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:47.720]
I mean, you want to bet.

[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:49.140]
You want to bet?

[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:56.220]
I bet anyway, you just keep it up because you were the one my husband, you know, told me three years ago, he said, listen to this man.

[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.880]
He's ahead of his time.

[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:05.180]
And because of the problem, I had it by the, that's why I'm in Canada because the least up here, we're on the same, we're on the same year anyway.

[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:06.800]
Yeah, we'll keep it up and thank you.

[01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:07.460]
How are you feeling?

[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:08.260]
I'm real good.

[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:08.800]
Good.

[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:09.500]
Thanks, huh?

[01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:10.320]
Have a great weekend.

[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.040]
Okay, bye-bye.

[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.420]
By the way, go back to this list of the chicken ox.

[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:14.320]
Yeah.

[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:17.060]
Really interesting one that I left out, but I shouldn't gloss over Colin Powell.

[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:17.660]
Yes.

[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.200]
What are we to make of Powell?

[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.600]
It says on the one hand, a long career as a military manager on the other hand, accused of covering up the Meal I Massacre in Vietnam.

[01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:32.600]
Back on that first hand, one of the seemingly sane voices in this administration when it comes to a rack released, he used to be on the other hand, a clear hypocrite.

[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:39.520]
I'm angry that so many sons of the powerful and well-placed managed to wangle spots and reserve a national guard units, he said.

[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:40.380]
Oops.

[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:46.120]
And these are the same people he's working for and with and around and about.

[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:47.760]
He's become one of them.

[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.460]
Oh, there's the present.

[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:49.980]
There you go.

[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.620]
I'm going to put it on a silicone Valley Freakonomic speech.

[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.780]
I know if I left it, I'm long enough.

[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:54.840]
What he wants to do.

[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.460]
There's a little blitzkrieg, another ass-licker.

[01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.000]
And of course, what's his name?

[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:58.600]
Lou Dobbs.

[01:06:58.680 --> 01:06:59.300]
Oh, my God.

[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:02.540]
I think Lou is going to have the hair down over the forehead in the mustache tonight.

[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.980]
The airfield, the aerosonic clara, California.

[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:06.160]
Right.

[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.540]
Luckily, it's the boy of the aircraft.

[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:10.200]
See, you know what they're so stupid, but they don't understand.

[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:12.500]
It's because of the success of Fox.

[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:15.720]
They think that Fox, see, like I told you before, it's like Rush Limbaugh.

[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:16.580]
Right.

[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:18.120]
Rush Limbaugh.

[01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.360]
There, you've got his big numbers, his great success.

[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:23.600]
And then Bill O'Rally comes on a radio on a national network.

[01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:25.600]
And a year later, he's got Zilch.

[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.760]
Because Rush Limbaugh's got all those ditto heads.

[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:29.860]
And the same with Fox News.

[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.840]
The ditto heads aren't going to turn over to CNN.

[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:34.900]
No matter how right wing they become, they're not going to turn over to MSNBC.

[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:37.940]
No matter how many Joe Scarborough's or Michael Savage's, they put on a year.

[01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:40.120]
Follow what I'm saying?

[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:40.540]
Yeah.

[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:42.720]
So they're just shooting themselves in a feat.

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:43.480]
That's all they're doing.

[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.340]
While depriving the opportunity for a little bit of choice on your waves,

[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.220]
which is what I'm hearing, I want the news.

[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.460]
I'm tuned into a CDCA.

[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:54.880]
The athletes are concerned that this is not a concern.

[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.940]
85% of the venues for the athletes.

[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.980]
Much in some real freaking news, as opposed to this propaganda and cheerleading.

[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:04.180]
And a bunch of assholes who used to be journalists and suits with pom-pom.

[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:07.280]
Kind of embarrassing, you know, when you turn on the network news,

[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.860]
and I'll stand there, my like, like there would be a football game.

[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:20.120]
5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:22.200]
Don't let me forget I want to do this other one story.

[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.480]
Don't forget the L.A. Times.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.940]
Medium and op-leaves have muzzle-dissented because she had this last call or she inspired me to read it.

[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:30.260]
Don't let me forget.

[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.000]
Okay. Don't forget.

[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:33.640]

[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:42.080]
2AM.

[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:45.640]
Bush, 5.2M!

[01:09:47.320 --> 01:09:47.640]
Oh!

[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:58.260]
Don't like all the hardburns.

[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:02.180]
Don't don't don't ever see.

[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.640]
Don't don't don't let me part in him with you.

[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:14.060]
Don't don't don't call my TV.

[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:16.060]
Hey!

[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.860]
And get to wheel your boat at home.

[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:54.140]
Here you want this.

[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.460]
Don't don't don't let the drumming stupid me.

[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:05.180]
Don't don't don't let this drum get rich, kid.

[01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:08.420]
Don't don't don't let me even.

[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:11.020]
Don't don't let me even.

[01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.560]
He's president of the ****.

[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.700]
He has no care what it's up.

[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.100]
You got him here by the front of the Christian road.

[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:22.260]
No one's up.

[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.200]
You and I have one health, no fear.

[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:27.820]
We've got a great leader here.

[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.360]
With president of ****.

[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.680]
Don't be knocking on the nutty man.

[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.600]
I'm here as a genius who would like you.

[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:36.980]
Oh, my third man.

[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:41.060]
Good, the faction Dennis and Pharaoh who said,

[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:43.860]
Chevron, Texaco reported first quarter earnings yesterday of triple,

[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:45.120]
what they were previously.

[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.660]
They credit higher gas prices.

[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.740]
What do they just call them?

[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.220]
Price gouging.

[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.600]
Absolutely correct.

[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.740]
Between the oil companies and defense contractors,

[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.380]
the contractors, etc.,

[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.060]
Iraq is just a Bush administration's version of government cheese.

[01:11:58.200 --> 01:11:59.480]
Right on target, Dennis.

[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:05.140]
They made all these gigantic prices off of all these profits

[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.220]
of a higher gas prices.

[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:11.640]
The, the, the, you know,

[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.500]
Moe is right about one thing, okay?

[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.040]
Because it's become the by word for business in America.

[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.360]
Gang rape is funny.

[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:18.620]
Right.

[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.580]
It must be funny to them because they just never stop.

[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:22.280]
Yes, a riot.

[01:12:22.860 --> 01:12:23.520]
It's a panic.

[01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.780]
Here's the circle in the LA Times by Ian Masters.

[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:29.520]
Yesterday's LA Times.

[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:32.560]
Media monopolies have muzzle dissent.

[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.480]
It's on our website today.

[01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:37.120]
If information is the oxygen of democracy,

[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.200]
the United States has just been gassed,

[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.920]
not by weapons of mass destruction,

[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.860]
but by a weapon of mass destruction.

[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:46.220]
With George W. Bush basking glorious ratings

[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.800]
and Fox News climbing in the ratings,

[01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:51.140]
we may be moving toward a coronation instead of re-election in 2004.

[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:52.500]
It was, after all,

[01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.040]
Rupert Murdoch's U-Lateral Announcement of Bush's The Winner

[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:58.000]
in the early hours of the morning after the undecided 2000 election

[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.040]
that led Al Gore to foolishly concede

[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:02.960]
because he and the other networks believed what they saw on Fox Television.

[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:05.400]
Now the marriage between a government

[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:07.820]
and its volunteer information ministry has been consecrated

[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:10.200]
by the blessed victory of Operation Iraqi Freedom,

[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:13.960]
the geopolitical equivalent of an OJ meets Joe Millionaire wrapped in the flag.

[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:18.860]
Tolotarian regimes don't tolerate indistinction between journalism and propaganda,

[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:20.320]
but in most democracies,

[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.260]
it's unprecedented for the free press to abandon Joseph Pulitzer

[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:25.100]
for the methods of Joseph Germals.

[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:26.880]
How did it born again?

[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.940]
Family values administration get in bed with a purveyor of misogyny

[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:31.680]
and mayhem, trash and titillation.

[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:33.980]
The common thread for all the public piety

[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.440]
has to be the late Lee Atwater,

[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:39.260]
who was spread mentor and role model to George W. Carl Rove and Roger Ails,

[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.580]
the headhound in the Fox pound of junkyard attack dog journalism.

[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.000]
This undemocratic confluence of politics and propaganda

[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.420]
has long been in the making as a corporate media

[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.740]
has been increasingly empowered by a public influence

[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:53.200]
input and interest have been eliminated.

[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:57.000]
The transformation of active citizens into passive consumers

[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.580]
was enabled by the FCC,

[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:00.560]
Under Ronald Reagan's Mark Fowler,

[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:03.520]
who declared the perceptive broadcatchers as community trustees

[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.960]
should be replaced by a view of broadcatchers as

[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.460]
market place participants.

[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:09.880]
Welcome to America, Mr. Murdoch,

[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:12.200]
you can buy the airwaves and who knows some day the presidency.

[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:16.100]
TV's Fox could not get away with the chain with shilling for the White House

[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.960]
if the fairness doctrine were still in place

[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.620]
and radio's clear channel monopoly

[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:22.540]
would not be able to impose wall-to-wall limbaugh hand in the ensabbage

[01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:25.320]
on the public if broadcatchers were accountable to public opinion

[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:28.140]
rather than the dictates of plutocrats.

[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.540]
How could it be in the land of the free and the home of the brave Americans

[01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:32.440]
or afraid of opinions?

[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:36.480]
Where are the Tom Pains, the Mark Twains, the Minkins, the Aida Tarbills?

[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.260]
The set is not gone away.

[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.340]
It's just been marginalized by monopolies and relegated to the

[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.520]
interstices of the Internet.

[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:45.680]
What?

[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.120]
Exactly.

[01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.360]
What we always got to have won.

[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:52.080]
But the hammer is about to drop on the Internet too.

[01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:55.200]
The head of the FCC, Michael Powell, wants to give away what's left of the

[01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.580]
store to the broadband cable and satellite providers and make them gatekeepers

[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.240]
or toolboots on the information highway.

[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:03.680]
It used to be that the Internet was accessed by a common carrier

[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.360]
the phone company, but as the counties moved forward, these new

[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.580]
unregulated medium monopolies have increasing control over the information

[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:10.080]
pipeline.

[01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:13.420]
Without regulation, they have the ability to choose what content they provide.

[01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:16.960]
Two FCC commissioners wanted to lay this hand over and encourage public

[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.580]
debate, but the public is largely unaware of what's at stake.

[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:23.020]
Obviously, you can't expect the limbaugh's or rallies in their bosses

[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.900]
or their president in the White House to give them talking points of preserving

[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.740]
diversity of opinion while they're still attached to sell.

[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:30.220]
So speak up, Americans.

[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:30.800]
You're a country.

[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:31.680]
They're your airwaves.

[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:35.040]
Maybe you can pursue the American dream while you're asleep, but it'll be

[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:37.200]
too late to reclaim your country's freedom when you wake up.

[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.740]
Ian Masters, host of background briefing on KPFKF and Los Angeles.

[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:45.580]
Right on target, baby.

[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.340]
And today has made the second year with that means don't you see a 30 days

[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:51.540]
from today, one month from today?

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:51.940]
Yeah.

[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.120]
June the 2th.

[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:53.880]
Mark it on a calendar.

[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:58.700]
That's today that the FCC will put the final nail in the coffin of radio.

[01:15:59.300 --> 01:15:59.800]
That'll be it.

[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:00.240]
It will be done.

[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.160]
Bob Dunn, as Mickey would say, to his close personal friend.

[01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:10.900]
Oh, I said, five six seven oh five 60 pound five 60.

[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:11.520]
Am I right?

[01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:12.160]
Absolutely correct.

[01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.160]
So you just want another excuse to play that WQA.

[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:16.360]
I'm hello.

[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.100]
Yeah, I wanted to speak to Neil about the poll speaking.

[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:22.100]
I need help.

[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:22.620]
How you doing?

[01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:28.240]
I wanted to put one in about how you paly.

[01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:29.560]
Oh, I still am.

[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.080]
I'm surprised that one isn't on there.

[01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.680]
Well, that's because George you've got it in his I don't have it in my thing here.

[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.200]
You got it, George?

[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:35.240]
I'm sneezing.

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.480]
He's got it.

[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.220]
Okay, great.

[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:39.220]
Have a great day.

[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.220]
You too, thanks.

[01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:40.620]
Hi.

[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:41.800]
I'm waiting.

[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:42.560]
Oh, yeah, paly.

[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:43.100]
Sorry.

[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:43.640]
Oh.

[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.080]
Oh, it's so shrill.

[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:51.860]
And the new deal now every morning from his hospital bed, he feels compelled to call a

[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.840]
beater boy in there.

[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.980]
Don't tell me when he calls again anymore.

[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:55.400]
Would you please?

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.020]
If you think about getting paid again at any time in the future, he has a bus.

[01:17:02.860 --> 01:17:04.820]
Don't tell me he's on a phone.

[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.600]
And don't discuss with him about beds, about anything.

[01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:11.900]
Just forget that he knows me.

[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:12.200]
Okay.

[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.120]
In fact, if he should call say, oh, Neil died of SARS in Toronto.

[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.240]
Yeah, that would be a good line.

[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.140]
WQA, I'm hello.

[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.060]
Neil.

[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:21.820]
Yes, sir.

[01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.280]
I got a couple of favorite ones.

[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:23.920]
Okay.

[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:26.420]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving.

[01:17:26.900 --> 01:17:27.100]
Right.

[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:28.180]
Now, do we put that on there?

[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:28.440]
Yes.

[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:29.360]
What's on it?

[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:29.960]
I'm sorry.

[01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:32.400]
How about Dr. Diffomeric Catherine, Jesus?

[01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:33.520]
Oh, excellent.

[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:36.340]
She has a lot of more emotion than father or tool.

[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:37.200]
Exactly.

[01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:37.980]
Okay, thanks.

[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.900]
Well, Neil, also, Johnny Dr. Nassau?

[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:42.520]
Yes.

[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:43.320]
Oh, you mean a bit.

[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:43.660]
Okay.

[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.280]
Dr. Mary Catherine, Jesus.

[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:47.580]
That's good.

[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.060]
I mean, like I said, you can put it on or not as the case.

[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:52.540]
Johnny Dr. Diffomer.

[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:58.420]
Like I said, we like Johnny Dr. Diffomeric.

[01:17:58.420 --> 01:17:58.740]
Yeah.

[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:00.420]
That was cookies.

[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:02.580]
That was special.

[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.000]
Well, I mean, no, he came by the one day and he's a good guy.

[01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.880]
And I remember I turned him on to go into Europe when after he got screwed over by cost broadcasting.

[01:18:11.260 --> 01:18:14.100]
And they fired his ass off the coast and they paid him off to go away.

[01:18:15.420 --> 01:18:17.000]
And he said, you think I should go to Europe?

[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.400]
My whole life, I've never been there.

[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:20.200]
And so I encourage him to go.

[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.520]
I've never ran into a man and a stem, but nevertheless when he got back, he gave me the run down.

[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:25.160]
He loved it.

[01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:26.240]
He had the time of his life.

[01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:27.500]
Thank me profusely.

[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:30.420]
And so we came in that one day and we fed him.

[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.220]
We had Pony Taylor.

[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.800]
Somebody bring in some lunch and we fed him.

[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.280]
But you know, Johnny is a good guy, but he's an FN guy.

[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:37.560]
He's a 82 along the coast.

[01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:38.880]
You know, he doesn't have nothing to say.

[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:41.600]
Yeah.

[01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.160]
And he didn't have nothing to say.

[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:48.100]
And then, you know, and he killed some time and I really do mean killed it.

[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:52.140]
And he was stuck to be the sidekick because he was out of work at that time.

[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:52.900]
I hope he's doing well.

[01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:53.560]
I like Johnny.

[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:55.880]
And spread it all over the trip.

[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.860]
So what was that cowboy place you staying out in?

[01:18:58.060 --> 01:18:58.320]
Doodahs.

[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.060]
Doodahs.

[01:18:59.100 --> 01:18:59.320]
That's right.

[01:18:59.540 --> 01:18:59.860]
Doodah.

[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:00.460]
Doodah.

[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:02.260]
In fact, you look at Johnny kind of thing.

[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:02.960]
Doodah.

[01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:03.480]
Doodah.

[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:04.860]
He's a good guy.

[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:08.140]
But then one day somebody came by.

[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:10.540]
Was it Freaky Carlos from our friend?

[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:12.180]
Yeah.

[01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:13.540]
Maybe you just got the message on the phone.

[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:14.880]
Johnny Dark is out here.

[01:19:14.980 --> 01:19:16.600]
He wants to come in and see me out in the middle of the show.

[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:20.960]
This was a couple of months later, like I was going to have him in there again to put the audience into a coma.

[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.540]
Uh-uh.

[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:22.360]
No thanks Johnny.

[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:23.480]
You're a good guy.

[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.620]
We'd be having to feed you.

[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:25.240]
Doodahs.

[01:19:25.900 --> 01:19:26.300]
Doodahs.

[01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.960]
But don't go away, man.

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:28.660]
Just go away.

[01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:31.260]
Absolutely correct.

[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:32.340]
There's 78 votes.

[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:34.440]
In fact, it just changed it again.

[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:36.500]
And it's plus 78 votes.

[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.440]
Uh, 63 votes for...

[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.320]
About 30, man.

[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.420]
Put the lotion in the basket 43.

[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.040]
No fags in the church 41.

[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:46.400]
Dying over here 37.

[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.420]
Your gay 37.

[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:49.660]
Doodah.

[01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:49.980]
Doodah.

[01:19:49.980 --> 01:19:50.660]
30.

[01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.100]
How many is it, guys?

[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.100]
About 30, man.

[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:54.800]
Eyes near 27.

[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.240]
Mandage keychain 26.

[01:19:57.520 --> 01:19:57.760]
Oi.

[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.040]
Oi.

[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:00.080]
22.

[01:20:00.380 --> 01:20:01.980]
Nobody says that quite like Mitch Lewis, you know.

[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:02.460]
Oi.

[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:04.460]
It's just a certain enthusiasm, whether what she says it.

[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:10.160]
And he really captures the ambiance, the essence of South Florida and exactly what it is when he says.

[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:10.780]
Oi.

[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:11.900]
And also...

[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:12.240]
Rectum.

[01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:16.900]
That's the American effin ways God 20.

[01:20:17.980 --> 01:20:18.420]
Rectum.

[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.300]
Like how do you like that?

[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:19.760]
Rectum.

[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:20.780]
So, psychic yen has 20.

[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.200]
20 rectums.

[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:23.460]
Uh-huh.

[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.300]
You're moving up a little bit there, George 13.

[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:29.020]
In fact, you show you what good company, Ren, it's tied with fish food.

[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:30.800]
Would you like some fish food?

[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:31.520]
Uh-huh.

[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:35.760]
Oh, Pat Turnnell's Steps aside is FBI Probe's Conduct.

[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:36.540]
Oh, geez.

[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:38.760]
This wasn't the hero yesterday.

[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:44.580]
Pat Turnnell, the larger-than-life union chief who built Remanem Abbey Day Teachers Union, placed himself on indefinitely ones.

[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:47.540]
They were a federal investigator of his probe, whether he is in bezel dues.

[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:53.880]
I don't want to impede the ability of the United Teachers of Day to continue to represent teachers and children, Dave County said to him,

[01:20:53.980 --> 01:20:57.740]
or interviewed from Tevla Hasse where he's been lobbying lawmakers in last month.

[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.380]
I don't want any distractions from that.

[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.600]
The announcement came a day after the FBI raided the union's headquarters, seizing records about how properties were bought,

[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:10.120]
trips funded, and mine distributed to Tournillo and his associates, Tournillo denies any wrongdoing.

[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:16.540]
The United Teachers of Day will be temporarily overseen by an administrator from the Union's National affiliate who will inherit the organization's...

[01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:22.020]
...dire financial situation and a daunting political task of restarting Stalt Contract Negotiations.

[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.360]
Is there anything good going on a day?

[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:24.640]
No.

[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:27.120]
Is there anything like, are there any politicians who can be trusted?

[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:27.360]
No.

[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:31.300]
I'm not saying, you know, he deserves his day in court, Pat Turnnell, I don't know one or the other.

[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:34.780]
But it just seems to me that there's always this taint, this kind of...

[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:36.520]
...your Roma that can smell all the way up here.

[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:42.740]
The United Law is his fourth-wing democracy in the U.S.

[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:47.200]
Why the U.S. do you...

[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:48.960]
That's the only correct answer.

[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.820]
That is great, Bobby Mercer from Madison, Wisconsin.

[01:21:55.240 --> 01:22:00.400]
How I didn't even know there was a second verse to that limerick about Man Tucket. It pays to stay in school, doesn't it?

[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:05.840]
But anyway, let's bring out our next guest here on America's most untelated kid.

[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:09.640]
All the way from Seattle, Washington, here to sing, let me entertain you.

[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:13.720]
Won't you please give a warm welcome to Little Dicky Ficker Nickel!

[01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:14.900]
Dicky!

[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:29.280]
Let me entertain you, and we'll have a real good time.

[01:22:30.060 --> 01:22:36.660]
Let me entertain you, and we'll have a real good time.

[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:43.060]
Dicky Ficker Nickel, you know, Dicky in that little green suit, you look like a Pimp leprechaun or something.

[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.460]
I don't know, it's just...

[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.740]
Anyway, Joe, what did you think?

[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:48.740]
He sucked.

[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.020]
Okay, when he sucked, eh, though...

[01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:52.620]
I'd say the same thing, he sucked.

[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.340]
Okay, suck number two, Jerry.

[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:58.780]
Really, really awful. I would just say plain sucky.

[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:01.980]
Ooh, Dicky, that's a nice score. It sucks sucking a sucky.

[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:04.660]
That's quick enough to have you qualified for the finals next week.

[01:23:04.660 --> 01:23:06.880]
I'm sick, I can't wait!

[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:12.300]
All right, good luck to Dicky, and we'll catch you next time on America's Most On!

[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.740]
Till I did kid, goodbye everybody.

[01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:20.780]
Perfectly good, and this one during that grade, so I'm watching CBC, which I have under an insure everyday,

[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.940]
and they're like doing news, you know, like real news stories.

[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.420]
So because of what that lady was saying in the article, I just read, I flipped over to CB, a CNN and MSNBC.

[01:23:28.660 --> 01:23:30.020]
Oh, I've been here. Thanks for the word.

[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:34.780]
The US is Abraham Lincoln, we've got pictures of sailors on air.

[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.820]
Hey, sailor!

[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.660]
It ain't airy fly-sure, it's a set of a message.

[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.600]
Hey, sailor!

[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:43.760]
And the wires in there hugging their little babies, and then I switch over to MSNBC.

[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.040]
Uh-huh. I guess what's on MSNBC, yeah.

[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:47.280]
Thank you.

[01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:47.840]
That's touching.

[01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:51.360]
Now, you are his girlfriend, his girlfriend.

[01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.080]
Now, have you spotted him?

[01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:54.480]
No, what we thought?

[01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.120]
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you right now, seriously, if there's anybody in this audience,

[01:23:57.120 --> 01:24:00.680]
or anywhere in the world who really is stupid enough to believe that this is news.

[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:08.140]
And I can understand if this were the variation rather than the norm, if this were the exception right,

[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.740]
then I would say, okay, well, let's put something on here like a feel-good kind of a story of puff peace.

[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:14.320]
But that's all there is.

[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.100]
This is all there is.

[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:19.700]
Non-stop total opportunities, and non-stop pepper alleys.

[01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.200]
That's what the talking heads are involved with, round the clock 24-7 now.

[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:23.560]
Ready, huh?

[01:24:25.480 --> 01:24:25.840]
Maybe.

[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:27.600]
And she's putting a microphone up there.

[01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:29.380]
Are you on the MSNBC?

[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:30.720]
No.

[01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:31.100]
I have no.

[01:24:31.100 --> 01:24:33.240]
She's got the microphone in the face of this little kid.

[01:24:33.260 --> 01:24:34.120]
He's about three years old.

[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:34.760]
What's he gonna say?

[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:36.500]
He's gonna make a speech?

[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.700]
And he's like any three year old kid, like looking at her, like scratching his head, like what the hell do I want, bitch?

[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:42.380]
Yeah, right.

[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:46.720]
Oh my god, and this is going on non-stop round the clock.

[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.340]
Home, there's on it.

[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.520]
What was it like when you first-

[01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.520]
The other young couple, say it over there's a wife and young baby.

[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:56.860]
I can stop shaking.

[01:24:57.040 --> 01:24:57.780]
I was very excited.

[01:24:58.140 --> 01:24:58.680]
Very happy.

[01:24:58.940 --> 01:24:59.600]
What did you say now?

[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:00.060]
Oh.

[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.660]
I just mentioned these things in passing, okay?

[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.200]
I mean, wouldn't it be just like a little bit of balance, a little bit of truth, a little bit of really what's going on?

[01:25:08.220 --> 01:25:14.400]
And the fact that the electricity is still out most of the most of the Baghdad, and that they're continuing all the stuff going on.

[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:16.480]
Now, we don't want to tell you the truth.

[01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.100]
What we want to do is go step along, because we want to be willing co-participants in this, so whatever the hell this exercise is called.

[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:23.880]
Fashion?

[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.600]
I think that's what I was looking for.

[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:31.500]
560-560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.180]
I'm dying out of hands.

[01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:53.780]
I have no life.

[01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:57.540]
I need you out.

[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.020]
It's good.

[01:25:58.280 --> 01:25:58.900]
I need you out.

[01:25:59.140 --> 01:25:59.280]
I need you out.

[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.560]
I'll take some calls.

[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:05.040]
I'll get all more written depressed about it, because I didn't going to change.

[01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:10.460]
If you really want to know what's going on in the world, go to the Internet, at least for the time being, until they start digging with that too.

[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:13.360]
Go to the Internet, read a whole bunch of stuff.

[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:16.140]
And certainly don't waste your time with the weekly readers.

[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:19.340]
The news paid the two-day reasons how 40 won't learn nothing from them.

[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:21.880]
W-D-Q-A-M.

[01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:23.840]
You know how to go on?

[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:24.360]
Okay.

[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.940]
I don't quite know what you call, but it's a lady going home.

[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:30.480]
You know God or something like that.

[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:31.400]
You know which one that is?

[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:31.940]
Sure.

[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:33.980]
Yeah, that's great.

[01:26:34.140 --> 01:26:35.500]
And one is your personal one.

[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:37.440]
Trust me when I tell you.

[01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:39.420]
Okay.

[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:43.120]
And one other thing, my stod here?

[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:44.220]
I'm still here.

[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.460]
And you're still there.

[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.340]
I must be a maficist.

[01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:50.500]
You know, I got it, man.

[01:26:50.620 --> 01:26:52.460]
I listened to shit yesterday.

[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.380]
You listen to what?

[01:26:54.140 --> 01:26:54.640]
N-N-N.

[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:56.100]
Oh, Schmett, I thought you said something else.

[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:58.920]
Pongers, man.

[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.900]
This whole thing was a system.

[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:04.200]
President Lannan on the flight deck and all this stuff.

[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.420]
I think I go to the seat, so it's beyond the read.

[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:07.440]
It's not.

[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:08.460]
And this is newsworthy.

[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.320]
What's going on here today?

[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.440]
It's just basically making things easier.

[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.420]
Well, that's your compound, man.

[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.660]
I know, bro.

[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:16.620]
Take care of them.

[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:17.060]
Hang on there.

[01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:17.940]
Hang on there.

[01:27:18.740 --> 01:27:20.120]
To be honest with you, I'm sorry.

[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:20.840]
That was that other pull.

[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:25.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pong, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:26.900]
Oh, this is a good story.

[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:27.680]
This is kind of cute.

[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:29.080]
Put a little smirk on your push.

[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:30.900]
Sodom, scene in London.

[01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:32.800]
We have it on our website.

[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:34.480]
Now do we have the pictures that go with this or not?

[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.180]
But of course.

[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:37.260]
Of course.

[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:38.020]
Leave it to being a boy.

[01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:39.120]
He doesn't miss a trick, man.

[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.600]
That's what they said at Treasure Island.

[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:44.240]
Sodom was saying it appeared to turn up in London today.

[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:48.560]
This was yesterday, as dozens of hopefuls attended auditions to find a look alike of the

[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:49.660]
former Racky Dick hitter.

[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:54.620]
Short, thin, clean, shaven ginger haired in in one case, female candidates.

[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.340]
Oh, it's those British women, you know.

[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:01.680]
Who thought they bore resemblance to Sodom, who's still missing after the Winer Rack assembly

[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.340]
of the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, England.

[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.340]
They were handed army jackets, black berets, and false moustaches, and asked to walk across

[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:11.120]
the stage in wave to an imaginary crowd.

[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:16.900]
Chouts of next, Phil de Auditorium, as the Sodom doppled gangers, Grinminiocally, gave

[01:28:16.900 --> 01:28:19.880]
regal waves and attempted to strut around the stage despotically.

[01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:21.380]
What is a doppled ganger?

[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:23.760]
A shape shifting creature that copies its victims.

[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:24.680]
I see.

[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:30.160]
Charlie Shark, 21, a computer support worker from Isle Isle Worth, said, a colleague said

[01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:31.420]
it would be a good idea to come down.

[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:34.700]
I've had 13 years of Joseph work ever since Sodom invaded Kuwait.

[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:39.060]
The localizer needed for the West End's satirical review, follow my leader, which is due

[01:28:39.060 --> 01:28:40.100]
to open at the end of June.

[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:43.980]
In Presario Raymond Goubae said, we had no idea who was going to turn up today, but

[01:28:43.980 --> 01:28:45.800]
I'm pleased to see we've had one or two good examples.

[01:28:46.580 --> 01:28:48.240]
And if they were unsure, they could just go to Baghdad.

[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.460]
I'm sure they'll find dozens.

[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.900]
Whole bunch of localizing Baghdad.

[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.200]
At least.

[01:28:54.700 --> 01:28:58.320]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 60 on the 18T line.

[01:28:58.320 --> 01:28:59.240]
The mad dog at one.

[01:28:59.380 --> 01:28:59.860]
Oh, right.

[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.340]
And then we got 80K for Hank from Vegas to three.

[01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.820]
Josh Friedman briefly for a fat half hour.

[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:06.180]
7, 7, 7, 30.

[01:29:06.540 --> 01:29:09.380]
Wouldn't that be a great idea for a show where he could just get off his sports?

[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:10.860]
Lunch along with Josh.

[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:12.520]
Huh?

[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.540]
I think it's a winner.

[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:15.880]
I think we got a winner.

[01:29:16.460 --> 01:29:20.320]
And just listen to the sounds of, in fact, Josh and the Beast.

[01:29:21.620 --> 01:29:22.100]
Right?

[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:24.040]
Having a feast.

[01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:26.100]
A feast with Josh and the Beast.

[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:27.460]
I think it a 40 share.

[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:28.000]
At least.

[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.880]
A third man.

[01:29:29.260 --> 01:29:29.260]

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:34.420]
As they just said that we could have food brought in ponies, he'll bring it in and just

[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:35.340]
a whole bunch of folks.

[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:36.300]
So, a corkies?

[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:36.820]
Yeah.

[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:42.500]
Sure as hell be talking about that stupid same sports crap every day.

[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:44.160]
Line and local.

[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:46.640]
We're sports radio 560s.

[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.120]
UAM.

[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.880]
One moment, please.

[01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.400]
You having a problem there, me?

[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:58.040]
A beater boy?

[01:29:58.520 --> 01:29:58.720]
Yep.

[01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:00.080]
Yeah.

[01:30:00.680 --> 01:30:02.360]
Is he going to do something or is that it?

[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:02.960]
Oh.

[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.560]
不是?

[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.840]
Oh yeah, we're searching

[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:16.260]
All up for the weapons of the structure everyday

[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:20.400]
We're gonna get searching

[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:24.220]
Ooh, no, no, searchin'

[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:30.420]
I must say, searchin' for the new city away

[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:31.980]
I have no idea

[01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:36.840]
But I don't think we'll ever find them

[01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:40.800]
They're buried there in the first place

[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.800]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.100]
Don't find them

[01:30:45.980 --> 01:30:47.540]
Hi, son of a wafalo

[01:30:47.540 --> 01:30:50.560]
I know, come house to house

[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.520]
And wonder if they're a hunter

[01:30:53.520 --> 01:31:00.280]
New validate the spin of all those white house dogs

[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.100]
If you still need no Vincent to live

[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.520]
Watch your sea and head

[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:11.460]
All the doors are lying from

[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.500]
Ooh, baby

[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:16.100]
But we'll keep on searching

[01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:19.880]
Ooh, no, no, searchin'

[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:23.380]
We'll keep the hand of the blue dog

[01:31:23.380 --> 01:31:26.120]
All the new city away

[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:33.080]
But you know they ain't gonna find them

[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:37.200]
No, ain't never had them in the late

[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:41.280]
12.43, this is just in San Diego

[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.760]
But the good news is, bush to speak on economy 12.30 on CNN live

[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:46.380]
12.50, I'm sorry

[01:31:46.380 --> 01:31:49.740]
So we've only got seven more minutes to have to endure this naval attack

[01:31:49.740 --> 01:31:54.360]
Also can launch missiles, S3, Vikings

[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.180]
We've heard that when Eric flashed yourself these images

[01:31:56.180 --> 01:31:57.920]
He said, oh my god, see food for lunch

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.020]
That's what I heard

[01:32:01.480 --> 01:32:03.300]
You think you're gonna miss understood? Maybe

[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.100]
So now you understand why I absolutely refuse to watch any more than necessary

[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:11.820]
CNN, MSNBC, and certainly not FoxFascist news

[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:15.420]
And the worst news of all being, Mark Garagos

[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:17.520]
See, you look at all of this and you say to yourself

[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:22.680]
Either I've lost my sanity or I have to do everything I can to escape from all of this

[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:24.340]
But secondly, you know what I'm saying?

[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.900]
I was questioning it there for a while

[01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:30.800]
It's just the same old same old, it never ends

[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:34.260]
Mark Garagos, an anti-grace, an anti-grace, an anti-grace, and his margaragos

[01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.200]
And of course our very close personal friend Larry

[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:39.820]
We'll be having his nightly panel and here's Mark Garagos with a big Mustang

[01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:43.280]
Who is defending a Robert Blake when I was busy defending Scott Peterson

[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.080]
And what's the use?

[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:53.820]
Well what is the use? Because the message from the messenger is that we all must be glued 24-7 to this

[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:55.520]
And this is what we ought to be concerned about

[01:32:55.520 --> 01:32:59.560]
This is what our lives should consist of is the swill that they're feeding to us

[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:02.580]
The propaganda, the bull crap, the photo opportunities

[01:33:03.800 --> 01:33:06.100]
Just tell me, good year is on the shore

[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:09.260]
I'm serious, I won't let's see, I'd like to break his kneecaps

[01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:10.480]
You know, I hate to say that

[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:13.220]
Why? I would like to, huh? Why would you hate to say that?

[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:16.080]
I am enjoying saying it, I'd like to break his kneecaps

[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:17.120]
We'll flip screen

[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:19.440]
What an ultimate shield

[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:22.960]
I mean, Lou Dobbs, at least he finally came out of the right wing closet

[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:24.900]
But this guy who pretends to be a journalist

[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:27.520]
You know the day that CNN really went down to Crapper?

[01:33:28.220 --> 01:33:30.520]
Is that the day the one Bernard Shaw retired

[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:31.480]
You're right

[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:34.120]
Oh, he wouldn't have put up on any of this crap

[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:38.640]
But nevertheless, and maybe for the right price

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.980]
Now this facts from Carl and Sedona Arizona, do you ask a bean of boy about this?

[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:43.420]
No

[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.500]
So as I can't find the article on your website

[01:33:46.500 --> 01:33:49.400]
You read about 30 minutes ago concerning the profits of several corporations

[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:51.600]
And their role in this war for profit can help me find it

[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.180]
I don't know what story he was talking about

[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.220]
He said, he's going to be about what is it?

[01:33:55.300 --> 01:33:58.040]
It's a yesterday story, the one that you read yesterday and you reread it today

[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:00.700]
But what is the heading on it, you know?

[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.140]
Find out, can you make a couple seconds?

[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:04.420]
I'll give you a, don't see, there he goes again

[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:07.600]
You've got him conditioned to being too a pressure pack there

[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.880]
Just relax, take your time if you find it great

[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.840]
If not, time's up

[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:15.720]
Time's up

[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:19.760]
Not seriously, I mean just if you find it great, I'm sure the Carl will appreciate it

[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.440]
Because he's an avid listener on the internet

[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:24.940]
He says, keep up the good work there, more of us than the goose stepping meaty will allow us to know

[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:26.940]
Love you, Neil, love you, etc. and so on

[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.100]
Oh yeah, now that's one

[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:30.380]
All the way, you never play that

[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:32.460]
Jen probably could have said so embarrassing

[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:34.000]
Hi

[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:35.680]
This is Jim

[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.160]
Love your show, Neil, love you

[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.860]
That's Randy, that's the god of Jesus

[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.780]
Husband or I guess that's what we call him, isn't it?

[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.140]
It's her other

[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.580]
Her other what?

[01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:49.040]
Her other exactly

[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.860]
Her other penis?

[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:54.760]
You know when there's a list of things to check off at the bottom there's always other when nothing else applies

[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.820]
Oh, that would definitely be him, his her other

[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.860]
That's how he fills up

[01:34:58.860 --> 01:35:02.060]
When he fills out the thing where it says sex, MF or other

[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:03.360]
What is it now?

[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.080]
The title of the article is Defense CEOs or big winners of Iraq war

[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:09.420]
Right, Defense CEOs

[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:13.900]
Thank you, Benaboy, Nate, you can find that on the website if you go to the page from yesterday

[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:15.040]
The features page, right?

[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.380]
The features page, click on the features page on our website

[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:20.800]
Which is really great now because now Benaboy's got it by week

[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:25.340]
I looked at that yesterday for the first time in a while and that's getting just better and better

[01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:28.840]
If I were somebody, I don't want to mention no names because it is Friday and it's the long weekend

[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.500]
But if I were somebody, I'd be so embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated

[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:35.940]
The fact that this little punk came in and turned a once

[01:35:37.960 --> 01:35:38.760]
Baron website

[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.300]
Into one another gets routinely over quarter of a million hits every day

[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:47.920]
And I will re-state what I said yesterday and it's got nothing to do with jealousy around

[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:49.540]
Although I would like more and more people to see it

[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:53.100]
But when you look at that sludge report from Miss Sludge on air

[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.860]
And look at all the drudgery that she puts on

[01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:58.860]
And realize that there are millions of people clicking on it

[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:00.980]
And I still say look at it again today

[01:36:00.980 --> 01:36:03.880]
We saw that huge picture of George W. when that silly outfit on

[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:06.720]
I flew the plane, I flew the plane ride

[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.240]
Yeah, fly away on this

[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:12.000]
And then you realize he's getting those millions of hits and there's nothing on it

[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.420]
It's just basically a black and white page, occasionally a color photo and that's about it

[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:17.840]
Just a black and white page

[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:21.240]
With about 50,000 links and that's it

[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:23.920]
That's a website

[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:26.080]
Oh, oh, you got Bill Snyder on CNN

[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:28.160]
He better not say something controversial or cut him off

[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:29.580]
People continue to be on the agenda

[01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.900]
But he wants to focus now on the economy

[01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:34.780]
Because Americans are very worried about the economy

[01:36:35.340 --> 01:36:37.000]
He knows what happened to his father when he was...

[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.560]
Yeah, that's right, it's going to happen to him too

[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.560]
You wait till Bobby Graham till B.D. by AdVyam

[01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:44.540]
I hope that'd be great, we'll have our own candidate for governor

[01:36:45.340 --> 01:36:46.040]
It would be nice

[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:48.920]
It would be nice

[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.820]
A man that's got the balls, a man who's been telling like it is

[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:55.900]
The real story about the threat of terrorism in America is opposed to all of B.S

[01:36:55.900 --> 01:36:58.460]
The bull crap have been getting all the lies, the propaganda

[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:00.000]
You go, boy

[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.060]
W.D. Q.A. and hello

[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:02.820]
Nail?

[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:03.640]
Yes, sir

[01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:04.620]
What are you doing?

[01:37:05.100 --> 01:37:05.340]
Great

[01:37:05.340 --> 01:37:08.140]
I just wanted to tell you a wolf blister

[01:37:08.140 --> 01:37:09.940]
It's biggest foamy on the face of the earth

[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.160]
I used to work at the end and back when they actually gathered news

[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:14.540]
Right

[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:17.640]
One time I just give you a wolf blister story

[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.920]
I'm not a wedding with him

[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.440]
In mid-sentence, he walks away from me

[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:27.660]
He doesn't even leave an effort to pretend that he's listening to me

[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:29.300]
He's an asshole

[01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.940]
He's from Buffalo

[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:35.800]
Anyone from Buffalo, like wolf blitz, are usually people from Buffalo

[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.920]
W.D. Graber is the only person from Buffalo I've ever met in my life who was like a decent human being

[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:41.960]
There you go

[01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:45.640]
Say hello to Hyde, how we meet her for me while you're up there

[01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:46.660]
Okay

[01:37:46.660 --> 01:37:48.300]
And you have a good day

[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:50.560]
And Ted Brande, the Bill Barilco too

[01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.540]
Very good

[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:52.500]
See ya

[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:54.920]
And Fawster Hewitt and Bill Hewitt

[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:55.840]
Oh, you know what?

[01:37:56.180 --> 01:38:00.140]
See the whole show is just about passed on much and all this propaganda there and propaganda TV

[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:04.700]
We go right back down state to tell you why

[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.140]
That's right, the South Jersey pine barons are beautiful

[01:38:08.140 --> 01:38:12.140]
You can tell if the leaf season is over they've got fishing shows on leaf TV

[01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:13.940]
Yeah, it's true

[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:18.140]
The show that's on right now may believe some America they show a hockey player's fishing

[01:38:18.140 --> 01:38:21.280]
I guess they might as well because they're not playing hockey now, at least not the ones who play here

[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:24.720]
Oh and there's church-yield downs, look at that there's Hank riding the horse

[01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:28.340]
No audio though, damn it, I hate when that happens

[01:38:28.340 --> 01:38:30.220]
There's Hank on a big, yeah fat one

[01:38:31.700 --> 01:38:32.720]
W.Q.I.M.

[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:33.640]
Hello

[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:34.560]
Yes sir

[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:35.680]
Hey Neil

[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:36.600]
How you doing?

[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:39.920]
Yeah, I'd like to give you a horse for the Kentucky Derby

[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:46.800]
I think if it comes down to a street fight at the end which it will, Buddy Gill will be the one with Gary Stevens

[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:51.560]
Who breaks his number eight post right next to India Express by the way

[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:55.380]
I know, I know, they flood it out in the sand and eat a Derby which I'm sure you stop

[01:38:55.380 --> 01:38:56.140]
Right

[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.220]
Okay, hey Neil hold on to somebody with a telly sign

[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:00.960]
Neil

[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.880]
Yes, man

[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.220]
Bobby Churro, I love you Neil

[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.220]
Okay sweetheart

[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:06.360]
Alright, bye-bye

[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:07.420]
Bye-bye

[01:39:09.140 --> 01:39:15.180]
Indian Express, Kentucky Derby, now let's see Dave Johnson picked the chalk, he picked the favorite empire maker, Jerry Bailey

[01:39:15.180 --> 01:39:16.680]
Six to five in the morning line, you know

[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:21.880]
See and now this is probably going to be the favorite finally wins which really really happens in the Derby but

[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:27.340]
I'm just been burned so many times, you know chalk especially in a big feel like that breaking from the 12 post not for me

[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:30.080]
Or now was it the pole position is that what most said?

[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.340]
Just stop and think for a guy that's supposed to be doing sports

[01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:34.880]
Does he know anything about throw road racing?

[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.200]
No, harness racing, no, hockey, no, homos

[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.400]
Yeah, that's the only age that I think he knows about

[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:44.400]
He seems to have like a lot of expertise on that especially that movie with Fagadorin

[01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:52.920]
Right, did you ever hear that character before we ever saw that but still had before he infested in it and you don't want to either

[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:54.480]
Did you see the original archaic apple?

[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:55.920]
Sure, your ages ago

[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:59.300]
Oh, the the the bother by the way Jacob that was named Jacob

[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:01.240]
He was a panic the black color

[01:40:02.060 --> 01:40:05.980]
And I keep thinking of that scene where he put on those shoes that were about 14 sizes to a small

[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:07.800]
That is just choice

[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:11.100]
Wait a minute nobody on there go to Q.I.M. Hello

[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:12.840]
No, yes sir

[01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.000]
Happy Friday to you back to you

[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:15.340]
Back to you

[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:24.480]
Been listening to you since 1990 on the guy that is the optical lab check that works for the Canadian Toronto Optometrist

[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:25.000]
Right

[01:40:26.780 --> 01:40:30.240]
I don't know if you got I listen to you share the first hour this morning

[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:33.040]
Did you get I am that hemorrhoid?

[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.020]
No, that's a good one

[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:38.300]
I have some more that I forgot about him

[01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.320]
I've been trying to call you for about a week and a half

[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.440]
I am that hemorrhoid

[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.780]
I am that hemorrhoid

[01:40:42.780 --> 01:40:43.960]
Is that the great Joey?

[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:46.360]
That's the great Joey Joey Reynolds who said

[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.500]
I am that hemorrhoid

[01:40:47.500 --> 01:40:50.440]
And he also said that I have my nose up meals asked

[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:52.300]
Oh, yeah, I forgot that one

[01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:55.540]
Uh, calls to show you how long I've been listening

[01:40:55.980 --> 01:41:03.260]
Remember the lady from Boko that time that called you three times in one day and you gave her crap on the air for the bus being so nice

[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:06.400]
Let her stand hold for 45 minutes to tell you you suck

[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.220]
Really? I don't remember that

[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.760]
And let me talk to him

[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:11.480]
Oh, I get it

[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:13.320]
He's in the bathroom wet and off of your gun

[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.680]
I heard that and I'm like dying

[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.920]
But that was some lady from Boko

[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.280]
Uh, she called like three times in one day

[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:24.820]
That's what I hear I hear she was from Boko and she called three times in one day

[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:28.840]
Anyway, you were reading about the seminal Indian gaming last week

[01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.280]
Yeah

[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:31.460]
My wife and I go to Tampa a lot

[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.960]
And they have video slots over there

[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.280]
They don't check out cash like the real slots

[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:37.840]
Yeah

[01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.040]
Now we want the real slots

[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:40.300]
We don't want that video crap

[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:41.440]
We want the real slots, man

[01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:42.020]
We want it more

[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:44.100]
We want it tomorrow night at Pompooh Park

[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:47.120]
They're made by ITT, that's who makes the slots too

[01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.940]
Well, we want them now

[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:52.200]
Okay, when I get back to town we're going to have like a big demonstration in protest

[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.560]
We want our slot machines now

[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:55.120]
Have a great day pal and a great weekend

[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.980]
My wife and mom

[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:59.400]
This is 4305 City

[01:41:59.400 --> 01:42:01.180]
Anyway, you weigh

[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.420]
Fully correction

[01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:09.520]
The Middle Easter's world

[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.640]
Will be exploded to dumb at people guilty

[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.260]
With the gas that we sold him

[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:18.280]
First time a crescent nation and

[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.180]
They only want that's growing

[01:42:20.180 --> 01:42:22.380]
Now more blood will be spilled

[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:24.500]
To get that oil going

[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:25.300]
Forget

[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:37.380]
3000 people killed

[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:39.380]
I'm now forgotten

[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:41.620]
Let's exploit them instead

[01:42:41.620 --> 01:42:44.060]
Hey, there's oil to be gotten

[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:46.280]
Going after sentown to

[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.040]
Plankade Osama

[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:50.460]
There's no longer mention of

[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.380]
And all, I'm being complacent

[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:56.380]
Will leave an every word

[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:58.080]
Of this cartel is

[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:58.980]
Minestration

[01:42:58.980 --> 01:43:00.800]
That control this by fear

[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:02.520]
Through media manipulation

[01:43:03.380 --> 01:43:04.960]
And a right wing

[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:07.160]
Is drilling it over

[01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:08.620]
And over and over

[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:10.260]
And to our heads

[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:13.100]
And I rag pass on

[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.420]
Weapons of mass destruction

[01:43:26.980 --> 01:43:31.320]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying

[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.320]
We're all suspects now

[01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:35.300]
Not the ass drop this day

[01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:37.340]
I have nothing to hide

[01:43:37.340 --> 01:43:39.480]
Tables on her dollars' pay

[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:42.000]
And the I know being a cattle don't have

[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.680]
Any reservation

[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.220]
Sound of provoked

[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.180]
Satellites

[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:47.920]
We're the nihilation

[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.680]
Older shins must fall

[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.740]
And have a virgin and stilt

[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:53.920]
With no objection at all

[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:56.700]
Till the crap don't have the palm and the

[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:00.140]
Right wing is drilling it over

[01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:01.700]
And over and over

[01:44:01.700 --> 01:44:04.160]
And to our parade was banned

[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.160]
I rag pass on

[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.380]
Weapons of mass destruction

[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:14.160]
Only I rag pass on

[01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:17.560]
Weapons of mass destruction

[01:44:22.700 --> 01:44:24.220]
Bye bye bye

[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:25.920]
Thank you for your show

[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.760]
Unclimbing QAN

[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:29.060]
Miami for my nails

[01:44:29.060 --> 01:44:30.380]
Now it's time

[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:33.220]
To bring in the master
