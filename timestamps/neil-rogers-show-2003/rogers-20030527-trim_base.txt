[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.760]
Berliste.

[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.980]
we constrained

[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.420]
Nothing can stop it now

[00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.600]
Cause we are all scared of stars

[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.000]
Don't go to Asia

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.140]
No

[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.380]
Don't go to Hong Kong

[00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.320]
No

[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.400]
Still clear of Toronto

[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.800]
If you want to live long

[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.960]
People don't live forever

[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.080]
people must all the parts that's all

[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.080]
muriyanaki but no one wants it to happen now

[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.360]
no that's why we are scared of stars

[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.900]
people don't come together

[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.920]
people they stay apart

[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.820]
well happy Tuesday to you hope you survive the holidays

[00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.160]
hope that everybody is still alive

[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.980]
are they still alive?

[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.300]
yeah it's a relative term

[00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300]
of course in that building it's a dubious

[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.340]
especially certain people

[00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060]
anyway I just got the first page of the schedule

[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.160]
we got a little facts machine problem at QAM

[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.100]
the channel is very unusual especially after a long holiday weekend

[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.480]
so if you want a facts to us today write down this number

[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.820]
don't use the usual facts number because it's

[00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.500]
ain't gonna work for a while

[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:46.420]
305

[00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.420]
65

[00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.440]
oh

[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.080]
oh

[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.360]
181

[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.440]
6500181

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.060]
that's the bullpen

[00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.160]
the bullshmit the facts machine which is something that Marconi

[00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.360]
would probably be embarrassed to have his name associated with

[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.180]
here comes the second page of the schedule

[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.240]
and I have no idea what they're by sending me this

[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.520]
because this is gonna be absolutely in any way pretty soon the schedule

[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.180]
we got some I can't give you all the specifics

[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.500]
and I don't want to be a troublemaker

[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.920]
but somebody told me have fun have a good time with it

[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.260]
is that what you just heard somebody say?

[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.260]
I heard that

[00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.360]
now what they said

[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.080]
and got some programming changes coming to QAM

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.020]
it looks like in the fairly near future

[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.440]
in the very very I don't want to give a date

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.680]
okay I want to go on a year and start stirring up a lot of crap

[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.480]
but in the very very imminent future

[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.900]
in other words you can count the days on your hands

[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.620]
tell you're pinky

[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.040]
your toes

[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.400]
your big your big one

[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.980]
by the way speaking a big one congratulations to Amy

[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.380]
and what was his name?

[00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.800]
Aaron

[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.620]
Aaron

[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.560]
for winning our first hot couples content

[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.820]
well I shouldn't say first didn't we have one be second

[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:56.220]
and right

[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.700]
oh that's right you had one

[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.240]
like I said for winning our first hot couples contest

[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.940]
what yours was like a dry run

[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:02.560]
sure

[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.580]
a dry hump

[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.400]
oh speaking a dry run

[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.220]
don't go to Amsterdam

[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.480]
and you idiots out there

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.440]
you people at the

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.780]
I see don't ever listen to the audience

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.980]
I should learn it a long time ago

[00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.840]
don't ever ever listen to these people I call in

[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.340]
because most of the people in South Florida

[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.160]
if they get more than 10 blocks from a home

[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.320]
that's like a major adventure

[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.060]
okay

[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.860]
don't listen to these idiots out there

[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.600]
do not write this down

[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.120]
and this is going to be our poll question today

[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.320]
about places that you used to love

[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.720]
but now you hate them like poison

[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.260]
do not go to Amsterdam

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.540]
please I'm begging you

[00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.340]
unless you just want to throw away your money

[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.220]
I mean if you want to do drugs

[00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.280]
Georgia will get you hooked you up

[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.080]
no problem at all

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.700]
I mean I will

[00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.220]
yeah of course you will

[00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.480]
just throw it right in South Florida

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.440]
there's anybody that needs to leave that town

[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.300]
to go get drugs

[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.540]
needs a serious help

[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.820]
okay

[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.260]
now can you think of any other possible reason to go to Amstera

[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.280]
you kept saying good looking horse

[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.640]
well I don't I wouldn't even know it any

[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.020]
although I did take a big dump

[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.860]
and now Goldstein's toilet okay

[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.920]
I hope he's listening right now

[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.860]
up there in Pompo-no

[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.280]
don't call us we'll call you out

[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.260]
okay you're overbought

[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.760]
he's he's banned from like the human race

[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.340]
right

[00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.060]
seriously nobody can talk to him

[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.220]
because everybody's suing him

[00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.820]
and he just can't get his passport back

[00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:14.660]
can't go to Amstera

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.360]
dangerous

[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.300]
but I did take a huge dump

[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.540]
in your toilet island

[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.520]
it was a Mahaya man

[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.760]
it was the most enjoyable crap

[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.900]
I've ever taken in my life

[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.260]
that was the highlight of my trip

[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.700]
nine days it rained every goddamn day

[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.120]
I mean it's like there's a faucet in the sky

[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.400]
over England and Amsterdam

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.980]
over the low countries

[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.120]
Belgium Amsterdam

[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.820]
what's the other one

[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.280]
Luxembourg

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.580]
the Benelux countries

[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.020]
and it just keeps dripping

[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.900]
and dripping it's like

[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.820]
it's like having one of those VDs

[00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.460]
that you're always complaining about

[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.920]
it was had that discharge

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.720]
that drip that just never stops

[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.960]
like the Chinese torture treatment

[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.220]
speaking of Chinese by the way

[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.440]
no more kitty cat

[00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.300]
huh

[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.380]
I could eat in the cat

[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.100]
will you please

[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.580]
we need that pussy cat

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.080]
they're not even real cats

[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.760]
I don't care what they are man

[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.940]
they look like weasel

[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.940]
they're nasty or they are weasel

[00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.480]
in fact they were showing pictures

[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.320]
of those civic cats

[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.500]
one of them looks just like guilty

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.880]
you know

[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.220]
and probably made the same squeaking sounds

[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.660]
poor hotelie

[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.400]
isn't that going to be something

[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.060]
when we have all these interesting voices on this station soon

[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.060]
you got a lot of

[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.400]
yeah it's going to be great

[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.780]
did I just say that

[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.180]
what

[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.240]
I said we got some programming changes

[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.900]
coming up very soon at WQIM

[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900]
I'm just alerting the world to it

[00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.920]
okay I'm not going to give specifics

[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.800]
because I've been warned

[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.960]
do not get it go on a year

[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.700]
and give any specifics

[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.280]
because then they get all been out of shape

[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.180]
and then they'll say just like having an IOD

[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.840]
remember that I used to get blamed for all this crap

[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.260]
sure

[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.000]
that the Rick and Suds thing

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.940]
Rick Riley would go on

[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.880]
and you're open up a big mouth

[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.980]
and tell things that none of us were supposed to say

[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.100]
and he would talk about a day

[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.580]
after day after day

[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:45.980]
and then I would say something

[00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:46.960]
the right way they call me

[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:47.840]
and well you know

[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.720]
you're a rude and chuckmire's life

[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.880]
and he's finding out about the fact

[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.340]
he's going to get canned by your show

[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.160]
and I'm saying Rick Riley's talking about every day

[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.360]
that's going to be doing a morning show

[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.020]
you idiots

[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.240]
but I'm the one who always took the heat

[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.360]
because I'm a bad guy

[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.120]
and I'm proud of it

[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.380]
I'm pleased to be a piece of crap

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.220]
anyway Aaron and Amy won the QCouples contest

[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.460]
hot whatever the thing is

[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.900]
they're hot

[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.760]
and it was very very close

[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.700]
because they naked

[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.880]
now what? Blanche and the Eddie or whatever things

[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:13.620]
we made up right

[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.200]
yeah

[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.960]
Stanley and Sarah Goldfarb came in second

[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:18.940]
with her new de photos

[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.740]
it was very tight is what I heard

[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.260]
yeah

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.320]
like within about 20 or 30 votes

[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:25.520]
about 30

[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.240]
something like that

[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.920]
I'm not prepared for that

[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.000]
no well let's first stay back

[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.460]
oh no I'm really not

[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.040]
this is like a dry run of my own today

[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.460]
just to test the water

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:36.700]
see if I want to come back to you tomorrow

[00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.500]
also this show is going to be syndicated

[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.560]
that's another rumor we're hearing

[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.900]
is we're going to have this show syndicated

[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.360]
on about five million stations

[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.640]
we're going to have boner boys

[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.880]
going to be in charge of that project

[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.960]
now here's the poll you took on

[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.080]
what they was at Friday

[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.720]
so this poll was and I see

[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.660]
you're still milking at a movie stuff

[00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.880]
I just got on my left

[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.680]
a week and a half ago

[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.620]
and he's still milking a movie

[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.380]
just once this only once

[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.720]
yeah likely story

[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.520]
trust me

[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.220]
a thousand and thirty five votes

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.360]
of course it was a holiday weekend

[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.680]
that's a pretty lame number for poll

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.000]
it was a year for what about 10 days

[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.740]
what is the most depressing movie

[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.540]
you've ever seen

[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:18.720]
George asked

[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.780]
oh and yellow

[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.800]
209

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.780]
I never saw it with yellow

[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:23.880]
no he's as Carlos

[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.660]
what about boner boy

[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.160]
I'm sorry

[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:28.960]
I'm crying song

[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.460]
one night see

[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:31.640]
oh I hate to break the news

[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.860]
it's a little bit late now

[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.300]
to crack off the great A material

[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.040]
it's a little bit late sweetheart

[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.760]
to start being a comedian

[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.440]
yeah

[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.060]
big changes coming at QIM

[00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:43.840]
that's what I'm hearing

[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.780]
and we're looking forward to it

[00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.780]
I'm ecstatic

[00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.340]
I remember to reach down and squeeze my knee can

[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.040]
yeah

[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.980]
big changes coming

[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:54.340]
and long overdue

[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.720]
it's about time they got off the pot

[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.700]
took a more than a year

[00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:57.680]
well speaking of pot

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.560]
today's the day that they're

[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.140]
tabling that resolution

[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.360]
about the criminalizing marijuana

[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.840]
at least a Sunday degree here in Canada

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.020]
and speaking of here in Canada

[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.020]
before I get back to your

[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.880]
marginal pool

[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.200]
Jesus got it

[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.620]
first if you don't get the SARS

[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.660]
you don't get the skiers

[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:12.620]
with the West Nile virus

[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.960]
now we got the goddamn

[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.880]
mad cow disease

[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.900]
Jesus K Christ

[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.800]
you can go bowling in the streets again here

[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.700]
because they thought they

[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.120]
you know they were a little bit too cock sure

[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:22.520]
okay

[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.640]
what have I always told you

[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.960]
don't ever be too cock sure

[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.860]
and they thought that they had

[00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:28.620]
the SARS thing

[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:29.700]
licked and low and behold

[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.160]
here comes another rachidicad

[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.960]
or whatever was another

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.800]
kid kid kid kid kid

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.920]
bar and they got

[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:35.260]
a few more cases now

[00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.540]
so needless to say if there was

[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.000]
any you know usually on Memorial

[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.260]
Day since it's not a holiday

[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:41.860]
in the Canada

[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.180]
on Memorial Day a lot of Americans

[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.020]
come across the border

[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.340]
they come from Detroit and Cleveland

[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.880]
and Buffalo and wherever

[00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.320]
and they come pouring into Canada

[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.660]
it's a place to go and you know

[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.700]
do your thing on a holiday

[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.420]
you think that we're here yesterday

[00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.180]
no no

[00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:55.300]
forget about it

[00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.360]
anyway all of the

[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.120]
LR 210 Brian's song

[00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.620]
on 196

[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.240]
a real tear jerker man

[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:02.560]
Philadelphia

[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:03.340]
150

[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:04.580]
with the anxious

[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.780]
Tom Hanks

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.000]
Midnight Cowboy 86

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.860]
Requiem for a dream 74

[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.820]
it was depressing all right

[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:14.040]
I don't think as many people

[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:14.540]
saw that

[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.740]
it was outstanding

[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.600]
and the good news is

[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.100]
George watched the happiness

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.140]
yes I did

[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.780]
when you see it last night

[00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.240]
you're right

[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.600]
and I was right

[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.240]
you were right

[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.760]
it was great except I didn't want it to end

[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:26.780]
that was what pissed me off

[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.820]
about the ending of it

[00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.660]
like we need

[00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:29.620]
any clothes run

[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:30.600]
so many things there

[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:31.560]
closure

[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.040]
yeah

[00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.880]
that's what she told the dog

[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:34.840]
to close your mouth

[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.300]
haha

[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:37.940]
terms of endearment

[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:38.500]
68

[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.880]
Sophie's choice 59

[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.420]
and the band played on 56

[00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:43.040]
what about the boys in the band

[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.800]
that was depressing

[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.520]
right

[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.600]
that's a fag movie

[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.220]
no what called it

[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:47.600]
and an old one too

[00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.720]
be no

[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.660]
seriously that was a

[00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.180]
that was a suicide-inducing movie

[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.900]
boys in the band

[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.880]
that was really morbid

[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.460]
and depressing

[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.640]
uh...

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.200]

my life 23

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.500]
what's my life

[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.700]
that's the one with uh...

[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:01.920]

that he taped himself

[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:04.380]
because he's dying

[00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:05.460]
because he's dying of cancer

[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.760]
for his son

[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:07.560]

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:19.920]
when there's nothing but

[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:20.640]
Dutch people there

[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.400]

[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:25.820]
it a great place

[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.080]
it was like a melting pod

[00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:27.520]
from people

[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.000]
especially from all over

[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.160]
Europe and the rest of the

[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:30.960]
world too but like all

in fact it's may already

[00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:06.160]

that part of the 2003

[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.540]
where it's like they're

[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:14.500]
closer to the beginning then

The undercover brother is back in uniform on the Eddie Griffith Show.

[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.380]
Yo yo yo, what's up, baby?

[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.180]
What the hell are you doing?

[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.920]
I'm at B.

[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.900]
That's good, because Eddie Lackas saw it and was joking to talk.

[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.320]
Yeah.

[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.240]
Mayberry will never be the same now that Eddie Griffith's in town.

[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.900]
God, my man, isn't I need me a throw, bro?

[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.380]
Give it brother a big ol' blow.

[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.280]
You ready?

[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:36.280]
You want me to put a little relax in there?

[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.640]
Maybe, maybe, little Jerry Carroll, bro.

[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.220]
Listen up, listen up.

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.760]
Don't be making me look like no ass shotin'

[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.840]
because I threw your ass in there and ate the oldies in the dry.

[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.120]
The Eddie Griffith Show tonight on Nick at night,

[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.820]
right after my three homeboys.

[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.240]
I think I'm dialing down 565-560, baby.

[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.620]
I need to see this 560-WDFM.

[00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.720]
I'll tell you what we ought to do today.

[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.180]
Don't have a prize to give away,

[00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.500]
but it's kind of like a sidebar to what we're going to do with this pool

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.960]
and the rest of whatever the hell we do today.

[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:06.640]
We got prizes.

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.780]
No, no, seriously, we ought to have people call it

[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.720]
and they guess what the programming changes are that are coming on QAM.

[00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.620]
I think, huh?

[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.020]
Yeah.

[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:17.500]
Don't you think that's a good idea?

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.400]
And if they get it exactly right,

[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.060]
then maybe we'll think about giving them a prize.

[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:22.480]
Or not.

[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.520]
Look, if you get a prize,

[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.440]
just don't forget our next hot couple's contest.

[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.460]
It starts right now.

[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:27.880]
Why not?

[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.400]
Right.

[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.180]
And you can email us a picture at neo-rogers.com of yourselves.

[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.180]

[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:34.500]
Okay.

[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.720]
We don't want to have to do like we did with Aaron and Amy.

[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.340]
That worked out just fine.

[00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:40.860]
It did work out just fine.

[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.140]
Hey, Aaron, how's it hanging, sweetheart?

[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:45.880]
At any rate, you have to till June 15th.

[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.100]
So we're getting like a head start on this.

[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.260]
Okay, getting a little head start.

[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.760]
Thursday, May 15th, pictures will be posted on our website.

[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.480]
And then the voters can vote for a whole week.

[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:58.740]
And then on June 22nd, a couple of the most votes wins first prize.

[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.460]
Now, grand prize will be the same.

[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.560]
Three days to the United States for two of the Royal Oasis resort in Cassino and in Bahamas

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:05.000]
with round trip airfare and liquor air.

[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:14.480]
But second prize we changed, which was the hedonism trip to hedonism.

[00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.260]
Yeah.

[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.300]
And the grilled Jamaica.

[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:18.960]
It was everything.

[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.260]
What was the name of that place?

[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.240]
Yeah, I'm careful.

[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:22.800]
Negro Jamaica.

[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:24.360]
Negro.

[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.280]
I say.

[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.860]
You say, two day stay for a hedonism, two or three in Jamaica, all inclusive transfers food,

[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.580]
drinks, gratuitous, but no airfare.

[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:31.860]
Oh.

[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.420]
And third prize is dinner for two of the pizza loves.

[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.660]
So Jeff Cohen slud down, slud down one notch on the elater.

[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.160]
But that's okay.

[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.780]
I'm sure we don't know yet if we're going to have that second prize again.

[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.880]
Oh, we're checking on it.

[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.940]
Well, let's you know.

[00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.620]
We'll give you whatever it is.

[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.300]
I don't know how we feel like it.

[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:49.660]
Okay, but at least you'll be famous.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.840]
And if you don't want us to use your real names, by the way, let us know up front.

[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:54.960]
No, no, seriously, that would be nice.

[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.020]
We don't want to have to put Sarah Gullfarberne, Max Gullfian on there, to try to cover up your identity,

[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.480]
because somebody you know, I recognize you.

[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.140]
It's like the people with the cute couple, what's their name, Chris and what's your name?

[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.140]
I don't know.

[00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.460]
Molly.

[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:08.340]
Yeah, you do.

[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.980]
I remember.

[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.260]

[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:15.080]
And at any rate, I mean, everybody that knows them is, knows they got that thing.

[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:15.720]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.080]
Right.

[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:22.520]
I mean, would you want mommy, especially your mommy, for example, to watch you chasing your wife around,

[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.580]
trying to grab a hold of it, long enough to do something with it?

[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:26.200]
You think my mommy knows what a computer is?

[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.020]
Oh, well, I'm guaranteeing Chris and what's your name's mommy and daddy?

[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.240]
They're probably a little hippy and younger on the age of 100 today.

[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:34.680]
Anyway, here's our poll question today.

[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:40.640]
What place did you visit or live in that you once loved, but now dislike the most?

[00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.560]
I think that's worded fairly well.

[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:43.940]
Right.

[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:50.120]
In other words, a place that used to go to maybe once or maybe a whole used to go there all the time,

[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.340]
or maybe you lived there and you loved it.

[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.780]
You just were in Chandlerwood and now you despise it a lot.

[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.480]
And I have a short list so far.

[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.340]
Amsterdam, that would be my vote.

[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.500]
I make no bones about it.

[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.360]
Bone, bone, bone, no bones about it.

[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.300]
Dispise it.

[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:11.040]
It's just gotten schmutzier and danker and nastier and they got bad unemployment there

[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.060]
and the people are walking around like shleppers because most of them are.

[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.980]
I'll tell you if you want to see a lot of guys that look like Elystice Grant.

[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:20.860]
Be here and what not?

[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.620]
And you will give in and rip and winkle with that little corn cob.

[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.400]
You see, you're laughing.

[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:29.180]
It's like a throwback.

[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.740]
It's like the world stood still and went back 100 years.

[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:33.720]
Seriously.

[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.860]
And we got on the train and went to Cologne, Germany for one day for a few hours.

[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.320]
And it's not really that far away.

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.760]
I don't know, a couple hundred miles.

[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.760]
And that's such a beautiful city.

[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:48.300]
The people there are just incredibly great looking and well dressed and it's an upscale city.

[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.500]
All these beautiful shops.

[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.000]
And even a train station in Cologne, I put it this before, you could spend a whole day there.

[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:59.560]
You could have a between all the great food they've got there in the beautiful toilets.

[00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:03.400]
You see now your laugh and there's a rule.

[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.620]
What the hell do they call that room?

[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:10.960]
It's got two like sunny faces on it and it's called, I don't know, I don't know the sit in room.

[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.460]
The clap, the clap mice there.

[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.180]
I don't know what it's called.

[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.140]
But anyway, you go in here and it cost you a euro coin.

[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:18.080]
I think it's like 60 cents to take a leak.

[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.600]
And it's 1.6 euros.

[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.400]
Oh, and by the way, speaking of that American dollar, it's a good thing we got out of there.

[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.280]
I'd be broke already.

[00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:29.000]
Do you realize the euro is up to over 118 now against the dollar?

[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.420]
Yeah.

[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.100]
And even here in Canada, it's like 73 cents.

[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.700]
Man, what is happening with an American dollar, an American economy, boys and girls?

[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:38.700]
It's in the crapper.

[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.680]
But anyway, they have this beautiful crapp place in the right in the train station.

[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:49.680]
And for a buck 60 or 1.6 euros, you go in and you can take a crap.

[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.240]
And I mean, just all this great linens and stuff to wash and it's great.

[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.100]
So, Kallon is great.

[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.480]
Go there if you want to go someplace, but do not go to Amsterdam.

[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.680]
It's depressing and dank and gross and filthy and disgusting.

[00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.980]
And there's nothing there but Dutch people who look like a relic out of the dark ages.

[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.600]
You see, you think I'm exaggerating?

[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.920]
I should have taken a bunch of pictures of the locals there.

[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:12.700]
Yeah, you should have if only you had a little camera.

[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:17.720]
They got these big beers and big old puppets and just...

[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.180]
I just never seen a place where people looked like that.

[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.420]
Anyway, Amsterdam, New York, certainly gets some votes on that,

[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.200]
because we got a lot of disenchanted, disenfranchised New Yorkers in South Florida.

[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.140]
And Vegas, that's got to be one.

[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:34.460]
What do you think?

[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:34.920]
Sure.

[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.400]
So, there's the start.

[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.140]
There's the list of three places for you.

[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:39.180]
What place did you want...

[00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.340]
Did you use the visitor or live in that you once loved,

[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.240]
but now dislike the most?

[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.480]
Amsterdam, New York, Vegas, and then we'll have you call some in.

[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.360]
Anybody got the new lineup on QAM yet?

[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.080]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.560]
And of course, when I say the new lineup, this is all speculation.

[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.780]
You don't understand the ocean.

[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:57.060]
Of course.

[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.560]
Do we have to preface this by saying, well, there's just a lot of rumors floating around.

[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.780]
We're just going to have a good time with it.

[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.380]
Don't get any to say that to cover everybody's ass.

[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.140]
Here's our first call of a brand new week.

[00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:09.800]
Here's Miami.

[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.160]
Hello.

[00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:11.120]
Hey, Neil.

[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:11.600]
Welcome back.

[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.080]
Hey, George.

[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.000]
Good to show you for the Carlos.

[00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:16.940]
And, Neil, does that guy...

[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.420]
Does that guy...

[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:17.420]

[00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:18.820]
comes on with George when the Rick and Shudder said,

[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:19.560]
does he know sports?

[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:20.880]
Because he must have forgot for a rub and get together.

[00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:21.560]
That'd be pretty cool.

[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:22.960]
What, what guy's that?

[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:24.140]
The Rick.

[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.240]
Sorry, can you tell him how it's said?

[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.040]
Oh, suds, he knows nothing about sports.

[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.260]
He just likes sports almost as much as George.

[00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.840]
Now, fortunately, I don't have a vote for your poll.

[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.700]
But if I had the two of any players, I'd say, my goddamn grandma didn't have a spot.

[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.280]
I hate it.

[00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:37.720]
Okay.

[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:38.960]
Have a great new year, grandma.

[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:39.540]
Thank you.

[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.420]
He says, I'm well as sucks.

[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.680]
On the AT&T and Verizon, wireless line.

[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.820]
So, George saw happiness last night.

[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:51.500]
That's a good step.

[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.660]
We're making some progress now.

[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:56.520]
I should tell that bed story, but I better not.

[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.560]
Well, it wasn't their fault.

[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.200]
I better not.

[00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:02.300]
They'll be distressed.

[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:03.240]
I'd or not.

[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.280]
Thanks very much to my friends and dial amateurs for trying to do something very nice for me.

[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.660]
It's for trying very hard on their end.

[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:11.860]
That's all I'm going to say.

[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.740]
And fat boys, stay out of my life.

[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.780]
Okay, you tub of crab.

[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.640]
Is he still in the hospital?

[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:17.520]
No, he's at home convalusing.

[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.680]
Oh, is he really?

[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.060]
Yes.

[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.780]
Probably in the crispy creams to it at the time, one of each hand.

[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.880]
You disgusting tub of crab.

[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:26.220]
You stay out of my life, fat boy.

[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:26.520]
Okay.

[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.520]
Quit complicating my life.

[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:34.000]
Quit trying to be a Mr. Run, everybody else has got them furious for them.

[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.420]
Take care of your own fat affairs.

[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.480]
You disgusting, dying tub of crab.

[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.320]
Jesus Christ.

[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.060]
Come on, stop me.

[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.140]
I know you're down there.

[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.440]
926 at 560 W.

[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.660]
We got a big week.

[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:46.700]
And this audio, you notice?

[00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:49.540]
I mean, I realize it's day after Memorial Day holiday.

[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.460]
But we have a pressure pack week coming on this radio station.

[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:58.500]
And when the Schmidt hits the fan, it's going to be some heavy action at Jackson.

[00:23:58.700 --> 00:23:59.120]
You know what I mean?

[00:23:59.500 --> 00:23:59.680]
Yeah.

[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.460]
I think even Bonobo is going to idea what's going on.

[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:04.120]
927.

[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:04.780]
What?

[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.720]
927 at 560 WQ.

[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.020]
And boy, sure it's great to be back.

[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:13.560]
You know, no, it is great to be back in Toronto anyway.

[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.580]
It's supposed to be in Amsterdam.

[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:19.220]
It would be great to be in the Batavia as compared to Amsterdam.

[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:20.700]
It's horrible.

[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.940]
I'm not exaggerating.

[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:23.800]
I have nothing to gain with you.

[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:24.360]
Go there or not.

[00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:24.920]
It's your money.

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.800]
But I'm just telling you, a little piece of advice from the old Fag

[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.460]
do not waste your time going to a place that used to be.

[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.060]
There are a lot of places that used to be great.

[00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.680]
Think of different places where they used to live that are now slums.

[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.980]
You know, whether they had the changing neighborhood, that kind of thing.

[00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.920]
You don't want to go back there.

[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.680]
I have been telling you for a long time about something that's really good for you.

[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.700]
It's called Oliomet.

[00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:50.520]
In fact, I'm popping it myself right here in Toronto.

[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.200]
I've got a whole bunch.

[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.360]
And thank you also guys.

[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:56.080]
See, I had a little bit better success with the Oliomet getting here than the bed story.

[00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.420]
Oliomet soft gels contain the best olive oil on the planet.

[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.300]
Not just ordinary olive oil, but super concentrated little with all kinds of good stuff for you.

[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:07.360]
And popping Oliomet in your pussy every day can help reduce the risk of heart disease, high cholesterol.

[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.820]
And now there are 14 different Oliomet formulas from which to choose.

[00:25:10.820 --> 00:25:19.780]
Each one, combining the finest olive oil and money can buy with vitamins, minerals, herbals to support different parts of your health from your bones, to your blood pressure, to your immune system.

[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.920]
Just choose the formulas that are right for you.

[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.680]
And now they've got three brand new Oliomet formulas.

[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.540]
One to help you sleep.

[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.680]
One to help you control that disgusting weight.

[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.080]
And sell Q10 for your heart.

[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.000]

[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.040]
We are supporting O5 City, UAM.

[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:08.920]
And now here's comical Oli, the former I Racky Minister of Information, with today's health update.

[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.520]
Sexually transmitted or crawling around things, you know.

[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.320]
And I looked down on my left handers like this little red postule.

[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.740]
Now this isn't the first time in my life.

[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:21.000]
It's maybe like the second or third time of her handers.

[00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.100]
See, you're shaving too close.

[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:23.120]
Yeah.

[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.380]
But at any rate, and I looked down here, and it really from a distance, you know, without my glasses,

[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.880]
I don't usually wear the glasses in the shower, although it probably would help me see it better.

[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.300]
But there's this red postule man.

[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.940]
And then I realized it was like from an ingrown here, you know, like a little red lump.

[00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:43.880]
And today it's almost gone.

[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.840]
Was your least it was something that like dwell on, you know, when you get to a certain age,

[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.260]
you want to have stuff that you dwell on.

[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.020]
Well, well, that got a lot longer, do we?

[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.320]
Huh?

[00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:52.580]
I said, how's it going?

[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:59.580]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Mount.

[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.860]
Anybody in the audience ever have like a ingrown here and they're nut?

[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.720]
How about the women out there in the audience?

[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.260]
I meant that's something that Mufford likes to find out about, don't you think?

[00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:11.980]
I'll go out.

[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.260]
Maybe he'd like to find out if Bonerboy has an ingrown something.

[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:18.940]
Here's Miami.

[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:19.340]
Hello.

[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.060]
Uncle Neil.

[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:20.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.740]
Welcome back, sir.

[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:22.980]
Thank you so much.

[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:26.800]
I want to weigh in on two of your polls, the other way away.

[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:33.040]
The unofficial one, I think it's they want to put for now on the morning show to put it up a little.

[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:35.200]
No, that's not right.

[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.660]
That's what I mean.

[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.020]
You're in the ball.

[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.180]
Let me say that you're in the ballpark.

[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:41.840]
Oh, very good, sir.

[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.440]
In addition to which, since I can't really say for a certain idea what it is,

[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.560]
if somebody gets it right, there might just be a long silence.

[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:49.880]
You know what you want to say?

[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.120]
I hope they keep trying.

[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:55.300]
And as far as we're the poll, I've got to weigh in on my very hometown.

[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.440]
Miami, Florida.

[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.740]
Okay.

[00:27:58.700 --> 00:27:59.740]
You once loved it.

[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.760]
And now you hate it like poison.

[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.060]
And I'm still living here.

[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.440]
Well, good luck, Kee Amigo.

[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.140]
Thank you, sir.

[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.140]
Okay, I see you.

[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:11.340]
He was, he was like, Teppet, I would say, was Luke Warmer.

[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.520]
Where are you going tonight?

[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:14.740]
935, 560.

[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.320]
See, you know something about Ferrell.

[00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.980]
I got to be very honest with it because when he first came to the station,

[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.120]
when we first got the word, when the memo came down,

[00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.680]
when it was in the newspaper and Barry Jack has his comments,

[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:28.680]
this is the way we announce everything I've QAM because Barry and Greg got something going.

[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.220]
They're really tight.

[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.320]
In fact, maybe Barry and Greg would like pull out each other's ingrown testicles.

[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:59.560]
But I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.560]

[00:28:59.560 --> 00:28:59.680]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.000]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.020]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.820]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.300]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:19.980]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.160]

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.160]

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.160]

[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.260]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:20.260]

[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:20.260]

[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:20.760]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.020]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.000]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:23.780]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.120]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:29.340]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:35.280]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:29:49.160 --> 00:30:04.960]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:05.160]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.160]

[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:05.260]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.260]

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.260]

[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:05.260]

[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:19.960]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.960]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:23.960]

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:23.960]

[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.260]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:24.440]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.440]

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:24.440]

[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:25.760]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.960]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.900]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:30.980]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:32.440]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.240]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:44.220]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.060]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:47.060]

[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:48.300]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.200]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:49.220]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:51.020]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.100]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:04.140]
I think that's the way we're going to do it.

[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.420]
Of course, there are some people a little bit scared to go outside.

[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:12.620]
Where are we?

[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:13.180]
Detroit.

[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.760]
With that crap team that they've got, 17,600 in some odd.

[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.100]
Yankees and Red Sox, 55,000.

[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.580]
Got it.

[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.340]
Graves and the Reds.

[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.560]
I'd probably shouldn't go through all of these because it's terminal.

[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.520]
33,000 in some odd.

[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.940]
Colorado hosting the Giants, 28,000.

[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.120]
Cubs hosting the Parade.

[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:35.000]
The Parade is getting blasted.

[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.640]
40,000 at Wrigley Field.

[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.120]
Cardinals in the Astros, 35,600.

[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.200]
Diamond Vax into Padres, 32,000.

[00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.600]
And the Marlins in the Spose, 8362,

[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.840]
announced it means there were maybe 5,000 people there.

[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.600]
You ready for that?

[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:53.960]
And they're talking baseball.

[00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:55.800]
They're talking baseball.

[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.280]
Nobody cares about baseball.

[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.120]
They don't you understand?

[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.760]
Talk about neurotic repetition, man.

[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:03.000]
It gets in no material.

[00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:05.260]
567-0560.

[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.600]
See, I remember that last nut.

[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.160]
Did you do the shows when I was going to do it in that for all voice?

[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:10.500]
I hope.

[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:13.700]
I did one on an entire segment that way, and that was all I could do.

[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.440]
What?

[00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:16.420]
I suffered for the rest of the week because of it.

[00:32:16.580 --> 00:32:17.880]
Come on, let me see the news.

[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.220]
21.

[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.880]
Oh, he's an air and definitely an acquired taste.

[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.700]
You have to get used to it and figure out what he's all about.

[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.000]
Because my clearance first asked me what I thought.

[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:31.980]
I said, oh my god, this is the worst crap I've ever heard in my life.

[00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.540]
Who's going to listen to a voice like that?

[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:33.860]
Me.

[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:35.180]
And me too.

[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.400]
There's no chance you'll ever take himself seriously, which is great.

[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:38.760]

[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.120]
Well, thank god for that.

[00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.020]
You know, right there alone is a step in a right direction

[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:44.720]
if all these rumors that we're hearing pan out.

[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.020]
You know?

[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.880]
If all these rumors come true, what a tremendous improvement that'll be

[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.700]
over what we've experienced for the last 14, 15 months.

[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.360]
Talking about certain people.

[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:55.940]
Not that we want to get into personalities.

[00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:56.880]
You do understand that.

[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.700]
But we people that take themselves a little bit too seriously

[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.160]
and they're hair piece as well.

[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:03.400]
I'm a little.

[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.860]
This is 20 or 5-6.

[00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:07.360]
You way up.

[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.180]
Damn, they're killing them.

[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.860]
Hey, Koishi, my insurance from work is okay, but I know

[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.920]
thinking it's booty now.

[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.160]
Oh, you're so right.

[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.320]
Too bad they're not company that offer sub-romeda issues.

[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.260]
You say something Koishi?

[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.100]
Hey, I say, so sorry.

[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.600]
No company have coverage.

[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:29.780]
Pick up where other coverage revolve.

[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.480]
Ah, correct.

[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.280]
Who talking?

[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:34.280]
I am.

[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.600]
I say too bad.

[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.160]
You insurance a no go far enough.

[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.700]
If only there was another way.

[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.240]
Ah, correct.

[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:47.020]
So sorry I know here you because stupid duck keep ringing

[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:49.340]
dog and interrupt insurance conversation.

[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.420]
Ah, correct.

[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.420]
Wait, this commercial is a stupid.

[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:57.980]
Or a must at stupid as a commercial with Yogi Vera.

[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.980]
Ah, correct.

[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.700]
It's a night.

[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.620]
I just want to make sure the afferag duck was done.

[00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.500]
A kinder gentler afferag duck.

[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.140]
944-560 W.

[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:12.520]
Here's a fact which stood the miracle of modern technology.

[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.640]
Actually, we're able to get a facts through here.

[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.800]
Only required four people to get that.

[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.080]
Oh, and I should just mention this in case fix it might be

[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:48.080]
a little bit of technical involvement in this radio show.

[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.900]
Instead of the usual horse ball half-ass George Corso

[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.060]
can be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:21.800]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:37.600]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:51.060]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.980]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:50.700]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:36:50.700 --> 00:37:02.820]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:32.800]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[00:37:35.260 --> 00:38:02.780]
a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a

[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:32.240]
little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of A little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more.

[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.500]
Norma can't.

[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.860]
Inorma, by the way, I'm getting the show syndicated without your help, you idiot.

[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:40.220]
You're simple, and you useless piece of dreck.

[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:42.740]
Lots of exciting things.

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.220]
And by the way, this thing that we're talking about, that we can't talk about on the

[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.640]
ears as far as the all these schedule changes, this thing we're not talking about, the thing

[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.680]
we're not talking about.

[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.680]
I wonder if he's even aware of this.

[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.700]
Don't call me by the way, Norma.

[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.440]
I won't call you.

[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.480]
And then you know, don't call me.

[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:58.360]
It'll work out just great.

[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.040]
And even though I just got back on Sunday, do you realize how pleasant life is?

[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:05.920]
Now that my phone isn't ringing off the hook, certain people that aren't bugging the hell

[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.420]
out of me anymore.

[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.200]
Oh, God.

[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.760]
Life is like almost paradise.

[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:17.160]
56670560, pound 560, on the 18 and T in Verizon, wireless line, a big wicked QAM.

[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:21.960]
I see even old, funny, daddy Jim Sarny had a liner to and ever about the Scott Porell.

[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.740]
Yeah, he's feeling it.

[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.460]
He's feeling mighty low, Jim Sarny.

[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.400]
He's still can't find nothing.

[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.940]
Maybe he's got an ingrown hair in his left testicle.

[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.580]
Here's a call from Tamarack.

[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:35.860]
Hello?

[00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:37.020]
Neil?

[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:37.880]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:40.280]
It's terrific hearing you live on the radio.

[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:41.520]
Let me tell you that much.

[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.240]
Okay.

[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.480]
God love you.

[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:50.560]
Or Neil God about the vacation spots that it turns out that they have cottage cheese

[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.200]
pies and they blow chunks.

[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.680]
I might have to go for ask when Colorado.

[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.360]
Okay.

[00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.920]
That's been in the tank on your programming change.

[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.220]
It's Scott Porell and Carlos.

[00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.640]
I think replacing the dirty voice since you already eliminated.

[00:40:06.100 --> 00:40:12.660]
Since you already eliminated the possibility of them being in the morning because you discounted

[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:13.200]
that somebody.

[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.600]
That would have been my first gift.

[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.340]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.020]
Now the guy said, keep in mind what he said.

[00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:19.980]
He said he's replacing Mo on the morning show or something.

[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:20.900]
What did the guy say?

[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:21.520]
He's not.

[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.300]
They were adding him to that show, which is not correct.

[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:32.720]
But anyway, so that guy is such a, in terms of demographics, the guy is a billionaire.

[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:41.520]
The guy is huge because your older listeners have either a son or a nephew that's in that

[00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:46.660]
exact time frame in terms of when they came around the planet.

[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.300]
That's the best guess, man.

[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:50.180]
I'll speak to you later.

[00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:51.780]
It's really great having you back.

[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:52.940]
Neil, I love you.

[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:53.580]
Okay.

[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.380]
Thanks a lot, Pally.

[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:57.080]
That was great.

[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.460]
10 before 10 at 5.60 W. Come on.

[00:40:59.460 --> 00:40:59.780]
We got now.

[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.040]
Let's see.

[00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:04.320]
The schedule says today Jim Mendesch at one o'clock.

[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:04.820]
Oh, right.

[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:05.740]
No change there yet.

[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.440]
Tank Goldberg at three from Shula's.

[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:09.260]
No change there yet.

[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:10.380]
Yet.

[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.580]
Uh, Marlon's on Dec. 6.30.

[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:16.560]
We wish we could change that, bringing like a real exciting team in a time of.

[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.460]
But somebody cared about it like maybe the braves, although they don't care that much

[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:19.680]
either.

[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.220]
Got a bunch of phony fans there in Atlanta, man.

[00:41:22.300 --> 00:41:22.600]
They suck.

[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.480]
Although you noticed the next lowest attendance, there wasn't any other attendance in single

[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.860]
digits when I read those box scores.

[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.160]
The next lowest I think was Detroit with 17,000.

[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:34.580]
Of course, the Tigers have won about four games in two years now.

[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:35.720]
So why would anybody go there?

[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.720]
Plus it's in Detroit.

[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.060]
Marlon's in the expose.

[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:43.540]
Let's see if we can't do a little better than the 8300 from yesterday on a holiday.

[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.280]
Gee, that's embarrassing.

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:47.700]
Even George is humiliated by that.

[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:48.000]
Yeah.

[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.900]
If he would have realized it would have been so bad, he'd have probably taken a family

[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.880]
out there and gone and bought a couple of tickets, huh?

[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:55.020]
Yeah, of course I would.

[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.040]
Just to put a couple of asses in the seats.

[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:03.500]
The expose and the expose and the expose in Marlon's at 705, any K at 10 o'clock, enjoy

[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.140]
Mark overnight, two to six for now is what it says here.

[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:11.340]
I mean, why do they waste the paper sitting in the schedule when they know that any moment

[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:14.120]
now we may have some major changes coming on.

[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:14.620]
You understand?

[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:17.120]
Have some big exciting stuff going on at station.

[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:17.960]
It's about time.

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.300]
You're right, Jim Sarni.

[00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:22.040]
It's about, and in the coast of short, if you're right enough crap, sooner or later,

[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.300]
so it'll come back and hit the ground.

[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.860]
Too bad Jim Sarni writes all that stuff about radio and Tom Jicken will write anything

[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.320]
about it.

[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.040]
He's still too busy writing about how ABC's new fall shows suck and it's the end of May.

[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.180]
Here's a call from Boca.

[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:35.460]
Hello.

[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.080]
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:37.520]
OK.

[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:42.860]
First of all, I just turned 63 yesterday, 526.

[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.380]
I'd like to get a jingle by May 526.

[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.640]
Happy birthday, pal.

[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:55.080]
OK, and on your poll, I think Carlos is taking over George's spot.

[00:42:55.420 --> 00:43:00.260]
I think he's proven himself that he's the better, better still listen to.

[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:02.280]
George is pretty much on its way out.

[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.500]
So I have a chance.

[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.580]
The way I'd like to go, I could use the house the way soon.

[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.840]
And I'd like to recruit George.

[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.040]
Would you?

[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:13.920]
If that would be possible.

[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.340]
OK, I think your freaky Carl will speak you to it.

[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.580]
Maybe it was Reverend Jones doing a voice doing every day last week.

[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:21.320]
Did he really?

[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:21.540]
Yeah.

[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.480]
Well, at least he's down there for several times a day.

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.280]
He's out there.

[00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:28.980]
Maybe he would like to recruit you.

[00:43:29.060 --> 00:43:29.960]
Maybe that's what it's all about.

[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:30.380]
I'm sure.

[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:32.960]
Maybe he'd like to put you into his flock.

[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:33.560]
No doubt.

[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.000]
5667, 0560.

[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.940]
So there's the guest that the bonerboy is taking over George's spot.

[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.180]
Of course, we already know that's true.

[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.340]
Anyway, that's imminent any day.

[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.740]
OK, can I hold on to poll now?

[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.620]
Poll is up.

[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:49.640]
We got a short list because we're not getting the kind of response that we should be.

[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.300]
That's because we got this other stuff like throwing us off a little bit.

[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.860]
Well, there is some of the highlights from yesterday's Marlon game.

[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.840]
25-day road trip.

[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:58.640]
They lost a vote.

[00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.180]
Oh, boy.

[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.200]
As they kicked the show, the esposas.

[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.140]
But there was nobody there.

[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.040]
And really when they showed on there, they showed the wide screen in the embarrassing Detroit

[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:08.420]
3.

[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:11.620]
See, I told you, what place did you visit or live in that you once loved?

[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:17.920]
But now dislike the most Detroit 3, Amsterdam 2, New York 2, Vegas 1 and Cancun 1,

[00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:18.620]
only 9 votes.

[00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:20.760]
But it just topped up our poll.

[00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:21.480]
So you can hop on it.

[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.380]
And don't forget to email us those pictures for the June contest to have a couple

[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:25.700]
of contest.

[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:30.280]
Now, what did we decide that people had lost before they can continue entering?

[00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:31.060]
Correct.

[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.720]
But not if they won like second or third prize.

[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.900]
No, right, right.

[00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.040]
That would be unfair.

[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:39.640]
Yes.

[00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.840]
So anybody that entered before, I mean, let's face it, if you entered and you got like

[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.420]
three votes and you look like crap, I mean, unless you want to humiliate and degrade

[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.520]
yourself again, I mean, you're entitled to do it.

[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.320]
But why would you want to go through that again?

[00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.820]
I'd be embarrassed and humiliated and get like two votes out of the line.

[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:58.020]
So in other words, if each of the top two had over 700 votes, we must have got quite

[00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.100]
a few votes, right?

[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.020]
Right?

[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:00.920]
By the way, something.

[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.760]
Yeah, the facts machine seems to be working.

[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:04.760]
Oh, all right.

[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:07.780]
Okay, let's go back to the old facts number 305 650198.

[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.540]
All right.

[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.440]
650, leave it to that fix it, baby.

[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:13.800]
He's the best.

[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:18.400]
He got out his big one and he stuck it right in the phone line there and twisted it

[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:18.680]
out.

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.600]
Got all the crap out of there.

[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:22.460]
Nice going, Fixie.

[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.280]
Nice having you with us.

[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.020]
Okay, you, how long has he been hanging around there?

[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.900]
I saw him last week for the first time because he was there a member about a year ago.

[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:31.160]

[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.940]
Jim Yelton is his real name, I should mention that.

[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:40.900]
Jim Yeltsin, our Russian invader engineer guy, brings back the memories of WIOD back in

[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:42.920]
the days when we're at our real radio station.

[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:43.980]
WIOD.

[00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:45.180]
Oh, I hate that station.

[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:49.680]
And now look at how the tables are turning especially in the coming days of QAM.

[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:52.640]
It's going to be a major explosion in your radio.

[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:57.280]
Oh, somebody coming in like Jimmy C's tonight for those Latin lovers down there, buddy,

[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:57.880]
old porch.

[00:45:58.240 --> 00:45:58.700]
Come on.

[00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:03.820]
You know, the best part of him is I have no idea what he's talking about.

[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:05.020]
No, I don't think he does.

[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.060]
And he hasn't either, which is kind of like this show a lot of the time.

[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.620]
The more you coherent you are, the better the audience likes it.

[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.780]
567, 0560, pound, now, now, what's your name, Fixit?

[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.320]
Now that you got that taken care of, now start thinking about that line 5, okay?

[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:24.940]
Let's start communicating with him directly as opposed to try to go through Corso and Bob

[00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:27.720]
Vermuth and all these other half-assed horseball make-believe engineers.

[00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.000]
Let's start using Fixit as our new Hulio.

[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.320]
Have the game a little bit of weight, but nevertheless.

[00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.020]
Here's a call from Miami.

[00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:36.380]
Hello.

[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.160]
Hey, Neil.

[00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:37.660]
Welcome back.

[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:38.400]
Thank you.

[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:44.940]
Good stuff on the air after you left, but I want to weigh in on the lineup.

[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:46.020]
So not the refrigerator.

[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:46.620]
Good job.

[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:47.840]
Yeah.

[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.260]
He's still sucks, but I, you know, it's getting better.

[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:50.900]
Okay.

[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.880]
What do you call?

[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.640]
Gellies out.

[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.480]
Yeah.

[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:00.220]
Moe moves to the afternoon lineup.

[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:01.520]
Moe moves to sunrise.

[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:02.260]
Correct.

[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:05.420]
And gets moved in front.

[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.560]
Morning, morning drive.

[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.180]
Partially, you're getting warm.

[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:11.860]
Look warm.

[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:15.340]
Well, I heard the pause, so for yourself.

[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.040]
It was kind of like a half-and-pause.

[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:17.460]
Okay.

[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.300]
Let's see what we got on list so far.

[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:23.400]
How's it coming?

[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.480]
Because this pull, I don't know.

[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:27.480]
I thought it was a good pull question to myself and mainly because of my bitterness about

[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.380]
the Amsterdam experience, wasting all of that money.

[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.040]
And it was like, it's flustered down the turlid.

[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:35.780]
I could have got a Vegas lost every dime and at least had a good time doing it, you know?

[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.960]
Because Vegas is still fun.

[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:42.220]
But it would be like if you went to Vegas and you took all the tourists away and it was

[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:44.480]
just the local Nevada people there.

[00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.340]
You'd hate it.

[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.780]
Although, although like I told you before, the show this morning, at least Vegas has

[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:52.380]
still got the casinos and the gambling and the shows and the excitement.

[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:56.740]
But if you only had the local people there and believe you, me, the local, I don't want

[00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.200]
to insult anybody who might be listening in Vegas on the internet or who lived there.

[00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.640]
But let's face it, and it's still a cowboy town.

[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.080]
It's a bunch of Yahoo's, man.

[00:48:05.580 --> 00:48:07.160]
It makes Tampa look like Manhattan.

[00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:10.040]
That's how backwoods Vegas is.

[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:13.660]
So if you took all the tourists away and that's the same thing now with Amsterdam, all

[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:18.680]
the town you have is those nasty, miserable, grotesque, smelly, Dutch people.

[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.000]
But they do have great soap and deodorant.

[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.140]
I brought back some of my fire.

[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:28.580]
And because we do have so many Middle Eastern people here in Toronto, I brought back some

[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.400]
of the fell also.

[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.220]
Where are the exploding balls?

[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.260]
I'm feeling so lonely.

[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.720]
I'm so lonely I could die.

[00:48:46.980 --> 00:48:53.860]
You know, I'm hurt so bad.

[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.980]
A love of boy has gone.

[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.180]
Pat kissed on the truck.

[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:11.160]
Took his rubber dumps and his webster sized dumps.

[00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:13.780]
A love of boy has gone.

[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:17.540]
No more time to play.

[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.420]
I told them I'm not gay.

[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.740]
But police took him away.

[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:35.560]
Every day I sit and ask myself, what can I do wrong?

[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.160]
What I play with my hands on.

[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.580]
Here I am alone.

[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:53.740]
With my spark of care falling on my ethnic clean.

[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.420]
As I jump on life trampoline.

[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:06.080]
I am all alone in my thinking tree.

[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:12.300]
Well, playing it to me, he's got no personality.

[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.660]
So I feel all alone.

[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.120]
10 out of 2 at 5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:22.860]
I'm happy Tuesday.

[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.160]
So you remember I'm here now.

[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.460]
Got a little spy report during the last break.

[00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:28.280]
Remember that I'm here.

[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.640]
It is a mo and guilty on the overnight show.

[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.720]
I think maybe Jill and Mark are out after that last bad book.

[00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:36.460]
You think we're starting to get a little bit warmer now?

[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:41.160]
I think we're starting to get a little bit warmer if you ask me.

[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.660]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:44.400]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:45.360]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:47.440]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:48.680]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.800]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:55.240]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:05.400]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.620]
3.40 WDQ.

[00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:11.120]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:12.600]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.120]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.020]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.880]
5.60 WDQ.

[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.460]
Here's a call from Montclair.

[00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:25.680]
Good morning.

[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:26.520]
Yes, sir.

[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.780]
I've got to one ear poll.

[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:28.640]
It's very good.

[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:29.260]
Okay.

[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.020]
Awesome more marrow with it.

[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.400]
Parallels Detroit a lot of ways.

[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:38.200]
Once a great town with commerce and manufacturing real people now it's just a real

[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:43.260]
dive and okay I'll stay out of it. Hey by the way yes sir. It's a

[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:48.640]
post-tual not post-tual genius. Okay thanks. This is the the the

[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.680]
Abunion guy. That's the Abunion guy genius. I thought you said post-tual. I said

[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.900]
Puss as I was thinking about him. That's the guy again that's the Abunion guy.

[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:06.420]
Yeah. Mr. I'm smart and you're dumb but I'm obsessed okay. 5 6 7 0 5 6

[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.100]
they know ladies know nothing today it's gonna be pretty weak. What did you do

[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:12.320]
the audience over it? Even the guy that hated you said you were okay. I want to

[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:21.200]
cause last week boner boy. They actually weren't bad. Half the time. See I don't

[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.580]
want some kind of a sugar coated answer. I want to share coated. There was like a

[00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.440]
melee mouth answer. It would be like me asking you what the new lineup is

[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.660]
gonna be and then you're trying to like beat around a bush because you know

[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:33.920]
you're gonna get your ass canned if you tell everybody. And the same thing with

[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.720]
us. How are the very directs. This is like when I asked a poll question I speak

[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:40.780]
proper English and they have corrects who wouldn't have had any calls at all.

[00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:52.020]
There you go. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the on the 18 T and for eyes on wireless

[00:52:52.020 --> 00:52:56.180]
line what place did you visit or live in that you once loved but dislike the

[00:52:56.180 --> 00:53:02.860]
most. So far in New York 8. Mine is 7. Amsterdam 7 Detroit 5 Vegas 2 and

[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:07.960]
can't go to how can it only be 31 votes. Maybe their choices none or yet we

[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:12.240]
haven't added Baltimore yet for our a bullion guy. You think that could be it

[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.120]
that we put this honor too soon. Maybe their choice ain't on or yet right or

[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:19.640]
maybe they still love those places that's possible. Maybe they don't have any of

[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.480]
these categories. Maybe they still love New York they just can't afford to live

[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.900]
there or maybe they got thrown out or maybe they always hated those places. Right

[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:29.080]
like Amsterdam and maybe they still like going there and getting the stone on

[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:35.720]
their ass. Okay in spite of oh it's so sad so sad in fact maybe Elton John can

[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:49.620]
write a song about it. Here's a lady a lady in the Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi

[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:56.440]
overcrouted crazy traffic forable. Too hot and by the way I do love George. Okay

[00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:01.360]
thanks Donna. Bye bye George said the check is in a mail so there's one that's

[00:54:01.360 --> 00:54:05.660]
not gonna make our friend too happy. He's gonna be pissed off. Now she's right

[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:11.380]
Orlando used to be kind of a fun town now it sucks was. Yeah was it was okay. I

[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.100]
liked it. I used to see Bonerboy at the parliament house all the time. How could

[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:19.220]
you beat that smoking parliament lights. How could you beat it with a stick or 5 6 7

[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:23.200]
0 5 6. Oh guess what was on movie? All it's channel was you don't get last night.

[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:29.460]
God damn it. It was a show about graffiti. And it was actually some glory

[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.020]
holes that they showed because they were showing turlits you know different

[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:35.740]
bars and joints and places. Yeah and they showed glory holes on it which I

[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:39.360]
thought would have fit right in so well with this show but the graffiti thing of

[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.940]
it was really interesting and they had like a bunch of perverts on it you know

[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:49.060]
people that we can relate to and they were discussing the reasons why people do

[00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:52.440]
the thing and if I they were showing women who used their lipstick and they had

[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:57.900]
one brought on her who had a big what do you call these things? Prest. No she had

[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.980]
big breasts too but they were saggy but she had like a big magic marker what do

[00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:07.060]
you call those things like a sharpie. A big sharpie. She had a big sharp one and

[00:55:07.060 --> 00:55:10.420]
she's stranded on and she was checking out that glory hole I think. Now

[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.700]
seriously she had a big sharpie and then the other women were showing how they

[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.100]
used the different shades of lipstick to record graffiti. I never thought that

[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:20.240]
then ladies John that you would find like a lot of graffiti. How the hell would we

[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:24.000]
know? We wouldn't know but you might. You're the kind of guy that probably goes

[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:30.920]
slick here when nobody's looking. Sure. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.660]
and Verizon Wireless Line kind of a creepy start here especially on that pole.

[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:39.120]
Jesus Christ did you drive the whole freaking audience away? Let's blame George

[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:43.840]
Ford. That's what Vener Boehner boys said. Only 34 votes on here we've been

[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:46.880]
pumping this thing for a half an hour. I think you hit it earlier their choices

[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:51.180]
on there or they always thought these places sucked. Yeah or maybe they maybe

[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.160]
they think these places are great maybe. You think that everybody in this audience

[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.760]
who's been to Aspen Colorado thinks it sucks? Isn't that what Vener Boehner boys

[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:04.040]
always raven about? Aspen or is it that other place? Why? My guest. You like

[00:56:04.040 --> 00:56:13.400]
asked and asked it. Here's Miami. Hello. The new lineup. 6 to 10 Scott

[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:20.100]
Ferell, Jim Manage and Jan McKay. Now you can close. 10 to 2. Yeah.

[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:30.480]
Your Rogers. 2 to 6. Thanks. 6 to 10. The big. Oh. Yeah. Do you move it back to 10 to 2?

[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:37.380]
Oh that part. Well we'll see. I didn't even notice he said 10 to 2. Well I could be

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:42.320]
part of the way I think and it could fit or not as the case might be. That would

[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:46.020]
sure be great going back to 10 to 2. What do you folks think about that? Okay

[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.640]
thank you. I just counted all the hands are up in a year and they said we like it.

[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:55.740]
I sure like it. God damn nine o'clock hours. It's just it's a nightmare. Thanks a

[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:58.480]
lot Greg for taking a year of my life and practically putting me in a grave

[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:03.600]
give me a stroke you jackass you grave the robber man. That's what he is. He's a

[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:10.880]
freaking grave robber. Have to go through all the song and dance just because of

[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.620]
the fact that he screwed up the morning show and spent 15 months trying to undo

[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:22.700]
his his dastardly deeds. Here's a call from Boca hello. How you doing? Okay

[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:26.520]
sir. Yeah I got that from Amsterdam a couple weeks ago and it was extensive

[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:34.540]
consider like exchanging Canadian dollars for euros. Uh-huh. 50% right.

[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:40.440]
Unbelievable. What do you got against Key West? Well whatever I've never been there. I

[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.200]
don't have anything against that just never been there. And you only the only

[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.640]
thing that I'm always hearing about Key West is that people go there to get

[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.480]
drunk and when you don't drink what's the point of going to someplace where people

[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:53.420]
go to get drunk. There you go. Good looking drunk. Oh I got a request. Can you do

[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:59.060]
uh Boca? That's what I like about Boca. Yeah. Thank you. I'll work on it

[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:04.280]
Pally. Have a good day. Have a great day. I got it right over here's a matter of fact

[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.980]
the Boca song. How do you like that? I like it. I got my hand on it right now. I

[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:12.980]
think. Don't I? Come on. I worried about it. Somebody come in here maybe one

[00:58:12.980 --> 00:58:14.820]
of the uh civic chats came in.

[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:27.260]
Oh yeah. In fact if Sarah Goldfarb would have been an Amsterdam she'd have been one of

[00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.060]
most exciting people there. I'll guarantee you that at least one of the best looking.

[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:34.760]
And I'm talking about when she came out there at the end with a haircut. Yeah with a

[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:41.760]
nifty haircut. That Bob. I don't see that's what I like about Boca. Because I remember

[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:53.420]
it was on a really funky uh one of those CD uh things. Right. I got it. I got it.

[00:58:53.420 --> 00:58:57.340]
I got it. Huh. Well that would be really uh if I lost that thing again he'd really

[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.920]
get bent out of shape poor little Boca Brian. Just burning you know the copy. He just

[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:03.580]
burned another big one. Five six seven oh I was speaking to burn it and they were

[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.540]
gonna pass that. Well they're not gonna pass it. They're tabling it which means that

[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:10.420]
they're putting it out there for them to what you want and smoke on in the pass around.

[00:59:10.420 --> 00:59:15.380]
Puff on a little bit. And I'll guarantee you the US government don't

[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.740]
cut into that too much. They're not too crazy about it. Oh you the biggest news that happened

[00:59:18.740 --> 00:59:24.220]
while I was gone. Which I'm sure I'm positive that it was on our website. The reason I

[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:29.520]
know it was on our website is because I think that's where I printed it out from. The editor

[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:37.740]
from the New York Times about Dr. Bob. Yeah. Yeah. Pass the butter please. This is great.

[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:41.500]
And isn't it a shame but it always happens that a guy like Dr. Bob Atkins has to

[00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:46.240]
croak before he finally starts getting the credit you know. That a big news story about

[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:49.660]
it as a matter of fact. In fact that's what Mo was suggesting to me a couple of weeks ago

[00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.320]
he said you know really if you would just croak people would end there and say a lot

[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.120]
of nice things about you and all these years that you've been on the year in town. If

[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.140]
you would just die you know and I said no. I don't think so not yet.

[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:04.240]
Pass the butter please. Get the honey junior. Pass the butter same difference. So I want

[01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:07.220]
to read that. Very short editorial will get to that. Not too many bedtime stories. They're

[01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:10.880]
not on a first day back. Not after we try to rebuild the audience and of course build

[01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.760]
the excitement about these big new changes. I love those Latin ladies that are coming

[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:19.200]
to QA M any day now. I see the fact if I keep playing his voice on here and those droppings

[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.680]
people are going to think that it has something to do with the for real and maybe it does

[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:29.680]
and maybe it doesn't you know. What maybe it doesn't maybe it doesn't maybe it doesn't

[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:35.120]
maybe it does and maybe it does and do. 51 votes what place did you visit or live in

[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:43.580]
that you once loved but now this like the most Miami 16 New York 14 Amsterdam 7 the

[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:52.700]
trite 7 Vegas 4 and caned Cune has got three. Got it got it Baltimore and Orlando will

[01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.220]
go on list as soon as air gets around it. Okay. He's a little bit slow. At least I

[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.820]
noticed that one thing hasn't changed. He's a little bit slow. Now did you advise

[01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:04.620]
him of those other ones? Did you advise Eric Bonerboy? Just at the email. Okay. Because

[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:09.560]
I am always ripping him and ask a big fat ass which isn't hard in his case. Usually it's

[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.820]
your fault because you like you know you there's too much lag time. Yeah. Like the thing

[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:18.080]
we're getting with the facts. A lot of facts is pointing now. No. I knew it. Now that our

[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:22.700]
facts machine is working we're not getting any facts from you people out there 650198. We

[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:29.460]
got it fixed. Maybe they're going to the other one. Let me say it again. Our facts machine

[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:34.640]
works. They're a little slow. You're right. So you have to be in over there with those

[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.480]
beautiful people that look like a Rutherford B. Hayes and William Howard Taft. Remember

[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:43.320]
William Howard Taft? Oh yeah. Good for him. Now seriously you've seen the pictures of him

[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:48.320]
with a big beard and a big handlebar mustache right? That's what the people in Amsterdam

[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:53.420]
look like. Even the women. 10 13 and five and I was starting to say before about that

[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:57.720]
faabot they make great the bad products. It's just ashamed and under the local people

[01:01:57.720 --> 01:02:03.060]
over there. I've used any of them. Kind of like the French. Hey are you bald? Don't

[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:09.040]
call. I'm not asking you. I'm just asking like in general. Well there was a pause. There's

[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.160]
a pause because it's a question I'm waiting to give the answer. Don't interrupt the commercials

[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.160]
okay. Now Mr. Hotchurch is because I was on vacation for a week. In fact you may be part

[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.940]
of that change and you're not even aware of it yet. How do you like that Smarty pants?

[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:27.700]

[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:24.500]
like in Amsterdam several times again in the last 10 days and he's still an asshole.

[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:35.120]
A heart or a liver? I will I give it to you.

[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:43.720]
Just line right back they said to me and fill up this bed pan. They put a catheter in me and

[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:52.120]
I said who I'd I'd craft myself and boy it should smell this LaZee look he me a

[01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:00.060]
screw up my blood cells. Screwed up my blood cells. Then it got so tough to breathe I couldn't

[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:07.360]
stay alive. I wish I never signed a form that said do not revive. It said do not revive.

[01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:15.960]
I left my body and I started walking towards the light but that light was the flames of hell.

[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:28.440]
And this is where I will stay. I will burn eternally for writing the song for Gilligan's I

[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:34.700]
don't like it's like a nap on this microphone my god it's from like 1986.

[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:39.040]
His head was bustin awesome whip chunk Jesus.

[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:45.660]
1018 at 560 don't give us no whip chunk Hank. Tracey and Kindle Facts didn't

[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:50.540]
says my vote for the poll is the Bahamas now we're talking Tracey never again for love or

[01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:56.140]
money and I second that emotion. Then I'm showing a Requiem on independent film channel Saturday

[01:04:56.140 --> 01:05:01.220]
the 34th is this Saturday at 1215 in the morning which I'm assuming that means Friday night.

[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:08.200]
I would say if you go to iFCtv.com you can sign up to get a reminder email from them for what's

[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.740]

[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:09.300]
just couldn't wait to get out of South Florida it's just as uh to me as a toilet any other reason I

[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:16.140]
got to go back is because of work amen well said and one other question you're the radio maven I

[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:22.220]

[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.940]
they they tried to stick it to him and pay back as a bitch he turned it around it went to work for

[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:52.720]
the giants and he wanted to be in the world series so I screwed them that organization is screwed

[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:57.780]
over more people they deserve to have there 5,000 people again they suck yeah I agree with you one

[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:03.300]

[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:14.060]
right now well I mean just because I speak my mind doesn't mean that I can just make up the things

[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.560]
as I go along if you work for somebody they tell you well we don't want to let the cat out of the

[01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.560]
bag you can just that's a different story you know okay in other words I need to paycheck you know

about that whole Jamaican experience online right i hope our winners don't contest have a good time

[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:31.560]
there in spite of it and vc on bravo will court viewers this summer with american television's

[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:37.200]
first primetime gay theme reality dating series well i bet you're ever in jones we watch in that

[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.500]
yeah and then and who on dentist that will be glued to the screen take a note

[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:51.540]
he'll be glued to it similar in format to abc's the bachelor boy meets boy features an eligible man

[01:29:51.540 --> 01:29:56.800]
looking for love and a pool of 15 potential mates but in a twist worthy of the bogus viran on joe foxes

[01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:00.700]
joe millionaire some of the suitors are actually heterosexual men who are paid by the program to

[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:06.380]
pretend to be gay unbeknownst to the eligible bachelor this sounds like that jenny joneshoever right

[01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:12.960]
yeah sounds like it's got the potential for some real extra pursuiton this one seems to be on the

[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:19.000]
up and up i see i think this will be truly ground bag bet you'll be watching because it sounds

[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:25.680]
like it might have something to do with penis don't you think boner boy i think this will be truly

[01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:30.040]
groundbreaking television said series executive producer and co-creator Douglas Ross one of the

[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:33.560]
reasons we decided to take the basic dating format and sure when this twisted that we wanted

[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:38.940]
to show to appeal to a broader audience the six episode boy will premiere on bravo in july

[01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:42.780]
to date in time to be determined in each episode the bachelor will interact with other men on

[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:49.220]
uh on group and one on what what they'll interact with other men on group and one on one dates and

[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:53.340]
gradually eliminate those he isn't interested in until one winner remains and then of course if the

[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:59.860]
winner turns out to be straight somebody's got the year that bra brains blown out while the actual

[01:30:59.860 --> 01:31:03.760]
sexual orientation at least one consistent will be disclosed that the outset of viewers but not

[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.160]
the bachelor the identity of some of the others will not be revealed until a bachelor himself finds out

[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.960]
the exact number of heterosexual suitors was not devolved by bravo nor was the sum the network paid

[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:18.320]
any sexual intimacy beyond kissing was strictly prohibited on boy which was shot from May 9 to

[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:25.120]

[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:40.880]
some a fag stuff for you but it's gonna be titillating because it may be a faggy and it may not be

[01:31:40.880 --> 01:31:45.940]
and maybe some to go get their brains blown out in the end oh should be a little bit of a segment that

[01:31:45.940 --> 01:31:50.700]
I think that's probably coming the next reality show you know that thing where puppies that shoot the

[01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:56.080]
host right I think maybe that's gonna be it you know like shoot somebody yeah and we never know

[01:31:56.080 --> 01:31:59.620]
who's gonna get shot in the end of the show and they have to watch like about 15 episodes and then

[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:03.860]
the final one finally somebody gets just a pissed off that's it I already know what the name's gonna

to call him and see what he wants because I hope he's okay because I know a few years ago we

[01:32:25.260 --> 01:32:29.260]
had that the thing where they didn't you killed him in the hospital right and I know I did not

[01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:33.300]
hear him call him to races from Calder whenever the hell last time I checked the erasing channel

[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:39.400]
next break I'll call it good call up Phil Salpin if he's if he's not sick or anything tell him I

[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:43.520]
still can't stand the fact he put those people in my seats at the hockey game five six look at this

[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:47.780]
now see I would wish that we get a call online five now that we have it working so at least it

[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:53.900]
makes it worth a while huh baby steps come on baby crap is what you're talking about I can smell it

[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:58.280]
all the way up here it smells like baby crap come on you people get with it what is going on in

[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:03.000]
this show we got some exciting news and we're never gonna tell you unless you will butch up a little

[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:10.520]
bit five six seven oh five sixty who's going to be the first caller on line five now that it works

[01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:14.440]
huh I don't think we're getting up calls to you line five to ring now which which you see I don't

[01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:18.400]
know how those things work mix and match it's not an order here oh really in any particular order

[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:21.480]
so that means we'd have to get a lot of calls right at the moment there's only three on the board

[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:28.800]
pretty weak here's plantation hello me oh how you doing okay sir okay I got the real quick picture

[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:33.800]
programming problems yes which is very simple number one fire Joe's the gacking just because he's

[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:39.140]
stuck number two call Jeff the Forest probation officer see if a change of venues approved uh-huh

[01:33:39.140 --> 01:33:45.280]
get get a deep film a morning show get Howard David out of there oh and get managed on the

[01:33:45.280 --> 01:33:50.760]
morning show put Freyla on from one to three yeah and that pretty much fixes everything you get

[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:56.380]
guilty do not do okay and if they can't get Joe rose back to basically just hit a big reset

[01:33:56.380 --> 01:34:01.700]
button because I mean the last 16 months of this patient has been crud is programming line up

[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:05.280]

[01:39:59.260 --> 01:40:02.980]
about sex we'll find out from death leper

[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:15.060]
what ever gave you the idea it was about sex sex that is rich death leper vocalist Joe Elliott spoke

[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:21.000]
to inside the behind along with his manager slappy gold that song is not about sex right

[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:26.440]
definitely no I specifically told the boys write a song about sugar about how much you love

[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:30.700]
sugar and you want to pour it all over you right in fact if you had to choose between getting

[01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:35.840]
sugar poured on you or the luscious love nectar of some hot bay poured on you you would definitely

[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:42.860]
not go with the sweet sticky the listening moisture dripping from the nuts it's about

[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:49.480]
sex yeah it's toast about sex I mean what you got us I mean of course so why asks inside the behind

[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:54.940]
did they feel the need to lie listen things they've been too good for death leper since the 80s

[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:59.940]
we've been looking for ways to make some doors so we're we're doing a children's album yeah

[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:04.300]
we thought we could put some distance between us and love juices but the fans are gonna love

[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:09.060]
this record too don't you worry the boys ain't gonna compromise no way we're gonna rock you you know

a cover up he just was it wants me to call him off the years so I'll tell him the new lineup

[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:57.480]

[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:07.600]
as far as the rest of it nobody's gonna be watching jersey in the anaheim ducks including me who

[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.300]
and how it gives a flying crap okay just get it over with already and we don't give a crap about

[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:18.260]
Robbie need a myer and Scott need a myer and nobody cares and Martin Brodure and all his other fraud crap

[01:43:18.260 --> 01:43:24.160]
nobody cares here's the fact that since I know you've been on the case and so I don't know if you've

[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:27.580]
seen or heard the new campaign from the state to stuff or yes I have seen and read about it

[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:32.220]
and really frost my ass is being somebody who's militant about that seatbelt crap

[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:36.780]
the click it or ticket harassment project they're getting tough I'm growing up legal adults who

[01:43:36.780 --> 01:43:41.360]
work and pay taxes who choose not to wear a seatbelt how about zero tolerance and violent crime

[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:46.140]
rape and pedophilia it's one thing not securing a child but if an adult wants to go through the

[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:50.180]
windshield that's their problem do some real work other than harassing the innocent public and you are

[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:55.260]
right on top dry run today I really believe it I don't think the audience will respond until

[01:43:55.260 --> 01:44:03.640]
the new lineup takes place if then here's Miami Beach hello Daniel yes sir I'm work that's

[01:44:03.640 --> 01:44:10.660]
talking low I got it for you mowing guilty six to eight eight to ten for L 10 to two you two to

[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:16.620]
three men dog and then the rest is all the same if you know how close you were man we'd send you

[01:44:16.620 --> 01:44:20.900]
a million dollars in small bills and then you know of course Hank could lose the hour

[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:26.440]
Hank could lose the hour or a couple of pounds either way okay thanks to me go he's very close

[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.720]
he's pretty damn close to it you know what yeah of course if I say any more than that then I'll be

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.840]
letting the civic head out of the bag I don't want to do that and get mothin to a whole bunch of crap

[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:40.380]
I think since it's already past 11 o'clock in the morning don't you think it's time for them

[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:44.800]
like to give us the official go ahead now since we the ratings come out we put it out on this show

[01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:48.860]
this is the place where people at least they used to be for George kill the audience for a week

[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:54.200]
yeah seriously this is where the people are meeting greet and eat and tweet and whatever

[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:01.080]
pick their seat eat spoiled rotten meat probably from Canada at the sweet treat

[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:10.720]
so I think it's about time I maybe want to give them a deadline like by noon I think by noon

[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:14.280]
muffler clearance ought to come through that door and say just give you the big thumbs up okay

[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:19.900]
put it on the air okay because we know the story we know what it is in fact I think I am going

[01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:25.240]
to spill part of the bean right now since that last guy had it is that okay I ain't saying nothing

[01:45:31.080 --> 01:45:35.000]
yeah I think I think what we're going to do is we're going to tell the audience that this

[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.320]
program and I've been screaming about it from the first week it started we're going back to

[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:47.200]
10 to 2 yeah yeah I mean I'm not telling any of the rest of the stuff it doesn't has nothing

[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:51.480]
to do with personnel changes we're just going back to the day part that this show should have been

[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:59.840]
all along we've never should have had like let's see 13 14 15 months of 9 to 1 nobody does

[01:45:59.840 --> 01:46:09.020]
the show from 9 to 1 it's not done 9 to 1 got it and it ain't no fun what just happened

[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:15.280]
all this for real you just can't contain himself oh is that it yeah breath he's got his own

[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:19.800]
studio over there did you see some of the hose they got on the wall dripping in there

[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:26.220]
that's probably why you'll see a lot of him around so we're going back to 10 to 2 there's

[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:30.040]
one piece of the puzzle I'm letting out a little a little bit here a little bit there because you know

[02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:24.320]
took forever to put up how long is it going to take to correct them or first of all it's already

[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:27.400]
the end of me and I can't imagine that they're going to spend the big bucks to keep those things

[02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:32.520]
out there all along plus we got the spy report on a one on Griffin road by the turnpike there

happening anyway but is it the matrix we loaded I'll pass okay it's eleven fifty nine coming up on

[02:28:54.660 --> 02:28:59.340]
the big you know what is going to be great what we can dig out a lot of that old stuff

[02:28:59.340 --> 02:29:06.840]
or you just hate people that use snappy openers for their show segments like that one to two

[02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:22.960]
hour it's the water to two hours it's the one to do hour it's not just the one to two hour

[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:28.100]

[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:35.180]
they're getting now you realize how close this faxes to the actual lineup yeah I know wow this

[02:33:19.100 --> 02:33:21.760]
part of the audience away they're all out of town they're all the way down I'm stood on

[02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:26.040]
or maybe there was like some major news thing we didn't know about maybe the thought police

like maybe half an hour of that and then I mean you were talking about the penny sales tax and oh no

[02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:56.500]

[02:33:56.500 --> 02:34:00.580]
duff you and clearance between the two of you whether without the 10 to 2 between the two of you

[02:34:00.580 --> 02:34:04.600]
brains were dangerous our programming people would be the safest people in America and that's my fault

[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:07.640]
I didn't tell him which tape to play I forgot to tell you about the hope and Cuba that's what they

[02:34:07.640 --> 02:34:18.300]

[02:34:30.020 --> 02:34:34.320]
going on and I come in on here today and the response has been a minimal to nonexistent number one

[02:34:34.320 --> 02:34:41.000]
and number two I'm hearing all of this crap like what went on yesterday why don't we just put

[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.120]
up new billboards and say don't listen to us please go away okay we got to where the audience is

[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:49.860]
getting too big to handle it gets unwieldy when it gets that big speaker that the trend coming out

[02:34:49.860 --> 02:34:55.920]
later this week really I asked a muffmeister when he called me breathlessly yesterday duff

[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.200]

[02:35:15.380 --> 02:35:21.840]
editorial from May 25th New York Times passed a butter please I think a lot of people are in

[02:35:21.840 --> 02:35:32.040]
apology to dr bob posthumously posthumously I don't know that asshole be calm back

[02:35:32.040 --> 02:35:37.120]
posthumously dr. Robert Atkins the diet guru who died last month from head injury suffered in

[02:35:37.120 --> 02:35:40.760]
a fall would have enjoyed reading last week's issue of the new England Journal of Medicine it

[02:35:40.760 --> 02:35:44.360]
carried two independent studies that enhanced the credibility of his controversial low carbohydrate

[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:49.380]
high fat high protein approach to weight loss though the Atkins diet has been reviled by the

[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:54.560]
medical establishment for decades is a bit wacky and even potentially dangerous the two new

[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:59.280]
studies in the third published last month suggested that actually works better than standard low

[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:04.020]
fat diets in the short term about any detectable signs of harm it was a startly reminder of how

[02:36:04.020 --> 02:36:08.560]
little the experts know in this obesity plague nation about the best way to lose weight and keep

[02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:14.280]
it off amen for the past several decades the prevailing dietary dog must have been that a fat

[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:18.760]
laden diet is bad for you driving up weight and clogging the arteries with substances that can

[02:36:18.760 --> 02:36:24.260]
endanger the heart going against the grain was that against the greens dr. Ratkin said the real

[02:36:24.260 --> 02:36:28.060]
culvert was carbohydrates it was just fine we'd all the stick eggs and butter that we were in for

[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:32.180]
as long as we cut down on the carbs unfortunately there was scant scientific evidence to support his

[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:37.760]
claims now however three controlled clinical trials and small numbers of patients have validated

[02:36:37.760 --> 02:36:42.660]
the Atkins approach at least when pursued for six months one study of 63 moderately obese

[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:48.280]
subjects put on half put half on a conventional low fat diet and half on the Atkins plan the Atkins

[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:53.120]
Dutters lost more weight than the comparison group and surprisingly had healthier blood fat levels

[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:59.740]
fewer dangerous triglycerides and more good cholesterol the only trouble is neither that worked all

[02:36:59.740 --> 02:37:04.120]
that well given the group's excessive weight averaging 216 pounds at the start those on the Atkins

[02:37:04.120 --> 02:37:08.700]
that lost an average of 15 pounds by the end of six months and those on a conventional that lost seven

[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:12.500]
by the end of the year however each group had gained some of the weight back with the Atkins

[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:17.060]
group leading the way worse yet people dropped out of both diets and droves the sad truth is no

[02:37:17.060 --> 02:37:20.660]
matter what diet people go on they have a hard time sticking to it it's enough to drain a

[02:37:20.660 --> 02:37:25.780]
dress back to the drinking man's diet says the New York Times and they're at a twirl of course with

[02:37:25.780 --> 02:37:30.780]
what's been going on at the time they're probably doing the drink and man's diet anyway what do you think

[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:37.320]
oh what I would think poor dr bobby's dead and buried now and finally they're saying you know

[02:37:37.320 --> 02:37:47.040]
what you were right oh too late yeah we like to apologize oh too late it's like Galileo and

[02:37:49.140 --> 02:37:55.720]

it might happen as soon as Thursday I'm not gonna like blurt a bunch of stuff out on a year that

[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:01.180]
would be bad get them all been out of shape which it's their own fault see that's not the way you

[02:39:01.180 --> 02:39:05.000]
do things in a business you do things in a certain kind of a way but they don't know how to do it

[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.520]
that way and they give you kind of like see if somebody says to me absolutely positively I like

[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:14.440]
kind of Lisa for example okay right if we are we were to play that again right now should I'll be

[02:39:14.440 --> 02:39:22.820]
fired right absolutely correct sir because that's a management dictum that comes from corporate that's

[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:27.580]
that's the image that's just that it's been the law has been laid down and when you put something

[02:39:27.580 --> 02:39:33.540]
in those terms in you draw the line in the sand that's fine but here it's always oh we'll have

[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:40.220]
some fun and bye bye don't be too specific you know like you know well what is that you know it's

[02:39:40.220 --> 02:39:44.920]
like sitting down and taking half a dump you know and leave a couple of big hangar there you can't

[02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:51.200]
do that yeah you don't like walk around yeah that pulled your pants up I mean I heard that surfing

[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:54.960]
expression hanging ten but that's just a little bit too much right down to the back of your

[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:02.720]
kneecap I would think huh that would be really bad good thing Carlos is in eating right now oh

[02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:09.560]
it's an easy thing yeah wow who cares I'm sure it wouldn't be the first pile he dug into

[02:40:12.180 --> 02:40:17.000]
I'll guarantee you that well I mean a guy that doesn't like chocolate all the other good food we've

[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:21.020]
talked about in his program his taste is in his touch what do you think about these dumpster diver

[02:40:23.320 --> 02:40:27.320]
five six seven oh five sixty at least we're having a good time anyway the audience seems to be a

[02:40:27.320 --> 02:40:31.640]
little bit all out of sorts but that's okay too bad and you know what they're bothered by what the

[02:40:31.640 --> 02:40:41.740]
fact is we know something and they don't always disturbs them greatly yeah we do and we like to

[02:40:41.740 --> 02:40:46.480]
send them back believe me it's 11 past noon at five sixty double to kill wasn't I talking about

[02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:30.540]
You better get the cut, then the higher the L

[02:43:30.540 --> 02:43:34.580]
Pull the sun is gonna cook you like an ion shell

[02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:39.820]
Come on, come on, pull that cut that lotion with me

[02:43:43.280 --> 02:43:44.800]
Ooh, I sure don't like the way that ends

[02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:46.360]
You know, like all over the place

[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:50.080]
Cuff 16 at 5'60, little Eva's rolling over in her freshly painted grave

[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:52.320]
And she just died here a short time ago

[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:52.500]
Right

[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:56.320]
Poor little Eva, she wouldn't be liking that, I guarantee you

[02:43:56.320 --> 02:43:59.340]
You know, the Trimbo hemiens, a lot of people when they talk about Amsterdam

[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:02.060]
They'll say, oh well, that's a real Bohemian place

[02:44:02.060 --> 02:44:04.180]
You know what Bohemian really is code for? Scummy

[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:10.060]
Scummy is right, people that don't bathe, that don't ever get a haircut

[02:44:10.060 --> 02:44:13.860]
People address like slabs who sleep in their clothing for like days at a time

[02:44:14.300 --> 02:44:17.740]
People with bad breath who haven't seen a toothbrush since before Jesus was a baby

[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:19.160]
That's what Bohemian means

[02:44:19.700 --> 02:44:22.160]
And where people are so wasted, they're like staggering or mono

[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:25.120]
Yeah, it didn't used to be that way there, but that's what it is now, it blows

[02:44:25.760 --> 02:44:27.020]
It blows chunks

[02:44:27.020 --> 02:44:28.340]
You got it?

[02:44:28.380 --> 02:44:29.760]
I think he came from Broward

[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:32.740]
1217 at 5'60, WQA

[02:44:34.440 --> 02:44:39.280]
5'60, 7'05, 60, pound 5'60 on the AT&T in Verizon World

[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.340]
Stay tuned for the new Neil and Ferrell psychic show

[02:44:43.020 --> 02:44:45.620]
Right, anticipate exactly what he's gonna say

[02:44:47.220 --> 02:44:48.560]
Here's North Miami, hello

[02:44:49.280 --> 02:44:49.760]
Hello

[02:44:49.760 --> 02:44:50.620]
Yes sir

[02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:53.680]
How you doing? Yes, I'm calling to give a comment on the Amsterdam

[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:54.660]
Yes sir?

[02:44:55.540 --> 02:44:58.920]
I think that'd be a great place to go for vacation for so long

[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:02.500]
They just want to go and dabble on the coffee shops for like two or three days

[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:04.760]
And go visit the Heineken factory

[02:45:05.500 --> 02:45:07.620]
Oh yeah, Heineken factory is really exciting

[02:45:08.020 --> 02:45:11.420]
Well, I mean, you guys just go there and drink a little bit and relax for two or three days

[02:45:11.420 --> 02:45:13.040]
Party a little bit, let's run with that

[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:15.760]
When's the last time were you there?

[02:45:16.520 --> 02:45:18.160]
Well, I should have planned on going in about a month

[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:20.560]
I hear so many great things about a place where you'd want to go

[02:45:20.560 --> 02:45:22.320]
So you're telling me you've never been there?

[02:45:22.980 --> 02:45:23.940]
Not never been

[02:45:24.320 --> 02:45:25.440]
Well, don't do it

[02:45:26.600 --> 02:45:27.820]
You'll hate it

[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:31.320]
You think just for two or three days just to go drink and gable?

[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:34.800]
I got news for, I'd rather be in a coma for two or three days than go back to Amsterdam

[02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:35.980]
That's how much I hated it

[02:45:35.980 --> 02:45:37.980]
And I'm something that like lived there for part of two years

[02:45:37.980 --> 02:45:41.500]
Okay, I hate it, I despise it, you'll hate it

[02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:43.400]
So tell me where do you think I should go for vacation?

[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:46.380]
If you want to go to Europe? Yeah

[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:50.100]
Go to Berlin, go to Cologne, go to Barcelona

[02:45:50.100 --> 02:45:51.320]
But don't go to Amsterdam

[02:45:52.220 --> 02:45:54.560]
How much time have you got to go on vacation anyway?

[02:45:54.680 --> 02:45:58.020]
Why would you want to waste what precious time you've got in a place that's a toilet?

[02:45:58.480 --> 02:46:00.860]
Well, actually I have two months off from work

[02:46:00.860 --> 02:46:01.360]
Uh-huh

[02:46:02.560 --> 02:46:05.140]
Well, like I said then you can afford a couple of days in Amsterdam

[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:07.720]
Have a good time, Palli

[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:08.360]
Have a great time

[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:11.940]
See, he wants me to tell him it's great, okay, it's great, I love it

[02:46:11.940 --> 02:46:13.960]
You know, you love it

[02:46:13.960 --> 02:46:19.000]
Go to Rome, go to Venice, go to Frenza, Florence, go to a Milano even

[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.280]
Even as whatever to go to all these other places

[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:23.280]
But you know, go to Copenhagen

[02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:24.960]
That's a fun place

[02:46:26.020 --> 02:46:27.360]
Clean, people are dressed

[02:46:27.360 --> 02:46:29.540]
They look like they haven't slept and are clothing for two months

[02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:33.500]
I just came back two days ago sir, I'm trying to explain to you people

[02:46:33.500 --> 02:46:34.940]
It places a toilet

[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:37.580]
If you're in the drugs

[02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:40.480]
It would seem to me that you probably got a pretty good source right now

[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:43.200]
Call up Sarah Goulfarble, okay? She'll give you what's his name's number

[02:46:43.920 --> 02:46:45.220]
The doctor was his name

[02:46:45.220 --> 02:46:46.980]
No, her son, what that was his name? Harry

[02:46:46.980 --> 02:46:49.120]
Harry, show me your Harry's number, okay?

[02:46:50.120 --> 02:46:53.540]
He's got a little problem, he always has to grab the phone with that one hand

[02:46:54.300 --> 02:46:55.020]
Oh man

[02:46:55.680 --> 02:46:56.040]
Yeah

[02:46:57.340 --> 02:46:57.700]
God

[02:46:59.060 --> 02:47:01.020]
It just ain't what it used to be, man

[02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:04.560]
It's just like saying, well how about if I had two or three days ago to Detroit

[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:07.480]
It'd be a lot of fun, what would you do there?

[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:10.160]
What would you do there besides just try to stay alive?

[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:13.380]
I mean, we're all the great restaurants that used to be there, they're all gone

[02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:14.300]
They're all closed

[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:21.200]
It's a grotesque, depressing, horrendous place, that's what I'm trying to explain to you sir

[02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:24.400]
It's a nasty rotten place and have a great time

[02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:27.200]
There's no matter what I'm gonna say, he's still gonna go there

[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.060]
And then the Heineken factory, I mean, Jesus, God

[02:47:32.460 --> 02:47:35.820]
Oh, I don't get your free little little cantabere when you go in there, go through the tour

[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:39.340]
People that go on tours through the Heineken factory, those people need mental help

[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:40.160]
Heineken

[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:42.600]
Oh, Jesus, God

[02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:46.200]
In the meantime, yes, Wednesday, 1 o'clock trend

[02:47:47.660 --> 02:47:53.740]
Who cares, that's not important, what's important is when does this audience get to find out the new QAM lineup and when it starts

[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:57.260]
When do we find out when it starts, that might be nice to know when we find out

[02:47:57.260 --> 02:48:01.020]
Well, that's what we want to know, inquiring minds would like to find out

[02:48:01.020 --> 02:48:02.940]
Who just gave you this trend crap stuff?

[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:05.020]
Well, screw him, okay

[02:48:06.080 --> 02:48:08.960]
I'm not really screw him, I mean, a borrower said it wasn't too bad

[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:10.980]
Who?

[02:48:11.100 --> 02:48:15.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, no, I'm serious, I want to know, we want to like get with it all right, instead of all this

[02:48:15.560 --> 02:48:20.220]
Everything is gonna be a big song at a dance, and this has been going on for a long time now

[02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:24.720]
Let's just, what do they say, Fisher cut bait, whatever that means, Fisher master bait

[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:27.060]
Well, what is that expression, or off the pot?

[02:48:27.580 --> 02:48:30.980]
Right, crap or get the hanger out of there and get off the pot

[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:33.720]
You're still obsessed with that thing about the hanger

[02:48:33.720 --> 02:48:35.920]
Well, we got a lot of hangers on a QAM

[02:48:35.920 --> 02:48:37.680]
Especially an engineering George Corso

[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:43.840]
What's your take on Neil going back to 10 to 2? There's 197 votes, that's not too bad, not too good

[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:50.160]
I love it 88, I'll listen whatever, 88, 44.6% we like that a lot

[02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:54.820]
People who are easy, it's okay 15, and I hate it 6 only 2%

[02:48:55.640 --> 02:48:56.300]
Hate it

[02:48:56.300 --> 02:48:59.060]
And that probably has to do with their work schedule like that one guy, you know

[02:49:00.180 --> 02:49:05.300]
I feel like I'm rambling now, you know, maybe I'm a little in coherent, but that guy, people in the world

[02:49:05.300 --> 02:49:07.400]
You know what, seriously this guy, well, you know what's wrong with him

[02:49:07.400 --> 02:49:09.280]
Like he knows something, he's never been there

[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:14.340]
And I just, I've been spending as much of the day as possible warning people

[02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:18.060]
Don't go there because it's a shadow, a shadow of what it once was

[02:49:18.980 --> 02:49:24.760]
How much time can you spend in a coffee shop sitting there puffing away, stoned on your ass?

[02:49:24.900 --> 02:49:28.160]
I mean some of you obviously are the rest of your life, okay great, go have a good time

[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.820]
Start the timer now, I'll let you know how long

[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:30.320]
Okay

[02:49:30.980 --> 02:49:33.840]
Or come up here, it's a lot closer and a lot cheaper and a lot cleaner

[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:35.540]
And if people are actually bathed once in a while

[02:49:36.480 --> 02:49:39.240]
Now we do have a little, you know, a few disease problems, but

[02:49:40.320 --> 02:49:41.020]
Mad sorry

[02:49:41.460 --> 02:49:43.640]
But at least you'll be clean when they put you in the box

[02:49:44.420 --> 02:49:45.800]
Here's for Lauderdale, hello

[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:47.860]
Sometimes I feel a little bit bad

[02:49:47.860 --> 02:49:50.000]
Oh God, now I know what he, I know

[02:49:50.460 --> 02:49:53.080]
What do you have sometimes, I feel like I have a few words out

[02:49:53.960 --> 02:49:55.980]
And we feel like you should die, what are you okay?

[02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:59.580]
We just took an instant poll, everybody knew how to say they wish that you would die

[02:49:59.580 --> 02:50:02.580]
Right away, not next week, not a week from circus, now

[02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:06.460]
Die Dainu, that's what they said, even a glium are singing it, die Dainu

[02:50:08.500 --> 02:50:09.500]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:50:11.500 --> 02:50:11.920]
Miami

[02:50:12.380 --> 02:50:14.120]
Hi, yes sir

[02:50:14.120 --> 02:50:14.860]
Yes sir, how are you doing?

[02:50:15.380 --> 02:50:15.540]
Good

[02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:18.540]
I was in color in there a couple of years ago

[02:50:18.540 --> 02:50:22.400]
You're absolutely correct about that being a beautiful place

[02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.200]
I feel that the dome was out

[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:24.820]
Right

[02:50:24.820 --> 02:50:26.180]
Right on the square there

[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:31.980]
I don't know if you noticed the out of there, they're betting on the plies of there

[02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:34.460]
These beautiful street painters

[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:38.020]
And the interesting thing is that

[02:50:38.020 --> 02:50:42.220]
Did you notice across the street from the dome, right across the dome, but the clock is

[02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.500]
There's a McDonald's there

[02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:44.320]
Yes

[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:45.740]
And you know

[02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:50.080]
Well they, well in the train station, I'm sure you saw there's a pizza hut and they got McDonald's and Burger King

[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:52.020]
They got all the poising that we're exporting, yes

[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:55.580]
Yeah, but the interesting thing was that I went down there with Sunday morning to get breakfast

[02:50:55.580 --> 02:51:00.180]
And you know the McDonald's and Germany sells beer on a Sunday

[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:01.160]
I'm sure that

[02:51:01.160 --> 02:51:04.480]
Yeah, I was surprised that the McDonald's would be selling beer

[02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:10.260]
In fact, I was talking to some of the Germans, they said the only stein they like is if it's filled with beer

[02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:13.620]
Yeah, and the other interesting thing is if you go to the bars over there

[02:51:14.080 --> 02:51:17.720]
There's a lot of Irish people sending these bars over there

[02:51:17.720 --> 02:51:18.280]
Really?

[02:51:18.280 --> 02:51:19.140]
Yeah, sure

[02:51:19.140 --> 02:51:24.760]
Yeah, right behind the dome, they tell us the big Irish bar and down just by the rain nail is another big Irish bar

[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:28.680]
And a lot of Irish people working in letting over there in Germany

[02:51:28.680 --> 02:51:32.760]
Aren't you amazed at how well dressed and clean cut the people are in that city?

[02:51:32.860 --> 02:51:34.280]
I mean, you know, people

[02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:36.640]
I feel beautiful and very clean and it's a nice place to visit

[02:51:36.640 --> 02:51:42.240]
That guy was in steady arms, so damn, he would have much better time in coming home

[02:51:42.240 --> 02:51:44.160]
Amen, thanks a lot, Pally

[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:45.020]
You're welcome, sir

[02:51:45.020 --> 02:51:49.080]
Yeah, see that's what I would do if I was in by, I didn't waste my time trying to go on

[02:51:49.080 --> 02:51:51.060]
Because he was obviously not going to listen to me anyway

[02:51:51.060 --> 02:51:54.240]
Like he's never been there, I've been there about at least a hundred times

[02:51:54.240 --> 02:51:57.080]
But he's the expert, I'm talking about the punk they call before

[02:51:57.660 --> 02:52:00.040]
He's the expert and I'm like a bowzo

[02:52:01.020 --> 02:52:02.480]
Which I would admit to that part

[02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:07.900]
Get on again on a plane, go to Amsterdam and then immediately don't even leave the oil and speaking of train stations

[02:52:07.900 --> 02:52:09.920]
All central station, Amsterdam, they're like redoing it

[02:52:09.920 --> 02:52:12.620]
So it fits in with the ambiance of the rest of the city

[02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:15.480]
Because it's just all torn apart and it's really dumpy and frumpy

[02:52:15.480 --> 02:52:17.940]
I mean, just nasty, rotest

[02:52:19.640 --> 02:52:24.100]
Just go to the counter to the train place and get you on a train to Cologne

[02:52:24.100 --> 02:52:26.180]
You'll be there in two and a half hours, two hours and forty minutes

[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:31.320]
Oh, I should have pulled a article out about Bear Aspirin

[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:34.140]
Did you see there? Did you talk about that about the Bear people were selling

[02:52:36.180 --> 02:52:40.340]
To Hemophilia, they were selling a drug that they knew caused HIV infection

[02:52:40.340 --> 02:52:42.840]
Those freaking experimenting on Jews Nazis

[02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:48.840]
Yes, now they're experimenting on Third World Country because they couldn't pedal the crap in the US or Europe because we were onto them

[02:52:48.840 --> 02:52:55.060]
So they were still selling the medication in Third World countries and then finally they just got caught and they've been fined

[02:52:55.060 --> 02:52:57.620]
I mean, to bear people, man, they've got more people

[02:52:58.340 --> 02:52:59.960]
More ways of poisoning the public

[02:52:59.960 --> 02:53:00.740]
Just fine

[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:05.000]
Well, whatever happened, I don't know, it's an ongoing thing

[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:05.820]
See what I'm saying?

[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:09.400]
In addition to which one you're dying in Third World Country who's going to go sue somebody for?

[02:53:09.480 --> 02:53:10.660]
Who's going to go sue Bear Aspirin?

[02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:11.300]
Yeah, good for him

[02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:14.640]
Don't you people out there buy a Bear Aspirin under penalty of death, okay?

[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:16.200]
I'm flushing all my alchiceltzer

[02:53:16.580 --> 02:53:17.840]
Right, did they make that too?

[02:53:17.980 --> 02:53:18.460]
Yeah, unfortunately

[02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:19.340]
Well, don't buy it

[02:53:19.340 --> 02:53:23.040]
Nope, anything that Bear's got to do with just avoid it like the plague, okay?

[02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:24.460]
Buy it, if you have a baby

[02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:28.260]
In fact, when a train came in luckily because I guess I was facing the opposite way

[02:53:28.260 --> 02:53:32.080]
Luckily, I didn't get to see the big Bear sign when you crossed the bridge coming into Cologne

[02:53:32.080 --> 02:53:36.300]
Oh, God, it just crossed my fat ass when I see that Bear sign

[02:53:38.620 --> 02:53:39.780]
We have aes

[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:41.560]
Yeah

[02:53:42.540 --> 02:53:45.180]
Yeah, Bear, in fact the signer says Bear, it's a gas

[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:52.500]
26th, I'm going to keep thinking about that hanger, you know, we've got to stop it

[02:53:52.500 --> 02:53:54.560]
Remember what you own crop would say, no more hangers

[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:54.860]
I know

[02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.640]
Well, that's what happens when you, you know, extract your kids to the bedposts sooner or later they got there

[02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:01.940]
You know, it's got to come out somehow

[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:06.900]
27 past noon at 560 WQM if your carpets look like it

[02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:10.100]
And maybe to smell not too good either probably because you haven't had them cleaned in a long time

[02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:14.140]
Every year for the last 21 years plus I've been using dry concepts in my home

[02:54:14.140 --> 02:54:16.960]
And you ought to be doing the same thing too because nobody does it better

[02:54:17.400 --> 02:54:22.540]
So whether it's your carpets, your draper, your expensive area, your rugs, your oriental rugs, your leather furniture, your poultry

[02:54:22.540 --> 02:54:25.740]
All of these things, these are the folks you ought to entrust to dry concepts

[02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:29.100]
And trust your valuables too, however I just said

[02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:37.940]
If you have problems with pet orders and milder orders because by water damage they're not really a problem because dry concepts will work the same miracle on those and make them look and smell and feel just like brand new

[02:54:37.940 --> 02:54:43.420]
So you owe it to yourself and your carpets to call the professionals and dry concepts and work their magic in your home

[02:54:43.420 --> 02:54:49.040]
And don't forget no rip-offs, no games to give you a guaranteed written price up front before they start their magic

[02:54:49.040 --> 02:54:54.800]
Call them tool free and be sure and tell them that old Neo told you to call 1-800-2485071

[02:54:54.800 --> 02:55:00.080]
1-800-2485071 and just log on to their website at dryconcepts.com

[02:55:00.080 --> 02:55:04.000]
Don't forget with dry concepts it's true, you're clean today, you can entertain tonight

[02:55:06.840 --> 02:55:09.800]
We're sports video 5CC, UAM

[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:13.660]
We're on our balcony

[02:55:16.500 --> 02:55:17.060]
Welcome

[02:55:20.180 --> 02:55:21.340]
Hey, could I eat lunch?

[02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:27.700]
We'll meet again if we don't wind up down

[02:55:28.340 --> 02:55:33.260]
From the push cart till they left us all this way

[02:55:36.060 --> 02:55:42.720]
We thought then due, blinds to cold, it was our duty

[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:48.040]
As the bombs drop from the stars come far away

[02:55:49.720 --> 02:55:57.400]
Maybe we should have paid attention a little bit more to the facts we chose to ignore

[02:55:58.040 --> 02:56:05.320]
The price of gaffer's decalant but I'm afraid that the alarm won't be very long

[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:12.160]
We'll meet again with a hold that by the

[02:56:13.160 --> 02:56:19.160]
Civil rights will be restored one sunny day

[02:56:21.140 --> 02:56:27.340]
We'll meet again if we don't wind up down

[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:34.640]
From the push cart till they left us all this way

[02:56:35.760 --> 02:56:41.120]
We'll meet again with a hold that by the

[02:56:42.280 --> 02:56:47.620]
Civil rights will be restored one sunny day

[02:56:47.620 --> 02:56:53.320]
Come 31 at 560 WQM, the Mad Dog coming along at one hank in the studio at 3 tomorrow

[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:57.980]
He'll be at Chulas, 630 we got to Marlon pregame, Marlon's and the Expo is a be a gigantic crowd

[02:56:57.980 --> 02:57:02.820]
That came 705 at PP Park, 80K at 10, Joanne Mark overnight to the 6th in the morning

[02:57:02.820 --> 02:57:07.300]
At least that's the schedule for today, it's going to change very soon we believe

[02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:09.620]
Any updates on that yet? Nope, why not?

[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:15.040]
Here's the fact that says I love that you're finally going back to tend to do it's about time

[02:57:15.040 --> 02:57:16.480]
Absolutely correct

[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.980]
Amen, be a boy did a good job yesterday although we did play a couple of bits more than once

[02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:22.900]
Did you play a couple of bits more than once, Bono Boy?

[02:57:26.080 --> 02:57:29.000]
I played one more than once, the itty bitty titty didty

[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.780]
Oh good, I like that one and George never plays it

[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:34.880]
I don't do you? Sure

[02:57:34.880 --> 02:57:37.480]
Why did you play that? I don't know

[02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:39.140]
I'm sure I played it last week

[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:42.900]
You played with a request for it, I'm pretty sure I played it

[02:57:47.160 --> 02:57:51.140]
Oh, anyway it says you think you could add a daily 5 minute guiding light, we can't do your show?

[02:57:51.140 --> 02:57:53.520]
No, not if I want to stay on the ear item

[02:57:54.380 --> 02:57:59.120]
All right, I did see the first half hour yesterday before passions, the one that you people didn't see yet

[02:57:59.880 --> 02:58:04.200]
But I guess the end of the very end of passions today, it's worth the pain of all the rest of it

[02:58:04.200 --> 02:58:11.380]
Fox and what's his name in Julian and all that, it's crap but the very end of the last scene is well worth the press of your mission on passions today

[02:58:11.380 --> 02:58:12.540]
I just mentioned that in passing

[02:58:13.700 --> 02:58:18.460]
It says I'm in between two houses so I haven't had my Tivo hooked up, haven't been able to watch the guy in the night for almost two months now

[02:58:18.460 --> 02:58:25.660]
Maybe just a mention of sexy Gus I Tiro every now and then would do oh my god if not oh well, I'll still be listening anyhow

[02:58:26.580 --> 02:58:29.640]
Gus I Tiro is about a sexy is a Vener boys ass

[02:58:30.820 --> 02:58:32.180]
That sexy? Thanks

[02:58:32.180 --> 02:58:37.980]
The hot guys on as you've been and Shane are the hot guys on God so whoever said this facts it's unsigned

[02:58:56.980 --> 02:58:59.040]
But I really want to thank you for coming by and joining us today

[02:58:59.040 --> 02:59:04.440]
Tough to the that's my comment to that okay the Bush administration doesn't like it because it's too permissive

[02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:07.460]
It's not fascistic enough for them okay, it's not goose stepping enough

[02:59:09.260 --> 02:59:10.980]
Here's a call from Miami Lakes hello

[02:59:22.940 --> 02:59:28.160]

[03:00:10.580 --> 03:00:14.580]
We got some massive programming changes coming up very very soon at QAM

[03:00:14.580 --> 03:00:19.520]
That's all we can tell you we can't tell you because I decided we can tell you that this show is going back to tend to two

[03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:24.020]
That's all we can say other than that it would be I mean I'll let George say it if he wants

[03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:30.480]
Here's a call from sunrise hello

[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:35.100]
Hello, Neil yes, sir. Hey, how you doing great good good?

[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:40.540]
Let me ask you what was that movie that guy was talking about before with that I think it was you talk about the needle or heroin

[03:00:42.620 --> 03:00:46.420]
Requiem for a dream oh recommend your dream. Oh, okay, and

[03:00:46.420 --> 03:00:51.100]
One of the greatest movies in the history of the human race don't take my word for it get it

[03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:55.300]
Yeah, yeah, definitely gonna go right yeah, and I think George does an excellent job

[03:00:55.300 --> 03:00:59.980]
Can I ask George a quick question? Sure go ahead. George. Do you know those green drive tickets left?

[03:01:03.580 --> 03:01:03.980]
No

[03:01:03.980 --> 03:01:07.840]
Actually, we do but you know yeah, not while I'm doing the show okay

[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.160]
George can do giveaways while he's doing a show and believe me if we'd had to giveaways today if I'd have known that I'd

[03:01:12.160 --> 03:01:15.740]
Give him away because it would have been a lot easier than sitting here begging for calls for four hours

[03:01:16.400 --> 03:01:20.020]
Been pretty marginal at best and even on our pool today you notice boner Roy

[03:01:20.500 --> 03:01:24.380]
Even a pull result is a shadow of what it usually is you see that yep

[03:01:24.900 --> 03:01:27.340]
Very sad. Yeah, there's nobody out there

[03:01:27.340 --> 03:01:31.480]
There's nobody listening which means that either everybody is tuned out and or everybody's just left

[03:01:33.220 --> 03:01:36.920]
We noticed any lighter traffic lately just say yes pretend is wow

[03:01:37.440 --> 03:01:38.300]
Nobody around

[03:01:39.400 --> 03:01:44.900]
What's your take on you going back to 10 to 2 I'll listen whatever 107 I love it 100. It's okay 18

[03:01:44.900 --> 03:01:49.660]
I hate it 9 3.8% hated the prospect of us going back to 10 to 2

[03:01:49.660 --> 03:01:51.980]
I'll tell you one thing we've sure had a tremendous a

[03:01:53.320 --> 03:01:55.540]
euphoric response to that here on the phone today

[03:01:56.660 --> 03:01:57.820]
It's been spectacular

[03:01:59.500 --> 03:02:00.760]
Here's North Miami. Hello

[03:02:01.460 --> 03:02:07.820]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir. All right. You win. I called my buddy. I he'd been to Amsterdam three times. He told me

[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:12.320]
He concurred with you said about being filthy and it's really not worth it

[03:02:12.320 --> 03:02:18.220]
Let me ask you let me ask you this question. What what do I have to gain by telling you that the place sucks?

[03:02:19.200 --> 03:02:22.480]
Nothing at all. Hey, you used it used to be a great place

[03:02:22.480 --> 03:02:28.620]
But the fact that it matters in the last year especially it's gone downhill so badly and there are no tourists there anymore

[03:02:28.620 --> 03:02:35.840]
Only the locals who are very very obnoxious unfriendly nasty hostile people and I'm just trying to save you wasting time

[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:41.760]
That you can be spending and you're having a good time someplace else and you're absolutely right in I agree and that's why I called you back to

[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:43.980]
Listen to that but I wasn't trying to argue with you

[03:02:43.980 --> 03:02:49.320]
I hope I'm not still known as a punk if I call back. No, okay, sir. Thanks for coming back and

[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:54.460]
We're glad to have you have a great time try cologne Germany, man. I'm Tony. You love it

[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:58.040]
All right, sir, and if you got that much time you definitely want to do some Italy

[03:02:58.640 --> 03:03:03.040]
Yeah, well, I'm taking a leave of ass as I work for an airline instead of people laying off in our department

[03:03:03.040 --> 03:03:06.080]
We have people to take a leave and a bunch of us did up and did it so

[03:03:06.560 --> 03:03:12.300]
Roll and Florence man Roman Florence keeps an ad to yourself Roman Florence. Okay, sir. Have a great time, pal

[03:03:12.300 --> 03:03:15.780]
Thank you. Bye. I see ordinarily if somebody would call back a second time

[03:03:15.780 --> 03:03:20.820]
I'd get all surly and been out of shape, but he's you know he wasn't a punk number one and number two

[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:26.460]
Did some checking with somebody else he checked a second opinion and the other opinion said Neil is

[03:03:28.500 --> 03:03:30.020]
Got his thumb on it

[03:03:32.320 --> 03:03:37.320]
I mean I could understand if I was getting paid off by the Cologne Germany Chamber of Commerce or by you know

[03:03:37.320 --> 03:03:41.200]
They roll my chamber of commerce. I could understand that but nothing for me

[03:03:41.680 --> 03:03:46.240]
I'm not gonna get my heart earned money back that I just blew a thousand dollars on the plane trip and a

[03:03:46.680 --> 03:03:47.600]
Hotel and Amsterdam

[03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:51.360]
God, I wish I had to do it over in fact. You know what I'm gonna do what?

[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:55.800]
Just no just to prove that yeah as long as you're still breathing as long as there's life there's hope

[03:03:55.800 --> 03:03:58.680]
I think what I'll do is next week. I'll do my vacation over again and

[03:04:00.700 --> 03:04:04.240]
what and this time I'll do Cologne and Berlin and Rome and

[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.200]
Copenhagen's nice and then do it right this time. What do you say?

[03:04:08.120 --> 03:04:13.740]
Yeah, sure and then you can go on again give away those tickets and have I have a hell of a time in your new time slot

[03:04:13.740 --> 03:04:14.940]

[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:27.380]
Good things that this thought of you respond to next dead babies

[03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:33.660]
John's here in the taxi car. I said driver central park

[03:04:34.220 --> 03:04:38.640]
You look at me so quesitally I could tell he was in the dark

[03:04:39.300 --> 03:04:45.280]
So I acted out my puncture rate and with my arms the trees I made

[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:48.060]
No bunk speaks English anymore

[03:04:48.060 --> 03:04:56.420]
I went down to my young man beach weather was nice and sunny

[03:04:57.100 --> 03:05:01.620]
I walked into a liquor store, but a guy there talks real fun

[03:05:02.220 --> 03:05:05.100]
I asked him for a pint of Belgium Beemys'

[03:05:05.280 --> 03:05:07.420]
It's not the end of what doesn't mean

[03:05:08.340 --> 03:05:08.840]
English

[03:05:14.380 --> 03:05:14.880]
Deli

[03:05:14.880 --> 03:05:19.260]
Hell I think I've been Pakistan speaking with smelly

[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:21.920]
Or you can go back to my

[03:05:21.920 --> 03:05:22.920]
Raaah

[03:05:29.820 --> 03:05:33.140]
I came here many years ago

[03:05:34.160 --> 03:05:35.640]
Learned my ABCs

[03:05:36.560 --> 03:05:39.940]
I don't say much is grossiest I said pretty

[03:05:41.200 --> 03:05:46.660]
So get yourself to a classroom quicker in America now stop making me sick

[03:05:46.660 --> 03:05:48.520]
You know, but I should be English

[03:05:52.520 --> 03:05:55.740]
1242 at 560 WQM happy to Tuesday to you

[03:05:56.140 --> 03:05:59.960]
We're all gonna get on a big big 747 and go to Amsterdam, aren't we?

[03:06:00.080 --> 03:06:04.100]
No, we're not and Tonya even you wouldn't want to go there now

[03:06:04.740 --> 03:06:06.480]
Even a punk like you even a

[03:06:07.220 --> 03:06:12.520]
A wild wacky a weed puffer like you has got no interest in going around Tonya, okay? Although

[03:06:13.740 --> 03:06:18.500]
Even you well, I mean when you can get all you want from muffin a hallway. What do you want to go there for?

[03:06:19.060 --> 03:06:19.280]
muffin

[03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:23.740]
Here's Miami hello

[03:06:25.900 --> 03:06:30.240]
See now now he's lowered his voice a little bit or raise whatever he's done with it

[03:06:31.660 --> 03:06:33.860]
He's whispering in a on helium

[03:06:36.080 --> 03:06:40.960]
The whisperer is back on helium folks. What did he say? I didn't understand it worded it even though no we don't care

[03:06:41.520 --> 03:06:46.260]
You're an idiot sir. You're a moron. Okay. Talk to Stuttlery Steve. I don't know how he David had show

[03:06:46.260 --> 03:06:48.280]
Maybe the two you can have a great life together

[03:06:49.520 --> 03:06:59.340]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 it's just amazing. I mean the longer I do this the more to it's like a it's like a psychiatric study of the human race

[03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:08.260]
And you can just envision these people sitting there with their with their little phone for hours and hours waiting and waiting to get on for the three seconds

[03:07:08.260 --> 03:07:11.660]
And then waiting to squeeze themselves when they hear my response, you know

[03:07:12.680 --> 03:07:14.800]
This is the highlight of their existence

[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:25.400]
Here's Miami when it is hi Neil welcome back. Thank you so much and congratulations on the time change if that's actually gonna happen

[03:07:25.400 --> 03:07:27.940]
All right, yes, it is gonna happen. Oh fantastic

[03:07:28.680 --> 03:07:33.400]
And it won't that mean something like I with your book there if it sort of gets into a more prime

[03:07:33.920 --> 03:07:38.980]
Segment of the day. Well, I mean it's certainly a lot better for our ratings because no other shows started nine o'clock in the morning

[03:07:38.980 --> 03:07:44.640]
And it's like you know come trying to convince people to turn over to you while people are in the middle of listening to all the other morning shows

[03:07:44.640 --> 03:07:51.800]
And it you know, it just doesn't work all that great. It's gonna be much more beneficial all the way around in addition to which not having to get up at six o'clock in the morning

[03:07:51.800 --> 03:07:57.920]
Yeah, well that congratulations on that too. I was uh, you know driving around the extra last week and

[03:07:57.920 --> 03:08:01.300]
I normally listened to you have you tuned in on my car radio

[03:08:01.300 --> 03:08:05.460]
As a no offense to Georgia and I think but I was mainly listening to CD

[03:08:05.460 --> 03:08:13.080]
I know is but I checked back all over there every once in a while and I swear to god meal every time I punched the A.M. button on my car

[03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:17.580]
Serial I would come across either George or Carlos going

[03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:23.580]
Bup bup bup over Castro and Cuba and I had to keep checking my style liar. I had to keep

[03:08:23.580 --> 03:08:27.040]
Thanks for being Cuba. Yeah, I mean fake bag

[03:08:27.040 --> 03:08:30.640]
I don't think either of those words were said the whole week either one well

[03:08:30.640 --> 03:08:36.300]
I love to buy either one of us actually not at all Carlos yesterday you were going on about Castro before you're playing

[03:08:36.300 --> 03:08:42.800]
Ali on park it was pretty darn funny. He went, wait a minute. He was going on about Castro. Yep. Yeah, I took over the show

[03:08:42.800 --> 03:08:47.740]
I did a whole four hours. Let me tell you something. Get yourself some help. Okay, when you get your you know how many pills

[03:08:47.740 --> 03:08:53.920]
This guy did before we made the car. Well, unless unless this guy's just trying to be funny. That was one of the

[03:08:53.920 --> 03:09:01.320]
said Joe on one of the what one of the best at meal tapes had Joe on. Yeah, it was when Joe was being the producer. So maybe

[03:09:01.320 --> 03:09:07.460]
That's what that what he's talking about but no, he's a chronic. Uh, he's just the fabricating. Why are you trying to rationalize?

[03:09:07.500 --> 03:09:11.840]
You're getting sucked in now. Yeah, to a screamer out there. Obviously didn't get any over the holiday weekend

[03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:16.940]
And she's all bad out of shape because for whatever you know, he's got a guava problem

[03:09:17.540 --> 03:09:21.460]
Five as I do to his matter factor can't stand it stuff. Why do people eat guacamole?

[03:09:22.120 --> 03:09:28.640]
What is that? I don't know. It was like a guava. It begins with GUA

[03:09:30.120 --> 03:09:35.640]
Guacamole is not good. It looks like and it smells like baby poop and South of Mexico. They enjoy guacamole

[03:09:35.640 --> 03:09:36.140]
Hmm

[03:09:38.040 --> 03:09:43.020]
And after you if you spend a time there you do your squat remotely for a long time is what I'm hearing talk about hangers

[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:48.360]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty you know this today

[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:50.920]
I gotta be honest with you not that I care because I feel pretty good

[03:09:50.920 --> 03:09:56.540]
I'm real glad to be just out of Amsterdam. I feel my life, you know plus getting that thing out of my uh that I can't mention on the year out of my

[03:09:57.340 --> 03:10:00.520]
Huh? Yeah, that gigantic mattress that was sitting in my living room

[03:10:01.400 --> 03:10:05.120]
Hey fat boy, let me tell you something man. If the fat don't get your eye will

[03:10:05.120 --> 03:10:09.300]
I'm calling up Luca Brotzi right after the show today. We're gonna get a hit on fat boy

[03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:16.100]
Talk about a guy creating problems. Just just leave me alone. I'm doing just fine. Okay. I can afford my own bed

[03:10:16.100 --> 03:10:19.160]
I can afford my own goddamn meals. I'm doing just great

[03:10:20.500 --> 03:10:26.220]
Just leave me alone. We got rid of that PD Lenny. Yeah, so we got rid of that one now fat boys trying to move in on his territory

[03:10:26.980 --> 03:10:31.700]
And the same with Bob Eisenberg, okay? I'm not gonna be going to any of your stores anytime soon South Florida

[03:10:31.700 --> 03:10:36.960]
Because I happen to be 1200 miles away. Okay Bob. I know that's hard for you to figure out under that hair piece

[03:10:38.780 --> 03:10:42.460]
I think that people with the bad hair pieces. I think it affects their mind

[03:10:42.460 --> 03:10:45.440]
You know that could that could be the uh reason for mr. David

[03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:51.280]
Well the roots dig into your brain for the molemeister is that what it is? I didn't think most had any roots but the chia pet

[03:10:53.560 --> 03:10:57.960]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T in Horizon line. We're just killing some time here

[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:01.580]
And it's obvious from the results on the polls and the phone that we're killing it

[03:11:02.380 --> 03:11:08.700]
What's your take on you'll go back to 10 to 268 votes. I'll listen whatever 123. I love it 115

[03:11:08.700 --> 03:11:12.140]
It's okay 19 I hated 4% 11 people said I hated

[03:11:14.260 --> 03:11:15.980]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[03:11:15.980 --> 03:11:21.500]
Ah good afternoon. Yes sir. I guess I'm glad that you're back the reason I'm calling this

[03:11:21.500 --> 03:11:27.660]
That's not what River Jones that's River Jones. Yeah, you called 50 times last week. Get lost asshole. See if the track

[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:30.620]
You know

[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:31.740]
Here's Miami. Hello

[03:11:33.240 --> 03:11:34.720]
Miami. Yes sir

[03:11:35.680 --> 03:11:41.960]
Am I on it sounds like you yes. Oh okay. Hey, are you going back to 10 to do that perfect? Right

[03:11:42.700 --> 03:11:45.340]
But I hope they're not going to cut the mad dog short

[03:11:46.180 --> 03:11:52.040]
No, the mad dog is still going to have two hours good because you two are the only guys who are worth listening to on the radio

[03:11:52.040 --> 03:11:56.620]
The rest of them you know where they can go. I mean, I don't want to say the mad dog will be doing two to four

[03:11:56.620 --> 03:12:02.820]
But the mad dog will still have two hours so as long as he has two hours and then you're still on 10 to two

[03:12:02.820 --> 03:12:05.580]
Then everybody happy. All right

[03:12:05.580 --> 03:12:10.220]
That's it. That's all the material. I got have a great Daniel you two thanks a me go see there you go

[03:12:10.220 --> 03:12:14.000]
The guy that's happy already because I'm going to be doing 10 to two and he thinks the mad dog's going to be doing two to four

[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:15.160]
He's right and you know

[03:12:15.580 --> 03:12:19.540]
See I'm letting little pieces of it dribble off because they won't respond to us in any way

[03:12:19.540 --> 03:12:21.500]
And this is already the end of it is already Tuesday

[03:12:22.380 --> 03:12:23.840]
This is not the way you run a railroad

[03:12:25.180 --> 03:12:28.580]
Right what this is already the end of our show on Tuesday

[03:12:29.340 --> 03:12:32.420]
And if we're going to have like some dramatic changes here in the next

[03:12:33.160 --> 03:12:35.480]
imminent period of time then I think they're released

[03:12:35.480 --> 03:12:40.440]
They can remember the day that Greg and Duffer on a phone with and drop whatever you're doing right now and call them

[03:12:40.440 --> 03:12:44.860]
About something that was kaka. It was baby crap remember that right

[03:12:47.060 --> 03:12:50.560]
I don't even remember what the hell that was about stuff and nonsense

[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:55.760]
Yeah, stuff in nonsense like in the middle of interrupting the show like like somebody just got murdered in the building

[03:12:55.760 --> 03:12:57.560]
There was something like there was some major crisis

[03:12:59.040 --> 03:12:59.460]
Kaka

[03:13:00.040 --> 03:13:06.760]
Just like fat boy demanding that you call him and get on the phone in the middle of the show when you're doing the show last week over Kaka too much Kaka man

[03:13:08.920 --> 03:13:10.900]
Speaking of that hangover we were talking about

[03:13:13.640 --> 03:13:17.240]
Sports radio five six East U.A. Yeah

[03:13:18.640 --> 03:13:19.600]
Kaka

[03:13:20.200 --> 03:13:20.320]
Poo

[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:22.880]
Pissons what else what am I missing?

[03:13:25.240 --> 03:13:26.200]
Raccoon

[03:13:26.200 --> 03:13:33.080]
The night

[03:14:02.060 --> 03:14:03.340]
Good

[03:14:03.340 --> 03:14:03.420]
The mo

[03:14:03.420 --> 03:14:05.360]
My plan's got

[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:08.420]
She was the best

[03:14:08.420 --> 03:14:10.420]
I'm excited for my life

[03:14:12.140 --> 03:14:13.360]
Oh ho

[03:14:14.620 --> 03:14:17.480]
Here in the summer of 2003

[03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:20.420]
On the beach

[03:14:23.660 --> 03:14:26.200]
When it was beauty time

[03:14:26.200 --> 03:14:27.780]
I was young and right

[03:14:28.420 --> 03:14:30.140]
But my body was just a fine

[03:14:30.140 --> 03:14:32.700]
I get to work again

[03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:33.780]
Last forever

[03:14:34.740 --> 03:14:35.480]
Forever

[03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:35.600]
Forever

[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:36.840]
Yeah

[03:14:42.260 --> 03:14:44.920]
Here in the summer of 2003

[03:14:45.700 --> 03:14:46.760]
On the beach

[03:14:47.480 --> 03:14:48.280]
On the beach

[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:51.600]
In the summer of 2003

[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:52.620]
Okay

[03:14:55.280 --> 03:14:57.140]
1254-560 WDQA

[03:14:57.140 --> 03:14:58.700]
We're in the final stretch here

[03:14:58.700 --> 03:14:59.980]
And thank the Lord for that

[03:14:59.980 --> 03:15:00.780]
You know what, thank you

[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:08.340]
Thank you

[03:15:08.340 --> 03:15:08.560]
Thank you

[03:15:32.020 --> 03:15:33.420]
Of course some might conclude

[03:15:33.420 --> 03:15:34.640]
Instead that former Canadian

[03:15:34.640 --> 03:15:35.720]
Alliance leader stock well

[03:15:35.720 --> 03:15:37.200]
They is simply a more laughable figure

[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:38.680]
But that hardly seems fair

[03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:40.940]
It's true that day's waterside

[03:15:40.940 --> 03:15:42.660]
Press conference in 2000 was staged

[03:15:42.660 --> 03:15:43.860]
Managed and laughable

[03:15:43.860 --> 03:15:45.620]
Designed so that they could look vigorous

[03:15:45.620 --> 03:15:47.420]
And athletic as he zoomed up in a wet suit

[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:49.900]
But bushes fighter plane landed on the deck of

[03:15:49.900 --> 03:15:51.300]
U.S. battleship earlier this month

[03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:53.580]
And his emergence from the cockpit in combat gear

[03:15:53.580 --> 03:15:55.740]
And must up here was even more stage managed

[03:15:55.740 --> 03:15:57.940]
Right out of the soft-tone sunset lighting

[03:15:57.940 --> 03:15:59.780]
And the mission accomplished backdrop

[03:15:59.780 --> 03:16:01.760]
Signed perfectly angled for TV viewers

[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:04.520]
As for laughable it's hard to outdo bush

[03:16:04.520 --> 03:16:06.240]
Who went AWOL from the National Guard

[03:16:06.240 --> 03:16:07.300]
During the Vietnam War

[03:16:07.300 --> 03:16:09.400]
Streading around the ship and full battle regalia

[03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:10.380]
Carrying his own helmet

[03:16:10.380 --> 03:16:12.760]
I guess there wasn't anybody available to carry it for him

[03:16:13.380 --> 03:16:15.440]
While the Canadian media had a field-a-land

[03:16:15.440 --> 03:16:17.180]
Pudding stock well day at the American media

[03:16:17.180 --> 03:16:19.840]
Largely treated the bush photo up as a serious event

[03:16:19.840 --> 03:16:21.940]
If not a nation-building moment

[03:16:21.940 --> 03:16:23.660]
One had to seek out obscure websites

[03:16:23.660 --> 03:16:24.800]
To find questions like

[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:28.020]
Wasn't that a sock stuffed down the front of the president's combat pants?

[03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:31.480]
Only an administration supremely confident of the media's

[03:16:31.480 --> 03:16:33.840]
Dossility would have risked staging an event like that

[03:16:33.840 --> 03:16:36.180]
Leaving bush open to ridicule from any media outlet

[03:16:36.180 --> 03:16:38.440]
That saw its role as more than simply being a chronicler

[03:16:38.440 --> 03:16:39.820]
Of tales of fearless leaders

[03:16:41.000 --> 03:16:44.080]
This media-dossility is allowed the bush administration to go largely on

[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:46.380]
Challenges that adopts the mantle of an imperial presidency

[03:16:46.380 --> 03:16:48.160]
Some of the administration's most rabid

[03:16:48.160 --> 03:16:50.020]
Hoxie even come close to realizing their dream

[03:16:50.020 --> 03:16:52.180]
Implementing the ultra-a-ledist ideas

[03:16:52.180 --> 03:16:54.660]
And obscure political philosopher named Leo Strauss

[03:16:54.660 --> 03:16:56.160]
Remember we talked about him?

[03:16:56.680 --> 03:16:57.140]
Yeah

[03:16:57.140 --> 03:17:00.160]
There's been a buzz recently of reports that Strauss

[03:17:00.160 --> 03:17:02.280]
Who shaped the neo-conservative revolution from his post

[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:05.060]
At the University of Chicago is lionized by among others

[03:17:05.060 --> 03:17:07.020]
Deputies of Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz

[03:17:07.020 --> 03:17:10.380]
Wibley-Sin is the architect of Washington's post-9-11 strategy

[03:17:10.380 --> 03:17:14.080]
Media counts that folks on Strauss' advocacy of strong leadership

[03:17:14.080 --> 03:17:17.140]
Devoting less attention to his anti-democratic leanings

[03:17:17.140 --> 03:17:19.920]
Central of the Straussian vision is a docile citizenry

[03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:24.040]
kept uninformed and easy to manipulate through a perpetual fear of external attack

[03:17:24.040 --> 03:17:26.880]
Deception of the citizens by those in power is critical

[03:17:26.880 --> 03:17:29.160]
Explained Shadea Dury, a University of Calgary

[03:17:29.160 --> 03:17:32.440]
Political scientist and author of Leo Strauss and the American right

[03:17:33.340 --> 03:17:36.320]
Accordingly, a terrified American public was kept out of the mistaken illusion

[03:17:36.320 --> 03:17:38.300]
That Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction

[03:17:38.300 --> 03:17:41.040]
And would soon strike America if America didn't strike first

[03:17:41.040 --> 03:17:44.240]
Clearly a vigorous questioning American media could show a spanner

[03:17:44.240 --> 03:17:46.320]
Into the best laid plans of the White House Straussians

[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:48.460]
Or Leo cons, is there sometimes fault

[03:17:48.460 --> 03:17:50.500]
But there seems to be a little chance of that these days

[03:17:50.500 --> 03:17:55.880]
Rather anyone questioning the commander in chief or his policies is promptly dist by hostile bush supporters

[03:17:55.880 --> 03:18:00.800]
Who display a virulent anti-democratic contempt for public debate or even often civilized discourse

[03:18:00.800 --> 03:18:03.700]
So for instance, Fox News host Bill O'Reilly-Less

[03:18:03.700 --> 03:18:07.480]
February interviewed an anti-war activist whose father was killed in the 9-11 attacks

[03:18:07.480 --> 03:18:10.980]
One might have thought that losing a father in that American tragedy would have at least

[03:18:10.980 --> 03:18:14.700]
In the activist's respectful hearing on an American interview program, wrong

[03:18:14.700 --> 03:18:17.320]
O'Reilly never let up his verbal abuse during the interview

[03:18:17.320 --> 03:18:21.880]
And afterwards promptly told the activists to get out of my studio before I tear you to effing pieces

[03:18:22.380 --> 03:18:26.920]
Or as Chris Hill, business development vice president for Showtime Digital Media in California wrote me

[03:18:26.920 --> 03:18:33.080]
After a recent column questioning US actions in Iraq, please do us all a favor and take a long walk off a short pier

[03:18:33.080 --> 03:18:37.980]
You spineless leftist Canadian expletive for female geneteria as in, see you next time

[03:18:37.980 --> 03:18:41.740]
In a less coarsely awarded attempt to shut down public debate

[03:18:41.740 --> 03:18:45.060]
Historian Michael Bliss vehemently announced the star's Michelle Landsberg

[03:18:45.060 --> 03:18:50.380]
For even posing questions in her column that normally any curious person let alone a historian will want answered like

[03:18:50.380 --> 03:18:56.500]
How come the world's best military was unable to do anything about a hijacked airplanes flying over its territory for more than an hour on 9-11

[03:18:57.260 --> 03:19:04.360]
Some people seem to be hoping will all feel too cow to ask any questions other than how the president managed to look so rugged and handsome in his uniform

[03:19:04.360 --> 03:19:05.720]
How does he do it?

[03:19:06.560 --> 03:19:10.280]
Right slanted McQuagans Sundays Toronto star

[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:15.480]
Bill Kring I beg your pardon I'm just guessing Bill Kring is that how he does it little dabble doing

[03:19:15.480 --> 03:19:19.660]
I wonder how many dabs he's got to put on that probably

[03:19:20.660 --> 03:19:25.580]
Now you notice today we didn't finish the show with that weapons of mass destruction thing as I think we need to move on

[03:19:26.120 --> 03:19:30.140]
Okay I don't mean move on never played again but just not like at the end we don't want to be too predictable

[03:19:30.140 --> 03:19:34.720]
You know we don't want to be too predictable although we are going back to 10 to 2

[03:19:34.720 --> 03:19:40.940]
And the response has been spectacular from the audience today hasn't it? It's been unbelievable there's been an uppouring of emotion

[03:19:40.940 --> 03:19:47.840]
The television networks the newspapers the hero the Sun sentinel city link what's the other one old times

[03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:50.480]
That's it man

[03:19:52.100 --> 03:19:53.160]
That's it man

[03:19:53.160 --> 03:19:57.500]
Yeah all lined up at the door just waiting to read about the great changes coming to QAM

[03:19:57.500 --> 03:20:03.660]
So what's the story did we find to get the the blowdown? No we get the green light no red light no light

[03:20:03.660 --> 03:20:09.940]
Orange alert from the programming department look out keep your radio under your bed orange alert is out

[03:20:09.940 --> 03:20:16.540]
Here's our poll so far any phenomenal response 305 votes Boehner boy aren't you impressed by that? Oh boy

[03:20:19.260 --> 03:20:21.740]
How many listeners did George leave us you think?

[03:20:21.860 --> 03:20:22.640]
Got third man

[03:20:22.640 --> 03:20:29.480]
What's your take on you going back to 10 to 2 it's just the yet time of the year man I'll listen whatever 139 we like them a lot

[03:20:29.480 --> 03:20:35.840]
I love it 133 it's okay 21 I hate it 12 people it's less than 4% you know what?

[03:20:36.560 --> 03:20:39.900]
Yeah and we have only one thing to say about going back to 10 to 1 word

[03:20:39.900 --> 03:20:42.020]
All right bye bye bye

[03:20:42.980 --> 03:20:44.560]
Yeah and how about one more word
