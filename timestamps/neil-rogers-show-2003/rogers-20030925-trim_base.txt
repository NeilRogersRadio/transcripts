[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980]
Are you ready for Neil now?

[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.140]
No.

[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.780]
Hey Neil!

[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:03.380]
Yep!

[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.360]
How are you buddy?

[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:05.000]
Great!

[00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.980]
Never better man!

[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.060]
Are you serious that it hasn't gotten chilly up there yet?

[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.940]
It's like about this 65, 68's perfect man.

[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.340]
Oh!

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.680]
I love it there man!

[00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.840]
Sonny it's sensational!

[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.300]
I love it there, that place!

[00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.220]
And don't be picking on my good buddy Mo now.

[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.380]
Mo was smoking a big fat one around the building this morning.

[00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.340]
Yeah Mo loves to smoke big D.

[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.320]
He had the big D.

[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.760]
He had the bahia going this morning.

[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:28.580]
Reminding him of you.

[00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.340]
Duff got so mad that he went out this morning about new tennis shoes.

[00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.600]
Was he crying again Duff?

[00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.600]
I heard that he cried.

[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.660]

[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.440]
He was a big clown, he was in a fog.

[00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.320]
Clarence is out of town for two days with another job interview and Duff's running around here like Sid Caesar.

[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.180]
Certainly Mo is sucking up with us now.

[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.820]
He's like trying to jump on a bandwagon.

[00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.720]
He wants in.

[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.600]
But it's simple.

[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.980]
I mean on the outside looking in like a little kid is looking in an orgy and he wants to be let in.

[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.620]
You know he's pounding on a window he wants in.

[00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.840]
It's your station I just rent space and now that he sees how freaking cool I am.

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.840]
Or he or clown.

[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.700]
Who are you kidding?

[00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.960]
I'm John Wayne Gacy.

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.060]
He's my favorite clown.

[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.420]
And also the one thing I do want to rip Mo and ask for and deserve a little so because you told me that he was defending Dave Van Boring.

[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.760]
Yeah.

[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.520]
Why not?

[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.100]
Yesterday we had 80,000 votes and nobody even called in and mentioned Dave Van Boring and suggested he be on the pool.

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.000]
So what does that tell you?

[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.400]
He is terminal man.

[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.020]
He's awful.

[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.760]
You know the other night they had the traveling secretary doing it because Booog had diarrhea for 24 hours.

[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.340]
Did he really?

[00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.100]
Yeah we have footage.

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.360]
This footage.

[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.140]
No listen to this.

[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.500]
We got actual footage from his house.

[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.780]
You have him having just a 24 hour like strain.

[00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:34.660]
Here we go.

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.660]
Listen.

[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.200]
That's about right there.

[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.640]
I think that's Dave Van Boring right there.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.600]
Now listen to this.

[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.360]
Neil I'm having a party tonight at Gate G for tomorrow's game and we're having listen to this.

[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.080]
They've never done this before but we're having a beer bar, a liquor bar and the Marlin Girls and a lucky winner is going to ride around in the Marlin.

[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.500]
Billy the boat with the Marlin Girl.

[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:09.280]
And we're going to try to goo some Marlin Girl and then we're going to paint people's faces blue and I decided I asked Howard if he'd come and we were going to paint a sphincter blue.

[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.100]
Yeah we're going to spray paint.

[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.040]
No need a lot of paint.

[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800]
Listen we're going to have a couple extra cans.

[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.100]
I got a couple extra cans.

[00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.400]
I got Channel 10 coming in Fox Sports net and I'll be on the game of the week with Joe Buck this week on Saturday.

[00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520]
He can watch me from Toronto to see how tan I am.

[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.420]
No I won't be watching.

[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.300]
I will neither.

[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.340]
But have a great time.

[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.020]
So I'll tell you one thing right now.

[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.680]
Here's the challenge.

[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.980]
We had 25,000 on Tuesday.

[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.860]
It was pretty lame.

[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.160]
28,000 plus last night.

[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.040]
Still pretty weak.

[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.840]
You got to get 30 man.

[00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.300]
Yes you ain't cutting that.

[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.100]
If I don't get 30.

[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.460]
If I don't get 30, I'm the peer.

[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220]
We can't answer the mums up on a wild card.

[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.800]
They wind it out and they can clinch at least a tie and they can't even get 30,000 in that joint.

[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.700]
Even when I give away 20,000 tickets.

[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.540]
They suck.

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.660]
The fans are suck.

[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.740]
I told you that.

[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.600]
No one goes.

[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.160]
I thought I was being a sour push man.

[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.620]
It's the truth.

[00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.520]
Did you push lead down?

[00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.900]
Did you know that we actually put cardboard cutouts of fans in the outfield seats just to make it look like there's people there?

[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:03.740]
I know that to make it look good.

[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.440]
Yeah it works.

[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.160]
We have one of Jim Manage stealing a case behind again from a liquor store.

[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.580]
What did you say about Dave Ann Boyne?

[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.400]
He does have a hot wife.

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.160]
Oh I heard he has a hot wife.

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.920]
But I was listening to the game last night when they were up sick.

[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.100]
Nothing.

[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.400]
I veered off the road.

[00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.260]
I mean the guy, listen.

[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.560]
I don't know him from Adam.

[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.260]
I love Luke.

[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.700]
I don't care about David.

[00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:23.160]
Never mind him.

[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.000]
I hear he's got a much worse hair piece than even Moe.

[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.540]
Like you're right.

[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.440]
He's mellow dude.

[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.920]
His call to the game is like, God damn, I'd rather go to a funeral.

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.660]
Yeah.

[00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.780]
I mean what kind of a home run call is that?

[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.760]
And you're right about landing.

[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.900]
You're right about landing.

[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.340]
You're boring.

[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.120]
Landing for Terry.

[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.560]
He's been doing it for 25 years and he still sucks.

[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.120]
Terrible.

[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.960]
He's a nice guy where I hate when he comes on the air.

[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.840]
Bob Prince is rolling over his grave and he's poking Rosie Roosevelt in the butt and saying,

[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840]
can you believe this?

[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:46.480]
How about him?

[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.820]
Every time he comes on the air he goes, hi friend, I'm not your friend.

[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.420]
Yeah, landing freaking for Terry.

[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.980]
Yeah, well he puts right in with the whole ambiance of the pirates anyway.

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.280]
Then, we're still he's the best.

[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.440]
My vote for best board skaters is say.

[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560]
Uh, then, Scully man.

[00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.740]
Oh my God.

[00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.340]
But you even.

[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.880]
How could you even say that?

[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.520]
Boring.

[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.240]
You're crazy.

[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.900]
And you're the other five.

[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.240]
My 35 and the 70 of the age is on the other side.

[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.340]
Perfect game.

[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.880]
Hi.

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.420]
Hi, guys.

[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.820]
You're a beautiful badger.

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.280]
Stony.

[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.640]
I remember Luke Snyder back in 60.

[00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.580]
You could look mellow.

[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.160]
How about that?

[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.960]
My favorite guy is Mike Lang, the penguins in house.

[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.780]
Yeah, I have a good buddy, Mike Lang.

[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.240]
I love him.

[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.360]
Jesus, what is that?

[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.820]
The A.C.

[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.920]
Fort Connelly, just the fucking relief.

[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.640]
I love him.

[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.640]
Amber left the goal.

[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.580]
All right, now I got one for you.

[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.080]
Play for us.

[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.080]
You ready to go.

[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.600]
And let me just tell you how high he is.

[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.040]
He starts.

[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.800]
Will you listen to me?

[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.840]
Yeah, here's mine for you.

[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.200]
Listen.

[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.120]
Here's the point dating him.

[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.300]
13 seconds left.

[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.380]
The point meeting cross eyes.

[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.880]
It's a shot.

[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.620]
I want to say.

[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.200]
I'm a genius.

[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.080]
I'm a genius.

[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.760]
I'm a genius.

[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.080]
I'm a genius.

[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.340]
I'm a genius.

[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.680]
He's been good.

[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.120]
He is a winner.

[00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.700]
He is a winner.

[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.360]
The thrasers get it.

[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.400]
Anyway, I'm going to vote.

[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.400]
Anyway, the only thing I'm going to vote is.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.940]
The hockey season starts that you understand that there is nobody in South Florida,

[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.500]
even understand.

[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.440]
They would know a puck from your ass, man.

[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.680]
They have no clue what it's all about.

[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.480]
I know that.

[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.580]
I believe that I can't.

[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.620]
Bullen got two votes and Bill and he would go to the...

[00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.040]
They don't know hockey from crackdown.

[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.920]
I did it in Georgia.

[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.220]
You talk about redness.

[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.860]
Yeah.

[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.800]
They're the worst.

[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.800]
They got a nice team.

[00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.900]
They got to hold the team.

[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.940]

[00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.520]
That's all that matters.

[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.900]
Coval Chuck and Healy, they're good.

[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.520]
Yeah.

[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.820]
No one's going to be making fun of them in the next three years.

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.720]
Coval Chook.

[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.540]
Yeah, whatever.

[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.060]
He's the final one left off to pull on.

[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.360]
I bet you don't even know who he is.

[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.960]
Jack Quillen.

[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.220]
I better remember Jack Quillen.

[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.740]
Jack Quillen, the great Cubs in South Florida, got run over by a car.

[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.320]
I got hit and got killed.

[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.200]
I remember Jack Brickhouse.

[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.020]
You know who's on that?

[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.140]
You know who's back in rehab.

[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:40.080]
He was even worse than Vin Scully.

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.900]
Jack Brickhouse was a cornpone yaw.

[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.640]
Hey, there goes another one over there.

[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.520]
Hey, you know who's back in rehab.

[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.360]
Jack Quillen was maybe the best that comes in South Florida even better than Healy.

[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.900]
He was phenomenal.

[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.020]
You know who's in rehab?

[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.980]
Who's that?

[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.240]
Darren McCarty again.

[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.640]
Who cares?

[00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.100]
People that like to drink booze that want to see people suffer.

[00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.540]
Why are we here about Darren McCarty?

[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.640]
I'm just kidding, man.

[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.260]
Nobody cares about talking about hockey.

[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.980]
You and me.

[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.280]
Can I talk about some nice stuff, Rick?

[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.580]
The best interest in suffer than hockey is harness racing.

[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.440]
Oh my God.

[00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.580]
That's so I wouldn't leave my harness from Elden Harner from the Black Cross from Alterross.

[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:15.360]
I used to go to the harness racing at the metal lands when I wanted to quit my nails.

[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.940]
Yeah.

[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.360]
How do you guys know his Jackie moment?

[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.760]
All I know is horse racing.

[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.800]
I love horse racing but harness racing blows.

[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.460]
Oh Jesus, have a great day Scott.

[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:26.100]
Say goodbye.

[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.840]
Go ahead.

[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.360]
Schmuck.

[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.560]
We're bonded with more.

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.920]
Are we here?

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.680]
Oh yeah.

[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.580]
He was done so I can turn now.

[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.120]
When the mortician lifted up my skirt, he said,

[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.720]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know.

[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.500]
He didn't do anything to lie down.

[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.120]
I get down, I don't know.

[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.780]
He said, I don't know.

[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.580]
He said, I don't know.

[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.200]
They're back.

[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.120]
Your favorite Jewish rock and roll nostalgia band.

[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.160]
It's Russia, Shen and I with their greatest hits album,

[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.580]
Sack Hop of the Synagogue.

[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.880]
My rubber jacket's going to superstition baby.

[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.020]
My rubber, my rubber.

[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.040]
Yes, Russia, Shen and I is reformed to bring you 12 kosher

[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.320]
guys of Hop and Hebrew Higgets.

[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.780]
That guy is in good for Jews.

[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.780]
This album should be in every orthodox rockers collection.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.920]
Rolling Stone gives it five stars of David.

[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:27.300]
It I wonder wonder wonder who wrote the book of Job.

[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.540]
Sack Hop of the Synagogue, new for Russia, Shen and I,

[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.040]
available in all record stores.

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.500]
We'll talk twice when you get here.

[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.360]
Go pass over this album.

[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.140]
Then I waited five, 60 WQM Happy Thursday to it.

[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.100]
We're bonding with Mo.

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.680]
I never thought it could possibly have.

[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.360]
No, it could have not.

[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.320]
I leave you are anyway.

[00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:49.280]
George, every day George, he's got another story about.

[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.460]
He and Mo were like taking a cramp together on the same bowl.

[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.900]
No less.

[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.520]
Well, he was washing and I was washing it.

[00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.860]
We were chatting, I was chatting.

[00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:00.040]
Mo was smoking a big fat one this morning, which evidently indicates that he's really

[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.000]
mellowing out and then muff came in and she was crying.

[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.280]
Oh, I made him put it out.

[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.080]
He's smoking his ears.

[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.960]
No smoking in here.

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.360]
Duff, you're such a pussy man.

[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:07.480]
It's just it's embarrassing.

[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480]
You're such a little girl.

[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.920]
It's just it's awful.

[00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:13.580]
A little freaking girl who cries all over the place terrible.

[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:15.660]
What's wrong with it?

[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.900]
This non-smoking thing, man.

[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.940]
If you can't smoke a big fat one while you're working, what kind of a world is it anyway?

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:20.840]
It's not even worth being alive.

[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.280]
No.

[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.180]
That he's even more one?

[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.240]
No, no, he didn't.

[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:24.660]
Well, why not?

[00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.340]
I didn't ask.

[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.900]
Hey, Mo, what you shouldn't have to ask, I think it's part of the bonding if he really

[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.960]
serious about this, about mending his fences and making up for you trying to get your

[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.340]
ass fired and screwing with my show.

[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.540]
I think the least he can do is give you a big fat one.

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.360]
No question.

[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.280]
Anyway, I got a fact from Bill.

[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.100]
I'm not sure if this is the bill that hates you or a different bill, but anyway it says,

[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:48.920]
no, it's not because it says George this morning, 6.24 a.m., Howard was rambling about yesterday's

[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.960]
sportscaster, Paul, which means he must be listening.

[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.660]
How you doing, Mo?

[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.900]
My good, close personal friend.

[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:53.680]
I'm listening.

[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.500]
And saying how Neil began to actually say something nice about him, blah, blah, blah.

[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.880]
Anyway, he says his cleanest can be Neil.

[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.800]
It's me, Mo.

[00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.060]
Absolutely.

[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.820]
I don't even know what that means, but it's not otherwise I'm supposed to be saying nasty

[00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:07.980]
things about him because it's Mo.

[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.460]
Is that it?

[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:09.600]
I guess.

[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.540]
Well, that's amazing.

[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.860]
I think there's a possibility that maybe we'll hear from the audience over the thing

[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:21.020]
because the chance for a grandfather and child reunion since he is old enough to be my

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.400]
grandpa.

[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.500]
I should play that on my own grand.

[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.840]
Ah, just to piss everybody off.

[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.560]
Let me know when.

[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.800]
Okay, secondly, I'll go take a nap.

[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.780]
How that will come out now.

[00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.540]
Let's see, favorite sportscaster of all time.

[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.940]
And this to me, I was saying before to show you, even though you don't really care about it,

[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.300]
but it really is like a, it's a microcosm of part of what's wrong with South Florida,

[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.620]
lack of cultural interest.

[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.340]
I mean, sports obviously to a lot of us isn't that important.

[00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.380]
It's relatively important.

[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.300]
Some of us like it.

[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:46.180]
Some of us hate it.

[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:50.340]
But it's just an example of the narrowness of South Florida.

[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.780]
All they know is freebies and early bird dinners.

[00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.740]
That's all they know.

[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.480]
Nothing else.

[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.280]
And the communist, the communist, you know, that crap.

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:57.780]
That's it.

[00:09:57.820 --> 00:09:58.560]
That's all it is.

[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.360]
That's why it's such a, it's a social cesspool, man.

[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.220]
It's a cultural septic tank.

[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.020]
That's the problem.

[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.960]
Do a poll on the greatest sportscaster of all time.

[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.780]
And like, you know, they're really great announcer.

[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.760]
I'm not saying that, you know, mad dog won't hands down and they love him.

[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:15.280]
That's fine.

[00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:17.140]
Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time?

[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.420]
Not necessarily the best.

[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.020]
Who's your favorite?

[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:19.620]
Right.

[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.140]
Jim Mandage 216.

[00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.480]
All right.

[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:24.720]
Nobody even close.

[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.240]
I hate sports.

[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.120]
160, 12.9%.

[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.260]
This is out of 1232.

[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.880]
Howard Cosell, 122.

[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:34.660]
And then it's way down.

[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:37.920]
Aren't you surprised in the drop off?

[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:39.540]
What?

[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:39.880]
Me?

[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:40.960]
Yeah.

[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:41.560]
Oh, no.

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.060]
I would have thought it would have been this one or that one.

[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.260]
Yeah.

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.840]
Like, you don't know Harry Carey?

[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:47.760]
Yeah, no, Harry Carey.

[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.040]
But I don't know who's the favorite among these people.

[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.300]
Well, Harry Carey's only got 62.

[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.000]
That really is fast, my ass a little bit.

[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:58.080]
John Madden 49, Mel Allen 43.

[00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.880]
I mean, see, right there.

[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:00.620]
It goes to Shura.

[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:04.960]
John Madden only because he's been on the football games for like a hundred years now.

[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:05.820]
I like Madden.

[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.340]
Don't get me wrong.

[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.120]
I think he's a hoot.

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:07.480]
He's fun.

[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.680]
But I mean to put him ahead of Mel Allen.

[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.800]
And again, it's an age thing because we just don't have as many old parts.

[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.060]
A lot of them did a terrible thing.

[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:14.820]
They went and died.

[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.060]
Kirk Gaudy 41.

[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.640]
L. Michaels 40.

[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.740]
Now, that's pretty interesting.

[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.360]
Hank probably won't be too happy about that.

[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.140]
Hey, stop it.

[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.820]
Because his good close personal buddy, L. Michaels only got 40.

[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.480]
Hank thinks L. Michaels is the cat's meal.

[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.100]
I think he's like one of those people.

[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.580]
He's like Dick Enberg over exposed, man.

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.600]
He tried it at L. Michaels.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.460]
You know what I mean?

[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.100]
Hmm?

[00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.340]
And I thought already, I mean, he's better than Dick Enberg.

[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.600]
But he's just too much.

[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.240]
Too much of a good thing is too much.

[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.900]
Keith Jackson 37 went on your late.

[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.320]
We apologize to Scott.

[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.820]
He's very upset that his good buddy, a hairy callister, make it on her.

[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]
It's a good thing he would have gotten no votes.

[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.380]
He sucks.

[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.680]
Bob Prince 32.

[00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:49.940]
The great Bob Prince.

[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.440]
Certainly the best baseball broadcaster in history by far.

[00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.140]
Rick Weaver 31.

[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:55.280]
Missed their Weaver.

[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:56.180]
We miss him badly.

[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:57.480]
And those white hankies.

[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.300]
Vince Scully 29.

[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.680]
I can't believe he's the best of all time.

[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:03.320]
Man, Scott.

[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.140]
And he plays his own tape on a hockey with a trasher thing there.

[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.700]
Do you notice how Scott is a little bit full of himself?

[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.180]
Will there be like an exaggeration?

[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:11.700]
No.

[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:12.780]
He's full of it.

[00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.900]
We let Scott for a while, but he's full of himself.

[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.720]
Moe Howard David had 28 right on Vince Scully's ass.

[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.740]
Not a bad job, Moe.

[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.980]
My good post-personal buddy, Moe.

[00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:22.120]
Right.

[00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.280]
Red Barber 27.

[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.600]
Marv Albert 26.

[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:28.400]
He that'll make Moe's day the fact he etched out Marv Albert by a pair

[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:29.480]
because he hates him like poison.

[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:32.540]
I better do the break then we can waste some more good time with the results yesterday's pool.

[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.720]
And then we got two polls today.

[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.120]
Let's put the first one up here because I printed this thing out already.

[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.680]
Yesterday we did Ted Kennedy beat out Bush Handley.

[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.120]
I got the ass still save an ad.

[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:42.040]
I'll save these every day.

[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.660]
If we had the election for president today and these were the choices who would you vote for.

[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.320]
General Wesley Clark, George W. Bush or I wouldn't vote.

[00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:52.720]
Let's get that up there right away so that when we come back there after the break,

[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.360]
it's up there when we got votes on it and they're like a hoppin' on it.

[00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:57.600]
Because later on we got...

[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.880]
What I think is kind of a fun pool.

[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.520]
We've done similar one before, but not quite exactly the same.

[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.160]
What's your biggest roast out?

[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:07.920]
I think I was inspired by the conversation we ate yesterday about people with red hair.

[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.880]
And that's bad.

[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.660]
I shouldn't have that feeling, but it's just...

[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.680]
You can't help it, you know?

[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.800]
It's like what's the right thing to be like.

[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.120]
You can't control that.

[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.300]
These things happen.

[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.140]
If we had the election for president today, these were the choices who you vote for.

[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.740]
General Wesley Clark, George W. Bush or I wouldn't vote.

[00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.200]
That's it.

[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:24.860]
Hop on it.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.280]
10.13 at QAM.

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.200]
A Tension Audio Mortgage Shoppers out there.

[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.340]
The following message could save you a Schmidt load of cash.

[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.980]
Tens of thousands of dollars.

[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.300]
Interest rates for home loans are shooting up dramatically,

[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.840]
but they're still an interest rate available.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.780]
It's just 1.95%.

[00:13:38.780 --> 00:13:44.420]
That's right, just 1.95% from financial group, called 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.080]
It's true. The economy's changing.

[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.020]
So if you even think about refinancing your home,

[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.240]
or if you want to move up to a better real estate investment,

[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.280]
this is what you ought to be doing,

[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.300]
is making that phone call today to financial group at 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:57.580]
Listen to the kind of low payments you have, you'll have to make,

[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.740]
at this kind of a 1.95% rate.

[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:03.080]
If you have yourself 100,000 dollar loan, your payments are only 8th,

[00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:04.800]
mere 368 bucks a month.

[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.500]
If you have a 200,000 dollar loan, your pay only 736 a month.

[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.080]
So call financial group today and get you the low 1.95% interest rate

[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.120]
that you've been praying and hoping and dreaming about.

[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.300]
1-800-940-Lend.

[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.240]
That's 1-800-940-Lend.

[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:20.700]
Either an equal housing lender,

[00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.000]
credit restrictions apply rates up to the change monthly, 5.19 APR.

[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:31.420]
My, and local, this is 4256-E-Way-In-Way-In-Way-In.

[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.580]
This is the most disgusting program.

[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:39.120]
I urge everyone to complain to this station.

[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.520]
She's a perfect man to you,

[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.320]
who likes to flash her pants in you,

[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.760]
when she don't have those on you.

[00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.400]
She's hanging like the straw me on right,

[00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.460]
and call those rancid snaps,

[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.280]
and call those rancid snaps.

[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.660]
Imagine what you can catch,

[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.700]
from in call those slaps.

[00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:18.860]
You're gonna be upon you,

[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.240]
scratches with a brush,

[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.280]
you banged her out though,

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.520]
and Hilmar but you'll never get drugged

[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.220]
and call those rancid snaps,

[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.480]
and call those rancid snaps,

[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.440]
a swirling pool of crap,

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.600]
and call those rancid snaps.

[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.620]
Using fuzzy voice,

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.840]
you're making out her voice there,

[00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.520]
walking with a gildo,

[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.220]
firmly cammed inside of her butt,

[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:02.140]
and call those rancid snaps,

[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.540]
and call those rancid snaps.

[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:09.520]
You want to know what it could match,

[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.620]
red, culture, snack.

[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:14.540]
By the way, I think the audience,

[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.120]
you know that mufflin's is very concerned

[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.900]
about ancholters,

[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:18.760]
whatever it is.

[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.860]
10, 19, 40 votes,

[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:24.160]
I'll draw you a picture of what it is.

[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.860]
I don't want to hear about it.

[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.200]
If we had the election for president today,

[00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.940]
who'd you vote for,

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.460]
General Wesley Clark,

[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.520]
out of the first 40 votes,

[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.300]
has got 27, 67.5%.

[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.520]
I wouldn't vote eight,

[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.060]
and George W. Bush only five,

[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.860]
12.5%.

[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.720]
Now Ted Kennedy, on the other hand,

[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.620]
had a tougher battle on his hand,

[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.220]
more isn't close.

[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.840]
Ted Kennedy had 52.3%,

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.620]
George W. 23.2%,

[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.640]
and 24.4% said they wouldn't vote yesterday.

[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:49.940]
But today, so far,

[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.180]
General Wesley Clark is like often running, baby.

[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.580]
Anyone getting back to the poll result,

[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:56.880]
or should we take that call on six

[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:58.260]
and see which chronic it is?

[00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:58.600]
You think?

[00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.540]
Whatever.

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.520]
Here's Pepper Pines on the famous line six.

[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:02.760]
Hello.

[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:05.400]
QAM.

[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:06.560]
Hello.

[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.280]
Hola.

[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.060]
Hello.

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.580]
Can't hear him.

[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.880]
Maybe the pot isn't even open, Scott.

[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.560]
Is that possible?

[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:14.820]
Because I can barely hear this call.

[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:15.720]
It's open.

[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:16.940]
Are you hearing him?

[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:17.160]
Sure.

[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:19.920]
I can't hear him.

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.420]
Well, he's not saying anything right now.

[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.940]
No, he is saying something.

[00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:24.320]
I can hear him.

[00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.840]
Like he's 100,000 miles away.

[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:26.740]
Like he's on Uranus.

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:27.140]
I don't know.

[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:27.860]
That was his answer.

[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.580]
Well, let me just see something here.

[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.780]
Let's see how low that is.

[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.060]
What are you doing with me, Scott?

[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.360]
What are you doing to me?

[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.440]

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.240]
Jesus, Scott, all mighty.

[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.180]
This Scott Jr., I think it's sabotage.

[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:40.980]
I was working.

[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.000]
I think Pharrell, what was working?

[00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:44.140]
Everything.

[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.620]
And my right wasn't he sounded like he was about a million miles away?

[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.000]
No.

[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.500]
No.

[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.460]
You could hear when he was saying?

[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:50.800]
Sure.

[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.780]
He was like, well, I couldn't.

[00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:54.240]
So you've got something picked up there again, Mr. Hot Shot.

[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.760]
Mr. Scott Jr., Mr. I want to get paid.

[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.480]
Even though I haven't got a freaking clue what I'm doing here.

[00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.380]
I couldn't hear him.

[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:00.780]
And there's nothing wrong on this end.

[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:02.980]
Believe you me when I tell you.

[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.900]
Let's get an experimental call here.

[00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:05.160]
Come on.

[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.440]
Somebody call in so we can see what Scott's got screwed up today.

[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.120]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.060]
Before I get the rest of this poll here.

[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.640]
Pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:15.060]
Get somebody on the horn.

[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:19.200]
Just for an experimental call to see what kind of technical disaster we have hatched here today.

[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:19.540]
There you go.

[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.080]
Line 6.

[00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:20.980]
WQAM.

[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:23.880]
See, I can't hear him.

[00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.440]
I can't hear anything.

[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.320]
Not saying anything.

[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.400]
QAM.

[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:28.660]
Ola.

[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:30.720]
WQAM.

[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:30.940]
Hello.

[00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:32.880]
Dana Beach.

[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:34.280]
What is it?

[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:35.200]
Dana Beach.

[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.300]
Dana Beach.

[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.080]
Yeah, but it's so the level is so freaking low on here.

[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:39.780]
What are you doing?

[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:41.060]
What is going on here today?

[00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.700]
I guess something seriously.

[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:47.780]
Any similarity between a radio station and QAM is purely coincidental.

[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.000]
See, Moe is finally caught on.

[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.340]
I told you this before the show day.

[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.300]
He's finally grabbed his big heart on for us and he realizes that the problem is not

[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.280]
there is management and the engineering and sales all not necessarily in that order.

[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:00.740]
That's the problem.

[00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.200]
The establishment of QAM.

[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.880]
Not us.

[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.580]
We're not the enemy.

[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.100]
They're the impediment to our success.

[00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.620]
It's got to be one of the great miracles in the history of mankind.

[00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:11.260]
This station does it as well as it does.

[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.400]
Let me just try a couple of more.

[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.900]
Believe me, there's nothing on this end.

[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.260]
Any different from what it always is.

[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:18.000]
WQAM.

[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.240]
Hello.

[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:20.600]
QAM.

[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.120]
See, they're dicking with you on purpose now.

[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:23.880]
WQAM.

[00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.320]
WQAM.

[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:26.540]
Hello.

[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:28.120]
Yes, sir.

[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.760]
You hear me, Neil.

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:31.700]
Yeah, but it's not sound good.

[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:32.540]
Not sound of clear.

[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.120]
Hello, you hear me.

[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.460]
Who is it?

[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.580]
Can't hear you.

[00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:37.240]
I heard him.

[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:40.520]
Real mess.

[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.360]
This doesn't have the usual.

[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:44.340]
It sounds like they're right next door all the time.

[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:44.740]
Not today.

[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:46.520]
Maybe there's maybe something up here.

[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:47.920]
I make your part.

[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.500]
Sounds fine.

[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.100]
Well, it doesn't sound fine up here.

[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.560]
How do you like that, Mr. Hodgschrat?

[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:51.940]
That's it.

[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.780]
You know what folks?

[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.100]
How is that?

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.100]

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.100]

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.100]

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:53.100]

[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:54.580]
I've never seen this before.

[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.080]
I've never seen this before.

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.080]

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.080]

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.080]

[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.080]

I've never seen this before.

[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.200]
I've never seen this before.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:09.900]
I've never seen this before.

[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:10.920]

I've never seen this before.

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.080]
I've never seen this before.

[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:24.400]
Just barely.

[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.540]
He's doing that on purpose.

[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.000]
I'm not here.

[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.000]
I'm not here.

[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.080]
Well, we want him in a low voice.

[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:29.740]
You know who that is.

[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.420]

I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:21.500]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:51.480]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.540]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:40.520]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:10.500]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:40.120]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think

[00:40:51.740 --> 00:41:10.100]
I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think, I think您 can lift this up.

[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.100]

[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:10.100]

[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.800]
I knew where that came from, but it's the same thing.

[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.900]
Okay, thank you.

[00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.240]
It's a lot easier to say hollanda in the Netherlands, right?

[00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:17.300]
Yeah, of course.

[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.360]
And I just thought maybe Holland was

[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.600]
like, state within the Netherlands or...

[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:24.300]
There is a hollanda in Michigan, like I've been here.

[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:25.020]
You don't want to go there.

[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:27.220]
There's a town in Holland and Michigan called hollanda in Michigan.

[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:28.460]
They have a collazier.

[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.120]
Yeah.

[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.800]
Okay, Neil, thank you very much.

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:31.680]
Okay, there you go.

[00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.840]
And by the way, when you go to Holland, I'll tell you where you can eat.

[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:38.840]
Did they have a call?

[00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.420]
I'll give this to Roger.

[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.180]
I'm going to go to Amsterdam.

[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.480]
Shall I go to the red light district?

[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:41.920]
No.

[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.960]
No, you don't want to go there.

[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:43.520]
Got only those.

[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.200]
What kind of perversion and filth you'll see there?

[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:46.420]
I don't kind of perverts.

[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:48.300]
Still, they have a lot of blue light specials in the red light district.

[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.840]
Yeah, no, they have green light specials.

[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.200]
Why do that?

[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.300]
That's Toronto 3 and Detroit nothing.

[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.360]
Of course, it's 100 years ago.

[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.540]
But like I said, when you were Leafs fan,

[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.800]
you have to live in the distance past, like being an dolphin fan.

[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.720]
Now, I think that all the other sports teams,

[00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:02.400]
I hate to say it.

[00:42:02.460 --> 00:42:04.300]
I say it as personally, but a Marlons have an as big run.

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.160]
They all got to leave.

[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.060]
You know, because it's not a sports town.

[00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:07.740]
It's never going to be.

[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.760]
It's not an anything town.

[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:10.640]
It's a stopping off point like hand-bank-cross.

[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.680]
They said, what was the name of that movie?

[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.380]
That Harvey Firestone Fag movie?

[00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:14.580]
Wow.

[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.700]
Could you narrow it down?

[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.840]
Don't you remember the Harvey Firestein Fag movie with Anne Bancroff?

[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.900]
The one where he said, what's it?

[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.600]
I can't believe he loved it.

[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.460]
That's so wrong.

[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:22.740]
That's not what he wanted.

[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.080]
And anyway, he had a great line in there.

[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.820]
She said, when we get old, we go to Florida.

[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.460]
We all go to Florida to die.

[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.200]
Right.

[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.540]
And that's right.

[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.220]
That's what it is.

[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:31.760]
It's a place for old people to go to die.

[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:33.420]
Not a place for living and breathing people.

[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:35.280]
By any stretch of imagination.

[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.380]
And our poll on the sports casters, I think,

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:41.420]
is a tremendous reflection on the lack of just the...

[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.940]
And again, I know you're not interested in sports,

[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.880]
but like I said, you could substitute almost any other category there.

[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:47.940]
And it would be the same.

[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.820]
It's like, huh?

[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:50.380]
Yeah.

[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:51.660]
What are you talking about?

[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.460]
We don't know from that.

[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.660]
We know who these people are.

[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.040]
What do they know?

[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:56.160]
What did they do?

[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.700]
All these people who came from someplace else.

[00:42:58.880 --> 00:42:59.700]
What did they do?

[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:02.640]
Did they have an early bird in New York in Manhattan?

[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:03.740]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:04.360]
Manhattan?

[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:06.840]
See, because then they'll be right again.

[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.980]
It's not Manhattan, man.

[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.640]
It's Manhattan, just like Mordy Glickman.

[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:11.820]
See, that was the famous thing about Mordy Glickman.

[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.680]
It's because it was always Mordy Glickman.

[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:17.380]
Commoner races at Yonkers before bullet bob Meyer.

[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:18.860]
These people, man.

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.580]
It's annoying.

[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.960]
I shouldn't get aggravated because it's payday.

[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.900]
And maybe I should actually show it up today.

[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:26.580]
That's probably where currents took off today.

[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:28.920]
They're probably stonewalling on a check again.

[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:29.400]
Oh, yeah.

[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.860]
We got the check at a drawer here somewhere.

[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.260]
Neil, what's your name downstairs?

[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:33.280]
Thought you were still here.

[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.560]
That was the last time.

[00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:35.720]
Yeah.

[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.660]
Who are you people, kiddin', man?

[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.840]
Who are they kidding, huh?

[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:41.060]
What kind of an outfit is that?

[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:44.800]
That they have, like, hang onto your check for a couple of extra days just to make sure it doesn't clear right away.

[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.640]
Because they're trying to rob from Peter to Paypal.

[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.580]
So they can pay the broadcast rights for all those goddamn ball games.

[00:43:49.780 --> 00:43:51.800]
So Greg, we can be a jock and run around.

[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:52.580]
Oh, look at me.

[00:43:52.660 --> 00:43:53.440]
I'm Mr. Sports.

[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:54.440]
I'm Mr. Sports.

[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.560]
Sports?

[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:56.220]
Yeah.

[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.040]
Mr. Schmendrick is what we call it.

[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.760]
In fact, that's probably about the best we call him.

[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.360]
Don't forget just moments from now to best-in-the-all merchandise.

[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.860]
And we're going to go for a big day today.

[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.220]
For what?

[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:06.920]
About 50 bucks?

[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:07.760]
Sure, at least.

[00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:08.340]
Well, I know.

[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.480]
So you can't do 50 because we don't have anything for $10.

[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.640]
It's got to be like an even number.

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.720]
Maybe somebody's about 80 bucks that they were looking for.

[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.740]
At the dream, and of course you know what Miguel says.

[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:17.140]
Nobody wants my CDs this year.

[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.400]
Nobody wants your crap, Neil.

[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.320]
That's what he said the other day.

[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.400]
After George pulled him out of Doreen.

[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.220]
With like a boxing match,

[00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.900]
you had to get to refer to him over a separate him.

[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:28.500]
219 votes.

[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:30.960]
No, we'll never make the 250th that we had for Teddy Kennedy.

[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.460]
All the Wesley Clark is winning by a much bigger margin.

[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.140]
153, 69.8% then near 70.

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.900]
George W. Bush, 35.15.9%.

[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.640]
Now what do you have yesterday, Bush?

[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.140]
Like I remember.

[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.700]
I got it here somewhere.

[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:47.800]
Just relax.

[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:48.840]
I got it here somewhere.

[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.460]
Oh, I think.

[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:50.520]
Let's see.

[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:51.260]
Hard Coast Sal.

[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.340]
George Bush.

[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:58.320]
I don't know what the hell I did with it.

[00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:00.220]
I got too many polls running around here.

[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:00.480]
You know?

[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.460]
I mean, we've heard too many polls.

[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.620]
You don't know which one to grab next.

[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.480]
Let's see.

[00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:09.820]
Here's a message about some stupid ass website.

[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.700]
Here's that hot quarterback from Notre Dame.

[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.660]
Oh, man.

[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:15.820]
I don't see what the hell I did with the Teddy Kennedy poll.

[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.860]
How could I have done that?

[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:19.560]
There's the one with JFK and Abe Lincoln.

[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.080]
Maybe I put it up here.

[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:22.860]
George, I'll hear it.

[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:23.420]
I'll hear it.

[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.060]
I'll hear it.

[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:24.900]
258.

[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:25.240]
Let's see.

[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.840]
A Bush had 23.2% against the Kennedy.

[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.960]
He's got 15.9% against Wesley Clark.

[00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.920]
So I think it's safe to say that we got a few minutes left for them to vote.

[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.380]
That Wesley Clark much stronger candidate because as a general, he didn't kill anybody.

[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.480]
Keep saying that.

[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.020]
Right.

[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.480]
Why do I keep saying that?

[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:43.860]
I don't know.

[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.180]
Just keep saying this.

[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:45.760]
I'm trying to make a point.

[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.240]
Like K said, and Godfather,

[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.320]
hey, Michael Presidents and Senators don't have men killed.

[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.540]
Who's being naive now?

[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:53.400]
K.

[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.980]
Presidents and Senators don't have men killed.

[00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.380]
And what an appropriate time to bring it up to you, Lotus.

[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:08.020]
At a time when American kids are dying, every goddamn day for no reason, for a pack of lies, for a bunch of billionaires.

[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.880]
See, here's the question I have for you.

[00:46:10.740 --> 00:46:11.900]
How much is enough?

[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.020]
You know how many times we've talked about this over years?

[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.060]
How much do you have to have?

[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.540]
It's kind of like how many beers do you have to have at a football game?

[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:24.140]
How much money do you have to have Wayne Hypinga and Bill Gates and all of you other grave robbers?

[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.680]
How much do you have to have before you finally have enough?

[00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:29.360]
Come with people.

[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:32.760]
This is 20 years' Iced Tea.

[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.200]
You way, M.

[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.540]
Just enough.

[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:39.880]
No.

[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.180]
Keep push.

[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.240]
Keep push.

[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:55.680]
I stumble and I fumble just to talk is really hard without pre-written notes from power over Andrew Card.

[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:56.940]
Keep push.

[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.780]
My brain is made that do-do.

[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:00.720]
Keep push.

[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.620]
But that don't seem to bug you.

[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.420]
Has no opposition and you have no opinion.

[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.360]
The sun is they attacked us but we don't give a crap it's me.

[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:42.720]
We're in pursuit of evil jurors every day just like those drug lords being pursued by OJ.

[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:50.600]
You don't care what I'm doing and I thought I was stupid.

[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:55.280]
The media controls up you do what you told the King Bush.

[00:47:55.760 --> 00:48:02.440]
If you didn't see it on TV it ain't real. The media isn't our control with stories there are spinners.

[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:05.800]
No matter what those wrong it will just blame it all on Clinton.

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.140]
King Bush.

[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.060]
I don't have no interns going down.

[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:10.900]
King Bush.

[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.100]
I'm on a higher moral ground because I don't know how.

[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:18.720]
He's a moral grounder and a bug pounder king Bush.

[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:27.800]
Look at O205 60 WDQM so anyway yesterday Eric being right on top of it as soon as I started acting like I couldn't find a pull from yesterday which I couldn't for a minute.

[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:33.340]
So he emailed me 266 was the total number of votes from yesterday we're not going to come even close to that today.

[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:36.560]
We got 244 what do you got on yours 244?

[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.160]
Yes, we had 266 yesterday so we're slipping.

[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.980]
We're down 22 votes from yesterday on a presidential pull.

[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.580]
That's a bad sign man.

[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.620]
We're slipping 247 like I said.

[00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.520]
We got a shot. We leave it up there another minute.

[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:57.540]
So anyway yesterday the final total Ted Kennedy 141 I wouldn't vote 64 in Georgia WDV6166.

[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.880]
Kennedy wants his ass pretty good but not like Wesley Clark baby.

[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:07.720]
Oh 100 and 247 votes general Wesley Clark 174 70.4%.

[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.040]
Oh the general.

[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.800]
Do we have any idea what his opinions are?

[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:12.860]
No.

[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:12.980]
No.

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:12.980]

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:12.980]

[00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:13.000]
No.

[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:13.080]
No.

[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:14.180]
No.

[00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:15.380]
No.

[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.040]
No.

[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:16.040]

[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:16.220]

[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.000]
No.

[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.100]
No.

[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:18.360]

[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:18.360]

[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:18.400]

[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:18.440]

[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:18.700]
No.

[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:18.700]

[00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:18.700]

[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.040]
No.

[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:20.200]

[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:20.240]

[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.280]

[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.280]

[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.280]

[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:20.280]

[00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:29.800]
No.

[00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:35.140]
No.

[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:35.220]

[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:36.140]

[00:49:36.140 --> 00:49:38.300]
than in the beginning of the show when I couldn't get a guy to get a phone.

[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.420]
And you notice we had several people on hold there including a lady?

[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.980]
Yeah. They don't hang on. I'm looking at one now.

[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:47.900]
You're looking at a lady right now who is it? Well,

[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:51.620]
tough. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello.

[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.600]
I don't care if it was Buzz Bunny running against

[00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.060]
a monkey boy. I'll vote for Buzz Bunny.

[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:00.760]
Absolutely correct.

[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.460]
I've got a poll idea.

[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:04.340]
Good.

[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:09.800]
Same vein. And that is all the media commentators who have been

[00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:13.440]
gotten to and gone from being liberal to far right wing.

[00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:14.240]
Yeah.

[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.200]
And the first one I would name would be your old friend Phil Hendry.

[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:19.740]
Who has-

[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:20.200]
Are you sure?

[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:22.760]
He has become such a hate monger.

[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:23.460]
Yeah.

[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:25.240]
It's unbelievable.

[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.920]
He makes a lot of fun about look-

[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:27.840]
A total sell-out.

[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.960]
I mean, but he believes it. It's not-

[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.420]
I mean, he believes it with all his angry little heart.

[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.160]
Yeah.

[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:36.980]
He said the other day that we're going to stay there to a

[00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.720]
little bit or end because we are entitled to our SUVs and our

[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.200]
trip to Disneyland and the Russian-

[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:44.320]
No, he was just had to be sarcastic.

[00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:44.780]
Oh, no.

[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:46.840]
I'm telling you.

[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.060]
He means it.

[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:50.520]
No, I don't think so.

[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:52.780]
I think that knowing him that had to be a tongue in cheek.

[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.140]
Oh, no. I mean, I-

[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.680]
Listen, I used to listen to a guy and got-

[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.120]
Are you sure?

[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.160]
I got a few laughs at him, but now he's-

[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.680]
You know, beneath every comic there's this really hateful person.

[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:03.440]
Hmm.

[00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:04.200]
He's there.

[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:05.800]
I'll be damned.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:10.160]
So, anyway, so-

[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.360]
How did that illegal alienate me?

[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.380]
I married with a 15-kids.

[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.540]
That probably sold him on life.

[00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:14.860]
Oh, yeah, but there-

[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:16.620]
His wife cheating on him and those aren't his kids.

[00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:19.360]
How do you know that?

[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:21.500]
Well, she's got a ton of life.

[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:22.220]
You notice that?

[00:51:22.900 --> 00:51:23.220]
Yeah.

[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:24.900]
And-

[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.720]
So, what makes you think that she's cheating on him?

[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:27.620]
What- what would you say that?

[00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.580]
Well, that's the word.

[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:31.400]
The word from a who?

[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.480]
The word down the pipeline?

[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.220]
I'm not gonna say-

[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:36.340]
The adultery pipeline?

[00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.740]
Just trust me, it'll come out.

[00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:39.400]
Okay.

[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:40.600]
Okay, hi.

[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.080]
Okay, have a great day.

[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.480]
I guess she's a still-

[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:43.900]
Henry Bash.

[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:44.340]
Okay.

[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.240]
Whatever you want.

[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.480]
And what do we have yesterday?

[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:48.220]
266?

[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:49.340]
We got 267.

[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.760]
Let's drag it out there a little bit.

[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:51.880]
I'm not pleased with that at all.

[00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:53.420]
Final totals here.

[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:53.800]
We can go.

[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:54.980]
Schmidt can't add pull, Eric.

[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.800]
General Wesley Clark 186.

[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:58.840]
69.6%.

[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.400]
George W. Bush 43.

[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:01.580]
16.1%.

[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:02.780]
I wouldn't vote 38.

[00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:05.220]
14.2% out of 267.

[00:52:06.280 --> 00:52:08.520]
By the way, that was her opinion about Phil's wife.

[00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.420]
Gee, I don't know.

[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.160]
I'm not comfortable with that kind of crap, you know?

[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.840]
But people just throw crap out like that?

[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:13.300]
Yeah.

[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.160]
Well, it's-

[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:14.900]
You'll find out.

[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:15.740]
It's in the pipeline.

[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.580]
It's down here.

[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:18.640]
And by the way, she didn't ask me where to eat though.

[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.260]
Maybe she's cheating with that lady's husband.

[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:24.380]
5670560.

[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:26.500]
18.2% out of the show today.

[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:27.300]
Here's pull number two.

[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.740]
Here's the important part of the show today.

[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.760]
That was just-

[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.240]
I don't even know if we should do that anymore.

[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.160]
Who else could we be?

[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.400]
We could put him against Julie Berman.

[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.660]
I told you this morning, anyone.

[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.320]
This crowd-

[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:37.220]
You're not listening to me.

[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.460]
Don't you see the big difference?

[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.660]
We had almost 70% for Wesley Clark and 10.5% out of 52.

[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:43.360]
We're Ted's not running for obvious reason.

[00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.780]
But I mean, just-

[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.540]
I thought since Ted's the one is opening a big mouth and saying things

[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:48.440]
that Mick Alivar has said,

[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:49.860]
I think we'll do Howard Dean tomorrow.

[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.840]
Oh, yeah.

[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:51.700]
Don't you?

[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:52.120]
Sure.

[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:53.640]
I'm still Howard Dean, man.

[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.100]
I mean, a lot of you have jumped right on at the Wesley Clark bandwagon.

[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.480]
I'm not really sure why just because it's the popular thing to do at the moment.

[00:53:00.700 --> 00:53:01.680]
They love the uniform.

[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:02.740]
It's the-

[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.960]
It's the Fad du jour.

[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.460]
But I'm just not all that crazy because within a couple of days he flipped

[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:11.220]
up like crazy about the whole Iraq war thing.

[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.120]
One day he said,

[00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:13.780]
well, he would never have voted for the resolution.

[00:53:14.100 --> 00:53:16.280]
And then he said, he would have voted for Resolute and then he said,

[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.120]
what did I say?

[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:18.060]
What is that?

[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:19.000]
Yeah.

[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:19.720]
What did I say?

[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:20.820]
What do you want me to say?

[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:25.160]
So I'm just- he reminds me of Arnold only with like a better uniform.

[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.320]
They had the big debate in California.

[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:28.620]
The California last night.

[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:30.160]
We'll talk about that eventually.

[00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:34.380]
And if Arnold thinks he's really a put in his best foot forward,

[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.460]
way who's waiting in the wings?

[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.100]
Martina.

[00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:40.820]
Martina may run for U.S. office and U.S.

[00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.560]
I guarantee you she could kick the crap out of Arnold.

[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:44.720]
I don't care how much of a bodybuilder he used to be.

[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:48.060]
You know, he's probably in better shape, could just with one hand tied or a hundred back.

[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.480]
Beat the snout on that punk.

[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.620]
The terminator of my ass.

[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.380]
So anyway, what's your biggest gross shot we're asking today?

[00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.200]
My list so far, I think I already know what I'm voting for.

[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:00.760]
And I feel bad about it.

[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:01.560]
What?

[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.080]
Red here.

[00:54:03.700 --> 00:54:04.120]
Oh, yeah.

[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.300]
I'm sorry.

[00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.780]
I can't control it.

[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.840]
It's just like how come I like Nestle's Turtle Ice Cream.

[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:09.580]
I just do.

[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:10.320]
It's just my knees.

[00:54:11.020 --> 00:54:13.240]
It does a dance on my taste buds, okay?

[00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.480]
You've never seen a redhead you were attracted to.

[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.140]
No.

[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:16.680]
Really?

[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:17.220]
No.

[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:17.600]
Wow.

[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.060]
No, in my life I have never seen a male female.

[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.140]
Now, maybe some famous females with red hair.

[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:28.200]
You were a Julianne Moore from Magnolia, for example.

[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.040]
She's got red hair.

[00:54:29.220 --> 00:54:29.800]
Are you kidding?

[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.260]
I love Julianne Moore.

[00:54:31.420 --> 00:54:32.140]
I think she's great.

[00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:34.220]
And I'll come up with other ones, I'm sure.

[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:37.020]
But she doesn't have like that.

[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:38.000]
You know the kind of red her.

[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.520]
She doesn't have like a carrot on the top red hair.

[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:40.800]
Huh?

[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:41.320]
Sure.

[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.260]
I mean, it's not like flaming like neon red, but it's red.

[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:45.980]
Are you sure?

[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:46.780]
Oh yeah.

[00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.380]
Was that film?

[00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:49.080]
No, it's not a fact.

[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:49.980]
Are you sure?

[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.020]
Are you sure?

[00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:52.140]
Pubercares.

[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.860]
Anyway, what's your biggest gross up?

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.160]
Well, I'm just saying generally speaking, there's always an exception.

[00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.240]
Just like sometimes you'll see fat people who are very, very attractive.

[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:01.680]
And you say, God, if they only lost about 600 pounds, they'd be hot.

[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:02.060]
Yeah.

[00:55:02.260 --> 00:55:02.820]
They'd get that tragic.

[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:05.280]
And it is sad, especially young people.

[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]
You say, you don't know what to draw.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.200]
Oh, and you think, God, if they just lost like 40 pounds, they'd be beautiful.

[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:10.480]
Right.

[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:11.780]
I might even look for it.

[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:16.540]
Well, you can't look for it now because you've got to fight in the middle of Lakasha folds,

[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:17.300]
jaws of life.

[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.760]
What's your biggest gross out red hair body odor?

[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:24.260]
Oh, I may have to change my vote.

[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:25.580]
Zits.

[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.920]
You can do something about the body odor there.

[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:27.860]
Zits.

[00:55:29.060 --> 00:55:30.160]
Jelly rolls of fat.

[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:35.240]
I say, you know how long it's been since I've had a slice of jelly roll?

[00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.060]
You know, I really think you're around your waist.

[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.220]
How do we always come back?

[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:40.800]
How do I, not we, I do it.

[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.300]
That's my fault.

[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:41.760]
I'm a pig.

[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:43.880]
How do I always bring everything back to food?

[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:46.440]
When's the last time you had a slice of ice cream cake roll?

[00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:47.780]
You know what I mean?

[00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:48.940]
Oh, that's a good question.

[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.120]
That's been a long time.

[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.280]
You know what I'm talking about.

[00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:51.720]
It's great to.

[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.300]
Oh, my God.

[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.140]
Do I want to let it melt a little bit so they can eat a little moist?

[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:58.040]
Do they make that like a carvel?

[00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.240]
I'm sure they do.

[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:02.220]
Because carvel really sucks, but that's one thing I think they have that's really good.

[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:03.140]
You're like cookie puss?

[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:04.660]
Cookie puss?

[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:06.180]
Yeah.

[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:07.720]
Cookie puss?

[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.460]
Cookie puss.

[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.340]
What is that?

[00:56:09.340 --> 00:56:10.460]
Cookie puss?

[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:11.900]
No, the puss was yesterday.

[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:13.980]
No, I heard it out yesterday.

[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:14.300]
I heard it out yesterday.

[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.780]
Using puss from Ann Coulter's rectum or whatever.

[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.280]
I was that muff guy that was crying about.

[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:19.840]
Oh, what are we going to do?

[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.420]
We like you.

[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:21.700]
I'm up here.

[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.180]
Good guy.

[00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:23.080]
Don't ever make a mistake.

[00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:23.900]
We like you a lot.

[00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.900]
But you're such a little girl, man.

[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:28.720]
And crying about Moe was smoking us a gardener.

[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:30.300]
My hat's off to Moe.

[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.400]
I'm starting to cotton up to him a little bit.

[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:34.260]
And even Georgia's starting to like cozy up.

[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.280]
Even though we tried desperately to get your ass fired.

[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.100]
You know what?

[00:56:37.260 --> 00:56:38.060]
He did the right thing.

[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:39.320]
He can't live in the past forever.

[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:40.160]
That'd be funny.

[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.300]
Absolutely.

[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.160]
He did the right thing.

[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:42.760]
He backed off.

[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.900]
And like I said, now he's finally, it's a little after a year and a half, the like bulb

[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:47.140]
went off.

[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.220]
And as any realized, it's not us who be the enemy.

[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:51.980]
It's management and the engineering and the sales.

[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.220]
These are the people that were fighting all of us together in a common cause.

[00:56:55.220 --> 00:56:59.720]
And when I come back to town in about 40 or 50 months, no, seriously, when I come back, I think

[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.980]
we ought to have a smoke in one morning.

[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:01.860]
I think so.

[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:02.580]
I got my throat off.

[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:02.920]
No, Ralph.

[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:04.180]
Well, we'll be right up a big factor.

[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:05.220]
Maybe cigar too.

[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:05.820]
Water pipe.

[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.440]
There you go.

[00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:09.340]
Don't you think that's a great idea?

[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:10.640]
That's an excellent idea.

[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:13.560]
We'll have a smoking and we'll see when Muff comes wall to the...

[00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:16.820]
Oh, Greg, they're all smoking big fat ones, Greg.

[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:17.940]
What am I going to do?

[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.940]
You know, we'll lock the door and jam a wedge in it.

[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.500]
Crying like a little lady.

[00:57:22.840 --> 00:57:24.240]
Oh, man, is he a pussy?

[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.260]
What's your biggest gross out?

[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.600]
Red hair, body odor, and zits, jelly rolls of fat.

[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.140]
I love the way I worded that.

[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.640]
I get such a kick out of myself sometimes.

[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:40.380]
Bad breath, sloppy clothes like me or bad wig like Mo.

[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:43.500]
I just used this as an example.

[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:44.360]
Right.

[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:47.560]
So those are the first ones we got on the list.

[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.600]
What's your biggest gross out?

[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:52.460]
When you see a person, that could be somebody you know, somebody you don't know, whatever,

[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:55.180]
just what the visual thing.

[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:56.100]
Oh, my God.

[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.040]
If you're going to ask me.

[00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:57.980]
Okay.

[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:58.980]
Bad nose.

[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:01.920]
Bad nose.

[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:03.020]
Ugly nose.

[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:03.620]
No, no, no.

[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.520]
You don't understand the pull again.

[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.040]
You're associating a sexual connotation to this.

[00:58:08.120 --> 00:58:10.280]
It could be that, but that's not what I'm talking about.

[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:11.240]
You got red hair on here.

[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.920]
I have the same thing about noses.

[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.980]
If it's an ugly nose, I run screaming from the room.

[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:15.460]
Really?

[00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.600]
Then like I said, you understand the pull.

[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:19.360]
Because that's what it means.

[00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.540]
And I know I can't get past you with a real obnoxious ugly grotesque nose.

[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:26.460]
And you just want to start running because like what time to the spaceship land?

[00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:26.680]

[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:30.820]
Like men can have a big nose and it's not necessarily a big deal or a bump on their

[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:31.020]
nose.

[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.400]
And it's like, okay, maybe it works.

[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.000]
Maybe it doesn't, but if a woman has a big jacked up, a real ruin, ruins all of it.

[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.860]
It just, uh, it's a taints.

[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.420]
Anyway, Marty Glickman used an ounce of racism at honkers.

[00:58:42.180 --> 00:58:42.500]
1113.

[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.180]
We got 11 for body odor already.

[00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:45.260]
Boy, it's a good thing they're not here.

[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.140]
Because some of those packies, man, and some of those Indian people, very nice people,

[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:54.300]
find people to the salt of the earth, but too much salt is not necessarily a good thing,

[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:55.280]
especially in your curry.

[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.980]
Hey, if you're underpaid overworked, if your boss tweets you like crap, maybe you'd

[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:02.200]
like to have yourself a new hot pain career before the end of the year.

[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.640]
And I realize it's September 24.

[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:06.380]
But the fact of the matter, or 25, is it?

[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.040]
Holy crap.

[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:09.520]
Is this your just zooming vibe?

[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.700]
But you can still get yourself the training before the year ends for a great computer job

[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:14.780]
from our friends at Fast Train.

[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:15.980]
It's absolutely correct.

[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:18.840]
The demand for computer professionals continues to be gigantic.

[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.140]
There's no better time than right now to get you a new hot pain career.

[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:24.700]
Yeah, I think that call about Phil was a setup called.

[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:25.660]
I don't know if I think about it.

[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:25.660]

[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.480]
Don't you?

[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.120]
Because you know that he had to be just joking about SUVs.

[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:29.500]
Of course you do.

[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.160]
You know that it be.

[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:31.780]
I think it was a set of shock.

[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:36.000]
Fast Train offers job placement assistance, convenient to evening weekend schedules with

[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.520]
six locations in Florida, including four in South Florida.

[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:39.960]
There's about to be one nearby you.

[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:43.200]
Fast Train offers financial assistance for people who qualify too.

[00:59:43.460 --> 00:59:46.740]
So what he got to lose be it's size of a marginal job, a lot of grief, a lot of headaches,

[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.400]
and a paycheck that won't get to anywhere.

[00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.580]

[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.720]
My, my and local, we're sports radio 560, she's UAM.

[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:16.780]
Blog like presents real American heroes.

[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.440]
Real American hero.

[01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:24.120]
Today we salute you, Mr. High School guidance counselor.

[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.820]
Mr. High School guidance counselor.

[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:33.580]
User help countless students decide that when they get out of school, they want to be

[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:37.000]
anything but a high school guidance counselor.

[01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:43.000]
You weren't quite smart enough to mess up their lives as a public school teacher.

[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:48.060]
So you decided to mess them up with bad career advice instead.

[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.800]
What is an elementary anyway?

[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.880]
Yes, Mr. High School guidance counselor.

[01:00:54.880 --> 01:01:01.380]
If 30 years ago a young Bill Gates walked into your office, you'd have handed him a pamphlet

[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:04.240]
but tracked their trailer truck training school.

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:14.940]
Thank you, Mr. High School guidance counselor, for giving us all hope that no matter how badly our lives turn out,

[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:18.120]
there's always a bigger failure somewhere.

[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:28.900]
So, rack a butt light and raise your glass to a guy who has 5 or 6 himself every day before work.

[01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:35.260]
Mr. High School guidance counselor, a real American hero.

[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.320]
A rare and higher education, St. Technical College, Missouri.

[01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.320]
It's 1119 at 560 W.A.

[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:49.560]
I'm not forget McGail right now is waiting for it from now to 1 o'clock at Dream Cars South 174.03 South Dixie High.

[01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:50.800]
What would the best meal merchandise?

[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.200]
And we're waiting for it.

[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.200]
Any report yet?

[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:57.060]
Yeah, he said, why isn't he talking about me? I've been here for 20 minutes.

[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.340]
Did I or did I not mention that a couple of times before?

[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:08.840]
I told them. They said, no, it's inside being here.

[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.440]
Do we have a number from the end of a business yesterday? Do we have a number?

[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:17.220]
How much we've raised?

[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:17.560]
Yeah.

[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:18.660]
I see.

[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.480]
Maybe that's why I'm not talking about you, McGail, because you're useless.

[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.180]
Even Dorena is discovered now, okay?

[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:28.840]
He finally took a look at that thing and she said, she tried, she yanked, she twisted, she yelled, she licked and nothing happened.

[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:30.400]
Useless. That's what she said.

[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:31.620]
I don't know what his wife says.

[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.800]
Now, I think she's using somebody else's.

[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.080]
Oh.

[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.320]
Texas University shuts down Big Sail.

[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.420]
Well, I saw obviously he hasn't gotten one dime yet done there.

[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.220]
Dream of herself.

[01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:47.720]
You remember the old days when they used to say it was pick a location and we'll go there.

[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:48.600]
Do you remember that?

[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.020]
Yeah.

[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.080]
And almost every time it was a success, it was a jackpot, okay?

[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:56.300]
Yeah.

[01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.000]
Am I right? Right?

[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.760]
I'm not saying every single time.

[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.600]
But generally speaking, more often than not, it worked out very well.

[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:08.420]
Yesterday he's inside of the convention center and a player two days ago where they have to pay to get in,

[01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:11.640]
where nobody's got any idea what else going on there unless they're computer nerds.

[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.920]
And out today he said, well, I don't even know anything about Dream Cars out to you.

[01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.940]
No, I know it's on US1, that's something.

[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:22.440]
It's a car joint and look for the QM van, Amigail is desperately waiting for and he's calling an ambitian and belly.

[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.540]
I can like a little child.

[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.920]
Maybe he can come back to the station and sit around and cry with Duff.

[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:30.080]
Oh, why would they say something good about us?

[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.120]
When you start raising some money, Gouf, maybe then we'll say something good about you.

[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:37.320]
Tess' University shuts down Bakesail.

[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:46.760]
SMU, Southern Methodist University shut down a Bakesail yesterday in which cookies were offered for sale at different prices depending on the buyer's race or gender.

[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:47.660]
Huh?

[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:54.240]
The sale was organized by the young conservatives of Texas who said it was intended as a protestive affirmative action.

[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.720]
A sign said white males had to pay a dollar for a cookie.

[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:03.180]
The price was 75 cents for white women, 50 cents for Hispanics and 25 cents for blacks.

[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.240]
What's kind of like the arbitrarian mentality, same thing, I mean reverse.

[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.500]
Right? Right?

[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.060]
White people get a buck, blacks and Hispanics get a million dollars.

[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:16.780]
Members of the conservative groups said they meant no offense were trying only to protest the use of racer-genre as a factor in college admissions.

[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:18.920]
Which I happen to agree with them, by the way.

[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.900]
Similar sales have been held by college Republican chapters of colleges, in least five of the states in February.

[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.080]
A black student filed a complaint with that, as SMU saying the sale was offensive.

[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:29.100]
What's he complaining about? He gets it for a quarter.

[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.160]
How do you like them, dark folks?

[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.140]
I always bitch in and bitch in and belly.

[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:34.540]
That's amazing.

[01:04:36.600 --> 01:04:37.340]
And that's something.

[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:41.920]
If you went under a car lot and they said, okay, well you're Hispanics, so we'll give you the car for five grand.

[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:44.080]
And a white guy over there will charge him ten grand.

[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:46.620]
And the dark-complexed guy there, he's going to get it for 50 bucks.

[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.600]
And then he files a complaint.

[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.500]
How come the white people weren't filing a complaint, say?

[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:51.800]
Right.

[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:56.000]
A black student filed a complaint with that, using the sale was offensive.

[01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:01.880]
SMU officials said they halted the event after 45 minutes because it created a potentially unsafe situation.

[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:09.040]
This was not an issue about free speech Tim Moore, director of the SMU students center, said in the story for today's edition of the Dallas Morning News.

[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:11.880]
It was really an issue where we had a hostile environment being created.

[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:16.620]
The sale drew a crowd outside the student center and several students engaged in the shouting match.

[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:25.920]
Moore said, David C. Rushing 23, a law student in chairman of the Unconserved as a Texas at MSU and for the state, said the event didn't get out of hand.

[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.340]
And most of the students gathered around the table of cookies and Rice Krispies treats, he said, oh, why did I have to get to that part?

[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:35.080]
You know the Rice Krispies treats with a marshmallow?

[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:35.600]
Sure.

[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:36.200]
They're great.

[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.380]
Don't you love that?

[01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.500]
Especially when they're fresh and still gooey.

[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:43.100]
Oh, and a marshmallow is still like oozing and melting in their own all mushy.

[01:05:43.240 --> 01:05:43.700]
Mmm.

[01:05:44.980 --> 01:05:48.660]
You know what else I haven't had in years, which I don't know I doesn't even think about eating.

[01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:54.320]
What's the like, they're coming a big jar of that marshmallow cream and that every day?

[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:54.480]
Huh?

[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.180]
Marshmallow topping?

[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.520]
Yeah, like real marshmallow, right?

[01:05:59.120 --> 01:05:59.740]
Like with marshmallow.

[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:00.540]
Mmm.

[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:01.320]
Fluff?

[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:03.260]
What is it?

[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:03.840]
Fluff.

[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.260]
Fluff.

[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.140]
Marshmallow fluff.

[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:07.720]
You talking about Moe Show again?

[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:09.300]
Now we love Moe.

[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.160]
Moe is our new buddy.

[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.180]
We love you Moe.

[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.380]
You silly old cout.

[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:18.560]
We copied what's been done at multiple campuses around the country to illustrate our opinion of affirmative action and how we think it's unfair.

[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:22.060]
Matt Houston, a 19 year old sophomore called the group's priceless defensive.

[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:23.580]
Matt's obviously a white guy.

[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.580]
My reaction was discussed because of the ignorance of some SMU students.

[01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.020]
Oh, said Houston, who's black?

[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.360]
What are the black people pissed off about?

[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.540]
We're giving it to him for a quarter.

[01:06:32.540 --> 01:06:35.420]
They were arguing that affirmative action was solely based on race.

[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.340]
It's not based on race.

[01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:39.160]
It's based on bringing a diverse community to a certain organization.

[01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:44.020]
The group sold three cookies during its protest raising a buck and a half, which is more than we got for abandoned parresto.

[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.060]
I guarantee you that right now.

[01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:46.860]
$1.50.

[01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.400]
Do we have that yet today?

[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:48.600]
No.

[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:49.540]
I guarantee we don't.

[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.920]
At DreamCars South, at 174.03, South, Dixia, highway.

[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:57.240]
He had several calls this week for the van to go down into that area.

[01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:01.220]
Aren't you sure that he had the several calls saying, oh, I'm going to get one.

[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.380]
Why don't you come to DreamCars South at 174.03, South, Dixia highway.

[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.980]
And we'll bring lots and lots of cash for deals, merchandise, and abandoned parresto.

[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:08.480]
Maybe do that.

[01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:08.620]
Maybe do that.

[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.660]
Well, I think that's a pretty cute story about the big sale.

[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:16.440]
And so the black kid was upset because he was mocking affirmative action and stuff.

[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.560]
But in the meantime, he's getting a cookie for $0.25 and a white kid's got to pay a buck for it.

[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:22.760]
Never please some people.

[01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:23.120]
You know what?

[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.060]
Never satisfy certain people.

[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.460]
Them people.

[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:27.780]
Here's Miami.

[01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:28.100]
Hello.

[01:07:28.620 --> 01:07:29.200]
Hey, Neil.

[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:30.060]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.020]
Hey, I don't know if you've talked about it.

[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:35.400]
The bait last thing with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:36.920]
California.

[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.160]
I thought hello.

[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.080]
I'm here.

[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:43.320]
Yeah, I talked to the Schwarzenegger this very well.

[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:44.500]
Yeah.

[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:49.980]
Even by your own admission, you said that if he is on the phone, I said he's on.

[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:53.280]
Well, then you say I said he's on.

[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:56.040]
Well, then you said it.

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:08:00.860]
If he became governor of California, he attacked all the issues and all the problems they had,

[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.260]
he would have been good for California.

[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.140]
No, I did not.

[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:04.280]
Yes, you did.

[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:11.060]
$5.670560, pound that was Chris Bush, pound $5.60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.900]
What's your biggest gross out so far?

[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:14.960]
Body odor 30.

[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:20.520]
Oh, I guess these people wouldn't be willing to work with Josh Friedman anytime soon.

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:21.740]
I'm thankfulness we don't anymore.

[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:23.320]
68.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:24.780]
Body odor.

[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:27.460]
Jelly rolls of fat 16.

[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:30.820]
A lot of people wouldn't want to work at QA and we got jelly rolls up the ass.

[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:31.720]
I can't say that.

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:32.780]
Bad breath 14.

[01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:34.100]
Zits for red hair too.

[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.540]
Somebody else out there just can't handle the red hair thing.

[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:37.740]
Bad wig too.

[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:40.660]
No votes yet for sloppy clothes or ugly nose.

[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:41.640]
I thought you were voting for it.

[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.740]
I voted for it.

[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.600]
Well, it's not on my thing here.

[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:45.600]
Let me refresh it.

[01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:47.580]
Okay. Let me refresh my ugly nose.

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:50.160]
And let's see if it's refreshing or not.

[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.160]
Well, it's sitting there.

[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:52.940]
It's thinking about it.

[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:56.280]
Okay. It's thinking saying that can we put all ugly noses and got your vote?

[01:08:56.400 --> 01:09:00.560]
See, obviously you've got, you've met guys that were attractive but they had body odor.

[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.460]
Yes, I have.

[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.040]
Look at me.

[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.220]
I run like a son of a bitch.

[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:05.740]
I can't, I don't care how good they look.

[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.020]
Just tell them to take a shower.

[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.280]
That's a good idea anyway.

[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:10.100]
Huh?

[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.300]
That's a good idea anyway.

[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:13.340]
I don't think that's necessarily going to help.

[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:16.940]
I think, I think some of it does have to run a care of what you say.

[01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:17.880]
It's skin pigmentation.

[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.020]
It's people who's diet.

[01:09:19.020 --> 01:09:20.700]
Whatever they've been eating all of their life.

[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:25.360]
I'm telling you that that people from like Pakistan, India, certain other countries, parts of the Middle East,

[01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.580]
it's not just they haven't seen a bar of coast in a long time or they keep dropping it.

[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.440]
But it's a skin pigmentation thing.

[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.960]
It's just there, but, and nobody believes me, but it's true.

[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.000]
I guess I would have had two of the samples of those.

[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.700]
You had to be close and personal, okay?

[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.880]
Or maybe just go into restaurant where they eat a lot of curry, okay?

[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.660]
Go into restaurant with kid curry and take a sniff.

[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.660]
27 past 11 at 5, 60 WDQM.

[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.740]
If you want to see the best in the horse race,

[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.580]
I'm a casting, then head over to Pompo-Dopar, Carnest Track, and plunge to your heart's content.

[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.400]
Pompo-Dopar is open every day and night, seven days a night, sweet, featuring the best,

[01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.500]

Harness, Thurbera, and Highlight as well for you to watch.

[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:02.660]
And like I said, plunge like a maniac.

[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.580]
General parking admission is always free too.

[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:08.160]

[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.940]
where you can get a private box seat with your own TV monitor for just $2.

[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.980]
There comes Jeff Gregory on the outside.

[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.760]
Hit him again very lightly, Jeff, not too hard.

[01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.520]
It's all done in the smoke-free environment.

[01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:21.740]
Come watch and wait for this Saturday, September 27, on the $400,000 Kentucky Futurity,

[01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:26.940]
and the $300,000 Blue Grandstakes at Lexington's Red Mile at prestigious Lexington.

[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.960]
And no forget racing, fans, Pompo-Dopar, in fact, what was the name K. Wood Ledford,

[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.960]
I think, called the races there once upon a time.

[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:33.620]
Maybe not.

[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.620]
Remember, K. Wood Ledford was on our way yesterday?

[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.420]
I don't think he ever made the polls matter if I-

[01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:37.920]
Yes, he did.

[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:38.740]
He did?

[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:39.200]
Yes.

[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.540]
Are you sure?

[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:43.960]
I think he left him out along with the Watt-San Harry Callis.

[01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:46.680]
I think you just callis about the whole thing because you ain't a sports car.

[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:46.960]
Jeff River.

[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.960]
And don't forget racing fan, Pompo-Dopar, a Jeff River was left off intentional.

[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:54.700]
Don't forget racing fans, Pompo-Dopar, will be back to the next one with the start of their 40th anniversary season of great,

It's almost there with the return of high stakes poker as well.

[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.900]
That rich will be there, Derrick will be there, all my friends plunging their guts out like a bunch of wild lunatics.

[01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:09.500]

Add dog is out of control and you'll find out why.

[01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:30.500]
When you hear the latest release from Blackbuster Entertainment,

[01:11:31.280 --> 01:11:33.200]

I'll ride!

[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:39.340]

[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:39.340]

[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:39.340]

[01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:39.540]
I'll ride!

[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:43.140]
The Mad Dog just can't kiss enough of that cottage cheese butt.

[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.200]
If he wants to be the singer, God bless America and paste his NG spring up here.

[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:47.740]
I'll do it.

[01:12:47.860 --> 01:12:49.040]
You got no!

[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]
Everybody goes!

[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.240]
That is alright!

[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:53.760]
Woo!

[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:55.020]
Alright!

[01:12:55.520 --> 01:12:57.880]
Listen to the mad dog sing himself happy!

[01:12:58.100 --> 01:12:58.440]
Alright!

[01:12:59.200 --> 01:12:59.600]
Alright!

[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:00.760]

[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:02.620]
Alright!

[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:03.380]

[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:03.380]

[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:04.400]
I am a...

[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:08.800]
You mad ass, things do as available now at all blockbuster stores.

[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:11.360]
1133, that's the wildly popular gym manager.

[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.780]
You won our poll yesterday of your favorite sportscaster about a zidian votes.

[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:17.780]
I mean, hands down, just buried into your competition.

[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:18.860]
I just go on mad dog.

[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:20.380]
I think he's on today, isn't he?

[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:21.780]
We don't know.

[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.820]
According to my schedule, he's supposed to work today, but he might be celebrating yesterday's poll victory.

[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:26.940]
He's in the poll position.

[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.440]
Mad dog at two, the Humphers at four, till 630 before the Marlon game.

[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.840]
And a really tough show because he's got Bino on between five and six.

[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.680]
So, he's got like an hour and a half to work today.

[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.600]
Marlon's at that 630, Philly's at the Marlon's, is the Marlon's try for the sweep,

[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.140]
and try to clinch at least the time for the wild card with the win tonight, 705,

[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.620]
and a can't fit a baseball game in Joe and Mark overnight.

[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:46.340]
How's Miguel doing?

[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.200]
40 bucks.

[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:50.760]
Well, I mean, that's a start.

[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:51.340]
That's a start.

[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:52.520]
Yeah.

[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:54.920]
Not overwhelming.

[01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:56.720]
I don't think we're going to do a thousand.

[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:57.600]
No.

[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.760]
But you know what he said.

[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:04.580]
He said nobody wants my CD and certainly nobody wants those more hard-headed Keetianos

[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:05.160]
or the mad dog.

[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:05.640]
Oh, right.

[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:05.900]
What?

[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:07.400]
They ought to want that Keetianos.

[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.980]
I know they ought to want it all.

[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:13.760]
Don't look at me, mister, but we just can't get to that if they wanted.

[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.760]
If we had three Marlon tickets there, what maybe you lined up from there all the way to

[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:17.960]
Oh, oh, just like you're in Tia.

[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:18.760]
Who says he doesn't?

[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.920]
Does he have three Marlon tickets?

[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:21.760]
I don't know, maybe.

[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:25.760]
He didn't tell me anything about stealing the dealer prizes or anything like that.

[01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.760]
It just basically is like a best of needle thing at the van today.

[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.160]
And all you people down there in South-Aid that are always belly,

[01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.060]
and we don't come down there, there he is.

[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.700]
Dream cars south 174.03 South, Dixie Highway.

[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.620]
And we better raise like at least $1 million to there.

[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.140]
I'm going to be really pissed off and fired up.

[01:14:42.180 --> 01:14:44.640]
What's your biggest gross body odor 42?

[01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.260]
By the way, why would that woman...

[01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:46.960]
What was that all about?

[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.640]
That set-up call and a bitch about chronic.

[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.280]
She's a chronic crazy person.

[01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:51.820]
She is?

[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.160]
Yeah.

[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:55.900]
I don't recognize her.

[01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:56.420]
Oh, yeah.

[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:57.780]
She's not a nowhere.

[01:14:58.040 --> 01:15:00.240]
Oh, his wife's cheating on him and he's...

[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:02.580]
I mean, obviously there's things that she was quoting a money,

[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:05.420]
but a child would know if they ever heard Phil once that that was tongue in cheek

[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:08.300]
about we deserve to have our SUVs and go to Disney.

[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:09.840]
I mean, Jesus.

[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:11.740]
Nobody could be that stupid, could they?

[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.700]
Get that bitch.

[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.560]
Don't ever call me again.

[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.100]
You silly crazy ass bitch.

[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:18.720]
Just looking to stir the pot, stir the pot.

[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.540]
We're looking to smoke it.

[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.520]
She's looking to stir it.

[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:23.720]
What's your biggest gross out body odor 42?

[01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.440]
Jelly Rolls-a-fat 31.

[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:26.400]
I'm so sorry.

[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:27.740]
Out of 106 votes.

[01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.200]
They don't like the jelly rolls-a-fat.

[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.840]
I'm sitting here right now.

[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.780]
I got my hands on it.

[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:32.840]
Not for much longer.

[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:33.160]
Not for much longer.

[01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:33.520]
No, I'm fat too.

[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.980]
No, seriously, I got my big jelly roll.

[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:36.680]
What do you want?

[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:38.960]
Speaking of that, 188.

[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:41.080]
Oh, two pounds back up.

[01:15:41.180 --> 01:15:42.960]
But still, that's not real bad though.

[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.120]
Not that good, huh?

[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.160]
No, the wrong direction.

[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.660]
Well, at least I'm under 190.

[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:50.740]
Didn't I promise you I would never go back over 190?

[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:51.700]
Yeah, well.

[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:52.300]
And I won't.

[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:52.740]
Okay.

[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:54.880]
It's slow.

[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:55.620]
You know what I mean?

[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.200]
It's slower.

[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.040]
I'm trying to think of what I ate that like,

[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.600]
give me like a little bit of a setback.

[01:15:59.900 --> 01:16:00.520]
Liquid marshmallow.

[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.440]
No, that sounds pretty good.

[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.820]
You know what I'm gonna be really good?

[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.920]
Would be a liter of that Briar's score ice cream.

[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:11.720]
With liquid marshmallow and hot fudge.

[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:13.880]
Alternately like, you know, melted in the microwave.

[01:16:14.260 --> 01:16:15.880]
Alternately drizzled on it.

[01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:19.440]
And, you know, you do as you take the score

[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.600]
and you put it in the microwave and let you know how I like to do it.

[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:21.820]
Sure.

[01:16:21.820 --> 01:16:22.600]
Melt it up a little bit.

[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.460]
So it's not melted, but like real goofy, you know?

[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:29.580]
Oh, and mixing with that's a hot marshmallow and hot fudge.

[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.440]
Oh, man.

[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.620]
Hey, I don't care what anybody says.

[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:36.060]
I want the pill that lets me, whatever the hell I want.

[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:37.840]
From now until I croak, I want that pill.

[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.060]
I deserve it.

[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:40.000]
Huh?

[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.860]
I've been dieting for like a zillion years, man.

[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:43.780]
About third, man.

[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:44.440]
More than that.

[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.600]
And I'm sick and tired of it already.

[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.160]
I want the freaking magic pill.

[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:50.400]
All you grave robbers out there.

[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.640]
Can you imagine how much money somebody's gonna make someday?

[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.440]
Because it will happen.

[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:54.320]
Someday.

[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:54.780]
It will happen.

[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.740]
Somebody will make a pill.

[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.280]
You know, just like they have these fat blockers,

[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.380]
they're all phony baloney and they make your crap a lot.

[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.460]
But there will be some kind of a pill at the event

[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:04.400]
that will make your, that will prevent your body

[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.420]
from absorbing the color, coloric value and whatever is

[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:08.220]
in the food you eat.

[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:08.960]
Right?

[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:09.380]
You know what I mean?

[01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:11.460]
This kind of like, pass through real fat.

[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:13.040]
The product of your age holiday.

[01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:15.020]
Like, you'll eat it all, pass over.

[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.540]
A wrong holiday, sorry.

[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.940]
Happy New Year, by the way.

[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.680]
Body odor, 45, your biggest grossage.

[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.960]
Yellow rolls of fat, 34, bad breath, 24.

[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:25.720]
Zits, 5, bad wig, 3.

[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.420]
Red here, 2.

[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:28.360]
Sloppy clothes, 1, ugly nose, 1.

[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.080]
Dirtges, the 1.

[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.340]
And we can certainly add some more on there.

[01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.860]
But I think we covered most of the bases.

[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:34.120]
Here's Pemberpine's, hello.

[01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:35.920]
Pass, embarrassment.

[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.040]
Here's Westchester, hello.

[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:40.880]
Yeah, any, all you doing?

[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:41.640]
Okay, sir.

[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:45.700]
I got two for you, but I turned the show on late,

[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.160]
so I'm not real sure I'm on the same page with you.

[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:48.940]
You have two of us.

[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:49.880]
You have two of us.

[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.960]
I'll close you down in a song, Underwear.

[01:17:57.940 --> 01:17:58.780]
That's all I need.

[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:02.840]
Yeah, and what's the other one?

[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.740]
The other one was, uh, President G. W.

[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:07.560]
Okay.

[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.120]
I want to tell Scott one thing, if you put any more people

[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.700]
on over the age of 100, it's going to, it's been nice knowing you.

[01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:20.740]
I mean, I know George Tuddy to put a lot of old people on the piss me off.

[01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:22.100]
It's really good to stir up the show.

[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:22.840]
Yeah, don't do it.

[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.960]
Don't put any old people on.

[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:26.780]
If they're, if they're over the age, if they're over the age of 400,

[01:18:26.980 --> 01:18:30.020]
if they sound like they got two feet in the box, don't put them on here, okay?

[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:30.700]
Okay.

[01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:31.580]
I'm going to say, hey, drop dead.

[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.640]
Oh, in some cases too late.

[01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:38.280]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18th here.

[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:39.700]
We're getting too many old people on the station.

[01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.840]
That's what Clarence is worried about.

[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.260]
The demos.

[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:42.640]
We got too many old people on the year.

[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:43.920]
Too many old people calling.

[01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:46.000]
And that's why we're not raising any money for a band and fair rescue.

[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:48.020]
The whole audience is about 100 years old now.

[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:50.740]
Here's Miami.

[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:51.060]
Hello.

[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:52.640]
Hey, and you're allowing my 20s?

[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.500]
I have heard.

[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:57.300]
First I got the Harry Skin people, kind of like Robin Williams.

[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.480]
When I see him on TV, I have to like, yeah, you know?

[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:00.740]
Harry Skin?

[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:01.800]
I mean, Harry people.

[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:06.180]
Yeah, like really Harry, like wherever you sit next to him, you feel like the little things coming off.

[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:09.780]
Yeah, you know the ones that really give me the ones that have like hair on their neck like the Wolfman?

[01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.120]
Yeah, like a lot of people like that.

[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:15.600]
Okay, how about the people that are full of like molds in their hands or they have like,

[01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.900]
lacerations on their skin and you're sitting on the table and they're like, ah, ah.

[01:19:21.140 --> 01:19:22.160]
That's all I got for your men.

[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.720]
Okay, Harry man, see you Harry.

[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.220]
When I was at the had lacerations and molds and puss and...

[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:28.900]
Oh, yeah.

[01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:30.780]
That's got a real puss.

[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:35.240]
And how about a little bit of that gang greenest puss, huh?

[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.260]
White green.

[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:38.640]
Gang greenest are us.

[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:40.480]
My life and love.

[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:42.820]
This is 4th radio by 60.

[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:45.240]
You ain't who I am.

[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.420]
Hey, hey, I'm Spidey.

[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:54.220]
And you know what I'm driving down Route 9W on a hot server day.

[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.840]
Me and the Mrs. always stop at Dickens.

[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:58.040]
Dickens Fruit State.

[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:04.620]
They've got everything for fruit, vegetables, homemade pies, but there is nothing like their cider.

[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.820]
Ain't that right, honey?

[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:07.760]
Dickens cider.

[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:08.780]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.520]
Why even though we were late for church last Sunday?

[01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.140]
She had to have a little dickens cider.

[01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:16.840]
She says there ain't nothing like it.

[01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:20.900]
Even my minister says this is why I've enjoyed a little dickens cider now and then.

[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.420]
Hey, why don't you bring some home and our protective plastic rib bottle?

[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.740]
That way it'll stay fresh.

[01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:29.780]
Or you can let it sit awhile and have some hard dickens cider.

[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.820]
It's good, it looks good and dinner.

[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.380]
And there's nothing like waking up with a dickens cider.

[01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:37.620]
Dickens Fruit State.

[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:40.580]
Just off Route 9W and country road 69.

[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:42.340]
Open 24 hours.

[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.640]
Because after a chillish summer night,

[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:48.620]
I like to snuggle up in bed with a hot dickens cider.

[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:49.760]
Um.

[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:52.540]
145.

[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.940]
How about ugly feet as the gross out says this fact?

[01:20:55.120 --> 01:20:55.500]
That's a good one.

[01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.240]
I like ugly feet.

[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.620]
I mean, I like ugly feet for the pool.

[01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.500]
I don't like ugly feet.

[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:01.520]
Damn, surprise you didn't put that on there since you're always worried about everybody's feet.

[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.180]
Right?

[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:03.260]
Even guys.

[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:04.840]
I am?

[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.000]
Yeah, don't you remember that guy from Whammy that we used to have?

[01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.220]
Whatever the hell his name was?

[01:21:10.160 --> 01:21:11.480]
Had those nasty feet.

[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:12.520]
You never stopped talking about it.

[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.600]
I was talking about it.

[01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:17.280]
What's your biggest gross out body order 55?

[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:24.060]
Jelly rolls of fat 42, bad breath 30, zits 7, bad wig 6, right here 3, sloppy clothes

[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:28.200]
to ugly nose to hairy people just went on there and ugly feet is going on any moment,

[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:28.780]
momentarily.

[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:32.640]
So nobody wants to talk to me about that thing about the skin pigment.

[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:34.800]
I've tried that a million times and nobody believes me.

[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:37.140]
Because a lot of people are very parochial in South Florida.

[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:39.080]
They've never been like the Palm Beach even.

[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.960]
And they don't, they don't realize that it's not just people who don't bathe,

[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:46.640]
who have like bad hygiene necessarily.

[01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:47.580]
Yeah.

[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:49.180]
Here's Del Ray.

[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:49.480]
Hello.

[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:51.360]
Hey Neil, what's going on?

[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:51.940]
Yes sir.

[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.500]
Yeah, the whole thing, the reason why you're not making any money on the abandoned pet rescue thing is

[01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:02.240]
you need to come down here, break out one of your core beds, go drive around and actually show up

[01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.960]
at these things and make some money.

[01:22:04.060 --> 01:22:09.040]
They don't want to see that stupid idiot you're sending out there and they want to see you.

[01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.820]
Let me ask you this question, okay, since you're the expert.

[01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:16.460]
How come in all the other years that we've been doing this other than a couple of appearances here in the pizza lock?

[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:19.260]
How come they always wanted to see the goofball then?

[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:20.420]
Okay, we've had no problem.

[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:24.480]
There's a money on our appearances and I never go to those things in addition to which they're doing the show.

[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.920]
How am I going to do that during the show?

[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.540]
Wow, you can do live remote.

[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.660]
You got that nice, big talent for you used to get.

[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:30.920]
Sir, had a great life.

[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:33.020]
What a moron.

[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:36.440]
See, another sad excuse for people who just don't want to help us out.

[01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:36.820]
That's all.

[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:37.860]
Well, they want to see you.

[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960]
It's got nothing to do with who they're seeing, whether it's Miguel,

[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:44.500]
whether it's some guy with big bad ugly feet, whether it's somebody with red hair and a purple puffs up,

[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:45.160]
pimple out his nose.

[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.460]
Yeah, that's got nothing to do with it.

[01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:48.560]
Maybe they had to do with here's the best in the LCD.

[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:49.720]
It's for a good cause.

[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.560]
Here's the Mohawar David and the keychain.

[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.020]
Here's the mad dog keychain.

[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:54.940]
Here's our stuff.

[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:57.500]
Okay, that's always been that way for like a zillion years, all right?

[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.340]
Maybe the next time you're in town, you can chart like a hundred dollars per person.

[01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:02.560]
I love the way that these people are such experts.

[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.360]
I should drive around town in my Corvette and they want to see me.

[01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:06.240]
They don't want to see me.

[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.460]
What do they need to see me for?

[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:10.060]
Okay, they got plenty of ugly, other ugly people they can see.

[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.220]
I want to see me.

[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.580]
What's that has to do with the price of peanuts to see you to tend to you?

[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:15.720]
I'm not coming down there.

[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.140]
Okay, if that's what it takes, I'll just send another check.

[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.400]
You follow what I'm saying?

[01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:26.780]
If we can raise another 10 grand by my being there, I'll just give the 10 grand to a band of pair rescues.

[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:27.340]
It's a great cause.

[01:23:27.540 --> 01:23:28.340]
I already gave 10 grand.

[01:23:28.620 --> 01:23:29.840]
How much you give so far, sir?

[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.220]
You schmuck, you little puzzle.

[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.380]
He gave us a scot and us putting the ages of the colors on here.

[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:40.800]
I mean, that's okay if the people don't mind, but I'm not talking to any more 95-year-old people.

[01:23:40.940 --> 01:23:41.640]
I won't do it.

[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.800]
It's boring, it's ponderous.

[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.140]
They all sound like they've got 40 pounds of flim in their throat or somewhere.

[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:48.400]
Maybe in their rectum.

[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.040]
Here's a call from Weston.

[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:51.280]
Hello.

[01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:54.180]
Weston.

[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.140]
Hey, this is Weston.

[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:56.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.020]
I'd like to see if I can contribute to your poll.

[01:23:59.480 --> 01:23:59.920]
Go right ahead.

[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:00.800]
All right.

[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:04.880]
A thing that grosses me out the most are May pops and summer teeth.

[01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:07.460]
May pops?

[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:10.440]
May pops are teeth that may pop out anytime.

[01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:17.840]
And summer teeth are teeth are summer there, summer here.

[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.320]
And summer all over the place.

[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.660]
That's it, that's it.

[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:20.880]
That's it.

[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.100]
That's it.

[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:21.860]
That's a good choice.

[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.360]
That's it.

[01:24:23.740 --> 01:24:24.740]
Okay, it'll gross out.

[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:25.640]
Well, stand about.

[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.900]
That's it.

[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:30.300]
All right.

[01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.100]
Bad teeth.

[01:24:31.200 --> 01:24:32.240]
I was going to put yellow teeth.

[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.140]
But the bad teeth is more than all of them.

[01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:35.780]
The more it comes, the really crooked ones are bucked teeth.

[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:36.540]
Yeah.

[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:38.860]
Bad teeth is good.

[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.020]
Fieset and it's like I started to say to him, but he wasn't listening.

[01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:44.260]
Don't go to England, man, because they all got bad teeth.

[01:24:44.380 --> 01:24:46.260]
They got nasty, nasty yellow.

[01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:48.120]
And they go like in all different directions.

[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.740]
56670560, Palm 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:55.800]
How's Miguel DeWanana, a dream car South 174 or 3 South

[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:58.220]
thinks he had a highway where he'll be the one with a QM van

[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.560]
for a band at Perrescue.

[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.640]
He was ringing the phone, but I didn't catch it fast enough.

[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.160]
And in addition to which, let me say this, I guarantee you that most

[01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.560]
of the people in this audience, male, female and indifferent,

[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.360]
would a hell of a lot rather see Miguel than see me any day of the week.

[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.220]
I know I sure would.

[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:12.460]
I believe me.

[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:13.540]
That's two of us.

[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:14.800]
Hey, that's great.

[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.560]
Okay, it's unanimous.

[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.080]
Let's hear it.

[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:21.140]
We all would rather see Miguel, even the head of rose down there for claimed ones.

[01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:27.180]
56670560, Palm 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:29.460]
Here's a Pemberk Pine.

[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:29.760]
Hello.

[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.040]
Neil.

[01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:31.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:25:31.980 --> 01:25:32.540]
How you doing, sir?

[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:33.220]
Pretty good.

[01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:33.820]
Good, good.

[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:35.380]
I just want to contribute to your poll.

[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.780]
I work with public in the medical field.

[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.480]
And what grosses me out is, I'm trying to talk to people with stuff under

[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.980]
the tree, birds, saliva, food all over the place.

[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:49.540]
And when you look at them, the side of you, there's like a little wax build up in

[01:25:49.540 --> 01:25:51.720]
that ear canal and it's just waiting to fall off.

[01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:52.820]
I hate that.

[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:54.940]
Very gross and very nasty.

[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:55.960]
Have a good time.

[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.340]
How do we define that?

[01:25:58.900 --> 01:25:59.280]
I don't know.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:00.360]
He's a bad height.

[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:00.940]
The red ones?

[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:04.360]
No, seriously.

[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:05.440]
How do we define that?

[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:07.860]
Sloppy.

[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:08.360]
I don't know.

[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:08.920]
Sloppy face.

[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:09.380]
Slop.

[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:11.500]
That's a good one.

[01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.780]
Sloppy can be like jelly rolls.

[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.000]
Oh, I know.

[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:14.420]
You consider it as a slop.

[01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:17.060]
Sort of with sloppy clothes as a slop.

[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.300]
Thirty days.

[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:19.680]
Thirty push.

[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:21.700]
That's true.

[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.460]
That's why I hate to throw it out.

[01:26:23.620 --> 01:26:23.740]
Yeah.

[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:26.360]
Oh, there's nothing worse than the old, dirty push.

[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:32.900]
Oh, like this.

[01:26:34.460 --> 01:26:35.960]
Oh, she's just cleaning her's out.

[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.040]
Five.

[01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:39.820]
Five, six, seven, and the death.

[01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:42.980]
She just forgot the pan.

[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:44.720]
The man, one of those little tucks.

[01:26:44.860 --> 01:26:45.540]
She forgot the tucks.

[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:48.520]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, six, the pound fights.

[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.560]
This keeps getting worse, don't it?

[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:50.400]
Yeah.

[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.080]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:52.400]
Hello.

[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:54.400]
Yeah.

[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:55.500]
Miami, yes, sir.

[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:57.880]
Talking about a dirty person.

[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:59.660]
I'm about a, from Monday cheese.

[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:02.500]
How about what?

[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:03.940]
From Monday cheese.

[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:06.500]
Conchie, dickweed.

[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.080]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60 pound, five, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.580]
And for Ryze and Lan, I'm sure you did.

[01:27:17.140 --> 01:27:17.540]
What?

[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.580]
First your teeth this morning.

[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:23.540]
Yes, I did.

[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:26.440]
Here's Boyton Beach.

[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:27.600]
Hey, there.

[01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:27.960]
How you doing?

[01:27:28.300 --> 01:27:28.580]
Okay.

[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:31.440]
Just put the vernacular under overall bad hygiene.

[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.060]
I've worked in the medical field too.

[01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.720]
It's bad hygiene.

[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:40.100]
The overall bad hygiene.

[01:27:40.520 --> 01:27:44.160]
Yeah, but the one that also include like body odor is part of bad hygiene, but not necessarily.

[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:50.080]
Now, do you know what I'm talking about with people who have like a bone body or all of their skin?

[01:27:50.380 --> 01:27:52.380]
You know what I'm from depending on where they're from in the world?

[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.060]
Maybe a little bit of leprosy, a little bit of claste falling off.

[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.100]
No, seriously.

[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:57.980]
I see no, you people don't believe me.

[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:58.700]
It's the truth.

[01:27:59.140 --> 01:27:59.880]
You don't believe it.

[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:02.540]
It's an Asian thing mostly.

[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.080]
Well, okay, yeah, you're right.

[01:28:07.180 --> 01:28:10.600]
And that last guy, he did kind of steal my thunderbolt working in the medical field.

[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.520]
It's rough.

[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.620]
No, we're talking about meeting somebody or just the day-to-day operations.

[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.220]
Yeah, you're just in your life as you meet people or deal with people.

[01:28:21.340 --> 01:28:22.320]
I mean, just do it every day.

[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:24.340]
You know, it's really hard to hear you.

[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.560]
The level on this phone.

[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:27.460]
Can you get them to check your voice up at all?

[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.280]
Probably not.

[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.340]
I could barely hear you.

[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:29.840]
I can hear you.

[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:31.300]
You sound like you're right next door.

[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.820]
Well, it's a good phone.

[01:28:32.980 --> 01:28:33.800]
I guess on my side.

[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:34.660]
But I have to be happy.

[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:35.720]
Anyway, I'm going to be part of this.

[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.000]
Anyway, I'm going to be part of this.

[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.140]
His jacket right now is a matter of fact.

[01:28:38.380 --> 01:28:39.480]
Okay, thanks a lot, Kelly.

[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:40.960]
And again, good luck to you.

[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:41.580]
I don't know.

[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:43.180]
Did anybody else complain about they can't hear me?

[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:43.640]
No.

[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:44.360]
No.

[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.460]
Well, maybe it's just that his phone is crap.

[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:46.880]
I don't know.

[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.460]
I heard him like he was sitting right next door.

[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:48.940]
No, boom.

[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:49.900]
Blame me again.

[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.040]
Hey, Scott, if you all about how about Dan Ruff?

[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:54.300]
Okay.

[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:55.400]
Huh?

[01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:56.660]
That's small potatoes, but sure.

[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:58.260]
What do you mean a small potatoes?

[01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.000]
I'm not just talking about your ordinary pedestrian.

[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.440]
Oh, I know you're talking about them.

[01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:04.840]
I'm talking about people have like flaky, a flaky, like all over the place.

[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:10.400]
You know, winter wonderland, like in the eyebrows, you know, and the eyelashes and it, oh,

[01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:16.740]
oh, ears, your dad reminds me of my old friend Bob Desbecker from Midtown Records in Rochester.

[01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.260]
Josh Friedman had ear dandruff.

[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:20.560]
He had body dandruff.

[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.980]
He had dandruff from head to toe, Josh Friedman, and smelled of all the part.

[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.680]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the 18th.

[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.780]
You got some good news for you.

[01:29:31.620 --> 01:29:33.100]
Speaking of old people, yeah.

[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:35.940]
Florida's senior citizens lose break on current urnces.

[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:37.040]
The crash rate rises.

[01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.440]
Oh, what a concept.

[01:29:40.080 --> 01:29:42.960]
Florida's oldest and youngest drivers now have something in common.

[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.780]
Both groups can complain about high insurance rates as the Sun Sentinel.

[01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:51.300]
For years, older residents enjoyed pre-wims at or below base rates as they had a reputation

[01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:54.040]
for being among the safest drivers in the world on a road.

[01:29:54.040 --> 01:29:57.700]
Oh, now, what is this supposed to be like a comedy column or what?

[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:04.040]
That started changing a few years ago as insurance carriers started realizing that

[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:08.220]
actually the rates and claims began increasing once drivers passed their 70th birthday.

[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:13.320]
In fact, the age 85 plus group has almost identical rates of property damage claims as the

[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:18.220]
drivers in the 16 to 19-year-old group occurred to an insurance institute for highway safety report issued earlier this year.

[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:22.400]
We're a little slow in Florida, but they're finally starting to catch on that the people over the age of 100

[01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.180]
probably shouldn't be out there driving around like in my mother's neighborhood.

[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.300]
The statistics show that much older drivers have accident rates that rival teenagers.

[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:36.360]
So we have to charge our premium for the risk for assuming said Robert Hartworth, chief economist for the insurance

[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:39.860]
information Institute a non-profit research group for the insurance industry.

[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:45.300]
The result is that while many foreridings of all ages have seen automobile increases since 2000.

[01:30:45.540 --> 01:30:48.840]
Insurance drivers in their 70s, 80s probably got hit with an extra 10 or 15 percent.

[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.640]
Get them off the road.

[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:50.660]
Get them off the road.

[01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:51.480]
You morons.

[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.320]
You idiots.

[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:52.800]
Okay.

[01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:53.780]
Echmer estate.

[01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:54.280]
Florida.

[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.060]
They got people.

[01:30:56.160 --> 01:30:58.100]
You ought to see what goes on around my mother's place.

[01:30:58.200 --> 01:30:59.340]
I'm sure you've seen that kind of platform.

[01:30:59.340 --> 01:30:59.800]
Of course they're.

[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:00.200]
You're kidding.

[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:00.900]
Every day.

[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:05.560]
Jesus, God, all my other reason why I shouldn't be there every week that I go to lunch and add place.

[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.320]
It's like taking your freaking life in your hands.

[01:31:07.660 --> 01:31:11.920]
They're sitting with her hands reaching as high as they go and just barely making a bottom of the steering wheel.

[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:14.920]
And the best part of it is they're already sitting on three-gradam telephone books.

[01:31:15.340 --> 01:31:15.560]
Yeah.

[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.340]
They think the lines on the road are a suggestion.

[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:21.420]
And these are the people, by the way, who this week are all getting near a six-year renewal in the May.

[01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:21.620]
Right?

[01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.160]
You know the ones who are deaf and dumb and blind and the amputees.

[01:31:25.240 --> 01:31:26.660]
I'll just minor things like that.

[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.300]
Lines are going to look all the way to the 60s, 560s.

[01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:31.760]
The rain is on your hands.

[01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:33.820]
You am.

[01:31:36.740 --> 01:31:37.540]
I'm coming.

[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:38.900]
Well, congratulations.

[01:31:39.260 --> 01:31:39.660]
Get a light.

[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.720]
89 on 5.

[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:46.680]
Join the original cast of All in the Family, Dad and the Lion in the Primero.

[01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:49.000]
You can't do that no more.

[01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:50.180]
Where are going to keep hunting?

[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:51.400]
Where are helping them, Dad?

[01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:53.160]
Does anybody don't like that?

[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:53.920]
Bring them on.

[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:54.700]
That's right, Dad.

[01:31:54.760 --> 01:31:54.940]
That's right.

[01:31:55.020 --> 01:31:57.740]
You tell them, George, he's going to give them camel chatties to lick and dig a story.

[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:22.340]
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.600]
I can't argue with somebody, I think I'll go nuts!

[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:28.100]
Hey, hey, I, I, I'm glad to see you.

[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:31.320]
Glad to see me. Why, I, haven't had a good argument today.

[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.620]
Just got to ask this out. Yeah. What are you thinking at George T. Bush?

[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.980]
I think George Bush is the most wonderful president this country I've ever had. Why?

[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:41.680]
I think I'm going to take liberal fact, that's why.

[01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:45.080]
You can't do that no more.

[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:47.900]
You're denied on Woofertburg.spots.

[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:51.320]
Come on two at five sixty, W. I didn't play the, I knew in the one hour.

[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:53.720]
I didn't realize that's moving along so fast. I didn't do that.

[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.820]
Well, it's not too late. It's never too late to play the new one. Am I very favorite?

[01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.340]
I hate to admit that this one's my favorite. It's...

[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:04.760]
This is Mark Morgan. It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q.A.M.

[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:08.800]
I get sexual assignment from that one. He says Q.A.M. I just, you know, like a library.

[01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:12.560]
Anyway, somebody said, uh, it's faxed us in and how could we forget tattoos?

[01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:14.060]
If I could change my vote, I would.

[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:20.460]
So you read here just, ooh, the caratoc kind of read here just really, uh, I find offensive.

[01:33:20.460 --> 01:33:22.900]
I can't help it. It just makes me cringe.

[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:27.020]
But tattoos, and I'm not just talking about like a little nice neat tattoo, you know.

[01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.420]
I'm talking about people who are like covered with tattoos.

[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:35.060]
Grosses me out. That's far enough of it. If I could change my vote, I would.

[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:35.700]
You don't agree?

[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:42.220]
It's like intense. No, I don't like them, but they can be really ugly like you said or they can be.

[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:42.500]
But they can't. They can't. They can't. They can't.

[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.220]
It's definitely point of the sky and say, it's playing.

[01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:45.960]
I think that's kind of cute. He's right.

[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:48.220]
Can't stand it.

[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. How's Miguel doing?

[01:33:52.940 --> 01:33:52.940]

[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.360]
That's in the first hour. Right. 120 bucks.

[01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:14.520]
I'm here. I know. That was just. I'm just. What?

[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.620]
I'm just. I'm just. I'm just.

[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:16.900]
I'm already depressed. Okay.

[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:22.580]
It's been. I haven't got with this briefly.

[01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.740]
Making a cameo appearance on the show last few weeks.

[01:34:25.980 --> 01:34:28.160]
Last hit Iraqi sex cinema.

[01:34:29.460 --> 01:34:34.600]
An explosion is ripped through a cinema in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul killing two people and injuring up to 20 others.

[01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:38.460]
The cinema was showing a pornographic film at the time of the explosion with us.

[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:39.400]
It's a score. It's court.

[01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:43.280]
Islamic militants are known to oppose what they call a moral movie.

[01:34:43.280 --> 01:34:47.140]
It's an attack. Some cinemas in a post-war Iraq for showing them earlier yesterday.

[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:53.660]
Remotely detonated bomb left in central Baghdad roadside destroyed two commuter buses killing one Iraqi and injuring 22 others.

[01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:03.240]
The BBC's Carolyn Hawley in Baghdad says the showing of porn films since the fall of Saddam Hussein has infuriated religious leaders in the country.

[01:35:03.700 --> 01:35:08.740]
Restrictions on the import of foreign films including pornography ended after the collapse of the former leaders regime.

[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:15.020]
Religious and political groups have distributed flyers warning theater owners not to show films of a sexual nature.

[01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:17.120]
Oi! How do you like that?

[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.680]
It is a little jerko under the burka, you think?

[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.740]
5667-0560-560 on the AT&T 120 bucks in the first hour at Vincar South.

[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:36.960]
It's not even worth his effort. He could like get pocket change. 120 bucks.

[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:39.740]
Here's a call from Bokeh. Hello.

[01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.840]
Hey Neil. Yes sir.

[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:47.160]
Great show. I wanted to tell you that J. Feetler was on the Mo Show this morning.

[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:52.840]
Yeah. Missing some of your mo bits on the ginger and mo song and that other one you have.

[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:53.860]
I wonder if you could play it.

[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.340]
Sometimes you showed it today.

[01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:02.160]
You were missing the connection here. J. Feetler was on the show this morning.

[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:04.740]
He is every Thursday morning at 6.45 a.m.

[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.600]
And I hadn't heard your J. Feetler songs in a while.

[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.460]
Do any of you have any mo bits on the ginger and mo reunion?

[01:36:13.900 --> 01:36:15.200]
Yeah. The ginger and mo reunion.

[01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:16.300]
The other one you have?

[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.400]
What does J. Feetler have to do with the ginger and mo reunion?

[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.120]
You say that doesn't he dream of being in bed with Feetler?

[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.360]
He is my friend. Yeah. I guess that's in his somewhere.

[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:28.240]
Okay. Whatever you say pal. Have a great day.

[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.100]
Like that. Don't you want to go just like that?

[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.480]
Oh all the time. I sure do.

[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.940]
Know what the hell that I have to do with the price of peanuts in Peoria?

[01:36:39.180 --> 01:36:40.860]
Or the way people smell and Augusta's main?

[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:41.560]
I don't know.

[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:47.420]
But hey, not for me to ask. Just continue rolling right along listening to all of this.

[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.100]
Just spewed them. Here's a call from Dear Field. Hello.

[01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:54.580]
Yeah. Hey. Oh man. I'm so long. It's hot and thriving.

[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:56.880]
Hey, babe.

[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:59.620]
How about you, buddy? I work with...

[01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:05.440]
I work with Pakistan and Indian people through jewelry shows and they're digging porkers.

[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:11.740]
We go around the country and I play at 18 more curry and more garlic.

[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:12.620]
Yeah.

[01:37:14.140 --> 01:37:17.900]
Then God ever made and they just ooze it out.

[01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.180]
Who's it all day? They ooze it out.

[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:20.760]
Oh God.

[01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:25.760]
But they're Americanized. They're from here.

[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:29.680]
They don't even eat whatever Americano food.

[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:32.040]
They eat the things loaded and it stinks.

[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.500]
And they keep doing the whole show stinks.

[01:37:35.060 --> 01:37:36.480]
Just like walking into a hotel.

[01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:39.000]
When a little dump hotel is what you don't...

[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:40.780]
You're not slumber like me. So you don't go to those.

[01:37:41.040 --> 01:37:44.820]
But it's just like when you walk into a lobby, one of those places.

[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.760]
That's what those shows smell like and they love it.

[01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:50.900]
And in fact, another thing.

[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:52.340]
Hey.

[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:54.740]
Don't go to the show.

[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:01.080]
I mean, don't go to the wherever McGow is because Hayden McGow might be changed.

[01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:03.100]
And...

[01:38:03.100 --> 01:38:03.560]
What?

[01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:06.220]
I have no idea. I have no idea.

[01:38:06.340 --> 01:38:09.680]
It must be the moon maybe in your rain.

[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:10.300]
It's all in here.

[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.520]
Why stop now? We're having such a good time.

[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:17.080]
Oh, look at this. For Thursday, Duff asked if he would read this.

[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:18.060]
Actually.

[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:20.940]
He asked me to ask you if he would read that.

[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:24.900]
He asked Doreen to ask you if I would read this.

[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:30.360]
Pharrell will be out there hosting the Wilder Party and Wilder Son of Zirka.

[01:38:32.040 --> 01:38:33.460]
The QM Prize Patrol.

[01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.160]
The Lunar artists, fans, QM...

[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.360]
Well, what does this have to do with anything?

[01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.300]
You go, you read it.

[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.100]
Yeah.

[01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:46.520]
I mean, for as much as they do for our efforts, what is this all about?

[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:47.480]
They don't do anything to worry.

[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.960]
Like you said, to me, just the other day.

[01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:53.680]
If we have a thing in the afternoon and somebody's out there with our merchandise,

[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:55.660]
they don't read it. They do it on the updates.

[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:57.980]
Ken does it. But as far as on the shows, they don't do it.

[01:38:58.380 --> 01:38:59.800]
So when we get to the updates, we'll read it.

[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:00.200]
Okay.

[01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:01.480]
Do we have any updates?

[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:02.780]
No.

[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:10.240]
I just find this grotesque and ridiculous has nothing to do with anything.

[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.740]
And if people want to start promoting our thing and get involved, that's great.

[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:16.520]
Then we'll all play the game together.

[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:18.420]
Please promote as much as possible.

[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:19.620]
No, the answer is...

[01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:20.000]
No. No.

[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:22.100]
We talked about that the other day, George and I.

[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:22.980]
And the answer is no.

[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:26.180]
I don't want to play a hard ball, but let's play a hard ball with or without Chris Matthews.

[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.620]
You know, what's good for the goose is good for the game.

[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:30.560]
Are they used this show and used this show?

[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:32.920]
Oh, please do this and please do that again.

[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:34.900]
And they promise to climb 85 million mentions.

[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.960]
But in the meantime, anything we're doing, they don't camp you bother with it.

[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:38.160]
No.

[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:39.320]
So the answer is...

[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:39.480]
No.

[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:44.600]
Now, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.980]
What's your biggest gross out?

[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:47.580]
And we're just talking about, like, generally.

[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:49.220]
I mean, it's not that difficult to understand.

[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:53.340]
You know, when you go to lunch, when you're in the elevator, when you're like walking around in a shopping mall,

[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:55.820]
when you're a jaywalking and almost getting hit in the middle of the street,

[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.980]
what's the biggest gross out of who you encounter and see during your life?

[01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:00.780]
Body odor 81.

[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:02.940]
And they still don't understand that.

[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:03.920]
They're never going to get it right.

[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:05.580]
Out of 217.

[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.320]
Jelly rolls of Fat 49.

[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:08.500]
Bad breath 46.

[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:09.480]
Zits 10.

[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:11.280]
Bad wig 8.

[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:13.020]
Bad teeth 8.

[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:14.520]
Harry people 4.

[01:40:15.380 --> 01:40:17.260]
See, I could, I mean, Harry people.

[01:40:17.380 --> 01:40:17.520]
Ooh.

[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.900]
Sloppy clothing 3.

[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:20.720]
Ugly feet 3.

[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.540]
Red hair 3.

[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:22.440]
Ugly nose 2.

[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.780]
And tattoo is not there yet for some very, very strange reason.

[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.340]
I said it.

[01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:28.120]
Tattoos in Dandruff.

[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.320]
Neither one of them are in there yet.

[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:30.260]
Oh, I didn't know we were doing that.

[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:31.220]
Why not?

[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:32.980]
I thought we were just talking.

[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.820]
What do you mean you didn't know it?

[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:35.360]
You went through a whole long reaction to that.

[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.980]
You were talking about the eyebrows and about the falling leaves and all the other crap.

[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:44.760]
Wunder a lot of stress because Miguel is acting up.

[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:46.340]
See, it used to be Eric that was acting up.

[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:46.800]
Now it's Miguel.

[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.800]
I think Miguel is probably like just making this up.

[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:50.800]
He probably wasn't about 1500.

[01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:54.540]
And he's just calling in low ball numbers just to aggravate me.

[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:56.780]
120 bucks in the first hour.

[01:40:57.140 --> 01:40:58.500]
He's only there to one o'clock, folks.

[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.880]
All you people in South-Aid, you were clamoring and said,

[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:03.700]
I had several calls this week for the van to go into that area.

[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.440]
Do we believe him?

[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:04.600]
No.

[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:06.440]
He's probably got a hot date down there, some bitch.

[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.740]
174.03 South-Dixie highway.

[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:11.920]
Look for the QM van.

[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.020]
Pick up your stuff.

[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:13.780]
Give us some cash.

[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:14.720]
And let's go already.

[01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:18.080]
I told you, I could see the hand writing on a wall and this thing.

[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:19.920]
And you're saying, oh no, no problem.

[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:21.080]
Over here is 100 grand this year.

[01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:22.560]
We'll be lucky to get to a...

[01:41:22.560 --> 01:41:23.360]
Fuck, third man.

[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:23.680]
Yeah.

[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:24.420]
That's right.

[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.960]
And I still don't have any number on what we got.

[01:41:28.480 --> 01:41:28.920]
We will.

[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:29.860]
Here's a call from Davey.

[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:30.060]
Hello.

[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:31.620]
Hello?

[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:32.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:36.580]
Yeah, I'll just have a bandage test rescue now.

[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.040]
Excuse me for being here.

[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:40.720]
Oh, where have we chosen to do a new voice?

[01:41:41.860 --> 01:41:42.680]
Here's North Miami.

[01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:43.060]
Hello.

[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.280]
Hello?

[01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:45.100]
Yes, sir.

[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:45.920]
Oh, hi, Neil.

[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:47.140]
I didn't know I was on.

[01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:48.020]
Yeah.

[01:41:48.260 --> 01:41:52.620]
One of the things that really grosses me out is when I see people sticking their fingers up there

[01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:55.940]
noses and moving it around like they're panning for gold.

[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:56.920]
No, it's pickers.

[01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:57.780]
No, it's pickers.

[01:41:57.820 --> 01:42:00.760]
I mean, there's some big fat fingers out there and I'm trying to...

[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:04.720]
I see them just up to that joint where you bend your finger and I'm going to wear it.

[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:07.420]
Looks like they're reaching to see if their brain is where it used to be right.

[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.120]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:42:08.300 --> 01:42:12.260]
And then they are praising like they're trying to get the value of a diamond or something.

[01:42:12.420 --> 01:42:13.120]
It's like ridiculous.

[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.060]
Yeah, but you'd be laughing.

[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:17.680]
They'd be laughing in a rest of the actually plucked one out of there, wouldn't you?

[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.880]
Well, I tried not to get to that point.

[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.740]
I mean, it's like looking at rippings, believe it or not, you're curious.

[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:25.540]
But then when they get to that point, what is coming out, I have to turn away.

[01:42:25.940 --> 01:42:26.260]
Exactly.

[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:27.360]
I'm on with you, man.

[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:27.920]
Thanks a lot.

[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:28.480]
Okay, now.

[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.360]
Noes pickers.

[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.860]
And of course, then the noes pickers who also are chewing it in public.

[01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:34.140]
You know, it's one thing that you chew it in private, but not in public.

[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.580]
Sometimes they look like a gummy bear.

[01:42:40.740 --> 01:42:43.060]
Oh, there's nothing like good crusty snot, man.

[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.100]
Oh, boy.

[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.800]
Thanks for a really low-cal low-curve snack.

[01:42:47.660 --> 01:42:47.980]
What?

[01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:49.640]
Happens to be true.

[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:51.160]
You know what I mean by crusty, don't you?

[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:52.180]
Oh, you're exactly what I mean.

[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:52.600]
Absolutely.

[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.140]
Pulls hairs out with it when...

[01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:54.900]
No, no, not my...

[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:55.660]
I don't pull no one.

[01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:56.020]
Noes here.

[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.920]
60 or 82 say body odor, and they don't understand it's the parochial nature of soft

[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.840]
Florida, which is supposed to be a world-class city.

[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:05.000]
They're always telling me.

[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.580]
Nobody ever gets out of town.

[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.200]
They like to, but they just can't get nowhere.

[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:12.680]
Body odor 82, bad breath 49, jelly rolls of fat 49.

[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.420]
I got my roll in my hand right now.

[01:43:14.540 --> 01:43:16.120]
Maybe I got a big jelly roll.

[01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.380]
I can pinch you about a foot.

[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.180]
You rolling it, rolling it around.

[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.440]
I like to be rolling it.

[01:43:21.020 --> 01:43:24.780]
Zits 11, bad teeth 9, bad wig 8, hairy people 4.

[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:29.240]
We're talking really hairy people that have hair just like all over like the hockey player

[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:29.840]
John Cullen.

[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:33.060]
He had hair like all the way up to like his chin.

[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:34.960]
Remember John Cullen?

[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:35.380]
No.

[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.920]
Had that battle with cancer, had a retire.

[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.920]
Good guy, John Cullen.

[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:39.160]
I think he's hoping still alive.

[01:43:39.660 --> 01:43:43.980]
Hairy people for red hair 3, sloppy clothes 3 and ugly nose 2.

[01:43:44.100 --> 01:43:46.260]
Luke Robota also has the same things big and hockey players.

[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:48.060]
I bet you even Scott knows who the hell that is.

[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:48.960]
He's a whoos.

[01:43:52.580 --> 01:43:55.740]
You know what's that time of the year again when a mattress showrooms and furniture stores

[01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:57.080]
run their phony and sales.

[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:00.600]
Dolomatris asks you if you double the price and then offer half off what kind of a deal

[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.000]
is that?

[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:02.420]
Bogus it sounds like to me.

[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:05.960]
Fact is that these stores have got to run some kind of a sale to drop their prices even

[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.320]
close to as low as the prices Dolomatris charges each and every day 365 days a year.

[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:15.740]
For discount prices on dozens of models from C. Lee's shirt at Tempropidic Simmons King

[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.260]
guy into a whole new lifestyle.

[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:42.980]
It's single eye for the married guy.

[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:47.200]
First of all, Steve, this is totally unacceptable.

[01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.160]
One should never leave the toilet seat there.

[01:45:50.160 --> 01:45:55.300]
But my wife prefers that if he's a sh**, he's a sh**.

[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:02.120]
Watch the free five designers of single eye for the married guy, help Steve in the kitchen.

[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:04.240]
Steve, Steve, what are you doing, dude?

[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.560]
I'm just pouring myself a glass of milk and...

[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:07.560]
Yeah, hold here.

[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:11.180]
Single guys drink straight from the carton man like this.

[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:13.280]
Oh my goodness.

[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:23.700]
The single eye for the married guy team even gives Steve a down and dirty lesson in decorating.

[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:27.480]
What are all these dirty clothes doing in the hamper?

[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:32.240]
Try flinging them around the house for a look that says a single guy lives here.

[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:35.620]
Guys, when my wife gets home...

[01:46:35.620 --> 01:46:37.120]
You won't be here, Steve.

[01:46:37.460 --> 01:46:38.740]
Grab a handful of dollar bills.

[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:41.240]
We're going to the strip world!

[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:45.240]
Okay, single eye for the married guy.

[01:46:45.440 --> 01:46:45.980]
Do it in.

[01:46:46.140 --> 01:46:48.660]
That is hippie old Paul and chain doesn't mind.

[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:51.200]
From 19 to 560 W.

[01:46:51.340 --> 01:46:54.400]
I don't see a Dan Draft head to his ornals pickers on the podium.

[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.400]
I've sent him mention that.

[01:46:55.780 --> 01:46:55.860]
Huh?

[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:57.680]
Are you picking on Eric again?

[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:57.900]
No.

[01:46:58.020 --> 01:46:58.680]
Are you picking it just saying?

[01:46:59.220 --> 01:46:59.660]
340.

[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:00.080]
What?

[01:47:00.980 --> 01:47:02.060]
340, by the way.

[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:05.460]
Well, that's a big improvement, 340.

[01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:08.380]
But we ain't going to get nowhere near a thousand bucks.

[01:47:08.460 --> 01:47:11.320]
See, he did make a good point and that is that it used to be like two years ago.

[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:14.880]
Of course, we didn't do one last year because of lack of interest all the way around, I guess.

[01:47:15.540 --> 01:47:18.720]
But it used to be he'd go out there to corner of sunrise and...

[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.900]
Like, grab a bowl of our university.

[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:21.340]
That's why I picked that a couple of days ago.

[01:47:21.660 --> 01:47:24.120]
And always was like $1,500 or whatever guaranteed.

[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:28.040]
Now you think since we didn't do one last year and this is the best of two years of the country.

[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.640]
Right, this is covering two years.

[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:31.160]
The two thousand, two thousand, two thousand.

[01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.620]
And then, three, it's got the Mickey and Eisner bits a couple of them.

[01:47:33.660 --> 01:47:36.500]
It's got the Michael Jackson Tommy Motolia bit.

[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.620]
It's got Fadass Rosie and Pearl Wings.

[01:47:38.780 --> 01:47:38.780]

[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:39.060]
Unplaced.

[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:42.080]
Versus the Toa Yard complaint with a big turd in the back of her car.

[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.740]
It's got the Ginger and Gay, Mo Gay Union that they got one of the here which I'll play eventually.

[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:48.140]
Hey, what is Gosselin Gay, huh?

[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:49.600]
Want to hear the new promo we have for it?

[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.040]

[01:47:50.300 --> 01:47:50.960]
Not yet played.

[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:52.500]
Yeah.

[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.120]
Okay.

[01:47:53.420 --> 01:47:54.500]
Fire it off, Scott, if you can.

[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.800]
Neil Rogers, 2003.

[01:47:58.080 --> 01:47:58.960]
Best of Neil CDs.

[01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:02.100]
If you can, I find a song about the wreck.

[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.140]
If the markets are a drama, bomb a wreck.

[01:48:07.620 --> 01:48:09.060]
And how we gave it key chains.

[01:48:09.740 --> 01:48:14.320]

[01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.460]

[01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:26.420]
Hey, Marlon's fans and tanks tonight's game.

[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:28.740]
Don't forget to stop by Gage E starting at 5 p.m.

[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:31.220]
See, it's called tit for tat.

[01:48:31.980 --> 01:48:32.580]
Who's tat?

[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:34.400]
I don't think he always hit it.

[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:36.840]
They are going to promote us and our thing, the rest of the day fine.

[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:37.920]
And then I'll promote this thing.

[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:39.000]
But otherwise, this is screw.

[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:44.060]
Anyway, Ferral will be out there 5 p.m. at Gage E at the PP Park tonight hosting the Wildest Party at.

[01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:45.240]
And it'll be on Fox Sportsnet.

[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:52.460]
And the wildest fan showing his or her two colors will join Billy de Marlon along with the Mermaid's in Ferral for a wild ride on his boat.

[01:48:52.460 --> 01:48:58.580]
During the game, the wild ride on his something and get tickets to Saturday's game along with other Marlon's merchandise.

[01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:03.740]
The QM prize betwe'll be on hand passing out 560 WQM wild cards, whatever those are.

[01:49:03.980 --> 01:49:09.540]
There will be a balloon artist making custom Marlon theme balloons for the kids that stop by Gage E QM promo booth.

[01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:10.820]
And fans can come by.

[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.380]
This is written very poorly, by the way.

[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.520]
I sure hope muff didn't write this.

[01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:18.940]
Fans can come by to QM promo booth and get their bodies painted showing their two Marlon's colors on your front-running phone.

[01:49:18.940 --> 01:49:22.560]
All I've got tonight is starting at 5 p.m. at Gage E at PP Park.

[01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.420]
See? Asking you'll get it if you wear a shimmer also a little bit. We'll shimmer your back.

[01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:28.220]
If you ignore us, we'll ignore you.

[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.580]
That's the way it works, muff. Okay, no cry over spilt milk.

[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:35.240]
Anyway, guess what Congress is doing with great, eliquity and speed today.

[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.020]
You know, this is the same Congress that drags their feet and can't get anything done.

[01:49:39.340 --> 01:49:43.280]
And things go on and on forever like medical care and all this other stuff. Yeah.

[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.100]
Votes are taking place that you showed a moment ago on CNN.

[01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:55.940]
Votes are taking place in the House and Senate today to grant the Federal Trade Commission an explicit authority to create a national do not call list for telemarketers.

[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:02.740]
The quick action comes today after the Federal Judge ruled the FTC overstep its congressional mandate to create the wildly popular list.

[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:13.260]
See when 50 million people sign up for this thing and make it overwhelming that they don't want to be bothered by all these grave robbers who are desperate for some kind of a bogus job to bother with 15, 20, 30 times a day in a party.

[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:16.860]
If you're going to be in the privacy of our home on our own private phone, then they say, oh, yeah, we can get that.

[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:21.380]
And I noticed on the voter was like unanimous. If you are clear, if you got C span there, because I don't have it.

[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.260]
I got it. I don't know what channel it is. Well, find it. I'll find it.

[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:30.920]
And you'll see the vote. I guarantee nobody will vote against it. It'll be unanimous.

[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:36.240]
And they're going to get it over to the Senate this afternoon. And they're going to get on the president's desk today.

[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:43.200]
And the president is going to sign it and the new list will still take place when we're supposed to take a fact next Wednesday, October 1.

[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:47.400]
I was expected before that judge to stuck a monkey wrench in a whole damn thing. That monkey judge.

[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:55.000]
There it is. You got it. What's the vote? 117 Republicans say yay. 85 Democrats say yay. One independent says yay.

[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:02.240]
Anybody say 29 to 29 to 226. What is it? The totals. The total yeas 209.

[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.580]
Total. Oh, I see. What's envy? No vote. Yeah. 224.

[01:51:08.940 --> 01:51:14.480]
I haven't voted. Well, we don't need that. That means I haven't voted yet. How many nays? How many nays? None nays.

[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:22.640]
I told you. I told you. No, no. 50 million people speak. They say, OK, we'll get it done. Maybe right now. Right now.

[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:29.760]
You just watch how fast we can move. When 50 million people get pissed off and fired up because there's...

[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:34.720]
And then they had these poor, these fat trailer trash on her yesterday. Well, they're going to take away our livelihood.

[01:51:35.080 --> 01:51:39.560]
There's like a million of us. But you know what? Go get a real job. OK. Paper or plastic.

[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:47.560]
Would you like fries with that? Go get a real job. Kind of fries. Oh, I like them. We're crinkly ones with the skins on them.

[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:54.640]
Where does that. Arby's. Arby. Oh, man. I do like that. And Arby's made a comeback. I want to apologize for the terrible things I said about them last year.

[01:51:54.640 --> 01:52:00.380]
Although at the time it was probably appropriate, but they made a nice comeback. Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:08.260]
My hello, in a yes, sir. Hey, Neil, how are you doing, sir? Great. I accept you as my lord and savior.

[01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:18.680]
Yeah, good. OK. Yes. I got something that really grosses me out. Yes. It's like when you go to and you know, see a couple chicks and they live their arms. They got hair on their armpits.

[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:31.020]
Hairy pizza. Yeah. And so they're legs and they got beach buzz on the chin. And a beard. Yeah. And a little mustache. Yeah. OK, pal. All right.

[01:52:31.140 --> 01:52:40.320]
Right. Every day. Harry. Harry women with hairy armpits. We got hairy people. No, no, that's not that's not the same thing at all. Women with hairy pits.

[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:49.840]
It's not the same at all. I thought it was all encompassing. No, it is not. When you don't worry. When people say hairy people bug me,

[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:55.440]
what are talking about guys that got hair like under your chin and just loaded like hairy reams, you know, remember,

[01:52:55.580 --> 01:53:01.600]
her dreams, your throat or like Ron Jeremy guys who are like walking fru balls, but women with hairy pits.

[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:08.120]
That's a whole different category, man. You better start catching up on your pits, mister, because you sure don't know.

[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:18.180]
This is which when you'll fly six. You. We are. Our David's a bitch.

[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.860]
Absolutely. All right. Welcome back to the.

[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:46.100]

[01:53:47.540 --> 01:53:49.100]
That music.

[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:51.260]
What do you try to do wake up the whole.

[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:53.500]
We got it. It looks like we have a guest.

[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:57.860]
Oh look, it's about two liters.

[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:00.760]
Well, you're the. The dolphin dolls.

[01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:03.980]
Two liters. Whatever the hell it is.

[01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:06.860]
They smell nice. I know.

[01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:10.820]
Yeah. I was sitting down and make the seat smell good.

[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.980]
So you like our pom-poms? What do you. Women on the cheerleader.

[01:54:15.980 --> 01:54:22.300]
What do you. You got the teeth? So what do you. What do you.

[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:24.820]
Do you like when I part my legs like this?

[01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:26.540]
Who said that? That's a different.

[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:30.380]
The women in here. Women.

[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:32.700]
Oh, you got a quote from Jay.

[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:38.620]
Well, this is my dear and very close man, buddy. Jay.

[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:41.920]
My closest friend as well. God you quote Jay.

[01:54:42.260 --> 01:54:45.060]
And how are you today? Well, we had a very tough game.

[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:49.040]
Oh, I missed you, my man friend. Oh, yes.

[01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.620]
We want to have lunch. Well, you named it.

[01:54:52.780 --> 01:54:54.620]
What's that? That sounds right here.

[01:54:55.220 --> 01:54:57.640]
That's the sound of my tongue going up your ears.

[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:00.940]
See, I could have played ginger, moor, gay, union, but since this brand new.

[01:55:00.960 --> 01:55:04.680]
It's called the Mohawar David had sent him a broad. The only thing left out was.

[01:55:05.920 --> 01:55:09.220]
He left that out. Well, we'll work that in. Okay. Vote's over.

[01:55:09.980 --> 01:55:13.040]
I'm your pardon. The voting is over. And it was you. No.

[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:17.720]
Five days on the Republican side. Two days on the Democratic side.

[01:55:17.940 --> 01:55:21.480]
Oh, what a big pyramid. I must have had. I won't see them. No, Mo.

[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:26.960]
So it's all over in the house and I'll move over over the Senate. I guarantee you before I 1245.

[01:55:27.100 --> 01:55:29.060]
They'll say, yeah, let's get it on there.

[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.260]
And a president will sign a fact that you can say a moron.

[01:55:31.780 --> 01:55:34.320]
It'll be incredible. Speaking of morons,

[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:36.220]
they had the big debate in California last night.

[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:40.620]
Accusing his opponents have tried to pull the wool over the people's eyes.

[01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:47.100]
Arnold Schwarzenegger did his best last night to dominate a riotous debate among the primary candidates in the California.

[01:55:47.100 --> 01:55:51.620]
We are called election, taunting the other contenders with sarcastic cracks about their policies.

[01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:55.080]
He was taunting them. You ready for that? He's taunting them.

[01:55:55.400 --> 01:55:57.300]
Yeah, that's the best part of the whole thing.

[01:55:57.300 --> 01:56:06.380]
Hello. Yeah. Contrary to widespread predictions that the forum would be scripted, the candidates bigger than interrupted one another in a 90 minute rhetorical battle.

[01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:12.140]
Your personal income tax, loophole. I can drive my hummer through a Schwarzenegger was running for governors.

[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:15.940]
The Republican said the media are calm. Is Ariana Huffington who sounds just like Eva Gabor.

[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:20.900]
Huffington shouted down Schwarzenegger when he tried to interrupt her comments about the state budget.

[01:56:21.220 --> 01:56:23.240]
This is the way you treat women. We know that she said.

[01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:31.120]
I have a perfect part for you in Terminator 4. He shot back with a grin. In Schwarzenegger's most recent movie Terminator 3 is charactered, Ducks and Women's Head, in a toilet.

[01:56:32.780 --> 01:56:38.560]
The frustrated moderator who at times burly managed to move into the debate forward, interjecting, this is not comedy central. I swear.

[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.040]
The event was maker break for Schwarzenegger and he was foreign away the main attraction in the evening. I can't believe that's because of the media. Is it at all?

[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:58.520]
The forum featuring five of the 135 candidates, he can replace Governor Gray. Davis marked the first time Schwarzenegger confronted his rivals in person, making it undoubtedly the most highly publicized campaign event thus far.

[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:03.600]
He is not planning to participate in any other forms before election because he's got limited vocabulary.

[01:57:05.740 --> 01:57:13.400]
Under intense pressure to prove his viability is a candidate, Schwarzenegger tried to prove his mastery of policy details, citing figures and dollar amounts from time to time.

[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:21.080]
Still, he dodged answers to a few questions and it was unclear for example whether he supported providing full healthcare benefits to children of illegal immigrant workers.

[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:37.940]
And the article goes on, says the nastiest exchanges were between Schwarzenegger and having to new spoke often in unison for long stretches, hoping to repeatedly compare Schwarzenegger to President Bush, hoping to attach the public's increasing negative impression of the Bush administration to a Republican rival.

[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:44.380]
Let's make one thing clear on October 8th, it's not going to be Governor Bush, it's going to be Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said.

[01:57:44.840 --> 01:57:50.680]
The last thing this state needs is Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, hoping to be tormented, something just like Avigabor without the pig.

[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:51.260]
Dining.

[01:57:52.460 --> 01:58:06.100]
After the debate, hoping that said she was so outraged by his interruptions, which he described as sexist, that she would no longer hold back from attacking Schwarzenegger's attitude toward women, speaking to reporters she mentioned interview Schwarzenegger able to we-we-magazine in the 70s about having group sex.

[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:14.100]
Lieutenant Governor Cruz-Bustamani, he was there by the way. At the Cruz-Sunday-Necke-Necke-Bustamani, Schwarzenegger and Paul's remained cool despite Schwarzenegger's constant interruptions.

[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:23.900]
I did interrupt you, Arnold, he said smoothly when Schwarzenegger jumped into the complaint about politicians who we said, through little more than smile for photographers, you're willing to talk about photo ops, Bustamani said.

[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:25.100]
Oh, nice going, Cruz.

[01:58:25.540 --> 01:58:25.840]
Bye, Troy.

[01:58:26.740 --> 01:58:28.420]
Troy from Balanced for Life was here.

[01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:29.880]
Oh, hey, how you doing, Troy?

[01:58:31.940 --> 01:58:32.720]
How's everything going?

[01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:33.580]
Everything okay?

[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:35.140]
Yeah, everything's going well.

[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:35.960]
Hello, how's it going?

[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:36.040]
I'm a swed.

[01:58:36.780 --> 01:58:42.860]
Great, Toronto sensational man. They have a thing just like yours up here. I forget what they call it, but it's very similar. I mean, get on it.

[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:44.000]
Yeah, I know, I saw it on the internet.

[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:45.300]
I may hop on it.

[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.780]
Hop on it? I got the black sack here right now.

[01:58:48.200 --> 01:58:50.940]
Excellent. How's that the beast doing? Is he standing on the straightener or now?

[01:58:51.600 --> 01:58:54.140]
From what I hear, that's what he's saying, but you know what I mean?

[01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:00.240]
Okay, well nice to chat with you briefly, Troy.

[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:00.780]
All right, buddy.

[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:03.180]
Then hold the Bobbogadouche, please.

[01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:06.200]
So when are we getting back to Martina?

[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:14.840]
Martina and Abratelova, who's a lot butchered and Arnold will ever dream of being, will plan to get into public service after she stops serving, following in 2005.

[01:59:15.940 --> 01:59:16.380]
Martina.

[01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:24.580]
And Abratelova turns 47 next month, said yesterday at the Spark Casson Cup tournament, then she plans to play through the end of next season.

[01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:27.920]
And she wanted to get involved with the American politics. She says perhaps running for office.

[01:59:27.920 --> 01:59:34.740]
If Arnold Schwarzenegger can run for governor of California, then who knows I have the muscles, said in Abratelova, check for US citizen who lives in Colorado.

[01:59:35.260 --> 01:59:38.100]
I will be involved especially the way things are going right now.

[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:43.140]
The conservative party is too strong. She said being the left wing dict that of course we all know and love.

[01:59:43.640 --> 01:59:43.900]
Yes.

[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:49.240]
She ranks among the greatest tennis dict players ever with a total of 50 when it goes on about her tennis craft.

[01:59:49.540 --> 01:59:52.100]
She says I enjoy playing tennis, but also enjoy not playing tennis.

[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.500]
I love life, whether it's with or without tennis. She's not too big on balls.

[01:59:56.280 --> 02:00:01.920]
But she sure probably got a big pair of guarantee that five six seven oh five sixty.

[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:09.400]
We're asking what's your biggest roast out body odor people who smell people who stink people haven't seen a bar of coast in about 30 years.

[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:14.940]
108 jelly rolls of fat 58 see when I'm talking about jelly rolls.

[02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:17.560]
I'm talking I think I really well you know what I mean?

[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:17.820]
Sure.

[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:22.240]
I'm talking about big big really fat to like to be like Josh treatment like fat boy.

next year let's come up with something a little bit more interesting. I already have

an idea. Pencil thin anal vibrators that you're used to give out like that. I already know

[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:34.680]
what? Yeah. A picture book. Maybe he'd be in there. Right? A picture book of what?

the break. So there you go. Men with speedos of the beach in French Canadians. Kind of body

[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:26.180]
jewelry. Just makes me sick to my stomach with the stuff in the tongue and oh god. Can't

[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:29.840]
stand it. Call me old-fashioned. Call me a senior citizen like they did at the bank

[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:35.720]
yesterday. You old codger. You old-foot. Gramps. That's okay. The old man. Gramps. Old

[02:09:35.720 --> 02:09:43.220]
foot. By the way, today was payday. Did you get it? I don't know if I got my paycheck.

[02:09:43.460 --> 02:09:46.800]
I'll find out later in the afternoon. I better damn well I got that paycheck or clearance.

[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:52.940]
I'm going to shove your foot up his ass. Here's sunrise. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:56.920]
Those people with all the piercings and the face, they look like they fell face first into

[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:04.180]
a tackle box. Don't they? I had a double dose of grossy story the other day. I'm walking

[02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:09.860]
down the aisle and this old guy in front of me is hacking up along. He turns and he hawkers

[02:10:09.860 --> 02:10:17.320]
right on the floor. Right. I totally went off on him. I'm yelling at him and then I look

[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:24.280]
down and on the top of his hand is this open, infectious, oozing sore. Are you sure

[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:28.820]
was this hand him? I didn't part an ant car. I called the manager and there he is nice

[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:33.080]
but there was nothing he could do. He just got a guy to mop it up. You know just that

[02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:38.720]
was just disgusting as it got for me. Okay, well, thanks for letting me share the bad

[02:10:38.720 --> 02:10:43.220]
happen nice day. Tom, don't do it again. Thanks, pal. All right. Right. That's appetizing.

[02:10:43.380 --> 02:10:47.000]
Sure. I don't know what we would put that down. I guess we would. I didn't think that

[02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:50.560]
was a suggestion. I just thought it was a story. It was it was just a story. I was trying

[02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:54.100]
to figure out figure out some way to work it in there. What if they got this bitch on

[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:59.680]
here for? Who lives in California. She's analyzing the the debate. She's got then under

[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:03.920]
some other goofball on her. First of all, she lives in freaking Miami now in the somewhere

[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.840]
in South Florida. What the hell? They always drag on. In fact, you'll be amazed at all the

[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:14.120]
polls I have piled up here now. Okay. No, you won't because I'm like playing a way ahead.

[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:17.400]
Like to think about your favorite rock group other than the Beatles and the Stones. That's

[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:20.800]
coming very soon and then think about the straight favorite straight guy with a queer

[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.880]
eye. Which TV talking head you pray never to see again? Oh, yeah. I got her on there and

[02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:30.520]
Nancy Grace to start. But I don't want to add to it because you know, then they'll start.

[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:35.760]
That's for down the road. Somebody you think is an asshole, but you enjoy their work.

[02:11:37.120 --> 02:11:40.200]
Right? We don't like something like that. And you know, I want to hear the first four.

[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:47.080]
Yeah, I do. Dick Clark. Okay. Richard Dawson. All right. Neil Rogers and Mohawar David

[02:11:47.080 --> 02:11:52.420]
had good start. Oh, definitely. So I think we got a whole bunch of good stuff. Thank goodness.

[02:11:53.140 --> 02:11:56.560]
Don't forget all you Marlon's fans. Let's do this one more time because otherwise

[02:11:56.560 --> 02:12:00.720]
muffled you start crying and you won't read the promo Greg. You won't read the promo.

[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:04.880]
I'll read the promo. Like I said, you should mirror us the most. You're back. But what that

[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:09.160]
radio station has done for us. I've taken what they did for us. They sent OG after the guy

[02:12:09.160 --> 02:12:14.020]
named Golf term at the fundraiser that one year. That's what they did for us. And then we finally

[02:12:14.020 --> 02:12:18.960]
said, Hey, don't do us any more favors. I think that's the way we put it. Don't do us no more

[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:25.580]
favors. You morons you. And you people at Lago Mara, man, you talk about having no shame.

[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:29.880]
That's just I got that letter. I'm saving it. Copy you sent me yesterday. I got five copies.

[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:35.300]
Yeah. If I've got a plaster copies on T rooms, I'll I got to cover up glory holes with it all over

[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:39.460]
us out Florida. Oh, don't do that. Take it out to Westland. The JC pennies this afternoon.

[02:12:39.980 --> 02:12:44.180]
Don't think all you Marlon's fans that's ain't tonight's game. Don't forget to stop by gate G's

[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:48.500]
during it five o'clock because for all will be out there hosting the wildest party yet. And it'll

[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:54.180]
be on Fox Sports net. The wildest fan showing his or her true colors will join Billy the Marlon

[02:12:54.180 --> 02:12:58.560]
along with the Merberates and for all for wild. Well, I'll tell you he's sure a self promoter. I'll say

[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:05.400]
that. Yeah. Well, that was a nice way of putting it for a wild ride on his boat during the game

[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:09.020]
and get tickets to Saturday's game along with other Marlon's merchandise. That's a game against the

[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:14.420]
anxious Mets. The QM prize patrol will be on hand passing at five sixty WQM wild cards. We don't

[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.720]
have any bumper stickers on this guy for seconds. They should be got wild cards. Do we know what

[02:13:18.720 --> 02:13:23.940]
that is? I don't know. There'll be balloon artists making custom Marlon team balloons for the kids

[02:13:23.940 --> 02:13:29.100]
who stop by gate G at the QM promo booth and fans can come by to QM promo booth and get their

[02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:34.560]
bodies painted showing their two Marlon's colors. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I wonder who's going to be doing

[02:13:34.560 --> 02:13:41.140]
the body painting. I guess it all depends on which fans stop by and show up five six seven

[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:46.860]
oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line your biggest gross

[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:53.460]
up. In fact, I'm looking at a wolf blitzkrieg right now and that's grossing me on. Here's a

[02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:59.780]
Pemberpine. Hello. Neil guy. How are you today? Okay. Great. Love your show. Always loved to hear you.

[02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:07.460]
Not much to say. My wife is still great. She swallows, but my biggest gross out. How about plumbers crack?

[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:15.740]
You get it? Five six seven oh five sixty.

[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:20.820]
pound five sixty on the AT&T

[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:30.520]
that Verizon Wireless Line. Oh, you get it. Apparently. Here's a call from Bokeh. Hello.

[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:36.520]
Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? You just you just said the magic work. You said pound five

[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:42.960]
sixty and I'm on my AT&T wireless phone and I was at work the other day and I wanted to listen to

[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:48.580]
the mall and game when they played. I guess it was the Phillies in the afternoon when they had the

[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:53.760]
hurricane at one o'clock. Right. Right. So pound five sixty. I put my headset on for no one knew

[02:14:53.760 --> 02:15:00.000]
I was listening to the game and I got to build my AT&T bill for $49 for listening to that game

[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:07.860]
because it was not a free call. All right. So is it a free call or not? Not when the marlins are on.

[02:15:08.620 --> 02:15:12.600]
Not when the marlins are on? No. When the marlins are on, we charge a double.

[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:19.160]
No, is it the factory or or or I shouldn't do that anymore or you have enough of me?

[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:26.300]
What does that mean? It means I thought that could have just turned on the radio and listened

[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:31.860]
to the game for free. pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line and here's a man that paid

[02:15:31.860 --> 02:15:35.840]
fifty bucks to listen on the phone. It's dead listening for free on the radio. Well, I think you

[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:43.900]
got what you deserve. Don't you? He just figured out that it wasn't he doesn't have to put any coins

[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:47.980]
in the radio to make it work. He just figured that out. Oh, he thought that CD slot was a coin

[02:15:47.980 --> 02:15:51.700]
does. He could have brought he could have brought his Sony a walkman and put that on instead of

[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:54.760]
having to go to him phone and his ear. He could have done that and had little accordion

[02:15:54.760 --> 02:15:59.960]
zero. Follow what I'm saying. I know. You follow on this? Yeah. Speaking of five sixty. Yes? Five sixty.

[02:16:03.140 --> 02:16:06.960]
Well, it'll be nice to make the 600 anyway. Wouldn't it be a moral victory more minutes?

[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.900]
We got till one o'clock three and a half more minutes to one. Miguel is their dream car south.

[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:16.860]
174 or three South Fixie Highway. All you people in South day that have been belly-academy.

[02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:20.820]
We never assembly a van down there. Miguel isn't sure what's lovely face down there. He's there.

[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:24.880]
He's waiting for you. Got four minutes. A dream car south. Stop buying that we need 40 more bucks

[02:16:24.880 --> 02:16:29.800]
for 600. That'll be pretty weak. Do we have a total so far? That till he gets back.

[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:35.900]
Let me tell you about a great idea. Laminate Sirus because boy, natural wood flooring is beautiful,

[02:16:35.900 --> 02:16:40.540]
but it is so damn expensive. And this is the easy low maintenance alternative to spending all of

[02:16:40.540 --> 02:16:45.240]
that money. Laminate Sirus is the best place to find laminated wood flooring at an amazingly low

[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.220]
price from the top names in the business. Peridore, Peragobos and Art Uniflor, quick step they got

[02:16:49.220 --> 02:16:53.880]
them all. All the top names all installed by Peragobos certified installers too. Another good reason

[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:58.200]
why I'd be calling these folks Laminates Sirus is because their prices will floor you. That's how low

[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:04.600]
they really are. Right now get their September kickoff special for just $1995. Just $1995

[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:09.640]
gets you up to $380 square feet of beautiful laminated wood flooring. It is positively unbelievable.

[02:17:09.980 --> 02:17:16.940]
I love on a spot the way at the top it says, pronounce Laminate. Okay. I wonder whose account is this?

[02:17:19.220 --> 02:17:22.160]
Good question. Do they think I'm illiterate? Do they think yes? I'm kind of a moron?

[02:17:22.260 --> 02:17:27.060]
Yes. I'm kind of a quizzling. And Laminate Sirus will match any legitimate written offer too.

[02:18:18.720 --> 02:18:22.940]
you. She's hanging like a straw me on right.

[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:25.000]
My bank culture's rancid snap.

[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:28.820]
In culture's rancid snap.

[02:18:30.660 --> 02:18:33.140]
Imagine what you can catch.

[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:36.980]
From hand and culture's snack.

[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:46.980]
Gonna be upon you scratches with a brush.

[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.820]
She'd thank her all though.

[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:56.780]
And Bill Marbott you'll never get thrushed in cultures rancid snap.

[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:00.800]
In cultures rancid snap.

[02:19:02.380 --> 02:19:05.460]
A swirling pool of crap.

[02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:08.960]
And culture's rancid snap.

[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:14.600]
Using pleasure to voice your.

[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:18.340]
Making out her voice there.

[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:22.020]
Walking with the bill of dough.

[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:27.740]
Her we can't decide if her butt in cultures rancid snap.

[02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:31.180]
In cultures rancid snap.

[02:19:32.480 --> 02:19:35.080]
The one to know what it can hatch.

[02:19:36.420 --> 02:19:38.120]
Red for their snack.

[02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:39.620]
Number one with two bullets.

[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:43.380]
Already 103 at 560 WDQM I love that.

[02:19:43.520 --> 02:19:44.260]
I got one for you.

[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:44.980]
What?

[02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:45.040]
What?

[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:46.520]
Genital warts.

[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:47.400]
Okay.

[02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:49.320]
Yeah.

[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:52.020]
Well stop and think about it.

[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.920]
I don't have to stop and think about it.

[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:56.260]
Genital warts.

[02:19:58.140 --> 02:20:01.000]
What's your biggest gross out of body odor 122?

[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:02.480]
It's often right in man.

[02:20:02.580 --> 02:20:04.460]
And they still don't know what I'm talking about.

[02:20:04.520 --> 02:20:05.840]
They're still in denial about that thing.

[02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:06.600]
And maybe I'm wrong.

[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:09.480]
Maybe there's just people that don't bathe.

[02:20:09.480 --> 02:20:10.420]
But I don't think so.

[02:20:10.660 --> 02:20:11.640]
There's more to it than that.

[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:12.900]
Ethnic thing.

[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:16.900]
For example, I don't want to pick on our native Americans

[02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:18.220]
because they already picked that.

[02:20:18.420 --> 02:20:21.100]
They had boson arrows and we had like a little bit better weapons.

[02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:24.880]
But Indians, I'm talking about American Indians.

[02:20:25.120 --> 02:20:28.360]
I mean, they have a different skin pigmentation.

[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:29.140]
Yes.

[02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:32.120]
And they smell different.

[02:20:32.340 --> 02:20:32.660]
Some of them.

[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:33.260]
Not all of them.

[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:34.140]
I had a squal.

[02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.200]
Do you know what I'm talking about?

[02:20:36.420 --> 02:20:37.060]
She smells fine.

[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:38.420]
Do you?

[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:42.220]
I feel like I'm just sometimes talking to the wall.

[02:20:42.440 --> 02:20:43.360]
I'm going to just face the wall.

[02:20:43.380 --> 02:20:44.980]
I don't know what the guys smell like, but the squal smell.

[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:47.760]
I'm not talking about necessarily guys or women or whatever.

[02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:50.500]
I'm just telling you that there are people with skin pigmentation.

[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:51.240]
It's different.

[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:52.560]
And it smells different.

[02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:52.920]
Okay.

[02:20:53.300 --> 02:20:56.440]
Based on their diet, based on their attitude,

[02:20:56.680 --> 02:20:58.600]
based on a crappy bit of luck.

[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:00.640]
I don't know.

[02:21:00.820 --> 02:21:03.020]
That could be part of it.

[02:21:03.220 --> 02:21:04.280]
What's your biggest gross up?

[02:21:04.460 --> 02:21:05.460]
Body odor 122.

[02:21:05.580 --> 02:21:07.100]
Jelly rolls of fat 65.

[02:21:07.980 --> 02:21:08.300]

Harry people 7.

[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:20.540]
Red hair only 4 of us.

[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:22.020]
I would have voted for tattoos.

[02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:24.900]
Women with Harry pits 4.

[02:21:25.020 --> 02:21:25.720]

[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:27.000]
Tattoos only 3.

[02:21:27.420 --> 02:21:28.580]
Sloppy clothes 3.

[02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:29.400]
Dirty.

[02:21:29.660 --> 02:21:30.200]
What is that?

[02:21:32.680 --> 02:21:35.740]
No, I say I think he...

[02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.660]
Dirty push.

[02:21:37.100 --> 02:21:37.100]

[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:38.720]
Almost thought it said dirty pus.

[02:21:38.900 --> 02:21:40.060]
He just played the encoder thing.

[02:21:40.600 --> 02:21:41.480]
Dirty push 2.

[02:21:41.980 --> 02:21:42.780]
And Dan rough none.

[02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:43.880]
I hate dirty pus.

[02:21:44.340 --> 02:21:45.760]
Do we have nose pickers on there?

[02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:48.680]
I think we left off nose pickers, Eric.

[02:21:48.900 --> 02:21:49.920]
I don't want to get all over Eric.

[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:51.800]
Believe me, because he grosses me out.

[02:21:52.620 --> 02:21:54.740]
Uh, nose pickers, tons of body jewelry.

[02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:55.620]
That's not on there.

[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:57.900]
Uh, men with speedoses.

[02:21:58.020 --> 02:21:59.660]
Not...oh, I see. He's still got some more to get on there.

[02:21:59.780 --> 02:22:00.180]
French Canadians.

[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:03.060]
And certainly the old genital warts new.

[02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:06.280]
Here's a call from North Miami.

[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:06.680]
Hello.

[02:22:07.940 --> 02:22:08.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:08.420 --> 02:22:10.420]
Hi, the most gross thing is

[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:13.780]
Pash marks on drawers.

[02:22:16.680 --> 02:22:17.400]
Baba buoy.

[02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:18.140]
Baba buoy.

[02:22:22.060 --> 02:22:23.540]
Oh, he only had three of them.

[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:25.200]
No, he ran out of Baba buoy.

[02:22:27.180 --> 02:22:27.540]
5670560.

[02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:29.660]
He won a Howard's Idiots, one of his quizzlings.

[02:22:30.320 --> 02:22:32.960]
Pound 560 on the 18th team for Rise of Wireless Line.

[02:22:33.240 --> 02:22:33.900]
And I wouldn't that good?

[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:34.620]
Oh, yeah.

[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:37.920]
I want to believe in one to see how many Baba buoy he had in him.

[02:22:38.100 --> 02:22:39.340]
Pretty weak.

[02:22:39.680 --> 02:22:40.040]
Pretty lame.

[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:43.080]
Here's a call from Miramar.

[02:22:43.240 --> 02:22:43.400]
Hello.

[02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:46.180]
Miramar.

[02:22:46.660 --> 02:22:46.980]
Yes, sir.

[02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:48.100]
Yeah, Neil, sorry, man. Sorry.

[02:22:48.540 --> 02:22:49.040]
Don't be sorry.

[02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:51.780]
You're God, man. You are God.

[02:22:52.780 --> 02:22:53.100]
You're God.

[02:22:53.100 --> 02:22:53.300]
You're God.

[02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:53.680]
Sure.

[02:22:54.260 --> 02:22:56.660]
Listen, how I listen to my answer.

[02:22:57.020 --> 02:22:57.900]
How about Larry Kingwood?

[02:22:58.740 --> 02:22:59.240]
He's gross.

[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:00.600]
He's very gross.

[02:23:01.920 --> 02:23:11.640]
Uh, you know, uh, how about these women who have children with snot hanging out of their nose in a store or a restaurant?

[02:23:11.840 --> 02:23:12.700]
Don't even wipe it off.

[02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:15.200]
I think snot just in general.

[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:16.160]
Not necessarily with children.

[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:18.140]
The guy that was talking before about the guy that uh,

[02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:20.400]
mungled all over the floor.

[02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:23.280]
Uh, yes, not snot school.

[02:23:25.080 --> 02:23:28.560]
How about, hey, how about, uh, diapers, diaper changing in public?

[02:23:29.120 --> 02:23:30.000]
How about having a nice day?

[02:23:30.780 --> 02:23:33.200]
How about breastfeeding okay from a sloppy old bitch?

[02:23:33.500 --> 02:23:35.660]
I mean, no snot's good, isn't it?

[02:23:36.060 --> 02:23:36.340]
Stuts.

[02:23:37.340 --> 02:23:37.600]
Good.

[02:23:38.100 --> 02:23:39.380]
Sometimes you think it's bad, but it's not.

[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:44.660]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, I'm going to do my stories here because this is,

[02:23:44.740 --> 02:23:47.160]
they're obviously reaching and stretching out which is why we're getting more idiots.

[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:49.980]
The Bobbobooie guy, my favorite.

[02:23:50.900 --> 02:23:52.260]
And by the way, back at you.

[02:23:53.100 --> 02:23:55.800]
George W. Bush is in the worst political trouble of his presidency.

[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:59.340]
According to a new NBC News Wall Street Journal poll released last night.

[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:04.360]
Bush is approval rating now stands at just 49% the lowest point of his 10-year.

[02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:08.820]
Whether the Democrats will be able to exploit his vows is unknown, yada yada.

[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:13.740]
With only 15 months until the general election, the president of his political strategy just have their work cut out for him.

[02:24:13.740 --> 02:24:19.200]
Especially in assuring skittish voters that his plans to stabilize Iraq will work.

[02:24:20.760 --> 02:24:26.680]
Presented in the NBC News Wall Street Journal poll with various options for raising the money to pay for the Iraqi project.

[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:34.500]
56% of respondents said they'd offer repeating the portion of the tax cuts that Congress passed last May that benefits upper income taxpayers.

[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:37.000]
But he liked that.

[02:24:37.240 --> 02:24:37.580]
I like it.

[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:39.820]
And it goes on a great length.

[02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:41.020]
It's on our website, by the way.

[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:46.000]
It's from MSNBC and the headline NBC poll, Bush rating lowest ever.

[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:47.680]
It's on our hits and charity on our website.

[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:49.840]
Read it and jump for joy.

[02:24:50.380 --> 02:24:51.340]
And you'll push people out there.

[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:52.460]
Shame on you.

[02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:53.640]
You can weep like a duck.

[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.100]
You can sit around a cry like a baby.

[02:24:57.060 --> 02:24:58.560]
Blodling Steve to Rolex slang.

[02:24:58.600 --> 02:24:59.960]
You were talking about this story before.

[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:00.380]
Yeah.

[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:03.840]
Project.

[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:10.140]
Blodling's Rolex Steve to driveway killing says the hero didn't ex-con with the history of snatching others that were to again.

[02:25:11.060 --> 02:25:17.660]
Snatching expensive Rolex is is wounded on the run in the and the prime suspect in the driveway slaying a prominent coconut girl businessman.

[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:19.900]
Miami police chief John Timoni said yesterday.

[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:21.660]
Anthony Craig Lee.

[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:27.660]
31 grubbed his blocks from the street of million dollar homes where Jose Calvo was shot in the head.

[02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:31.400]
As he gave up his diamond accruced at Rolex and ring the evening of September 18.

[02:25:32.240 --> 02:25:35.380]
Lee was tied to the shooting death by the blood found in his getaway car.

[02:25:35.780 --> 02:25:39.720]
Denise Calvo Jose Calvo's wife shot at the fleeing man hit him in the left side.

[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:44.860]
Lee's DNA was in the state's criminal database due to his violent history offering police an easy match.

[02:25:45.380 --> 02:25:48.360]
He should be considered armed and dangerous and may seek medical care.

[02:25:48.460 --> 02:25:48.980]
Timoni said.

[02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:51.960]
Greg Ormond attorney for Denise Calvo said Wednesday.

[02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.240]
She's pleased to know they've identified the suspect.

[02:25:54.240 --> 02:25:56.100]
But one of these previous victims is saying.

[02:25:56.420 --> 02:25:58.680]
Lee should have served more time in prison for his previous crimes.

[02:25:58.920 --> 02:26:00.980]
And he is absolutely correct.

[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:04.920]
Mr. Calvo would still be alive today if he had been given time for shooting me.

[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:05.820]
Sid Ron Garalnik.

[02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:07.940]
Who was shot and robbed by Lee in 1992.

[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:11.200]
He would have been incarcerated for a more significant part of his life.

[02:26:12.760 --> 02:26:17.380]
In 1990s Lee was a member of the proficient Rolex robber's band pulling off a string of holdups.

[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:19.620]
There's a lesson here folks don't wear Rolex watch.

[02:26:19.800 --> 02:26:20.680]
No, death magnets.

[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:25.780]
Police eventually busted in with other members of the group who targeted owners of the expensive timepiece.

[02:26:26.240 --> 02:26:31.060]
Lee took a plea deal on at least too such robberies according to court records and prosecutors and served ten years.

[02:26:31.420 --> 02:26:32.240]
He was released in May.

[02:26:33.420 --> 02:26:36.200]
Now Lee faces a first degree murder charge in Calvo's death.

[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.180]
But police think he's fled South Florida.

[02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:42.120]
However, they know exactly where his mother ended up and custody it to Miami-Dade County jail.

[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:48.800]
On Tuesday detective search leads family house at 3762 day avenue in the grove.

[02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:52.980]
They found a black pouch containing crack cocaine and charged Vernica Lee 50.

[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:53.980]
How you doing Vernica?

[02:26:54.420 --> 02:26:57.420]
With possession with intent possession with intent to sell corn to the police.

[02:26:58.020 --> 02:27:00.680]
They had hoped to find Calvo's Rolex and ring inside the home.

[02:27:01.000 --> 02:27:02.900]
But those items like Lee himself are missing.

[02:27:03.460 --> 02:27:07.700]
There's no indication that he's tried to pawn them said Miami homicide Lieutenant Daniel Dominguez.

[02:27:09.260 --> 02:27:13.600]
After his release from prison five months ago, Lee returned to the Cinder block home on day avenue.

[02:27:13.780 --> 02:27:16.160]
Just blocks from the driveway where Calvo was shot in the head.

[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:18.480]
They were one of the original families.

[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.320]
They had their problems but they were fine.

[02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:22.900]
They had John Williams who said his family is on the day avenue.

[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:28.160]
How since their behavior or all their early behavior and ancestors settled in the grove in early 1900s.

[02:27:28.820 --> 02:27:30.340]
Their behavior and ancestors.

[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:31.140]
Young man.

[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:34.560]
William said he has known these parents since they were children but never so much of their son.

[02:27:34.920 --> 02:27:37.960]
Williams was shocked when told he was wanted by police in the Crawford Avenue murder.

[02:27:38.440 --> 02:27:39.300]
I knew there had been some trouble.

[02:27:39.300 --> 02:27:40.900]
I didn't take related to that. He said he had to.

[02:27:42.240 --> 02:27:46.080]
Lee's Croner record dates back to 1988 including 14 arrests for charges.

[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.300]
They include attempted murder and drug possession and of course the 92 convicted of those Rolex robberies.

[02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:53.140]
They said oh ten years is enough.

[02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:55.260]
So now this guy is dead.

[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:57.860]
There you go. There's the American justice system for you.

[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:02.840]
Now speaking of crack cocaine if we would have been found with a pin joint in this possession.

[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:04.460]
You probably got about 20 you know.

[02:28:05.760 --> 02:28:10.240]
Keep him stashed away for a long long time with or without his stash.

[02:28:12.240 --> 02:28:13.380]
That's America for you.

[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:16.560]
Are you pot smokers out there?

[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.500]
Ten to twenty baby.

[02:28:17.660 --> 02:28:18.080]
No parole.

[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:19.500]
No p-bargaining.

[02:28:21.260 --> 02:28:23.880]
Five six seven oh now do we get a final throw from a go?

[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:25.780]
Six eighty.

[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.500]
Well that's not too bad.

[02:28:27.760 --> 02:28:28.360]
We'll take it.

[02:28:28.760 --> 02:28:29.620]
I mean it's not great.

[02:28:29.880 --> 02:28:31.480]
It's not spectacular but it's just started.

[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:36.620]
It's almost 700 bucks last time I checked and maybe we'll actually get like an up to date total on our band and pair rescue.

[02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:39.080]
Our best meal campaign which is limping and hobbling along.

[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:47.000]
Because we got a lot of real cheap three loading bastards and some for real real cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap three loaders is what we got.

[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:48.480]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:28:49.180 --> 02:28:54.220]
We had five thousand free Marlon tickets for the phones would be smoke him and they'd be smoldering.

[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:57.960]
We would bust out the guy them phone lines.

[02:28:58.120 --> 02:29:00.620]
If we had a whole crap load of Marlon tickets to give it.

[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:03.180]
Of course if you have to pay for your own you they're gonna buy them now.

[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:07.560]
I had a laugh reading about in I guess it was the hero.

[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:13.160]
Yesterday about the long lines of people starting early in the morning on Tuesday for the first fillies game.

[02:29:13.340 --> 02:29:15.960]
Yeah well if that's the case how come they only had 25,000 people.

[02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:17.800]
Scott.

[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:19.740]
I don't know.

[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:22.060]
Yeah long lines.

[02:29:22.240 --> 02:29:24.180]
I mean it just everybody in their brother wanted to take his.

[02:29:24.340 --> 02:29:27.040]

[02:32:51.020 --> 02:32:51.220]
Yes.

[02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:53.200]
That came from a 400 pound man.

[02:32:56.760 --> 02:33:00.120]

[02:33:06.660 --> 02:33:07.700]
You going to be on the news?

[02:33:07.980 --> 02:33:10.380]
Can you describe the features?

[02:33:10.920 --> 02:33:11.660]
I mean, what does it look like?

[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:12.960]
You know what it is.

[02:33:13.080 --> 02:33:14.100]
It came out your ass.

[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:15.940]
What the hell?

[02:33:16.180 --> 02:33:18.120]

I tell you what, it smells ungodly.

[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:21.360]
That's what it smells like.

[02:33:22.060 --> 02:33:23.180]
It smells like you're so selfish.

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.180]

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.180]

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.180]

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.180]

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.180]

[02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:24.280]
I told you your ass to the devil.

[02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:26.300]
I don't even know if it's a hell.

[02:33:26.840 --> 02:33:27.640]
Well, how many is it?

[02:33:27.720 --> 02:33:28.300]
How long is it?

[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:30.180]
It's not as long as my arm.

[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.100]
I don't think it's fun.

[02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:34.560]
Why y'all this is not fun.

[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:37.920]
I got a damn two-bar four and my back feet.

[02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:41.160]
You know, I think it's just a racial shit too.

[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:42.360]
That's what they're doing.

[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:46.620]
A little kid is running away from it.

[02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:50.680]
Oh my God.

[02:33:51.740 --> 02:33:53.660]
I'm gonna go find this funny.

[02:33:54.860 --> 02:33:55.820]
Oh, okay.

[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:59.680]
You're probably gonna be on a fair wheel too, don't you?

[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:00.800]
All right, all right.

[02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:03.360]
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?

[02:34:04.060 --> 02:34:06.080]
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

[02:34:08.540 --> 02:34:11.040]
Steve, Steve is coming off of it?

[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:11.400]

I'm getting it.

[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:16.380]
I'm getting it.

[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:17.460]
How long is it, huh?

[02:34:17.460 --> 02:34:21.060]
I am taking this as a fresh turd.

[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:21.520]
Okay.

[02:34:22.140 --> 02:34:25.580]
What you need to do is you need to bring that turd back.

[02:34:26.660 --> 02:34:27.440]
And we'll match it up.

[02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:28.200]
We have a lineup.

[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:32.000]
We'll match it up with the other turds that we have.

[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:35.240]
Well, what you need to do is learn how to use a toilet.

[02:34:35.600 --> 02:34:37.180]
You're saying I can bring the turd back to me?

[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:37.760]
No.

[02:34:38.260 --> 02:34:38.900]

I'm gonna keep it because it's a nice look.

[02:34:47.160 --> 02:34:47.760]
You know what?

[02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:49.480]
It's a nice conversation, please.

[02:34:50.140 --> 02:34:50.920]
Okay, cool.

[02:34:51.380 --> 02:34:51.420]
Okay.

How's that?

[02:35:24.880 --> 02:35:26.120]
Well, like tons of tattoos.

[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:27.280]
Lots of, well too many.

[02:35:27.480 --> 02:35:27.600]
Whatever.

[02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:32.660]
Red hair for Arvino's 3, sloppy clothes 3, Dan Ruffman and General Warts none.

[02:35:33.200 --> 02:35:34.080]
How do you like that?

[02:35:34.640 --> 02:35:36.220]
Somebody walks up to you and says Warts new.

[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:37.340]

How about people with piercings on the face?

[02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:04.540]
Like on their eye brows and looting.

[02:36:04.540 --> 02:36:05.980]
Body slash face piercings.

[02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:07.180]
Eric isn't getting emails.

[02:36:07.180 --> 02:36:08.140]
That's what's going on today.

[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:08.680]
Oh, I see.

[02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:10.020]

Yeah, I'm with you, man.

[02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:11.900]

Hey, hold on one more.

[02:36:13.460 --> 02:36:14.860]
You're an artist got to reach Miami.

[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:17.560]
I had to call a thousand times and the thing was big.

[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:19.420]
And then the phone was ringing for five hours.

[02:36:19.660 --> 02:36:20.060]
What's the deal?

[02:36:20.160 --> 02:36:21.000]
What's Scott doing over there?

[02:36:21.440 --> 02:36:22.560]
Scott's to play with himself.

[02:36:22.940 --> 02:36:23.660]
He must be.

[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:24.880]
But he's having a good time.

[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:25.640]
Thanks a lot, Pali.

[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:26.240]
All right.

[02:36:26.340 --> 02:36:26.620]
Thank you.

[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:27.320]
See ya.

[02:36:27.580 --> 02:36:29.780]
Yeah, Scott's watching Playboy TV down there, probably.

[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:30.500]
I sure am.

[02:36:30.860 --> 02:36:31.260]
All right.

[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:33.380]
Well, we can't.

[02:36:33.500 --> 02:36:34.620]
We don't like heartback, can we?

[02:36:35.380 --> 02:36:36.240]
Why feel better now?

[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:37.880]
Look how small that thing is.

[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:43.420]
He's been on put guys on these movies that, you know,

[02:36:43.500 --> 02:36:44.020]
what a small.

[02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:47.500]
I think he'll almost like a real man.

[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:51.880]
Oh, she's got what did he say?

[02:36:53.020 --> 02:36:53.560]
I don't know.

[02:36:53.760 --> 02:36:54.200]
Played again.

[02:36:54.480 --> 02:36:57.980]
I don't know, but he ain't going to say it again.

[02:36:58.040 --> 02:36:58.480]
I know that.

[02:36:59.800 --> 02:37:01.820]
What's he's got one in her mouth and one in her hand?

[02:37:03.340 --> 02:37:03.660]
Eminem's.

[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:09.180]
Well, here's what.

[02:37:09.180 --> 02:37:09.880]
Here's a guy that helped us out.

[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:10.540]
He didn't eat her.

[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:11.520]
That's not too bad.

[02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:12.460]
Thank you very much, Pali.

[02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:14.700]
Because it's been a real pull.

[02:37:14.900 --> 02:37:16.580]
And I know there's a lot of people aren't there right now.

[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:18.640]
I don't think our audience is there during the, like,

[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:19.960]
August, September, or dot-time.

[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:20.660]
Apparently not.

[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:22.540]
How many more weeks before they come back?

[02:37:22.660 --> 02:37:23.600]
About 30, man.

[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:24.420]
They really aren't.

[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:27.920]
We're just a trend and water right now until they decide they want to come back.

[02:37:28.180 --> 02:37:28.820]
Spinning their wheels.

[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:30.480]
Yeah, we're spinning our wheel.

[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:31.420]
Let's spin the wheel.

[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:31.940]
What are you saying?

[02:37:34.060 --> 02:37:36.360]
But I think that's damn white of QA.

[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:37.820]
I'm not going to be putting that promo one year.

[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:39.200]
My job.

[02:37:39.320 --> 02:37:40.100]
Tommy did there, too.

[02:37:40.660 --> 02:37:41.420]
Nice going, Tommy.

[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:42.680]
You know how fast I got that?

[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:43.980]
I'm going to threaten not to read the promo.

[02:37:44.160 --> 02:37:45.560]
I don't have crap in the ballpark tonight.

[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.220]
If they don't get 30,000 people at the Marlon game tonight,

[02:37:49.780 --> 02:37:51.060]
I'm taking them all off.

[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:52.340]
How's that?

[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:53.360]
Okay.

[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:54.840]
Isn't that some reasonable to you?

[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:55.100]
No.

[02:37:55.680 --> 02:37:56.200]
Why not?

[02:37:57.580 --> 02:37:59.800]
I mean, what kind of a bogus town is that, man?

[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:03.540]
I mean, out of nowhere comes this team without Mike Lowell,

[02:38:03.640 --> 02:38:05.240]
so I noticed the Humper head on yesterday.

[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:09.460]
And Hank, by the way, also was ripping the town for the crappy attendance.

[02:38:09.600 --> 02:38:10.220]
Nice going, Humper.

[02:38:10.580 --> 02:38:10.900]
You're the man.

[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:11.980]
Seriously.

[02:38:13.100 --> 02:38:14.040]
It's an embarrassment.

[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:15.020]
It's humiliating.

[02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:17.640]
What the hell does it take to get people out there?

[02:38:18.940 --> 02:38:21.260]
They want every goddamn game they still went out there.

[02:38:21.300 --> 02:38:25.440]
Unless they got some freaking bobble head down or some other piece of crap to give away for free.

[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:29.040]
Here's a call from Hylia.

[02:38:29.040 --> 02:38:29.240]
Hello.

[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:30.000]
Hey, Neil.

[02:38:30.100 --> 02:38:30.400]
How's it going?

[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:31.040]
Pretty good.

[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:34.500]
Listen, I was the one to drop you off the cassette about two weeks ago.

[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:36.500]
He said Georgia will get him.

[02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:39.900]
The best of Neil and the best of Rick and Suds.

[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:40.160]
Yeah.

[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:40.800]
You get him, George?

[02:38:40.940 --> 02:38:41.240]
I got him.

[02:38:41.600 --> 02:38:42.520]
And they told you need more?

[02:38:43.260 --> 02:38:44.060]
No, we don't need more.

[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:44.760]
Oh, okay.

[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:45.180]
Thank you.

[02:38:45.300 --> 02:38:45.840]
No problem.

[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:46.920]
Another thing.

[02:38:48.420 --> 02:38:49.420]
Rocky, a Chavariah.

[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:50.820]
He's selling now.

[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:53.520]
He's doing what Bo Griffen used to do with the psychic network.

[02:38:54.980 --> 02:38:55.300]
Yeah.

[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.300]
It's on a cheer desperation, man.

[02:38:58.500 --> 02:39:01.080]
Yeah, I saw it the other day and it freaked me out.

[02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:02.240]
It's a sad thing.

[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.440]
Nick had to be right up there with what's his name from chips?

[02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:06.060]
What else is his name that Eric Astral?

[02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:07.540]
Eric Astral, of that bag.

[02:39:08.040 --> 02:39:09.380]
Oh, and another thing I was open on.

[02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:13.640]
Your hamster this weekend and Lieberman was going door to door, saying hi to everybody.

[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:15.000]
Oh, hey.

[02:39:15.220 --> 02:39:16.100]
You know, I didn't open the door.

[02:39:17.460 --> 02:39:19.020]
I obviously gave you a swarris.

[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:21.360]
At least he's got a nice bathroom in a sense of humor anyway.

[02:39:21.700 --> 02:39:22.420]
All right, Neil.

[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:22.860]
You have an eye.

[02:39:22.880 --> 02:39:23.520]
I've got a right to a pal.

[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:24.260]
I'm going to ask for the help.

[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:24.520]
Thanks.

[02:39:25.260 --> 02:39:27.460]
26 past one at five, 60 WQM.

[02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:28.680]
We got the half hour to go here.

[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:30.160]
And then we got the mad dog at 2D.

[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:32.560]
Wildly unbelievably popular mad dog.

[02:39:32.560 --> 02:39:32.980]
Oh, right.

[02:39:33.080 --> 02:39:35.640]
We want to pull yesterday your favorite sportscaster by what?

[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:36.660]
About 5,000 votes.

[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:37.520]
I mean, it was incredible.

[02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:38.520]
It was a glanslide.

[02:39:39.520 --> 02:39:39.820]
Mm-hmm.

[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:41.160]
Well, they were sliding on it.

[02:39:41.940 --> 02:39:45.220]
Then you got the Humper who's got the probably the softest gig even softer than me.

[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:45.860]
Nice going, Hank.

[02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:46.580]
We're doing it.

[02:39:47.100 --> 02:39:49.240]
Four to six thirty, but an hour that is Bino Cook.

[02:39:49.360 --> 02:39:50.620]
So he's got an hour and a half show today.

[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:51.480]
Same pay.

[02:39:51.740 --> 02:39:52.260]
Nice going, Humper.

[02:39:52.780 --> 02:39:54.060]
Bino Cook, five to six.

[02:39:54.160 --> 02:39:55.420]
We have no idea why.

[02:39:55.860 --> 02:39:57.800]
Marlon's on deck six thirty, seven oh five.

[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:00.560]
The Phillies at the Marlon's the third and final game of this series.

[02:40:00.740 --> 02:40:03.500]
If the Marlon's win, they could at least the tie for the wild card.

[02:40:03.500 --> 02:40:04.840]
And my right sky is that it works.

[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:05.320]
That is correct, sir.

[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:05.760]
Yeah.

[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.900]
So this is a humongous game.

[02:40:07.920 --> 02:40:10.420]
We got all kind of every that promo again before the half hour's out.

[02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:12.100]
And the lots of good stuff going.

[02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:14.540]
Scott for else going to be there with a lot of self-aggrandizing stuff.

[02:40:14.720 --> 02:40:16.080]
Fox Sports is going to have him on the year.

[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:17.900]
They're going to be doing all kinds of things.

[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:19.040]
And it'll be great.

[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:25.020]
And like I said, I'm not trying to pretend I'm jumping on a bandwagon.

[02:40:25.220 --> 02:40:27.060]
Although I'm pleased to see that they're doing very well.

[02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:29.820]
And it's got to be something good happen in that town.

[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:32.260]
Just once in a while, just for a variety, right?

[02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:33.720]
Something positive.

[02:40:33.940 --> 02:40:35.460]
Just for the hell of it to see what it feels like.

[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:38.060]
Eddie K. After the game was forgotten what it feels like.

[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:41.020]
And Joe and Mark overnight would like to feel it two to five in the AM.

[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:45.180]
Before my close personal best new friend, Moa Howard David it.

[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:46.460]
Boy, are we bonding or what, huh?

[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:48.100]
We are.

[02:40:48.100 --> 02:40:51.420]
I mean, you're really doing most of the person, the person bonding,

[02:40:51.560 --> 02:40:54.880]
but even by long distance, I think we're starting to mend our relationship.

[02:40:55.280 --> 02:40:58.600]
Hey, if you're underpaid overworked around or appreciated and would like to have a new high-paying career

And I'm not necessarily a Jewish New Year. That's too soon.

The radio is all yours.

[02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:56.440]
Thank you, A.M.

[02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:02.120]
It's day I, Miami Town.

[02:42:02.780 --> 02:42:06.680]
At 560 WQA.

[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:06.880]
Yeah.

[02:42:09.580 --> 02:42:11.260]
He's a super star.

[02:42:11.540 --> 02:42:13.420]
And then his pants in the NBA is today.

[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:13.940]
Oh.

[02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:15.120]
He's pretty worth it too.

[02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:15.640]
And he's fine.

[02:42:16.020 --> 02:42:17.980]
And then his pants come at day before his day.

[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.240]
And when he calls her, he's too.

[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:22.460]
And he's sweet, she was sharp and he's scared.

[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:24.000]
And then his pants keep on hanging.

[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:26.940]
And he's too sweet, he can bring all his down.

[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:28.760]
And then his pants can't keep it in his pants.

[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:30.380]
So he eats up food.

[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:32.540]
And they had a kiss.

[02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:34.720]
That's what things got to do.

[02:42:34.720 --> 02:42:37.080]
He said, look at him, this.

[02:42:37.620 --> 02:42:39.940]
And as he said, she said,

[02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:41.640]
This they both look back.

[02:42:42.160 --> 02:42:46.200]
On the outside, she is not me and wasn't ashamed.

[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:48.760]
Can't keep it in his pants.

[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:53.300]
Can't keep it in his pants.

[02:42:55.140 --> 02:42:57.720]
That day is evil come frail.

[02:42:58.280 --> 02:42:59.720]
He won the battle of Mauro.

[02:43:00.540 --> 02:43:02.260]
But now he's changed his motto.

[02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:07.000]
No one who she could cheat.

[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:09.280]
No one who could cheat.

[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:11.460]
Unless it's just a little cheat.

[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:16.100]
Now go be knows he's got a good lawyer.

[02:43:16.900 --> 02:43:20.000]
To fake the cheerleader on him through.

[02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000]
His wife won't say a thing.

[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:26.680]
When the field honking rain, her heat is through.

[02:43:28.000 --> 02:43:29.420]
133, I think Robert Blakey,

[02:43:29.460 --> 02:43:31.380]
helped him out if that other guy can't take care of the problem.

[02:43:31.380 --> 02:43:33.780]
We got 138 say body odor,

[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:35.460]
which is double the next closest category.

[02:43:35.660 --> 02:43:36.460]
I got one for you.

[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:37.360]
Okay.

[02:43:37.440 --> 02:43:38.120]
It grows out.

[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:40.920]
And we're going to put it on there because the wording is too difficult.

[02:43:41.720 --> 02:43:43.500]
People who spit when they speak.

[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:44.960]
Okay.

[02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:45.560]
Yes.

[02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:48.360]
Now generally that's older people, even older than me,

[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:49.220]
which is saying a lot.

[02:43:49.300 --> 02:43:50.240]
Generally, but not always.

[02:43:50.460 --> 02:43:51.740]
You know who used to do that all the time?

[02:43:51.840 --> 02:43:54.640]
That hockey guy that Ron, Dr. Ron from Philadelphia,

[02:43:54.660 --> 02:43:56.580]
who used to come and bug me at the games all the time.

[02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.040]
And he'll get like two inches away from your face.

[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:01.980]
And he's spitting as he's speaking.

[02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:03.820]
By the time you get through with a conversation,

[02:44:04.100 --> 02:44:07.080]
you have to have a towel and go take a shower with Ray Whitney,

[02:44:07.320 --> 02:44:08.020]
which sounds pretty good.

[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:09.040]
Those are sprayers.

[02:44:09.620 --> 02:44:10.900]
Well, speaking of sprayers.

[02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:14.580]
You said you've had that experience.

[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:15.140]
Oh, yeah.

[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:15.620]
You could have.

[02:44:15.700 --> 02:44:16.260]
I hate that.

[02:44:16.460 --> 02:44:17.540]
That drives me nuts.

[02:44:17.740 --> 02:44:18.420]
It's the rudest.

[02:44:18.740 --> 02:44:20.840]
And those people, for whatever reason,

[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:22.000]
they always seem to be the one that,

[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:22.920]
when they talk to you,

[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:24.460]
they can't talk like from a normal distance.

[02:44:24.640 --> 02:44:26.000]
That would always have to get up like right in your push.

[02:44:26.380 --> 02:44:27.920]
That's to make sure they get some on you.

[02:44:27.920 --> 02:44:28.800]
And it's usually guys.

[02:44:29.420 --> 02:44:30.820]
It's now seeking to speak in a sprayer.

[02:44:30.900 --> 02:44:32.680]
So I don't want to pick on my close friend, Josh Cordis,

[02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:34.900]
because I would like to squeeze his private for a few minutes.

[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:40.440]
But the QA and website got an update on that.

[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:41.960]
We still don't have anything on there,

[02:44:42.120 --> 02:44:44.880]
in addition to which they still haven't disabled the email thing

[02:44:44.880 --> 02:44:45.580]
under my push.

[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:46.380]
No.

[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:48.820]
Now, how many months has that been?

[02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:49.700]
About 30, man.

[02:44:49.740 --> 02:44:51.060]
No, you're still can click an email.

[02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:53.640]
And the outlook expressing comes up in the email.

[02:44:53.860 --> 02:44:54.780]
And we don't get those.

[02:44:54.920 --> 02:44:55.580]
We don't want them.

[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:56.740]
We don't pay any attention to those.

[02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:59.800]
We don't do emails with the general pedestrian schmucks out there.

[02:45:00.020 --> 02:45:00.740]
It's just ponderous.

[02:45:01.540 --> 02:45:02.360]
They deal with that link.

[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:03.180]
Yeah.

[02:45:03.320 --> 02:45:03.920]
Because remember yesterday,

[02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:05.020]
I didn't know who to send it to.

[02:45:05.140 --> 02:45:06.500]
So I just sent it to him.

[02:45:06.780 --> 02:45:07.980]
Apparently, that has to go to corporate.

[02:45:09.700 --> 02:45:11.380]
What do you mean it has to go to corporate?

[02:45:11.540 --> 02:45:12.600]
What are you talking about?

[02:45:12.820 --> 02:45:14.240]
I'm talking about what I was told.

[02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:14.860]
The double check.

[02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:16.460]
What kind of a horse ball often is that?

[02:45:16.540 --> 02:45:18.280]
Anyways, it's over there to the west coast,

[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:22.600]
where they have to put it on from there after everybody rubber stamps it, of course.

[02:45:23.020 --> 02:45:24.160]
They have to put what on?

[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:26.720]
They have to put our link on from over there.

[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:30.660]
Oh, you're talking about the link to our fundraiser?

[02:45:30.820 --> 02:45:30.940]
Yes.

[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:32.740]
Oh, you have to be kidding me.

[02:45:33.040 --> 02:45:34.180]
You have to be joking me.

[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:37.560]
What a bureaucratic bunch of those picking rednecks, man.

[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:39.080]
With a banjo under thing.

[02:45:40.000 --> 02:45:41.200]
God, that's embarrassing.

[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:42.760]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:43.100]
Hello.

[02:45:44.720 --> 02:45:45.600]
Neil Papadillo.

[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:47.280]
How you doing, Neil?

[02:45:47.440 --> 02:45:47.680]
Okay.

[02:45:48.160 --> 02:45:52.220]
Listen, I want to contribute to your poll a little late, but I'll see how it does.

[02:45:52.680 --> 02:45:54.400]
Have a go into a public toilet.

[02:45:55.060 --> 02:45:59.260]
And you see one that's sitting in a toilet as long as my arm.

[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:02.780]
You understand what I mean with this paper sitting all over the toilet bowl?

[02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:03.780]
I think that's pretty disgusting.

[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:04.840]
It is disgusting.

[02:46:04.880 --> 02:46:05.280]
Good point.

[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:10.020]
I've, in fact, I mentioned last week or the week before that I've been, I've been the official foreflusher in town.

[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:12.120]
With bad luck public toilets.

[02:46:12.320 --> 02:46:15.600]
Always seem to be following by a fairly short, short period of time.

[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:18.600]
Somebody who just don't know how to make that thing disappear.

[02:46:20.440 --> 02:46:25.120]
People who are from like any fifth world countries who just don't understand the wonders of indoor plumbing.

[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:26.780]
Thomas Crapper would be embarrassed.

[02:46:27.040 --> 02:46:27.780]
How do we phrase that?

[02:46:27.860 --> 02:46:28.860]
Because that is a good one.

[02:46:30.720 --> 02:46:31.680]
Ah, yeah.

[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:33.800]
The remains of the day.

[02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.020]
An unflushed bowl.

[02:46:37.060 --> 02:46:38.200]
I think that's good.

[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:39.000]
Okay.

[02:46:39.400 --> 02:46:41.400]
An unflushed bowl.

[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:42.580]
Hmm.

[02:46:43.320 --> 02:46:44.020]
Man, oh man.

[02:46:45.240 --> 02:46:48.820]
The aroma of the vision, the whole ambiance.

[02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:51.760]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:51.960]
Hello.

[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:53.200]
Hi there, Neil.

[02:46:53.680 --> 02:46:53.980]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:56.500]
If the girl doesn't think I lose my kink.

[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:00.080]
That's Reverend Jones again, isn't it?

[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:01.600]
You're right.

[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.060]
He is.

[02:47:02.140 --> 02:47:02.980]
He needs to be eliminated.

[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.680]
He needs to be eradicated.

[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:10.740]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:13.740]
By the way, Dick Feigberg said if you ever show your ugly face at the track again,

[02:47:13.740 --> 02:47:16.640]
he's going to bring in Luca Brotsey and FedRarch to take care of you.

[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:16.920]
Okay.

[02:47:17.180 --> 02:47:18.780]
Schmuck, Invisil, Lunatic.

[02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.100]
There's one thing you forgot to tell him though.

[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:23.000]
Tad.

[02:47:23.360 --> 02:47:23.920]
You're gay.

[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:28.940]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:47:29.240 --> 02:47:32.240]
Don't go on hold on the AT&T Line for four hours listed in the Marlin game

[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:32.760]
because of my car.

[02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:33.420]
I've got a couple of bucks.

[02:47:33.720 --> 02:47:34.500]
Oh no, go ahead.

[02:47:34.660 --> 02:47:34.940]
Do that.

[02:47:35.300 --> 02:47:36.220]
Or just go ahead and do it.

[02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:36.920]
They can use your money.

[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:39.600]
Here's a call from Dania.

[02:47:39.680 --> 02:47:39.880]
Hello.

[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:40.820]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:41.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:47:41.740 --> 02:47:42.120]
How are you?

[02:47:42.120 --> 02:47:42.720]
Great.

[02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:46.740]
I don't have anything to add to your poll, but I have a couple of spy reports for you.

[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:47.260]
Go right ahead.

[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:52.400]
Guess who's preaching on Trinity Broadcasting when I was channel surfing the other night?

[02:47:53.240 --> 02:47:57.000]
Justice, Chief Justice Moore from the Alabama Supreme Court.

[02:47:57.080 --> 02:47:58.240]
Oh my God.

[02:47:58.340 --> 02:47:58.860]
Oh my God.

[02:47:59.020 --> 02:47:59.140]
Yeah.

[02:48:00.260 --> 02:48:02.360]
And there was a fire, fire and brimstown too.

[02:48:03.580 --> 02:48:04.400]
Wait a minute.

[02:48:04.640 --> 02:48:07.840]
Of course, Schwarzenegger and McClintock, Tom McClintock appeared.

[02:48:08.100 --> 02:48:09.220]
It's a debate last night.

[02:48:09.220 --> 02:48:10.880]
Schwarzenegger was involved in a lot of them.

[02:48:10.900 --> 02:48:11.220]
I'm not saying.

[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:16.860]
Bickering with the other candidates, particularly area in Huffington, Robert Sussan, Schwarzenegger

[02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:17.540]
was involved in...

[02:48:17.540 --> 02:48:18.000]
Oh, I see.

[02:48:18.100 --> 02:48:19.620]
I thought maybe McClintock was dropping out.

[02:48:19.820 --> 02:48:23.260]
Representative Issa, the one who started this whole recall that fascist to put up all

[02:48:23.260 --> 02:48:25.200]
the money, he's endorsing Schwarzenegger.

[02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:25.560]
Big deal.

[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:26.060]
Okay, go ahead.

[02:48:26.100 --> 02:48:26.340]
I'm sorry.

[02:48:26.820 --> 02:48:28.280]
Yeah, that was my first spy report.

[02:48:28.760 --> 02:48:31.380]
Justice Moore was to an approach job on TBN.

[02:48:31.740 --> 02:48:36.520]
And my second one was, guess who's complaining about people, as he would say, the liberals

[02:48:36.520 --> 02:48:39.600]
who are criticizing are president.

[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:40.760]
Maybe, Rush?

[02:48:41.140 --> 02:48:42.280]
You believe that?

[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:45.580]
Isn't that the kettle calling the lid black?

[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:46.200]
Yeah.

[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:48.200]
About eight years criticizing Bill Clinton.

[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:50.980]
Now, let's see, how many people do you say the Clinton's murdered?

[02:48:51.060 --> 02:48:51.880]
Five third, man.

[02:48:52.060 --> 02:48:52.220]
Yeah.

[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:52.880]
Yeah.

[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:56.400]
And every day now, it's like my friend's telling me, because I don't listen to him.

[02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:57.580]
I have this conservative friend.

[02:48:57.740 --> 02:49:03.200]
They say he's lost all credibility because now he's turned into this person that the liberals

[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.200]
find it patriotic to criticize our president.

[02:49:07.140 --> 02:49:07.260]
Yeah.

[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:10.720]
Now, let's screw him and just keep in mind, did he ever see him and Hermann Gehring together?

[02:49:10.800 --> 02:49:12.100]
They got little mustache, his though, too.

[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:12.580]
Exactly.

[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:13.240]
Have a great day.

[02:49:13.340 --> 02:49:13.460]
Yeah.

[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.600]
Hermann Gehring did not have a mustache.

[02:49:16.140 --> 02:49:17.460]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60.

[02:49:19.200 --> 02:49:23.720]
How many people in the audience, how many people in America think could identify Hermann Gehring?

[02:49:24.580 --> 02:49:24.900]
Two.

[02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:29.080]
If he worked, if he, like, with the storm troopers, not going to do it now right now.

[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:31.420]
How many people say, oh my god, Hermann, how about some lunch?

[02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:32.600]
You know what I'm going to have for lunch?

[02:49:32.620 --> 02:49:34.580]
I was inspired by that Anne Colter bit.

[02:49:36.300 --> 02:49:36.800]
That the...

[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:37.200]
Got a re-appuss?

[02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:38.440]
Got a re-appuss bit.

[02:49:39.020 --> 02:49:42.400]
Now, I'm not going to have got a re-appuss for lunch, although that soft serve plus sounds good for dessert.

[02:49:42.600 --> 02:49:42.920]
That's right.

[02:49:42.940 --> 02:49:47.440]
But I'm thinking of, yeah, the pastrami, I'm going to have a Rubens sandwich, because the pastrami inspired me.

[02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:47.960]
Very good, Scott.

[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:48.500]
Huh?

[02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:51.100]
Don't you like a good Rubens sandwich?

[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:51.580]
Yes, I do.

[02:49:52.060 --> 02:49:53.840]
And I know right to get one to...

[02:49:53.840 --> 02:49:56.200]
The weapons of mass destruction, I'll do that story after the break.

[02:49:56.380 --> 02:49:56.880]
There aren't any.

[02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:57.920]
Our Rubens core beef, though.

[02:49:59.320 --> 02:49:59.640]
Yeah.

[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:26.160]
Well, sometimes, I don't know.

[02:50:26.160 --> 02:50:29.600]
Are they really corn-be-for-pre-strawberry?

[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:29.600]

[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:31.620]
I'm going to have a QM if you're tired of that bald spot.

[02:50:31.760 --> 02:50:33.600]
And of course, this is part of the mystery of life.

[02:50:33.700 --> 02:50:37.900]
What happens to guys who used to look so good in their hair start going right the out the old drain?

[02:50:37.900 --> 02:50:39.420]
It happens to just about all of us.

[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:43.340]
But Charles Alfieri, that's why he's a godsend, so to speak from...

[02:50:43.340 --> 02:50:44.060]
Oh, God.

[02:50:44.300 --> 02:50:45.880]
...because for over 25 years now,

[02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:49.640]
Charlie, working with the famous, and not so famous, and even schleppers like most of you,

[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:54.640]
gets people looking great because he's got the best look in the system in the world, the natural hairline system.

[02:50:54.640 --> 02:50:59.200]
Not a ready-looking thing that looks like an animal crawled up on your head and just is camping out.

[02:50:59.440 --> 02:51:03.160]
Not holes in the head with the blood gripping down your forehead and everybody laughing their ass off at you.

[02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:05.820]
Not dangerous pills that will probably propitioff.

[02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:09.080]
But Charlie's got the natural hairline system that looks like real hair.

[02:51:09.140 --> 02:51:09.920]
It's going out of your scalp.

[02:51:10.340 --> 02:51:13.600]
And you have nothing loose but that shiny, grotesque, embarrassing, aging bald spot

[02:51:13.600 --> 02:51:16.380]
because everybody gets Charlie's 30-day guarantee.

[02:51:16.860 --> 02:51:19.900]
You wear the piece for 30 days if you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells.

[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:23.000]
If you're not getting service at least 15, 20, 30 times a day,

[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.840]
just bring it back and you get your money back.

We're sports radio 560, QAM.

[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:55.820]
It's Pee Wee Herman, take it from me.

[02:51:56.220 --> 02:51:58.380]
They don't come any better than Neil Rogers.

[02:51:59.340 --> 02:52:00.480]
Are you fat?

[02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:04.620]
When you sunbathe at the beach, does Greenpeace try to push you back into the water?

[02:52:04.860 --> 02:52:08.340]
Did your IQ drop one point for each pound you lost on FanFan?

[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.960]
If you answered yes to any of these questions,

[02:52:11.420 --> 02:52:14.760]
you need the 100% guaranteed diet system.

[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:25.420]
Mmm, mmm.

[02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:28.320]
That fried chicken looks delicious.

[02:52:30.600 --> 02:52:31.600]
Oh my god.

[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:33.760]
I think I'm going to be sick.

[02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:37.400]
Flam Flam, the weight-law system that really works.

[02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:41.600]
I'll pass on that Danish.

[02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:43.240]
I think I'm going to be sick.

[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:45.500]
But I do have room for my Ruben sandwich.

[02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:50.700]
146 at 560, WDKM, George is under so much duress and stress, he's actually faxing me.

[02:52:50.840 --> 02:52:52.620]
Oh, this is just emailing and faxing.

[02:52:52.840 --> 02:52:52.960]
Yeah.

[02:52:53.200 --> 02:52:53.940]
Just to make sure.

[02:52:53.960 --> 02:52:55.320]
No, I don't know about that unflush bowl.

[02:52:55.460 --> 02:52:56.980]
I was thinking maybe a better way of putting that.

[02:52:57.140 --> 02:52:58.180]
And I'll let you judge.

[02:52:58.380 --> 02:52:59.180]
Tards in the tank.

[02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:01.720]
Thanks for the memories.

[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:02.340]
Huh?

[02:53:02.660 --> 02:53:06.720]
Because unflush bowl could mean, I mean, somebody could pee too and just, I mean, that's not a big deal, huh?

[02:53:07.040 --> 02:53:07.940]
Left over floaters.

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.400]
I don't know.

[02:53:08.500 --> 02:53:09.400]
I don't think it fits.

[02:53:09.400 --> 02:53:13.580]
I thought we were talking about something that a person can have going on that grosses you out.

[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:15.140]
That's what all this other stuff is.

[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:16.560]
Well, let me read the question again.

[02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:16.840]
Okay.

[02:53:17.100 --> 02:53:18.600]
What's your biggest gross out?

[02:53:18.620 --> 02:53:19.780]
I guess it's all inclusive.

[02:53:19.940 --> 02:53:20.700]
Tards in the tank.

[02:53:21.020 --> 02:53:21.260]
All right.

[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:23.040]
I think that's a perfect answer.

[02:53:23.300 --> 02:53:23.520]
Don't you?

[02:53:24.660 --> 02:53:25.140]
Don't you think so?

[02:53:25.140 --> 02:53:25.460]
Don't you think so?

[02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:25.860]

[02:53:26.380 --> 02:53:26.760]
He's answering.

[02:53:27.300 --> 02:53:28.260]
The old turd in the tank?

[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:28.960]
He's on the toes.

[02:53:29.780 --> 02:53:31.140]
Oh, maybe you just never seen any, huh?

[02:53:31.780 --> 02:53:32.260]
Oh, yeah.

[02:53:32.840 --> 02:53:33.200]
Oh.

[02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:34.800]
Oh, remember that picture that Jason did.

[02:53:34.880 --> 02:53:35.540]
And let me ask you this.

[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:37.920]
Why does it always seem before he asked me about the picture?

[02:53:37.920 --> 02:53:41.760]
Why does it always seem that the people who do that are the ones who leave the most

[02:53:43.020 --> 02:53:44.440]
rotesque, ungodly, mess-been?

[02:53:44.680 --> 02:53:47.500]
Not just like a little delicate, you know, like maybe one floater in there.

[02:53:47.560 --> 02:53:47.560]

[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:51.120]
But horrendous, gruesome, bull-full of mong.

[02:53:52.180 --> 02:53:52.640]
Murphy's law.

[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:53.600]
Is that it?

[02:53:53.780 --> 02:53:53.940]
Sure.

[02:53:54.300 --> 02:53:55.120]
Maybe Murphy done it.

[02:53:55.660 --> 02:53:56.760]
So those Irish turds.

[02:53:57.360 --> 02:53:59.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:53:59.960 --> 02:54:00.740]
I got to do this story.

[02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:01.500]
I just have to.

[02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:06.440]
No weapons of mass destruction have been found in Iraq by the group looking for them.

[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:12.040]
According to a Bush administration source who has spoken to the BBC, this will be the conclusion

[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:15.900]
of the Iraq Survey Groups Interim Report source told the presenter of BBC's television

[02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:21.220]
daily's public show Andrew Neil, Downing Street brand of the story, speculation about an unfinished

[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:22.520]
draft of an interim report.

[02:54:22.780 --> 02:54:23.020]
Right.

[02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:27.780]
Mr. Neil said the draft report, which the source said is due to be published next month,

[02:54:28.100 --> 02:54:32.560]
concludes that it is highly unlikely that weapons of mass destruction were shipped out of the country

[02:54:32.560 --> 02:54:34.740]
and places like Syria before the Westland War in Iraq.

[02:54:35.260 --> 02:54:39.620]
The bottom line is, as Mr. Neil, that the team has found no weapons of mass destruction.

[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:46.620]
It also says that Sodom was saying about a huge program to deceive and hint to the work of UN and weapons inspectors.

[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:51.260]
Mr. Roniel said that according to the source, the report will say it's inspectors not even on Earth.

[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:55.120]
My newt amounts of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons material.

[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:00.320]
I've also not uncovered any laboratory involved in deploying weapons of mass destruction

[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:02.740]
and no delivery systems for the weapons.

[02:55:03.040 --> 02:55:06.480]
What about those underground rail cars with the mobile laboratories in them?

[02:55:07.040 --> 02:55:11.060]
You know, the report would publish computer programs, files, pictures, and paperwork,

[02:55:11.460 --> 02:55:17.300]
which it says shows that Sodom's regime was attempting to develop a weapons of mass destruction program.

[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:19.620]
But he liked that.

[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:20.140]
Okay.

[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:22.680]
So there are no weapons of mass destruction.

[02:55:23.120 --> 02:55:23.740]
There weren't any.

[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:24.660]
There aren't any.

[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:25.600]
He was thinking about it.

[02:55:25.640 --> 02:55:26.400]
He was working on it.

[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:27.360]
He was hoping for it.

[02:55:27.360 --> 02:55:28.140]
But there weren't any.

[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:32.660]
And that's why all those people over there were dying and did die and are continuing to die every single day.

[02:55:34.040 --> 02:55:34.480]
Unbelievable.

[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:39.140]
I still can't get over that thing about corporate has to permit.

[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:44.180]
See, so in other words, they really aren't putting the thing on, promoting our campaign.

[02:55:44.740 --> 02:55:46.000]
A little bit on the label.

[02:55:46.040 --> 02:55:46.680]
They're thinking about it.

[02:55:46.700 --> 02:55:46.820]
Yeah.

[02:55:47.240 --> 02:55:48.920]
They have to pass it by buffus over there.

[02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:49.920]
Bufus and buffus.

[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.660]
Just remember who is the administrator of all of WQIM's web presences.

[02:55:55.200 --> 02:55:56.080]
And who's that?

[02:55:56.080 --> 02:55:57.000]
Oh, you know.

[02:55:58.320 --> 02:55:59.280]
No, I don't.

[02:55:59.380 --> 02:55:59.820]
Sure you do.

[02:56:00.780 --> 02:56:02.240]
Who's the former God of your clue?

[02:56:02.540 --> 02:56:04.940]
The corporate computer maven, your dinner buddy.

[02:56:06.140 --> 02:56:06.980]
Oh, Bob Vermouth?

[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:07.340]
Yeah.

[02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:09.060]
What the hell does he got to do with it?

[02:56:09.100 --> 02:56:10.060]
He's an African engineer.

[02:56:10.220 --> 02:56:11.740]
What does he have to do with our God damn website?

[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:13.600]
Not our website, their website.

[02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:16.460]
Oh, God, what an asshole.

[02:56:17.800 --> 02:56:18.860]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:56:18.860 --> 02:56:19.200]
Hello.

[02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:20.600]
Leo.

[02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:21.500]
Yes, sir.

[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:22.800]
Marie Kong.

[02:56:23.500 --> 02:56:24.320]
Yeah, back at you.

[02:56:24.820 --> 02:56:25.200]
Schmuck.

[02:56:25.800 --> 02:56:26.860]
Here's a call from Tampa.

[02:56:27.020 --> 02:56:27.180]
Hello.

[02:56:27.580 --> 02:56:28.380]
Leo, how you doing?

[02:56:28.680 --> 02:56:29.000]
Pretty good.

[02:56:29.220 --> 02:56:30.540]
Hey, I'm calling from Tampa, man.

[02:56:30.740 --> 02:56:35.320]
I first started listening to you when you were on S.U.N. with blahblaster.

[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:36.240]
Oh, yeah.

[02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:41.220]
I'm so glad you're on the, we can catch you on streaming now because I was not here all

[02:56:41.220 --> 02:56:41.480]
of time.

[02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:41.920]
Me too.

[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:47.180]
And one thing you got to say when your gross out list, the turns in the tank was good, by the way.

[02:56:47.340 --> 02:56:49.980]
But for me, it's guys with the man teats.

[02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:54.400]
When I see it, when it doesn't grow for when I'm going down a beach and you got some guy coming

[02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:57.300]
down, it looks like he should be wearing a double D. It's disgusting.

[02:56:57.680 --> 02:56:58.300]
Yeah, you're right.

[02:56:58.860 --> 02:56:59.660]
That's a good point.

[02:56:59.780 --> 02:57:01.240]
Guys with gigantic teats.

[02:57:02.060 --> 02:57:02.960]
But I'm glad you're here.

[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:03.940]
It's last year with Sason.

[02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:04.740]
He had a pair.

[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:05.640]
Holy cow.

[02:57:06.220 --> 02:57:06.220]

[02:57:06.760 --> 02:57:07.020]
Do you?

[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:08.640]
Go ahead.

[02:57:09.320 --> 02:57:15.440]
Do you still have a, you used to play a cut all the time on the air, but I know it wouldn't be any good in Miami because no one

[02:57:15.440 --> 02:57:18.580]
knows who last year is, but blahblaster disease.

[02:57:18.820 --> 02:57:19.220]
That was great.

[02:57:19.340 --> 02:57:19.920]
Is that on your website?

[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.640]
Do we have blahblaster disease?

[02:57:23.440 --> 02:57:24.800]
George, I wouldn't know on the website.

[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:27.400]
We have blahblaster disease.

[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:27.400]

[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:28.480]
I know we have blahblaster disease.

[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:29.820]
Do you want?

[02:57:30.060 --> 02:57:31.720]
If it's on the site, I'll go look for it.

[02:57:31.780 --> 02:57:32.400]
That was a great bit.

[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:35.840]
I mean, I know that most of people in Tampa, I'm sure it's Tampa.

[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:37.120]
Oh, George is playing it right now.

[02:57:37.240 --> 02:57:37.760]
Oh, it is.

[02:57:37.920 --> 02:57:38.460]
In the city.

[02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:40.760]
You're going to play it right after the break of George, you'll cut the crap.

[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:42.180]
I think I'll take care of it.

[02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:42.840]
Thanks for the memories.

[02:57:43.460 --> 02:57:44.640]
There's a good guy from Tampa.

[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:46.740]
There's a few people over there in Tampa, real people.

[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:47.600]
But third man.

[02:57:47.600 --> 02:57:51.440]
I asked people around a bunch of mugwams who are like in bread from downhill from Tennessee,

[02:57:51.700 --> 02:57:54.360]
washed down the river, the Cahulawasi, to Joja.

[02:57:54.980 --> 02:57:56.280]
There's some nice people in Tampa.

[02:57:56.760 --> 02:57:59.800]
In fact, that was, you know, it started out pretty good there on SUN.

[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:00.820]
That's something happened.

[02:58:01.720 --> 02:58:03.020]
I think two things happened.

[02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:05.640]
Number one, when what's her name?

[02:58:05.940 --> 02:58:06.580]
When the goddess?

[02:58:07.020 --> 02:58:09.680]
When she started doing that bull-dike routine.

[02:58:09.980 --> 02:58:11.020]
I think that was a little bit much.

[02:58:11.160 --> 02:58:12.520]
They could handle one bag on here.

[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:16.700]
But when she started doing that thing with the lap dances and all the other crap in the strip club.

[02:58:17.160 --> 02:58:18.880]
Yeah, that didn't go over too well.

[02:58:19.060 --> 02:58:20.700]
And then, when Lasseter started sandbagging,

[02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:24.940]
I was probably like, that was the last nail in our coffin, if it gets my drip.

[02:58:26.420 --> 02:58:27.880]
So it started out with great promise.

[02:58:28.020 --> 02:58:29.140]
Remember that appearance we had at the mall?

[02:58:29.220 --> 02:58:30.600]
There were like 5,000 people showed up.

[02:58:30.660 --> 02:58:31.680]
Hey, we love you guys.

[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:34.500]
And then they decided they hated it just like poison.

[02:58:35.900 --> 02:58:38.000]
But if you don't like the show, check back with us later on.

[02:58:38.040 --> 02:58:39.920]
We might have something on you like 12.

[02:58:43.280 --> 02:58:45.080]
Remember all those great people that was hurt?

[02:58:45.080 --> 02:58:46.700]
What the hell was their Susie short skirts?

[02:58:46.700 --> 02:58:47.420]
Wasn't that her name?

[02:58:47.720 --> 02:58:48.240]
That's right.

[02:58:48.840 --> 02:58:51.420]
Finally, Marie Hirsch, she finally corralled his little ass in.

[02:58:51.640 --> 02:58:52.700]
And then there was Tom Belvita.

[02:58:52.780 --> 02:58:53.600]
By the geek, yeah.

[02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:55.860]
He was okay. He was a good guy.

[02:58:56.820 --> 02:58:57.920]
A real geek, but a good guy.

[02:58:58.440 --> 02:59:02.360]

Helen Box was a normal man with a nice home, a lovely family, and a cushy job with his father-in-law's company.

[03:00:42.020 --> 03:00:44.900]
Normal that is until just three weeks ago.

[03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:48.320]
Hi honey, how was your day?

[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.780]
Someone of a necessary Monday I feared will end up being but nonetheless,

[03:00:52.040 --> 03:00:54.860]
let me see if I can't focus it in to the best of my ability.

[03:00:54.860 --> 03:00:56.860]

[03:00:57.540 --> 03:00:59.100]
Bob Lasseter disease.

[03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:01.180]
Are you feeling alright, Alan?

[03:01:01.640 --> 03:01:02.660]
Absolutely insane.

[03:01:03.520 --> 03:01:05.340]
I see things that nobody else seems to see.

[03:01:05.920 --> 03:01:07.860]
Or at least, cares to admit that they say...

[03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:15.940]
Bob Lasseter disease attacks the central nervous system, causing otherwise normal people to communicate like suicidal maniacs.

[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:16.860]
To hell with you today.

[03:01:17.400 --> 03:01:18.480]
I don't want to talk to you.

[03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:24.080]
What's more, Bob Lasseter disease is the one form of depression which is actually contagious.

[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:28.040]
God, just listening to that voice, I want to jump off a building.

[03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:32.260]

Fetching and mourning and screaming and hollering.

[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:46.740]
Please help.

[03:01:47.260 --> 03:01:48.200]
Yeah, he didn't need help.

[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:50.480]
And he's long gone. He won't hear him no more.

[03:01:51.720 --> 03:01:53.380]
Anyway, boy, we shouldn't have a lot of time.

[03:01:53.500 --> 03:01:54.740]

And why is it also there's another one?

[03:02:03.140 --> 03:02:05.380]
