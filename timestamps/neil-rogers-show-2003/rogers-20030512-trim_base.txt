[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:48.720]
Which make sense.

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:49.900]
Unknown question mark

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:49.900]

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:49.900]

[00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.060]
season and today basically

[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:50.080]
we are still safe.

[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.080]

[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.080]

[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.080]

[00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:50.220]
All of you can watch my first

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.500]
I get some kind of a game.

[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.220]
Well, did we find any weapons of mass destruction in Ozot?

[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:56.500]
No.

[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:59.340]
See, they keep floating these stories every week.

[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.060]
We get a whole bunch of them.

[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:02.740]
And then come to find out there's nothing.

[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.520]
They don't have no anthrax. They got no VX. They got no nothing.

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:06.780]
We ain't got no nothing.

[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:09.640]
But they just keep floating the stories out there.

[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.280]
And then you'll notice that they disappear off.

[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.800]
I just check, for example, CNN and MSNBC,

[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.800]
a whole bunch of other websites.

[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:16.120]
After you sent me that facts.

[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.040]
Nothing.

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.400]
Nothing, honey.

[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:19.900]
Speaking of games.

[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.600]
Oh, and also before I get into that.

[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.600]
Finally, the Sunset and Rule discovered the Apatriot Act.

[00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:27.760]
There was a story in there over the weekend.

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.600]
I think we had it yesterday.

[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.000]
Or was it Saturday, beater?

[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.360]
I think it was Saturday.

[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.640]
Whatever day we had, I got it here somewhere.

[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.200]
I saved it.

[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.480]
About all the Apatriot Act initiatives

[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.100]
disturbed civil libertarians, which was like I said yesterday.

[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:43.960]
And it's a, you know, it's a, whatever. It's a story.

[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.180]
I didn't see.

[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:47.520]
I checked the letters to the editor in both the Sunset and the Rule

[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:49.840]
and the Harold all weekend long, including this morning.

[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.460]
Did I see one letter in there about the

[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.160]
Broward County resolution about the Apatriot Act?

[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.340]
No.

[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.080]
So this is part of the course.

[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.740]
I didn't sit here on the air and get all whipped up into a frenzy

[00:15:58.740 --> 00:15:59.760]
and get all indignant.

[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.300]
Nobody gives a flying crap.

[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.460]
And these people, these bush liquors out there,

[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.460]
just like that fact I just got, like a bunch of overgrown little children.

[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.740]
Like I see, we told you so.

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:12.140]
We told you as if even if they find all kinds of stuff there.

[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.080]
Anybody with half a brain now is now that he didn't represent a threat to us.

[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.480]
Also, I had nothing to do with 9-11.

[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.980]
That was all a bunch of bull crap.

[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.520]
We've got 85,000 stories on our website just over the weekend

[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.240]
between Friday, Saturday, yesterday about what it's really all about.

[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:30.040]
But don't confuse us with the facts because we found some crap.

[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.740]
You know, we had, there was some crap going on.

[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:32.880]
Right.

[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.520]
And I noticed that the lawyer that cut everybody, Randy, was at his name.

[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.380]
That cut everybody all whipped up about the resolution with a Broward commission.

[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.780]
I never heard from him again.

[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.120]
I see no letter of the editor.

[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.460]
If anybody sent any letters about that, they didn't get published.

[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.680]
And we sure ought to find out about it.

[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:47.840]
But I'm through with that.

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.300]
I'm through, you know, being used on this radio show for other people's purposes

[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.700]
to get all whipped up into a frenzy.

[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.820]
And then, you know, that's it.

[00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:55.480]
That's the end of it.

[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.660]
Like some kind of an exercise.

[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:01.920]
Which, of course, is nothing wrong with the exercise as you let the spoon tear mouth.

[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.280]
With your score's ice cream.

[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:04.780]

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.800]
Mmm. It was pretty damn good, too.

[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:07.980]
Dangerous.

[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.540]
See, I think there ought to be a law that at the very least they should make,

[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.680]
have to make pints any flavor that they make.

[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.360]
Should have to be available in pints, courts, and half gallons.

[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.300]
Right?

[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:20.840]
Okay.

[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.820]
Or at the very least this should be like an elephant should come in courts.

[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.000]
I did see three interesting movies over the weekend.

[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.420]
California, Brad Pitt.

[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.840]
That was pretty good.

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.340]
Huh?

[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:33.920]
Yeah.

[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:38.040]
Oh yeah, he had a little bit of a problem.

[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.420]
Whatever that sound was, he could make it.

[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.200]
And he had that other problem, too.

[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:43.040]
Yeah.

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:44.780]
I was good.

[00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.000]
And he had something, I don't mind David the company.

[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.600]
It's just that I don't dislike him.

[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.400]
I just realized it's the ex files I hate.

[00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.140]
Right.

[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.340]
He, well, I hate that show.

[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.060]
Oh, I hold you.

[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.740]
He was perfect for that role in that movie.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.280]
Yeah, he was good.

[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:56.320]
Everybody was good in that movie.

[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:56.960]
It was just fine.

[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.080]
It was good.

[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.160]
I give it about eight and a half.

[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:02.020]
And I saw the game with Michael Douglas.

[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:03.300]
I give that about an eleven.

[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.360]
That was great.

[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.140]
How come you didn't play that one up the way you should have?

[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.900]
That's a great movie.

[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.140]
Because I don't know what you like.

[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:10.460]
I like that one, but I mean,

[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.220]
I didn't know if you would.

[00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:13.040]
You know what I like?

[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:15.840]
I saw it on our website over the weekend.

[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:16.460]
I saw Aaron.

[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.580]
You know what I like.

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:18.740]
Now the game was excellent.

[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.220]
And the guy that played the TV news guy.

[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.580]
The TV news guy.

[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:24.640]
The TV news guy.

[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.520]
He was the, in the tell that Mr. Ripley played the Jewel law's father in that movie.

[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:29.180]
He's a good actor.

[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.320]
But that was great.

[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:34.900]
And of course, it just keeps going on and on and twist you and turn you.

[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.000]
It was sensational.

[00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.800]
I give that one of the best that I've seen in the recent memory.

[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:39.580]
And the ending game.

[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:40.060]
It's a point.

[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.000]
No.

[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.200]
Well, and in the very ending, they're right at the end.

[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:43.860]
It's like, huh?

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.160]
Are we going to start all over again?

[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:45.920]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.300]
That's what he's thinking.

[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:47.800]
You know what?

[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:49.340]
But I'll have to let you watch it.

[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.760]
And then last night, American Psycho, which happened to be on the independent film channel

[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:54.300]
last night.

[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.360]
I give that about a nine.

[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:57.900]
Nine.

[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:58.760]
It was good.

[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.640]
Especially anybody out there who likes Christian veils who did a great job of acting.

[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:03.500]
But he was like naked.

[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:03.920]
The whole movie.

[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.200]
That's about 90% of the movie.

[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:06.160]
Acid.

[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.560]
The scene where he's running down the hall with the spattered wood blood with the chainsaw.

[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:12.380]
Naked.

[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:13.140]
That was pretty good.

[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.080]
It's the thing he didn't drop it.

[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:21.100]
You've got to have real confidence to be running down the hall naked with a chainsaw

[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:22.860]
on your hand with that blade-waring.

[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:24.520]
But anyway, I give that about a nine.

[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:25.480]
George hasn't seen it yet.

[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.280]
American Psycho.

[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:26.960]
You better get with it.

[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:32.640]
And also the bad news is since we're movie intensive can't find happiness in South Florida.

[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.760]
No, and that's going to be our, and that's going to be a big billboard campaign.

[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.900]
You won't find happiness in South Florida.

[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.820]
Never have true words been spoken.

[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.460]
I'd be really happy to know where I could go to get it, even if I've to slip out to the

[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.300]
pines or something.

[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:50.540]
And don't be saying blockbuster because nobody in their right mind wants a watered-down, censored

[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:50.860]
version.

[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.760]
I mean, that scandal is in itself, right?

[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.560]
Well, what kind of cramp is that?

[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.420]
That some bunch of blue noses are going to censor what you're going to see in a movie?

[00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:00.060]
If you're going to go to red or buy a movie, you want to see the real thing.

[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:04.420]
Not like some sanitized version that they decide is suitable for family viewing.

[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.340]
What does that movie's got to be rated PG anyway, right?

[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.020]
It's the very least.

[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.260]
Now, it's got to be R.

[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:13.520]
I don't know.

[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:14.520]
I would have had this.

[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:15.460]
I was going to be R rated.

[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:18.700]
There's too much perversion in it and language.

[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.160]
So, so like I said, so if it's R rated, what's the problem?

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.420]
There's still isn't satisfied you assholes at blockbuster.

[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.620]
Everything's got to be censored.

[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.440]
Here's a call from West Palm Beach.

[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:29.720]
Hello.

[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.300]
Neil.

[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.640]
I've got a movie for you that I know you're going to love.

[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.300]
No one's brought this up yet.

[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.260]
It's called Run Lola Run.

[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:41.780]
Yeah.

[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.680]
I'm telling you, write it down.

[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.300]
And after you see, you're going to be on the air talking about it.

[00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.420]
Run Lola Run.

[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.020]
Yeah.

[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.720]
And what's that about?

[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:50.440]
It's excellent.

[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.740]
I don't want to tell you what it's about.

[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.840]
Well, I mean, just give me an idea what it's about.

[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.860]
I don't have to tell me the ending.

[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:57.540]
But what's it?

[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.180]
Well, it's kind of an intriguing movie.

[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:07.580]
It's more along the lines of all the usual suspects as opposed to a shoot-a-mob Bruce Willis movie.

[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.180]
You know, it's more of an intellectual movie that I know you'll enjoy.

[00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:11.700]
Okay.

[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.880]
Just for when you talk and type movies you like, I'm telling you, Run Lola Run.

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:16.660]
Okay.

[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:17.420]
All right.

[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:17.860]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:18.460]
I'm on my way.

[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.880]
When I get my score, I scream, I'm going to go over and they'll get that.

[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:21.620]
I heard about it.

[00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.280]
It's supposed to be good.

[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.000]
That's what he just said.

[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.680]
He said, he said, it's pretty god damn good is what he said.

[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.600]
We're still movie intensive this week and there are probably some people who are still doing that on a pool.

[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:29.960]
Yeah.

[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.980]
I like to pull a question today but I have no idea what answers we're going to get.

[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.780]
But it's going to open up a real Pandora's box because you know this audience.

[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.060]
Who is them?

[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.220]
And again, I'm going to try to read it very clearly.

[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:45.120]
Very succinctly, right to the point.

[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:50.140]
And I even put a couple on there with my own, even though they're way old, but that's because I'm an old fart.

[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:53.240]
Who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[00:21:53.240 --> 00:22:01.020]
We're talking about people who never really got the credit as being in that top wrong, you know, like a brando or rubber duval or a bowguard.

[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.440]
People never got that kind of credit, but people who really are great, but are underrated.

[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.320]
And we're not asking for a list of ten.

[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.200]
Well, I got a few for you.

[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.020]
No.

[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.120]
Who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:17.800]
And I got two, Lee J. Cobb, who I think is great.

[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.460]
Right.

[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.080]
And Joseph Cotton, which even George knows Joseph Cotton.

[00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:21.380]
Sure.

[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:23.840]
He was in more goddamn great movies.

[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:32.140]
And I'm not saying he wasn't a leading man at times, but he was never considered like a bowguard or a William Holden or one of those people.

[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:33.800]
Right?

[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.200]
Right.

[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:35.600]
He was a great actor.

[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:36.860]
He's no cotton mother.

[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.660]
He was no cotton pick and what?

[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.060]
So that's the poll question for today.

[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.600]
And of course, the audience will help us fill it out.

[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.880]
And I'm sure we'll get many amusing.

[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.680]
How about Marlon Brando?

[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:49.700]
No, we're talking about...

[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:50.920]
You'll see.

[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.440]
We'll get some of those because we got some real loser.

[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.800]
I mean, some real winners off.

[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.140]
I'm just going to take the aspirin now.

[00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.280]
Please.

[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.400]
Take two.

[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.860]
In fact, don't stand up real fast because they have a tendency to fall out.

[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:04.540]
926.

[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.860]
And I did watch your Requiem for Dream again over the weekend.

[00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:08.140]
I don't care what anybody says.

[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.800]
If that is one of the best movies ever made, then there's no...

[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.500]
Just throw away your VCR and your DVD and your DVDs.

[00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:13.760]
It's okay.

[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:14.900]
That is just...

[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.420]
And when you watch it the second time,

[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.740]
it feels like the whole movie goes by in a matter of seconds.

[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:20.660]
About 30 minutes.

[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:24.100]
It just flies by because you become just as wired as all the characters in a movie.

[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.800]
It's really a visual treat.

[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:26.760]
The way it's owned.

[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:29.760]
Yeah.

[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.880]
Oh man, that arm is looking nasty, Harry.

[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.200]
Don't put that in that.

[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.180]
Oh, geez.

[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:37.380]
Don't stick it way in.

[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:37.960]
Oh.

[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.000]
927.

[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.400]
I'm dying out of here.

[00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:59.380]
The White House issue.

[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.860]
A statement today.

[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:04.520]
Those phone you'll trip, you can't let the White House issue.

[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.980]
That's not good enough.

[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.340]
It's just not safe.

[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.380]
They're not a part of our coalition anyway.

[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:14.940]
The Navy is a God-the-South.

[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:18.700]
They'll bring you home.

[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.460]
The Navy is a God-the-South.

[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.660]
The Navy is a new.

[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.920]
The Navy is a lot like us.

[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.440]
Oh, they didn't listen and get on that bus.

[00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.340]
Well, planet Earth is all right in line.

[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:42.140]
And it could have happened at a better time.

[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:44.680]

[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.520]

And they'll just can't control themselves.

[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:12.280]
Line 90 puts on them again.

[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.180]
And they'll know what's going to be.

[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.080]
Here's Miami, hello.

[00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:17.860]
David Herman is most underrated actor in movies.

[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.620]
That's him again.

[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:19.600]
That's him again.

[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.820]
Why does he put him on the era?

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.000]
I mean, it should be like he's holding up a sign.

[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.760]
I only call a line nine nobody in Miami or in the local area calls online on you understand that peanut boy

[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.340]
Got it who just got a promotion I should point out just got a new title

[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:37.800]
He's full-time. He's got his benefits. He's got all kinds of crap

[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:42.400]
Even I had the chance to board out the motion he's moving up so much in the world this morning for about five minutes

[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.100]
For about ten minutes well exact was in there taking a gigantic smelly crap

[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:53.040]
But you'd be amazed at how fast you can slide back down that ladder again. You keep messing with that line nine

[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:55.240]
Well, I'm not far to fall. That's true

[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.080]
Fast pulling cable news to the right. I got to get into this got into a whole bunch of stuff here

[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:04.320]
And I don't see like any humongous response on it so far this morning

[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.760]
Here's a call from Boca hello

[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.200]
Yeah, I got to act this call mold and then Martin ball some

[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:14.560]
Yeah, they're both great

[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:20.940]
And I think they were underrated when they were acting there made a couple hundred movies between them right

[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:27.740]
And I have a movie for last week, but I don't know if it's ever mentioned you ever see the movie stolen green

[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:33.300]
Yeah, sure it was on there. Oh it was yeah got a few votes. Yeah, but I missed last week

[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:38.060]
I think it got 30 man about 30 votes. Okay. Thanks sir two good choices

[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.600]
See there's a guy who actually understands the poll

[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:44.140]
Oh, probably all whipped up because Boca's getting crispy cream now. So is we're enthused?

[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.560]
That was a good start who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.900]
Lee J. Cobb Joseph Conquist most of our audience hit on a Lee J. Cobb from Kornama

[00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.120]
Yeah, Joseph Conte they don't know from cotton batten

[00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:02.780]
Carmel the name I know from streets of San Francisco the big note right all fall down more in Betty

[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.260]
And who else was that movie even Marie St

[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.460]
And Shane yeah

[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:18.740]
And Martin Boston Martin Boston was a great actor. Do you know he was in psycho? Remember that right?

[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:24.180]
And we took that untimely fall backward down the stairs. That's why you're really gonna enjoy Ed what I

[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.120]
Can't find it. I got to order it. Yeah, Ed Wooden happiness 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18. Oh you got to find happiness already found happiness

[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:39.480]
5's pulling cable news to the right never subvanden pretense of balance and attempt to turn patriotic fervor into high ratings

[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:46.700]
Perhaps the most obvious sign that the war on terrorism has changed the whole game for cable news networks was the recent decision by

[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.240]
MSNBC to award a weekly talk shoot a man named Michael Savage

[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:58.360]
Savage whose politics are as far to the right as any commentator this side of G Gordon Litty runs the unfortunately named program Savage Nation

[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:03.180]
Positioned at the center of a set that will embarrass the host of a public access cable TV show

[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:12.200]
Savage gestures and grunts and mocks his opponents Democrats hated liberals anyone who's ambivalent about the Bush Administration's diplomatic military policies in school yard manner

[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:20.800]
In the spirit of a true talk radio idea log that is after all how he got his start Savage will link any pair of seemingly unrelated issues in the name of making a point

[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:26.080]
Savage's heightened profile might represent nothing more than the last minute and worst desperate attempt to shake things up

[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:31.180]
MSNBC is also at former ESPN host Keith Olberin's new show to the mix more on that in a minute

[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:38.180]
But there appears to be more at play here goaded by Fox News Channel the Bush Administration and the nation's patriotic fervor

[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.640]
The tone of cable news has taken a sharp turn to the right absolutely

[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:48.900]
Fox is pulling everybody into expressing an ideological views as Michael Wolf Media critic for New York magazine

[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.900]
But even more important they're pulling everybody into expressing a conservative view

[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:56.800]
It's not so much a change in the structure of journalism. It is a change in the balance

[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.120]
Meanwhile the stateside profile of four new services like the BBC has driven a risen rapidly

[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.800]
It's tough to quantify this early in the game. We're largely dealing with lessons learned from the war in Iraq

[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.120]
But some viewers may have had it with likes of Savage MSNBC colleague and fellow conservative Joe Scarborough

[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:19.240]
And you want a piece of this chest umpurs on Fox many of these yours appeared to be the target audience for American broadcast of the

[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:23.200]
Bebe which is now in regular rotation on many local cable characters the BBC

[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:29.700]
Which we had the story of a weekend about how many millions of Americans are watching the BBC during the war to try to get a little balanced coverage and up the

[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.400]
A pom pom flashin

[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.100]
After all I'm but I'm like a battery to me

[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.780]
How can any first of all why would anybody be that stupid right? I don't want to start discussion

[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:44.520]
And this because nobody in this audience cares about it anyway, but I'll say it why would it time if I first start doing it again

[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.720]
I get it roughly immediately played a buzzer or something. Yeah

[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.700]
And don't let me allow myself to be used the manipulative other people for there

[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:56.220]
And I'm not saying that the guy had a bad idea because if a commission passes a resolution like that or something happens

[00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:02.040]
And nobody knows about it. It renders it meaningless if the media doesn't report it it read it makes it meaningless

[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.340]
But not one person in South Florida cared enough about that. That's your tremendous cloud. We have on a show

[00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.340]
You know what I'm saying? Oh, do we have the cloud?

[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.520]
Here's hi Alia. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil how you doing great?

[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.340]
Paul Muni

[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.020]
Paul Muni was pretty big time you wouldn't say

[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.700]
I mean I don't know I just see him turn a class and move his yuletime. We'll be up that way with Austin

[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:31.220]
Yeah, but he was a great actor, but he was like in in his day. He was like a major major store

[00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:32.940]
Was he and speaking of actors?

[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.940]
I missed it all last night, but I heard something about Jack Nicholson went crazy yesterday

[00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.520]
I was over the weekend and one of the Laker games he ran out of a court screaming at the official. He's he's out of control

[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:49.240]
All right, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, he ran out of the court screaming here is Johnny. Hey, are we putting

[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:57.520]
His suggestion on there? No, Paul Muni right. He was kind of puny. No Paul Muni was like a big time in his day, you know, I say

[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:04.740]
You know, this is interesting because so far we got mostly way back and I had I found digging around here

[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.980]
I found an article that I'd say from like last year

[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:13.280]
When they were listing the the critics top 10 and directors top 10 movies of all time and top 10 directors

[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.640]
It says it's citizen can't all over again, which is unfortunate

[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:22.320]
But the point it says great films critics and directors agree great film stopping made after around 1980

[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.380]
And you know what else great music for the most parts stop being made after 1980 what happened in 1980

[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.820]
Oh, you see that?

[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.680]
Right toward the end of American

[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:33.820]
Psycho

[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.180]
You'll see them sitting around in the bar and watching Reagan on TV with his speech about Iran

[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:45.900]
Contra and all the crap and the one guy sitting there saying how can he lie like that? How can he sit there and it brought it right to home

[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.900]
I thought boy, this is pretty timely only the the faces been changed and predicted guilty

[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.580]
It has nothing to do with anything necessarily, but just mark that down. Okay. This is the date that I brought him out of the crazy closet

[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.880]
In fact, he could be the next American psycho. He didn't look quite that good

[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.640]
A documentary which claims Ben Laden was greatly enriched by the Bush family while we already

millions of Moores planned Fahrenheit 9-11.

[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:49.900]
The primary thrust of the new film is what has happened in the country since 9-11 and how the

[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.260]
Bush administration used this tragic event to push its agenda more explains.

[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.620]
up until two two months after 9-11.

[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.020]

[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:15.720]
Over here.

[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:21.980]
Yes. Gene Hackman is excellent. Get out of here. Gene Hackman is like one of the top actors of our lifetime.

[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:25.060]
You just don't get it sir. You know I get out here. Go away.

[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:33.460]
Not that we didn't know this would happen. No that's good. Thank you very much for you know living up to what we feared was going to happen with us.

[00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:39.220]
We're not talking about who are the top actors and actresses of all time. That goes without saying okay.

[00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:46.440]
Is there anybody who wouldn't put Gene Hackman on list? No. The most underrated actor or actress of all time.

[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:51.220]
Somebody who doesn't get the top billing. Somebody who isn't on the list of the top this, the top that.

[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:56.320]
Doesn't have a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. That's what we're trying to find. Gene Hackman.

[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:02.300]
What does that mean? Oh God it's just I have so much trouble communicating you know what.

[00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:07.780]
Thank God I work at QAM which is not in the communications business. Find a way clearance when you get in our guy the emphones fixed okay.

[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.660]
Maybe you want to poke George Corso in the side or in the back.

[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:14.580]
Do you ever like getting poked? No it's getting to be ridiculous now.

[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:19.600]
We got muffins on our vacation this week. Everybody net towns on a busman's holiday until Labor Day.

[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.440]
And it's a joke. It's a freaking goddamn joke. Nothing gets done.

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:28.660]
And you have to bitch and scream and how are then I got sales people.

[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.500]
Thanks for me stuff at 20 after 11 at night. I just finished watching American Psycho.

[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.680]
I put my head down on the pedal. I'm almost asleep and I hear this sound and I think what the hell's going on in here.

[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:43.960]
And I come running in here and I see faxes. Three pages coming across my fax machine at 20 after 11 at night.

[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:50.180]
Eisenberg you're a crazy person. That's all I can tell you. Perfect for QAM salesman. A certifiable crazy person.

[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.320]
Talk about the old rubber room. God.

[00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:59.140]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T.

[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.360]
And Verizon wireless line. Here's a call from Boko.

[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.720]
Which seems to be pretty busy since they heard about the doughnut. Hello.

[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:09.300]
Oh yeah. Hey. How are you? I heard you talking about the savage before.

[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.540]
Real name Michael Weiner. Bronx New York.

[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:15.340]
Well he lives up to his name. I'll tell you that.

[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:18.160]
Pretty interesting. He just got a stick. That's all.

[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.300]
I got a stick and nobody there's like I'll nominate Sterling Hayden.

[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.640]
Sterling Hayden was great. He was the cop and the Godfather course.

[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:30.920]
And he was the general in in Dr. Strange love. Right. The wacko general.

[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:34.320]
Now see that's a good choice. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Is that kind of a choice?

[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:38.720]
Another cube or movie called The One Where They Get The Horse Track.

[00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:43.120]
Where they the killing. You know that movie? The killing.

[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.640]
Yeah, I didn't see never saw that. At least in the cube or get it's a classic.

[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:49.440]
Anyways, I just wanted to rat on what's his name?

[00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:52.900]
Savage. I mean it's a big scam. It is book.

[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.380]
It says Michael D Weiner Jr. Copyright.

[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.420]
So he just picked up on something that's all.

[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.280]
There you go. Just don't cut the bad way. It's it's in. Okay. Thanks.

[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.660]
Looking for some spy reports on Tom Jicke.

[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.820]
Anybody hear any fallout from that one? He filled in for any KD other night?

[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.200]
No. Oh.

[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.160]
No, he talked about radio the whole time. He what? I'm kidding.

[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.740]
Oh, seriously, I'd like to find out because I sure as hell didn't listen to it.

[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.500]
I'd like to find out what will happen there. And I'll guarantee you that none of our people had devolved the call

[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.300]
and then put his feet to the fire. Guarantea.

[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.720]
So so sad. You know, everybody talks a good game because it's real easy to make a phone call and say,

[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.100]
oh yeah, well, I'm indignant about this. And on that's the end of it. That's as far as it goes.

[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.280]
Especially in a place like South Florida where it's 100 degrees in the shade.

[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.360]
Everybody's brains are fried if they had any in the first place and nobody really gives a crap.

[00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.000]
Maybe we'll get a time to cuspire report before one o'clock, you think? No.

[00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:53.140]
Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Hey, no, how you doing? Great.

[00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:55.060]
How about Johnny Knoxville?

[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.860]
Johnny Knoxville from Jackass.

[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.920]
Yes. He's a Jackass from Jackass.

[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:06.160]
Yeah. So that makes him an underrated movie actor?

[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.660]
Yes, definitely.

[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.360]
Okay. Thanks. Thanks. What do you say? No.

[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.400]
Is he a movie actor? No.

[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.840]
He's a stunt performer. Is Jackass a movie? No.

[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.140]
No.

[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.020]
But, you know, we've invited Jackass to call him. We just got one. We worked as appointed 5607-0560,

[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:32.180]
on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.740]
See, I always like when it takes like the first three hours because it kills him with that.

[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.060]
Take the first three hours to explain them what the question is.

[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.640]
And then the fourth hour, they start saying, oh, well, I guess that's already on there, right? Yeah, that's right.

[00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.220]
The most underrated movie actor, actress of all day.

[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:52.220]
And also, not only are we getting any jikas by reports, did one person call it yet?

[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.360]
Since we've been talking about this stuff for at least a week now, maybe more than that.

[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.080]
I mean, real intensively. One person called and said they saw the movie Happiness? No.

[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.540]
That saw a record for a dream since we were talking about it. No.

[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.420]
Uh, bully, I hope they didn't see it. I hope they wouldn't waste their time. That really is a stinker, man.

[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:14.420]
And I can't believe that you weren't nearly as enthusiastic as you should have been about the game.

[00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.660]
That, to me, was one of the all-time best. He's on the phone. Who's on the phone? The game. He's the one that saw it.

[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.100]
He saw what? The game. Oh, you didn't see the game? No.

[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:35.120]
I'm going to be thinking this week. So when it is. Holy Toledo. I can't believe that I've seen two movies in the last 48 hours that George hasn't seen.

[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.100]
And you know why I didn't see it? Why is that? Michael Douglas.

[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:43.280]
Oh, but yeah, I'll try to. Michael Douglas is good in any movie where he's not playing a sex pod.

[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:49.040]
Where he's playing a sex pod. It's ridiculous. You know, even like Basic Instinct, even though he was supposed to be a sex pod.

[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.980]
Well, yeah, but that was an exception. Fable attraction, Basic Instinct. Those movies are aberrations.

[00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:59.240]
But he was very good in this in the game. Oh, you've got to see the game. Well, you've got to find that.

[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:04.020]
In fact, it's G right before age. You'll find the game and then having this right behind you. Right?

[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:08.880]
At a store not near by you. Here's a lady in store. Hello?

[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.360]
Hi, Neil. Yes, ma'am.

[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:18.720]
Hey, I think I have one Steve Fischemmie. He's a younger guy who's in Fargo and big old Afty.

[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.240]
Not a big history there, but he's a great actor. That's V-U-S-C-E-M-I?

[00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.780]
I think so. Yeah, that's it. Oh, he's a little guy. Kind of funny looking.

[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:34.320]
That's what they were talking about in Fargo. Okay, I got it down. You got it down? I got it down.

[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:40.820]
Great. We're on a big tour. We're taking the kids to Disney. You think you could play a Disney cart for us?

[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.960]
No problem. Thank you. Have a great day. Have a great time. See, they're on a way to Orlando.

[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:52.360]
Everybody's bailing out. And why not? You know, it's it's only May. I used to think that it was like starting like after the end of June when a kid out of school.

[00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:53.840]
When did the kids get out of school? Little ones.

[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.080]
Junish? Like I just said.

[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:05.040]
But they're already on the way out. As many people are bailing out as possible. I can get out and I understand it's about 400 degrees in the shade every day.

[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.820]
A little bit too much on the toasty side. Swell to ring.

[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:14.000]
So what seemed to me that since you got like free picket now, there's nobody in town.

[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.100]
You ought to be able to go to any other music and video store besides blockbuster.

[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.980]
Since you don't want sensitive versions and pick up fine. Whatever. Now you're looking for no sweat.

[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.660]
Soon you're right. You would think no sweat.

[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:27.920]
You know, that's now we were talking before about peaches going under.

[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:34.100]
I mean, name for me a great music store video store chain other than blockbuster.

[00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:35.840]
Name me one in South Florida.

[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.940]
Well, we have Hollywood video. I don't know if they're great, but they exist. It's another one.

[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:43.220]
Is that a big chain? It's a chain.

[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.500]
Yeah, there's more than one. They don't have happiness either. I might mention.

[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:56.140]
That's a bullet in just in case anybody out there missed it. No happiness in South Florida.

[00:46:56.140 --> 00:47:00.080]
My life and look all this is for 305.

[00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:00.440]
Six.

[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.640]
You weigh.

[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:05.160]
Eisner.

[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:09.400]
Cindy, I told you not to bother me.

[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:09.940]
Eisner.

[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.200]
Mr. Mouse.

[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.040]
Oh, you snap on that, Eisner.

[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.680]
Oh, nothing sir. How are you?

[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.060]
I'm not good.

[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.080]
Oh, no. What's wrong now, sir?

[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.700]
Oh, one of my balls turned black.

[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:23.960]
Sure, your balls.

[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.420]
My basketball, I'm like a rod. It froze. It turned black.

[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.200]
Oh, that's terrible.

[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.920]
I'm a big basketballer.

[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:31.520]
Horrible.

[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.020]
Make the call, Eisner.

[00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.320]
What call, sir?

[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:34.980]
Get up, her partner.

[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.300]
I ran the paper. She's getting a divorce.

[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:38.940]
Well, she's separated.

[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.720]
There's some chemistry there, Eisner.

[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:44.320]
She wants me. I think she was just afraid to make the move on the big guy.

[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.800]
But sir, with all due respect, you're a mouse.

[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:51.500]
Hey, don't tell me I know I'm a mouse.

[00:47:52.060 --> 00:47:54.580]
I'm a mouse. She wants me. I can tell.

[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.440]
You're my pin, Eisner.

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:58.400]
Okay, okay, sir. I'll make the move.

[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.700]
Hang on a minute.

[00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.180]
Remus!

[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:04.920]
I am so sick of that song, Remus.

[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.840]
Do not sing that song anymore.

[00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.180]
Zippity, do not Zippity, hey.

[00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.560]
Happy song, Bob.

[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.340]
It doesn't make me happy, Remus.

[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.800]
It makes me want to strangle you.

[00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:16.340]
Eisner.

[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:17.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:19.620]
I do want to tell you one good thing you're doing.

[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:20.520]
Okay.

[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.160]
I dropped to you for American Idol.

[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.700]
You finally put this on the map of that thing.

[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.120]
Wait a go, Eisner.

[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.420]
Well, sir, that's actually the Fox Network.

[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.340]
Don't correct me, Eisner.

[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.160]
Remus!

[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.340]
What are you doing, Remus?

[00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.320]
Get a divorce and play with Zippity.

[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.500]
Don't play with Zippity.

[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.280]
I'm on the phone, Remus.

[00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:44.720]
It's not easy to play with Zippity.

[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.440]
It's easy to play with Zippity.

[00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:47.120]
It's terrible.

[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:48.400]
That's right.

[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:49.640]
They need me, Bob.

[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.860]
Don't play with Zippity again, Remus.

[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:53.260]
Eisner.

[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.140]
Yes, sir.

[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:55.320]
What are we running?

[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.060]
Well, sir, we've got the bachelor.

[00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.440]
Oh, that's right.

[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:02.100]
That stupid fire steam kid with that pool-peatin' grin.

[00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:03.100]
No, no, sir.

[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:04.640]
It's a fire stone.

[00:49:04.860 --> 00:49:05.340]
Eisner.

[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:06.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.160]
Don't you correct me.

[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.460]
What's his name?

[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:11.560]
What's his name?

[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.400]
Firesteam.

[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:14.400]
No, you idiot.

[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:15.400]
It's fire stones.

[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:17.280]
You don't even know the name of a bachelor.

[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.100]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:22.500]
Heavens, Slates, what's this information I have to read about Peter Jennings?

[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.880]
What about Peter?

[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:24.840]
So you're still going to find John?

[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.280]
Yes!

[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.620]
That was a good one, Bob.

[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.640]
Remus, I swear to God.

[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:38.340]
I will take your head between my white glove hands and through the ship.

[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:39.600]
Ah, Bob, sorry.

[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.320]
I'm under a little stress, Bob.

[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.180]
What's the matter?

[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.620]
It's a naked-dirt-past, see that?

[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.280]
The naked-dirt-past.

[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:47.880]
You don't smoke, Remus.

[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:51.600]
Get out of here, you moron.

[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.280]
Eisner.

[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:56.040]
Well, Mr. Jennings is doing a fine job.

[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:58.340]
Peter Jennings is terrible.

[00:49:59.020 --> 00:49:59.660]
He's French.

[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:01.800]
Well, I actually saw his Canadian.

[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:03.860]
Eisner.

[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:04.360]
Yes.

[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:05.540]
What do I tell you about correct me?

[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:07.680]
What is Peter Jennings?

[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:08.240]
Said.

[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:09.640]
He's French.

[00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:11.660]
No, you moron.

[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:12.540]
He's Canadian.

[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.100]
He's the anchor of our network.

[00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.180]
You don't even know what he does.

[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:17.520]
Why do I keep you around, Eisner?

[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.480]
I don't know.

[00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:19.600]
Why, Eisner?

[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:20.200]
I don't know.

[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.460]
You are.

[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:22.840]
Say it.

[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:24.040]
Killing me?

[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:24.780]
Killing me?

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.160]

[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:25.900]
And you know what?

[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.860]
Try to get me on that bachelor's show.

[00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:29.580]
Sir, you're married, Mouse.

[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:30.720]
Hey, Eisner.

[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:31.120]
Yes?

[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:32.340]
I don't want to marry him.

[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:34.780]
I don't want to date those 25 girls.

[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.640]
I just want to rob him!

[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.640]
Okay, Remus!

[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.640]
Hello, 3 and 5, 60.

[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.180]
W and Q. I'm happy Monday to you.

[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.000]
Ottawa backs off on pot laws.

[00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:47.320]
Did you read this before you faxed it to me?

[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.520]
Ah, skimmed it.

[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.380]
This isn't enough to make you just want to throw your arms up in the air.

[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:52.040]
And just give up.

[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:52.620]
We surrender!

[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:54.940]
Because I believe this country has.

[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.000]
Do you want the second page?

[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:56.680]
No.

[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:02.640]
The federal government in Canada has backed off plans to make pop possession of mere ticketing

[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.000]
offence.

[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.320]
The Toronto star has learned.

[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:08.240]
Instead, sources say the Liberal government will keep simple possession of mere one on the books.

[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.680]
As a criminal offence under the controlled drugs and substances act.

[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:17.480]
The new plan came days after U.S. officials warned that any easing of Canada's mere one-on-laws

[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:20.180]
could lead to a crackdown at border crossings.

[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:25.580]
The government will provide alternative civil penalties, fines, not jail, upon conviction

[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:29.360]
that will leave law enforcement and the collection of fines to the provinces under the news scheme

[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:33.140]
a person convicted of possessing a small amount of pot would now register a criminal record

[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.020]
according to insiders.

[00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:41.180]
Last week U.S. drugs are a John Walters-uggested border traffic with slow to a crawl because

[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:45.520]
U.S. would increase inspections to stop smugglers from illegally shipping that poison

[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.000]
south.

[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.600]
Oh my God!

[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.080]
So it's not bad enough that within the 50 states of the U.S. that all this repressive

[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:57.120]
and regressive and stone-aged, craft-stone-aged stuff is coming in, but also threatening and

[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.620]
saber-raddling at everybody else.

[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:02.460]
Well, it's just pathetic!

[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:07.520]
And the American public sits back, like that, watching their goddamn American idol and

[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.580]
their survivable crap, and that's all they know from.

[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.400]
Forget about freedoms, forget about that what conservatives were supposed to be all about,

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:21.580]
which is leaving people to hell alone, minimal interference in people's private lives, forget

[00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:22.120]
about that.

[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:26.800]
This is a kinder gentler fascism as what it is, a compassionate fascism.

[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:32.760]
Who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time is our poll question today

[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:33.840]
on eOrongers.com.

[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:37.180]
And of course we do a poll question like this just about every day now because we realize

[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:38.680]
this is the only way to get anybody to crawl.

[00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:40.820]
Am I correct about that?

[00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:41.100]
I'm here.

[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:45.140]
We learned it only took me 27 years to learn it.

[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.800]
Lee J. Cobb, Joseph Cotton, Carl Maldon, Martin Balsam, Ed O'Neill, Terence Stambe.

[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.540]
You know something now that I think about it, maybe Joseph Cotton doesn't belong on

[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:54.720]
here.

[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.640]
No, he does.

[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:00.440]
Because he was very big in his day, but he just, I don't know, it just seems to me he never

[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:08.040]
had the kind of notoriety that Bogart and tag me in all those of that era.

[00:53:08.580 --> 00:53:09.500]
He belongs on it.

[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:09.820]
He was great.

[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:13.180]
Ed O'Neill, Terence Stambe, Gary Oldman, Sterling Hayden, Steve Bouchemi.

[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:14.520]
How come we don't have no actresses yet?

[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.000]
Good question.

[00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:16.540]
Yeah.

[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:18.420]
How come we have no ladies?

[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:23.000]
Here's the fact that says I realize the war is over in Iraq and the American public has

[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.840]
moved on to the next sensationalized divot.

[00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:28.700]
But last week ABC had a segment on the news that showed just how stage managed the whole

[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:29.360]
war was.

[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:32.520]
They were interviewing the doctor, the treated Jessica Lynch and his version of the rescue

[00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.940]
went down and the military's version don't quite match up.

[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:37.260]
Yeah, we had that on our website a couple of times.

[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:44.060]
This was all a photo op and the doctors in the hospital brought her out to the troop.

[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:45.420]
They said, here's Jessica.

[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:48.320]
She's alive and I start like, get your ass back in here.

[00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:48.620]
Okay.

[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:53.000]
And then conveniently, and then conveniently, she's got annesia.

[00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:54.480]
She don't remember anything about her rescue.

[00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:55.680]
Isn't that interesting?

[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:55.940]
Huh?

[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.400]
You don't think somebody made her an offer she couldn't refuse to you?

[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:04.640]
It says in his facts, by the way, Joe Scarborough was the former congressman who had the woman

[00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.540]
staffer mysteriously dying as orifice.

[00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:09.360]
It was all hushed up and soon after they retired from the house.

[00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:13.020]
Didn't hear anything about that in the New York Post or Fox Washington Times.

[00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:18.420]
Also, check out citizen Ruth with Laura Deme.

[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:18.900]
What's seen?

[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.560]
That is Laura Dern.

[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:22.160]
It says Laura Dern.

[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.720]
Oh, damn, Dern, it's a bad fact.

[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:25.200]
Ruth says there's like a damn on here.

[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.860]
Chronic Fax, your Alan says James Spader.

[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:32.540]
Check, or you don't like him?

[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:32.800]
No.

[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:34.420]
We don't hear him.

[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.060]
I'm not.

[00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:36.760]
I'm just having an emotional reaction.

[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.520]
A check out bed influence, a great 1990 thriller with gay undertones during Spader and Rob

[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:41.780]
Blow.

[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.140]
Yeah, the game spader with a shocker.

[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.440]
You saw it?

[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:46.900]
No.

[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:48.600]
Oh, that's a gay undertone.

[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.000]
But that's because Rob Blow was in it and James Spader.

[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:52.220]
Why, he's gay?

[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:53.300]
He's a...

[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.420]
James Spader's not gay.

[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:55.540]
What is wrong with you?

[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.420]
You see his homophobia coming through a beaner boy?

[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:00.440]
I didn't say anybody don't like their gay or their Jewish or even worse.

[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:00.840]
They're both.

[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.560]
Oh, I can't imagine that.

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:04.700]
Is this such a thing?

[00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:05.480]
No.

[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:07.060]
I just made it up.

[00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:08.600]
You pick which one.

[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:13.880]
Here's one that says subject, hard to call a work, but here are two nominees for underrated

[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.380]
actors.

[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.080]
Rob, to the long career because of cancer, this is an excellent choice.

[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:18.780]
Frato.

[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:19.900]
Indeed.

[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:20.760]
Right?

[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:21.780]
John Cazale.

[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:22.980]
Cazale, how do you say his name?

[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.140]
You say Cazale.

[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.020]
I'll say Cazale.

[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.120]
Yeah.

[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.360]
I can handle things.

[00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:29.140]
I'm smart.

[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:30.740]
I can be funny.

[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:31.180]
Said.

[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:32.220]
Like, no.

[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:33.140]
I'm smart.

[00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:34.360]
And I want to spit.

[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.320]
I think his best role was in the cook.

[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:40.620]
I mean, I'm a dog day afternoon, no question.

[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:41.660]
When you agree?

[00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:42.000]
Yes.

[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.880]
But he was also good as Frato.

[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.200]
It's just that he didn't have that big of a part, you know, as Frato.

[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:53.080]
You don't come to Vegas and talk to a man like Mo Green like that.

[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:55.400]
That was good.

[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:58.640]
And a wonderful actress who was always good, Patricia Neal.

[00:55:58.760 --> 00:55:59.400]
She was great.

[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:00.860]
Well, it's about time we got a lady.

[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:02.620]
I thought we were put Laura Dirt on there.

[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:04.560]
Said who?

[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:08.680]
I didn't say that, but now that you say it, I have no problem with that.

[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:09.760]
How about Bruce Dern?

[00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:11.300]
Lost a joke.

[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.460]
Bruce Dern was very good, but they're not that great.

[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.940]
Patricia Neal, she was great and she was never like a real big, you know.

[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.320]
See, I think now they're starting to catch on a little bit.

[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.120]
Just a little bit.

[00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.480]
They're starting to get a little lukewarm.

[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]
By noon, we'll have it licked.

[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.640]
We'll put the list up there at 11.

[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.720]
Okay, being a boy, we don't get the Eric under a lot of pressure this early in a week,

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:31.200]
especially because he occasionally crumbles under the pressure.

[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:37.180]
So 11 o'clock we'll put the list up there for people to start voting on.

[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.920]
I already voted for Joseph Cotton.

[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:42.700]
Okay, probably be the only vote he'll get because we don't have too many old farts out

[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.220]
there like me.

[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.440]
I think the old farts have all gone back to the snowbirds.

[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.300]
That's what my told me over the weekend.

[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.080]
She said all her neighbors, they've all gone.

[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.400]
They're all gone back up north for the summit time.

[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.600]
They all bailed out, baby.

[00:56:56.540 --> 00:56:58.100]
I mean, is it ever going to change?

[00:56:58.280 --> 00:56:59.700]
Talk about it.

[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.300]
So here's an area four to four and a half million people.

[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.680]
They'dbroward Palm Beach, throw in Monroe County, if you like.

[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.860]
We're not, whatever you like.

[00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:09.240]
Four and a half million people.

[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:11.340]
And it's still a horse and buggy town.

[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:12.640]
It's still a seasonal town.

[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:19.460]
I challenge you to name me any other metropolitan area, the so-called world class bullcrap.

[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.600]
Any other metropolitan area that's still a seasonal town that has a season.

[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:24.580]
Can't do it, Sally.

[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:29.020]
Even Vegas, which used to have certain times of the year, when it was busy and other

[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.060]
times when it was like, yeah, you could go and be pretty slow.

[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.460]
I mean, yeah, they do have times like the holidays Thanksgiving and whatever.

[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:36.920]
When it's just so jam-packed, you can't even get in a car.

[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.760]
But there's no such thing as a season in Vegas anymore.

[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:44.160]
And that's hardly a major metropolitan area.

[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.400]
Like 90% of the people there at any time are tourists.

[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.440]
Still, a seasonal horse and buggy town.

[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.400]
And it's not like there aren't other hot weather places.

[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.760]
Houston?

[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:01.620]
Yeah, but Phoenix, what are those tourist places?

[00:58:02.900 --> 00:58:03.920]
What does that mean?

[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.140]
It's an excuse or anything like that.

[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.380]
But this is the big industry down here is tourism.

[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.920]
Well, let me ask you, what city do you think, and forgetting about 9-11, just have to decide,

[00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:16.060]
but ordinarily, what city do you think does more in tourism over your New York or Miami

[00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:17.000]
or New York?

[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:17.720]
Right.

[00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:18.540]
But it's not just.

[00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:22.860]
Well, that's why, but it's set aside a tourist thing, okay?

[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.900]
The fact is, it's a horse and buggy place when a minute that it gets 100 degrees in the

[00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:29.940]
shade, which now keeps getting earlier and earlier, everybody bales out.

[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:34.380]
Everybody goes back to where their climate is a little bit more tolerable because it

[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.260]
is a fact that it's so oppressive there and there's not a goddamn thing to do other than

[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:37.720]
to play golf.

[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:38.800]
Ooh.

[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:39.920]
Yeah.

[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.620]
Or watch it.

[00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:42.680]
Or watch people play golf.

[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.160]
Robert Ryan, there's a good one for our list.

[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:47.480]
Robert Ryan was great.

[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:48.920]
Remember Robert Ryan?

[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:49.240]
Mm-hmm.

[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:50.800]
Goes back a long ways.

[00:58:50.800 --> 00:58:52.420]
It was in a lot of war movies, I think.

[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:53.980]
Wasn't it?

[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:55.800]
I haven't seen any war movies.

[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:56.720]
It had the longest day.

[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:57.240]
That's right.

[00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:00.040]
He was in the Canadians, eh?

[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:02.220]
Ice Palace odds against tomorrow.

[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.840]
The dirty dozen, the professionals.

[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.120]
Look it up in the book.

[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.540]
The busy body.

[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.760]
Los Spiarco de Anzio.

[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:10.900]
I beg your pardon.

[00:59:12.040 --> 00:59:16.360]
A custer of the west, the wild bunch, Captain Nemo in the underwater city, the underwear

[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:17.420]
world of Jacques Cousteau.

[00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.740]
Law man, the love machine.

[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:23.560]
The man without a country, the outfit, the ice man, cometh,

[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.400]
squirt, squirt, and the lolly Madonna war.

[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:28.800]
Whatever the hell that was.

[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.600]
Oh, there's two more pages of this same thing?

[00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:31.160]
Yeah.

[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:31.960]
Well, don't send them.

[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:33.040]
OK, don't send them.

[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:33.820]
We already got them down.

[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.760]
OK, it's, he was a kernel breed in the dirty dozen Lee Marvin's Nemo's.

[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.680]
Robert Ryan, he's a great, great actor.

[00:59:39.780 --> 00:59:41.780]
And that's exactly what we're looking for.

[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:42.100]
You know what?

[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:43.780]
I think we got our thumb on it today.

[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:46.360]
I think we got our pedal to the metal, man.

[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:48.280]
And I think we're on our way to a spectacular week.

[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.160]
I'm probably going to be wrong, but it sounds good on it.

[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:50.760]
Sure.

[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:52.080]
It sounds like I really believe that.

[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:52.240]

[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:54.620]
I don't.

[00:59:54.620 --> 00:59:57.060]

Lean with Tom Whiteover.

[01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:42.340]
Oh my God.

[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.020]
18 at 560 WDQ, I'm sure that some of our acquaintances, I mean, some of the people in the audience

[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:51.960]
have thought that movie-American psycho they'd have their pom white open.

[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.560]
I'm Tony Christian Bales, there's other than the one or two suits that he wears during

[01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.360]
a movie in a few scenes, he's like naked during a whole movie, including early part in

[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.740]
a movie, and also our good friend what's his name, Jared Lido.

[01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:09.060]
Yeah, he looks pretty good in the movie, although we don't see him too long.

[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:10.740]
He kind of disappears.

[01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:16.040]
Here's a list underrated actors, two out of three are bad, James Garner, definitely.

[01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.740]
James Whitmore, I don't think so, although his garden is growing bigger and bigger by the

[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:21.120]
minute.

[01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:22.880]
Isn't that who James Whitmore is?

[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.480]
He's on the, I don't know.

[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:25.560]
Miracle gross spots?

[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.900]
Come on, what do you mean you don't know?

[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:27.720]
You know the spots?

[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.000]
Look, it all fossled to me.

[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:32.560]
He is an old fossil, he's a crag, he was a good actor, but I'm not putting him on

[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.060]
there, and James Cobraan, two James's is enough for one fact, James Cobraan was good.

[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:36.900]
You remember him?

[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.160]
Sure, but he was at the start of like a whole bunch of things and highly touted and pop.

[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.000]
James Cobraan?

[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.200]
Right, wasn't he in all the flip movies?

[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:46.220]
Okay, cross him out.

[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:48.740]
Sorry.

[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.440]
Well, we can't put all the James's on, Eric.

[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.260]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.300]
Many Americans follow the war on BBC.

[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:56.900]
Oh!

[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.240]
First rated by the failure of US based broadcast networks to provide a realistic accountability

[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.380]
political machinations that led to the war in Iraq and the war itself.

[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:09.680]
Millions of Americans turned into British news reports, which were picked up on pubic broadcasting

[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.280]
and community radio and TV stations.

[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.220]
How do you like that?

[01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.820]
That's how desperate some people were.

[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.820]
Of course, I had the CBC thank goodness.

[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:18.040]
Very lucky guy.

[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:22.900]
There are a raise internal security seeking out and punishing alleged informers.

[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.240]
It's not known, he was at British A.

[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.020]
There's a bit, you know, I'm thinking it could be a new format.

[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.400]
We could have like the BBC hour.

[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:33.840]
James, some reports suggest he was paid up like 80,000 pounds a year by the authorities.

[01:04:34.260 --> 01:04:38.260]
They're supposed to do these stuff and their own allegations go to like the personally involved.

[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:38.760]

[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.360]
What are commercial on CBC?

[01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.540]
That's a thought.

[01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:46.120]
So like 9 to 10 we can do the BBC hour.

[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.980]
10 to 11 we can do the CBC hour.

[01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:48.780]
Right?

[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:50.200]
Sounds great.

[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:56.320]
And we can tape that the audio from that kids adventures of the Gene Offree shows.

[01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.640]
From Ubiola.

[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.260]
Where am I ever having a run?

[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:02.800]
I'm your...

[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.380]
How does that sound?

[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.640]
We can do that from the...

[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.100]
And...

[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.640]
Cryblood psycho is on on my screen TV right now.

[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:10.260]
Close now.

[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:11.180]
Wow.

[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:13.020]
So I think we got a lick.

[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:19.280]
Anyway, already high American audience figures for BBC World News bulletin spike by 28% in the first weeks of the war.

[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:22.980]
And BBC officials delighted in emails like the one from a New York viewer who wrote,

[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.240]
the BBC seems to be the only decent source of news on this conflict.

[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.800]
American networks are appalling.

[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.680]
Absolutely correct sir.

[01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:30.400]
How do you like that?

[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:30.920]
Yeah.

[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.840]
What the US networks give you is just a rehash of Bush administration announcements and worse.

[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:36.920]
There's no news in it.

[01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:40.180]
Says Tony Ben, one of the best known political figures in Britain and a frequent commentator.

[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.980]
An international news program.

[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:43.480]
Does anyone take them seriously?

[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.820]
Only the right wingers, only the Fox did-oheds.

[01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:47.280]
Or do anyone want to take them seriously?

[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.320]
Because that's what...

[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.360]
You're feeding them what they want.

[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.200]
What they want to be fed.

[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.400]
Palm 5, 60 on a 18.

[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:55.920]
T-line.

[01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.080]
We got the Mad Dog on one today.

[01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.440]
Hank, it's your last day too.

[01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:58.980]
Today at 3.

[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.540]
Do you have a stuff a little low of stake in his place?

[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:02.040]
Seven o'clock.

[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.080]
You got Hurricane Hotline.

[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:03.680]
And eight o'clock.

[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:04.380]
The big...

[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:04.580]
Oh!

[01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:06.840]
Oh, look at this.

[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.160]
The Marlins are on the West Coast again.

[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.920]
But I got out of town after firing a manager.

[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.640]
Marlins on Dreck 930 from the West Coast and Marlins at the San Diego Padres.

[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.020]
You'll be a tremendous amount interest in that.

[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:17.860]
10.05.

[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.820]
And Joe and Mark overnight understand their kicking some real ass on that show.

[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:21.220]
They're on.

[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.060]
You talked to Joe lately?

[01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:24.880]
Nothing's the party.

[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:26.660]
Oh, he was at the ratings...

[01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.780]
He was at the ratings party?

[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:28.360]
Sure.

[01:06:28.800 --> 01:06:29.000]
And...

[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:31.660]
And Vlad and it need the whole guns in the Spokhar.

[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.580]
The cast from that show was at the ratings party?

[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:35.380]
Absolutely.

[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:35.880]
Why not?

[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:40.720]
What number were they out of 35 stations?

[01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.300]
What number were they out of 35 stations?

[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300]
What number were they out of 35 stations?

[01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.320]
But they weren't even due to good.

[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.340]
But, you know, he's the young guy.

[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:47.440]
He needs the free food, I guess.

[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:48.700]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:49.020]
Hello.

[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.040]
Hi.

[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:51.220]
Hi.

[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:51.300]

[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.620]
What was it?

[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:56.680]
Something crappy.

[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.060]
Oh, okay.

[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.120]
I crappy, as opposed to I poppy.

[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.100]
Here's a lady in Miami.

[01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:03.400]
Hello.

[01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:04.280]
Hi.

[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.360]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:06.080]
Good morning.

[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:11.360]
Would you like my suggestion first, or can I talk to you about happiness in American Psycho?

[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.780]
Oh, I'd rather talk about it.

[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.100]
It was a savior suggestion for the end.

[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:14.820]
Okay.

[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:17.760]
American Psycho was one of the...

[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:20.260]
You were talking last week about the book being better than the movie.

[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:20.800]
Right.

[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.060]
In this particular case, if you read the book, I'd like to know if you get through it without

[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:26.520]
wretching.

[01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.200]
It's really much more violent, much more bloody than the movie.

[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:36.980]
It's funny you said that because in my timeout film guide, the 600-page book there, I read

[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:38.820]
the review of the movie before I watched it.

[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:40.220]
And it said the same thing.

[01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:42.200]
It said that they left out the overwhelming...

[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.820]
They did it much more low-key as opposed to the grotesque violence in the book.

[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.020]
I don't think they could have filmed some of it.

[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:50.700]
Some of it I actually did get sick enough to throw up.

[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:51.220]
Really?

[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.280]
I still haven't made it all the way through the book.

[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.340]
I have to do it in stages.

[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.400]
The Christian bail I'll watch naked any time.

[01:07:57.200 --> 01:07:58.460]
Yeah, I'll go along with that.

[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.760]
Ask for happiness.

[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.680]
You were talking about the scene with the dog.

[01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:02.500]
Yeah.

[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:06.720]
If they're only one scene with the dog because I remember the scene on the porch.

[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.040]
Is that the one you're talking about?

[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:08.880]
At the end.

[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:09.440]
Yeah.

[01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:10.580]
Don't give it away though.

[01:08:10.780 --> 01:08:11.980]
I'm not going to give it away.

[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:14.660]
But I tell you, I looked weird at my dog always.

[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.580]
I'm not going to give it away.

[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:20.680]
I won't say anything else because anything I say is going to give it away.

[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:21.200]
Please don't.

[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:26.100]
Now, I have to tell you, there's only one scene in bully that I thought was really good.

[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:26.900]
It was funny.

[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.980]
It was when he was having sex with one girl and he turned on gay porn for inspiration.

[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:32.920]
Did you catch that one?

[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:33.500]
Oh, sure.

[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:36.640]
Well, that was an undercurrent to the whole movie.

[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:39.120]
The fact that the relationship he had with his friend, the one that you...

[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:39.200]
Yeah.

[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:40.860]
The one that you...

[01:08:40.860 --> 01:08:42.160]
I wonder if it's different in the book.

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.760]
I wonder if they showed more of it in the book.

[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:46.260]
I don't know.

[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:46.960]
It was a true story.

[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:47.660]
Yeah.

[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:49.040]
Well, that's I'm sure there was a book.

[01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:50.940]
I watched a movie.

[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:51.980]
We're talking about Blockbuster.

[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.560]
I was watching a movie on pay-per-view called E-Pu Mama, Tom B.N.

[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.300]
Which you should add to your list of movies that you have to say.

[01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:00.260]
You don't have to say that.

[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:00.500]
You don't have to say that.

[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.380]
What is that about?

[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:02.160]
Okay.

[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:08.680]
It's about two teenage boys who go on an escapade, and a romantic escapade with an older woman.

[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:10.560]
And there is this supposed to be...

[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:10.860]
I ride.

[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.720]
Spectacular four or five minute sex scene culminating in the two boys kissing each other.

[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:18.580]
And I...

[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:19.140]
Oh, my God.

[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.580]
An hour and a half of subtitles for that.

[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:27.980]
And it was cut out of the movie on pay-per-view because pay-per-view is Blockbuster.

[01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:30.020]
I know.

[01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:30.940]
So, mad.

[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:32.600]
I sat through an hour and a half.

[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:35.500]
You know, with subtitles, you can't go up, get up and get something from the kitchen

[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:38.460]
because unless you understand Spanish, you're going to miss every.

[01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:41.440]
I guess you're not going to be finding but I'm a cheerleader with the Blockbuster.

[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:43.100]
Oh, no, that was...

[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.320]
I saw that on Sundance or IFC or something.

[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:45.840]
That was good.

[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:47.700]
Have you ever seen...

[01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.620]
Did you see Fargo yet?

[01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.060]
No, I can't find it.

[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.140]
Okay, because actually I have a couple of...

[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:55.400]
Am I allowed to get more than one suggestion or you want to one?

[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.420]
Well, try to narrow it down one or two.

[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:05.600]
Okay, because I was going to suggest Hank Azaria as Agadorn Spartacus in the bird cage.

[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.000]
No, we don't want that.

[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:07.900]
You don't?

[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:09.060]
We don't want a tagadorn.

[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:10.020]
I'm sorry.

[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:10.900]
He's good at it.

[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:11.880]
What was the other one?

[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.940]
The other one is William H. Macy from Fargo.

[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.300]
He played the husband who took the contract out to kidnap the wife.

[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:21.220]
Yeah, he's great.

[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:22.240]
He's great.

[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.000]
Okay, I got a tell.

[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:23.560]
He's one of the women.

[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.880]
You wanted a woman and some big dormant from the same movie.

[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.080]
We're very far going to answer today.

[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:29.840]
Okay.

[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:31.020]
Okay, thanks.

[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:31.840]
Thanks, have a great day.

[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:32.700]
Bye-bye.

[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.220]
Bye-bye.

[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:35.060]
Sorry about that phone connection.

[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.840]
It was like a little echoey, wasn't it?

[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.140]
It was.

[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:38.320]
It was a connection.

[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.040]
It was one of them things.

[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:40.280]
It just sounds like a phone connection.

[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.400]
It's all I can tell you, bells sound sucks.

[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.460]
Got me to run out into the control room to make sure that everything was switched correctly in there.

[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:47.960]
No, no, it was a phone connection.

[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.060]
Just relax.

[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.920]
Don't start getting, don't start having a ventilator.

[01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:52.180]
Have you forgotten where you work?

[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:52.940]
Is that the problem?

[01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:53.360]
No.

[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.540]
That's exactly it.

[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.200]
Well, that's the point.

[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.120]
Everything is screwed up.

[01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.200]
I hate this place.

[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:01.000]
Nothing works here.

[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.400]
Even the audience knows that, but I know we've got them conditioned to it.

[01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:07.300]
So they don't expect here like a quality technical accoutrements.

[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:11.820]
And, uh, Clarence, by the way, the phone is still screwed up and we got line five.

[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.300]
It's still on.

[01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.020]
This has been that way for weeks and months and months.

[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:16.600]
And nobody in that place seems to give a flying crap.

[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:17.960]
Nobody cares.

[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.400]
Nobody looks to finger in.

[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:23.840]
Now that Fat Julio is gone, we haven't got a Chinaman's chance in hell of getting anything fixed ever again.

[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.400]
Boy, that was a bad day for us.

[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:30.040]
And I think Julio's sin was that he concerted a little bit with us too much with us.

[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.580]
And popped his head in the door every morning to make sure that everything was working.

[01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.300]
I don't think they took a shine to that.

[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.600]
I think they took a great exception to that, quite frankly.

[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:41.040]
But that's our, you know, that's Bob Vermouth and George Corso.

[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.560]
In fact, they're opening up an engineering, a engineering supply store.

[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.600]
It's called Asphalt's Us.

[01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:51.840]
1027 at 560 WDQM.

[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.820]
Here's something that it's good for.

[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.040]
And I'm still waiting for it.

[01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.500]
Skippy, I'm still waiting for that package.

[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:56.240]
Have you seen the package?

[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:57.100]
Not here yet.

[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:58.860]
For my olio-med.

[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:00.640]
Olio-med self-chails are good stuff.

[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:03.660]
I'm looking forward to getting it because I'm actually taking it for my blood pressure.

[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:05.320]
And it's doing some pretty good things.

[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.460]
I still got a little bit left, but I want my package Skippy.

[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.360]
Okay, get with it.

[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.140]
Get on these people.

[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:15.220]
I blood pressure this morning before medication BM 128 over 82.

[01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:16.620]
Pretty, pretty good, if you ask me.

[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.840]
Anyway, olio-med isn't just ordinary olive oil.

[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.760]
It's super concentrated, loaded with health benefits.

[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:24.500]
And olio-med in your post every day can up-produce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol.

If I am in town, at 560-WQ-A-M.

[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.400]
Not only are some American idol contestants facing legal trouble,

[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:38.260]
now news reports are beginning to filter in about the judges on the Fox TV show.

[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.780]
In 1977, Simon Cowell was charged with attacking a man at Studio 54,

[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.280]
and nearly strangling him to death with his own Pukashells.

[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.780]
The salt charges were later dismissed, and Cowell was placed on probation.

[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.320]
Later that same year, Simon Cowell was arrested again.

[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:01.120]
This time, LAPD charged him with solicitation on Hollywood Boulevard.

[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.840]
Cowell was picked up wearing lace panties and a leopard cat suit,

[01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:09.340]
and was carrying ID that said his name was Alice Reynolds of Laguna Beach.

[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:17.220]
In 1990, American Idol Judge Randy Jackson was arrested after attempting to eat child-star manual Lewis

[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:19.460]
at a charity function in New York City.

[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:23.620]
The diminutive actor was pulled from the throat of Randy Jackson,

[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:25.900]
and only suffered minor abrasions.

[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:30.060]
Later that same year, Randy Jackson was charged with reckless behavior

[01:14:30.060 --> 01:14:34.540]
after attacking the manager of a sizzler restaurant in Terrahode, Indiana.

[01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:39.600]
Jackson's stomach had to be pumped, and doctors reported finding 300 shrimp,

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.380]
and two bags of buffalo bones.

[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:47.940]
In 1986, American Idol Judge Paula Abdul was charged with public loodness

[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.220]
after an incident at a Los Angeles Lakers team van.

[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.360]
Later that same year, Paula Abdul was arrested outside her ex-boyfriends' apartment.

[01:14:56.700 --> 01:15:01.200]
This Abdul allegedly spray-painted the words cold-hearted snake on his de-lorion.

[01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:08.520]
It's 1032 at 560 W.A.M., remano to become highest paid TV actor.

[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:15.220]
This is amazing. You see the story? Just came over some sure he didn't.

[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:22.000]
Guess how much money Ray Romano is going to get paid for his eighth season as everybody loves Raymond.

[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:22.900]
The third!

[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:23.340]
Million.

[01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:24.660]
Fifty.

[01:15:26.100 --> 01:15:27.060]
Well, sorry.

[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:31.060]
Ray Romano struck a deal that'll make him the highest paid actor in television with nearly $50 million

[01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:33.400]
salary for the upcoming eighth season of Everybody Love.

[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.520]
Raymond, I wouldn't watch that show if you paid me by the second.

[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:43.340]
At the same time, CBS has quietly struck a deal to renew the show for an additional two seasons

[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:46.620]
and a hefty license fee of nearly $6 million in episode.

[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.260]
$6 million in episode.

[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.760]
Can you tell me why anybody watches that show?

[01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:54.620]
It's not bad.

[01:15:55.840 --> 01:15:56.280]
I see it.

[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:57.200]
Everybody loves Raymond.

[01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.340]
It's not bad. I've seen it. It can be funny.

[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:00.520]
I agree with you, Neil.

[01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.540]
I mean, I see a couple that are funny, but I don't see the big deal about it.

[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:06.280]
Fifty million dollars?

[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:10.860]
That's a lot.

[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:14.360]
$567.0560.

[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:16.120]
I'll give up.

[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:16.760]
I'll give up.

[01:16:16.900 --> 01:16:17.500]
I'll throw in the towel.

[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.040]
I'll surrender before you give up.

[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.240]
I'm going to wipe a flag.

[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:20.600]
A flag.

[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:20.960]
Yeah?

[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.100]
Can you check your facts machine?

[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:28.040]
I'm getting all these no answers and receive errors.

[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:29.720]
Oh, jeez.

[01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:31.660]
I just got the one minute ago.

[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:32.720]
Well, that's.

[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:32.940]
Yeah.

[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:35.040]
That's not happening all the time.

[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.420]
Nothing wrong with this, then.

[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:39.280]
Nothing wrong with this, then.

[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:39.740]
I'll be sleeping.

[01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:41.060]
It's waiting for your next thing.

[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:42.580]
There's absolutely nothing wrong with my...

[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.100]
See, the technical problems are always on the QAM...

[01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:46.960]
Back to the end.

[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.540]
Always on your end.

[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.920]
99% of the time.

[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:51.100]
Yeah.

[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:55.500]
You want to try one more time and then I'll like unplug it and then I'll plug it back in again.

[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.240]
Here it comes.

[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.840]
Here it comes. It's coming.

[01:16:59.080 --> 01:16:59.640]
Squirt, Squirt.

[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.700]
Who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.840]
Lee J. Cobb, Joseph Cotton, Carl Maldon, Ken Maldon.

[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.060]
Martin Balsam, Ed O'Neal, Terence Stand, Gary Oldman, Sterling Hayden.

[01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.480]
Oh, Sterling Hayden was so great.

[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.180]
Well, he was great period, but the Godfather was really good.

[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:17.560]
The big, your brother, brains all over your nice, I release suit.

[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:20.520]
He enjoyed his view, too, I'll say to that, didn't he?

[01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:21.980]
Well, it lasted.

[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:22.620]
Huh?

[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:22.920]
Yeah.

[01:17:23.140 --> 01:17:26.480]
He had a fork fall here right in his purse when he got the...

[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:26.800]
Remember?

[01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:27.760]
Right.

[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.620]
Right, he got that bull in the head.

[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.000]
The big, your brother, brains all over your nice, I release suit.

[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.660]
Don't forget two shots of peace in the head.

[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.920]
And drop the gun.

[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:41.620]
Steve Buscemi, James Spader, and Spider-Djourges hysterical opposition,

[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:46.400]
John Kazell, Fredo, or is that name of the character he played in the dark day afternoon?

[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:47.440]
Sonny?

[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:48.900]
No, sonny was Al Pacino.

[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:49.840]
Sonny was Al Pacino.

[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:50.320]
Ah!

[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:50.880]
Edeka!

[01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:51.700]
Edeka!

[01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:54.020]
We don't know, we'll find out.

[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:58.920]
Patricia Neal, Laura Duren, Robert Ryan, James Garner, William H. Macy,

[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:02.480]
I do like his department store, a-ha, low-nobody shops there, and Francis McDonald.

[01:18:03.340 --> 01:18:06.240]
Anybody shop at Macy's and at the Macy Shopping Center?

[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:08.520]
Sal.

[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:10.640]
Sal?

[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.620]
Yeah, he shops there.

[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:12.720]
Sal Falcone?

[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:13.480]
Right.

[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.200]
Is he there?

[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:18.640]
No, no, that's Fredo's name in dark day afternoon.

[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.560]
Oh, Sal shops at Macy's?

[01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:21.020]
Yeah.

[01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:23.000]
Yeah, you're right, Sal.

[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.360]
Can't do it, Sally.

[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.700]
And it's Francis McDormand, by the way.

[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.660]
What did I just say?

[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.040]
McDonald.

[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.160]
Oh, I did not.

[01:18:29.340 --> 01:18:30.240]
I said Francis McDormand.

[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:31.020]
I mean, McDormand.

[01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:37.600]
560, 7.0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.120]
We're going to milk this movie thing.

[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:45.480]
And even though that lady, she was very nice and she commented about happiness and American

[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:45.920]
cycle.

[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.840]
But I don't know.

[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.760]
I don't think anybody is getting any of these because we're talking about them.

[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.260]
That's okay.

[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.840]
That's okay because you'd probably be buying them a blockbuster when you win and then you'd get the watered down version and you'll say,

[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.920]
what would you like about that?

[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:58.880]
They're really sucked, you know?

[01:18:59.140 --> 01:18:59.840]
It ought to be illegal.

[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:05.760]
I hear that in American cycle, a version that the appendent blockbuster, nobody gets killed.

[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.920]
That's what I'm hearing.

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.660]
They have tea.

[01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:12.220]
In the versions of Godfather, nobody gets killed.

[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:20.260]
And when Godfather 3, the version of blockbuster, when the Pope finishes that cup of tea, he's got to be smile on his face.

[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:22.960]
And what's up, feeling refreshed.

[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:25.240]
Here's Miami Beach on 9.

[01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:25.560]
Hello.

[01:19:26.580 --> 01:19:27.380]
Hey, what's up?

[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.600]
I'm going to have to say Harvey Keitell, great actor, he doesn't get the most competitive shit.

[01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:40.680]
And some happiness, have you seen the other movie, but this is by the same director, it's welcome to the Dalton House?

[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:42.200]
No, but I'm going to get it.

[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:42.540]
Pretty funny.

[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.260]
Okay.

[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.440]
Harvey Keitell, definitely a bad lieutenant, great movie.

[01:19:45.740 --> 01:19:46.580]
Got you down, thanks.

[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.540]
Okay, now I did hit that.

[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:50.740]
Okay, and it's that.

[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:51.820]
I think we all did.

[01:19:52.260 --> 01:19:53.740]
I think we all did.

[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.420]
Oh, that's that even idea.

[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.540]
Just to make sure.

[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:04.020]
Just so we don't get no more articles by Tom Jekerson, that's the best he can write about what's happening in local radio.

[01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:05.440]
Oh, Tom, you're so weak.

[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:07.940]
Did we get any spy reports on Tom's performance Friday night?

[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.360]
No.

[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.040]
We heard from as many people as must have been listening, which is the big zero.

[01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.560]
Must have had some calls, Tom.

[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:25.960]
I'll tell you what, we'll probably hear from those people right after we hear from Randy, that lawyer guy with his a broward commission thing on the paper night, after he calls this back again or faxes it.

[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.160]
Well, he's busy.

[01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:28.520]
He's busy lawyer ring or something.

[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.080]
Oh, he wasn't too busy to use me.

[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:34.520]
I know there's a couple of days there and get very indignant when I said that he made that story up.

[01:20:34.740 --> 01:20:35.040]
Remember that?

[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:35.420]
Right.

[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:36.860]
Well, got very indignant.

[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.380]
How dare you?

[01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.900]
Well, I mean, it turns out he didn't make it up, but where's the follow through?

[01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:41.560]
Where's the indignation?

[01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.040]
Where's something, huh?

[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.080]
Here's for a lot of Dale.

[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:46.320]
Hello.

[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:47.480]
Neil.

[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:49.040]
Hello.

[01:20:49.260 --> 01:20:52.840]
I wanted to talk to you about happiness and Todd Solens also.

[01:20:53.900 --> 01:20:57.040]
You had a couple of people that mentioned the welcome to the dollhouse.

[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:57.520]
Right.

[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.320]
Which is, that's a great movie.

[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:03.600]
It was this first movie, but he also had a third movie out after happiness.

[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.260]
That was called Storytelling.

[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:12.540]
And neither as good as happiness, I don't think, but there were scenes just because of the sort of risks he takes in the movie.

[01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:19.120]
It was a particular scene in Storytelling that the critics wanted to just, you know, take it out of the movie

[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:25.500]
because it involved a young white college student who kind of goes to bed with a black professor.

[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:26.440]
All right.

[01:21:27.060 --> 01:21:29.960]
And he would not be in two graphic.

[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:30.720]
How much of a word?

[01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.000]
How much of a word you want to see that in blackbuster?

[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:32.920]
I mean, in blackbuster.

[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:38.780]
Well, it's curious because actually the one scene where he has a reference law on, he makes her say,

[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:44.620]
F. Me Nigger, he keeps making her repeat that as they're doing their acts so to speak.

[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.000]
And instead of cutting it, the director refused to cut that out.

[01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:56.240]
So to sort of make a statement, he just put this big, gigantic red block over them.

[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:59.240]
So it's totally blocked out of this, even though you can hear them.

[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:05.480]
Just to sort of make a statement about the essentially just put a big, gigantic red block to block it out.

[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.240]
But left all the audio and everything else in.

[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.220]
And that's how it played in the movies.

[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.140]
And I did see it on pay-per-view and they didn't, there wasn't an unedited version.

[01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:18.700]
But I just heard that woman say that pay-per-view is run by blackbusters.

[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:20.500]
Well, maybe that answers your question.

[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.520]
But maybe the, I don't know, I never checked out the DVD.

[01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:25.240]
Maybe the DVD would be uncensored.

[01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:27.380]
But it's worth checking out now.

[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:28.180]
Okay.

[01:22:28.660 --> 01:22:29.660]
All right. Thanks.

[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:30.020]
Thanks, Bill.

[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.160]
And most DVDs have got like the California DVD.

[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:37.880]
It had the R-Waded in the theater version and also had the unedited version.

[01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:40.020]
Yeah.

[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:41.460]
And I'm still embarrassed though.

[01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.800]
I guess I shouldn't be as embarrassed since you're supposed to be the experts.

[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:47.140]
And I didn't realize that you have the two different versions on many of the discs.

[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:53.040]
You know, right away as soon as you open up your package, if I can say that, can I say package?

[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:54.080]
No.

[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.700]
As soon as you open up the thing, can you see the disc itself?

[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:01.420]
If I'm one side, it's got like a label and you know that's only got one side.

[01:23:01.540 --> 01:23:01.580]
Right.

[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:06.620]
Although even some of the ones that have one side, for example, a wait a minute, California's one ahead,

[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:08.300]
and that's why I just said two different versions.

[01:23:10.420 --> 01:23:11.600]
But only on one side.

[01:23:11.740 --> 01:23:14.640]
The ones that have both sides have a crap on them video.

[01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:20.580]
The wide screen is on one side and the other one is the, what do you call it?

[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:20.960]
Letterbox.

[01:23:21.260 --> 01:23:21.960]
What do they call it?

[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.080]
They don't call it a letterbox.

[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:25.440]
Regular and letterbox, which is the wide screen.

[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:35.040]
There's regular, regular TV format and letterbox, aka, wide screen, E-Wider.

[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:36.940]
It is wider.

[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:40.600]
In fact, on one of me, when I watched it, I wouldn't believe how wide it was.

[01:23:43.660 --> 01:23:47.440]
This is War!

[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:53.940]
Not as pedophile coming up tonight on Inside of the Hind, the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story.

[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.400]
We take it good, hard, stiff looking to start up.

[01:23:57.740 --> 01:24:02.880]
When Robert Palmer met two guys from Durand Durand, the magic they made together can only be described as,

[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:08.560]
well, Robert Palmer and two guys from Durand Durand, they were the power station.

[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:15.940]
I only did the gig because Robert promised me I'll be able to f*** one of the pomegos.

[01:24:16.860 --> 01:24:19.920]
You know those hot birds and the black meat dresses that he used in his videos?

[01:24:20.500 --> 01:24:21.440]
And the Pepsi commercial?

[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:26.400]
Durand Durand's anti-taler feels completely reigned by his association with Robert Palmer.

[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.340]
I feel completely reigned by my association with Wilba Palmer.

[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.420]
Robert Palmer was not available for comment.

[01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.640]
However, the G.A. Legend Arnold Palmer was.

[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:37.300]
What are you talking about?

[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.860]
I've never reigned anybody.

[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:48.540]
How do you respond to allegations that you promised Durand Durand guitarist he could partake of the sweet love nectar, waiting to be unleashed from one of the pomemer girls?

[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:52.600]
Look, I'm sorry. I've got to go do a denture commercial.

[01:24:54.760 --> 01:25:03.940]
Anyway, the friction between anti-taler and Robert Palmer made for a tense environment in the studio as heard on this rare archival tape of a power station recording section.

[01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:06.360]
Okay, this is something I get hot take for.

[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.820]
Yeah, you gotta take for as great Robert.

[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.320]
What about me? I'm standing here with me f***ing man and I.

[01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:15.440]
Well, maybe you'll just have to shag you ya f***ing liar!

[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:18.320]
The power station.

[01:25:18.860 --> 01:25:22.600]
We'd call it a super group if it wasn't another crabby 80's band.

[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.620]
It's a big juicy, sopping-width-looking show business tonight on inside the behind.

[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.460]
1046 at 560, your fax machine screwed up. Did you ready to break the news to you?

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:33.220]
I got no answer.

[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.780]
Well, guess what? My phone.

[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:37.680]
I just listen on the phone. Is it dial tone?

[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:41.960]
I reset the whole deal. I printed something out from mother to a story out here.

[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:42.560]

[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:46.580]
Something wrong on your and man.

[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:49.200]
George has got a faulty rectum on his end.

[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.900]
So on target reset down there.

[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:54.720]
As usual, everything here is working just hunky-dory baby.

[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:59.220]
Who is the most underrated and movie actor or actress of all time rashkin today?

[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:08.540]
Lee J. Com, Joseph Cotton, Carl Maldon, Martin Balsam, Ed O'Neill, Terrence Stampe, Gary Oldman, Sterling Hayden, Steve Buschemi, James Spader,

[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:14.300]
John Cazell, Patricia Neill, Laura Durn, Robert Ryan, James Garner, William H. Macy.

[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.220]
Does anybody shop there?

[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.720]
Francis McDormand and Harvey Cartel.

[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.900]
You know what I'm talking about? The Macy shopping center there.

[01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:22.100]

[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:24.460]
We really put in Harvey Cartel on there?

[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.320]
That why not?

[01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:28.900]
He's highly acclaimed by one at all.

[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.440]
Like I said, cross him out.

[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.800]
Okay. Nominated for Academy Awards and everything.

[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.480]
Like I said, did I just say cross him out? When it doubted cross him out?

[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:36.500]
I'm sure I just said that.

[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.500]
I heard myself saying, what was the last facts you got? So I know where to start refaxing.

[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.780]
Oh, pick one.

[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:43.440]
Anyone.

[01:26:44.320 --> 01:26:45.860]
Unless you want me to fast the whole stack.

[01:26:47.140 --> 01:26:47.500]
No.

[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.040]
The last one I got was something a couple of pay you said you want me to send the second page?

[01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:53.440]
Oh, really?

[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:53.760]
Whoa.

[01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.880]
Oh, that's a long time ago.

[01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.860]
Yeah. Well, don't look at me.

[01:26:58.200 --> 01:26:59.680]
Everything's working fine on this end.

[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.420]
I mean, when I pick up that line and I hear the dial tone on the phone and I know it's working.

[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:07.140]
The line is open. There's nothing wrong with my phone line.

[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.320]
Self-test. No dial tone.

[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.120]
How can we be getting taxes?

[01:27:13.460 --> 01:27:14.720]
So there you go. No dial tone.

[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:16.160]
So it's dead on your end.

[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.140]
Dead on his end. And we don't have Jose.

[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:21.540]
I mean, holy or whatever his name is there to come in and fix it like he used to do.

[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:23.440]
Remember every time we had that problem, he had the magic touch.

[01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:25.880]
He'd come in and stick it just in the right spot.

[01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.460]
So I guess your S.O.L. man.

[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:33.040]
S.O.L.A. Q.A.M.

[01:27:33.900 --> 01:27:35.440]
And somebody ought to be OUT.

[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:37.440]
I don't want to mention no engineers names, okay?

[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:38.100]
Anything like that?

[01:27:40.220 --> 01:27:40.660]
56670560.

[01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:45.220]
Pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon line.

[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:46.340]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:47.780]
Hey, Neil.

[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:48.620]
Yes, sir.

[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:50.500]
I have a couple of suggestions for you.

[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.040]
Okay.

[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:55.100]
Underrated actors. They appeared in the same movie, which I think was an underrated film.

[01:27:56.220 --> 01:27:57.780]
Joan Allen and Jeff Bridges.

[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:00.940]
In the contender? You ever seen the contender?

[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.440]
No.

[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:06.400]
No, they need to appoint a new vice president and they want to appoint Joan Allen.

[01:28:06.580 --> 01:28:08.280]
It's the first female vice president.

[01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:09.620]
Oh, I saw that.

[01:28:09.980 --> 01:28:12.200]
Yeah, very good movie.

[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:12.840]
Very good movie.

[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.520]
Yeah, very good movie.

[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:17.740]
And I think both of that, because I think Jeff Bridges should be a big star.

[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:21.320]
But he never got that one role that made him a superstar.

[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:25.500]
Ever since Daddy started doing that in the different glue?

[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:26.480]
Yeah.

[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:30.120]
And I got a great, great movie for you.

[01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:34.080]
And it's very surprising that it's an Adam Sandler.

[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.800]
You think punch-drunk love?

[01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:37.960]
Oh, Adam Sandler.

[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:43.720]
And it was this was, it was by the guy who was doing so well until we got to this.

[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:47.580]
The guy that did Boogie Knight in Magnovia, so it's an arty film.

[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:48.120]
Yeah.

[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:49.600]
But he was phenomenal.

[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:52.120]
In this movie, he shows.

[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:55.460]
I think he was absolutely robbed of an Academy of War nomination.

[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.340]
He was incredible in this movie.

[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:02.680]
And nobody saw it because he wasn't doing his silly fart jokes or whatever the hell he did.

[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.820]
I did see Boogie Knight.

[01:29:05.140 --> 01:29:06.440]
It is so huge.

[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:06.800]
Yeah.

[01:29:07.180 --> 01:29:08.480]
And a great movie.

[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:14.100]
I don't know if it's on video yet, but it's also with Emily Watson and just a great, great movie.

[01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:17.880]
So, Philip Schiener-Hoffman is in a bunch of fake, independent movies.

[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:19.460]
But anyway, that's all I got.

[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:19.680]
Okay.

[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:20.020]
Thank you.

[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:20.860]
Thank you, Candor.

[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:21.980]
Jeff Bridges and Joan Allen.

[01:29:21.980 --> 01:29:22.800]
Got you down.

[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.180]
Thanks.

[01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:23.660]
Thanks.

[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:24.080]
Take a bite.

[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:25.520]
What was he talking about?

[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.400]
Jeff Bridges.

[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:28.780]
Well, no, Jeff Bridges is Lloyd Bridges son, right?

[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.080]
Yes.

[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:33.560]
And we were talking just the other day about Lloyd Bridges and the airplane.

[01:29:34.100 --> 01:29:34.280]
Right.

[01:29:34.620 --> 01:29:35.280]
And Sniff and Glue.

[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:36.460]
Was never what we were talking about.

[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.000]
I'm trying to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.

[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:40.840]
Don't you understand?

[01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.980]
Yeah, I picked a bad date of quit sniffing glue.

[01:29:43.060 --> 01:29:43.220]
Right.

[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.480]
Because it's back in again now.

[01:29:44.540 --> 01:29:45.380]
Nobody told him it's in.

[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:47.040]
Well, he's using it.

[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:47.900]
He's not sniffing glue anymore.

[01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.240]
He's using it to tie down his piece.

[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.600]
5607.0560, pound 560 on a 18T in Verizon, World of Slime.

[01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:55.080]
Love it at a clock.

[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:55.860]
We'll put that thing up.

[01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:56.580]
You got to be, your boy.

[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.480]
Get it.

[01:29:58.780 --> 01:30:01.300]
Is Eric got it?

[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:01.660]
Yeah.

[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:02.500]
He'll be getting it.

[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:02.880]
He'll be getting it.

[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.020]
He'll be getting it.

[01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:04.320]
He's going to get it.

[01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.860]
Here's the call from Point and V.

[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:09.180]
Hello.

[01:30:09.540 --> 01:30:09.940]
How you doing?

[01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:10.560]
Good.

[01:30:11.020 --> 01:30:13.900]
The only reason you watch everybody loves rain and isn't for rain.

[01:30:14.020 --> 01:30:16.480]
And it's for his parents, Peter Boyle and Lauren Roberts.

[01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:17.360]
There's a show.

[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:24.780]
The article you were mentioning with is congressional, this aid dies in this congressman's or something more of us.

[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.060]
Is that on your website?

[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:28.380]
The Jo Scarborough thing?

[01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:29.640]
I think that's what it is.

[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.140]
Because I've been searching for it for a week and it's just, it's not there anywhere.

[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:35.040]
Where was that?

[01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:37.060]
That was the last one you fixed me that I got, I think.

[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:39.860]
Oh, no, that is on there, isn't it?

[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:42.020]
I'm not sure.

[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:42.720]
I don't know.

[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:45.060]
It might be, it might be on today's stack.

[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.100]
Fox pulling cable news to the right.

[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:48.140]
Is that the one you're talking about?

[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:49.720]
I'm not sure.

[01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:51.340]
That's the one.

[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.560]
It's an article that I can't seem to find anywhere on the internet for the last week.

[01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.140]
It's on there today, it's on our website.

[01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.640]
Fox pulling cable news to the right.

[01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.240]
If it's that one, that one's already on there.

[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:02.020]
If it's one of the other ones, it'll be on there shortly.

[01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:03.460]
I'll look for it.

[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:06.660]
You're doing the best of this year for a band and rescue?

[01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:07.320]
Right.

[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:09.520]
We went there about six months ago.

[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.480]
I know you don't like kitty cats per se, but anyhow we needed to replace our cat.

[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.300]
The place was clean, all the shots.

[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:20.560]
We picked a two-year-old little orange tabby cat.

[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:26.740]
I mentioned that I listened to Nio drop a little something for them.

[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.700]
They were really struggling six months ago and they probably still are.

[01:31:31.340 --> 01:31:35.500]
The bush brothers had slashed their budget to the point that they're barely treading water.

[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:40.480]
I just think it's a great thing you're doing for just what you do for all the charities.

[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:46.180]
But anyhow, I'm going to buy like a dozen discs this year because they're just a really nice operation.

[01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:51.020]
They try and save these cats and dogs from the gas chamber.

[01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.920]
They just say the bush brothers have killed them and you're doing a really great thing for them.

[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.900]
So I appreciate it and I know they do.

[01:31:58.240 --> 01:31:59.020]
Okay, good. Thanks a lot.

[01:31:59.020 --> 01:31:59.420]
Thank you.

[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.400]
New Jersey man allegedly bit his sisters right hand with such force.

[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.800]
He tore off the tip of a right index figure, which he then swallowed.

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:07.140]
Police said he swallowed it.

[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:10.160]
Yeah, your faxes are coming through like in bushes now.

[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:10.920]
Do you want to look at it?

[01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.140]
See, it was on your end, right?

[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.320]
Kicked it.

[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:14.000]
Uh-huh.

[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.140]
It was on your end.

[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:22.360]
See, if we had some maintenance going on in the New Yorkshire, I realized that's a word that they don't understand in our engineering department with less of it.

[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.600]
Let's see, you can get happiness on circuitcity.com.

[01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.040]
Their movies are cheaper and arrive faster than Amazon.com.

[01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.500]
Why don't you do that?

[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:31.780]
I'm going to do it right now.

[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:33.460]
Circuitcity.com.

[01:32:33.740 --> 01:32:36.420]
Or I could go that Amazon since I already have an account.

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:40.760]
It says their movies are cheaper and arrive faster than Amazon.com.

[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:41.440]
I'm going to compare.

[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:42.920]
Well, there you go.

[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.300]
Yeah, do a little comparison shopping.

[01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:48.200]
Because in your case, let's see, got hung up on three times so I'll try the faxes Greg.

[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:51.200]
Slim Pickens is and was great as he's still alive.

[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.420]
Do we know where Slim Pickens is still alive?

[01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:54.960]
I don't know.

[01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.040]
Should we put him on a list?

[01:32:57.640 --> 01:32:57.900]
Whatever.

[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.660]
I want to know what the hell does that mean?

[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.700]
He's just an average character actor.

[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.000]
Yeah.

[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.780]
He's not exactly, he's okay.

[01:33:05.780 --> 01:33:06.960]
Christopher walking.

[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:11.700]
Oh, I like him a lot.

[01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:13.020]
I don't know how big he is though.

[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:14.220]
That's what I'm thinking.

[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:14.700]
Pretty big.

[01:33:15.060 --> 01:33:17.380]
No, he's not like a major.

[01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:18.600]
He's not like a...

[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:18.980]
Put him on there.

[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.420]
Harrison Ford and that crowd.

[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:20.880]
No.

[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.100]
No, that's what we're talking about.

[01:33:23.100 --> 01:33:24.800]
We're talking about the rung underneath.

[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:25.480]
Okay.

[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:26.660]
Underneath.

[01:33:27.100 --> 01:33:27.780]
The underrung.

[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:32.420]
When you scrape away the top layer, what do you got underneath?

[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.340]
Tom Skirrit.

[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.080]
He did.

[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:37.980]
And then about away.

[01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:38.620]
Tom Skirrit.

[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.040]
Oh, he's been in a million things.

[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.440]
You'll know him if he saw him.

[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:42.100]
Is he good?

[01:33:42.540 --> 01:33:42.900]
He is good.

[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:43.600]
He's adequate.

[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:45.780]
Adequate don't cut it.

[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.100]
Okay.

[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.680]
The question is, who is the most underrated movie actor actors of all time?

[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:51.000]
I'm not putting no Tom Skirrit.

[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:51.960]
Okay, one out of two ain't bad.

[01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.420]
Slim Pickens.

[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.000]
Slim Pickens was a character actor like Gabby Hayes, you know?

[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:56.240]
Right.

[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:57.680]
I don't think so.

[01:33:59.020 --> 01:34:03.040]
Omar Luzano, 40 of West New York, was held at the Ori-Ed Road Jail on Monday.

[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:07.360]
This is in Temple Terrace by Tampa.

[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:12.180]
On aggravated battery enough, structing an officer, this is today.

[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.600]
Bond hadn't been set on the battery charge.

[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.740]
Jail official said early day.

[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:20.660]
Luzano was at a club with his sister Isabelle Gonzalez, 45, before getting into an argument with a woman early yesterday.

[01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:23.500]
During the argument, Gonzalez put her right hand over Luzano's face.

[01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:28.300]
Police said Luzano allegedly bit the woman's index finger when he finally released it.

[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.500]
He had bitten off the last joint and he swallowed it.

[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.260]
Damn it.

[01:34:32.380 --> 01:34:36.260]
I know Carlos hates when that happens when somebody bites off his last joint and then swallows it.

[01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:37.840]
Yeah.

[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.720]
Is that before or after he lights it?

[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.560]
Gonzalez was treated and released from University of Community Hospital.

[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:46.000]
Temple Terrace, it says, is about seven miles north of Tampa.

[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.000]
Not too far from Luz.

[01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:50.500]
One of our very favorites, the chronic from Luz.

[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.540]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T Infraurized Line.

[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:58.880]
After this break, the pull goes up.

[01:34:58.940 --> 01:34:59.840]
Is that official, Dean Arbor?

[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:01.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:04.340]
Like I said, after this break, the pull goes up or else...

[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.980]
Line 5, local.

[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:10.160]
Here's sports radio 5.60, C-A-A-M.

[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:13.820]
Man, that's high f**king dumbass!

[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:14.360]
Morning.

[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:18.060]
We have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted.

[01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:21.400]
Is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible?

[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:23.580]
We hope we reach that goal, or at least major life.

[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.820]
Back to film agro is our guest.

[01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.640]
I do yell at my children and I don't know how to stop.

[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.140]
Let's talk about that more later now.

[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.740]
Let's go to your calls for Dr. Phil.

[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:34.020]
And we start with Northport, New York. Hello.

[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:35.060]
Hi, Dr. Phil.

[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:35.920]
Hi, how are you?

[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:40.380]
I lost my job a few months ago and kind of affecting my marriage.

[01:35:40.380 --> 01:35:42.120]
I've really been depressed about it.

[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.600]
What would you prescribe?

[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:45.840]
Alcohol and drugs.

[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:47.180]
I don't know.

[01:35:47.480 --> 01:35:49.280]
I'm contributing to the cause.

[01:35:49.340 --> 01:35:49.900]
Oh, beautiful.

[01:35:50.020 --> 01:35:51.220]
Cardi New Jersey, hello.

[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.260]
Hey, boys. How's it hanging?

[01:35:53.780 --> 01:35:54.120]
Fine.

[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:56.000]
Will you two kiss for me?

[01:35:56.440 --> 01:35:57.120]
You're kidding.

[01:35:57.540 --> 01:35:58.680]
No, I'm serious, you guys.

[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:00.180]
I'm talking full tongue.

[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.700]
I don't mind doing that.

[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:03.180]
Hey, how about a shame to say so?

[01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:03.620]
Obviously.

[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.180]
Are you just waiting for it and we'll...

[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:05.520]
Uh-oh.

[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:09.760]
Yeah, that's a boy lady.

[01:36:10.180 --> 01:36:10.500]
Woo!

[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:12.240]
It's so dumb.

[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.060]
Go away.

[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:16.260]
11 o'clock at 5'60.

[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.440]
W. You're gonna pull his up.

[01:36:17.740 --> 01:36:18.200]
Isn't it?

[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:20.360]
Well, it's getting there.

[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:24.580]
It says that my thing over here says the pull is down.

[01:36:26.020 --> 01:36:27.720]
I thought the pull was gonna be up, being a boy.

[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.420]
And don't be blaming everybody else.

[01:36:29.560 --> 01:36:29.980]
Is it up?

[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:30.300]
Yep.

[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:31.760]
It's down on mine.

[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:33.700]
Let me just refresh one time.

[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.120]
Let me take a good refreshing...

[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:35.680]
There you go.

[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:37.500]
Sneak one out.

[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.240]
It's up right now.

[01:36:38.340 --> 01:36:39.760]
The votes are starting to pour in now.

[01:36:39.980 --> 01:36:43.040]
Who is the most underrated movie actor actress of all time?

[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.900]
Four Alex, you know, Alex who fixes every single day.

[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.440]
Who just, you know, he means well.

[01:36:50.620 --> 01:36:51.580]
He's really loyal.

[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:52.160]
He's out there.

[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.020]
But he's 99% of the time.

[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:54.680]
He can't get it right.

[01:36:55.560 --> 01:36:57.840]
He says, here are two actors I believe are underrated.

[01:36:58.320 --> 01:36:59.920]
Michael, Kane, and Tommy Lee Jones.

[01:37:01.640 --> 01:37:03.860]
We already made fun of him before I fixed it.

[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:08.440]
But so you don't feel alone, Alex.

[01:37:08.580 --> 01:37:10.680]
Here's another facts with two ridiculous suggestions.

[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:12.600]
Although I put one of them on her actually.

[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.560]
Peter Sellers, of course not.

[01:37:14.680 --> 01:37:16.940]
Peter Sellers was the star in every movie that he was in.

[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:17.760]
Every single one.

[01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:18.380]
Right.

[01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:21.160]
But Peter Laurie, I think, is not a bad suggestion.

[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:21.920]
I agree.

[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:24.260]
He was never the superstar, but he was great.

[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.180]
In fact, he was one of a kind.

[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.560]
There was never any other Peter Laurie.

[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:28.920]
Right?

[01:37:29.080 --> 01:37:29.440]
I got that right.

[01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:33.440]
Not necessarily just like what's his name with the young Dr. Frankenstein.

[01:37:33.720 --> 01:37:35.400]
Like, never mind if you fell, Marty Felder.

[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:35.900]
Right.

[01:37:36.500 --> 01:37:37.520]
There's only one of him.

[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.440]
Bella Gosey, there was only one of him.

[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:40.760]
Right?

[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:41.520]
Right.

[01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:45.280]
I mean, there's a zillion leading men and leading ladies and, you know,

[01:37:45.480 --> 01:37:46.540]
different hair or a different face.

[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:48.140]
But other than that, it's mixed in match.

[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.640]
But there was only one Peter Laurie.

[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.960]
And he was never like the leading guy.

[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:53.460]
He was good.

[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.980]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T in Verizon Wireless.

[01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:00.140]
We got the facts working.

[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:02.560]
Everything is great at QIM.

[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:05.980]
Everything works once in a while, like our engineering department.

[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.720]
And our sales department, if you're one of our clients, by the way,

[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.440]
don't expect to get any copy changes or anything like that to Labor Day.

[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:16.160]
Our sales department's on permanent vacation, aren't they?

[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:16.900]
Right.

[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.500]
Except Bob Eisenberg, who sends me facts his 1130 of night.

[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:22.920]
Here's a call from Jupiter.

[01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:23.240]
Hello.

[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:25.420]
Neil.

[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:26.200]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:27.580]
Hey, yeah.

[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.420]
Hey, Neil, I got a good question for you guys on Ricklund for a dream.

[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.340]
I don't know if you all caught it, but the Juicy Man.

[01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:35.840]
He had three points to make.

[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.360]
One was drink juice.

[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.420]
No, no, no, no.

[01:38:38.540 --> 01:38:39.820]
The first one was no red meat.

[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.280]
No red meat, right?

[01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:43.180]
The second one was a void refined sugar.

[01:38:43.380 --> 01:38:45.000]
And the third one, I don't know what the third one was.

[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:45.620]
Did we ever...

[01:38:45.620 --> 01:38:46.640]
I don't think it ever came out.

[01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:47.480]
That was my question.

[01:38:47.620 --> 01:38:48.460]
Did it serve on every circuit?

[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:52.380]
No, because I think he and the other Sarah popped out of the TV set

[01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:53.960]
into a living room before they came up to that.

[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:55.640]
Before he gets to the point of that.

[01:38:55.640 --> 01:38:57.780]
That thing, that thing, that thing, that thing, that thing.

[01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.600]
And he started doing it while dancing was great.

[01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.240]
Just by Sarah.

[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:02.020]
Just by Sarah.

[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.440]
I'm going to tell you, anybody who hasn't seen that movie

[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.420]
isn't even over life is all about, you know?

[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.500]
You should make a list kind of like an Oprah's book list

[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:11.220]
put on your website of these movies.

[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:12.160]
Not ones that people would have thought about.

[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.220]
I think that's a good idea.

[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.520]
It's an excellent idea, right?

[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:14.820]
That's not good.

[01:39:15.240 --> 01:39:19.280]
And one way I say, I know the Godfather, if you have a car for like, you know,

[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:20.980]
been made the best movie made.

[01:39:22.420 --> 01:39:26.180]
Sonny, when he's beaten up his brother-in-the-street carlo.

[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.160]
Yeah, when he's looking at me, watch the side of you.

[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.100]
He's missing them by six or seven inches.

[01:39:32.460 --> 01:39:34.060]
I had noticed that, you're right.

[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:36.440]
And that's like the only picture in the movie I found.

[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:37.660]
Okay, thanks.

[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:38.340]
Thank you.

[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:39.140]
He's right.

[01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:41.220]
We ought to have that bitch, Oprah.

[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.860]
I mean, look at the tremendous influence we have over everybody.

[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:46.460]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:46.800]
None.

[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.100]
Couldn't get one letter to the editor in a son-centre-ler than a herald

[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:54.400]
about the Broward Commission passing that resolution against the pay-tune act.

[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:55.000]
Not one.

[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:55.780]
Zero.

[01:39:56.220 --> 01:39:57.420]
Do we have the influence or what?

[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.460]
But I still think that's a good idea.

[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.820]
Take up some space for you there on your website, Beener Boy.

[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:05.280]
It is underway.

[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:07.900]
Recommended movies.

[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:09.640]
Now, which movies do we put on there so far?

[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:10.940]
Okay, let's not get too carried away.

[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:12.600]
Do not put Bully on there. Bully sucked.

[01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:13.220]
Oh, no.

[01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:15.000]
I took that off right away.

[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:16.800]
I'm talking about the ones that I like.

[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.440]
Okay, I know George will have trouble with that, but the ones that I like.

[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:20.320]
George will have his own list.

[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:22.180]
Man, that's a good idea.

[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:23.940]
In fact, we can all have our own list.

[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:24.120]
Right.

[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:26.380]
And then we'll have a list of the ones that we all agree on.

[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:27.680]
Right?

[01:40:28.900 --> 01:40:32.180]
We can have juiceed by Niels, juiceed by Jorge, and juiceed by Carlos.

[01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:33.280]
By Beener Boy.

[01:40:33.460 --> 01:40:33.940]
The Juicy Man.

[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:35.100]
The Juicy Man.

[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:36.420]
We got a winner.

[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:37.100]
Speaking of juice.

[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:37.660]
We got a winner.

[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:38.240]
Yes.

[01:40:38.640 --> 01:40:43.100]
I found happiness at both of those locations, but you know how Amazon, when you go shopping there,

[01:40:43.140 --> 01:40:46.040]
they also give you the prices of other places and they kind of pimp for them.

[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.540]
DVDs overnight out of New York has it for the cheapest price.

[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.400]
So I'm ordering it through Amazon.

[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:53.060]

[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:54.520]
16 and change.

[01:40:54.800 --> 01:40:59.380]
Oh, I'm going to show like you, especially now that you've got that bonus money, big shout-out like you can afford it.

[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:00.400]
You get your bonus money in?

[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:01.020]
Order and hit it.

[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:01.720]
No.

[01:41:02.060 --> 01:41:02.460]
I did.

[01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:06.660]
I just mentioned that in passing because I knew that would piss you off.

[01:41:06.900 --> 01:41:07.460]
But you're important.

[01:41:07.980 --> 01:41:08.640]
No, that's true.

[01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:09.660]
You're just small potatoes.

[01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.720]
He'll be a lot more important soon, though.

[01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.640]
Do you realize how close we are to that summer schedule?

[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:14.980]
Yep.

[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:17.880]
Yeah.

[01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:19.900]
God.

[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:22.660]
We are getting really, really close to that.

[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:27.720]
You have any idea how great that is to be only working Tuesday and Thursday for like the most of two months?

[01:41:28.460 --> 01:41:29.180]
I can only imagine.

[01:41:29.660 --> 01:41:29.900]
Yeah.

[01:41:30.380 --> 01:41:31.120]
Sounds good to me.

[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:33.220]
And what are we going to do during the summer months now?

[01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:35.200]
When I go on vacation, which isn't that far away,

[01:41:35.740 --> 01:41:40.100]
Beener is going to have to be doing the bedtime stories on our website every day for like about 10 days.

[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:41.880]
You are aware of that, aren't you?

[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:42.700]
I can handle it.

[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:43.380]
I can handle it.

[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:43.580]
I can handle it.

[01:41:43.800 --> 01:41:44.960]
In fact, you're going to have to be doing it every day.

[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:45.960]
I'm going to write through Memorial Day.

[01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:46.660]
I'm smart.

[01:41:48.380 --> 01:41:48.740]
Yeah.

[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:51.360]
This don't go fishing is probably a good idea.

[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.720]
Don't say too many Hail Mary's.

[01:41:53.980 --> 01:41:55.900]
But the summertime is going to have to, because I mean,

[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.760]
Dan, if I'm going to get up six o'clock in the morning all the summer long when I'm not working,

[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:03.100]
or so I can feed you a bunch of cramped stories, you can handle it.

[01:42:04.180 --> 01:42:09.100]
In fact, I'm sure that Georgia will make sure there's a big something extra in your paycheck every couple of weeks.

[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.880]
Yeah, that's exactly what's a big fat one.

[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:14.500]
Here's a call from Kendall.

[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:15.080]

[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:16.580]
Yes, sir.

[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:17.540]
How are you doing today?

[01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:18.220]
Great.

[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:18.820]
Sensational.

[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:19.720]
Great.

[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:21.300]
I've got four names for you.

[01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:21.880]
Okay.

[01:42:22.380 --> 01:42:22.660]
Four.

[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:23.520]
George Kennedy.

[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:25.920]
George Kennedy was excellent.

[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:26.280]
You're right.

[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:27.380]
Okay.

[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:29.040]
Second one is Ernest Ford 9.

[01:42:30.420 --> 01:42:30.740]
Okay.

[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.400]
Jason Robard.

[01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:35.620]
Wait, don't go, well, now Jason Robards was like a star.

[01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.060]
Well, I guess I'm telling my age again.

[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:39.800]
And the last one is Eli Wallet.

[01:42:40.820 --> 01:42:42.540]
Oh, up until Godfather 3.

[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.820]
Did you see my father 3?

[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:48.200]
Right.

[01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:50.140]
Did you see Godfather 3?

[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:51.780]
No, I didn't.

[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.600]
Oh, that's why he's still saying Eli Wallet.

[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:56.260]
If you'd seen Godfather 3, it probably would have sent you back away.

[01:42:56.500 --> 01:43:02.080]
But you're right, he was ordinarily a damn good actor, but in that movie he just disgraced him and humiliated himself.

[01:43:02.460 --> 01:43:04.780]
I think he was in that 12-angry man also, wasn't he?

[01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:05.420]
Right, that's right.

[01:43:05.520 --> 01:43:06.080]
Yeah, we got him down.

[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:07.140]
Okay, sir.

[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.280]
And Patricia Neal, is she still alive?

[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:13.020]
I don't know, but Beener Boy, look it up right now.

[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.980]
Alrighty, and when you're away, George puts on a good show and you guys have a great day.

[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:19.000]
And you too, thanks.

[01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:20.460]
See, there's a guy that's a happy guy.

[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:23.900]
He likes me, like George, even like Spinner Boy a little bit, not too much.

[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:26.940]
Patricia Neal, any AL, see if she's still alive, okay?

[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:27.980]
Ew, God.

[01:43:28.860 --> 01:43:29.780]
How's Orlando doing?

[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.380]
Well, there's a show coming up on May 27th, I believe, to the date.

[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:39.440]
On male models, some of whom actually were head or sexual acquaintance, on independent films.

[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.380]
Do you know that that IFC is a hell of a lot better than I ever realized?

[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:42.800]
Oh, no.

[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:45.540]
That's a damn good channel independent film channel.

[01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:46.780]
What's on it right now?

[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:49.640]
Uh, commercial.

[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:52.440]
And just watch how Rebo is...

[01:43:52.440 --> 01:43:55.980]
Oh, the Rebo Starler, I think you're probably Bob Eisenberg, and he's one of those.

[01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:57.840]
And maybe he can have another one for Moe too.

[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.100]
And Patricia Neal is still alive.

[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:02.780]
Patricia Neal is...

[01:44:02.780 --> 01:44:05.920]
The hitter was five shots, and he's still alive.

[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:07.820]
I just love the way he says that.

[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:08.540]
So let's go.

[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:09.880]
He's still alive.

[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:13.660]
And that's bad news for you, if you don't make...

[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:15.220]
Get Santino to make that deal.

[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:17.000]
Something like that.

[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:18.220]
See, I'm slipping now.

[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:21.240]
Peter Loray, George Kennedy, Ernest Borg-9 Eli Walla.

[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:22.000]
Guess who's in front?

[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:22.960]
Christopher Walken.

[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:24.520]
He's got ten.

[01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:25.020]
He's great.

[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:26.040]
He's walking out, sir.

[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:28.980]
Steve Buscemi's got six, Ed O'Neal five.

[01:44:28.980 --> 01:44:30.900]
Lee J. Cobb has got five.

[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:31.520]
All right.

[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.440]
I should have voted for him.

[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:35.780]
Gary Oldman three.

[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:36.860]
William Macy two.

[01:44:36.980 --> 01:44:37.380]
You know what movie?

[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.700]
Lee J. Cobb, he said, the exorcist on the waterfront.

[01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:40.620]
Right.

[01:44:41.060 --> 01:44:41.440]
Remember that?

[01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:48.000]
In fact, maybe somebody will fax it to me, because every now and then he'll fax us like a bibliography of crap.

[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:52.480]
You know, his career in all the green movies, he was sensational.

[01:44:52.740 --> 01:44:53.440]
But he was never...

[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:54.520]
I don't think ever the star.

[01:44:54.520 --> 01:44:58.460]
He just wasn't one of those guys who was the star, but a great supporting actor.

[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:00.340]
Harvey Kytel three.

[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:01.000]
Gary Oldman three.

[01:45:01.140 --> 01:45:02.320]
William H. Macy three.

[01:45:02.700 --> 01:45:03.920]
Joseph Cotton's got a pair.

[01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:07.000]
What?

[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:08.760]
Remember that?

[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.360]
100 page fax from Mark.

[01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:12.320]
Starts with a B from this movie.

[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:12.700]

[01:45:12.700 --> 01:45:13.300]
That I go away.

[01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:14.360]
Here it is again.

[01:45:14.520 --> 01:45:15.360]
He's sending it again.

[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:17.100]
Hey, Mark, we appreciate it very much.

[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:18.100]
But no, thank you.

[01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:18.700]
What was it about?

[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:21.780]
About the 70s movies and how great they were.

[01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:23.420]
Remember the tiny, tiny print.

[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:24.860]
You'll never read it.

[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:28.440]
Hey, Mark, we appreciate the sentiment very much.

[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.980]
But quit wasting our fax paper.

[01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:32.600]
Okay, it's a very limited budget show, especially on that end.

[01:45:33.140 --> 01:45:34.420]
You'll be pleased to know that I got three.

[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.660]
I have three new toner cartridges and a whole brand new case of fax paper.

[01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:40.020]
Just waiting for my use.

[01:45:40.100 --> 01:45:40.540]
How do you like that?

[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:43.580]
I got a much more efficient little radio station going here than QAIM.

[01:45:43.980 --> 01:45:44.340]
Guaranteed.

[01:45:44.740 --> 01:45:49.760]
Of course, I also don't have people coming in here like it all hours of morning noon and night when I'm out here stealing crap.

[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:54.560]
And did learn about the equipment again, which is why in this end everything is always the same.

[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:55.580]
It's great on that end.

[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:57.320]
It's like always screwed up.

[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.860]
Because absolutely nobody in that place.

[01:46:00.860 --> 01:46:05.620]
We got 85,000 people with titles, but nobody in charge.

[01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:07.880]
All chiefs, no Indians.

[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:08.640]
That's the problem.

[01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.220]
At QAIM.

[01:46:10.440 --> 01:46:11.280]
Well, that's one of the problems.

[01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:14.240]
Although I noticed that everybody seems to be mellowing out a little bit.

[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:15.280]
I hate this place.

[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:17.020]
Nothing works here.

[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:20.280]
My wrong about that is Moe Mel Rodelman since he got that broken.

[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.500]
A little bit.

[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.700]
Just a little teeny tiny bit.

[01:46:22.940 --> 01:46:24.320]
They actually be a little more civilized.

[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.000]
Although Zach, speaking of uncivilized, took a wild wicked nasty smell and dumping case anybody missed a bullet in this morning.

[01:46:30.540 --> 01:46:32.600]
That had George running out of their screaming and yelling.

[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:37.300]
And was does that rival the one that Fat Boy took that day that was like all over the walls in the ceiling?

[01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:39.200]
Yeah, they rivaled it.

[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:39.700]
No.

[01:46:41.140 --> 01:46:42.580]
Well, I see you wouldn't understand.

[01:46:42.840 --> 01:46:45.800]
Well, I mean, you would from experience from other people, but when you're fat, I mean,

[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:51.700]
there were those times in your life when you do things on that bowl that are just so unacceptable and so ungodly.

[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:56.580]
Just like that woman says about the turd in her car, you know, she says it was ungodly.

[01:46:57.480 --> 01:46:59.840]
But if the devil crawled up your ass and died or something like that.

[01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:01.160]
That was ungodly this morning.

[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:05.020]
Hey, Zach, people are talking about you, you fat tub.

[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.180]
Does he still lose no way to her?

[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:07.500]
Is he just doing another beast routine?

[01:47:07.700 --> 01:47:08.120]
Who the hell does?

[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:08.940]
Yeah.

[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.300]
And these people, by the way, I know people have seen me.

[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.680]
I'm fat, but trust me.

[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:17.500]
I'm not in the same category with the people we're talking about.

[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:26.020]
If you're going to make comments about fat people and your fat yourself, you better only be making comments about people that are really gigantic that make you look like Karen Carpenter.

[01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:28.940]
Oh, and you'll be pleased to know what's his name.

[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.980]
Looks like he had a couple of extra sandwiches, Jared Law.

[01:47:32.460 --> 01:47:33.440]
I'd hear it with Lido.

[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:37.880]
He didn't look as anorexic in American Psycho as he did in the other one.

[01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:43.240]
But he just didn't want to eat in too much in that, but we were eating too good.

[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.600]
Maybe if he would have come to mom's for dinner a few more times.

[01:47:46.640 --> 01:47:48.700]
They could have popped some wood pills together.

[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:52.880]
Clint Eastwood is a huge star, but always underrated.

[01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:59.180]
Sean and Hollywood, who usually has some clue is what we're talking about.

[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:00.740]
Sean is totally lost.

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:09.240]
Witnesses actual acting performances in the big-guile, play-misty, for me, Tatebrope, if in the line of fire and unforgiven.

[01:48:10.420 --> 01:48:12.420]
As opposed to his shoot him up, westerns.

[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.560]
Well, no.

[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:16.300]
I think you only wanted to kind of be a ward for unforgiven.

[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:20.540]
It says he was finally nominated for Best Actor at any rate.

[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.120]
The Clint Eastwood's a big, huge star.

[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:24.320]
Okay, what are we talking about here? Does he come close?

[01:48:24.460 --> 01:48:24.560]
No.

[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:25.940]
Sean, you're losing it, baby.

[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:29.120]
PS, after a cinema files are through milking the movie pools.

[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:31.220]
How about the suggestion for a future pool?

[01:48:31.640 --> 01:48:32.920]
You've already done the worst tear piece.

[01:48:33.020 --> 01:48:34.840]
Maybe you can do the bad-haired champion of the world.

[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.400]
Art Garfunkel, David Letterman, Gene Shallet, Donald Trump, Gene Hackman, Gene Wilder, and he left off Mo.

[01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:44.860]
See what I mean about Mo? They're starting to warm up your little bit.

[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.440]
Mo and I talk about it here. They're warming up to just a little tiny bit.

[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:48.360]
Not too much.

[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.360]
Brian Dennyhy.

[01:48:52.260 --> 01:48:52.640]
Okay.

[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:55.340]
Brian Dennyhy, he's, I can see him.

[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:59.040]
Yeah, he's a big guy. He's regular. That's the best I can say about it.

[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:01.160]
Yeah, he's a background actor.

[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:04.860]
No, no, I know who he is, but I'm trying to think of a movie he was in.

[01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:07.220]
They do.

[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:11.280]
Yeah, I can't see him.

[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:30.940]
You're a million of them.

[01:49:30.960 --> 01:49:31.000]
Yeah.

[01:49:32.460 --> 01:49:34.060]
1113, get him on there. Brian Dennyhy.

[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.280]
Okay. Let's see if we can spell it right. I doubt it.

[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:37.920]
You know, talk his teeth. It's easy to throw.

[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:43.840]
I'm a lot of really appealing low-sounding numbers, but when it comes right down to it, what can you really get refinanced at?

[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:49.780]
5%, maybe 4%, how about this? How about 2.45% with financial group?

[01:49:50.180 --> 01:49:54.700]
With interest rates of just 2.45%, it really is your best bet and it's rock solid too.

[01:50:06.220 --> 01:50:08.680]
And that's 2.45% financing with financial group.

[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:12.080]

Credit restrictions apply rates up to to change monthly. 5.34 APR.

[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:46.260]
My, my, and local. This is 43560. You weigh a few A.

[01:50:48.100 --> 01:50:50.420]
Can, whoops, and enter TAMMON station.

[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:57.820]
If you watch only one reality show this season, you'll want to watch the show where the kids finally get into the action.

[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:09.220]
Tonight on Fox. The premiere of Touched by an American Idol. Young boys from all over the country will compete for the affection and fortune of American icon, Michael Jackson.

[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:12.080]
That's the beautiful thing. Touched by an American Idol.

[01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:13.260]
What's it doing now?

[01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:15.280]
It's called growing and changing.

[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:20.920]
It's reality TV like no other. And you get to vote on who gets the sleep in Michael's bed.

[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:25.540]
I'm asleep. Touched by an American Idol Tuesday night at 10 on Fox.

[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:27.080]
What's wrong with sharing alone?

[01:51:27.260 --> 01:51:28.520]
But I don't want to share.

[01:51:29.140 --> 01:51:33.920]
It's pivoted to being pressed. Don't forget our Hot Couples contest officially is on right now.

[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:38.760]
And let's see, Thursday May 15th. This Thursday will be putting pictures up on the website.

[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:44.160]
So I guess Thursday will be the deadline Thursday at what, 9 a.m.?

[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:48.480]
Sure, for a less than an entry. Try not to wait that long, but I mean, if you have one, we'll take it.

[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:52.800]
Okay. Notice how he's just kind of like taken over here, Mr. Bushbloss.

[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:55.780]
Here's the engineer of our contest, Beener Boy.

[01:51:56.920 --> 01:52:00.220]
Thursday May 15th pictures will then go up on the web for voters to choose their favorites.

[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.820]
They'll be up there for a week. And on Thursday May 22nd, the couple with the most votes wins.

[01:52:04.100 --> 01:52:07.040]
And I've seen them all so far. And I think I might have an idea who might jump in and lead.

[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:12.940]
Now, yeah, we haven't received the picture of them together yet. Have we? No. Well,

[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:16.860]
and the contest will be running for three months.

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:19.160]
We got the one going on now. Then in June, we'll have one in June.

[01:52:19.820 --> 01:52:22.660]
If they want to show up, we'll take a picture of them together.

[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.420]
Oh, wait till I come back, but that's too late.

[01:52:27.780 --> 01:52:29.180]
Oh, man, Aaron.

[01:52:30.220 --> 01:52:35.040]
Anyway, three day tonight, the stay for two is the grand prize at the World Oasis Resort in Casino and in Bahamas,

[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:39.220]
including round trip airfare on Lake Array and the runner-up gets dinner for two at the pizza law.

[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:45.000]
Now, wouldn't that be something if it turned out? I mean, look, we have to verify.

[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.220]
We have to see them together. We have to see them as a couple.

[01:52:48.180 --> 01:52:52.960]
Right. Because quite frankly, anybody could take pictures out of a model magazine and like sentiment, you know,

[01:52:53.060 --> 01:52:55.580]
or they could take pictures of what's his name from the American,

[01:52:55.780 --> 01:52:59.220]
uh, uh, like a Christian, Christopher Bales.

[01:52:59.820 --> 01:53:03.600]
Christian. What I call Christopher. I call him hot.

[01:53:04.140 --> 01:53:07.020]
Christian Bales, American Psycho.

[01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:09.220]
That is, uh, really well worth seeing.

[01:53:09.340 --> 01:53:10.980]
You got a whole list. You better start working on it.

[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:12.980]
So are you going to put our movies on there now?

[01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:13.720]
Be an envoy?

[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:15.040]
They're on there.

[01:53:15.540 --> 01:53:16.520]
They're already on there.

[01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:17.260]
Well, they're getting there.

[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:19.460]
Well, the howke, how do you know?

[01:53:20.680 --> 01:53:21.220]
Because I was not.

[01:53:23.780 --> 01:53:24.780]
Requiem for a dream.

[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:26.200]
Happiness.

[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:30.100]
The game, which I can't believe George hasn't seen a game.

[01:53:30.100 --> 01:53:33.380]
Listen, you might, you might consider that to be better than the other ones.

[01:53:33.500 --> 01:53:34.360]
I might. Can't wait.

[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.340]
I'm telling you, it's right. It's right up there.

[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.840]
It's right up there with Requiem and with happiness.

[01:53:38.060 --> 01:53:39.140]
Hopefully I won't have to order that.

[01:53:39.180 --> 01:53:41.160]
I could actually go out and find that maybe somewhere.

[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:45.500]
California with a K was damn good.

[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:49.660]
American Psycho, which you also haven't seen.

[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:50.940]
This is my list. I'm giving you.

[01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.040]
Okay. Yeah.

[01:53:53.820 --> 01:53:54.740]
Let's see. Dave.

[01:53:55.580 --> 01:53:58.220]
Oh, says Eli Wallach was not in 12. I remember.

[01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:00.300]
One of my favorites was in a million movies.

[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:02.300]
Never. Oh, yes. Excellent choice.

[01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:04.720]
In fact, he's a one of the mobets, Jack Warden.

[01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:07.220]
Oh, hello, Warden. Oh, Jack. Jack Warden.

[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:08.960]
Right?

[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:11.120]
All right. Jack Warden was great.

[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:13.600]
He was, I think he's in every movie that's ever been made.

[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:15.220]
You must have out.

[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:18.900]
And he was also the judge in justice for all.

[01:54:21.180 --> 01:54:23.160]
Never when he was sitting on the toilet with a shotgun.

[01:54:23.160 --> 01:54:24.900]
It was right and down.

[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.140]
He was so great in that movie.

[01:54:27.140 --> 01:54:29.040]
He was just again. See, that's a good example.

[01:54:29.260 --> 01:54:31.720]
Unsung. Al Pacino would get all the credit for being in that movie.

[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.580]
He was great, but but Jack Warden was almost as good.

[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.760]
He was the unsung hero. That's what we're looking for today.

[01:54:39.140 --> 01:54:42.080]
Here's Rich Pacti, who says Sterling Hayden was also in the long goodbye.

[01:54:42.080 --> 01:54:44.040]
One of the greatest most underrated movies ever.

[01:54:44.700 --> 01:54:46.200]
And he nominates William Hurd.

[01:54:47.660 --> 01:54:49.840]
Isn't William Hurd like a little above this category?

[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:51.120]
I would think so.

[01:54:51.540 --> 01:54:51.880]
Yeah.

[01:54:52.840 --> 01:54:55.240]
And he says PS Fargo still blows.

[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:57.760]
You're a hard ass, Rich.

[01:54:59.300 --> 01:55:00.120]
He hates it.

[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:02.680]
Well, maybe it's for two of this for you that I can't find it.

[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:07.580]
I mean, there's a spot for it in both of the stores right by my DVDs, but it's like sold out.

[01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.240]
So somebody must have liked it.

[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:12.420]
Now, is there a spot for happiness in the stores you're going in?

[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:13.520]
No.

[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.580]
In other words, there's not even like a little bin with the name on it.

[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:23.380]
Right. Well, no, the two places that supposedly had it didn't have it then.

[01:55:23.380 --> 01:55:26.220]
Like because of you, somebody went and bought it ahead of me.

[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:26.880]
And the only thing that's...

[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:27.920]
Okay. Well, I'm only asking this.

[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:31.960]
If all these people are running around buying these movies that I'm talking about, like happiness,

[01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:35.520]
other than the one lady who I had the feeling she saw a long before I ever saw it,

[01:55:36.340 --> 01:55:37.500]
where were the comments?

[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:38.320]
Where are the calls?

[01:55:38.540 --> 01:55:40.040]
Where are good, bad, indifferent?

[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:44.360]
Where's the calls about Tom Jikas, great award winning performance on the Ahead Campland Show Friday night,

[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:45.700]
and the spy reports, huh?

[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.500]
Like everybody else, they must have bailed out of town.

[01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.620]
That's what's going on.

[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:51.600]
Well, Christian Bales.

[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.760]
Christian Bales and Neil Labs.

[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:01.180]
When you see that movie, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about, especially in a very beginning.

[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:02.700]
There's a scene where he's in the shower naked.

[01:56:04.780 --> 01:56:06.680]
And he's like, read, I mean, talk about vanity.

[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:11.180]
He's got all these different potions and creams and he puts on the mask like a woman, you know?

[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:12.040]
Yeah.

[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:16.260]
And that's the thing, all these CE guys at this Wall Street firmware,

[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.160]
which we never really understand what the business is, right, Peter?

[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:20.520]
Right.

[01:56:21.060 --> 01:56:22.340]
It's some kind of a Wall Street firmware.

[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:25.200]
It doesn't really make any difference because it seems like what they do most of the day

[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.120]
besides booking reservations for lunch and dinner,

[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:29.120]
is they compare each other's business cards.

[01:56:29.240 --> 01:56:30.620]
Other than that, we have no idea what they do.

[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:31.740]
Right. They trick to make it generic.

[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:32.800]
Yeah.

[01:56:35.500 --> 01:56:38.520]
And even if they're not hungry, they don't really care about what meal.

[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:41.760]
As long as they got a reservation and some fancy exclusive restaurant, that's all I can.

[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:43.320]
It's damn good. You like it.

[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.860]
Now, this article by Bernie Sanders.

[01:56:45.860 --> 01:56:49.920]
Didn't we have this on our website several days ago, pulling FBI's knows how to your books about the PP&A?

[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:52.680]
I'm sure we did.

[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.600]
I don't remember that title, maybe it was under another title.

[01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:57.500]
You asked Representative Bernie Sanders represents Ramadas and independent.

[01:56:57.500 --> 01:57:00.540]
He's talking about the Patri&A, and about how, speaking of what we're discussing here today,

[01:57:00.680 --> 01:57:03.460]
what books you buy in a bookstore or in the library, what you books you rent,

[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.440]
and what movies you buy in a music store,

[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:09.340]
because under the Patri&A, the FBI's got the authority to obtain bank records, credit records,

[01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:13.020]
and certain other commercial records only upon showing that the records requested,

[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:15.560]
related to a suspected member of a terrorist group,

[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.680]
that had at least until the Patri&A.

[01:57:17.700 --> 01:57:19.840]
Now they can do whatever they want.

[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:25.400]
We had one about protecting the librarians, because librarians were going to start getting their government employees,

[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.580]
but that was with the Broward story.

[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:29.120]
Now, but this goes back about a week.

[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:33.520]
We had it. Trust me. Trust me. I just don't want to look rehash.

[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:36.520]
Jack Warden underrated second choice, Eddie Albert.

[01:57:36.760 --> 01:57:39.040]
Oh, Eddie Albert.

[01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:40.460]
So corny.

[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:44.820]
Movie to see used cars with Jack Warden.

[01:57:44.820 --> 01:57:46.380]
See, I told you he's in just about every movie.

[01:57:48.380 --> 01:57:49.740]
Used cars, ringing the bells.

[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:50.660]
Oh, yeah, I saw it.

[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:57.600]
And it's an old comedy, like 70s comedy, with Kurt Russell, I think.

[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:58.220]
You might not know.

[01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.600]
Kurt Russell.

[01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.040]
Yeah.

[01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:03.580]
Not a big Kurt Russell fan.

[01:58:03.880 --> 01:58:06.960]
I thought it was funny at the time, but then I was a small, small child when I saw it.

[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:10.380]
And they had a queen's logic is in on the independent film channel right now.

[01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.860]
The wedding of an old friend is the catalyst for reunion of New York City pals with Kevin.

[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:15.740]
Ah, there's one for my list, Kevin Bacon.

[01:58:17.320 --> 01:58:18.300]
Right? Right.

[01:58:18.840 --> 01:58:20.060]
You don't think so? I agree.

[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.760]
I think Kevin Bacon is great.

[01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:26.740]
Mm-hmm. And for his own any movie that Jack Warden is in, Kevin Warden's in it.

[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:27.760]
Kevin Bacon.

[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:30.640]
How many movies does he make a year?

[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.560]
About third man.

[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.220]
He's in a lot of movies. I'll say that.

[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.020]
But he's damn good underrated.

[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.380]
Never a star, never like a superstar.

[01:58:37.580 --> 01:58:39.020]
He was also in JFK.

[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:39.920]
Right.

[01:58:41.620 --> 01:58:43.160]
That was a bad acting job.

[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:43.920]
I got to see there.

[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:45.160]
To me, there's nothing worse.

[01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:47.280]
In fact, you know, even in California.

[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.080]
And maybe I'm the pickin' but Brad Pitt, the redneck Yahoo.

[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.280]
I mean, he made the gurgling sounds real good, you know.

[01:58:54.600 --> 01:58:57.900]
But that rednecky Yahoo voice, it just, I don't know, a fake and affected.

[01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:00.360]
What was the movie he played where he died as her blonde?

[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:02.360]
Diet.

[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:10.440]
And he played like some northern, some Nordic ice fisherman skiing.

[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.600]
I don't know what I'm talking about.

[01:59:12.840 --> 01:59:13.000]
I do.

[01:59:13.100 --> 01:59:13.980]
Huh? I don't know.

[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:15.960]
Horrible bad accent.

[01:59:16.540 --> 01:59:19.440]
And there's nothing worse than guys who do bad accents

[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.540]
and they do the entire movie with a bad accent.

[01:59:21.900 --> 01:59:22.980]
But that was early.

[01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.400]
As opposed to guys who are like Jude Law.

[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000]
Who I didn't realize until I saw an interview with him.

[01:59:28.780 --> 01:59:29.460]
Who's British?

[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:29.920]
Right.

[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.940]
And if you see the movie, the talent that Mr. Ripley, which you won't watch, because it's a Fag movie.

[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:37.920]
But if you see that, he just, the whole British accent just evaporates its gun.

[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:39.260]
There's not one trace of it in that movie.

[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:39.780]
It's gone.

[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:44.180]
And in what's the movie we just saw with Jude Law, the other that I watched?

[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:45.800]
Gatica.

[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:46.800]
Gatica.

[01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:47.440]
That was good.

[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:48.840]
With Ethan Nahok.

[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:53.220]
And there he's back to the bread accent again because he's supposed to play that character.

[01:59:53.580 --> 01:59:53.760]
Okay.

[01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:56.600]
You might put Gatica on my list too of movies and also the game.

[01:59:56.600 --> 01:59:56.680]
The game.

[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:00.200]
When you see the game, are you getting the game also?

[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.220]
I didn't order it.

[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:03.200]
I had already ordered a shot.

[02:00:03.260 --> 02:00:04.660]
But I'm sure I can find it in town.

[02:00:05.480 --> 02:00:06.740]
What makes you so sure that?

[02:00:06.960 --> 02:00:07.660]
Have we talked about it?

[02:00:08.440 --> 02:00:09.240]
Nothing, I guess.

[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:11.440]
One of the best movies of all time.

[02:00:11.580 --> 02:00:12.900]
Michael Douglas in the game.

[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:15.800]
And it goes on.

[02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:16.580]
And Sean Pennison.

[02:00:16.760 --> 02:00:17.260]
And he's okay.

[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:19.940]
His role is, you know, he's got kind of a relatively minor role.

[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:21.040]
He's usually good.

[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:21.720]
He's always good.

[02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:22.700]
He was good in this.

[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:24.880]
Love it.

[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:27.020]
Even though, of course, he's a comic, comic, pinko bastard.

[02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:29.260]
Love it 27 at 560 WDQM D.

[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:36.700]
Liza Weissbokey or Superstore for the Actions Diet or any of the low-carb sugar free diet is introducing their new Amman snack cakes by control carb.

[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:39.080]
They come in blueberry, banana or classic almond.

[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:44.360]
Each serving is only one effect of gram of carbs or sample the light's new chocolate raspberry muffin with only one gram of carbs.

[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:48.500]
And if you like to crunch, try one of their three new flavors of low-carb racquet chips.

[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:56.680]
So whether it's the carbolite ice cream, the breads, rolls, cheesecakes, chocolates, pasta and sauces, and they do have some of the best low-carb sauces you'll find on the planet.

[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.920]
Or any of them are 600 low-carb products.

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:02.040]
You like to Weissbokey's a store that you're going to love because it's entirely for you.

[02:01:02.140 --> 02:01:05.220]
There is nothing in that store that isn't low-carb and or sugar free.

[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:08.920]
And one of the good things about shopping at Delights is you can always try it before you buy it.

[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:13.140]
There's staff knows low-carb dieting inside and out there open every day, seven days a week from 10 to 10.

[02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:15.700]
And they carry the most complete line of Actions products in the world.

[02:01:15.700 --> 02:01:22.840]
Another great thing about it, maybe the best is that Actions products are always 25% off the regular price all day, every day at your lights.

[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:28.200]
The Actions diet is rated at the top, so head for the number one low-carb sugar free store in the world, the lights of Weissbokey.

[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:32.560]
And you'll find them on the northeast corner of Glades Road and 441 right next door to Boston Market.

[02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:35.720]
Or call them toll free at 1-877 Low Carb.

[02:01:35.800 --> 02:01:37.640]
Find them on the web if you like it lowcarb.com.

[02:01:38.100 --> 02:01:42.240]
Don't forget it, there's only one the lights of Weissbokey and it's your official Actions retail sales.

[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:48.220]
You'll find sixty cents in a way, you way.

[02:01:50.140 --> 02:01:51.660]
You fudge back them?

[02:01:52.220 --> 02:01:53.120]
Oh, Sarah.

[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:53.980]
Oh, Jim.

[02:01:55.140 --> 02:01:55.700]
Sarah.

[02:01:56.400 --> 02:01:56.820]
Sarah.

[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:57.220]
Hmm?

[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.680]
Shouldn't we be using... you know.

[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.200]
Oh, don't worry. I'm using the new sponge.

[02:02:02.740 --> 02:02:02.960]
Oh?

[02:02:03.320 --> 02:02:03.580]
Hmm.

[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.120]
Hi, guys.

[02:02:06.900 --> 02:02:08.340]
I just love you.

[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.340]
Get together.

[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:10.420]
Don't you?

[02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:11.440]
Who's this?

[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:12.700]
Um, Jim.

[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:14.640]
This is Bob.

[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:16.340]
Nice to meet you, Jim.

[02:02:16.780 --> 02:02:18.980]
Hey, I got a great idea.

[02:02:19.380 --> 02:02:20.660]
Let's play a game.

[02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:22.780]
Look, you're interrupting something here.

[02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:23.200]
Nothing.

[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:29.000]
The new contraceptive sponge bomb, shown to be 95% effective as a method of birth control.

[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:32.020]
Consult your doctor to see if sponge bomb is right for you.

[02:02:32.300 --> 02:02:34.420]
Well, time to get back to work.

[02:02:34.860 --> 02:02:35.620]
Open wide.

[02:02:37.720 --> 02:02:40.100]
You, gosh, it's dark in here.

[02:02:40.460 --> 02:02:41.020]
Bob.

[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:42.460]
Bob!

[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:42.720]
Bob!

[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:45.260]
1131 at 560.

[02:02:45.380 --> 02:02:48.960]
WDQ have the mad dog of one, Hank from Shula's take two at three o'clock.

[02:02:49.180 --> 02:02:50.080]
After that, you don't want to know.

[02:02:51.660 --> 02:02:53.000]
Here's a call from Delray Beach.

[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:53.260]
Hello.

[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:54.900]
Hi, Neil.

[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:55.740]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:57.480]
Hey, I love your show.

[02:02:57.640 --> 02:02:58.380]
It's a real food today.

[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:00.100]
Uh, listen, though.

[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:03.760]
I, you know, Christopher Walken is going to win this thing,

[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:05.160]
but I don't think he belongs.

[02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:09.320]
I mean, he's, uh, he's, uh, really a claimed actor.

[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.940]
He's been in seven million movies.

[02:03:10.940 --> 02:03:13.360]
But anyway, the guy I think should win.

[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.100]
Well, wait, wait a minute.

[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:14.800]
Hang on a second.

[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:15.580]
I'm looking at the list.

[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:17.660]
I thought we took Harvey Cytel off of their boys.

[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:19.000]
No, that's what I thought.

[02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:19.580]
Christopher Walken.

[02:03:20.100 --> 02:03:21.160]
No, I understand.

[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.400]
He's leading, but I'm just looking at the results so far.

[02:03:23.840 --> 02:03:25.920]
Harvey Cytel, I'm sure we took off the list and somewhere,

[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:28.480]
a beaner boy missed in the communication and the lettuce done.

[02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:29.500]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:35.460]
Well, anyway, my pick is, I thought Frank Davish in the bit on your list

[02:03:35.460 --> 02:03:38.200]
a couple of weeks ago, I thought he was a huge acclaimed star,

[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:38.860]
but he won.

[02:03:39.180 --> 02:03:42.200]
Anyway, uh, uh, De Maille, I don't agree with you.

[02:03:42.300 --> 02:03:44.100]
Frank Zappel was not a big commercial star.

[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:45.100]
I don't, I don't agree with that.

[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.960]
Frank Zappel was more like a cult figure.

[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:48.860]
Uh, uh, all right.

[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:50.000]
It's your show.

[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:52.660]
Anyway, divine.

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:56.960]
The great actor from all the John Waters movies is one of my,

[02:03:57.020 --> 02:03:59.620]
uh, all-time favorite underrated actors.

[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:00.940]
I think he'll be on the list.

[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:02.240]
It's on it right now.

[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:04.080]
Anybody, love your show.

[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:05.020]
FMO.

[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:06.180]
Have a great one.

[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:07.240]
Thanks a lot, Pellie.

[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.880]
Got to vine on there now.

[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:09.440]
We got it.

[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:11.060]
And let's get Harvey Kai tell off of there.

[02:04:11.060 --> 02:04:12.500]
Now, what do you think about Christopher Walken?

[02:04:12.540 --> 02:04:13.360]
He does make a point.

[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:15.520]
Well, while we're taking names off.

[02:04:16.680 --> 02:04:17.920]
You want to take him off of there too?

[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:18.120]

[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:18.780]
He's huge.

[02:04:18.880 --> 02:04:20.320]
I like him a lot, but, uh, you know, yeah.

[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:21.640]
Let's get those top two off of there.

[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:24.140]
Okay, let's make this, uh, let's level the playing field.

[02:04:24.320 --> 02:04:24.540]
Okay.

[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.860]
In fact, I tell you, I got a good idea.

[02:04:27.060 --> 02:04:28.600]
What we'll do every day when we take the pool.

[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:30.500]
We'll keep our eye on who's, who's in frame.

[02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.580]
We'll just keep taking it.

[02:04:31.740 --> 02:04:32.800]
Okay, there you go.

[02:04:33.540 --> 02:04:36.080]
We'll take you to the show and deconstruct it afterwards.

[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:36.460]
Yeah.

[02:04:37.180 --> 02:04:39.460]
Brad says, I don't understand you're not a big soprano's fan,

[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:42.180]
but I found it interesting that Steve Buscemi directed one of the more

[02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:44.380]
acclaimed episodes, The Pine Barons.

[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.320]
Forget about it.

[02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:47.380]
Does that say something about his talents?

[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.360]
And that was a very good episode.

[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:52.540]
So Steve Buscemi just moved into first place by default,

[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:53.640]
because he's got 16 votes.

[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.120]
And the other two are coming off there as soon as Eric gets around to it.

[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.220]
I think being a boy is screwing with Eric's mind now, you know?

[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.560]
Alex in Curl Gable says, I know you have the big bucks,

[02:05:05.720 --> 02:05:06.800]
but I think you're going crazy,

[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:09.160]
applying all these DVD movies to watch them.

[02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:10.840]
Have you or George ever heard of Netflix,

[02:05:11.320 --> 02:05:13.240]
.comments, and online DVD rental plays?

[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:15.060]
They have different membership fees,

[02:05:15.180 --> 02:05:16.440]
but me and my brother have the membership,

[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:18.920]
or for 20 bucks a month, you can rent as many DVDs as you want,

[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:20.940]
never having out more than four to time.

[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:24.260]
What happens is they mail them out to you,

[02:05:24.380 --> 02:05:26.780]
watch them and put them back in the sleeve and send them back,

[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:28.540]
postages, prepaid both ways.

[02:05:28.540 --> 02:05:30.300]
And you can have the movie out as long as you want.

[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:31.100]
There's no time limit.

[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:33.540]
Of course, since you can have only four movies out of it,

[02:05:33.540 --> 02:05:34.860]
you can watch one, send it back,

[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:35.960]
while you watch the other ones,

[02:05:35.980 --> 02:05:37.520]
they're receiving it and sending you out your next rental.

[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:40.120]
There are sometimes a long wait for new releases,

[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:42.160]
but since you're watching mostly movies that aren't too new,

[02:05:42.300 --> 02:05:42.860]
you should have no problem.

[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:43.920]
So Alex in the Gables,

[02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:45.660]
were there something for a schlepper like you, George?

[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:49.620]
Well, the package is in packages of advertisements from them.

[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:54.300]
And I looked into it and I decided I'm not going to stick nothing in the mail.

[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.580]
Yeah, I'll send these things.

[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:57.320]
You know what that's like?

[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:59.120]
That's like, you know, money back your rentes,

[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:00.880]
because they know that nobody's going to mail anything back.

[02:06:01.700 --> 02:06:03.680]
But evidently, Alex and his brother are like, you know,

[02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:04.180]
they're desperate.

[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:05.540]
Oh, they're borrow a friend's copy.

[02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:07.200]
Or maybe they live near the poster office.

[02:06:08.220 --> 02:06:09.240]
What about James Woods?

[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.480]
I don't think James Woods is in this category.

[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:11.920]
Do you?

[02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:12.620]
He's a big actor.

[02:06:12.760 --> 02:06:12.900]
Right.

[02:06:13.620 --> 02:06:15.580]
And Louis Gossett Jr.?

[02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:21.280]
I don't think it's the...

[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:21.360]
Huh?

[02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:23.140]
There's nothing to do with how big of an actor he is.

[02:06:24.220 --> 02:06:25.080]
What does he have to do?

[02:06:25.080 --> 02:06:25.680]
He was underrated.

[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:26.620]
No.

[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:27.260]
No.

[02:06:28.020 --> 02:06:28.480]
No.

[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:29.380]
I'll tell you who is.

[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.060]
And he was in seven.

[02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:36.700]
Speaking of black actors.

[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:38.180]
Is he too big?

[02:06:39.640 --> 02:06:40.100]
No.

[02:06:40.880 --> 02:06:41.580]
What's his name?

[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:42.240]
Morgan Freeman.

[02:06:42.500 --> 02:06:43.040]
Morgan Freeman.

[02:06:43.520 --> 02:06:44.240]
He's too big.

[02:06:44.700 --> 02:06:45.140]
He's too big.

[02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:46.360]
And he's not underrated.

[02:06:46.500 --> 02:06:47.460]
He's rated very highly.

[02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:48.060]
Yeah, I agree.

[02:06:49.280 --> 02:06:50.380]
Doesn't fit into our category.

[02:06:50.380 --> 02:06:51.960]
Everybody knows Morgan Freeman's a great actor.

[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:55.040]
Who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time?

[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:56.580]
I'll take it.

[02:06:56.600 --> 02:06:58.140]
This independent film show has got me hooked.

[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.200]
You got to be careful when you watch that channel, though.

[02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:01.980]
Oh, I know.

[02:07:02.580 --> 02:07:03.260]
Well, that's okay.

[02:07:03.360 --> 02:07:04.660]
We can all press the button at the same time.

[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:06.340]
No, not that.

[02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:07.540]
That's what I was talking about.

[02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.900]
The IFC is also where all the sued movies live.

[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:12.140]
Yeah.

[02:07:13.260 --> 02:07:14.660]
So it's good and bad.

[02:07:14.700 --> 02:07:15.580]
Backing movies too.

[02:07:15.580 --> 02:07:18.240]
There was one over the weekend, which I can't think of what the name of it was.

[02:07:19.320 --> 02:07:20.180]
We're this guy.

[02:07:20.420 --> 02:07:22.960]
These two guys who were buddies as the kids.

[02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:27.340]
And years go by and what is like a real fruit fly.

[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:31.200]
And he goes back and kind of like chases his old buddy down.

[02:07:31.800 --> 02:07:35.420]
And they eventually wind up doing the deed in the motel just to try to get rid of him.

[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:36.920]
What the hell was the name of that thing?

[02:07:37.240 --> 02:07:37.900]
Very strange.

[02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:40.260]
You don't know what I'm talking about.

[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.700]
No, I'll think of it.

[02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:43.540]
Well, you know, it goes.

[02:07:43.700 --> 02:07:45.340]
It's in line with that artsy farce thing.

[02:07:45.460 --> 02:07:48.060]
It's always like a lot of gay stuff and it connects with any artsy farce.

[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:51.920]
But it can't be all like real straight like Rocky Horror Picture Show.

[02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:54.820]
Here's a lady in Hollywood.

[02:07:55.060 --> 02:07:55.180]
Hello.

[02:07:55.700 --> 02:08:00.880]
Well, now I'm nervous because the person I wanted to tell you is never the leading man.

[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.660]
But he's in a lot of movies and you may think he's too big.

[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:04.420]
No, we'll see.

[02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:05.660]
Ed Harris.

[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:10.600]
Now, he's never leading man.

[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:11.260]
He's making.

[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:14.260]
I think he's an awesome actor.

[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:18.700]
And then I know some people who know him personally say he's a great guy on top of it.

[02:08:18.700 --> 02:08:20.740]
But he never gets that starring role.

[02:08:20.860 --> 02:08:25.880]
But he's always, you know, the best supporting in anything he's in.

[02:08:26.420 --> 02:08:29.920]
Okay. Well, I'm putting them down just because George Joe was doing his film right there.

[02:08:30.640 --> 02:08:31.340]
Oh, okay.

[02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:33.120]
You got it. Thanks.

[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:34.080]
Thanks, Neil.

[02:08:34.420 --> 02:08:34.680]
Bye-bye.

[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:35.900]
Well, why not?

[02:08:36.020 --> 02:08:36.960]
Ed Harris belongs on list.

[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:38.060]
Oh, he's a great actor.

[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:39.200]
He's in Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:39.900]
Doing a great job.

[02:08:39.900 --> 02:08:40.300]
There you go.

[02:08:41.180 --> 02:08:42.360]
He wasn't in the game, though.

[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:46.200]
I still can't believe you haven't seen the game or Murkin's psycho.

[02:08:46.200 --> 02:08:50.400]
I feel like all of a sudden I've, I have raced past you like you're standing still.

[02:08:50.540 --> 02:08:54.160]
And the reason for that being, of course, that I have much better video stores than you do.

[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:57.880]
Right. And you were, I'm HMV and I'm also like in a real city that was the world.

[02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:58.060]

[02:08:58.060 --> 02:08:58.880]
You're Canadian cable.

[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.620]
You're satellite rather.

[02:09:00.780 --> 02:09:01.000]
Right.

[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:02.320]
My digital satellite.

[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:02.620]
Uh-huh.

[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:04.080]
I mean, my digital cable.

[02:09:04.080 --> 02:09:04.540]
Whatever it is.

[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:09.000]
My Rogers digital cable.

[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:12.300]
Steve Bushimmi's got 18 at O'Neal 13.

[02:09:12.980 --> 02:09:14.020]
Gary Oldman's got 12.

[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:15.360]
Lee J. Cobb 10.

[02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:18.360]
The most underrated movie actor actress of all time.

[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:21.940]
William H. James Gerner, HF Bridges 5.

[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:23.000]
Carl Maldon 5.

[02:09:24.020 --> 02:09:24.840]
Terence Stamp 4.

[02:09:25.020 --> 02:09:25.940]
Sterling Hayden 3.

[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.120]
James Spader 3.

[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:28.440]
Laura, see how do you like that?

[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:28.800]
See you there.

[02:09:28.860 --> 02:09:29.820]
Why James Spader on there?

[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:34.080]
You will allow your personal feelings just like I do like with Bruce Willis.

[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:35.940]
I can't stand him or John Revolta.

[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:38.760]
Oh, you know what they call a quarter pound of wood cheese in France?

[02:09:39.160 --> 02:09:39.400]
Gee.

[02:09:39.820 --> 02:09:40.960]
A royal wood cheese.

[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:41.740]
You know,

[02:09:43.180 --> 02:09:45.940]
that's also going to be on independent film channel this week, Pulp Fishing.

[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:46.200]

[02:09:47.480 --> 02:09:48.720]
And it keeps showing that that scene.

[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:50.700]
That's the clip they keep showing where Tural is doing.

[02:09:50.980 --> 02:09:56.180]
At least they're not showing a one about the French fries with the mayonnaise, which we've all seen at clip 80 billion times too many.

[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.380]
A quarter pound of wood cheese.

[02:09:59.220 --> 02:10:00.180]
I'm thinking of myself.

[02:10:00.340 --> 02:10:00.500]
What?

[02:10:00.920 --> 02:10:02.640]
Well, you know something that's even warning though, okay?

[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:10.320]
If you like, return this violence mindless, absolutely meaningless artsy-fartsy crap, then Pulp Fishing is perfect for you.

[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.940]
And I realize I'm not supposed to say that, you know.

[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:13.960]
Right?

[02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:14.880]
And they didn't like that.

[02:10:14.880 --> 02:10:15.440]
They'll say that.

[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:16.620]
Okay, didn't say that.

[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.460]
I love that movie.

[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:19.260]
In fact, you know what they call a royal wood cheese?

[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:21.140]
Quarter pounder with the frat-frogs.

[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:23.440]
Frogs like...

[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:25.220]
It's just so stupid.

[02:10:25.360 --> 02:10:26.340]
And like I said, just a bunch.

[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:29.120]
In fact, I see like in that movie a lot of like bully.

[02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:30.600]
All of bully was a true story of it.

[02:10:30.780 --> 02:10:33.540]
But it was just a gratuitously violent piece of crap.

[02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.360]
And not just a murder part, but just the whole thing.

[02:10:37.340 --> 02:10:40.380]
The whole damn thing was just violent from beginning to end.

[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:47.400]
In fact, what other movie was there when he like just shows the woman down on the bed, just slams her down.

[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:49.360]
One of these... I can't keep him straight anymore.

[02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:52.040]
And I thought to myself, what...

[02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:54.240]
That was just totally out of context for the movie.

[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:55.460]
Just slams her down.

[02:10:55.580 --> 02:10:56.760]
Like, bam, you know.

[02:10:57.620 --> 02:10:57.940]
How's it like?

[02:10:58.060 --> 02:10:58.340]
Bam, bam.

[02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:00.540]
I don't kind of stuff you like.

[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.740]
56670560.560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:11:06.260 --> 02:11:07.380]
Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:09.120]
Hello. How you doing, Neil?

[02:11:09.420 --> 02:11:09.620]
Great.

[02:11:10.300 --> 02:11:12.280]
All right. Was it actors and actresses?

[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:12.720]
Right.

[02:11:13.620 --> 02:11:15.320]
How about the chlorosleech?

[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.140]
She's been in 10 million in one film.

[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.020]
Okay.

[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:19.020]
And never a headliner.

[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:24.300]
Also, Peter Boyle, even though he's on TV now, he did a lot of good stuff before.

[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:25.720]
And he never got the acclaim.

[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:28.060]
Even with young Frankenstein.

[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:29.580]
Okay.

[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:31.860]
And one other.

[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:33.380]
How about Dennis Hopper? He's too big.

[02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:34.000]
Too big.

[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:35.260]
All right.

[02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:36.760]
And I got an idea for another one.

[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.300]
For Paul Fee, for another time.

[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:44.020]
Lines from movies that pretty much weed their way into the American fabric.

[02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:45.080]
That's a good one.

[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.240]
You know, like...

[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:51.480]
Because I was watching the apocalypse Redux yesterday.

[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:53.280]
Smelling the palm in the morning.

[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:55.280]
They didn't offer a camp refuse.

[02:11:57.140 --> 02:11:58.460]
I'm trying to get out of here.

[02:11:59.700 --> 02:12:01.620]
And you got the Madness L.I.

[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.680]
Go ahead and take it anymore.

[02:12:02.820 --> 02:12:04.260]
Well, don't give them all out now.

[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:06.060]
There's no one having any calls on the poor.

[02:12:06.920 --> 02:12:11.740]
Yeah, but you could just figure out which ones and you could change it around as to, you know, whatever...

[02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:12.360]
...where you want it.

[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:13.020]
But...

[02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:13.840]
I was just laughing.

[02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:14.880]
I was laughing.

[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:15.260]
I was laughing.

[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:15.580]
I was laughing.

[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:15.680]

[02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:18.500]
Could he usually get out of him?

[02:12:18.540 --> 02:12:19.960]
4 or 5 to start her off?

[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:21.400]
And then people could come up with her right.

[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.600]
That's a good idea.

[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:24.080]
That could be the most important thing to do.

[02:12:24.080 --> 02:12:25.560]
You might have a great day.

[02:12:25.660 --> 02:12:25.900]
Thanks.

[02:12:28.120 --> 02:12:29.140]
Did he hear what I said?

[02:12:29.780 --> 02:12:29.880]
Nope.

[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:32.940]
That's a good suggestion, though.

[02:12:33.020 --> 02:12:33.420]
Don't you think?

[02:12:33.700 --> 02:12:34.700]
Have we done something like that?

[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:36.280]
We did.

[02:12:36.500 --> 02:12:37.160]
I'm sure we did.

[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:39.940]
The most memorable line from any movie?

[02:12:40.240 --> 02:12:40.920]
I don't think so.

[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:41.740]
I think we're the government.

[02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:43.720]
There's no way we did.

[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:47.520]
There could be like 7,000 of those in here.

[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:47.980]
I know that.

[02:12:48.260 --> 02:12:49.380]
Maybe we did it while you were on vacation.

[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:51.160]
Maybe you'd done it.

[02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:52.080]
And of course, if you...

[02:12:52.080 --> 02:12:52.920]
How about...

[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:54.040]
I want to make them an offering.

[02:12:54.500 --> 02:12:55.280]
How about that?

[02:12:56.200 --> 02:12:57.000]
We did this.

[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:57.600]
We did this.

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:58.560]
You did it.

[02:12:58.820 --> 02:12:59.100]
I guess.

[02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:00.360]
I didn't do it.

[02:13:00.780 --> 02:13:02.300]
Because we had dirty, hairy ones.

[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:02.780]
But justice.

[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:05.740]
We must go to the poor youngy.

[02:13:07.100 --> 02:13:09.640]
There's so many just from the three Godfathers, right?

[02:13:10.740 --> 02:13:13.740]
Whatever I ever done to make you treat me service was big.

[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.600]
The big your bloody brains will over your nice thyme leaks soon.

[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:17.320]
That's my favorite.

[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:19.660]
The big your bloody brains will over your nice thyme leaks soon.

[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:20.880]
How about James Khan?

[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:21.700]
He's too big.

[02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:22.640]
Oh yeah.

[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:23.380]
Huh?

[02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:23.780]
Huge.

[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:25.840]
He's jagged and he's big.

[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:26.820]
But he just...

[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:29.500]
You know, it's sad that he also doesn't get the credit for being...

[02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:30.820]
He's not like in that top rung.

[02:13:31.100 --> 02:13:34.380]
He's between the very top rung and the rung that we're talking about today, you know?

[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:34.700]

[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:36.880]
He's in between the two top rungs on the letter.

[02:13:38.300 --> 02:13:39.340]
Which is sad.

[02:13:39.620 --> 02:13:41.580]
Maybe that's why Kathy Fates broke his kneecap.

[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.120]
Fightin' the local.

[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:45.060]
This is five-sixth year.

[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:46.460]
The radio's all yours.

[02:13:48.100 --> 02:13:48.540]
Pewin!

[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:49.080]

[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:51.820]
Bij won't, Iosabe!

[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:55.360]
Our cause is just

[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:57.480]
and our mission is clear

[02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:00.820]
to disarm the wrath of weapons of mass destruction.

[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:03.680]
To end Saddam Hussein's supporter terrorism

[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:05.880]
and to freed the Iraqi people.

[02:14:05.880 --> 02:14:10.420]
All the t Wolfsy it's, valleyinya gonna have land, bleedingu

[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:19.660]
And you'll be in Idaho and you'll all be inоля

[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:26.080]
And you'll be inамаζbourne

[02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:28.960]
and you'll stand chall way

[02:14:32.940 --> 02:14:33.640]
And you will in wilderness

[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:33.640]

[02:14:33.640 --> 02:14:33.820]
time?

[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:35.860]
And you go to your proportional

[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:40.860]
and equipment in civilian areas attempting to use innocent men, women and children as

[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:42.680]
shields for the dictator's army.

[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:48.760]
The one Americans in all the world know that coalition forces will make every effort to

[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:51.060]
spare innocent civilians for part.

[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:56.340]
All the things is bad, all the things is bad, now we move ahead, now we move ahead, now we move ahead,

[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:01.680]
all the things is bad, all the things is bad, now we move ahead, now we move ahead, now we move ahead,

[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:10.540]
it's a job that's done, it's a job that's done.

[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:16.140]
It is a fight for the security of our nation and the peace of the world.

[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:18.540]
But whom would you look at?

[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:21.060]
We will accept no outcomes, but victory.

[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.380]
14, what is it?

[02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:25.320]
13 to the moon at 560 W.M.

[02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:28.380]
We sure got some good stuff going on over now and Baghdad, no way.

[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:32.660]
Yeah, that live coverage on about K. Austin, Cala.

[02:15:32.680 --> 02:15:33.140]
I beg your pardon?

[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:35.480]
That live coverage that you wanted to see, how's that coming?

[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:39.240]
Always a matter of fact, the live coverage I wanted to see right now is another puff piece.

[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:41.220]
I just, you must be psychic because I just...

[02:15:41.220 --> 02:15:51.360]
It's a game that brutalized their own people, but we will stay to make sure that the Iraqi people have got the security necessary,

[02:15:52.060 --> 02:15:56.380]
the food necessary, the medicines necessary, the conditions necessary.

[02:15:56.400 --> 02:15:57.740]
The heckling of it.

[02:15:57.800 --> 02:15:58.940]
To have in Iraq, come on.

[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:04.640]
This is great.

[02:16:05.220 --> 02:16:06.540]
Heckling, heckling jackals.

[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:12.340]
Are these swasties here in Iraq?

[02:16:13.060 --> 02:16:22.960]
We will stay as long as necessary to make sure that the Iraqi people have government us, by, and the Iraqi people, and then we'll come home.

[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:31.700]
We have faced big challenges in this country.

[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.760]
They must not have screwed out the crowd as good as they usually do.

[02:16:35.500 --> 02:16:37.760]
They've got a few hecklers in there. Nice going, Air Georgie.

[02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:37.920]
Oh!

[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:40.000]
Anyway, Ed Norton, now what is this?

[02:16:40.100 --> 02:16:42.680]
You just passed me, Ed Harris, who were taken off of there, right? Too many lead roles?

[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:43.240]
Yeah.

[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:47.420]
But somebody could still be underrated even if they have lead roles.

[02:16:47.920 --> 02:16:48.140]
Right.

[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:50.900]
I mean, you could think somebody's underrated if they've had 100 lead roles.

[02:16:50.900 --> 02:16:51.860]
You could still think that they're not...

[02:16:51.860 --> 02:16:53.500]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, leave them on, Ed Harris.

[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:54.140]
Leave them on.

[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:58.160]
Mike William Holden said, in network, leave him on.

[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:00.020]
Remember that line?

[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:01.240]
Yeah, he's not underrated.

[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:03.100]
Who had Harris?

[02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:03.400]
Right.

[02:17:06.620 --> 02:17:07.200]
Pretty good.

[02:17:07.660 --> 02:17:08.440]
I'll leave it.

[02:17:08.640 --> 02:17:10.360]
Let's have a brawl over what are you saying?

[02:17:10.660 --> 02:17:13.520]
The inflation of the unemployment rate is 6%.

[02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:19.600]
That should serve as a warning signal for the reluctant members of the United States Congress.

[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:22.000]
Yeah, it should serve as a warning signal, not to put your ass in it, Rick.

[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.520]
And that's what it should serve as a warning signal about.

[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:26.580]
6% unemployment.

[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:30.140]
Yeah.

[02:17:31.220 --> 02:17:32.900]
Things go into hell in a hand basket.

[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:36.720]
But other than that, everything's looking really rosy.

[02:17:38.100 --> 02:17:38.820]
Ed Norton.

[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:41.700]
Yeah.

[02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.160]
Now, what is the point of this?

[02:17:43.660 --> 02:17:45.360]
I think they were suggesting Ed Norton.

[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:46.040]
Oh, I see.

[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:46.620]
Well, that's got...

[02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:48.240]
Because it's got the stuff you wrote on here today.

[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:49.580]
Are we going to put Ed Norton on there?

[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.280]
For the overrated.

[02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:54.980]
Okay.

[02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:58.960]
Like I said, anyway, where's the other facts that I already Schmidt-Kennoh here it is?

[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:01.560]
Mike from Cooper City says, my wife...

[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:02.640]
Now, see, this is a response.

[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:03.700]
I can't believe it.

[02:18:03.740 --> 02:18:04.080]
Oh!

[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:06.400]
And I can respond for something I'm asking about.

[02:18:07.620 --> 02:18:10.920]
My wife and I read it directly in for a dream this weekend and we both loved it.

[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:12.180]
We found it at the video connection.

[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:14.020]
You been at the video connection?

[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.700]
No, where the hell is it?

[02:18:17.080 --> 02:18:17.900]
Beats a hell out of me.

[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:20.700]
Mike is in Cooper City, so it can't be that far from you in Hollywood.

[02:18:21.580 --> 02:18:23.240]
Says the director, the great job telling the story.

[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:25.760]
The director is Darren Arunovsky, I should point out.

[02:18:26.060 --> 02:18:27.720]
It says, is you don't have anything else other than pie?

[02:18:27.940 --> 02:18:28.040]
No.

[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:29.580]
And there's no E and pie.

[02:18:29.780 --> 02:18:30.640]
It's like the number.

[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:35.460]
You know, our refrigerators always made some strange noises when I'm afraid to turn it back on.

[02:18:35.780 --> 02:18:37.760]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

[02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:40.480]
Also, PSVC in Catch 22 yet.

[02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.940]
No, I did not, because I was warned the no waste of your time seeing it.

[02:18:43.420 --> 02:18:44.800]
I was warned that the book was great.

[02:18:44.900 --> 02:18:46.200]
Remember we had that costic faxing?

[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:46.640]
Don't watch it.

[02:18:46.700 --> 02:18:47.260]
Did you see it?

[02:18:47.480 --> 02:18:47.580]
No.

[02:18:48.400 --> 02:18:48.760]
Beater?

[02:18:49.900 --> 02:18:50.260]
No.

[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.180]
I don't know.

[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:54.780]
I don't know if I can afford to be spending that much money.

[02:18:55.040 --> 02:18:57.000]
I spent the billions of dollars in a big shot like me.

[02:18:57.140 --> 02:18:58.500]
You know, I'm always there going to be crap.

[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:00.720]
Anyway, Rick Williamford dreamed Darren Arunovsky.

[02:19:00.820 --> 02:19:01.820]
That's the top of our list.

[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:02.900]
Make no mistake about it.

[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:05.440]
Now, here's Rich and Delray Beach who's very upset with George.

[02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:11.380]
It says, I've listened to your show for 12 years, but now it is becoming unbearable.

[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:15.740]
About three to six months ago, George started this phony cackling laugh.

[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:19.940]
I guess it's so annoying because it's constant.

[02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.920]
You must be doing it like real low in the background because I can't hear it.

[02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:25.100]
I'll just shut the microphone on.

[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:26.700]
See, there we go.

[02:19:26.760 --> 02:19:31.000]
It's getting real emotional and the real defensive in the fear of cackling again.

[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:38.620]
Getting real defensive thin skin, like I always thought you were the most thin skin person I've ever known in my life.

[02:19:39.180 --> 02:19:40.840]
Now I'm a dumbest stuff.

[02:19:40.900 --> 02:19:44.160]
I didn't speak when I called when he was screaming at a calls off the air.

[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:47.540]
No matter what type of yelling it was here, he'd start taking it personally.

[02:19:47.620 --> 02:19:49.340]
I don't like.

[02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:51.620]
I used to be whining about that stuff.

[02:19:51.940 --> 02:19:53.360]
I just mentioned it once in passing.

[02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.840]
No, you got to blow it up and it's not great.

[02:19:56.040 --> 02:19:57.240]
Not that you ever exaggerate.

[02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:58.440]
Oh my God.

[02:19:58.620 --> 02:19:59.540]
You're thinking of sparing parts.

[02:19:59.640 --> 02:19:59.840]
See?

[02:20:00.440 --> 02:20:01.420]
Even Santino agrees.

[02:20:01.620 --> 02:20:02.460]
You're thinking of sparing parts.

[02:20:02.540 --> 02:20:02.720]
Right.

[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:07.460]
Anyway, where was this laugh for the last several years?

[02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:09.260]
Did you just recently become funny?

[02:20:09.460 --> 02:20:10.720]
What a sicko fan it says.

[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:11.940]
What a sicko fan it says.

[02:20:11.940 --> 02:20:12.540]
What a buttlicker.

[02:20:12.780 --> 02:20:15.460]
Also, I've told you this before and I'll tell you again.

[02:20:15.620 --> 02:20:17.520]
Oh, now did you read the whole thing?

[02:20:17.700 --> 02:20:18.260]
Sure, of course I did.

[02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:20.760]
Well, in a rich and dull rate beat you're an idiot, okay?

[02:20:21.100 --> 02:20:21.860]
You're an era simple.

[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:23.380]
And you've listened for 12 years.

[02:20:23.440 --> 02:20:25.280]
I think it's long enough for 17, whatever it says.

[02:20:26.460 --> 02:20:27.380]
I've told you this before.

[02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:30.380]
You can tell me this rich from now until the cows come home.

[02:20:30.520 --> 02:20:34.620]
And there is no chance you should have Steve Keane host a few shows for you over the summer.

[02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:35.640]
Oh yeah.

[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:37.120]
One he has the time.

[02:20:37.120 --> 02:20:37.800]
Yeah, I'm sure that.

[02:20:38.180 --> 02:20:39.760]
Two, the audience would love to hate him.

[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:41.400]
And three, you share several sponsors.

[02:20:41.900 --> 02:20:42.580]
What did you do?

[02:20:42.940 --> 02:20:43.200]
Wow.

[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:44.860]
I don't know what you have against him.

[02:20:44.940 --> 02:20:45.760]
I'll tell you what I have against him.

[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:46.200]
He sucks.

[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:47.240]
That's what I have against him.

[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:47.480]
Okay.

[02:20:48.220 --> 02:20:49.640]
He always speaks well of you on the year.

[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:55.220]
I've listened to both George and George wouldn't hold his name against Steve Keane in debate.

[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:57.280]
We're not doing a debate, Rich and Del Ray Beat.

[02:20:57.540 --> 02:20:59.160]
We're doing an entertaining radio show.

[02:20:59.300 --> 02:20:59.380]
Okay.

[02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:03.200]
Mr. Keane is about his entertaining as I have a cancer of the kneecap in both knees.

[02:21:04.500 --> 02:21:07.480]
Just a pompous self-aggrandizing right wing piece of dirt.

[02:21:07.620 --> 02:21:09.400]
I'm going to put that piece of crap on this show.

[02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:10.880]
That'll be a cold day in hell.

[02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:12.480]
And I don't care what the least is about me.

[02:21:12.600 --> 02:21:12.760]
Okay.

[02:21:12.880 --> 02:21:13.220]
He's an idiot.

[02:21:14.580 --> 02:21:16.680]
You could put his whole guy there, an audience in a phone booth,

[02:21:16.680 --> 02:21:19.360]
but you have to make sure his plenty room for the denture cream and a polo dent.

[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:22.800]
Because the median age is death plus ten.

[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.320]
He's doing that stale old crap.

[02:21:24.600 --> 02:21:25.840]
You know, the amazing thing about him.

[02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:26.260]
And I got it.

[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:27.500]
The one thing I will say about him.

[02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:28.240]
And I've said this before.

[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:32.260]
Here's a guy who's managed to stay alive on the year with his 50,000

[02:21:32.860 --> 02:21:35.080]
commercials on here with all his different body parts,

[02:21:35.380 --> 02:21:37.820]
phony kneecaps, and phony toes, and phony of penises.

[02:21:38.980 --> 02:21:40.400]
And has never had any numbers.

[02:21:40.940 --> 02:21:44.500]
Even back on WNWS, you know, Jerry Williams' rest in peace back in those days.

[02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:48.240]
Well, when Jerry left and went back to Boston, they made after the

[02:21:49.380 --> 02:21:51.580]
pot seat episode that I had with Luke Cron.

[02:21:52.960 --> 02:21:56.420]
Well, they demoted me after coming on this program director and stuck me back on the

[02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:56.660]
red light.

[02:21:56.780 --> 02:21:57.360]
Thank you very much.

[02:21:57.800 --> 02:22:00.700]
And they made Alice Randell program director.

[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:04.380]
And one of the most grotesque things that that self-hating queen Alice Randell

[02:22:04.380 --> 02:22:06.980]
celebrated was bringing Mr. Ego in and putting him on the air.

[02:22:07.220 --> 02:22:09.840]
He used to come down and get off the air midnight and there he'd be at the

[02:22:09.840 --> 02:22:11.060]
front door waiting with his tape.

[02:22:11.640 --> 02:22:12.120]
Vogue in me.

[02:22:12.260 --> 02:22:13.100]
Oh, I want a job.

[02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:17.480]
And Mr. Ego got put on here by Alice Randell.

[02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:22.700]
And even during our gigantic books at WS News, there was still a heyday of that

[02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.300]
radio station.

[02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.340]
He never had any number.

[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:27.480]
In fact, the board office used to call him behind his back the three point.

[02:22:27.580 --> 02:22:27.760]
Oh!

[02:22:27.960 --> 02:22:29.100]
Man, because he had a three share.

[02:22:29.480 --> 02:22:31.280]
The rest of us had like double digits, you know.

[02:22:31.940 --> 02:22:33.500]
Alice is in there with an 8.9.

[02:22:33.500 --> 02:22:34.580]
I'm doing like 11 shares.

[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:36.800]
Wisters got like a 25 or 30 share overnight.

[02:22:37.620 --> 02:22:38.820]
And he's got a three point.

[02:22:38.900 --> 02:22:39.080]
Oh!

[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:41.500]
And on the light bulb, did he ever have a number there?

[02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:41.920]
No.

[02:22:43.220 --> 02:22:46.600]
Wasn't it was he on, correct me if I'm my memory spading?

[02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.520]
Wasn't he one of the 50 people they tried at an I.N.C.

[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:52.700]
back when they were doing the talk when after a cheap channel bought it?

[02:22:53.020 --> 02:22:53.160]
Right.

[02:22:53.580 --> 02:22:54.080]
Or Paxton.

[02:22:54.580 --> 02:22:56.360]
When Sandy Payton and all those people were.

[02:22:57.140 --> 02:22:58.140]
No, no, no, no.

[02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:01.500]
In a morning show, when they had John Ford dollars of they were trying like a different

[02:23:01.500 --> 02:23:03.140]
morning show every month, I think he was one of them.

[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:04.840]
I don't recall if he was.

[02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:06.540]
And he had fractions.

[02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.440]
He had fractions on the light bulb.

[02:23:08.440 --> 02:23:11.820]
He's on a radio station now that nobody could even find it on the dial with both hands.

[02:23:12.060 --> 02:23:12.840]
Also has fractions.

[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:13.780]
He's got no audience.

[02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:17.120]
So give it a rest already.

[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:20.640]
He's had more than enough for a guy that has no audience and a guy that has no numbers.

[02:23:21.260 --> 02:23:23.160]
Certainly, he had more than enough publicity this month.

[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:23.620]
Wouldn't you think?

[02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:24.740]
I guess probably never enough.

[02:23:24.820 --> 02:23:26.380]
Wouldn't you have that much of a publicity on?

[02:23:27.240 --> 02:23:27.820]
So, what do you think?

[02:23:27.920 --> 02:23:28.260]
Paul Moffelvic.

[02:23:28.700 --> 02:23:29.180]
Right wing.

[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:30.640]
Born again right wing.

[02:23:31.180 --> 02:23:32.140]
Goopball is what he is.

[02:23:32.420 --> 02:23:33.280]
How the hell did they make a living?

[02:23:35.680 --> 02:23:37.420]
Did you ever see the show that he has them?

[02:23:37.420 --> 02:23:39.100]
Well, you wouldn't because you live in Dave County.

[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:40.900]
I'm pubic access on Sunday at one o'clock.

[02:23:41.020 --> 02:23:41.200]
No.

[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:44.200]
You would, you would crap your pants.

[02:23:44.600 --> 02:23:47.800]
You would laugh so hard you'd actually have to change underwear five times.

[02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:50.280]
And the show starts out.

[02:23:50.500 --> 02:23:51.740]
It's on public access.

[02:23:52.020 --> 02:23:53.700]
The show starts out with like ten commercials.

[02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:59.360]
Here we got the doctor with a phony, this and a phony, that and a phony ears and the phony nose and the phony boobs.

[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:01.360]
And all the other injections.

[02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:03.640]
And then we go to this background.

[02:24:03.640 --> 02:24:05.180]
It's like it's shot through a linoleum.

[02:24:06.120 --> 02:24:07.840]
Why am I wasting so much time on him?

[02:24:07.840 --> 02:24:08.840]
Why are you asking these questions?

[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:09.240]

[02:24:09.320 --> 02:24:20.860]
Like I said, he's had more than enough publicity with all that diversity board bull crap and 50,000 articles in the newspapers and buddy Nevin's of course making a he-while-a-sun shines because he just loves his fellow homophobler and Broward.

[02:24:21.460 --> 02:24:24.340]
And it's part of the fact he tried to cover his tracks with another article this weekend.

[02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:25.800]
You're not fooling anybody, buddy.

[02:24:26.020 --> 02:24:27.980]
Okay, you're not fooling anybody, buddy.

[02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:31.960]
So anyway, to make a long story short, the answer is no.

[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.660]
The game is in the car.

[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:37.060]
We're supporting you 560.

[02:24:37.540 --> 02:24:38.720]
You A.M.

[02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:41.780]
The state goldstein.

[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:42.960]
But you can call me Kelsey.

[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:46.080]
Whenever I'm in town, I listen to, wait a minute, I am in town.

[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.880]
It's the 12th of one hour.

[02:24:50.440 --> 02:24:51.940]
Now on DVD.

[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:54.420]
From the director of Girls Gone Wild.

[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:56.680]
She is the wild wild action.

[02:24:56.740 --> 02:24:57.960]
It's Amish Gone Wild.

[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:01.360]
Joshua, you may observe my ankles.

[02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.340]
Oh, you are crazy girls.

[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:06.280]
Under my dress, I am wearing leather hoses.

[02:25:06.540 --> 02:25:07.720]
Have you gone viral?

[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.120]
Or viral, wild, I touch it.

[02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:09.820]
You're just wild.

[02:25:10.060 --> 02:25:11.240]
Amish Gone Wild.

[02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:12.480]
Check out my wrap.

[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:14.260]
You have a beautiful wrap.

[02:25:14.740 --> 02:25:15.540]
May I touch it?

[02:25:15.680 --> 02:25:18.020]
Have you ever seen a nicer spice rack?

[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:20.340]
It's like grossed-on wilds over here.

[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:24.020]
11.59 at 5.60 WDQ.

[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:24.900]
I'm happy Monday, too.

[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:27.440]
You notice how flustered were you watching a president say you're not?

[02:25:27.440 --> 02:25:27.960]
Yeah.

[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:30.380]
God, real flustered and right in the push.

[02:25:30.660 --> 02:25:34.400]
He's not used to that because they usually have these well-managed and retro-troubled

[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:35.700]
parties at the Heritage Foundation.

[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:37.120]
Was it at the Heritage Foundation?

[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:37.740]
No, not this.

[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:38.500]
I don't know where this is.

[02:25:38.540 --> 02:25:40.720]
That's usually the kind of people he speaks in front of.

[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:41.980]
The American Enterprise Institute.

[02:25:42.260 --> 02:25:44.700]
Places where they'll all be friendly and be sucking around heavy duty.

[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:47.420]
And had their arm up at that 45 degree angle?

[02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:51.000]
Lizard had found an Applebee salad.

[02:25:51.520 --> 02:25:51.920]
Oi!

[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:53.560]
Coralville, Iowa.

[02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:58.040]
I wonder if what's his name?

[02:25:58.140 --> 02:25:58.880]
Was there Rucker Howard?

[02:26:00.300 --> 02:26:03.940]
A customer at a restaurant in Iowa got a little something extra in the carry-out salad.

[02:26:04.800 --> 02:26:08.660]
Lizard had was found in the salad prepared at Applebee's neighborhood grill and bar in Coralville.

[02:26:09.120 --> 02:26:11.860]
Applebee says the lizard had tested negative for a salmonella.

[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.860]
Final results are expected today.

[02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:17.960]
Officials say the restaurant is now using pre-cut pre-cleaned lettuce for its salads.

[02:26:18.540 --> 02:26:20.540]
As opposed to like grabbing it over the backyard, I guess?

[02:26:23.380 --> 02:26:23.840]
Yeah.

[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:29.600]
Though she'll love that it's the lizard had tested negative for a salmonella.

[02:26:29.780 --> 02:26:30.960]
Does that make you feel a lot better?

[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:32.220]
You've had a terrific fight with the Lord.

[02:26:32.220 --> 02:26:33.640]
I should be relieved about that.

[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.420]
But final results are expected today.

[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:40.620]
That's kind of like an apple.

[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:42.840]
The Applebee's out there on sunrise.

[02:26:42.840 --> 02:26:43.640]
You know what I mean?

[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:47.180]
It's just a place I would never go to.

[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.200]
Good plan.

[02:26:49.480 --> 02:26:50.180]
Bad execution?

[02:26:50.780 --> 02:26:51.020]
Yeah.

[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:54.500]
I have a message for Patty who sent me a very nice fact with a very nice offer.

[02:26:54.680 --> 02:26:57.180]
But I have to decline since I already ordered the movie from Amazon.

[02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:58.140]
What's he offered?

[02:26:58.800 --> 02:27:04.020]
She's going to put my name on a list to reserve happiness for me at this particular place.

[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:05.280]
To reserve it?

[02:27:05.500 --> 02:27:05.680]
Yeah.

[02:27:06.080 --> 02:27:07.120]
But you don't have to wait.

[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:07.980]
See, this is embarrassing.

[02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:08.760]
But it's all done.

[02:27:08.940 --> 02:27:10.140]
It's done. I got my confirmation.

[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:14.040]
No, no, but the fact that it's taking you this long, you were supposed to watch this last week, right?

[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:18.600]
And went out and tried to buy the guy the M thing or rent it or whatever and still couldn't find it.

[02:27:20.060 --> 02:27:21.400]
See, this is what happens.

[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:24.100]
And remember we used to talk about that bastard Wayne when he was involved.

[02:27:24.100 --> 02:27:25.520]
He had both fingers and blockbuster.

[02:27:26.020 --> 02:27:28.180]
And they put out all the mom and pop video stores.

[02:27:28.180 --> 02:27:30.440]
They put them all into business, which was their whole goal.

[02:27:30.880 --> 02:27:33.280]
This good family enterprise blockbuster.

[02:27:33.440 --> 02:27:34.880]
Yeah, put everybody else out of business.

[02:27:35.040 --> 02:27:37.520]
And so they're just aren't enough video stores anymore like there should be.

[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:42.780]
And of course, you don't have a Sam's or an HMV.

[02:27:42.780 --> 02:27:44.620]
I mean, you got crap is what you got.

[02:27:46.120 --> 02:27:49.980]
If you could see the HMV stores here, man, they got movies that haven't even made yet.

[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:50.920]
They got them on DVD.

[02:27:53.160 --> 02:27:56.600]
The only thing that pisses me off is they got a big selection of VHS's too.

[02:27:56.700 --> 02:27:58.180]
And I can't find Ed Wooder Bob Roberts.

[02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:00.200]
And we're going to have to break down, order it off.

[02:28:00.460 --> 02:28:02.520]
Which I don't mind doing it, order it off the web.

[02:28:02.640 --> 02:28:04.240]
But then you got to wait, you know, right?

[02:28:05.260 --> 02:28:07.120]
And me being the impatient prick that I am.

[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:09.300]
Gary Sinesi from Truman movie?

[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:10.560]
Gary Sinesi.

[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:12.260]
Sinesi, how we say it that way?

[02:28:12.260 --> 02:28:13.300]
Well, how do we say it?

[02:28:13.300 --> 02:28:13.800]
He's going on.

[02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:14.840]
Gary Sinesi's completely.

[02:28:16.080 --> 02:28:18.220]
This is from a girl listening without a faxx.

[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.020]
Thank you, sweetheart.

[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:20.680]
Gary Sinesi.

[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:22.740]
Remember that song I like Sinesi?

[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:23.080]
No.

[02:28:25.180 --> 02:28:26.120]
My money Python?

[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:27.080]
Oh, that one.

[02:28:27.600 --> 02:28:33.320]
Phil says a really great comedic actor who's extremely underrated that I think is pull worthy.

[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:34.480]
And now here's one I never heard of.

[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:35.000]
Jack Black.

[02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:38.180]
Yeah, he's in a lot of these comedy movies.

[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:39.200]
Is Jack Black?

[02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:40.480]
Not really.

[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.120]
He was in Orange County, high fidelity and shallow hell.

[02:28:44.440 --> 02:28:47.460]
He also has a really great band, Tanesha's D, Super Funny Guy.

[02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:48.920]
Okay, let's put Jack Black on it.

[02:28:49.080 --> 02:28:49.180]
Okay.

[02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:50.680]
What a hell not.

[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:52.200]
We're here to please.

[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.020]
We're here to like, because you never know me.

[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:55.780]
If you get like a whole bunch of votes, you'll get.

[02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:56.900]
Fuck third man.

[02:28:57.080 --> 02:28:57.360]
Could be.

[02:28:58.100 --> 02:29:02.340]
PSM movie I recommend you to rent or buy as I am Sam with Sean Penny plays a good retarded

[02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:02.780]
great movie.

[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:05.220]
I'm not, I'm not big on retarded, you know.

[02:29:05.320 --> 02:29:05.740]
I'm with you.

[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:07.460]
And that one I tried to watch the beginning of it.

[02:29:07.460 --> 02:29:10.800]
And I was crying within five minutes, so I had to change it.

[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:12.480]
You were crying within five minutes.

[02:29:12.480 --> 02:29:14.600]
I was crying a pool of tears.

[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:16.960]
I'm exaggerating, of course.

[02:29:17.120 --> 02:29:17.460]
It was just a crying.

[02:29:18.320 --> 02:29:19.080]
Because it's depressing.

[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:22.620]
It starts out depressing and I'm thinking, Jesus, it can only get to sound.

[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.360]
Let's get some of that music on right now.

[02:29:24.500 --> 02:29:25.600]
It's been depressing from Requiem.

[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.720]
Let's get that on it right away.

[02:29:29.420 --> 02:29:31.720]
See the thing about Sean Penn playing a retarded person.

[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:33.380]
I'm going to be on television.

[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:37.820]
I gave it a good seat.

[02:29:38.280 --> 02:29:41.820]
I guess we can put Ellen Berson on there, but I think she was nominated for an Academy

[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:42.420]
Award for Best.

[02:29:42.500 --> 02:29:43.600]
Yeah, she's on our planet every day.

[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:45.460]
Everybody says she's great in there right.

[02:29:45.540 --> 02:29:46.800]
She is one of the all-time best.

[02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:51.160]
Keep the music going while I read these files.

[02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:53.900]
Mark's done a nice apology for art.

[02:29:54.080 --> 02:29:55.920]
Mark with the eight page facts.

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:00.120]
Oh, so hey, Mark, if you'll vaccinate your email address, I'll give you an email address.

[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:02.440]
But what's earned him, man?

[02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:03.180]
Yeah.

[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:07.980]
The most underrated actor in my opinion says this facts is Alan Arkin.

[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:12.460]
That's what we could use in that studio, you know, the Arkin man.

[02:30:13.800 --> 02:30:14.940]
We should put him on there.

[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:16.520]
I wrote A&N down at the bottom of that.

[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:17.240]
Oh, okay.

[02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:19.120]
Alan Arkin just went on there.

[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.320]
Oh, that music is just getting to me.

[02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:21.200]
I may have walked over again.

[02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:21.720]
Yes.

[02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:25.200]
He's in Glen Gary Glen Ross doing a phenomenal job as usual along with that hair.

[02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:26.600]
It says, I know you're not a fan of his.

[02:30:26.600 --> 02:30:28.860]
What, having said a few weeks ago, he makes you want to vomit.

[02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:29.720]
What did I say that?

[02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:32.260]
I never said that.

[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:34.380]
I never heard that.

[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.900]
Alan Arkin makes me want to vomit.

[02:30:37.860 --> 02:30:39.400]
But hopefully he can still be out of the list.

[02:30:39.540 --> 02:30:40.760]
I have no idea where that came from.

[02:30:40.840 --> 02:30:42.360]
He's a master of dialect and accents.

[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:46.060]
Yadi Yadiak goes on and on and on, terrorizing a bunch.

[02:30:46.320 --> 02:30:48.160]
I never said anything bad about Alan Arkin.

[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:49.660]
He must be having confused with somebody else.

[02:30:51.080 --> 02:30:52.820]
A great actor, director, musician yet.

[02:30:52.860 --> 02:30:55.600]
When you mentioned his name, people most likely say, oh, he was great at...

[02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:56.760]
Wait a minute.

[02:30:57.260 --> 02:31:00.220]
He was great in MASH, confusing with Alan Alda, who sucks.

[02:31:00.780 --> 02:31:01.440]
Maybe that's what it was.

[02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:04.860]
Alan Arkin will be my choice as the most underrated actor.

[02:31:05.000 --> 02:31:06.280]
Alan Alda will be my choice actor.

[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:08.320]
I'd like to see it thrown under a train.

[02:31:09.700 --> 02:31:12.000]
If Alan Arkin is deemed to be too high-profile, I know he's not.

[02:31:12.120 --> 02:31:14.120]
Then John C. Riley will be my Alda in a choice.

[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:16.500]
He's a low profile Philips Seymour Hoffman.

[02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:19.380]
In fact, the two are great friends who routinely work together on Broadway.

[02:31:19.760 --> 02:31:22.600]
From hard-eat to Magnolia to Chicago, he's a rising star.

[02:31:23.060 --> 02:31:25.860]
In 10 years, he probably won't be eligible for this list for right now.

[02:31:25.860 --> 02:31:27.200]
Who John C. Riley?

[02:31:27.780 --> 02:31:28.980]
Is he kind to Genie C. Riley?

[02:31:29.420 --> 02:31:30.280]
I think they're Ken.

[02:31:30.820 --> 02:31:31.480]
F-A-T-A?

[02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:32.400]
He was a boogie knight.

[02:31:33.900 --> 02:31:34.900]
When was your turn to see?

[02:31:35.440 --> 02:31:37.760]
He was the friend of Dirk.

[02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:39.240]
He was a Dirk digler.

[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:40.440]
Yeah, Mark Wahlberg's friend.

[02:31:41.740 --> 02:31:42.540]
The musician.

[02:31:42.760 --> 02:31:44.400]
The one that he was musician with.

[02:31:44.620 --> 02:31:45.200]
Oh, that one.

[02:31:45.440 --> 02:31:46.540]
They had a great band.

[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:47.240]
Oh, geez.

[02:31:47.840 --> 02:31:48.120]
Yeah.

[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:50.300]
It is so cute.

[02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:50.940]
Yeah.

[02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:52.100]
Well, it is.

[02:31:53.140 --> 02:31:54.900]
Anyway, these movie shows them in fantastic.

[02:31:55.100 --> 02:31:56.540]
Let's keep this going all the way to summer vacation.

[02:31:56.820 --> 02:31:57.720]
Screw the rest of these bastards.

[02:31:57.940 --> 02:31:58.680]
They should only drop that.

[02:31:58.760 --> 02:31:59.520]
Now this is getting good.

[02:32:00.020 --> 02:32:00.920]
Oh, yeah, yeah.

[02:32:01.040 --> 02:32:02.040]
This is excellent.

[02:32:02.540 --> 02:32:06.800]
Chuck and Buck is the movie with the guy who tracks down his friend from childhood.

[02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:07.360]
Great movie.

[02:32:07.540 --> 02:32:09.900]
You have to be gay to really enjoy it.

[02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:10.500]
I've seen that.

[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:12.420]
I was, uh...

[02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:12.780]
I don't know.

[02:32:12.840 --> 02:32:12.960]
Chuck.

[02:32:13.240 --> 02:32:15.600]
I couldn't tell if it was a comedy or if it was...

[02:32:15.600 --> 02:32:16.660]
No, it was not a comedy.

[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:18.460]
Are you kidding me?

[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:20.220]
You see, I don't know often about facts, okay?

[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:29.580]
Let me tell you right now, one of the worst things about being gay is it happens that every single one of us falling in love with straight guys, okay?

[02:32:29.740 --> 02:32:31.460]
Believe me, I could make you a list.

[02:32:31.900 --> 02:32:35.400]
And of course, it always leads to the long bitter end.

[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:36.760]
You know, there's always a long bitter end.

[02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:39.280]
All in this case, there was like something bitter sweet.

[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:40.180]
There was a happy ending.

[02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:40.720]
Happy ending.

[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:45.460]
Well, actually, it was kind of like any fight into his wedding and he showed up at the wedding.

[02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:47.560]
Oh, see, I just spoiled it for you.

[02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:48.460]
No, that's okay.

[02:32:48.940 --> 02:32:50.160]
Chuck and Buck, SNF.

[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:51.660]
I can't quote the line at the street.

[02:32:51.660 --> 02:32:53.140]
Yeah, that's the line that I was thinking about.

[02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:54.560]
Chuck and Buck.

[02:32:55.080 --> 02:32:57.540]
When they were kids, they used to be there a line when it would stick their right.

[02:32:57.540 --> 02:32:57.840]
I see.

[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:01.700]
Mike White, who wrote the movie and played Buck, is a complete lunatic.

[02:33:02.020 --> 02:33:04.020]
It should be put away once he stops making movies.

[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:05.420]
Well, we can say it's Mike White.

[02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:06.200]
Yeah, it's a...

[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:06.860]
You ain't got to see that.

[02:33:07.120 --> 02:33:07.660]
Chuck and Buck.

[02:33:08.340 --> 02:33:09.920]
They appreciate it.

[02:33:10.540 --> 02:33:12.100]
You're sick enough that you don't enjoy it.

[02:33:12.240 --> 02:33:12.640]
I'll give it a shot.

[02:33:12.680 --> 02:33:13.620]
I got an eye at C.

[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.440]
William H. Maisie Fargo.

[02:33:16.440 --> 02:33:17.100]
We got him on here.

[02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:19.060]
Funny as seen is between him and Bouchimi.

[02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:20.880]
I'm not going to debate you, Jerry.

[02:33:21.020 --> 02:33:22.620]
This is an effing debate.

[02:33:25.320 --> 02:33:27.480]
It's low key, in spite of what Rich Factor says.

[02:33:27.980 --> 02:33:28.600]
Rich Factor?

[02:33:28.720 --> 02:33:29.240]
Rich Factor.

[02:33:30.100 --> 02:33:30.820]
What's the...

[02:33:30.820 --> 02:33:32.300]
The Pactor Factor on.

[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:33.660]
Is he going to put that O'Reilly off there?

[02:33:33.740 --> 02:33:33.920]
No.

[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:35.120]
It's the ex-pactor.

[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:39.260]
I guarantee you, Rich Factor could get probably better ratings than Bill O'Reilly on the

[02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:42.380]
lifeboat because Bill O'Reilly's got the same as Norm Canne, a big zero.

[02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:43.920]
You got zero, Norma.

[02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:46.100]
And quit calling my house, so I'm not there.

[02:33:46.240 --> 02:33:46.960]
Quit bugging everybody.

[02:33:48.660 --> 02:33:51.740]
Now that I get rid of Waleesi and Columna here, don't call here, Norm.

[02:33:52.300 --> 02:33:54.180]
You'll hear a dial tone, so God damn fast.

[02:33:54.300 --> 02:33:55.760]
Unless it's a major...

[02:33:55.760 --> 02:33:57.200]
I mean, major emergency.

[02:33:57.380 --> 02:33:58.980]
Like maybe you lost your tickets to the Marlon game.

[02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:00.740]
And you're playing on the West Coast anyway.

[02:34:02.160 --> 02:34:04.020]
Well, he has one real chronic pain in the ass.

[02:34:04.340 --> 02:34:05.060]
But you notice...

[02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:07.000]
You don't notice because I haven't told you.

[02:34:07.080 --> 02:34:08.340]
But life is so much simpler now.

[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:09.880]
Yeah.

[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:11.220]
You mention that.

[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:12.160]
You want to know why?

[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:13.080]
Mom mentioned it again.

[02:34:13.880 --> 02:34:14.780]
Because my phone...

[02:34:14.780 --> 02:34:15.780]
My phone really rings.

[02:34:15.780 --> 02:34:18.000]
Yeah, I really had reached the point in my life.

[02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:19.000]
And I'm not making this up.

[02:34:19.080 --> 02:34:19.780]
I'm not exaggerating.

[02:34:21.240 --> 02:34:23.440]
I couldn't sit down and take a crap.

[02:34:23.700 --> 02:34:26.240]
You know, I just concentrated with my magazine or newspaper

[02:34:26.240 --> 02:34:26.520]
whatever.

[02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:29.540]
And just take a good healthy dump without the phone ringing.

[02:34:30.620 --> 02:34:32.600]
At that point, you know you're getting too many calls.

[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:33.880]
From people who have nothing to say.

[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:35.320]
You know what I'm talking about?

[02:34:35.540 --> 02:34:35.960]
Yeah, I know.

[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:40.000]
But who is the most underrated movie actor or actress of all time

[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:40.920]
is our poll question today.

[02:34:41.060 --> 02:34:42.400]
Excellent poll again, thank you.

[02:34:44.240 --> 02:34:47.600]
190 votes, which some got the DQ would be apologize to those people,

[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:48.540]
but too bad you lose.

[02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:50.640]
Because we had to take two of them off of there.

[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:52.900]
Christopher Walken and who else did we take on?

[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.100]
Oh, how's from there forget.

[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:58.480]
Somebody, Harvey Kitell.

[02:34:58.660 --> 02:34:58.760]
Right.

[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:02.100]
Steve Buschimi is got 24, Edoniel 17,

[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:06.620]
Terry Oldman 16, Brian Denny's got 15, I told you, he's excellent.

[02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:08.180]
He's a damn good actor.

[02:35:08.180 --> 02:35:11.940]
Here, Lee J. Cobb 13, James Garner 13, Kevin Bacon 12.

[02:35:13.360 --> 02:35:14.560]
Kevin Bacon is great.

[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:16.160]
Yeah, he is.

[02:35:17.840 --> 02:35:19.160]
And there's just something about him.

[02:35:19.160 --> 02:35:19.520]
I don't know.

[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:20.940]
And you don't watch what you're great.

[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:23.560]
And, and used to play.

[02:35:23.700 --> 02:35:24.800]
I don't care what anybody says.

[02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:27.960]
He used to play Sarah's son on guiding light 100 years ago.

[02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:29.260]
Oh, speaking of guiding light.

[02:35:29.420 --> 02:35:30.720]
Is that show getting hot again?

[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:31.420]
All of a sudden, huh?

[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:34.000]
I just mentioned that for my five so popper ladies out there and Queens.

[02:35:34.860 --> 02:35:37.100]
And that's you is just smoking these days.

[02:35:37.100 --> 02:35:38.640]
The old guiding light.

[02:35:39.500 --> 02:35:41.440]
And the good news is I see that also a day.

[02:35:41.580 --> 02:35:42.400]
And that's just passions.

[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:45.560]
I see a day here, but guiding light because they still show it at three.

[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:48.180]
But it's the next day's episode from what the people of South Florida would see.

[02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:52.000]
As usual, South Florida 24 hours behind the rest of the North America.

[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:58.560]
James Garner 14, Lee J. Cobb 13, Kevin Bacon 12.

[02:35:58.900 --> 02:36:02.360]
William H. Macy 10, Jeff Bridges 10, everybody else single digits.

[02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:05.240]
James Spader 9, Cromald and 7, Eli Wallach 5.

[02:36:05.240 --> 02:36:07.880]
Hey, Eli, hurry up and eat the canoli with you.

[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.640]
I thought we could reason together.

[02:36:10.900 --> 02:36:13.380]
Seriously, his acting in that movie is so bad.

[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:17.020]
There are people on death row for lesser offenses than his acting in that movie.

[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:18.340]
And the guy was right.

[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.100]
He ordinarily was a great actor for about 100 years.

[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:23.680]
Or at least maybe about third man.

[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:25.380]
Yeah, legendary Eli Wallach.

[02:36:27.780 --> 02:36:30.380]
Do you think that they wanted him to camp it up that bad?

[02:36:30.520 --> 02:36:32.180]
That was the intention of the character?

[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:33.940]
Who knows?

[02:36:33.940 --> 02:36:36.060]
I mean, there was somebody.

[02:36:36.140 --> 02:36:38.960]
Remember what you were talking about with Pacino in the fact that he just,

[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:42.340]
you know, did such a horrible job in Donnie Braske, which he did.

[02:36:44.700 --> 02:36:46.540]
And I think the same thing has been true here.

[02:36:46.640 --> 02:36:49.620]
They may just have said, well, you know, they were short on time and on budget.

[02:36:49.780 --> 02:36:51.840]
And they, right, pasted the whole thing together real fast.

[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:55.660]
And they put that big nose, the Maria Sophie, whatever name was.

[02:36:55.780 --> 02:36:56.520]
There was a couple in there.

[02:36:57.660 --> 02:37:00.660]
And they had George Hamilton in there where Tom Hagen should have been.

[02:37:00.660 --> 02:37:04.400]
I mean, what business was he in there doing?

[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:05.840]
George Hamilton, care.

[02:37:06.380 --> 02:37:10.700]
I guess anybody that was hanging around on, you know, near the set.

[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:11.500]
Are you busy now?

[02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:12.760]
Yeah, you busy, Jordan.

[02:37:12.760 --> 02:37:13.520]
Come on.

[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:14.640]
You can play the lawyer this time.

[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:17.840]
I mean, he was no Tom Hagen.

[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:21.460]
What else did Tom Hagen lie?

[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:23.560]
Jesus Christ.

[02:37:23.860 --> 02:37:25.460]
Oh, yeah.

[02:37:26.320 --> 02:37:26.760]
Yeah.

[02:37:30.160 --> 02:37:31.240]
Oh, what the hell was that?

[02:37:31.320 --> 02:37:31.820]
All of us.

[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:33.000]
Tom Killer.

[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:34.540]
Oh, just a time killer.

[02:37:34.680 --> 02:37:35.540]
I'm looking for this line.

[02:37:35.960 --> 02:37:38.240]
I can't find what I don't even know what that one looking for on here.

[02:37:38.900 --> 02:37:39.600]
Oh, here it is.

[02:37:40.100 --> 02:37:40.700]
I'm thinking about.

[02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:43.240]
Well, let me tell you something, my crock, Mick Brent.

[02:37:43.460 --> 02:37:44.820]
Jesus, all that time just to find out.

[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:47.300]
Boy, nobody can kill time like I can.

[02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:48.220]
I'll tell you that right now.

[02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:53.080]
5667-0560, pound 560 on the 18 team for Eisenhower, this one.

[02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:56.600]
So Jack Black, Alan Arkin and John C. Riley, we had it on there.

[02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:58.660]
I would know John C. Riley if he walked in here right now.

[02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:00.160]
I have no idea who that is.

[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:03.320]
Tell me something he was in.

[02:38:04.240 --> 02:38:04.660]
Boogie nights.

[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:07.400]
I can't picture him either.

[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.300]
I can picture him from Boogie nights.

[02:38:09.620 --> 02:38:10.900]
He's got curly hair like that.

[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:11.940]
Oh, now you said that.

[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:13.120]
You couldn't tell me who he played.

[02:38:14.300 --> 02:38:15.200]
Yeah, he's the friend.

[02:38:15.300 --> 02:38:16.200]
He's the one that he was in the bandwidth.

[02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:18.580]
The band.

[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:20.560]
In the bandwidth, Dirk Diggler.

[02:38:20.980 --> 02:38:22.440]
He was one of the, he was dig-

[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:24.060]
He was dingling Dirk in the band.

[02:38:24.060 --> 02:38:27.540]
The boys in the studio, whether the studio making that great demo tape.

[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:28.240]
Yeah.

[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.880]
And Dirk Diggler is such throwing kicks.

[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:31.640]
Karate kicks it the guy.

[02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:33.280]
He is so hard.

[02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:35.780]
Top 13 at 560-00WQM.

[02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:39.340]
Let me tell you right now, if you're big and fat man like Ron Jeremy with or without the hair.

[02:38:39.900 --> 02:38:41.800]
Here's the answer for you, balance for life.

[02:38:42.420 --> 02:38:45.640]
There was a thing on Ron Jeremy on, I think on ISC over the weekend.

[02:38:46.720 --> 02:38:50.280]
God, is he big and fat and disgusting and the thing I will never forget is

[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:54.420]
as long as I live the fact that he actually was offended by the fact that I talked about how fat and disgusting he was.

[02:38:54.500 --> 02:38:55.500]
He was very offended by that.

[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:56.240]
Let's put say that.

[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:58.360]
Hey Ronny, you're fat and disgusting, okay?

[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:04.600]
And like came out in our polly of the day, people think that us fat folks, especially the big huge fat, are pathetic.

[02:39:05.020 --> 02:39:06.540]
Remember that poll we took not to many days ago?

[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:07.320]
Disgusting.

[02:39:07.980 --> 02:39:12.760]
Well, if you're trying to be disgusting and out of shape and lethargic and diabetic and dying over there,

[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:14.800]
here's one of the answers for your balance for life.

[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:19.060]
Now, like I've always told you before, not every diet or weight loss program works for everybody.

[02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:20.920]
But this just could be the answer that you've been looking for.

[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:25.560]
If you've failed on all of the others, the low carbs and the diet pills and all of that stuff,

[02:39:25.580 --> 02:39:30.420]
and you still fat and tubby and frustrated, balance for life might be the answer because it makes it so simple for you.

[02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:35.860]
You have no cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no calorie counting, no carbohydrate counting, no figuring out to do.

[02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:40.740]
All you got to do is be able to get from wherever your ass is sitting to your door by six o'clock every morning when if you get up.

[02:39:41.140 --> 02:39:43.800]
And there's your food for the entire day waiting for you in a little black sack.

[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.920]
Three delicious gourmet meals, two delicious snacks delivered right to your doorstep and your sack every day.

[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:52.960]
And you choose between two different meal choices for every meal every day that you're on the program.

[02:39:53.100 --> 02:39:54.840]
That's it, that's the only choice you'll have to make.

[02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:57.460]
And the food, like I always tell you, is fresh and delicious.

[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:05.020]
There are chicken dishes and beef dishes and they're like Chinese dishes and you know, just all kinds of good stuff, wraps and stuff, no crap, just wraps.

[02:40:05.680 --> 02:40:11.060]
So that balance for life helped you lose that weight, the easy, painless way and quickly and fat and disgusting and also unhealthy,

[02:40:11.060 --> 02:40:12.280]
which is the most important part.

[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:17.720]
Cobb balance for life, you ought yourself to give this a try because it just might be the answer you've been searching for for a long time.

[02:40:18.980 --> 02:40:21.680]
954-568-229, that's the number to call.

[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:29.860]
954-568-229 and watch those pounds melt away or visit their worldwide website at balanceforlife.com.

[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:35.380]
This is 420-568-219.

[02:40:35.380 --> 02:40:36.120]
You way up.

[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.700]
Morning, we have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or permission from those depicted.

[02:40:43.920 --> 02:40:47.020]
It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent look as ridiculous as possible.

[02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:49.220]
We hope we reach that goal or at least major life.

[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.360]
Good morning. I'm Senator Hilary Rodham Clinton from New York.

[02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:58.220]
I was pleased to hear President Bush announce millions of Americans are without the money they need to get by.

[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:03.300]
Left to wonder how they will pay rent by food and purchase clothes for their children.

[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:06.800]
Is that the kind of America we want in 2003?

[02:41:07.580 --> 02:41:09.000]
In my state, we do.

[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:12.420]
We owe hardworking Americans nothing.

[02:41:12.420 --> 02:41:22.540]
The Senate, the House and the President should make a joint New Year's resolution that would leave millions of Americans to begin the New Year with empty pockets and little hope.

[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:26.840]
Many will be forced to leave their homes and take their children to shelters.

[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:33.220]
I'm Senator Hilary Rodham Clinton and I wish you and our country difficult economic times.

[02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:34.720]
Thank you for listening.

[02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:35.380]
All right.

[02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:38.120]
From 18 to 560, look at that market of 98 points.

[02:41:38.180 --> 02:41:41.500]
It dollars all the way to 8703 in the NASDAQs of 20 points to 1540.

[02:41:41.660 --> 02:41:43.420]
The only problem is the dollar is worth a cram.

[02:41:43.740 --> 02:41:44.660]
Wow, that's your problem.

[02:41:44.900 --> 02:41:46.380]
And we got record unemployment while not record.

[02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:48.440]
But modern day record unemployment over 6%.

[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:50.840]
And lost 2.5 million jobs in the last two years.

[02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:53.240]
And the euro is now a dollar 16.

[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:54.260]
Oh, right.

[02:41:54.460 --> 02:41:56.720]
And the Canadian dollar is all the way up to about 72 cents.

[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.760]
If this summer was 62 cents, why?

[02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:01.400]
It might be worth a dollar someday.

[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:02.680]
Oh, don't say that.

[02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:05.600]
Oh, my God.

[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:06.500]
Are you smitten me?

[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:07.680]
Oh, I see.

[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:08.780]
Now chuck and buck suck.

[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:11.420]
And I see I forgot I could actually say the first word they were correct.

[02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:13.760]
We're so pacified now by all these this repression.

[02:42:15.140 --> 02:42:17.800]
Chuck and buck suck and the other one I can't say yet.

[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:20.420]
Please have to take care of you.

[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:20.880]
Don't they?

[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:22.140]
All right. Let's go.

[02:42:26.340 --> 02:42:27.640]
Oh, this is late night video.

[02:42:27.720 --> 02:42:28.540]
It's this is on movie.

[02:42:28.580 --> 02:42:30.280]
You don't get that channel either doing no.

[02:42:31.080 --> 02:42:31.980]
Well, you lose.

[02:42:32.940 --> 02:42:35.940]
Anyway, here's TRR dark skinless news says on his facts.

[02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:38.640]
My choice would be tied digs from the list.

[02:42:40.040 --> 02:42:41.280]
T-A-Y-E. Am I saying that right?

[02:42:41.420 --> 02:42:41.640]
Tie.

[02:42:42.180 --> 02:42:43.060]
Tie digs.

[02:42:43.360 --> 02:42:44.380]
And Omar Fs.

[02:42:45.980 --> 02:42:47.600]
Tie digs and Omar Fs.

[02:42:48.760 --> 02:42:49.460]
Oh, all the time.

[02:42:50.580 --> 02:42:51.420]
Lauren's fishborne.

[02:42:52.760 --> 02:42:53.640]
Sean Patrick Thomas.

[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:57.220]
Neil Long says they've all been quite a few flicks.

[02:42:57.420 --> 02:42:58.600]
Some are burgeoning superstars.

[02:42:58.760 --> 02:42:59.500]
All our gifted actors.

[02:43:00.180 --> 02:43:02.720]
Doesn't footloose disqualified the lead from this list.

[02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:06.120]
Meaning Kevin Bacon.

[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:10.260]
You can be in a lead and still be underrated.

[02:43:10.740 --> 02:43:12.960]
Kevin Bacon is not in the category with the top actors.

[02:43:13.160 --> 02:43:13.440]
Are you kidding?

[02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:13.680]

[02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:18.900]
In fact, Kevin Bacon to me is the perfect guy for what we're talking about here today.

[02:43:18.940 --> 02:43:19.080]
Right.

[02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:20.660]
A lot of people make fun of him.

[02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:23.080]
He's a laughable guy to a lot of people, but he's a very good actor.

[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:26.540]
Don't be knocking Kevin Bacon, okay?

[02:43:26.780 --> 02:43:27.800]
I was my kind of guy.

[02:43:27.800 --> 02:43:28.980]
Well, not necessarily.

[02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:30.740]
Let's see.

[02:43:31.020 --> 02:43:32.560]
Greatest Lee J. Cobb rule.

[02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:33.300]
Willie Lohm.

[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:34.720]
Oh, my God.

[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:36.020]
Am I slipping or what?

[02:43:36.320 --> 02:43:37.660]
CBS TV in the 60s.

[02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:38.600]
He did death of a salesman.

[02:43:38.700 --> 02:43:39.120]
Willie Lohman.

[02:43:40.320 --> 02:43:42.800]
And more like in the 50s or early 60s.

[02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:45.420]
Had George Siegel in it to his death.

[02:43:45.940 --> 02:43:46.840]
Played Willie Lohman.

[02:43:46.980 --> 02:43:47.540]
Death of a salesman.

[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:48.880]
I'm sure played him on Broadway, right?

[02:43:49.040 --> 02:43:49.660]
Lee J. Cobb.

[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:52.080]
Thank you, Fred.

[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:56.660]
Which one's for that?

[02:43:57.240 --> 02:43:57.640]
It was a bit of a surprise.

[02:43:57.640 --> 02:43:57.720]
What?

[02:43:57.720 --> 02:43:57.920]
I'm sure.

[02:43:57.920 --> 02:43:59.160]
I was just going to ask you that now.

[02:43:59.220 --> 02:43:59.920]
Tie Biggs.

[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:00.520]
Sure.

[02:44:00.940 --> 02:44:02.500]
I have no idea who that is.

[02:44:02.660 --> 02:44:03.320]
T.A.Y.E.

[02:44:03.560 --> 02:44:04.100]
He's black?

[02:44:04.780 --> 02:44:05.140]
Yeah.

[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:07.080]
Black and bald, right?

[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:08.780]
I want a tri-stratford.

[02:44:09.020 --> 02:44:09.880]
He's got a gap between his teeth.

[02:44:09.960 --> 02:44:11.120]
Looks like tri-stratford, right?

[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:13.120]
Well, speaking of a gap between his teeth.

[02:44:13.120 --> 02:44:17.320]
The guy in Chuck and Buck, the guy who was the straight guy that was getting married

[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.720]
that he was being pursued by his former buddy, we say eventually do it by the way.

[02:44:22.940 --> 02:44:23.900]
That's all room to move before you.

[02:44:25.020 --> 02:44:26.640]
He has a gap in his team.

[02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:29.740]
A little unusual to find an actor who's got a gap in his team.

[02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:33.960]
Kind of like Danny Heatley from the Atlanta, whatever your name is.

[02:44:34.040 --> 02:44:36.980]
Huh? I was going to say Atlanta flames. They're the trashers.

[02:44:37.060 --> 02:44:39.080]
Well, you know, these ridiculous franchises.

[02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:40.680]
Hockey's in big trouble, by the way.

[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:41.960]
Anybody care about the playoff?

[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:42.160]
No.

[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:43.920]
Or they in big trouble.

[02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:47.260]
Ottawa and New Jersey, Anaheim and Minnesota.

[02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:48.560]
Oh my God.

[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:50.460]
Gary Petman, kiss it. Goodbye, baby.

[02:44:51.300 --> 02:44:51.920]
Say goodbye.

[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:54.200]
Oh, now what's it? What kind of movie is this?

[02:44:56.260 --> 02:45:01.100]
Looks like an SNM flick to me. He's got that belt out and he's batting this kid on the ass.

[02:45:02.220 --> 02:45:03.600]
Looks like you're kind of movie, George.

[02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.360]
SNM flick. So got a girl, right?

[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:07.520]
No, it's too good.

[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:10.500]
Oh, no, it's not a sex scene. He's like punishing him.

[02:45:10.500 --> 02:45:11.240]
Oh, here comes the chase.

[02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:13.100]
Here comes the girl.

[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:14.080]
I see.

[02:45:14.540 --> 02:45:15.360]
Oh, that's Mama Sita.

[02:45:15.360 --> 02:45:16.140]
Feed up the road.

[02:45:17.980 --> 02:45:18.600]
What is it?

[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:19.720]
Party in your pants?

[02:45:19.960 --> 02:45:20.680]
That's my opinion.

[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:21.560]
I'm like Disney.

[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:22.580]
Yeah, the party's over, Disney.

[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:23.300]
Party's over.

[02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:25.420]
And the rumor we're hearing is it's really boring over there.

[02:45:25.560 --> 02:45:26.800]
It's a common-ducing.

[02:45:26.820 --> 02:45:27.520]
That's my opinion.

[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:28.420]
I'm like Disney.

[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:30.100]
But at least he ain't puking in a waist-basket anymore.

[02:45:30.280 --> 02:45:32.400]
Although he probably did when he saw those numbers come out for party.

[02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:34.340]
Oh, earnest Borg9.

[02:45:34.580 --> 02:45:36.660]
Oh, he won an Academy Award for Marty. That's underrated.

[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:38.860]
Maybe we ought to cross him off of the earnest Borg9, huh?

[02:45:39.580 --> 02:45:40.240]
We put him on there.

[02:45:41.500 --> 02:45:41.860]
Sure.

[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:43.620]
At least I had him on there under George Kennedy.

[02:45:43.960 --> 02:45:44.960]
Did we put him on?

[02:45:45.320 --> 02:45:45.540]
Yes.

[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:47.220]
What do you say?

[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:48.200]
Overrated.

[02:45:48.820 --> 02:45:49.420]
Well, wait a minute.

[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:53.020]
Just because somebody won an Academy Award doesn't mean that, um, huh?

[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:55.160]
How about we take him off just because he sucks?

[02:45:55.840 --> 02:45:56.740]
Get out of here.

[02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:58.640]
You don't like earnest Borg9 and McHale's name?

[02:45:58.880 --> 02:45:59.020]
No, I don't.

[02:45:59.020 --> 02:45:59.400]
I don't need that.

[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:00.000]
I hated that show.

[02:46:00.780 --> 02:46:02.200]
Ernest Borg9 was a good actor.

[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:04.780]
The only problem was he was always Ernest Borg9.

[02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:05.220]
Right?

[02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:06.160]
You know what I mean?

[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:06.840]
Yeah, I know it.

[02:46:06.900 --> 02:46:08.300]
Like I said, take him off of there.

[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:08.820]
Please, immediately.

[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:09.160]
Okay.

[02:46:09.180 --> 02:46:10.620]
Get that message across to Orlando.

[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:12.420]
I don't mean to Orlando.

[02:46:12.520 --> 02:46:13.140]
Yeah, it's good.

[02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:13.860]
After that Orlando.

[02:46:13.860 --> 02:46:15.040]
But I mean to Eric and Orlando.

[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:18.180]
What's wrong with Claude Reigns for the pull?

[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:22.260]
Now Claude Reigns was a, uh, a big star in the 30s and 40s.

[02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:22.720]
You kidding me?

[02:46:23.940 --> 02:46:25.800]
Claude Reigns, it would be like saying, how about Lawrence Olivia?

[02:46:26.080 --> 02:46:27.720]
You know, Claude Reigns was huge.

[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:29.920]
But thanks anyway, Phil and Coral Springs says,

[02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:32.360]
at least you got rid of Houghton and Borg9, and that makes George happy.

[02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:32.880]
Okay?

[02:46:33.140 --> 02:46:34.820]
The facts is they're just freaking in, man.

[02:46:35.140 --> 02:46:36.060]
They're pouring in here.

[02:46:37.080 --> 02:46:39.040]
And of course we're going to have some people out there sing.

[02:46:39.220 --> 02:46:40.360]
They haven't said it yet, but they will.

[02:46:40.560 --> 02:46:41.880]
Oh, too much of this movie stuff.

[02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:43.060]
It's been going on over a week, Neil.

[02:46:43.060 --> 02:46:43.440]
You know what?

[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:43.880]
We like it.

[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:46.080]
We like it.

[02:46:46.160 --> 02:46:47.220]
It's a nice change of pace.

[02:46:47.300 --> 02:46:50.400]
I didn't do too many bedtime stories today just enough to what you're appetite.

[02:46:50.540 --> 02:46:53.560]
To look on our website, NeilRodgers.com and find out what's really going on here.

[02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:55.180]
How about Angelica Houston says somebody?

[02:46:56.160 --> 02:46:58.120]
And you say, I've only ever heard rave reviews about her.

[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.120]
I don't know if that makes her, uh, overrated, underrated or just right?

[02:47:02.640 --> 02:47:03.780]
I would say just right.

[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:04.280]
Okay.

[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:04.940]
Angelica Houston.

[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:05.800]
I just wrote it down.

[02:47:05.900 --> 02:47:06.240]
Angelica.

[02:47:06.300 --> 02:47:08.080]
Is that how you spell it with an A and J?

[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:08.640]
Whatever.

[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:10.660]
ELICA and Angelica Houston.

[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:11.740]
Well, that's how we're spelled.

[02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:13.620]
I don't know if you're okay, whether it's right or not, because we don't really care about

[02:47:13.620 --> 02:47:15.760]
spelling, even though Eric is very, very picky about it.

[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.420]
And if we ever misspell anything because B.

[02:47:17.420 --> 02:47:20.960]
Nibor gives wrong information, he calls and starts bitching him out big time, which I like.

[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:21.680]
A lot of actors.

[02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:26.960]
In fact, I wouldn't, you know how many tens he's called him already today?

[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:27.820]
A third man.

[02:47:27.920 --> 02:47:28.480]
That's what I'm hearing.

[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:30.120]
That's the rumor up here.

[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:31.620]
It's all over town.

[02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:35.040]
Change Spaders got 10 votes, you little faith.

[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:36.000]
How do you like that, huh?

[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:38.420]
The most underrated actor or actress of all time.

[02:47:39.660 --> 02:47:43.040]
You just don't like him, so therefore, you know, I mean, like Sean Penn.

[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:46.860]
I never liked him that much, but he was damn good in this movie last night in the game.

[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:47.480]
He's right.

[02:47:47.580 --> 02:47:48.520]
You've got to see the game.

[02:47:48.700 --> 02:47:49.000]
I will.

[02:47:50.680 --> 02:47:52.840]
Three movies you must see this week.

[02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:57.520]
Happiness, even though I know it's illegal in South Florida.

[02:47:57.980 --> 02:48:00.420]
Happiness, the game and American psycho.

[02:48:01.380 --> 02:48:01.780]
Pussyco.

[02:48:02.620 --> 02:48:03.020]
Pussyco.

[02:48:03.560 --> 02:48:03.560]

[02:48:05.900 --> 02:48:10.160]
There will not be one of those three that you won't say outstanding, out-epping standing.

[02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:14.500]
And if you get like a little spirit time, talking bucks, sucking, good luck.

[02:48:16.140 --> 02:48:17.280]
Isn't that the other part of it?

[02:48:17.320 --> 02:48:17.580]
Good luck.

[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:19.620]
Take a truck and good luck.

[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.840]
And in hockey, we shoot the puck at Knucks.

[02:48:23.340 --> 02:48:24.780]
And let's play the thing about Donald Duck.

[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:27.000]
27 past noon at 560.

[02:48:27.120 --> 02:48:29.560]
Well, let's see our government in action for you, baby, the word police.

[02:48:29.700 --> 02:48:32.200]
And now we've got the terrorized Canada over to pot laws police.

[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:33.320]
Oh, brother.

[02:48:34.160 --> 02:48:35.320]
The bully of the world.

[02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:37.240]
USA, USA to bully the world.

[02:48:37.260 --> 02:48:38.380]
I want to get in shouted down.

[02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:38.760]
It's good.

[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:39.960]
I think it's a pretty good.

[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:43.480]
I think he's going to get his ass whipped worse in next year's election than Danny did in 1992.

[02:48:44.560 --> 02:48:45.540]
I really believe that.

[02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:46.980]
We got everything crossed in here.

[02:48:47.680 --> 02:48:51.500]
Crossing my legs, my eyes, my nose, my ears, my toes.

[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:56.300]
I got my legs crossed so tight now that my nuts are like, uh, inner vice.

[02:48:57.320 --> 02:49:00.140]
In fact, even if I don't do that, the way things are going in the US right now,

[02:49:00.320 --> 02:49:01.520]
all of our nuts are pretty much an advice.

[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:03.340]
Although the market's zooming up today.

[02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:04.520]
Let's hear it.

[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:08.840]
You know, we got this rampant unemployment in the dollars worth about 50 cent everywhere else.

[02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:13.580]
I'll tell you right now, speaking of price, one place you won't get ripped off and that's dry concepts.

[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:17.980]
Most carpet cleaning companies are notorious for giving you one price before they start working.

[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:21.680]
And then when they get that, oh, and by the way, we got to add this on and that on.

[02:49:21.920 --> 02:49:23.560]
They come up with these per room scams.

[02:49:23.720 --> 02:49:26.840]
You know, they tell you how much per room and then at the end of the job, they'd like double or triple it.

[02:49:27.480 --> 02:49:32.480]
Not with dry concepts, they give you a written guaranteed price before they start cleaning your carpets.

[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:37.280]
They roll up their sleeves, they dry clean your carpets and your furniture and your pulse green, all your good stuff.

[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:38.900]
And they make them look just like brand new.

[02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:42.820]
And you don't have to worry about it, robust because like I said, you got the price right up front before they start to work.

[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:48.540]
So whether it's your carpeting, your draper, your expensive area rugs, your oriental rugs, your leather furniture, whatever it might be.

[02:49:48.720 --> 02:49:51.680]
Dry concepts will make them all look just like brand spank and do it a very fair price.

[02:49:52.080 --> 02:49:54.040]
And at a job, the which nobody else can duplicate.

[02:49:54.040 --> 02:49:56.140]
Believe me, that's why I've used them for over 20 years in my house.

[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:01.300]
Even all my picky relatives and everybody I know uses dry concepts, you will absolutely fall in love with these people.

[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:02.320]
Call them toll free.

[02:50:02.440 --> 02:50:04.620]
Don't forget that your carpets are drying a couple of hours.

[02:50:04.620 --> 02:50:07.720]
They smell and they fresh and you're ready to go on with life in no time at all.

[02:50:08.100 --> 02:50:10.240]
1-800-248-5071.

[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:11.540]
That's the toll free number from anywhere.

[02:50:12.140 --> 02:50:14.140]
1-800-248-5071.

[02:50:14.420 --> 02:50:17.060]
You can check out their website if you're like a dry concept.com.

[02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.260]
And it'd be the truth when we tell you with dry concepts you can clean today and entertain tonight.

[02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:23.400]
5-6-6-8-10.

[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:23.540]
5-6-6-8-10.

[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:26.460]
We're sports radio 560, she-8-10.

[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:27.520]
She-8-10.

[02:50:29.220 --> 02:50:29.740]
NEO.

[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:35.900]
If you've had a heart attack or a stroke, the last thing you need is another one sneaking up on you.

[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.380]
Oh! You've got better things to do.

[02:50:38.500 --> 02:50:40.360]
I can't have a stroke!

[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:41.680]
Football's on!

[02:50:42.160 --> 02:50:47.720]
Flavix is proven to help keep blood platelets from sticking together and forming clots, which helps keep your blood flowing.

[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:51.440]
Yeah! It really helps when my blood keeps on flowing!

[02:50:51.660 --> 02:50:54.440]
Side effects include itching, rash, diarrhea, and bruising.

[02:50:54.500 --> 02:50:57.860]
Damn it! I messed all over my bruised itchy rash!

[02:50:58.200 --> 02:51:01.440]
Find out if Flavix can help protect you from another heart attack or stroke.

[02:51:01.700 --> 02:51:04.120]
It's working. I'm taking my Flavix every day. I should point out.

[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:06.000]
Aren't you pleased with that?

[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:06.380]

[02:51:06.380 --> 02:51:06.740]
Excited.

[02:51:07.220 --> 02:51:08.080]
And I'm still alive.

[02:51:08.660 --> 02:51:12.720]
1231 at 560 WQA and Bush Allys said to profit from the war on terror.

[02:51:12.880 --> 02:51:15.100]
This is a story about, uh, it was on our website yesterday, do we?

[02:51:15.100 --> 02:51:15.780]
Wasn't it, Vener?

[02:51:16.880 --> 02:51:19.280]
Yeah, about James Wolsey, former CI boss, and influential.

[02:51:19.420 --> 02:51:22.340]
The guy that says we're in WW4 and everybody better look out.

[02:51:24.420 --> 02:51:27.680]
Is Director of a US firm aiming to make millions of dollars from the war on terror?

[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.460]
This is in the British Observer newspaper.

[02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:35.080]
Wolsey, one of the most high profile hawks in the war against Iraq and a key member of the Pentagon's Defense Policy Board,

[02:51:35.440 --> 02:51:39.080]
is Director of the Washington-based Private Equity firm Paladin Capital.

[02:51:41.140 --> 02:51:44.620]
Paladin, which is expected to raise $300 million from investors by the end of this year,

[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:46.020]
calculates it in the next few years.

[02:51:46.100 --> 02:51:50.860]
The US government will spend $60 billion on anti-terrorism that would not have been spent before 9-11.

[02:51:52.680 --> 02:51:58.120]
The involvement of one of the most prominent hawks in Washington with a company standing in cash in on the fears of potential terror attacks

[02:51:58.120 --> 02:51:59.680]
will raise eyebrows in some quarters.

[02:52:00.340 --> 02:52:03.440]
And it goes on about how Wolfe, which in Wolsey, the European 2000, in memory,

[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:06.560]
argue the case for links existing between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda,

[02:52:06.560 --> 02:52:10.520]
which by the way, we still don't have those now, more phony, below any documents.

[02:52:11.340 --> 02:52:12.820]
I just mentioned those things in passing.

[02:52:12.820 --> 02:52:13.880]
You can read it on our website.

[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:16.040]
So what do we got?

[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:23.040]
We got the latest ones we added were Jack Black, Alan Arkin, John C. Riley, Ty Diggs, Robert Shaw, Tim Curry,

[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:26.140]
Kid Curry, and Jelike Houston.

[02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:29.320]
Yeah, you like Curry?

[02:52:30.100 --> 02:52:31.300]
No, I don't, actually.

[02:52:31.300 --> 02:52:33.740]
Actually, I do like it, but it tears my stomach up.

[02:52:33.920 --> 02:52:37.340]
Remember I used to tell you about that great time restaurant I was eating at when I first came up here last year?

[02:52:37.540 --> 02:52:39.540]
What I don't like is that you taste it for a week afterwards.

[02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:41.200]
Yeah.

[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:43.180]
There's some other things like that too.

[02:52:43.840 --> 02:52:44.200]
Yellow, what?

[02:52:44.800 --> 02:52:47.160]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Chuck and Buck.

[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:51.040]
Who coughed it?

[02:52:51.200 --> 02:52:51.940]
Contact the one, right?

[02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:54.580]
Light comes on.

[02:52:54.940 --> 02:52:56.060]
And we'll find a nice fit.

[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:57.440]
Find a nice fit.

[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:00.900]
Find a nice fit.

[02:53:00.900 --> 02:53:01.760]
What is that?

[02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:02.860]
That's how it's familiar.

[02:53:03.400 --> 02:53:04.260]
It's a series.

[02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:08.560]
It's on the IFC.

[02:53:08.760 --> 02:53:10.000]
It's in a repeat of the series opener.

[02:53:10.220 --> 02:53:11.820]
Commitment phobic Adam meets Shelley.

[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:16.760]
Father to be peat deals with his insatiable pregnant wife David Cercliffe and Jean Louise Kelly.

[02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:19.620]
Yeah, it's right.

[02:53:19.740 --> 02:53:19.980]
I don't know.

[02:53:20.020 --> 02:53:20.480]
Put that on her.

[02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5.

[02:53:22.220 --> 02:53:26.220]
Well, they have a lot of like pornographic stuff on here and a lot of ex-rated language and stuff.

[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:29.400]
And we don't want to be a little annoyed there because Tom Jickel right now they're column.

[02:53:29.400 --> 02:53:30.420]
And we said crap.

[02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:32.220]
Here it is.

[02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:33.780]
It's after 1230 already.

[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:36.980]
Did we have one call, one spy report on that jickel show for a night?

[02:53:37.020 --> 02:53:37.140]
No.

[02:53:37.240 --> 02:53:38.140]
It's a nothing must have happened.

[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:39.600]
You know, you didn't get the facts.

[02:53:39.600 --> 02:53:40.400]
I facked you about it.

[02:53:40.680 --> 02:53:41.000]
No.

[02:53:41.200 --> 02:53:42.840]
That fell through the facts cracks.

[02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:45.800]
Why did you actually send me one?

[02:53:46.120 --> 02:53:47.340]
Yeah, let me dig through it.

[02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:49.040]
Oh, you better dig through and send to me again.

[02:53:49.100 --> 02:53:52.000]
I must have been during that period of time when you were equipping with screwed up down there.

[02:53:52.120 --> 02:53:52.900]
I never got one facts.

[02:53:54.180 --> 02:53:55.980]
But I'm not surprised by anything anymore.

[02:53:56.060 --> 02:53:56.840]
Here's a call from Jupiter.

[02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:57.140]
Hello.

[02:53:58.040 --> 02:53:58.660]
Yes, hello.

[02:53:58.660 --> 02:53:59.540]
Yes, sir.

[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:02.780]
I should say good afternoon.

[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:04.280]
I started glowing in the morning.

[02:54:04.740 --> 02:54:07.020]
I have a lot of things that I wrote down.

[02:54:07.140 --> 02:54:14.880]
First of all, the movie business has conducted a poll approximately a year and a half ago,

[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:18.580]
dealing with the best watched movies over and over.

[02:54:19.340 --> 02:54:21.820]
And number one was the Rocky Horror movie show.

[02:54:22.160 --> 02:54:22.300]
Right.

[02:54:22.520 --> 02:54:25.860]
And number two was Casablanca, which surprised me.

[02:54:25.860 --> 02:54:37.460]
But I'd like to mention that NBC, there will be a special, a two hour special, on the 50 greatest heroes, movie heroes,

[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:44.520]
and the 50 greatest villains in the movies, on June 3rd, on NBC.

[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:45.300]
Okay.

[02:54:45.420 --> 02:54:46.520]
But that might be interesting.

[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:55.620]
George had mentioned something approximately a year ago, dealing with the scariest guys in a movie.

[02:54:56.220 --> 02:55:01.140]
And I have my two people that you've never seen in the movie.

[02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:02.180]
Maybe you should.

[02:55:02.900 --> 02:55:05.120]
Robert Mitchum in Night of the Hunter.

[02:55:06.140 --> 02:55:06.720]
Did you ever see that?

[02:55:06.780 --> 02:55:07.520]
I never saw it now.

[02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:12.040]
And Robert Montgomery in Night Must Fall.

[02:55:12.580 --> 02:55:13.780]
They were the scariest.

[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:17.500]
I have a couple other things if you don't mind.

[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:17.980]
Go ahead.

[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:24.620]
I have a character actors here.

[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:29.900]
By the way, I'd like to mention them, recommend a movie to you that I saw a couple times,

[02:55:29.900 --> 02:55:31.640]
and I think it's one of the greatest movies.

[02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:36.940]
But it was Pan than Pan because of overruns in the cost.

[02:55:37.700 --> 02:55:40.440]
And that was Michael Semenos, Heaven's Gate.

[02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:41.260]
Did you ever see it?

[02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:41.780]
No.

[02:55:42.340 --> 02:55:43.400]
Did you ever hear of it?

[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:44.020]
Yeah.

[02:55:44.960 --> 02:55:47.160]
It's really, I really recommend seeing it.

[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:48.080]
It's a great movie.

[02:55:49.880 --> 02:55:52.000]
By the way, I do like your laugh.

[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:54.680]
You're not on about George's, but I like your laugh.

[02:55:54.940 --> 02:55:58.600]
And Mark Twain said, you can tell a nice man by the way he laughs.

[02:55:59.060 --> 02:55:59.240]
I don't know.

[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:00.600]
Well, I always say I'm a nice man.

[02:56:00.700 --> 02:56:01.240]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:56:01.460 --> 02:56:02.960]
Okay. One other thing, if you don't mind.

[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:03.640]
In closing, yes.

[02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:07.120]
I do have character actors that I've listed down.

[02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:08.300]
My favorites.

[02:56:09.300 --> 02:56:20.600]
Fritz Weaver, Frank Morgan, James Earl Jones, Thomas Mitchell, Albert Decker, Edmund O'Brien,

[02:56:21.200 --> 02:56:29.300]
Walter Brennan, Eliza Cook Jr., Adam Tamiroff, and Regis Toomey.

[02:56:30.040 --> 02:56:30.600]
Okay. Thanks.

[02:56:31.060 --> 02:56:31.180]
Right.

[02:56:31.620 --> 02:56:31.940]
See you.

[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:32.860]
That's it.

[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:34.560]
Where you stopped.

[02:56:35.380 --> 02:56:36.220]
5, 6, 7, over.

[02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:39.380]
He was, uh, to go ahead and tell the guy to the list and let's go a little bit ponderous

[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:39.600]
all over.

[02:56:39.700 --> 02:56:40.400]
I didn't get that music.

[02:56:40.540 --> 02:56:41.380]
I got to love the music.

[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:42.060]
Uh-huh.

[02:56:42.240 --> 02:56:43.440]
I'm going to be on television.

[02:56:45.680 --> 02:56:47.440]
The scene where they all come inside.

[02:56:47.720 --> 02:56:51.240]
I mean, you know, I take back what I said about renaming that movie, Requiem, for Dream.

[02:56:51.320 --> 02:56:51.800]
It shouldn't be.

[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:52.840]
So you think you got troubles.

[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:55.640]
That could be one name, but the other could be Life in South Florida.

[02:56:56.720 --> 02:56:57.160]
No, no.

[02:56:57.380 --> 02:56:57.520]
Yeah.

[02:56:57.620 --> 02:57:00.900]
Seriously, that's why it's so important that everybody who lives or is even visiting South

[02:57:00.900 --> 02:57:06.620]
Florida, see that movie because South Florida being the drug capital of the western world.

[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:11.320]
And also, I'm talking about illegal street drugs and also being the drug capital of the

[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:13.700]
world in terms of senior citizens who are all drugged up.

[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:15.880]
And I also hold the lonely desperate people.

[02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:16.980]
Very sad.

[02:57:18.380 --> 02:57:21.620]
I'm going to be on television and they all come in and she's looking to stamp.

[02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:23.080]
She gets her package from the mailman.

[02:57:23.080 --> 02:57:25.720]
She fills it out and they tell her how to spell her name.

[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:27.500]
Sarah Goldfarb just spelling it out.

[02:57:28.040 --> 02:57:34.820]
And she writes it out and then she puts it in the envelope and puts the stamp on it and they all march with her right down to the mail box.

[02:57:35.300 --> 02:57:37.360]
Like, like, ducks following the mother.

[02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:38.800]
No, it really is sad.

[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:45.080]
In fact, that movie, that part of it, anyway, shows you the fallacy of the whole concept of this condo life in South Florida.

[02:57:45.440 --> 02:57:47.460]
You don't find that almost any place else, right?

[02:57:47.900 --> 02:57:49.060]
Haven't I talked about that for years?

[02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:52.460]
You go to like any large city and you go to any part of town.

[02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:54.500]
There's old people and young people in between.

[02:57:54.500 --> 02:57:55.840]
Not in South Florida.

[02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:58.240]
All the condo commandos.

[02:57:58.320 --> 02:57:59.760]
It's the whole concept of life there.

[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:02.880]
You go to like some rise lakes and everybody's over the age of 100.

[02:58:02.960 --> 02:58:04.060]
You go to certain parts of Hollywood.

[02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:05.340]
Everybody's over the age of 100.

[02:58:05.560 --> 02:58:09.500]
You don't find that in LA or in New York or Chicago or Detroit or Philadelphia.

[02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:10.980]
Anywhere.

[02:58:11.040 --> 02:58:11.040]

[02:58:11.760 --> 02:58:16.460]
I mean, you'll find like Sun City in Tucson or I'm talking about in a major metropolitan area.

[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:18.180]
And again, it comes back to that fallacy.

[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:19.840]
Kill that music. It's giving me psychotic.

[02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:22.060]
Let's see.

[02:58:22.200 --> 02:58:22.680]
Here's the facts.

[02:58:22.880 --> 02:58:26.260]
You've got to get the tape of Ed Kaplan's show around 1250.

[02:58:26.660 --> 02:58:28.240]
Tom Jic actually ripped you an ass.

[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:30.380]
Perifraise.

[02:58:30.440 --> 02:58:32.800]
Hey, how about those mighty ducks worth they put together by Brian Murray,

[02:58:32.940 --> 02:58:33.480]
the same Brian Murray.

[02:58:33.580 --> 02:58:34.640]
We know Roger's real about it, Tom.

[02:58:34.880 --> 02:58:37.160]
Because Murray supposedly didn't know as much about hockey as Neil.

[02:58:37.520 --> 02:58:39.380]
Well, let me tell you this, Tom Jic, right now.

[02:58:39.540 --> 02:58:42.820]
Okay. Brian Murray almost single-handedly destroyed a Florida Panther franchise.

[02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:45.880]
And the fact that his team got real hot at the right time now.

[02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:47.820]
Just like the Panthers got real hot at the right time.

[02:58:47.820 --> 02:58:49.060]
And what if Alice had to do with anything?

[02:58:50.260 --> 02:58:52.960]
It says, well, nobody knows as much about hockey as much as Neil, right?

[02:58:53.060 --> 02:58:54.860]
Nobody knows about as much anything as Neil does.

[02:58:54.940 --> 02:58:56.880]
Do they all, Tom, must have gotten to your time.

[02:58:57.020 --> 02:58:57.300]
All right.

[02:58:58.380 --> 02:59:03.220]
Then he brought up some usage of the word Schmidt word by you and some unconvincing response you had, et cetera.

[02:59:03.540 --> 02:59:04.520]
What this had to do with sports.

[02:59:04.520 --> 02:59:06.160]
I don't know. It seems like he wanted to pile on.

[02:59:06.380 --> 02:59:07.660]
None of this was started by a call.

[02:59:07.660 --> 02:59:08.600]
He just brought it up himself.

[02:59:09.460 --> 02:59:13.200]
Oh, yeah. He did an imitation of the sound, but you play about him as in he's balled in these stupid.

[02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:14.160]
Might make a nice drop in.

[02:59:14.940 --> 02:59:15.680]
How do you like that?

[02:59:15.680 --> 02:59:19.660]
So little Tommy used his opportunity on the ear like a rip back.

[02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:25.400]
But the fact of the matter is you can't take the heat time because you don't write about local radio or TV.

[02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:28.920]
And the only thing you ever wrote about, which I'm not looking just about me.

[02:59:29.020 --> 02:59:34.340]
There's a city and other things going on like the Mr. Ego controversy always got more than enough coverage on that.

[02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:35.980]
But you write nothing.

[02:59:37.760 --> 02:59:41.460]
In addition to which you can ask all the Panther fans what they thought about Brian Murray.

[02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:42.460]
They'll tell you the same thing.

[02:59:42.460 --> 02:59:44.060]
I wasn't the only one with the no B M buttons.

[02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:45.380]
We know what they all he did to the franchise.

[02:59:45.640 --> 02:59:50.100]
You can make one hell of a contending team with the people that he dumped out of there.

[02:59:52.840 --> 03:00:01.580]
I mean, that's a sad day in hell when a guy's got to go on here and make a case for Brian Murray because his team got hot just at the right time before to play offs, which is what the playoffs and hockey are really all about.

[03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:04.800]
Shame on you little Tommy, but I'm really glad I'm getting to him.

[03:00:04.840 --> 03:00:05.160]
That's good.

[03:00:06.700 --> 03:00:08.680]
Because the fact of the matter speaks for itself.

[03:00:08.680 --> 03:00:11.400]
And did he write anything about your Williams or Dick Casper?

[03:00:11.660 --> 03:00:13.620]
Anything else has been going on the market and you want to know why?

[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:15.020]
Because you're lazy Tom.

[03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:16.040]
You're lazy.

[03:00:16.600 --> 03:00:21.260]
If you're supposed to be writing about radio and TV, which I didn't know you were writing about hockey these days, but that's okay.

[03:00:21.360 --> 03:00:22.040]
We can use an upgrade.

[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:26.420]
But if you're writing about radio and TV, you should know what else going on in local radio and TV.

[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:30.200]
And you don't seem to be too well aware, too much in touch, even though I'm the one who's not a touch.

[03:00:30.460 --> 03:00:31.740]
And I must also frost his ass.

[03:00:32.020 --> 03:00:33.500]
I'll guarantee he didn't change his tune.

[03:00:33.540 --> 03:00:34.780]
I want to hear a year ago.

[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:40.680]
About how I'm going to touch it and how is he going to do this and how's he going to do that?

[03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:41.960]
Yadi, yadi, yadi, I remember that.

[03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:48.300]
How do we just get this big book that came out, which is also radio TV news, which he didn't write a word about it to the best of my knowledge.

[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:50.180]
Did he write anything about the ratings that we know of?

[03:00:50.440 --> 03:00:50.600]
No.

[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:51.160]
Oh.

[03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:53.700]
I love it.

[03:00:54.180 --> 03:00:55.560]
Sam Clayton, you dug that out of the pile again.

[03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:59.780]
1241-19-1 at 560-WDQM.

[03:00:59.780 --> 03:01:04.640]
And if you're in a dead end job, like for a little Tommy there, writing about all those puff pieces about network TV shows,

[03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:51.960]
And law.

[03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:54.340]
This is Fort Lauderdale by 60.

[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:56.180]
You ain't way too way.

[03:01:58.120 --> 03:01:59.440]
This is Tom Jekker.

[03:01:59.740 --> 03:02:03.400]
If you just passed along to Neil and Mayup, but the reason I call was that I thought maybe you could help me out.

[03:02:03.600 --> 03:02:05.200]
I've been trying to get those goddamn ratings.

[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:06.940]
Tough Lindsey's gone home sick.

[03:02:07.220 --> 03:02:09.660]
Gosh, Darryl says he doesn't have to be authority to give him to me.

[03:02:10.020 --> 03:02:11.680]
You know, call a Greg Reed, I couldn't get him.

[03:02:12.160 --> 03:02:15.060]
So, you know, and then the last number they gave me was to call you.

[03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:18.440]
If somebody would get me the goddamn ratings, I'll pay the king his homage.

[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:23.120]
Anyway, I'm only kidding, but that is the problem that I do want to do a story on.

[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:24.620]
And then I'm just having trouble getting them.

[03:02:24.660 --> 03:02:25.640]
So, I'll talk to you later.

[03:02:25.660 --> 03:02:25.660]

[03:02:30.260 --> 03:02:31.460]
I'm down a little climbing.

[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:32.500]
Everything will be fine.

[03:02:36.440 --> 03:02:42.740]
I make some pass with my badass sitting down watching the views.

[03:02:43.740 --> 03:02:50.520]
I just don't want to use my brain or the feelings by old years.

[03:02:51.980 --> 03:02:58.200]
I say all smiles go smudged in on the pundits that I see.

[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:02.440]
Like a pops and friends, I believe they're my friends.

[03:03:02.780 --> 03:03:05.540]
And they're really care about me.

[03:03:07.740 --> 03:03:09.220]
I know it's true.

[03:03:10.900 --> 03:03:13.020]
It's been seen too.

[03:03:15.220 --> 03:03:18.340]
Got a star at all, baby.

[03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:27.700]
I know that man, there in the white house has the goodness of the Lord.

[03:03:29.020 --> 03:03:32.180]
I lost my job, my money's gone.

[03:03:32.720 --> 03:03:34.960]
That's what I've been playing for.

[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:39.540]
They came for my family.

[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:45.400]
I'll say it's not a great, but I have toughen the hat.

[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:50.420]
So I should be alright until they come for me.

[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:54.300]
I know it's true.

[03:03:56.180 --> 03:03:58.020]
It's been seen too.

[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:03.340]
Got a star at all, baby.

[03:04:07.520 --> 03:04:09.240]
I've got the proof.

[03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:13.400]
And the face is true.

[03:04:15.260 --> 03:04:18.040]
Got the star at all, baby.

[03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:22.500]
Look at that.

[03:04:22.940 --> 03:04:24.100]
Look at that.

[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:31.420]
I'm looking at that picture with Jose Santos on funny side.

[03:04:31.420 --> 03:04:34.780]
And a little thing in his hand, it looks like it says Ray O'Vac on it.

[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:36.820]
Do you think there's any significance in that?

[03:04:37.260 --> 03:04:37.520]
No.

[03:04:37.800 --> 03:04:39.360]
Of course, I don't know nothing about there, but racing.

[03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:41.120]
Any more, and I'll be the first one to admit that.

[03:04:41.340 --> 03:04:42.280]
Although I do know about batteries.

[03:04:43.460 --> 03:04:44.760]
But then again, little Tommy there.

[03:04:44.960 --> 03:04:46.760]
I didn't hear it myself.

[03:04:46.980 --> 03:04:47.840]
I'm just judging that I won.

[03:04:48.200 --> 03:04:49.320]
Evidently, I must have gotten to him.

[03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:49.760]
Good.

[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:50.540]
Good.

[03:04:50.540 --> 03:04:51.200]
That's a good start.

[03:04:53.120 --> 03:05:00.740]
I mean, if you're going to write about radio and TV, at least understand what the FCC ruling is on the seven words in about language and indecency and obscenity, understand that.

[03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:05.120]
Understand how they change it as they go along like the finds that they live out, which we've ahead of taste of.

[03:05:05.420 --> 03:05:06.640]
Understand what it's all about, Tom.

[03:05:08.020 --> 03:05:08.620]
But no.

[03:05:08.880 --> 03:05:10.640]
Anyway, here's the fact that spelled in corrections.

[03:05:10.820 --> 03:05:12.320]
Boy, this is pretty embarrassing, Eric.

[03:05:12.840 --> 03:05:13.620]
I mean, Vener, boy.

[03:05:14.520 --> 03:05:17.880]
Peter Laurie, we have spelled L-A-U-R-I-E.

[03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:19.060]
Oh, that Laurie.

[03:05:19.300 --> 03:05:20.080]
Laurie London.

[03:05:20.320 --> 03:05:21.660]
He's got the whole world.

[03:05:22.540 --> 03:05:24.300]
Peter Laurie, L-O-R-R-E.

[03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:25.500]
Did you get these spelling corrections?

[03:05:26.220 --> 03:05:26.820]
He is now.

[03:05:27.200 --> 03:05:29.740]
And it's George Kennedy with a G, not with a J.

[03:05:29.940 --> 03:05:33.460]
I realize that this is a heavy esponial staff we got here.

[03:05:34.860 --> 03:05:38.180]
George Kennedy with a G, not with a Jorge Kennedy.

[03:05:38.420 --> 03:05:39.260]
Oh my God.

[03:05:40.020 --> 03:05:40.780]
I could be wrong.

[03:05:40.780 --> 03:05:43.700]
But I do not think that one was me.

[03:05:44.200 --> 03:05:47.880]
Chlorist Leachman, L-E-A, not L-E-E, not Leach like in a blood sucker.

[03:05:48.200 --> 03:05:48.440]
Why not?

[03:05:49.820 --> 03:05:51.380]
Because that's not how she spells it.

[03:05:52.140 --> 03:05:54.180]
Here are a few says this Tim Roth.

[03:05:54.780 --> 03:05:55.500]
Who's Tim Roth?

[03:05:56.260 --> 03:05:58.980]
He was in a whole bunch of things.

[03:05:59.480 --> 03:06:00.220]
Was he a reservoir dog?

[03:06:00.460 --> 03:06:01.340]
He was in reservoir dogs.

[03:06:01.720 --> 03:06:02.820]
He was saying, Bishem, I think.

[03:06:03.320 --> 03:06:03.740]
I get them confused.

[03:06:03.820 --> 03:06:06.280]
He's my vote for the overrated list, but what do I know?

[03:06:06.440 --> 03:06:06.640]
Really?

[03:06:07.060 --> 03:06:07.200]
Yeah.

[03:06:07.560 --> 03:06:08.440]
Well, let's not put him on her.

[03:06:08.440 --> 03:06:10.140]
Because on this fact, he got three other ones.

[03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:10.980]
Tom, sorry.

[03:06:11.020 --> 03:06:12.840]
Which I thought we put on earlier and we didn't do it.

[03:06:13.400 --> 03:06:13.800]
I guess not.

[03:06:14.160 --> 03:06:14.840]
I thought we did.

[03:06:16.700 --> 03:06:17.660]
Tom, you scared it.

[03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:18.380]
Maybe you pursued it.

[03:06:19.120 --> 03:06:20.240]
SKERR-I-T-T.

[03:06:20.240 --> 03:06:21.100]
You got it, Fiener.

[03:06:21.500 --> 03:06:21.760]
Do it out.

[03:06:22.740 --> 03:06:24.960]
Ed Vins from 12 Angry Men, Patton and the verdict.

[03:06:25.060 --> 03:06:25.960]
He was the bishop in the verdict.

[03:06:26.100 --> 03:06:27.220]
Ed Vins, V-I-N-N-S.

[03:06:27.980 --> 03:06:29.480]
And James Gregory, the Joe McCarthy,

[03:06:29.760 --> 03:06:30.880]
won a big in the Manchurian Kennedy.

[03:06:31.220 --> 03:06:32.100]
There's three good ones for you.

[03:06:32.120 --> 03:06:33.100]
We'll just pass on Tim Roth.

[03:06:33.100 --> 03:06:33.620]
We'll ask for it again.

[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:34.700]
I beg your pardon.

[03:06:35.000 --> 03:06:36.060]
The last one after Ed Vins.

[03:06:36.060 --> 03:06:38.280]
James Gregory, in a relation to Jeff Gregory,

[03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:39.300]
the harness racing driver,

[03:06:39.480 --> 03:06:40.800]
a young cousin, formerly a pompadopark.

[03:06:42.200 --> 03:06:42.860]
Oh, that's right.

[03:06:42.960 --> 03:06:44.320]
I don't know nothing about that either, Tommy.

[03:06:44.860 --> 03:06:45.640]
I love it.

[03:06:45.720 --> 03:06:47.200]
The fact that we actually got to rise out of him.

[03:06:47.260 --> 03:06:49.420]
But there could have been too many people listening on the other night.

[03:06:51.540 --> 03:06:52.080]
Do you think?

[03:06:53.020 --> 03:06:53.560]
No, never.

[03:06:54.920 --> 03:06:57.480]
F-I-N-I'm talking about when Jicke was on on a Friday night.

[03:06:57.500 --> 03:06:58.340]
F-I-T-T-Man.

[03:06:58.500 --> 03:06:59.640]
I was, he was following Marlon baseball.

[03:06:59.840 --> 03:07:00.280]
What does that say?

[03:07:00.440 --> 03:07:00.480]
Oh.

[03:07:00.640 --> 03:07:01.280]
Nice going, Tommy.

[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:03.040]
Stand up and be a man.

[03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:03.480]
Be counted.

[03:07:03.480 --> 03:07:05.420]
5'6'7'05'60,

[03:07:05.580 --> 03:07:07.220]
Pound 5'60' on the AT&T line.

[03:07:07.640 --> 03:07:10.600]
The most underrated movie actor actress of all times, Steve Buscemi.

[03:07:11.520 --> 03:07:11.980]
34.

[03:07:13.580 --> 03:07:14.900]

[03:07:15.160 --> 03:07:16.100]

Eli Wallach, 8.

[03:07:35.160 --> 03:07:37.180]
Hurry up and eat another canola before it's too late, Eli.

[03:07:37.540 --> 03:07:39.320]
I thought we could reason together.

[03:07:42.040 --> 03:07:44.220]
Easily the worst acting performance.

[03:07:44.440 --> 03:07:47.820]
And then when he goes to see the assassin and his mule sounding son there.

[03:07:49.040 --> 03:07:49.980]
Ah, Cape Pane.

[03:07:51.260 --> 03:07:53.280]
The dialogue is so ludicrous.

[03:07:53.480 --> 03:07:54.780]
I mean, Cape Pane.

[03:07:54.980 --> 03:07:55.600]
Oh, yo, leave.

[03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:57.800]
Man.

[03:07:58.100 --> 03:07:58.880]
So what will Nespina?

[03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:01.480]

Cloris Leachman, 6.

[03:08:05.780 --> 03:08:06.720]
Peter Laurie's got 5.

[03:08:06.720 --> 03:08:08.140]
We got the spelling straight down on that.

[03:08:08.460 --> 03:08:09.580]
Parents stamp his got 4.

[03:08:09.780 --> 03:08:10.820]
Ten Curry's got 4.

[03:08:11.160 --> 03:08:12.100]
Kid Curry don't have any.

[03:08:12.740 --> 03:08:14.480]
Laurie Dernford, Devine's got 3.

[03:08:14.580 --> 03:08:15.360]
How about Andy Devine?

[03:08:15.720 --> 03:08:17.120]
Plunk your magic twanger, Froggy.

[03:08:17.960 --> 03:08:19.300]
John Kazell's only got 3?

[03:08:21.060 --> 03:08:23.980]
Oh my, John Kazell's only got 3 votes.

[03:08:23.980 --> 03:08:24.700]
Are you kidding me?

[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:25.760]
That's the pressing.

[03:08:25.760 --> 03:08:27.640]
I'm going to give you a thing, don't smile.

[03:08:28.320 --> 03:08:31.040]
I'm going to give you a thing, don't smile.

[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:32.040]

[03:08:32.040 --> 03:08:32.860]
And I want to spend.

[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:33.300]
Yeah.

[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:36.060]
And you know where we go to get respect, don't you?

[03:08:37.640 --> 03:08:38.000]
Yeah.

[03:08:38.440 --> 03:08:39.780]
See, I can't figure out what these are.

[03:08:39.880 --> 03:08:40.460]
What these are.

[03:08:40.540 --> 03:08:40.900]
Oh, yeah.

[03:08:41.740 --> 03:08:44.060]
No, seriously, I can't figure out what the hell these are listed at.

[03:08:44.120 --> 03:08:45.120]
That's probably because Beener Boyle,

[03:08:45.120 --> 03:08:49.060]
which we appreciate the hard work, but, uh, I don't know.

[03:08:49.640 --> 03:08:50.360]
Don Coyote.

[03:08:51.000 --> 03:08:51.200]
Yeah.

[03:08:51.840 --> 03:08:52.900]
You're taking a sperry person.

[03:08:53.240 --> 03:08:53.360]
See?

[03:08:54.120 --> 03:08:56.060]
And then, rest there, either one or zero, okay?

[03:08:57.260 --> 03:09:00.300]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:09:00.540 --> 03:09:01.780]
Here's a call from Lantana.

[03:09:01.860 --> 03:09:02.040]
Hello.

[03:09:03.020 --> 03:09:03.580]
Uh, hello?

[03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:04.320]
Yes, sir.

[03:09:04.600 --> 03:09:05.440]
Only only you.

[03:09:06.920 --> 03:09:07.640]
Hey, Bonnie.

[03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:09.040]
Sorry, man, I hate that movie.

[03:09:09.940 --> 03:09:11.220]
But, uh, don't be sorry.

[03:09:11.660 --> 03:09:11.880]
Uh-huh.

[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:13.420]
Don't be sorry, you have a lot of company.

[03:09:13.660 --> 03:09:13.920]
Thank you.

[03:09:14.020 --> 03:09:14.260]
Happiness.

[03:09:15.520 --> 03:09:16.160]
You thought that?

[03:09:17.580 --> 03:09:17.920]
Yeah.

[03:09:18.740 --> 03:09:19.000]
Yes?

[03:09:19.240 --> 03:09:19.660]
You liked it.

[03:09:19.960 --> 03:09:20.500]
I loved it.

[03:09:20.580 --> 03:09:22.280]
I thought it was the ending with his hysterical.

[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:25.320]
Yeah, well, it was pretty, pretty twisted.

[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:26.640]
Right.

[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:28.340]
It was a real twisted movie, man.

[03:09:28.480 --> 03:09:29.360]
You didn't like it?

[03:09:29.520 --> 03:09:31.260]
I liked it a lot, but it was real twisted.

[03:09:31.460 --> 03:09:32.440]
Well, that's what made it greater.

[03:09:32.640 --> 03:09:34.180]
It was sick and twisted and bizarre.

[03:09:34.320 --> 03:09:36.800]
The ending was, I didn't you just about pee your pants at the ending?

[03:09:37.020 --> 03:09:37.340]
Oh, yeah.

[03:09:38.020 --> 03:09:38.220]
Yeah.

[03:09:39.100 --> 03:09:40.260]
Doggy had a nice little laugh.

[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:40.780]
No, I don't know.

[03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:41.980]
Don't say it.

[03:09:42.260 --> 03:09:42.380]
Okay.

[03:09:43.220 --> 03:09:46.400]
Uh, but anyway, if you like that, then, uh,

[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:51.320]
I have to recommend a movie directed by the same guy called, um, Storytelling.

[03:09:52.560 --> 03:09:53.840]
Yeah, somebody mentioned that before.

[03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:54.260]
Is that good?

[03:09:54.820 --> 03:09:55.260]
Uh, yeah.

[03:09:55.340 --> 03:10:00.420]
It's not quite up to happiness standards, but, um,

[03:10:01.180 --> 03:10:02.600]
there's some interesting scenes in there.

[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:06.160]
One in particular, uh, with a black guy and a little white girl.

[03:10:06.300 --> 03:10:08.720]
That's pretty, pretty interesting.

[03:10:09.740 --> 03:10:10.060]
Okay.

[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:13.000]
Um, and also, is Philip see more often on the list?

[03:10:13.660 --> 03:10:15.600]
No, because he's like too big, I think, isn't he?

[03:10:15.800 --> 03:10:16.440]
He's not on the list.

[03:10:16.440 --> 03:10:17.680]
Oh, he's not on the list.

[03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:18.240]
No, you're right.

[03:10:18.320 --> 03:10:20.020]
He should be on there because he's never to lead actor.

[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:20.360]
You're right.

[03:10:20.360 --> 03:10:20.780]
He's great.

[03:10:21.020 --> 03:10:21.740]
He's the best, man.

[03:10:22.020 --> 03:10:22.580]
Yeah, you're right.

[03:10:23.080 --> 03:10:25.040]
Um, and also, I do Netflix.

[03:10:25.820 --> 03:10:26.140]
Yeah.

[03:10:26.300 --> 03:10:27.100]
It's incredible, man.

[03:10:27.180 --> 03:10:27.780]
You should try it.

[03:10:27.820 --> 03:10:28.340]
It's really great.

[03:10:30.040 --> 03:10:31.240]
Yeah, but that's for George, though.

[03:10:31.400 --> 03:10:32.940]
That's for your sluppers that want to write it.

[03:10:33.500 --> 03:10:35.260]
You know, I just am too impatient for that.

[03:10:35.380 --> 03:10:35.820]
Oh, all right.

[03:10:35.880 --> 03:10:39.140]
Well, I want to go out and, you know, put some money in the circulation, help the economy.

[03:10:39.460 --> 03:10:39.760]
Okay.

[03:10:40.260 --> 03:10:40.900]
Okay, thanks.

[03:10:41.020 --> 03:10:41.380]
All right, man.

[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:43.140]
Philip see more often.

[03:10:43.260 --> 03:10:44.720]
How come we resisted putting him on there?

[03:10:44.840 --> 03:10:45.660]
Because he's great.

[03:10:46.300 --> 03:10:46.440]
Who?

[03:10:47.320 --> 03:10:48.540]
Philip see more often.

[03:10:48.540 --> 03:10:52.200]
He was in a movie that you never saw in which if you're lucky, you never will see.

[03:10:53.260 --> 03:10:56.340]
Oh, he was in that set of a woman.

[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:00.300]
And he was in another one that you'll never see.

[03:11:00.380 --> 03:11:06.540]
Even though you should, you like the movie, tell that Mr Ripley, but is this because of the fact element you won't see because you're afraid it's bad for your image, which at this point,

[03:11:06.540 --> 03:11:07.700]
I don't think you can really know that.

[03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:10.800]
And all of the reviews that I've heard other people get what that it sucked.

[03:11:11.080 --> 03:11:11.540]
It's not sucked.

[03:11:12.440 --> 03:11:13.400]
That's absolutely wrong.

[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:14.040]
It's an outstab.

[03:11:14.040 --> 03:11:15.500]
I've seen it a whole bunch of times.

[03:11:15.500 --> 03:11:18.340]
That's just because Matt Damon's in it or because it's a fact thing.

[03:11:18.440 --> 03:11:19.500]
It's a really good movie.

[03:11:19.500 --> 03:11:19.840]
Okay.

[03:11:20.520 --> 03:11:23.140]
Tell you what, it's great when it comes on cable all watching.

[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:24.120]
It's a thriller.

[03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:24.760]
It's a thriller.

[03:11:24.760 --> 03:11:26.140]
You law is great in it.

[03:11:26.740 --> 03:11:27.560]
I can't imagine.

[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:29.040]
Who the hell are you talking about?

[03:11:29.560 --> 03:11:30.800]
Miguel or somebody like that?

[03:11:31.340 --> 03:11:32.220]
No, just people.

[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:33.580]
Yeah, just people.

[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:35.440]
People would taste in their tush, man.

[03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:36.020]
Right, dumb.

[03:11:36.160 --> 03:11:36.740]
They're good movie.

[03:11:37.060 --> 03:11:38.400]
There's another one.

[03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:38.720]
I'm just okay.

[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:40.160]
You better see it.

[03:11:40.160 --> 03:11:41.840]
You thought that I had a lot of flicks I had to see.

[03:11:41.980 --> 03:11:44.000]
Now I'm moving away ahead of you like you're standing still.

[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:46.640]
Tell it, Mr. Ripley.

[03:11:48.520 --> 03:11:49.160]
American Psycho.

[03:11:49.260 --> 03:11:49.940]
The game.

[03:11:50.200 --> 03:11:52.340]
I thought you wouldn't want to tell me about the game.

[03:11:53.500 --> 03:11:54.060]
Is that the winner?

[03:11:54.440 --> 03:11:54.540]
Yes.

[03:11:55.120 --> 03:11:56.100]
Excellent choice, beater.

[03:11:56.200 --> 03:11:58.320]
I'm starting to think, beater's also way ahead of you.

[03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:00.820]
The game will shock you.

[03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:01.560]
That's how good it is.

[03:12:02.360 --> 03:12:05.020]
You'll think, boy, this doesn't get too much better than this.

[03:12:05.700 --> 03:12:35.000]
On a scale of 10, I give it about 11 1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-
