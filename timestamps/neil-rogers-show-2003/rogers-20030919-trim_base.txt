[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860]
Have a good weekend everybody. Neil is coming on and they've got a new license plate now for them in Florida.

[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.200]

Oh

[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.140]
To say that to you nice going partner. Yeah, we're the morning show. I had reached over and just ripped that weasel right off his head

[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.120]
I'm

[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.560]
I throw caution in the win with these people in their ratings

[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.760]
They are counting you had an 8.6 between the two of you had a 4.3 and men which means two two-hour segments 8.6

[00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.920]
Which means you had an 8 and he had a point six?

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.620]
Absolutely you got to love that if I get an 8 share they'll let me live in a cup back right next to you

[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.880]
No, thanks. By the way, it's raining here. Hey good luck to you

[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.160]
That's great. I hope the I hope is about

[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:03.000]
Duce's Toronto it is good things about I love this flooding and just infrastructure damage the subway system

[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.460]

Nice going George. Way to go George. Have a nice weekend, Neil. Say you two Fox

[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.680]
Yeah, I was a pretty lame crossover, but I'm busy changing my toner because I told her it said was empty

[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.880]
It's Friday you

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.440]
Use that kind of language around me

[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:46.840]
Yes, I have stop it. 50 friends when they

[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.380]
Yes

[00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:58.440]
The straight guys are more like five women

[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.660]
They care of your bedroom and throw out your clothes

[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.920]
Wax your eyebrows block the hair from your nose

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.400]
they're good at their jobs, but they say to pee

[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.840]
Cause those queer eye for the straight guys are more like five women to me

[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.680]
OOOH!

[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.720]
OOOH!

[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.200]
They can carry away

[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.720]
With the things that they say

[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.120]
They're so happy and gay

[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.300]
Come on, I don't know what to say

[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.220]
OOOH!

[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.740]
They can cut like a knife

[00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.000]
They won't change your whole life

[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.800]
Or they're even your wife

[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.220]
By the time that they leave you

[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.340]
You're thinking their way

[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.540]
It's no longer a bit spread

[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.680]
It's now a new day

[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.440]
And you find yourself shopping for fresh totale

[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.620]
OOOH!

[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.060]
Those queer eye for the straight guys are more like five women to me

[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.880]
It's okay, everyone wets the dead now and then

[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.060]
Look at that, uh-oh

[00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.900]
It's nice here to stay but I don't know

[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.400]
But if they're in town please send Carson and his friends to me

[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.040]
It's raining here, it's a rattle man

[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.080]
It's raining, it's a little a little bit of a breeze

[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.680]
Not a big deal, nothing's going on

[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.780]
And so on the front page of this morning's national post

[00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.740]
I wish you could all see this is a beautiful thing

[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.560]
Little sarcasm

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.560]
Hold it up to the microphone

[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.380]
See it?

[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.360]
Oh, look at that

[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.600]
It says it's got like five pictures, color pictures

[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.640]
It says we're here live waiting for the big storm

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.280]
Here she comes, any minute now

[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.720]
Yep

[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.540]
And it shows all these reporters out there getting blown away

[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.400]
So CNN is crestfallen as storm Peters out

[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.340]
Ah

[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.240]
You don't have to be an airline expert to know that flights are being disrupted by hurricane Isabelle Wolf Blitzer was saying yesterday

[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.200]
He then introduced an airline expert to tell us that flights were being disrupted by the hurricane

[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.740]
Flights are beginning to be disrupted by the hurricane the experts said

[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:27.360]
The hurricane had made landing in North Carolina Wolf called the exes though allied soldiers had made landfall on the beaches of France

[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.140]
He referred to CNN for respondents as being on the front lines

[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.420]
After offering a hysterical recap of the hurricane's progress thus far

[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.540]
He somehow, he somehow summoned the adjectives to go on

[00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.520]
Hurricane Isabelle menacing Washington, enormous cancellation of flights

[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.220]
The boomerang effect, enormous ripple effect, enormous impact, feeling the wrath, bracing for the effects

[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.280]
Hours later CNN's Tucker Carlson was on the streets of the capital bow tie peaking out over his yellow slicker

[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.760]
There's a light breeze and it's drizzling he reported

[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.420]
During an interview with the hurricane expert Wolf not stands roughly referred to hurricane Andrew which was a category 5

[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.880]
Meaning it was especially severe with the highest possible sustained winds

[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.020]
Wolf then reminded viewers that Isabelle is only a category 2 he sounded disappointed

[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.960]
Wolf continued we have a wind speed indicator on the roof of our building here in Washington DC

[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.680]
It just recorded a gust of 26 miles an hour and it's only going to get worse

[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.560]
It would have recorded a category 3 if only they placed it directly in front of Wolf's mouth

[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.180]
CNN cameras were trained on beaches and unrecriational vehicles these presumably being considered the safest bets for airborne visual drama

[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.280]
When not trained on beaches and RVs they were trained on the network's correspondents who were standing in the middle of the storm for no other reason than to stand in the middle of the storm

[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.820]
There's a certain excitement that goes along with these storms anchor Miles O'Brien said from CNN's Atlanta studio

[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.880]
It doesn't mean we're hoping for extensive damage or anything

[00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.040]
Some correspondents held onto railings subheld onto lampposts others pressed one pressed up against the large platter

[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.140]
Others stood leaning dauntlessly into the hurricane winds their rain gear flapping intrepidly

[00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.060]
Not a whole lot of damage here just a few shingles flying off roof's reporter said

[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.220]
Another remarked well there's a sign over there that's coming down they sounded disappointed

[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:13.860]
Frequently we were shown images of the hurricane on something called 3D radar which is just like regular radar but with an extra D

[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:22.600]
On 3D radar the rain was colorized yellow so you can see it the CNN meteorologist informed then back to the RV still stubbornly resisting flight

[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.920]
And the reporters are fearless correspondents holding on one anchor exclaimed

[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.160]
CNN brought in Bill Nye the science guy he explained why the roofscape ripped off houses and hurricanes

[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:35.220]
I didn't take notes but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with wind

[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:42.500]
Then Bill started talking about fish and how they're shaped and what that shape means for how the fish move through the water

[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:48.520]
Then Miles O'Brien to a fish on the illustrator the interview ended abruptly not long after that and the coverage continued

[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.960]
The storm has remarkable resiliency Isabella shut down the federal government the fury of Mother Nature tremendous wind field no sign of letting up

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.000]
The storm surge had been predicted to reach seven feet the hyperbole surge had already surpassed it

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.640]
It's going to blow all night long your correspondents said and one sensitive wood both along the coastline and into the microphones

[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:16.640]
That's the front page article little sarcasm a an a national post this morning crappy paper though so it's raining here it's just raining you know what I mean

[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:22.660]
No I don't know is that raining like real real hard are there like buildings coming down and signs no no

[00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.780]
They're like wild hurricane like wind no it's raining

[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.100]
Anyway here's the result of the pool from yesterday

[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.760]
What's your who's your all-time favorite den actor actresses we continue with our series of dead people Mo

[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:40.740]
Absolutely Mo loves this he's obsessed with it can't believe that we get all these people listening when we're talking about dead people

[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:48.540]
You'll be on the list soon Mo especially when they get can you imagine next month when we get the hour by hour right that's our biggest demo too by the way the dead people

[00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:57.180]

[00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.560]
Oh it's going to be a beautiful thing

[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.640]
We sit up probably about that point be up to a five share in morning and men which means for all we'll have a nine more we'll have a one

[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:11.800]
Isabel away from Virginia Beach Virginia then worked at it Pat now you're losing your touch or maybe the Lord is busy listening to other things

[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:26.840]

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:36.720]
Year you know it's that time of the year again when the mattress showrooms and furniture stores run their phony crappy add sales down a mattress has a question for you if you double the price then offer half

[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:44.040]
Off is that really a deal no of course not the fact is these stores have to run some special sale to drop their prices nearly as low at

[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.140]
The amount of prices every day prices 365 days a year so for this count prices on dozens of models the top name

[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:57.100]
Sealy sure to temper pete Simmons King Coylor Sterns and forsta you need to call one 800 mattress no nonsense no bait and

[00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.580]
Switch no house brands no falls promises and best of all you don't have to pay no premium for the best service going anywhere

[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:10.700]
You get service like you dream about from the delivery team right number one when you call down a mattress at 1 800 mattress you still get to pick the day and time for your delivery you pick the

[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.680]
Built in PM and to be sleeping like a baby the first night I've been sleeping on a mattress and down a mattress for a

[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.940]
Coons age you ought to be doing it for yourself and your back and your partner as well with low prices same day delivery

[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:30.620]
Free set up and removal it's easy to see why down a mattress is ranked number one in customer satisfaction

[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.140]
So don't be fooled don't get conned in by those mattress soroms or phony furniture stirats

[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:39.300]

Leave me alone. Oh man

[00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:07.660]
Well, it'll pop these up in his room

Blaming in

But there was trouble when the federal is not going to pop his door

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:42.280]
It's made up my mind right through his head body in a swat car and hold him away

[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.980]
I didn't do nothing wrong

[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.300]
Take him away, officer

[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:50.460]
They find in 20,000 and they're gonna make his parents pay

[00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:58.460]
This is coming out of your allowance sign because it's not legal to take music without paying on me in a man

[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.800]
But everybody does it now

[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.800]
Liv, don't Bobby's facing charges and he's not out of a fifth grade

[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.780]
Yeah, I suppose if Billy jumped off the prison break he would do now

[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:14.280]
The tiny shots in trouble and he's got no idea what he's done

[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.460]
Music I didn't kill anybody

[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:21.700]
They treated it like he was a kinder Oh, Jason

[00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.260]
Sorry, they're still stealing Bobby is wrong

[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:29.940]
And the lesson to be learned is one you should know from the day your boss

[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.940]
I'm sorry, I mean, I said you'll listen to me, don't get caught down

[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.140]
Lord, music save your disk drive memory for a part

[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:39.240]
There you go

[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.520]
There's the best advice you ever had Bobby 1018 and 560 WQ I'm happy Friday to you

[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.400]
So it's raining here that I mentioned it

[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.760]
Yeah, it's raining

[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:52.660]
I love this little thing you passed along to me here from one of our astute listeners

[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:55.940]
It says an elementary teacher starts a new job at a school in Tallahancey

[00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.540]
And trying to make a good impression on her first day explains to her class that she's an FSU fan

[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.560]
She asked the class to raise their hands if they too are FSU fans

[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.340]
Everyone in the class raises their hand except one little girl

[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.540]
The teacher looks a little surprised and says, Mary, why didn't you raise your hand?

[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:13.700]
Because I'm not a Seminole fans, she said

[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.860]
The teacher answered, well, if you're not a Seminole's fan, then who do you support?

[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.580]
I'm a Gator fan and proud of it, Mary replied

[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.700]
The teacher now become interested in the loan to center ass, Mary, why are you a Gator fan?

[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.380]
Because my mom and dad went to UF and my mom is a Gator fan and my dad is a Gator fan, so I'm a Gator fan too

[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.180]
Well said the teacher and obviously an Oed tome, that's not necessarily a reason for you to be a Gator fan

[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.560]
You don't have to be just like your parents all the time

[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.200]
What if your mom was a prostitute and your dad was a drug addict and a car thief? What would you be then?

[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.700]
Mary said, I'd be a hurricane's fan

[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.220]
Hurricane's BOW

[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.580]
Yeah, nice going, Mary

[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.800]
Thank you so much Bill, that's Bill and Fort Lauderdale not the one who hates George George

[00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.320]
Thanks Bill, excellent job and no forget

[00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.020]
Hurricane's BOW

[00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:06.060]
Make no mistake about that, whether the name Isabel or any other, whatever the name, Vinny, Gino

[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.220]
Remember Gino Toretta?

[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:07.940]
Sure

[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.340]
He's the only 85 year old quarterback that ever played in an American university

[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:20.280]
Here's your friend PR Ralph's, we're the Puerto Mican people support Jorge a job well done

[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.340]
Now you have money to pay the weed debt or else take or timeless Los Oevos

[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.360]
Congratulations

[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.600]
Since PR Ralph, your close personal me go to, I think everybody in the audience ought to be calling all you skeptics out there

[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.320]
All you people that bust little George's balls all the time

[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:38.560]
I mean, okay, so he didn't do like spectacular, he did very very well, though he did great

[00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.240]
Not, you know, a super sensation like double digits, like Neil

[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.380]
Like Neil sometimes does, but nevertheless

[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.000]
See, here's what a lot of these assholes don't understand

[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.360]
First of all, the best of Neil tapes suck, they're done

[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.680]
You will not hear those no more

[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:55.880]
Maybe I'm like some holiday when we have like Christmas day, we got nothing else to put on

[00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.500]
No, you won't be heard out on this station

[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:06.540]
They suck, they're outdated, they're put together very schlock, etc. All before we get back to that

[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.220]
Do we have an update? I hate to ask because I know the answer is going to be low from yesterday, no

[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.240]
Just what you got yesterday and not a new one today, no

[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.620]
Have you heard you talk about money, right?

[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:18.340]
Right, no, not a new one

[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.240]
Because I want to see us get to 25 grand by the end of the day today

[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:24.260]
They are going to be really parked off in a really sour mood the rest of the weekend

[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.000]
We're going to be able to do that until after that appearance

[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.180]
After what appearance? The one that's after that

[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.000]
Well, I don't have nothing on that either

[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.960]
That's on your fax machine

[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:34.580]
It's why? On the fax machine

[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.280]
You mean now? Right now, if you reach over, there it is

[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.120]
I just reached over and saw my fax machine

[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.500]
Best of Neil's stuff this afternoon, I don't know how Joe and Mark did it yesterday

[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.500]
But they usually do just a few bucks

[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:49.440]
I am a good man

[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.600]
How much? I don't know, I was yelling at Miguel to come back in here

[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:53.920]
Yeah, come on Miguel, get with it

[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.820]
You're doing such a horse ball job this year

[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:58.060]
I know Doreen needs to get serviced at least once an hour

[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.020]
But Gortskoreo, put that thing away for a minute

[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.960]
Let's find out what's going on here

[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.440]
This is really schlucky

[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.420]
How much?

[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.900]
40, I must have heard wrong

[00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.540]
He just shouted it out over the intercom

[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.180]
They raised $40

[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.740]
Are you serious?

[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.100]
I'm sure I heard wrong

[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:19.760]
Are you sure? $40, he just got cut off

[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.720]
How much? I don't know, pretty sure he said 40

[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:27.400]
You know something serious, if Joe and Mark raised only $40 for the abandoned pet rescue

[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.480]
With all of our good merchandise yesterday, with our CDs and more Howard David and Edson Leachines

[00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.940]
I'm going to be so pissed at them, I know what they got

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.000]
I have nobody listening

[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.440]
But nobody shows up unless you're on the air promoting it at the time you see

[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.440]
Oh yeah, that's it

[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.620]
So what's going to happen tomorrow between three and five?

[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:42.240]
Today

[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.560]
The Sanctonone Georgia will be at Fort Lauderdale Harley on Federal Highway just south of Oakland Park Boulevard with prizes

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.560]
Oh yeah, there's really heavy duty QA and prize factor

[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.800]
Atlantic City subs from our good friends at Atlantic City of subs

[00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.600]
Dickens, cider, energy drinks and whatever else so we can give away

[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.440]
Plus our best in the merchandise will be there

[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.540]
Three to five this afternoon

[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.500]
Georgia at Fort Lauderdale Harley

[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.140]
And we better get with it

[00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.640]
It's a good place to go the Fort Lauderdale Harley shop

[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.360]
Nice clothes and there's always lots of brawless babes running around the store

[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.580]
All right!

[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.600]
Really? Really?

[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.140]
I'll be damned

[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.120]
I'll be damned

[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:17.940]
I'll be damned

[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.320]
I guess I better turn on a Playboy channel momentarily just to get everybody to remove your pants today

[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.860]
Come see the Harley twins and ask them to see their two-pack tattoos

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:38.120]
Look at that, it's one of the beasties planted in the background while she's trying to figure out what life is all about

[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:40.920]
It was, I think it was a Bruce Beasley there

[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.060]
So anyway, go see Georgia's afternoon and help us out because Joe and Mark just stumped the joint out

[00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.580]
Do you have any idea how mortifying that is?

[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.780]
To race Ford and I was joking when I said

[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.520]
I was pretty much had my thumb on it

[00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:59.940]
40 bucks, it's like one CD and one keychain or two CDs or whatever the hell they pedaled yesterday

[00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:01.540]
That's lame, Joe

[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.160]
God, all might have done it

[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.360]
I just walk away if I were them

[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.060]
I just walk away

[00:19:07.060 --> 00:19:10.860]
So we'll give it a good shot, give it a lame shot and we just, nobody likes us

[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:11.820]
John and the lady away

[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.120]
Yeah, that's a good idea

[00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.740]
Because if I were them after seeing that last book

[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:18.840]
Be afraid, be very afraid

[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.220]
I wouldn't be spending my next paycheck nowhere, no more

[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.120]
Anyways, so that's the deal

[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.760]
Go see Georgia's afternoon and give us some money

[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.420]
But I started to say I think everybody in the audience owes you an apology

[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.820]
The ones, at least the ones who are the naysayers

[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.100]
They're always ripping you and ass about your ex-soction

[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.940]
Especially that bill in Ford Lauderdale

[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:37.100]
Not the one who faxed us that cute thing moments ago

[00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.900]
Maybe here's somebody the first call today

[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.180]
Is somebody who's going to kiss your ass

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.220]
Here's Miami, hello

[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.180]
Why are you so miserable?

[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:43.740]
No

[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.880]
You're going to kiss your ass, it's got to come right on it

[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]
Not all fours

[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.840]
Boring, boring, boring, south, or at least we got the hurricane here

[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:53.240]
The remnants of it, we got a little Isabel

[00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.740]
You got Celia Cruz, we got Isabel

[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.980]
And she's got better an aneurys on her head

[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.720]
Just raining a little bit of wind nothing, absolutely nothing here

[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.220]
Okay, here's our poll question today

[00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.000]
Who's your all-time favorite dead musician

[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.720]
As we consider compiling, I gotta continue compiling these polls of dead people just to piss off more

[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.520]
Absolutely

[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.140]
Who's your favorite all-time dead musician

[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:15.900]
Now I could have filled out a whole bunch more on here

[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:18.800]
But then that would take away the opportunity for you to have some fun with it

[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.620]
Or not

[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.600]
John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley or Kurt Cobain

[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.160]
Those are the only four names I've put under here

[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:29.100]
So you have a chance to add to it

[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.360]
Then Monday, I don't know how we're going to word that one on Monday

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:32.720]
You know

[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:34.440]
What's it?

[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.420]
The other

[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.620]
For people like

[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.000]
Famous others

[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.240]
I like that

[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.680]
Not politicians, not musicians, and not actors or actresses

[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.740]
I don't know how we're going to word that

[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:48.460]
Carefully

[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.080]
Well, we'll have to finger that out on Monday

[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.360]
But we're talking about people like, you know, historical figures

[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:59.360]
And veterans like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford and Benjamin Franklin, Albert Einstein

[00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.320]
Albert Einstein, Alfred E. Newman, people like that

[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.940]
In fact, we might actually put Alfred E. Newman on there now that you've come right down to our very good world

[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:12.480]
The gnarly guy from that magazine was his name Ed Gaines or something like that

[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:14.180]
You know, Ed Gaines was the publisher

[00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:15.940]
Yeah, that's what I mean

[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:17.800]
He's dead

[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.320]
Yeah, he's dead

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.260]
Love Mad Magazine, that's why we got Alfred E. Newman as president now

[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:23.580]
Yes

[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.120]
It's how popular that thing was

[00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:30.240]
26 past 10 at 560 WDQM if you're looking for a really great new place to eat breakfast

[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:30.860]
Lunch or dinner

[00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.740]
How about Vick and Irv's from Rochester, New York, right in South Florida now in Fort Lauderdale?

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.920]
Vick and Irv's has been around since 1934 as a small child about 100 years ago

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.560]
I loved it, and still do

[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.660]
Vick and Irv's is located on Federal Highway just south of Broward, in the tunnel on the east side

[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.960]
Vick and Irv's is a flashback in time to what restaurants used to be before fast food

[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.460]
If you love those ruches through White Hots even if you never had them before I guarantee you

I voted for Jim Morrison who should win this pool hands down your pants no contest

[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.000]
Although we have a fax from Anna and for Lauderdale Anna says I vote for Kurt Cobain

[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.320]
Well you have a lot of nerve Anna

[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:16.420]
1032 and 560 WDQM 56070560.560 I probably shouldn't have done that shouldn't I

Couldn't resist I just gonna help myself I'll go ahead

[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.180]
Count 560 on the AT&T by the way general Wesley Clark was at the deli day and yesterday

[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.700]
Picking out

[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:32.020]
All you jump bandwagon jump see I'm still for Howard Dean I realized that that makes me an old

[00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:37.040]
Funny Dutty and that I'm just not a you know just not hip and whatever I'm supposed to be I like Howard Dean a lot

[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:42.700]
Because he's got balls because he doesn't change you know from one minute to the next he doesn't say one thing one day

[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:47.020]
And then when things don't turn out too well it says well you know we're just not managing this thing all I will

[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:52.560]
Because Wesley Clark said that he probably would have voted for the congressional resolution by his fall authorizing the war

[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.220]
During his appearance at the highly touted deli then which used to be great in Hollywood and is now pretty marginal

[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:04.500]
At best remember when the deli then used to be really great didn't one of the owners that commit suicide

[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:05.820]
There was something

[00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.080]
So where is that number? Yeah I'm positive by the way William Gaines

[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.940]
Gaines William Gaines was the publisher of Mad Magazine

[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:27.120]
But genius how about Don Martin how about him how about he's dead why why would you say that you think Don Martin still alive I do how do you know that we would have heard about that I think we did but at any rate

[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:34.080]
So you can't remember them all there's so many the reason I enjoy doing these Deadpool all that we want to say enjoys not the right term but the reason it's timely

[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.940]
Maybe it's just me but it seems like they're dropping like flies. No it's

[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:47.840]
It's going on famous people well known people whether it's the local scene like our friend Don Cox passing away a few days ago or like a nationally

[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:54.900]
First we had Gregory Peck and Kate Hempburn and then we had Johnny Cash and John Ritter and they're dropping like flies they're dying over here man

[00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:05.400]
So I think it's appropriate that we start honoring the dead people because you know after a few months few years it's like yesterday's mass potatoes you know nobody wants to eat it

[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:13.500]
Bons Scott AC DC singers a great choice for your pool Bons Scott I know Bon Jovi yeah I know Scott Bale I know

[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:22.180]
I love Bons Scott it says his voice was on kirritunes like highway to hell dirty deeds TNT a whole lot of rosy at all thank you so much

[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:28.180]
Thank you for whoever called it I thought Bons Scott was in the accounts here with the stones they had his body on stick

[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:36.320]
Well he could be up there with his stones most of them are dead nobody don't forget Frank so not try oh Franky Panky that opens up a lot of bits I can play

[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.000]
Now the reason I just played that task me it's kind of a week bit but it's only a doors one I think that we got isn't it?

[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:48.820]
No I think we have a people are strange ones somewhere in here we do I I don't know what you call people oh we got peppy fields she's dead

[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:57.300]
I just looked under peepy wow I don't know what it's called anyway so what's his name was there Wesley Clark

[00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:02.860]
he was in Hollywood to kick off his official campaign and we had a lot of you know bandwagon jumpers already and

[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:07.960]
Florida and around the rest of the country to see it's not just the Democrats but anybody who realizes that Bush is a

[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:14.700]
emigrated liar and is surrounded by a bunch of real evil doers and ought to be impeached already I mean yeah it comes

[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.940]
I have the Husspa there you look on our website today you'll find some really interesting articles there about what the in fact one of

[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:26.960]
me was the effort a few times that's so pissed off how can this man not be being impeached right now oh well no we never

[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:32.360]
said Sodom had nothing to do with line 11 and then well no he really had nothing to do with al-Qaeda I know there are no weapons of mass

[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:42.540]
destruction this morning they're announcing to us breathlessly that they discovered that they had no smallpox at all right so every

[00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.420]
every couple days well they didn't have any of this they didn't have any of that they didn't have any

[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:56.780]
seren gas they didn't have any serendipity any audio and yeah so what does this all about yeah that's exactly so anyway we're

[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:03.560]
going on a band by getting the more really disturbing is article in the Washington Post it says general clerks said his views on the war

[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:11.020]
resemble those of democratic senators do Lieberman of Connecticut and John the scary carry both of them voted for the war but now

[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:17.620]
question president pushes stewardship of the Iraqi occupation that having been said I was against the wars had

[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:22.480]
emerged because there was no reason to start it when we did we could have waited he said during a 75 minute session

[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:28.140]
with four reporters while he was eating kishki and probably lots of mots of bride now you don't eat that this time

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:35.760]
here like you have mots of bride yes I have oh Clark now here's what I did he's time this sound a little like Arnold to me

[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:42.140]
yeah Clark said he has few specific probably policy ideas to offer voters right now and offered a few thoughts that might

[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:49.320]
surprise Democrats flocking to his campaign as recently as Sunday night he was unsure if he should run for

[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:55.140]
president so Clark said voters need to give him time to think things through see if it's me I got me call me crazy

[00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:01.900]
you're crazy I know but if it's me I start thinking things through ahead of time and then say hey maybe I got some answers for things that will work

[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:07.060]
like the economy and like this mess we got in Iraq and like the war on real terrorism and all of these things as

[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:12.000]
opposed to saying hey guess what I'm running now let me figure out what I want to do well that that's the way

[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:22.400]
worse now here's a lady in Atlanta hello hey how you doing hey Neil this is Diane hi Diane I used to live down there in

[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.520]
fish I know uh who was that soccer player that we hit on the other day and at one pull I don't know

[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:20.740]
back um the David Beckham very good oh you notice now he's getting on a payroll maybe one of these

[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.680]
days soon Scott starting like actually respond once in a while very good don't overdo it though

[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.900]
but David Beckham is good he's got he firstly had like the real short almost skinhead here

[00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.180]
and I always found the other extreme because he's making all this money figures he can do whatever

[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:36.180]
he wants plus he's like a big idol over there I have no idea why because he's like a marginal

[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:40.900]
looking guy he's okay you know he's very well know the brits a bigger part he's married to one

[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:45.360]
of the spice girls that is correct how come you're so like David Beckham intensive you got like a

[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.640]
blow up doll at home or something sports guy yeah you told us you weren't one of those sports

[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:54.360]
nerds now sports you said all you like is hockey and you only told me that just to suck up to me

[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.400]
by the way leaf speed the Swedish national team nine to two last night one of those meaningless

[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:31.860]
history of mankind next to Andre Cigovia and Eric Clapton and Jose Feliciano

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:38.160]
and Corp and Jose Feliciano I used to like him you know I think he's still blind is he still blind I'll

[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.920]
be god damn is he still sticking the stick in the star spangled banner is that what he's

[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:47.820]
think they actually made a record out of that do you remember that no I remember please

[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:54.260]
now your dad please on your dad but no seriously they made a single of 45 out of Jose Feliciano

[00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:58.860]
the star spangled banner he done a great job on that well don't look at a lot of these

[00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:04.120]
artis to just butcher and butcher and butcher him which is already a torturously bad song to

[00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:10.760]
begin with he covered like my fire too with a blanket how about he didn't really mean it but he

[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:15.380]
didn't see where he was putting it he covered like my fire oh this god man what the hell got into

[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:23.120]
him you must have got like a free meal or clear yesterday okay let's go into him now we understand

[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:29.140]
wow no don't get so about it so the word is that early this afternoon is when we're going to get

[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:34.320]
the heaviest not a big deal here in Ontario but I mean the heaviest rain and like a little something

[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.340]
so that it wasn't all for nothing and they show there was like a tree down somewhere in the city so

[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.980]
what we do you know I love that front page of the national post and it's really a crappy paper but

[00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:49.740]
that was so beautiful and they've got pictures of all of these correspondence with their ponchos

[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:55.920]
on and a whole thing getting blown away almost okay let's see now how can we have additional names

[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.440]
on here I thought he was only going to do at the end of the hour oh he listening oh well he

[00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:04.500]
listen as you can Eric we don't want to overwhelm you or burden you because the last thing we want

[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:08.700]
is to like sour what has become a decent relationship you doing a great job with our bedtime stories

[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:13.380]
as I am by the way and George the last thing he needs is for you to start going sour on him again

[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:17.060]
and getting psychotic and the last thing I need is for you to start calling me up here again

[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:23.940]
because believe you me 87 votes your all-time favorite dead musician note this is a pool in progress

[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:33.400]
if you don't see look at look at this but I tell you this he he responds like a train puppy you know

[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.600]
note this is a pool in progress if you don't see your favorite on here call it in and then you can

[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.420]
vote for later so now he's going the other extreme I say I think before you get the second

[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:47.140]
name out of your mouth. He'll have it on there already. I love Eric. He's doing a fine job.

[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.960]
I mean, he used to be a real asshole, but then you know, something happened. He got religion.

[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:56.960]
92 votes. John lemon 37. I told you he's running away with it. Elvis Presley 21,

[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.820]
Jim Morrison 20, Kurt Cobain 12, Frank Sinatra too. And nobody else has any votes. Oh my god.

[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:09.140]
Nobody else has any votes? Here's the fact that says dear God,

[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.080]
why is Frank Zappa not on that list? Well, because we haven't gotten there yet. We haven't

[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:21.040]
suggested it till now. He is now. You know, probably the one bit, well, I won't say more than

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.280]
any of them, but one of the ones that I enjoy playing almost more than anything else. Bobby Brown

[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:32.900]
is Bobby Brown. I don't know. We also got Bobby Barr. Hey there, people on Bobby Brown. So we'll

[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.240]
get to that. So Frank Zappa's unlisted says, I won't vote until he's there. What you can vote

[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:40.860]
momentarily because I guarantee you from a dedicated listener recently moved to Memphis. Well,

[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.780]
good luck to Memphis. You'll need it. He moved to Memphis and he ain't voting for the king.

[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:50.140]
What I probably excommunicate his ass by the end of the day. Freddie Mercury, George and I were

[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.280]
talking about that before the show. We could have put him on there already, but we figured, well,

[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.800]
give you something to do. You know, if we put him all on there, then what do you people going to do?

[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.020]
He said sit there and diddle it. You know, Freddie Mercury, get him on there. A real queen.

[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.760]
Anybody can be like a make-believe queen, but Freddie was a real, he was like maybe the

[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:10.300]
definitive queen. The maple leaf queen? He was a maple leaf queen.

[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:15.960]
Carlo Fax is here and says I would have to say my favorite dead musician would be

[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:21.420]
Who Drummer Keith Moon? That was my vote. Wasn't it? Yes it was.

[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:27.040]
Speaking of moon, it's just dawn on me. We have that drop-in that goes

[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:32.280]
Get the Hoover out the moon, man. Maybe that's why he died. Maybe they stuck the Hoover up is

[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:38.420]
back down. Shoot. The greatest drummer in history, his manic playing was the inspiration for

[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:45.480]
animal of the muppets. Most rock star behavior and cliches were drawn from his life.

[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:49.600]
How do you like that? He got eyes on George, whatever that means. Nice one George. He says you

[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.680]
got a nice one. Oh, he's seen it then. Keith's moon. Get him on there right away from the hood.

[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:59.520]
He's still dead by the way. Are you sure his, I was able to see how his still is blind?

[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.620]
This is 4205 City.

[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:53.040]
I'm going to get a good job and be real rich.

[00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:02.260]
Get him on there. Get him on there.

[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:09.880]
I'll tell you people I was not ready around this day by the name of the

[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:16.420]
President. You need a little speech then. All she tried to make you say when.

[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:22.280]
She had the balls in her thighs but she left the fish. I guess it's still a thought,

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:27.520]
but now it's too quick. Oh god, I am the American green.

[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:36.320]
But now I smell like basil leaf and I'm a miserable son of a bitch. Am I a lawyer or lady?

[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:41.540]
I don't know which. I wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder.

[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:48.780]
So what went out and bought me a laser suit? I jingle my chains but I'm still kind of cute.

[00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.560]
Got a job doing radio, come on.

[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:58.500]
And none of the jobs can even tell I'm a homeowner. If that's me and me and a friend.

[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:02.740]
So I've drifted along as a SNM.

[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:06.300]
I can think about an hour on this hour of power.

[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.680]
Along as I guess, so little gold and chow with all of God.

[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.580]
I am the American green. With a spindle of my butt till it makes me squeak.

[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:19.020]
And I'll do anything together.

[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:26.840]
I'll lay away nights saying thank you, friend. Oh god, oh god, I'm so fantastic.

[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:33.120]
Thanks to Fritz, I'm a sexual stash to give a name in Bobby Brown.

[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:40.040]
Watch me now on Google and my name is Bobby Brown.

[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:47.020]
Watch me now on Google and my name is Bobby Brown.

[00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.440]
Watch me now on Google.

[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.040]
1103 at 560 WDQ. I'm happy Friday. It's raining cats and dogs here in Toronto.

[00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:58.900]
But you know something? No big deal. A little bit of wind, a little bit of breeze.

[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.360]
They finished the breeze. Here's a fact, two votes, by the way, for a friend's app already.

[00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:08.740]
Now get some votes. And rightfully so, I love friends.

[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.060]
This act says this is from Jean. So I guess he likes anybody named Jean.

[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:15.560]
Jean Crouppa.

[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:21.540]
Was it much better a much better drummer than you have a Louis Armstrong cab, Calaway, Duke,

[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.720]
and at King Cole, Adorisins, Valibara and a one and a two.

[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:28.220]
And yeah, Lawrence, what does that mean? Do you have any ideas?

[00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.980]
No, Jean Crouppa. Do we really want to put on Jean Crouppa?

[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:33.820]
Why not? He makes me Pupa.

[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:37.680]
Jean Crouppa, he couldn't play the tuba.

[00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:41.880]
Okay, put him on, he won't get any votes. You have to be really old even if who the hell Jean Crouppa was.

[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:45.600]
But Jean finishes out his facts very nicely by saying, impeach Bush.

[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:46.640]
Nice going, Jean.

[00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:51.020]
Did I do the story about the world as old as genitals being found?

[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:56.360]
Well, here it is. London. This from Reuters, no less. So it might be true.

[00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.200]
Scientists have discovered fossils of the world's oldest genitals

[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:04.160]
belonging to 400 million year old insects in ancient rocks in Scotland.

[00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:07.260]
I didn't know that insects had genitals, did you?

[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.740]
Of course, how else do you think they do it?

[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.480]
The penis of the ancient harvestman insects commonly known as the Daddy Long Legs.

[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.860]
Oh, I know him.

[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.220]
Oh, you know who didn't make our pool of dead movie stars?

[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.260]
Oh, John Holmes.

[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:26.220]
Somebody had called but he hung up and he was going to say that.

[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.760]
Yeah, how do you know that?

[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.280]
Of course, he told me so and I did not want to know that.

[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.600]
Why not? You have to tell Neil.

[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.000]
What do you mean he didn't want to know? Oye, see.

[00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:40.340]
The penis of the ancient harvestman insects commonly known as Daddy Long Legs was two-thirds the length of the body

[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:45.160]
and remarkably similar to the modern-day species New Scientist magazine said Wednesday.

[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:50.560]
To discover the world's oldest genitals proved that little has changed over the last 400 million years,

[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:52.840]
at least for Daddy Long Legs, the magazine said.

[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.600]
Jason Dunlop and a team of researchers from Humboldt University in Berlin,

[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.180]
who will present their findings at a conference in Aberdeen, Scotland,

[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:06.180]
also uncovered a long egg laying organ called an overpositor from a female,

[00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:07.860]
an overpositor.

[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.400]
As well as genitals, the fossils have the oldest known arachnid respiratory system,

[00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:18.060]
suggesting harvestman's ancestors had long since crawled out of the sea and learned to breed the magazine.

[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.380]
Harvestman arachnids are sometimes mistaken for spiders,

[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:25.280]
but they're more closely related to ticks or mites because they don't spin webs.

[00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:29.120]
Unlike Moe, they don't spin a wicked web.

[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:34.620]
The previous oldest penis was dated back 100 million years and was found in Brazil,

[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.300]
belonged to an ostracod.

[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.700]
I wonder if he had his cod piece on.

[00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.800]
An early crustacean related to crabs, shrimp and water fleas.

[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.420]
Oh, how are they?

[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.400]
The penis that had crabs when he had the oldest penis on an early crustacean.

[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.700]
I'll be damned.

[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:52.140]
Now that dated back 100 million, this one dates back 400 million years.

[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:54.720]
I guess that kind of shoots a hole in the Bible crab.

[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.500]
I remember...

[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:59.160]
...perventating isn't real, it's a satanic plot.

[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.540]
Yeah, it's a satanic plot.

[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:02.240]
Okay, are you stupid people out there?

[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.700]
Just believe all those geckys, okay, all that nonsense.

[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:05.500]
They're religious.

[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:08.480]
Look, look, look, that good old mumbo jumbo, and I do like chicken gumbo.

[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.300]
Oh, speaking of this, speaking of penis might as well do this story right on the ass end of that.

[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.300]
Sadame Shaka at New York High School.

[00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.440]
Do you see this story on our website?

[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:20.200]
Yeah.

[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:29.100]
A Long Island school board is voted to win the high school football team season the mid allegations that some players were sexually assaulted by older teammates at a training camp.

[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.240]
There we go with that same old stuff again, over and over again.

[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:33.900]
Football.

[00:51:34.140 --> 00:51:34.540]
That's a date!

[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:35.640]
Club you moron!

[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:35.880]
Right.

[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:42.000]
The Belmore Merrick school board decided that one's dinner closed or meeting cancel all of the MEPM...

[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:45.500]
MEPM High School football teams games news they reported yesterday's editions.

[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:57.040]
Three varsity players ages 15, 16, and 17 allegedly satamized three junior varsity players with a broomstick, pine cones, and golf balls while other players watched the newspaper reported.

[00:51:59.040 --> 00:51:59.920]
How do you like that?

[00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:02.680]
I better do that lady in the Delray Beach, because ladies won't hang on.

[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:03.440]
Earned a new beach.

[00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:03.740]
Hello.

[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.460]
Lady in the Beach.

[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:07.060]
Hello.

[00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:08.060]
Yes ma'am.

[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.160]
I'd like to nominate Ronnie Van Van.

[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.040]
Okay.

[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:13.540]
And this is Valerie Thompson from the day you beat.

[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:14.200]
I love your show.

[00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:15.060]
Listen to it every day.

[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:15.900]
Thanks Valerie.

[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:16.520]
Have a great weekend.

[00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:16.880]
Thank you.

[00:52:16.980 --> 00:52:17.240]
Goodbye.

[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:17.600]
Bye.

[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:18.660]
Ronnie Van Van Van.

[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.080]
Cut it though.

[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.120]
Got it.

[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:20.320]

[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:31.600]
Anyway, three varsity players ages 15, 16, and 17 allegedly satamized three junior varsity players with a broomstick, pine cones, and golf balls while other players watched the newspaper said.

[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:39.460]
The alleged assaults for a place of campy and in Preston Park, Pennsylvania were about 60 met from high school players and five coaches spent a week last month.

[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:40.360]
They were spent.

[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:46.120]
Newsday said Pennsylvania State Police were investigating the allegations no charges have been filed.

[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:51.940]
The three accused players have been suspended from the team but not from the school, pending the outcome of a district investigation.

[00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:59.240]
School officials and players have said that the coaches didn't know about the incidents to one of the victims' parents reported to the school principal several days after the team had returned.

[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:05.980]
The school board found that many of the teams players violated the district's code of conduct by not reporting the alleged abuse news they said.

[00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:06.960]
How do you like that?

[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:14.960]
Some players sexually assaulted by older teammates is more that factory continues in the world of young guys sports.

[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:15.640]
You're gay.

[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:16.300]
Yeah.

[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.180]
That sounded like Reverend Jones.

[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:18.700]
Yeah, I did.

[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:18.980]
Yeah.

[00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:26.080]
560, 560, 0560, 0560 on your AT&T and Verizon wire up this line.

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:28.700]
Who is your all-time favorite dead musician?

[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.840]
John Lennon's running away with it.

[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:31.580]
I predicted that.

[00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:34.280]
I really didn't think he would.

[00:53:34.460 --> 00:53:34.860]
47.

[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.140]
And let me ask you this.

[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.000]
I'm not going to wait till somebody calls it in.

[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:39.120]
How about George Harrison?

[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:40.400]
Okay.

[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.000]
Well, what's wrong with that?

[00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.080]
Let me put John Lennon can go on there and get all the glory.

[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.000]
It's because of the tragic murder and he, you know.

[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.000]
Well, George Harrison did exactly die of very pleasant death.

[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:51.740]
No, but nevertheless.

[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:54.800]
Never less my ass.

[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.680]
It's all about the hype.

[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:59.840]
Lennon was hyped long before he was shot and then he met with a terrible tragic ending.

[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.960]
I should probably be upset with Lynn who facts in three names.

[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.320]
See, I don't, but I'm not going to be upset because there are three good names.

[00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:08.960]
Stevie Ray Vaughan.

[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:10.800]
Right, right.

[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.020]
From now on, we're going to limit it to one for customer.

[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.880]
Although I want to get to these other factors, I'll probably have about 30 each.

[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:17.820]
Buddy Holly.

[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:21.560]
I mean, I don't know.

[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:25.400]
Of course, when we say who's your favorite, see, I can't argue because it's your opinion.

[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.040]
It's like, what's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.800]
If you say vanilla, who the hell am I to say your taste is crap?

[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.000]
And Roy Orbison.

[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:32.960]
Roy De Bois.

[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:34.960]
Why sure wish I had that?

[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:35.500]
What's that one?

[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:37.580]
Oh, we have the traveling wheelbarris, don't we?

[00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:38.720]
What's the name of that thing?

[00:54:40.340 --> 00:54:42.000]
Is it the ancient wheelbarris?

[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:42.640]
I think so.

[00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:43.840]
No.

[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.120]
Aging with something.

[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:47.260]
The ancient wheelbarris?

[00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.400]
What the hell is the name of that thing?

[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.380]
Anyway, so thank you, Lynn.

[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:52.880]
Even though you did put three on here, we'll get the wrap set about that.

[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.360]
Here's Bob Weir of the Dead and Rat Dog.

[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:56.400]
Bob Weir.

[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:56.960]
Huh?

[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:58.460]
Is he relation to the...

[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.000]
Is he kind of the golfer, the Canadian golfer, Mike Weir, you think?

[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:02.020]
No, no.

[00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:03.020]
Bob Weir.

[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:03.680]
Put him on here.

[00:55:03.740 --> 00:55:05.920]
W-E-I-E-I-R.

[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:07.520]
I have no idea who that is.

[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:08.640]
It's from the Grape of Death.

[00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.600]
Oh, wow, we're going to put him on there.

[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.120]
Guess we're going to put Jerry Garcia.

[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:15.800]
Yeah.

[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:16.360]
Sure.

[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:23.260]
I say with great reluctitude, because anybody that's one of those deadheads really, really their

[00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:24.960]
taste is deep inside their tush.

[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:26.060]
Deep in their tush.

[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.080]
Here's a call from Plantation.

[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:29.380]
Hello.

[00:55:29.940 --> 00:55:30.800]
Hey, Veal.

[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:31.500]
Yes, sir.

[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:33.180]
I called to put Jerry on.

[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.400]
Jerry Garcia.

[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:36.120]
It's my psychic powers again.

[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.720]
Bob Weir's alive.

[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:38.960]
He is?

[00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:41.740]
Yeah, he ought to be dead because he sucks.

[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:42.520]
Okay.

[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.800]
But Jerry is the man.

[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:47.260]
And even when he was alive, he was gratefully dead.

[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:48.300]
Hey, man.

[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:48.880]
Well said.

[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.100]
And for real in the morning, he sounds like Bobby Firestein.

[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.620]
Ever seen together?

[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.120]
Yeah, no.

[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.560]
Ever seen together?

[00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:57.160]
Ever seen together?

[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:57.200]
Never had that.

[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:57.640]
Ever had that.

[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:57.680]
Ever had that.

[00:55:57.680 --> 00:55:57.700]
Ever had that.

[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:58.260]
Ever had that.

[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.520]
So let's cross Bob Weir out because he's still alive.

[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.600]
They hit him with five shots and he's still alive.

[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:04.620]
I just love the way that Solotso said that.

[00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:05.820]
He's obsessed with it.

[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:07.020]
And then he does that jaw thing.

[00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:09.560]
I wasn't with a jaw.

[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.560]
It was more like with a teeth.

[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.940]
Yeah, whatever it is, like side to side.

[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:13.660]
Mm-hmm.

[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:16.480]
You know what Sunny said?

[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.900]
The thing you blow their brains all over your nice cyberleaks suit.

[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.600]
The thing you blow their brains all over your nice cyberleaks suit.

[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:21.820]
Okay.

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:25.080]
The thing you blow their brains all over your nice cyberleaks suit.

[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:25.760]
That's what's interesting.

[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:28.480]
How about John Bonham or Glenn Miller?

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:30.220]
Oh, we're not going to put Glenn Miller on it.

[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.420]
I mean, why not?

[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.340]
You're not in the mood?

[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:34.000]
I'm not in the mood.

[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.660]
Oh, man, are you getting old?

[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:37.760]
Wow.

[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:38.960]
I got in the other room.

[00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:39.620]
We got the seed.

[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:40.720]
That's a scary.

[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.220]

Duane almond or the almond brothers. Of course he's on air boy. He's a rambling gambler man

[01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.600]

[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.260]
When father paranoia is there in the bar

[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:58.480]

[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.020]
Don't look at me

[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:44.860]
I have put him in there only Eric hasn't put him on the list yet. Eric will get around to what he's under a lot of pressure

[01:20:44.860 --> 01:20:45.580]
But

[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:49.260]
But it's good timing because this just hot off the press

[01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.720]
McCartney involved in scuffle in London

[01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:54.480]
Is he dead now too

[01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:02.840]
Illusionist David Blaine was not magic for Paul McCartney the former beetle was involved in a shoving match when a photographer tried to take his picture

[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.180]
Near the London side of Blaine's latest stunt an official say today

The official McCartney spokesman Jeff Baker said the former beetle fired fired him when he learned that Baker right in form of the photographer

[01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:19.260]
That the pop star will be visiting the site on the river tams where Blaine is trying to live without food for 44 days

[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:23.200]
While suspended from a crane in a plastic box and there's actually a photo

[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.520]
Of David Blaine who's being suspended from a crane in a plastic box. He's a dork

[01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:32.760]
David Blaine. Yeah, am I supposed to know who that is?

[01:21:33.160 --> 01:21:37.440]
This is what he does. What he's doing now. This is what he does. Yeah, the other reason he's famous

[01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.340]
But he's an illusionist man. Oh, yeah

[01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:46.960]
The Illusionist David from reinstated and described reports of a fracas is exaggerated a fracas. There's that fracas

[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:51.660]
London's metro police however said they were investigating two counter allegations of common assault

[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:56.000]
Following a dispute near Blaine side between a photographer and a group of friends at about 1 a.m

[01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:59.380]
London time today the police didn't name any of those involved in the incident

[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:06.080]

Central London Soho district on Thursday evening

[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:14.300]
One of the lads tipped off the press who were watching a man in a sleeping bag at a box that Paul was passing the statement said

[01:22:14.300 --> 01:22:18.160]
Paul then continued to joke by telling his mate who's his publisher that he was fired

[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:22.820]
Paul then got into a car and went to home reports that this was a fracas or fracas

[01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:25.940]
Or anything other than a group of friends on a night out or heavily exaggerated

[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:29.380]
Reports of his death are premature and yoddy-oddy. Okay boring story

[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:37.980]
Just like Paul McCartney with all due respect. I mean when you can get one up by Michael Jackson. You know what I'm saying? Oh, oh, you can't be too swift

[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:45.220]

Frank Zappa Freddie Mercury Keith Moon Jean Kruppa

Jean Kruppa was always annoying to me. They stay them back in the early days of TV

[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.900]
It was something about the way he looked was just

[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:13.120]

Very white two-pack Jim Croci and Sunny Bono. What a list huh? What a magnificent list and we got a long way to go

[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:43.380]
Lots more names on his list

[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:48.920]
But so far John Lennon he's like he's pulled away from the packets like secretary in the Belmont 1973

[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:51.100]
Pulled away from the pack left him in the lurch

[01:23:52.700 --> 01:23:57.360]
Here's a call from Margie. Hello. Good morning. Yes, sir. Michael Niel. How you doing good?

Okay, and just just recent two as a matter of fact. How soon they forget? Yeah, no kidding just days ago

[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.140]

[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.840]
Yeah, well once in a month every few years we have somebody says

[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:36.620]
All of these things right are positive as opposed to the usual sputum that we get you know

[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:39.900]
When it doubt they spute them out

[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:41.560]
How do I?

[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:46.600]
I'm looking for that Janice Joplin thing and I know it's on one of these this they're eating out worth it

[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:50.120]
You know, I love that. That's one of my favorites. You do that's one of the first ones I heard

[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.120]
And it almost killed me so I wanted the early AC and gold library once here and I'm poxking around with him

[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:24.440]
I'll find hate her like I do yeah, but it's especially funny

[01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:27.280]
I guess it probably be a better idea to do it during a break

[01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:31.400]
Well, let's see because I have these all in a drawer. I see

[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:34.660]
Soon I'm saying I got the book here. I have the whole AC and library

[01:25:34.660 --> 01:25:39.860]
Well, why don't you look into book you lazy spick and tell me which one it is and then he's a you can reach right back behind you

[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.560]
There and grab it since years are in order

[01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:45.440]
I can like fumble around in the drawer here and kill some really good time since it's only nine till noon

[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:48.280]
We don't usually reach behind when I grab it. I see

[01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:57.800]
You got it yet? Well, no, it's under under the a categorical thing. They're like under Janice Joplin under like dead the broads

[01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.000]
Who couldn't sing for Schmidt

[01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:07.780]
Here's a lady in bokeh. Hello. Hello. Yes, how about patchy climb patchy climb is magnificent good

Thank you very much and have a great day. Thanks. Bye. Bye patchy climb

[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:19.080]
Every time we do one of these about the hello, I may have and I don't think we did this exact one, but regardless

[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:21.280]
patchy climb deserves a mention

[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:28.460]
What's what the hell's the song I'm trying to think of crazy patchy climb. No, not crazy walking after midnight

[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.380]
Remember that sure

[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.480]
And even though country music does suck

[01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:35.940]
largely

[01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:41.060]
How about Marty Robbins a white sport coat and a pink carnation bow when I was a kid

[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:44.600]
It was on Columbia Records. I had that. I love that song. Sure because it's a pink carnation

[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.140]
Yeah, I like pink

[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.640]
That was the first inkling

[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.960]
The first pink thing that I had of being a bag

[01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:56.360]
Ma'am put Marty Robbins on there. I'm you know, it's my show. I'll put whoever the hell I want

[01:26:56.860 --> 01:26:58.320]
Marty Robbins. Who get a voter to?

[01:26:58.900 --> 01:26:59.660]
What the hell not?

[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:01.260]
So you ready?

[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:03.460]
For Janice Joplin

[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.540]
And now another additional

[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:08.880]
What is

[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:14.360]
Today what if Janice Joplin were an Ava and the lady

[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.880]
Yes, may I help you

[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:21.040]
Hey

[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.980]
CUNY next time to find out what would happen if Nancy Reagan lost weight

[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:47.120]
This bulletin just then it appears that the first lady has disappeared. We next we ask

[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.020]
What

[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:49.260]
Yeah

[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:55.400]
Okay, just for my homework and future reference give me the uh disc in the number of the cut 649

[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.820]
This six number four. I never would have found it nice work George and by the way

[01:28:00.820 --> 01:28:05.220]
We're number one and we want to pat everybody on the back connected with a show except for Scott because he hasn't been there long enough

[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.020]
Now we don't want to pat you on the back. You have don't start taking credit

[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:16.020]
All those Scott parallel the real Scott. He did great. We had about a 8.5 and Moe had a point one his way we're figuring it out

[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.140]
What you think what's the point Moe?

[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:21.880]
And nobody wants your crappy key chain either. It's pretty depressing

[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:27.820]
We better get busy on that Scott for real key chain then we'll start raising some cash. Well, we talked about that

[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.260]
What do you mean we talk about?

[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:32.440]
The money that we spent making these other ones

[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:37.960]
We better wait until we sell some of them before we start making new alternative products if you know it all yeah

[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:41.940]
Besides let's save us something to do next year, huh

[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:48.580]
Yeah, but then we're not gonna raise any money this year and there's gonna be a bunch of little dogs and putty cats that are gonna like go

[01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:53.920]
Want to get a wine and clear a hundred grand by the end of the year we will yeah based on what

[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:58.680]
Based on it's it always happens. This is the slowest the creepiest the

[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:05.060]
Most depressing fundraiser ever been involved in and then they're sending Joe and Mark with their limited audience to begin with

[01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.120]
Out in the middle of the guy that ever glades in some kind of a paddle boat. I mean, what is that?

[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.720]
Embarrassing kind of a freaking fundraiser is that huh

[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.740]
Here's a call from Memorial Gebbles. Oh

[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.740]
Okay, how about about a half an hour?

[01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:24.700]
Tell me to advance warning. Yeah, who's on his weedies this morning

[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.540]
Here's North Miami. Hello

[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.440]
Yes, sir

[01:29:34.220 --> 01:29:36.180]
I think it's time for you to depart

[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:36.840]
Oh

[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:38.660]
That was a work of art

[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:48.800]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Yeah, let's get the Brahms and Beethoven list Chopin Franz list

[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:53.320]
1156 four minutes. I'm uh till noon

[01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:59.120]
See if I was real quick. It's all it's almost not worth it. You know, I'm seeing by the time you get to this like doing

[01:30:00.340 --> 01:30:01.520]
It's really not worth it

[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:04.640]
Hey, I'll tell you where vickeners are there are four lotterdale now

[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.500]
A lot of roaches there in used to love vickeners. They love Don and Bob's too, but they're out of business and vickeners was legendary as well

[01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.440]
Because they had great fresh food. They had that delicious

[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.720]
Special hot sauce and they had the roaches to white hot and vickeners is in South Florida now

[01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:20.960]
They're on federal highway just out the barbola on the tunnel on the east side

[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:26.480]
vickeners is like a flashback in time to what really great restaurants used to be before all the fast food crap

[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:30.400]
Go into vickeners enjoy a burger or hot dog serve fresh hot and fast

[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:33.480]
vickeners was brought to four lotterdale by the same guys who feed you

[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:37.880]
Cheaper-grachee burger. They use the same great fresh hundred percent ground-shock meat as cheaper

[01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:41.680]
Grachee burger and offer you an incredible big fat one a quarter pound hot dog

[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:45.940]
What makes vickeners different from anybody else in town? I'll tell you right now like I said only moments ago

[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:51.640]
Their burgers and dogs are served with a big signature meat sauce poured on top giving you an amazing combination of flavors

[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:53.660]
That do like a little tap dance in your puss

[01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:58.700]
So if you're looking for something else to try vickeners is about all kinds of great dishes including a great breakfast menu

[01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:02.220]
I'm let's cook to order French toast pancakes all your favorite side dishes

[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:04.920]
So stop by vickeners even for if you're from like Buffalo

[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:08.380]
We'll still let you in and see what all the talk is about vickeners on federal highway

[01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.400]
Just out the brow of Bolivar and the tunnel on the east side in four lotterdale

[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:15.380]
Be sure and tell them that old Rochester maven neo-rodger sent you by to vick and herbs

[01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:18.140]

[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:45.480]
You're terminating great Davis has become his number one goal now

[01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:51.980]
And he's leading candidate's gourding to the new balls now

[01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:53.420]
Arnold

[01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:57.220]
Tell the voters to be Davis away

[01:31:59.220 --> 01:32:02.920]
Well he's married to a Democrat named for real

[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.360]
He's got her own being now she's not Chia

[01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:09.760]
And like his muscle and why he's gonna keep his feet of woman eyes

[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:13.660]
I don't read now I don't read but unlike it can a D

[01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.400]
He is excellent

[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:17.440]
Dr. Green now just like

[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.560]
It's hard to

[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:32.460]
I just took a few copy window and the other good news is that there are people walking around

[01:32:32.460 --> 01:32:35.300]
That even raining right now it's a little bit of a low

[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:41.940]
Yeah, ain't that exciting? No, I thought it was anyway somebody says what about tiny Tim

[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:42.440]
Oh

[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:22.720]
I

[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:32.220]
Okay, so let's get tiny Tim on air give voter too

[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:35.040]
Little comic relief here's what it says from Jerry and Bonita Springs

[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:38.660]
I'd like to suggest Harry Chapin for today's pool. Why not Jerry

[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:43.540]
Why not you only had two at singles but his albums were a real piece of work both new musically and lyrically

[01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:45.140]
And I would say he was a piece of work too

[01:33:46.340 --> 01:33:48.680]
It was one of my favorite singer songwriters

[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:52.700]
I waited till your show was over yesterday to vote on the best that actors pull I kept waiting for Bert Lancaster

[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:54.660]
He was one of the finest actors to work in film

[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:00.120]
The reawanna apology to Jerry and Bonita Springs nobody ever said Bert Lancaster. Nope. Sorry your eternity

[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:01.540]
Right

[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:08.560]
What else birdman of alcatraz sure that was really if the show hadn't been shortened for baseball

[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:12.760]
I'm sure we would have remembered Bert. I voted instead for Steve McQueen's as you're a lots of a vote

[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:14.400]
I mean Steve McQueen was no uh

[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:15.940]
Bert Lancaster that's for the answer

[01:34:15.940 --> 01:34:21.860]
Bert Lancaster was like a manly man. He was a man. No not a man's man. That was more like

[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.300]
Uh, wrong power

[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.800]
Favorite dead musicians miles Davis and John Coltrane somebody says one of these jazzy guys

[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:31.040]
I guess we'll put them on there

[01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.460]
Hey jaz

[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:34.660]
Can't stand it makes me sick

[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:38.600]
Yeah, I mean we're gonna put those people on there and call that music. What about Mitch Miller?

[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:43.920]
For Marchist in New York by the way. How about you yet a white hotter two when it's time

[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:51.540]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon world's world's world's line

[01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:53.180]
How about

[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:56.040]
One and a two huh

[01:34:56.500 --> 01:34:58.700]
We must have somebody where uh huh

[01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:02.020]
Lawrence a walk. What do you say? Yeah, my mom would well on the list

[01:35:02.540 --> 01:35:04.240]
No, Lawrence welcomes a musician

[01:35:05.140 --> 01:35:07.900]
That's my point. No here's the lemon sisters

[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:13.900]
The right path is on me see there they're right there is the immediate reason my pbs should be taken off the ear

[01:35:13.900 --> 01:35:17.340]
We should stop subsidizing it as the fact that they're still showing old Lawrence welk shows

[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:21.780]
If they can't do better than that with the money that they're always begging for them putting that crap on here

[01:35:21.780 --> 01:35:24.980]
Then they ought to just shut the damn thing down. Okay. Yep. They also have front line

[01:35:25.540 --> 01:35:31.640]
No wonder that uh front line is cock-o-kay like maybe once every five years there's something that's really like a revolutionary

[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:33.260]
Uh, then they haven't done squat

[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:39.440]
That thing that was supposed to be the big expose on Iraq and all that way was crap. It was stuff we already knew about

[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:43.340]
I can see that stuff on a cbc anytime, eh?

[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:48.280]
So that's what I just got what you just get a thousand dollars for a band of pet rescue

[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:51.300]
Well, no a big tumor on your left arm

[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:56.540]
No thyroid disease by stub you got your stub and your bonus is on it

[01:35:58.380 --> 01:36:01.440]
See they're not gonna dick around because then it becomes illegal things

[01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:05.820]
See so what they'll do is they'll stall I mean the audience ever stop them before the audience won't believe it

[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:10.240]
But it's true what this company is so cheap the beesleys that they'll stall whatever it says in your deal

[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.560]
Is the latest that they can pay you on something

[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:18.580]
Then that's when you'll get it if you're lucky if you if you if you get it at all, but I mean now you you get it

Because Patsy ain't got squat

[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:57.260]
See buddy Holly I must be honest with you. That was about to say and yes this is subjective who is your all-time favorite dead musician

[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:00.940]
Not the top five not your 30 most favorite but the the one

[01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:04.540]
But buddy Holly I mean he was you know

[01:41:05.820 --> 01:41:12.300]
What he was one of the early rock and roll type stars and all that crap, but his music really wasn't all that good

[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:17.440]
Yeah, no I agree with you. I just like the couple songs is all that'll be I mean Peggy Sue was like

[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:21.300]
Spastic when you come right down to it. Well look at that the goddamn sweet just scored

[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.280]
A severing

[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.520]
And he peaked the above hand of that bill for to tie the game at long

[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:29.900]
It didn't last long anyway

[01:41:30.500 --> 01:41:35.460]
Buddy Holly I hate to say that because it's like a slap in a face for anybody who liked him, but he wasn't that good

[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:37.460]
Peggy Sue

[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:42.980]
Yeah, oh Peggy Sue, you know, and that'll be the day a

[01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:45.240]
You know, yes, he wasn't very good buddy Holly

[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.020]
I just wanted to say that over and over again because you don't want to know why why because I don't think he was very good

[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:57.460]
Oh, I'm Mary gay couple say they refused entry into the US because in American customs officer wouldn't accept their clearance forms as a family

[01:41:58.260 --> 01:42:02.500]
Kevin Barossa. I wonder if he's can dilute Barossa the guy who drives it wins our harness raceway

[01:42:03.060 --> 01:42:04.880]
Kevin Barossa and Joe Varnell

[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:12.760]
So they ended their trip to Jojo because the customs officials at Toronto's Pearson Airport insisted they fill out separate forms as single people

[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:13.080]
Oh

[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:20.360]
Barossa said he complained to a custom supervisor and was told a couple wouldn't be allowed a wedded the West as a family because

[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.320]
This country doesn't recognize same-sex marriages this country meaning the USA

[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:32.720]
Barossa works as an advocate for same-sex marriage said the couple made the decision not to fill out separate forms because they felt there was an insult to their dignity

[01:42:34.680 --> 01:42:38.940]
Barossa and Varnell were heading to Brazelt in Georgia to speak at a human rights conference

[01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:42.020]
Oh, I know if I was going to go out there and campaign for understanding in humanity

[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:44.960]
I'd be going to Brazelt in Jojo wouldn't you sure?

[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:51.440]
The couple were married in 2001 before last June's Ontario court decision to recognize the rights of gays to marry

[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:55.540]
Their marriage was recognized as a legal union light of the Ontario court of appeal decision

[01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:00.380]
The couple's attorney Doug Elliott said he's spoken to Ottawa on the issue and is investigating whether legal action

[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:07.120]
To be taken against the governments of Canada and the US to their ass baby to the rest we don't yeah because probably asses your middle name

[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.840]
We got the mad dog at two. We got the Humper at four including the prestigious Dave Wands that show it's five

[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.220]
But Dave Wands that that's another guy. He's I put him in a same category with buddy Holly

[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.200]
highly overrated

[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:25.960]
Seven o'clock Marlins on deck seven thirty five the game of the season the Marlins clinging to a half game lead on a philly's for the wild

[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.300]
However, you don't understand the good part of that deal is don't you Scott?

[01:43:29.140 --> 01:43:34.480]
Is the half game it's in the lost column philly's have lost one more game? Yeah, the marlins have one extra game

[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.920]
So right that's right philly's have one fewer game in the game that they have played they lost it

[01:43:38.920 --> 01:43:41.720]
So they have the game in hand so they were like to win out

[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.840]
Which is unlikely but if they were to win their last nine or whatever they got left then they they're in they pretty much had their

[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:53.080]
Playoff destiny in their hands before they start with the philly's they got the whole thing in their hands

[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:56.980]
What about little Laurie London you think he's dead probably yeah, but that he's got the whole world in his hands

[01:43:56.980 --> 01:44:03.280]
Yeah, you do you sure or you need some help horn ball they play it all over the place forget that real fast

[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:39.420]
Beautiful voice you don't want to talk about guys with a beautiful voice unless maybe referring to the African Queen Johnny

You still have two lifelines left. We are on the hundred dollar question. You know what? Regis want to pull the audience?

[01:56:14.240 --> 01:56:16.040]
No, I like to add a lifeline

[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.200]
I'll actually know there's only three lifelines you've used one you have two laughs. No, no, no

[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:24.500]
I get another lifeline. It's a brand new one to the game

[01:56:24.500 --> 01:56:27.800]

[01:56:40.100 --> 01:56:41.700]
You run you run you run you run

[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:49.680]
Here's the fact from James this is I work in Indian trail north Carolina with a crazy bastard or is that old dirty bastard

[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:54.800]
Who just moved here from bokeh he's got me listening to you on the internet also keeps telling me about this video

[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:58.720]
You have with puff daddy on a millionaire show, but I've yet to hear it and can't find it on Neil's noises

[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:01.900]
Can you play it or tell me what CD it's on there you go James

[01:57:02.540 --> 01:57:07.360]
If the majority of your listeners are as crazy as this as well, you must be in hell your awesome and keep up the Schmidt

[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:11.500]
The case a lot James and here you go. The price is right. I'm sure glad you played that for him. Yeah

[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:15.260]
Rick Nelson somebody says how could we forget Ricky Nelson, huh?

[01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:21.020]
I bet you have that one of those CDs here somewhere Rick Nelson CD you think I know you got him there

[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:23.900]
Oh, no, no, I don't want you to play it

[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:29.980]
Yasha hyphids the greatest violinist of all time right

[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:32.740]
Yasha hyphids oh you made

[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:38.300]
I don't think we'll put in Yasha on there, but Rick Nelson definitely John Lennon is the one the pony race

[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.500]
He's got 90 you're all time favorite dead musician, but

[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:47.720]
Then it's pretty interesting Elvis Presley 40 Jamarson 39 as Jamarson continues right on the King's ass

[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:53.980]
Bob Marley 23 Jimmy Hendrix 22 kind of hard to separate those two maybe by a hair

[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:59.020]
Kurt Cobain 22 he's tied with Jimmy Hendrix. They're in a dead flat footed tie

[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:04.500]
Frank's an opera 18 Freddie Mercury 15 Stevie Wonder 50 Sadia Chris 13

[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:14.620]
Huchi Kuchi. Yeah, look at that Kuchi. Uh Frank's that you do it Frank's apple 12 here we go. I see you right back Roy Orbison 7

[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.340]
He's starting to move up a little bit after we after we played that crap

[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.000]
I wish tell we had that other one with what was it called you got it you got it no

[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:32.800]
Very white six Ben Bon Scott five John bottom five Jim Kroche five Marvin Gaye and Patsy Kleiner tied with folk

[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:38.280]
Keep moon and Jean Krupa and Tupac and the Johnny Cash have three and after that

[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:41.860]
It's really teeny tiny tailed haters including tiny Tim is only got one

[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:45.200]
Now let's see is there anybody with no votes? Oh, yeah

[01:58:45.820 --> 01:58:49.400]
Janice drop-unstill even after you played that bit in fact that probably since did

[01:58:50.140 --> 01:58:55.640]
She ain't got squat she belongs on that other pole we're gonna do which musician are you glad is dead? Oh

[01:58:56.120 --> 01:59:02.780]
Duane all like that Duane all men don't have none sunny bono war and Zeevan hairy chape and Sid Vicious

[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:06.100]
Out of 379 votes they all got the big zero now

[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:09.100]
Speaking of a big zero very jackass

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:13.540]
In the heraldous morning in his column called in my opinion

[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:17.440]
Met's show interest in Shamby for radio

[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:21.140]
Makes me want to play

[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.300]
We like

[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:41.980]
Anyway, Miami radio announcer boob shamby who's developed into a top talent as emerged as a strong candidate for radio job of the

[01:59:41.980 --> 01:59:46.440]
York Mets and the marlin should try to keep him by offering him more than three innings per game

[01:59:46.440 --> 01:59:52.200]
He does now because of the lure of broadcasting in this hometown of New York only an offered to do marlin's lead radio

[01:59:52.200 --> 01:59:58.760]
announcer would probably make shamby think twice about accepting an offer from the Mets should one be extended and even that might not be enough

[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:04.120]
Shamby isn't commenting on the issue but he's a known commodity among the decision makers at New York's

[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:09.820]
Fand WFAN which is seeking replacement for retiring legend Bob Murphy. It's a lion drier

[02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:17.560]
Bob Murphy. You know a lion drier. No awful. It's terrible Gary Cohen Murphy's current partner likely would assume the lead role on the broadcast

[02:00:18.580 --> 02:00:23.040]
Although Dave and Horn has had a distinguished career and has a classic baseball voice

[02:00:23.040 --> 02:00:25.040]
He makes more mistakes than Shamby

[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:30.600]
Among other things Van Horn this season is identified a ground ball as a pop-up and a ground rule double as a

[02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:34.600]
Homer although he was quick to correct him so Van Horn is still functional

[02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:41.420]
But the shamby van Horn that that's like somebody who's hooked up to like a life support. They're still functional

[02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:43.280]
Yeah like Mo

[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:50.220]
But the shamby van Horn team hasn't achieved the commited chemistry anywhere near the level of the Joe Angel David O'Brien tandem in the marlin's

[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:50.700]
infancy

[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:59.000]
The reason isn't surprising Van Horn style is old school and shamby comes from the new generation baseball announcers

[02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.020]
Shamby isn't going to make a pop culture reference that might fly over Van Horn's head

[02:01:04.160 --> 02:01:07.320]
Was he talking about that bad piece? Oh, that's a shot

[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:11.180]
Because the room where I'm here and I haven't met the event Horby's got a worse hair piece than Mo

[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:13.080]
Huck and that'd be now wait till you're this

[02:01:14.040 --> 02:01:17.920]
Very jackass taking a really good dig nice god. Very little pansy

[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:22.260]
With two years left on his contract van Horn figures to return even though

[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:28.740]
His vanilla delivery and over reliance on statistics hasn't exactly energized the audience. Oh, what a line

[02:01:28.740 --> 02:01:29.560]
ha-ha

[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:34.200]
Even though it's coming from the barely functional Barry jackass

[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:40.980]
With two years left on his contract van Horn figures to return even though his vanilla delivery

[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:44.600]
It's up up and away and over reliance on statistics

[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:47.940]
Hasn't exactly energized the audience under statement of the century

[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:52.820]
It's about time somebody wrote ripping at the davan boring and as he is terminal man

[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:58.020]
The exciting year the marlins have had he's about as exciting as a frog's for it nothing zero

[02:01:59.420 --> 02:02:03.780]
He's the kind of guy that when he has an orgasm. It's kind of like like that. That's it

[02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:07.680]
It's more like that

[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:09.740]
Here's Miami B. Chilla

[02:02:10.160 --> 02:02:10.920]
Marie skip

[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:13.960]
Moriscape excellent. Thank you sir. How can we forget?

[02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:16.580]
But although I understand he's got a very hot wife

[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:19.580]
Not more a skib uh davan boring

[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:25.760]
That's all that anybody talks about when you mentioned is him always got a hot wife at a bad hair piece worse than mo

[02:02:26.520 --> 02:02:29.900]
And he's got a vanilla delivering and he ought to go up up and away

[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.260]
And look oh

[02:02:39.740 --> 02:02:41.940]
And there we go

[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:48.460]
Oh

[02:02:52.820 --> 02:02:56.160]
Even groupies out turning us down

[02:02:56.940 --> 02:03:00.220]
It's so hard to keep the hips down

[02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:02.800]
Get me my wheelchair

[02:03:04.540 --> 02:03:08.060]
Wish my face was a weird egg to move

[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:12.040]
It's kind of recleaned and straitable

[02:03:13.100 --> 02:03:15.360]
Brother dung so difficult

[02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:18.880]
Get me my wheelchair

[02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:24.340]
I'm so old and I'm looking only

[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:28.740]
Now, dearly, don't bury no boy

[02:03:28.740 --> 02:03:33.000]
Pretty soon, I'll be the one to mother

[02:03:35.260 --> 02:03:36.220]
Oh

[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:37.360]
My naked eye

[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:39.820]
needs a cave

[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:41.360]
To me

[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:45.460]
Oh, I ran my mansion

[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:47.660]
Then that bullet's on

[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:49.600]
Then you're crazy

[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:52.840]
Oh, boy

[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.980]
You still look sharp when we were last

[02:03:57.320 --> 02:04:00.600]
But if you think that we look really bad

[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.000]
Check keep reaching south that's true he said

[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.140]
Get me my wheelchair

[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:12.900]
Voices shots but I'll still sell them will you

[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.660]
Cuz it sounds good next to Bob Dylan

[02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:20.320]
Now that we've made a killing

[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:23.380]
Get me my wheelchair

[02:04:24.200 --> 02:04:26.640]
Oh, I can't hear it now

[02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.160]
My scale vector

[02:04:36.500 --> 02:04:42.660]
Pro 46 I bet you can't believe I found I can you I believe it I found it best of 92

[02:04:42.660 --> 02:04:45.760]
A lot of good stuff on his matter back for example

[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:48.900]
Oh, I think I probably already have to stuck this in there for example

[02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:55.920]
Oh

[02:04:56.980 --> 02:04:58.280]
And stuff like that

[02:05:01.020 --> 02:05:05.480]
Here's West West Palm Beach hello, hey, I love you ma'am. Yes, sir

[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:51.080]
Sky News topic here it is

[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:56.360]
It's not coming up too quick, but here it is Sky News. Let's go

[02:06:00.340 --> 02:06:03.240]
Liberal Democrats take Brent East seed

[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:05.300]
Uh

[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.760]
Rape Council attacked women

[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:16.500]
You got it there's nothing here about the Dixie chicks that was just uh just a whole week girl. Huh a whole act

[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:24.640]
It was a whole acts but anyway this Sky News 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and team for rise and wireless land

[02:06:24.640 --> 02:06:27.620]
Speaking of news White House tight-lived over Kennedy book flap

[02:06:28.340 --> 02:06:30.740]
Maybe Catherine Harris was on that plane. What do you think?

[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:38.060]
The White House is keeping in arms like the controversial new book alleging that former president Lyndon Johnson had a hand in the

[02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:43.540]
1963 slang of his predecessor John F. Kennedy. Oh my god. Remember I talked about this book? Yes, you did

[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:44.660]
The twist

[02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:52.880]
Blood money and power how LBJ kill JFK is by bar McClellan White House spokesman Scott McClellan's father

[02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:55.600]
You ready for that?

[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:02.880]
The younger McClellan recently brushed his first aside efforts again to comment on the text

[02:07:02.880 --> 02:07:07.580]
Drily telling reporter. Thank you for the opportunity, but I'm not gonna have any comment on it

[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:10.860]
Scott McClellan 35 is not the only big player in US politics

[02:07:10.860 --> 02:07:14.700]
His brother Mark 40 heads the FDA. You ready for this

[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:24.260]
His brother Mark heads the FDA his mother Carol Keaton strayhorn 63 is controller in Texas president Bush's home state

[02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:31.580]
Bar McClellan divorced from a strayhorn years ago appears to make a splash when his book hits stores in September 30th

[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.020]
In it he would allegedly report that

[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:40.060]
He reportedly alleges that Johnson's personal lawyer organized Kennedy's killing in Dallas after the young president

[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.280]
Planned to pick a different running mate in the 64 elections

[02:07:43.580 --> 02:07:49.540]
How do you like that? Wow, so I'll put that over in my pile of things too. I haven't even bought the what you call a book yet

[02:07:49.900 --> 02:07:52.420]
Al Franken the ELSE of Franken book

[02:07:53.380 --> 02:07:58.620]
So many books to buy and so little time and of course so many trips to the deli then and so many candidates

[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:05.160]
You know, I know if I were gonna run for president for the highest office in the world actually

[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:09.680]
I'd probably hit for the deli then have me as a good play to kishki with some nice gravy on it

[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:13.280]
Then I'd get over to pick a nurse for a couple of Rochester whitehats

[02:08:15.060 --> 02:08:19.220]
About a pound and a half of that hot sauce on it get my kiski's really churning real good

[02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:21.780]
Wesley Clark let me say it again

[02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:26.300]
Compare to himself that you really were been a connective regard to his view on the war or the arach attack

[02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:31.700]
Not too uh enthusiastic about this old Wesley Clark thing. I like a lot of you bad-bagging jumpers out there

[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:35.460]
A lot of people are saying oh well, he's the one that can win. Well, how do you know that?

[02:08:35.460 --> 02:08:36.880]
High based on what hype

[02:08:37.800 --> 02:08:41.840]
hype and a warrior on all of that but he's got the little rock arc and saw mafia behind him

[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.700]
That's it. I like how we're dean myself. Okay. I'm a big fan of the dean

[02:08:46.660 --> 02:08:51.100]
That's the plantation. Hello Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, what's up, buddy? How you doing?

[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:55.920]
They just flashed uh thing the dixie chicks just flashed on that miss mbc

[02:08:55.920 --> 02:09:01.380]
Did it really? Yeah, and uh it said a plane the plane they were carrying they were in

[02:09:01.380 --> 02:09:03.640]
Hit a building while taxing

[02:09:04.260 --> 02:09:10.040]
So they probably clipped the finger of stairway or something the plane didn't go down. Stirway to heaven

[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:14.820]
Yeah, that idiot said the plane went down and Scotland people don't know how to read well

[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.300]
That they get you know watered two words, you know and all of a sudden

[02:09:17.300 --> 02:09:19.980]
But I beat but I'm hoping all of a sudden before you know if the sky is falling

[02:09:20.740 --> 02:09:23.320]
Just like this just like this hurricane is a bell

[02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:26.360]
It's supposed to be Terrence Rado apart. It's just that even raining right now

[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:29.680]
All he had to do is read the whole god damn sentence right

[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:34.680]
All right, George is a miserable asshole. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks mom

[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:35.340]
Uh

[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:38.800]
Let's see passing during custody after rushing cockpit door

[02:09:38.800 --> 02:09:41.320]
There's not a word about the dixie chicks on the CNN website

[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:47.080]
And I'm going to msnbc right now. Here's the guy wiping his ass on some spot. Oh god

[02:09:47.860 --> 02:09:51.400]
Uh, a man is in federal custody. Uh, oh, this is yesterday

[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:57.640]
A man was in federal custody yesterday after he tried to break you to an airplane cockpit during a flight from south

[02:09:57.640 --> 02:10:02.340]
Africa to Atlanta the FBI said how do you like that? How come this happened yesterday?

[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:04.620]
And now we're just it just making the rounds

[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:05.520]
hmm

[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:07.720]
Have you heard about this? Nope

[02:10:08.580 --> 02:10:14.140]
Just popped up on CNN federal agents to James Drake 53 in the custody yesterday morning

[02:10:14.140 --> 02:10:19.680]
After South African Airlines flight 7799 landed at Atlanta's Hartstead, Lunar National Airport

[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:24.260]
The planes crew told authorities Drake tried to rush the cockpit through it about six a.m

[02:10:24.980 --> 02:10:30.020]
Some two and a half hours before to plane the schedule land in Atlanta. He was scheduled by passengers and epi

[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:36.500]
He was subdued by two passengers a deputy sheriff and a psychiatrist the FBI said always been to have a shrink on board

[02:10:37.580 --> 02:10:41.960]
The FBI said the incident was not an attempted terrorist act Drake is a US citizen

[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:45.840]
But his hometown was not immediately known immediately known. This is yesterday morning

[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:50.780]
Drake faced his federal charges that include interference with a flight crew member

[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.020]
He was arrested 1987 after a similar incident at domestic airline flight

[02:10:55.020 --> 02:10:59.740]
He didn't stand trial in that case. So I was probably a good idea for not to stand trial so we could do it again

[02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:05.960]
You know what it sounds like to me? He maybe he's kind of that guy that calls us. I'm crazy that girl

[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.200]
But yeah, let's have a big family

[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:09.680]
No doubt

[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.040]
Oh, no doubt was on a plane

[02:11:13.740 --> 02:11:15.780]
Here's Carl spring. Hello. Oh, no

[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:16.640]
Yes, sir

[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:17.780]
Speaking of

Led Zeppin you stay with the heaven I like to nominate that John Bonham is I don't know if he's been on in I share that he's already on

[02:11:24.420 --> 02:11:30.760]
He's not doing too great, but he's on it very documented thing that he played a lot better when after he died and when he was alive

[02:11:30.760 --> 02:11:37.760]
I believe that yeah, that's very documented. He was a lot better drummer. He's got five votes. He's they tied with Marvin Gaye's

[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:43.740]
Right set one more time. Say it again. I said he clip. Okay

[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:49.440]
He's still saying it

Here's a call from Coral Springs. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you today pretty damn good. How are you good?

The voting system is predicting that the punch card is gonna make a comeback

[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:52.500]
85 year old bill rooverall designed the original system right back in the 60s

[02:12:52.500 --> 02:12:57.920]
He remains its biggest fan rooveralls as he never dreamt that his creation could cause so much controversy

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:03.980]
Oh, yeah, let's get that butterfly ballad again. Come on Teresa. La poor you bitch you slut you idiot

Cuz she's a plant. I mean we know why uh Miriam elephants still got her job in Broward

[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:18.380]
And we know it has nothing to do with the color of her skin

[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.740]
That's for her to call from a lady in Tamarack. Hello

Can't get much dead or ugly or right now. There's a few everything

[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:52.700]
Irvison's hard to beat on the other side, but he's not really if you ever actually looked under Joey's hair

[02:13:52.700 --> 02:13:58.780]
You would have been scared is that like looking under mose here? Absolutely wow and see that dog was her pittic lesions on him

The one to two hours

[02:14:19.300 --> 02:14:22.520]
All we're fine

[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:36.880]
What's the track?

[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:46.260]
How can you die from the fact that thoughts?

[02:14:48.100 --> 02:14:50.320]

How my heart stops you schwarz at sign I for my intestines

[02:14:59.120 --> 02:15:02.580]
I guess I should have known what to expect

[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:07.800]
Living in Miami with the kind of service you can in this town

[02:15:08.340 --> 02:15:10.080]
I would act to lead to

[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:22.260]

My fouls were blocked

[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:30.660]
Inside my body

[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:45.860]
Explosion at bag that hurt near the Palestine hotel

[02:15:47.260 --> 02:15:49.860]
Choses MSNBC. What about the DC chicks?

[02:15:49.900 --> 02:15:56.020]
BC and MSNBC's workspace is and we have producer and our correspondent Jim Abelah on the way over there

[02:15:56.020 --> 02:16:03.000]
We'll get information as soon as we get there just some sort of explosion in bag that some sort of explosion in bag that came O'Villah

[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:04.840]
Yeah, how unusual

[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:10.580]
We want to hear about the DC chicks without problems suffering some losses dozens of men

[02:16:10.580 --> 02:16:17.160]
Suspective ambushing us soldiers in a day story. Okay. I said I'm a horrendous little picture story of the ongoing and nightmare

[02:16:18.260 --> 02:16:21.820]
After Isabelle on CNN. So evidently the DC chicks are still alive. Okay

[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:25.280]
Okay evidently

[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:31.200]
Much of each year. Gwyneth some right-wing assholes five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T

[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:34.960]
You know something the DC chicks and Michael more and a lot of other people were taking some real crap

[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:38.540]
Just a few months ago now they're starting to look real real good

[02:16:38.540 --> 02:16:39.760]
You know I'm saying yeah

[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:42.640]
Because coming to find out the thing to what they were talking about

[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:48.460]
Well, we'd never said that he was you know involved with 9-11

[02:16:48.460 --> 02:16:53.960]
Where he got that idea destruction or that he was connected with al-Qaeda or a Samu Yamama or any of those things

[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:56.800]
We just thought it might be a good time to go in there and create a real mess

[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:01.900]
An expensive one oh real expensive mess right and get some cheap gas

[02:17:01.900 --> 02:17:06.320]
Well, I didn't work out to get it. Just remember though now the fact is we're having to supply gas for that

[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:12.180]
That the other day yet last night we want to congratulate Dan rather and John Roberts and the people at CBS news

[02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:15.880]
Who did a fantastic at about 645 last night Eastern time?

[02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:17.700]
Hi job boys

[02:17:17.700 --> 02:17:22.540]
Fantastic job on who's uh who's telling the truth and who's uh what's this all about?

[02:17:23.020 --> 02:17:25.700]
And are they doing like a bait and swish on us here in other words

[02:17:27.740 --> 02:17:32.200]
Yeah, who do you guys kidn with all your bull crap lies on when does the impeachment start?

[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.860]
I mean stop and think about it here

[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:39.800]
We got all these lives being lost every day billions and billions and billions of tax dollars being spent

[02:17:39.800 --> 02:17:43.540]
That could be spent to provide people with health care people with an education

[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:48.080]
That could be used for real home-line security so we didn't have to be crappin our pants 24 hours a day

[02:17:48.080 --> 02:17:49.080]
but no

[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.240]
Couple of low jobs that we got an impeachment thanks to Kenny staring a bunch of rabbit right wing lunatics

[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:00.780]
Something really stinks in America. I'll tell you that right now. And it's drifting

[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:03.100]
I think a Isabelle brought it up here with the with the her

[02:18:04.140 --> 02:18:05.020]
oh, yeah

[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:10.760]
Either that or Josh Friedman's back in there. Here's Pompano. Hello

[02:18:10.760 --> 02:18:16.060]
You couldn't be more right sir on everything you just said especially about Dan rather than the CBS evening news

[02:18:16.060 --> 02:18:19.460]
You saw that it was fantastic. I have one for your poll that died in

[02:18:19.460 --> 02:18:26.260]
December 6, 1976 when after he opened up for Jeff Beckdown to Miami highlight front on Tommy Bolin who

[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:32.560]
I'm going to be replaced Ricky Blackmore and Deep Purple and he replaced Joe Austin James gang

[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:36.100]
Bolin BOL in BOL in BOL in

[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:40.060]
Okay, and thank you very much for us

[02:18:40.060 --> 02:18:41.940]
And then we got thanks

[02:18:42.640 --> 02:18:45.520]
Tommy Bolin there's somebody we never heard of but I don't know I don't like that

[02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:49.700]
I never heard a sharp guy sounds pretty sharp to me. He knows what the side is up and which side is down

[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:51.780]
Now he replaces dirt in the ground

[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:02.400]
You know, Clarence you might want to reconsider your decision. Okay about this Scott character that we found under a dumpster

[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:06.620]
Oh anyway, but what did he just say before that? That was so they're important. Yeah, you're absolutely

[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:10.840]
correct sir the American finally the media are starting to like open up the closet door a little bit

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:16.520]
And they're not licky licky quite so much as they were before it's becoming politically fashionable not to tell the public the truth

[02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.140]
Which I remember is this very revolutionary in America

[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:25.900]
But slowly but surely and that's why you see those poll numbers dropping like a rock

[02:19:26.920 --> 02:19:27.800]
dropping rapidly

[02:19:29.340 --> 02:19:32.920]
Now let's see how the markets down a little bit today. They're unable to continue with this

[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:39.300]
Very bizarre, you know, there's a sudden surge we've seen in the down the Nasdaq they were so pretty because they got rid of that chairman

[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:46.980]
Oh dick grass. Oh yeah, what nice haircut. Oh like I said yesterday boy today before Wednesday the people on CNN

[02:19:46.980 --> 02:19:53.400]
Maria Bacteroma and all his good buddies and both gee, but didn't really do anything wrong and they agreed to give him that money

[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:59.620]
And is that a you know you don't look like crap and all over because he's buddy buddies one of their asshole buddies there on the gambling channel

[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:01.900]
All

[02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:09.540]
These 140 million dollars for a bald-headed geek like him. Oh his biggest uh the biggest thing he had to do every day was a ring that damn bell right

[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:11.760]
If I had a hammer

[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:16.000]
Smack him right on the head with a piece of crap dick grass. Oh what a dick

[02:20:18.060 --> 02:20:20.500]
Here's the call from beautiful steward. Hello

[02:20:38.680 --> 02:20:45.820]
few years ago. He was on a free-based bench so he was dumped off at a hospital with emergency room curb

[02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:46.360]
But

[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:51.200]

We're getting five six seven oh five sixty oh five sixty I gotta look up David Ruffin. I'm not sure he's dead

[02:21:14.440 --> 02:21:19.740]
All right Jimmy Ruffin. I don't know because David Ruffin wasn't the temptations. That was Jimmy Ruffin, right? Right

[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:22.220]
You think place of filler music

No, no, no, that temptations David Ruffin

[02:21:34.660 --> 02:21:37.260]
How do you like that David Eli Ruffin

[02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:45.160]
died June 1st 1991 one of the most recognizable vocalists who averaged from Motown. He was the younger

[02:21:45.160 --> 02:21:45.900]
No

[02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:51.340]
Younger brother of Jimmy Ruffin and the cousin of Melvin Franklin of the temptations

[02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:55.980]
Maybe Jimmy Ruffin wasn't the temptations either. He was just kind of ruffin it

[02:21:57.520 --> 02:22:00.140]
Let's see this it have the circumcises of his death here

[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:01.580]
Uh

[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:08.300]
No, yeah, oh, it's still going on and on and on. How much it's got the whole detail here

[02:22:09.140 --> 02:22:11.800]
Uh a few weeks after his last performance

[02:22:12.580 --> 02:22:17.920]
David Ruffin died in tragic circumstances following an overdose of crack cocaine. How do you like that?

[02:22:18.640 --> 02:22:20.320]
Oh my god those tragic circumstances

[02:22:21.340 --> 02:22:24.460]
Just like Marvin Gaye and had a little crack cocaine and daddy said

[02:22:24.460 --> 02:22:26.580]

[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:28.440]
Well, how do you like that?

[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:35.300]
Why don't I take a listen to walk away from love taken from the album who am I or take a listen to everything coming up love?

[02:22:35.720 --> 02:22:40.600]
Or uh, all of the right on this website a memoir David Ruffin my temptation. Well, isn't that touching?

[02:22:40.600 --> 02:22:43.220]

And then he died damn it. So let's put David Ruffin on there. What do you say? I like David Ruffin

[02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:54.680]
That was a great song what becomes of the brokenhearted. I wonder Steve Lamo is still alive or dead

Think he's probably in the box with Frankie now. That's a lot pal

[02:24:00.960 --> 02:24:06.580]
Yeah, that Frankie Lime guy he never fails every time we do anything about dead artists. Frankie Lime in the teenage is Frankie Lime

Explosion bag head wait a minute more Patricia

[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:28.280]
My picture is no cure.

[02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:35.900]
Bob less than 10 minutes ago around 9 p.m. local time a very large explosion was heard coming from the direction of the Palestine

[02:24:36.420 --> 02:24:43.140]
Hotel and BC staffers did see that explosion it was a brilliant flash of yellow orange light

[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:48.080]
followed by a very large white cloud which is drifted up into the

[02:24:48.080 --> 02:24:53.300]
Nobody said she had woli yet that cloud has been hovering around darkness is setting now on back end

[02:24:53.300 --> 02:25:00.080]
But again a very large explosion it was definitely felt a few kilometers away. In other words, they haven't got any idea

[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:06.760]
They're just vamping now because they don't have any idea what it was. It was very large and it was a very colorful and it was

[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:09.280]
Yadi-adi-adi-a-nia. Nothing about the dish he takes yet

[02:25:09.800 --> 02:25:15.760]
But Hank Goldberg said yes. I'm a homo. No, he said steve elamo is live and well and run

[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:20.220]
Right. He's a little here and he sees him at the track all the time. I'll be damned. I wonder if he knows

[02:25:22.180 --> 02:25:25.940]
Steve Lawrence's brother. I don't know. Hank knows Steve Lawrence's brother

[02:25:25.940 --> 02:25:28.560]
He was the elevator operator for a hundred years at Gulf Stream and Calder

[02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:30.320]
Hank knows who I'm talking about

[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:38.000]
Okay, he has been well is he in there? He has been building the Clareth came in here to tell me that he must be in the building

[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:39.880]
Well, if he's in the building here

[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:41.260]
I don't know where he is

[02:25:41.680 --> 02:25:43.280]
If he's in a building somewhere around

[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:47.000]
And by he and I've discussed that before yeah Steve Lawrence is that's the guy's claim to fame

[02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.780]
He runs the elevator at the track and he Steve Lawrence's brother

[02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:52.620]
You remember Steve Lawrence and he'd eat gorm? Sure

[02:25:53.320 --> 02:25:57.660]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the owner of this police a man flooded to kill Kobe Bryant accuser

[02:25:57.660 --> 02:26:01.760]
Graber is in the United States illegally now. What do you grab? Is illegal in the United States?

[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:02.940]
Having expired

[02:26:03.480 --> 02:26:09.080]
He apparently sent a letter a few weeks back to Kobe Bryant offering to

[02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:15.240]
Take care of the problem meaning to kill the young woman who claims that Kobe Bryant sexually

[02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:16.160]
Ortegaer

[02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:23.020]
Bryant's people been contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and the sting operation

[02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:29.960]
Went underway, which was video and audio tape and as I said it all began with that letter

[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:39.760]
The letter was the trigger point that the real part of the investigations when our undercover investigators contacted him

[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:45.700]
Directly and firstly and met with him on three occasions. This started on September. Okay great

[02:26:46.700 --> 02:26:52.200]
Here's the facts from Zoli in North Miami says congrats on a rating. So I want to nominate Bradley Noel from sublime

[02:26:52.720 --> 02:26:55.480]
You know who that is no who that is. Nope. Well, you do now

[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.680]
NOW ELL well, you got it right there

[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:04.080]
We're gonna put all of these on air because we're asking who is your all-time favorite dead musician not the who's you know

[02:27:04.080 --> 02:27:07.020]
I mean it's a matter of opinion right if you think it's Yasha Hyphids

[02:27:07.020 --> 02:27:09.180]
We're not putting them on it if you think it's Vladimir Horowitz

[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:11.680]
Or any other day's you

[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:15.060]
Although we really care on grace to go be it is another one

[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:17.780]
Although we can't really compete with grates like Bob Marley

[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:19.920]
He still deserves to be on a poll sublime had great son

[02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:20.920]
I don't want to listen to Moe

[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:22.620]
But I do agree with them on a whole dead people thing

[02:27:22.620 --> 02:27:24.940]
I understand that your pain can be to great lost ones

[02:27:24.940 --> 02:27:29.440]
But talking about dead people just isn't my thing some looking forward to more lighthearted pulls in the near future

[02:27:29.940 --> 02:27:34.560]
Oh, Zoli is taking it's a personal okay happens to the best of a Zoli okay. It doesn't bother them

[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:38.700]
On unrelated topic you'd be surprised just how many gay people you have as listeners

[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:43.080]
Young too by the way normal may suck as your agent but he's helped out a few my friends with legal problems

[02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:47.320]
So he's not so bad have a good weekend Leo shameless request bush things you got it Zoli

[02:27:48.040 --> 02:27:51.020]

try to up print this page up but it won't pronounce I'm going to read it off the website.

[02:31:55.040 --> 02:31:57.500]
I think the Rupert Murdock on sky news and then pretty sure.

[02:31:57.580 --> 02:31:58.000]
Got it though.

[02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:02.560]
Dixie chicks in Jetscare, US cut to your rock band and Dixie chicks were at the center

[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:07.500]
of an emergency alert when the wing tip of their executive jet dipped in airport, the

[02:32:07.500 --> 02:32:09.300]
clipped an airport building soon after landing.

[02:32:09.900 --> 02:32:10.320]
Eclipted.

[02:32:10.940 --> 02:32:14.380]
The scare happened at Glasgow Airport moments after they three girls in their party landed

[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:14.920]
from Dublin.

[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:16.440]
They were Dublin their pleasure.

[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:20.620]
No one was injured and their publicist Barbara Sharon said the girls are absolutely fine,

[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:21.920]
but I'm sure it wasn't pleasant.

[02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:25.060]
The incident happened when part of the wing just hit a corner of the building.

[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:25.600]
Nice.

[02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:32.240]
Glasgow airport officials said the Dornier 328 twin engine jet was carrying 15 people.

[02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:36.840]
It was taxing at very low speed toward the general aviation terminal where private aircraft

[02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:40.980]
park when the wing tip clipped the glass go in, stride caught, clied, university, air

[02:32:40.980 --> 02:32:41.620]
squadron building.

[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:42.540]
Oh, I hate that one.

[02:32:42.620 --> 02:32:43.300]
That building gets it.

[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:43.520]

[02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:47.160]
He said fire and ambulance attendant is a matter of routine, but there were no injuries.

[02:32:47.180 --> 02:32:49.240]
As far as we're concerned, it's not a major incident.

[02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:50.540]
It was dealt with very quickly.

[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:54.480]
He said the buildings have a damage to a roof panel and about one or two feet of the

[02:32:54.480 --> 02:32:56.500]
plane's wing tip was damaged end of story.

[02:32:56.960 --> 02:32:58.500]
Yoddy, yoddy, yoddy, and a partridge in poetry.

[02:32:58.760 --> 02:32:59.200]
There you go.

[02:32:59.620 --> 02:33:03.980]
So like the previous guy said, the previous previous guy, even though his intentions may

[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:06.240]
have been good, he was like way off base.

[02:33:06.960 --> 02:33:10.200]
So a couple of words and oh, the Dixie Tick, they're playing went down to Glasgow.

[02:33:10.220 --> 02:33:10.760]
They're dead.

[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:16.020]
You know, you're going to be quoted in dawn some website by saying that.

[02:33:16.260 --> 02:33:16.840]
Oh, I see.

[02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:17.820]
Well, that's what he was saying.

[02:33:17.820 --> 02:33:18.460]
I didn't say that.

[02:33:18.680 --> 02:33:20.240]
I think Catherine Harris might have been on the plane.

[02:33:21.380 --> 02:33:22.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:23.400]
Your favorite.

[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:27.560]
Oh, and that's seriously, I mean, you know, people just they hear a little better, see

[02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:29.360]
something like that and then right away about you.

[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:34.800]

Yamama.

[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:05.400]

[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:06.700]

Aren't you dismayed by that?

[02:34:41.860 --> 02:34:44.120]
They didn't like him as much as I, John.

[02:34:44.640 --> 02:34:46.520]
Well, I got my mindset on that.

[02:34:47.640 --> 02:34:51.100]
Ronnie fans had three Keith Moon 3 Eddie Cochrane 2.

[02:34:52.020 --> 02:34:53.220]

[02:34:53.220 --> 02:34:54.140]
Was that Eddie Cochrane?

[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:54.780]
I don't know.

[02:34:55.220 --> 02:34:55.960]
I think it was.

[02:34:56.340 --> 02:34:58.520]

Glenn Miller 1.

[02:35:01.640 --> 02:35:04.960]
I think I think Tiny Tim and that's ugliest human being of all time.

[02:35:05.140 --> 02:35:05.660]
Oh, man.

[02:35:06.200 --> 02:35:06.680]
Wow.

Oh, a whole bunch of them.

Morris Gibb don't have any out of 470 votes.

[02:35:27.620 --> 02:35:28.160]
That's embarrassing.

[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:29.460]
What an insensitive.

[02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:31.400]
I mean, right from there on Star Island,

[02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:33.760]
what a bunch of insensitive bastards you people are.

[02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:34.840]
Shame on you.

[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:36.400]
Rick Nelson has none.

[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:39.760]
Dean Martin, Joy Ramon, Tommy Bullen, David Ruffin.

[02:35:40.220 --> 02:35:43.040]
By the way, it's Ruffin, not Ruffin, Eric Ruffin.

[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:43.940]
Jesus.

[02:35:44.100 --> 02:35:44.940]
But I wrote Ruffin.

[02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:46.820]
No, I wrote Ruffin, but it's kind of weird.

[02:35:47.080 --> 02:35:47.360]
That's Eric.

[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:48.080]
It's Eric.

[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:48.880]
He's dumb.

[02:35:49.140 --> 02:35:49.760]
It looks like an airplane.

[02:35:50.020 --> 02:35:52.840]
Louis Armstrong and Bradley Noel have the big.

[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:53.260]
Oh.

[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:56.260]
Remember Detroit CKW, the big eight?

[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:57.920]
We got the big crawl of them.

[02:35:58.040 --> 02:35:58.480]
That's bad.

[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:04.080]
And now here's a platter of pages pouring across my fax machine

[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:04.740]
that you just sent.

[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:08.100]
It said that guy from Sublime, this is a chronic gene

[02:36:08.100 --> 02:36:10.060]
and for Lord of the other guy from a blind melon.

[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:11.620]
Shannin.

[02:36:12.060 --> 02:36:12.420]
Who?

[02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.480]
Shannon Hoon, who I hate.

[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:16.000]
Glad he's dead.

[02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:16.740]
Why?

[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:18.240]
You don't like blind melon?

[02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:19.280]
No, I like blind melon.

[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:19.820]
I hate him.

[02:36:20.140 --> 02:36:20.360]
Why?

[02:36:20.800 --> 02:36:21.640]
He peed on the audience.

[02:36:22.660 --> 02:36:23.300]
He peed on it?

[02:36:23.700 --> 02:36:24.020]
Literally.

[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:26.020]
Well, Jim Morrison never got that far.

[02:36:26.220 --> 02:36:26.360]
No.

[02:36:26.720 --> 02:36:28.260]
He whipped it out, but he never got to peon.

[02:36:28.720 --> 02:36:30.200]
He actually never did whip it out by one.

[02:36:30.460 --> 02:36:30.680]
I know.

[02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:31.520]
It was just so dumb.

[02:36:31.780 --> 02:36:32.620]
Don't blame America.

[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:33.680]
We didn't vote for Bush.

[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:34.720]
He says, have a nice weekend.

[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:35.480]
Thank you, Jane.

[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:36.460]
And she's got something else there.

[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:37.760]
I wish I can't read Murdoch.

[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:39.960]
He does own Sky TV.

[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:40.380]
Anyway.

[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:41.400]
Oh, here.

[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:42.420]
Oh, you know what this all is?

[02:36:42.480 --> 02:36:43.560]
This isn't stuff you send me.

[02:36:44.300 --> 02:36:46.100]
This is kind of like a delayed reaction.

[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:47.360]
See my fax machine.

[02:36:47.380 --> 02:36:49.320]
I've got a program so that anything that has to do with

[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:51.680]
Rupert Murdoch, it screens it out before it comes off the machine.

[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:54.280]
So now I have two copies of the Dixie-Tix store.

[02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:55.060]
And there's still a live.

[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:55.800]
There's still a live.

[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:28.600]
He's the King of the World.

[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:31.600]

Here's coconut greek, a creek.

[02:44:20.180 --> 02:44:20.320]
Hello.

[02:44:21.840 --> 02:44:22.340]
Neil.

[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:23.160]
Yes, sir.

[02:44:23.340 --> 02:44:25.940]
How about Jean Acher, root off the Red Nose reindeer?

[02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:26.660]
Right.

[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:29.440]
Go Dixie chicks.

[02:44:30.660 --> 02:44:31.780]
Go Dixie chicks.

[02:44:32.320 --> 02:44:36.280]
Jean Acher mentioned him just a couple of weeks ago that on the movieola channel here that

[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:39.580]
shows those cereals, those old time movie cereals.

[02:44:39.720 --> 02:44:44.140]
The G.O.T. was the only cowboy who all would have had like a science fiction thing in his

[02:44:44.140 --> 02:44:44.600]
life.

[02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:47.120]
He was singing at the, what's the name of that ranch?

[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:48.780]
Oh, you wouldn't know.

[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:49.460]
Do does.

[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:50.560]
Yeah, do does.

[02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:51.220]
The most thing that I had.

[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:53.200]
How seriously did they have the name of whatever his ranch was?

[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:53.620]
Hidden Valley.

[02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:53.800]
Hitting Valley.

[02:44:54.140 --> 02:44:56.640]
And dressing, I love it.

[02:44:57.180 --> 02:45:01.920]
And they had all these strange people from outer space underneath the ranch out there.

[02:45:02.120 --> 02:45:06.120]
And Jean always just came back just in time to grab the microphone and prune one of them

[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:07.980]
in Cornia, a country in western songs, it was hot.

[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:09.160]
A he would go Eddie Arnold.

[02:45:10.220 --> 02:45:10.640]
A burger pardon?

[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:12.260]
Jean Acher was no Eddie Arnold.

[02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:13.760]
Thank God.

[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:15.400]
Well, you liked Eddie Arnold?

[02:45:15.580 --> 02:45:16.680]
Yeah, Jean couldn't yodel.

[02:45:17.400 --> 02:45:18.000]
Oh, good.

[02:45:18.180 --> 02:45:19.060]
Like I said, thank the Lord.

[02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:22.820]
France and Germany want U.S. to give power to Iraqis quickly.

[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:23.620]
They're there at the UN.

[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:26.600]
And we're saying, please, please, please help us out.

[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:27.920]
We don't think so.

[02:45:28.160 --> 02:45:28.880]
Not so fast.

[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:30.120]
Big shot.

[02:45:32.260 --> 02:45:36.140]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line.

[02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:40.820]
Don't forget to go to NealWriter's.com and help us out with our abandoned pet rescue fundraiser this year.

[02:45:41.100 --> 02:45:43.300]
Best of the eels on air, 2002, 2003.

[02:45:43.800 --> 02:45:44.420]
A lot of good stuff.

[02:45:45.080 --> 02:45:46.680]
You got your Mohawaii David of Keychains.

[02:45:46.740 --> 02:45:47.080]
Absolutely.

[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:49.100]
She's going over like Halavoth, the North Pole.

[02:45:50.940 --> 02:45:51.680]
Here's Palm Beach.

[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:52.000]
Hello.

[02:45:53.460 --> 02:45:53.820]
Hello.

[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:54.680]
Yes, sir.

[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:55.580]
Hi, Neal.

[02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:56.120]
How you doing?

[02:45:56.420 --> 02:45:56.600]
Great.

[02:45:56.600 --> 02:45:57.680]
Good, and I'd like to...

[02:45:57.680 --> 02:46:00.000]
Did you have Henry Mancini on your list?

[02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.620]
Henry Mancini is good.

[02:46:01.760 --> 02:46:02.860]
He had a lot of big hits.

[02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.560]
Yes, the pink pass, and was the biggest one he ever did.

[02:46:05.660 --> 02:46:05.900]
Right.

[02:46:06.500 --> 02:46:06.860]
Okay.

[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:08.960]
I'm going to go to the TV show too.

[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:09.660]
Right.

[02:46:10.220 --> 02:46:10.560]
You buy?

[02:46:10.700 --> 02:46:10.860]
Okay.

[02:46:11.480 --> 02:46:12.040]
Thanks, Pelle.

[02:46:12.740 --> 02:46:13.680]
No, not me, buy.

[02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:14.160]
Me again.

[02:46:16.340 --> 02:46:16.700]
Tonto.

[02:46:17.680 --> 02:46:18.400]
Henry Mancini.

[02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:20.380]
Now you laugh when I sit here a lot of big hits.

[02:46:20.380 --> 02:46:20.880]
He did.

[02:46:21.080 --> 02:46:23.100]
There were a lot of it back in the days when he was in the middle of the rig.

[02:46:24.220 --> 02:46:24.940]
Moon River.

[02:46:24.940 --> 02:46:25.360]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:26.440 --> 02:46:27.480]
How about Andy Williams?

[02:46:27.480 --> 02:46:29.940]
He's not dead, but boy, he's got to be getting close.

[02:46:32.660 --> 02:46:35.040]
Every once in a few years, they try to Andy out.

[02:46:36.820 --> 02:46:37.620]
Really depressing.

[02:46:37.780 --> 02:46:38.160]
They can breath.

[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:40.400]
I want to say this sounds insensitive, but it's true.

[02:46:41.180 --> 02:46:43.080]
Because I hadn't seen John Ritter in a long time.

[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:45.420]
Because I don't watch these sitcoms and any of that stuff.

[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:48.620]
And for 54, he looked really bad, I thought.

[02:46:48.720 --> 02:46:52.960]
Did you see him on there when they were showed the clips from the taping of the episode?

[02:46:53.240 --> 02:46:54.080]
No, he didn't look good.

[02:46:54.080 --> 02:46:55.320]
Now he looked bad.

[02:46:57.580 --> 02:46:59.140]
But he did a good job in sling blade.

[02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:02.800]
So when you see that, he played a gay guy, surprised.

[02:47:03.780 --> 02:47:04.200]
John Ritter?

[02:47:04.340 --> 02:47:05.060]
Yeah, I always thought.

[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:07.020]
I hate to say that right after he did.

[02:47:07.220 --> 02:47:07.940]
I always, he did.

[02:47:08.140 --> 02:47:08.200]
Err.

[02:47:08.380 --> 02:47:10.340]
Him and Henry Winkler were extraordinarily tight.

[02:47:10.520 --> 02:47:11.920]
Henry Winkler was positive.

[02:47:12.640 --> 02:47:14.660]
You ever notice how much makeup he had in the happy days?

[02:47:14.940 --> 02:47:16.120]
They had cake on there.

[02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:17.940]
Because he was only 40 when that show was being filmed.

[02:47:18.540 --> 02:47:18.680]
Yeah.

[02:47:19.220 --> 02:47:20.120]
And how many years ago was that?

[02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:21.080]
About 30, man.

[02:47:21.860 --> 02:47:23.800]
Well, they're dropping like flies.

[02:47:24.060 --> 02:47:29.180]
So even though Zolly or Azoli or whatever that guy's name was a little upset, that's the way it goes.

[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:31.180]
You know, it's just a fact of life and death.

[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:33.880]
Death, taxes and most hair piece.

[02:47:34.020 --> 02:47:35.420]
That's the only three things you can count on.

[02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:36.880]
That is, as certain as can be.

[02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:39.800]
It's not even raining here, I don't think.

[02:47:40.660 --> 02:47:45.000]
Just to report everybody, it's worried about me getting stuck in the middle of hurricane the aftermath of Isabel.

[02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:47.860]
No, that's the one thing.

[02:47:48.920 --> 02:47:52.860]
18, it's 65 degrees, 18 degrees Celsius.

[02:47:53.440 --> 02:47:54.400]
We got a wind warning.

[02:47:54.780 --> 02:47:55.560]
Wow, they're wind warning.

[02:47:55.660 --> 02:47:58.920]
It's like 30 kilometers, which is like 18 miles an hour.

[02:47:59.140 --> 02:47:59.920]
There ain't no big deal.

[02:48:00.340 --> 02:48:02.420]
Just a little wind and we had some heavy rain earlier.

[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:04.120]
And now it's just like peeing every once in a while.

[02:48:04.480 --> 02:48:06.040]
People are going around their ordinary business.

[02:48:08.220 --> 02:48:09.400]
National post front page.

[02:48:09.460 --> 02:48:11.520]
I should have, I don't know how I could have done that.

[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:14.320]
Oh, it's speaking of our website.

[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:17.420]
Very important, see how I fall into a bucket of crap every once in a while.

[02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:18.540]
I didn't realize they were on there.

[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:19.140]
Have you seen them?

[02:48:19.340 --> 02:48:20.120]
Oh, yeah, I thought you knew.

[02:48:20.380 --> 02:48:21.500]
And I did not know.

[02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:22.560]
Nice going, Eric.

[02:48:23.500 --> 02:48:26.040]
On our website, now is the one with you on there.

[02:48:26.140 --> 02:48:26.680]
Just one with me.

[02:48:26.780 --> 02:48:27.540]
Yeah, you're on there too.

[02:48:28.300 --> 02:48:29.940]
Oh, and I didn't even see that word.

[02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:31.320]
George W is singing highly in there.

[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:32.140]
I didn't see that one.

[02:48:32.620 --> 02:48:34.640]
I never saw that before because he told me about it.

[02:48:34.660 --> 02:48:36.120]
He's doing the old Adolf Hitler's Seagull.

[02:48:36.440 --> 02:48:37.020]
All right.

[02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:42.140]
My, oh, my, have we got some heavy-duty stuff for you to check out over the weekend?

[02:48:42.140 --> 02:48:45.020]
You understand the stuff of his track of everyone.

[02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.000]
You understand now?

[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:46.300]
Yeah.

[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:47.380]
Kyle Bush.

[02:48:48.020 --> 02:48:49.980]
And there's George, a little us-based out there.

[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:51.740]
Just a little bit on the Stone Age.

[02:48:51.740 --> 02:48:52.540]
A natural state.

[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:54.260]
And then there's me.

[02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:57.420]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[02:48:57.640 --> 02:49:00.340]
And then we added a little something to the most brain there is thinking,

[02:49:00.340 --> 02:49:02.000]
it sure beats getting raped at it.

[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:02.600]
I like that.

[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:04.320]
Most brain.

[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:07.660]
One of the most delicate operations I've had to perform in years.

[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:10.760]
Next, I'm going to work on seeing if I can find one in Greg's head, but I doubt it.

[02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:14.020]
19 till 2 at 5.60 WQM.

[02:49:14.120 --> 02:49:17.140]
It's that time of the year again when the mattress, storms and furniture stores run those

[02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:18.580]
phony, baloney, ad sales.

[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:20.500]
You can almost smell the baloneya.

[02:49:20.880 --> 02:49:23.240]
Dalmaters ask you to double the price and then offer half off.

[02:49:23.300 --> 02:49:24.180]
What kind of a sale is that?

[02:49:24.320 --> 02:49:24.840]
That's no deal.

[02:49:25.160 --> 02:49:28.180]
The fact is these stores have to run some kind of wild sale that drop their prices

[02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:29.300]
even nearly as low.

[02:49:29.760 --> 02:49:32.900]
And Dalmaters offers to you every day 365 days a year.

[02:49:33.300 --> 02:49:36.840]
For discount prices on dozens and dozens of top models from

[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:39.920]
Sealy, surred at tempered, eximment King Coral or Sterns and Foster.

[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:42.600]
Here's the number to call toll free 1-800-Matras.

[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:43.060]
That's it.

[02:49:43.440 --> 02:49:47.920]
No nonsense, no bait and swish, no house brands, no phony promises and best of all,

[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:50.860]

You want them there between 10 and noon in the morning?

[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:07.820]
They'll be there.

[02:50:08.200 --> 02:50:10.000]
Like noon and two, one and three, etc.

[02:50:10.660 --> 02:50:11.760]
145 to 345.

[02:50:12.300 --> 02:50:15.960]
I've been sitting on a mattress and Dalmaters for a long time and your back will thank you.

[02:50:16.060 --> 02:50:17.280]
That's right, your back will actually speak.

[02:50:17.300 --> 02:50:19.660]
It'll say thank you for finally whizing up.

[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:23.000]
With low prices, same day delivery fee setup and roval, it's easy to see.
