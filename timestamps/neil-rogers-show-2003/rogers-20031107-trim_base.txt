[00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:11.200]
Eight ten basketball women's not awful. What do anybody ever watch the trashers TV telecast your puke your guts up?

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.220]
Who is he? I've never heard of this guy. JP telecamera. Oh, man. Darren Elliott Darren Elliott is a former player and

[00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.500]
He's a great guy and I think he sucks too. Ladies and great guy. He was he was absolutely the worst

[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.400]
And you know I could have done better on TV in Atlanta drunk. Yeah, then they could they were so boring

[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.880]
They were said that's why they got rid of me because I told him like it wasn't he I said I went nuts on the air as you know

[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.980]
Yeah, and these here's the here's the here's the here's the here's the where there was Darren Elliott calling again

[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.480]
You said they were taking it up the ass and it's a good thing Ken was playing

[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.660]
They were losing nine nothing to the doubles one night. I said we were taking it in the ass and

[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.040]
Darren Elliott said at the end when you said that no

[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:56.260]
It wasn't that was one peg in the in the board, but here's what Darren Elliott said here's Darren Elliott on the same night

[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.800]
Here's what he his analysis of the same game he went

[00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.220]
That trashers are really poor checking good in this one, but we're down nine, but we're really hitting a lot of walls

[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.360]
You know he was one of these guys like Howard David

[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:13.020]
He's like one of these guys like Howard David that spends the entire day shoving D down his throat

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.240]
Because he's working on the take for the team and he would never want to say here's me

[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.460]
We haven't wanted a month Christ bring me a martini

[00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:26.480]
You know why he was non-Monday Moe because they had an extra kid they had to bring in a forklift

[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.160]
Extriger's tongue from J. Feet lose

Your buddy I'm not allowed to say his name, but he sends every day of his life

[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:57.580]
He sends an email to J. Feetlers agent saying that

[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.200]
That a feedler shouldn't ever do interviews on this station

[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:07.600]

Ashmitato yeast

[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.280]

[00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.340]
Laffer the children as voice and tasty

[00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.540]
It's 11 after 10 we can't stand that bitch on his show

With a little tongue than ever see Rosie again. I'm sure it's I can't stand that bike

[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.460]
Here's a fact you get us started from Mike who says who asks

[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.380]
Is that LA Times article you read on the US that they posted your website yet

[00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:18.040]
Who was the columnist the comments was Robert sheer who was one of the best comments in America and I've read many of his columns on here over the years right over the last two three years

[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:26.200]
Yep Robert sheer over the years it's got to be on there ain't it didn't you send it yeah I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure

[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:27.180]
I'm pretty sure

[00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:29.400]
Anyway it's on there so just look for okay we'll find it

[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.680]
1194 votes we got seven more American soldiers dead in Iraq

[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:38.660]
But who's counting but who's counting is right it's just and nobody cares anymore that's the problem

[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:45.580]
It's like oh we can't even be bothered reporting that because Rosie's lawsuits getting really tense now and she's making a lot of comments out there

[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:51.780]
In front of the courthouse and the Lacey Peterson and Scott Peterson things getting really heated up again and then we got the sniper trials

[00:11:51.780 --> 00:12:00.920]
Flashclad police officers demonstrated how a sniper could see we got that all whipped up again now with John Mohamed and Lee Melvo Schwartz all of that stuff going

[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.060]
So who the hell is that time for a few more dead American troops you know

[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:10.160]
It's really tragic man it's really very sad and when you especially those of us who live through the whole thing in Vietnam the first time

[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:16.180]
And 58,000 American kids came home in body bags and now it's adding up you know first it was like one a day and two a day

[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:21.640]
And then of course we had 16 which turned out to be 19 and now we got seven overnight now it's like in clumps and bunches

[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.460]
And the numbers starting to add up real real fast like over 400

[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.480]
But nobody cares that's the best part of the whole deal is except for those people that like directly involved or like

It's not fact in the church this whole thing is one big mess just go ahead and start from the beginning

[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:15.320]
Father well the month senior here calls me and says that I should set aside an afternoon and molest the kids some time

[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:29.280]
He said they needed to learn more about breeding I see is that what happened no way I said he should set aside some time to invest in the kids reading reading not breeding sounds like another miscommunication because of cellular static you should have been using

[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:40.720]
Sprint Sprint PCS is the all-digital crystal clear cellular network sprint could have avoided something like this well I do like to look on the bright side how's that if I've been on the sprint network I would have never discovered but

[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:47.540]
Good because you'll need them where you're going 4000 minutes for 39 99 from sprint PCS

[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.900]
1018 at 560 W.D.Q. I'm happy Friday to you now

[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.820]
Why did you affect me this great pool from Sean and Hollywood again for the second day in roses because if you don't

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.880]
It's what on the air he'll just keep fixing it every day

[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:02.360]
Well, I got it and it's a great pool and I'll get to it one of these days very soon not today

[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:07.380]
It's a wonderful pool. It's very long and complicated and I like it a lot and Sean I thank you for all your great

[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:13.020]
Facts as you one of our best factors, but don't get pushy Sean. You know what I'm saying? We don't like pushy on this show

[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:16.020]
I already got it in my pile of poles and my pool pile

[00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:22.300]
No, I do I got a pile of poles here for future reference and that's what I've been here is it's a good one

[00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:28.660]
But they look at around when I'm good and ready so back off a little bit Sean. Okay. Just back off ease back a couple of yards from the radio and

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:33.920]
I see so it says on your mirror is questionable for tonight Scott what show you're saying he's gonna play probably

[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:40.440]
No, that's what Scott said. Oh, I don't think I know what the hell does he know he's too busy going to jail now

[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.160]
Love 194 votes who is in fact?

[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:48.200]
It'll be great. Maybe I have those straight the straight suit on there when he shows up at Napa Auto Parts

[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.280]
That'd be a different spin on it

[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.680]
Don't forget noon today Scott Farrell is gonna be a Napa Auto Parts

[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.640]

[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:06.260]

And when T-shirts and tickets tonight's Panthers game against the penguins which Merrill looks like it's gonna play

[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.260]
I forgot to tell for all to say hi to my client tonight. They penguin panther game

[00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:23.380]
Scott I'm sure he will what oh did you ever get the tickets tonight's game or not no John didn't call me back. Oh good

[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.720]
Yeah, follows instructions well, I didn't tell him that it just they maybe don't care

[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.340]
Maybe as it figures you getting a little bit too pushy Scott's gonna get him out of the front step

[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.660]
What is it he's gonna go camp out on the front step there? Yeah, sure he won't be there

[00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:42.040]
Yeah, 1194 votes on yesterday's pool who is or was the biggest Julie Yahoo of them all and if you want to see him

[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.900]
Not nice. I'm actually drooling on there, but if anybody missed it yesterday on earroges.com you must

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.200]
You absolutely must it'll be probably the highlight of your weekend

[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:57.500]
Go to your roger's dot com and click on where it's a shows George W's push there and WMD countdown weapons of mass destruction

[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.300]
That's one of the all-time best in fact that could be like a hobby

[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.820]
You could just sit there and watch that for hours

[00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:07.780]
I wanted on a plasma all I hear and he he's keen to precious on passions make no man

[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:12.720]
He's part of the family they're in the same family tree and he's like moving his head side to side and pressing his lips and

[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.260]
Just doing a bunch of amazing things and you can actually watch the second

[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.640]
Continued to count away on a weapon of mass destruction

[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.500]
Search countdown to beautiful thing anyway

[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:28.100]
That's a hint for the winner of our poor yesterday hands down the biggest Julie Yahoo of them all George W

[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:35.340]
Bush 429 votes a 436% of this crowd say he's a Julie Yahoo and that's one of the best things we can say about him

[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.840]
A dead ass tie look at that well it has changed since then, but who cares?

[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:44.860]
Jesse Hemson strong thermon when I printed this out had 135 apiece and I think that's

[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:46.240]
appropriate, don't you?

[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:52.560]
Dr. Phil a very respectable fourth place 88 votes

[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:58.060]
Terry Bowden oh, I'm so proud of this audience. Terry Bowden 42 must have got some of the sports nerds

[00:17:59.020 --> 00:17:59.920]
Casting their votes

[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:05.000]
Terry Bowden who definitely was not born the conventional way. He crawled out from under a rock somewhere

[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.980]
Steve Spurrier 39 Toby key 34 James Carville's god

[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:17.280]
Jimmy Swagger 29 John rocker old John rocker and Billy Carter tied 26 apiece both from Joja or at least they both

[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.920]
Dittled around in Joja

[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:21.200]
Most used to pee all over the place in Joja

[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.860]
Terry branch on Ross per O 22 apiece judge Roy Moore 20

[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.100]
Don I miss 18 trend lock 15 Tammy Fei in Newt, Gingrich 11 apiece

[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.120]

[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.480]

Robert bird and Orville Fava seven apiece earnest angelie five

[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:44.560]
Junior samples woman else in jury Jones had three apiece out of about 1200 votes on yesterday's poll

[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.260]
Drulling Yahoo's and L president. They led the way by a million miles by not even a contest

[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:57.380]
Here's the bad news US military officials say US Army black hawk helicopter crashed today near to Crete the North Central Iraqi city

[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:01.280]
Which is both the hometown of Sodom who's saying and the place where he's been suspected of hiding out

[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.820]
Six soldiers killed in the helicopter and now it says the accident, but there was no accident. It was a um

[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.880]
It was an accident, but somebody got hurt. Oh is that it?

[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.160]
Unlike the godfather was an accident nobody got hurt

[00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.620]
Which is the third for US troops in less than two weeks all of the dead from the 101st Airborne

[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.140]
Uh, it was in our PG a rocket propeller grenade. There's a little question about that

[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:26.000]
Uh, helicopter went down about 9.40 a.m. of bagged that time on a river back along with tag-risk river

[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.200]
And also there was another American soldier killed uh in an araca attack on near the Mosul hotel

[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.760]
Two others injured

[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.840]
So the numbers just keep going up and up and up and of course one has to wonder

[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.160]
What is it that we're doing there and why are these people dying and what is this all about and when the hell is it ever

[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.680]
And then how much more money are we're gonna keep pumping in there and what kind of bull crap and where the hell are the American people and where's the democratic party

[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:49.820]
Where's the real outrage and where's the psychosis and where's the uh, you know

[00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:54.660]
Didn't they just rubber stamp the eighty seven billion dollar gift yes, not loan gift and they just get through doing that

[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:59.440]
So maybe some of the candidates occasionally muster a little bit of a ball. Maybe one like drops

[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.640]
Drop there. It is that's the one

[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.980]
briefly, but that's about it

[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.320]
And former prisoner war Jessica Lynn says there was no reason for her rescue from an arachia hospital last April to have been filmed

[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.780]
This is while she's peddling her book in an interview for ABC's prime time the 20-year-old

[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:21.520]
former army supply clerks says the US military used her capture and rescue to boost public support for the war

[00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:25.300]
They used me as a way to symbolize all this stuff said lynch and it's wrong

[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.540]
She's doing a series of videos to build her book. I am a soldier too and

[00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:35.020]
An extra printed in New York David news revealed that medical evidence suggests she was raped while held prisoner

[00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:40.320]
Which we totally yesterday, but she says it's all a bunch of crap. Why the hell movie? They're using me to try to like

[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.800]
Goose up in other words. They're lying through their teeth

[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:49.240]
So there she is telling you that any of the the apologists are gonna go like that

[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.360]
Now what what is this thing that you just fact me don't mention the derivative I think the article I guess

[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.400]
An article of what clothing

[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.760]
I don't I don't have time to dittle with that anyway

[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.580]
Here's the first poll we're taking today and where was that the facts I had yesterday

[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.720]
About can anybody here it is

[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.700]
Pretty out of the show you sent me this I can't believe says some facts are anonymous

[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.120]
I can't believe that anyone is seriously talking about Hillary Clinton running for president

[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.920]
And this is when I read that little bird about how she's a if she throws her hat in a ring or her

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.940]
Berser in the out on the floor. Yeah, that she beats the other democratic contenders hands down

[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.980]
She got like what was it 43% some ridiculous total crazy

[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:39.040]
Anyway, the fact she says does anybody with a brain thing she's gonna stand a chance against the republican slime machine

[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:44.040]
They're the ones who wanted to run. She's too polarizing like Madonna people lover or hate her

[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:50.040]
Besides I think Hillary's very happy with a position of president prone where she can distretely wield her power

[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.260]
Influence the relative anonymity of the senate. Who's this guy kidding? Huh?

[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:58.720]
All of this talk about Hillary running at her connection with Clark is from the GOP propaganda machine

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:05.140]
They're peeing their pants over Clark because he exposes number two for what he is a spoiled coward who likes to play dress up

[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.860]
Whatever that means

[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.800]
You understand what that mean. No, I don't um they're peeing under pants over Wesley Clark

[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:19.560]
Well, if that's the case they must be the only ones doing it because he just didn't seem to have generated this tremendous amount of enthusiasm

[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:24.820]
At the deli den and at the rascal house, right? He was offering free pickles and coleslaw

[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:28.620]
They enjoyed that the eight k's see what he doesn't understand the democrats are gonna get all their votes

[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.720]
Anyways, it's kind of like preaching to the choir

[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:37.240]
To be hanging out at the deli den. Maybe who is just polishing his bill crap you think maybe

[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.480]
Uh, he leaves me limp, you know in the beginning

[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.100]
I was a little bit excited because you know that whole thing about the ex general and all of this and he looks pretty good

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.800]
And he's articulate fairly but there's nothing there. There's no substance

[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:53.300]
Right and he is uh, he ain't got nothing going there, but at any rate 20 soon. We'll see

[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.800]
So here's the poll we're taking the first poll if Hillary Clinton ran for president which democrat would you prefer?

[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:04.440]

Under your there soon to see a film called the human stain

[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.300]
And if she lived in Michigan she lived in portage, I think it's uh look at that the pull is up and so far

[00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.740]
Hillary and Howard Dean got three of peace just the early returns. There's a smattering of vote on there

[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.160]
But it's up you can bang on it

[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.600]
Here's the facts. I can't read that at the bottom from bill and what what does that say bill and

[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:33.300]
Yeah, Bill and so urban beach they says ormon pizza could be it I can't read it

[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.840]
Work on your handwriting girl. He's crawled it fast. He wasn't hurry

[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:41.700]
He says the best way them all yesterday in New York times marine down piece. Please read it. Okay. I'm easy. All right

[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.120]
Our second poll by the way is going to be a movie poll and I was inspired on that uh by a thing

[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.180]
What do I do with my thing? I don't want to get another great thing too about bush

[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.200]
And we had this on a few days ago, but I got to read it's not long

[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.960]
Bush no longer been controlled as Chinese hawks hijack foreign policy

[00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.440]
Important moly or important. I know you're very excited about it

[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.460]
See I do people are waiting for the big WT

[00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.940]
So you can all bail out of Dave County and head for Broward

[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:10.220]
Then good thing. I'm not gonna be there. Wow

[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:16.480]
Forever flicks. What's your favorite hangout movie is a thing that ABC news is doing this was good morning America

[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.820]
In other words, the movie you could watch a million times and never get tired of it

[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:25.880]
So what the pull I'm gonna take later on is a little spin off on it and we've done we never did this exact poll

[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:29.880]
Love you only had one tape or DVD movie that you could watch over and over again

[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.000]
What would it be now? Of course that

[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.980]
Now we'll get a little bit ponderous, but nevertheless right right you're gonna be on the Nileland pick your stranded on a desert island

[00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:39.820]
There was only one DVD and you had like a

[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:45.160]
I don't know where you get your power to watch it, but just assuming you know it says for fun when we'll get right down right's death that be loud

[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.480]
In yesterday's New York times who can blame poor president Bush look at his terrible dilemma

[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:56.300]
There are those who say the chief executive should have come out of his Texas ranch house and articulated and then asswashed the

[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.300]
Sorrow and outrage and anxiety the nation was feeling on Sunday after the deadliest day in Iraq in seven months

[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.700]
An attack on a Chinook helicopter to kill 15 Americans soldiers 13 men and two women and wounded 21

[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:14.220]
There are those who say mr. Bush had emulated Rudy Giuliani's empathetic leadership after 9-11 or dads in the first Gulf war

[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:18.460]
And attended some of the funerals of the 379 Americans killed in Iraq or one

[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:26.520]
Maybe the one for specialist Gerald Dent the 21-year-old National Guard officer from Washington who died outside Baghdad late August when a bomb struck his truck

[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.380]
While he was delivering mail to his troops

[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.920]
His funeral was how the debat is church three miles from the White House

[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.560]
But let's look at it from the president's point of view if he grieves more publicly or concretely

[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.000]
If he addresses every instance of bad news like the hideous specter of Iraq

[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.200]
He's celebrating the downing of the Chinook he'll simply remind people of what's really going on in Iraq

[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.700]
So it's understandable why going into his reelection campaign mr. Bush wouldn't want to underscore that young Americans keep getting whacked over there

[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:53.120]
And we don't know who's doing it or how to stop it

[00:27:53.760 --> 00:28:00.240]
The White House is cleverly trying to distance mr. Bush from the messy problem of flesh and blood soldiers with real names dying nearly every day

[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.520]
While linking him to the heroic task of fighting global terror

[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.260]
It's better to keep it vague to talk about the important cause and the brave defenders of liberty

[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:13.100]
If he gets more explicit or allows the flag-rape coffins of fallen heroes to be photographed coming home

[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:17.920]
It'll just remind people that the administration said this will be easy and it's teeth grindingly hard

[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:22.580]
And that the administration vowed to get Osama and sob the Sodom and WMD in hezant

[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:27.080]
And that the Bush team that had presence of al-Qaeda in Iraq has now created an al-Qaeda presence in Iraq

[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:34.880]
And that there was no decent plan for the occupation or for financing one no plan for rotating or supporting troops threats too thin to guard ammunition caches or

[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.660]
Police of fractured society and no plan for getting out

[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:44.500]
As the White House points out mr. Bush cannot fairly pick and choose which memorial services to go to or which deaths to speak of

[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:48.400]
If a helicopter were hit an hour later after he came out in the spoke shoot he come out again

[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:54.880]
Then Bartlett the White House communications director told the time's Elizabeth Bumiller explaining mr. Bush's silence after the chino crash

[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.500]
The public he had had wants the commander in chief to have proper perspective and keep his eye on the big picture and the ball

[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.420]
The ball for fall is fundraising

[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:08.180]
President Bush has been going full throttle since summer spending several days week flying around the country

[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.740]
Hitting our virtual publicans for $2,000 checks

[00:29:10.740 --> 00:29:17.160]
He's raised $90 million so far out of 175 any plants to spend on a primary campaign in which he has no opponent

[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:22.420]
At fundraisers mr. Bush prefers to talk about the uptick in the economy not the downtick in Iraq

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:26.460]
On Monday arriving for a fundraiser in Birmingham. He was upbeat not somber

[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.680]
As Mike Allen the Washington Post reported in his pool report

[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.660]
The president who gave his usual salute as he stepped off remain one appeared to start today in a fabulous mood

[00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:41.320]
An Alabama reporter who was under the wing shouted how long will you as troops be in Iraq the president gave him an unappreciative look

[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:47.900]
Raising 1.8 million dollars at lunch. He stuck the line that we are aggressively striking the terrorist in Iraq defeating them there

[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.860]
So will not have to face them in our own country

[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:55.860]
He didn't want to depress the donors by mentioning the big news story the loss of 15 American soldiers or sour the mood by

[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:00.960]
Conceiting the obvious that the swelling hoard of terrorists fighting us there will not prevent terrorists from coming after us here

[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.460]
Maybe we should all be like president Bush and not read the papers so we don't get worn down either

[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:12.780]
Perhaps the solution to mr. Bush's quant co-quandries to coordinate his schedule so we can go to cities where he can attend both fundraisers and funnels

[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.480]
The law of averages suggested shouldn't be hard

[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.260]
That's marine doubt that's not be lobbyist. Please New York times it's honorable

[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.880]
How's that pull come on Howard Dean Hillary look at that neck and neck nose to nose wow I pulled you

[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:32.620]
I'm gonna get that facts. I can't believe that anybody seriously. Well, I'm not I didn't vote for her, but I'm just talking there she is

[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.720]
I don't call or Dean 14 Hillary Clinton 13 old number 13 Danny boy

[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.940]
Wesley Clark six. I don't give her crap five. I don't care. I'm from Bush three

[00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.380]
John Kerry two Jew Lieberman one that is Cassinich one

[00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:53.340]
None yet zero for Al Sharpen. Caram mostly bronze on Edwards and Dick hip-hardt over the first 45 vote on our survey

[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.060]
Here's a call from Miramar. Hello

[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:03.380]
Yeah, I know man pretty good sir. Hey listen. I pick out my foot over that bush my spare. I'll tell you what I do

[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.060]
Um, I was gonna ask you the 101st airborne when they initially went to die right

[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:14.140]
Were they the initial soldiers to get in there and fight? I think

[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.160]
Yeah, how many since uh, how many of those guys have died since

[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.300]
The Bushmasters said a lot at the end of the road a lot

[00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:23.500]
Yeah, it's sad, man

[00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:28.960]
Anyway, thanks now okay, and you know, and uh, you know, we consider talking about it

[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:35.480]
But there there's no and now what we're doing is send at 85,000 more troops than 100,000 replacement troops with Marines next year and all this other crap

[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.240]
Well, when is it ever end?

[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:42.300]
This is just like Vietnam when people said that in the beginning of the night. That's that's a little over the top

[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:46.280]
Even I'm not gonna go along with that, but it's like the same crap all over again just low

[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.220]
In fact in Vietnam first we sent advisors right

[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.760]
So-called advisors, you know, right

[00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:56.620]
And then all of a sudden advisors became a few troops then became a lot of troops

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.000]
Then it became enormous numbers of troops and it was so similar because

[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:06.580]
Uh, a lot of us kept asking what are we doing there? Why are we there? What are we fighting for who are we fighting?

[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.360]
We can't tell who the enemy is which I'm reading that every day now about Iraq

[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.820]
We can't really tell who the enemy is and what is it all about? What's the end game?

[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:17.800]
What's the plan? What's the point? Where's the beef? You know, and there are no answers to these questions

[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.160]
Which is why he always keeps coming back to that bull crap about this is what we have to do to fight terrorism

[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.460]
Iraq had nothing to do with terrorism in fact

[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:28.640]
There's a lot more terrorism going on now now there than there ever was before ever

[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:36.160]
So all we did and I remember those ads which everybody conveniently forgets with their CA their convenient Alzheimer's

[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.320]
Remember the ads are like right after 9-11

[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.920]
That some people in New York times and Washington post and there was a picture of Osama saying come on now

[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:50.400]
Georgie go into Iraq and whip up all the terrorists in all of them takes all of and now he's rubbing his hands together

[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:53.040]
Wherever he is on his dialysis machine whack the hornet's best

[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:58.240]
That's right. They whack the hornet's nest and they stir it up all the loom things who are coming into Iraq from a Syria and everywhere

[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.400]
They can every direction

[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.240]
East West North and South and

[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.540]
It's a nightmare. It's a quagmire

[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:11.140]
And there is no exit strategy. There's no concept. It's obvious right and when you and when you get to that thing

[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.220]
Which I'm I am going to read it

[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:18.940]
About Bush no longer in control as Chinese hawks hijack foreign policy when you realize that it's a small handful of lunatics

[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:24.140]
Who run in a country now call wolf wits and Richard purle and all these other grave robbers and the cheney and it bushes

[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.600]
Just a face man, which is pretty scary to begin with with that alfredi Newman look

[00:33:28.360 --> 00:33:30.880]
Uh, and the public is sitting back and buying into this

[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.720]
Well, what are you thinking about?

[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.800]
The media is American public thinking about

[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:43.020]
It's one thing to die for your country but to die for nothing to be a human sacrifice. How can anybody support that

[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:49.120]
Howardine 25 Hillary 23 we got a battle. I told you it's like uh aledare and affirmed

[00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:53.060]
Wesley Clark 9 don't care. I'm from Bush 7. Don't give her crap 7

Al Sharpton 4 John Kerry 2 Dennis Cassinan disappear dick hip-harts 1 julie marines got one

[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.920]

Q a n

[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:22.760]
You

[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:33.240]
Chuck it or did he cock it? I just don't think we can afford to improve education and provide health care and protect the environment all of the things that I campaigned on

[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:41.540]
I am in tandem on being the best young man that I can be it's a little confusing isn't it my husband will be going on

[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.840]
I know to do other people

[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:50.260]
Thousands and thousands of people across New York and lots of friends around the country. I certainly intend to overlook that

[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:55.540]
1045 and we should have two he should still be in there. Let's put him back in and start all over again

[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.000]
What are you saying all right? Let's dig bubble back in here. Let's do away. You know they're trying to do away with this thing about

[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.440]
You know American born native born of being present so they can try to run Arnold in 88

[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.800]
I'm sure that or to whatever to you in 1988

[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.760]
In 2008 and wouldn't that be something so we can put like a son of a Nazi in there son of a bitch

[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:17.700]
But I say we if we can repeal that let's have a constitutional moment to make the president loud

[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:19.940]
Like at least three four five terms sure

[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.940]
Imagine all the of blue dresses. I'm good for the dry cleaning business

[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.820]
If Hillary Clinton ran for president which Democrat would you prefer Howard Dean 32 Hillary Clinton's God

[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.720]
30 she's right on Howard's ass

[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:37.760]
And of course at this point the way things have been going for her last year. She's probably hop on anybody's ass

[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:43.000]
I hear she's got a look at that. Let's say it again. Howard Dean 34 Hillary 31 just changed again

[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.140]
Wesley card 14 don't give her crap nine don't care. I'm for Bush 8

[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.100]
One click question. Where did you read that that show that you played over the air? Where was that from?

[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:09.780]
CBC

[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:13.080]
Is there any way I can get a transcript like on the internet?

[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.740]
Yes, CBC dot C.A. slash fifth fifth estate FIFT H

[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:23.600]
Okay, and read the lines of George that he was by David Corn a great book. Okay. I got in the other room

[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.820]
Thanks. I got it sitting on the floor. I got a whole bunch of books. I got to read speaking David Corn

[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:31.300]
I got a good article by him about and coter that nasty smelly bitch don't forget about that

[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:35.540]
Huh? Don't forget. No, but I got to get to this one first. Okay. This is more important stuff

[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.740]
And I wish now somebody was listening who ramey and the other a few out of one insult to a lot of audiences a few out there

[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.660]
Give a crap about something more than ball games and crap like that, but they don't they just don't

[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:53.320]
That's why it's so sad that that piece was on the CBC and not one of the American networks or at least even PBS

[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:57.660]
Which the CBC fifth estate puts frontline on PBS to shame is no comparison

[00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.020]
no contest

[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.260]
In fact, it was the CBC that that piece about the the Patriot missiles remember that?

[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:10.720]
Yeah, and in fact that they didn't hit one scud back in a good girl for one didn't knock down one scud

[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.260]
And the Israeli said are you people kidding for crying out loud those things aren't worth a crap

[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:18.420]
But the rathian people liked it because they're making millions and millions of dollars peddling them and they're still selling them

[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.700]
The Patriot missile it's gonna take out those scuds it now

[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:30.900]
Anyway, Bush no longer in control is Chinese hawks hijack foreign policy. This was in the Sydney morning hero Sydney, Australia

[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:32.760]
a couple of days ago

[00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:39.360]
A former Pentagon officer turned whistleblowers as a group of hawks in the Bush administration including the vice president Dictini

[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.820]
Is running a shadow foreign policy

[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:43.940]
Contra-feeding Washington's official line

[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.520]
What these people are doing now makes Iran contra

[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:56.000]
Look like amateur hour. It's worse than Iran contra worse than what happened in Vietnam said Karen Kriot Kowski a former Air Force Lieutenant Colonel

[00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:58.840]
President Bush isn't in control

[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:04.920]
The country's been hijacked. He said describing how key governmental areas of neo-conservative concern were politically staffed

[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:12.980]
Miss Kriot Kowski who retired this year after 20 years of service was a mid-least specialist in the office of under secretary of defense for policy headed by Douglas

[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.320]
Fight

[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.280]
She described a subversion of constitution limits on executive power and co-ad of

[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:23.360]
Optation to the seat of large segment of the Congress adding that in order to take that first step Iraq

[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.880]
Lies had to be told to Congress to bring them on board

[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.140]
Well, if I can interrupt this reading momentarily you notice Richard Pearl now is making noise in the

[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:36.720]
Carrying out about Iran now he's back on that again about it's a hotbed for terrorism and he's rattling the spirit again about Iran

[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.100]
But I couldn't hide

[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:45.900]
Miss Kriot Kowski said the pursuit of national security decisions often bypass civil service and active duty military professionals

[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:50.620]
And was handled instead by political appointees who shared common ideological ties

[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:58.960]
There was speculation this year that such an ideologue group had emerged and that it was behind the US attack on an Iraqi convoy in Syria in June

[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:06.140]
The New York Times quoted Patrick Lang a former senior defense intelligence agency official is saying that many in the government

[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:11.140]
Believe that the incursion was an effort by ideologues to disrupt cooperation between the US and Syria

[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.960]
Miss Kriot Kowski said there was an extra governmental network operating outside normal structures and practices

[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:24.360]
A network of political appointees and key positions who felt they needed to take some action and to make things happen in foreign affairs national security way

[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:30.180]
She said Pentagon personnel and the DIA were pressured to favorably alter assessments and reports

[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.920]
In a separate interview

[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:38.740]
Chalmers Johnson and authority on US policy said that the administration's neo-conservatives had an effect seized power from Mr. Bush

[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.680]
Dr. Johnson said the neo-conservatives had pursued an agenda outlined in the controversial

[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:54.160]
1992 defense planning guidance that document drawn up in the direction of mr. Cheney when he was defense secretary said the world's only super power should not be cautious about asserting its power

[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.620]
Are you like that? So the chicken hocks are running the roost

[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:00.480]
yeah

[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:04.660]
Richard Pearl again like I said micken all kinds of noise

[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:06.960]
Papapa ran and there are a hotbed of

[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.240]
Hezbollah and

[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.220]
Hamas and ma'amah all this other crap

[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.300]
Well, we ought to be able to spread ourselves a little bit thinner

[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.620]
I don't think we don't have enough troops to carry the thing on an Iraq which we don't know what the hell we're doing

[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.760]
We're either one of them are we're gonna go down so what's our ran?

[00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:20.860]
I mean, that's kind of like a small little country, right? Sure

[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:27.520]
They'll greet us as heroes remember that's right and of course they'll bring us all kinds of candy and hollivather to those Muslims

[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:28.820]
Gochemata heads

[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:31.580]
Howard Deans got 40 Hillary's got 36

[00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.100]
West Clark 18 and

[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:39.620]
Everybody else single digits. It's really a two horse race and Westlake Clark's kind of like the dark horse when you say

[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.140]
Is he so dark?

[00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:42.340]
well

[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:45.700]
Compared to you my pasty friend

[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:20.560]

You'd like an overgrown child. We're sitting here the goddamn world is going to hell on a hand basket

[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:51.420]
And of course this guy don't care about that. He's too busy being a yintha. He's like a light bulb kind of a person

[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:58.960]
Now let's see. I can't I can't read this because it's printed over something here like from Howard somebody but not old watermark

[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.840]
Something about these young merkins downing daily and you know to I find myself becoming irritated about the fact that our something is put together

[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.380]
85 billion dollars to be built the area

[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:18.040]
Hold up the money until those respawn. Oh yeah, right. Let's hold up the money until those responsible for the attacks on our troops are cut and punished

[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:22.940]
Plus those attacks will stop right. Let's hold up the money. That'll do it

[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:26.220]
You don't get it do you just don't have a got a clue

[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.160]
Anyway, here's this thing favorite flicks doesn't have any names of any movies on here

Does it make you feel happy and safe is like all is well with the world

[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:57.640]
Or does it make you feel inspired and strong or maybe fired up and pissed off

[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.360]
That's another one that they want to put on a vc

[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:03.800]
I'm good morning America because that's uh out of their league. You know, they don't want to say pissed off and fired up

[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.220]
Pissed off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that exactly

[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:08.680]
So there you go

[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.740]

You uh, old shoe boy. What do you know what you're from from months? So it's close enough close to New York

[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.320]
Here's a call from Miami. I'm on a wrong line. Look at that. There's nobody up. That was a for two of this piece of luck

[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.760]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:16.720]
Hello. Yes sir. Neil. Uh-huh. Hey, put one down for Hillary for me. Will you? No, okay

[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:22.560]
Here's a call from Coral Gables. It's probably that same moron again. Hello. Yeah, that is

[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.440]
Collier

[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:29.760]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. I might just do a lot of reading today. You know because they've got nothing to say this weekend

[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.440]
Find my name. Here's uh Miami. Hello

[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:39.420]
Neil. Yes sir. Good morning. Wait. It's to you. Um, I have to be concerned with this Iraq war

[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:44.400]
My first concern obviously is that we're losing on average two soldiers a day

[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:46.920]
This can turn out to be uh

[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.800]
A career a career over again with the big difference being that we're going to be losing soldiers because

[00:45:53.320 --> 00:46:00.600]
I mean we're embedded in that country without we don't know what to do. I don't like that word. Don't say either do I let me tell you something

[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.820]
I was embedded too and how he's dead. They've used it so much in the media that I'm you know

[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.200]
Not now my second concern is that

[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:15.460]
We're this administration supposedly saying that it's for security reasons which is not and then they're saying that we're there to democratize the country

[00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:24.660]
Which is not because if we truly have a faithful and good uh, you know more out which is not what are we doing supporting Saudi Arabia

[00:46:24.660 --> 00:46:33.400]
It seems to me that hypocrisy is finally on this administration. It's faith and what my biggest concern is that there seems to be little hope for the future

[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:38.260]
I mean look where they're going to be holding the first presidential debate next year. Did you hear that right here university?

[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.300]
Miami yep

[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.000]
Amazing

[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:46.300]
It's a pretty bit upset because Howard Dean's gonna say I got balls and she's not gonna like that. I knew

[00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:51.900]
Pretty for that. I can't wait. I'm saying to brok her right now. Good luck to you pali hang in there my ruchha taught her no

But we did a hell of a job and finding we don't have the anthrax perpetrator yet

[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.260]
But we do have a person of interest whose life we did a dangling job of destroying

[00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:13.860]
Stevens got a handful of anthrax we think. Remember Steven. I got a hat full sure

[00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:19.800]
Postal officials announced last night that 10 neighborhood post offices in the Washington area will not be open today

[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:24.020]
Calling the movie precautionary measure prompted by the possible detection of

[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.880]
anthrax

[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:28.420]
Boars in a melee a male sorting facility at the anacostia naval station

[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:33.400]
The decision by the West Postal Service came hours after the Navy confirmed that a censor in a male sorting machine

[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.200]
Athenable station detected the presence of anthrax for as Wednesday

[00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:41.640]
A subsequent analization done it for deepric also tested positive for

The definite fighting will not be available for several days commander Conrad Chun a Navy spokesman said last night

[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:49.560]
No relation to Connie Chung

[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:53.900]
We don't know what we've got here Chun set emphasizing the preliminary nature of the information

[00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.980]
We're not even sure that there's any anthrax but as a precaution

[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:03.380]
The federal centers for disease control and prevention recommended that the five workers who were in a facility when sensors went on

[00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:05.620]
Off start taking antibiotics Chun said

[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:11.760]
I'm things must be bad at Bayard aren't there ones that make sip road and we decide that they make it oh, I forgot well

[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.680]

[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:15.640]
Alcassal sir and oh they don't make levy Quinn

[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.400]
Which is the only reason I'm taking in fact I would let my ear faster if I would have had to take something at Bayer made

[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.020]
I'd rather have my ear chopped off

[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:26.600]
Or I could have just go to chop chop square in Saudi Arabia and re-od

[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:31.200]
Aside from closing the neighborhood postal offices the postal service last night also closed

[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:38.000]
It's the Sully on V street northeast which processes government mail postal officials also stressed they were airing on the side of caution

[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.360]
We have no reason to believe that anyone's at risk oh my god said during McEuron a postal service spokesman

[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:49.000]
The mail handling facility at the naval station is also closed because they're a little bit concerned about anthrax

[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.880]
Nobody the other yet

[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.020]
No reason to panic quite yet. Just mention that in passing

[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.260]
Okay, if you only had one movie because we'll keep the other pull up there till noon. What do you say? Okay?

[00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.180]
On the president on the Democratic candidate

[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:05.180]
If you only had one tape or DVD that you could watch like on a desert island over and over again

[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:10.740]
What would it be? I got three here godfather godfather two and network those are the only three I put down I added

[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.280]
Yes a clock recording a clockwork orange is good

[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:18.280]
Okay

[00:51:19.440 --> 00:51:22.140]
Where's most of the people are a little bit too dim to put that down?

[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.740]
If Hillary were running for president which Democrat would you prefer Hillary's got 53 oh my god

[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.760]
Hillary just moved in the first place she just took a lead there the top of the stretch

[00:51:33.380 --> 00:51:35.800]
She stuck on those in front how are dean 50

[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:40.860]
Wesley Clark 21 don't care on for bush 17 9.2 percent bushies

[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:41.780]
Idiots

[00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:47.060]
Don't give a crap 17. Oh, there's somebody almost there's dumb as a president. There's Prince Charles

[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:56.880]
There's some rumor about how he's involved in some scandal but he discussed nor disclosed because of a high court injunction blocking publication in the UK

[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:01.500]
But ever all family they sure got some problems, you know

[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:02.620]
God

[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:08.540]
Anyway, don't give a crap which I think is appropriate for that 17 in fact Prince Charles Ross Perot

[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:11.680]
All these people with a big years and double

[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.100]
Hey president thing same brother you mentioned it

[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:20.340]
Al sharp in nine John Kerry six Dennis goodson. It's five speaking of gigantic years that I'm bad

[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.820]
You know everything he says is great. I wish I wish he had some kind of a chance

[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:28.900]
But he is his hairpiece makes Mo look like Brad Pitt. I mean come on

[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.640]
Have you seen that thing though?

[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.580]
It's like it's like a bunch of black

[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.780]
Patches like from an old paramose pants

[00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.660]
Just like glued together and stuck on his head. I mean I never say anything like that in my life. I'm sure you've seen black patches

[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.540]
Jewelieberman two. I'm sure you have big head harder pair Carol mostly brawn one and John Edwards out of 183 votes

[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:53.520]
He's kicking ass his own. He still don't have one. He still hasn't got a vote

[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:57.840]
I don't want to oh come on somebody please vote for poor John Edwards. He'll start drooling again

[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:00.600]
If you don't cast him at least one vote

[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.160]
Oh boy this uh I'll get to that thing again about Texas textbooks. I'll get to that

[00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:15.000]
They'll prefer to hear some good news. Well so Friday we want to go to the weekend with on a little positive note not easy these days

[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.980]
Although Ryan and Paul said

[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.100]
Uh a third federal judge should a temporary restraining order yesterday. All right

[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.720]
Halting enforcement of that new law prohibiting certain late-terma abortions

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:34.280]
The ruling in San Francisco of course home of the Antichrist blocks enforcement of the new abortion law 900 planned parenthood the clinic nationwide

[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:35.760]
clinic

[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:40.160]
The ruling was the third since president bush signed the partial birth abortion ban act of

[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:44.920]
2003 on Wednesday in each case the judges said the law could be declared unconstitutional

[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.960]
Because it doesn't contain an exception to protect the women's health

[00:53:47.960 --> 00:53:52.420]
What they don't understand is see the women are already alive and the right wingers including a president

[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:57.580]
They don't care about anybody who's alive all they care about is that fetus man the fetus. They're hugging it

[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.180]
They're squeezing it. They're obsessed with the fetus the nebulus unborn

[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.460]
A federal ruling in New York earlier Thursday covers doctors who perform about half the nation's abortions

[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:13.380]
A ruling by a federal judge in Nebraska less than our afterborn signed the law applies only to the four doctors who filed the lawsuit

[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:18.460]
When he signed the law Bush said he would use every legal avenue to fight anyone trying to block its enforcement

[00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.600]
What a piece of crap

[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.980]
The law does not provide an exception for the health of the mother

[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:28.060]
But it appears to provide some exception if her life is endangered by the pregnancy. Let me read that again

[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:29.340]
Poojit

[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:34.520]
Signed by your president by your caring compassionate conservative president George W. Bush

[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.300]
The law does not provide an exception for the health of the mother

[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:41.640]
But it appears to provide some exception if her life is endangered by the pregnancy

[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:47.520]
The form of abortion is not banned if it is necessary to save the life of a mother whose life is endangered by a physical disorder

[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.880]
physical illness or

[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:51.060]
physical injury including a life and

[00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:56.240]
Endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself according to the test of the law

[00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:04.420]
Planned parenthood president Gloria felt the plot of the San Francisco order saying it hails the it halts the implementation of this dangerous and reckless abortion ban

[00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:10.720]
The unconstitutional law denies women in consultation with their doctors and families the right to make decisions about their own health felt said

[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:16.280]
And they written statement thankfully the court understood the immediacy of the situation and temporarily stopped this law from taking effect

[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:24.940]
The New York ruling covers providers affiliated to the National abortion Federation which claims to represent the doctors who provide happy abortion sought by women each year

[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:33.020]
The battle to keep us from going back into the totally into the stone age continues, but good luck to us all

[00:55:34.380 --> 00:55:38.320]
See he's busy with things like that while Dick Cheney and his chicken hawks

[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.600]
They're whipped up all kinds of crap all kinds of plans, you know

[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.360]
Devious plan forget about that pipeline that oil pipeline throughout Afghanistan. That was small potatoes, you know

[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:52.000]
We can just have one big hose. We can do a hose job on the whole world sounds good. All right. That's what we're doing

[00:55:54.020 --> 00:56:01.440]
The state board of education in Austin, Texas voted yesterday to approve biology textbooks despite criticism from some scientist and religious

[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:07.080]
Activist who say the books fail to present criticisms of evolution. Thank God. Oh God

[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.660]
The 11 of four vote was preliminary and the board was expected to be a final approval today

[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.220]
If they don't build burn the building down first

[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:20.500]
Some religious and alternative science groups that argue that weaknesses in the theory of evolution weren't adequately presented in the books

[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:27.320]
But scientists and educators argue that the theory of evolution is widely believed and it's a cornerstone of modern scientific research

[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:33.720]
See that's bad modern scientific research. Those are two things that the the Barbison of Goiom they're not into that they don't like that

[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:36.620]
It's all part of that commie pinko heathen plot

[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:43.480]
Texas to the nation second largest buyer of textbooks and textbooks sold on the state are often marketed by publishers elsewhere

[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:46.900]
Texas Californian florida come for more than 30%

[00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:53.980]
Of the nation's four billion dollar public school book market three dozen publishers invest millions of dollars in Texas

[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:57.660]
Some board members had asked to vote on the books one by one

[00:56:57.660 --> 00:57:00.860]
But the motion was over return and all were approved with one vote

[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:05.480]
I wish we had the opportunity to vote on each book because they're not the same said board member Dan McElroy

[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:11.200]
One of the four board members who voted against the nothing the books he called the presentation of evolution in most of the books dogmatic

[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:16.040]
People don't realize the threat of scientific dogmatism. He said they're not looking for truth

[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.660]
They're not looking for the truth like the Lord our God

[00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:24.440]
The great the creator. Do you notice how every time bush went like the mr. Cippie and Kentucky and made these speeches

[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:30.260]
He talked about how these can't republican candidates were good family men who had a great relationship with the Almighty with the creator

[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:35.260]
Of course, I'm telling you man you do people out there that are sitting back like put up on your finger up each other's ass

[00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:37.120]
You don't get it you just don't understand

[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:39.900]
They couldn't do it at the ballot box

[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.820]
So and of course they had an eight-year interruption there was they couldn't blow blow him out of there without that

[00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:44.760]
Peniscage stuff

[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.660]
So they had like steal their way back in so they could put over this religious fundamentalist lunatic agenda with this arm

[00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:54.300]
Again on the way by the way not to this future on the rest of us who aren't too crazy about the ride, you know

[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:59.600]
We're not too crazy. We'll walk we're not too crazy about this a ride. Oh, you will no

[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:01.620]
The not base

[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:09.760]
You know there's that fat bitch again honestly. We feathered for breach of contra Jesus get her off of my screen

[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:14.880]
Case I was hoping for summary judgments. I will now wait till the end of the case

[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:20.300]
And then I feel fairly certain that the judge will decide in our favor as the facts are very very clear

[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.580]
I'll tell you one thing if they she just paid them by the pound. I think she can handle it no problem

[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.920]
Ha ha

[00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:29.340]
If Hillary a ran for president which the Democrat would you prefer

[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:33.960]

[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:49.160]
He's got something to say about a beep better book, but he doesn't there's nothing there

[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:51.900]

Your words were delicious, goofy talk

No, I- it's a deal

[01:01:02.940 --> 01:01:06.140]
Howardine 73, Hillary 64, and Wesley Clark 26

[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.580]
Nobody else even in the contest

[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.080]
Uh, what could be the possible reason?

[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.360]
Maybe it's because they think that if she wins

[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.040]
Well maybe number one they think she could win the election against Bush

[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.920]
And number two if she wins that Bubba

[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.320]
Will be the first husband

[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.520]
He'll be the puppet master

[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:22.260]
Right, he'll be pulling the strings behind the scenes and that's the way

[01:01:22.260 --> 01:01:23.440]
Getting bubble back in there again

[01:01:24.300 --> 01:01:26.000]
Right, the sock puppet master

[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:26.960]
Exactly

[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.060]
But what else could possibly be is you like I don't know

[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:32.420]
Well, I think the fact that her name is Clinton

[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.060]
I think we're like mesmerized by that

[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:35.400]
I'm not saying that I'm not gonna add

[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:37.340]
I'd vote for her 50 times against the Bushmeister

[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.240]
If she's the one who emancipates from this fascism

[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.320]
More power to that bit, to a Hillary

[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.260]
Zolvi in North Miami, why do you send me his faxes?

[01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:47.380]
Yeah, what is it?

[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:48.960]
Isn't he like a chronic fetch?

[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:49.720]
Whatever

[01:01:50.220 --> 01:01:54.380]
All about the thing the other day about the plan of the CBC thing

[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.700]
And about reading the Michael Moore book

[01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:57.660]
And he's like George doesn't want to read

[01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:59.260]
So how about I do a publisher

[01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:00.820]
No, I'm not gonna read the book on a year

[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:01.940]
Okay, go on and buy the book

[01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:03.900]
Have your boyfriend read it to you, Zoli, okay?

[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.480]
You silly person you

[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.180]
Have your boyfriend read it to you

[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:08.920]
Why do you're sitting back with your legs up in the air?

[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.080]
Oh speaking of your legs up in the air

[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.300]
We got that WTO thing

[01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.980]
But we better start building this other pool

[01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:17.440]
You know it because I don't think we got we got the four names on it

[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.200]
You and I did

[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.280]
But that doesn't get the job then if you only had one taper

[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.880]
Like if you were stranded on a desert island

[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.340]
And of course a lot of other time you'd be spent hunting bananas

[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:28.280]
And working on the old python whatever you were doing

[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:28.940]
But coconut

[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:30.620]
And you're coconut

[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:34.260]
But if you had one taper DVD movie that you could watch over and over again

[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:36.000]
What would it be if it was one and only one

[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.820]
See this this precludes those people will say

[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:39.960]
Well, I got a few for you

[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.740]
I got a couple if you have one

[01:02:41.740 --> 01:02:43.780]
No, that's why we're did it that way

[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:47.300]
To avoid those pains in the ass who always want more than one

[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:49.560]
And this isn't the same as just the best movie

[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:50.460]
No, of course not

[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.100]
It's not the same thing

[01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.420]
This isn't even a one that you've watched the most in the past

[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.780]
This is the one that you could like live with

[01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.200]
That would like solve your needs

[01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.500]
Like I got one but we won't put it on here

[01:02:58.500 --> 01:02:59.000]
Because it's old

[01:02:59.000 --> 01:02:59.860]
Debbie does Dallas

[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.280]
That would solve a lot of your needs

[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.220]
Not mine

[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:07.540]
Godfather

[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:08.820]
Godfather too

[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:10.520]
Network or our clockwork are in season

[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.080]
The only four we got on there so far in the world

[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:12.440]
Hours

[01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:12.980]
We'll get some

[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:15.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.160]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:18.820]
And Verizon wireless light

[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:20.340]
Here's pomp it oh hello

[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:21.800]
Hello

[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.460]
Yeah

[01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.420]
Yes, Anne

[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.700]
I got a good one for your poor

[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.720]
How about the Flazzner

[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:28.940]
I like that

[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:29.360]
Hello

[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:30.920]
And the prisoner

[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:33.100]
But the prisoner wasn't really a movie

[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:33.860]
Was that what he did

[01:03:33.860 --> 01:03:34.060]
Oh

[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:35.380]
Sirius

[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:36.000]
Oh

[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:36.600]
Well

[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.400]
No, it wasn't

[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.540]
So like I said it's a good one if it was a movie

[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:40.240]
But is it a movie

[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.520]
No, it's a mini series

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.920]
I mean we could put it on there

[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.460]
But it wouldn't be the right series

[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:47.100]
Is I want to pick mash 11 years of entertainment there

[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:48.140]
Mash was a movie though

[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:48.680]
See that's where

[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:49.460]
Oh yeah, that's right

[01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:50.340]
A lot of sample

[01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:51.120]
Uh-huh

[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.520]
Prisoner was never a movie

[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.780]
I don't know how they would have made it a movie

[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.020]
Really when you come right down to it

[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:57.340]
Because

[01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:58.860]
You know what I mean

[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:00.320]
I guess they could have

[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.040]
But it wasn't

[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.280]
It wasn't so autonomous

[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.100]
Nice try, Pally

[01:04:04.100 --> 01:04:05.200]
I mean there's the first call

[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.000]
Trying to put one on there

[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.800]
And it's not even a movie

[01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.860]
Pound 5 60 on the AT&T

[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:11.740]
Verizon wireless line

[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:12.980]
And who is number 6

[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.280]
Well, that's right it's Patrick McGuwen

[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:16.460]
Here's the lady in West Palm Beach

[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:16.720]
Hello

[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:20.020]
Hi, I've got a great movie to laugh with

[01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:22.260]
With great outdoors with John Candy

[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:23.780]
The great outdoors

[01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:25.080]
Rest in peace, Manifida

[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.960]
Just put down that last piece of candy

[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:29.380]
I just laugh every time I see it

[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:29.700]
Okay

[01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:32.300]
Enjoy your day

[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:33.300]
Bye bye

[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.380]
Boi-Ve, see ya

[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:35.000]
Boi-Ve

[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.440]
John Candy, he was Canadian, eh?

[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.920]
I just mentioned that in passing

[01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:42.580]
What does Ted Kennedy

[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.700]
Why? After lie, after lie

[01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:45.560]
And quote

[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.960]
The decision to honor Kennedy was made before the war

[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.780]
And his spokesman says he is looking forward to the event

[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:53.540]
Oh yeah, that's right

[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.920]
Bush seniors got to give him that award

[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.160]
For his hard-core service

[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.560]
That's gonna be a beautiful thing

[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.060]
I hope he gets up there and makes his speech in just ribs

[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.680]
W of major bloody ass

[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.760]
I just love to see it

[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.460]
Nice go on Ted

[01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.880]
By the way, put the sandwich down

[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:07.980]
Here's a call from Plantation

[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:08.260]
Hello

[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:09.740]
Yeah, I got one for you, Paul

[01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:10.980]
Yes sir

[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:12.440]
Ah, ah, ah, ah, okay

[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.160]
Wait, tag

[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.380]
Get a little push of the phone, okay

[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.040]
Speaking of that thing with the holes in it

[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.160]
You know like your ass

[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.780]
Coral Gables in Plantation

[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.060]
They seem to have something in common

[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.340]
Here's a call from a Pompano, hello

[01:05:23.340 --> 01:05:24.240]
Yeah, hi, you

[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:25.080]
Yes sir

[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:26.620]
Yeah, I don't have an edition of Paul

[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:28.400]
Have you got the pot shut down, Scott or something

[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.540]
There's all of a sudden, I know my hearing hasn't gone like rush

[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:32.260]
Go ahead sir

[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.100]
Yeah, yeah, I don't have an edition for the Paul

[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.820]
Because it's on there already, the Godfather

[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.000]
But I wanted to ask you something

[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.820]
I think the key for the Democrats

[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.740]
So when the election next year is two things

[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:44.700]
One, they really need to select a very good vice presidential candidate

[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.900]
I mean, Gordon, the figures mistakenly put

[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.160]
Lieberman on

[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.080]
No, they don't have to put a very good one on it

[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.660]
They just don't have to put a bad one on it

[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:52.860]
So death wish like Lieberman

[01:05:52.860 --> 01:05:56.780]
Yeah, I mean because Lieberman basically cost them five states as far as the circuser

[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.580]
I mean, he could even carry his own home state

[01:05:58.580 --> 01:05:59.140]
Absolutely

[01:05:59.540 --> 01:05:59.940]
Right

[01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:01.880]
And whoever is the candidate

[01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:04.260]
Do the right thing, embrace Baba

[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:05.760]
Ask him for help

[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:06.160]
I mean

[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.180]
It'll be a slam dunk if they just, you know

[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.420]
Get Baba to like, I mean, go out distance themselves so far from Clinton

[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.440]
For whatever reason

[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.740]
And you know, it was the biggest mistake he made

[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.440]
Other than, you know, selecting Lieberman

[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.360]
I just feel that, you know

[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:24.720]
Baba shows up and you know, campaigns for the person

[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.740]
The candidates are going to make it so much easier, I believe

[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:28.900]
I mean, I think

[01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:32.500]
I say Bobby Graham provides president that can open when Florida

[01:06:33.380 --> 01:06:33.840]
Yeah

[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.900]
And Howard Deans his gram is on his short list of choices if he wins it

[01:06:37.900 --> 01:06:40.260]
Yeah, that's true, then he'll help for sure

[01:06:40.260 --> 01:06:45.360]
But let's just hope that, you know, this society in next November

[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.420]
I mean, that's all we can hope for now

[01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.260]
Okay, Palagher, my legs crossed, thanks

[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.200]
Okay, but I see

[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.280]
Cross your legs and your eyes and your arms, okay

[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.580]
In fact, just wrap yourself up like the Buddha

[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.280]
Like Christ Rafford, he just puts his arms around himself

[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.280]
And the dark, complex Buddha, not too dark

[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:07.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 18 T and T in Verizon Wireless line

[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.800]
Howard Deans 78, Hillary 69, 69, Hillary

[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:12.800]
Oh, she don't like that position

[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.840]
Wesley Clark has got

[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:16.000]
Fathered, man

[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.620]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale, hello

[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:19.220]
Hello

[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:20.040]
Yes, sir

[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:22.080]
I got an addition to your pay

[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:22.820]
Okay

[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:23.940]
Caddy Shack

[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.640]
Caddy Shack, okay

[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.640]
That's a little bit of a start

[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.100]
Okay, thank you so much

[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.400]
Well, he stays home a lot, I guess

[01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.020]
Caddy Shack

[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:33.580]
All right

[01:07:34.100 --> 01:07:35.660]
Is the best movie he ever seen

[01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:39.120]
I mean, I do like Caddy Shack, I've seen it a couple of times

[01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:40.180]
That's all right

[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:40.560]
No

[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, now what is this?

[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:44.720]
In Queen

[01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:46.700]
But some parents were furious

[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:47.740]
Let's sweep it

[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.540]
It's about for high school

[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.460]
No, why did it happen to come at Fort Lauderdale?

[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:51.480]
You know, there were innocent kids

[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:52.840]
They were just my own business

[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:53.660]
They didn't rate the class

[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:55.740]
The police saying not everyone is innocent

[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:58.120]
A lot of the activity has been seen in this time

[01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:58.480]
What are you calling?

[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.220]
Are you watching the movie?

[01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:01.000]
I mean, weapons, a kid

[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]
Isn't the answer

[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.260]
A drug sweep at his public high school

[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.620]
Strap it high in Paris

[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.020]
Some of the officers had their weapons drawn

[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:09.300]
And they got an option here

[01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.860]
They got all the two down on the floor

[01:08:10.860 --> 01:08:12.860]
At the faces or heads of both students

[01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.500]
It was down in a position where

[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.700]
Should somebody who has drugs

[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:17.540]
Some of our children

[01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:18.480]
On the other side

[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.300]
And he appears

[01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:20.100]
A drug sweep

[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:20.800]
Getting caught

[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.000]
And for some reason

[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.100]
If they made a total decision

[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.760]
And decided to use a weapon

[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.640]
I've never seen anything like that in my life

[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.800]
No, if I was told to ever

[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.300]
The officers say it was for everyone's safety

[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.220]
They did handcuff several students

[01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:33.400]
Who wouldn't get down

[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:34.740]
Oh my god

[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.680]
No reaction on our part

[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.080]
I'm sure it was an inconvenience

[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.580]
To those individuals

[01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.060]
Who were on that hallway

[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.920]
But I think there's the valuable experience there

[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.680]
A canine officer did smell drugs

[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:47.580]
And 12 book bags

[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.160]
But nothing was actually found

[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.600]
But police aren't discouraged

[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:52.760]
We've sent the message to the folks

[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.360]
The other half

[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.020]
And dealing drugs at the school

[01:08:55.020 --> 01:08:56.040]
That um

[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.660]
You know

[01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:57.880]
We know you're doing that

[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.980]
We have no hesitation to come in and address it

[01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.620]
They've got all the kids down on the floor

[01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:04.040]
Right

[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.520]
With their guns pointed

[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.000]
Not so big of a concern

[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]
They're looking for truth

[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.720]
I think it was very serious

[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.080]
Senseless

[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.660]
Man fascism is alive

[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:15.180]
A lot of time to buy the boots baby

[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:15.900]
Hip boots good

[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:16.260]
My

[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:17.900]
I love all

[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:20.020]
This is 420560

[01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:21.780]
You ain't too way

[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:27.140]
Gordon gives South Florida a major blowjob

[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:28.160]
I like it

[01:09:28.740 --> 01:09:29.820]
I like it

[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:34.920]
560

[01:09:36.280 --> 01:09:39.720]
WQAM presents the OPM Anthony show

[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.460]

[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:42.760]

[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:44.400]

It's me with a low voice

[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.180]
Oh

[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.960]
Yeah, you got the effective point

[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.340]
Okay

Hi Anthony

Mohawar David

[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.740]
Yeah, I was wondering how long we'd take for you

[01:09:54.740 --> 01:09:56.260]
To punch to get around to me

[01:09:56.260 --> 01:09:57.700]
I really hit the big time

[01:09:57.700 --> 01:10:00.020]
Hi, here I am with the OPM Anthony

Yeah, we're gonna rape you now

[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.820]
You cut up your kidneys

[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.260]
This is a family show

[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:06.600]
Hi

[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.260]

Hey

[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.440]
Get your head up

[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.400]
Get out of there

[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.340]
That offensive means

[01:10:15.340 --> 01:10:16.000]
That's my deal

[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.220]
I don't touch my deal in kids

[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:18.800]
I'm a panda

[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:21.340]
Why do you think everybody will ring me

[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:23.320]
Why cause we think it's funny that's why

[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.960]
Yeah, you got a nice back

[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.440]

[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.800]
I want the red ball

[01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.780]

You're not supposed to mean that

[01:10:58.880 --> 01:10:59.880]
Yeah, I'm really sorry

I'm 5'60

[01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:25.900]
It's a lot of 32 at 5'60 WQM

[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.640]
Reason I played that, I bet you don't know it

[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:28.600]
No, I don't know why

[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:29.640]
Here's the answer

[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:32.700]
Woman sentenced in cathedral sex case

[01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:35.480]
Just in only moments ago

[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.320]
Woman accused of having sex with her boyfriend

[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.760]
Inside St. Patrick's Cathedral

[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.420]
As part of a radio show, Stunt was sentenced to

[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.580]
Yeah

[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:46.140]
Five days of community service

[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.200]
Hey, so that's it

[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:49.380]
No

[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:51.760]
Loretta Lynn Harper 36-peak-gilly

[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.180]
That is early conduct yesterday

[01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:56.460]
Harper and Brian Florence were arrested in August 2002

[01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.220]
After police officers listening to the Opie and Anthony show

[01:11:59.220 --> 01:12:01.120]
Her producer Paul Mercurio say on the ear

[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:03.480]
That he was speaking on a cell phone while watching the couple

[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:04.700]
Copulate in the cathedral

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.400]
They were doing it the old in and out

[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.620]
Florence 38 out of a heart attack in September

[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.920]
So it goes to show the Lord

[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.580]
Worse in

[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.020]
Mysterious ways

[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.120]
Mercurio 43

[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:16.200]
Plated gilly early in the day that is certainly conduct

[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.220]
The judge ordered him to for seven days of community service

[01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:22.120]
The stunt part of a regular feature in which couples could win prizes

[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.460]
For having sex in public places

[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:26.520]
Resulted in W&EW FM firing DJs

[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:28.260]
Greg Opie Hughes, Anthony Cumia

[01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:32.200]
A $357,000 FCC fine against Infinity Broadcasting

[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:36.120]
Scott Farrell getting blown off because W&EW FM dropped the format

[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.400]
And etc. So we got Farrell here now which is a good news for us

[01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.340]
But bad news for them

[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:43.080]
Five days community service for that broad

[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.260]
How do you like that? That's so bad

[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:45.060]
Yeah

[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:48.540]
There are a lot of people out there who would like to screw in church and only get five days

[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.600]
How about the only movie that's just as funny

[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.320]
The 30th time is the first

[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.260]
Third man

[01:12:55.260 --> 01:12:57.120]
Airplane says this fact is very good choice

[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:57.660]
I love that

[01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.900]
That's right in there with my other

[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:00.180]
Turns

[01:13:00.180 --> 01:13:01.040]
Love it

[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:03.060]
And also South Park the movie

[01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.120]
Ah Jesus, are you f***ing carrying me

[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:05.540]
Yeah, I know

[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:07.060]
You said also it's a good one for list

[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.080]
So the list is building thanks to the fact is not so much on the phone

[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.640]
That's okay

[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:14.820]
They're mesmerized by the hill everything speaking of mesmerized I must tell you

[01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.580]
I mean you know you and I sat in that room there and watched what happened on 9-11

[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:23.840]
And that's just left all of us with our jaw hanging into our ankles but

[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:27.800]
But a close second for me is this thing that I just saw

[01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.400]
Yeah, I'm pretty showing

[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:32.820]
How can they take that so lightly? How can it just be like oh well?

[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:34.860]
You know, this is just the effort way things are

[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:36.960]
As the father of a high school student

[01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:40.700]
If that had happened to my child there would be lawsuits at least

[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.280]
Right, lawsuits galore at least

[01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:46.560]
Can you imagine you're back in high school all you have people out there

[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:50.660]
You're sitting there going from class to class and all of a sudden everybody on the floor okay?

[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:55.920]
And if you don't hop to and get right in the position they want a handcuff you

[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.520]
Right

[01:13:57.240 --> 01:14:01.740]
And here come in a whole bunch a whole slew of uniform cops with their guns drawn

[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.900]
And they're gun sniffing their drug sniffing dogs

[01:14:06.020 --> 01:14:12.740]
And then they're and they're making a massive search they didn't actually find any they found some traces like maybe a pin joint

[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:19.780]
I mean seriously this I'm Tonya I said it before and maybe with my psychic powers again

[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.620]
But the public doesn't understand that they're freedom

[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:30.000]
In some kind of a goddamn drug search based on what based on the fact that their kids in high school doing drugs

[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.820]
Oh, what a concept I can't believe that good thing to know that right away next

[01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:38.780]
Thing you know will be finding out the kids in school are doing having sex. Yeah

[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:46.300]
God knows what they'll be looking at then be just like the abuela's they have a different kind of sniffing dog for that now but they do

[01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:54.800]
I'm saving here that says I want to read it from James V. Oh, I love it. That's my favorite facts. I love

[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:02.380]
Lamentation about the boy and that was before they had this police raid the school in northern the summer

[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:03.820]
Charleston, South Carolina

[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:09.280]
Well, I'll tell you I know a lot of you people don't like CNN and I don't I keep it on here only in case there's something

[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.700]
You know dramatic going to happen in the world in the middle of the show that we need to talk about but

[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.340]
You've got to watch it during the day because I know they run this stuff over and over again. I can't believe I can't believe what I just saw I

[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.640]
cannot believe it

[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.060]
I mean

[01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:28.220]
What are we talking about here? I would say about a bunch of people

[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:33.340]

[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:07.760]
It's the 91 release of William hurt a bunch of other people in it and it makes it much more cold here as the bait is long

But if you're on a desert island. Yeah, you had a lot of time on your hands and my vote

The Harold says should we stay or should we go right now the scorecard is divided among downtown Miami

[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:25.620]
Binnises and civic offices trying to anticipate the workplace problems caused by this month's free trade summit

[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:34.640]
Okay, scared off by warnings of violent protests three closures and traffic types dozens of business institutions have decided to make

She decided let her 14 employees stay home after seeing pictures this week of what happened in 99 at the WTO meeting in Seattle

[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:04.140]
We cater to the elite capitalist they hate so much. She said she's owned the store at 50s Northeastern Avenue for almost 60 years

[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:07.760]
Life isn't worth taking a chance. It's only money good going Sandy good point

It's particularly exciting for our students will have an opportunity to witness history being made in their own campus

[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.500]
Right what campus Donna?

[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.600]

[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:11.900]
But when it did the bird

[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:18.400]
The University set the commission a formal proposal. I was put together under the direction of Shalili a former cabinet member in the administration

[01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:23.640]
Bill Clinton a bitch and endorsed by governor Jeff Bush president of a brother president George Bush no kidding

[01:21:24.140 --> 01:21:26.760]
The debate September 30th September what?

[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:32.280]
2004 will be the first presidential debate to be held in Florida in modern times holy Schmidt

[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.140]
Huh, it's very appropriate the same state where these people Bush is still the first election

[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:41.000]
Three other debates all in October be held at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland

[01:21:42.180 --> 01:21:46.180]
Washington University in St. Louis and Arizona State University in 10 p

[01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:51.820]
They said that would be a good idea because they'd often play the Padres there and I mean the charges whatever their name is in 10 p

[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.660]
So let's hold one there. Why not if it was good enough for them?

[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.840]
Speaking of polls here's what I should make you feel a little bit better all of our Dean supporters

[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:06.760]
How are Dean holds a 14 point lead over John Kerry and a poll likely voters in New Hampshire's Democratic presidential primary

[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:09.940]
I'm at signs that the contest is evolving into a two-man race

[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:17.700]
Dean the former Vermont governor had the support of 38% while Kerry the scary-looking Massachusetts senator was backed by 24%

[01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:19.860]
38 to 24 poll released yesterday

[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:25.180]
Dean led carried by ten points in a similar survey by the Manchester New Hampshire based organization in October

[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.980]
Then he had 24% I was all the way up to 38

[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:30.160]
Others in the field

[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.360]
Single digits Wesley Clark John Edwards and Connecticut Jew Lieberman four points each

[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:42.240]
Missouri a representative Dick Gavhart three percent Dennis Kusinich with that offer here peace care mostly brought out sharp in one percent or less

[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:48.440]
Dean and Kerry were favored viewed favorably by two-thirds of the voters Gavhart viewed favorably by just over half

[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:51.720]
52% he's got a Chinaman's chance in held the Gavhart, okay?

[01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.740]
Not everybody's into the dick

[01:22:55.180 --> 01:22:57.260]
92 votes for Howard Dean

[01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:02.020]
Hillary Clinton 80 Wesley Clark 37 and then I'm for Bush

[01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:06.780]
30 36 10.9% enough to make you want to cry in

[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.940]
In other words that you know what that is that's the don't confuse us with the facts crowd

[01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:18.620]
Yeah, and in fact it went on after the CNN just showed that thing and I described it that read on that high school

[01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.060]
It went up four tens of a point right well

[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:26.140]
That's a good way of keeping drugs out of school. That's right. Keep them damn punk kids in line

[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:29.900]
Keep the drugs out of school go in there just I don't know if they're we know it and just start

[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:34.700]
Shooting them off any area. You know any one ricochets and kills a couple of kids that'd be a real good lesson. That's it

[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:36.840]
No more this damn

[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:41.420]
Liberal commie pinko's to side with all these drug addicts like Rush Limbaugh. Oh, excuse me

[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.540]
56 more sure not get my free spots on this other pool are we?

[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:52.680]

Strongly on many issues over the year, but I have to tell you on the other hand, I admire you a lot because number one

[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:28.020]
You don't you dish it out evenly to every group

[01:24:29.420 --> 01:24:36.340]
You don't pander yeah, and you're a straight shooter. You are who you are. You never pretend to be somebody else

[01:24:36.340 --> 01:24:41.640]
Yeah, and I'm talking to you as a Cuban Republican who hates bushes got

[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:47.760]
Great and cannot wait to see him defeated excellent, and I'm gonna make one comment to you

[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:56.480]
You were talking this morning about the fact that here we are you know six more people get killed today and seven seven seven

[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:03.360]
Okay, close the 16 that we love last week doesn't even hit the news. I mean, I'm watching today show that just you know

[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:07.000]
They're to see what they talk about it. I mean, it just briefly they're showing somebody

[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.580]
They're talking about Rosie Rosie O'Donnell and Scott and Lacey Peterson exactly. I mean, you know, that's why I heard this one

[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:19.120]
And I am embarrassed of the present this country has become really so invalid. I mean, they're really worthless

[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:26.540]
I mean, it's really isn't the payment and nothing else. Yeah, the other thing that worries me is and I just came from a trip where I went through

[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:27.620]
North Carolina

[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.580]
North Carolina

[01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:32.660]
Kentucky

[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:39.320]
West Virginia all of those states and I can tell you every single radio station was an evangelical station

[01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:44.900]
I was going through the dial and I couldn't get anything but evangelical station. Oh my god. I was preaching about how good

[01:25:46.020 --> 01:25:50.080]
Bush is yeah, and how you know everything you know, it's just really incredible

[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:54.280]
I mean, you know, I don't know what happened to us who with rush and all these other people

[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:00.480]
I mean, you know, we really don't have anybody who can talk for

[01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:06.180]
I'm not a liberal but I'm a moderate but I believe you know that that that that re-radicals are on both sides

[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.600]
You know, you have radicals on the right too

[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:09.580]
Well, let's wait

[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:13.740]
Go to the gaming town man. You're going to watch a times

[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:20.400]
And hang in there. Yeah, okay, thank you. Well there you go. There's the good Cuban. There's one

[01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:23.200]
We got a few to not talking about few good Cubans

[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.700]
But I mean a few who are like not gonna vote for Bush who aren't the sucked in by all this bull crap

[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:33.380]
20% sadly 20% what that's the stat that keeps coming out 20% well, that's not that's not too bad

[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.880]
No, because seriously when you look at ethnicity for example

[01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:44.700]
When you look at blacks, it's almost always over 90% of our democratic and when you look at Jews

[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:49.920]
It's over 90% of what I'll tell you one thing. I don't want even going to it. You know, what's the use of even saying it? Yeah, oh

[01:26:52.680 --> 01:26:53.060]
You

[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:58.220]
You you start adding it up in your mind like women especially after he signed that anti-abortion bill the other day

[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:02.480]
That the judges had to like put a halt on and of course they'll try to drive it all the way to the Supreme Court

[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.260]
And then it gets flunkies up there to rubber stamp it

[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:09.860]
What kind of a rational woman but then again using that expression in rational woman because a lot of those right to life

[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:15.640]
Fluentics or maybe a majority of our women their religious brainwashed to the fetus huggers

[01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:21.400]
Here's one from Jim and the Redlands who says the movie that always is in my player anticipating a

[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:25.140]
bad broadcast is endless summer

[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:35.900]
Oh Jim and the Redlands don't let him find out what you're doing out there sweetheart. It's a 60 oh I've seen it

[01:27:35.900 --> 01:27:40.340]
60 surfing film made by Bruce Brown. I recommended. I've seen it. Yeah

[01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:44.120]
Yeah

[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:49.020]
Well, you know driving movie channel that I'm always telling you about with all the corregal movies for some reason

[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:51.580]
They have an obsession with that kind of stuff and the Phil's time, you know

[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:57.980]
So a couple of days a year they have like all of Bruce Brown surfing movies side by each like back to back, you know

[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:01.760]
So I've seen it and every now and then I can't turn the damn thing off

[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.000]
You know, that's me that's this old fact so Jim and the Redlands know if you're having a good old time a gay time in the Redlands

[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:08.700]
endless summer

[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:12.760]
5 6 7 0 5 6 you know I told you that whole surfing thing

[01:28:12.760 --> 01:28:16.460]
That's why that guy that was married to a your close-personal friend Pamela Lee with a big boobs

[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:23.200]
What that was his name Kelly Slater. Yeah, see? I've got I'm getting better not the worse. I'm getting younger. I just turned 57

[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:29.660]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hey, you know how you doing buddy pretty good sir. I'm doing good too

[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:33.920]
I got one for your poll. It would be pink Floyd the wall oddly enough

[01:28:33.920 --> 01:28:38.000]
But only because you can listen to the music while you're cracking coconuts, you know

[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.660]
And it had you know on your island it has sex drugs also too. What more can you want? Yeah my girl

[01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:49.420]
Unless you go to school in Charleston South Carolina there you go. Well, I'm going to rate a elementary school for Ridlin here

[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:50.980]
Right

[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:58.620]
Man you buy all me okay, don't get me a taxi for rush. Okay. My girl wants to pick Greece by the way

[01:28:58.620 --> 01:28:59.660]
But she does

[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:08.840]
All right guys, thank you. We put Greece on there. She likes John revolt. You sure might out what do you mean Greece put some Greece on it?

[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:10.240]
No wouldn't be the first time

[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:15.860]
Yeah, and of course if you live in Taylor Michigan like I said you got a big old jug of

[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:19.020]
Vaseline on top of the TV for emergencies when you get like all excited

[01:29:20.420 --> 01:29:24.620]
If Hillary Clinton ran for president, which Democrat would you prefer Howard Dean 99?

[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:28.200]
He's right on the cusp of a hundred right on the edge right on the precipice

[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.580]
Swalloway Clinton's got 83 for old Hillary. They like her

[01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:37.520]
Don't care. I'm from Bush 39 11.3% it keeps boosting up and up and up

[01:29:37.520 --> 01:29:42.900]
I think we may be going to get the creeped on us before the days out. I think so. Wesley Clarks got 38

[01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.840]
Don't give her crap 33. I'll sharpen 16

[01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:50.440]
Scary old John Kerry 12. He does look craggy though, you know that

[01:29:50.440 --> 01:29:54.940]
Then it's a sentence 10 who says all the right things and looks like hell on wheels 10

[01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:58.400]
Seriously, you've got to see the hair piece you must watch one of those debates

[01:29:58.400 --> 01:30:01.600]
You just you'll fall into full laughing you've never seen anything so

[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.460]
You'll have to see it. I could look up a picture

[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:11.380]
Julie Berman 5 Carol Mosley Braun Ford Dickhead Hardford and John Edwards from Carolina's baby. What is he from North Carolina?

[01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:14.220]
Yes, I don't know. He's got a small pair

[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:23.520]
The

[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:28.200]
Mojave David and the only thing funny other rape of it is that pipe smokers told the one hour

[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:35.800]
From what his depredations comes the cutest little errands you've ever seen

[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:39.740]
Arifat Abdullah Jerusalem and little Jericho

[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:48.100]
102 Palestinians this time the wicked Kurella Barak is trying to separate all the little Palestinians from their happy

[01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:54.000]
West Bay homes. It's one explosive situation after another with all those Palestinians

[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:59.280]
Scrambling for cover don't miss Walt Disney's newest animated feature

[01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:03.860]
102 Palestinians now showing in theaters everywhere

[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:10.120]
Provo to a 560 WQM happy Friday to you David Coren is one of my favorite people

[01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:11.560]
He writes

[01:31:12.140 --> 01:31:17.820]
Capital games in the nation and culture goes to the movies. That's an inverse calm capital games and colder goes to the movies

[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:19.580]
He says don't read this if you like and colder

[01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:23.100]
Don't read this if you want to believe and colder gets your facts straight

[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:30.020]
The other night I was enlisted to appear on MSNBC's hardball to discuss the controversy over the CBS miniseries on Ronald and Nancy Reagan

[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:36.940]
On the other side was culture the over the top and over the edge conservative author whose latest book literally brands all liberals is treasonous

[01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:44.700]
Conservatives and Republicans have howled at the Reagan movie was a travesty complaining at Portrae's Reagan as out of it in the White House and

[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.640]
Callis toward AIDS victims on the right

[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:51.760]
Noted that since the movie as far as I could tell does not detail how Reagan and cozy it up to the apartheid regime of South Africa

[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:55.720]
The murderous dictator of Chile and the death squad enabling government of El Salvador

[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:57.640]
It indeed has a problem with accuracy

[01:31:57.640 --> 01:32:05.320]
But the miniseries true sins seems to be its schlockiness the available clips may look like Donnesty meets mommy dearest set in the White House

[01:32:05.940 --> 01:32:11.260]
Colders started more restrained than usual though she predictably bashed Hollywood liberals for trying to undermine the historical standing of a

[01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:14.460]
Present they despised by resorting to trashy revisionism

[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:19.480]
Perhaps she even had a point who could tell what the producers were aiming at but then she jumped the tracks

[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:24.440]
She claimed that the movie patent was made by Hollywood lives with their hatred in their hearts for George S

[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:29.340]
Patten the brilliant but erratic W. W. Two general these filmmakers intended to make patent look terrible

[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:34.180]
She maintained but because they produced an accurate work the movie ended up making patent look great and people loved them

[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.700]
Was patent the left wing Hollywood conspiracy that backfired?

[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:42.100]
Host Chris Matthews immediately challenged her in his subtle fashion. You are dead wrong

[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.140]
He pushed her for proof and she replied

[01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:47.840]
That's why George C. Scott turned on his Academy Award for playing patent

[01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:53.960]
Culture was suggesting that Scott had spurned his Oscar because the filmmakers planted a discrepanied sentence image by portraying the general as

[01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.660]
Negatively as possible had gone awry

[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:02.220]
Matthews wasn't buying who told you that who told you that he shouted for oracle like response. It's well known

[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:06.420]
She added why do you think he turned on the award Chris? You never looked that up and never occurred to you

[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:12.660]
Matthews retorted because he said he wasn't going to a meat parade because he didn't believe in award ceremonies and Matthews was right

[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.520]
Following the show I took colders advice and I did look it up

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:25.080]
I found a 1999 obituary of Scott that noted he had shunned the a stun Hollywood in 1971 for being the first person ever to refuse an Academy Award

[01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:31.320]
He had explained his action by slamming such awards as demeaning and he dismissed the Oscar ceremony as a two-hour meat parade

[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:34.440]
Matthews received extra points for getting the quote correct

[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:40.860]
Colder had twisted as well documented episode and the more proof that liberals especially those in Hollywood are conspiratorial traders

[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:47.560]
After I described this exchange as someone who once worked with her he said that's and she lives in her own world and she just makes things up

[01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:51.820]
This interlude can turn to small matter who will be debating one of my favorite movies

[01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:57.380]
But this minor dust up provided evidence to support a serious charge is Matthews a mark while racking up the segment

[01:33:57.380 --> 01:34:01.100]
Thanks me nothing to you, Anne if so why continue to have her on and

[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:07.180]
It says on here. Don't forget about David Cords new book the Eliza George W. Bush, which I have in my hand right now

[01:34:07.660 --> 01:34:10.880]
Mastering the politics of the section by David Corn got it right here

[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:18.380]
See I got so many books. I got the Bush right the Molly Evans book. I got a read I got the Al Franken book. I got a pile man. I got piles

[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:21.240]
You read them all right. Oh, yeah

[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:28.320]
Maybe you can have that the fag in North Miami Beach read them to which one the one that sent the facts

[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:31.280]
Zola whoever that guys name it will join a reading club

[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:36.660]
Anyway, I just want to read it speaking that just a page or two from a David Corns books since I haven't read it yet

[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:39.300]
From the introduction, okay

[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:46.120]
Well first it starts by saying a false restoration some people think it's inappropriate to draw more a line not me for our children

[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:48.180]
Have the lives while lives we want for them

[01:34:48.180 --> 01:34:53.560]
They must learn to say yes to responsibility. Yes, honestly George W. Bush June 12, 1999

[01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:57.440]
George W. Bush is a liar. He's lied large and small

[01:34:57.440 --> 01:35:00.660]
He's lied directly and by a mission. He is misstated facts knowingly or not

[01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:07.000]
He is misled. He's broken promises been unpatable to political vows through his campaign for the presidency in his first years in a white house

[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.580]
He has mugged the truth not merely an honest error

[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:13.080]
But deliberately consistently and repeatedly to advance his career in his agenda

[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:17.860]
Lying greased his path toward the White House. It's the more the essential tools of his presidency

[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:24.500]
To call the 43rd president of the USA pervericators not an exercise of opinion not an inflammatory talk radio device

[01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:28.540]
This insult is supported by an ultimate extensive record of self-serving falsifications

[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:34.360]
So constantly is his pibbing that a history of his lies offers a close approximation of the history of his presidential tenure

[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.560]
And it goes on for how many pages it's a big book Wow

[01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:49.580]
320 pages so there you go go on buy it today at a bookstore nearby you the lies of George W. Bush mastery the politics of deception David Corn

[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:53.460]
All right

[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:59.580]
So far on the pool if Hillary Clinton ran for president which Democrat would you prefer howardine 105

[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.020]
Hillary Clinton 86 don't care on for Bush 46 12.3 percent

[01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:10.940]
Wesley Clark 45 don't give a crap 35 Al Sharpton 17 John Kerry 13

[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:26.560]
Well, I got some other stuff here first though union-owned investor offers loan to the marlins

[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:32.100]
And unexpected new player emerged yesterday and they ever to build a stadium for the marlins and that of course

[01:37:32.100 --> 01:37:36.420]
There's got to be our top priority building a stadium for the marlins. You do understand how important that is I do good

[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:39.920]
When the nation's largest union-owned life insurance company

[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.960]
Ulico ULLICO

[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.480]
Ulico announced his willing to loan more than a hundred and ten million dollars toward the plan

[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.960]
Ulico chairman Terry O'Sullivan hopes to discuss the offer with the team next week

[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:55.440]
He says the company will offer rates that could undercut conventional loans if the project creates a negotiated number of high-paying jobs

[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.980]
The catch the construction site would be union-only

[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:05.300]
This is money from union members and it should benefit union members O'Sullivan said the give back with this project is more than that

[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:09.780]
It's a chance to raise our statue in the community and to put labor up there with World Series champs

[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:15.440]
Whether the community while whether the company will get the chances unclear Marlins president David Samson

[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:19.140]
We all just know and love because he's such a funny guy

[01:38:20.260 --> 01:38:24.020]
Said late Thursday that he couldn't comment on the proposal because he hasn't been contacted

[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:30.620]
Miami Miami City managed your Joe Areola working on a financing plan with Dave County Commissioner George Burgers said Ulico suffered

[01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:33.140]
Loan the marlins money does little to bring the team closer to the stadium

[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:37.560]
We'd still have to pay for it Areola said well, maybe they could just like we're doing with Iraq

[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.420]
Just not alone just a gift right right why not so far

[01:38:43.420 --> 01:38:48.240]
Dave County has played 73 million the club is promised 137 million leaving a hundred and fifteen million dollar shortages

[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.900]
assuming you believe the three twenty five which is not correct leave it about a two hundred million dollar shortage

[01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:56.700]
The team is talking with Miami about a contribution may approach the state legislature as well

[01:38:56.700 --> 01:39:00.500]
Just give them a couple hundred million dollars. Okay, and stop belly. It can about it's important stuff

[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.780]
What's big enough important stuff? I was sexually abused by priest exile says

[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:11.640]
And art slices of Miami priest cleared of two past sexual abuse complaints faces a new claim that he molested a boat lift

[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:16.860]
Refugee at a Coral Gables church. Oh not in the Gables. Oh my God. That's sacrilegious, you know

[01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:24.880]
Isn't a human exile on Thursday accused of veteran Catholic priest of sexual abuse twenty three years ago at a Coral Gables church where he was living after

[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.940]
Arriving from Cuba on the Maryl boat lift

[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:28.960]
I do like that

[01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:35.840]
The alleged lawsuit the alleged victim rather said in the lawsuit the Reverend Alvaro Guixar we've had his name on many many times

[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.920]
Promise him a car in a job in a change for sex at the time

[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:41.800]
Guixar was a priest of the church of a little flower in Coral Gables

[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:47.080]
It's hard for me to talk about this. I've lived with this problem for many many years without telling my family or anybody

[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.180]
The alleged victim thirty nine said yesterday. It is a attorney's office in Hollywood

[01:39:50.180 --> 01:39:57.280]
We shard was reinstated in August as pastor Lee St. Francis the sale church in Miami Beach after the archdiocese of Miami cleared them of two earlier

[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.200]
Sex abuse complaints we should have been suspended for 15 months

[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.360]
We shard who has served as an archdiocese

[01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.360]
Archdiocese

[01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.340]
Sassen priest for a long time about 30 man 30 years

[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:13.160]
adamantly denied the allegations and interviewing his parish office its fiction false and lies we shard 63 said

[01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:16.140]
The new allegations are as ridiculous as the other ones

[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:20.160]
The alleged victim was not identified the lawsuit the suit was filed against the Miami Archdiocese

[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.060]
claiming it knew of the past sexual abuse claims against him and failed to take steps to protect the alleged victim

[01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:29.680]
The alleged victim said I want him we shard to be removed from the church and to be removed permanently

[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:34.680]
He said he never reported the alleged abuse to police or church authorities because he was a long young and afraid

[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:39.200]
The recent flurry of sex abuse complaints against numerous police convinced him to come forward

[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:44.420]
Ready for that so poor pop a guisher out there at the church of the little flower

[01:40:44.420 --> 01:40:51.940]
Don't forget folks the crazy people the religious people the craziest of them all even our chronic callers can't come and they're not in the same category with that

[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:52.600]
Wow, that's a shot

[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:58.980]
I want to take just one okay, because I understand why they're all called now that I threaten to play that thing

[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:00.720]
Here's Miami. Hello

[01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:02.780]
Neil how are you okay, sir?

[01:41:03.480 --> 01:41:09.020]
Well a couple things I think the Democrats chance in the next election are pretty

[01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:13.560]
Because the economy seems to be picking up again. I think you know with a good economy

[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:17.280]
You know the Democrats chances are like I said no

[01:41:17.900 --> 01:41:22.200]
Oh, the next thing I wanted to tell you are asked you is let me get to be sure

[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.780]
Do you heard of me with all of our troops from my last right now?

[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:30.520]
You know that is that that who is that that's one of the chronic chronic one of the most chronic

[01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:35.080]
I can't think who that voices a lot like Bob guy or something. Yeah, that was one of those old the crime

[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:39.680]
We know we're not that desperate pal. I'd rather play the a CBC thing and this crap about the Democrats chances slim

[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.500]
And I'm because the economy's picking up well, you know right now in the short for the markets going up

[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:47.860]
And we hit this big employment the number today and all this one. We'll see what happens in a year from now

[01:41:47.860 --> 01:41:53.360]
It's almost exactly everything's great negative now plus we'll see how many more dead people we got the how many more body bags

[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:56.140]
We got coming back. It's worth it always at it

[01:41:57.420 --> 01:42:04.200]

Gadgetcom I'm home my beginner. Oh hi Homer we're having chicken.

[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.940]
Or is it tuna? No. I don't get it. I'm a can sense chicken.

[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:33.400]
Oh, but it tastes like tuna. No the Jessica Simpsons. It's TV's first animated reality show with two dimensional Homer and one dimensional Jessica.

[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.180]
Perfect. Get it. Let's just order some popular wings.

[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:39.500]
Ew, Homer. I don't eat buffalo.

[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:44.180]
You'll be silly Jessica. Everybody knows popular wings are made from chicken.

[01:43:44.900 --> 01:43:47.000]
Oh, let's chicken of the sea.

[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:53.420]
Oh, the Jessica Simpsons because people this dumb could only be in cartoons.

[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:59.320]
Right? Yeah, we hope it's a 1218 at 560 WQAM.

[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:04.260]
One moment please I want to get this thing off the fax machine that I'm printing.

[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:05.980]
Okay.

[01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:11.720]
Uh, a main charge with entering a restricted area during an October 2002 presidential visit is subpoenaed

[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:16.840]
US Attorney General John Ascroft and Bush political adviser Carl Rove to testify this trial next week.

[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:22.520]
Oh, very good. Activist Brett Burcy 55 said yesterday the man's testimony would show that the Bush

[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:27.260]
administration tries to sanitize areas of the center round of prison during visits across the country.

[01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:32.080]
Assistant US Attorney John Barton was handling the case did not immediately return telephone call.

[01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:37.000]
What how spokesman Taylor Grohs said Rove had not been served with his subpoena and declined for their comment.

[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:38.440]
And Charles said for next Wednesday good.

[01:44:39.240 --> 01:44:41.020]
Good. Make their lives miserable. Okay.

[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.480]
Here's a facet from Tucker.

[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.540]
Chronic Tucker says his favorite movie that he watched over and over again would be The Big Lebowski.

[01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:48.760]
Would you keep telling me don't see it?

[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:50.840]
I didn't. I never saw it.

[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:53.780]
That was owner boy said that one said that you should see it.

[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:56.000]
Well, whatever. The Big Lebowski.

[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:00.820]
And if she'd just taken that blood rest of the dry cleaners we could have a word all that crap.

[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.200]
Save all of that cash.

[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:06.100]
Senate moves to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba.

[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:06.980]
Inclaible.

[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:14.400]
The Senate moved on several frontiers today to make it to make it easier for Americans to travel to and do business with Cuba.

[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.940]
Setting up a confrontation with the White House which says the president will veto any legislation

[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.940]
that weakens current US restrictions on such contacts.

[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:23.980]
Because he's busy pandering.

[01:45:24.780 --> 01:45:32.100]
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 13 to 5 in favor of legislation when the Cuba travel ban first imposed by President Kennedy in 1963.

[01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:37.260]
The legislation sponsored by a bipartisan group headed by Senator Mike Enzi, Republican and Wyoming,

[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.400]
would bar the president from restricting travel to Cuba except in the two countries that are at war.

[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.300]
Enzi also joined Senator Max Bocchus, Democrat of Montana, other Thursday,

[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:50.820]
energying House and Senate leaders to retain language easing the travel ban that both chambers included

[01:45:50.820 --> 01:45:55.780]
in a $90 billion bill to fund transportation and treasury department programs in the 2004 budget year.

[01:45:56.720 --> 01:46:01.740]
The White House has threatened to a threatened to presidential veto of the spending bill includes the Cuba language.

[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:07.320]
Given those negotiating it compromise the incentive to remove the provision before it goes back to the House and Senate for final vote.

[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:12.300]
But Enzi and Bocchus joined by senators Larry Craig Abide, a home-christ out of Connecticut said

[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:16.480]
removing the provision via a direct act against the will of Congress and a majority of Americans.

[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:23.200]
They wrote if the conference produced a conference report that excludes our amendment will consider all parliamentary options available to West

[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.900]
respond to that eventuality.

[01:46:26.020 --> 01:46:26.820]
Ready for that?

[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:32.080]
Yeah, but I'll present to you of course and his brother the too busy pandering we don't want to say to whom but

[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:32.880]
great, right?

[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:36.900]
Here's the big story of the day, the Moanaioa, you see this?

[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:37.560]
No, what?

[01:46:38.020 --> 01:46:40.180]
Truck loaded with hot dogs catches fire.

[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:46.540]
There was a giant weeny roast on interstate 380 but there was no mustard for many a mile marker.

[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:52.620]
A truck carrying 43,500 pounds of Oscar-Mire turkey hot dogs cut fired about 10 pm.

[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:57.380]
On Tuesday said Trooper Thomas Strada in a relation to Eric Turkey, the Iowa State Patrol.

[01:46:57.460 --> 01:46:59.660]
Now it says right in here, make sure you mention no relation to Eric.

[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.240]
Oh, yes.

[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:00.580]
Strada.

[01:47:01.660 --> 01:47:05.980]
Instead of the aroma of roasting meat troopers and firefighters had to endure black smoke and the

[01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:07.560]
accurate smell of burning rubber.

[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:12.020]
Some type of mechanical problem caused the wheel overheat to strut us so the driver pulled over

[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:16.240]
open the refrigerator power unit that exposed hot oil to the ear and helped ignite the fire.

[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:20.300]
The truck driver was an injured northbound lanes at the interstate near the small town of

[01:47:20.450 --> 01:47:24.650]
Banna, Iowa, which is between Sutter Rapids and Waterloo closed for about three hours while the

[01:47:24.650 --> 01:47:26.250]
were weasting their ronies.

[01:47:27.570 --> 01:47:30.870]
Speaking of that, I don't know if I'm going to play that thing or not, you know.

[01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:32.150]
Okay.

[01:47:32.710 --> 01:47:34.730]
Well, no, because I got a lot of stuff here, I guess I will.

[01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:35.890]
I'll get around to it.

[01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:40.630]
Because I did mention this story the other day and it's worth talking about.

[01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:44.410]
Students sue overvoting vulnerability since we're going to have probably another fixed

[01:47:44.410 --> 01:47:45.130]
election next year.

[01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:49.430]
Two students from Swarthmore College have filed suit against one of the nations.

[01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:53.710]
You know, you listen to the voice like that guy said it was a chronic difficulty minutes ago.

[01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:54.530]
You listen to the voices.

[01:47:55.090 --> 01:47:56.610]
These are the brainwashed.

[01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:57.550]
There's no dealing.

[01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:00.310]
You'll never penetrate because they're like it's like the religious fanatics which

[01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:02.670]
there's the overlap there most of them are in that category too.

[01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.130]
There's no getting through it's like they're mesmerized.

[01:48:05.250 --> 01:48:08.010]
You look at them and they have the deep, you know, the the sunken eyes.

[01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:11.750]
Haven't I always told you that about call a illusion of religiousness?

[01:48:12.130 --> 01:48:15.490]
They all have that look that kind of far away look like they're automatonized.

[01:48:15.490 --> 01:48:16.030]
Glazed nuts.

[01:48:16.610 --> 01:48:16.970]
Exactly.

[01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:22.210]
Two students from Swarthmore College have filed suit against one of the nation's largest

[01:48:22.210 --> 01:48:26.390]
makers of electronic voting machines alleging that die-bold ink had to be used copyright

[01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:30.530]
laws to keep information from the public that is crucial to the health of America's democracy.

[01:48:31.050 --> 01:48:35.650]
The students use the internet to post die-bold internal memos and emails saying the

[01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:39.150]
document show the company knew its voting machines were vulnerable to tampering and that it

[01:48:39.150 --> 01:48:40.870]
knowingly violated election laws.

[01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:46.070]
Die-bold issued cease and desist letters to Swarthmore the student service provider claiming

[01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:48.750]
emails are protected under the copyright laws.

[01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:52.810]
Though Swarthmore shut down the student's network connections until they had removed

[01:48:52.810 --> 01:48:56.590]
the disputed material, other students across the country including three at Princeton

[01:48:56.590 --> 01:49:00.050]
have begun to post or mirror this information on their university websites

[01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:02.430]
in what some call an active civil disobedience.

[01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:04.450]
Yeah, that's a good size about time.

[01:49:04.630 --> 01:49:04.830]
All right.

[01:49:06.710 --> 01:49:10.890]
The legal system is being used as a tool of corporations in a sense people like

[01:49:10.890 --> 01:49:12.490]
die-bold just want to protect their own interests.

[01:49:12.490 --> 01:49:16.730]
Brian Cattle said regarding his decision to mirror the company's emails.

[01:49:17.210 --> 01:49:20.130]
Something like that needs to be seen especially for a company that's carrying the

[01:49:20.130 --> 01:49:23.870]
torts of American democracy by providing facilities for elections in vote counting.

[01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:27.710]
The Princeton students at the university hasn't yet asked to remove the information from

[01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.190]
their websites.

[01:49:28.610 --> 01:49:30.250]
University Law is unavailable for comment.

[01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:34.690]
The groups are suing for the right to post the leaked memos under the fair use clause

[01:49:34.690 --> 01:49:38.490]
of the Copy Red Act which allows copyrighted material to be used in news reporting and for

[01:49:38.490 --> 01:49:40.330]
the purpose of criticism or comment.

[01:49:42.490 --> 01:49:43.310]
How do you like that?

[01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:44.210]
I like it.

[01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:45.190]
You go boys.

[01:49:45.650 --> 01:49:46.290]
You go boys.

[01:49:46.570 --> 01:49:48.490]
Little civil disobedience on a college campus.

[01:49:48.690 --> 01:49:50.870]
Although I notice nothing's happened and can't state no more because

[01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:52.050]
they're in the hardware.

[01:49:52.450 --> 01:49:53.070]
They won't do that again.

[01:49:53.310 --> 01:49:54.990]
They learned they're not going to be doing that no more.

[01:49:56.070 --> 01:50:00.170]
Flapp over Ride Home leads to stabbing and suicide attempt in pompados is the BS.

[01:50:01.410 --> 01:50:02.550]
Another great story.

[01:50:03.170 --> 01:50:06.650]
An apparent disagreement over a ride home from work ended yesterday with the

[01:50:06.650 --> 01:50:11.270]
attempted murder of one fish company employee and the attempted suicide of a second deputy said.

[01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:15.350]
The incident took place around 6.30 yesterday morning at the Great American

[01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:19.510]
smoked fish company according to BSO spokeswoman Vita Coleman Wright.

[01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:21.610]
Here's what Coleman Wright said happened.

[01:50:22.530 --> 01:50:26.570]
As Claude at Elise 45 of Miami walked out of the restroom she was confronted by co-worker

[01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:29.070]
Fernand Thaluzma 49 also of Miami.

[01:50:29.690 --> 01:50:32.530]
He stabbed her in the head so violently that the blatant of the knife broke off.

[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:37.230]
Thaluzma fled to a bathroom with what was left of the knife and barricaded himself inside.

[01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:41.030]
When pompado beach fire rescue workers arrived they rendered aid to Elise while

[01:50:41.030 --> 01:50:44.310]
deputies confronted and secured Thaluzma who had stabbed himself in the chest.

[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:47.390]
Both were transported north brow medical center for surgery.

[01:50:48.110 --> 01:50:51.670]
According to the owner of the company Thaluzma was upset because at least did not give

[01:50:51.670 --> 01:50:53.870]
him a ride home from work last Friday October 31.

[01:50:55.810 --> 01:50:56.330]
Oh well.

[01:50:56.430 --> 01:51:00.350]
Tectives believed Thaluzma got the large filet knife used in the stabbing said work.

[01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:04.470]
Well I guess when you work for a fish place yeah a lot of when Thaluzma's released from

[01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:08.830]
the hospital be taken to the BS main jail on a charge of attempted murders.

[01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:13.630]
The law is a sports waiting device.

[01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:15.490]
You way up.

[01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:19.610]
Friday you blasted.

[01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:28.130]
You know to truly understand what happened on September 11 and the close relationship

[01:51:28.130 --> 01:51:29.030]
between the bushes.

[01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:31.970]
There been lot and the rest of the Saudi elite.

[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:38.710]
You have to go back about 25 years and so the couple of thousand kilometers to Houston,

[01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:45.630]
Texas, where in the mid 1970s George W Bush was a young man just trying to learn the ropes in

[01:51:45.630 --> 01:51:49.690]
his family's two businesses politics and oil.

[01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:55.770]
The bushes were a pillar of Houston society.

[01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:59.250]
George seniors struck a rich in oil became a congressman,

[01:51:59.430 --> 01:52:04.070]
then director of the Central Intelligence Agency, where it said he first won the friendship

[01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:08.730]
of the Saudi royal family by arranging CIA training for their palace guards.

[01:52:10.030 --> 01:52:13.630]
And George Jr. was trying to follow in his father's footsteps.

[01:52:14.250 --> 01:52:18.550]
A Harvard business grad he dabbled in politics and the Texas Air National Guard.

[01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:24.990]
And it was about the same time that a man named Bill White, a former fighter pilot with a Harvard

[01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:30.290]
MBA himself, was recruited to work in Houston with someone with business and personal connections

[01:52:30.290 --> 01:52:34.030]
to both George Bush's. His name was Jim Bath.

[01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:39.350]
The Straylor James R. Bath needed someone to run a series of real estate companies that would be

[01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:45.730]
grubbed stake by not only the political families but also by some foreign national societies.

[01:52:46.150 --> 01:52:48.790]
And so I came down on an interview and met Jim.

[01:52:49.170 --> 01:52:54.570]
They opened an office in downtown Houston where Bill White became Jim Bath's partner and confident.

[01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:59.150]
But White says Bath's been most of his time dealing with his foreign partners,

[01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:02.690]
a wealthy Saudi family, the Bin Laden's.

[01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:09.050]
He also ran a company in the same building called Bin Laden and Associates which Jim explained

[01:53:09.050 --> 01:53:14.610]
was a procurement company for the Saudis. He bought a bank for them. He bought an airport for them.

[01:53:14.670 --> 01:53:18.830]
He started an airline for them among other ventures in Houston, Texas.

[01:53:19.450 --> 01:53:21.930]
Now at that point, had you ever heard the name Bin Laden?

[01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:24.410]
No, I hadn't. Nothing to you. Nothing to me.

[01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:32.270]
But in Saudi Arabia, the Bin Laden's name had a great deal indeed.

[01:53:32.890 --> 01:53:35.590]
They owned one of the largest Saudi construction companies.

[01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:41.070]
They were advisors to the Royal Family. They were the second richest family next to the Royal's

[01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:46.470]
with billions of dollars to invest abroad in places like Houston with a Bush family.

[01:53:48.010 --> 01:53:51.610]
They moved into this estate in one of Houston's finest neighborhoods.

[01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:57.450]
Have Bin Laden brother named Solomon and a brother-in-law, Khaled Bin Mfouz.

[01:53:58.130 --> 01:54:01.250]
Mfouz was also one of the Saudi Royal family's bankers.

[01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:07.770]
So is it fair to say that when the Bin Laden group establishes an office in Houston,

[01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:11.090]
the presence of the Bush family at that point had a lot to do with it?

[01:54:11.650 --> 01:54:15.230]
Absolutely. I think that was essential. The essential element. I don't think any of those

[01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:18.670]
dollars would have come into the United States or any of those assets been purchased.

[01:54:19.390 --> 01:54:23.450]
Had not there been this quid pro quo relationship with the Bush family.

[01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:29.350]
While the Bin Laden's built their ties to Texas, back home in Saudi Arabia,

[01:54:29.370 --> 01:54:36.330]
they were making another kind of foreign investment. In 1979, the Soviet Union occupied Afghanistan.

[01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:42.090]
The Saudi Royal family wanted to build a Muslim army known as the Muhazidine to defend this

[01:54:42.090 --> 01:54:47.030]
law and force the Russians out. They turned to their trusted advisors, the Bin Laden's,

[01:54:47.410 --> 01:54:50.350]
who offered up a likey-21 year old named Asama.

[01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:56.730]
The man who personally chose Asama Bin Laden to build that army would also become his mentor,

[01:54:57.250 --> 01:55:03.110]
Saudi Prince Tripiel Faisal. Last year on British television, he reminisced about the young Bin Laden.

[01:55:03.610 --> 01:55:11.110]
In those days, he was a young man who had committed himself to helping the Afghan Mujahidine.

[01:55:12.710 --> 01:55:16.350]
Liberate themselves from the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

[01:55:17.550 --> 01:55:23.730]
And he was doing a lot of good. He was bringing support and aid to the Mujahidine.

[01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:28.210]
Meanwhile back in Houston, the Bush family was also on the move.

[01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:34.270]
George Sr. was about to become vice president and his son made a career decision too.

[01:55:35.190 --> 01:55:39.330]
By the late 70s, George W. Bush was setting out on his own.

[01:55:39.970 --> 01:55:46.730]
He established an oil exploration company that he called our booster, a Spanish word that loosely

[01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:53.190]
translated means Bush. But before our booster could find oil, it needed to find some money,

[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:58.210]
operating capital. And apparently George Bush, you were to look.

[01:55:58.770 --> 01:56:05.350]
The bath had told me that he had used Saudi money to fund George Bush Jr.'s for into the energy

[01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:07.730]
business. This is the Arbusto Corporation.

[01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:09.370]
The Arbusto Partnerships.

[01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:15.030]
As Bath's partner, Bill Whites has yet accessed information about the financial

[01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:20.650]
dealings between the Bin Laden family and George W. Bush. He later obtained Bath's personal

[01:56:20.650 --> 01:56:24.730]
financial statements when the two had a falling out and became involved in litigation.

[01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:29.650]
On schedules that show his partnership interest, he shows a personal partnership

[01:56:29.650 --> 01:56:38.610]
interest of $25,000 invested in Arbusto 79 and another $25,000 investment in Bush 80.

[01:56:39.230 --> 01:56:44.170]
But according to White, that share was only Bath's commission for investing the Bin Laden's

[01:56:44.170 --> 01:56:49.930]
money with Bush. Do you have any knowledge of how much money the Saudis put in?

[01:56:50.290 --> 01:56:52.810]
Well, he told me it was an excess of $1,000,000.

[01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:58.610]
So there's no question in your mind whatsoever that whatever went into George W. Bush's

[01:56:58.610 --> 01:57:02.930]
companies from Jim Bath was more than 100 percent of the Saudi money.

[01:57:03.230 --> 01:57:04.790]
And George W. Bush would have been aware of it?

[01:57:04.970 --> 01:57:11.230]
Absolutely. But that was at all a few years later another oil company in which George W. Bush

[01:57:11.230 --> 01:57:18.370]
was involved needed cash. It got a reported $25 million. Again, thanks in part to Bush's

[01:57:18.370 --> 01:57:23.130]
old Houston neighbor, Khalid bin Mufous, a son of Bin Laden's brother-in-law.

[01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:26.890]
And it wasn't only George Bush the son who benefited.

[01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:32.070]
The Bin Laden's did business with the Houston bank where George Bush's senior was on the board.

[01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:34.390]
What time is it?

[01:57:34.630 --> 01:57:37.510]
The quick time. This is the non-political part of this.

[01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:41.950]
And businessman Bill White says whether Bush senior knew it or not,

[01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:46.890]
the Bin Laden's were also generous with him when he ran for president in 1988,

[01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:51.810]
allegedly finding a way around the U.S. ban on foreign campaign contributions.

[01:57:53.130 --> 01:57:57.630]
My understanding from Bath was that they were making campaign contributions by taking

[01:57:58.130 --> 01:58:02.590]
briefcases full of cash to the law firms. They would give the cash to the lawyers and each of the

[01:58:02.590 --> 01:58:06.690]
lawyers in turn would make a $1,000 campaign contribution to Bush.

[01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:09.290]
Which would presumably be against electoral law?

[01:58:09.490 --> 01:58:15.270]
Well, it is against the law, but it's obviously covered by virtue of the attorneys making the

[01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.850]
contributions.

[01:58:16.750 --> 01:58:21.790]
And when George Bush senior became president, as with George W. more than a decade later,

[01:58:21.790 --> 01:58:27.490]
the Saudis occupied a special place at the White House. The oval office always opened to one man.

[01:58:28.110 --> 01:58:30.390]
Saudi Arabia's ambassador, Prince Bondar.

[01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:35.650]
He's got instant access. He calls him up since I'm coming over. He's got instant access to the

[01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:42.230]
CIA anybody he wants. He can summon people. He can call anybody up at home at any time,

[01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:48.850]
which most ambassadors in Washington cannot do. Robert Baer served with the CIA for 21 years and

[01:58:48.850 --> 01:58:50.670]
spent much of that time in the Middle East.

[01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:54.270]
What is the George W. Bush calls Bondar Bush?

[01:58:54.590 --> 01:58:56.230]
Bondar Bush. It calls Bondar Bush.

[01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:59.250]
You know, it's fine. Bondar is a great ambassador.

[01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:04.170]
It works great until you turn a blind eye, until you believe everything Bondar says.

[01:59:04.890 --> 01:59:09.890]
Baer believes that Bondar's position is symptomatic of the blind self-interest on both sides.

[01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:13.170]
That's the Saudi-American relationship's fatal flaw.

[01:59:15.110 --> 01:59:20.670]
As you'll see when we come back, it's a lesson George W. Bush and his administration wouldn't learn

[01:59:20.670 --> 01:59:22.570]
until it was much too late.

[01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:29.730]
Had Saudi Arabia been acting as one might expect a true ally and friend to act,

[01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:35.410]
could they have told the US all they needed to know about the real threat posed by them on?

[01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:41.410]
They knew everything. They were the source of findings that went to to buy arms, to buy bombs,

[01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:46.430]
through their charities and those charities in Saudi Arabia are all controlled by the government

[01:59:46.910 --> 01:59:48.750]
to some extent. Absolutely.

[01:59:49.590 --> 01:59:52.050]
Okay, 22 to 1. So you didn't think I would play it again, did you?

[01:59:52.090 --> 01:59:56.650]
I'd like to do it. Well, I did. And I'm playing it from CBC from Tuesday night,

[01:59:57.570 --> 02:00:01.870]
from the 5th of state. 438 votes. I think we can change the poll now, don't you?

[02:00:02.010 --> 02:00:05.570]
Okay, Eric. I think we can put the other poll on there, because now the Bushes are starting to

[02:00:05.570 --> 02:00:09.810]
load up on here multiple times. There's no question. If Hillary Clinton ran for president,

[02:00:09.810 --> 02:00:15.810]
which Democrat would you prefer, how are Dean 123? Hillary Clinton 103. Don't care

[02:00:15.810 --> 02:00:20.750]
on per Bush 58 13.1% and a mysterious like whole of Russia, those, what do you say,

[02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:24.130]
rush? Well, and they got to have something new because Russia's still in rehab.

[02:00:24.990 --> 02:00:31.530]
Why is Clark 52? Don't give a crap 42 42 great Americans. Al Sharpton 40 John Kerry 13.

[02:00:31.950 --> 02:00:36.450]
Then it's considered for that lovely here 12 Carol, mostly brown five that came hard five.

[02:00:36.450 --> 02:00:40.650]
John Lieberman five and John Edwards is still stuck with a little pair out of 140 vote.

[02:00:40.810 --> 02:00:43.790]
So we'll change the poll put the other one on there. Even though we don't have a whole lot.

[02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:46.850]
That's okay. We haven't. I need a whole bunch of them. You know, I heard that.

[02:00:46.930 --> 02:00:51.130]
The name of the thing I heard that spot. Because I've been forgetting to mention about

[02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:55.070]
Farrell eight and half auto parts. Now till two o'clock this afternoon 19 11 North

[02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:59.630]
State Road seven and Margate. He's got our best and eel stuff, our CDs and the Mohawar

[02:00:59.630 --> 02:01:06.250]
David of Keychains. And he'll probably be there too. Jesus, that is not Mo 80 bucks. And what is it?

[02:01:06.250 --> 02:01:11.330]
80 bucks. Well, there you go. That's something. I mean, this isn't one of our, you know,

[02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:13.830]
specific appearances. We can raise a couple under bucks out there today.

[02:01:14.370 --> 02:01:17.830]
Anyway, you can spend the wheel to win t-shirts and tickets to the nice Panther game against the

[02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:20.710]
Pittsburgh Penguins, which looks like Mario May plays.

[02:01:41.070 --> 02:01:46.710]
1991. The Gulf War was over. American troops had defended Saudi oil fields against

[02:01:46.710 --> 02:01:53.050]
Saddam Hussein. Now the U.S. could continue to enjoy the economic security, which came with all

[02:01:53.050 --> 02:02:00.830]
outside of the oil. It was essentially the same deal. George W. Bush himself made when he did

[02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:06.930]
business with the Bin Laden's in Houston. One side got a powerful partner, the other oil and

[02:02:06.930 --> 02:02:15.190]
money, former CIA agent Robert Baer. The United States depends upon Saudi Arabia for its oil

[02:02:15.190 --> 02:02:22.130]
production. Saudi Arabia also recycles all the money it makes off oil in the United States.

[02:02:22.530 --> 02:02:27.190]
It puts trillions of dollars in our banks. It pays for presidential libraries.

[02:02:28.290 --> 02:02:33.790]
Anything you could imagine. And the Clinton White House wasn't immune to Saudi charm either.

[02:02:34.410 --> 02:02:38.930]
It was difficult not to give the benefit of the doubt to the biggest buyer of American military

[02:02:38.930 --> 02:02:44.750]
hardware with the deepest pockets in the stock market. Not to mention the world's largest oil

[02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:52.350]
reserves. Which is why after George Bush senior left office and became a senior advisor to the

[02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:58.530]
powerful international investment firm, the Carlisle Group. He paid a number of visits on

[02:02:58.530 --> 02:03:09.910]
their behalf to his good friend, the Saudi royal family, and the Bin Laden. They soon became Carlisle

[02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:17.510]
Klein. Incredible. On September 11th Bush and the head of the Bin Laden family would be at the

[02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:22.510]
same Carlisle Group meeting in Washington just a few miles from where some of Bin Laden's

[02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:30.290]
high jackass would attack the Pentagon. As the 90s unfolded there was much the US administration

[02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:38.010]
didn't know about Bin Laden who was about to become America's nightmare. Because he saw the

[02:03:38.010 --> 02:03:42.570]
presence of US troops on the holy sands of Saudi Arabia as a sacrifice.

[02:03:44.550 --> 02:03:50.190]
Osama Bin Laden was an ally of the United States through the 80s. He was killing so

[02:03:50.190 --> 02:03:56.650]
many soldiers. That's what we wanted. Now what happened later on in the 90s is the Saudis who

[02:03:56.650 --> 02:04:02.790]
certainly had good intelligence on Bin Laden. We're not telling us that Bin Laden had chosen a new

[02:04:02.790 --> 02:04:08.290]
enemy and that was the United States. And the Saudis left something else out, something that

[02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:14.430]
tried to hide to this day, that they kept paying Osama Bin Laden after his war with the

[02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:18.170]
Soviet ended and his terror campaign against the US began.

[02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:25.810]
The man who has uncovered the proof of that is Jean-Charles Bussard.

[02:04:26.250 --> 02:04:31.730]
He investigated al-Qaeda's finances for the French intelligence service well before 9-11

[02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:35.690]
and he's been following the relationship between Bin Laden and Saudi Arabia,

[02:04:35.690 --> 02:04:39.170]
especially with his men or Prince Turkey ever since.

[02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:26.250]
The Saudis deny it ever happened. But according to investigators Jean-Charles Bussard,

[02:05:26.510 --> 02:05:32.250]
French intelligence reports confirm that a meeting did indeed take place in Paris in 1996.

[02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:38.450]
As Sama Bin Laden himself didn't come but a senior representative did, also in attendance,

[02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:45.050]
Bin Laden's old mentors, Saudi Prince Turkey, have been Laden family member and a number of bankers.

[02:05:45.630 --> 02:05:52.930]
The result? The Saudis promised to keep paying Bin Laden as long as he promised to keep ignoring them.

[02:05:53.770 --> 02:05:58.270]
According to Bussard, one of the who came to this power so tell for that meeting was none other

[02:05:58.270 --> 02:06:03.670]
than Bin Laden's brother-in-law, till it had been refused. The same man who once financially supported

[02:06:03.670 --> 02:06:10.890]
George W. Bush, now negotiating payoffs to Sama Bin Laden. And support came from the Bin Laden

[02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:17.270]
family as well. They publicly proclaimed they had his own Sama but privately resiled. They said

[02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:23.570]
I'm equipped and money. The company like Saudi Bin Laden Group is providing all the tools to

[02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:29.390]
Sama Bin Laden to build a road or an airport and Sudan. Yes, they're fully financial back years

[02:06:29.390 --> 02:06:35.990]
of Sama Bin Laden. So how much in all did the Saudis contribute to Al Qaeda estimates are that

[02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:43.390]
before 9-11 Bin Laden spent about 50 million U.S. dollars a year, the vast majority of from Saudi Arabia.

[02:06:44.530 --> 02:06:49.890]
What exactly is that? That's one of the documents that were recently seized by our team and

[02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:57.110]
from Bosnia to Sudan and Afghanistan. Fashar Bressar has discovered an Al Qaeda paper trail

[02:06:57.110 --> 02:07:03.570]
that he says proves what the Saudis are still denying. This leads you to believe it's $2 million

[02:07:03.570 --> 02:07:11.770]
which originates where? Oh, it stated that it originates from the head that's provided by Saudi

[02:07:11.770 --> 02:07:21.230]
Bin Laden. Millions in Saudi foreign aid diverted to Al Qaeda. Financial support for terrorist

[02:07:21.230 --> 02:07:26.910]
training camps in Afghanistan like this one. Camps run with money, funneled through a Saudi

[02:07:26.910 --> 02:07:34.070]
chair funded, managed and supervised by royal family members. They knew everything. There were

[02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:40.230]
the source of findings that went to buy arms, to buy bombs through their charities and those

[02:07:40.230 --> 02:07:46.770]
charities in Saudi Arabia are all controlled by government to some extent. Knowing the way he felt

[02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:55.150]
about the U.S. Knowing he had declared war essentially on all of the Americans. Would they not

[02:07:55.150 --> 02:07:59.830]
also have known that by giving him money they were funding ultimately attacks against the U.S.?

[02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:03.450]
Don't you think that the interests of Saudi Arabia from its perspective is more important than

[02:08:03.450 --> 02:08:08.190]
the U.S. interest of the U.S.? That's what we experience that's what we've seen in the past.

[02:08:11.250 --> 02:08:15.910]
Not only did the Saudis not want to tell the Americans about their deal with Bin Laden,

[02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:22.090]
it seems the U.S. didn't want to hear, despite the decades increasing terror attacks against Americans

[02:08:22.090 --> 02:08:33.210]
abroad. 1995, a bomb in Saudi Arabia kills five U.S. soldiers. 1996, 19 Americans

[02:08:33.210 --> 02:08:37.990]
servicemen die in another Saudi bombing, and the U.S. military's co-barch hours barrage.

[02:08:41.450 --> 02:08:47.090]
1998, more than 200 perished when truck bombs devastate two U.S. embassies in Africa.

[02:08:48.750 --> 02:08:54.430]
2000, an explosion tears apart the U.S. S. coal, 17 American sailors are killed.

[02:08:55.970 --> 02:09:00.330]
Though a sum of Bin Laden was obviously responsible for the majority of those deaths,

[02:09:00.890 --> 02:09:05.470]
U.S. intelligence effectively ignored the plagues that was his recruitment hotbed.

[02:09:06.250 --> 02:09:10.190]
The U.S. attitude remained here, see, and speak no evil.

[02:09:11.650 --> 02:09:19.130]
Even though there had been the bombings in 95, 96, 98, 2000, all involving Saudis,

[02:09:19.590 --> 02:09:24.370]
no one asked for a national intelligence estimate if Saudi Arabia is not in a terrorist state.

[02:09:24.370 --> 02:09:32.490]
Is it fair to say financial and political interests in one way or other led to 9-11

[02:09:33.790 --> 02:09:41.370]
Afghanistan and Iraq? Absolutely. Financial interests were predominant in Washington.

[02:09:41.970 --> 02:09:46.350]
They led to a turning blind eye to what was happening in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan

[02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:53.330]
and contributed to 9-11. But it doesn't have to be a conspiracy. This is where

[02:09:54.050 --> 02:09:59.390]
people will nail you if you say it's a conspiracy. It's nice it gets a conspiracy as silence.

[02:09:59.910 --> 02:10:05.290]
We're just not going to talk about it. When we come back, what they still don't want to talk about,

[02:10:05.770 --> 02:10:10.970]
how American law enforcement might have discovered and disrupted the 9-11 attacks.

[02:10:11.710 --> 02:10:17.750]
The agent in San Diego testified to you that he believes if he had known he could have stopped

[02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:21.950]
he believes he would have, no one can ever say for sure we would have stopped it,

[02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:24.150]
but he believes he would have had a very good chance.

[02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:30.510]
253 at 560 WDQM, this thing is timing off pretty good, you know.

[02:10:30.590 --> 02:10:33.210]
Excellent. We're going to have just great because the poll today, I mean,

[02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:36.830]
the second poll, they're just not all that crazy about it. And I mean, these women are not that crazy

[02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:39.050]
about the poll, you might as well just, you know, jam it.

[02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:51.470]
I all my favorite Republicans, this is Matt Drudge.

[02:10:51.850 --> 02:10:58.750]
At its time, for the first, excuse me, I'm floating. It's time once again for the Neil Rogers power.

[02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:04.630]
Her minutes after the September 11th attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon,

[02:11:05.250 --> 02:11:10.150]
the Federal Aviation Administration ordered the grounding of all civilian air traffic in the US.

[02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:14.650]
Travelers were stranded across the country and around the world.

[02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:24.610]
48 hours later, September 13th, an update. Private flights were still prohibited to take off

[02:11:24.610 --> 02:11:27.150]
required government approval at the highest level.

[02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:33.290]
That morning, Prince Banderer of Saudi Arabia visited the White House.

[02:11:34.010 --> 02:11:39.370]
And later that afternoon, something unusual began to happen. Despite the blanket aviation

[02:11:39.370 --> 02:11:46.030]
ban, several private planes from Lear Gets to a 747 were cleared to the part from various US

[02:11:46.030 --> 02:11:51.310]
cities. On board were dozens of the Saudi elite, almost every one of them.

[02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:52.810]
Lawton or Saudi Roy?

[02:11:54.910 --> 02:11:59.370]
Meanwhile, Elizabeth Alderman was desperate to find a way from Paris to New York,

[02:11:59.650 --> 02:12:01.230]
where her son Peter was missing.

[02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:04.650]
Because Lawton family, whoever was in the United States,

[02:12:05.090 --> 02:12:11.430]
got safe passage home. And I couldn't get home to be with my children.

[02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:19.130]
Other families couldn't get to New York who lived far away to even begin to look for their children.

[02:12:19.190 --> 02:12:24.010]
At this point, we didn't know who was alive or who was dead. I couldn't get home and have been

[02:12:24.010 --> 02:12:26.510]
Lawton family who were all able to get home.

[02:12:27.970 --> 02:12:33.010]
To this day, the Bush administration has not even confirmed the existence of those flights

[02:12:33.010 --> 02:12:38.110]
to Saudi Arabia. Those Saudi diplomatic sources have been quoted as saying approval for them was

[02:12:38.110 --> 02:12:44.070]
granted at the highest level. But the Exodus to Saudi Arabia happened at all is one thing.

[02:12:44.710 --> 02:12:48.550]
But then there was the investigation that took place before the Saudis departed.

[02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:55.270]
It seems there was none. The biggest crime in American history, orchestrated by a son of

[02:12:55.270 --> 02:13:01.250]
Ben Laden, with funds from the Ben Laden and Saudi royal families, plain loads of whom were given

[02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:06.930]
special dispensation to leave the US almost immediately afterwards, essentially with no interviews

[02:13:06.930 --> 02:13:14.350]
to determine what they might know. No, they just got to laugh. The FBI is not been allowed to put

[02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:21.610]
Saudis on a terrorism list up until September 11th. They were not allowed to ask these people any

[02:13:21.610 --> 02:13:31.730]
questions. The President of the United States, the next week, George W. Bush finally threw down

[02:13:31.730 --> 02:13:41.050]
the gauntlet on global terror, or so it seemed. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make.

[02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:46.270]
Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.

[02:13:55.170 --> 02:13:59.830]
By then, the Bush administration knew that despite years of Saudi reassurance,

[02:13:59.830 --> 02:14:06.770]
15 of the 19 hijackers had been Saudi nationals. So in the terrible aftermath of September 11th,

[02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:11.830]
surely it was now time to track down those who provided money and support for 9-11 wherever

[02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:18.190]
they might be, right? Wrong again, according to former CIA insider Robert Baer.

[02:14:18.690 --> 02:14:25.850]
When George W. Bush says, terrorists, those who harbor them, those who give support to them

[02:14:26.490 --> 02:14:33.630]
are our enemies. That's obviously not true because everybody that financed September 11th is

[02:14:33.630 --> 02:14:39.270]
currently in Saudi Arabia and free. And it would sort of like have been lawden and said,

[02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:42.450]
well, you know, it's just a coincidence my guys happened to run into your towers.

[02:14:42.890 --> 02:14:44.230]
Are we just going to leave him alone?

[02:14:45.690 --> 02:14:50.230]
In the past two years, the U.S. has relentlessly prosecuted its war on terror,

[02:14:50.850 --> 02:14:54.850]
first invading Afghanistan, which unquestionably harbored and supported al-Qaeda.

[02:14:55.490 --> 02:14:59.130]
Then occupying Iraq, which had virtually nothing to do with the Somaban Line.

[02:14:59.810 --> 02:15:04.490]
But despite all their with us are against this rhetoric, the U.S. has given Saudi Arabia,

[02:15:04.810 --> 02:15:09.870]
which spawned the mastermind, the manpower, and the money for 9-11, a free pass.

[02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:17.030]
The CIA, for example, ignored intelligence about the hijackers gathered by a number of foreign

[02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:23.150]
countries before and after September 11th. The Fifth Estate has obtained documents like these

[02:15:23.150 --> 02:15:30.050]
phone records from German intelligence showing calls made by key members of the 9-11 plot to Saudi Arabia.

[02:15:30.650 --> 02:15:32.910]
But the Americans chose not to pursue.

[02:15:35.210 --> 02:15:40.910]
And nowhere was that attitude more obvious than in the report of the Congressional investigation

[02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:42.650]
in the September 11th attacks.

[02:15:45.150 --> 02:15:49.270]
The community made mistakes prior to September 11th.

[02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:53.290]
The hearings on Capitol Hill began several months after 9-11.

[02:15:53.450 --> 02:15:53.670]
The hearings on Capitol Hill began several months after 9-11.

[02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.630]
They were to be the definitive inquiry into what happened and why,

[02:15:58.710 --> 02:16:02.250]
focusing on what U.S. intelligence agencies knew or should have known.

[02:16:02.710 --> 02:16:05.030]
Eleanor Hill was the committee's chief investigator.

[02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:13.150]
In the fall of 1998, the intelligence community received information concerning a bin Laden

[02:16:13.150 --> 02:16:15.610]
plot involving aircraft.

[02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:20.830]
The much-anticipated report was more than 800 pages long.

[02:16:21.530 --> 02:16:26.270]
But since it was released this past summer, most of the attention has focused on 28 of those

[02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:32.290]
pages, one chapter that is almost completely redacted, ordered classified by the White House

[02:16:32.290 --> 02:16:33.930]
and blacked out to the public.

[02:16:34.390 --> 02:16:38.270]
And because they're classified, I can't tell you what's in those pages.

[02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:46.070]
I can tell you that the chapter deals with information that our committees found in FBI

[02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:50.250]
and CIA files that was very disturbing.

[02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:56.710]
It had to do with sources of foreign support for the hijackers or alleged sources of foreign

[02:16:56.710 --> 02:16:58.010]
support for the hijackers.

[02:16:58.250 --> 02:17:03.950]
Yeah. Now, I know it has believed and has been reported that many of those 27 or 28 redacted

[02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:07.570]
pages deal with the Saudi relationship to the hijackers, but...

[02:17:07.570 --> 02:17:09.510]
That's what the press has said. I haven't said that.

[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:16.490]
In fact, others familiar with those 28 blacked-out pages confirm that much of the secret material,

[02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:21.750]
but foreign support for the 9-11 hijackers does indeed deal with Saudi Arabia.

[02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:27.910]
What's more, some of the classified material also appears in unclassified areas of the report.

[02:17:28.550 --> 02:17:33.090]
In other words, if you know where to look, there's more than enough there to reveal exactly

[02:17:33.090 --> 02:17:37.290]
what it is the Bush administration would prefer the public doesn't know.

[02:17:38.130 --> 02:17:42.990]
So, Eleanor Hill could tell us the story of a Saudi government employee based in California,

[02:17:43.450 --> 02:17:45.550]
a man named Omar Al-Bayumi.

[02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:50.590]
According to the report, at least one, the FBI's best source in Sandy, I guess,

[02:17:50.670 --> 02:17:53.730]
suggested byumi may be a Saudi intelligence officer.

[02:17:53.930 --> 02:17:58.570]
You can then say it at Mr. Bayumi, according to the report, did certainly help and assist

[02:17:58.570 --> 02:18:00.310]
the hijackers at least two of them.

[02:18:00.310 --> 02:18:05.570]
Those two 9-11 hijackers were Khalid Al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.

[02:18:06.130 --> 02:18:10.950]
They were Saudis too, and reportedly the first of the 19 hijackers to enter the U.S.

[02:18:11.930 --> 02:18:13.110]
Guess who was there to meet them?

[02:18:13.750 --> 02:18:20.050]
Basically, Mr. Bayumi had a significant contact with Midharen Pazmi in California.

[02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:24.650]
He put down the deposit for them on their apartment there.

[02:18:24.810 --> 02:18:26.370]
He threw a party for them.

[02:18:26.510 --> 02:18:28.370]
Help them enroll in the place.

[02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:32.950]
He tasked another individual to act as their translator, help them enroll in flight schools.

[02:18:33.210 --> 02:18:38.530]
Not only does the Congressional report detail the Saudi support for those two hijackers,

[02:18:38.890 --> 02:18:43.590]
it also reveals how much American intelligence already knew about them by the time they got to San Diego.

[02:18:44.470 --> 02:18:48.070]
There had been under surveillance at a high level al-Qaeda meeting abroad,

[02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:52.010]
where U.S. agents certainly suspected they were planning future terror attacks.

[02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:56.090]
The CIA knew their names, birth dates, passport numbers,

[02:18:56.090 --> 02:19:00.630]
then you wanted them to have a U.S. entry visa which likely meant they planned to travel there.

[02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:05.690]
But despite it all, the CIA somehow neglected to warn other U.S.

[02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:10.350]
agencies about them, which meant that Al-Midhar and Al-Hazmi were able to enter the country

[02:19:10.350 --> 02:19:16.950]
without a problem and settle in San Diego, even amazingly renew their U.S. visas so they could stay

[02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:20.570]
legally until they played their part on September 11th.

[02:19:22.090 --> 02:19:27.370]
Congressional investigator Eleanor Hill says it was perhaps the single most crucial intelligence failure

[02:19:27.370 --> 02:19:28.830]
before 9-11.

[02:19:29.590 --> 02:19:37.390]
Had the FBI been told that and been aware of that back in January 2000, things may have been

[02:19:37.390 --> 02:19:44.350]
very different. We had the FBI agent from San Diego who handled that informant testify in our

[02:19:44.350 --> 02:19:51.250]
closed hearing that he believes that had he had that information from the CIA, he would have

[02:19:51.250 --> 02:19:57.130]
been able to stop this because he believes he would have had of what he called a full court press

[02:19:57.130 --> 02:20:02.190]
in terms of investigation on Midhar and Al-Hazmi while they were living in San Diego.

[02:20:03.370 --> 02:20:10.150]
But in fact, it was mental August 2001. The two Saudis in San Diego were finally put on the U.S.

[02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:16.530]
watch list. Five in, it was tragically too late. Three weeks afterwards, they crashed American

[02:20:16.530 --> 02:20:18.750]
Airlines flight 77 into the panic.

[02:20:21.890 --> 02:20:31.670]
He was terrific. He really knew how to enjoy his life and he made the people around him enjoy

[02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:38.370]
their lives more. Elizabeth Alderman lost her son at the World Trade Center. Now she's among

[02:20:38.370 --> 02:20:44.350]
4,000 Americans and Canadians who filed a trillion dollar lawsuit against defendants that includes

[02:20:44.350 --> 02:20:50.190]
Saudi charities, members of the Royal Family, and Bin Laden. The suit claims that by funding a

[02:20:50.190 --> 02:20:55.530]
Sama Bin Laden, they were just as responsible for the 9-11 tragedy as the hijackers.

[02:20:55.930 --> 02:21:02.910]
If this will cost the Saudis enough money, I think maybe they will think twice

[02:21:03.470 --> 02:21:09.450]
before they will sponsor terrorism again. I think that if we hadn't brought this lawsuit

[02:21:09.450 --> 02:21:14.650]
with the large number of people that are involved in the lawsuit, that it would have taken a very

[02:21:14.650 --> 02:21:19.610]
long time for the name of Saudi Arabia to even be mentioned by our government.

[02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:25.790]
Elizabeth Alderman's life has changed in many ways. For one, she says, she's never been

[02:21:25.790 --> 02:21:32.850]
suspicious of her government as she is now. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I certainly

[02:21:32.850 --> 02:21:37.290]
can understand why people would believe it because it doesn't make sense.

[02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:43.730]
An awful lot of way I look at life is things have to make sense. I may not be knowledgeable

[02:21:43.730 --> 02:21:47.250]
in a particular area, but I know when things don't make sense.

[02:21:49.470 --> 02:21:53.770]
So has all of this made any difference whatsoever in Washington?

[02:21:54.330 --> 02:21:58.590]
This past summer, U.S. Senators held a hearing on the financial support of terrorism.

[02:21:59.130 --> 02:22:03.710]
They asked government officials to provide the names of the Saudi charities and individuals

[02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:06.050]
have been investigated for funding al-Qaeda.

[02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:10.590]
I know the chairman tried very hard and others have tried very hard to get this information,

[02:22:10.590 --> 02:22:16.330]
so let me try again. Are the names of those entities classified? The names classified?

[02:22:16.610 --> 02:22:19.510]
That you have recommended for listening. It's a yes or no question.

[02:22:19.650 --> 02:22:22.970]
The names themselves are not passed, and I think you ought to present them to us today.

[02:22:22.970 --> 02:22:28.110]
I don't have them with me. Senators were promised that get the names the next day,

[02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:34.610]
but overnight the Bush administration classified them. That list, with the names of the

[02:22:34.610 --> 02:22:39.930]
Saudi suspected of financing a summer bin Laden, would not be made public after all.

[02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:49.330]
Call it a conspiracy or call it the way of the world, but the long relationship between

[02:22:49.330 --> 02:22:54.910]
the Bushes, the bin Laden and the Saudi royal family has shaped the times in which we live

[02:22:54.910 --> 02:23:03.810]
before and after September 11th. For better, for worse, and for whom you be the judge.

[02:23:06.350 --> 02:23:10.010]
Oh, but, Nia, why did you play that thing again? That long pond arrest thing. That's so boring.

[02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:14.030]
No, it's not. All right, I didn't think it was. I think I could play it every day. What?

[02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:18.830]
Just as infuriating the second time around. That is right. As it goes on, it gets more and more

[02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:22.950]
and more and more and more. And then it's the climax there at the end when Karl Levin is asking

[02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:27.490]
for the names of the Saudis who financed 9-11. Well, I'll get it for you. And then overnight

[02:23:27.490 --> 02:23:31.290]
the Bush administration, oh, it's classified now. I'll get back to you. You know how they had

[02:23:31.290 --> 02:23:37.970]
that big rubber stamp classified? Yeah. And they stamped it. And the public is like that.

[02:23:38.410 --> 02:23:41.850]
Hey, don't forget for Reles out for another hour at the Napa Auto Parts. I have it a big

[02:23:41.850 --> 02:23:45.490]
grab opening. What do you say? They got weenies out there. Free burgers and doggies.

[02:23:45.490 --> 02:23:48.650]
Free burgers and weenies and of course, he and Miguel are there. So that's peace for

[02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:53.070]
itself. Napa Auto Parts, 19-11 North State Road 7 and Margate. You can also spin a QM

[02:23:53.070 --> 02:23:57.710]
wheel and win some of the t-shirts and tickets maybe to the night's Panther Penguin game with maybe

[02:23:57.710 --> 02:24:04.610]
a mario, maybe. So how much we got 80 bucks? No new calls. No new calls. Come on, let's go.

[02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:10.450]
We got the question. Why? My phones all screwed up. Why is that? Oh, the inside phone here,

[02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:13.530]
it's been screwed up on and off for a lot of time. Because it's a QM FNY. Is that why it is?

[02:24:14.410 --> 02:24:18.010]
Okay, now let's get back to the second pull question because it's crawling. They don't like this

[02:24:18.010 --> 02:24:22.650]
question and like I said, if they don't like your pull question, that's it. Although in a way,

[02:24:22.690 --> 02:24:25.450]
it worked out good because otherwise I wouldn't have played that thing again. I'm glad I did.

[02:24:26.930 --> 02:24:30.390]
If you had only one tape or DVD movie, like if you were stranded on the desert island,

[02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:35.030]
you could only watch the same one over and over again. What would it be? Godfather 15, the Godfather.

[02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:41.390]
You kind of had a feeling, although it's a long way from being over, you know? Yeah, but you kind

[02:24:41.390 --> 02:24:48.590]
of had a feeling that the Godfather has got a chance to win a damn thing. But just we must go to the

[02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:55.670]
Quarrioli. Caddy, Shack 12, Airplane 9, History of the World Part 1 8, Big Lebowski 8, the Big

[02:24:55.670 --> 02:25:01.870]
Lewinsky, South Park to movie 7, a Clockwork R&S 6, Pink Floyd to Wall 3, Godfather 2, 3,

[02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:06.890]
Network Scott 3. That was my vote. Chris, how are you seeing it about 8 million times?

[02:25:07.650 --> 02:25:11.030]
Greece 2, Straw Dogs 1, Endless Summer 1, Endless Summer.

[02:25:12.410 --> 02:25:17.110]
Namaste, our friend in the Redlands, Jim. Jim put that thing down. It's getting kind of raw.

[02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:22.470]
Great outdoors don't have any, until the end of the world don't have any out of 79 votes.

[02:25:22.610 --> 02:25:27.070]
The new poll is up there and I'm sure we're going to get thousands and billions of new additions

[02:25:27.070 --> 02:25:34.250]
this hour. Don't you think? No. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a AT&C in Verizon Wireless

[02:25:34.250 --> 02:25:38.690]
line. Anybody who heard that the CBC in the first time on Tuesday when I played it and heard it

[02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:42.910]
again, I apologize. Don't I know? No. No, because you probably already heard 50 times. In fact,

[02:25:43.170 --> 02:25:46.830]
I just happened to have taken a cassette out of my cassette player there and I'm just going to

[02:25:46.830 --> 02:25:51.270]
like pack it up in my sack. You know what I mean? Good. Just have it handy. Might become like a

[02:25:51.270 --> 02:25:55.550]
regular feature on the show. All right. From when it's after one at five sixty WQ, I'm

[02:25:55.550 --> 02:25:59.070]
got the mad dog at two, the Humper at four. No, we got a bunch of stuff. We got what do we got?

[02:26:00.830 --> 02:26:04.210]
Just the Panther game is in it. That's right. The pregame is at seven in the game at seven

[02:26:04.210 --> 02:26:08.150]
thirty from the Macarena. Any case out in Vegas doing a show after the Panther hockey game,

[02:26:08.470 --> 02:26:12.390]
any SPN radio overnight because it's cheap in the Joe and Mark have to work Sunday night to try

[02:26:12.390 --> 02:26:16.430]
to goose up the daughtering old Momann. If you're daughtering an older or if you're young and fat,

[02:26:16.570 --> 02:26:20.530]
that make a difference how old you are. Fat is not what's at. Believe me, I know from experience.

[02:26:20.770 --> 02:26:24.510]
When skinny people talk to you about fat, what the hell do they know? So whether you are one of

[02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:28.930]
those Atkins, Dianns or South Beach. God forbid or sugarbusters or any other low carb

[02:26:28.930 --> 02:26:33.710]
diet. There's a great story you got to introduce yourself to the lights of West Boko. The lights

[02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:37.970]
has got over a thousand low carb products right there in a shell. Not like when you go in a super

[02:26:37.970 --> 02:26:43.570]
market and you can't find anything with some taste to it, you know. They're bagels and breads and

[02:26:43.570 --> 02:26:48.610]
cheesecake muffins, brownies, chocolates, pasta, sauces. I'm talking about low carb and sugar-free.

[02:26:49.050 --> 02:26:53.130]
Chips and dip soups, ketchup, coverlight ice cream and lots more including champion light drinks

[02:26:53.130 --> 02:26:57.990]
and five delicious flavors. While not brownies by control carb, carbolite candy coated chocolate

[02:26:57.990 --> 02:27:03.810]
covered peanuts, apple cinnamon granola by carb sets and crunchy pretzels by carb sense. Whatever

[02:27:03.810 --> 02:27:07.090]
you do, don't choke on them. And don't forget that the lights you can sample anything in the store

[02:27:07.090 --> 02:27:11.310]
before you invite and all those Atkins brand products rest in peace. All the Atkins products are on

[02:27:11.310 --> 02:27:15.950]
sale all day, every day even on some of the store at the lights of West Boko. They're open every day,

[02:27:15.970 --> 02:27:19.690]
seven days a week, ten to ten. And you find the lights on the northeast corner of Glades in

[02:27:19.690 --> 02:27:25.430]
441 right next to Boston Market. You can call them tool free at 1-877 Low Carb. That's with the

[02:27:49.970 --> 02:27:55.410]
LOWCARB on the web at lowcarb.com. For all you fat folks out there trying to lose that

[02:27:55.410 --> 02:28:00.450]
weight. There's one thing we all understand.

[02:28:03.570 --> 02:28:08.870]
Alcata won't be finished until we blow up Pakistan.

[02:28:11.970 --> 02:28:20.870]
We could chase around forever with our tanks and all our troops, but special forces are some

[02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:29.830]
tire of jumping through them moves. You know we need another plan.

[02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:38.630]
So let's cut out all the nonsense and go blow up Pakistan.

[02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:56.090]
Now, we need to need to nuclear tank. Why don't we stop pussy food and go blow up Pakistan.

[02:28:59.910 --> 02:29:02.630]
Well, I hate these papers that make it filahola.

[02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:07.370]
Boom, boom. So today's the weather of the Charleston, the newspaper, the post, whatever.

[02:29:07.370 --> 02:29:12.630]
Those are fun. The post in career and Charleston.net. And here's the story I'm looking for.

[02:29:13.290 --> 02:29:17.550]
Police find no drugs. It's strat for the higher whatever it was. And then you go to click it on and

[02:29:17.550 --> 02:29:21.090]
print it out. Police find drugs is rep for that. And right away, oh please tell us a little

[02:29:21.090 --> 02:29:24.550]
it's as easy as one, two, three. And it got about a whole bunch of questions.

[02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:25.370]
Not just a bit.

[02:29:25.530 --> 02:29:28.450]
You got to call out your name address and you choose size and all kinds of crap.

[02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:32.530]
I don't have time for that. 220. We got 220 bucks.

[02:29:32.970 --> 02:29:36.250]
Yes. I'm pleasantly surprised. That's not too bad for abandonment rescue.

[02:29:36.650 --> 02:29:40.210]
Because this isn't really art or thing. This is just like, you know, a piggyback, right?

[02:29:40.730 --> 02:29:42.030]
A piggy bank piggy bank.

[02:29:42.890 --> 02:29:45.630]
220 bucks. Let's get it to nice even 300 by two o'clock.

[02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:49.290]
Okay. Go see if he really talks like that and person and yes he does.

[02:29:49.410 --> 02:29:51.010]
And he's crazy in a bedbog and we love him.

[02:29:51.070 --> 02:29:51.790]
I'm like that.

[02:29:53.310 --> 02:29:58.010]
That's him. It's no act involved there, man. What you see is what you get from not only two o'clock,

[02:29:58.010 --> 02:30:01.730]
but the 40 women's to go out there and like any maybe Miguel at your hold on to his thing.

[02:30:02.290 --> 02:30:06.310]
Napalato parts 1911 North State Road 7 and Margate and we also got the maybe some tickets

[02:30:06.310 --> 02:30:07.930]
if it went to the United States Panther Penguin game.

[02:30:08.250 --> 02:30:09.830]
So is Mario playing Scott or what?

[02:30:12.390 --> 02:30:14.510]
That's that? No. I don't know.

[02:30:15.810 --> 02:30:18.870]
Maybe, maybe not. Well, no, say no because that means that he'll play.

[02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:22.370]
Oh, no, absolutely not. So there's a good chance Mario is going to play tonight because he's

[02:30:22.370 --> 02:30:25.890]
had that hip flexor and he said that he's going to escape this morning and see how it feels

[02:30:25.890 --> 02:30:30.170]
and hip to. So maybe old number 66 will be out there. I know number 69 will be there.

[02:30:31.730 --> 02:30:35.030]
But at any rate, so you didn't get no tickets tonight's game, huh? Well, that's why you're in such a

[02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:38.510]
sour mood. Maybe it's that paycheck you got there. Look at that. And I'd be in a sour mood too.

[02:30:38.910 --> 02:30:43.550]
That what? So I, you know, they, I hope that this isn't one of those stories because this does

[02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:47.470]
happen once in a while. Once in a great while, like even on CNN, it's got all these hours to fill

[02:30:47.470 --> 02:30:51.850]
up with crap. They'll show it unbelievably outrageous story and then you never see it again.

[02:30:51.970 --> 02:30:55.650]
You know what I mean? Right. I hope they don't do that with that straightforward high in that

[02:30:55.650 --> 02:30:59.250]
of the status Charleston. What? They better not even though it's in a real Yahoo place.

[02:30:59.250 --> 02:31:04.990]
Well, that's not the point. That thing is. Oh, you mean like the US? Yeah. It's an Yahoo place.

[02:31:05.130 --> 02:31:09.850]
The US man. Oh, there's a president in North Carolina raised another million bucks for his

[02:31:09.850 --> 02:31:14.470]
reelection campaign. Okay, let's get some more movies on this list before we get out of here. Okay.

[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:21.510]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T. Now this calling Parkland's been under for like eight hours. Hello.

[02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:29.810]
Neil. Yes, sir. First of all, movie young Frankenstein. Okay. Now in regard to the subject to

[02:31:29.810 --> 02:31:35.990]
do your political situation in the United States, I found was best described recently by Lewis Black.

[02:31:36.170 --> 02:31:41.310]
We said the Democrats have no ideas and Republicans have bad ones. Right. That's very good. I like that.

[02:31:41.590 --> 02:31:47.930]
I thought he hit the nail right on the proverbial squarehead. Also in regard to the idiot that

[02:31:47.930 --> 02:31:52.550]
called earlier and talked started talking about the economy being good and everything and you cut him

[02:31:52.550 --> 02:31:57.790]
off. City was chronic. Yeah, please remind that school that the economy was good during the Vietnam war

[02:31:57.790 --> 02:32:02.970]
to when we only lost what was it? 58,000 of our troops. Yeah, guns and butter man. Remember that? No

[02:32:02.970 --> 02:32:08.770]
question about. But a question about it. And the fact that this conspiracy does exist between the

[02:32:08.770 --> 02:32:14.730]
Bush family and the Saudi government is beyond dispute anymore. It's only a matter of how long it

[02:32:14.730 --> 02:32:20.050]
takes the American public to wake up. And you, Neil, are one of the great alarm clock. So please keep

[02:32:20.050 --> 02:32:24.850]
pounding on it and hopefully some babies more on. Oh, yeah. Listen, that's that's Michael. I'm

[02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:29.870]
going to change the world right here. I don't know if you'll change the world, but you have you have

[02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:35.310]
already changed the dog's up. Okay. Thanks a lot, Pali. Take care. Who woke the dogs up? Remember that

[02:32:35.310 --> 02:32:39.950]
somebody? How about how many people woke the dogs up? Hey, listen, I'm doing the best I can in our

[02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:42.710]
little corner of the world. And of course, it could make a difference because you'll be calling

[02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:48.370]
Florida. Where we have a lot of dumb people, including not just red next. We got some dumb old Jews

[02:32:48.370 --> 02:32:52.950]
too. Can't figure out how to vote. So they voted for Papu Cannon. You know, we had a little bit

[02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:57.090]
of a problem in Florida. That's what gave us this bunch of Nazis and enabled in the steel election.

[02:32:57.510 --> 02:33:03.030]
And put all this over on us again with these right wing fascists. You must see, I'm telling you,

[02:33:03.070 --> 02:33:10.510]
I am begging you, some of you people who really give a crap about these things, put on a tape, put

[02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:16.130]
on CNN. I mean, you know, if you're not going to be watching TV, put our start your TV or whatever.

[02:33:17.710 --> 02:33:21.070]
And get CNN ruling because I know they're going to show that story again. Sure.

[02:33:21.170 --> 02:33:26.630]
Just to see it is so eerie and so scary. I guess there's some people that don't think there's

[02:33:26.630 --> 02:33:32.290]
anything wrong with that kind of a thing. Is that so? Well, if you don't have a country, they want

[02:33:32.290 --> 02:33:35.330]
to live in, but it sure is hell isn't the one that I want to live in and quite frankly don't live

[02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:38.970]
in that much anymore. And that's part of the reason for it. A lot of people don't believe kids have

[02:33:38.970 --> 02:33:43.190]
rights, you know. I see. So in other words, if it happened to be their kids who got basically

[02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:48.190]
slammed down to the floor and then handcuffed if they didn't go step along and the search and gun

[02:33:48.190 --> 02:33:52.810]
point for drugs, I guess they wouldn't be concerned about that. See if it was their kids, then they

[02:33:52.810 --> 02:33:56.510]
might be seeing a different tune. Just like if it's their kids who are going to be brought home in a

[02:33:56.510 --> 02:34:00.550]
casket in a coffin that we're never going to see from Iraq, then maybe they're going to be start

[02:34:00.550 --> 02:34:04.130]
screaming loud and saying, Hey, this is a bunch of crap. And I don't want my kids to be done for

[02:34:04.130 --> 02:34:08.710]
nothing. For a bunch of graveropters, for a bunch of lunatics, for a bunch of crooks,

[02:34:09.850 --> 02:34:13.510]
for a bechtel in Halibut, and is that what the American kids have to die for? Okay.

[02:34:14.850 --> 02:34:19.030]
And let me say again, all of this air be bit of it was decided whether you wanted to decide it

[02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:25.170]
was 1992 or the P-NAC meeting in 1999 before they stole the election by all the old chicken

[02:34:25.170 --> 02:34:29.410]
hawks from back in Reagan days, but of course Ronnie forgot. And we'll never find out about that unless

[02:34:29.410 --> 02:34:33.810]
you have a showtime if they've decided to even show it. And by the way, you do realize that they're

[02:34:33.810 --> 02:34:38.670]
showing on showtime the Reagan ministers, but they're making changes. No, I didn't know that. Yeah,

[02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:42.670]
oh yeah. Oh, we're not going to show the one that the producers wanted that you'd be on.

[02:34:42.770 --> 02:34:48.750]
The bad foul. No, no. So every time you turn on channel four in South Florida and you see

[02:34:48.750 --> 02:34:57.590]
tears coming from the CBSI, you'll understand why the eye is crying. 29 votes for the Godfather.

[02:34:57.750 --> 02:35:02.310]
I didn't know no Godfather. Did you? No, we were in the olive oil business.

[02:35:02.310 --> 02:35:07.450]
You know who I am. I'm no great. There's no the tape made my bones when you were going out with

[02:35:07.450 --> 02:35:14.170]
cheerleaders. 29 for the Godfather. 16 for Caddy Shack. Airplane 14. Airplane is just great.

[02:35:14.930 --> 02:35:19.310]
Big Lebowski 11. History of the World Part 110. South Park the movie 10. Clockwork or in 7.

[02:35:19.750 --> 02:35:25.390]
Pink Floyd the wall 5. Four for Greece and networking Godfather 2. And a endless summer Scott 3.

[02:35:27.750 --> 02:35:32.170]
Three votes for endless summer. I think it's called endless hummer.

[02:35:32.170 --> 02:35:36.690]
Isn't it? That Bruce Brown and by the way speaking of Bruce Brown,

[02:35:36.750 --> 02:35:40.170]
a one who made all of those movies. Your game. The other wife, you know,

[02:35:40.350 --> 02:35:45.310]
in a son, a surfer, a son. So I don't know maybe just keep it all in the family.

[02:35:45.690 --> 02:35:49.330]
It's a 26 past one. You know, I'll tell you one thing for all wants to nets and man for some

[02:35:49.330 --> 02:35:53.230]
dollar, man. Are we going to get that taken care of or not? High boy has the connections.

[02:35:53.310 --> 02:35:56.370]
He's going to have always on vacation or something. Some permanent vacation.

[02:35:57.610 --> 02:36:01.210]
He's sitting there eating like pork fat right off the damn pig.

[02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:06.490]
And anyway, we'll get it done for his Scott. Just relax. Okay. You stay on that cot for a

[02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:09.330]
little week or two. We'll get a thing. Carob. In fact, when I get down there, man,

[02:36:09.390 --> 02:36:12.750]
you're going to see some real changes when I sales department because I'm not pulling no punches

[02:36:12.750 --> 02:36:19.070]
this time. I am just going to unload what a bunch of do nothing assholes, man. The word work is

[02:36:19.070 --> 02:36:23.390]
not a nerve vocabulary. Just like when you get that agency copy and it's got all the mistakes

[02:36:23.390 --> 02:36:27.330]
in everything. And God forbid looking at it and proofreading it and seeing if there's anything

[02:36:27.330 --> 02:36:30.870]
that makes sense in it because that sounds a little bit too much like work, which is not the

[02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:35.930]
vocabulary of the QM sales department. Writing orders as a glorified order taker, that sounds good

[02:36:35.930 --> 02:36:40.930]
at them. 26 after one. Hey, I'll tell you something sounds good for me. And that is getting

[02:36:40.930 --> 02:36:43.770]
a good night's sleep. How do you do it? Well, on the way is just having you a good mattress,

[02:36:43.930 --> 02:36:48.090]

[02:37:16.990 --> 02:37:20.690]
whole day of your life praying that somebody shows up. I've been sleeping on a dial a mattress for

[02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:23.570]
years. You ought to be doing the same and all the other people in the building are starting to catch

[02:38:22.970 --> 02:38:30.770]
Sniper Muhammad is trial set to start. He had people jumpy when they heard of

[02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:39.330]
the fire. Monday morning went to get some ammo. Tuesday he goes shooting with his son.

[02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:48.210]
Wednesday they get busted by the police. They found a girl.

[02:38:49.950 --> 02:38:57.930]
Sniper Muhammad, part of a psychopath and we won't be happy to leave him the chair.

[02:39:02.130 --> 02:39:11.670]
I am 132 at 560 WTAM. So here's a fact that says how could you possibly have forgotten

[02:39:11.670 --> 02:39:17.890]
and wrecked him for a dream so quickly we didn't forget it. I mean you can't pick him on.

[02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:22.850]
I would have put Magnolia on there but that would have got George up set.

[02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:27.150]
No, I don't care. Actually I really think Magnolia. I love Magnolia. I don't care what you say

[02:39:27.150 --> 02:39:34.730]
or anybody else's. That's me. Well thank you. Plus it's over three hours long so it takes a lot of time.

[02:39:35.250 --> 02:39:40.410]
And Godfather how about the trilogy? Sure. Yeah let's do that. Finally printed this out. I set them

[02:39:40.410 --> 02:39:45.690]
of course I made up my name now as Schwartz is my last name. One thing I learned a hard way because

[02:39:45.690 --> 02:39:50.270]
I'm really dumb and I'm one of those few who admitted I'm stupid very slow on the uptake.

[02:39:51.330 --> 02:39:57.290]
You know those pop-up ads there was one day last week when my computer which my internet here

[02:39:57.290 --> 02:40:02.230]
is as fast as lightning okay thank knock on wood. But one day last week in the afternoon it slowed down

[02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:06.050]
and I thought I don't know this is getting ponderous. Yeah because I don't have the patience for it no

[02:40:06.050 --> 02:40:11.730]
mole especially after you're spoiled with a lightning fast connection. So one of those pop-up ads came

[02:40:11.730 --> 02:40:17.210]
up on there you know and with the phony test and we're testing your computer you know in a red light

[02:40:17.210 --> 02:40:22.550]
early good like really it's poor and the speed up your computer and it looks like Eric has warned

[02:40:22.550 --> 02:40:28.150]
me the more legitimate it looks the more likely it is it's a fraud right real fancy and glossy and

[02:40:28.150 --> 02:40:32.410]
multi-colored and all the lights are flashing and so I sign up for it naturally I send them my credit

[02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:36.710]
card information and I'm buying the and see first of all you should be able to download it without

[02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:41.950]
going through what buying anything right but in this case then they're going to send you a backup

[02:40:41.950 --> 02:40:45.870]
disk and all of this and you're in the early year you're addressing your shoe size and your credit

[02:40:46.370 --> 02:40:51.230]
and then I realized that and then they're going to email you back with instructions how to download it

[02:40:51.770 --> 02:40:58.010]
did I ever get an email back of course not no so what I did was after I sat and I looked at the wall

[02:40:58.010 --> 02:41:02.190]
kind of played in my navel I said I think I just been had so I called my credit card company in

[02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:08.010]
cancel that card to send me a new one very good no but I mean how long does it take before we how

[02:41:08.010 --> 02:41:12.990]
many years finally wise up and realize that you have to be really cautious putting stuff on the

[02:41:13.390 --> 02:41:18.710]
I mean if you do know and then I find out for example at amazon.com there's even a fake amazon.com

[02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:23.810]
you know that no I did not yeah there is now I don't know how you wind up getting linked to that

[02:41:23.810 --> 02:41:28.790]
but there is one it's uh make believe that this is a real one with an s I don't know I have no idea

[02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:34.870]
it's spelled with a cue so anyway I did finally get this story down here that we saw on CNN

[02:41:35.890 --> 02:41:41.530]
goose creek south Carolina and I'm telling you I don't care what your politics are I don't care what

[02:41:41.530 --> 02:41:48.290]
your IQ is smaller than a bread box if you see this piece if it doesn't like scare the crap out of

[02:41:48.290 --> 02:41:53.170]
you you've got to be like numb you have to be totally numb just let your facts where people can

[02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:58.330]
go see it goose creek south Carolina reports of drug deals at stratford high school led to an early

[02:41:58.330 --> 02:42:03.250]
morning police raid this week in which about 15 officers cordoned off the main hallway to search

[02:42:03.250 --> 02:42:10.730]
for marijuana several jeweler guns but didn't use force police said oh see I they're just

[02:42:10.730 --> 02:42:14.350]
searching for marijuana right I thought they were searching for like maybe a little bit something

[02:42:14.350 --> 02:42:19.750]
stronger than a like maybe maybe uh maybe dry Russian's oxy cotton supply or a little a white powder

[02:42:19.750 --> 02:42:26.350]
something right they're looking for mirror freaking wana baby for the wacky weed several jew

[02:42:26.350 --> 02:42:30.130]
their guns but didn't use force police said officials didn't arrest anybody during the lockdown

[02:42:30.130 --> 02:42:36.590]
at 6.41s. day morning a police doctor said residue on 12 book bags but found no drugs said

[02:42:36.590 --> 02:42:41.770]
lieutenant davirons of the goose creek police department the goose creek police goose step police

[02:42:41.770 --> 02:42:46.110]
several officers did a pollster their weapons and a tactical enforcement approach he said there

[02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:50.610]
was no force whatsoever everyone was very compliant well not thought what they said on CNN right

[02:42:50.610 --> 02:42:54.710]
they said some of the students who one didn't want to like uh go uh goose step and right on down

[02:42:54.710 --> 02:43:00.370]
against the wall got handcuffed official charge and ninth grader wins they have known with

[02:43:00.370 --> 02:43:04.410]
filing a false police report the juvenile said an officer shoved her to the ground during the

[02:43:04.410 --> 02:43:10.290]
search errand said principal George McCracken oh oh oh oh I love it that is brother Phil is brother

[02:43:10.290 --> 02:43:15.270]
Jimmy crack corn principal George McCracken said he had the school officials and the girls parents

[02:43:15.270 --> 02:43:20.150]
reviewed video surveillance tapes and after uh reviewing the video the video tape determined she

[02:43:20.150 --> 02:43:25.830]
wasn't even in the hall at the time so you see yeah cracken went errands on monday with suspicions

[02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:30.390]
about marijuana exchanges at the school based on camera recordings and reports from students and

[02:43:30.390 --> 02:43:34.370]
teachers within the last three weeks there's been an influx of drug activity i've been in this

[02:43:34.370 --> 02:43:39.050]
business 34 years and i've never seen the amount of activity we experienced recently said McCracken

[02:43:39.050 --> 02:43:44.610]
who's been principal at the school since it opened in 1983 several weeks ago a student was

[02:43:44.610 --> 02:43:48.990]
arrested trying to pass out between 200 and 300 prescription pills he said actor school ended

[02:43:48.990 --> 02:43:52.510]
Friday one student turned another claim to have a weapon we're not going to tolerate

[02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:55.690]
him McCracken said we have to ensure the health and safety of our students and staff

[02:43:55.690 --> 02:43:59.650]
errands said he watched school surveillance tapes from four days that showed students congregating

[02:43:59.650 --> 02:44:03.610]
under cameras periodically walking into a bathroom with different students and coming out moments

[02:44:03.610 --> 02:44:08.810]
later well maybe they're having a good time in there never know the suspected group of about 10

[02:44:08.810 --> 02:44:13.750]
students come to school in early buses tape show a network of lookouts errands and McCracken said

[02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:17.370]
they're pretty knowledgeable in terms of where to stand they know where the cameras are if they

[02:44:17.370 --> 02:44:21.130]
stand directly under them the cameras don't look directly down faculty can see the students from

[02:44:21.130 --> 02:44:27.430]
other cameras but from my quite a distance away they see silhouettes police told the students 107

[02:44:27.430 --> 02:44:32.890]
by the way happened to be in the hallway during the big raid police told the students to sit on

[02:44:32.890 --> 02:44:39.130]
the floor put their hands out officers search only book bags that the police don't respond to not

[02:44:39.130 --> 02:44:44.270]
students McCracken said he believes a lookout alerted the group Wednesday morning by cell phone

[02:44:44.270 --> 02:44:49.330]
after seeing after seeing the police arrive later in the day two other students who found

[02:44:49.330 --> 02:44:55.470]
them a cafeteria during less were charged with disturbing school oh my god I can't stand it I can't handle it

[02:44:57.810 --> 02:45:01.950]
there's drugs going on baby in that school so let's bring on to go stuff oh yeah that's

By the way information you sent me on it facts a little while ago before the last break was very interesting I wasn't aware of that

[02:48:22.930 --> 02:48:28.030]
Well there you are good excellent I'm pleased to see it 145 with 560 WDQIM

[02:48:31.530 --> 02:48:35.090]
Listen's on the internet you can watch that story about those kids in South Carolina

[02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:37.830]
on MSNBC.com thank you very much

[02:48:38.650 --> 02:48:43.470]
Also Zach in New York City well let's see this facts is hand-good and the last part of it I'm a little a gas stat

[02:48:43.470 --> 02:48:50.150]
Two campy movies for the pool 9 to 5 with Ali Parton and Lily Tomlin and Mommy Deeris so he's got two but we didn't want campy movies right?

[02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:51.630]
No no no

[02:48:52.730 --> 02:48:56.730]
Also you should write a movie called Laurel Canyon great movie in a good soundtrack what is that?

[02:48:56.970 --> 02:48:57.550]
Don't know

[02:48:58.510 --> 02:49:04.010]
Finally and here comes the worst part Zach your website needs a makeover it's not organized I can help

[02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:09.390]
You ready for that our website needs a makeover our website is effing outstanding

[02:49:11.390 --> 02:49:12.310]
You don't think so?

[02:49:12.550 --> 02:49:15.050]
Last time we got some help on the website all kinds of bad things happen

[02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:16.770]
Yeah I'm not doing that

[02:49:16.770 --> 02:49:21.350]
Exactly and of course you certainly had your finger deep inside of that so to speak

[02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:23.170]
Our website is great

[02:49:24.090 --> 02:49:28.170]
Our website is sensational and Eric all of a sudden pushed up big time because I don't know why

[02:49:28.850 --> 02:49:34.610]
I guess because you bitched him out so much but at any rate in fact everybody ought to be going to the erudges.com

[02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:37.850]
Not just the vote for the movie because this pool today sucks let's face it they don't like it

[02:49:37.850 --> 02:49:45.330]
But to check out that weapons of mass destruction countdown the WMD countdown that maybe in fact you know something?

[02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:48.050]
That's a good poll yeah

[02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:51.170]
What's the best thing we ever had on our website?

[02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:57.130]
Maybe we'll do that maybe I'll do it one day next week the weapon of let me look at that it's such a beautiful thing

[02:49:57.130 --> 02:50:02.090]
I guarantee he came out of the same family tree with precious there's no question only she's got a high rack hue

[02:50:03.190 --> 02:50:09.530]
We've been digging now for 230 days 13 hours 47 minutes and 24 seconds and you can watch the clock continue counting long

[02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:20.910]
Ain't found nothing but oh yeah darn it and there is the WMister he put the WMWMD and he's and he is chimpin it up with a vestibum

[02:50:20.910 --> 02:50:26.310]
It's a beautiful thing got to see that so thanks anyway Zach but no here's a call from Kendall hello

[02:50:28.830 --> 02:50:36.130]
Kendall is gone just as well or I was on a wrong line like I said here's a call from Kendall hello

[02:50:36.130 --> 02:50:38.190]
Neil are you sure sorry about that?

[02:50:38.210 --> 02:50:42.490]
Let me ask you why is that nobody in America broadcast that stuff that you're playing on the radio?

[02:50:43.010 --> 02:50:46.850]
Because America is worried about getting more special deals in the government that's why

[02:50:47.390 --> 02:50:50.670]
Viacom that's why Viacom and CBS cancel the Reagan mini series

[02:50:50.670 --> 02:50:55.270]
I'm believe also I thought boating for color man that that that's open to mine big time too

[02:50:57.230 --> 02:51:03.510]
Excellent and for my poll I want to vote for I know it's a cheesy movie but I want to vote wild thing

[02:51:04.210 --> 02:51:07.690]
I'm stranded yeah if I'm stranded I said they're right and I want to make a good point

[02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:11.070]
They're good point pal you know good chicken chick accident you know something

[02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:13.830]
I'll keep your eyes on it and have a great day

[02:51:13.830 --> 02:51:17.810]
He wants to see the old wild thing I think he wants to do the old wild thing maybe even with himself

[02:51:18.390 --> 02:51:24.550]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T you'll have to get a permission slipped over by the way from the government before you can do that

[02:51:25.490 --> 02:51:33.650]
Poppill may help NS sufferers see there you go again start when it right on the heels of that nice story about those dangerous kids in South Carolina

[02:51:33.650 --> 02:51:36.310]
Or have them all and then drugs

[02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:46.650]
There you go again holding drugs and sex and dangerous things and movies and dancing and stuff like that

[02:51:47.210 --> 02:51:53.770]
A marijuana pill appeared to relieve some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the first scientifically rigorous study of the strongly debated drug

[02:51:53.770 --> 02:52:01.410]
You ready for that I'm ready I heard it the research published this week in the Lancet Medical Journal found that even though the improvements could not be detected by doctors tests

[02:52:01.410 --> 02:52:07.790]
A greater proportion of patients taking the drug reported reduced pain and muscle stiffness than those taking fake capsules

[02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:08.650]
You know sugar pill

[02:52:10.310 --> 02:52:14.730]
Experts said the mixed results make them tricky to interpret some said they were encouraged any improvement was noted

[02:52:14.730 --> 02:52:17.410]
While others said any major effect would have shown up in the doctor's test

[02:52:17.410 --> 02:52:28.110]
One study leader dr. John Zedges said some Polock from the University of Plymouth in England said the research raises questions about what's more important to doctors measurements or a patient's perspective

[02:52:28.110 --> 02:52:32.910]
It's like the guy that goes to the doctor says hey doc how do I feel right it's like that again yeah

[02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:37.970]
Yeah, if there's a I think if there's a conflict it's what the patient feels that's important

[02:52:37.970 --> 02:52:44.170]
So I think it's quite encouraging said Roger per tweet a professor of neuro-neuro-pharmacology at the University of Aberdeen

[02:52:44.170 --> 02:52:49.510]
Who is not connected with the study so there you go one more reason to light up big fat one okay over the weekend

[02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:54.030]
Oh, but of course it's illegal so come on up here. They won't do that one

[02:52:55.030 --> 02:52:57.130]

I'm here watching all of you

[02:53:55.570 --> 02:53:58.130]
Everyone does a special

So what you do

Get out of here

Don't you

[02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:29.570]
Believe everything we tell you

[02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:31.650]
And the state run new

[02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:36.610]
Bloodworn, four cornbread

[02:54:36.610 --> 02:54:39.690]
Fill up your escalade

[02:54:40.610 --> 02:54:43.690]
A roof and chainy bush venue

[02:54:44.750 --> 02:54:46.630]
That's just USA

[02:54:48.410 --> 02:54:51.670]
We don't like to see our jobs go

[02:54:51.670 --> 02:54:56.090]
A by the time of these bulls

[02:54:56.090 --> 02:54:58.750]
We're fascinated by jail

[02:54:59.810 --> 02:55:03.890]
Don't read no stupid bulls

[02:55:03.890 --> 02:55:06.450]
All is now are in waiting

[02:55:07.210 --> 02:55:10.330]
The tax of Farrah can wait

[02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:14.030]
Everybody's turning taxes

[02:55:15.350 --> 02:55:17.310]
Black SQS thing

[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:20.670]
I told her that Eric is the best in my

[02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:21.530]
New York.

[02:55:21.530 --> 02:55:22.150]
Thanks for your help

[02:55:22.150 --> 02:55:22.910]
But the answer is still

[02:55:22.910 --> 02:55:23.110]
No.

[02:55:23.230 --> 02:55:23.970]
Now we're doing fine.

[02:55:23.970 --> 02:55:25.230]
If you look on our website

[02:55:25.910 --> 02:55:26.890]
That is beautiful.

[02:55:27.090 --> 02:55:27.610]
Ain't it?

[02:55:28.090 --> 02:55:28.890]
There's the people

[02:55:28.890 --> 02:55:29.770]
Because here's a fact

[02:55:29.770 --> 02:55:30.950]
It says from Jimmy and Boca

[02:55:30.950 --> 02:55:31.930]
Please tell me the name of the show

[02:55:31.930 --> 02:55:32.690]
You were airing clips of

[02:55:32.690 --> 02:55:33.510]
I just joined your show

[02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.990]
Yadi Yadi.

[02:55:34.310 --> 02:55:35.250]
And there it is.

[02:55:35.370 --> 02:55:36.250]
Are we getting a lot of calls

[02:55:36.250 --> 02:55:37.330]
Out the air for the website

[02:55:37.330 --> 02:55:38.450]
Isn't that right?

[02:55:38.830 --> 02:55:39.110]
There you go.

[02:55:39.250 --> 02:55:40.290]
Listen, make it really easy for it.

[02:55:40.390 --> 02:55:40.970]
That's what we want to do.

[02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:41.790]
We want to make it simple.

[02:55:41.890 --> 02:55:43.390]
Simple solutions for simple people

[02:55:43.390 --> 02:55:44.550]
With a simple president.

[02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:48.050]
Right above the weapons of mass destruction

[02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:49.870]
The picture of W with that monkey lips

[02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:51.910]
Is a link.

[02:55:53.410 --> 02:55:55.130]
Conspiracy theories uncovering the facts

[02:55:55.130 --> 02:55:57.050]
Behind the myths of 9, 11, 2001

[02:55:57.050 --> 02:55:58.470]
The fifth is state from the CBC

[02:55:59.050 --> 02:56:00.810]
And here I just click on whatever you want to look.

[02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:03.550]
The interviews, the congressional report.

[02:56:03.870 --> 02:56:06.590]
A hell of a lot more in depth than just the clips that I played.

[02:56:06.750 --> 02:56:06.810]
Right?

[02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:07.310]
Right.

[02:56:07.850 --> 02:56:08.410]
All the good stuff.

[02:56:08.550 --> 02:56:09.550]
All the good stuff all the time.

[02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:10.370]
So thank you, Eric.

[02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:11.710]
You are phenomenal.

[02:56:12.190 --> 02:56:12.510]
Is it?

[02:56:12.770 --> 02:56:13.650]
He's the best.

[02:56:14.590 --> 02:56:15.650]
I said more stuff.

[02:56:15.850 --> 02:56:17.610]
He said a little more enthusiastically than that.

[02:56:17.610 --> 02:56:18.710]
That's the best I love him.

[02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:19.830]
I have a very good feeling.

[02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.470]
Eric, you need it.

[02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:23.550]
Although he doesn't want to be associated with people like you,

[02:56:23.610 --> 02:56:24.050]
but never mind.

[02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:24.310]
I understand.

[02:56:24.430 --> 02:56:24.910]
I still love him.

[02:56:25.290 --> 02:56:25.970]
Oh, sure you do.

[02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:27.530]
Okay, here's the pull question.

[02:56:27.610 --> 02:56:29.330]
The first pull we had earlier, in case you like,

[02:56:29.410 --> 02:56:31.010]
or cracked out or went out to take a big one.

[02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:33.650]
Hillary, now I forgot how that came out.

[02:56:33.730 --> 02:56:34.290]
How are Dean one?

[02:56:34.370 --> 02:56:35.710]
But Hillary put in a real good battle there.

[02:56:35.890 --> 02:56:36.230]
Three times.

[02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.370]
Three times.

[02:56:36.470 --> 02:56:36.470]

[02:56:36.690 --> 02:56:36.850]
Three times.

[02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:40.750]
And she come up pretty good.

[02:56:40.970 --> 02:56:42.230]
At any rate, how are Dean one it?

[02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:45.090]
And then of course we had about 13% of bush liquors out there.

[02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:46.810]
And despite, don't confuse them with the facts.

[02:56:46.810 --> 02:56:48.610]
Like I said, it's not politics to them.

[02:56:48.870 --> 02:56:49.630]
It's a religion.

[02:56:49.830 --> 02:56:50.730]
That's what it's all about.

[02:56:51.030 --> 02:56:52.830]
Do you think that he really believes all that crap?

[02:56:53.290 --> 02:56:53.650]
No.

[02:56:54.030 --> 02:56:54.310]
I know.

[02:56:54.690 --> 02:56:55.670]
Although he is dumb enough.

[02:56:55.770 --> 02:56:55.950]
You know what?

[02:56:55.990 --> 02:56:56.570]
It's possible.

[02:56:57.130 --> 02:57:00.530]
Because keeping my channy and the henchmen wolf wits and pro all these guys,

[02:57:00.810 --> 02:57:02.810]
they're the ones pulling the strings like that article I read.

[02:57:03.190 --> 02:57:03.930]
No, he doesn't believe it.

[02:57:03.950 --> 02:57:05.590]
He's still doing all the same things he always has been.

[02:57:05.670 --> 02:57:06.730]
At least I as far as I'm concerned.

[02:57:07.730 --> 02:57:08.330]
Oh no.

[02:57:09.050 --> 02:57:10.970]
You think he's drinking with the Prince Bondar?

[02:57:12.130 --> 02:57:12.490]
Bondar.

[02:57:12.550 --> 02:57:15.390]
If you only had one tape or DVD movie that you could watch,

[02:57:15.390 --> 02:57:17.730]
it's like if you were stranded on a desert island somewhere.

[02:57:18.570 --> 02:57:19.210]
What would it be?

[02:57:20.070 --> 02:57:21.250]
Godfather, 38 wins.

[02:57:21.470 --> 02:57:23.370]
Hands down your pants as they make you another offer.

[02:57:24.190 --> 02:57:24.910]
Kati Shack, 30.

[02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.950]
Kati Shack is strong.

[02:57:26.910 --> 02:57:28.590]
Airplane 22, I like Airplane better.

[02:57:28.930 --> 02:57:30.890]
The Big Lebowski, the Big Lebowski's got 15.

[02:57:31.850 --> 02:57:33.270]
History of the World Part One, 13.

[02:57:33.510 --> 02:57:35.110]
South Park, the movie's got 11.

[02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:37.830]
Clockwork Orange, 11.

[02:57:38.170 --> 02:57:39.290]
Pink Floyd, the wall's got 9.

[02:57:39.590 --> 02:57:40.610]
Godfather, 2's got 8.

[02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:41.270]
Greece.

[02:57:42.110 --> 02:57:43.310]
Five people like Greece.

[02:57:43.310 --> 02:57:44.570]
I can't tell you where they put it.

[02:57:44.670 --> 02:57:45.450]
No worse got five.

[02:57:45.790 --> 02:57:47.250]
Monty Python and the Holy Grail Four.

[02:57:47.630 --> 02:57:49.370]
Endless Summer, all you Thirfor Boyd.

[02:57:49.630 --> 02:57:50.050]
Got three.

[02:57:51.790 --> 02:57:52.990]
I can't get over that.

[02:57:53.330 --> 02:57:56.550]
The Great Outdoors Three, young Frankenstein, two straw dogs, two.

[02:57:56.910 --> 02:57:57.990]
Glen Gary Glen Ross, two.

[02:57:58.290 --> 02:57:59.410]
Glen Gary Glen Hills got one.

[02:57:59.950 --> 02:58:00.930]
Until the end of the World One.

[02:58:01.050 --> 02:58:02.730]
And no votes yet for Requiem for Dreams.

[02:58:03.070 --> 02:58:04.210]
Maybe that's why we didn't put it on there.

[02:58:04.430 --> 02:58:06.370]
Well no, you know why I wouldn't want to watch that over and over again?

[02:58:06.490 --> 02:58:07.050]
It's too depressing.

[02:58:07.270 --> 02:58:07.430]
Right on.

[02:58:07.790 --> 02:58:10.570]
Dr. Strange Love and Wild Things have none yet.

[02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:12.250]
But the Requiem for Dream Don't Have It.

[02:58:12.250 --> 02:58:13.150]
It's a great movie.

[02:58:13.490 --> 02:58:16.230]
And it's the one that you will watch several times if you get it and we're like we are.

[02:58:16.470 --> 02:58:18.390]
But you don't want to see it like over and over again.

[02:58:18.390 --> 02:58:20.790]
Because it might just make you want to throw your brains out.

[02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:21.950]
Or just blow.

[02:58:22.290 --> 02:58:26.230]
Or keep checking like on your inside of your elbow there to make sure that there's no purple haze.

[02:58:26.430 --> 02:58:27.170]
320 at the joint.

[02:58:27.590 --> 02:58:27.830]
And they're gone.

[02:58:27.830 --> 02:58:28.970]
Not bad. We've got over 300.

[02:58:29.230 --> 02:58:30.570]
Thanks for out here to mess baby.

[02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:31.950]
Mad Dog coming up next.

[02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.810]
Bye bye bye.

[02:58:33.310 --> 02:58:35.250]
Send me the Roger Show on Prices.

[02:58:35.610 --> 02:58:37.630]
The only QA has to buy it on me for Lardale.

[02:58:37.970 --> 02:58:38.870]
We'll Campbell and Raten.

[02:58:39.150 --> 02:58:39.510]
Yes!

[02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:40.290]
Yes!

[02:58:40.650 --> 02:58:41.430]
Yes!

[02:58:42.270 --> 02:58:42.510]
Absolutely.
