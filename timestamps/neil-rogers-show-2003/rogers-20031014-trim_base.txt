[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.660]
I gotta get out of me. He'll hang in there.

[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:02.680]
Don't be a dumb son.

[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.540]
You gotta get out of me.

[00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:03.900]
You know, right there.

[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.920]
These guys, these guys,

[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.260]
God, I was gonna give him an animal.

[00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:07.860]
When I said,

[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.200]
I'm gonna run over 10 o'clock.

[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.200]
Now, now they're all-

[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.220]
Everything was when you came out of here

[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.580]
and you said,

[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.060]
me, Kimba, that was my favorite.

[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.560]
Is that it?

[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.300]
I love it.

[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.260]
Hey, yo, let me ask you this.

[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.680]
I've had to sit in here now for two hours with Beast 2.

[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.560]
Using some of your vernacular hates me like poison.

[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.340]
Yeah, has he like,

[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.700]
poison?

[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.740]
No, he has.

[00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.020]
He's been afraid to.

[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.740]
I'm his best behavior.

[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.500]
Things are afraid I was gonna jump over the table.

[00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.260]
Hey, good, Kimba,

[00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.140]
I'm gonna walk in with your thumb, you know.

[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.360]
I, you know, you could, you could cut the,

[00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.780]
you know, the tension in here,

[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.480]
you could cut it with a butter knife.

[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.960]
You want to do something thick.

[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.800]
You want to do a tension,

[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.200]
but thick.

[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.340]
And you know what,

[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.040]
and you know what,

[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.420]
thick he is when I'm looking at Beast,

[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.760]
and then,

[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.060]
and thick just comes to my mind.

[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.700]
Yeah, he's scared,

[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:42.380]
he's a bit less of him,

[00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.240]
and that's how it is.

[00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.900]
But he hates you like,

[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.000]
still hates me like poison.

[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.540]
I'll walk out of the room

[00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.200]
and I'll feel the knife like that.

[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.240]
Someone else is taking your place.

[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.420]
All right, Neil.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.440]
What does that mean?

[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.700]
Somebody else is taking his place.

[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.180]
What the hell?

[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.760]
Is that new?

[00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.580]
Is that something new?

[00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.500]
He may not be good.

[00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.600]
He may be a fat pig,

[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.940]
but at least he's consistent, man.

[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.000]
That's what Clarence is.

[00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.140]
Oh.

[00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.340]
In fact, Clarence hired him

[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.180]
because he said he had a few openings at the station.

[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.900]
Hey, let's get him.

[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.260]
Let's get him.

[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.560]
Oh, it's a pleasure, Neil.

[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.920]
Thank you.

[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.400]
Neil Rogers.

[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.540]
God.

[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.360]
What the hell does that mean?

[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.000]
I went to an orgy at the county jail.

[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.740]
Looking for a bomb event.

[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700]
I could nail everyone's hoping and doing a thing.

[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.060]
We're all begging him.

[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.420]
He said we do that thing.

[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.340]
Well, that's fucking.

[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:35.640]
Never mind it.

[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.100]
That's fucking okay.

[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.620]
Making bodies all over the cell block.

[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.140]
We're banging at the jailhouse.

[00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.980]
Officer 47 was banging in May 3.

[00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.560]
They were the cutest couple that I ever seen.

[00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.460]
This one in May was hiding me with a twig.

[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.020]
She said, come over here.

[00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.460]
So I can make it my bitch.

[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.080]
So let's fuck everybody.

[00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.640]
Let's fuck everybody.

[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.500]
Making bodies in the cell block.

[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.080]
We're banging at the jailhouse.

[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.700]
This one officer was standing all alone.

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.620]
And the soldier's pocket was hard to stone.

[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.180]
The war is end-biting.

[00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.300]
What you doing over there?

[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.920]
Bang yourself and in May.

[00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.360]
Quit whacking in that cell.

[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.840]
Let's fuck everybody.

[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.040]
Let's fuck.

[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.740]
Making bodies in the cell block.

[00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.240]
We're banging at the jailhouse.

[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.640]
Fuck.

[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.000]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.900]
Here we go again.

[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.520]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.420]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.500]
He can't control himself.

[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.320]
Anyway, we got some bad news for the rush fans momentarily.

[00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.880]
But anyway, before we get to that,

[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.760]
well, this is probably going to even be worse news

[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.680]
when we read the poll result.

[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.920]
Let's put it off for a second.

[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.500]
Because they're under a lot of stress.

[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.140]
Even he's under enormous stress.

[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.840]
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.020]
Me Kimba.

[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920]
Good man, Kimba.

[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.680]
Kimba, and he better say it's a good guy.

[00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.000]
We could not have liked the both thing.

[00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.900]
I like Kimba a lot better.

[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:01.580]
Me Kimba.

[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.980]
Kimba, little gay.

[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.180]
Everybody did it to him together.

[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.400]
No.

[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.180]
He likes to dress up in that windows.

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.900]
He's one of her.

[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.640]
You have never seen her?

[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:08.580]
I heard she was fat.

[00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.240]
She's fat and she sounds just like she looks.

[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.800]
And she looks just like she sounds.

[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.760]
Real butch and dahi looking.

[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.180]
Me Kimba.

[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.300]
Me a redwood tree.

[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.260]
In fact, even worse than Anacorn O'Holio.

[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.800]
At least Anacorn O'Holio is attractive as opposed to Kimba, who looks like a man who

[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.840]
just can't find her way through his way.

[00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.900]
Anyway, anybody know his canvas still on Zeta?

[00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.040]
We haven't reported that yet.

[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.900]
Come on, someone will call.

[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.200]
Someone will call.

[00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.460]
WDQA, I'm Zeta Lyne.

[00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.060]
Hello.

[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.180]

[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.420]
What is it?

[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.880]
Yeah, I'm trying to read Zach.

[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.660]
Try to read Zach.

[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.340]
Right.

[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.620]
Zach who?

[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.480]
Zach retailer.

[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.100]
Zach retailer?

[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.600]
Zach retailer?

[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.740]
Yeah.

[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.060]
William Henry Harrison is.

[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.320]

[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.320]
He'll be right with it.

[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.080]
What the hell was that?

[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.720]
Reverend Jones.

[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.660]
Huh?

[00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.560]
No, it wasn't.

[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.000]
Yes it was.

[00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.620]
You think everybody's reverend Jones.

[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.100]
What was that?

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.440]
What?

[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.620]
What?

[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.160]
I told Rush to pop a big one.

[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.540]
He did.

[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.020]
Oh, we got some bad news.

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.880]
Nobody knows who this is so I guess that makes it much less bad news.

[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.640]
Florence Stanley died.

[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.140]
You died?

[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.060]
Who do that is?

[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:20.800]
You do?

[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.200]
Sure.

[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.800]
Bernice.

[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.860]
Gravely voiced, stage and TV actress best known as Bernice.

[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.360]
She died?

[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.480]
The wife of Detective Phil Fish Abe Bogota on Barney Miller.

[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.340]
See, I never watched Barney Miller, I hated that show.

[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.900]
That was all right.

[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.240]
There's certain there was a whole genre of those show.

[00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.980]
I mean, just dozens of those like, what was the three's company?

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.200]
I shouldn't say that, Christopher.

[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.880]
I remember to just die to all of those.

[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.480]
Horrible.

[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.700]
Yeah.

[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.360]
What was the one with Pat Harrington?

[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.040]
What was the one with Pat Harrington where he played the janitor?

[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.340]
One day at a time.

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.700]
Bonnie Franklin?

[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:54.080]
Okay.

[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.540]
Yeah.

[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.320]
Is that what was that?

[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.140]
One day at a time.

[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.380]
Yeah.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.300]
Oh crap.

[00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:58.840]
Good, golly Miss Molly.

[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.380]
How could anybody watch those shows?

[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.240]
Where were they from like the late 70s?

[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.780]
Because Bonnie Franklin never wore a brawn.

[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.580]
Welcome back.

[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.420]
Welcome back.

[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.420]

[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.160]
I did watch the one with Kirk Cameron, because he was cute, but that was horrible.

[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.560]
And I didn't watch that show.

[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.060]
Nine days.

[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.780]
What was the one?

[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.600]
Growing pains or something?

[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.300]
Growing pains.

[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.140]
I got it right.

[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.440]
I got it right.

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.640]
I got it right right at the time.

[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.680]
I saw him grow.

[00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.800]
But he was born again, Kristen, Kirk Cameron.

[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:20.620]
Growing pains?

[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.140]
He was growing it.

[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.240]
Anyway, she was on Barnie Miller.

[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.560]
Also, I had regular roles on my two dads and nurse.

[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.660]
And she appeared in films like Outrageous Fortune, Up That On Stere case in Atlanta,

[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:32.440]
the Lost Empire.

[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:33.120]
She died.

[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.620]
October 3rd.

[00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.160]
Well, this is a little bit late coming, I guess.

[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.020]
Better late than ever.

[00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.720]
October 3rd from complications of a stroke in Los Angeles at age 79.

[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.380]
He died.

[00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.860]
Florence Stanley is dead.

[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.380]
Damn it.

[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.580]
Been a bad year for dead celebrities.

[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.300]
I'll tell you that.

[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.980]
You know what I mean, Mom?

[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.420]
Absolutely.

[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.200]
Brother, I watched my backside.

[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.820]
Oh, I like this story before we get to all the rush stuff.

[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.560]
We got a lot more rush stuff to a lot of fish to fry.

[00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:55.660]
Why don't you have to rush through it?

[00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.100]
WDQM Kimberline.

[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.380]
Yes, Kimber update.

[00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.160]
Yes.

[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.380]
He does eight to midnight on light 101.5.

[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.040]
What, he's on light?

[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.580]
Yep.

[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.920]
He's a little bit heavy to be on light, ain't you?

[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.540]
That's it.

[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.140]
Okay.

[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.160]
Thanks for the good news, Pallie.

[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.840]
Yes, he's off his head, and she's on light, which is a W-Y-F, right?

[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.980]
That's Lush 101.5.

[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.740]
Slush.

[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.780]
Me Kimber.

[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.460]
She probably had a tone down a little bit, because we used to use on Zeta when we were playing

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.260]
like classic rock.

[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.580]
She would be like, me Kimber.

[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.060]
You douchebag.

[00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.920]
Yeah, that kind of thing.

[00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:28.300]
Very, very butch.

[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.000]
Even butcher than Randy.

[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.400]
Wow.

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.320]
Do you believe that Randy and Jim are getting into work?

[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.580]
Did you hear that scuttle about the other day?

[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:34.200]
Did we get here?

[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.940]
No, we're married.

[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.880]
Huh?

[00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.500]
I didn't know they had actually gotten married.

[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.900]
Oh, yes.

[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.700]
A long time ago.

[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.420]
Don't you keep track of these things?

[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.120]
Yeah, right.

[00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.160]
Wait till you hear this story, you like this.

[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:46.480]
Tremendman charged with teaching dog Hitler salute.

[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.100]
All right.

[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.300]
This is a, that it works.

[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.360]
Story from the Brit newspaper Ananova.

[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.420]
A German man is to appear in court charged with teaching his dog to give the Hitler salute.

[00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:59.100]
I guess he was just trying to be a good American.

[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.560]
The black sheep dog mixed named Adolf has been talked to lift his right front paws straight

[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.680]
up in salute on command.

[00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.980]
Kind of like a president.

[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.180]
I don't think.

[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.320]
What's speaking about president?

[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:11.600]
We got a great new Russia card, not a cartoon, a thing.

[00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:13.120]
On our website.

[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:13.760]
An advertisement.

[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.320]
An ad for Russia.

[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.100]
She's peddling something.

[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:16.420]
Okay.

[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.240]
Anybody want to buy a couple?

[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.260]
I'll take 300 little blue.

[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.200]
Police were called to the scene in Berlin where Roland T. 54 shouted at Passers-Bilance

[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:25.520]
year.

[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.080]
When a patrol arrived, he allegedly showed them the tricky it taught his dog, gave

[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.700]
the salute along with Adolf and shouted, Seaghal.

[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.440]
Come to find out it was a rumsfeld.

[00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:37.700]
Wouldn't surprise me.

[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.380]
Now he's been charged with using symbols of unconstitutional organizations.

[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.820]
If found guilty, he faces up the three years in prison, in the slamer.

[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.320]
Adolf will probably be brought to a pet shelter, the Berliner courier reports.

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.000]
Carola Ruff, of the local animal protection organization, says that I shouldn't be just

[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.140]
for what it's owner-todd it.

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:00.340]
It makes me sick to think someone's using a dog's an instrument of the deranged brain.

[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:01.920]
She told the paper.

[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.740]
How do you like that?

[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.400]
Oh, here's another one.

[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.380]
I got a, I got a, oh, look at all these great stories on Ananova.

[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.160]
Related stories, pizza delivery driver, fine for spitting and salad.

[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.820]
Smelly feet, man.

[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.500]
Smelly feet, man, did not access the library.

[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.660]
May start new life in Germany.

[00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:20.800]
Oh, good.

[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.660]
During the break, I got to get those two.

[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.220]
That's excellent.

[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.740]
Also, let's do the poor result first.

[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.900]
Oh, Reverend Jones is on six again.

[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.440]
Do you need mental health today?

[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.420]
He's coming back, baby, it's time to double down.

[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.660]
Okay, here's the, 1952 votes on a poll.

[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.840]
What's your take on, what was that Reverend Jones doing, Mitch Hirsch?

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.300]
I'd like to see that pay to see that.

[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.200]
Especially if he stuck his foot in the chair.

[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.520]
Welcome.

[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.920]
What's your take on a Rush Limbaugh drug edition story?

[00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.700]
1952 votes.

[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.720]
It's not an all-time market, I don't think, but it sure, it sure gives the alien days

[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.560]
to run for the money, right?

[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.280]
It's respectable.

[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.540]
It is respectable.

[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.420]
It's phenomenal.

[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.260]
Nearly 2000 votes.

[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.560]
Anyway, Rush, 910 people said he's a big fat hypocrite.

[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.320]
Always knew he was full of Schmidt, 578.

[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.260]
I hope he never comes back, 205.

[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.260]
So you see, it's not looking really, hey, Rush, paper or plastic, 78.

[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.580]
Now we do have three positive categories, but they kind of like sucked the wind.

[00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.060]
I feel very sorry for him, 72.

[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.720]
I'm still a dittohead, 57.

[00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.140]
And Rush is God, 52.

[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.760]
You add those three categories and you get, let's see, 9.1%.

[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:47.200]
So 9% say, oh, poor Rush, and 91% say, up yours.

[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.800]
Oh, my disgusting fat, hateful pig.

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.540]
You piece of crap, you hypocrite, you poor popping, you piece of turd.

[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.500]
So take a look at the picture on eorages.com.

[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.800]
There I think you'll be mighty impressed.

[00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.120]
Got more real bad news for the Rush fans because there could be a rush to say,

[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.960]
goodbye to that show, at least until he may make a comeback.

[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.200]
I think one of the most heart wrenching things I've ever seen in my life.

[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.120]
Of course, anytime I look at I'ma sonner, it's heart rates got wrenching.

[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.620]
Was listening to him this morning talking about Rush?

[00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:16.280]
Yeah.

[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.120]
And about his own problems, his booze problems and about how it's turned used to bring in a bottle of vodka.

[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.280]
Yeah, every time I'm so he'd invite him to come in the studio and he'd whip out a bottle of vodka.

[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.540]
Yeah, I'd brought him to it.

[00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:31.100]
And he'd hold it up in the air, we'd be like if I was there and you were holding up like a container of fish food.

[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.340]
Or I'd be totally cool.

[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.740]
Yeah, exactly.

[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.080]
Well, that's how it's firm.

[00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:38.080]
Poor I'ma, of course, how can you be cruel to a dead man?

[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:38.840]
That's a good question.

[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:41.860]
Anyway, so there was, and not feeling too sympathetic at all.

[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:47.920]
And he was talking about the fact that these rehab things, the success rate is extraordinarily low.

[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.340]
Okay, we don't want to wish you put a pox on Rush before he even starts doing.

[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:57.140]
But the success rate on the recovery rate is very, very slim, almost nonexistent.

[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:03.680]
Just a very small handful of reading dedicated people who go in there buying the bull crap, buying the 12 steps and the 13 goo steps.

[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:04.540]
Those are the ones.

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.000]
Of course, he should be a little ahead of the game because he's already got several goo steps to start, right?

[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:08.320]
Right.

[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.460]
So that might give him like a heads up, a head start.

[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.260]
Look at that 1958, if we drank that out long enough, we'd get to 2000, but we better not.

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.320]
Wouldn't that be something?

[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.720]
We could do it, but of course we did it with anything.

[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:21.300]
Let's do that.

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.560]
Let's leave it on here for a while.

[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.580]
I won't give the new pool.

[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.780]
Well, I can't give the new pool, but we don't have to put it on here.

[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.160]
Don't put it on the new one on until we get 2000, Eric.

[00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:29.460]
We got 1958.

[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:30.820]
Just for fun.

[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.180]
Just for the hell of it.

[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.100]
Not for any particular reason.

[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.520]
Let me say it again, by the way, very emphatically, for Rala's sick, he's out of the weather.

[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:37.340]
He's got the crud.

[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:43.260]
So anybody that's like a spewing crap about the, wow, you know, these not going anywhere.

[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:43.960]
Okay.

[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:44.960]
Yeah.

[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.820]
1013 at 560, WDQYM.

[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.800]
Hey, let me tell you right now, if you want to lose the weight, I got two great fat stories today.

[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.880]
Americans getting fatter than ever and all this other stuff too.

[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:55.440]
But fat.

[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:56.120]
Yeah.

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.260]
So more and more people, you are very desperate to lose it because you'd like to stay alive.

[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.820]
Number one, maybe you'd like to look a little bit better and put on some real clothing instead of pup pants.

[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.380]
Fatboy was in there this morning as disgusting as ever.

[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.420]
So there's a classic example of what you don't want to be as fatboy.

[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.360]
Hi, a pally.

[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.360]
So try and balance for life because it's getting great results for people, even the disgusting beast.

[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.500]
He's still disgusting, but not as fat and disgusting as he used to be.

[00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.400]
There's no calorie counting, no carb counting, nothing to worry about.

[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.460]
Don't even have to go shopping because they deliver right to your dough.

[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.060]
A black sack every morning, the key to your losing weight is in your black sack, man.

[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:34.820]
Three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, right in that sack, and plenty of fresh delicious stuff to keep you happy all day long and full.

[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.900]
So you won't be cheating on your program.

[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.940]
In fact, balance for life is the only company that lets you pick between two choices for each meal on the program.

[00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:44.760]
And not only that, but the food is like real stuff.

[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.820]
Nothing frozen, no chemicals, no additives.

[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.780]
It's not a chemical feast for a beast.

[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.100]
So let balance for life.

[00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.940]

[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:14.080]
My name is Michael and look all this is Fort Real by 60.

[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.860]
We wait in way.

[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.820]
Our David's a bitch.

[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.000]
This week on Lifetime, television for women.

[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.500]
Monday, it's the classic and brutally honest landmark film, My Breast.

[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:31.600]
Tuesday, it's the award-winning documentary, My Other Breast.

[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.380]
Wednesday, it's the lifetime original feature film, The Breast I mentioned before.

[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:43.100]
Thursday, see a repeat showing of Joanne Stark's feminine masterpiece, Both My Breasts.

[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:49.500]
And Friday finishes off the week with the Made for Television movie, My vagina, from a breast perspective.

[00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:57.080]
That's all week long on Lifetime, Television for Women, because even television for women is still programmed by a man.

[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.600]
What the obvious question is, how many real breasts are left in the world?

[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:01.580]
About 30, man.

[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.000]
1016-560 W.I.

[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.700]
I guess that does make any difference, no more, huh?

[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.680]
No, as long as they look good.

[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.680]
As long as they look good and feel good enough, as long as they're not melting in your hands.

[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.400]
Not too hard.

[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:22.660]
1976 votes, we got 24 to go to get to the 2000 total, so while we're waiting for that, WBAL in Baltimore drops Rush Filens.

[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.480]
Oy!

[00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:33.620]
Almost immediately after Premier Radio never sent out to Rush Limbaugh, we'll be off the mic for five weeks while getting treatment for drug addiction.

[00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.180]
Affiliate WBAL in Baltimore, 50,000-wide giant.

[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:39.640]
Remember used to work there, did you know that?

[00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.380]
No, I didn't.

[00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:40.960]
Now you do?

[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.180]
I'm immediately forgetting that though.

[00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.220]
He was a superstar there.

[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:43.620]
Who?

[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.840]
What happened to him?

[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:51.960]
WBAL is dropping the Rush Limbaugh show from its noon to thrine away those Panthers, undefeated baby four points in three games, right Scott?

[00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:52.720]
That's right.

[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.520]
I'm right!

[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.660]
How about that Panthers?

[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.180]
Lee's got a tie last night against the marginal team, pretty weak.

[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.460]
They played great, but they couldn't stick the biscuit in the basket.

[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.160]
That was the problem.

[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.760]
Have you ever seen a Craig Locklin that does the color on their cap schemes?

[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:06.640]
No.

[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.920]
He is the biggest pansy, the biggest fruitcake.

[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:14.240]
He likes the powder, is nah, Wayne Gretzky likes the powder, is nah, he could put the biscuit in the basket.

[00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:15.500]
Where did they get this fruitcake?

[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:15.900]
Anyway.

[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:25.860]
The Rush Limbaugh show is being dropped from WBAL from its noon to thrine slot extend in Ship Franklin's local show, 9-1-30PM, and running Ron Smith from 1-30-6PM.

[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.640]
The station will carry Rush's fillings during the station's overnight rerun.

[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.320]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.740]
Well, everybody is, as they say in Yugoslavia, Gush Schlofen.

[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.980]
Jeff Bochant, WBAL station manager and program director tells radio business report while the decision was made.

[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.300]
He said Rush Limbaugh say one of her kind energy and there is no substitute. How do you like that?

[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.660]
Except no substitutes.

[00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.480]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:56.980]
He said our thought was if we are not going to have Rush on our air, then we are going to take a proven talk show.

[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:06.080]
A host put them on a radio station in our market, people are proven in the market, allowing our callers to talk about the issues that they care about, and to be honest with you, an easy decision for us.

[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:10.440]
If Rush were taking a week's vacation, it wouldn't be an issue. We certainly would clear the show with its guest host.

[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:17.500]
But we were told five weeks and five weeks is a long time and the all important fall book said Jeff.

[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:27.100]
He added WBAL will continue to pay its rights fees to Premier and we are going to continue to run the commercials as we are obligated to run the Noon to Three time period.

[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:35.300]
So we are just going to continue to live up to our end of the bargain. Just a matter of what is the right programming to run if we can't put Rush on over the long haul.

[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.340]
Any work from advertising on the move? We don't know if we can hand the money, we can have some cut in this throw.

[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.780]
We notified our advertisers late Friday to be honest at this point. Jeff said we have had no feedback yet, but it is still early in the game.

[00:16:54.420 --> 00:17:04.340]
Tom Sullivan from CheapChannels KFB Case Sacramento was filling in. Yesterday in today, he said he is known Rush for many years and expressed hope that all will go well for him.

[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:15.340]
From 90% of the battles submitting you have a problem. So he is already looked 90% of the problem. He said Roger Hedgecock from ClearChannels KOGOs San Diego is filling in on what stays today?

[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:25.880]
On Tuesday? No, 15th and 16th is Wednesday and Thursday. And Walter No Neck Williams on 1017 Friday. Remember Walter Boughton O Neck Williams played for their Indians and White Socks?

[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:34.520]
Now, do we have 2000 yet? Overget in there. 1981.

[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.720]
What was he working in 1981?

[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.140]
I'm most frustrated. Oh, now it's starting to get all, it's getting slower. You want to watch because they are jamming on there now.

[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:47.020]
They are pouring into votes. They hate you Rush. Here we go.

[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:52.040]
1982. What? That's the year I graduated.

[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.360]
1982. I was at WNWS doing old Yinter Radio. What's the carcorder like that? We'll get to him in momentarily.

[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:01.960]
He's having that. We're looking for the old juvo.

[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:09.900]
1982. Now, let's see. I feel very sorry for him. It's still behind Hey Rush paper or plastic by five votes.

[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:15.220]
Anyway, radio business report makes this observation in this thing and this news release.

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:21.860]
If one station can pull Rush for five weeks, others may follow. How do you like that?

[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:28.000]
Five weeks of down ratings can kill a book for any station. I mean, a book is only 12 weeks.

[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:32.380]
So that's almost 10. So many of the stations that clear Rush are clear channel owned.

[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.280]
What are they going to do? One G and disappointed with the lineup of replacements offered this suggestion.

[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:43.320]
If premier were smart, they should have gone after an Ann Coulter or a Dennis Miller or somebody with a really smelly box.

[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.260]
Somebody is going to be compelling and shake things up as what he said.

[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:53.540]
But they didn't. They brought in a lot of these bogus people, and nobody had ever heard of like Tom Sullivan, Roger Hedgecock, and Walter Noneck Williams.

[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.260]
And I'm sure Rush ain't too thrilled.

[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.820]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.900]
It's static about that or about being like put away somewhere where he can't get ahold of Wilma every day.

[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.480]
You know what I'm saying? Hey, Wilma, what have you got for me today?

[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.400]
Laughing about. He's still probably got to get ahold of Wilma.

[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.100]
You know, that wants those people around the inside to get more than they were on the outside.

[00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:17.320]
That's the rumors that I'm here just asked the governor ask governor Jeb 1986

[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.560]
1986 votes we need 14 more to get to 2000 I thought it would happen a little bit quicker than that

[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.380]
Didn't you maybe everybody there? I'm so ready voted in the camp vote again

[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:32.980]
That's all seized up and if you have the bad fortune of having like AOL well good luck then it's all too good

[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.140]
We hate AOL AOL is the N-T-L N-T-Cristoman

[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.180]
They are just obnoxious and useless and if you live within a 20 block radius of anybody else who's got AOL

[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:47.820]
You can't vote on our pool we'd have thousands and thousands of votes. They'd actually be like almost scientific

[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:49.620]
Well almost

[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.440]
But every day but we have a limited number of people I can vote they can see the results some of them can't even see the results

[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.680]
You know that I'll be dang. So AOL like I said illante Clisto

[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:05.260]
I can't be freaking again because this is getting a little bit ponderous now. You know me. I like to drag things out

[00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:09.320]
Especially if they look good, but in this particular case it's just

[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:14.680]
Come on. Let's go. Oh here we go. I think the big pushes on now. Maybe 1983. Yeah

[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:17.740]
1993 well

[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:22.380]
1993 you have little faith. How do you like that? So what you'd seven more one more

[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.920]
To get to 2000 votes which

[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.680]
Don't happen to help a lot of time on our pools because like I just said

[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.380]
I'm not gonna

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:37.660]
It's only a limited small a psych group of people who can make these decisions shaping the future of mankind

[00:20:37.660 --> 00:20:41.800]
I will just just relax you. We got it

[00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.380]
I'll be right back again. We got the drum roll the goose step going out

[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.920]
Get that little dog from trimming it. They didn't let us stand anybody to get the boose step

[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.580]
Give me a one finger salute

[00:20:58.040 --> 00:20:58.400]
Okay

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:05.900]
Okay, it's taking a long time to do like I know I can't get it either. I don't say it. I want to see it with my own my own fries come on here

[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:12.120]
We go it's very very short. I got everybody. I guess everybody wanted to be the 2000s vote because they knew that the

[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.220]
2004tor will get that 10 million dollar prize from easy broadcasting

[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:22.860]
Huh, I wish I had a gun right on 2000, but it's 2000 or 2003 and you know what? Guess what year it is

[00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.260]
God

[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:26.960]
Ha, you see that

[00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:32.480]
What if I always told you on this show the way these things like like putting the pieces of a puzzle together

[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.880]
It's like sticking your arm up your ass

[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.860]
2003 that is so momentous and

[00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:43.020]
Hey rush paper of plastic still beat out. I feel sorry for them by three votes

[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:46.960]
What now which it was important to me. Thank you very much folks. That was lovely

[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.320]
Here's a call from derral hello

Hey, how's it going? Come here. Okay, sir if you were on a stand you were stranded on the desert island. Yeah, would you prefer

Clark stumps for presidential votes. Speaking of to eat good segue George Clark stumps for presidential votes at way to near this

[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.500]
Scott doesn't know see

[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:17.120]
Now you remember he was at the deli den a couple of weeks ago Wesley Clark for his first lower the appearance

[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:20.460]
Yeah, the scutzen out of town he won't know the significance of this oh well

[00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:28.020]
I hope that hangslessness. What? Whatever happened to the famous very good guest over it close close

[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:32.560]
Very close. You'll be amazed at how close you are the famous is out of business first and piece. That was the best

[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:39.220]
sunny isles beach democratic presidential hopeful Wesley Clark waited into the South Florida political landscape again yesterday

[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:44.400]
touting his party credentials by calling president bushes record reckless radical and wrong

[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:51.380]
The retired army general met several hundred enthusiastic supporters at I am embarrassed to say this at

[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:51.840]
oh

[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:58.060]
The rascal house a deli once frequented by singer Frank Sinatra

[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.440]
and a bunch of old Jews for stealing pickles and coleslaw's we speak for shoving him into sack

[00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:11.060]
hoisting himself up on a wooden chair Clark told the largely elderly Jewish audience

[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.820]
About his father's work as a local democratic party boss in Chicago

[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:17.500]
I mean, this is just amazing

[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:22.600]
Recalling his nearly 40 years in the military Clark said bushes first term let him to seek the presidency

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.380]
It hurts me greatly when I look around this great country

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.160]
And I see that all that I believed in is being unraveled Clark said there was no immediate comment Monday from the White House

[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:35.740]
Well, what what what is that to say they just jealous that he got the kishki right? I don't think they have kishki at the rascal house

[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:36.440]
Do they not?

[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:43.120]
Oh, not not all delis have kishka man. What how could you call it a deli then a Jewish deli if they don't have kishki

[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:48.960]
But that's a good question. We'll have to find out I'm sure Hank would know because he's still well

[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.740]
I'm not having to pick this in a while but then again Hank touts the most the other place he likes oh he likes Joe's

[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.580]
And he also likes the the average I think

[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:04.980]
And all right New York Prime which I just and New York Prime and Polka really is great even though Moe is a

[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:10.200]
P.O. The man who's got his tail between his legs because they don't kiss his ass in earth the up near prime

[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.880]
Which everybody including the Humper says is one of the great state houses in history mankind

[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:20.300]
Moe don't like it because they just don't lay out the red carpet and kiss him on the cheeks and the lick his dingal berries do all of that stuff

[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:21.660]
They hate you Moe like everybody else

[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.160]
Clark battling a sore throat to the crowd losing your voice

[00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.000]
I guess is the first thing that happens you when you start to run for orifice

[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:31.020]
They told me the second thing is to start to lose your handshake

[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.380]
Maybe that was the excuse for his limp rusted rip

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:38.120]
For a general man. I'm afraid to ask what the third thing is

[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.820]

Carpe and of course. I'm sure they all went. I ve is he on comedian. No what

[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:23.760]
With Tony Orlando

[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:26.740]
In the poke nose

[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.560]
Let's go if I get your teeth this time

[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:30.800]
I know I got my teeth in the little bag with the water

[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.500]
And the evidence

[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.080]
1033 at 560 WQM

[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.260]
I guess Wesley Clark is

[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.480]
If he can't become president

[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.280]
He just wants to get some good deli along the way

[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.140]
Maybe that's it

[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.360]
All right, why is he going there

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.740]
Maybe he's had some bad advice

[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.960]
Maybe he's got bad advisors

[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.680]
Here's the final

[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.840]
Well, let me just read this first

[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.120]
From our buddy in Cleveland

[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.960]
Says I find it so funny to listen to the right wing

[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:54.900]
Apologies for rush

[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.100]
He has so much pain from his back and neck problems

[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.580]
That's why he got addicted

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.440]
It almost every clip they show him is on the golf course

[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:03.360]
I guess the pain leaves when he swings the golf club

[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.060]
And then maybe when he pops a couple of teeth

[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.320]
Sure

[00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.120]
More of a straight out

[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.060]
Couple hundred

[00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:10.500]
I also love how he admitted to being addicted to quote

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.300]
Medication instead of using the word

[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:13.140]
Drugs

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.200]
Drugs

[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.820]
Drugs

[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.140]
That's right

[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:16.680]
Medication sounds so sanitary

[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.000]
You know

[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.860]
That's what Sarasad

[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:19.140]
It's like saying it's like saying

[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:20.200]
Drugs instead of ass

[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.780]
Same thought

[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:21.640]
Drugave him to him

[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.960]
Right from a doctor

[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.620]
I mean, OxyContin is not even what they do

[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:26.740]
Call the hillbilly heroine

[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.160]
And who would rush your relate to

[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.280]
Better than the hillbilly

[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.200]
Is it good on redneck

[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.180]
So that's his crowd

[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.600]
So here's the final Italian from the poll

[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.720]
2019 votes

[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.720]
I'm saving this one Eric

[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.960]
This is a keeper

[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.720]
A frame

[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:41.480]
2019

[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:44.820]
What's your take on a rush limbaugh drug edition story

[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.840]
He's a big

[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:47.580]
Big fat hypocrite

[00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.340]
940

[00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:51.080]
I always knew he was full of schmit 595

[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:52.460]
Well, I'd like to really say the word

[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.760]
You know

[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.480]
I hope he never comes back to 18

[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.840]
Hey rush

[00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.300]
Paper or plastic

[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.560]
You big fat spastic 81

[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.280]
I feel very sorry for him 75

[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.400]
I'm still a ditto head 58

[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.580]
And rush is God 52

[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:09.060]
So God's a drug addict

[00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:10.340]
That explains a lot of things, you know

[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.040]
Sure

[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.220]
Maybe that maybe that's why the world is in the shape

[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.100]
I think we just discovered a secret of the uh

[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:15.880]
Problems in the world

[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.280]
Maybe God does most cannabis

[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.780]
Yeah, that could be it. He's a junkie

[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.220]
2019 now. Let's see 6.5

[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:28.240]
You that's interesting because it come out

[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.020]
9% exactly I mean right on the money 91%

[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.540]
For rush and 9% oh

[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:38.240]
I'm poor and that's the Robert Creeper factor again, right?

[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:40.560]
Because Robert Creepers the one who said

[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:43.680]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe Robert creeped it

[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.080]
He's Robert the main time

[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.980]
Quit saying yeah, yeah, quit doing it Robert

[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:51.000]
You little fascist to self-hating you bastard you idiot you

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]
How safe an act

[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.860]
I'm putting that over my creeper keeper pool

[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.560]
So let's get some more names for this real pool here for our uh so-called comedians

[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.960]
Dennis Miller and Tom Arnold are duke and uh I don't know who Chris Tucker is

[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.100]
Um, I'm trying to think if there he did those movies with we know his father Chan

[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.200]
Yes, yeah

[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.860]
But that hot buddy movie with Jackie Chan the couple of them

[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.580]
Cop buddy movie well

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:20.420]
Yeah, that's what they call them. I realized that was these John Ruck you know who Jacky Chan is right no, I don't

[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.240]
That's something

[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.100]
That's you know that no, I don't watch cop buddy movies. I'm sorry. No me either

[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:31.600]
In fact the Erica Strata cured me of that you're looking to the ads for them. No, I've never seen

[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.500]
I don't know Jackie Chan. I don't know I know Charlie black man. I know Charlie Chan

[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.680]
I know a lot of spastic black people okay many of them call us they high boys

[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:44.760]
And they said I'm working our station too like Troy Stratford who hasn't got a new piece of copy since before

[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.920]
Bill uh, called her was a baby

[00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.620]
And then I'm just seeing how your mind works. I different things pop into your head

[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.780]
Bill called her and Troy Stratford. You know what they had in common nothing bald ah

[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:07.340]
Here's for a lottery. Hello. Yeah, hey Neil. Yes, sir. I was uh watching the dolphin came on Sunday and listening to the QAM broadcast at the same time

[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:14.440]
Absolutely, you know so I can hear the mad dog right and I just couldn't believe the screw-up job that your friend moated

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.180]
Oh excellent. This is some of the best news of the week already. All right. Let me say what happened

[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:22.100]
Sometime in the second quarter this running back named Fred Taylor. He gets hurt

[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.580]
So they put in a guy named Tofield

[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:31.160]
And Tofield plays the rest of the second quarter and in the third quarter Taylor's back in the game

[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.160]
Well every time Taylor runs the ball he calls him Tofield and this is

[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.360]
Exactly this goes on and on and on and on

[00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:43.280]
Finally he realizes that Taylor's in the game because he's

[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:48.240]
He's in the back of the jersey right so he says Jason Taylor made the tackle

[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:54.300]
Oh, no, I mean it was unbelievable Jason Taylor wasn't this guy even get his Taylor straight now

[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:58.180]
He doesn't know who has to be a father of chuckered pantsy words. You know he goes through a bad Taylor

[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.400]
He doesn't have a clue of what's going on now

[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.240]
Absolutely. I always just say

[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.600]
Thanks for the good news man. That's the best news like I said in the whole week

[00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.800]
The checks in the mail sent him 10 million to okay

[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:16.360]
Don't go don't go away all the beesleaves money economy in good condition now 44% a year from now 64% all the optimists are out there

[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:20.520]
That's the way to see an end pull the bush approval rating went up a little bit. I got that story

[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.660]

They just showed a clip of him because they were showing the CEO on the game. Did he mention my name?

[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:08.760]

OK.

[00:38:57.040 --> 00:38:58.300]
I want to try a little experiment.

[00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:58.940]
A experiment?

[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.020]
Here's the cruel springs.

[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:01.320]
Hello.

[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:02.940]
Hello, Neil.

[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:03.740]
Yes, sir.

[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.560]
Long time first time, how you doing?

[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:06.200]
All right.

[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.020]
I got some great names for your list.

[00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.080]
My female choice is whoopee.

[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.840]
And my male choice is Robin Williams.

[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.260]
Oh, excellent.

[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.300]
All right.

[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.900]
I think Robin Williams used to be funny about 30 years ago,

[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:18.200]
you know?

[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.280]
He's so ugly.

[00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.300]
I'm just a man to him.

[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:20.920]
Yeah.

[00:39:21.260 --> 00:39:22.200]
Two good choices, man.

[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:22.660]
Thanks.

[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.380]
Hi, thanks, bud.

[00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:24.040]
See you.

[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:24.760]
OK.

[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.000]
We got the whoopee goldberg.

[00:39:26.220 --> 00:39:27.800]
Oh, she gives me the willy's, man.

[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.840]
She just, I'm sorry.

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.480]
The roster locks just I can't deal with it.

[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.460]
Does that make me a bad guy?

[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:32.760]
No.

[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:33.660]
Does it make me prejudice?

[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.040]
Yes.

[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.060]
Robin Williams and whoopee goldberg.

[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.300]
OK.

[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:39.080]
We'll have a list of about 100 here.

[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:39.660]
I guarantee you.

[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.120]
Here's a call from Miami.

[00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:42.480]
Hello.

[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:44.380]
Hello.

[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.460]
Miami, yes, sir.

[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:46.360]
Hi.

[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.060]
How are you doing, Neil?

[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:47.940]
Pretty good.

[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.340]
Hey, I'll guide me to the punch.

[00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:51.600]
I was going to the desk.

[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.640]
We'll be goldberg also.

[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:54.720]
OK.

[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.420]
So, anyway, I just want to make that the desk.

[00:39:57.540 --> 00:39:58.380]
And I appreciate you calling.

[00:39:58.380 --> 00:39:58.920]
Stole your thunder.

[00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.780]
OK, thanks, Palli.

[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:00.540]
Have a great day.

[00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.200]
Must have been a psychic thing, don't you think?

[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:02.340]
No.

[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:06.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a 8 TNT.

[00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.340]
Who's what's so-called committing to think is the least funny?

[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.380]
Now, let me just try this, OK?

[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.500]
I mean, I don't imagine John Records' land decarol.

[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:17.740]
But we probably have some people from Chicago, huh?

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:19.760]
We must have, because we had all those phony cup fans

[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.480]
in the stands there.

[00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:21.940]
And I don't care what anybody says.

[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.120]
Remember the caller the other day said

[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.020]
that they weren't any cup fans in the stands over the weekend?

[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.500]
That was a bunch of crap.

[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.900]
I saw all the parts, especially Friday and Saturday.

[00:40:29.940 --> 00:40:32.140]
There was more cup fans there, and you can shake your wicket.

[00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.700]
Now, let's see how this is going to sound, OK?

[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.200]
All right.

[00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:36.400]
And it's going to work.

[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:37.960]
Trust me, my real one player.

[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.860]
And could let me go.

[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:39.280]
Oh!

[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:42.180]
Oh!

[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:43.240]

[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.100]
I am the leader!

[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.160]
I'm holding this thing in my hand.

[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.120]
No, no.

[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.600]
No, no, no.

[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.940]
John Records' land decarol.

[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.080]
You will as he was the credit.

[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:55.260]
Oh, it's all as you need to know the wind.

[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.540]
Now, if you can hear the bass in my speakers,

[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:06.360]
I'm very, you hear it loud and dark.

[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.040]
OK.

[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:08.880]
OK, now how does that sound?

[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:09.540]
Loud and TNT.

[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:10.980]
Really?

[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.480]
I mean, it ain't bad, but it ain't good, either.

[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:17.900]
Not like other things that you play from the proper places.

[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:20.800]
Well, no, I understand that, but I'm doing it over the mic.

[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.840]
I'm holding up a speaker.

[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:22.660]
Oh, no, no, no, no.

[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.300]
We don't have wired into the board.

[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.380]
Are you crazy?

[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:27.340]
Are you some kind of a lunatic?

[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:27.760]
Yes.

[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.480]
The things that we're going to go to such great lengths

[00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.400]
to do something like that.

[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:33.560]
I could probably call one of the engineers up here,

[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.620]
one of our friends who set this studio up in the first place

[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.100]
and had them come out here without them even knowing it down there

[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.460]
and say, hey, I'll take you here.

[00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:40.280]
I hear 50 bucks.

[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:41.480]
Look at these.

[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:43.180]
Oh, it's five minutes, five minutes of work.

[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.340]
Right, five minute job.

[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.440]
Stick a wire in there and put the...

[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:47.000]
So it didn't sound...

[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.080]
Try not to wait about that.

[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:50.920]
It's fine for effect if you want to make a point to where I something.

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:52.260]
What do you mean by that?

[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:54.100]
Like another word, if you just say, hey...

[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:54.100]

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:54.480]
Yeah.

[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.640]
No, because I was going to play like the Tanner stuff

[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.940]
and then enjoy Reynolds crap.

[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.500]
How's that?

[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:00.980]
Is that better?

[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:02.480]
What do I...

[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:03.800]
Let's say I'm weak.

[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.460]
Is that better?

[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:12.100]
Probably sounds better than most people's radio anyway.

[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:12.660]
Oh, there you go.

[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.420]
How do you like that?

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:15.720]
See, especially on our great...

[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.060]
AM signal, although we are now.

[00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:17.640]
What is it?

[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.340]
Are we HD, EV radio?

[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:19.940]
Digital, man.

[00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:20.920]
Were it digital?

[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.900]
Is anybody in sound-phone have a digital radio?

[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.300]
No.

[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.780]
No, but man, it would sound really great.

[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.600]
How it sound just like Westbrook fan 4, he's in George

[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.840]
would sound like Walter Cronkite if he just had the right radio.

[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.320]
Absolutely.

[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.700]
Let's say J-Morr, M-O-R-H.

[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.720]
M-O-H-R.

[00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:37.440]
Well, I'm not sure if I'm right.

[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:38.380]
Well, I got it spelled wrong.

[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.560]
Okay, well, I got the right letters.

[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:40.780]
She's just got them in a wrong order.

[00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.280]
This is Lewin Westl Ray.

[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:43.640]
Or somewhere.

[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.120]
J-Morr, M-O-R-H-R.

[00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:46.960]
I don't know who that is either.

[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.780]
I don't know who anybody is.

[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:48.460]
It's this guy.

[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.720]
Is so not effing funny.

[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.400]
It says, please add that no talent,

[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:53.620]
turd-f-ha-ha-ha.

[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.160]
Turd-fomer to your pole.

[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:56.780]
He's my hero.

[00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:57.500]
Turd-fomer.

[00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.300]
I didn't know that.

[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.280]
And he's not funny.

[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.420]
PS, I thought I did tons of drugs, as Lew,

[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.740]
until I heard about all the oxy's blimbo-limp noodle bought.

[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.660]
Jesus, was he dealing or something?

[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:10.060]
No, he was just having a good time.

[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.120]
He was just feeling mighty good.

[00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.660]
Okay, look, a good old right-winger should.

[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:15.340]
Because he didn't listen to Nancy Reagan.

[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.320]
He didn't just say, no, he didn't say no.

[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.120]
He said, yes, please.

[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:20.760]
I should read all those articles again and again and again.

[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.200]
Because everybody loves it.

[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:23.400]
Sure, just play the tape.

[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.180]
We don't want to pee on everybody's parade necessarily.

[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.300]
Okay, have you heard anybody on here that we'd want to hear?

[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:32.140]
Vwana Johnny?

[00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:33.860]
I can say, New Jersey.

[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:37.180]
How about Vwana Johnny for Scott there?

[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.420]
He probably don't even know who that is.

[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:39.880]
I don't want to hear it.

[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:40.380]
Oh, got you.

[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:42.220]
How about the real Don Steal?

[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:43.420]
How about Charlie Tuna?

[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:44.520]
Sure.

[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:48.340]
Wolfman Jack from KXL, Why Is Spokane 1975?

[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.740]
Wolfman Jack from Spokane?

[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.480]
No, I want to hear that.

[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.860]
Because I used to listen to Spokane radio a lot, exclusively.

[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:54.720]
Well, why don't you want to hear it?

[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:55.180]
That invent cool.

[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:55.840]
I do want to hear it.

[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:56.500]
I want to hear that.

[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:57.300]
What do you do want to hear it?

[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.800]
Somebody that we've actually heard of.

[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.120]
You never heard a John Records land decor in Chicago?

[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:03.180]
Who the hell do you think you are?

[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:03.920]
WLS?

[00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:04.600]
A punk.

[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:05.680]
This will play.

[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:07.680]
If you have a play.

[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.220]
Otherwise, I'm going to have to, if it doesn't play, I'm going to have to, like, regroup.

[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.700]
We have regroup music for you, son.

[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:15.480]
Yeah.

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:16.940]
Good air check here.

[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.600]
What is this?

[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.660]
It's a American graffiti time with Wolfman Jack.

[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.120]
Yeah!

[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.160]
One, two, three, a clock, four o'clock rock.

[00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:31.620]
Five, six, nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock.

[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.500]
By the way, Bill Haley is still dead.

[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:36.740]
Is his hair still curly?

[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.360]
Oh, he still does have that spit curl.

[00:44:41.620 --> 00:44:42.420]
Johnny Depp.

[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.860]
Are we going to hear the whole record?

[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:47.760]
I hope, what is this?

[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.820]
Come on, get the air checkers in.

[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.920]
What you're just trying to do?

[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:55.480]
Let me move my little button ahead.

[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.520]
You move your butt ahead.

[00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.100]
Oh, I'm in the mood.

[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.740]
Oh, I'm in the mood.

[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.100]
Good luck with music, but we don't hear no Wolfman Joe.

[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.040]
You're dead.

[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.760]
Why is he just looking at me?

[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.220]
Like I said, it was a bad choice.

[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.760]
Okay, but that is going to work fine.

[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.340]
It'll be okay.

[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:18.520]
I mean, that's not real bad, does it?

[00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:18.860]
No.

[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:19.500]
Oh.

[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:22.560]
Now, they've got speakers instead of all that bull crap you tell me.

[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.820]
But, oh, you probably don't have any audio card net computers.

[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:25.660]
How did you tell you that?

[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.340]
You have no sound card.

[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.100]
I just said it all the time and I'm putting it off on you because that's what I was doing.

[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:33.800]
I said you had no sound mind.

[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:35.280]
Oh, well, that's for sure.

[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:36.040]
Look who I work for.

[00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.120]
Here's a call from Pompato.

[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:37.420]
Hello.

[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.400]
Pompato.

[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.400]
Can you believe that?

[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.980]
There's nobody in Pompato under the air.

[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:47.660]
There we go.

[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.640]
Yes, sir.

[00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.280]
Yeah.

[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.740]
What's wrong with my time for demo?

[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:54.880]
Okay, 5.67.

[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.880]
I hope he had a good time.

[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.000]
You think he was popping something?

[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:57.960]
I think so.

[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:58.920]
I think maybe they were sharing.

[00:45:59.320 --> 00:45:59.840]
5.67.

[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.740]
05.60.

[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.480]
Pompato.

[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:03.000]
60 on the 8.80.

[00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:05.080]
Oh, I know what I wanted to mention to you.

[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:05.460]
Yeah.

[00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:10.300]
Because last Friday when you were off Scott was blaming you for his own ineptitude.

[00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:11.060]
I was usual.

[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.120]
Because somebody said crap or something.

[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:13.700]
Mm-hmm.

[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.060]
And he said, oh, well George told me never hit the dump button.

[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.680]
I told him to stay away from things.

[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:18.640]
Yeah.

[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.520]
That's true.

[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.220]
I put that in.

[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.200]
Judges isn't necessarily a good idea when you're not there.

[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:24.020]
Him, him.

[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.160]
Because you should have seen the scene every time that anything questionable would come

[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.320]
up.

[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.140]
He scramble and ask me questions.

[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.160]
And I told him just calm down and leave decision making to other people.

[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:36.900]
I understand, but let me say it again.

[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.800]
When you're not there and when Miguel is there who's of course paying less than a

[00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:40.120]
attention.

[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:43.460]
Oh, it probably wasn't a really good idea to leave the instruction in his mind.

[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.340]
I probably should have spoken to Miguel about that then.

[00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:47.540]
Probably should have spoke to Miguel.

[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.100]
I thought I wasn't touching that button.

[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.380]
Jerry Seinfeld.

[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.000]
Now, because he'll start pressing all the time.

[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:52.300]
All the time.

[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:52.380]
All the time.

[00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:53.380]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:53.840]
One in double.

[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.900]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:55.260]
One in double.

[00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:55.520]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.520]

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.520]

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.520]

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.520]

[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:55.620]
One in double.

[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.820]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:57.020]
One in double.

[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.040]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:46:59.040 --> 00:46:59.660]
One in double.

[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.720]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:02.820]
One in double.

[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:08.020]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:08.780]
One in double.

[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:14.400]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.700]
One in double.

[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:19.720]
He'll end his buddy Scotchow.

[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:20.360]
One in double.

[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.440]
And Jane Moore and Jerry Seinfeld will be adding.

[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:24.620]
Bill and for Lauderdale.

[00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:25.380]
Oh, yeah.

[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.520]
She says,

[00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:29.940]
She says,

[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:29.940]

[00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:29.980]
She says,

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.320]
She says,

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:30.580]

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:30.580]

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:30.580]

[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:30.600]
She says,

[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:30.880]
She says,

[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:30.880]

[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:31.300]
She says,

[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:31.480]
She says,

[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:31.860]
She says,

[00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:32.140]
She says,

[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:32.580]
She says,

[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:33.300]
She says,

[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.180]
She says,

[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:34.420]
She says,

[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.600]
She says,

[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:37.720]
She says,

[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:38.840]
She says,

[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.760]
She says,

[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:40.940]
She says,

[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:12.400]
Ye

[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:12.420]
I

[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:14.660]
I

[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:19.200]
This is the night's best young woman of honor

[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.780]
Our real me on the east

[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:23.520]
This we talk about each time

[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:25.900]
It's a good day

[00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.540]
The real Tuesday

[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:30.080]
Oh man

[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.840]
I think we're calling this as T-Toy and I'm gonna have to

[00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:39.140]
I just picked up my 92 accord from your life

[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.460]
And it is on huge turd in the back seat

[00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:43.360]
Are you stirred?

[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:44.060]
Yes

[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.920]
And there's one who likes to see?

[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:51.220]
I'm stirred! A paper! A big ass human turd

[00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:52.760]
In the back seat of my car

[00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:56.120]
Ma'am, I assure you our guys did not take a dump in your car

[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.840]
If you want to bring that car back and we'll take a look at it

[00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.080]
You want to take a look at it?

[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.340]
My car is fine, it's that big ass turd in the back seat

[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:05.740]
Okay, what would you like me to do?

[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.080]
I said okay, come on, I'm going to your house and piss it low for you

[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.220]
Count how about that?

[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.740]
Ma'am, what would you like me to do to fix the situation?

[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.060]
I want somebody to come over here

[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:17.560]
Get this turd out my back seat

[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.980]
That's not gonna happen

[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.420]
What do you mean it's not gonna happen?

[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:22.620]
You can bring the car here and we can take a look at it

[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:25.040]
I am, I'm gonna bring it back there, you know what I'm gonna do?

[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.720]
I'm gonna take a dump in every last car you got there

[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.780]
I'm gonna pee on your counter

[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.340]
I'm gonna do it all

[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:32.920]
Okay

[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:34.020]
To show you how it feels

[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.680]
Okay

[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:36.560]
And you know what you said, I'm a big girl and man

[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.100]
It probably came out your ass

[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:40.820]
Oh yeah, I don't make it happen

[00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.380]
I'm gonna go on and take a dump in the car

[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:43.340]
I'm gonna tell you you wait

[00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.260]
Uh, about 400 pounds

[00:53:45.260 --> 00:53:46.260]
That's your turd

[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:47.440]
That's my turd

[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:47.640]
Yeah

[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:49.800]
That came up from a 400 pound man, huh?

[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.360]
That's a 400 pound man

[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.600]
Either that or gorilla

[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.060]
Okay

[00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.500]
I'm driving this car right to my lawyer's office

[00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:58.480]
And I'm gonna let the whole world see

[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:00.340]
You're gonna be on the news this evening buddy

[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:02.520]
I'm gonna get seven on my side

[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:04.120]
What? You're gonna be on the news

[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.640]
Can you describe the

[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:06.820]
The Jesus

[00:54:06.820 --> 00:54:08.100]
I mean, what does it look like?

[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.500]
You know what it is, it came out your ass

[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.740]
What the hell is it?

[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.460]
What kind of

[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:14.580]
Ask me what color

[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.320]
I say what?

[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.660]
It smells ungodly

[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.800]
That's what it smells like

[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:20.720]
It smells like you sold your ass to the devil

[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.840]
I don't even know if I'm gonna take the hell

[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:24.100]
Well how many is it?

[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:24.940]
How long is it?

[00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.740]
It's not as long as my arm

[00:54:26.740 --> 00:54:27.160]
Oh

[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.520]
I don't think it's fun

[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.000]
Why y'all this is not fun

[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.200]
I got a damn

[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.400]
Too far four and my back feet

[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.620]
You know I think this is racial sick too

[00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:38.780]
That's what this is

[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.060]
A little chance I'll run it away from it

[00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:50.120]
I'm glad y'all find this funny

[00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:51.700]
That's okay

[00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.960]
I want to go to your province

[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.160]
For the fair and wheel suit, don't you?

[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.240]
All right, all right

[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.960]
How long does it look like it's been sitting there?

[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.500]
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.440]
Steve, Steve is coming off of it?

[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:07.860]
Yes

[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:11.160]
Oh, it's been a long time

[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.800]
I'm glad you're here

[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.000]
How long is it, huh?

[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.100]
I am taking this as a fresh shirt

[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:17.960]
Okay

[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:22.060]
What you need to do is you need to bring that shirt back

[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:23.860]
And we'll match it up

[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.600]
We have a lineup

[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:28.420]
We'll match it up with the other shirts that we have

[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:31.620]
Well what you need to do is learn how to use a toy

[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:33.620]
You're saying I can bring the shirt back to me?

[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.220]
No

[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.460]
You know what?

[00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:36.240]
Is this the sample?

[00:55:36.620 --> 00:55:36.980]
No

[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.980]
I'm starting to like it

[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:40.900]
You're going to keep it under the back

[00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:41.920]
I'm going to keep it

[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.460]
Because it's a nice look

[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:44.180]
You know what?

[00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.000]
It's a nice conversation piece

[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:47.500]
Okay, cool

[00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:47.840]
Okay

[00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:48.540]
Thanks

[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:49.520]
All right, thanks

[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.800]
Now that's Wanda Sykes

[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:52.400]
Yeah

[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:52.820]
Yes

[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:55.640]
I mean that's an amusing bit

[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.600]
And a lot of people like that

[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:57.740]
But is she like funny?

[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.020]
No

[00:55:58.020 --> 00:55:58.880]
Sisha gets in both

[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:00.100]
Here's the facts

[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:03.760]
With somebody else's 80 Randi sends us his 50 top choices

[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.600]
Jay Leno, David Letterman, Ray Ramona

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:07.340]
Chris Rock

[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.000]
Rosie Gack O'Donnell and LMD Generate

[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.540]
Well let's put them all on there

[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.000]
What the heck

[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:13.800]
I wouldn't even have about a hundred

[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.400]
Chris Rock on there

[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:14.980]
What?

[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.220]
Chris Rock is a life riot

[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:16.900]
And he uses the word

[00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:17.920]
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:18.920]
We're not asking you

[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:19.700]
I agree with you

[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:21.360]
But with Jack Eamation

[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:22.120]
I'm going to put on there

[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:22.800]
Somebody faxed

[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.300]
I think Jack Eamation is hysterical

[00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.480]
Even though he's been doing the same act for 50 years

[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.340]
He's still funny

[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.720]
It was funny in the 50s

[00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:29.840]
No he's still funny

[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.260]
He's still very funny guy

[00:56:31.260 --> 00:56:32.000]
Of course I don't see him

[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:32.840]
No, Moe, maybe that's why

[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:33.880]
It's compared to Moe

[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:35.980]
And we're just putting on the list

[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:36.820]
What the people say

[00:56:36.820 --> 00:56:37.280]
Not the

[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.920]
You're not going to be the little dictator there

[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:40.700]
Well, you know, you like Chris Rock

[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.220]
I think he's a hysterical too

[00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:43.500]
In little tidbits

[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.980]
He's not funny for like long stretches

[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:45.500]
You know what I mean

[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:46.940]
You've seen him in long stretches

[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:47.760]
No

[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.180]
Oh

[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.100]
I don't want to see him out

[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.100]
What the hell is that

[00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:54.980]
Oh my god, look at that

[00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:55.760]
I think that's alive

[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.580]
I just watered up that list at Randi's semi

[00:56:57.580 --> 00:56:59.600]
And now it's like unfolding on the floor

[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:00.160]
It's like moving

[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:00.980]
It's crawling around

[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:02.700]
Let's see

[00:57:02.700 --> 00:57:03.080]
Here you go

[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.100]
Rosie O'Donnell

[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:06.260]
And Ben Stein

[00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:08.100]
I was Ben Stein supposed to be a comedian

[00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.440]
He's not a comedian, is he?

[00:57:10.660 --> 00:57:11.180]
Yeah, well

[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.260]
I don't know how much stand-up comedy he's done

[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.500]
But he's supposed to be a comic

[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:15.780]
Ben Stein

[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:17.640]
I guess

[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.860]
And is in when Ben Stein's money

[00:57:19.860 --> 00:57:22.120]
That guy that right-wing us self-hating Jewish whole

[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:22.820]
Cleaner all

[00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:24.240]
Okay, put him on there

[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.000]
Okay, Ben Stein

[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.240]
He's about as funny as cancer of the rectum man

[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:29.500]
Now listen, I want to see if this is going to work

[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:31.120]
I don't know and maybe you'll remember some of this

[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:31.920]
And maybe you won't

[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:32.560]
All the way better take

[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.840]
Hold on, don't play it Neil, don't play it

[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.040]
I think the key is

[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:36.600]
Pause it

[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.580]
Oh, thank goodness

[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.580]
Because if I don't get the lady and Davy

[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.200]
I'll show her run away

[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.100]
Here's the lady and Davy

[00:57:43.220 --> 00:57:44.220]
Well, I have the wrong line

[00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:44.760]
Here's Miami

[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:46.160]
Hello

[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:46.940]
Hey Neil

[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:47.740]
Yes sir

[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:51.040]
I was wondering if he had Bob Sagitt on that list

[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.980]
Bob Sagitt

[00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:54.220]
That is a good choice, Bob Sagitt

[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:55.440]
Oh, he's terrible

[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.840]
Okay

[00:57:55.840 --> 00:57:58.440]
He finds himself very amusing by the way

[00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.120]
Oh, he does

[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:00.140]
That's better

[00:58:00.140 --> 00:58:01.200]
Good choice pal, thanks

[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:01.520]
Thanks

[00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:03.060]
Here's the lady and Davy right here

[00:58:03.060 --> 00:58:03.360]
Hello

[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:04.460]
Hello

[00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:05.340]
Yes man

[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:06.800]
Can you hear me?

[00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.780]
I hear you just like you run the phone, right?

[00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:09.280]
Do you hear me?

[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.160]
Very good

[00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:10.460]
Excellent

[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:11.600]
I fell on his dime

[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:12.900]
So I'm going to make this quick

[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:13.220]
Okay

[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.160]
Can you, I heard the other day

[00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:16.000]
You play it a rector

[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.660]
What do Christians do for fun?

[00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:19.160]
My husband didn't hear it

[00:58:19.160 --> 00:58:20.500]
Can you please play it again?

[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.320]
It's coming up in four or five minutes

[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.640]
Thank you so much

[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.600]
Just for you, thank you

[00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:25.160]
Have a great day

[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:25.840]
How do you like that?

[00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:26.880]
What are going to do for fun?

[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:27.560]
Now

[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.380]
Let's see if this thing will play

[00:58:29.380 --> 00:58:30.240]
Oh, jeez

[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.160]
I'm going to do the slide

[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.060]
and a tape

[00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.600]
I'd like my wife to do for fun, Bill

[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.080]
I'm going to do the slide

[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.460]
He could probably tell us

[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:37.460]
We will enjoy it

[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:37.900]
Slide right

[00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.720]
We can get him up

[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:39.620]
See?

[00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:40.060]

[00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:42.940]
He's just trying to do the overall objective

[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:44.320]
Okay, let me slide it in here

[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.740]
I'm kind of found out why I would have it

[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:46.620]
He's still going

[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.400]
Don't play to the end

[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:49.840]
One under and one under and six

[00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:50.680]
And three

[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.160]
This fight, what you may have heard

[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:52.960]
I'm going to do the same

[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.540]
Radio station, it is six

[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.640]
Only three

[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.060]
You may be able to

[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:58.840]
You may go up and hear the time is change

[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:00.220]
It has to change

[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.040]
Why, 100?

[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.980]
I'm just trying to pick up the pieces of our clock here

[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.600]
Which took one look at Jim really

[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.260]
And covered its face with its hands

[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.480]
This is an image

[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:12.240]
So this is the Calvin Company

[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:12.820]
Yes

[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.700]
Are you, what time do you have?

[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:15.700]
Well, what's up?

[00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.080]
You know what happened

[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:20.260]
I knew this man Jim really

[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:22.560]
Read the wrong thing in the newspaper

[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:26.060]
It's 10 minutes after six, right?

[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.240]
Right

[00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.160]
He can't have everybody in my anneals too

[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:29.600]
Oh, no

[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.060]
Yeah, for a few

[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:33.580]
You know, I'm under a

[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.600]
Tanner the money

[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.920]
He can't have the right home

[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:36.680]
The life is

[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:39.520]
Covered his face with his whole hands and change

[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:42.000]
And again, it's a life that we wanted to be six

[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:42.640]
Seven

[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:42.820]
Seven

[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.720]
What's it? That's enough

[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:46.220]
That's your thing

[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:46.820]
Oh yeah

[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:47.820]
He was good though

[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.660]
I don't care what you say

[00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.340]
He was good on ear

[00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:50.500]
Even if you think he's an asshole

[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.040]
Who Tanner?

[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:51.940]
Yeah

[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:53.180]
I never said he wasn't good on ear

[00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:54.700]
Oh okay, I'm just saying that

[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.920]
I'm just observing that he had a pretty damn good show

[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:58.140]
I just had a hated him

[00:59:58.140 --> 01:00:00.100]
So I came along and kicked his ass on Zeta

[01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:00.780]
Nice going Neil

[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.560]
Excellent

[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.100]
Ex-Napal's priest faces new sex abuse suit

[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:06.320]
I just can't believe all these stories

[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.660]
I think we're just making these up

[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:09.880]
This is quite a story too

[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.220]
Two more pages if you want them

[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:13.320]
Uh, are they juicy?

[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.060]
Err

[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.060]
No, juicy

[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:17.140]
I think all the good stuff is on here

[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:19.420]
Former St. Anne's alter boys

[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.020]
Latest accuser of William Romero

[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.280]
Who also faces a Miami criminal probe

[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:23.900]
Hey father

[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:25.220]
How's it going father?

[01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:27.360]
What's that thing in your neck there

[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:28.920]
That little white piece of cardboard there

[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.640]
Why?

[01:00:29.720 --> 01:00:30.580]
That's like a license

[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.240]
You know how you like to have your driver's license

[01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:33.740]
Right in your wallet

[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.820]
Will you put your license to molest children in your on your neck

[01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.160]
Father

[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.840]
Would you help a normal old boy

[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.000]
On a Catholic channel

[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.460]
No

[01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:44.160]
They tried to be good Catholics

[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.900]
When their son said he had been sexually abused by Father Willie

[01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:48.760]
Oh no I can't do that name

[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.120]
Oh no

[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:52.240]
Thank goodness his name wasn't Father Johnson

[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:57.820]
Abused by Father Willie in the rectory of Syrectumry of St. Anne Catholic Church

[01:00:57.820 --> 01:01:00.220]
The Naples floated a couple was dumbfounded

[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.220]
They turned to another priest for help

[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:02.680]
Uh oh

[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.300]
He told him to keep quiet for the good of the church

[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:06.480]
What a surprise

[01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:10.200]
In return they were promised the Reverend William Romero would leave St. Anne

[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.960]
And never again work as a parish priest

[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.020]
Or in an unsupervised setting with children

[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.740]
That was in 1976

[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:19.020]
Earlier this month the former alter boy in St. Anne's student

[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.440]
Now a 40-year-old married father living in Lee County

[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.360]
Filed suit against Romero on the archbishop of Miami

[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.120]
All right

[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:27.680]
Planning church leaders broke the secret pact

[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:30.720]
Like quietly transferring the wayward priest to other parishes

[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.240]
Where he debuts more children

[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.840]
What a surprise huh?

[01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:34.520]
How unusual

[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.720]
This is their church

[01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:39.420]
This is where they pray it's at Naples attorney Ted Zelman

[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:41.720]
Sounds like a real uh, Jew boy to me

[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.880]
Referring to the decision by the victim's parents in generation to go to trust their spiritual leaders

[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.960]
Rather than go to police or the court system

[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.040]
Southwest Florida was partly my my my art style season till 84

[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.600]
When Catholic churches in Codia leased their assault in seven other counties

[01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:56.680]
They came partly new diocese of Venice

[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:00.520]
Maybe they were on the gondola maybe they're in the gondola with foster hewitt

[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.800]
That's why the lawsuit was filed in dates county circled court in names archbishop John C. Faberola

[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.000]
Is a defendant along with the Romero to which we say

[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:08.460]
All right

[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.780]
The victim who threw some into climate interview request is identified in court papers only as AB

[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:14.760]
AB

[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.860]
That sounds like another Jewish boy AB

[01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.740]
AB ischcapable

[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:24.960]
According to a legal complaint Romero gradually initiated inappropriate conduct with the victim when the boy was 12 or 13

[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:32.820]
First it's a child's home through a game of leapfrog and later on an overnight stay at the St. Anne rectumry a game of leapfrog

[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:37.980]
And the all their boy arrived at St. Anne for what he thought was a group sailing trip with his youth pastor and

[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.240]
Catechism teacher he realized no other students were present

[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:46.640]
Later that night after returning from a movie with another priest Romero persuaded the boy to shower with them

[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.300]
lawsuit states Romero proceeded to touch the boy's sexual organs while masturbating himself

[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:57.460]
Sounds reasonable the 66 year old former priest who resigned from the clergy earlier this year

[01:02:57.460 --> 01:03:02.440]
Made an internal diocese probe of sex abuse complaints couldn't be reached for comment despite thought coastal as home in

[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:07.480]
Love Bell how do you like that? I don't how about Patti love Bell, huh

[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.200]
She's another fact that says

[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:20.180]
Please tell uncle Neil that a well voters users can vote in polls and get results just use internet explorer to access neo-rangers.com and vote your asses off

[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:21.920]
It says no chance this way either

[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.400]
So I guess if you go direct to a well your screw is what they're trying to say that what that what it is

[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:34.560]
I guess so use internet explorer man because a well blows the oh and it stands for obnoxious outrageous

[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.440]
unfrikan acceptable

[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:37.960]
a well

[01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:41.040]
Would we hit more a well or bell saw answer?

[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.280]
12 minutes after 11 at 560. How's Gary started doing haven't seen him lately?

[01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:49.460]
He's busy with his new months. I wonder if I'm gonna be able to see his

[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:55.800]
Close personal friend is twin in Europe next time I go. I wonder if I'm gonna be seeing him hanging around

[01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.620]
What up? Oh man if you I got a you're right. I got to start taking a camera

Start taking the pictures you would you would pee in your pants the audience is hungry for images

He's in a pod two peas in a pod. It's Gary sarner junior and I'm stood on baby. I've been a pod

[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.060]
Yes, as a matter of fact, it's fun

[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.620]
In fact it worked for what's his name it worked for uh on what was that galactica?

[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.020]
What?

[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.120]
In galactica didn't he pee in a pod? Oh in galactica

[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.860]
I call it galactica galactica

[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:25.900]
galactica

[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:29.600]
Well, I don't want to say that because it sounds like he's in a pod now that he did

[01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:33.080]
It's that time of the year against speaking of a ping on your mattress

[01:05:19.140 --> 01:05:25.000]
When you called out a mattress at 1 800 mattress you still get to pick the day and time for delivery and they show up

[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.960]
It's like a freaking miracle any to our windows seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m

[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:33.340]
Believe you me you'll be sleeping like me like a baby on your dial amatris like I've been doing three years

[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:37.660]
Low prices same data delivery free stuff and removal what's not to like it's easy to see

[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:40.400]
Why dial amatris is the best in the world and customer satisfaction

[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:45.640]
So don't get sucked in by those mattress rooms or furniture stir ads. They're not in the same league with dial amatris

[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:32.200]

[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:36.640]

I love to know, I love to know, I love to know

[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:09.340]
Do the garris hole in touch while meaning out their gun

[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:14.020]
I love to know, I love to know what Christians super fun

[01:07:14.020 --> 01:07:18.280]
Do the garris of the fish, from the tailgate of their truck

[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:23.060]
Whoa, I love to know, I love to know what Christians super fun

[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:27.720]
Sid and stand and eat and sit back down again and chew

[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:32.020]
And watch it all bound with a twelve pack of fruit

[01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:36.720]
Live a life of boredom up to heaven you go

[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.840]
Got always find the fun for in that hole

[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:47.940]
Whoa, I love to know, I love to know, I love to know

[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.640]
I love to know, I love to know, I love to know

[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:01.120]
What a glam doofre fun, it's love at 18 at 560 WQM

[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.240]
Here's one that says, please help me with this comedian's name

[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.520]
I know it's lame to say, I hate him, can't remember his name

[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.880]
He has divorced a little kid named Bobby on a cartoon show, he's Canadian A

[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.800]
And says, God damn it, I hate these and my memory can sell us take a hike

[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.620]
Take pity, his name is Bob's name, God Bob can't go off weight

[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.740]
Is that everything it is? I wrote that with a question mark

[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:22.260]
Because I don't know who he means but that's my guess

[01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.260]
Oh, his Bob

[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.960]
Bob? Spongebob? Spongebob? Spongebob?

[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.860]
Here's two, Sid, that and Kira top

[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.180]
Kira top

[01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:35.560]
Are we gonna pick on Kira top again?

[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:36.500]
Please

[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.560]
Good, let's do it

[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.020]
Oh no, Cystis, we count abuse by priest

[01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:44.400]
Are you making these up? I think you just have a place where we just crank and easing

[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.860]
You know it, cranking up these bubble my shoes that they say in Siberia

[01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:48.660]
I belong to a group

[01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:52.080]
Oh, do you know those letters that we were talking about this before?

[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:55.880]
The letters home from the soldiers that turn out to be really bogus

[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:56.480]
The form letters?

[01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.340]
The letters appeared in roughly 12 newspapers across the country

[01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:02.120]
From Massachusetts to California and from many places in between

[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:06.320]
Family members and local newspapers received letters from soldiers from the second battalion

[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.300]
The 530 infantry regiment detailing their successes at Northern Iraq

[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.240]
Um, and a guy, why can't we get to the right part of it?

[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:20.440]
Amy Connell of Sharon Masch knew as soon as she received the letter from her son Adam that he didn't write it

[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:23.000]
He's 20 years old, I saw her in the news last night, you see her?

[01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:23.520]
No

[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.480]
He's 20 years old, I don't think this is his language or his writing ability would have entailed that kind of description

[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:32.620]
She was right, her son didn't write the letter and emailed the ABC News today

[01:09:32.620 --> 01:09:38.460]
The commander of the battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Dominic Caracelo, said the letter writing initiative was all his idea

[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.220]
propaganda baby

[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:44.480]
Caracelo said he circulated the form letter to his soldiers to give them an opportunity

[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.000]
To let their respective hometowns know what they are accomplishing here and cure cook

[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.600]
As you might expect they're working extremely fast, past getting the good news back home is always easy

[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.600]
The good news sounds like more Christian fun

[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:03.260]
We thought it would be a good idea to encapsulate what we as a battalion of accomplice in surviving in Iraq and share that pride with the people back home

[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:08.180]
He wrote that his staff drafted the letter, he edited it and reviewed it and then offered it to soldiers

[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.820]
Every soldier who signed that letter did so after a careful read he said

[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:17.380]
Some of could find a time decided to send their own versions while others chose not to take part in the initiative

[01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:25.520]
Caracelo was on apologetic saying the letter perfectly reflects what each of these brave soldiers has and continues to accomplish on the ground is what he said

[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:27.380]
And he said you believe me?

[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.380]
Sure said that, you believe me?

[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.300]
About cat cold weight, that's what we think but I really don't know it

[01:10:33.300 --> 01:10:34.240]
I hope he's not Canadian

[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.200]
I have a public service announcement

[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.840]
Yes, it's how he mandel

[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:38.660]
That does it

[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:43.300]
Oh, I'm so glad we got how he mandel on there

[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:46.160]
He makes my inner just twitch

[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.640]
He makes my kiss use ache

[01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:54.460]
I don't understand how he mandel at all, at all

[01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:59.740]
I've never been able to understand why anybody would think he's funny, he's annoying, he's irritating

[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.300]
I'm so glad we got that, thank you

[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:02.740]
You don't understand how he's up there?

[01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:04.020]
No

[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:07.840]
How he got to where he is today

[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.600]
Oh, not another one, is this the pre-sting? What is this?

[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.760]
Oh, you've got so much stuff coming in here now

[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:16.100]
What about the pink killer edition? Is there more to that?

[01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:18.000]
There better be two more pages if you want them

[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.100]
Well, please, I...

[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.900]
Oh yeah, because it's about our good friend Rush

[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.420]
That's what the whole thing is about, all Rush, all time, you can't hear Rush himself

[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:32.740]
So what we'll do is we'll just rip him an ass for four hours every day while he's in rehab

[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.420]
And we'll probably get Will not on here, how's Will not do it?

[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.160]
Won't see her normal

[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:43.980]
Anyway, let's see, should we do that one first? Let's get some more names for this poll, we've only got 100 of them

[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:47.360]
Which so-called comedian you think is the least funny?

[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:52.940]
See, and then of course when I like that the Randy, which is a factist, still rolled an amount on the floor moving

[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.260]
When I sent a list of eight, I mean, what does that mean?

[01:11:56.420 --> 01:12:00.960]
I guess he's just trying to put names that he thinks belong on list, but that doesn't, it's not really responsive to the question

[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:04.440]
So, Monashhtar and Halalah Azazah, why shouldn't they be any different from any other day?

[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:08.940]
Because they just don't respawn, they have like their own agenda, they have their own homosexual agenda

[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.320]
201 votes, not too bad

[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.300]
Tom Arnold 49, Dennis Miller 44, I hope Dennis Miller wins

[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:21.820]
I don't want to, I don't want to influence this, but I hope Dennis Miller wins because he's a freaking asshole man

[01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:23.700]
So I voted for, he's a moron

[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.980]
I'm so glad that ABC took a deep inside the old bottom, right Tom?

[01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:33.100]
Twice, put in him on a Monday night football, which was an absolute abortion

[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:38.280]
And the fact that we had people on this radio station where they said, oh well he's not so bad, he's a piece of crap

[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:38.840]
Yeah

[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:44.400]
When he added to those broadcasts, you can put in a teacup and have room for the guy that Chinese army left over

[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.920]
Maybe they could try someone who ain't a Nazi next time

[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:54.600]
There you go, or maybe somebody who actually has something to do with sports or sports broadcasting as opposed to trying to bring some curmudgeon in there who thinks he's a comedian

[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.060]
Sports!

[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:59.200]
Some Nazi, although they said Heinrich Himmler was a lot of fun today at Cocktail Party

[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:04.680]
Tom Arnold 49, and then of course the rushed thing on ESPN, they jammed that right up the right dome

[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:11.700]
Yeah, Donald and McNabb took his foot and shoved it right up, rushes ass, said, hey rush it hurts but the top of couple, the panel stopped real quick

[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.120]
You'll be golfing at no time at all

[01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:20.140]
And then amazing how some of these banschers, they're always playing golf, OJ with his bad knees, he's playing golf

[01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:25.140]
He got rushes like an tremendous neck and back pain, he's out there whacking it around, whacking it around

[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.120]
Man, Tom Arnold 49, Dennis Miller 44, Martin Lawrence 21, it just changed again

[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:34.220]
I'm hoping maybe Dennis Miller moves up a little, oh look at that

[01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:37.800]
Like I said, Dennis Miller, see the power of Neil, you see that?

[01:13:37.860 --> 01:13:39.120]
Yeah, look good

[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.580]
I'm just tied, and Tom Arnold 49 and Dennis Miller 49, he's got a past, I'm Arnold like he's standing still

[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:50.940]
Whoopi Goldberg 22, Martin Lawrence 22, I'll tell you another guy who I think is not funny at all

[01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:56.000]
And everybody who's going to be pissed off when I say this, John Litter

[01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:00.200]
No, don't be picking on poor John Litter, oh he wasn't funny

[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:06.620]
John, he was a nightcourt, big guy, goofy looking guy

[01:14:06.620 --> 01:14:08.320]
You mean John Lerichette?

[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.220]
John Lerichette, and do you think he's funny?

[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:14.400]
He's funny in shows, but as far as John Lerichette

[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.000]
He's not funny, he's an asshole man, John Lerichette, get him on there

[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.420]
I'd rather see Cliff Arquette, at least he was funny

[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:22.080]
Right?

[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:24.460]
Sure, I'm going to butcher this name

[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:30.940]
Cliff Arquette was great, John Lerichette, LARIQU as in queer, Queen, QUETTE

[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.760]
You got your two TTs there?

[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.680]
Yes, E, John Lerichette, good

[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:39.460]
Let's see, Martin Lawrence 22, Rosio Donald, that fat, that bitch has got 15

[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:43.500]
We hate you Rosy, there's a lot of hate pent up in this, and that's why we like to show so much

[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.800]
As we get a chance to like, win and doubt, we let it out

[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.920]
Top another one, Rush, Ben Stein 10, so I guess he is supposed to be

[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:56.380]
Although I don't know, I thought he was just a philanthropist who gives his money away when he wants a lot of publicity for it

[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.880]
And a right-wing asshole

[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:01.220]
How come most of the assholes seem to be right-wingers, you know?

[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:01.980]
Hmm

[01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:12.920]
Wanda Sightseine, Robin William VI, Yuri Seinfeld VI, Caratop V, Chris Tucker and his mother, five, Tim Allen, five, Ray Romano, four, Jacky Mason's got four

[01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:18.020]
So you think, who is he who was he who was he named into long enough, or Chris Rock? Well, he probably, he's got one

[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:20.220]
That's probably the guy who sent an A-man

[01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:22.280]
Yeah

[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.180]
L-indee generates got two, nothing funny about that bitch, I'll tell you that right now, she makes my skin crawl

[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.000]
Why? Why does anybody like her because she's a dike?

[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.720]
See, if you're gonna like dikes, at least like what, attractive ones, you know, hot dikes

[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:39.860]
There's nothing worse than a cold, flabby dike like her

[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:45.620]
She's a flabby, cold, nasty dike who's not attractive, she's not funny, she just won't go away

[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:47.580]
That's the thing that bugs me about her, she won't go away

[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.840]
She just keeps coming back over and over and over

[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:50.660]
They keep sticking her on there

[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.040]
That's what I'm saying

[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.840]
She keeps making a comeback that bitch

[01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:00.320]
And the public says, ah, nah, she's like a little uh, little too dikey for us

[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.840]
And then of course, and hate, what the hate she's going on with her

[01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:04.960]
She's great

[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.080]
Like this week she's straight, she's with a guy and then next week she's like, uh, over the place

[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.040]
1127 and 560 WDQM, hey if your hair's all over the place, mostly off your head

[01:16:15.420 --> 01:16:18.700]
Here's the answer for it, Charles Hoppery and his natural hair line system

[01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:22.380]
You can monkey around with all these other people, you can listen to all these other peddlers out there

[01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:27.740]
Everybody in the world now is peddling hair pieces and holes in the head and magic pills that make your hair grow back

[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.060]
Not

[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:32.940]
The natural hair line system is the best in the world which is for a while for over 25 years now

[01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:37.640]
People with the big bucks and even shleppers go to Charlie and everybody in between to matter how much you spend

[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.540]
You can't get a better looking head of hair than the natural hair line system

[01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:43.360]
And that's why they call it natural hair line because that's what it looks like

[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:45.640]
Life hair is really growing out of your scalp like it's your real hair

[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.020]
As opposed to a dead farm enemy along your head

[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:52.980]
So you have nothing to lose but the bald spot because when you get it everybody gets Charlie's 38-day guarantee

[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:58.320]
If you don't love the way your hair looks and feels and smells, if you're not getting a head at least 15, 20, 30 times today

[01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.660]
Return it Charlie, give your money back no problem at all

[01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.280]
And be sure to mention my name when you call because Charlie give you 200 bucks off the regular price

[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.380]
Just for having the cajon's to mention the arroggers when you make that phone call

[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.800]
The number to call toll free to get your hair back and look better and younger than you ever dreamed you could again

[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.680]
It's 1-800-321-2413

[01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:44.660]
That's 1-800-321-2413 or log onto it, Charles Alphairi.com

[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:50.180]
Hey lady, the heart of rock and roll, heart of rock and roll is still beating

[01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:58.280]
With the ventricles and the arden, Cleveland's already with shipwagon and the flagol and all those places

[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.420]
The King of Comedy is about to become the prince of pop, it's Jerry Lewis and the news

[01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:07.980]
Hey lady, oh please I'd like a new drug, no need those ways

[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:14.560]
It's a nice man, the pharmacist type person, and the white dog lady's eyes, I need that new

[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:21.740]
Hey, it's hip to be square and it's even hipper to buy something round like the new CD from Jerry Lewis and the news

[01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:29.940]
Available, you can find it wherever find record is sold with a nice man behind the cow that they have you find it with a nice lady

[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:32.560]
Person, okay, why? You don't know

[01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.560]
So book of offices, Jerry Lewis is the least funny and I don't think you're going to get too many arguments, right?

[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:41.340]
Okay, I mean once upon a time he was funny, I can't be sure to waste her

[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:45.760]
Anyway, put his ass on there, now if you could have just seen her, you watching CNN by any chance?

[01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:47.340]
No, I've been flipping around though

[01:18:47.340 --> 01:18:55.380]
Too bad, the naked protest? No, they just showed Wesley Clark at the Rascal House talking to private-year-old Jews

[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:59.800]
Oh my goodness, they had one woman sitting there, she looked like death on wheels, man, it's unbelievable

[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:07.340]
Did she have a walker with wheels? No, she didn't have no walker, she was squatting down, she was busy pushing her pickles and her coleslaw into her sack

[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:12.000]
And we're bagged with a couple of dingled berries

[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.360]
Man, Wesley Clark, I guess this, I don't know what that's all about, do you?

[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.620]
No, I really don't, but he ought to go to Vick and Herbs

[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.900]
Yeah, if you want to go see some living and breathing people out of the age of 100, go to Vick and Herbs is right, that's a good idea

[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.720]
Yeah, they're white-hots, get a good meal

[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:33.800]
Anyway, here's a whole list again, the official unfunny list, they won't play by the game, they just refused to do it

[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:37.020]
Bill Mar is on here, but he's not supposed to be a comedian, he's just an asshole

[01:19:37.020 --> 01:19:38.720]
Oh, he's done stand-up, that's so...

[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.260]
Oh, get him on there then, I want to change my vote

[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:46.040]
I want to change my vote, I dislike him even more than I dislike Dennis Miller

[01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:46.900]
I want to change my vote

[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:50.240]
Dennis Miller, at least just, you know, he's just a good goose-stepping right-wing asshole

[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:56.680]
But Bill Mar is this, like, I've always told you, he's like a poor man's dick-cavid, which is really saying a lot

[01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.440]
Yeah, that's a shri-

[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:03.700]
And I know we're not going to do the little twerp thing, because I thought about that, we've already done that poll, who's the wimpiest and little twerpiest, we've done that

[01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.220]
Bill Gates, that crowd can

[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.720]
And Bill Mar was on there, and he deserves to be on this one too

[01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.080]
And I know there are a lot of people out there, but Bill Mar is such a great political man, he's an asshole, man

[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:21.880]
This is the same guy, he wrote the book when you're driving your SUV, you ride with the Osama, remember that?

[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.720]
Yeah, remember that stupid book is?

[01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:31.320]
Of course, if you're driving my Corvette, I guess, I'm riding with Osama, because it still takes gas to run you more on you idiot

[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:37.560]
If you're driving a car that gives you like 50 miles a gallon, you're still riding with Osama, because you're still putting gas in it

[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:40.720]
And you got it, Bill, you idiot, you're simple than you, man

[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:47.540]
Talk about another state of mind, Bill Mar, he's a no wonder he got fired everywhere he's ever been, he's even worse than Mo

[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:48.180]
Absolutely

[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.700]
Well, I'm sorry, that's getting carried away

[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:52.340]
Johnny Carson, somebody says, I would agree with that

[01:20:52.340 --> 01:21:00.100]
I mean, I'm not saying that he never, some of his car-mac routines or whatever, yeah, some of the stuff was mildly amusing once in a great while

[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:05.360]
But for all those years, what was funny about him, and Jay Leno, was he's already on there, right?

[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:16.660]
Toady Fields, I don't be picking on dead people now, he was a panic, a senior wences, now that's not right, senior wences, what's he at that point I brought a line, you stuck with the rock on there

[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:23.800]
Well, no, I'm sorry, senior wences number one, he's dead and number two, most of these people don't know who it is, number three was very, very funny

[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:25.360]
So, got it, so got it

[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:26.880]
Got it, and he painted it

[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:28.260]
Jackie the joke man, Martling

[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:29.640]
I want to change my vote to him

[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:35.520]
We're trying to even know Jackie the joke man had a last name, but obviously he does, now what is he doing now that he and I'm a stern show anymore?

[01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:37.400]
I don't know, nothing to help

[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:39.420]
No, I'm sure somebody will start something to help

[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:43.200]
Some New Yorker type, I'm surprised Scott hasn't jumped right in there to tell us

[01:21:44.420 --> 01:21:48.020]
Jackie the joke man, is he on there with Opium and the Anthium?

[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:51.320]
Who cares?

[01:21:51.700 --> 01:21:57.820]
And it says, any asshole at an open mic night at a local comedy club, you're right, oh I know who could be on air, he won't cause nobody knows who it is

[01:21:57.820 --> 01:21:59.080]
What's a focus friend there?

[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:01.220]
Jackie Patterson

[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:07.000]
Steve Patterson? Steve Patterson, he's about as funny as terminal hemorrhoidosis man

[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.380]
Should we put people on here that somebody might have heard of though?

[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:12.800]
No, I'm not putting them on, I just just said, I just mentioned that in passing

[01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:18.260]
This is a little stoch the book of Brian, or your buddy is about as funny like I said as an aneurysm

[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.740]
Hey, did that schoo-gans bit? Like I said, awful

[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:26.080]
Now do I want to do the system? I better take some calls, we got a lot more names to put on there

[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:29.820]
We got some very important stories including the drug habit, hard to kick thing

[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:31.240]
I'll be damned

[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:36.300]
Here's a call from some beach, you don't say what beach but some beach, hello

[01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.820]
I'm a Miami Beach Neil, thanks son

[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.700]
I would like to recommend for the list, Dudley Moore

[01:22:41.700 --> 01:22:44.080]
Oh poor Dudley Moore who's dead but a lot of people

[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.400]
You're right, I agree with you

[01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.400]
And let me add one more thing about Rush if I might, you know what I mean?

[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.960]
Please, we nude his contract and was going deaf at the time

[01:22:54.820 --> 01:23:01.420]
I would imagine he did not tell the people he was negotiating with that he was going deaf at the time

[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.560]
Absolutely correct

[01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:08.320]
Didn't tell him at all, of course you didn't tell about the pills but I'm sure he's not telling the guys I'm going deaf

[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.280]
Still give me 33 million a year

[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.380]
Yep, well said, thanks a lot, Pell

[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.220]
Bye, bye, bye

[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:20.420]
Dudley Moore, another guy, he's dead but I mean there's a dead guy we can pick on because I thought he was just, I think his name said it all the first part, Dud

[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:22.920]
Right? Sure, he did

[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.820]
Just another little kind of like a munchkin guy that, you know, club club

[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:34.440]
At least, at least what's his name Mr. Martini Danny DeVito, at least he's funny

[01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:41.420]
Yeah, I'm not fall down on a floor funny but he's funny, he's that he amuses us every now and then

[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:42.920]
Did he amuse us?

[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:47.960]
I like Danny DeVito, especially in the kuhuznest Mr. Martini

[01:23:48.540 --> 01:23:53.960]
I have a martini, Mr. Martini, although I did love it wasn't it was it not Ellen Burston? Who was it?

[01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:55.920]
Nurse Ratchet?

[01:23:56.420 --> 01:23:59.360]
Don't tell me, don't tell me, I always confuse her, don't tell me

[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:03.760]
I always confuse her with Ellen Burston, Ellen Burston of course was Sarah

[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.020]
Right, she also was an exorcist, right?

[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.920]
She played Reagan's mother

[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:11.020]
Of course, Ronnie forgot about it

[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.620]
Louise Fletcher, yes

[01:24:13.980 --> 01:24:18.120]
Oh, very good, thank goodness, see I have now I have a little confidence I can live another week or two

[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:22.480]
Louise Fletcher, no, lower Fletcher, Louise, Louise, geez Louise

[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:26.980]
So who else did we just put on there that sucks and blows big the chunks?

[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:28.940]
Dudley Moore, very good

[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:31.640]
Hey Rush, can you hear us?

[01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.000]
No, here's Deerfield, hello

[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:41.140]
Hey, yeah, I don't like to say, well, Carrot Top was my top on my pole anyway

[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:49.340]
But Norm McDonnell and Colin Quinn, both of those guys, they're terrible

[01:24:49.340 --> 01:24:54.440]
Norm McDonnell is a dud, yeah, okay, thank you, good choices, Norm McDonnell, who was the other one he said?

[01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:55.920]
Colin Quinn

[01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.940]
Colin Quinn, who the hell is that?

[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:02.420]
He replaced Norm McDonnell when he got fired because he wouldn't shut up about OJ

[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:05.620]
Oh, he wouldn't shut up about OJ

[01:25:05.620 --> 01:25:08.580]
So Saturday nightly, he used to do the news on Saturday nightly

[01:25:08.580 --> 01:25:10.540]
Yeah, I haven't watched that since it used to be good

[01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.740]
Norm was very funny, I used to watch that show all the time when it was good

[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.740]
Took a shot at OJ during every newscast

[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:18.820]
And they told him why don't we like him then?

[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.460]
I like him a lot, his stand up routine was hysterical, he did the news

[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.480]
Well, this guy don't like him, put him on the right hand

[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.580]
I thought I hated Norm McDonnell, was that all McDonnell?

[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.360]
Hey, OJ, they still hate you

[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.140]
OJ, they hate you like poison

[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.240]
What just happened to that thing?

[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:36.340]
Look at that

[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:39.960]
Oh, look at what I got, see he's messing up my whole again

[01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.580]
Second day in a row, I can't get rid of Rush

[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:52.600]
If I was having another time, I'll bring him to the point

[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:55.400]
Oh man, he's finally stuck his nose in there

[01:25:56.340 --> 01:25:58.580]
64 for Dennis Miller, what did I tell you?

[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:02.720]
Which so-called comedian you think is the least funny

[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:06.720]
Tom Arnold 56, Wurpy Goldberg 25

[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:11.300]
Just the hair is enough to just send me into orbit man, I can't handle it

[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:16.360]
Martin Lawrence 24, Rosio Domel 18, Carrotop 14

[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:18.720]
London Sacks 11, even with that fresh turd

[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:23.300]
Vince Stein and Bob Sagitt rhymes with Faggot and Maggot

[01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:26.820]
Tenepiece and Dragott right across the room

[01:26:26.820 --> 01:26:29.840]
Right through the soup, Jerry Seinfeld's got seven

[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:33.580]
A Ray Romano's got seven Robin Williams six

[01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:37.000]
Tim Allen five, Chris Tucker five, Jackie Mason's got four

[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.940]
LND Jermits got four that night, Chris Rock's got four George, four votes for Chris Rock

[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.060]
What do they know? I'm not agreeing with him, who now is this guy?

[01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.700]
My family and friends pretty much make fun of me constantly

[01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:51.480]
I don't think I could ever let it go to my head so much

[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:53.500]
It's been a lot of fun, it's been very flattering

[01:26:55.900 --> 01:26:56.700]
Bob Faggot?

[01:26:57.320 --> 01:27:00.020]
What's he doing with his chick on there? Well, of course he's kind of going to be too

[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:02.600]
What's he not going to do her? He's a Faggot

[01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.520]
Who is that? What is that? What show is that?

[01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.940]
It's some new dating show, something like that

[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:10.440]
Another realy romance and realy

[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:13.140]
That's a screamer man, up there, he's floating

[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:15.100]
I don't even have gate already studying it all

[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:18.820]
Just like that, on the awful, what was that? What the hell is it?

[01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.100]
Just in Guarini, man

[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.800]
Yeah, the wini part, he liked, look at that

[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.260]
I mean, he's actually not that bad

[01:27:24.260 --> 01:27:27.260]
If he just shut up, he's one of those guys, look at right there, he looks pretty good

[01:27:27.660 --> 01:27:28.400]
He can't stop

[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:30.120]
Bob Gwyny, he's still speaking

[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:34.560]
Oh, don't say those S's, don't say the S words, man

[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:37.860]
The S's are flying right through my TV all the way up here, I can't deal with it

[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:39.820]
Maybe not, maybe we're wrong about that

[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.580]
Let's cut him some slack

[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.420]
1141 at 560 W2QM when your carpets need like a serious help

[01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:50.020]
When they look really schmootsy and they may even smell bad

[01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:52.040]
When you're embarrassed by how filthy your carpets are

[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:55.200]
Don't go throw in a mountain, spend a ton of money for expensive new carpeting

[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:59.620]
Do the smart thing like I always do for over 20 years I've been doing it, call our friends to drive concepts

I'll bet Scott Jr's life on it, and George too, I'll throw him in there too

[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:11.020]
Because they always do an unbeatable spectacular job, they're the number one carpark cleaning and company in the world

[01:28:11.020 --> 01:28:15.140]
The only people who actually dry clean your carpets, an exclusive patented method

[01:28:15.140 --> 01:28:19.220]
that allows them to suck out the dirt that's way down in there, and if I'm as your carpet

[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:22.760]
Which makes them look brand new, stay law cleaner longer and last longer too

[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.880]
And smell them any fresh in a couple of hours, they're dry ready to rock and roll again

[01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:30.460]

[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.300]
And then dry concepts will come out the next time they have an opening in that schedule

[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:48.100]

My life and locals, this is Fort Real 5 City, UAV-2AM

[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:29.000]
I urge everyone to complain to this station

[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:33.080]
First there was the club, the anti-fab device that locks to the steering wheel of your car

[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.260]
Then there was the cap, the anti-fab device that prevents these from picking your airbags

[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:41.400]
Now there's the ultimate in state of the art that's protection, introducing the crap

[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.820]
Two and a half pounds of steaming human excrement that locks neatly to the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles

[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:50.460]
Properly installed the crap that turns even the most of the permanency

[01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:55.260]
Hey nice car, they let the door unlock, let's take this for a little spin

[01:29:56.040 --> 01:30:00.300]
Oh my god someone took a dump on the front seat, that is disgusting

[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:02.340]
I'm moving on to the next car

[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:08.080]
One wave of the crap and thief will move on to one other car that doesn't have a steaming pile of human excrement on the front seat

[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:13.320]
We guarantee it, order the crap for your car today and anyone who tries to steal your car will be in teeth

[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:21.220]
Well, you know, here we should do 1147-13 to know we got the mad dog at 2, the Humprad 4, 7 o'clock you got your playoff edition of Marlon's on deck

[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.540]
And it came follows the baseball game and Joe and Mark and they're lowly rated Joe overnight 2-5

[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:33.740]
Now maybe they'll have a good this summer book do you think?

[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:35.580]
We don't know

[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:42.400]
Well, maybe so do you have a good summer book because Thursday at 1 p.m. Look out now comes the big summer book coming up

[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.280]
Enormous tremendous pressure, wait till you're who's coming up on this thing

[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.440]
If it ever decides to play, Joey

[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:49.360]
No

[01:30:57.400 --> 01:30:59.000]
Talk about great audio on

[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:02.920]

[01:31:10.020 --> 01:31:11.000]

[01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:28.680]
It's Diamond Head rec center with the middle of my number one on US 1

All the other air division time with Dr. C plus a little bit of soul

At the game room open 7 days a week in 301

[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:42.800]
Diamond has the only dance in the Keys and I've got a lot of smack dab on US 1

[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.660]

You have a little candy and sure you want to go along?

[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:49.020]
No

[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:50.260]
You ever been to Adam or Rada?

[01:31:50.540 --> 01:31:51.280]
You don't keep us off you

[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:51.920]
You don't wanna go

[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:53.680]
I don't know we're gonna go down there anyway

[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:55.840]
We'll be looking for you at the Diamond Head tomorrow

[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:57.240]
I want you to pay me

[01:31:57.240 --> 01:31:59.140]
I think he has his four fingers

[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.320]
I've got a certain mic on it

[01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.040]
Yeah you've got it

[01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.640]
First rules you learn it very well

[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:05.200]
It's always certain mic on before you solve

[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.680]
Right, okay, halftime score

[01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:07.700]

[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:12.380]
Let me check that out here Jackson how much?

[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:14.400]
21, Edison 7

[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.280]
Oh, I thought they were playing ball meta

[01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:17.280]
Tiger radio

[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.340]
What the hell is this show? How good a score keeper I am right now

[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:21.300]
That's all mine

[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:24.960]
That's enough

[01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:28.320]
I got set Rick that's enough you can't shut him up

[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.000]
I got 36

[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.380]
1966, Ricky Tickie Shaw

[01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:33.780]
And he's still going strong

[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:35.760]
I hold the head and fret

[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:36.600]
You go boy

[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.220]
Yeah you go boy

[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.920]
Rick Shaw he's okay

[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.420]
He calls us every once in a while just to make sure we know he's still alive

[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:44.960]
What do you say that one day?

[01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:45.820]
It was a weepy

[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:47.900]
Remember that day when he caused that I do great radio

[01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:51.920]
I didn't know whether to just scream or lick a banana

[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:53.200]
He don't want to laugh to you

[01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.240]
He doct is filthy kept me

[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:58.020]
By the way get that thing dry clean maybe dry concepts can help you out, Ricky

[01:32:58.580 --> 01:33:00.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60

[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.560]
Pound 5, 60 on a AT&T line

[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:03.980]
Here's plantation hello

[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.460]
Hi Neil

[01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:06.600]
Yes sir

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.880]
I would just say Jimmy Kimball or P.V. Herman

[01:33:10.740 --> 01:33:11.440]
Jimmy what?

[01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:12.360]
Kimball

[01:33:12.360 --> 01:33:13.400]
Jimmy Kimball

[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.600]
And P.V. Herman

[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:16.160]
Okay thanks

[01:33:17.740 --> 01:33:18.600]
Jimmy Kimball

[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:20.160]
Who else do me Kimball?

[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.420]
I've heard of him, but

[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:22.360]
Okay

[01:33:22.360 --> 01:33:23.900]
I think what about P.V. Kimball

[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:25.140]
Oh Jimmy Kimball?

[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:25.560]
Yeah

[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.640]
That one funny guy

[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.420]
Okay and what about P.V.

[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.220]
I'll put him under

[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:33.020]
Yeah

[01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:36.180]
Put P.V. on there okay

[01:33:36.180 --> 01:33:38.480]
P.V. is a character that we want to put Paul Rubens on there

[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:42.260]
Oh Paul Rubens is a pervert

[01:33:42.260 --> 01:33:43.820]
The P.V. Herman is a character

[01:33:44.420 --> 01:33:44.960]
He's the comedian

[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:47.920]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pound 5, 60

[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.140]
You don't think of Paul Rubens's gay dude

[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:50.860]
No

[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:52.880]
You think so?

[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.440]
I don't know

[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:58.680]
You can't be gay and do stuff with little kids unless you're a priest

[01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:00.360]
Do you know that?

[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.060]
I got the memo

[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.000]
Which is a good segue into this story

[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.660]
Sisters' recount abuse by a priest

[01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:09.540]
The two sisters hadn't spoken about the incidents for more than 30 years

[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.460]
About 30 men

[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:13.300]
Even now it's difficult for the women both in their late 40s

[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.100]
to talk about the times they were molested by a priest in the rectum re

[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:18.520]
of St. Patrick's Church in Mazeville

[01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:20.780]
Now where the hell is Mazeville? Do we know what paper is this?

[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:21.820]
Since an attic

[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:22.640]
It's in Ohio

[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:28.120]
It was always there, said the older of the two, who was 14 when she was sexually assaulted

[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:31.260]
I wanted to be a nun, but I thought I was an evil person

[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:33.680]
An evil doer

[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.520]
The woman and her sister, both of whom, is still living in the area and asked not to be identified

[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.580]
Settled her claim this past weekend against the Catholic diocese of Covington

[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.920]
The diocese paid 750 grand of them and a third person, a man who was molested as young teen

[01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.620]
In the late 60s, St. Patrick's, said the attorney Barbara Boner of Covington

[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:55.300]
B-O-N-A-R, Barbara Boner

[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:56.900]
Boner

[01:34:56.900 --> 01:35:00.960]
The man said he was molested by Earl Beermin, who was serving a 20-year prison sentence

[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.920]
I think Kentucky State Reformatory after pleading guilty in 1993

[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.960]
to molesting boys in Mazeville, Newport and Covington in the 60s and 70s

[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.040]
Beermin is still a priest but he's been prohibited by the Church

[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.740]
from carrying out any priestly duties using the term father with his name

[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:15.760]
Oh God!

[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:23.120]
He can't carry out any priestly duties or use the name father but he's still a priest

[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:26.140]
I think I've got this shortage going on

[01:35:26.140 --> 01:35:26.760]
I told a monkle

[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.860]
Is that what it is?

[01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:32.240]
The two women identified their molester as former priest David McPherson

[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.860]
who was assigned to St. Patrick's parish, Newton at the parish school in the 60s

[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.460]
And it goes on

[01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:41.160]
Now comes the good story

[01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:44.340]
The stuff that we're really sinking our teeth into these days

[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:47.780]
Hippocrits is us, that's Russia's new deal

[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:51.420]
Instead of the O-I-B and the E-I-B and all that bull crap

[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:53.360]
Hippocrits is us, H-I-U

[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.220]
Pain-Killer Rediction Difficult to Beat

[01:35:58.900 --> 01:36:03.580]
Conservative Radio Talk Show is Russia Limbo who last week checked into a 30-day treatment program

[01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:03.940]
Howling

[01:36:03.940 --> 01:36:04.960]
About 30 men

[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:09.280]
To break his addiction to painkillers faces a challenge greater than trying to silence throngs of liberals

[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.560]
Ready for that?

[01:36:10.940 --> 01:36:11.280]
I'm ready

[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:14.620]
A challenge greater than trying to silence throngs of liberals

[01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:23.160]
More than four million Americans are addicted to painkillers among those who seek treatment

[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.960]
Only about half are successful

[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.280]
Dr. Karin Drender

[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.860]
Assistant Professor of Psychology at Emery University and directed the Substance Abuse

[01:36:32.860 --> 01:36:35.080]
Program at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center

[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:38.140]
Anchere some questions about pain medications and addictions

[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.240]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:40.620]
Question.

[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:45.100]
Rush Limbaugh's problems have been linked to OxyContin and the Loque...

[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:45.540]
What is it?

[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:46.080]
Lorcan?

[01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.220]
I don't think that's spelled right.

[01:36:47.340 --> 01:36:47.640]
Lorset.

[01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:48.800]
Bad facts.

[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:51.060]
Lorset, which includes hydrocodone.

[01:36:51.380 --> 01:36:54.540]
For what conditions are these drugs normally prescribed and how are they different?

[01:36:55.220 --> 01:36:58.740]
OxyContin is for chronic pain, and it needs to be released around the clock, because Bill Haley would say,

[01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:00.520]
and we just do that a little while ago, did we?

[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:05.620]
And as a controlled release format, though, OxyContin is available in immediate release form,

[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:11.520]
Lorset is available for a treatment of pain on an as-needed basis, both are opiodo-opioids.

[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:12.600]
Opioids.

[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:13.720]
Opioids.

[01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:15.920]
And both peak about an hour after you take them.

[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:16.320]
They peak.

[01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:18.520]
Want to take a peak?

[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:19.580]
Question.

[01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.440]
One of the pain killers most often lead to addiction.

[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:24.220]
It has more to do with how you take the drugs than the drugs themselves.

[01:37:24.860 --> 01:37:28.840]
OxyContin, if taken is directed, is not likely to cause dependence, but if you crush the tablet,

[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:30.820]
you circumvent the slower these mechanisms.

[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:37.580]
Drugs you take orally have a slower onset, less likely to be addictive, but by smoking or injecting any opio-opioids,

[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.500]
it can take only 10 seconds to get to the brain.

[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.080]
They also shoot that.

[01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:42.860]
Why?

[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:44.420]
They crush them up and snort them.

[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.460]
It's more potent and addictive that way.

[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.440]
Was he having a rip snorting good time?

[01:37:50.580 --> 01:37:51.060]
Is that what you're saying?

[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:52.040]
Is he was taking up the nose?

[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:53.080]
Oh no.

[01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:54.440]
Maybe he was just chewing them up.

[01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:55.880]
You think so?

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:56.640]
Yeah, I do.

[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.700]
Well, maybe that's why I can keep telling you.

[01:37:58.780 --> 01:37:59.420]
You didn't have time to eat.

[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.100]
You lost all that weight.

[01:38:00.240 --> 01:38:03.640]
When you're taking 30,000 pills a year, you don't have time for no food, no moe.

[01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.340]
Like candy.

[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:05.720]
Right, like exactly.

[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:10.360]
Without the calories, which I have a really good story about the low carb diets.

[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:11.940]
Poor doctor.

[01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:13.860]
Well, that's some of that stuff.

[01:38:13.860 --> 01:38:16.480]
I don't want to read the whole thing, but anyway, it says the rate of staying

[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:18.240]
at them is about 40%.

[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:21.480]
The longest day of the treatment program, the better your chances of success.

[01:38:21.940 --> 01:38:24.320]
Methadone is a very effective treatment for people who've tried at

[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.720]
abstinence and not been able to make it work.

[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.080]
And it goes on and on and on.

[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:32.080]
Finger pointing, phony, son of a bitch.

[01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:33.340]
That's exactly what you are.

[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:39.800]
Lier, douchebag, scumbag, pepper, a bullcrap, and WBAL and Baltimore is dropping the

[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.280]
Russian embouchure until it comes back if he does, if and when.

[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.840]
And they're running his substitutes overnight on the graveyard shift, kind of like when

[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:47.540]
you went marker on.

[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:48.180]
What is that, tell you?

[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:50.620]
By the way, speaking of that, did anybody come in with a check?

[01:38:52.540 --> 01:38:52.900]
What?

[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:53.640]
Sorry.

[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.660]
You keep laughing like I don't really expect some people are in a building who are making

[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.260]
some big bucks to help us out.

[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:01.300]
I'm not talking about the peons like you lost it.

[01:39:01.460 --> 01:39:02.100]
You keep joking.

[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.620]
No, I'm not joking.

[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:06.160]
I'm not joking, but I'm not joking.

[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:10.460]
In fact, if you're well, I guarantee you're for all bring us a check for ban and

[01:39:10.460 --> 01:39:11.900]
pay rescue if he ever comes back again.

[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:13.200]
If they ever give us over to Ellen.

[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:13.620]
What?

[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:14.800]
Did he start to get paid yet?

[01:39:18.080 --> 01:39:19.000]
They're holding on to that.

[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.700]
Yeah, they're hanging on to it just in case.

[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:21.900]
They want to see how things work out.

[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:22.580]
He's sick.

[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:23.840]
He's out of the weather for all the way.

[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:25.040]
Anybody feed any BS?

[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:25.440]
Okay.

[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:26.380]
He's Ellen.

[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.160]
He's really Ellen.

[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:30.280]
A little bit too much parting with all the sports over the weekend.

[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:32.260]
How's that pool come?

[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:36.060]
It's an nobody brought in the 335 bucks that we need to get to 32 grand.

[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:37.400]
It's pretty demoralizing to me.

[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:39.220]
What a bunch of cheap bastards you people are.

[01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:41.220]
All the money I'm making you people.

[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.640]
343 votes on a pool and they're saying, yeah, we'll all the money you're making.

[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:46.800]
Well, I put in 10 grand.

[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:47.960]
How about you cheap bastards?

[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.080]
That's the point.

[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:53.360]
Dennis Miller 75, which so-called comedian to think is the least funny.

[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.420]
Dennis Miller's killing him.

[01:39:54.540 --> 01:39:54.900]
75.

[01:39:55.480 --> 01:39:56.380]
Tom Arnold's 60.

[01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:57.860]
Martin Lawrence, 27.

[01:39:58.060 --> 01:39:58.680]
What about Steve Lawrence?

[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.740]
And his brother that's the one in the elevator at the track.

[01:40:01.700 --> 01:40:06.400]
Whoopi Goldberg 26, Carrot Top 23, Rosie O'Donnell, we hate you, Rosie.

[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:08.380]
You fact disgusting?

[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:10.160]
How funny obnoxious?

[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:11.220]
Dike.

[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:16.720]
Bob Sagitt 15, Wanda Sykes 12, Ben Styth 11.

[01:40:17.140 --> 01:40:18.840]
I'm surprised that many people know who Wanda Sykes is.

[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.560]
What is she on?

[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:20.880]
Drug drugs.

[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:21.700]
No, seriously.

[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:22.300]
What is she on?

[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.620]
She was on inside the NFL last year for about three days.

[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:27.180]
She was on inside the NFL?

[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.560]
How about that?

[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.000]
She had her hazard show or something.

[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:32.820]
At three or four shows and that was it.

[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:35.860]
Now, was she like picking up logs off the field or what?

[01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:37.300]
Kicking alligators.

[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.480]
1157, three minutes till noon at 560 WDQ.

[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:45.580]
And by the way, keep your hands off Tom Brady Wanda and Brady Quinn too while you're at it.

[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.580]
In order to aim sucks and they got a hot quarterback.

[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:50.340]
And like, I keep saying that every day because it's like dying, going to heaven.

[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:51.300]
Well, more could you want.

[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.540]
He's a true freshman by the way, George, aren't you impressed?

[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.020]
Huh?

[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:57.860]
I know what he means.

[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:58.700]
That's the greatest.

[01:40:58.980 --> 01:41:01.040]
I just, I get, yeah, it's okay.

[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:01.440]
It's right.

[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:01.900]
Is he?

[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:02.440]
Wow.

[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:03.640]
Hey, I got to leave.

[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:05.320]
I want a way to South Bend.

[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.460]
I want to see if I can bend it.

[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.840]
Here's a place where you won't get bent out of shape.

[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:10.040]
Howl at potty at GMC.

[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.160]
I wonder if Bob, you think Bob Eisenberg is still alive?

[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:13.240]
Yeah.

[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:16.780]
Because he and the rest of that sales department, I told him off this morning, man.

[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.760]
That sales department, you can't complain about the job they're doing with copy label because they're not doing one.

[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:23.020]
They're just, they're, they're a wall like a president.

[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:24.840]
They're just a absolute out leave.

[01:41:25.380 --> 01:41:26.780]
They're just like flitting around.

[01:41:26.800 --> 01:41:29.240]
I guess spending all the money that they're milking out of the rest of us.

[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.880]
The 2003 Near Rogers Blowout sale is still going on.

[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.280]
So it says Bob Eisenberg at Hal at potty at GMC.

[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.180]
Get the lowest prices in town from town.

And all remaining 2003 models including the Yukon and on-voy XL.

[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:51.380]
When in doubt, they're blowing it up.

[01:41:51.380 --> 01:41:55.220]
And Neal Deal number two gets 0% financing for up to five years.

[01:41:55.680 --> 01:42:03.260]
And listen to this, you can lease a fully loaded 2004 Grand Prix GT for only $259 a month for 36 months with 12,000 miles a year.

[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.800]
And 25 hundred bucks out of pocket is all you pay.

[01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:11.740]
And as always, as they have for over 35 long excruciating years, almost as long as Rick Shaw's been puking it out on the radio,

they've got a great selection of unbeatable pre-owned car structures and SUVs waiting on you too.

And if you're worried about your credit, if you have a blemish or two or a whole bunch,

[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:23.620]
it's very rarely a problem because they want to work with you to cut you a deal and get you into a new vehicle at Hal at Pontiac.

[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:30.460]
It's the big 2003 blowout sale going on right now at Hal at Pontiac GMC 13401 South Dixie Highway.

That's 1-Triple 8-534-4222.

[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.740]
I've no figured all Neal deals.

[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:44.420]

Way to A.M.

[01:42:56.140 --> 01:43:00.900]
Fairer, it beat it 12-1-1 on WQM.

[01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:11.860]
She's a perfect match in you who likes to flash her pants in you.

[01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:15.340]
When she don't have those on you.

[01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:19.080]
She's hanging like the straw me on right.

[01:43:19.300 --> 01:43:21.200]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:25.180]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:29.260]
Imagine what you can catch.

[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:33.360]
From Ann Colters Snatch.

[01:43:36.620 --> 01:43:40.600]
Wanna be upon you.

[01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:43.000]
Scratches with a brush.

[01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:46.620]
She's danker all though.

[01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:51.140]
And Ilmar, but you'll never get drugged.

[01:43:51.180 --> 01:43:53.060]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:43:54.640 --> 01:43:57.200]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:43:58.420 --> 01:44:01.400]
A swirling pool of crap.

[01:44:02.540 --> 01:44:05.260]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:10.560]
Using pleasure and boister.

[01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:17.900]
Walking with the billows.

[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:21.860]
Burmely hand inside of her butt.

[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:23.900]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:27.540]
And Colters Ramps in Snatch.

[01:44:28.740 --> 01:44:31.120]
No one to know what it could hatch.

[01:44:32.520 --> 01:44:34.280]
From Ann Colters Snatch.

[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:37.080]
So guess what General Wesley Clark had at the Rascal House yesterday.

[01:44:37.700 --> 01:44:37.820]
What?

[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:39.340]
Pastramian Rhyme.

[01:44:39.780 --> 01:44:41.780]
With sauce?

[01:44:42.840 --> 01:44:43.360]
Special sauce.

[01:44:43.380 --> 01:44:44.540]
Anyway, we tell you who this is.

[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:46.620]
You just will tickle your tonsils.

[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.620]
If it ever starts playing.

[01:44:49.340 --> 01:44:51.900]
Of course, these things start like wheeling hot and...

[01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:53.880]
...there's people like that.

[01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:56.880]
It's time to eat.

[01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.240]
Why wonder it's your musicality?

[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:01.680]
With the hottest new hits.

[01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:05.120]
This week featuring the latest four-cent-deafs.

[01:45:07.660 --> 01:45:08.320]
Pickerel.

[01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:10.720]
The first picker of the day.

[01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:12.460]
Chris is a revolution.

[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:15.320]
And Man, he went to school.

[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:16.760]
The jacks are down.

[01:45:17.340 --> 01:45:18.180]
The first pick is five.

[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:18.900]
One out.

[01:45:19.180 --> 01:45:20.620]
The second pick is nine.

[01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:26.480]
The most listened to radio station in Florida.

[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:28.680]
And a worldwide foreign hit musician.

[01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:29.900]
And War One.

[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:34.160]
The second pick is nine.

[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:39.760]
How one would win the first pick is nine.

[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:52.200]
哇, how about out there?

[01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:54.060]
Man, how's it running up?

[01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.260]
That's great.

[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:58.260]
Right.

[01:45:58.260 --> 01:45:59.620]
駿 DeHavenar, of course.

[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:00.820]
That's great glad to see you at,.

[01:46:00.820 --> 01:46:04.780]
Iuan are gone because he is the great vocalist on his own.

[01:46:04.780 --> 01:46:06.060]
Right, he's helped Zakara a long and long time.

[01:46:06.060 --> 01:46:07.520]
and that's gonna make them a superstar.

[01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.320]
Let's go, why can't this be level-plated again?

[01:46:09.460 --> 01:46:09.980]
Where's everybody going?

[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:11.360]
Around the Amidama, it's coming up,

[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:13.300]
homaday is coming up to Sado Gourmet.

[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:14.880]
Mostly cloudy, high 75.

[01:46:15.540 --> 01:46:17.720]
Rain shans about 50, 50 later on the day.

[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.160]
Rain rather than weather for the Grand Prix,

[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:21.720]
looks good though, sunny windy, but cold.

[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:23.440]
I have about 58 degrees tomorrow.

[01:46:23.620 --> 01:46:25.040]
So, you guys, the way you're racing jacket,

[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:25.760]
that's sweat a lot.

[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:26.320]
Yeah.

[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.320]
And athletes foot is coming up with sports.

[01:46:29.500 --> 01:46:30.460]
And out of the show this morning,

[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:33.400]
in person coming to our studios to be with us,

[01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.540]
AJ Flakes in the rest of the day.

[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:37.280]
So, little side out was going out of the ground.

[01:46:37.440 --> 01:46:38.220]
Preciting out of AJ.

[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:38.980]
Nice sunny.

[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:39.860]
Get lost.

[01:46:40.700 --> 01:46:42.180]
Sunny Fox, how do you like that?

[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:43.040]
Well, he was like,

[01:46:43.040 --> 01:46:43.360]
he was very close.

[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:44.440]
And for some strange reason,

[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:47.960]
he didn't have a good line though about his buddy there.

[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:48.560]
What the hell was his name?

[01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:49.820]
It was on the morning show for five minute.

[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:50.320]
Ron Hercy.

[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.000]
Ron Hercy, on a hurry he sent him,

[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000]
we sent him on Hershey Highway.

[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.620]
He had a good line, he said,

[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:56.520]
good things happen to people who deserve them

[01:46:56.520 --> 01:46:58.720]
about his former partner in crime on the air.

[01:46:59.160 --> 01:46:59.800]
Ron Hercy Highway.

[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:02.080]
Meaning, up here is Ron.

[01:47:02.220 --> 01:47:03.300]
That's what he was trying to tell you, Ron,

[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:04.540]
which I'm sure you already got the message.

[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.020]
Yeah.

[01:47:06.840 --> 01:47:08.060]
Sunny Fox has screwed you all around.

[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:08.960]
Hercy loves this show.

[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:10.000]
We love you too, Ron.

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:11.860]
Sunny Fox, we're not too sure about it.

[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:13.340]
I don't have any problems with Sunny Fox.

[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:14.540]
No.

[01:47:15.180 --> 01:47:15.780]
Do you?

[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:16.140]
No.

[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:17.460]
You have a problem with everybody.

[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:18.300]
That's not true.

[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.740]
I get along good with Sunny Fox.

[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:20.600]
I have no problem with it.

[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.520]
Hi, this is Sunny Fox.

[01:47:21.720 --> 01:47:22.520]
I have a Sunilla Rogers,

[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.740]
because I can hear the word asshole.

[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:24.080]
See?

[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:25.740]
He's listening right now.

[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:26.840]
Hey, Sunny, how's it going, eh?

[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:28.060]
What's he doing these days?

[01:47:29.220 --> 01:47:30.760]
Since he left the Hershey Highway.

[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:31.540]
I don't know.

[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:34.740]
Now, let's see.

[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:36.420]
Here's one that says, maybe you can explain to me.

[01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:37.920]
This is the same chronic factor.

[01:47:38.340 --> 01:47:39.400]
How are you settling for large sum?

[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:39.840]
Oh, you know what?

[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:43.160]
This must be the deal, the ones that they send in, the office pool.

[01:47:43.340 --> 01:47:44.160]
Remember you were telling me about that?

[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:44.460]
Right.

[01:47:45.020 --> 01:47:46.820]
They all sit around the office and they send me a bunch of

[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:49.800]
factors and then they bet each other as to which ones I'm going to read on

[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:50.020]
the ear.

[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:50.820]
How many they send it in?

[01:47:50.900 --> 01:47:52.100]
That's OK.

[01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:52.880]
Good factors.

[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:53.700]
They kill some good time.

[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:58.200]
Maybe you can explain to me how settling for large sums of money 30 years later.

[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:01.060]
But third, man, in all of the station cases makes it all better.

[01:48:01.860 --> 01:48:04.560]
It's not as if the money comes out of the priest pocket and turns them into a

[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:05.160]
suffering proper.

[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:08.400]
The settlement money comes out of the offering basket where the Sunday

[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:11.020]
automotons make the regular deposits.

[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:15.300]
I guess closure takes place when the victim drives away in a new Lexus.

[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:16.940]
Dirty deeds come dirt cheap.

[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.700]
It says a Tisca de Tasket.

[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:21.860]
Let me put an offering in your basket is what the priest says.

[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:23.280]
So there you go.

[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:24.580]
Stick something in my basket.

[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:29.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and for Ryzen Wireless Line.

[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.140]
We have to do a poll tomorrow.

[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:32.680]
Probably.

[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:36.800]
No, I'm just telling you right now before I forget it.

[01:48:36.940 --> 01:48:37.500]
I got to write it down.

[01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:37.920]
All right.

[01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.400]
Oh, man.

[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.040]
What was the greatest radio station?

[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:44.720]
Not your favorite.

[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:47.120]
What was the greatest radio station in history of South Florida?

[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:48.060]
What?

[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:49.800]
The fact that you corrected it right there.

[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:53.400]
Because that's what they'll vote for and that's what they'll call it.

[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:54.440]
Well, I don't care.

[01:48:54.620 --> 01:48:55.480]
No, this is tomorrow, though.

[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:55.960]
Not today.

[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:00.400]
And of course, this is not a limited list because there's a lot of them that aren't around

[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:00.660]
anymore.

[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:01.520]
They've changed call it.

[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.080]
It isn't formats.

[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:03.240]
That's a great.

[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:05.040]
And the history of South Florida.

[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.040]
God, I just want to write this out.

[01:49:07.040 --> 01:49:08.040]
So I don't forget about it.

[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.460]
Plus there ain't too much going on.

[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.020]
Let's see the whole.

[01:49:10.020 --> 01:49:10.240]
The state right now.

[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:11.140]
What?

[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:12.220]
QAM will win.

[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:13.680]
Yeah.

[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.400]
What about she, Mr. Huh?

[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.140]
What about she?

[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:17.420]
She's gone.

[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:18.820]
She's gone.

[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:19.800]
Well, too bad.

[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:20.760]
Okay.

[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:22.660]
Let me stick that right under Peewee Herman.

[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.540]
56670560, pound 560 on EAT and T. and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:28.580]
What's so-called comedian?

[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:30.060]
Do you think is the least funny?

[01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:34.320]
Dennis Miller's pulled away the way fairly safe lead over the anxious Tom Arnold.

[01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:36.320]
Oh, it's picking up Arnold.

[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.540]
Guess who bushes meeting with on Thursday this week?

[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:39.060]
I don't know.

[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:39.560]
Arnold?

[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.760]
Arnold, good guess.

[01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:42.660]
Now, who's going to be the intellect in that pairing?

[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:43.380]
Oh, boy.

[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:45.000]
We're going to get a translator.

[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:46.540]
They're both going to be an interpreter.

[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:48.300]
Here's coconut grove.

[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:48.480]
Hello.

[01:49:49.580 --> 01:49:49.800]
Hello.

[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:50.700]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:50.700 --> 01:49:52.280]
Here are you, everybody.

[01:49:52.380 --> 01:49:52.620]
Okay.

[01:49:53.100 --> 01:49:57.120]
Listen, my favorite comedian, I think most of them will be with me is George Bush.

[01:49:57.620 --> 01:49:58.520]
Just George Duck, you have to call.

[01:49:58.520 --> 01:49:58.740]
Yeah.

[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:01.960]
Oh, man.

[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.920]
Look at that, I just, I did that accidentally because he got me so flustered.

[01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:07.260]
You hung up on everybody, hasn't it?

[01:50:07.260 --> 01:50:09.740]
I kept it in the next button and they just knocked them all off.

[01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:10.320]
That's okay.

[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:10.900]
They'll call back.

[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:12.400]

[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.280]
Man, you know something, even a champion rooster.

[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:32.900]
Well, roosters don't lay hands, do they?

[01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:34.680]
They lay hands.

[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:35.900]
They lay hands.

[01:50:36.020 --> 01:50:37.140]

[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.620]
No, no, they don't.

[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.640]
You just rooster lay hands.

[01:50:39.780 --> 01:50:40.260]
That's what you said.

[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.580]
Do roosters have penises?

[01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:44.800]
They have something.

[01:50:46.540 --> 01:50:47.580]
Just let it go.

[01:50:47.780 --> 01:50:48.540]
What does a rooster have?

[01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:48.600]
Yeah.

[01:50:48.780 --> 01:50:50.080]
I never thought about this before.

[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:51.660]

[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:52.180]

[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:01.440]
But they don't pee with their thing?

[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:07.140]
Well, I'm serious, they don't pee because you'll notice a bird drops like it.

[01:51:07.180 --> 01:51:08.760]
All it's all together is all in one.

[01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:10.000]
It's a two-in-one deal.

[01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:10.240]

[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:15.020]
You can just they're pork it up like you wouldn't believe even petunia pigstard among for the hills

[01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:19.620]
If you're one of those people you've tried everything you know to lose weight if you're sick and tired of being unhealthy

[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:24.300]
You have a no energy of being wearing puktens because they don't make any clothes that really fit your big fat ass

[01:53:24.300 --> 01:53:28.920]
Here's the answer that you've been looking for balance for life because it's simple for simple people

They do the work for you. They do all the cooking you don't have to count any calories or carbs because they do that for you too

[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:44.200]
But the problem is it's very difficult to compute they do the computing for you and deliver right to your door a black sack every morning

[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:49.200]

And the number of the beast is 666 let this is wait

[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:22.400]

So I know. That's okay. At least I got him. Yeah, I know. Anyway, let's take a look at the

[02:16:33.640 --> 02:16:38.980]
Apple here. What's so-called comedian you think is the least funny and some people

[02:16:38.980 --> 02:16:44.520]
of Senes there are less than the 80 least. Dennis Miller 95. Nice going folks. Dennis Miller

[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:49.580]
blows. We can't stand him. He's a borish asshole is what he is. A

[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:55.440]
borish bush-looking asshole Tom Arnold 70. Rosio Domla is tied with Carrotop.

[02:16:55.580 --> 02:16:58.860]
Ever seen him together? Yeah. Same person. 37.

[02:16:59.820 --> 02:17:06.400]
We'll be Goldberg 36. Martin Lawrence's got 30, man. Bob Sagitt. Rhymes would

[02:17:07.500 --> 02:17:15.120]
Baggett 29. Wanda Sykes 16. That third burger. Ben Stein 15. Jury Seinfeld 12. And Jury

[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:18.820]
Lewis 10. How am I? Mandel's got nine. He had to be doing better than that. Got to be doing a

[02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:23.880]
lot more than just- Yeah. Oh boy. How are you freaking Mandel? Just like that fact said,

[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:29.100]
he makes my skin crawl. What is supposed to be funny about him just because he's stupid?

[02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:32.920]
Long time ago he put a rubber glove on his head and blew it up with his nose. Oh is that what it was?

[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:36.320]
Oh yeah, he killed him. G-tubed it didn't work though. Didn't finish the job.

[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:40.900]
5, 6, 7, let's take a couple of calls because we got all those fat stories to talk about.

[02:17:41.100 --> 02:17:45.400]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Dale. Yes sir. Hey how you doing?

[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:50.900]
Pretty good. Hey good listen. I went under City TV because I was so interested on what they have

[02:17:50.900 --> 02:17:58.320]
up there. Everything's American. What? On City TV. Yeah. Yeah. How come- I mean if it's Canada,

[02:17:58.560 --> 02:18:05.320]
why don't they have American- Canadian stuff? On what? On City TV. Like what? What are you talking about?

[02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:13.820]
The programming? Yeah, City TV is Canadian. They're all they're showing is the bachelor and this and that.

[02:18:13.820 --> 02:18:18.520]
Right exactly because they only have the CRTC only makes them show a certain percentage of

[02:18:18.520 --> 02:18:23.280]
Canadian programming 40 or 50 percent because Canada doesn't produce all those TV shows. You know that.

[02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:28.500]
In addition to which if you're so enamored with all those shows go watch them on American TV

[02:18:28.500 --> 02:18:34.100]
asshole. Just amazing. They were a tool to shots. If you don't like Canada, don't come here.

[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:37.580]
We don't need you. We're doing just fine. If you don't like Toronto, don't ever darken

[02:18:37.580 --> 02:18:41.320]
our door. If you don't like a hockey, don't go to a hockey game. If you don't like Chiebert,

[02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:45.400]
don't eat cheeseburgers. If you don't like Vegas, don't go there and have a good time. It's very

[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:49.800]
simple. It's like I'm in some kind of a contest like I'm trying to convince them trying to convert

[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:55.260]
the world. Forget about it, okay? Especially in other Canadian dollars worth almost 76 cents

[02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:58.220]
you wasted. It's starting to really frost my ass because it used to be a hell of a good bargain

[02:18:58.220 --> 02:19:03.760]
in your last summer when it was only 62 putt would cent and out 76 and American dollars like

[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:08.900]
in the Euro is like a buck 16. It was up to a buck 18 the other day. What kind of crap is that?

[02:19:08.900 --> 02:19:12.760]
What kind of a communist bunch of crap is that? So in other words when you go to Europe you have to

[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:19.940]
pay through your nose like Rush would say you have to take it up the nose. So you're thinking

[02:19:19.940 --> 02:19:24.240]
that he was just two in them right? I really don't know. We don't know. I mean why should we

[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:27.940]
speculate? Because it's fun. I'm sure he's too upstanding to resort to anything like that so he

[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:36.320]
Oh yeah 30,000 man how many? About 30 man. You've got to be popping him you're right by the

[02:19:36.320 --> 02:19:45.580]
handful like M&M's right right bags of him. He was eating M&M. Okay just come to

[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:52.340]
Russian M&M I can see that. Kuneo that's a good pairing. 5670560 pound 560 now that check

[02:19:52.340 --> 02:19:56.880]
come in is our positive. I just I said it. What? What? What? What? Are you telling me what? Air check?

[02:19:57.480 --> 02:20:04.740]
No they have a bank check. What makes the raffle? Cash. The green. The pink

[02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:10.940]
card is something. 300 and the cabbage. Where's our cabbage? Okay. One does got it. Yeah one

[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:18.240]
has got the cabbage. 631,065. 355 would make my day. Get us right to 32 grand plus whatever's

[02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:23.200]
coming down the internet. Is Miguel like hanging out today or what? Is he hanging out with

[02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:28.420]
him? Days his day off I believe. Oh wow. And what about Saturday and Sunday? He works

[02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:33.040]
those days. Tipo that's our with all the sports crap. I forget about that. That's the problem

[02:20:33.040 --> 02:20:37.420]
and it's where we'll never ever ever give what we deserve on this day. So although we'll

[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:41.820]
take the paychecks thank you but we'll never get the the assistance. The assistance with

[02:20:41.820 --> 02:20:46.120]
the support. Oh support. Forget about that. We're going to work with him. We're not a

[02:20:46.120 --> 02:20:51.520]
sports show and if Miguel was a man. I'm meant reasonably decent man. We wouldn't get

[02:20:51.520 --> 02:20:55.120]
anything. We wouldn't get squat. So remind me to tell Duff off tomorrow morning when he comes

[02:20:55.120 --> 02:20:59.360]
in there when he comes in for his like oh gee my back's not too bad and I'm feeling pretty good

[02:20:59.360 --> 02:21:04.040]
and did you see me with a hat. Duff is so into himself it's unbelievable. Wish I get somebody's

[02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:11.080]
got to be. Here's a call from four Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. I can't believe no one has

[02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:16.720]
brought up or maybe they have. I just turned it on Al Franken. To me that guy has no first he

[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:21.240]
started on Saturday and Alivian. One funny little bit. Yeah. Then he failed at the comic and now he's

[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:26.540]
trying to be another Rush Limbaugh. Well I think he's a sterile but to make you happy he's

[02:21:26.540 --> 02:21:29.440]
trying to be another Rush Limbaugh. Is he doing all his drugs? I don't know he'd have a coat

[02:21:29.440 --> 02:21:34.480]
problem. He's going to wait and he's trying to go radio show. He wants to start a liberal radio show.

[02:21:34.540 --> 02:21:38.660]
Well Bill I hope he does. I hope it starts tomorrow. Al Franken we'll put him on there to make you

[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:42.700]
happy. There's another guy who's obviously in mourning. Some of the rushes they finally get up

[02:21:42.700 --> 02:21:47.960]
off the floor. Remember I told you this and you didn't believe me those first few days after I

[02:21:48.060 --> 02:21:53.140]
read the first story from the inquire and they were crumbling it was like they were emotionally

[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:57.800]
so distraught that they were like falling apart at the seams. You bring up an issue a point though.

[02:21:58.500 --> 02:22:03.440]
Now that Rush isn't on what they're all be over here bugging us because they don't have their boy

[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.840]
okay that's fine we certainly welcome them with open arms and legs but of course the only

[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:13.480]
question is since they're good most of them very good holier than now better than us believing

[02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:19.680]
Christians and honest and true and respectable like Rush himself right you know if they do have

[02:22:19.680 --> 02:22:22.900]
any have those diaries that you think you're going to put us down no they're part of the closet

[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:26.680]
audience so they'll keep writing Rush even as well as the show has done over the years can you

[02:22:26.680 --> 02:22:32.160]
imagine with the number in fact remember the poll I took the last one about them what which one

[02:22:32.160 --> 02:22:37.460]
was it what was the name of it about who they whose work oh yeah whose work they hate and they

[02:22:37.460 --> 02:22:42.260]
also think is an asshole and I got a bunch of votes on there so now you think that those people

[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:47.940]
are gonna like put it down if they get a direct no that's not the lie like Christians do right

[02:22:47.940 --> 02:22:52.260]
like good Christians they're lied to support the rush or wherever else my rule me anybody else who

[02:22:52.260 --> 02:22:59.560]
might be on life that's why you get all those diaries oh well males 18 to 34 they're all listening

[02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:05.040]
to life right my ass they would nowhere to find especially in South Florida they would

[02:23:05.040 --> 02:23:10.340]
nowhere to find a life with both hands oh look at that look what I did but you can't see it but

[02:23:10.340 --> 02:23:20.000]
you'd be mighty impressed hold it up so you can't hear it one more time Rush that's enough

[02:23:21.440 --> 02:23:26.300]
speaking of him report fat Americans are gonna even fatter yeah we just we just had two in a

[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:30.460]

[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:36.980]
and the one before them same old tired crap oh gee poor Rush was so take it out on us we don't

[02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:41.160]
care we're getting I'm getting paid a lot of money Georgia's you know he's scraping by yeah and

[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:26.860]
there were little children crying all the way in Buffalo right now Supreme Court clears way for

[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:31.140]
medical pot oh this is the best news is they're more to this story facts me the other page

of the York Post clear right up just in how come we haven't seen this on CNN yet those bastards

[02:24:36.780 --> 02:24:42.260]
I don't know too busy with wolf blitzkrieg you're doing his goose stepping the Supreme Court the

[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:46.620]
US Supreme Court cleared the way today for state laws allowing ill patients to smoke marijuana

[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:51.740]
if a doctor recommends it how do you like that we're talking about doctor recommended not just some

[02:24:51.740 --> 02:25:00.700]
pill pop up I think you're pardon not just Wanda recommended are you fixing me the other page yes

[02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:06.520]
one of three it said justice is turned down the Bush administrations request to consider whether

[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:10.380]
the federal government can punish doctors for recommending or perhaps just talking about the bed

[02:25:10.380 --> 02:25:15.300]
oh oh this is this is unbelievable I only got the two pages though yeah that's okay just this

[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:18.700]
is turned down the Bush administrations request to consider whether the federal government can

[02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:23.300]
punish doctors for recommending or perhaps just talking about the benefits of the drug to sick

[02:25:23.300 --> 02:25:30.180]
patients and appeals court said the government can't nine states have laws legalizing marijuana for

[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:36.140]
people with physician recommendations their prescriptions Alaska Arizona California Colorado Hawaii

[02:25:36.140 --> 02:25:41.700]
Maine Nevada Organa Washington and of course conspicuously absent its Florida and 35 states of

[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:47.120]
past legislation recognizing marijuana as medicinal value but federal law bans the use of pot under

[02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:51.800]
any circumstances wise which they keep going out there to California and bustin all them people

[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:57.520]
where just obeying the state law the case gave the court an opportunity to review with second medical

[02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:03.080]
marijuana case in two years the last one involved cannabis clubs this one presented a more

[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:07.080]
difficult issue pitting free speech rights of doctors against government power to keep positions

[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:10.800]
from encouraging illegal drug use a ruling for the Bush administration would have made the state

[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:21.340]
medical marijuana laws unusable but the good news is did it happen no so there you go 1257 at 560 QAM

102 at 560 WQM happy Tuesday Virusabad

[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:03.140]
I'm coming over it to humper hot football game I baby marlins at the cups its the most win for the marlins at causes

[02:28:03.140 --> 02:28:03.540]
them

[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:07.580]
I'm not going to jump on a cub band wagon at this point

[02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:09.020]
because I used to be a cub band

[02:28:09.020 --> 02:28:10.320]
that was there there it was in

[02:28:10.320 --> 02:28:10.820]
youtube

[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:11.300]
You know what?

[02:28:12.180 --> 02:28:17.180]
Who now needs the freaking cubs and all their whining and carrying on all that stuff?

[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:18.820]
Hey Neil, f*** you!

[02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:21.860]
Anyway, getting back to the Supreme Court throwing away from medical pot story.

[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:27.020]
Some California doctors and patients in filing said the Supreme Court compared doctor

[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:31.100]
information on pot to physicians advice on red wine to reduce the risk of heart disease,

[02:28:31.660 --> 02:28:33.820]
vitamin C, acupuncture or chicken soup.

[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:35.740]
How do you like that?

[02:28:36.100 --> 02:28:38.740]
In fact, a lot of people thought there was like herbs.

[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:39.720]
Well, it wasn't herb.

[02:28:40.020 --> 02:28:40.660]
Herbal remedy.

[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:41.760]
On top of the chicken soup.

[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:45.760]
The administration argued that public health not the first membrane to free speech rights

[02:28:45.760 --> 02:28:47.280]
of doctors or patients was at stake.

[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:51.340]
Oh, Ted Olson, the solicitor general, who's a real major asshole even if his wife did

[02:28:51.340 --> 02:28:52.160]
get killed in that plane.

[02:28:52.500 --> 02:28:54.320]
He's a major, major right wing asshole.

[02:28:54.580 --> 02:28:55.380]
A Nazi, I would say.

[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:55.680]
Yes.

[02:28:56.220 --> 02:29:00.360]
Ted Olson said in court papers, the provision of medical advice, whether it be that the patient

[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:04.460]
take aspirin or vitamin C, loser gain weight, exercise or rest, smoker refrain from smoking

[02:29:04.460 --> 02:29:05.820]
marijuana is not pure speech.

[02:29:06.180 --> 02:29:07.940]
It's the conduct of the practice of medicine.

[02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:10.560]
As such, it's subject to reasonable regulation.

[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:12.020]
He said, well, I don't think so.

[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:16.300]
In states with medical marijuana laws, doctors can give written or oral recommendations on

[02:29:16.300 --> 02:29:16.520]
marriage.

[02:29:16.540 --> 02:29:19.460]
We need to patients with cancer, HIV, and other serious illnesses.

[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:21.720]
And if he, that doctor can't get it for your rush can.

[02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:26.640]
Even some supporters of laws that expected these supreme court to step into the case, they

[02:29:26.640 --> 02:29:30.420]
said the courts refusal to intervene, although it does not address the merits of the case,

[02:29:30.500 --> 02:29:33.940]
could encourage other states to consider passing medical marijuana laws.

[02:29:34.520 --> 02:29:38.640]
It's finally definitively put to rest these federal threats against doctors and patients

[02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:42.900]
to grim bore it in ACLU attorney representing patients, doctors and other groups in the case.

[02:29:43.240 --> 02:29:46.480]
Anyway, also the supreme court accepts Pledge of Allegiance case today.

[02:29:47.680 --> 02:29:51.580]
The US Supreme Court agreed today to hear a case involving whether school children can

[02:29:51.580 --> 02:29:55.480]
be allowed to recite the Pledge of Allegiance voluntarily, putting a family's custody

[02:29:55.480 --> 02:29:58.580]
dispute at the forefront of a constitution legal battle.

[02:29:59.000 --> 02:30:00.820]
I think if they say one nation under.

[02:30:01.460 --> 02:30:02.580]
I think that's okay.

[02:30:04.260 --> 02:30:05.260]
They're going to ask me.

[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:06.120]
I hope they do.

[02:30:06.220 --> 02:30:06.920]
I'm waiting for the call.

[02:30:08.300 --> 02:30:12.440]
An issue is whether the Pledge of Allegiance to be banned from public schools for its

[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:13.640]
use of the words under God.

[02:30:14.500 --> 02:30:18.760]
Constitutional scholars have debated for years whether the Pledge serves as both a patriotic

[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:20.240]
oath and a form of public prayer.

[02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.900]
Court arguments in this case, we heard next June with the ruling, next year with the ruling

[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:25.640]
expected by June.

[02:30:25.900 --> 02:30:29.080]
Too bad we can't put the pieces of Madeline O'Hare back together just long enough to

[02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:29.760]
handle this one.

[02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:30.140]
All right.

[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:31.660]
Stits at bitch.

[02:30:31.900 --> 02:30:32.300]
We'll get Frank.

[02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:33.240]
Get signed up bitch.

[02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:34.340]
Stock Frank on the case.

[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:35.760]
They're all in cat lecture.

[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:36.740]
She was a panic man.

[02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:38.000]
I had her on my show how many times.

[02:30:38.060 --> 02:30:38.880]
About third man.

[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:39.380]
Third time.

[02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:40.200]
She was something else.

[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:42.800]
She was a real ballbuster man.

[02:30:42.920 --> 02:30:45.040]
She didn't take no crap from anybody until right at the end there.

[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:48.200]
Right, right near the ass end.

[02:30:49.440 --> 02:30:51.060]
Here's the way to pull us going so far.

[02:30:51.200 --> 02:30:52.940]
What so called can a comedian?

[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:54.900]
Do you think is the least funny?

[02:30:55.320 --> 02:30:56.640]
A real piece of turd.

[02:30:56.640 --> 02:30:58.640]
Dennis Mellers got an even hundred vote.

[02:30:58.740 --> 02:30:59.680]
Nice going Dennis.

[02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:00.260]
You suck.

[02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:06.440]
Tom Arnold 71 with the Goldberg 40 Caratop 38, Rosio Donald 38, Martin Lawrence and Bob

[02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:07.020]
Sagitt.

[02:31:07.420 --> 02:31:08.440]
Each have 31.

[02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:11.700]
And after the Sagitt it's one and then it's double digits.

[02:31:12.580 --> 02:31:15.580]
18 for one to psych 17 for Ben Stein and on the coast.

[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:17.720]
How many for Chris Rock?

[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:19.480]
Just out of curiosity.

[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:20.960]
Well Frankens got three.

[02:31:21.020 --> 02:31:22.660]
That's the rush crowd.

[02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:24.460]
Six for Chris.

[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:26.000]
Chris Rock has got six.

[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.200]
Oh my god.

[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.320]
Jack Emasons got five.

[02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:32.040]
So let me tell you about Jack Emasons at the Eden Rock Hotel a hundred years ago on

[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:32.540]
Miami Beach.

[02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:34.320]
He was doing the same thing back then.

[02:31:34.660 --> 02:31:37.660]
You know, he's one of those people who's always, it was like my grandmother.

[02:31:38.060 --> 02:31:39.140]
They were always old.

[02:31:39.400 --> 02:31:40.160]
They were born old.

[02:31:40.340 --> 02:31:40.800]
You know what I mean?

[02:31:40.980 --> 02:31:41.100]
Sure.

[02:31:41.200 --> 02:31:43.400]
When he was 20 he was the same as he is now.

[02:31:43.600 --> 02:31:44.380]
Now he's about a hundred.

[02:31:45.120 --> 02:31:46.060]
Probably when he was...

[02:31:46.060 --> 02:31:46.940]
Stop turning man.

[02:31:47.080 --> 02:31:47.440]
No difference.

[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:52.440]
Speaking of difference man, here's the big, I'll get to the pastor after we take couple

[02:31:52.440 --> 02:31:52.940]
calls, right?

[02:31:52.940 --> 02:31:57.180]
I'm trying to drop a few of these in because I'm waiting for somebody who haven't heard

[02:31:57.180 --> 02:31:57.740]
from me yet today.

[02:31:58.100 --> 02:31:58.560]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:58.940]
Hello.

[02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:00.300]
Hello?

[02:32:00.700 --> 02:32:01.140]
Yes sir.

[02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:02.720]
He'll got three names for you.

[02:32:03.160 --> 02:32:06.300]
I'm pretty much you can take anybody that's had an HBO special in the last five years

[02:32:06.300 --> 02:32:07.420]
put them at the top of that list.

[02:32:08.020 --> 02:32:12.020]
So Ellen DeGeneres, Sinbad and Richard Lewis, categorically unfunny.

[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:13.200]
Who is the second one?

[02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:15.040]
Ellen DeGeneres, Sinbad.

[02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:17.100]
Oh Sinbad, I think he's down there.

[02:32:17.640 --> 02:32:18.760]
Oh, all for him.

[02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:19.380]
Just call my name.

[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:19.820]
Richard Lewis.

[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:21.160]
You got him man.

[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:21.980]
All right later.

[02:32:21.980 --> 02:32:22.400]
Thanks.

[02:32:22.860 --> 02:32:24.340]
Richard Lewis, let's get him on air, okay?

[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:24.660]
Yes.

[02:32:25.060 --> 02:32:26.520]
Can we have more than one Lewis on the list?

[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:26.740]
Sure.

[02:32:26.900 --> 02:32:28.080]
Got your elus, Richard Lewis.

[02:32:28.900 --> 02:32:30.560]
We got the Robert Lewis Stevenson.

[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.440]
We got this corn churra special, ain't it Louis?

[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:34.660]
Uh huh.

[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:39.820]
I want to tell you right now, I'm going to make a list of movies if you've never seen

[02:32:39.820 --> 02:32:41.100]
them that you're just...

[02:32:41.520 --> 02:32:42.460]
You're not alive.

[02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:44.720]
We got an EO for you man.

[02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:45.200]
Yeah.

[02:32:45.520 --> 02:32:49.320]
If you haven't seen deliverance of the Godfather's all three parts then you're just a network,

[02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:50.540]
right?

[02:32:50.960 --> 02:32:51.140]
Right.

[02:32:51.140 --> 02:32:52.200]
And Kuku's nest.

[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:52.900]
And Requiem.

[02:32:53.340 --> 02:32:54.660]
I want to get banned Requiem for a dream.

[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:56.720]
I want to get back to the movie thing after vacation.

[02:32:56.820 --> 02:32:59.500]
I'm going to do like months and months and months of movie stuff.

[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:00.660]
That's what I know.

[02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:02.600]
Yeah, I'm just moving intensive.

[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:06.920]
Because since we stopped talking about it, I haven't been watching any of you.

[02:33:07.140 --> 02:33:10.820]
I've got a whole bunch of DVDs in there in my DVDs and I haven't been watching them

[02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:11.720]
because it's just, I don't know.

[02:33:11.940 --> 02:33:13.280]
We'll see Fargo already, will you?

[02:33:13.620 --> 02:33:14.380]
I don't have it.

[02:33:14.900 --> 02:33:15.440]
Damn it.

[02:33:15.820 --> 02:33:16.640]
I don't have it.

[02:33:16.780 --> 02:33:17.460]
You got snatch though.

[02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.740]
I have snatch.

[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:20.400]
And you're jealous.

[02:33:21.060 --> 02:33:22.960]
Reports, fat Americans are getting even fatter.

[02:33:24.340 --> 02:33:28.760]
And just before I said that, I just like self-consciously reached out to them sitting here in my underwear.

[02:33:28.900 --> 02:33:31.940]
And I reached down and like squeezed, I pinched several inches.

[02:33:32.900 --> 02:33:33.480]
Of what?

[02:33:34.120 --> 02:33:35.060]
No, big flat.

[02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:36.780]
Oh, and a blower.

[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:38.240]
That's why you put several inches.

[02:33:38.300 --> 02:33:39.360]
I don't have several inches.

[02:33:39.380 --> 02:33:41.140]
So it should have been obvious I wasn't talking about that.

[02:33:41.500 --> 02:33:42.940]
I pinched several inches, man.

[02:33:43.440 --> 02:33:44.480]
A big gun.

[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:52.260]
And a report on CNN.com says fat Americans getting even fatter, extreme obesity is ballooning in US adults.

[02:33:52.740 --> 02:33:54.160]
And we keep talking about it.

[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:55.040]
You know what it's like?

[02:33:55.600 --> 02:33:57.860]
It's just like that Heraldosha I keep telling you about.

[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:00.560]
Which I don't think you saw it at only 800 pound guy or 600 pounds.

[02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:01.480]
How big have all done that?

[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:04.820]
Yeah, but the whole family was enormous fat.

[02:34:04.820 --> 02:34:08.600]
And they kept bringing all this take out.

[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:12.700]
I guess they were too embarrassed to have it delivered because they wanted everybody to see the,

[02:34:12.700 --> 02:34:16.220]
all the boxes, the empty boxes and chicken bones around the house.

[02:34:16.460 --> 02:34:23.200]
But they keep bringing all this tons and tons of food like five and six pizzas and 400 chicken wings.

[02:34:23.340 --> 02:34:26.040]
And they'd all sit around there crying while they were eating.

[02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:26.560]

[02:34:28.380 --> 02:34:29.040]
Remember that?

[02:34:29.280 --> 02:34:29.400]
Sure.

[02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:30.600]
That's it.

[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:32.380]
So we keep talking about it.

[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:33.800]
And they were, oh, what are we going to do?

[02:34:33.900 --> 02:34:35.800]
It was just fatter and fatter and fatter.

[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:38.800]
Americans are just getting fatter.

[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.700]
They're ballooning to extremely obese proportions at an alarming rate.

[02:34:41.700 --> 02:34:45.220]
It says here the number of extremely obese American adults,

[02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:50.120]
those who are at least a hundred pounds overweight has quadrupled since the 1980s to about four million.

[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:52.340]
They were set to about one every 50 adults.

[02:34:53.100 --> 02:34:56.500]
I bet you I know somebody who give people some good advice and how to lose some and I wait.

[02:34:56.880 --> 02:34:57.780]
You know what it is?

[02:34:57.780 --> 02:34:59.720]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:00.260]
Wow.

[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.160]
Sarah, give it you say it's it's it's it worked for him.

[02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:08.100]
It worked like a charm for him and for Sarah.

[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:09.940]
I wonder how serious.

[02:35:09.940 --> 02:35:11.260]
Let's go visit Sarah over the weekend.

[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:12.880]
What do you say?

[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:16.640]
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

[02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:20.560]
And McGeldon like that movie.

[02:35:20.660 --> 02:35:21.540]
You know, McGell I don't care.

[02:35:21.660 --> 02:35:23.220]
It's you defended because one of your people.

[02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:24.300]
I don't sure that's what he does.

[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:24.540]
Look.

[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:25.000]
No, no.

[02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:26.740]
Seriously, he just is a fool.

[02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:27.740]
You know, he's a good guy.

[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:28.400]
He's just a fool.

[02:35:28.580 --> 02:35:29.460]
His taste is in his touch.

[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:31.080]
I don't disagree with that.

[02:35:31.080 --> 02:35:31.980]
That's what Doreen told me.

[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:34.160]
You got a tasty.

[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:41.020]
The number of extremely well about one and every 50 adults extreme obesity once was thought to be a rare distinct condition

[02:35:41.020 --> 02:35:43.280]
whose prevalence remained relatively steady over time.

[02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:53.120]
The new study contradicts that thinking and suggests that his leads partly do the same kinds of behavior over eating an underactivity that have contributed to the epidemic number of Americans would less severe weight problems.

[02:35:53.720 --> 02:36:03.640]
In fact, the findings by a ran corporation researcher shows that the number of extremely obesity also surged twice as fast as the number of less severely obese adults on the scale of obesity

[02:36:03.640 --> 02:36:06.040]
as the whole population shifts to the right.

[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.800]
The extreme categories grow the fastest and ran economist Roland's storm.

[02:36:10.080 --> 02:36:12.780]
He added these people of the highest health care costs.

[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:19.420]
Sturms at health problems associated with obesity including diabetes, oia, heart disease, high blood pressure, oia,

[02:36:19.420 --> 02:36:23.960]
and arthritis probably affect the extremely obese disproportionately and at young ages too.

[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:26.000]
Big fat tubs.

[02:36:29.740 --> 02:36:33.380]
And it goes on about body mass index and Americans tend to understate their weight.

[02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:38.420]
A recent study based on actual measurements found at obesity rate of nearly one three or almost 59 million people.

[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:41.840]
Sturms said his findings probably understate the problem for the same reason.

[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:47.900]
Wow, the average man with a BMI of 40 in Sturms study was five foot ten and three hundred pounds.

[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:55.440]
While the average woman was five foot four and two hundred and fifty huge, gigantic, blubberies, pounds.

[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:56.560]
Man.

[02:36:57.120 --> 02:36:59.680]
But I got good news for the one next piece we got here.

[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:00.880]
Ah, hey goodness.

[02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:02.300]
No, you don't.

[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:04.100]
Dr. Bob would be proud.

[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:05.340]
How's he doing, Dr. Bob?

[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:05.580]
Huh?

[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.000]
Let's piece him back together.

[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:08.480]
What a shame.

[02:37:08.660 --> 02:37:09.200]
He was a good guy.

[02:37:09.260 --> 02:37:11.300]
Had a personality like a dead man and I guess now.

[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:12.160]
It wasn't a good guy.

[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:12.940]
He had a good diet.

[02:37:13.340 --> 02:37:14.360]
No, he was a good guy.

[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:14.840]
No, he was a good guy.

[02:40:12.780 --> 02:40:13.460]
Like, near the lots.

[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:14.540]
We like to eat a lot.

[02:40:15.240 --> 02:40:16.580]
We like to casually ride.

[02:40:16.780 --> 02:40:17.500]
We like to leverload.

[02:40:17.560 --> 02:40:18.140]
We like to leverla.

[02:40:18.140 --> 02:40:18.480]
We like to leverla.

[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:19.380]
Or less not, beinh.

[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:36.040]
And we never knew we're being jailed.

[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:39.500]
117 at 560 WM. Here's the good news

[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:44.580]
Research surprise low-carb dieters eat more calories and still lose weight. Oh

[02:40:45.460 --> 02:40:49.060]
Ready for that. Why is that good for me? I love my carbs. I'm not talking about you

[02:40:49.060 --> 02:40:52.600]
I'm talking about a spat people. I don't be so insensitive that you don't care about anybody else

[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:57.160]
Just because you're like mr. Perfect to wait and not fat and disgusting just the disgusting part

[02:40:58.060 --> 02:40:58.860]
Fort Lauderdale

[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:03.700]
The dietary establishment is long argued is impossible and I have a lot of friends people

[02:41:03.700 --> 02:41:07.180]
I know it was all no it's all the calories all this other stuff is a bunch of alone

[02:41:07.180 --> 02:41:13.300]
It's all calories, but a new study offers intriguing evidence for the idea that people on low-carb diets can actually eat more

[02:41:13.300 --> 02:41:17.360]
Then those on standard low-fat plans and still lose weight

[02:41:17.900 --> 02:41:20.880]
There you go. Hey, Dr. Bob wake up a minute. What did this good news?

[02:41:21.460 --> 02:41:25.940]
Even though you may be an asshole perhaps no idea is more controversial in the diet world than the contention

[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:29.980]
Longest spas by the late doctor Robert Ackon see there it is Dr. Bob

[02:41:30.660 --> 02:41:35.680]
That people on low carbohydrate diets can consume more calories without paying a price on the scales

[02:41:36.220 --> 02:41:39.920]
Over the past years several small studies have shown to many experts of prize

[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:46.220]
To their shock. Oh my god that the Atkins approach actually does work better at least in the short run

[02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:52.680]
Dieters lose more than those on standard American Heart Association plan without driving up their cholesterol levels as many feared would happen

[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:54.860]
How many years ago? I tended that they didn't happen

[02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:03.340]
Yeah, yeah, your cholesterol levels actually dropping your triglyceride levels dropped to like a phenomenon like 66 77 a sunset strip

[02:42:03.340 --> 02:42:04.040]
They're great

[02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:07.980]
skeptics content however that these diners simply must be eating less

[02:42:07.980 --> 02:42:13.580]
I'm gonna go on a strict atkins right now. In fact, I've been on it all day like Sarah said like Sarah said of course

[02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:14.440]
It's only one 19

[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:20.000]
All I've been drinking is my caffeine-free diet so to no caffeine by the way forget the caffeine

[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:30.140]
It says skeptics content that these diners simply must be eating less maybe low carb diets are more satisfying so them can hungry or perhaps the food choices are just a limited low carb

[02:42:30.140 --> 02:42:31.640]
Diders are too bored to eat a lot sure

[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:38.620]
Now a small but carefully controlled study offer the strong hint that maybe Dr. Atkins was right all right

[02:42:38.620 --> 02:42:43.220]
People on a low carb high fat diet actually can eat more they can eat more

[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:47.620]
The study directed by Penelope green of the Harvard School of Public Health

[02:42:47.620 --> 02:42:51.400]
I love that name Penelope me to a really I rarely see it in print though

[02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:57.440]
It's a shock for a girl named Penelope Penelope green of Harvard School of Public Health and presented a meeting here this week of the American

[02:42:57.440 --> 02:42:59.320]
Association for the study of obesity

[02:43:00.140 --> 02:43:03.340]
Found that people eating an extra 300 calories today in a very low-carb

[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:08.820]
Regimen's it lost just as much during a 12-8 study as those on a standard low-fat diet

[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:10.980]
An extra 300 calories

[02:43:11.660 --> 02:43:13.020]
Which is what like a big Mac?

[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:18.280]
Over the course of the study to consume an extra 25,000 calories

[02:43:18.280 --> 02:43:22.520]
Which should have added up to about three kilograms or seven pounds, but for some reason it did not

[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:28.700]
There does indeed to be something about a low-carb diet that says you can eat more calories

[02:43:28.700 --> 02:43:32.780]
And lose a similar amount of weight green said that strikes it one of the most revered beliefs in nutrition

[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:37.100]
I've told you for a hundred years that American doctors know nothing about nutrition as soon as somebody tells you

[02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:41.420]
There are registered dietitian run for the hillsman run for the nearest deli and see if you can find West Clark

[02:43:42.840 --> 02:43:46.560]
One of the most revered beliefs in nutrition that a calorie is a calorie is a calorie

[02:43:46.560 --> 02:43:51.060]
Does matter whether they come from bacon or mashed potatoes? They all go in a waistline in just the same way

[02:43:51.060 --> 02:43:51.700]
Well, guess what?

[02:43:52.040 --> 02:44:00.760]
Not even green says this settles the case, but some of the meeting found her report fascinating a lot of our assumptions about a calorie is a calorie being

[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.800]
Challens as Marlene Schwartz of Yale

[02:44:03.660 --> 02:44:05.760]
As scientists we need to be open-minded

[02:44:06.480 --> 02:44:08.440]
Others though found the data hard to swallow

[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:15.080]
Is that a little like play on words? Yeah, it doesn't make sense does it's at Barbara rolls of Penn State rolls

[02:44:15.080 --> 02:44:18.060]
It violates the law of thermodynamics. No one's ever any as in jelly roll

[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:23.340]
It violates the law of thermodynamics. No one's ever found any miraculous metabolic effects in the study

[02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:29.640]
Ready now you hanging on I think it's 21 overweight volunteers were divided into three categories two groups also randomly

[02:44:29.640 --> 02:44:34.800]
Assigned either low-fatter low-carb diets with 15 in recalers for women 1800 from men third group was also low carb

[02:44:34.800 --> 02:44:41.860]
Got an extra 300 calories a day the study was unique because all the food was prepared an upscale Italian restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts

[02:44:41.860 --> 02:44:45.000]
So we church researchers knew exactly what they ate. Oh, I'd like that

[02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:48.460]
I'd like that they got the best deal in the cities when I'm here

[02:44:50.220 --> 02:44:54.160]
Most earlier studies simply sent people home with biopin's the follow as best they could each afternoon

[02:44:54.160 --> 02:45:00.440]
The volunteers picked up that evenings dinner a bedtime snack and the next day's breakfast and lunch instead a lots of red meat and saturated fat

[02:45:00.440 --> 02:45:06.220]
Which many find disturbing a lot low carb diets these people ate mostly fish chicken salads vegetables unsaturated oils

[02:45:06.220 --> 02:45:10.080]
This is not what people think about when they think of an act in zy green said nevertheless

[02:45:10.600 --> 02:45:13.060]
The act in zorganization agreed to pay for the research though

[02:45:13.060 --> 02:45:15.420]
It had no input in the studies design conduct or analization

[02:45:16.320 --> 02:45:18.880]
Everyone's food looked similar but was cooked in different recipes

[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:20.940]
Low-carb meals were 5% carbohydrate

[02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:23.880]
15% protein and 65% fat

[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:30.680]
Holy to moly chimney the rest got 55% carbs 15% protein and 30% fat now here comes the payoff

[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:34.820]
In the end everyone lost weight those on the lower cal low-carb

[02:45:34.820 --> 02:45:40.360]
Bridgman took off 23 pounds while people who got the same calories on the low-fat approach lost 17 pounds

[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:46.100]
The big surprise though was that the volunteers who got the extra 300 calories day of low-carb food lost 20 pounds

[02:45:46.100 --> 02:45:51.840]
Have you like that green said she can only guess whether people getting extra calories did so well

[02:45:51.840 --> 02:45:54.340]
Maybe they burned up more calories digesting their food

[02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.220]
I see there is something to be said about that sure about that business about burning up calories digesting the food more calories

[02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:06.880]
You're a hot takes more calories to digest fat. Yeah, all I'm little rodents all them jirbles and stuff are like racing around inside your body

[02:46:06.880 --> 02:46:09.600]
the digested all

[02:46:11.880 --> 02:46:18.980]
56705 60 pound five 60 on the A&T and T fat line or fat man. We're fat. We're all dying. We're choking on fat

[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:21.960]
187 by the way. It's a little bit that was 186

[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:25.220]
I'll go down and keep in a chart. Are you?

[02:46:26.500 --> 02:46:28.640]
I'm going on eckons right now. Well you're right

[02:46:30.100 --> 02:46:31.080]
186.7 on

[02:46:31.560 --> 02:46:37.220]
Okay, so 187 isn't exactly right. I mean you could pee that out in next to 10 minutes. I could do that. I'll be right back

[02:46:38.440 --> 02:46:42.120]
No, I just did take a big leak just before the break. Well go away yourself

[02:46:42.600 --> 02:46:46.700]
Should I go hop on the scale? No, because I've been drinking my diet so here all morning

[02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:51.180]
That's not fair. You do it first thing in the morning man after you get all you eliminate all that stuff

[02:46:51.180 --> 02:46:53.440]
You take a good to a healthy leave you take a good healthy

[02:46:53.440 --> 02:46:58.520]
And then you hop on a scale so oh man, I'm still taking a break of water. Don't take a deep breath. Right exactly

[02:46:58.520 --> 02:47:01.660]
That's right. Don't help too much oxygen. That's the whole kill you

[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:07.900]
56705 60 pound five 60 on the AT&T line. Here's hi Alia. Hello

[02:47:07.900 --> 02:47:12.900]
Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. How are you doing sir? I'm doing great. How's George doing?

[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:15.540]
George is doing for what he is

[02:47:18.260 --> 02:47:18.860]
Yes

[02:47:24.760 --> 02:47:28.040]
Okay, he's terrible man. He's pathetic

[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:34.300]
And I forgot the comment. We're going on with the world man. I got on source Nega

[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:37.660]
He's a California governor. I got drug

[02:47:37.660 --> 02:47:40.500]
Niche with a limbal. Drug limbal

[02:47:40.500 --> 02:47:45.200]
Drug limbal and you got a little prop. Look a little bit pro

[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:46.020]
Little pill pro

[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:51.120]
I see Rick thank you. Yeah, the talk show

[02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:54.100]
Yeah, uh, child six

[02:47:55.040 --> 02:47:59.640]
What is going on man? You're right. I think the last one was the that was like the last down on a coffin

[02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:02.300]
That told us we're going to hell on a handcash and the thing about drug

[02:48:03.060 --> 02:48:03.500]
Limbal

[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:09.540]
He admits that he's um doing that stuff, but he didn't he doesn't admit what he's doing wrong, you know, you know

[02:48:09.540 --> 02:48:14.180]
No, no, it's because he uh had the you know the problem with his back. That's the excuse

[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:19.600]
That's the lane excuse. Yeah, that's the main you know, he's playing golf. I'm gonna ask him man. Exactly. Well said man

[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:30.020]
Have a great day. All right. Thank you.

[02:48:33.500 --> 02:48:39.480]
That's what amuses me is the the sicker fans of it oh heads the rush liquors those are the people now now

[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:42.920]
They'll try to turn the tables and well, you know, we're gonna pick on this one

[02:48:42.920 --> 02:48:46.800]
Well, what's that got to do with him right? He's the one that's holier than the rest of us

[02:48:47.420 --> 02:48:51.160]
And that's the problem and we found the chigger in a wood pile. That's what Wilma said

[02:48:51.160 --> 02:48:56.920]
A lot of chiggers in that wood pile in Russia's house up there in Palm Beach in his 80 billion dollar house

[02:48:57.780 --> 02:49:00.380]
I got I just so compelled

[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:02.400]
I know I'm not gonna do it because it would be bad radio

[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:07.260]
I don't want to disappoint that guy to keep scarring us when we're gonna start doing good radio. I got to mark on the calendar 2006

[02:49:09.020 --> 02:49:11.920]
But uh here it is again. I just I just love it

[02:49:13.780 --> 02:49:19.900]
His housekeeper Wilma says the top show host pressured one man in the handing over pills prescribed for his wife after she'd had a miscarriage

[02:49:19.900 --> 02:49:22.760]
And scored painkillers from a stenographer with a broken leg

[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:29.820]
He was shameless if he knew anyone was suffering painting would try to persuade them to share their pills and probably didn't even turn over any

[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.340]
Cabbage too. I was at it. Huh?

[02:49:32.980 --> 02:49:35.260]
You like cabbage sloth rock

[02:49:38.140 --> 02:49:44.080]
Stuff cabbage man stuff cabbage stinks don't like stuff cabbage make it fart. Yeah

[02:49:45.160 --> 02:49:50.800]
Stinks like stuff cabbage. Oh, I don't like cooked cabbage. Oh man. Oh man. I bet your West Park has some great

[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:52.780]
Stuff cabbage the rascal has to

[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:02.960]
You're not as pedophile

[02:50:06.900 --> 02:50:11.980]
Don't come around yet tell me that sorry your excuses say just for me

[02:50:11.980 --> 02:50:14.520]
Cuz what did you do to me that night just for me?

[02:50:14.700 --> 02:50:15.260]
Yes

[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:19.940]
When you were feeling yes, see your ill-wendest

[02:50:19.940 --> 02:50:23.020]
Ask me. No, you didn't have to blast me

[02:50:23.740 --> 02:50:24.140]
Yes

[02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:33.980]
What

[02:50:53.020 --> 02:50:53.240]
substances

[02:51:00.180 --> 02:51:00.720]
Let's go!

[02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:03.100]
So who's got the cabbage?

[02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:06.580]
132 at 560 WQM. How many votes we got on this thing today?

[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:07.200]
Not too bad.

[02:51:09.680 --> 02:51:10.040]
559.

[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:13.700]
Not like yesterday when we just about broke all records with that rush poll.

[02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:15.220]
It's in everybody's Russian or the computer.

[02:51:15.500 --> 02:51:16.260]
Hey, let's do that again.

[02:51:18.100 --> 02:51:20.540]
Yeah, we should have left it out there for six months.

[02:51:21.020 --> 02:51:23.560]
We should have left out at least five weeks until he allegedly came back.

[02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:25.360]
Do you think he's going to be back in five weeks?

[02:51:25.500 --> 02:51:25.600]
No.

[02:51:25.880 --> 02:51:26.000]
No.

[02:51:28.500 --> 02:51:31.160]
What so-called comedian do you think is the least funny?

[02:51:31.300 --> 02:51:32.280]
Dennis Miller 106.

[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:33.080]
He's pulling away.

[02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:34.180]
106.

[02:51:34.420 --> 02:51:35.000]
Tom Arnold 76.

[02:51:36.220 --> 02:51:37.440]
See how many votes he's ahead already?

[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:38.440]
Bob Thirdman.

[02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:40.380]
Not even close, no more.

[02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.860]
Whoopi Goldberg 46, Carrotop 45.

[02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:44.260]
Rosie 42.

[02:51:44.780 --> 02:51:45.440]
Bob Sagitt.

[02:51:45.760 --> 02:51:46.240]
36.

[02:51:46.420 --> 02:51:47.060]
A real wimp.

[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:48.720]
Martin Lawrence 33.

[02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:49.820]
Wanda Sykes 20.

[02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:50.820]
Ben Stein 19.

[02:51:51.380 --> 02:51:52.360]
Seinfeld 15.

[02:51:52.780 --> 02:51:53.940]
But he's so Jewish.

Jerry Lewis 12, who's almost as Jewish.

[02:51:57.540 --> 02:51:59.400]
Robin Williams 11th Ray Romano 11th Ray Romano 10.

[02:51:59.700 --> 02:52:00.920]
Jay Leno has got nine.

[02:52:01.260 --> 02:52:02.680]
How a man delts only got nine.

[02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:04.540]
LND Generate 7.

[02:52:04.700 --> 02:52:05.320]
Chris Rock 7.

J. Moore 6.

[02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:07.300]
I have no idea.

[02:52:07.440 --> 02:52:08.080]
I know Chris Moore.

[02:52:08.160 --> 02:52:08.780]
He ain't funny either.

[02:52:10.700 --> 02:52:11.740]
Tim Allen 6.

[02:52:12.380 --> 02:52:12.700]
Jackie.

[02:52:12.960 --> 02:52:14.120]
And what is it with those shows?

[02:52:16.520 --> 02:52:21.140]
Those how home improvement and tool of this and tool of what is that?

[02:52:21.760 --> 02:52:22.280]
Citrus.

[02:52:22.780 --> 02:52:25.060]
Stupid ass concept man.

[02:52:25.220 --> 02:52:28.420]
Yeah, those stupid home improvement sitcoms.

[02:52:28.420 --> 02:52:28.940]
What is that?

[02:52:29.360 --> 02:52:29.640]
Citcom.

[02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:31.600]
You looked literally.

[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:32.220]
Yes, I did.

[02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:33.800]
Tim Allen 6.

[02:52:33.800 --> 02:52:34.760]
Jackie Mason 6.

[02:52:35.120 --> 02:52:35.740]
Jackie Mason got 6.

[02:52:35.900 --> 02:52:36.440]
Sinbad 6.

[02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:37.840]
Chris Tucker's got 6.

[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:39.120]
Bill Maher's got 5.

[02:52:39.600 --> 02:52:42.980]
That's because our audience probably likes Bill Maher, which I'll never forgive them for.

[02:52:43.400 --> 02:52:49.060]
Al Frankenfo, Peeley Hermanfo, Jackie DeJokeman, Martling Fo, Pooley Field 3, Colin Quinn 3.

[02:52:49.060 --> 02:52:50.120]
Jimmy Kimmel 2.

[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:51.200]
I do like saying that though.

[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:56.460]
In fact, even Fat Boy will come up there and tell you about those good roast beef sandwiches on Kimmelwick in Buffalo.

[02:52:57.260 --> 02:52:58.020]
Have you ever had that?

[02:52:58.260 --> 02:52:58.420]
No.

[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:00.380]
Seriously, you never heard of that?

[02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:01.140]
No.

[02:53:01.540 --> 02:53:02.720]
Don't you remember the day the guy called?

[02:53:02.900 --> 02:53:04.400]
I was talking about Niebu's roast beef.

[02:53:05.220 --> 02:53:05.440]
Yeah.

[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:08.460]
And a guy called from Buffalo who started that chain.

[02:53:08.660 --> 02:53:09.540]
Yeah, I put it out on my head.

[02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:11.580]
Oh, anyway, Kimmelwick.

[02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:13.800]
Uh, Norm McDonald's got one.

[02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:14.700]
A small one.

[02:53:14.880 --> 02:53:16.960]
John Larrichhead, Bill Cosby, David Letterman, and Waterpeace.

[02:53:16.960 --> 02:53:17.480]
And none.

[02:53:17.880 --> 02:53:20.680]
Oh, he actually put senior Wences on her shame on you.

[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:22.360]
I've already done that when you said don't do it.

[02:53:22.480 --> 02:53:23.880]
Oh, Jackie Green.

[02:53:24.160 --> 02:53:25.380]
Well, why do we put them on there?

[02:53:25.420 --> 02:53:26.340]
Nobody knows who that is.

[02:53:26.620 --> 02:53:27.600]
You said whatever they suggest.

[02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:28.600]
Oh, that's the Bill.

[02:53:28.780 --> 02:53:29.680]
Jackie Green, they're going to think.

[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:31.020]
Johnny Carson has none.

[02:53:31.260 --> 02:53:31.520]
Zero.

[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:33.560]
Jeanine Grafflo has gotten none.

[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:34.440]
Dudley Moore have none.

[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:36.180]
And Rich Lewis has none.

[02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:38.340]
And who we leave out in Gallagher, we got to put on it.

[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:41.220]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:41.520]
Hello.

[02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:42.180]
Hello.

[02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:43.180]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:53:43.180 --> 02:53:45.120]
I think you'll mention Rosanne.

[02:53:45.860 --> 02:53:46.700]
Rosanne Bar.

[02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:47.200]
Right.

[02:53:47.720 --> 02:53:48.360]
Now you have.

[02:53:49.020 --> 02:53:49.500]
Okay.

[02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:50.300]
Thank you.

[02:53:50.600 --> 02:53:51.360]
And have a nice day.

[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:52.740]
Chronic, but she's nice, right?

[02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:54.160]
Chronic.

[02:53:54.240 --> 02:53:54.420]
Hello.

[02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:55.680]
Rosanne Bar.

[02:53:55.820 --> 02:53:57.080]
Get Rosanne Bar on there, please.

[02:53:57.540 --> 02:54:01.020]
Oh, by the way, speaking of something that we can't stand, since that's very big in South

[02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:03.980]
Florida, illusion is David Blaine.

[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.100]
One of your very favorites.

[02:54:07.280 --> 02:54:07.440]
Yeah.

[02:54:08.300 --> 02:54:09.080]
Tell CNN.

[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:11.780]
He is unlikely to do anything like this again.

[02:54:12.160 --> 02:54:16.040]
He's been suspended in a glass box in London since September 5th.

[02:54:16.100 --> 02:54:20.300]
The American illusionist spoke to CNN's Robin Kurnaum on Dave Hire audio link from his box

[02:54:20.840 --> 02:54:22.600]
on the banks of the River Thames.

[02:54:23.060 --> 02:54:24.440]
Brad Pitt stopped by and took one.

[02:54:24.500 --> 02:54:26.160]
Look and said, what's in the box?

[02:54:27.500 --> 02:54:29.700]
This whole thing has been so much more difficult than anything else.

[02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:30.140]
I've ever done.

[02:54:30.300 --> 02:54:31.740]
I don't think I can ever do anything like this again.

[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:32.720]
Does anybody care?

[02:54:32.820 --> 02:54:34.340]
Does anybody want to ever see him again?

[02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:34.740]
Oh, no.

[02:54:35.460 --> 02:54:35.720]
I like that.

[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:40.580]
Wayne has had hamburgers, bacon sandwiches, eggs, golf balls, even paint bombs thrown at him.

[02:54:40.580 --> 02:54:44.800]
A man was arrested on September 16th for trying to sabotage his water supply.

[02:54:45.100 --> 02:54:46.340]
Oh, what a shame they got him.

[02:54:46.540 --> 02:54:47.340]
Damn it.

[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:49.640]
Others have tried to keep him awake by beating drums nearby.

[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:53.780]
Barbecue has been lit to torment him and some have veered breasts and baux docks at him.

[02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:54.200]
Bracken!

[02:54:54.300 --> 02:54:56.580]
Although silly brits, man, showed him their...

[02:54:57.700 --> 02:54:58.040]
Tips.

[02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:00.460]
Chris says.

[02:55:01.020 --> 02:55:03.460]
The least funny comedian in the world is Eddie Isard.

[02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:06.300]
Is he?

[02:55:06.680 --> 02:55:07.440]
Never heard of him.

[02:55:07.440 --> 02:55:10.560]
He's a British transvestite, dresses in drag on stage.

[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:11.900]
You can't understand a word he says.

[02:55:12.020 --> 02:55:13.300]
In short, he's a piece of crap.

[02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:16.460]
A sample joke when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon.

[02:55:16.460 --> 02:55:19.360]
He should have said, oh, it's all sticky, it's covered in jam.

[02:55:21.260 --> 02:55:21.800]
Ho, ho.

[02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:27.920]
Despite this, he's considered by 20-somethings to be a god, not in Britain, here in the US of A.

[02:55:28.220 --> 02:55:29.140]
I wait for the future.

[02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:30.320]
Mo, how are we David and his funny?

[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:31.160]
Oh, that's us at all.

[02:55:31.200 --> 02:55:31.700]
That's a loop.

[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:32.020]
Wow.

[02:55:32.380 --> 02:55:34.480]
If Mo, how are David and his funny are then heavy, his...

[02:55:34.480 --> 02:55:35.260]
You never heard of him?

[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:35.660]
No.

[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:36.340]
I have.

[02:55:36.980 --> 02:55:37.340]
And?

[02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:39.120]
He's not funny.

[02:55:39.560 --> 02:55:42.880]
You know what else it might have been the Dave Matthews band?

[02:55:44.520 --> 02:55:45.260]
Yeah, for millions?

[02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:46.060]
What about them?

[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:47.520]
No, I'm not talking about comedians.

[02:55:47.540 --> 02:55:48.940]
I'm just talking about the 20-somethings.

[02:55:48.960 --> 02:55:50.500]
It's like it's a state of mind again.

[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:50.760]
Sure.

[02:55:51.020 --> 02:55:51.300]
Hate them.

[02:55:51.760 --> 02:55:52.080]
Right.

[02:55:52.680 --> 02:55:54.660]
Oh, but that makes you unhypnotable.

[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:54.780]

[02:55:54.780 --> 02:55:56.940]
Because we say, yeah, we're old and undebted.

[02:55:57.040 --> 02:55:58.560]
We're very proud of it, by the way.

[02:55:58.820 --> 02:55:59.860]
No, it has nothing to do with that.

[02:56:00.060 --> 02:56:00.580]
They just suck.

[02:56:01.160 --> 02:56:01.520]
Right.

[02:56:01.880 --> 02:56:04.620]
But the Dave Matthews band is like the in a state of mind.

[02:56:04.620 --> 02:56:06.260]
It's like the Rascal House and the Forge.

[02:56:06.520 --> 02:56:07.820]
And Joe Stone grabs all these things.

[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:10.160]
West Clark, I bet you'll be at the Joe's pretty soon.

[02:56:10.900 --> 02:56:11.160]
You think?

[02:56:11.680 --> 02:56:12.720]
I guess once a week, he can.

[02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:14.040]
No, but Joe's isn't Jewish, see.

[02:56:14.860 --> 02:56:16.200]
Won't be another good place for him to eat.

[02:56:17.760 --> 02:56:18.940]
Um, Fossberg's Delian Hollywood.

[02:56:20.000 --> 02:56:20.740]
Never heard of it.

[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:21.520]
Oh, they're great.

[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:23.620]
He could eat at Wolfies.

[02:56:24.780 --> 02:56:28.100]
If it was still there, the Rascal has the closest thing we got left to Wolfies

[02:56:28.100 --> 02:56:29.100]
because Wolfie Cohen originated.

[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:30.820]
Wolfie Cohen is still dead, by the way.

[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:35.220]
Yeah, what a sad, sad situation this way.

[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:36.720]
And he could eat a pumper next to the old.

[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:40.360]
The kids hadn't put it out of business by stealing the silverware and a sweet and low.

[02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:43.720]
And the carpet and everything else that wasn't tacked down.

[02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:46.480]
Here's a call from Pampino.

[02:56:46.540 --> 02:56:46.900]
Hello.

[02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:48.760]
Hello.

[02:56:49.200 --> 02:56:49.720]
Yes, sir.

[02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:51.000]
How you doing?

[02:56:51.420 --> 02:56:51.840]
Pretty good.

[02:56:51.940 --> 02:56:52.320]
How you doing?

[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:53.220]
Hey, good.

[02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:56.020]
Listen, I'm going to, I want to try out on next week.

[02:56:56.100 --> 02:56:57.080]
Can you tell me where to go?

[02:56:57.240 --> 02:56:58.600]
Like the best place to go to?

[02:56:59.140 --> 02:56:59.740]
Where to go?

[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:01.920]
To do what?

[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:04.320]
I'm going to go to the kitchen.

[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:05.340]
I already booked a flight.

[02:57:05.660 --> 02:57:05.860]
I already booked a flight.

[02:57:05.860 --> 02:57:05.920]
I already booked a flight.

[02:57:05.920 --> 02:57:07.580]
So I don't know if I've ever been to book flight yet.

[02:57:07.940 --> 02:57:08.120]
Yeah.

[02:57:09.640 --> 02:57:10.780]
Go to Ottawa, man.

[02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:13.140]
That's the capital of Ontario, like a real well there.

[02:57:13.800 --> 02:57:15.160]
Go see Froggy, Jean-Crichin.

[02:57:15.620 --> 02:57:17.500]
We got a real good taco bell here.

[02:57:18.040 --> 02:57:19.920]
I'll see you at the Eden Center, okay, Schmuck?

[02:57:20.920 --> 02:57:23.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:57:23.740 --> 02:57:24.840]
Oh, I'm going to Vegas continue.

[02:57:25.080 --> 02:57:27.420]
Tell me a good gas station to gas up my red car.

[02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:29.160]
What's a good gas station?

[02:57:30.320 --> 02:57:30.640]
Connico.

[02:57:31.300 --> 02:57:32.460]
Oh, no, not for me.

[02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:33.880]
Don't put that cheap gas.

[02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:35.700]
Well, maybe a renicar, not in my corvettes.

[02:57:36.740 --> 02:57:39.820]
Gas stations that you wouldn't, that's a good pull for you someday.

[02:57:40.960 --> 02:57:43.620]
Most seriously, like as much as I love Godfather's,

[02:57:43.700 --> 02:57:45.100]
I would never get the Hess gas.

[02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:46.480]
No, either.

[02:57:46.660 --> 02:57:50.640]
Because I think, you know, it makes me think of Rudolph Hess, you know.

[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:52.820]
Which I realize I'm not saying that they have anything to do with that,

[02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:53.340]
which they don't.

[02:57:53.420 --> 02:57:53.580]
They do.

[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:54.620]
This makes me think of that.

[02:57:54.620 --> 02:57:56.080]
You know, plus it's cheap gas.

[02:57:57.740 --> 02:57:59.520]
Connico, which isn't used to be tentico.

[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:02.360]
Okay, depending on a part of the country that you're in,

[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:03.740]
it's like, you know, different names.

[02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:04.140]
Right.

[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:05.640]
Sonoco.

[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:07.620]
No, no, Sonoco is good.

[02:58:08.140 --> 02:58:08.740]
I mean, we had that.

[02:58:08.760 --> 02:58:09.700]
I'm just naming up skier.

[02:58:09.700 --> 02:58:11.080]
I don't think Sonoco is around anymore.

[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:11.360]
Is it?

[02:58:11.360 --> 02:58:12.320]
I haven't seen it in a long time.

[02:58:12.320 --> 02:58:13.240]
Big up, all right.

[02:58:13.840 --> 02:58:15.220]
Yes, Sonoco is over the place.

[02:58:15.340 --> 02:58:17.440]
See what you got to like about Sonoco is they have the different grades.

[02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:21.920]
Not just you're three different, you know, like premium or regular or whatever.

[02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:25.840]
But they have like 85 different grades and you like punch the thing up on you.

[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:27.400]
And you think you're getting like really good stuff.

[02:58:27.400 --> 02:58:28.340]
It's coming out of the tap.

[02:58:29.640 --> 02:58:30.440]
But, huh?

[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:32.580]
Yeah, probably it's like half and half.

[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:35.300]
50, 50 percent gas and 50 percent water.

[02:58:35.520 --> 02:58:36.120]
How about sinclair?

[02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:37.400]
Sinclair.

[02:58:37.540 --> 02:58:38.320]
Is that the one with the dinosaur?

[02:58:38.620 --> 02:58:39.040]
Yes, it is.

[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:40.680]
Yeah, I never got those sinclair.

[02:58:40.980 --> 02:58:41.100]
Neither.

[02:58:41.260 --> 02:58:42.440]
But you know what I'm talking about?

[02:58:42.680 --> 02:58:47.920]
The low rent district, the real cheap, usually in marginal neighborhood kind of gas station.

[02:58:48.660 --> 02:58:50.480]
If you're driving a car,

[02:58:51.180 --> 02:58:52.960]
Sico, would you put Sico Masaheers?

[02:58:53.460 --> 02:58:54.840]
No way, Jose, man.

[02:58:55.920 --> 02:58:57.900]
In fact, if you ever heard Brian Murray say it.

[02:58:58.140 --> 02:58:59.480]
I beg of you, local.

[02:58:59.720 --> 02:59:01.040]
This is my city.

[02:59:01.260 --> 02:59:01.820]
I beg of you.

[02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:02.320]
I beg of you, though.

[02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:03.320]
You're the only one.

[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:05.060]
You ain't.

[02:59:06.780 --> 02:59:08.380]
Can you hear me?

[02:59:10.000 --> 02:59:12.860]
I have the fiddle for you.

[02:59:13.860 --> 02:59:16.140]
Can't you think you're hearing?

[02:59:17.420 --> 02:59:20.980]
I know you should afford to.

[02:59:21.360 --> 02:59:22.900]
Hello, Urashi.

[02:59:24.340 --> 02:59:24.920]
Urashi.

[02:59:26.280 --> 02:59:26.920]
Urashi.

[02:59:28.280 --> 02:59:28.820]
Urashi.

[02:59:30.220 --> 02:59:31.280]
What for?

[02:59:34.220 --> 02:59:35.020]
What?

[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:36.440]
What?

[02:59:36.820 --> 02:59:38.540]
What a tough job.

[02:59:38.540 --> 02:59:39.440]
What for?

[02:59:43.140 --> 02:59:47.460]
When we run that,

[02:59:47.820 --> 02:59:51.940]
do not do what we want.

[02:59:54.220 --> 02:59:57.000]
What will you do?

[02:59:57.720 --> 02:59:59.700]
We're going to do it.

[03:00:00.580 --> 03:00:02.400]
You're bad for you.

[03:00:02.940 --> 03:00:04.600]
You hateful treats.

[03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:07.780]
Let's adopt you.

[03:00:08.460 --> 03:00:10.600]
Overpay this candy.

[03:00:11.380 --> 03:00:12.780]
I might sound good,

[03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:15.820]
but I'm not sorry.

[03:00:18.940 --> 03:00:19.480]
What for?

[03:00:20.040 --> 03:00:20.600]
What for?

[03:00:22.860 --> 03:00:23.620]
What for?

[03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:23.840]

[03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:26.260]
What for?

[03:00:26.540 --> 03:00:27.240]
What for?

[03:00:27.780 --> 03:00:27.860]
What for?

[03:00:28.060 --> 03:00:28.200]
What for?

[03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:28.740]

[03:00:28.960 --> 03:00:30.200]
What for?

[03:00:30.200 --> 03:00:30.940]
What for?

[03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:32.520]
What for?

[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:35.400]
What for?

[03:00:35.400 --> 03:00:35.780]
I'm going to have fun!

[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:38.420]
I'm going to have fun!

[03:00:42.440 --> 03:00:42.940]
You're going to have fun!

[03:00:43.440 --> 03:00:44.840]
I'm not going to have fun!

[03:00:45.960 --> 03:00:47.460]
I'm not going to have fun!

[03:00:51.060 --> 03:00:52.000]
I'm going to have fun!

[03:00:53.060 --> 03:00:53.160]
Yeah!

[03:00:57.220 --> 03:00:57.720]
146.

[03:00:57.860 --> 03:00:59.000]
Now that we're pounding on, are we?

[03:00:59.020 --> 03:00:59.400]
Good.

[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:02.020]
You're not going to like this story.

[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:07.940]
Alright, some US troops in Iraq will have to wait until December. This is from the Guardian, the British paper.

[03:01:08.560 --> 03:01:14.160]
We'll have to wait till December to get the military's best body armor, which is strong enough to stop bullets fired from assault rifles.

[03:01:15.320 --> 03:01:23.120]
Nearly a quarter of the 130,000 American troops in Iraq still have not been issued the newest body armor, which has ceramic plates to stop rifle rounds.

[03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:27.820]
The laser and funding production and shipping mean that the last of the 30,000, how many?

[03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:34.440]
30,000 sets of body armor won't be delivered in Iraq to Iraq until December more than eight months after the war began.

[03:01:35.260 --> 03:01:42.360]
Congress approved $310 million and able to buy $300,000 more than the bulletproof vest, including $30,000 for troops in Iraq.

[03:01:43.300 --> 03:01:51.740]
But only about $75 million has reached the Army office overseeing the vest manufacturer and distribution, said David Nelson, an official men office.

[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:53.420]
Used to be on Aussie and Hurried, didn't he?

[03:01:54.020 --> 03:02:09.800]
Sure. Angry members of Congress have announced the Pentagon saying as many as 44,000 troops like the best vests because of a sluggish supply chain, relatives of, wait till you hear this, relatives of some soldiers have resorted to buying body armor in the United States and shipping it to their troops congressional critics say.

[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:11.940]
Along with toilet paper, toothpaste, everything on the road.

[03:02:12.020 --> 03:02:20.680]
Representative Ted Strickland, Democratic Ohio said I got a letter from the young soldier in Baghdad saying that the men in his group were concerned that they had cheap armor that was incapable of stopping bullets.

[03:02:21.220 --> 03:02:24.480]
And they wondered why they couldn't have the best protection possible under the circumstances.

[03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:36.840]
The House version of an $86.7 million Iraq spending bill passed last week includes $251 million for body armor and for clearing unexploded munitions, although it's unclear whether additional money would speed the process at this point.

[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:42.400]
President Bush's original request included no more money for body armor.

[03:02:43.500 --> 03:02:45.000]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:47.700]
I missed that. I missed that. I missed that. I missed that date reading.

[03:02:48.220 --> 03:02:48.620]
Say it again.

[03:02:49.640 --> 03:02:52.700]
President Bush's original request, well, let me read the whole paragraph.

[03:02:52.920 --> 03:03:03.880]
The House version of that $86.7 million Iraq spending bill passed last week includes $251 million for body armor and for clearing unexploded munitions, although it's unclear whether additional money would speed the process at this point.

[03:03:03.880 --> 03:03:08.320]
President Bush's original request included no more money for body armor.

[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:09.360]
Oh my God.

[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:11.660]
I just, like I said, mentioned that in passing.

[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:16.600]
Hey, and interestingly enough, President Bush's approval rating is back up.

[03:03:17.180 --> 03:03:24.820]
Have been declining in recent weeks, but it's moved back up primarily due big gains among men and among high income Americans according to, I can't imagine why.

[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:25.700]
Can you? No.

[03:03:26.420 --> 03:03:34.220]
A majority of registered voters say Bush deserves to be reelected, but only 38% say they will definitely vote for Bush according to that pool with exactly the same number.

[03:03:34.340 --> 03:03:37.900]
Say they would vote against them. The battle for swing voters in the middle seems more important than ever.

[03:03:38.200 --> 03:03:47.120]
How are Dean God in recent weeks, Bush's approval rating had split as Democrats, especially how are Dean is the Arnold Schwarzenegger of the West with a brain?

[03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:49.600]
See what I'm saying? Okay.

[03:03:50.060 --> 03:03:58.960]
He's the anti establishment. He's the alternative. He's the choice. He's going to pop them all. He's going to pump up America and send the Bushes back to a Webinar.

[03:03:58.960 --> 03:03:59.880]
Come from Texas.

[03:04:01.720 --> 03:04:05.700]
Bush's approval rating had split in recent weeks, especially among those seeking the party.

[03:04:07.080 --> 03:04:13.240]
But administration figures are taking part in aggressive public relations, ever explaining and lying through their teeth about the Iraq policy.

[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:17.900]
They're dusting off kind of leaves and all these other goyms and shipping them out there and praying them around.

[03:04:18.420 --> 03:04:24.300]
And Bush is speaking out more in the economy now that market, of course, this tremendous comeback that we've got now, right?

[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:30.440]
And the people on the gambling channel are there pumping it up the Dow is up 13.71, the Nasdaq's up 3.12.

[03:04:30.440 --> 03:04:34.480]
But I actually like the new look on there, even though there are a bunch of thieves in the obelang and jail.

[03:04:34.720 --> 03:04:37.480]
You know something? I don't like the new look. Why not? Smaller.

[03:04:37.780 --> 03:04:43.360]
No, but I don't like the the crawl on the bottom. I don't I just don't like the whole setup.

[03:04:43.640 --> 03:04:49.540]
I do. I don't. I don't know. It's more compact, but you don't want to come back. You want to be big. You want to jump in on it.

[03:04:49.640 --> 03:04:53.860]
What do you want to see? Marab Barca Romero would have been bagged in her eyes. Like I said, make that ugly bitch.

[03:04:54.840 --> 03:05:00.020]
Every time she's on a screen that her put up the whole crawl should cover her puts and her face.

[03:05:01.880 --> 03:05:09.040]
Disgusting baggy bitch. Man, is she just grotesque? I'm Maria Bacteromo. See, she's kind of like Tony Dorset.

[03:05:09.260 --> 03:05:14.800]
We used to be Tony Dorset. And who's somebody other one's got? Some of these athletes that change away the pronounce their name.

[03:05:15.160 --> 03:05:20.120]
Yeah. But anyway, she's used to be Maria Bacteromo. Oh, not Maria Bacteromo.

[03:05:21.200 --> 03:05:26.180]
Have you ever noticed that? No. Butter Roman during the X. Yeah, no, I'll bring a back to Rome.

[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:29.000]
You better say it right, mister. You're going to go to goddamn hell.

[03:05:30.480 --> 03:05:34.840]
Kill Bill, bloody up the box office. I meant to mention this yesterday because it's violent and grotesque.

[03:05:34.980 --> 03:05:39.840]
And maybe the most violent movie of all time. And I'll probably see it this weekend. There you go. And we like it. We like a lot of violence.

[03:05:40.040 --> 03:05:43.320]
I don't want to see train spotting though, because I don't want to do my duty.

[03:05:44.280 --> 03:05:50.060]
It was payback time for Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman at the box office. I wonder if she's kind to Uma, Ima Sumak.

[03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:57.600]
Uma, Uma. At the box office Papa Uma Mao, is your daddy? At the box office is the Vengeance Saga Kill Bill volume one.

[03:05:57.800 --> 03:06:04.140]
Open volume one. Is there going to be any ideas? Open then first place with 22.7 million bucks.

[03:06:05.800 --> 03:06:10.340]
The previous weekend's number one flick, the School of Rocks, flipped the second place with 15.4.

[03:06:10.760 --> 03:06:17.300]
The Cohen Brothers, romantic comedy, intolerable cruelty starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones, was debuted at number three.

[03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:24.540]
Good boy, a family flick featuring the voice of Matthew Browderick as a talking dog from outer space, premiered in fourth place with 13 million.

[03:06:24.960 --> 03:06:30.240]
And the weekend's other new wide release, The Horror Tale, The House of the Dead, opened at number six with five and a half million.

[03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:39.700]
In limited release, Clint Eastwood's Mystic River had an exceptional debut, taking in almost 600 grand and 13 theaters for whopping average of 46 grand.

[03:06:40.100 --> 03:06:45.320]
The dark murdered drama starring Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon, Expansed to More theaters this week. Well that sounds like it might be good.

[03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:51.360]
Mystic River? It especially if you still live in Boston like I did, and you used to drive over that Mystic River bridge.

[03:06:52.640 --> 03:06:59.360]
You ever been on a Mystic River bridge? No. Ever been in Saga's? No. Ever been in Rockingham Park? No. What the hell do you know?

[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:05.640]
I'm a legend in the world. We're a spiritual feisty. You AM.

[03:07:07.800 --> 03:07:08.520]
Oh!

[03:07:08.780 --> 03:07:13.600]
They're all right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:18.780]
Saying the Monies, Monies who enter in their old mothers.

[03:07:19.900 --> 03:07:25.360]
I bet you're gonna save that when it guns at your back as they pick up or that train.

[03:07:26.360 --> 03:07:29.760]
Right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:07:30.840 --> 03:07:36.260]
Well, adjusting enough, just have fun, feeling the airways with hatred.

[03:07:36.780 --> 03:07:41.520]
The radio was permeated with the lights of Dr. Laura Bill, Henry and Michael Reagan.

[03:07:42.160 --> 03:07:46.820]
They call it Clear Channel, cause they're clearly out to make the message clear.

[03:07:47.620 --> 03:07:51.060]
The right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:07:52.360 --> 03:07:57.120]
They're all right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:07:57.660 --> 03:08:01.960]
For all the table-dog can idiot to boot and get any dumber.

[03:08:03.540 --> 03:08:08.460]
Ladder, married to whatever they are told to believe and worshiped Georgia's their king.

[03:08:09.580 --> 03:08:12.780]
Right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:08:14.140 --> 03:08:19.440]
Well, the Democrats who crap their pants like a child that is scary movie.

[03:08:19.440 --> 03:08:24.660]
Have Terry Muff color who should go home and shut up, but he don't have a clue what he's doing.

[03:08:25.280 --> 03:08:30.040]
The Democrats have a death wish when it comes to deciding who they will run.

[03:08:30.760 --> 03:08:32.760]
And you can color them done.

[03:08:33.340 --> 03:08:35.080]
If they won, you'll leave her, man.

[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:36.000]
Oi!

[03:08:36.580 --> 03:08:39.780]
Right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:08:41.020 --> 03:08:45.140]
They're all right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:08:46.260 --> 03:08:46.780]
Ouh!

[03:08:47.180 --> 03:08:50.540]
Inundated, but as if them are getting a juicy humler.

[03:08:51.940 --> 03:08:57.140]
Just remember what I said when it comes to your back as they made the abort that train.

[03:08:58.180 --> 03:09:01.220]
Right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:09:02.640 --> 03:09:06.760]
They're all right when Nazi Republican mother f**kers.

[03:09:08.260 --> 03:09:10.080]
For all the table-dog can idiot to boot.

[03:09:10.080 --> 03:09:11.960]
I bet you ain't think for all this back tomorrow, Scott.

[03:09:12.180 --> 03:09:14.340]
I bet you're any of them, I bet you Georgia's life on it.

[03:09:14.340 --> 03:09:15.580]
I bet you're all right when you're back tomorrow.

[03:09:16.320 --> 03:09:18.000]
I just have a feeling he'll be, you know.

[03:09:18.460 --> 03:09:21.700]
And then of course Thursday is going to be that gigantic day when the book comes out.

[03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:22.140]
Wow!

[03:09:22.460 --> 03:09:24.000]
That is going to be a pressure pact.

[03:09:25.080 --> 03:09:27.480]
Either time is flying or I'm getting really older both.

[03:09:28.180 --> 03:09:28.960]
Thought flew by today.

[03:09:29.660 --> 03:09:30.780]
I'm not talking about today.

[03:09:30.880 --> 03:09:33.700]
I'm talking about it seems like every other minute we're talking.

[03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:35.260]
Oh we got another train coming out.

[03:09:35.380 --> 03:09:37.200]
We got another book coming out of these damn ratings, man.

[03:09:37.220 --> 03:09:37.900]
Another book already?

[03:09:38.140 --> 03:09:40.840]
Why don't they just say, yeah, okay you guys are great.

[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:42.140]
You've got number one for every year.

[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:42.600]
That's it.

[03:09:43.100 --> 03:09:46.140]
Everybody who did well just stick it in everybody did poorly.

[03:09:46.300 --> 03:09:46.740]
Absolutely.

[03:09:46.960 --> 03:09:48.860]
You know they suck, you know, and that's it.

[03:09:49.800 --> 03:09:52.840]
And what the hell is this thing you just sent me about the illiterate cave dwellers?

[03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:53.800]
We'll have to save that for tomorrow.

[03:09:54.220 --> 03:09:54.480]
Okay.

[03:09:55.320 --> 03:09:57.340]
In Pikeville, Kentucky that's with a P.

[03:09:57.740 --> 03:09:57.860]
Yeah.

[03:09:58.120 --> 03:10:02.060]
Great selections for our poll just before they are closing time you're out of the gun.

[03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:03.960]
Louis Anderson sucks.

[03:10:03.960 --> 03:10:05.460]
Man you are absolutely.

[03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:06.920]
Absolutely correct.

[03:10:07.180 --> 03:10:10.020]
Whoever you are man, Louis Anderson bites the big one.

[03:10:10.040 --> 03:10:10.680]
Just blows.

[03:10:12.220 --> 03:10:15.160]
And Tucker, not Carlson with a bow tie.

[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:18.980]
Tucker our factur says a late entry for your poll is Craig Kilborn.

[03:10:18.980 --> 03:10:22.060]
He is without a doubt the most unfunny late night funny man.

[03:10:22.200 --> 03:10:23.480]
I dearly try and watch him.

[03:10:23.560 --> 03:10:24.440]
I'll thank you word for it Tucker.

[03:10:24.640 --> 03:10:24.800]
Okay.

[03:10:25.740 --> 03:10:26.960]
Craig Kilborn got it.

[03:10:27.120 --> 03:10:27.680]
Got it.

[03:10:27.700 --> 03:10:32.040]
Now the good news for me is that for some strange reason my homepage here got all

[03:10:32.040 --> 03:10:32.600]
dicked around.

[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:33.600]
Your homo page?

[03:10:33.780 --> 03:10:38.920]
My homo page and so I was able to vote twice more for Dennis Miller.

[03:10:39.220 --> 03:10:39.500]
Excellent.

[03:10:39.500 --> 03:10:40.680]
I mean, I know it's good.

[03:10:40.780 --> 03:10:41.900]
He's only 24 ahead.

[03:10:42.100 --> 03:10:43.000]
He was up by.

[03:10:43.060 --> 03:10:43.960]
About 30 man.

[03:10:44.040 --> 03:10:46.440]
I just want to make sure we keep him right up there on top where he belongs.

[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:51.740]
A bullish major asshole about as funny as a severe arthritis of the kneecap.

[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:54.580]
Just a real piece of turd Dennis Miller speaking of the home page.

[03:10:54.600 --> 03:10:54.860]
New picture.

[03:10:55.140 --> 03:10:55.140]

[03:10:55.420 --> 03:10:55.760]
New picture.

[03:10:56.640 --> 03:10:57.760]
Are we getting a new picture on there?

[03:10:58.020 --> 03:10:59.080]
I better click on it right now.

[03:10:59.240 --> 03:10:59.760]
One moment please.

[03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:02.420]
Anybody hasn't seen our new rush picture on there?

[03:11:02.540 --> 03:11:03.380]
You'll love that.

[03:11:03.520 --> 03:11:05.580]
In fact, you can probably order some of that stuff right on there.

[03:11:06.240 --> 03:11:07.720]
Do we have a full free number to order?

[03:11:09.300 --> 03:11:09.740]
Yeah.

[03:11:09.880 --> 03:11:10.320]
And...

[03:11:10.320 --> 03:11:13.280]
Oh no.

[03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:17.840]
Sink free then grey at the Marij is our good buddy.

[03:11:18.140 --> 03:11:18.360]
Raw.

[03:11:18.620 --> 03:11:19.420]
He's a little underweather.

[03:11:19.520 --> 03:11:20.200]
Well, great Davis.

[03:11:20.340 --> 03:11:21.960]
You got to find something to do for crying out loud.

[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:26.460]
Mad Dog is next to Humberett for Marlins and the Cubs must win desperate seven o'clock tonight.

[03:11:26.500 --> 03:11:27.120]
Bye bye.

[03:11:27.680 --> 03:11:29.060]
Thank you for your show.

[03:11:29.260 --> 03:11:30.900]
I'm rising to the QAN.

[03:11:31.100 --> 03:11:31.960]
My name is for learning.

[03:11:32.320 --> 03:11:34.760]
The black's dealing with the sun and all this kind of stuff.
