[00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.280]
Hey, Neil, the hockey news came out with a cover.

[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.400]
I know you do as bitch.

[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040]
Listen, eight guys in the NHL.

[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.040]
The dog hit her right, man.

[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.020]
He sports shows with these 85 minute breaks.

[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.060]
You're out of your mind.

[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.540]
Are you kidding money maker?

[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.920]
You run 45 million, come out.

[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.460]
You do commercials for dead people.

[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.420]
We have 18 minutes an hour on your phone.

[00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:23.940]
Oh, that's one of the good audience.

[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.800]
Oh, all spots radio.

[00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.440]
See, we thought it was all sports radio.

[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.180]
They left the RR.

[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.820]
It's all sports radio and sports show is man dogs right.

[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:31.380]
You're right.

[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.520]
I spent the day yesterday.

[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.780]
I spent the day with the man.

[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.120]
I guess they had the touchdown club with all those money makers.

[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.540]
That was interesting.

[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.380]
And also again about how you spent the day with the man dog

[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:40.140]
at the touchdown club.

[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.780]
I want to hear about that.

[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.960]
Eight guys in the NHL that need to be great this year.

[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.100]
You know what they put on the cover?

[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.020]
Is Eric Lindross.

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.880]
His career's over.

[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.340]
The Leafs won five-three last night in Hellstinky.

[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.560]
I didn't like it against Yokeert.

[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.600]
Whatever it is, Yokeert.

[00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.420]
Here's the players they think they need to stand by.

[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.680]
They're a little finished girls team.

[00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.640]
Byron, the fro.

[00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.680]
They're finished.

[00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.020]
Yarmere Yager.

[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.480]
This idiotic article you sent me from Monday by the way.

[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.400]
It's all news about the people washing their hands.

[00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.000]
You wash your hands after you're killed.

[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.880]
I wash my hands whenever I feel like it.

[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.120]
Okay, depending on what I had them on.

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.460]
But anyway, it says here Reuters Toronto International Airport.

[00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.640]
Even you know it's Pearson International Airport.

[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.620]
What a bunch of morons at the Reuters.

[00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.900]
They probably work at the Sunsettle.

[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.080]
Do you know that the Sunsettle still hasn't discovered

[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.140]
that Don Cox died on Monday morning?

[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.560]
Yeah, they haven't discovered it.

[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.280]
Do you think that big NHL going straight next year?

[00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.740]
They still think that...

[00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.660]
What do you mean do I think they're going to do?

[00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.080]
They're going on strike.

[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.660]
They're going to have a lockout and maybe for two years they're saying now.

[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.920]
Wow, so it will be a 2005 NHL.

[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.580]
2005 NHL.

[00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.700]
2004 NHL 2005.

[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.420]
Possibly.

[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.920]
No way.

[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.260]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.600]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.840]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.440]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.140]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.540]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.580]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.420]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.900]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.840]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.480]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.180]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.660]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.520]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.520]

[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.740]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:51.280]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.000]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.240]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.280]
They ain't nobody say.

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.280]

[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.900]
I swear thisortou can't.

[00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.740]
I think they play out, so see you's laughing.

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.040]

[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.360]
balance blue's one nothing.

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.260]
It's no different for losing 14 of them.

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.100]
My hand, why would you know?

[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.360]
My hand, why would you know?

[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.160]
You won't sleep well.

[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.020]
There's still only one game in the, uh, in the extended so it's just a big flop.

[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.320]
They had 12 games left.

[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.520]
Do you think they'll make the playoffs or not?

[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.820]
Yes.

[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:26.100]
And when they do should I have a party, a cave egg on it and team up?

[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.160]
Sure.

[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240]
All right.

[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.220]
I dropped in on the floor, I was turning blue.

[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.620]
I died right after you.

[00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.340]
I was every thought that I would die at the same time that Johnny's met her with you.

[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.260]
Shuffee ambulance door.

[00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.720]
Shuffee ambulance door.

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440]
There's nothing else you can do.

[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.700]
Johnny and I are three who will take your back on the leader and pass away with the boy name soon.

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.440]
I think I may have caught something when I think to say summer's that day.

[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.500]
I always thought you were a fool.

[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.920]
Well, let me show like you're blue.

[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.180]
Oh, it was daily time and from the alcohol and in the cocaine.

[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.180]
I was a star of the two.

[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.360]
And that were broken into two.

[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.980]
10.07 at 5.60 WQ and that was in very poor taste when you agreed.

[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.040]
I enjoyed it though.

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.960]
I tried a lot immensely.

[00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.540]
So anyway, we got the short show today because we're not a ballgame arena.

[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.220]
But we got our big Wednesday one to two hour.

[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.780]
And now that we got abbreviated a condensed first segment here because for all I can't how it's time it is.

[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.380]
Of course, it was pretty important stuff there in the last segment.

[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.120]
No, no.

[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.580]
Who's the biggest nerd of them all?

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.380]
I think I figured out how to solve Eric's dilemma by the way, George.

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.680]
Because Eric's acting up again.

[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.040]
No, no, he's got a lot of other stuff to do.

[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.960]
I mean, we're small potatoes.

[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.400]
He doesn't make any money off our website.

[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.780]
It's a labor of love.

[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.820]
He's doing it here.

[00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.420]
But on these days when we do like two polls like today, when we do the preliminary one and we're building the second one.

[00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.920]
Yeah.

[00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.100]
Even though it'll cut down on the number of votes, we don't have to put the second one until the end of the show.

[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.620]
Okay.

[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.480]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.580]
There's no reason why we have to follow.

[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.780]
No, you're right.

[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.580]
We have the show poll and the post poll.

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.340]
So we compile it and then we put it on Earth, the other show and just one quick facts or email over to Eric and he slaps it on it.

[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.680]
And that's it.

[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.300]
So he doesn't have to devote all his precious time eating time.

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:28.920]
I mean, working time to the near-ranges website because we want to maintain a great quality we've had on Earth thanks to your close personal drug addicted friend.

[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.640]
Who's the biggest nerd of them all?

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.220]
We asked yesterday, what is a long list here?

[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.200]
I don't have time to read them all.

[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280]
We'll just do the double digit ones.

[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.960]
1153 votes.

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.400]
Bill Gates wins hands down your pantaloni's man.

[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.300]
People hate Bill Gates and they can't stand Microsoft and all that crap.

[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.220]
They want him to just die a wicked death.

[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.240]
Bill Gates 234.

[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.280]
Carrotop 117.

[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.800]
Woody Allen 97.

[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.420]
George W. Bush 91.

[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.880]
Rick Riley 47, who's been off the air for a long, how long have you been off a couple of years now?

[00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.360]
That's about right.

[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.820]
I think that's pretty good 47 votes for being off the air that long, but they remember what a nerd he was.

[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.700]
Paul Schaefer 39.

[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:05.420]
Al Gore 35.

[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:06.740]
Jew Lieberman 33.

[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.880]
Joseph Gaki 32.

[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.080]
Oh, I forgot to ask God how come he sucks Joseph Gaki's ass. Don't even forget tomorrow.

[00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.600]
Uh oh, you're supposed to remind me, but we were sure it on time because I've already went up for all in Joseph Gaki.

[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.440]
Can you believe how long that break went on?

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.860]
Yeah, I believe it.

[00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.640]
Three minutes after 10?

[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:23.840]
Why are you just giving the whole first segment?

[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.080]
Fine with me.

[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.800]
Less work, more pay. That's my motto.

[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.500]
He can go till 10.30 if he wants.

[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.500]
Shabwool is dead. Good enough for Howard's sperm. It's good enough for for Ralph. You can go till 10.30, baby.

[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.320]
Just let me get in the spots.

[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.600]
Joseph Gaki 32 Ben Stein and Brian Orcross each had 31. Adam Sandler 29.

[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.940]
Screech had 29.

[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.520]
Geldie had 29. He was a later dish. Nice going, Geldie.

[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.640]
Oh!

[00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.940]
Tucker Carlson and George Willich had 24, a couple of right wing assholes with bow ties.

[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.620]
Ross P. Roe 22.

[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.620]

Bob Costa 17.

[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.160]
Sean Headley and Matthew Lesco 16.

[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.200]
And J. Feeler 16.

[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.860]
What a big years.

[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.760]

[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.060]
Rick Moranis 12.

[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.380]
Clay A. Kintin and word Al Yankovic 10.

[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.400]
That's what Clarence said this morning.

[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.040]
He wanted for the new year. More Anus.

[00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.980]
He said they yesterday too.

[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.480]
He said every day. He ain't getting it though.

[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.840]
He ain't getting much.

[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.420]
So that's our yesterday poll.

[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.700]
Now here's the first one today.

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.520]
As we're poll intensive.

[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.200]
Climb on it.

[00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.620]
Now that we got the official announcement by John Edwards who's got a

[00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:22.940]
Chanaman's chance in purgatory.

[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.640]
And now Wesley Clark General, Wesley Clark's going to throw his hand on the ring today.

[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.040]
Right.

[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.100]
Why do they use that expression?

[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.160]
You ever thought about that throw his hat into the ring?

[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.320]
What a stupid ass thing.

[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.660]
It comes from some assholes.

[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.000]
Back in the days when he used to wear those big fedoras.

[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.980]
Right. Remember the godfather Michael had that big fedora?

[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.460]
Is that like if you wanted to participate in the boxing match?

[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.520]
When he came back to CK, when he would have class outside of school,

[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.600]
he had that big old fashion for the runner.

[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.960]
Yeah. That was a really fashionable very gay hat.

[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.880]
What's important, K is that.

[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.700]
How are let's see. Who'd you like to see as the Democratic presidential candidate next year?

[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.340]
And here's the list. I think I got them all on her.

[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.100]
And we don't want any names of like Hillary people that are running.

[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.340]
Little Bush.

[00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.520]
People that are running.

[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.400]
Howard Dean, Wesley Clark, Julie Berman, John Kerry, Bob Graham, John Edwards,

[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.880]
Al Sharpton, Venice Kiss and it's Keralmozly Braun.

[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.560]
I don't care. I'm for Bush or I don't care.

[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.060]
They all suck.

[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:16.560]
I think I got a cover there, don't you?

[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.700]
That's it. Did I leave anybody out?

[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:19.540]
That's what I should say.

[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.600]
That's actually running? Right. Anyone really?

[00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:25.400]
No, no, seriously. I even put like Keralmozly Braun on her.

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:26.440]
Nobody knows who that is.

[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.200]
Al Sharpton's kind of a joke, but he's running.

[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.740]
And let me also say this, the FDA sucks.

[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.720]
I just want to mention it.

[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.080]
Oh, look at this. 14 more suits.

[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.400]
So priest and church. Where's this? The Cincinnati.

[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.840]
Jesus, this stuff is just pouring in here about the god damn priests.

[00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.580]
The most important story of the day though is about.

[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:44.840]
It's a 90's, that gave a coming out of the door.

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.680]
It's a 90's, that gave this to Bob.

[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:47.480]
Oh, you're rolling.

[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.720]
Oh, you're rolling.

[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:57.200]
Just to show you what a banana republic stuff Florida is.

[00:07:59.320 --> 00:07:59.640]
Sweet.

[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.840]
Dolphins, plant tributes, acnes, and cruise, it fills match-up on Sunday.

[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.760]
How do you like that? I mean, what kind of crap is that?

[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.220]
Are they having a tributed to John Ritter?

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.880]
No. No. Are they having a tributed to Johnny Cash?

[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.960]
The Audible. I bet it's going to sing any Johnny Cash music Sunday at the ballgame?

[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:12.400]
No.

[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.840]
But only in a banana republic, baby.

[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.180]
They're doing it again.

[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.460]
The dolphins have announced plants told a tribut to sauce a legend.

[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:27.000]
Celia Cruz during half time a Sunday night's game against the bills.

[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.400]
But that could be an ugly game, man.

[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.080]
Cruz's husband, Pedro Knight will receive a dollar.

[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.300]
Do you think he's keen to Sunday night?

[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.480]
Or receive, I guess it's confidential.

[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.300]
Well, receive a dolphin's jersey during the tributy which will include a performance

[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.740]
by Latin Grammy nominee Victor Manuel.

[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.420]
To obviously he's not from Cuba.

[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.800]
Better not be.

[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.240]
A cruise 78 out of a brain tumor July 16th,

[00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.500]
the Cuban exile was immensely popular in Miami.

[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.200]
So much so that Kaya Ocho, the main street running through the city's Cuban community,

[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.860]
has the honorary name of Celia Cruz' way.

[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.380]
I thought that dressing in drag was the Celia Cruz' way.

[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.080]
If you don't know the answer, you'll see the world.

[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.840]
You'll see the world.

[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:03.920]
You'll see the world.

[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.340]
You'll see the world.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.500]
You'll see the world.

[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.280]
The tributy's part of a Latin theme-dited pro player's day to honor

[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.560]
of Hispanic Heritage Month.

[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.700]
I didn't even know that. Did you with Hispanic Heritage Month?

[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:15.320]
I had no idea.

[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.060]
Are you proud of Hispanic Heritage?

[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.440]
Oh, yeah. I got the flag painted on my face.

[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.840]
Well, I would be proud too unless I lived in South Florida.

[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:24.640]
Then I'd be embarrassed.

[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.140]
Anyway, Marty Centron leads singer of the Latin pop group.

[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.960]
No mercy, a sketch of performed the star-spangled banner before the game on acoustic guitar.

[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.800]
In addition to 150 fifth graders from venture-print elementary school at Haya,

[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.860]
will be on the field for the halftime ceremony holding flags from 20 Hispanic nations.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.800]
No picket of eye English, okay?

[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:46.440]
So there you go. That's what's going on Sunday night before the bills trounced at Alphans.

[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.080]
Well, probably be one of the most embarrassing losses since that 62-7.

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.280]
Was that the score at Jacksonville?

[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.080]
It was pretty bad.

[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.060]
No, no, wasn't that 62-7?

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.620]
You know, now that you're on the payroll, these ambiguous answers aren't going to cut it.

[00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.900]
Let's get right to the chase.

[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.460]
I am Alphans.

[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:06.240]
We're now welcome Senator John Kerry joining us from the Moyni-Democrat of Massachusetts,

[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.580]
now an official candidate for his party's nomination.

[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:09.840]
I'm by dad. Don't get there up.

[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.200]
Don't have some phone calls. You're watching Larry King Live.

[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.600]
Denver, Colorado. Hello.

[00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.760]
Senator Kerry, how will you pay off the deficit?

[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.540]
You're going to have to kick back in more money now.

[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.060]
And by the way, we're going to penalize every family in America.

[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.700]
Port Gritchie Florida, hello.

[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.380]
Senator Kerry, is it true that you used to work at Sears as an American?

[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.960]
Oh, absolutely. You have 19 years experience.

[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.440]
Olympia Washington, hello.

[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.360]
Senator Kerry, what will you do with healthcare?

[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.020]
I had healthcare because I'm the United States senator and I could afford it.

[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:41.300]
And that's why I'm going to see to it that everyone in America can't get what I got.

[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.700]
We can't serve all of you because we don't have enough money.

[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.740]
The reason we don't have enough money, Larry, is because I party.

[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.480]
Gardner Massachusetts, hello.

[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.520]
Senator Kerry, how's the healthiest?

[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.180]
Are you really nice to ask?

[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.560]
I'm able to say that I am cured and I want to stay that way.

[00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:58.500]
Thank you, Senator. We'll be seeing you again soon.

[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.180]
Thanks so much.

[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.000]
Senator John Kerry now an official candidate for his party's nomination.

[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:07.760]
Can 19 at 560 WQM, so somebody immediately faxes this in, which we thank them profusely?

[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.640]
What is the meaning in the origin of the expression to throw one's hand into the ring?

[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:16.180]
When you throw or toss your hand into the ring, what you're doing is informing everyone that you're willing to enter a contest.

[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:24.560]
The expression these days is normally used in politics when somebody throws his hand in or into the ring, he's announcing to the world, he's a candidate in the coming election.

[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.640]
In other words, he's contesting. Here are a few examples.

[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.180]
Renuka is seriously considering throwing your hand into the ring this time.

[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.540]
Arjun, this is from the Hindu newspaper in India. So that's why we got these Indian names.

[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:39.620]
Yeah. Arjun is tossed his hand into the ring. This should make things interesting.

[00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:42.100]
I would sound people out of the four throwing my hand.

[00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:50.060]
The expression comes from the sport of boxing in the old days whenever somebody threw his hand in the ring in boxing, it implied that he was challenging the boxer, he was willing to fight the person in the ring.

[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.340]
A well-known boxer, John L. Sullivan, used to go through this ritual every time he fought.

[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:59.160]
After defeating his opponent, Sullivan would toss his hand in the ring. This was a challenge to the people in the audience.

[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.920]
If the man who challenged him was able to reign on his feet to the end of the bat, then Sullivan used to give him a prize.

[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.280]
They were not too many occasions when he actually had to pay the challenger. How do you like that?

[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:16.280]
So the original meaning of throwing a hand in the ring was to challenge it was only in the 19th century the expression took on a meeting it has today announcing one's political candidacy.

[00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:20.280]
How do you like that? And probably has something to do with hat trick and hockey too when you think that's not...

[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:20.840]

[00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.160]
No. Probably not.

[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.720]
Anyway, I love this fact. This is a very good stuff.

[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.240]
Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson prayed on the Christian broadcasting network based in Virginia Beach that Isabel would turn from the coast.

[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:45.400]
He asked God to put a wall of protection around Virginia Beach and East Coast. In the name of Jesus, we reach our hand in faith, commanded storm to cease its forward motion of the North and turn and go out into the sea.

[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:49.420]
Robertson prayed on the 700 Club. Is he got any chance of that happening? No.

[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:53.460]
As he continues moving north-northwest at about nine miles per hour.

[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:01.580]
In fact, I'm thinking right now I have a psychic vision that it's going to go plowing right into Virginia Beach and right up Pat Robertson's ass.

[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.300]
How do you like that? You can only pray. If you ask me, that's what I'm praying for.

[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.300]
Oh, in the name of Jesus, in the name of...

[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.000]
Damn, God.

[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:14.620]
Let's pray that that storm that they eye the old brown eye of Hurricane Isabel.

[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.600]
Why is it that every time I say that? No, I start thinking of...

[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.780]
Let's see if that grew. I can't stop. Every time I start that crap, I just can't stop playing it, you know?

[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.020]
Newspaper, Newspaper.

[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:47.000]
Now, the enthusiasm of Sunday night celebration, and tribute to Celia, maybe temperate somewhat when a PA announcer doesn't answer the crowd officially, it has been determined by the autopsy that Celia was a man.

[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.120]
But that's beside the point.

[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.480]
I guess people discriminating, people already knew that, didn't they? I guess.

[00:13:53.520 --> 00:14:00.400]
So, Pat Robertson says he's praying for it. Now, a lot of people dying. That's why I've played those, I'm dying over here, things a lot of people dying to drop a light flight.

[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.460]
We can't even keep track. In fact, the sun's set. Seriously, I don't want to go to aap on it because obviously

[00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:10.400]
South Florida is so insensitive anyway. They don't really give a crap. We didn't have one call from anybody since Monday

[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.080]
I announced that anybody saying, well, you know, Don Cox was a real personality and it's really a shame.

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.100]
I was only 55 years old. He died in his sleep. He was up there taking care of his ill mother in Jojen, Atlanta.

[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.180]
Nothing because the people of South Florida are callous and indifferent. So maybe they deserve this come sentinel.

[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:31.600]
See, even if they would even if Duff wouldn't have emailed the information to Tom Jicke, which he did. He told me that again this morning.

[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:35.620]
Even if he wouldn't have done that, they could have ripped it off out of the hero, which wouldn't be the first time that they've done that.

[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.840]
Sure, but no, because when jury Williams died, did they care? No, when the casper died, did they?

[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.940]
No, because Tom Jicke or one of those guys might have to do a little homework and talk to a couple of people,

[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:54.660]
which is so much more difficult and time-consuming than just writing a puff opinion piece about some bogus fall TV show that's going to get canceled in three weeks anyway.

[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:00.520]
See, I think you're the one that's wrong. I see keep presuming that Tom Jicke is a radio writer. He obviously stopped doing that.

[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:06.160]
No, I just said Tom Jicke or somebody. I'm assuming him because he's supposed to be the long time long standing radio TV.

[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.360]
He made one of those hands of that. But he washed his hands. Well, maybe he was a person in an international airport.

[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:21.020]
What a crocker crap. You know, this is the kind of stuff that makes it and they newswires. Oh, 96% of the people at Toronto International Airport, which it's not called,

[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:28.080]
are washing their hands as compared to like 75% how about some of the Pakistanis and Indian people? Are they washing it? No, and you can believe me.

[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:36.000]
You know, I've brought that up so many times over the years and people refuse to acknowledge. I guess because there's so many parochial people in the US,

[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:42.100]
they refuse to acknowledge that people's diet and their skin pigmentation result in a different aroma. You know what I'm saying?

[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:48.420]
Right. Sure. Because it's very easy to say, well gee, they haven't seen a bar of soap in 15 years and that's possible. I guess by,

[00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:56.940]
I think there's like a pigmentation thing like people from India and Pakistan. Ooh, you don't say not not all. Like curry.

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.820]
Kid curry has something to do with it. I'm sure he did. I figured it out. Him now that is good buddy done.

[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.200]
Cost is that on Monday. At least I'll say one thing for kid curry is not making that an excuse to screw off. Okay. Like Greg redid.

[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:14.740]
Oh, gee. I'm all broken up about Cox. I can't deal with that now. But we did get Scott on a payroll. He's got the paperwork filled out.

[00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:21.580]
He's like a step away from the payroll. It's coming. Anyway, guess who died? You already know because you fact he's right. I got too

[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:26.540]
a magic. I'm going to go. Let me show you the other one first. The one that doesn't really bother me all that much. I'm not broken up about it.

[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.240]

[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:55.740]
Just like Pat Robertson, we cannot fully understand why the healing we begged for was not granted. Mark Armstrong said in a written statement. I know that my dad fully expected that his work will continue.

[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.440]
And we've all got a enormous responsibility to make certain that his work has not been in vain and that his voice will not be silenced. Yaddy yaddy yaddy yaddy.

[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.940]
Mr. Armstrong found the church of God or national in 1978 after his father Herbert W Armstrong. The late father of the worldwide church of God

[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:19.280]
excommunicated his son from the church based in Pasadena, California. He found the Garner Ted Armstrong evangelical, even evangelistic association in Tyler and 78 along with the church of God or national. Yaddy yaddy yaddy.

[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:32.420]
How do you like that? Yeah, that was the original one was Herbert W Armstrong. I forgot about him. Hope and then we had Garner Ted and now we've got

[00:17:32.420 --> 00:18:02.400]
no mean either. Maybe God was busy. Maybe he was maybe God was working on attribute for Celia Cruz. We would be doing a van head by the way for the best of the

[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:07.020]
other death. This is really sad. Vulker Brian is going to be all broke up about this and all the other old parts like us too.

[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:08.280]
One big guy. If he said one big brown eyes are we. It was a one I'd one foreign time.

[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.960]

The un-the-binator republic, baby. Only in Miami.

[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:10.340]
She was a community icon. In a community that needs tonight, God. As far as I can't tell, she was the fantastic iconoplastic.

[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.020]
Celia proved.

[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:33.660]
And Goliath William Records presents the dulcet Bolivia sounds of Celia Cruz. She's dead, you know.

[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.000]
She was so beautiful.

[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:45.100]
She was a young angel. She's got a boy. If I were a guy, it's a girl. If you were a baby, we are a angel.

[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.640]
She's got a boy. If I were a guy, it's a girl. If you were a baby, we are a angel.

[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.400]
Celia Cruz. Who's so such a lose for you?

[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.760]
A bellable bell. If they're teased, you see the employer.

[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.420]
So I'm keeping my eye on Isabel. And I'm noticed that if it just takes a slight jog, you know how these things wobble

[00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.320]
first to the west, first to the west, first to the west, just a slight jog to the east.

[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.900]
It's going to smack right into Virginia Beach.

[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.940]
Oh, I just went to the east. I'm praying. I suck it by the chicken.

[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.500]
Oh, Jesus, please. Here's a lady in plantation. Hello.

[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.900]
Hi, Nihalee. How are you doing?

[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.860]
Pretty good. How are you?

[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.260]
I'm fine, thanks. I'm calling to see if you can kind of pressure me,

[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.560]
yell, and to put 10 pointing a location today.

[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.920]
Because then like rearranging my days like a meetup wherever he's going to be.

[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.720]
I don't think he's going to be anywhere today except in the orifice and the Marines or office.

[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.520]
Because you mentioned on Monday he would be out in the van on Wednesday.

[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.820]
Well, that's what they keep telling me and they keep stalling it off.

[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:35.760]
I foresee a real mitigated disaster this year in our fundraiser because they're just,

[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.700]
we always get leftovers. We get nothing.

[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.160]
This radio station gives us absolutely no assistance whatsoever.

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.260]
Well, maybe you can use some of your pressure there and get them out.

[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.780]
Well, where would you like them to be?

[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.660]
I'm going to groward. I don't care.

[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.800]
How about that, Shalette University in Broward? That's always a real popular spot.

[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.740]
Fact that's right by where I'm at right now.

[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.420]
That's what I'm saying. I'm going to work on it.

[00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:59.160]
Okay, great. You have a good day, Neil.

[00:22:59.260 --> 00:22:59.820]
You two, thanks.

[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:00.400]
All right.

[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:03.880]
There you go. Miguel, the University in Broward to Shalette says one of our most popular spots.

[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.740]
Across where the cops used to make the coffee but that can be insurant.

[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:07.240]
They're no more.

[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:07.960]
No, that's too bad.

[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.160]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:09.320]
No.

[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:12.740]
Oh, well, that's kind of my, uh, neighborhood University in Broward.

[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.880]
Right across from me, once popular, Broward Mall.

[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.700]
I'm right down the street from the once not so popular, Macy's Mall.

[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.800]
Does anybody really ever shop in at Macy's Mall?

[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.880]
As always, Jan with cars.

[00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.500]
I haven't been there in so long.

[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.620]
Probably just the people who worked there.

[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.580]
No, the last time I was there is when you did a fundraising appearance there.

[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:28.980]
Right, and it was like nobody there.

[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.860]
That was your birthday.

[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.520]
That's right, Dan, the gigantic birthday cake.

[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.100]
Nobody was there because Ruan was there in a stanchilla.

[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.760]
No, sure, they were screaming running out of there.

[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.840]
They got with the eyes of there.

[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:40.020]
What is that smell? What is that smell?

[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:40.580]
It was screaming.

[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.060]
Rack them.

[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.160]
Well, whatever part it was.

[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.540]
Anyway, here's the first poll.

[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.360]
It's up there now and we're like, like I said,

[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.720]
74 votes, Wesley Clark 21 Howard Dean 15.

[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.600]
I don't care.

[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:51.580]
They all suck 13.

[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:52.280]
I don't care.

[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.440]
I'm for Bush 8 10.

[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.740]
28% of this crowd Bob Graham 8.

[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.120]
Al Sharpton 5 John Kerry is scary three.

[00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.480]
John Edwards 1 0 for Julie Berman.

[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:00.920]
Boy.

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.660]
That's because the Orthodox Jews have been in this show and the thank goodness.

[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.580]
Dennis, considered maybe they're out there rubbing their tisses together.

[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.580]
Dennis, considered it's none and care mostly brown has none.

[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:11.620]
Isn't that a shock?

[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.680]
No, so.

[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.580]
So then now the poll that we're going to work on today during the show.

[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:18.840]
And like I said, thanks again to Mike and Cooper City or wherever it was.

[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:19.840]
It wasn't Cooper City.

[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.240]
Where was it?

[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:20.900]
I don't know.

[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.280]
Mike in the Yenem's belt who faxed yesterday.

[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.800]
Coconut Creek about dead people because it really pisses off Mo.

[00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.400]
Absolutely.

[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.740]
And we do polls on dead people.

[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.240]
We still have this gigantic audience and he has no numbers at all.

[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:35.500]
By the way, the trend tomorrow morning at 1130, the Arbor trends for June,

[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.460]
July and Augusto.

[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.560]
It's going to be really pressure packed.

[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:40.540]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm listening.

[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.740]
It's going to be heavy, heavy, duty.

[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:43.880]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.620]
So the first we're going to do a series of these polls on dead people.

[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:50.780]
And then we'll have like a dead off at the end, right?

[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.160]

[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:54.280]
The place that that dead political figure by the way,

[00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.620]
Schmidt Candidate idea had Eric.

[00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.880]
That was a really bad idea and quit interfering with programming.

[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.420]
See, I saw his dilemma right off the bat tonight.

[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:01.640]
That was brilliant, by the way.

[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.200]
Then I have it to sit there for all four hours and adding and throw.

[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.920]
And also for you emailing.

[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.700]
All of a sudden I can just email right to tell us at the end.

[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.300]
And then they have plenty of time.

[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.240]
They got like a whole bunch of hours to vote on it.

[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.880]
And it also leaves the first poll up there.

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.720]
Whatever we do, we can do a whole bunch of polls.

[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:17.760]
I've done that.

[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.260]
So you say in one day, oh my, who's your favorite dead political figure?

[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.500]
JFK, this is a list I got so far.

[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.980]
JFK Martin Luther King, Thomas Jefferson, FDR,

[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.720]
Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln, or Bobby Kennedy.

[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.160]
I think that's a good list.

[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:31.920]
Dave or starter.

[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:33.600]
Don't you?

[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:34.320]
I like it.

[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.300]
I mean, somebody probably said William Henry Harrison.

[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:38.160]
I don't have enough sense to come out of a rain.

[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:38.820]
I like that.

[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:39.980]
Tippy canoe and Tyler too.

[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.180]
Do you ever see pictures of him?

[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:43.200]
No.

[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.620]
William Henry Harrison?

[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.340]
No, I mean, I'm having paintings of him.

[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.420]
I wouldn't even see pictures.

[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.580]
You would see painting, right?

[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.900]
Like grizzled old white-haired guy in a,

[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.360]
look like an old troll.

[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.640]
Speaking of old trolls,

[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.860]
14 men yesterday sued the Roman Catholic

[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.760]
arts sciences of Cincinnati, arch-Precipitial,

[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.820]
Polargic and the Reverend Lawrence Strip Matter

[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.480]
of Kettering, Ohio bringing to 24 the number of man

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.900]
claiming in lawsuits that Strip Matter sexually abused them

[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.440]
as boys and arch-stices covered it up.

[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.240]
In fact, let me find my story from the Boston Globe.

[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.600]
Here it is, before I finish with that story to let me forget.

[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.520]
In the month after releasing its much-anticipated

[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.780]
new child protection policy, I made 30 of the officials

[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.760]
in the arts dynasties of Boston quietly revised the document

[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.960]
to curb access by alleged victims' abuse

[00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:26.580]
to records of church proceedings in case of accused priests.

[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.500]
Preces.

[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.120]
That's like breakfastes.

[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.560]
The revisions which church officials say were necessary to correct

[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.160]
ambiguous language in the published policy

[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.180]
of drawn criticism from advocates for abuse victims

[00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.280]
who fear of backing away by the church,

[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:43.040]
a backing away by the church from promises of greater openness

[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:43.980]
in such matters.

[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.540]
The changes to the policy were apparently made

[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.080]
without the knowledge of members of the commission

[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.040]
appointed by Cardinal Law to help crafted

[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.360]
or members of a second their lay advisory committee

[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.460]
charged with overseeing its implement.

[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.200]
In other words, in quiet behind closed doors

[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.260]
they're trying to like do everything they can to hush it up.

[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.460]
Anyway, getting back to Ohio.

[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.560]
The 14 men referred to as John Doe's numbers 11-24

[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:05.700]
in the lawsuit filed in Hamilton County Common Police Court

[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.180]
say they were abused by Strip Matter between 1960 and 1988

[00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:10.280]
while he was working in Cincinnati,

[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.200]
including a stint as principal of elder high school.

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.180]
Always be nice to your elders.

[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.660]
Strip Matter's 24 accusers are seeking four million dollars each

[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.260]
in damages a total of 96 million.

[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.360]
The Arthas Dice's Assigned Strip Matter now 70 to be

[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.240]
associate pastor of St. Albert the Great Church in Kettering in 1988

[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.200]
after he was removed from a Cincinnati church

[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.320]
because they substantiated abuse allegation

[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.880]
and required to undergo inpatient psychological therapy.

[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.960]
And it goes on and on and on.

[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:38.560]
It's a long story.

[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:40.220]
I'm sure that's only the beginning.

[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:43.360]
Another one of those isolated series of incidents,

[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.920]
another isolated 24 and just with that one priest.

[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.400]
And it goes on like I said it on and nobody cares.

[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.420]
Just like Dick Cheney who keeps lying through his teeth,

[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:52.340]
here's the latest one.

[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:55.440]
That only go on meat to press on Sunday and lie about the

[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.800]
connection between Iraq, which now Don Rumsfeld,

[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.300]
no less than Don Rumsfeld says,

[00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:02.540]
oh there's no link between Iraq and 9-11.

[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:03.440]
What?

[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:04.360]
Really?

[00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.240]
Yeah, the Defense Secretary Don Rumsfeld said yesterday

[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.200]
he had no reason to believe that Iraq saw him who's saying had any hand

[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.380]
at the September 11 terrorist attacks in the US.

[00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:14.900]
At a Pentagon news conference,

[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.240]
Rumsfeld was asked about a pool that indicated nearly 70% of respondents

[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.320]
believe the Iraqi leader probably was personally involved.

[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:23.820]
I've not seen any indication that would lead me to believe I could say that,

[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:24.660]
Rumsfeld said.

[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:25.480]
How do you like that?

[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:26.160]
I'm shocked.

[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.740]
Yeah, a random act of honesty.

[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:32.780]
Now Vice President Cheney, who of course is in addition to that lie about that,

[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:36.040]
the former CEO of Halliburton companies received hundreds of thousands

[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.800]
of dollars from the company and deferred salary payments and taking orifice,

[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.220]
while asserting he has no financial interest in the company,

[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.320]
Senate Democrats said yesterday.

[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:44.880]
Senate democratically to Tom Dashel,

[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:46.400]
the South Dakota and Senator Frank Lautenberg,

[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.300]
New Jersey said the revelations be enforced today.

[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.500]
Oh, you know we left off the pool,

[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.300]
Dick Gavhart.

[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.480]
How about Bob Graham?

[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:54.780]
He's on there.

[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.680]
Dick Gavhart, George, make sure that they're okay.

[00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:57.380]
I'm sorry.

[00:28:57.820 --> 00:28:59.860]
So easy to forget about Dick for some.

[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.380]
Senate democratically to Tom Dashel,

[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.840]
the South Dakota Senator Frank Lautenberg,

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.000]
which is he said the revelations be enforced and need for hearings about the nobid contracts

[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.120]
for reconstruction work in Iraq,

[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.320]
that Halliburton is received from the Bush administration.

[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.260]
On NBC's Meet the Press program Sunday,

[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.980]
Cheney lied, a Cheney study had severed all ties with the Houston-based company.

[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.440]
Kathy Martin, a Cheney spokeswoman, confirmed that Cheney had been receiving payments from Halliburton,

[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.560]
has been, but she disputed that a statement on Meet the Press had been misleading.

[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.020]
Right.

[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.780]
Cheney had already earned the salary that was now being paid, Martin said,

[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:29.920]
adding that once he became a nominee for Vice President,

[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.820]
he bought an insurance policy to guarantee that the deferred salary would be paid to him.

[00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.520]
So it's just, you know, it's like a chess game, you know, like a shadow boxing,

[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:43.280]
like a shell game, like they do on prices right, you know,

[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:45.260]
where they move the thing around under the appena shells.

[00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.200]
That's what he's doing.

[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.360]
He's moving it around under the Pena shells, old Dick Cheney.

[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:53.420]
Just unbelievable.

[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:56.860]
In fact, one of the bedtime stories that we have on our website today is about the fact that

[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.440]
this president has lied more to the country than any president in the history of this country.

[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:01.700]
And I think that whoever wrote that is...

[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.420]
Absolutely correct, sir.

[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.000]
19 to 11 at 560 WQM.

[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.100]
We got a pristine schedule.

[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.100]
The Marlins who had a tough 14-nothing loss in Philly last night just got it's doubt.

[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:13.100]
They'll give it another shot tonight.

[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.160]
We got the Mad Dog at 2, the Humber in a studio 4 to 630.

[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:17.420]
Marlins on deck 630.

[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.120]
Marlins at the Philly 705 to try to recover from last night's annihilation.

[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.380]
80K follows the baseball game in June Mark overnight.

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.120]
That's our schedule.

[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.260]
If you're on QAM.

[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:27.720]
If you're on schedule to start getting your hair back,

[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.280]
there's only one smart way to do it to come.

[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.320]
I've got my girlfriend Chuck Alphyr.

[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.640]
It is a zillion guys out there.

[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.200]
They're lined up at your dough right now.

[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.700]
They want to sell your pills.

[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:35.960]
They want to sell your propitia.

[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.260]
They want to sell your dead muskrats and weasels.

[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.520]
They want to give you every kind of song and an answer to get you to buy their hair system.

[00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:42.220]
Well, here's the deal.

[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:46.840]
Charles Alphyr is the best in the business because nowhere else can you get a more natural,

[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.820]
better looking piece than from Chuck Alphyr.

[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.140]
It's a very affordable price too.

[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:52.420]
So if you'd like just like a little bit of hair back,

[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.960]
or you got a big shiny bald spot,

[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.300]

2 a.m.

[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.520]
3 a.m.

[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.760]
a.m.

[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.200]
Dick Clark sucks just watch Bulleye for Columbine.

[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:17.080]
You'll see the embarrassing attempt that Michael Moore had to interview him

[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.760]
about his slave laborer in Michigan.

[00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:24.340]
He saw certainly place to hear that his restaurant in Basav went out of business.

[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.980]
Let's hear it for Dick going under.

[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.420]
1048 at 560 W.A.M.

[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.880]
Speaking of that after battling to a virtual draw on same-sex marriage yesterday,

[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:37.300]
the Liberal Canadian government and Canadian alliance agreed to rematch at the ballot box next year.

[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.780]
The divided Liberal government's plan to legalize gay marriage barely passed a critical first test,

[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:47.280]
but it did pass as MPs voted 137-132 against an alliance most to preserve the traditional

[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.760]
definition of marriage as one man and one woman.

[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.640]
And they said, uh-uh.

[00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.040]
Just barely, I watched this matter.

[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.820]
I watched the vote.

[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:54.520]
Yeah.

[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:57.740]
And they like stand up in a mudder and rubber-beat-butter-boop-butter-bass-cilly.

[00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.360]
Where are silly wigs like the Brits?

[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.640]
No, they don't as a matter of fact.

[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.500]
Not like Cedar Cruz.

[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.240]
560-560-560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:10.720]
Here's Miami, hello.

[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.420]
No.

[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.000]
No, not today.

[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:19.600]
Maybe next week.

[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:20.800]
I'll think about it.

[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:21.740]
Miami, hello.

[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:24.380]
Miami, when is this?

[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:24.540]
Yes.

[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.300]
Elp.

[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.500]
Cedar Cruz line, yes.

[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:29.660]
Is this your dad?

[00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:30.720]
Sounds like me.

[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.360]
They always talk about time talks.

[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.300]
I grew up with him in the 70s and 80s.

[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:41.300]
Listen to his shows.

[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.300]
I think we were awesome.

[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:46.280]
And the guy always had a smile-white smile on his face.

[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:46.820]
Right.

[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:48.080]
He'll be missed.

[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.260]
I mean, he's party.

[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.140]
Oh, we party.

[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.380]
Yeah.

[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:57.740]
So, anyway, you got one here that kind of sad for his loss.

[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.000]
Well, thanks for caring enough to send your very best.

[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:00.880]
Are you the only one?

[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.800]
Well, that makes one of us.

[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]
And don't forget time jick is the douchebag.

[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:06.420]
Thank you.

[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.540]
Time jick is an asshole, man.

[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.060]
He really is.

[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.920]
You're showing your two colors last year or two, Tom.

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:10.820]
You're a real schmuck.

[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:12.860]
Talking about having your finger on a pulse

[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:13.880]
of what's happening in the community.

[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:16.580]
Here's the guy that was on here in that market for like 20 or 30 years.

[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.660]
And it's not like we're talking about somebody who, you know,

[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.980]
who left the air 20 years ago or something.

[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.560]
You know, I was outside out of mind that kind of thing.

[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.940]
No, like Jerry Williams.

[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:26.020]
Maybe there was an excuse there, although I don't think so.

[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.560]
But in this particular case, here's the guy that anybody in everybody

[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.500]
who grew up in South Florida, New Cox, on a radio.

[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:34.800]
And the stunt sent, they'll can't be bothered giving the information now.

[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.380]
Jika, you're an embarrassment.

[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.360]
You're an idiot.

[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:37.960]
Okay?

[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.060]
I'm embarrassed that they actually let you fill on this radio station

[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.160]
because you've lost it.

[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.760]
Whenever the hell you had it, I don't know, but you sure as hell have lost it.

[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:48.720]
What in the right is nothing about what's happening in the local community.

[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:52.500]
But nevertheless, I mean, what am I getting excited about?

[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.340]
He's consistent.

[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.120]
He at least he's consistently out to launch.

[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.440]
You just, you know, and this is supposed to be a freaking newspaper.

[00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:58.000]
No.

[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.380]
That's why I keep telling you people, man, if you had a real newspaper in South Florida,

[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.420]
you'd see some real changes, but then never going to happen.

[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:04.280]
It'll never happen.

[00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.720]
If you had a real, like a tabloid, like we got the Toronto Sun here,

[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.000]
even with the right wing politics, but it's like a real newspaper.

[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.120]
If you had a tabloid in there, put the goddamn Sun Settle in the hair right out of

[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.180]
the window, put them to shame, put them on a back burner.

[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:21.240]
A real newspaper with some people who had balls and weren't pandering all the time,

[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.840]
and writing a bunch of puff-piece crap, and who could afford to like

[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.640]
have some real writers in there as opposed to these high school stringer kids that they have

[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.420]
there right, 95% of the crap.

[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.620]
And these dottering silly guys that used to write about dog racing,

[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.940]
pretending to be TV and radio critics and experts.

[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:38.680]
But nevertheless, here's a call from Davie.

[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:38.920]
Hello?

[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.240]
Hello?

[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:41.160]
Yes, sir?

[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.760]
Yeah, I didn't know that Tom Cox was real.

[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.540]
When did this happen?

[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.000]
Sir, it's...

[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.680]
Died Monday morning.

[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:49.620]
See, this up visiting is sick of my there.

[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:50.740]
Where do you have a heart attack or something?

[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:51.900]
You just died in the sleep?

[00:36:52.340 --> 00:36:52.620]
Wow.

[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.620]
What if I have a stand major?

[00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.640]
He died, but nobody told him yet.

[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.580]
It was his career that died, I guess.

[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.020]
I don't know.

[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.620]
He's still fumbling around.

[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.980]
Okay, just curious.

[00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:05.960]
And he still owes me that money too, by the way.

[00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:08.280]
Well, it looks like Larry King owes you $50, right?

[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:08.860]
Exactly.

[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:10.260]
All right, take care.

[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.040]
Okay, you too.

[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.160]
Well, there's a guy who seemed mildly interested.

[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.540]
Who's your favorite dead political figure?

[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.540]
That's the poll we're building.

[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.200]
They all are with them.

[00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.140]
We're not going to any suggestions.

[00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.700]
Because there's so many, but nevertheless,

[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:21.420]
just the piss off Moe.

[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:24.020]
JFK, Martin Luther King, Thomas Jefferson, FDR,

[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.560]
Teddy Roosevelt, Abe Lincoln, Bobby Kennedy.

[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:26.820]
And let's say here Moe.

[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.820]
Let's hear Moe, okay?

[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.220]
In the meantime, pull number one.

[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.000]
And now I see we got Dick Kabbard on there right away.

[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.000]
Now, now, Eric can just sit back, have his brunches,

[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.540]
take care of all of his other important paying customers,

[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.380]
and just forget about us, right?

[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.220]
Okay, even though it is a labor of love.

[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:44.900]
171 votes already.

[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:45.600]
This is shocking.

[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.220]
Who would you like to see as the Democratic

[00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.700]
presidential candidate next year?

[00:37:49.220 --> 00:37:50.280]
General Wesley Clark, who's announcing

[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.720]
the day 45 votes already.

[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.700]
And you want to know why that probably is?

[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.060]
Why?

[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.640]
Probably because they think he can win.

[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:57.040]
Do you think?

[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.100]
It would seem to me.

[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:01.780]
I voted for Howard Dean, who's got 32.

[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.200]
I don't care about those professional Jews who are faxing me

[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.140]
all that crap about they don't like his position on the Middle East.

[00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.860]
Like, suggested them is Coxalhoist, okay?

[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.220]
Take a good, very amenable.

[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:11.700]
Can't hurt.

[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:13.380]
I don't care.

[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:13.920]
They all suck.

[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.080]
30 people say that.

[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:16.280]
Bob Graham, 25.

[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.200]
Too bad BDI Bob does never chance.

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.920]
He's said all the right things, but he has.

[00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.740]
In all the wrong places.

[00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:22.380]
Remember that song?

[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.000]
Sing all the right things in all the wrong places?

[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:25.960]
I don't care.

[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:26.500]
I'm for Bush.

[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.000]
22 people say that about 12.

[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.100]
28%.

[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.400]
Al Sharpen's got seven.

[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.140]
John Kerry, who looks really scary.

[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:32.800]
He's got four.

[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.440]
John Edwards has got two votes.

[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:35.360]
He's got less likely.

[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:36.940]
Yeah, John Edwards.

[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.400]
And what's wrong with having a president

[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:39.360]
who can talk to dead people?

[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.200]
We do.

[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.800]
He'd be perfect for South Florida.

[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.720]
Arzt talk to Jesus.

[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.820]
Dennis Gussinich has got a pair.

[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.900]
Dick Gemhart is, we finally put him on.

[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:47.880]
He's still only got one vote.

[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.400]
Julie Reminds got one.

[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.800]
And Kramos they've gone out of 181 votes.

[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.880]
She's got the big.

[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:55.040]
Oh, who is she, kid?

[00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:56.380]
Now why is she spitting her wheels?

[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:57.100]
What's the point?

[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.880]
What is the point?

[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:01.880]
Why is she wasting our time and our energies?

[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:04.940]
She didn't even get reelected in Illinois.

[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:06.620]
Oh, by the way, my kudos to the, uh,

[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.480]
who is in Illinois?

[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.260]
Is it the governor?

[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.020]
That did what?

[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.960]
And also the mayor of Springfield,

[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.940]
a Massachusetts who are like doing business

[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.080]
who are getting prescription drugs

[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.300]
for the city and, uh,

[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.760]
nah, it's not, it's not the governor.

[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.880]
But for, uh, public employees from Canada

[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.540]
and the FDA is fighting a tooth and nail

[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:25.620]
because the FDA sucks.

[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.740]
The FDA are a bunch of grave robbers

[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.500]
who are embedded with the pharmaceutical companies

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.080]
that who want to continue ripping off

[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:32.680]
the public in America and all over the world

[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.040]
and especially the old people.

[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:34.680]
You're getting it.

[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.580]
We'll get it out, rip them out.

[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.240]
And so now the FDA is trying to back up

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:38.400]
the battle.

[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.280]
He was on this morning on CNBC,

[00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:41.160]
the mayor of Springfield,

[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:43.940]
mass who's saving his city like eight or nine million dollars.

[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.400]
They animate all these budget cutbacks

[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.760]
and cutback cops and all these other

[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.040]
because they didn't have the money.

[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.080]
They didn't have it in the budget.

[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.440]
It's not he's going to re-institute all those positions

[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.020]
and get more cops and more public fire people, etc.

[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.200]
Because, uh,

[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.360]
they're saving eight, nine million dollars a year

[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.700]
buying prescription drugs from Canada.

[00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.720]
And the FDA says,

[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.500]
oh, but do we know about the quality

[00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.500]
or these drugs safe?

[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.880]
The same guy them stuff made by the same companies.

[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:05.600]
Okay, it's like saying,

[00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:07.620]
oh, how can the people in Canada still be alive?

[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.900]
I mean, we don't know if their prescription drugs are safe.

[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.560]
One kind of crap is that.

[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:14.280]
What a lame excuse to try to pull it over.

[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]
They eyes at the, uh,

[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.200]
and then the public course in America says,

[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:17.920]
hey, screw you up.

[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.920]
The FDA, we want to save the money.

[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.820]
We'll take a chance.

[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.960]
We'll take a chance on those drugs

[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.880]
from that dangerous third world country,

[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:25.340]
Canada.

[00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:25.920]
Right.

[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.720]
What a, what a shame and a scam.

[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.500]
Try just mention that in passing.

[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.060]
Here's Miami.

[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:33.380]
Hello.

[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:34.620]
Hello, Neil.

[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:35.360]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:36.140]
How you doing?

[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:36.940]
Pretty good.

[00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.900]
Hey, last week you had a poll about, uh,

[00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.620]
the world's most dangerous men.

[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:42.540]
Yes.

[00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.700]
And you lost, uh, uh,

[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.940]
a good opportunity for whatever you're a little bit.

[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.600]
Do you have that, uh,

[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.120]
outgo scene, uh, one that goes,

[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.080]
ew, like that?

[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.860]
That's, that's, that's got nothing to do with

[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.460]
alcohol, Steve.

[00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:55.780]
You mean,

[00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:58.300]
ew, what is that happening with alcohol, Steve?

[00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.200]
Kim,

[00:40:59.460 --> 00:40:59.880]
Jung,

[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:02.560]
ew,

[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:04.440]
there you go.

[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.420]
Pretty weak.

[00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.460]
By the way, how many Holy Ours are going to be

[00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:10.940]
at the dolphin bills game on Sunday night?

[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.860]
About 30 minutes.

[00:41:11.940 --> 00:41:12.180]
I see.

[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.080]
I don't understand that.

[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.420]
That whole

[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.320]
this pandering thing that just never stops in South Florida.

[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.360]
I could understand if it was like the Sunday night

[00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.680]
cock fights or something like that,

[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.080]
then have a big tribute to Celia Cruz

[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.620]
and have all these Holy Ours.

[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.960]
And those beginning lace people come in there

[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.320]
and do their, uh, uh, uh, uh,

[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.300]
Hoochie Coochie and with the Marachi band.

[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.340]
But at a dolphin game,

[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:30.720]
you know, I mean, what's the point?

[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.780]
You got like crack crackers and juices,

[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:33.760]
the dolphin crowd.

[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.740]
Aren't they just go to Fort Lee where she was living?

[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.260]
In fact, they used the old Jews.

[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.480]
They like those free-salt teens.

[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.560]
They get along good with them crackers.

[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.720]
I beg your pardon?

[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:42.120]
Aren't she just go to,

[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.320]
why don't they just go to Fort Lee?

[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.240]
I mean, she loved the Latin community,

[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.940]
but she was living in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:49.460]
Well, there's probably a lot of teenos

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.480]
in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:51.020]
No, there are.

[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.960]
What's the place in Jersey where they have all the Cubans?

[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:53.500]
What's the place?

[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:56.320]
Rawway State?

[00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:57.340]
No, no, sir.

[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.200]
Oh, come on.

[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.060]
I'm serious.

[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.100]
There's a place in Jersey that's loaded with Cubans.

[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.260]
What is the, uh, where is it?

[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.640]
It might be Bayon.

[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.740]
I can't believe that between you being from Jersey

[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.680]
and George being Cuban,

[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:09.040]
either one of you knows what I'm talking about.

[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:10.040]
What is wrong with the,

[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:10.320]
the people?

[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:10.840]
People from the,

[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:11.220]
the Jersey.

[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:11.660]
Well,

[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.260]
Fort Lee is in Fort Lee,

[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:13.560]
Nielts,

[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.100]
Fort Lee.

[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:15.980]
There's no Cubans in Fort Lee.

[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.280]
1057 and 560 W.

[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:22.740]
You know, I'm just,

[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.080]
I'm working alone to the,

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:25.600]
have the feeling I'm just like in a vacuum,

[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.520]
which is fine with me.

[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:26.920]
It's okay.

[00:42:27.580 --> 00:42:29.540]
Because I'm starting to feel a little bit unclean,

[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.040]
especially now that Scott is on the payroll,

[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:31.960]
or very close to it.

[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.160]
Uh, you might want to reconsider, Clarence, okay?

[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:36.500]
Here's something you want to reconsider.

[00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.540]
That is, it's calling anybody

oh see i don't dare when they're talking i don't dare leave that on

[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.880]
because we don't want to do like scott and jeopardize our careers if by the way scott quit talking

[00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:58.600]
about it you idiot here's vocal hello good morning i'm calling about the rumsville article you

[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:02.520]
mentioned i read it too and i'm sure it's in light of the poll that said nearly 70 percent of

[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.480]
americans believe that i rack was directly related to the nine one one incident right so i went and

[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:11.520]
i started looking up because i specifically remember rumsfeld trying to make that that connection

[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:14.960]
so when i found this on the internet today when he was standing in front of the senate armed

[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.700]
services committee in july he said the objective in the global war on terror is to prevent another

[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.840]
attack like september eleven or biological nuclear or chemical attack that could be worse

[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:28.400]
and he says with confidence the world is a better place today because the u.s. led to coalition

[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:32.680]
of forces in the action in iraq but he draws those parallels he has in you endo and he

[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.660]
throws all this propaganda at us to try to get us to to make the connection between nine eleven

[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:42.040]
and uh... iraq and then two months later he acts like we can't remember what he said two months ago

[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:47.800]
exactly i think the only way to describe it is right they lie a lot

[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.380]
and i have to get a pali thanks uh... thanks pali have a great life

[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.960]
yet the uh... public is starting to see through it like looking through a panic

[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:00.020]
last like looking through a piece of cellophane they lied through their teeth

[00:53:00.020 --> 00:53:03.420]
there are people are american kids over there dying and getting severely wounded

[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:06.220]
air read data was like four more seriously wounded uh... overnight

[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:07.680]
airy single day

[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:12.380]
and by the way since we're still in such a good job between osama yamama and mullabola

[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:12.740]
or mar

[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.380]
and uh... saturday

[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:18.840]
the aerobic news network al-Arabia today broadcast a new audio tape statement

[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:20.160]
attributed to satam who say

[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:24.800]
last month al jazeera broadcasted tape also purported to carry the voice of satam

[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:28.280]
cia officials said they believe there was a high likelihood the voice on the

[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:31.500]
earlier tape was at a saturday and why shouldn't it be he still alive

[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:35.120]
the hit him with five shots he still alive just like that in kolioli

[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:38.880]
in the past few months several tapes that said it would made by saturday

[00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:41.560]
with an air including one in july urging arachis uh...

[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.740]
to resist us forces

[00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:46.480]
this report of the tape follows new attacks on us troops in arach where at least

[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.520]
four soldiers were wounded

[00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.660]
the coalition for public information center said the two day

[00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:55.280]
that's anything else about the tape nights about it

[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:58.900]
but i'd like that a new satam tape we got him yet no no but we're lying and we

[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:03.160]
have the article we had yesterday that we have no idea what i think closer to uh...

[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.640]
osama now that we were before but we're wasting all these billions and billions

[00:54:06.640 --> 00:54:11.220]
and billions of dollars and countless human lives in a in a war of utility for

[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.120]
no purpose whatsoever

[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:15.640]
against the country that now we admit had no weapons of my destruction

[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:19.380]
wasn't connected to al-Qaeda wasn't connected to nine eleven wasn't a threat

[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.600]
to us wasn't forty five minutes away from the bridge with their uh... nuclear

[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.740]

[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:32.660]
they're right

[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.920]

[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.060]

[01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:02.710]
Yeah huh.

[01:09:03.090 --> 01:09:07.490]
No I did read this and I thought now would be a propitious time to pass it along

[01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:10.750]
because the people need to know see another reason that they're all gung-ho for

[01:09:10.750 --> 01:09:13.810]
where Sly Clark is because they don't know too much about him except he has a big

[01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:16.270]
mouth and talked a lot during the war on MSNBC right.

[01:09:16.970 --> 01:09:18.710]
Of course we know how many people walked MSNBC.

[01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:19.570]
But third man.

[01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:21.850]
Where in hell he was on maybe he was on CNN I think he was on

[01:09:21.850 --> 01:09:23.470]
I mean well he's always open in the mouth.

[01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:27.650]
But anyway Katrina Van Den Hovel who writes in the nation

[01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:33.010]
her editorial here's an excerpt that somebody faxed me the other day remember a

[01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.690]
couple days ago like on Monday.

[01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:39.490]
In June 12 1999 and the immediate aftermath of NATO's air war against

[01:09:39.490 --> 01:09:42.690]
Yugoslavia a small contingent of Russian troops dashed to occupy the

[01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:43.990]
Christina Airfield in Kosovo.

[01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:48.170]
Clark was so anxious to stop the Russians that he ordered an airborne assault

[01:09:48.170 --> 01:09:50.790]
to confront these units in order which could have unleashed the most

[01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:53.270]
frightening showdown with Moscow since the end of the Cold War.

[01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:57.950]
War hyperbole you can decide but British general Michael Jackson the three-star

[01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:00.570]
general and commander of K-4 the international force organized

[01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:03.750]
and commanded by NATO to enforce an agreement in Kosovo told Clark

[01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:07.730]
sir I'm not starting World War III for you when refusing to accept his order

[01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:09.810]
to prevent Russian forces from taking over the airport.

[01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.970]
Jackson was rightly worried that any precipitous NATO action

[01:10:12.970 --> 01:10:16.930]
could risk a confrontation with a nuclear armed Russia and upset the NATO-led

[01:10:16.930 --> 01:10:19.810]
peacekeeping plan just getting underway with the withdrawal of Serbian forces

[01:10:19.810 --> 01:10:20.470]
from Kosovo.

[01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:24.450]
Indeed it is in military circles that Clark's pristine incident was the

[01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:28.630]
final straw that led the Pentagon to relieve him of his duties actually

[01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:29.530]
be tear him earlier.

[01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:32.990]
Clark had also angered the Pentagon brass and secretive defense William

[01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:36.270]
Cohen in particular with his numerous media appearances and repeated

[01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:39.270]
public requests for more weapons and for more freedom to wage the

[01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:41.250]
Kosovo war the way he wanted with ground troops.

[01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:45.010]
At one point according to media reports the defense secretary Cohen through

[01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:47.550]
chairman of joint steves of staff he was sheldon to her Clark

[01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:49.790]
to get your effing face off TV.

[01:10:51.390 --> 01:10:52.250]
How do you like that?

[01:10:52.830 --> 01:10:58.090]
He told Clark to get your effing face off TV.

[01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:01.970]
So I don't want to say he might be kind of a media hound maybe a little

[01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:05.890]
bit trigger happy all of these things but just something to think about okay

[01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:08.830]
before you start jumping in with both feet and get all excited and

[01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:12.790]
whipped up into a frenzy okay okay yeah but okay

[01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.890]

they don't want to hear about dead people although lately they're so damn

[01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:15.950]

[01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.770]

He doesn't want to come back anytime soon because he said if he shows up before too. He's got a rim durin

[01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:40.110]
So I don't think I'll be back anytime soon

[01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:45.010]
Well, you never confused him with the rimmer did you?

[01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:46.030]
Oh my no

[01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:49.090]

And you know something he's perfect for the University of Miami

[01:17:57.890 --> 01:18:04.830]
Here they got a choice between a consummate professional who got screwed over by Moe by the way and the dolphin organization

[01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:12.650]
Absolutely Bill Zimper who did out yeoman work an excellent job on the dolphins nine seasons with the mad dog and was was available to do

[01:18:12.650 --> 01:18:13.530]
You have him football

[01:18:13.530 --> 01:18:18.450]
And the University being the typical bush Lake Neanderah. Oh, no

[01:18:18.450 --> 01:18:22.230]
We want to have the same guy doing all of our sports and we want Josie

[01:18:23.970 --> 01:18:27.370]
Fits in perfectly with the entire ambience of the University of Miami

[01:18:27.370 --> 01:18:32.030]
Donna no ball Shalala and a whole thing over there in the Gables makes me want to puke, okay?

[01:18:32.350 --> 01:18:34.130]
Donna you sick idiotic bitch

[01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:39.850]
Oh, that's the most disgusting thing I ever saw get our name off that billboard right away. We've got balls

[01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:47.030]
You got no balls honey although rumors were they had big ones. That's what bubble was saying even Joseph press

[01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:53.090]
Oh my oh my here's a fact from Lisa in North Miami says what would knowing where Iraq is on a map

[01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:57.110]
Two knowing what's really going on in the world because you all read prove

[01:18:58.570 --> 01:18:59.010]
Oh

[01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:02.650]
It would make it any easier for anyone if we knew about it or not

[01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:08.070]
I see now why you and George take drugs because you concern yourselves with all that negative crap and it pisses y'all off

[01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:13.110]
This has got to be phony it is I don't care where Iraq is nor do I want to have so much more to say

[01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:18.030]
But thought you might not read this right phony and this is the same as the was it Tracy that day? Yeah, phony name here

[01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:28.090]
Building code compliance my ass fake facts. Yeah another fake facts from a fake Lisa for the y'all y'all read y'all god hang on what y'all got Lisa, which probably

[01:19:28.090 --> 01:19:28.410]
much

[01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:36.810]
56705 60 is I'm not depressed about anything. I'm a happy camper. Wait you may. I'm happy. He's happy again. Slop

[01:19:37.530 --> 01:19:42.310]
It's sloppy. Oh, I'm a little bit upset about the fact Joseph Gackie is on WQM doing anything

[01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:48.490]
I mean like I said nice got to have around give my paycheck just to keep him you know him is a lovely wife to have to eat now and in

[01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:55.610]
Wesley carts got 99 votes who'd you like to see is democratic presidential candidate next year Wesley parked 99

[01:19:56.850 --> 01:20:04.130]
374 votes all told howardine 67 I don't care. They all suck 61. I don't care. I'm for bush 52 13.9 percent

[01:20:04.130 --> 01:20:11.310]
Oh Bob Graham 49 John Kerry 13 now sharpened in 12 John Edwards 11 Dennis Kassin is forward to give hard for

[01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:15.530]
Carol Mosley Braun one Julie Berman one see the fact that we got out of this audience almost

[01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:20.170]
14% for bush that tell what about we said he could hold a

[01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:27.930]
I have speech you could go on national TV on worldwide TV 9 o'clock tonight on all the networks even on a Playboy TV and

[01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:35.010]
Look you straight in the camera with that goofy look on his face with a furrowed brow and say I lied to you

[01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:39.490]
All those people who died over there including the ones who are still dying including your sons and daughters

[01:20:39.490 --> 01:20:43.670]
It was all for an off and based on a lie. We had this planned long time ago

[01:20:43.670 --> 01:20:49.050]
Me all my neocon pals and it wasn't I was still tomorrow was still be 14% right

[01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:54.170]
So it ties right in with what we were saying about little bit stupidity

[01:20:54.850 --> 01:21:01.510]
Just like the Arnold business always Arnold Schwarzenegg is going to be governor of California maybe based on what?

[01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:07.150]
And then of course this debate is going to participate in you'll notice that of course it's going to be a little bit on time

[01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:10.170]
We were the auction coming up March 4th probably now unless they change that

[01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:13.010]
Must they overturn a court's decision

[01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:18.490]
But the fact of the matter is that they they have to have the questions and writing so they can make the answers up for him

[01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:23.030]
ahead of time because he doesn't have any answers. He doesn't have any positions. He doesn't have any qualifications

[01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:25.770]
But he'd rather pump than come

[01:21:25.770 --> 01:21:29.650]
Work time is not such a bad idea pumping them coming in California

[01:21:30.710 --> 01:21:31.910]
Whatever the hell that means

[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:36.530]

[01:22:23.290 --> 01:22:23.930]

I know but all the liquid moves, you know this morning on TV you had like there's eight to ten foot

[01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:19.470]
And six to eight foot seas and uh like I'm a lifeguard on Hollywood beach and the water here is just really flat

[01:23:19.470 --> 01:23:23.350]
There's a little bit of a a kind of running north to south for it's a beautiful base

[01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.370]
I hope that the people just come on out and come on down the beach and enjoy

[01:23:28.230 --> 01:23:34.270]
Okay, you know, and uh, and also teddy bears develop on your part that man that did so much for national parts

[01:23:34.270 --> 01:23:38.010]
Imagine imagine what would happen if we didn't have them do that for us

[01:23:38.010 --> 01:23:39.770]
I can't even begin to imagine it you know what

[01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:43.470]
Not think about that you know the Indians probably felt the same way about it. Yeah

[01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:49.050]
All right, anyway, thank you Neil God bless for now. I have a great day. You enjoy Hollywood chamber commerce. Thanks you profusely

[01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:53.050]
All right, you're welcome Neil. Good for you. I think you know, I'm not thinking yesterday the Hollywood chamber commerce

[01:23:53.050 --> 01:23:56.750]
Well, he's putting in a good plug. You know, we want to see some naked people out there in the beach damn straight

[01:23:57.730 --> 01:23:59.350]
Well, some of them and maybe some of them not

[01:23:59.830 --> 01:24:06.150]
By who's your favorite dead political figure? We have no interest in this pool. And that's okay because uh Eric said say I told Eric was

[01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:09.950]
Dicking with the show see that's a Eric emailed me to say that he got a whole bunch of suggestions

[01:24:09.950 --> 01:24:11.130]
I last night on the pool

[01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:16.150]
Because he put it on there for people to be able to put in their studio, which I put Bobby Kenvy on there by the way

[01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:18.370]
Eric I was the one and you put one into right

[01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:22.410]
So that's but but anyway by doing that see that would have been about 30 calls

[01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:25.110]
We would have had from people suggesting as opposed to like doing it on the website

[01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:30.630]
So he's dickin with a program here while making it nice and easy for now Eric so don't interfere, okay?

[01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:34.750]
Like Mama Kolioni said to Santino don't interfere

[01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:40.090]
Remember that when we were having dinner at the table and he was given the lecture to a carlo about don't ever do that right

[01:24:41.010 --> 01:24:42.150]
Santino don't interfere

[01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:47.470]
She knew that that the hot tempered Santino man. They shot him on the causeway

[01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:49.550]
Yeah

[01:24:51.230 --> 01:24:52.310]
Done Koli home

[01:24:52.970 --> 01:24:57.550]
And anyway, let's just play the audio from the godfather the rest of the three years. I said that sounds good to me

[01:24:57.550 --> 01:25:00.970]
Huh, we're just gonna play godfather drop-ins

[01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:06.430]
It's not only

[01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:11.050]
That's what your brain is doing, so I know I'm with you straight up

[01:25:11.050 --> 01:25:13.490]
You broke my heart

[01:25:13.490 --> 01:25:14.750]
You broke my heart

[01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:16.050]
It leaves it good

[01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:19.250]
Take a look at all this see this is what pisses old

[01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:21.330]
Seenow Mo off real big time

[01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:25.570]
And he knows that he knows in a part of his brain what used to be it was under the a muskrat there the weasel

[01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:28.990]
He knows that I could actually play godfather drops her next to three years

[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:33.350]
What's ever left on his deal and still get the gigantic numbers over what he is pathetic good

[01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:39.170]
That's what every school man. This is what really has got to frost his saddle there. I don't care how many day go

[01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:43.610]
You know what grease ball come boys come out of the wood one see and you could play the same drop-ins mole

[01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:46.370]
But the difference would be nobody would listen when you play it. That's the bottom

[01:25:55.570 --> 01:25:56.690]
There you go

[01:25:57.570 --> 01:25:59.130]
Nice mentally from the godfather

[01:25:59.930 --> 01:26:06.450]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 your favorite dead political figure the list we have so far Paul wellstone Thomas pain

[01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:10.350]
George Washington Bobby Kennedy Abe Lincoln Abe Lincoln

[01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:17.430]
Teddy Roosevelt FDR Thomas Jefferson Martin Luther King and JFK that's the list we have so far to which you folks have edited one

[01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:24.590]
I mean see if we had a really cerebral audience they'd be saying well James Madison because he was really uh huh keep drilling

[01:26:25.210 --> 01:26:28.310]
What cerebral audience? How about John Quincy Adams?

[01:26:28.310 --> 01:26:31.610]
How about it like to show how about James Knox poke

[01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:35.290]
You poke he was kind of poke say I like any I do believe

[01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:42.370]
And he liked his poke a pick it a poke no he liked his poke oh maybe that was Franklin pierce who they said like this

[01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:47.590]
But was a Franklin pierce or James Buchanan who was never married and we're always rumors about that that we had a close-out

[01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:53.430]
Before my time it was one of them it was either 14 which was Franklin pierce or 15 James you have I think was Franklin pierce

[01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:56.670]
And there were stories there were rumors being spread

[01:26:57.770 --> 01:27:03.570]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[01:27:03.570 --> 01:27:08.150]
Neil God yes sir by the way it was James Buchanan it was the a Mary President

[01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:13.230]
Really that was why I said I would knew was either him or Franklin pierce right hey um you know

[01:27:13.230 --> 01:27:18.350]
Did you ever get a chance to read uh the David Halper stamp book or in a time of peace no

[01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:22.750]
Yeah, that's the book that really details a lot of what went on in in the coastal battle

[01:27:23.130 --> 01:27:28.510]
And I think it gives a real good balance and and a objective view of of Clark's role in that battle

[01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:34.310]
The the editorial that you read from the nation. I think gives kind of the one-sided view of some of the

[01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:37.150]
The press manipulation that was going on during that war night

[01:27:37.150 --> 01:27:38.790]
And I think it's fair to say that Clark

[01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:43.150]
Was going to play the press to get to bring attention to a lot of the

[01:27:43.150 --> 01:27:46.470]
To a lot of the bad things that were going on in the cost world the press was not paying attention

[01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:51.290]
Okay, so a lot of the atrocities came out. I mean, I'm not saying he's perfect by any means and I'm not saying that

[01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:56.710]
I'm even no, I'm not saying that I necessarily believe but somebody fasted to me the day in the nation obviously is a credible publication

[01:27:56.710 --> 01:28:01.670]
And I want to really because I want to put all the stuff out there and then people can pick and choose and believe what they want

[01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:06.430]
Right and and when I'm saying was the Halper stamp book is is basically I think it presents a

[01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:10.090]
It presents a very balanced set in the present the words and all to be honest with you

[01:28:10.090 --> 01:28:15.350]
I highly recommend it. Okay, um and and also for the uh for the poll for the dead politicians

[01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:21.190]
Uh, I think I'd like to nominate the person that ran the the country during the 1980s

[01:28:21.750 --> 01:28:24.110]
Nancy Reagan's astrologer. She is dead by the way

[01:28:26.010 --> 01:28:27.350]
And have a great day

[01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:29.950]
And Nancy's astrologer that was excellent

[01:28:30.610 --> 01:28:33.130]
I beg your pardon. I said that's good news and that was a great call

[01:28:33.470 --> 01:28:36.170]
That was a great call. We're not put that on there of course because we don't know what the name was

[01:28:36.170 --> 01:28:41.470]
Nobody we know who there's anyway just like they don't know where the goddamn Indian Ocean is or where India's or Sri Lanka is

[01:28:42.530 --> 01:28:45.730]
I always like to say line, you know when I was collecting stamps

[01:28:46.330 --> 01:28:49.970]
See that's a problem. I thought I was learning something about the world that they went and changed how they changed

[01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:54.330]
In terms of all the damn countries piss me off me. What that was in Bobway, you know what what is that?

I think we put our finger on it today the problem with america if there is one of course

[01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:26.630]
There might not be but I think it might we might have found it too many trailer parks

[01:32:26.630 --> 01:32:27.350]
Okay

[01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:31.650]
From 04560 WQM and of course some of them might get blown away

[01:32:31.650 --> 01:32:36.130]
What if Brian Cabell from CNN he's standing there like just the wind is blowing you know nothing's gonna happen

[01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:40.430]
I'll tomorrow morning but he's standing there like getting his hair blown all around you know just waiting for the big blow

[01:32:43.670 --> 01:32:46.490]
Our lot of guys standing around waiting for the big blow

[01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:47.130]
Sure, sure

[01:32:47.830 --> 01:32:50.490]
Blitz says Iraq probably destroyed WMDs

[01:32:51.290 --> 01:32:54.210]
Former UN weapons chief weapons inspector Hans Blitz

[01:32:54.210 --> 01:32:57.710]
Belief that Iraq destroyed most of its weapons of mass destruction 10 years ago

[01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:03.750]
But kept up the appearance that it had them to the tour military attack and interview with the australian radio station broadcast today

[01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:07.930]
Blitz said it was unlikely that the US and British teams now searching for weapons in Iraq would find

[01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:09.950]
More than some documents of interest

[01:33:10.490 --> 01:33:12.410]
Interest as I used to say interest

[01:33:13.050 --> 01:33:19.290]
I'm certainly more and more of the conclusion that Iraq has as they maintain destroyed all almost of what they had in the summer of 91

[01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:21.810]
Blitz told australian broadcast in corp radio

[01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:25.490]
The more time that has passed tomorrow I think it's unlikely that anything will be found

[01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:26.050]
He be saying

[01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:30.330]
Looks indicated he thought the west led coalition had backtracked on the issue of Iraq's weapons

[01:33:30.850 --> 01:33:34.970]
In the beginning they talked about weapons concretely and later on they talked about weapons programs

[01:33:34.970 --> 01:33:40.310]
Maybe they'll find some documents of interest. He said is that like persons of interest like Steven Hadfield

[01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:44.570]
We got persons of interest and now we got documents of interest

[01:33:45.330 --> 01:33:49.810]
I mean you can put a sign up on your door beware of the dog without having a dog you said from his home in Sweden

And by the way, it's a good thing we don't have Josh Friedman on our staff anymore to go bother Joe bowman for more promos

[01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:26.950]
He's at the embarrassment level

[01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:29.090]
It's so great. It's just uh

[01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:34.150]
This is your ball and the voice of the Toronto may believe they don't come any better than Neil Roger. Thanks, Joe

[01:34:35.210 --> 01:34:39.190]
Once upon a time tox box orifice my good buddy Johnny Depp

[01:34:39.190 --> 01:34:42.410]
I mean everybody also in the station no drops names all the time

[01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:47.110]
What else should I if I have to hear one more times for well telling us about how he was with mad dog at that

[01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:51.810]
Dolphin kickoff lunge whatever the thing was yesterday. How many times did he say that this morning?

[01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:56.110]
Man, I love you Scott, but just uh cool a little bit with that I

[01:34:56.110 --> 01:35:00.070]
I I I I I I I I I I you know what I'm saying what he's saying. I'm saying that he says that maybe

[01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:05.990]
Right you beat me about a half a half a beat

[01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:11.310]
What's this important thing coming over from chronic Jane

[01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:14.450]
She says I liked how her dean but now I want Wesley Clark

[01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:18.410]
He was first in his class at Westpoint. He was a Rhodes scholar like Bill Clinton

[01:35:18.410 --> 01:35:21.650]
And he was a professor of economics at Westpoint. He knows how to handle the military

[01:35:21.650 --> 01:35:25.350]
I think a Clark Dean ticket will be ideal or Clark Graham ticket

[01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:30.170]
But you know Graham's unheard of right love percentage, but he has a snowball's chance to know you're right about that Jane

[01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:35.730]
Please check out WW Miss leader.org. They're documenting Bush's lies somebody else facts that already

[01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:40.550]
I'll let's check it out like that one. I checked out yesterday was good to read that one about what was it

[01:35:41.290 --> 01:35:42.990]
What was it? I don't know

[01:35:42.990 --> 01:35:46.350]
Some were the anti-religious but there was nothing there we could use but it was good

[01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:48.270]
It was all the anti

[01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.690]
babbling crap

[01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:56.570]
Anyway, it says there's a channel on satellite TV a call link that has some really interesting shows about the world and is nonprofit

[01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:58.590]
Link that or

[01:36:00.010 --> 01:36:02.570]
Says jena for lord of chronic Jane. Thank you chronic Jane

[01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:06.910]
Anyway, can I get back to Johnny depth important thing good you would nobody cares about the fact that we have a bunch of

[01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:12.430]
Functionally literates who have no idea what any see this is the thing about americans because education system is such crap

[01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:14.930]
Americans because of the geographical isolation

[01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:19.570]
Think they can be comfortably ignorant they know nothing about the rest of the world unlike almost any place else

[01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:22.910]
Where they're very familiar with the rest of the world generally because most of the already place else

[01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.570]
They're close to the rest of the world comfortably dumb although the Canadians here

[01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:31.290]
I don't know why they know so much about the rest of the world because the only thing they're close to is like the north pole in the US

[01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:36.210]
And yet the education system here is heads and shoulders heads and shoulders above the USA

[01:36:37.470 --> 01:36:38.390]
How do you like that

[01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.850]
Ha ha

[01:36:40.410 --> 01:36:45.330]
Johnny depth has made another transformation it says oddball acted to box office money maker

[01:36:45.790 --> 01:36:49.990]
The star known for playing eccentric and cult favorite such as Ed Wood which is so much

[01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:56.910]
Too long and fear unloading in Las Vegas is establishing himself as a major box office draw with two films this weekend at the top five

[01:36:57.350 --> 01:37:02.850]
Once upon a time in Mexico as opposed to once upon a time in America which lasts for about seven and a half hours

[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:06.070]
What's upon a time in Mexico staring Antonio Banderas is a

[01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:12.130]
Marriachi musician gunslinger and depth is a sleazy c.i. agent debuted in first place with

[01:37:12.130 --> 01:37:14.410]
$24 million of Quinn industry estimates on Sunday

[01:37:14.410 --> 01:37:20.730]
It was Johnny's second consecutive number one debut after the summertime hit pirates of the Caribbean the curse of the black pearl

[01:37:20.730 --> 01:37:23.110]
Which George said the movie suck but Johnny was good right

[01:37:24.230 --> 01:37:28.550]
Pirates still performing strong in its 10th week of release came in number five at 4.6 million

[01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:33.650]
So in other words Johnny depth is in two of the top five money making films of the week

[01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:36.370]
Number one and number five in the same weekend

[01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:41.890]
It says for any actor that's great and for Johnny depth. It's totally unexpected and welcome

[01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:48.450]
Depas had blockbusters before such as sleepy hollow chocolate and modest hits like Edward Siserhands and Donnie Brasco

[01:37:48.450 --> 01:37:52.510]
But they've been few and far between the respected but little seen cult films like Dead Man

[01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:58.170]
Ed Wood, Benny and June and fear unloading in Las Vegas. I forgot that you say you ever finally saw Donnie Brasco

[01:37:58.170 --> 01:38:02.910]
All right, Johnny Brasco is great. You can be you shouldn't me man. That's a outstanding flick

[01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:08.130]
We need to start talking about movies again. I know I missed that you want to know the reason being that I

[01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.730]
It inspired me to watch so many good ones and now that we don't talk about it

[01:38:11.730 --> 01:38:16.010]
I've got about a half dozen year other room. I haven't watched yet well get to it

[01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:21.770]
I haven't watched a snatch oh such is good. I'll wait and the movie too. Yeah

[01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:26.890]
Oh, and you which reminds me now maybe this is the hour when I can actually put some audio on here in the background

[01:38:26.890 --> 01:38:27.870]
You think maybe

[01:38:29.610 --> 01:38:31.230]
Oh, now what I just saw

[01:38:31.230 --> 01:38:34.870]
Whoa if you could have seen what I just saw huh that's got that instrument that's it

[01:38:35.470 --> 01:38:37.350]
Man no you haven't seen that

[01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:40.870]
All right listen to it. This is the last one

[01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:41.990]
Listen to the watch though

[01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:45.870]
There was her name whatever it was

[01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:53.030]
Chrissy Chrissy don't just because it ended in SSY. Yeah, don't get all bent out of shape. Okay. Okay. Pressy about it

[01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:57.430]
Don't get Chrissy and don't be a sissy. Okay. It was just the Chrissy and she was just having a little fun

[01:39:01.150 --> 01:39:07.490]
I just don't dare you know we have the dump now. What was the movie with the uh the spit girl that with Johnny Depp?

[01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:08.970]
Oh, that was crybaby

[01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:11.890]
Because it's so embarrassing

[01:39:13.270 --> 01:39:13.630]
Bearest

[01:39:13.630 --> 01:39:18.590]
Yeah, so anyway Johnny Depp our Hall and Dale or Miramar were the hell was boy who used to once a part of time

[01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:22.070]
He was out on his luck down on his luck slept in his car actually at one point

[01:39:22.530 --> 01:39:25.170]
Many many moons ago and always a big star

[01:39:26.970 --> 01:39:30.610]
This is a great story. This is from the a fudge report miss fudge had this on there this morning

[01:39:31.050 --> 01:39:34.610]
Oh Mac washney. You know where that is more or less you do

[01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:38.650]
I might have been there. I never heard of it. Well, I never been in Washington state

[01:39:38.650 --> 01:39:39.970]
So I don't know what that is anyway

[01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:45.750]
O'Connagong County Sheriff's Deputy seeking a person on an outstanding warrant broke down the door into the wrong home

[01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:48.630]
And then jolted a man with a taser in front of his wife and child

[01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:53.710]
Oh, it sounds like a stop floor to think done oh yeah, it happens there all the time

[01:39:54.230 --> 01:39:58.110]
Sheriff Frank Rogers says the bottom line is officers messed up is what he said

[01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:03.550]
No one was seriously injured in the incident the heavily armed officers apparently burst into the wrong trailer at the

[01:40:03.550 --> 01:40:07.070]
Homestead trailer park at O'Mac that's not homestead or it's homestead washroom

[01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:12.990]
The man they were seeking 30-year-old Joseph M. Peresian heard the ruckus and tried to escape from another trailer

[01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:15.470]
He was arrested without incident. He heard the ruckus

[01:40:16.050 --> 01:40:19.890]
Don't you love that word the ruckus we get right in with trailer parks and stuff like that

[01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:24.190]
We're not knocking anybody out there lives in a trailer park just because they call you trailer trash

[01:40:24.190 --> 01:40:26.510]
Don't take it personal although I think they might have a point

[01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:29.850]
And who let me ask you this who picks up the trailer trash

[01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:34.830]
The trash people probably the promoter the promotion department for Jerry Springer. I would think

[01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:39.910]
Pick up the trailer trash hollum right off to the Chicago. We're gonna. He'll shoot that show

[01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:46.310]

Listen to particular areas. He drank water out of a quick

[01:40:53.850 --> 01:40:59.970]
To move very fast who didn't this was so important to do the pre-planning which were by the way how they how are they doing?

[01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:05.810]
I didn't I don't want to change the subject, but how are they doing an investigation about the uh, I can't fight it now about the

[01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:10.410]
Amtrak. Yeah, we got some of the intraspex in there. I'm almost hit the wrong one. Oh, don't do that

[01:41:12.170 --> 01:41:13.550]

[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:24.050]
in an interview with CNN's American Morning on Wednesday morning today, this morning.

[01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:26.930]
I've had a lot of diplomatic experience.

[01:46:27.070 --> 01:46:28.490]
I've had a lot of work with security policy.

[01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:31.670]
I think I'm the best person to look at the future of this country and keep us safe.

[01:46:34.490 --> 01:46:39.830]
Park 58 becomes the 10th Democrat, seeking to once he president Bush, his West Point graduate, road scholar,

[01:46:40.190 --> 01:46:44.250]
former CNN, CNN, CNN told it wasn't the, I was wrong, we'll see it in in, that's why everybody saw him.

[01:46:45.130 --> 01:46:49.770]
Former CNN military analyst who led US and allied forces in NATO's 1999 air war in Kosovo

[01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:52.010]
asked about the fact that he never held elective office.

[01:46:52.030 --> 01:46:55.890]
He said his move is ambitious, but it also is an extraordinary era.

[01:46:57.150 --> 01:47:01.430]
Questioned about how he can market himself in his campaign without a record on domestic issues Clark said on Wednesday,

[01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:06.070]
that he has the same experience that everybody else does when it comes to grappling with the issue as a citizen.

[01:47:06.610 --> 01:47:10.910]
He said he worries about health care, education, unemployment, other life issues as voters do.

[01:47:11.250 --> 01:47:17.670]
He said when he was in the military, he dealt with quality of life and personnel issues, such as housing education and health care for our people is what he said.

[01:47:19.290 --> 01:47:24.210]
Responding to comments that he was abrasive and not well liked by others in the military, Clark said the environment was competitive.

[01:47:24.810 --> 01:47:29.030]
It's a competitive bureaucracy he said, people enter it at the bottom, they come out at the top.

[01:47:29.850 --> 01:47:33.650]
There's a lot of gossip and some sharp elbows in there, but I think my record stands on its own mirrors.

[01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:37.450]
And if you look at what I've done, the contributions that I've made, it's a very solid record and I'm proud of what he said.

[01:47:38.150 --> 01:47:39.930]
And you'll notice the Arkansas connection here.

[01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.850]
Is there?

[01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:48.990]
In the fact that Bubba and Hillary and the other Clinton connections are people who are now his advisors and Bubba supposedly pulling some strings behind the scenes, you notice?

[01:47:49.170 --> 01:47:49.370]
Uh-huh.

[01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:49.930]
There you go.

[01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:56.370]
So far, Wesley Clark, who would you like to see as domestic as Democratic presidential candidate next year?

[01:47:56.830 --> 01:48:00.050]
Wesley Clark leading the pack by a good margin, 212 Howard D85.

[01:48:00.810 --> 01:48:01.930]
I don't care they all suck 80.

[01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:11.750]
I don't care I'm voting for Bush 59 13% for Bush idiots Bob Graham 57 John Kerry 16 John Edwards 13 L sharp in 13.

[01:48:12.050 --> 01:48:14.570]
Benis Cassettan 6 if he had a better her PC do better.

[01:48:15.050 --> 01:48:17.390]
Dick Gebhard only 6 in this audience like Dick.

[01:48:17.890 --> 01:48:21.310]
Julie Berman for and Carol Mosley bronze got a pair of right.

[01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:24.610]
She's doubled her vote out of 453 votes.

[01:48:24.610 --> 01:48:25.690]
It's not too a good Carol.

[01:48:26.190 --> 01:48:27.330]
Step it up a little bit.

[01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:31.570]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the ATT.

[01:48:31.570 --> 01:48:36.070]
We got 8 million open lines are poll here about the favorite dead political figure is dead in the water.

[01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:36.450]
Absolutely.

[01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:37.450]
It just ain't going nowhere.

[01:48:39.050 --> 01:48:39.950]
Aren't you amazed?

[01:48:40.550 --> 01:48:40.650]
No.

[01:48:41.250 --> 01:48:43.130]
Oh, here's my any hello.

[01:48:44.550 --> 01:48:44.910]
Okay.

[01:48:45.190 --> 01:48:45.550]
Thank you.

[01:48:45.670 --> 01:48:46.490]
You're listening by the way.

[01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:48.050]
Thanks for listening asshole.

[01:48:49.170 --> 01:48:50.190]
Okay, here's our last call.

[01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:51.050]
It's in for Lauderdale.

[01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:51.310]
Hello.

[01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:52.970]
Hey, I'm from the early great show.

[01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.910]
Yes it is.

[01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:55.550]
I've got a question for you.

[01:48:55.610 --> 01:48:56.290]
Take your time man.

[01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:57.310]
You're the only calling aboard.

[01:48:57.870 --> 01:48:58.150]
All right.

[01:48:59.390 --> 01:49:00.570]
The clock's on the radio.

[01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:02.790]
Was he the one back?

[01:49:03.130 --> 01:49:04.810]
I mean, I think I was in fifth grade at the time.

[01:49:04.930 --> 01:49:08.390]
It was pulled off a Y100 for some kind of altercation.

[01:49:08.570 --> 01:49:11.270]
I don't know if it was child molestation or something.

[01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:13.310]
No, he didn't have any child molestation thing.

[01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:15.550]
You're confusing him with the Bill Tanner right there.

[01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.850]
It's not seriously.

[01:49:17.050 --> 01:49:21.290]
Wasn't somebody from Y100 yanked off the air for some kind of...

[01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.530]
What?

[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:23.790]
Bill Tanner wasn't yanked off the air either.

[01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:24.490]
So I don't know.

[01:49:24.710 --> 01:49:25.350]
But he was yanked off.

[01:49:25.570 --> 01:49:26.670]
He was yanked off though.

[01:49:27.150 --> 01:49:27.770]
All right, I'll tell you.

[01:49:28.050 --> 01:49:28.370]
My bad.

[01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.910]
Great show.

[01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:29.850]
Okay, thanks.

[01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.970]
He's got Tanner and Comix up with Comix.

[01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:35.110]
5, 6, 7, 05, 6.

[01:49:35.210 --> 01:49:36.170]
I guess it wouldn't be the first time.

[01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:39.390]
I'm pound 5, 6, 8, 8, and 10 for Rise of the World of Slime.

[01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:42.310]
All of a sudden, things have been going too well.

[01:49:42.570 --> 01:49:42.810]
You know what?

[01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:46.010]
And you just hit the nail on the head when you said there's still nobody there and you're right.

[01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:47.850]
But things have been going a little bit too smoothly.

[01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:50.610]
Now all of a sudden, it's like, well, we don't like that pole today.

[01:49:50.730 --> 01:49:52.650]
That the second one there's up to you, okay?

[01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.950]
Well, back to you.

[01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.570]
How do you like that?

[01:49:55.570 --> 01:49:58.530]
They don't like the fact that I thought that Mike in whatever his name was.

[01:49:59.070 --> 01:50:01.370]
Coconut Creek yesterday gave us a damn good idea.

[01:50:02.770 --> 01:50:03.250]
It is good.

[01:50:03.250 --> 01:50:07.850]
We're going to do like a four part series, your favorite dead actors, your favorite dead musicians, famous others.

[01:50:08.170 --> 01:50:10.770]
But the politician thing, well, maybe they just aren't that many.

[01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:12.470]
Or maybe we don't have a students in history in here.

[01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:14.110]
You think that could possibly be a part of it?

[01:50:14.150 --> 01:50:17.170]
Who have no idea where the Pacific Ocean is, or the North Pole or the South Pole,

[01:50:18.250 --> 01:50:20.250]
or the Sky or Uranus or the Beach?

[01:50:21.490 --> 01:50:22.910]
They know where the beach is.

[01:50:24.970 --> 01:50:26.630]
Didn't you hear the guy just called two calls ago?

[01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:27.090]
Oh, yeah.

[01:50:27.210 --> 01:50:28.550]
So the beach is on the year right now.

[01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:29.570]
Mr. O'Beech.

[01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:31.450]
Here's a call from Kendall.

[01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.830]
Hello.

[01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.930]
Good afternoon.

[01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:34.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:50:34.610 --> 01:50:38.710]
I was flipping through the station yesterday and I heard you mentioned my name again.

[01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:41.170]
Yeah, Reverend Jones, that's what we said.

[01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:42.330]
Reverend Jones made your ass off.

[01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:44.450]
You know something of the moment that he said hello.

[01:50:44.590 --> 01:50:44.890]
Good afternoon.

[01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:45.190]

[01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:45.590]
It was him.

[01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:46.930]
I'm getting a lot better on that.

[01:50:48.210 --> 01:50:50.130]
Yeah, we don't want, we can't stand you, Reverend Jones.

[01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:50.770]
Go to hell away.

[01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:51.030]
Okay.

[01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:52.290]
You make a sick to our stomach.

[01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:53.730]
You make us want to go to the beach.

[01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:55.510]
And everybody now knows your gay.

[01:50:55.730 --> 01:50:55.870]
Yeah.

[01:50:56.050 --> 01:50:56.850]
Say his name one more time.

[01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:57.470]
He'll pop off.

[01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:58.810]
He'll pop off.

[01:50:58.950 --> 01:50:59.310]
Oh, okay.

[01:50:59.410 --> 01:50:59.790]
Reverend Jones.

[01:50:59.790 --> 01:51:00.150]
Good work.

[01:51:00.610 --> 01:51:00.710]
Okay.

[01:51:00.870 --> 01:51:01.390]
That's a cure.

[01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:02.330]
He'll be calm now.

[01:51:03.370 --> 01:51:06.730]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

And for Rise of Marlowe's line, Mad Dog coming up to the Humper from 4 to 6, 30.

[01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:12.030]

[01:51:13.110 --> 01:51:13.950]
What a deal.

[01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:14.670]

Marlon's at the Phillies to try to like undo.

Then you got any camp to the baseball game.

[01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:34.490]
Joe and Mark overnight and then the Muscrat man, the old Weasel in a morning with the guilty.

[01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:38.130]
You know, is it the Muscrat with the Weasel?

[01:51:38.250 --> 01:51:39.250]

[01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:12.990]
Come to the thing you might get yourself a baby, sit around and go to one movie and stand.

[01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:15.450]
How pretty, two and five sixty WQIM.

[01:54:15.810 --> 01:54:19.870]
So we had 160 bucks as a last report out there at the corner of University in Broward,

[01:54:19.930 --> 01:54:21.810]
Bolvard at the Shell Station McGill and the QM van.

[01:54:22.090 --> 01:54:22.230]
Right.

[01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:23.210]
But our best meal merchandise.

[01:54:23.470 --> 01:54:24.030]
We got an update.

[01:54:24.250 --> 01:54:24.590]
Not yet.

[01:54:25.110 --> 01:54:26.590]
Oh, having heard you though.

[01:54:27.090 --> 01:54:28.890]
Yes, I'm sure he'll be calling within seconds.

[01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:31.650]
I sure hope so because this thing is just creeping and crawling.

[01:54:31.870 --> 01:54:32.530]
I have no updates.

[01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:36.030]
I mean, the number I got here, the $1 figure is from like four days ago.

[01:54:36.190 --> 01:54:36.990]
It's just, I don't know.

[01:54:37.530 --> 01:54:40.470]
I just have the feeling of this is kind of like a schlock, you know?

[01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:42.150]
The whole way that this thing is going?

[01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:44.530]
No.

[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:46.250]
You don't think so?

[01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:47.210]
I don't have that feeling.

[01:54:47.410 --> 01:54:47.750]
It's smooth.

[01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:51.230]
I have the feeling that things are going like a little on the schlocky side.

[01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:52.270]
That's just my own personal.

[01:54:52.550 --> 01:54:52.990]
I could be overreacting.

[01:54:53.690 --> 01:54:53.970]
You know me.

[01:54:54.090 --> 01:54:55.210]
I'm a basketball player.

[01:54:56.190 --> 01:54:56.830]
But nevermind.

[01:54:57.570 --> 01:54:58.150]
Yeah, that's me.

[01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:00.610]
Here's a chronic factor.

[01:55:00.730 --> 01:55:02.790]
That's how it's signed chronic and a very chronic handwriting.

[01:55:02.910 --> 01:55:04.570]
It's just talking about the UM broadcast group.

[01:55:04.570 --> 01:55:05.530]
It brings me to the beast.

[01:55:05.970 --> 01:55:08.290]
Listening to Forell show this morning, the beast is got awful.

[01:55:08.770 --> 01:55:09.410]
Well, we know that.

[01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:11.230]
He's so not like Forell.

[01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:12.930]
And he tries to be hip and nutty like Forell.

[01:55:13.210 --> 01:55:16.810]
The beast is fine as a reporter and even on the sideline gig for UM while I would debate that.

[01:55:16.930 --> 01:55:19.710]
But please get him off here as a host or even a co-host.

[01:55:19.870 --> 01:55:21.810]
Well, he's so not like Forell.

[01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:23.530]
And he tries to be hip and nutty like Forell.

[01:55:23.770 --> 01:55:27.410]
The beast is fine as a reporter and even on the sideline gig for UM while I would debate that.

[01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:30.290]
But please get him off here as a host or even a co-host.

[01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:32.070]
Well, I have no problem with any of that.

[01:55:32.770 --> 01:55:34.070]
Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale.

[01:55:34.230 --> 01:55:34.370]
Hello.

[01:55:35.450 --> 01:55:36.370]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:55:36.490 --> 01:55:40.490]
I was just calling because a gentleman earlier who was talking about Cox.

[01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.470]
Ever?

[01:55:42.110 --> 01:55:42.690]
But anyway.

[01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:48.230]
The other thing I wanted to just ask is on your dead politician's poll, is Barbara Jordan on there yet?

[01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:49.670]
No, but she is now.

[01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:50.390]
That's a good choice.

[01:55:50.690 --> 01:55:51.770]
I was thinking that myself.

[01:55:52.490 --> 01:55:52.850]
Excellent.

[01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:53.350]
Thank you.

[01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:53.550]
All right.

[01:55:53.650 --> 01:55:53.930]
Thank you.

[01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.770]
Have a great day.

[01:55:54.990 --> 01:55:55.070]
Bye.

[01:55:56.110 --> 01:55:56.810]
Barbara Jordan.

[01:55:57.010 --> 01:55:58.470]
Well, what a great choice that is.

[01:55:58.610 --> 01:55:58.830]
Sure.

[01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:59.230]
Barbara Jordan.

[01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:00.810]
Okay.

[01:56:00.970 --> 01:56:01.550]
We got that on there.

[01:56:01.710 --> 01:56:06.470]
We get, well, we're not going to get too many other ones, but how can you compete with like all these other ones like Tyne's here for some of the FDR?

[01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:09.190]
Some people may actually know who those people were.

[01:56:09.810 --> 01:56:10.550]
Fight all the way down.

[01:56:10.650 --> 01:56:15.490]
At 5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:16.270]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.630]
Hello.

[01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.430]
Hello.

[01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:19.290]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:19.750 --> 01:56:20.430]
I'm in Hollywood.

[01:56:20.970 --> 01:56:21.810]
That's what I just said.

[01:56:21.930 --> 01:56:22.410]
Here's Hollywood.

[01:56:22.570 --> 01:56:22.790]
Hello.

[01:56:23.190 --> 01:56:23.630]
All right.

[01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.710]
Hey, Neil.

[01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:27.230]
Let me tell you how I grandmother asked me about you.

[01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.110]
She thought you were the greatest ever.

[01:56:29.610 --> 01:56:29.770]
Yeah.

[01:56:30.130 --> 01:56:32.990]
Well, she's dead now, but you know, she only told me to listen to you.

[01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.470]
And I never tell you.

[01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:34.670]
I can barely hear this call.

[01:56:34.710 --> 01:56:36.450]
Scott, this guy sounds like he's on your reignis.

[01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:38.910]
Three o'clock in the afternoon, but I listen to you now.

[01:56:39.030 --> 01:56:40.430]
You're, you know, she's, you're right.

[01:56:40.590 --> 01:56:40.910]
She was right.

[01:56:41.050 --> 01:56:41.950]
You know, you're the greatest.

[01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:43.830]
I'm ready for a dry-double fact.

[01:56:44.330 --> 01:56:45.090]
Yeah, I'll come of them.

[01:56:45.450 --> 01:56:46.030]
Okay, thanks.

[01:56:46.810 --> 01:56:49.490]
5.6705.60, pound 5.60 on the AT&T.

[01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:50.990]
I am for a dry-double, prunal, a fact.

[01:56:51.050 --> 01:56:51.470]
I'm pretty good.

[01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:53.650]
And she's not too bad either for a dry-double, the queen.

[01:56:54.650 --> 01:56:55.750]
Let's do a key lago.

[01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:56.010]
Hello.

[01:56:56.490 --> 01:56:57.190]
Hey, Neil.

[01:56:57.330 --> 01:56:57.990]
Yes, sir.

[01:56:58.110 --> 01:56:58.710]
How you doing?

[01:56:59.030 --> 01:57:01.690]
I just want to share one of my memorable Cox moments.

[01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:03.350]
Can I say Cox on the radio?

[01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:04.050]
Yeah, I guess I can.

[01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.710]
Yes.

[01:57:05.630 --> 01:57:11.450]
Back in the Miami Vice era, when he hijacked the radio station and just played

[01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:15.810]
Tlaugler's Loose, I don't know if anybody remembered that.

[01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:17.210]
Four hours is the length of paper.

[01:57:17.690 --> 01:57:18.190]
I'll be there.

[01:57:18.530 --> 01:57:20.590]
Yeah, I can't remember.

[01:57:20.890 --> 01:57:22.590]
Are these callers like drowning underwater?

[01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.750]
They're in and out.

[01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:25.530]
They're in and out and all over the place.

[01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:26.110]
They've been drowning.

[01:57:26.110 --> 01:57:26.310]
They've been drowning.

[01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:30.010]
I don't know what it is, but all of a sudden, not only the volume of the quality has

[01:57:30.010 --> 01:57:31.710]
like degenerated into what I would call...

[01:57:32.190 --> 01:57:32.510]
Crap.

[01:57:32.830 --> 01:57:34.270]
220, I don't know if you heard me the first time.

[01:57:34.730 --> 01:57:35.190]
No, I did not.

[01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:36.450]
Well, that's pretty damn lame.

[01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.950]
220 bucks.

[01:57:38.190 --> 01:57:39.450]
He's been up there for like, uh-huh.

[01:57:39.670 --> 01:57:40.670]
That's the weather, I'm sure.

[01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:41.990]
Oh my god.

[01:57:42.090 --> 01:57:43.050]
We've always got to see what I mean.

[01:57:43.170 --> 01:57:44.150]
We're up against it.

[01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:46.610]
We're like right up against it and we can't even feel it.

[01:57:46.730 --> 01:57:47.530]
What are your 20 bucks?

[01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:51.870]
Who would you like to see as Democratic presidential candidate next year?

[01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:53.190]
The West Lake Park 117.

[01:57:53.470 --> 01:57:55.910]
I don't care they all sucks in second place with 93.

[01:57:57.050 --> 01:57:59.370]
What about a negative sour assholes, man?

[01:58:00.110 --> 01:58:01.070]
Howardine 89.

[01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:04.330]
I don't care I'm from Bush 62, 12.6%.

[01:58:04.330 --> 01:58:06.870]
Bob Graham 62, Tyler Bell President Day.

[01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:09.410]
John Kerry 17, Al Sharpton 16.

[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:12.010]
John Edwards 13, who talks to dead people.

[01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:15.790]
Dennis Quasinich 6, Dick Kebhard 6, Julie Rubin 6,

[01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:18.470]
and Carol Mosley Brown has got three out of 190 votes.

[01:58:18.670 --> 01:58:20.210]
That's the way it stacks up right now.

[01:58:21.370 --> 01:58:24.590]
They like Wesley Clark and they still want to know where's the Pacific Ocean.

[01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:27.390]
Here's Miami.

[01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.670]
Hello.

[01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:29.990]
Hello, this is near.

[01:58:30.730 --> 01:58:31.110]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:31.650 --> 01:58:32.110]
Uh, near.

[01:58:32.410 --> 01:58:33.530]
I don't know what to give my name.

[01:58:33.650 --> 01:58:34.930]
I'm calling from California.

[01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:36.030]
Yes, sure.

[01:58:36.130 --> 01:58:36.770]
Uh, I need to be.

[01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:37.470]
Okay, good.

[01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:37.950]

[01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.350]
5670560.

[01:58:41.770 --> 01:58:45.430]
I told you they ran out of material all of a sudden right at noon when the little hand at the big hand.

[01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.870]
That was it.

[01:58:46.990 --> 01:58:48.910]
That was the time to put on the goddamn leaf scale.

[01:58:48.910 --> 01:58:50.390]
My totally be a hell of a lot more entertaining.

[01:58:51.250 --> 01:58:52.630]
Oh, and you're in a commercial break.

[01:58:54.210 --> 01:58:55.090]
Let's do Miami.

[01:58:55.090 --> 01:58:55.690]
When is this?

[01:58:56.730 --> 01:58:57.210]
Hello.

[01:58:57.450 --> 01:58:58.070]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:58.690 --> 01:59:01.750]
Neil, I just wanted to tell you I'm, I'm 33 years old.

[01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:03.370]
I'm Cuban American born right here.

[01:59:03.590 --> 01:59:08.510]
I fed into that, uh, the involve thing for the last, you know, 10 years of my life.

[01:59:08.590 --> 01:59:09.550]
They're both Republican.

[01:59:09.710 --> 01:59:11.450]
After Bush, I changed to Democrat.

[01:59:11.850 --> 01:59:13.550]
This guy Clark, he excites me.

[01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:16.670]
I think everybody that, uh, that doesn't know the title of this.

[01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:19.290]
They should listen to the guy.

[01:59:19.590 --> 01:59:22.770]
I mean, the guy makes sense on everything he talks about.

[01:59:23.190 --> 01:59:32.450]
I think the fact that he's an outsider will give us some fresh blood into into the old, you know, GOP and the good old boys mentality in there.

[01:59:32.670 --> 01:59:40.570]
And I hope anybody that has, you know, a clear vision can really sit down and really look at the value that this guy has.

[01:59:40.610 --> 01:59:42.030]
Because he's going to be our next president.

[01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:43.250]
You think so, huh?

[01:59:43.710 --> 01:59:44.650]
Definitely, Neil.

[01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:55.270]
You know, how, how many times have you seen a, a military guy, a four-star general, nonetheless, you know, be a Democrat and speak so intelligently about things?

[01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:56.230]
The guy just makes sense.

[01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:58.170]
He makes sense about everything he talks about.

[01:59:58.630 --> 02:00:04.630]
I, I said to my wife a number of times when I see him on CNN as a commentary, as, as, as one of their hosts.

[02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:09.850]
I said, it's only this guy who runs for president and, you know, God was listening.

[02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:11.230]
God was listening.

[02:00:11.230 --> 02:00:13.310]
I think, yeah, God was listening right.

[02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:14.630]
Okay, God, good luck to pal.

[02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:15.470]
Thank you, Neil.

[02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:16.070]
Thank you.

[02:00:16.730 --> 02:00:18.330]
He said, God was listening.

[02:00:18.450 --> 02:00:18.990]
How do you like that?

[02:00:19.050 --> 02:00:22.610]
He sure ain't listening to Pat Robertson because that storm, I think, is going to wipe out Virginia beat.

[02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:23.670]
Already second now.

[02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:26.490]
It just took a little rock and roll there to the right.

[02:00:26.710 --> 02:00:27.130]
Look at that.

[02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:28.530]
Which would allow a person's strengthening.

[02:00:28.950 --> 02:00:29.470]
Yes, see?

[02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:30.910]
Oh, oh, oh.

[02:00:31.470 --> 02:00:34.950]
I think Pat Robertson drew the Lord's attention there and, and maybe he misunderstood.

[02:00:35.370 --> 02:00:37.850]
Okay, maybe God's got like a little hearing problem today.

[02:00:39.750 --> 02:00:40.630]
Like what's your name?

[02:00:40.730 --> 02:00:41.970]
Like Mrs. Wallace on passions?

[02:00:42.010 --> 02:00:43.270]
Maybe his hearing aid fell out?

[02:00:44.230 --> 02:00:48.210]
And he thought Pat Robertson is saying, please, please send that right here to Virginia Beach.

[02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:49.870]
Right over my ass would be good.

[02:00:50.810 --> 02:00:52.250]
That's what he was asking God to do.

[02:00:52.350 --> 02:00:55.410]
And I think God might just fulfill his wish with a big blow.

[02:00:56.690 --> 02:01:00.310]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:01:00.730 --> 02:01:01.830]
And Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:01:02.110 --> 02:01:05.770]
And the best part of the whole deal is that the media continues taking these people seriously

[02:01:05.770 --> 02:01:09.590]
and presenting them like some kind of respectable significant, yeah.

[02:01:10.310 --> 02:01:14.930]
Jerry Fowlball and Jimmy Swagrid and Pat Robertson and all these other grave robbers.

[02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:18.310]
I guess Pat's still a little bit upset about Charles Taylor.

[02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:20.490]
You know, I can't make no more diamond deals in Liberia.

[02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:23.350]
Here's Tamarack.

[02:01:23.490 --> 02:01:23.650]
Hello.

[02:01:26.270 --> 02:01:26.750]
Tamarack.

[02:01:28.430 --> 02:01:30.050]
I think Tamarack floated away.

[02:01:30.370 --> 02:01:31.330]
Let's try Boker.

[02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.590]
Hello.

[02:01:32.010 --> 02:01:32.950]
Media, how are you today?

[02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:33.790]
Pretty good, sir.

[02:01:33.850 --> 02:01:38.750]
I heard, I was in New York on business last week and I heard Sean Hannity's radio show on WABC.

[02:01:39.150 --> 02:01:40.030]
How do you press against?

[02:01:40.330 --> 02:01:43.510]
The biggest right wing A-hole in the history of the world.

[02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:48.570]
He was talking about, he said except for Bill O'Reilly, him and Russ Rimbabwe,

[02:01:48.570 --> 02:01:51.510]
there was no intelligence talk radio in the United States if they should,

[02:01:52.050 --> 02:01:57.370]
that they all are bunch of pinko, democratic, left-wing fanatics.

[02:01:57.630 --> 02:01:58.250]
How do you like that?

[02:01:59.170 --> 02:02:01.490]
And well, why would you waste your time listening to him and ask him like that?

[02:02:02.030 --> 02:02:02.850]
I was flipping.

[02:02:03.050 --> 02:02:04.830]
He said that it was drove off the road.

[02:02:05.250 --> 02:02:08.750]
I mean, is he the biggest fastest you've ever heard?

[02:02:09.450 --> 02:02:10.530]
No, he's not the biggest.

[02:02:10.550 --> 02:02:11.270]
He's what of no.

[02:02:11.730 --> 02:02:12.210]
I would just say.

[02:02:13.050 --> 02:02:13.970]
He's an asshole.

[02:02:14.590 --> 02:02:18.350]
They said he has the best ratings in New York, the band of any radio show.

[02:02:18.570 --> 02:02:19.050]
Well, calm down.

[02:02:19.150 --> 02:02:20.230]
Just be glad you don't live in New York.

[02:02:20.330 --> 02:02:20.890]
Okay, I am.

[02:02:21.630 --> 02:02:24.090]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[02:02:24.190 --> 02:02:26.210]
By the way, speaking of ratings, those trends come out tomorrow, man.

[02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:28.450]
It's going to be, this wrinkled up, dried up, old, fag, man.

[02:02:28.450 --> 02:02:29.230]
We're going to have big numbers.

[02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.910]
I can smell it.

[02:02:30.070 --> 02:02:30.830]
Can you smell it?

[02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:31.570]
Oh, that.

[02:02:31.810 --> 02:02:34.350]
You can always smell a big number from a lot of footer to a way, especially if it's

[02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:35.470]
like in somebody's pants.

[02:02:37.210 --> 02:02:40.510]
During the last break, I want you to know that I went in the other than the magic room,

[02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:41.030]
you know what I did?

[02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:42.310]
I don't want to know.

[02:02:43.670 --> 02:02:45.970]
It's not nothing that you haven't done before.

[02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:47.750]
I wiped my eye.

[02:02:47.930 --> 02:02:49.670]
Oh, my brown eye.

[02:02:49.770 --> 02:02:50.630]
Oh, jeez.

[02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:54.530]
Well, no, I mean, I was thinking I was sitting here during the show thinking Jeepers creepers,

[02:02:54.570 --> 02:02:55.590]
I think I've got some seepers.

[02:02:56.410 --> 02:02:59.310]
Well, no, when you're fat, when you're fat, you're not.

[02:02:59.310 --> 02:02:59.490]
Right.

[02:02:59.850 --> 02:03:00.310]
I know.

[02:03:00.610 --> 02:03:02.950]
Sometimes you seep a little out and you just play the lot.

[02:03:03.030 --> 02:03:03.350]
I don't know.

[02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:04.490]
You just have to go in the smell.

[02:03:04.930 --> 02:03:06.270]
You'll license really clean everything.

[02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:07.510]
No, boy, tell, that's really good for that.

[02:03:07.870 --> 02:03:08.810]
How about some tucks?

[02:03:09.590 --> 02:03:10.690]
Sure, if you don't have a bidet.

[02:03:11.410 --> 02:03:13.310]
I do not have a bidet, but I think it's in the works.

[02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:18.170]
19 to 1 at 5, 60 W. Kim, we got our thank goodness Wednesday, 1 to 2 hour boy.

[02:03:18.230 --> 02:03:20.570]
The timing couldn't possibly be better the way this thing is going today.

[02:03:21.090 --> 02:03:24.170]
You know, it's that time of the year again when the mattress rooms and furniture stores run

[02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:25.470]
their phony ad sales.

[02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:27.130]
Dallama actress will ask you this.

[02:03:27.230 --> 02:03:29.130]
If you double the price, offer half off.

[02:03:29.230 --> 02:03:29.950]
Is that really a deal?

[02:03:30.070 --> 02:03:30.230]
No.

[02:03:30.370 --> 02:03:30.770]
Of course not.

[02:03:31.110 --> 02:03:35.410]
Fact is that those stores have to run a sale of their prices nearly as low as Dallama actress sells them each

[02:03:35.410 --> 02:03:37.450]
in every day, 365 days a year.

[02:03:37.850 --> 02:03:41.270]
For this count, prices on dozens of models from the top names in a bin of cili,

[02:03:41.430 --> 02:03:44.470]
surre, temper, pete, ximines, king coral, orster, and foster,

[02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:47.930]
call 1-800-MACRUS-1-800-MATTRES.

[02:03:48.270 --> 02:03:52.190]
No nonsense, no bait and switch, no house, brands, no falls, promises and best of all,

[02:03:52.530 --> 02:03:54.830]
you don't have to pay a premium for the best service available anywhere.

[02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:59.190]
You get service like you've only dreamed about from the delivery team ranked number one in customer satisfaction.

[02:03:59.510 --> 02:04:03.410]
When you call Dallama actress 1-800-MACRUS, don't forget, you pick the day and time you're delivery

[02:04:03.410 --> 02:04:06.810]
within a two-hour window seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.

[02:04:07.090 --> 02:04:09.510]
and they'll be sleeping like a baby well the first night, whoever it is.

[02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:13.030]
I've been sleeping on a mattress for about a year, you ought to be doing the same thing.

[02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:16.610]
If the old mattress is lumpy, bumpy, worn out if your back is taking a beating,

[02:04:16.970 --> 02:04:18.210]
here's the way to solve the problem.

[02:04:18.470 --> 02:04:21.630]
With low prices, same day delivery, if you set up and remove the loads easy to see why,

[02:04:21.630 --> 02:04:24.670]
Dallama actress is ranked numero uno in customer satisfaction.

[02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:27.730]
So don't be fooled by those mattress storms or furniture stirrads.

[02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:31.590]
They can't come close to matching all the service and deals you get from Dallama actress.

[02:04:31.690 --> 02:04:33.870]
Pick up the phone and call them right now. They'll be knocking on your door.

[02:04:33.970 --> 02:04:35.470]
No time at all once convenient for you.

[02:04:35.950 --> 02:04:40.890]
1-800-MACRUS, 1-800-MATTRES, or online, it's mattress.com.

[02:04:40.890 --> 02:04:46.850]
My, I, and local, here's sports radio 560's, you a.m.

[02:04:48.570 --> 02:04:51.830]
By the way, I've been giving it some thoughts.

[02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:54.170]
Oh, what do you think it is?

[02:04:54.670 --> 02:05:01.290]
I know that me and you can do much better, go in 6 to 10 and not in 5.

[02:05:01.850 --> 02:05:03.630]
Again, Thailand, the cranky too.

[02:05:04.170 --> 02:05:07.550]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[02:05:09.410 --> 02:05:12.930]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[02:05:13.410 --> 02:05:15.210]
You got to have your weary bag.

[02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:16.670]
Strap on to tight.

[02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:18.970]
No chance I'll do a show with you.

[02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:20.550]
I'd rather die.

[02:05:21.010 --> 02:05:22.510]
We'd be crappy together.

[02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:29.990]
Why, I'll have you know that I'm a big puppy too.

[02:05:30.450 --> 02:05:31.790]
From Brooklyn High.

[02:05:33.390 --> 02:05:37.550]
I've been raped by everybody but you.

[02:05:38.050 --> 02:05:39.970]
You're not by time.

[02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:43.110]
Me and Mow, this is that wood blow.

[02:05:43.670 --> 02:05:45.470]
No way that it, we had a fight.

[02:05:46.010 --> 02:05:47.010]
That you'd survive.

[02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:48.990]
Who'd wanna hear a genital.

[02:05:49.890 --> 02:05:50.750]
And push it back.

[02:05:51.310 --> 02:05:52.710]
That's crappy together.

[02:05:52.710 --> 02:05:56.090]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:59.030]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:03.710]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:06:03.710 --> 02:06:04.710]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:06:05.770 --> 02:06:06.710]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:06:08.170 --> 02:06:12.290]
I'm so glad I was born.

[02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:17.470]
And so would you and me for me is much better, 6 to 10 and not in 5.

[02:06:17.950 --> 02:06:21.090]
It's only right that I should get more sleep tonight.

[02:06:21.090 --> 02:06:22.670]
I think we might.

[02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:24.570]
Be happy together.

[02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:28.250]
Happy together.

[02:06:30.150 --> 02:06:31.730]
What's out there, baby?

[02:06:33.970 --> 02:06:35.490]
What's out there?

[02:06:39.210 --> 02:06:40.770]
What's out there?

[02:06:42.110 --> 02:06:43.070]
What's out there?

[02:06:43.670 --> 02:06:44.250]
What's out there?

[02:06:45.490 --> 02:06:46.170]
What's out there?

[02:06:46.170 --> 02:06:46.670]
What's out there?

[02:06:47.450 --> 02:06:47.890]
What's out there?

[02:06:52.890 --> 02:06:53.430]
What's out there?

[02:06:57.230 --> 02:06:58.930]
General Clarks went out to 1 p.m.

[02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.370]
He's running.

[02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:02.950]
I guess it's kind of like anti-climate.

[02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:06.750]
What happened to my audio in here during that break sky?

[02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:08.450]
Was that like your screw up or was that something?

[02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:10.710]
The audio got quiet all of a sudden.

[02:07:11.370 --> 02:07:13.090]
Oh, it's on that end.

[02:07:14.170 --> 02:07:14.390]
Right.

[02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:16.790]
Not another technical problem on that end.

[02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:18.250]
Oh, they crap on you.

[02:07:18.490 --> 02:07:19.830]
Maybe something will happen.

[02:07:20.050 --> 02:07:21.250]
Now you're going to be shocked by this.

[02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.650]
What?

[02:07:22.170 --> 02:07:23.270]
This is going to really please you.

[02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:24.390]
Or like you wouldn't believe.

[02:07:24.530 --> 02:07:25.250]
Before you get into that.

[02:07:25.590 --> 02:07:26.890]
Yes, 340 at the site.

[02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:31.850]
It ain't raining where he is, but it's storming cats and doogs here.

[02:07:32.830 --> 02:07:33.270]
And...

[02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:36.390]
It's sunny and beautiful here right now, but Friday we're getting to the end of the hurricane, yeah?

[02:07:36.410 --> 02:07:40.570]
This room is filling up with the weirdest smell I've smelled in years, and I don't know what it is.

[02:07:42.150 --> 02:07:44.350]
I don't know what it is.

[02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:44.690]
Hey, that...

[02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:48.570]
Hey, God, it's not recognizable as anything I've ever smelled before.

[02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.170]
Hmm.

[02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:50.230]
Mystery smell.

[02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:52.430]
Maybe scurrying's hovering in the hallway.

[02:07:52.750 --> 02:07:53.530]
I've smelled that before.

[02:07:54.010 --> 02:07:55.090]
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

[02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:56.490]
340 bucks.

[02:07:56.490 --> 02:07:57.230]
So what's our total?

[02:07:57.330 --> 02:07:57.990]
Do we have any idea?

[02:07:58.130 --> 02:07:58.690]
I mean this thing...

[02:07:58.690 --> 02:07:59.070]
The gray hole?

[02:07:59.470 --> 02:07:59.790]
Yeah.

[02:08:00.590 --> 02:08:00.990]
No.

[02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:04.530]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:10.330]
Okay, Miguel is at the corner of Brewer Boulevard in the University Drive on a shell-stating in the QM van.

[02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:11.650]
No, down here are hip-boots.

[02:08:11.770 --> 02:08:12.570]
Miguel just called in.

[02:08:12.650 --> 02:08:13.650]
It is raining by him.

[02:08:13.690 --> 02:08:14.970]
He said it's still 340.

[02:08:16.030 --> 02:08:17.330]
So, which is nobody there?

[02:08:18.330 --> 02:08:18.730]
Partly.

[02:08:19.190 --> 02:08:19.790]
I see.

[02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:21.690]
Well, that's pretty damn weak for your best meal merchandise.

[02:08:21.690 --> 02:08:23.790]
I don't think we're going to even make 25 grand this year.

[02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:24.930]
We had like 22 something.

[02:08:25.050 --> 02:08:27.090]
I don't think if we keep going to El Janie we're going to make it.

[02:08:27.570 --> 02:08:27.850]
Sure.

[02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:28.250]
We'll aim.

[02:08:29.310 --> 02:08:34.570]
Anyway, here's some exciting news with the next three Super Bowl's visiting new stadiums in O'Cales, not known as Winter Destinations.

[02:08:35.010 --> 02:08:36.410]
Houston, Jacksonville, and Detroit.

[02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:41.110]
NFL Commissioner Paul Taglia-Boo was hoping to return to it from India Warmer Host City in 2007,

[02:08:41.350 --> 02:08:47.790]
which is why NFL owners are expected to approve bringing football's big game back to pro player stadium when they meet the 7th in the Washington DC.

[02:08:48.390 --> 02:08:48.770]
2007.

[02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:55.970]
The Commissioner said we wanted to go back to some place that was a warm weather site that had the experience of hosting Super Bowls before it's a Jim Steege.

[02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:58.050]
NFL Senior Vice President of Special Events.

[02:08:58.330 --> 02:08:59.590]
So, this afternoon they'll make it formal.

[02:08:59.870 --> 02:09:01.710]
Now, this fact you sent me really porks my ass.

[02:09:03.030 --> 02:09:06.510]
That piece of Schmidt footy made a comment regarding Cox's passing away.

[02:09:06.670 --> 02:09:08.830]
That's disrespectful to talk ill of the dead.

[02:09:09.210 --> 02:09:11.710]
It says F footy and his Schmidt selling barbecue sauce.

[02:09:12.730 --> 02:09:14.130]
Footies got barbecue sauce?

[02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.890]
So, they say.

[02:09:16.250 --> 02:09:17.350]
Oh, see.

[02:09:17.350 --> 02:09:19.350]
I hope he sticks it up his leg.

[02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:20.090]
Oh, God.

[02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:22.270]
That's the secret ingredient.

[02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:24.490]
I'm not going to get upset about it because it's so typical.

[02:09:25.030 --> 02:09:26.470]
Sunset and the league knows it all together.

[02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:29.510]
We got people on here making all kinds of caustic, negative, or comments.

[02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:34.670]
The only people called in here want to know what he got busted for and what kind of negative...

[02:09:34.670 --> 02:09:35.390]
They had to cut soft foot.

[02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:36.410]
Don't blame it on me.

[02:09:37.030 --> 02:09:39.030]
All these years I keep an ony-less, so negative.

[02:09:39.230 --> 02:09:39.850]
I'm not negative.

[02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.910]
The town is negative.

[02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:42.450]
That's all they know is negativity.

[02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:44.850]
They thrive on it on a hostility.

[02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:49.470]
Just like the guy that spent like three minutes there when a big build up about his dead mother-in-law,

[02:09:49.570 --> 02:09:52.350]
whatever the hell it was, and then gives me a saw and answer about some dried-up fag crap.

[02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:53.670]
Very weak by the way.

[02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:55.590]
From now on, do it right off the bat.

[02:09:55.690 --> 02:09:56.370]
Don't waste our time.

[02:09:57.330 --> 02:10:00.230]
Do you want to call in and say, you suck more power to you, but get it out of the way.

[02:10:01.890 --> 02:10:03.350]
Here's a lady in Jupiter.

[02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.690]
Hello.

[02:10:04.650 --> 02:10:04.850]
Hello.

[02:10:05.330 --> 02:10:05.890]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:10:06.330 --> 02:10:07.410]
I'd like to speak to Neil.

[02:10:07.770 --> 02:10:08.090]
Speaking.

[02:10:09.070 --> 02:10:09.390]
Hi.

[02:10:09.490 --> 02:10:09.950]
How are you?

[02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:15.330]
I just moved into up by Jupiter from Miami, and you're absolutely correct.

[02:10:15.530 --> 02:10:17.990]
The crap in Miami is horrendous.

[02:10:18.690 --> 02:10:20.230]
It's so much nicer up here in Jupiter.

[02:10:21.370 --> 02:10:22.810]
That's the middle name in South Florida.

[02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:26.610]
I just wanted to let you know that I think you're great.

[02:10:26.850 --> 02:10:28.530]
I've been listening to you for years.

[02:10:28.810 --> 02:10:30.150]
This is the first time I've called.

[02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:35.290]
And you speak your mind, oh, and Mr. Buds, and I just think you're great.

[02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:36.310]
And I wanted to let you know.

[02:10:36.450 --> 02:10:36.990]
I am great.

[02:10:38.450 --> 02:10:40.930]
I'm also with in reference to George.

[02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.610]
Yes.

[02:10:41.770 --> 02:10:44.930]
You know, he's with all due respect, George.

[02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:46.230]
You're not Neil.

[02:10:46.450 --> 02:10:48.030]
You know, he's like so hard to be.

[02:10:48.030 --> 02:10:48.590]
What a sucker.

[02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.750]
He said, you bitch.

[02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.350]
He said, you bitch.

[02:10:51.050 --> 02:10:51.610]
I'm okay.

[02:10:52.210 --> 02:10:53.010]
Whoever said he was me.

[02:10:53.170 --> 02:10:53.610]
Either you bitch.

[02:10:54.230 --> 02:10:54.630]
Yeah, see that?

[02:10:54.630 --> 02:10:55.550]
He's like this guy.

[02:10:55.650 --> 02:10:58.030]
He's like so hard to be funny, but he's not.

[02:10:58.110 --> 02:10:58.890]
I don't have funny.

[02:10:58.990 --> 02:11:00.130]
He's like hard to be funny, bitch.

[02:11:00.210 --> 02:11:01.010]
He did okay.

[02:11:01.210 --> 02:11:02.150]
What do you work, decent job?

[02:11:03.010 --> 02:11:03.790]
You know, I'm not.

[02:11:05.110 --> 02:11:05.690]
Oh, well.

[02:11:06.210 --> 02:11:06.470]
Yeah.

[02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.510]
Yeah.

[02:11:06.510 --> 02:11:07.490]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:08.170]
Bye-bye.

[02:11:08.590 --> 02:11:09.130]
Bye-bye, bitch.

[02:11:10.250 --> 02:11:11.810]
She's hostile and she moved to Jupiter.

[02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.450]
And of course, George is very pleased about that.

[02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:14.130]
Very straightforward.

[02:11:14.670 --> 02:11:15.530]
Maybe that was down.

[02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:16.530]
Maybe that was that aroma.

[02:11:17.330 --> 02:11:19.270]
Oh, maybe it's coming down from Jupiter.

[02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:24.130]
See, I need these calls where you want to suck my ass in and rip George, or the other way, right?

[02:11:24.290 --> 02:11:26.530]
It's so, it's just a waste of time.

[02:11:26.730 --> 02:11:28.830]
Oh, you know, it's old and boring and ponderous.

[02:11:28.950 --> 02:11:30.250]
You know, oh, you're so great.

[02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:31.830]
I'm not impressed by that.

[02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:32.810]
I know how good I am.

[02:11:32.850 --> 02:11:34.470]
I know how well I've done for almost the...

[02:11:34.990 --> 02:11:36.510]
About third amazin' his town.

[02:11:36.650 --> 02:11:36.790]
I don't know.

[02:11:37.070 --> 02:11:38.570]
I hear the other crap that's on a year.

[02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:39.210]
I don't need that.

[02:11:39.350 --> 02:11:41.030]
It's not interesting if I'm listening to a show.

[02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:42.130]
Oh, hi, Larry.

[02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:43.370]
Your show is so entertaining.

[02:11:43.570 --> 02:11:44.130]
You're so wonderful.

[02:11:44.370 --> 02:11:46.370]
You ask all the right questions, you know, stuff like that.

[02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.710]
Uh-huh.

[02:11:47.070 --> 02:11:48.030]
Terminal, it's ponderous.

[02:11:48.030 --> 02:11:49.310]
It's like for old people, you know?

[02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:49.830]
Hey, Neil.

[02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:51.050]
I'm not an easy one.

[02:11:51.170 --> 02:11:51.170]

[02:11:51.210 --> 02:11:51.370]
I'm not an easy one.

[02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:51.410]
I'm not an easy one.

[02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:51.650]
I'm not an easy one.

[02:11:51.650 --> 02:11:54.850]
And by the way, George, you suck and you're well else than she say you're like...

[02:11:54.850 --> 02:11:55.310]
I'm not me.

[02:11:55.590 --> 02:11:56.110]
And you're not funny.

[02:11:56.250 --> 02:11:56.890]
Well, we know you're not.

[02:11:56.890 --> 02:11:57.930]
I don't know what they're supposed to be.

[02:11:59.090 --> 02:12:00.130]
He's George, okay?

[02:12:00.270 --> 02:12:01.630]
He didn't find you out this summer.

[02:12:01.690 --> 02:12:04.270]
We took a poll on that and like a few people said they like...

[02:12:04.270 --> 02:12:05.190]
About third amazin'.

[02:12:05.190 --> 02:12:07.030]
And about 5,000 said they say, yeah, whatever.

[02:12:07.370 --> 02:12:08.130]
Whatever it is.

[02:12:08.770 --> 02:12:10.290]
If you don't like it when he's on, don't listen.

[02:12:10.470 --> 02:12:11.170]
That's all I...

[02:12:11.910 --> 02:12:14.590]
It's like the barking at the moon at dog again, you know?

[02:12:14.630 --> 02:12:16.210]
I just don't understand people like that.

[02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:19.350]
When he's on, it's pretty obvious.

[02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:20.950]
You know, if I'm not there, if it's a summertime,

[02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:23.390]
if I take a day off like last Friday in Georgia's show,

[02:12:23.730 --> 02:12:26.210]
Hey, if you don't like him, if you don't like me, bye-bye.

[02:12:26.730 --> 02:12:27.830]
That's never bothered me.

[02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:29.490]
This is the last time I'm listening.

[02:12:29.750 --> 02:12:30.010]
Great.

[02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:32.310]
You know, I'm not going to change the show for one asshole

[02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:33.950]
that calls inner five assholes.

[02:12:34.270 --> 02:12:35.370]
Or 50 of them.

[02:12:35.790 --> 02:12:36.150]
Maybe...

[02:12:36.150 --> 02:12:37.070]
About third amazin'.

[02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:37.710]
That might do it.

[02:12:38.810 --> 02:12:40.310]
But it's just ridiculous.

[02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:42.870]
You know, this colonel talk showed it like bellyic

[02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:45.170]
and it's like I said negative, negative, negative, negative.

[02:12:45.370 --> 02:12:46.950]
And she's talking about crap in Miami.

[02:12:47.510 --> 02:12:48.130]
How do you like that?

[02:12:49.170 --> 02:12:49.690]
Give a love.

[02:12:50.530 --> 02:12:51.330]
Yeah, feel the love.

[02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:52.530]
I can feel it all the way up here.

[02:12:53.190 --> 02:12:54.310]
I hate to break the news to you.

[02:12:54.310 --> 02:12:56.090]
I don't want to get you all depressed and bed out of shape.

[02:12:56.410 --> 02:12:57.950]
But I'm looking out there's not a cloud this guy.

[02:12:58.070 --> 02:12:59.310]
It's sunny, it's 72 degrees.

[02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:00.790]
It's going to be 77 this afternoon.

[02:13:00.970 --> 02:13:02.010]
There's not a chance of rain.

[02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:05.450]
And so you know what Friday afternoon we'll get the ass end of Isabel.

[02:13:05.690 --> 02:13:06.790]
And Big Deal will survive it.

[02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:09.630]
We survived SARS twice here.

[02:13:09.690 --> 02:13:12.390]
We survived the goddamn West Nile and the Amad Cow

[02:13:12.390 --> 02:13:15.510]
and the attainted meat and the goddamn blackout and everything else.

[02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:16.250]
And we'll survive it.

[02:13:16.310 --> 02:13:18.050]
Everybody here still walks around with a smile on their face

[02:13:18.050 --> 02:13:19.470]
and they hold the door open for you.

[02:13:19.530 --> 02:13:20.490]
And they say hello on the elevator.

[02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:22.950]
And they're friendly and are decent and they're like human beings,

[02:13:22.950 --> 02:13:25.210]
as opposed to you know, like that.

[02:13:26.570 --> 02:13:29.050]
So if anybody wants to know why I love Toronto so much

[02:13:29.050 --> 02:13:31.150]
or like I almost anywhere that's not South Florida,

[02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:32.590]
it's because it's not South Florida.

[02:13:33.350 --> 02:13:35.250]
Because the people are civilized and they're like,

[02:13:35.290 --> 02:13:37.710]
have some cool but the which side is up and which side is down.

[02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:39.430]
And they seem generally speaking to get along together.

[02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:41.990]
All these different people, these schmottaheds and Chinese

[02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:43.670]
and whatever the hell they are.

[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:44.350]
Just people.

[02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:47.810]
And suppose the South Florida everybody hates each other.

[02:13:47.970 --> 02:13:49.390]
Oh, speak English, speak English.

[02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:50.090]
You know, yeah.

[02:13:50.090 --> 02:13:50.850]
And I'm sorry.

[02:13:51.110 --> 02:13:52.950]
Like crap and silly crews at the stadium.

[02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:53.970]
Oh God.

[02:13:56.090 --> 02:13:58.950]
You can't call Miami a third world country like a tenth world place

[02:13:59.970 --> 02:14:02.310]
with that Ilyana Rosanna, Dana bitch.

[02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:03.930]
All this other crap going on.

[02:14:04.610 --> 02:14:05.570]
That Jose Basuto.

[02:14:06.450 --> 02:14:08.230]
Always the same old tired garbage man.

[02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:10.450]
Hacking the same baloney.

[02:14:11.350 --> 02:14:13.870]
All those people playing in Fats Domino Park.

[02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:19.630]
135 votes for Wesley Clark rhymes with Fats Domino Park.

[02:14:20.590 --> 02:14:23.590]
Who'd you like to see as Democratic presidential candidate next year?

[02:14:23.970 --> 02:14:25.070]
Wesley Clark 135.

[02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:27.010]
I don't care.

[02:14:27.130 --> 02:14:27.570]
They all suck.

[02:14:27.650 --> 02:14:28.790]
See there's what I'm talking about.

[02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:29.910]
103 said they all suck.

[02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:30.870]
That's nice.

[02:14:32.110 --> 02:14:33.070]
18.9%.

[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:35.350]
Howard D 96, Bob Graham 71.

[02:14:35.810 --> 02:14:37.630]
I don't care. I'm from Bush 64, 11.7%.

[02:14:38.150 --> 02:14:38.790]
Shame on you.

[02:14:39.110 --> 02:14:39.770]
Shame on you.

[02:14:40.450 --> 02:14:42.130]
Get yourself an IQ test.

[02:14:43.050 --> 02:14:44.370]
Get yourself a brain transplant.

[02:14:46.030 --> 02:14:48.450]
John Kerry 19, L. Sharpton 18.

[02:14:48.450 --> 02:14:49.590]
John Edwards 13.

[02:14:49.870 --> 02:14:50.770]
Dennis Cassinij 8.

[02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:53.490]
Dick Gebhardt 7 people in this audience are for Dick.

[02:14:54.430 --> 02:14:55.370]
Jew Lieberman 6.

[02:14:55.650 --> 02:14:57.690]
And Carol Mosley Braun out of 543 votes.

[02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:58.990]
She's still sitting on three.

[02:15:01.010 --> 02:15:02.370]
Look at that on the Playboy channel.

[02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:04.990]
They're sitting on two to what?

[02:15:07.930 --> 02:15:14.210]
Two big 1256 at 560 WQ and two big for Clarence is what he said.

[02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:15.430]
He ran like a son of a bitch.

[02:15:15.610 --> 02:15:16.350]
Maybe that's what you smell.

[02:15:17.570 --> 02:15:19.770]
Maybe those are the actor burners leaving that aroma.

[02:15:20.630 --> 02:15:22.930]
Hey, if you're looking for a great playstead breakfast lunch,

[02:15:22.930 --> 02:15:24.370]
you didn't let me tell you about Vickoners.

[02:15:24.690 --> 02:15:26.330]
And I'm looking across the lake right now.

[02:15:26.430 --> 02:15:26.750]
Look at that.

[02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:27.230]
There's Rochester.

[02:15:27.610 --> 02:15:27.930]
There's Vic.

[02:15:28.070 --> 02:15:28.590]
There's Erv.

[02:15:28.910 --> 02:15:30.630]
You know, I wonder if there really was a Vickoner.

[02:15:30.710 --> 02:15:31.050]
You know what?

[02:15:31.630 --> 02:15:33.910]
I wonder if there was a Don and Bob.

[02:15:34.150 --> 02:15:35.830]
Anyway, Vickoner is from my hometown of Rochester.

[02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:37.430]
I ate there a zillion times.

[02:15:38.110 --> 02:15:38.690]
And loved it.

[02:15:38.810 --> 02:15:40.570]
Vickoner has been around since 1934.

[02:15:40.670 --> 02:15:42.730]
And a good news for people in South Florida who love those white hats

[02:15:42.730 --> 02:15:43.830]
and all their other Rochester food.

[02:15:44.250 --> 02:15:45.730]
Vickoner is located on federal highway.

[02:15:45.730 --> 02:15:47.950]
Just south of Barred Boulevard of the tunnel on the east side.

[02:15:48.290 --> 02:15:51.710]
Vickoners is a flashback to time when restaurants were really a great

[02:15:51.710 --> 02:15:53.110]
before the fast food came along.

[02:15:53.410 --> 02:15:56.470]
Go and enjoy a real hamburger or hot dog served hot fresh and fast.

[02:15:56.930 --> 02:15:58.190]
Vickoner versus Brought to Florida.

[02:15:58.410 --> 02:16:00.670]
They'll buy the same guys who feed you Cheeberg or Cheeberg.

[02:16:00.770 --> 02:16:04.410]
Vickoner versus uses the same fresh 100% ground chuck meat as Cheeberg or Cheeburger.

[02:16:04.690 --> 02:16:06.650]
And offers an incredible quarter pound hot dog.

[02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:09.810]
You have had a wiener in your life and you're a pus in a long time like that.

[02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:12.250]
What makes Vickoner is different from anybody else in town.

[02:16:12.250 --> 02:16:14.850]
I'm glad you asked because the burgers and dogs are served with

[02:16:14.850 --> 02:16:18.750]
the Vick signature meat sauce poured on top, giving you a combination of flavors available

[02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:19.790]
no place else in town.

[02:16:20.190 --> 02:16:23.070]
So if you're looking for something else to try, Vickoner versus a lot kinds of great dishes,

[02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:27.170]
including great breakfast menu, omelettes, cooked to order, French toast, pancakes,

[02:16:27.430 --> 02:16:28.750]
all your favorite side dishes too.

[02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:31.450]
So stop by Vickoner versus whether you're from Rochester or not.

[02:16:31.530 --> 02:16:33.330]
You'll still love it and see what all it's all about.

[02:16:33.470 --> 02:16:34.530]
Vickoner is on federal highway.

[02:16:34.670 --> 02:16:36.790]
Just south of Barred Boulevard of the tunnel on the east side.

[02:16:36.790 --> 02:16:41.090]
Be sure to tell them that old Neil Rogers from a wiener driving Brighton sent you by to Vickoner.

[02:16:41.090 --> 02:16:45.430]
My life and love, this is 435 City.

[02:16:45.950 --> 02:16:47.690]
Way to A.M.

[02:16:49.310 --> 02:16:53.250]
On a span of since Fearless Vida has won Natasha in I know-Lo

[02:16:53.250 --> 02:16:54.810]
to have to look for a motion squirt.

[02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:58.830]
Instead we listen to the Neil Rogers parent and balance went to two hours.

[02:16:59.170 --> 02:17:00.470]
Like this swish boom!

[02:17:00.970 --> 02:17:03.270]
I love it and it would not have asked me to swish boom!

[02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:05.850]
My co-worker Charlie, he's a real character.

[02:17:06.050 --> 02:17:06.970]
For the man, how you doing?

[02:17:07.090 --> 02:17:08.150]
Hey great game, us, Nina!

[02:17:08.150 --> 02:17:10.930]
Some balls ever seen the next shoot better than the last night.

[02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:12.870]
I mean it was like boom three points, boom three points,

[02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:15.390]
time to get boom three points, they're taking it home right now.

[02:17:16.050 --> 02:17:17.710]
Love to talk sports at work.

[02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:19.010]
Pretty much all the time.

[02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:21.930]
The guy pops to the infield right, lets you go right, roll style field,

[02:17:22.130 --> 02:17:24.630]
they drive it, meanwhile the dogs just bring another one home right up,

[02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:26.410]
taking a hootscoach in these guys, right?

[02:17:26.770 --> 02:17:29.710]
That is, while the rest of us are trying to work for a living.

[02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:32.570]
She'd be an exception last time, who was like, boom, we're going downtown,

[02:17:32.570 --> 02:17:33.230]
answer on federal highway.

[02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:36.130]
That's why I decided to tell Charlie about LaBadaville.

[02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:41.010]
And over the counter medication made especially for overactive conversation lists.

[02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:45.010]
Because my co-workers and I, well, we were concerned about Charlie.

[02:17:45.430 --> 02:17:47.750]
Now with LaBadaville, Charlie can relax.

[02:17:48.270 --> 02:17:50.570]
And we can get some work done, right Charlie?

[02:17:51.590 --> 02:17:52.030]
Charlie?

[02:17:53.010 --> 02:17:56.270]
Just blink your eyes twice if you can hear me Charlie, okay?

[02:17:56.890 --> 02:17:58.950]
Okay Charlie, I'll wipe the drool.

[02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:00.650]
Hey great game last night huh?

[02:18:01.310 --> 02:18:03.130]
That's acting non-Jr. LaBadaville.

[02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:04.190]
You don't need to make it.

[02:18:06.610 --> 02:18:09.730]
My candidacy is all about big changes I commend them.

[02:18:09.750 --> 02:18:11.350]
What about those orgies you had?

[02:18:11.690 --> 02:18:12.170]
Outrageous.

[02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:13.290]
What are your qualifications?

[02:18:14.010 --> 02:18:18.070]
I have no experience, I'm a woman nice and I'm terrible, a terrible guy.

[02:18:18.190 --> 02:18:18.830]
What's your plan?

[02:18:19.430 --> 02:18:20.310]
Here's my plan.

[02:18:20.570 --> 02:18:22.030]
I decided to get a bikini wax.

[02:18:22.570 --> 02:18:25.130]
And then the end, the crazy deficits spending.

[02:18:25.350 --> 02:18:25.590]
Oh!

[02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:27.270]
It really comes down to this.

[02:18:27.570 --> 02:18:27.790]
How?

[02:18:27.950 --> 02:18:29.050]
Game over.

[02:18:30.090 --> 02:18:31.930]
You from the makers of co-tests?

[02:18:32.190 --> 02:18:33.150]
It's vibrates.

[02:18:33.150 --> 02:18:34.050]
Fibrates.

[02:18:34.370 --> 02:18:37.370]
The super absorbacy and convenience you expect from co-tests.

[02:18:37.430 --> 02:18:42.090]
But with three speed vibrating action now that turns a week of mood swings, bloating

[02:18:42.090 --> 02:18:46.010]
and cravings, into a week of smiles, squeals and shutters of delight.

[02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.770]
Fibrates.

[02:18:47.170 --> 02:18:51.870]
Each insert has a built-in mini vibrator powered by an energizer watch battery that keeps going

[02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:53.250]
and going and going.

[02:18:53.510 --> 02:18:58.530]
Just pull the string to change speeds from two to two.

[02:18:59.630 --> 02:19:04.070]
So the next time your special friend pays you a visit, put a smile on her face.

[02:19:04.330 --> 02:19:06.550]
From the makers of co-tests, it's vibrates.

[02:19:06.850 --> 02:19:07.110]
Fibrates.

[02:19:07.570 --> 02:19:10.290]
Just wait for the box to keep chopping up and down on the shelf.

[02:19:14.390 --> 02:19:17.670]
And cruising, waiting, and you're jumping, G.T.

[02:19:18.130 --> 02:19:21.370]
And show your bodies and hearts in the keys.

[02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:24.790]
They feel like the sourcing cold, your dreams.

[02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:28.650]
Feels like we're all too weak, please.

[02:19:30.090 --> 02:19:36.910]
Guys who like halters and tank tops and short pants will have to wait for next year for our next

[02:19:36.910 --> 02:19:37.330]
lance.

[02:19:37.690 --> 02:19:41.170]
Can hang it, pulls in our speedos or briefs.

[02:19:41.210 --> 02:19:45.790]
Those are a few of our favorite themes and a songer.

[02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:47.870]
What's up, um?

[02:19:48.330 --> 02:19:50.790]
Halt some scumbag blasts.

[02:19:50.790 --> 02:19:54.710]
We'll just have to wait till it's warmer, I think.

[02:19:54.870 --> 02:19:59.190]
Until you can see more ass.

[02:20:01.330 --> 02:20:03.810]
Azia's weren't fine, and if our edition take one.

[02:20:04.910 --> 02:20:07.950]
Hello sports fans, I'm Azia's born.

[02:20:08.310 --> 02:20:09.750]
The Prince of F***ing Football.

[02:20:10.290 --> 02:20:12.770]
This year looks like it's going to be exciting in the NFL.

[02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:17.150]
One team to definitely watch out for are the Green Bay Packers.

[02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:19.950]
Cut, Azia, that's Packers.

[02:20:20.090 --> 02:20:20.270]
Oh?

[02:20:20.910 --> 02:20:23.070]
Packers, Green Bay Packers.

[02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:25.430]
Not Packers?

[02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:27.750]
Okay, okay.

[02:20:27.990 --> 02:20:29.610]
Okay, can we start again?

[02:20:30.250 --> 02:20:31.110]
Can we start it over?

[02:20:31.970 --> 02:20:32.770]
Give me a second.

[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:38.670]
In the AFC Central, you have to watch out for the upstart Cleveland Browns.

[02:20:39.350 --> 02:20:39.990]
Browns?

[02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:42.130]
What the f*** is a Brown?

[02:20:43.130 --> 02:20:43.510]
Cut!

[02:20:44.610 --> 02:20:45.130]
What?

[02:20:45.830 --> 02:20:47.950]
How about those New England guys?

[02:20:48.310 --> 02:20:50.310]
The f***ing Patriots or something like that?

[02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:52.590]
That reminds me of when I was growing up in England.

[02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.610]
Right in Birmingham.

[02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:55.010]
We were poor family.

[02:20:55.670 --> 02:20:57.890]
Azia, stick to the script if you can, please.

[02:20:58.510 --> 02:21:00.710]
F*** you, I'm the Prince of F***ing Football.

[02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:02.410]
Cut! Cut!

[02:21:02.930 --> 02:21:03.350]
Shen!

[02:21:04.170 --> 02:21:05.070]
Ah, David Brown.

[02:21:05.830 --> 02:21:10.910]
In the AFC, you have to like the Falcons, the Bears, the Panthers and Lions.

[02:21:11.230 --> 02:21:13.270]
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm...

[02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:14.830]
In line, it's a f***ing zoo.

[02:21:15.170 --> 02:21:17.590]
Where all these f***ing Falcons and Panthers and s***.

[02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:21.090]
Is this football or mutual or mama's wild f***ing kingdom?

[02:21:21.350 --> 02:21:22.070]
Cut it!

[02:21:22.850 --> 02:21:26.350]
That's all that's on the cue column, I know what do you want me to do about it.

[02:21:26.850 --> 02:21:28.510]
That just raps my pants.

[02:21:28.770 --> 02:21:31.110]
Let's all put this week on Azia's board.

[02:21:31.530 --> 02:21:33.050]
The Bricks of F***ing Football.

[02:21:33.370 --> 02:21:33.690]
Shen!

[02:21:34.590 --> 02:21:36.230]
He's a super star.

[02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:38.750]
In the AFC, you can name him.

[02:21:38.850 --> 02:21:40.170]
He's keeping his pretty wife and children.

[02:21:47.130 --> 02:21:48.950]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:53.810]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:56.030]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.990]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:57.450 --> 02:21:58.510]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:58.510 --> 02:21:59.010]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:59.010 --> 02:21:59.450]
He's keeping his family.

[02:21:59.850 --> 02:22:00.090]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:00.670 --> 02:22:00.710]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:01.590]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.590]

[02:22:04.390 --> 02:22:05.790]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:07.530 --> 02:22:08.330]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:08.610 --> 02:22:09.630]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:09.630 --> 02:22:11.110]
He was a shy.

[02:22:12.010 --> 02:22:13.690]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:18.250]
He's keeping his family.

[02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:25.390]
That day in Eagle Club Vado, he won the fast of Mauro.

[02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:27.210]
But now he's changing his mind.

[02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:34.270]
Now what we should say is, no more hearty, fruagy.

[02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:36.650]
Unless it's his lurchy.

[02:22:36.650 --> 02:22:45.170]
Now Kobe knows he's got a good lawyer to beat the cheerleader on his crew.

[02:22:45.870 --> 02:22:51.930]
His wife won't say a thing when the fiddle won't get ready for his crew.

[02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:57.890]
Suffering from constipation, Meta Muscle can help.

[02:22:58.430 --> 02:22:59.590]
Meta Muscle.

[02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:04.890]
For those times when you want to push, push it real good.

[02:23:05.890 --> 02:23:06.990]
Meta Muscle.

[02:23:07.250 --> 02:23:09.250]
It's always the same old story.

[02:23:09.730 --> 02:23:12.130]
You and your pals can't agree on what to watch.

[02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:14.470]
I want to watch stock car racing.

[02:23:15.310 --> 02:23:16.750]
I want to watch stock.

[02:23:16.990 --> 02:23:21.050]
Well now you can both be happy with a NASCAR PGA channel.

[02:23:21.310 --> 02:23:24.610]
It's two great sports on one channel.

[02:23:24.890 --> 02:23:27.830]
Watch Jeff Gordon with his number 24 Chevrolet wide open.

[02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:31.250]
Whoa, past Jim Purek on the 18th hole of the Bielec open.

[02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:42.290]
The NASCAR PGA channel never before had two acronyms combined to unite such diametrically opposed spectator sports.

[02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:45.230]
Here's Tiger Woods on the green at 8th.

[02:23:46.210 --> 02:23:48.570]
And here's the junior in the bit number 8.

[02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:53.170]
Look out to groups of athletes both shooting for the checkered flag stick.

[02:23:53.290 --> 02:23:53.750]
The adrenaline.

[02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.930]
The relaxation.

[02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:56.990]
The NASCAR PGA channel.

[02:23:56.990 --> 02:24:00.730]
The NASCAR PGA channel is a subsidiary of the fingerscage in the high channel.

[02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.530]
Be there!

[02:24:10.990 --> 02:24:13.870]
Well there is the price of gasoline.

[02:24:14.810 --> 02:24:18.070]
I don't think enough to fill my tank.

[02:24:18.610 --> 02:24:25.970]
If I want to drive up to the mountains first I have to stop being robbed of pain.

[02:24:27.490 --> 02:24:30.770]
On the catch we had for our vacation.

[02:24:31.410 --> 02:24:35.590]
We just fed it all at the location.

[02:24:37.470 --> 02:24:45.370]
While there is the price of super unleaded worth the profit I had not been bought.

[02:24:45.730 --> 02:24:53.170]
This summer when I take my boat out the engine I'm happy to win with the bear of gold.

[02:24:54.510 --> 02:25:02.790]
You know that if the price is too much fire I'm going to have to set the price of fire.

[02:25:04.750 --> 02:25:07.390]
Why did they raise the price?

[02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.710]
Denies!

[02:25:12.810 --> 02:25:16.710]
Action news reveals who else is running for California Governor.

[02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:17.090]
Homer!

[02:25:17.410 --> 02:25:18.330]
Why are you running for Governor?

[02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:20.730]
I can be a jerk and no one can stop me!

[02:25:21.010 --> 02:25:21.910]
What are your qualifications?

[02:25:23.410 --> 02:25:26.230]
Decisive, uncompromising and rude.

[02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:27.730]
How would you balance the budget?

[02:25:27.970 --> 02:25:29.210]
Taxes, spending reductions?

[02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:32.170]
Something very close exactly along those lines.

[02:25:32.310 --> 02:25:33.610]
What do you think about the other candidates?

[02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:36.930]
Candidates make me want to vomit and tear it.

[02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:38.470]
Oh what is with the smooth part?

[02:25:38.750 --> 02:25:40.430]
That's tonight on action news.

[02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:42.850]
If you're elected would you decrease your beer consumption?

[02:25:43.810 --> 02:25:44.370]
Beer.

[02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.790]
Maybe?

[02:25:46.210 --> 02:25:47.550]
I have a very short attention span.

[02:25:47.550 --> 02:25:48.610]
I'm awake, jerk!

[02:25:49.450 --> 02:25:51.350]
That's class one at five sixty WQM.

[02:25:51.350 --> 02:25:53.150]
It's our big Wednesday one to two of comedy bits.

[02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:54.290]
Thank the Lord for that.

[02:25:54.350 --> 02:25:54.990]
There we go.

[02:25:55.090 --> 02:25:55.410]
Oh yeah.

[02:25:55.650 --> 02:25:56.130]
Five sixty.

[02:25:57.630 --> 02:25:57.990]
QAN.

[02:25:58.490 --> 02:25:58.710]
Right.

[02:25:59.530 --> 02:26:00.930]
Okay we have five hundred and sixty bucks.

[02:26:01.050 --> 02:26:01.730]
Well we better do a lot.

[02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:05.470]
We better get over a thousand today over there at the van hit or I'm going to be really depressed.

[02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:10.030]
I don't care if it's like raining cats and dogs and they're like gigantic ice balls falling from the sky.

[02:26:10.430 --> 02:26:12.070]
And pellets and crap and among.

[02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.950]
I don't care.

[02:26:13.390 --> 02:26:13.750]
Asteroids.

[02:26:14.410 --> 02:26:14.770]
Exactly.

[02:26:14.770 --> 02:26:16.430]
I don't care if they're staining assholes.

[02:26:16.770 --> 02:26:16.850]
Okay.

[02:26:18.450 --> 02:26:22.190]
Let's get that money going for a band and pet rescue and let's quit with the excuses.

[02:26:22.450 --> 02:26:24.010]
It's like it's like the attendance at ball games.

[02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.630]
It's the same thing.

[02:26:24.850 --> 02:26:26.230]
Oh what is a cloud in the sky?

[02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:27.970]
Or there's like two feet of standing water.

[02:26:28.150 --> 02:26:29.010]
I can't get my robot.

[02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.770]
Get with it.

[02:26:30.690 --> 02:26:36.350]
The girl is waiting on you man right at the corner of Broward and University where the great intersections in Broward County right there at the Shell Station.

[02:26:36.810 --> 02:26:38.730]
I mean is there anybody who doesn't know where that is?

[02:26:38.810 --> 02:26:38.950]
No.

[02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.190]
No.

[02:26:39.410 --> 02:26:41.730]
Even to people like in a...

[02:26:41.730 --> 02:26:42.810]
Alliance for a county know where that is.

[02:26:44.650 --> 02:26:45.290]
In Okahumpga.

[02:26:45.850 --> 02:26:47.630]
At the turnpike plaza they know where it is.

[02:26:47.910 --> 02:26:49.190]
Broward University in the Shell Station.

[02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.890]
Look for the Q&A.

[02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:51.110]
And look for the lovely McGail in there.

[02:26:51.850 --> 02:26:52.850]
Maybe you'll get lucky.

[02:26:53.390 --> 02:26:53.930]
But I doubt it.

[02:26:54.750 --> 02:27:00.430]
And you got the best meal CDs and a mohawar David and absolutely changes all that stuff for a band and pet rescue for a good cause.

[02:27:00.750 --> 02:27:02.090]
Shell out some cash and shell.

[02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:03.830]
Okay and get with it between now and two o'clock.

[02:27:03.970 --> 02:27:05.950]
If we don't go over a grand which is going to be very difficult.

[02:27:06.350 --> 02:27:07.030]
I'm going to be pork.

[02:27:07.250 --> 02:27:08.210]
I'll say that right now.

[02:27:08.470 --> 02:27:08.610]
Yeah.

[02:27:09.810 --> 02:27:11.550]
I have an idea that you'll be pork no matter what.

[02:27:11.550 --> 02:27:12.710]
Well, that could be.

[02:27:13.410 --> 02:27:14.630]
I don't know not this kid.

[02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:16.590]
Not on that end anyway.

[02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.770]
Oh.

[02:27:17.270 --> 02:27:18.790]
How does that pull come and speak of that?

[02:27:19.190 --> 02:27:21.670]
Who'd you like to see as Democratic presidential candidate this year?

[02:27:21.710 --> 02:27:25.290]
He's going to be announcing any second by the way any minute, pretty soon when he gets around to it.

[02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:27.270]
Wesley Clark 142 he's running.

[02:27:27.550 --> 02:27:28.890]
I don't care they all suck 108.

[02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:30.350]
Howard Dean 101.

[02:27:30.970 --> 02:27:31.550]
Bob Graham 73.

[02:27:31.970 --> 02:27:32.490]
I don't care.

[02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:34.630]
I'm for Bush 68 11.9%.

[02:27:35.250 --> 02:27:36.610]
Hard-ass morons.

[02:27:37.030 --> 02:27:37.910]
John Kerry 19.

[02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:38.930]
Now sharp to 19.

[02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:39.930]
Kind of scary.

[02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.690]
Sharpen Scott.

[02:27:40.850 --> 02:27:41.330]
I would scare.

[02:27:41.510 --> 02:27:43.810]
I carry John Edwards.

[02:27:44.410 --> 02:27:45.250]
The psychic man.

[02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.670]
John Edwards got 14.

[02:27:47.130 --> 02:27:47.990]

And Carol Mosley Braun still got three out of five but in 71.

[02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:53.310]
Nice going girl.

[02:27:54.690 --> 02:27:58.170]
If you're on the Atkins' ad or any of the low-carb sugar-free diet then here's a story.

[02:27:58.170 --> 02:27:59.450]
You're going to fall in love with it.

You're doing nothing.

You inherited all of these wonderful accounts from Brian Schmutz and you're doing nothing.

[02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:11.450]
You wouldn't know service.

[02:28:11.650 --> 02:28:13.270]
I do the only thing he services is screw in.

[02:28:13.810 --> 02:28:14.710]
Even better than...

[02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.950]

Button with our right wing censorship.

[02:29:56.950 --> 02:29:58.570]
There are words that must have slay.

[02:29:58.830 --> 02:29:59.110]
Yes.

[02:29:59.110 --> 02:30:02.430]
Who do we tell you how I feel for K?

[02:30:02.690 --> 02:30:02.950]
K.

[02:30:03.310 --> 02:30:03.390]
K.

[02:30:03.570 --> 02:30:03.570]

[02:30:03.770 --> 02:30:03.770]

[02:30:03.870 --> 02:30:03.870]

[02:30:04.310 --> 02:30:04.630]
K.

K.

Tell her I'm a service day.

[02:30:20.030 --> 02:30:22.670]
And the FCC won't let me sing this.

[02:30:22.990 --> 02:30:25.710]
So I'm not going to say now if you see K.

[02:30:26.290 --> 02:30:27.010]
Take her hand.

[02:30:27.010 --> 02:30:30.210]

[02:30:38.330 --> 02:30:39.930]
Wanna go, wanna go.

[02:30:40.250 --> 02:30:42.450]
But gotta see you with Tio.

[02:30:42.630 --> 02:30:43.390]
Wanna go.

[02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.750]
Oh.

[02:30:48.270 --> 02:30:48.590]
Oh.

[02:30:49.170 --> 02:30:49.170]

[02:30:50.130 --> 02:30:50.710]
Oh.

[02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:51.190]
Oh.

[02:30:51.930 --> 02:30:52.010]
Oh.

[02:30:54.970 --> 02:30:55.730]
Oh.

[02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.910]
Oh.

[02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:57.750]
Oh and rain.

[02:30:58.490 --> 02:30:59.410]
Oh and rain.

[02:30:59.410 --> 02:30:59.410]

[02:30:59.410 --> 02:31:00.810]
إ it comes to Jackson it always is.

[02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:05.970]
When people really need me.

[02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:08.070]
I dream the same things.

[02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.070]

[02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.070]

[02:31:08.070 --> 02:31:08.070]

[02:31:08.310 --> 02:31:08.310]

[02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:13.710]
Yeah alright, my only thought

[02:31:13.710 --> 02:31:16.330]
I'm going to focus on my way there's some thing

[02:31:16.330 --> 02:31:16.330]

[02:31:16.330 --> 02:31:17.370]
I think it's good to sleep here.

[02:31:17.370 --> 02:31:18.050]
But at most I think,

[02:31:18.050 --> 02:31:18.130]
you want to explore your body.

[02:31:18.130 --> 02:31:18.170]
No, but I'm not.

[02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:21.730]
I'll just be happy,

[02:31:24.490 --> 02:31:26.890]
my friend takes me to piecesavolyy emptyo.

[02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:26.050]
She wears a lot of beautifully

[02:31:26.890 --> 02:31:29.130]
She won't let me.

[02:31:30.870 --> 02:31:35.910]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her weird.

[02:31:36.270 --> 02:31:37.470]
I want to give you a kiss.

[02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:38.150]
Welcome.

[02:31:38.810 --> 02:31:41.850]
I want to hold her behind.

[02:31:43.350 --> 02:31:45.070]
Close doors and more.

[02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:51.010]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:58.590]
When she returned, she said she was an actress.

[02:32:00.270 --> 02:32:05.450]
She showed me an elbow, a picture of her opening.

[02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:07.950]
When she then sitting on.

[02:32:08.350 --> 02:32:10.650]
She seemed as if she could be.

[02:32:11.770 --> 02:32:14.330]
But I could clearly see.

[02:32:14.830 --> 02:32:19.030]
She was the kind of girl who stole that heart.

[02:32:21.770 --> 02:32:22.750]
She said she was an actress.

[02:32:22.970 --> 02:32:27.890]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:32:29.410 --> 02:32:34.650]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her weird.

[02:32:36.990 --> 02:32:40.170]
I want to hold her behind.

[02:32:41.610 --> 02:32:43.850]
Close doors and more.

[02:32:45.090 --> 02:32:50.010]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:32:51.870 --> 02:32:57.410]
Well, I'll never forget the dream that thens all's been.

[02:32:59.550 --> 02:33:04.590]
We're shared a sight and we shared our tales.

[02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:10.250]
But as my heart cries the lever behind.

[02:33:10.250 --> 02:33:19.530]
Regrets are all mine, because I hope that you've met girl in the end.

[02:33:22.310 --> 02:33:26.930]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:33:28.770 --> 02:33:34.170]
I want to whisper sweet nothings in her weird.

[02:33:34.170 --> 02:33:40.070]
I want to hold her behind.

[02:33:41.870 --> 02:33:43.490]
Close doors and more.

[02:33:44.850 --> 02:33:56.510]
I want to kiss her, but she won't let me.

[02:33:59.110 --> 02:34:00.470]
We're class foods.

[02:34:00.470 --> 02:34:02.330]
It's part of the Philip Norris family.

[02:34:02.650 --> 02:34:05.130]
And we know what your kids want for dinner.

[02:34:05.230 --> 02:34:07.650]
More class, nicotine and cheese please.

[02:34:08.910 --> 02:34:15.650]
It's class-owned, creamy, delicious, processed cheese melted over pure, hugely addictive nicotine.

[02:34:16.010 --> 02:34:16.810]
Kids love it.

[02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:20.070]
It's the nicotine.

[02:34:20.410 --> 02:34:21.210]
It's the cheese.

[02:34:22.770 --> 02:34:24.810]
No, you're right. It's the nicotine.

[02:34:25.090 --> 02:34:27.730]
My kids can't get enough of class nicotine and cheese.

[02:34:27.730 --> 02:34:30.150]
Where is it you old hag? Where is it?

[02:34:30.510 --> 02:34:33.230]
Now Billy, stop digging under those deep cushions.

[02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:35.390]
I've got more nicotine and cheese right here.

[02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:36.870]
Great mom.

[02:34:38.390 --> 02:34:41.990]
Mmm, class nicotine and cheese.

[02:34:42.750 --> 02:34:44.110]
It's the nicotine.

[02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:48.070]
Class nicotine and cheese, part of the Philip Norris family.

[02:34:48.370 --> 02:34:53.110]
We keep trying to distance ourselves from being an evil representative of tobacco-related death.

[02:34:53.110 --> 02:34:55.330]
But somehow it just isn't working.

[02:35:24.170 --> 02:35:28.270]
And we couldn't keep this drowsiness naked in his pants.

[02:35:36.190 --> 02:35:40.470]
Well, he calls a brush-baskin' as the younger of a fool.

[02:35:40.950 --> 02:35:42.770]
She said it's not my job.

[02:35:42.770 --> 02:35:44.670]
I didn't want to be rude.

[02:35:45.370 --> 02:35:48.710]
She knocked on the door and then went to her surprise.

[02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:53.170]
It was her that he was after lots of burger and fries.

[02:35:53.390 --> 02:35:57.130]
She said she didn't want it, but he claimed it was world-mountain.

[02:35:57.750 --> 02:36:01.210]
And Toby couldn't keep this lactaffey in his pants.

[02:36:02.030 --> 02:36:05.770]
Well, class nicotine and cheese, part of the biggest bitch in the whole Bible.

[02:36:06.070 --> 02:36:08.050]
It's the two biggest bitches and one big piece of it too.

[02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:09.050]
Well, that boy, that girl.

[02:36:11.890 --> 02:36:15.130]
I'm running to the bitch, I'm shooting to the bitch and Wednesday Saturday she's a bitch.

[02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:40.730]
Yeah, I'm from the bitch, you ain't ever seen a bitch before.

[02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:41.950]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:41.950 --> 02:36:45.690]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:45.690 --> 02:36:46.370]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:46.370 --> 02:36:47.850]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:48.490 --> 02:36:50.970]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:51.450 --> 02:36:54.830]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:54.830 --> 02:36:56.730]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:57.070 --> 02:36:57.730]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:36:57.830 --> 02:37:00.010]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:00.550 --> 02:37:04.190]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.250]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:04.250 --> 02:37:06.150]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.690]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:06.690 --> 02:37:10.690]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:10.690 --> 02:37:12.750]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:14.050]
I'm gonna get her, I'm gonna get her.

[02:37:14.050 --> 02:37:15.590]
And I've said she lives in Jupiter too.

[02:37:16.350 --> 02:37:17.250]
There's Wesley Clarke.

[02:37:17.270 --> 02:37:20.390]
And in a time of war, he's running.

[02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:20.510]

[02:37:20.510 --> 02:37:23.630]
To ask those questions and propose those alternatives

[02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:26.690]
in the highest sense of patriotism.

[02:37:29.230 --> 02:37:29.910]
Yeah!

[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:30.390]

[02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:33.050]
That's her, for Wes.

[02:37:35.430 --> 02:37:37.970]
So we are going to hold the administration accountable

[02:37:37.970 --> 02:37:38.910]
for its policy.

[02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:42.090]
He said basically bushes and an asshole. I think we knew that but I'd like to hear him sent

[02:37:42.090 --> 02:37:46.870]
So we got the 587 votes on the pool, which is very appropriate. You see when we have our thumb on the pulse

[02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:49.730]
Right, I just checked the Sun sentinel website by the way

[02:37:49.730 --> 02:37:51.870]
There's anything on there about Don Cox dying in no

[02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:56.750]
And Jake has even got his column all prepared another one of those puff pieces about some stupid chauffeur tomorrow

[02:37:56.750 --> 02:37:58.890]
Anything about Don Cox passing away no

[02:37:59.750 --> 02:38:03.310]
The Sun Sentinel is evil folks. They're the anti-Christ

[02:38:04.090 --> 02:38:06.910]
They make the hero look good. I never dreamed I could say that

[02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:07.430]
Wow

[02:38:08.290 --> 02:38:14.330]
590 votes on the pool Wesley Carkey's kick an ass man. Thorick deficits see 148 votes for West

[02:38:14.330 --> 02:38:21.390]
I don't care. They also come to the 12 Howard Dean 104 Bobby Graham 76 B.D. Is and all we like Bobby Graham

[02:38:21.390 --> 02:38:26.190]

[02:42:05.270 --> 02:42:05.430]

We still like the Japanese weasel.

[02:42:09.950 --> 02:42:11.970]
I can't even think where the stampons are.

[02:42:12.130 --> 02:42:13.810]
The amount of good things can't fight.

[02:42:14.050 --> 02:42:14.730]
Where we are also.

[02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:16.930]
All we got is one bit of time.

[02:42:16.930 --> 02:42:19.490]
We pray to Allah that's our prayer.

[02:42:19.850 --> 02:42:24.410]
Listen to the G-Hide, but what can the rock and no sound of the town of town?

[02:42:24.710 --> 02:42:27.630]
Smelly camel, don't you that don't think about our music?

[02:42:27.930 --> 02:42:29.950]
Great thing, oh, you think that's me?

[02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:31.830]
Don't care where the women are at.

[02:42:32.050 --> 02:42:34.250]
There's plenty of standing in two-grab.

[02:42:34.650 --> 02:42:36.810]
When he's quiet down, I look between his knees.

[02:42:37.190 --> 02:42:38.270]
Hey, what's that thing?

[02:42:38.470 --> 02:42:39.530]
I see the angle.

[02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:41.730]
We have to do the G-Hide, but what?

[02:42:42.110 --> 02:42:46.510]
I think he became eating halabano, bone, no lights, no motor car.

[02:42:46.510 --> 02:42:49.510]
Not a single doll to eat.

[02:42:52.310 --> 02:42:52.950]
Whoa!

[02:42:53.310 --> 02:42:56.170]
He's spreading out the bomb of town.

[02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:13.830]
Well, she once was me turning general.

[02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:19.610]
When she was in charge, it was business as usual.

[02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:25.530]
She's one tough woman and let me tell you that's noble.

[02:43:26.530 --> 02:43:27.270]
Maybe she is.

[02:43:28.290 --> 02:43:31.530]
Well, now all of the Democrats are loving her.

[02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:37.130]
Ever since she said she might run for governor.

[02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:42.870]
Well, there's just one question I'd like to ask her.

[02:43:44.950 --> 02:43:46.170]
Why do you shake?

[02:43:46.690 --> 02:43:47.510]
Cannery know.

[02:43:47.970 --> 02:43:49.050]
Why do you shake?

[02:43:49.610 --> 02:43:50.410]
Cannery know.

[02:43:50.910 --> 02:43:51.990]
Why do you shake?

[02:43:52.530 --> 02:43:53.330]
Cannery know.

[02:43:53.930 --> 02:43:54.890]
Why do you shake?

[02:43:55.390 --> 02:43:56.270]
Cannery know.

[02:43:56.930 --> 02:44:00.610]
Well, you gotta lick a bush if you wanna take control.

[02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:06.870]
Their songs provided the soundtrack for our whole generation.

[02:44:07.850 --> 02:44:12.850]
And now they're finding a whole new audience with a CD that doesn't sound a whole lot more.

[02:44:12.850 --> 02:44:14.930]
And they don't like anything they've ever done before.

[02:44:15.430 --> 02:44:19.450]
It's the best of crossbees, stills, and cash.

[02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:22.390]
Shones you know we're riding.

[02:44:24.010 --> 02:44:26.890]
On the Marrakex Express.

[02:44:27.250 --> 02:44:27.910]
Experience.

[02:44:28.330 --> 02:44:28.970]
Desjavu.

[02:44:29.250 --> 02:44:30.350]
All over again.

[02:44:30.710 --> 02:44:35.750]
When crossbees, stills, and cash unveil a whole different tank on this classic tune.

[02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:38.970]
All houses are very, very, very fun house.

[02:44:38.970 --> 02:44:43.430]
With two cats in the yard.

[02:44:43.890 --> 02:44:48.770]
It's a CD jam packed with all the songs you want to teach your children.

[02:44:49.190 --> 02:44:52.650]
Mike, I am yours.

[02:44:54.830 --> 02:44:57.310]
You are mine.

[02:44:58.370 --> 02:45:00.390]
Yo, I'm Johnny Cash.

[02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:02.310]
Because we stills, and cash.

[02:45:03.050 --> 02:45:06.210]
Yo, we use the thing like a couple of boys named Sue.

[02:45:06.210 --> 02:45:12.090]
But now the cash register is ringing because we're singing in a whole new register.

[02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:14.470]
You are what you are.

[02:45:15.130 --> 02:45:16.790]
And you make it hard.

[02:45:17.410 --> 02:45:20.450]
The best of crossbees, stills, and cash.

[02:45:20.770 --> 02:45:24.750]
Walk the line straight to your local record store and pick up a copy today.

[02:45:33.450 --> 02:45:39.190]
Hey, if you're looking to eat anything, you can be on my tube.

[02:45:40.890 --> 02:45:46.710]
But you shouldn't be buying a thing that don't belong to you.

[02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:50.430]
And so I say, we turn my mother.

[02:45:51.790 --> 02:45:54.130]
I don't want to get it back.

[02:45:55.210 --> 02:45:57.810]
But that's my goal, Billy.

[02:45:59.370 --> 02:46:01.410]
But that's my plan.

[02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:05.130]
And put on the belt.

[02:46:06.690 --> 02:46:08.830]
But that's quite the cost.

[02:46:10.450 --> 02:46:15.910]
For that much money, can buy a lot of times, buy a flow.

[02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:20.450]
If you're the widow, buy a seat.

[02:46:21.150 --> 02:46:23.050]
If you need therapy.

[02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:27.950]
Because the only one does that.

[02:46:28.470 --> 02:46:30.610]
If the three choose their reason.

[02:46:31.150 --> 02:46:34.450]
And so I'm singing, we turn my mother.

[02:46:35.810 --> 02:46:37.970]
Come on, be a pack.

[02:46:39.850 --> 02:46:41.810]
Why would they option?

[02:46:41.810 --> 02:46:45.290]
And my route is now.

[02:46:46.730 --> 02:46:49.050]
Return my mother.

[02:46:50.410 --> 02:46:56.750]
And you've got no right to sell my teeth.

[02:46:58.030 --> 02:46:59.930]
Of that really advice.

[02:47:01.330 --> 02:47:03.770]
Return my mother.

[02:47:05.370 --> 02:47:07.290]
I don't want it back.

[02:47:08.290 --> 02:47:10.370]
Return my mother.

[02:47:10.370 --> 02:47:15.230]
I can't hit a mom.

[02:47:17.290 --> 02:47:17.910]
Return it.

[02:47:18.290 --> 02:47:21.090]
And go through the misery that you've got.

[02:47:21.130 --> 02:47:22.370]
Return my mother.

[02:47:25.470 --> 02:47:28.790]
And I can buy a full spare.

[02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:37.270]
And go through the misery that you've got.

[02:47:41.030 --> 02:47:42.270]
Return my mother.

[02:47:46.210 --> 02:47:48.850]
Return my mother.

[02:47:49.430 --> 02:47:49.710]
Return my mother.

[02:47:49.710 --> 02:47:49.770]
Return my mother.

[02:47:49.770 --> 02:47:55.190]
Return my mother.

[02:47:55.270 --> 02:48:03.450]
Return my mother.

[02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:06.290]
Return my mother.

[02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:15.810]
Return my mother.

[02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:16.550]
Return my mother.

[02:48:16.550 --> 02:48:30.310]
Return my mother.

[02:48:30.570 --> 02:48:33.410]
All of this you'll have milk.

[02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:39.110]
and with his aggression, Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait.

[02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:41.550]
It's just the way it's going to be.

[02:48:41.770 --> 02:48:48.190]
We ride to Beatsadam, who's aint his head with a pipe.

[02:48:48.790 --> 02:48:55.030]
Sit back and watch his head explode like a mellum way to ride.

[02:48:56.310 --> 02:49:02.430]
He tried to steal away Kuwait and be the only sheep.

[02:49:02.430 --> 02:49:09.470]
And he間 left Fula free, up for his fate and blow away this heat.

[02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:15.530]
He wanted to be aской Abgeordanian, who can pray for it.

[02:49:16.270 --> 02:49:29.490]
Now he were defeated at Kuwait, but built a gun in his city as he managed to be aspitted to this country.

[02:49:31.430 --> 02:49:32.410]
He tried to rebel Devil whole years, took it back.

[02:49:32.410 --> 02:49:32.950]
I'm away!

[02:49:34.670 --> 02:49:36.650]
It's time I'm gonna say!

[02:49:37.490 --> 02:49:37.510]
Ooh!

[02:49:38.710 --> 02:49:39.970]
Saturday morning joint,

[02:49:40.210 --> 02:49:43.310]
Oval Winkle J. Motten is bullied by the Sartam Hussein

[02:49:43.310 --> 02:49:44.810]
For the hat cap,

[02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:47.410]
misadventures of Iraqi and Bollinkov!

[02:49:47.410 --> 02:50:14.390]
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

[02:50:14.390 --> 02:50:38.810]
Oh, my, Rocky! What do you know about this, Adam? Don't ask me! Ask my auntie! H-D-D-D-Hoo! H-D-A-C-F-Hoo! H-D-A-C-F-Hoo! Join us next time for oils, well, that ends well, or kiss your gas, goodbye!

[02:51:08.810 --> 02:51:18.330]
Whichever one's he got, so, uh, gobern yourselves accordingly, I guess. You know, it's that time of the year again when the mattress, storms, and furniture stores run those phony ad sales every year at this time, the same old stuff.

[02:51:50.850 --> 02:52:09.370]
So don't be fooled by those mattress' storms, afforded your stir-rads, they can't come close to matching when you always get every day from down the mattress. Pick up that phone right now and replace that lumpy, bumpy, worn-out old mattress with a great new and unbeatable price. Call 1-800-MACRIS-1-800-MATTRES or check them online at mattress.com.

[02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:15.730]
We're sports radio 560-G-A-M!

[02:52:17.230 --> 02:52:20.410]
G-S-L-S! Hey, who are you?

[02:52:20.650 --> 02:52:25.150]
I am the golden-fuck-news. How can tell by my confidence, smile?

[02:52:25.690 --> 02:52:29.690]
Oh, well, when you wake at me like that, uh, who are those, the distant ones?

[02:52:30.110 --> 02:52:33.990]
Ah, this is me, public. There you are, my little public.

[02:52:33.990 --> 02:52:35.890]
Oh, you have a stat you're feeding them.

[02:52:36.050 --> 02:52:42.250]
I'm spoon-feeding them a fan and balanced diet of misinformation. What's the plain hour?

[02:52:42.850 --> 02:52:47.410]
Look, it's just like the ones that don't flew into the towers.

[02:52:48.350 --> 02:52:48.950]
Woooow!

[02:52:49.770 --> 02:52:51.330]
Certainly looks easy to swallow.

[02:52:51.430 --> 02:52:55.150]
I already have 69% of them leaving Iraq was behind, I love it.

[02:52:55.230 --> 02:52:55.590]
Wow!

[02:52:55.890 --> 02:52:58.990]
One hour-one recollection of them laden should be completely erased.

[02:52:59.330 --> 02:53:01.130]
Amazing how simple they are!

[02:53:01.130 --> 02:53:04.690]
Come on, you have to eat to grow up and be a hero.

[02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:07.990]
Might even be the greatest president in the universe.

[02:53:08.570 --> 02:53:10.850]
Like almighty demons to wash.

[02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:12.050]
Who is in here?

[02:53:12.370 --> 02:53:14.010]
You haven't only in control.

[02:53:14.350 --> 02:53:14.950]
Of course.

[02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:19.410]
They know that if they didn't see it on TV, it simply isn't true.

[02:53:26.930 --> 02:53:33.030]
The candidates all admitted it's as a problem.

[02:53:33.150 --> 02:53:41.590]
Pushed it from unemployment to inflation to our wartime situation.

[02:53:41.750 --> 02:53:48.250]
They say that our nation would discuss locations or thumbs down to just one thing.

[02:53:49.250 --> 02:53:53.550]
Some don't like the way for swans to country.

[02:53:55.230 --> 02:53:56.450]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:53:57.250 --> 02:54:00.950]
That's exactly why they all know for me.

[02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:06.570]
Yeah, the boys and the labor are into the play.

[02:54:06.770 --> 02:54:10.630]
But they think we're the extra-the-anxious, they think they're fed.

[02:54:11.010 --> 02:54:14.710]
Some don't like the way for swans to country.

[02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:18.770]
All right.

[02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:24.770]
Books on tape presents Madonna's first children's book.

[02:54:24.890 --> 02:54:26.950]
I do not like green eggs and ham.

[02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:31.150]
I do not like to make lots more than six sides at a time.

[02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:33.350]
I will not eat them in a train.

[02:54:33.710 --> 02:54:37.230]
I will not eat breakfast off of Drew Carrey's ass crack.

[02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:39.770]
I will not eat them for a million years.

[02:54:40.170 --> 02:54:41.910]
But I would eat Britney Spears.

[02:54:42.170 --> 02:54:43.530]
Madonna, look on tape.

[02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:44.510]
It made me go.

[02:54:44.710 --> 02:54:46.570]
And monkeys might fly out of my butt.

[02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.670]
Funny.

[02:54:50.270 --> 02:54:50.830]
Yes, dear.

[02:54:51.650 --> 02:54:52.890]
Take off my slippers.

[02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:54.230]
Yes, dear.

[02:54:55.210 --> 02:54:56.870]
Now take off my bra.

[02:54:57.410 --> 02:54:58.350]
Yes, dear.

[02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.970]
Ooh.

[02:55:00.090 --> 02:55:02.450]
Now slide down and flip off my pants.

[02:55:02.990 --> 02:55:04.030]
Oh, yes, dear.

[02:55:04.450 --> 02:55:05.070]
Thank you.

[02:55:05.430 --> 02:55:07.550]
And don't ever let me catch you wearing my clothes again.

[02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:09.330]
Or swear I'll leave you, pervert.

[02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:10.330]
Yes, dear.

[02:55:20.730 --> 02:55:22.370]
I have you seen the show.

[02:55:22.370 --> 02:55:25.450]
I have you seen the show where everyone's in the know.

[02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:27.210]
Everyone's in the know.

[02:55:27.430 --> 02:55:28.970]
They're all lit up at the scams.

[02:55:29.270 --> 02:55:31.990]
They're shambling fly up except for Joe Spon.

[02:55:33.350 --> 02:55:34.810]
So nice to win all the games.

[02:55:35.510 --> 02:55:36.490]
So win all the games.

[02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:38.150]
Learn everyone's name.

[02:55:38.550 --> 02:55:39.930]
And everyone's name.

[02:55:40.050 --> 02:55:42.670]
But you don't have a clue that it's not true.

[02:55:43.050 --> 02:55:44.330]
You don't have a clue.

[02:55:45.730 --> 02:55:48.750]
Well, he finds out it'll be a shock.

[02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:51.410]
National laughing stockings.

[02:55:52.610 --> 02:55:53.990]
But nobody will see.

[02:55:54.190 --> 02:55:56.430]
Nobody will see us as the sun's rising.

[02:55:58.650 --> 02:56:03.090]
He's such a gallant, simple, sad, car than a movie traffic.

[02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:06.250]
But nobody will see.

[02:56:06.790 --> 02:56:07.950]
Nobody will see.

[02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:09.250]
Doesn't tell us by TV.

[02:56:09.770 --> 02:56:11.590]
Fentil two of five sixty WQM.

[02:56:11.670 --> 02:56:13.830]
Mad Dog coming up and two the Hupper from four to six thirty.

[02:56:13.990 --> 02:56:15.170]
Marlon pregame six thirty.

[02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:16.590]
Humongous game.

[02:56:17.210 --> 02:56:18.890]
Marlon's at the filly seven oh five nine.

[02:56:18.890 --> 02:56:21.690]
Whoever wins that game is going to still be in the in the driver's seat.

[02:56:21.970 --> 02:56:22.970]
For the year wild card.

[02:56:23.190 --> 02:56:24.330]
And he came to the baseball game.

[02:56:24.450 --> 02:56:27.050]
Joe and Mark over nine hundred and twenty bucks for a band and pet rescue.

[02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:30.970]
And Miguel had to leave because he has to poo as it says here.

[02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.310]
Right.

[02:56:31.750 --> 02:56:32.650]
That's what he said.

[02:56:33.310 --> 02:56:34.110]
That's what you're saying.

[02:56:34.330 --> 02:56:34.450]
Right.

[02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:37.010]
Well, do you know that or do you just you making it up?

[02:56:37.230 --> 02:56:38.570]
No, as he said, he's got to go.

[02:56:39.430 --> 02:56:42.010]
He says I have to go take a cramp.

[02:56:49.690 --> 02:56:50.010]
Oh.

[02:56:50.610 --> 02:56:51.410]

[02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:20.210]
I dropped in on the floor.

[02:58:21.490 --> 02:58:23.410]
I was turning blue.

[02:58:23.790 --> 02:58:24.930]
I died right after you.

[02:58:24.990 --> 02:58:26.590]
I was never thought that I would die.

[02:58:27.030 --> 02:58:29.650]
It does ain't time that Johnny has to do.

[02:58:30.870 --> 02:58:32.570]
Shelf the ambulance door.

[02:58:33.010 --> 02:58:34.010]
Shelf the ambulance door.

[02:58:34.250 --> 02:58:35.750]
There's nothing else you can do.

[02:58:35.750 --> 02:58:41.970]
Johnny and I threw a picture of that generator pass away with the boy named Sue.

[02:58:43.350 --> 02:58:48.490]
I think I may have thought something when I thank you for summer's that day.

[02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:51.770]
I always thought you were a fool.

[02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:54.190]
Well let me show like you blew.

[02:58:56.110 --> 02:59:00.490]
Oh it was it all was from the alcohol and it looked okay.

[02:59:01.530 --> 02:59:03.470]
I was a star of the two.

[02:59:04.390 --> 02:59:06.550]
And now we're both in the two.

[02:59:15.190 --> 02:59:20.210]
I was standing there one day not thinking I would die.

[02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:23.810]
From being able to take you together.

[02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:28.090]
I should ever keep things on.

[02:59:29.090 --> 02:59:33.730]
A big back must be trapped inside my bowels.

[02:59:36.270 --> 02:59:40.310]
How can you die from infected parts?

[02:59:41.050 --> 02:59:43.210]
You're let these put your doctors in.

[02:59:44.010 --> 02:59:45.670]
Now my heart stops.

[02:59:46.550 --> 02:59:47.930]
You schmucks at Sinai.

[02:59:48.510 --> 02:59:50.730]
Throw my intestines out.

[02:59:52.950 --> 02:59:57.270]
I guess I should have known what to expect living in Miami.

[02:59:57.270 --> 03:00:00.710]
With the kind of service you can get in this town.

[03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:03.130]
I would act in the mean too.

[03:00:03.430 --> 03:00:08.470]
I'll roll if I didn't eat that well I swallowed.

[03:00:12.170 --> 03:00:15.530]
Why can't you let me so you can ask?

[03:00:16.970 --> 03:00:18.270]
Why can't you lose us?

[03:00:18.450 --> 03:00:19.030]
Get it right.

[03:00:19.870 --> 03:00:23.590]
My bowels were blocked inside my hiding.

[03:00:23.590 --> 03:00:28.830]
I can't wait to go out.

[03:00:29.370 --> 03:00:30.710]
It's good time.

[03:00:43.590 --> 03:00:46.070]
Some of them are brown.

[03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:49.930]
And some are gray.

[03:00:49.930 --> 03:00:52.230]
And some are gray.

[03:00:55.870 --> 03:00:58.670]
And one is six foot eight.

[03:01:01.470 --> 03:01:03.030]
And one of them is a girl.

[03:01:04.430 --> 03:01:07.130]

He does it self-termany.

[03:01:26.610 --> 03:01:28.630]
And a very special hustler.

[03:01:30.830 --> 03:01:33.070]
Who likes to tell you.

[03:01:33.210 --> 03:01:35.170]
He likes to see the light.

Things are looking down on the weekend.

[03:01:56.830 --> 03:02:00.490]
For the golden stage.

[03:02:01.450 --> 03:02:05.390]

[03:02:05.390 --> 03:02:07.430]
And the time of faith.

[03:02:07.430 --> 03:02:11.830]
I would vote for Reagan.

[03:02:12.570 --> 03:02:13.750]
For Reagan.

[03:02:14.270 --> 03:02:15.470]
It was hell today.

[03:02:16.130 --> 03:02:17.510]
It was hell today.

[03:02:18.610 --> 03:02:20.390]

[03:02:22.830 --> 03:02:24.790]
It's such a freaky state.

[03:02:30.230 --> 03:02:35.190]
MTV presents nine inch nails unplugged.

[03:02:37.270 --> 03:02:40.310]
I want a f**k you like an animal.

[03:02:40.910 --> 03:02:42.450]
