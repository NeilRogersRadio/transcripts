[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060]
Have a lovely day.

[00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.740]
Neil, I hope you have a great day as well.

[00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.240]
We have fun.

[00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.800]
Don't go running out of here without telling the truth.

[00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.640]
Don't be a pussy.

[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.020]
I know.

[00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.580]
I'm looking at people I know to worst out of the last minute.

[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.980]
How many people did you tell me off the air were really at that ballgame yesterday?

[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.920]
I want a number.

[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.620]
3000.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.260]
Okay.

[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.600]
And Skippy's mad at me because he didn't see the covered in boobs the other night at Sin City.

[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:25.040]
Yeah.

[00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.480]
I was covered in boobs, Neil.

[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:27.480]
You know the pressure I'm under.

[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.480]
Now all the religious groups are after me.

[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.700]
What a thought that is.

[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.620]
I'm moving in with the Jews, the Jews are mad.

[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.400]
I think Skippy likes to squeeze your boobs as a matter of fact that's what he told me.

[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.740]
Carlos, through your name and the sheriff used a broom handle on him.

[00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.200]
That's when it's your present.

[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.180]
He just came out in L'Oamah.

[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.140]
L'Oamah.

[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.920]
L'Oamah.

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.580]
Breakfast home.

[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.060]
Digima.

[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.980]
Okay.

[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.680]
L'Oamah.

[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.400]
I think Scott.

[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.800]
Have a lousy day, Neil.

[00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.820]
I think you know what?

[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.980]
This place without you is like having no water in your toilet.

[00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.260]
See you at the Marling game.

[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.700]
When you leave Miami, dude.

[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.920]
Everyone, that Clarence is pacing and speaking in tongues.

[00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.980]
What you're trying to say is the place is full of crap.

[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.380]
Is that what you're saying?

[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.080]
It's falling apart without you.

[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.340]
It's like having, it's like you're going to a surprise party and all the balloons have already popped.

[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.420]
Hey, if you're on the way out of the bus this morning folks, but he's still okay in my book.

[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.040]
See ya.

[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.920]
See you.

[00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.140]
Yeah.

[00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.660]
Hello.

[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.760]
Guess who.

[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.320]
Hello.

[00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.640]
Guess who.

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.800]
Guess who.

[00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140]
Well, answer me.

[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.000]
Hey, you just cost me $6,000.

[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.820]
What?

[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.620]
$6,000.

[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.600]
Really?

[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.060]
Yes.

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.180]
What can I do for you?

[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:35.700]
What time do you have?

[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.020]
It's 12.22.

[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.060]
That's right.

[00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.940]
Who is this?

[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.060]
What am I going to do this month?

[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.100]
Who is this?

[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.440]
My name is Richard Roma.

[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:44.800]
What can I do for you?

[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.340]
You just cost me $6,000.

[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.760]
I cost you $6.

[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.540]
Yes.

[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.100]
How?

[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.360]
Where were you last night?

[00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.940]
Where was I supposed to be?

[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.300]
You got the wrong number.

[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.000]
Ah!

[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.820]
What a big man you are!

[00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.460]
Hey, let me buy you a pack of gum.

[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.440]
I sure got a chew it.

[00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.660]
Ooh!

[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.680]
What a shit man!

[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.820]
Fuck you!

[00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.600]
Yeah, that's what you got to try so I can crack your fucking head.

[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.280]
Oh fuck you are!

[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.180]
Yeah.

[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.960]
Come down.

[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.360]
I've changed.

[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.580]
Where the fuck are you?

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.260]
Hello.

[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.840]
Where was I?

[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.740]
I was at home.

[00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.660]
Who is this?

[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.920]
Where is your line of trade?

[00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.920]
Stupid fucking fuck you idiot!

[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.860]
Look, I got to go before I get really mad and then I fucking hunt you down.

[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.940]
You fairy.

[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.700]
Yeah, you're fairy.

[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:23.960]
You fucking queer.

[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.760]
You're probably a month's service.

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.560]
I find out the fucking cousin you are.

[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.520]
I'm gonna go to him and figure out a way to have you all right.

[00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.220]
Fuck you!

[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.900]
Are you humiliated you?

[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.580]
Oh my god, I'm sorry.

[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.960]
I'll tell you what.

[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.060]
Fuck you all right, I quit.

[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.880]
Come down step.

[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.780]
Fuck you.

[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.800]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:40.860]
Yeah, tough on the phone.

[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.640]
Oh, everybody.

[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.180]
My wife's tough on the phone, so.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.420]
Did you see what I-

[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:45.040]
What are you good about it?

[00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.320]
I tell you what I'm gonna do about it.

[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.300]
I tell you what I'm gonna do about it.

[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.460]
Don't worry about what I'm gonna do about it.

[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.420]
You were saying.

[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.640]
I don't know who the fuck you are, but you're in for a big surprise.

[00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.580]
I'll tell you that, right?

[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.080]
That's right.

[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:54.660]
You don't know me, you prick.

[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:55.600]
Fuck you.

[00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:56.200]
What the fuck?

[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.860]
Yeah, I know.

[00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.840]
Yeah, I know.

[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.120]
You're fairing.

[00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.160]
I give you fair.

[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.840]
You're probably a fucking...

[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.100]
Fucking...

[00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.760]
Fuck sucker.

[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.240]
Oh man, I wish.

[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.160]
Well, all the trouble's in my life, I would like to beat your face.

[00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.860]
You know that.

[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.060]
Fuck you.

[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.160]

[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.340]
Fuck you.

[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.340]

[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.940]
Fuck you.

[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.160]
You're fucking run somebody else.

[00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.400]
That was special.

[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.980]
Absolutely.

[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.820]
It really was.

[00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.860]
Anyway, it's 10-05 and 5-60 for Ralph Remy out of the bus this morning.

[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.720]
I heard him.

[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.140]
I don't care what Neil Rogers says.

[00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.240]
We got a real big thing over the mall, and said,

[00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.280]
I don't care what Neil says.

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.060]
I'm about to beat him.

[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.980]
And you do the white care.

[00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.180]
Just the way it is, man.

[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.100]
You know, and I'm used to it.

[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.860]
I'm used to being blamed.

[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.960]
I get blamed for everything else.

[00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.060]
We used to have those t-shirts that it's Neil's fault.

[00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.420]
And then on the back, you know, if it rains,

[00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.840]
if your dog takes a crap on the carpet, it's Neil's fault.

[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.400]
I'm used to it.

[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.180]
I can handle it.

[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.860]
I got big fat broad shoulders.

[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.600]
And so if anybody doesn't go to a ball game or any other sporting event,

[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.540]
it must be my fault.

[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.060]
I'll take full blame for it.

[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.620]
Full blame.

[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.980]
Okay.

[00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.940]
So the, uh, uh, uh, you're a mean man.

[00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.700]
That's what Jacob said.

[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.240]
Yes, I am.

[00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.240]
And I'm proud to say it.

[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.380]
We got the couples contest number three is over.

[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.280]
As of this moment, I just declared it's over.

[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:08.700]
4101 votes is what I got.

[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.340]
That would you got?

[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.320]
Oh, maybe go back there now.

[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.740]
No, don't go back there.

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.140]
I just got it.

[00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.720]
Well, that's when I closed it out right at 10 o'clock.

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.660]
And we'll go from bottom to top and last place with 40 votes,

[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.360]
Jody and Kevin, it's that seepia thing.

[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.000]
And what the other guy said was, I call it way in last place.

[00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.900]
Sorry, guys.

[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.720]
But thanks to everybody who sent the pictures and participated.

[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.360]
Okay.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.160]
Thank you very much.

[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.980]
And we got another one coming up next month,

[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.540]
which will mostly be on your skinny shoulders.

[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.100]
Yeah.

[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.040]
Rich and Cheryl 72 in Sputter, Cheryl's, uh, gigantic, uh, impressive chest.

[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.820]
Dan and Sherry 79.

[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.040]
Captain Sing and his wife, 164.

[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.040]
We might have hooded for a captain Sing,

[00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.940]
but not enough dirty magazines last two months.

[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.700]
Vicki and Mick 172.

[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.120]
Danian Michelle 220.

[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.900]
They moved up nicely, but not really contending.

[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.800]
Ian and Jen 282.

[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.380]
Mike and Kristen 300.

[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.540]
I think they deserve a little more than that, don't you?

[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.880]
Yes.

[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.620]
Holly and Darren did well.

[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.040]
They had 344.

[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.800]
They came in, uh, fifth, fourth.

[00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.160]
What did they come in?

[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.600]
Fourth.

[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.000]
Fifth.

[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.720]
What?

[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.980]
Uh, and then I'm really surprised that this couple didn't do a little bit better.

[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.140]
Mary and Shane did well, 353, especially considering Mary's smiling breasts there.

[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.500]
I mean, gigantic smiling hooters, but...

[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:29.200]
And they...

[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.580]
Well, wait a minute.

[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.420]
Didn't they come in third?

[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:31.460]
No fourth.

[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:33.960]
So they get nothing but our best wishes.

[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.240]
Third, winning dinner at the pizza loft.

[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.180]
Greg and Stephanie 487.

[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.900]
And is that something they can come on a motorcycle?

[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.280]
Right.

[00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.860]
Not everybody can do that.

[00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.460]
Oh, seriously, the Suzuki is in the picture.

[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.320]
So you're all dressed up in your bike around fit?

[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:51.100]
Four free meals.

[00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.980]
He does look a little like Charlie Manson.

[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.220]
So nice going guys.

[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.720]
They came in third to get the dinner for two at the pizza loft.

[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.900]
Second place, Brian and Natasha who pulled it out.

[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.200]
And Miguel was in it if they would have shown the other picture.

[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.040]
Natasha would have had the breast showing there.

[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.140]
And they would probably could have given them a run for the money to our winners.

[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.460]
Although I see she's wearing a top.

[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.120]
Well, maybe she had like a little surprise in it.

[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.160]
Maybe she had like openings.

[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.080]
Oh, that we can...

[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.900]
Brian and Natasha, 510, they get second place.

[00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.840]
So in other words, they get either the trip...

[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.480]
Whatever the first place couple didn't want.

[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.280]
Which is a bad way to put it, isn't it?

[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.620]
No.

[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.820]
Because the first place couple gets the three day to night stay for two at the Royal O'Racist.

[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.120]
We sort in casino at the Bahamas with round trip airfare.

[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.720]
And they're on like your air or...

[00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:35.820]
Or three night two day stay.

[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.880]
And that is correct by the way.

[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.820]
Three night two day stay at the Fertuita,

[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.280]
Heedonism, 2 or 3 in Jamaica, including transfers, food, drink,

[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.400]
Fertuita is entertainment nowhere.

[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.980]
So the winning couple gets the pick, whatever they want.

[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.680]
And the second place couple, which is Brian and what's your name?

[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:49.680]
What's your name, Stephanie?

[00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.980]
And Natasha, they get whatever is left over, which is not bad.

[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.740]
And the winning couple, just smashing the competition,

[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.500]
Frank and Liz, a 1,068 vote.

[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.000]
Shocking, which means that they have a lot of friends and a lot of freepers.

[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.840]
And they did very nicely.

[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:06.060]
Congratulations guys.

[00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.800]
And Miguel, I'm sure you'll be probably not only calling to let them know,

[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.180]
but probably wanting to go along.

[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.140]
Yeah, sure, why not?

[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.720]
But you just kick his ass out of there.

[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.340]
He is, dude.

[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.360]
Just your brutal.

[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:20.060]
You just woke him up.

[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.700]
This morning got him out of bed.

[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.160]
That's what he pissed off about.

[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.320]
By the way, Carlos was in jail over the weekend.

[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.060]
Oh!

[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.700]
Let's hear it.

[00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:31.920]
See, the audience thinks we're making this up about this kid that we got who just can't get his life straightened out.

[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.940]
No, no, you see your laughing.

[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:33.620]
I'm crying.

[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.280]
I'm under verge.

[00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.640]
It takes a lot to get me to cry, but he's got me right on the edge.

[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.060]
And we want, right now on behalf of Little Beanervoir,

[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.560]
we want to apologize to the audience.

[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.340]
We have a very loyal bunch of people over there.

[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.380]
We like to try to find out what's going on in our website.

[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.100]
On our used to be very prestigious website until this weekend.

[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.680]
But unfortunately, Carlos was otherwise detained.

[00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.560]
And I think detained is the operative word in this case.

[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.040]
Little wreck out there on a highway.

[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.920]
And you know, he's got one story and the other person got the other story.

[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.560]
And then of course, he just happened to be driving without a license,

[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.540]
without a valid driver's license,

[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.600]
and created a little bit of a problem for himself.

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.020]
So the bedtime stories didn't get on our Saturday.

[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.920]
The ones that I worked feverishly to send him,

[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.520]
didn't get out there Sunday because he was otherwise detained.

[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.980]
And who knows what's going to happen today.

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:22.780]
We did send him along a bunch of really good stuff.

[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.160]
Didn't even get the great Steven story on there from Saturday,

[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.400]
which I have right here, thank goodness.

[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.020]
Maybe it was my psychic abilities again.

[00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.380]
Maybe I had the foresight to realize that I should bring that up here with me,

[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.660]
because he probably would screw up again.

[00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.740]
The man just can't, he is light.

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.780]
What did I tell you? Life challenged.

[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.720]
Life is a challenge for Beanervoir.

[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.120]
It's not just the keys.

[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:45.880]
It's not just, you know, can't find his ass with both hands.

[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.380]
It's just everything in his life is a major crisis.

[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.280]
You think he's listening right now?

[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.620]
Yes.

[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.960]
Well, good.

[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.860]
We like him a lot, okay?

[00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.620]
He does a great job on the website, but...

[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:02.160]
But he's like backing himself in a way in inextricable position.

[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:02.860]
You know what I mean?

[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.060]
No, what do you mean?

[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.720]
Kind of like when the beast gets down on all fours and clearance leaks up in behind him.

[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.340]
And it's like an inextricable one, especially for the beast.

[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.360]
Once he gets down on all fours, it's going to take months before he gets back up again.

[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.240]
He needs to find something vertical to climb up on.

[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:16.040]
Back to him.

[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:16.620]
Yeah.

[00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:21.220]
So Farrell also told me he's going to work feverishly on getting clearance laid,

[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.780]
but I doubt it.

[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.160]
And the interesting part of it is I think you may have been right.

[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.840]
I don't want to say what you were saying on Friday, because I thought that was really in very poor taste.

[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.400]
Go ahead.

[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.880]
I don't want to say it.

[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.040]
You said you were the one making all kinds of implicates.

[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.100]
The hell I was, next year you're going to be doing to him the same thing that Tom Jigger claims I did to Craig Stevens,

[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.980]
the paperboy.

[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.560]
How's he doing?

[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.540]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:39.860]

[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.540]
Tom, once again, full of crap.

[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:42.920]
Don't have your facts straight.

[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.700]
But thanks for mentioning me in the newspaper again.

[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.200]
Look at that.

[00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.020]
It's going to be a brutal week.

[00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:50.220]
See, this is usually the week that I'm gone.

[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:55.220]
I start that summer gig this week, the 20th of June, and somehow I screwed up this week this year.

[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.600]
Because I know the audience have much rather have you talked about the Michelle Gillens ass.

[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:01.640]
Who?

[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.060]
And Michelle Gillen and Dwight Lauderdale's mustache.

[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.500]
But, you know, I'll do the best I can.

[00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.780]
And I will read another sentence from Hillary Clinton's book.

[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:12.220]
Let's hear it now that I'm back here in a real civilized place.

[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.980]
I'll read one more sentence.

[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:18.320]
This is the only place in the world where you'll hear the Hillary book read on the radio one sentence at a time.

[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.980]
Should I do that right now?

[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.520]
Okay, sure.

[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.400]
Let's get it over with.

[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:22.580]

[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.500]
Let's get out of the way because we got to deal with the pull from the weekend again.

[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.520]
We got to deal with the new pull, which we're going to be building maybe, but I doubt it.

[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.600]
Here we go.

[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.520]
Listen carefully.

[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:38.220]
I came of age on the crest of tumultuous social change and took part in the political battle spot over the meaning of America and its role in the world.

[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:38.900]
All right.

[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.860]
Nice going swallowing.

[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.200]
That's it.

[00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.940]
Now, the sentence tomorrow.

[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.380]
See, it gives you a chance to like absorb it better.

[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.620]
One sentence at a time.

[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.100]
Very slowly, very carefully.

[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.140]
So what are you going to be buying a Hillary book or Harry Potter or both?

[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.840]
You know, I'll probably have to wind up spending money on that Harry Potter book as I have a teen child that reads that swill.

[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:07.220]
From minutes after 10, I want to mention before you forget that Bob Eisenhower, that burger is a major asshole, but that aside.

[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.300]
That aside.

[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.300]
Now what time, Crowley only said that aside.

[00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:21.040]
Barbercuse Galore carries the biggest range of Weber grills and accessories you've ever seen in your life, starting with the Weber's Smokey Joe portable charcoal grill for under 28 bucks.

[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.480]
It's the perfect grill for any July 4th picnic or any picnic any time.

[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.880]
And nobody can beat Barbercuse Galore's incredible, unbeatable selection of top quality grills.

[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:40.600]
They carry a full on of grills, including Weber, Viking, Jen Air, Braille made, and lots of exclusive grills that you won't find no place else like Turbo, Barbercuse chef, Cook on a Captain Cook all at the guaranteed lowest prices in the universe.

[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:46.300]
And right now take advantage of no payment, same as cash financing until January 2004 on approved credit.

[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:50.360]
This week take only amazing three burner Cook on grill, a Barbercuse Galore exclusive.

[00:11:50.780 --> 00:12:01.880]
This one comes with a host of great features, normally only found on much more expensive grills like 42,000 powerful BTUs, porcelain coated cast iron burners and cooking grills, and a generous 625 square inch cooking area.

[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.040]
You just won't find another grill like it, nowhere for the price, now only 349 bucks, and only at Barbercuse Galore.

[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.100]
Perfect like I said for that July 4th, Cook out and all the other ones too.

[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:14.960]
Don't forget Barbercuse Galore's America's best Barbercuse store with stores and plantation,

[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:27.180]
an university driving a prestigious fountain shopping center called 954-423-1400, and also in Crossbrings Corner Sample in Rock Island Roads called 954-75-76668.

[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.420]
Barbercuse Galore, all the top brands, unbeatable everyday prices, everything you need for a Barbercuse.

[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:38.180]
My life and look all, this is sports real 560, you weigh in.

[00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.800]
You're a bastard.

[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:49.180]
You approach a beautiful woman's car, she will not let you in, because she has a snub.

[00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:51.440]
Get outta here you dog.

[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.600]
Look I told you I don't want you near me, okay?

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.360]
I told you I don't want my weird shield clean, I don't need my car clean, I need you to clean, I want you to get paid.

[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.300]
No, it's up to do.

[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.680]
Because let me tell you something, I know you trying to pick me up, I know it, I know it for a fat dog.

[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:13.940]
1017-560-WQM Happy Monday to avoid this sunny and smoking here, like about 90.

[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.160]
It is smoldering, got a smog alert already, but it's not humid like there, it's not suffocating.

[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:25.720]
Now let me just see if my psychic powers are working, this call on line 9, that's his Miami, I bet you I know who it is.

[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.160]
Okay.

[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.920]
WQA, I'm hello.

[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.120]
Hey Neil, good morning.

[00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:30.260]
Is this you?

[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:31.660]
No, no.

[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.780]
It's not the chronic?

[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:33.680]
No.

[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.580]
Are you black?

[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:35.280]
Yes.

[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.020]
It's you.

[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.300]
See I told you, I know who that is.

[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:41.560]
That's a guy that calls 8 million times an ed, just bitch them out on Friday.

[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:46.500]
Just bitch them out on Friday, I said get out of here, he's the one that's faxed me under two different names.

[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:51.580]
Calls on line 9, which I have no idea why since he's got all the other lines you could call on.

[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:56.560]
It's kind of like holding up a banner saying hey I'm the chronic asshole, I'll be on line 9.

[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.020]
What did I tell you?

[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.860]
Do I know my crap or what?

[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:00.780]
You got it.

[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.100]
I know my crap.

[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.060]
And you know something?

[00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:09.320]
I don't know my crap as well as I thought I did because the pool I was going to take, tell Eric to put that one on the back burner.

[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.740]
I mean it's not a bad pool, but I got a much better one, you just fact me from a listener.

[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:13.960]
Don't you like this one much better?

[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.140]

[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:15.020]
Oh yeah.

[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.120]
Especially on the heels of that tack he's Johnson business.

[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.520]
And he's got my pick right up front and center.

[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.240]
Really?

[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:21.800]
Mm-hmm.

[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:23.600]
Okay so here's the pool for today.

[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.820]
Oh I better do the other one.

[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:28.500]
I'm so enthused that somebody asked, well let me just tell you something.

[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.760]
Okay you know as well as I do, especially since you're so bad on pools anyway.

[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:33.180]
Yeah.

[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:37.800]
Come up with something new and exciting and interesting, a different pool every day on the show,

[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:42.220]
which we try to do because we used to take some pride in our website till Carlos got busted over the weekend.

[00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.900]
But up until that point we used to take a lot of pride in, but to come up with something new and different every day is like,

[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.880]
uh, just mind boggling.

[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:51.680]
Mind boggling.

[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.540]
Oh you know I was thinking about during the break.

[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:54.960]
I give up.

[00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.580]
I was thinking about the fact that Miguel, see it's kind of like one of those damned if you do and damned if you don't.

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:03.360]
On the one hand we know he's not too crazy about sitting in there and answering the calls and screening.

[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.100]
But on the other hand it keeps him away from Doreen back there in promotions.

[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.140]
It's a mixed blessing.

[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.220]
So it's a mixed bag.

[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:14.340]
A mixed bag and I was wondering to myself if Doreen like ever has like put her hands on Miguel.

[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:14.760]
You know what I mean?

[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.840]
You thought I wanted to say because we know she wants him desperately and he's very angry.

[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.000]
I don't want to hear that.

[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.720]
That's a cop out.

[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.680]
We don't play that game anymore.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:23.820]
Why don't I hear that question?

[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:24.760]
I beg your pardon?

[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:25.420]
He could.

[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.280]
Yeah, he could.

[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:26.820]
He could.

[00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.220]
But he won't.

[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.280]
Has he got something in his mouth?

[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.420]
His tongue.

[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.100]
Yeah.

[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.620]
And he's biting it and there's blood dripping out of his chin.

[00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.380]
Yeah, there's something dripping out of his chin.

[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.920]
I'm sure of that.

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.040]
Well, okay.

[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.040]
He won't answer the question.

[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.240]
But I guarantee you she's probably grabbing a cheek here and there and you know like Pat.

[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:45.320]
Nice job, Miguel.

[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:46.980]
Good job out there today in the event.

[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.760]
You know, she talks a little bit like she talks a little bit like for real.

[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.160]
This morning I thought you had a bunch of bookers on your nose.

[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:54.880]
But anyway.

[00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:58.940]
So on a poll from Friday, 1834 votes.

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.620]
Which of these are you most sick and tired of hearing about?

[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.160]
We asked.

[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:06.220]
Now see the first category I'm assuming I should probably explain it a little bit better

[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.080]
although it did very well anyway in one by a landslide.

[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:14.040]
I'm assuming the reality TV shows includes all of these star wannabes, you know,

[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.920]
little boy and girl stars and teenage star.

[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.120]
What do they call those?

[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:19.780]
Yeah, all of those.

[00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.160]
Yeah, I'm sure that's what we're talking about.

[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.260]
Are my right?

[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:24.840]
Absolutely.

[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:25.240]
Okay.

[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.700]
Reality TV shows 389.

[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.160]
389.

[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.200]
I mean, winning hands down.

[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.180]
Scott Lacey Peterson 230.

[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.180]
Nice job, Eric, correcting my bad spelling.

[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.780]
Thank you about trying me to something.

[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:42.700]
The Hillary book 203 weapons weapons of we better not piss off Eric now with the limbo status of Carlos.

[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.180]
You know what?

[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.520]
We better start sucking up the Eric big time.

[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.800]
Because if we lose the old man, I mean, if we lose Carlos.

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.000]
Hillary book 203 weapons of mass destruction 195.

[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:54.420]
New Harry Potter book 170.

[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:55.980]
Oh my god.

[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.820]
They're selling that thing like it was had like an $100 bill inside of your book.

[00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:00.240]
Right.

[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:01.460]
You never see anything like that.

[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:02.880]
No, it's embarrassing.

[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.060]
I mean, look, on a one hand, no, on several hands.

[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.700]
First of all, if kids are reading, even if it is crap, at least it keeps them off the streets.

[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.140]
And number two, it's good for commerce.

[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.200]
It's good for the economy.

[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:16.080]
Somebody's buying something, right?

[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:16.820]
Okay.

[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.060]
I'm trying to look on the bright side.

[00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.000]
Oh, the car's reading good.

[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.220]
Martha Stewart 147.

[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.380]
The Middle East Road map 142.

[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:26.120]
It's a little rocky.

[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.280]
I guess they missed all those mines in the middle of the road, all those landbines.

[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.680]
Then they give a little shot at me here, although it's very close.

[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.680]
Neal's movie shows 119, 6.4%.

[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.120]
How hot Jackie Johnson, the Channel 7 weather babe is 116.

[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.020]
So like three votes spread there.

[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:44.380]
The Florida Marlins only 58.

[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:45.460]
They love those marlins.

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.760]
They're just too cheap to go see them.

[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.040]
How about that Don Trelegan there, Miguel?

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:50.560]
Good stuff.

[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.560]
Good stuff.

[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.200]
Another shot.

[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.640]
I don't even know what's a rain short in game.

[00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:54.680]
The kid is a dynamite.

[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:55.200]
Nobody cares.

[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.360]
They're 15,000 announced, which means Saturday maybe there was like 10 or 12.

[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.740]
I'm really proud of Ferrell, though.

[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.640]
I'll butcher it up and admitting.

[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:02.760]
Well, I backed him into a corner.

[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.300]
Admitting on the year there are a few minutes ago that there was only 3,000 people there yesterday.

[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680]
Maybe nobody saw him throughout the first pitch.

[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.360]
Yeah, and that's what he's pissed off about.

[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.180]
He don't care if you support the Marlins enough, but his ego is wounded badly.

[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.540]
Nobody was there to see him throughout the first pitch.

[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.960]
And you people, when you see him throw it, he can bring it.

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:19.560]
Bring it.

[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:22.700]
He got 45 and the matrix will need 20.

[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.720]
Nobody said like you said, that's pass A anyway.

[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.060]
So that was a pull from the weekend.

[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.960]
We had a phenomenal response and spotted the fact that we had those lame old bedtime stories on it.

[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:31.620]
I was sad.

[00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.400]
Somebody owes us a big apology, you know what?

[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:35.620]
Oh yeah.

[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:36.720]
Yeah, him.

[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:41.400]
No, not you see, I don't want to get into a whole thing and air his dirty laundry on here.

[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:41.740]
Do I?

[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:42.500]
No, I'm not sure.

[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:47.520]
I don't want to do it too much, but there comes a point where some things are cute.

[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.140]
You know what I mean?

[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:55.040]
Like if you have an uncle who's always a little bit drunk, a little angry, but then if the uncle starts like stealing stuff out of your house,

[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.580]
and the uncle winds up in jail and you have to keep going out and bailing him out,

[00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:01.520]
and it keeps progressing in like a, you know, kind of like in a certain movie we saw.

[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.420]
Right.

[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:02.840]
You know what I mean?

[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.000]
Oh, I damn it.

[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:05.140]
I don't either.

[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.100]
It starts spiraling out of control.

[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.000]
So it goes from I can't find my keys and I lock myself out of my apartment and my computer just blew up.

[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.200]
And it just keeps like a gigantic snowball going downhill.

[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:22.620]
So I would suggest that somebody just kind of like slow down a little bit.

[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.900]
Maybe if you'd stop giving it in the red pills and give them the purple ones, you know, it'd be better.

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:30.100]
He needs a few doggy downers just to calm down.

[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.200]
I'm serious.

[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.260]
The man is out of control.

[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:40.140]
He is spinning out of control to the point where his life is just, he's the kind of guy you will find under the overpass in a couple of months

[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:41.900]
if he doesn't just calm down a little bit.

[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:42.320]
Okay.

[00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.320]
And even though he is working three, four hundred hours a week, I see he doesn't realize I can hear through that glass one under.

[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.900]
Even when I'm not directly here through it.

[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:52.040]
Right.

[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.960]
So I heard that cost of a little comment.

[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.400]
And of course you and I are trying to take extra good care of him and slipping a little on the side, you know, and plus all the drugs you're supplying him.

[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.620]
So what the, and plus he's getting laid now is getting action from Treasure Island.

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.700]
What more does he want?

[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.900]
So life should be sweet.

[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:05.720]
But no.

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.720]
Everything is a major crisis.

[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.000]
I know people like that.

[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.580]
Oh gee, my driver's license expired.

[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.260]
How much effort does it take to open up your wallet?

[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.780]
Take a look on your God damn license and see when it expires.

[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.980]
How much effort does that take Carlos?

[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.300]
You little pimple head?

[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.740]
Or that?

[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:22.520]
Yeah.

[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.480]
Sippled in?

[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.360]
Goopal.

[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:27.140]
I hit so many damn, I had such great stories.

[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:28.560]
I packed them on Saturday morning.

[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:30.360]
I wonder what the hell is going on here now?

[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.600]
What is going on?

[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.200]
Saturday?

[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.600]
I see nothing new on a website.

[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:36.960]
Sunday comes Sunday goes I come up here.

[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:38.900]
I look on a website saying we'll tired crap.

[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.660]
I'm embarrassed.

[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.380]
I'm humiliated.

[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.380]
We own apology to the masses out there.

[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:48.260]
All 20 or 30 people who really see it's interesting that nobody reads the bedtime stories anymore.

[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.460]
They just want to see naked pictures.

[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.280]
Will you kill that damn stuff?

[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:52.940]
Starting to get me nervous about him.

[00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:54.360]
No, seriously, I think he is.

[00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.560]
He's Sarah Goldfarb Jr.

[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.740]
He's Sarah Goldfarb Jr.

[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.000]
Maybe she's been reincarnated.

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.000]
Now when his hair starts turning real white.

[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.300]
White and short.

[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.060]
Okay, here's the new pool.

[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.140]
I like this pool a lot.

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.200]
This should get a response.

[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:08.880]
Showed off.

[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.780]
You think?

[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:10.300]
Yeah.

[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.800]
Which overrated hot.

[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.640]
Well, I see this is not word of the ideally.

[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:17.060]
Perfectly.

[00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.100]
But I think whoever sent me to pull very much.

[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:23.040]
Which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog.

[00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:23.840]
I like that.

[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:25.560]
What's not to like?

[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.080]
Absolutely.

[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.640]
Sarah and here's the list of they sent so far.

[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.420]
Sarah Jessica Parker.

[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:33.120]
Sarah Jessica Parker.

[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.480]

[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:34.660]
Pepperica.

[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:36.560]
Gloria Estefan.

[00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.520]
Now whoever said that she was hot.

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:39.860]
Emilio.

[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.140]
No, he didn't.

[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.860]
He said, oh, are you kidding me?

[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.460]
Somebody must have just.

[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.120]
I'm guaranteed he never said that.

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:47.840]
You know what he said there?

[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.380]
You bitch.

[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:49.320]
You slut.

[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:50.140]
You wore.

[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.620]
Hopefully in a slight little register.

[00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.420]
Mariah Carey with her one large abreast.

[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.940]
You know, I love seeing the way things go down.

[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.840]
You know, sooner or later there is justice.

[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.600]
Sometimes you have to wait a long time for her.

[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.940]
Her album was a flop.

[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.460]
Her album is art selling.

[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.660]
She's desperate to try to rebuild her image.

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.800]
But we still says he wouldn't touch it with Miguel's hand.

[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.300]
How do you like that?

[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.440]
And Jackie's Johnson.

[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.640]
We don't want to be picking on Jackie.

[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.520]
Two pulls in a row.

[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:14.000]
But why not?

[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:15.880]
Since he's the centerpiece of so much attention.

[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.160]
Did we ever get Miguel's take on Jackie Johnson?

[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:21.280]
He's on the phone right now.

[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:22.840]
What do you mean he's on the phone?

[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:23.660]
He's so hot.

[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:23.980]

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.040]

[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.040]

[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.060]
He's so hot.

He's so hot.

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.220]

[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:49.480]
He's so hot.

[00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:16.880]

[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:17.620]
Hey.

[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:17.620]

[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:17.880]
Hey.

[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:17.880]

[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:21.660]
Hey.

[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:23.640]
Hey.

[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.640]

[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.640]

[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:23.640]

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.060]

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.060]

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.060]

[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:24.060]

[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.640]
Let's go make one y'all big story major bulletin belt adjust a

[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:27.740]
Y.

[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.740]
What

[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:28.900]
What

[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:31.940]
So, Supreme Court allows use of race and law school's admissions.

[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.940]
The Supreme Court just moments ago upheld the University Law School admissions policy

[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.920]
to give minorities an edge ruling that race can be one of many factors that colleges consider

[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:41.960]
when selecting their students.

[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.160]
The ruling in the law school case preserved the concept of affirmative action for minorities

[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.160]
who might otherwise be underrepresented on top campuses, but makes it clear that racial

[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.200]
preferences must be used sparingly.

[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:55.860]
In other words, if they can play basketball real good and sign them up.

[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.640]
The five-to-four ruling endorsed the program at the University of Michigan Law School

[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.440]
meant to ensure a critical mass of minorities on campus.

[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.200]
The program is not an legal quote of the high court said.

[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:09.240]
A companion ruling testing that constitutionally of another more overtly preferential affirmative

[00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:12.160]
action program for minority applicants was also expected today.

[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:16.720]
Government has a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity on campus, and the law school

[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.120]
plan is narrowly focused on that goal that Court majority said.

[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.880]
The ruling by a vote of five to four may declare that racial preferences have to be used

[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:23.980]
sparingly.

[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.820]
The high court said the Michigan program does not amount to an illegal quote.

[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:27.420]
How do you like that?

[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:27.860]
You like it?

[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:28.100]
No.

[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.380]
No.

[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:28.460]
No.

[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:28.480]

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:28.700]

[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:28.700]

[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:29.300]
No.

[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:30.620]
No.

[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:30.800]
No.

[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:30.880]

[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:30.880]

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:30.920]

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:30.920]

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:30.920]

[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:30.920]

[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.980]

[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.980]

[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.980]

[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.340]
No.

[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:31.720]

[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.000]
No.

[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:32.720]
No.

[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.000]
No.

[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:49.920]
No.

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.220]

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.220]

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:50.220]

[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.580]
No, but you're right.

[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.660]
No.

[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:02.760]
I don't rent less cigarettes.

[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:02.780]
No.

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:02.780]

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:02.780]

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:02.780]

[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:10.980]
Did they hear that right?

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:16.420]
Representing me again. Okay, so in other words you said you said that he is a monogamy late all it cares about his sports

[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:22.460]
That's it. That's what I said his life is rich and full no no that's what I said no, and that's what I meant no

[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.720]
Everybody's horny, okay even sports nerds are horny

[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.900]
Like there are less people that they're so into unless he's getting some in the locker room

[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.420]
Which we don't know about unless that maybe the answer others now that was what you were trying to say now

[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:39.320]
You try to like color your choice. Yes, you are swishful

[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.600]
You're doing the same thing the clearance to poor clearance our program director

[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.680]
Then I'm accused of doing the Craig Stevens who now finally came out of the closet anyway. How's he doing? Oh, we're fine

[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:51.780]
White theater

[00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.060]
He wears those shirts

[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:01.060]
Well, here's another bulletin 1200 is plenty evacuated in Florida this morning a lot of cranco in on you know

[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:03.540]
Oh, yeah, well, that's why I'm on the internet a lot here

[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.780]
There's something about being here because when I was there I was able to do this so I don't know

[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.600]
Easily probably because this stuff here works a lot better. Oh you think but now during the breaks

[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.960]
I can actually go online here and check out some of these stories see what else going on

[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.780]
12 Delta airline passengers suffered minor injuries this morning when they're Boeing

[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:26.020]
757 had to be evacuated into in a fireball shot from the engine when it was started in Tampa. Oh

[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:32.320]
Delta flight 1036 from Tampa to Atlanta was leaving the gate of Tampa International Airport about 715 this morning

[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:38.320]
When the pilots noticed the small fireball shoot from an engine when it was turned on said billway to Tampa

[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.300]
Fire Department spokesman about 170 people were on the plane a way to hear this

[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.880]
The evacuation shoots were deployed in some passenger sprained ankles and other minor injuries when they slid down

[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.260]
They were taking a hospital for treatment. So in other words, they had to slide down the old shoots. Oh

[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:53.580]
shoes

[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.020]
Airports spokeswoman Brenda Gage Gagahann

[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:01.340]
Gaghaegan said the fire was extinguished in that's her name, okay

[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:06.860]
Said the fire was extinguished immediately. She said the remaining passengers would be put on another flight

[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.080]
I'm sure they'll be real anxious to get out of the Delta flight when you think so right away. Yeah

[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:14.500]
Oh, yeah, put me on that one over there. Let's see if this one will take off

[00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:16.260]
Let's go we can get this turkey off the ground

[00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:19.680]
I'm up to do that one by the way the good news speaking of airlines

[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.380]
I want my good friend Helen in the whole world to know that I'm very delighted. She's changed her mind

[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.860]
She's not gonna be terrier in a couple weeks not till the end of the year at least and then she'll probably we think that anyway

[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:30.640]
See I thought she was getting squeezed out. You know what all this air can of the crap

[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:31.840]
But she's not

[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.380]
Which I found out yesterday at the airport so nice going Helen. Are you hanging there?

[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:40.660]
I want to see her at least two three more times before she decides to hang it up. She's a sweetheart

[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.420]
She's one of the really nice people in South Florida not too many of them

[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.920]
But when you find when you just grab on to them and squeeze as hard as you can that's what Doreen said

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.900]
Absolutely, yeah, that's what she said Miguel boy. That's how he's still got it though. He runs like a son of a bitch

[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:06.380]
That's why he wears that marlins outfit. I think he's like on a team or something runs like a maniac up and down a hall just evading her clutches

[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.800]
Okay, oh also before we get to the appool

[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.700]
Police in California probe suspicious truck. You see that surround I'm sure you did yeah

[00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:19.720]
They kept showing that truck and they're looking and they're sniffing around it now wait till you hear how the

[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.600]
Vontid associated press I want you to listen to the first paragraph

[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.660]
It sounds like it was written by somebody in a trailer park listen the way they wrote this

[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:34.820]
Authorities early today investigated a big rig truck parked near the Burbank airport after having gotten a tip that a truck driver was headed to town

[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.360]
Possibly with terrorism in mind

[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:38.880]
He was headed to town

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.740]
Terrorists are coming to town catch you here now I

[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:50.940]
Can't well what kind of a sense is that after having gotten a tip that a truck driver was headed to town

[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:56.160]
Possibly with terrorism in mind. I mean, I understand they treat the American people like morons and

[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.420]
Most of them are did you see I don't want to go in with the test results

[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:03.760]
I'm not talking about the Florida ones like nation-wide. I mean people are just so dumb. It's scary

[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:06.540]
Yeah, they're dumb and where did I see it last week?

[00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.760]
They were asking that they went into a shopping mall somewhere not in Florida. Thank God

[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:14.660]
I would have been too embarrassing for us and they were asking who the vice- Oh, I know where was it was on a game show channel

[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.580]
Remember I told you that thing they were showing the bloopers right and in the middle of that show

[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:24.820]
They went out they took a mic and they went into a some shopping mall and we're asking who the vice president was like

[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:31.660]
The current vice-president. Yes. Yes. This was recently done and the closest somebody in some guy got was a dick

[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:36.480]
That's the supposed to guy so I think the vice president's a dick dick Nick and then Bob you bank said yeah, you're right

[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.940]
No, no seriously that nobody knew what his name was and

[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.800]
Don't tell me out of sight out of mind. Okay. We're dealing with really stupid stupid stupid people

[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:50.820]
The truck is on a road on the city border with Los Angeles near the northeast section of the LA X Airport

[00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:56.560]
It was parked next to a so-called fuel farm where tens of thousands of gallons of aircraft fuel is stored

[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:04.100]
We're investigating possible explosives on a park tractor trailer near the Burbank Airborne said an LA police officer who said he was too busy to give his name

[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:10.460]
TV news helicopter showed officers walking closely to the truck no driver was visible in the officers were not wearing protective gear

[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.020]
Maybe a bad mistake

[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:17.640]
So they got they were tipped off by a unknown caller from Texas from someplace in Texas

[00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.640]
He said he used to work with the driver the truck and that the driver's motives had to do with the war on terrorism

[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.880]
How do you like that?

[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.220]
The Burbank Glendale pass any airports north south runway was closed with their traffic ever to the east-west runway instead

[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:31.160]
Passed your trains were prohibited from stopping at the airport

[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.380]
So they're still checking it out as we speak

[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.280]
Okay, let me do the break

[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.280]
And then I'm sure we're gonna get tons and tons of calls at least four or five. Hey, look

[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.720]
I can't help it. There's just nobody there now, you know, whatever it is it is ghost town

[00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:48.880]
And to show you what a backstabber the beast is hey, I don't want for all

[00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:52.700]
I'm sure for else not listening on the way back to Boka right now. Don't listen Scott turn it off

[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:59.140]
You know he comes in there sucking him out with us because I was telling him about how far off through me under the bus with that Marlin comment

[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:04.380]
He only had two calls. He only had two calls the whole first 40 minutes. No, no, he said three

[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:09.500]
Or whatever the hell he said, okay, why would why would somebody who suck a suck and so hard in there?

[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.820]
You see what I mean about that waddling tub of crap

[00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:16.280]
He's a waddling tub of crap the beast man. You're not fooling me. He had a school for a little while

[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:24.600]
He had to pull over our eyes. This is the beast. Yeah, what a oh just cross-pollinating man from one room to the other

[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.680]
Rent a Yenta that's him

[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:36.080]
22-11 at five sit and believe me if he had three calls in 40 minutes, it's a lot more than we're probably gonna get

[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.040]
They love him. They love you Scott. Just clean up your act

[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:41.620]
That's another thing we got to talk about is about his vulgar language

[00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:48.600]
So you didn't so let's clarify this now you didn't say your thought clearance was a fang is that is that correct?

[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.240]
That's correct like some people have drug

[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:58.240]
Interests that supersede any kind of sexual interest. Yeah, that's enough for them. So in other words, sports is his drug correct

[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.660]
That's I that's not what you said

[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.600]
Hey, I'll tell you what ought to be you're not a drug

No, here's how Jennifer Lopez and Chris Judd spent their wedding night. I can't believe it. I cannot believe it. Why you saying it?

[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:45.960]
Why you saying that? I can't believe it. Well, I can't eat it. I'm in a marriage. Yeah, we're married. You're so beautiful. I know. You're so successful. I know. You're so rich. I know. I can't believe it.

[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.860]
Why do you keep saying it like that? Because I can't believe I'm married you. I know. I can't believe I'm married

[00:36:51.860 --> 00:37:06.280]
J-Won't I can't believe it? Why can't you believe it? Look at you. You're a bone broke man. Did you spare the side meat for six months? No, we're alone. You did something to me. No. You did something to me. No. You're what's on me my cocoa?

[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:27.820]
You can't go cocoa. Look at yourself. Look at yourself. I had puppy in my bed. I had puppy in my bed. I can do something. Who cares? I had puppy in my bed. What did I do? I'm sorry. Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't like crying. But I love you. I'm gonna sit on you with my biggest.

[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.020]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:34.000]
I don't want to.

[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.040]
Can't believe it. I got called puppies.

[00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:47.180]
Jennifer Lopez and Chris Judd spent their wedding night. I like to be in her boy's life. It's, uh, J-ト has never seen a penis in her life.

[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:56.060]
garantiine, I just, you know, it's just my personal opinion. Just like your comments about bookurance that's not to say he couldn't be there but on that

[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:02.000]
Oh, so in other words now you're covering your ass a little bit back. Oh, now you're hedging your bets

[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.860]
There's nothing wrong with that right. No, not that there's anything wrong with that of course

[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.580]
J. Lo she belongs on the list right?

[00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:13.220]
Absolutely. Oh, what?

[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.040]
She doesn't belong on the list. She certainly does. Oh come on Miguel

[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:24.240]
I mean you were doing so well with Jackie's Johnson. You think J. Lo is hot. She's hot. I'm sorry

[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:31.920]
Her ass is hot. Yeah, it's about 99.6 facts. You might have SARS. I think it's 100.3

[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:39.280]
But her push man she has a nasty butch ducky push she looks like a boxer isn't that her nickname?

[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.240]
That's what the bad athlete calls her ducky push

[00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.380]
Even mommy has to come over once a week to change your diapers

[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:52.500]
But anyway now see that's bad now you're starting to make and especially on the heels of this Craig Stevens to rain a Sun

[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.440]
Assembly other day you mean your heart which which would have been on our website

[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:02.480]
I started from the fact that Carlos is like no look the audience probably thinks we're exaggerating just like they thought I was

[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.120]
Exaggerating about what an asshole Moe is which I was not exaggerating was I know

[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.240]
They'll oh yeah, that's so funny that can try to convert. There's nothing contrived about it

[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.160]
We don't play that game. That's a wrong show. Okay. That's mr. Ego wrong station wrong show

[00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:20.640]
We don't need any contract controversy on this station believe me. We got more than enough crap going on real stuff

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:25.280]
Holding back lots as yeah, yeah, if you only knew the stuff that doesn't get on the year

[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.280]
Like about the time Doreen got Miguel backed up against the corner up in the hallway there but anyway

[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.140]
Uh WSVN anchor to serve in gay pride parade

[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:38.740]
This is by Tonja. I guess this is from Saturday Sun Sentinel

[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.840]
I flipped it out because I knew somehow the back of my mind that be near boy would screw up our website nice going you little twit

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.940]
And by the way if it's not too late, I'm canceling that chick, but I guess it's probably too late. No

[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:51.760]
Now you think not it's too calling my bank

[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.260]
In fact, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave instructions that if anybody with that name ever tries to cash you check again

[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:00.500]
Just to forgive just life in his face call a cops

[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:06.660]
Tom jicca writes my good friend Tom was writing a lot more about me lately since I've been cutting him a big ass and

[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.400]
Deservedly so how about that Jerry? If you know Williams death hot time you idiot

[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.160]
This is yellow really bothers me the most here's a guy and he's in title his opinion

[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:20.180]
You can write whatever you want just spell my name right and put in the call I was pleased and the 10 to 2 now not 9 to 1

[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:22.680]
But which you'll notice he never wrote about that either

[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.640]
There was a you know, so they write a little blurb about it. What's his name? What's the ugly guy Jim?

[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.960]
In the sports section

[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:38.060]
Jim sarni I do that. Yeah, that's shocking because I've talked about it so much. Yeah, but he writes a little blurb about

[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:42.960]
Parallel and about and then here's a major schedule change on the one of the

[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:47.480]
The major AM station along with iod. I guess there's the only two that really count in the whole market

[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:52.260]
This Tommy write anything about that. No, so you can keep putting my name in these articles about wow

[00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:55.420]
I brought this guy to the closet and I said the s word on the ear

[00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.180]
Yeah, time why not why not give the public some information about what's really going on

[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:06.280]
Not just this station any station even got their mobile next time to be a step up in your department. God

[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:16.000]
But I'm the one that's out of touch. Oh, Jesus. K Christ. That was his middle initial by the way. Okay, it's per and don't forget about his brother Jimmy Christ

[00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:23.540]
It is an unusual time rights for a TV anchorman to serve as grand marshal of a local parade. It's when the parade celebrates gay pride

[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.880]
But not that there's anything wrong with it

[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:33.140]
Craig Stevens of WSVN channel seven accepted the honor for yesterday's fourth annual Stonewall street festival and parade in Wilton manners

[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.540]
Can you imagine the turnout they had for that

[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:45.540]
Stevens has been at WSVN for 11 years the last was the main male anchor doesn't regard it as a coming out. Oh, where why I guess some people will say I didn't know that

[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.980]
But I don't think this is going to come as breaking news because I've been here so long and live my life openly

[00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.000]
Steven said over the years have been active in various gay charities and events. That's right, uh Craig

[00:41:56.700 --> 00:42:01.300]
Now if all the other closet queens are a channel seven were like line up behind you then we'd accomplish something

[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:02.580]
That'd be a long line

[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:03.860]
Uh

[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.540]
Just fill up the parking lot back there where I would use to be in order to fill up the whole goddamn parking lot

[00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:12.220]
What's that in your mouth exactly

[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:17.680]
Steven said he served as MC of an AIDS walk and been on the board of directors of center one which helps victim vades

[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:21.420]
However, the parade is the most public acknowledgement. He's made of his sexual orientation

[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:28.300]
It makes him the most prominent member of the South Florida media to come out since Neil Rogers during the Anita Broncon diversity in 1976

[00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:32.400]
Rogers went out to become the most popular radio personality in South Florida

[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:34.560]
I always liked that time jockey. You know what?

[00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:38.260]
Even though we didn't want to yell at down the corner at me. You're gay

[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.240]
He did

[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.480]
Okay, he was going around the corner of the station. I open up the door of the studio and you put it

[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.680]
Polk to sit around your gay just like that

[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.860]
Steven's doesn't anticipate any negative backlash either

[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.940]
Maybe it's because of the nature of this community, which is really tolerant of different lifestyle

[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:55.140]
Oh, yeah. Oh, right

[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.780]
Ironically Rogers has and I see this is the part that just bugs the crap out of me

[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.840]
But that's okay. I can add look because it's full of crap

[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.760]
Ironically Rogers has made veiled references to Steven's sexual orientation over the years

[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.480]
Steven said it bothered him at first because of the hurtful nature of Rogers comments

[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:15.800]
But it's come to regard it as a compliment Neil only talks about people he feels are important

[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.940]
Well, get a little carried away Craig

[00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:23.020]
Stevens ran his participation in the parade past news director Alice Jacobs as a courtesy

[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.680]
If we get involved in a base there you run and pass the people here

[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.740]
He said Jacobs reacted to Stevens expected

[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:30.260]
I told him no problems at all with a cheat to expect no backlash

[00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:31.460]
Yada yada yada

[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.400]
He's not the first front line anchor to be open about a sexual orientation

[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.780]
Randy Price who works at WSBN's sister station. Is that a play on words in Boston is out as Hank plant

[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.520]
Who served as anchorman at WKPI X and San Francisco?

[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.560]
It didn't turn out to be an issue in either instance. It says

[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:49.860]
How do you like that?

[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:52.860]
So Craig Stevens is gay

[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.080]
Aren't you shocked?

[00:43:55.760 --> 00:44:00.360]
And it's made Josh Darrell our program director aka Clarence is

[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:02.180]
here desperate

[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.860]
I mean does it really make any difference in his case?

[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:08.580]
No, not really because I mean I like Clarence

[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.540]
He's a good guy because he gets me my paycheck on time sometime a day early

[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.840]
With it coming up in two days

[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.060]
I'm certainly not going to make any cost of comments about him now, but I will say this

[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.520]
I view him basically as sexless. You know what I mean like a neuter?

[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:22.280]
Yeah

[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:27.780]
Right I'm not saying he's a unique he might actually have a penis maybe I'm not sure smooth like G

[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.240]
An any

[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.860]
But I don't I don't I view him as sexless

[00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:34.720]
I don't I can't imagine him like getting a roused or just unless it's over a ballgame

[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.420]
Unless it's maybe like hurricanes baseball

[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:42.140]
And certainly her coons football. Oh brother. Can you imagine can you imagine him on the ball games with Zagaki?

[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.100]
That's why they limit him to the baseball games because football he'd be out of control

[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.860]
That's why they have to put the lovely beast in there. It's their whoever they put

[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:57.400]
Okay, so that's a deal on clearance for anybody who cares anybody care. No, I just thought you know since you out of them on Friday

[00:44:58.140 --> 00:45:00.640]
We're trying to like at least put him halfway back in there

[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.140]
Okay, let's get this pullgoam. What do you say? I'm killing a good hour here though, you know?

[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:10.460]
No, it is great because I understand that I really blew up this year and this will never happen again

[00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:14.980]
Uh, can you do you know do you have a rating books in the run or somewhere? Oh yeah, a lot

[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:19.220]
No, but I mean a recent one because I'd like to know what the last day I bet you was last Thursday

[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.800]
I mean last Wednesday

[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.340]
The last day of the spring rating book

[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.980]
I got a fall 2002 right here. I'm just looking. That's good

[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:30.760]
That's because in the back on the back inside page it shows you the um rating periods when they end

[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.340]
Okay, so look at spring 2003. You got it?

[00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:37.260]
Yes, what's the last day?

[00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:45.480]
June 18. Oh June 18. You know, so the reason now what day was the 18 was that Wednesday? Oh, okay?

[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:46.960]
Like I just said I am

[00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:50.460]
Once in a while I fall into a bucket of crap

[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:54.560]
So like I said the rating period has been over for five days already. So what's all the week here?

[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.500]
This is the summer book. You're gonna get blamed for it anyway. What do I care?

[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.680]
I honestly, I'm not saying this to cover up for your uh, you know

[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.600]
Inadequacy that's a very good word

[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:09.420]
But the fact of the matter is I don't know how you do it and how many years in a row did I talk about it before I got lucky enough to get out of the song

[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:17.000]
In the beginning summer was great summer was fantastic kids were out of school college students were home from my college

[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.280]
And everybody was having a good time and we used to get all kinds of living and breathing people during the summer who couldn't

[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:25.580]
Call us the other three seasons the other three-time parts of the year then what happened?

[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.980]
And then they all started getting smart and getting out of town in the summertime

[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:34.420]
Everybody abandoned it because it kept getting more and more hot and more and more stifling and more and more suffocating

[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:39.460]
I'm telling you I don't I don't know how you people do it you have got to be a captive audience

[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:43.860]
You must be held there by absolute necessity your job your family your

[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:50.340]
Prison whatever it is that force you to stay there these months. We presume people July, August

[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.400]
And I'm not really so sure about September and all that great either and sometimes October

[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.480]
Right suffocating now. I'm not talking about hot and human. I'm talking about way beyond that

[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:03.240]
You know Vegas. It's 115. It's hot, but it's not human

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:08.460]
Here like it's in the 90s every day this week. It's gonna be it's hot, but it's not human power broiler

[00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:09.580]
Wow

[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:10.980]
Roodle

[00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.720]
So I salute all of you who are unfortunate enough to have to be stuck in it and of course there are those people

[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:19.220]
We love it. We love the summer weather here. Right. Yeah, sure you do

[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.340]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:28.360]
Oh, again second day in a row retire and he answers the same. Yeah, when I'm good and ready asshole

[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:33.300]
Every single day this guy is out there and this is this is one of the other ones doing different voice night

[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:34.720]
I just noticed that for the first time

[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:38.000]
He's got a new act retire now

[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:42.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound five, but what does that tell you?

[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.200]
I've been going on for almost an hour now. We got our good pull here going and the first call is the same asshole

[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:48.320]
It was the first call on Friday

[00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:53.600]
So like I said after the break George and Miguel are gonna be doing the show just do the spots

[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.900]
All right, now just just a joke

[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.920]
I don't want to get about the village. I maybe would like to do that

[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.640]
Because I'd like to get about 10 names on the pool so they're can put it up on there, but maybe not

[00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:08.120]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 and team for rising line

[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:14.020]
Uh, which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog. We've only got five so far

[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:19.120]
Syracurgistic a Parker glory as Stefan Mariah scary Jackie's Johnson and JLo

[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:24.620]
And we're waiting for your suggestions. Okay. Are we waiting for their? No, we're waiting with vated breath

[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.260]
Hey, I'll tell you what a lot of you waiting to lose some weight

[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:31.520]
But it's not gonna happen by osmosis and you know all this exercise business is fine

[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:33.660]
But you know how far you have to run from here to

[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.800]
From where you're sitting right now to see ettle to really lose any meaningful weight

[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:42.260]
You've got to have food that'll help you lose the way you got to have a real diet that you can stay on

[00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:46.400]
That's why balance for life is so good because even the simplest of the simple things out there can stay on it

[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:51.120]
Because you have nothing to figure out no cooking no shopping no cleaning no calorie counting no carbohydrate counting

[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:56.240]
Just great results as the weight pours off your body and you have a big smile on your post because like I said

[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.820]
They do all the figuring out for you the only choice you have to make is when they send to that menu once a week

[00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:02.940]
You pick between two alternatives for each meal every day to try on a program

[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:06.060]
And they deliver right to your door fresh every morning a little black sack

[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:09.900]
And there's the food you need for the entire day in your sack three delicious fresh

[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.160]
Gourmet meals two delicious snacks even little bottle water is in there

[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.740]
So you don't have to worry about eating a little teeny tiny portions or a chemical feast inside of a box

[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:21.360]
This is fresh good stuff that you really enjoy it'll keep you satisfied all day long

[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.980]
And it's all based on the zone diet

[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:27.500]
So you don't have to worry about whether it's going to work for you because I just guarantee if you stick with it for most of you

[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:30.100]
This could be the answer you can start seeing results in a matter of days

[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.540]
So if you're sick and tired of being fat out of shape wearing puppets for clothing

[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:37.300]
Maybe on the verge of diabetes pick up that phone and call balance for life today

[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:40.320]

And she could go to jail

[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:53.260]
Then you can go to hell I'll make the best of my time to my young suits and see the other girls have to make walk through

[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.760]
This could go right just say good bye

[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.620]
Cuz you will try

[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.940]
Marthus tip down they hope they're like a boss make some pictures of her

[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:09.460]

[00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:14.020]
Is she gonna jail

[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:26.200]
That's the bad news for a major Jackson, Atlanta's first black mayor has died. All right. Yeah, who?

[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.900]
Major Jackson. Oh, I don't tell me you never heard of major Jackson. I never heard of made

[00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:36.300]
Jackson. He was Atlanta's first black mayor. How about that and he died and anyway

[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:39.720]
Well, I mean you just out of touch with reality. Okay. He had nothing

[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:42.700]
Nothing to do with Cuba. So Miguel wouldn't have heard anything about him

[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.780]
Cool. Here's a good fact Ricky from the moon from

[00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:49.700]
Fort Myers-Deport St. Lucie. I'm not sure if that's a step up or a step down Ricky

[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:55.640]
But anyway, she says wondered if you'd mentioned the online Democratic primaries during the marthus day June 24th lasting 48 hours

[00:51:55.640 --> 00:52:00.180]
I'm just mentioning it right now Ricky website for registration is move on.org

[00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:04.060]
Where the voter enters their name and email order to place one vote for one of the Democratic contentors

[00:52:04.060 --> 00:52:05.800]
In fact right after the show I'm gonna do that Ricky

[00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:11.380]
The purpose is to generate enthusiasm nationwide for the Democratic Party and of course to vote the bushes out of office

[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.800]
Thanks for reminding me Ricky

[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.880]
Move on.org

[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.100]
I'm voting for a Bob Graham

[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:22.820]
You don't sound very enthusiastic about that Bob Graham's great. What are you talking about?

[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.100]
I was just gonna see the fall over the weekend

[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:28.660]
He's smashing all the other contenders in the Democratic primary in Florida and the against Bush

[00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:33.540]
It was I think 53 to 40 for Bush, which isn't that bad right on the heels of that the bogus war

[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.560]
Oh, sorry Miguel

[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:41.740]
Don't look at him again. All of a sudden he's a bush lover man. He is obsessed with bush. Why would you say yeah?

[00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:48.140]
See he's laughing he agrees aren't you obsessed with bush absolutely we're not talking about

[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:50.400]
Politicians necessarily nope

[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:56.760]
Anyway, we'll find out org and but the only problem Bob Graham just doesn't have the recommend nobody knows him anywhere else

[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.320]
See and the deep Southay know him especially Florida because he was our governor twice

[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:04.440]
He's a senator now things like that you know that even the dumbest of the dumb somebody might know who he was

[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.600]
Plus they got a street named after him and his family

[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.320]
But other than that he might because he's only drawn one or two percent in all the other places

[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.800]
You know, they just don't know who that he is

[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.640]
Plus on top of that as much as I like him in the fact

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.760]
He's got big balls and his open up a mouth and really knows what he's talking about

[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:24.580]
But in spite of that he's just he's not a good speaker, you know, he's like a you look at the democratic field

[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:26.340]
Okay, how are Deans a good speaker right?

[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:33.680]
John Kerry is not only a good speaker, but John Kerry has that craggy face who looks like he already belongs them out rush more

[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:34.620]
Right

[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:40.080]
You see what I'm saying yeah, if you were to put even though he's never been elected beyond senator anything else

[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:45.680]
But he looks right now like he belongs in Ramos. He's just got that craggy face. That's not good visual appeal

[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.140]
No, he looks presidential you're wrong. He looks presidential even though he looks old and craggy

[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:58.920]
I mean you can be young and good looking like Kennedy was which is good or you can be old and craggy and presidential looking like John Kerry a little scary

[00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:02.300]
Now let's see who else is a good speaker anybody. Oh, Al Sharpton

[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:08.780]
Yeah, why no he can speak he's your hoot. I mean, I don't I don't like a lot of his crap

[00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:11.520]
But then I'm sure see you laugh right off the bat. You right?

[00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:17.060]
You're such a hard-ass nobody can get through to you. You're like a rock. Right speaking about Russian. We're like a brick

[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.540]
He's a laughable person. Okay, but he's a he's a

[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:25.580]
In fact that first debate that they had he was the one that they made monkeys out of the rest of when I was a bad term

[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.380]
He made him look bad. He made him look bad

[00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:34.220]
He's talking about who can speak a dick. Edhard couldn't talk his way to a paper bag. He's awful

[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.360]
Me name out. Yeah, it's you labor man

[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:41.760]
Yeah, we know about him. Oh, here's another good one and a cool smith. Thank you very much

[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.260]
See we're building this list on the faxes. They don't have time to be call him this today. They'll get around it when we get around to them

[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:47.560]
Retire

[00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.940]
He's one of my new favorites that guy

[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.200]
And in the colesmith you got her who's taking this list down?

[00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.820]
Good. Okay. Thank you Jay and Tampa

[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.040]
Here's one that says

[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:05.600]
Maria Barteromo on CNBC. It's not spelled right. It's an IROMO other than both online whoever said she was hot

[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.280]
And there are a lot of people do really all right back in the days when I used to watch that when I was losing all of my money

[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:16.980]
The gambling channel all these guys when they take calls you know people asking about stocks when they have their so-called experts on

[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:21.980]
I'm a real yes. Oh lovely. Oh yeah, a lot of these really desperate. I was who couldn't get laid in Amsterdam

[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:27.560]
Oh, they think she's really hot Maria Barteromo with a gigantic bags under her eyes right and her big ugly nose

[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:32.500]
She's nasty nasty nasty. I'll tell you another one. Although other than mad dog

[00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:37.100]
I can't imagine anybody think she's hot is a glory of ancestor Greta whatever he'll learn an angel and Greta

[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:43.320]
Avivon Suston and Avivon Brown Suston. Should we put her on her? Why not? It's free. I know nobody thinks she's hot

[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:46.200]
That's got a good joke nobody that's a joke

[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:53.120]
In fact, that would be a good pull one day who's got the worst the phony nose Greta or what's your name on gambling channel? What is your name?

[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:55.640]
Sue Herrera. I don't know

[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:59.760]
Here's one. It says what about Melissa Starks of Monday Night Football for your pool

[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:04.580]
Nobody and by the way, what's the story with gilding? Oh gilding went to a wedding. He already had this day off

[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:10.140]
It's a dog don't believe all this stuff. He here gilding be back tomorrow. Okay. I'll always looking but he'll be back tomorrow

[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.220]
Melissa Starks do we know who that is? Miguel must know it because he's a football a nerd. She's cute

[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:18.640]
Some of the she doesn't belong on his list

[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.420]
No

[00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:25.340]
Okay, well I'm taking your word for because I don't know who that is because I don't watch Monday Night Football unless the Patriots are playing of course

[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.740]
So we're building our list here. I think I'm gonna vote. I'm not gonna tell you I'm gonna vote for but I'll give you a clue

[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:32.400]
She's got one breast in the middle of her chest

[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:39.400]
She gives me I mean you talk about talent you can't complain about her talent because so far they haven't found any

[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.340]
Well if you ever saw Sarah Jessica Parker

[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:47.160]
It's not what I'm talking about oh you're voting for her. Oh yeah, I'm talking about five times

[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:53.720]
Gary Mariah Carey. I'd rather I'd rather have Andy Carey on my team any day remember Andy Carey third base Yankees

[00:56:54.240 --> 00:57:00.260]
Sarah Jessica Parker's out in front George. How many times you vote? I already got 11 and Mariahs only got four Gloria step on five

[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:04.640]
He just keep pop pop pop pop pop Jennifer Lopez for and Jackie Johnson don't have anybody

[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:09.440]
Well, I mean see I wouldn't say Jackie Johnson's a dog. That's that's cool. That's nasty

[00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:18.440]
Right right when you say she's a dog I think she's attractive. Oh, come on. She's not a dog, but I think she does have a monkey face

[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:24.680]
5 6 7 0 5 60 just the wrong animal. There's your problem. She's she's not too good. She's highly overrated

[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:28.020]
Maybe that would have been a nicer way to of course. We don't want to be nice doing

[00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:32.460]
Oh, I live in nicer way to phrase the ball is the is the most overrated the most overblown

[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:43.400]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Ryzen Wireless line the Supreme Court today ruled that race can be one of the many factors of selection for admission to college

[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:47.420]
It can be to which we say no bad move

[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:53.780]
Here's the call from Coral Springs. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Yes, sir. How are you? Good? I was just listening to you

[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:56.980]
Which I do every day and enjoy your show very much. Click your back on 10 to 2

[00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:58.100]
Me too. I

[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:10.200]
Then go right on my man the mayor of Atlanta who passed away. Meanor Jackson. See how fast they forget his body's not even warm yet

[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:14.660]
A funny story about him. I live in Atlanta in the late 60s when they opened up this big

[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.580]
Rolla coaster called the great American screen machine right and they had a whole big deal

[00:58:19.580 --> 00:58:21.600]
And he was in the front car because it was the biggest

[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.400]
Rolla coaster and whatever

[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:32.000]
Old and news media was out there the thing went around one time I just came through the starting position the brakes failed and it went second time

[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.340]
And they had it on the news and but if there's time he was his tie was the skew and he looked like he was the throw up

[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:39.560]
Finally like the fourth time they were

[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:45.500]
And when they had to help get him off he was all wobbly leg as was everybody else on the thing

[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:49.140]
But it was a spherical thing. I was wondering the things that was a part of his legacy there

[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.500]
I was thinking he might have been a little bit pale but in his case it might have been hard to tell

[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:59.320]
Yeah, but he was a very good mayor from for that city which was still fighting the civil war back in 1969

[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.860]
Okay, one other question. Yes, sir

[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:08.160]
On the web page and talked about a book that you may or may not be writing is that true or is that just kind of a good?

[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:08.540]
That's

[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:14.580]
Then one Eric's fantasy. Okay, because I actually think it would be very interesting to read about your

[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.460]
Your life. I guess my exploits. Yeah, okay. I'm thinking about it

[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:22.380]
Okay, great day pal. Bye-bye. That's right about our exploits all of us. What do you say?

[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:24.880]
No several chapters about beener boy

[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:29.320]
So what's the story with him? You had any update on that the punk no on that street punk no

[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:34.240]
Well, why not? I don't know my phone. Do we have the new stories up there?

[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:38.120]
I guess I could take a look but I'm scared to take a look because he needs at least two hours

[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.360]
No, seriously. He doesn't realize that I'm sure because he thinks just like a lot of other people

[00:59:43.360 --> 00:59:47.980]
George who think I'm always going to go to bad for them and they push the thing a little see at least George learned

[00:59:47.980 --> 00:59:51.940]
Is lesson man. He backed into a corner just shut his mouth. He put his like little

[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:57.760]
Tom thumb who was it little jack corner? Yeah, sat in the corner sat in the corner and stuck in his mouth

[00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.360]
Now the same old crap is on here from like Friday

[01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:05.620]
Conservatism here today. Well, that's a nice throw it or beener boy, but it's old. It's ancient. It's old stuff

[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:12.280]
It's embarrassing for a high-paid show like ours with our big fancy schmancy website. They're always bragging about get with it beener boy

[01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:17.500]
He's on tonight speaking about it. How about that Nathan Horton, huh? No

[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:23.600]
I don't know the kid that the panthers drafted and what how was what was for well talking about this morning

[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:28.760]
I mean so maybe this Samuelson kid the macaul Samuelson that they got from the penguins maybe he does suck

[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:33.340]
But the fact that the mad was they got him for free because they got Nathan Horton anyway, which is who they wanted in the beginning

[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.460]
So they got like a freebie thrown in there

[01:00:36.780 --> 01:00:42.460]
So they have like an extra body than they understand that they got an extra body actually they pulled off a pretty good deal there and he's

[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:49.740]
You know better come down a little bit for all of it again. It's your it's your night-chafing. Yeah, that's the problem

[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.660]
5 6 7 0 5 60

[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:59.020]
pound 5 60 on the AT&T and for rice wireless line a man who went there to throw out the first pitch yesterday and about

[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:03.960]
75 people were there in the beginning of the game and he said no more than 3000 by the end by the conclusion

[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:11.020]
The red hot marlins are only one game under 500. They're only 75 games out of that playoff spot the wild card birth

[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:18.040]
They got the don trellwell as who's the biggest attraction since vina blue who everybody in their world is just

[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.540]
Can't believe how good he is like 21 years old anybody here now nobody cares even mckelo care

[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:29.280]
Did you go Saturday to see that game? I was there all week along basically really yeah, I'll be damn

[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.220]
Of course like I said there there is a real fan right there a guy to get some free tickets

[01:01:35.060 --> 01:01:38.320]
But at least uses him. He doesn't doesn't throw him an instrument or like some of us do

[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.360]
He actually goes out there and sees it. He had to come

[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:44.080]
Oh, that's right was some kind of promotion. Well, I didn't have to go yesterday

[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:44.440]
I went

[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:47.800]
Yeah, but you wanted to see for all throughout the first pitch didn't you?

[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.200]
Not really

[01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:54.240]
Were you there when he threw out the first pitch actually I was outside of the stadium

[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.060]
Geez that's why his ego is wounded. You know the guys only been here a couple of weeks

[01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.780]

I was a bill span in the old days the old AFL the Buffalo bills. Yes. I was a bill span back then

[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.900]
Well, because then I then I wound up in Florida. I was a dolphin fan for a number years

[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.360]
I mean, you know things change things changes you go along

[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:58.100]
I used to go to all the bills games back in the days of cookie gilt chris and jack camp and the dearle Lamontica

[01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.880]
Those were great days great great

[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.340]
That's the George same from Michigan state

[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:05.400]
Go Patriots baby. That's all I got to tell you

[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:09.300]
Pants go baby. Oh, that's all because of that Tom Brady. No wrong

[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:15.100]
Free Tom Brady. Thank God. I was a pay-peat fan one year before he came along thinking this for that or people would have said

[01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.660]
Oh, it's just because Tom Brady's hot and he is even Miguel admits he's hot

[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:21.420]
Yeah, real hot he is

[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:26.180]
But anyway, let me just say this to the I don't want to start creating a problem here

[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:29.160]
But I just had voted I gave a number of votes we had we were off to our usual

[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:31.460]
You know start a little bit less than usual because nobody's in town

[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:36.700]
But the poll was taken off and look what we have now look on your screen George. Oh, I gotta go back to move on

[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:42.820]
The poll is down. Oh, no, it was up. It was up and now

[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.040]
It drooped back down again

[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:49.400]
Somebody get the Viagra for Eric. Okay, I'm doing Orlando. See this is unacceptable

[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:56.240]
Beener boy is in jail or whatever the hell is story is and we can't get the guy then pull go in this show is starting as slow as freaking

[01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.020]
Melania's which is good because basically we'll be honest. We want to kill as much time as possible

[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:05.200]
Because it's summertime. No, no seriously. This is not right. So I just voted for Maria scary again

[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.220]
But I don't know what's what's the reason for this?

[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:12.000]
How come we just can't like we usually do put it up there and then add to it as we go along

[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.280]
Is there any special reason you just voted for Syrogesica Park? We're gonna. I saw you. Yep

[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:20.780]
So there we go those are the two votes. We had a bunch of votes on there and then so if you voted before

[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.640]
Vote again, right forget about it

[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.860]
If and when that is Eric ever decides to get this back open up to the public again because it still says the poll is down

[01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:34.580]
This man has more goddamn problems up there Jesus when you get Peter boy back in there

[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.460]
Carly could have come in late not that we don't love Miguel, but Miguel's not a computer

Airby how do you survive like that when every I mean how do you get out of bed in the morning when you know every single thing

[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.860]
You do from brushing your teeth to taking a dump everything you do it could possibly become a major crisis

[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:17.280]
I don't get it. I would definitely jump off my balcony here and believe me. I got a long way to go

[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:25.260]
How can you do that? I don't know just the most just the most basic simpler rudiments of life this kid

[01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:05.780]
Pay the period, you know be real easy

[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.220]

Tara read is at his bitch. I mean really?

[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:14.560]
That's what I read

[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:20.300]
Now do you know who that is George? Sure and she's hot, but she's got the last

[01:08:21.140 --> 01:08:24.780]
Oh, now see how about if we put jails ass on the rest of her how would that be all right?

[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.480]
Then we can have a compromise between you and there. I'll kill over

[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.300]
Well put her on there. Okay, I don't care. We'll put anybody on it

[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:34.740]
That is of course if we ever get oh here we go. It's finally up there. Um Eric. You're you're just

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.140]
May he don't want to know from you

[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:48.900]
In fact if that line rings that he calls on don't answer it Miguel because it'll be Eric going

[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:50.940]
What did I do?

[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:56.060]
You allow that crap, you know we're tired of hearing that stuff and you're neurosis. We're tired of it

[01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:00.540]
We'd rather find out that beener boys in jail on death row for killing a whole bunch of illegal aliens

[01:09:00.540 --> 01:09:02.580]
That would make us happier than hearing you go

[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:06.620]
Like that again, you know, it sits old now. Am I right? Absolutely

[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:09.180]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound

[01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:15.120]
Hi 60. Oh, but Neil you're so much more excited than uh, I don't think I'm any less hysterical than excited now here

[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:18.600]
Then I was when I was there last week stop you know, of course not oh

[01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.780]
I'm just a psychotic because I have to deal with the same radio station the same bunch of losers the same missfit

[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:29.600]
I got Bob Eisenberg give me directions about my life by the way nice hairpiece Bob. I want to tell you this is a true story

[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.380]
Bob Eisenberg who is at one of our sales holes a major asshole by the way

[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:38.000]
But he was in there this morning and he gave a testimony. I wish we'd have taped that for Charles Alfieri

[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:42.260]
He looked he looks good. I mean for him. I mean there's a hand on his face for him

[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:45.360]
He doesn't look good as compared to like the human race, but for him

[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:49.800]
He looks spectacular. Thanks to Chuck Alfieri and he went on an on any ward on the area

[01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:53.920]
I think but he just it was great. It was very nice. It was very nice Bob. Here is perfect

[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.340]
By the way, you know Eisenberg

[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.440]
He's an asshole. I'm sorry

[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:04.400]
Yeah, we I have a long memory Bob. Okay, you're not fooling me. He was sucking my ass so hard this morning by long distance

[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.080]
Good God

[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:15.220]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and for right and at least I will say this he realizes he's getting like a gift money

[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:19.340]
Thanks to me, you know, whatever he gets out of these couple of accounts. He's just it's a gift

[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:25.280]
Hey, you know, do I copy just take the copy over to facts machine from wherever the client is facts it up here to me

[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.780]
And that's it. That's the work he's got to do. It just like stealing just like some other people have gotten to building it on

[01:10:29.780 --> 01:10:37.280]
Appreciate that like Todd Dreck there's a thief. There's people speaking to death rotors people waiting to get executed all of the country for much less crimes than Todd Dreck

[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:42.440]
Commits every day a man who was stealing from the till every time he takes a commission check this man is stealing

[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:46.000]
Because you can't complain about the work he does he doesn't do any none zero

[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:51.220]
Gold with the finger, but he will come in here and hop out of the scale. Oh, I went 165 pounds

[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:52.840]
Whoopey do a pure

[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.640]
That but you know, that's an interesting pull. I'm thinking about him and Mo

[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:05.680]
Because you remember I was talking last week about Mo and the fact that somewhere in the midst of that nasty miserable hateful old rotten body

[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:11.320]
Somewhere in there you find occasionally like a little glimmer of amusement of something that might be redeeming not with Todd Dreck

[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.180]
There's nothing there. It's all bad

[01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:16.820]
Here's Port St. Lucy. Hello

[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:24.620]
Hey Neil, how are you? Yes, sir. How you doing good first time caller, but listen to you for your I want to talk about I wanted to talk about that nearly

[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:30.660]
Uh, a long over there, but I before that I just want to echo your thoughts on the Panther draft

[01:11:30.660 --> 01:11:35.200]
I thought they did a heck of a job. Yeah, and they got a couple tough young forward there

[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:41.780]
You know, they get a good defense for now. It's solid, uh, you know player and maybe they can do this thing back into a playoff

[01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.200]
Well, I wouldn't get carried away. I don't I mean they'd have a long way to go

[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:49.260]
They got to get some established veterans. You can't keep doing his youngsters new organization crap all the time

[01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.040]
But I mean they did a good job Saturday now

[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.200]
They got to go out and sign a couple of veteran players who can really contribute and Valerie Burry is not the answer by the way

[01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.040]
They bring him back which it looks like they will it's gonna be a nightmare the kid a guy can't play just stiff

[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.520]
No, they're not gonna bring him back are they yes? That's what they were saying. Oh, no

[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:09.660]
I think you're I think you're a fight out by tomorrow morning today supposed to be the day they decide they're gonna

[01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:15.760]
Because they have to pay most of his salary anyway so they decided they rather bring him back and play then just paying for being someplace else

[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.520]
Oh my god. Yeah, exactly

[01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:24.640]
All right, well, what's the deal with Rivera? I mean he used to be the one descending voice on that station a nincompool box news

[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:29.960]
Now all of a sudden when I watch him he like still right into line with all of the other moron

[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.180]
Roo stepped right in the line. He's an asshole. Yeah

[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:34.980]
Yeah, we'll see with her all to it's not about uh

[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:40.440]
It's not about principle anyways just about him. He always has to be the centerpiece. That's why he slept over to a rack

[01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.860]
That's why he slept to Afghanistan. It's always got to be about him, you know

[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:46.760]
Yeah, it seemed like he after he screwed up over in the

[01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:51.280]
Iraqi war there when he came back he came back with his head between his legs

[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:57.040]
And they swatted him around a little bit at Fox and said if you want to stay here you better get in line or get out

[01:12:57.880 --> 01:12:58.280]
Absolutely

[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.000]
I think you got it man

[01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.360]
Yeah, thanks to your gold dancers all right

[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.500]
He said oh, you know when you were given that nice short the plug you gave me the last time

[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:36.480]
It was like a little dig in there. Can I notice that see how even I may be older the crap

[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:41.860]
I may not look very good, which is an understanding but but I don't miss much when you give me that nice quick plug

[01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:47.100]
You know thought nation wide limo there the best can the Halpern is a super guy slugs me all over the place

Is that long enough for what can can't help her nation wide limo

[01:13:50.180 --> 01:13:54.600]
But anyway, he was making a point about the jugs McDonald which I guess one of their limos was picking him up

[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.600]
They're slipping somewhere like maybe the old age place

[01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.540]
And he said to me how did he ever get that name jigs

[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.380]
And I thought that's an interesting question

[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.820]
I mean not real interesting, but how would you get in it is that like a real name?

[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:09.520]
Like a one Irish name might have named you that no

[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:15.940]
No, no well, where does somebody get like maybe somebody looked at him and said oh the jigs up right that could have been it

[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:21.780]

Car theft is on the rise

[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.700]
In America a car is stolen every 12 seconds

[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:25.780]
What can you do to protect your car an expensive car alarm system won't protect your car from being stolen

[01:16:26.300 --> 01:16:29.080]
The club won't protect the valuables inside your car

[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.700]
But a big black guy named Ben can get away from the car mother

[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:39.420]
For less than you'd pay for an expensive car alarm system and even less than you'd pay for the club

[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:45.340]
You can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile get away from the car mother

[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:53.100]
It's simple to use just leave the big black guy name Ben in your car whenever you get out and he does the rest

[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:59.620]
Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them get away from the car mother

[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:05.100]
Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy name Ben

[01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:11.140]
It's always nice to have someone to ride with although he really doesn't say much just get away from the car mother

[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:13.300]
Oh

[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:21.100]
That's about it. I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with it got him to protect my car. It's the best investment. I've ever made

[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:28.880]
My name of it isn't I create there have been a lot of car thefts. I can't tell you how many times I've heard it away from the car mother

[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.600]

A former priest and boys done in the kindle area the suit filed on behalf of an unnamed man who was sent to the residential facilities

[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:57.980]
12-year-old and 74 alleges that Huck sexually abused him that an archbishop did nothing about it the man is now in his 40s

[01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:01.560]
Archdiocese spokeswoman Mary Ross Augusta could not be reached for comment

[01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:05.000]
Herman said the priest retired in 2002 quoted a lawsuit

[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:11.200]
The alleged victim was sent to live in boys down where he became an altar boy in institutions chapel and altar boy

[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.180]
What a shock

[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:15.300]
Reverend Huck routinely took boys out fishing

[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.060]
Maybe he was checking out their trouser trouts

[01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:18.900]
Scrod

[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:23.220]
Enter the movies and a one of these trips molested the 12-year-old to suit ledges

[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:26.280]
The suit also claims that Reverend Huck threatened the boy to keep quiet by telling him

[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.140]
I will get you and you will burn in hell

[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:34.240]
The boy later complained to his house parent and John Pirate the director of the home for boys and was called a liar and punished

[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:40.520]
When the 12-year-old approached other priests for at the institution for help included the Reverend Gary Weissman and Reverend glory

[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:48.080]
Who's first name is not mentioned maybe it's a whole comma glory

[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:54.720]
Holy the boy was told to be quite a coin of the lawsuit the boy also told archbishop McCarthy about the abuse when the archbishop visited one day

[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.360]
The McCarthy told the boy had heard the rumor and that the 12-year-old should not say such things about a priest the law

[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:05.080]
Oh my god. How do you like that? But of course the archbishop he's in failing health now

[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.300]
So we doesn't say nothing bad about him should we?

[01:21:11.300 --> 01:21:15.740]
See it's good that this see they thought that they were going to have that little meeting down there in Dallas

[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.820]
Or whatever the hell they had it and they were going to like harsh this thing up and you know give give it a lick in a smear as they say you know

[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:23.880]
Come here, Sonny. Let me give you a lick in a smear

[01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:28.380]
But an ankle in a way is it and here's for the proof of it

[01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.620]
This is from news day views from the pews

[01:21:33.900 --> 01:21:40.360]
In an open mic forum that at times turned 10th hundreds of Long Island Catholics gathered at St John de Baptist high school in West

[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:44.900]
Isle of last night to tell Bishop William Murphy what they thought of him in the sex abuse scandal in the church

[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:50.200]
I'm ashamed of my church and my bishops said one man whose comments could be heard in the lobby

[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:57.160]
Another participant lashed out saying where is your conscience added a third your style is that of a medieval monarch and has to stop

[01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:04.280]
For two hours Murphy you had told the crowd of about 350 people in brief interview remarks that he was listening with an open heart and open mind

[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:06.120]
And maybe even open right to him

[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:10.480]
sat on the stage in the high school auditorium along with two facilitators and listened intently to the complaints

[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:17.040]
This is not my night to speak. It's my night to listen and learn. He said I see your presence here is a sign of deep deep love for the church

[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:19.480]
A love I share. Oh my god

[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:28.280]
Talk about in denial a total of close to 40 participants who lined up first at the mic were allowed 45 minutes each to make their comments and pose their questions

[01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.920]
All but three spoke about these sex abuse scandal

[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:36.840]
While some of the remarks were withering and underscored a sense of betrayal and anger the general atmosphere remained orderly

[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:42.120]
According to people who attended and spoke later in the news day two people offered faint defenses of Murphy saying he was doing his best

[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:46.680]
Under trying circumstances and they appreciate his holding the session. He was holding it for them

[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:54.120]
People in the audience said much of the night was spent attacking the bishop arrogant was the word used most often said Dan Missola

[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:59.960]
I like his oil a lot of St. Rose of Lima perish and master Piqua's he left ever been to master Piqua

[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:00.780]
No, no

[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:09.020]
Hadn't Harry read of the same parish. He's been criticized for essentially. I'm asked to pick was okay a lot of our rich bastards are there a lot of rich joy in my thing

[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.340]
So there you go. It continues. They thought they were headed under the carpet there

[01:23:13.340 --> 01:23:15.660]
They thought I had it under control and guess what?

[01:23:16.380 --> 01:23:21.840]
They're never gonna go away. Oh, you know who was really blasting in this morning who I usually can't stand because he's a real right wing asshole

[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:26.860]
That Jack McCavity on CNN how about that because evidently bill a Hummer

[01:23:27.900 --> 01:23:34.300]
Who's not married by the way bill Hummer was making some comments try to like gloss it over little and McCavity just lashed out at him

[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.200]
He just went nuts

[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:40.400]
Went ape schmid right there on CNN you go, but about time somebody on there said something

[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.440]
Okay here. Let's get back to the pool. Okay. Let's get to the show all the way. He'll kill the first two hours

[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:49.080]
Oh very nicely. Thank you, Neil. When I good great. It's almost noon already like nothing

[01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:53.220]
Here's a little lesson from Miguel how you killed two hours. Okay, without even breaking a sweat

[01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:58.000]
Have we even said hello yet today? I don't think so. Babylon ramble and who gives a crap?

[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:04.200]
Where exactly? Absolutely. So here's the pull so far which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog

[01:24:04.860 --> 01:24:05.340]
Okay

[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.140]
107 votes it'd be a lot more than that but Eric

[01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.820]

[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.980]
Why would a guy like Tom Brady be going with a dog?

[01:24:39.640 --> 01:24:42.580]
Right. Thank you. It's cute and hot. Yeah

[01:24:42.580 --> 01:24:47.640]
See you're just saying that because you're you're now because you're stucking up with the dolphins

[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:48.900]
That's the only reason you're doing that

[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:53.580]
Yeah, that's why that's the reason why you're coming because you're in that promotional thing

[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:57.080]
You want to suck up the dolphins you're afraid that Tom Brady if he was going with some hot babe

[01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:01.580]
There's an all-g Tom Brady never wanted to look good that one you win the Super Bowl two seasons ago

[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:05.660]
But also he's got this hot chick that he's banging the brains out of now. You don't want to say that?

[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:08.700]
Season before last

[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:15.760]
Wasn't it? Or did they win it again this past year? I don't think so I thought Tampa won a Super Bowl last year

[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.640]
Yeah, they did

[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:18.660]
So what do you what was that?

[01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:22.480]
I'll see it. You notice how he's trying to throw how he's trying to divert my attention

[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.900]
It doesn't work. I may be old in febrile. Okay, but it don't work Miguel

[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:32.620]
Same trick that the Ken the limo driver was using about that little comment about that shit a little of a quick play. Give me

Man who the hell are you people kidding? I'm as sharp as a tech. Oh and the good news is you know that weight

[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:44.560]
Did I log in when I was there? Yeah, it's already gone all right

[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:50.980]
It is good because I ate almost nothing yesterday and of course you know a lot of it is water bloat from sitting on your ass

[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:56.920]
All right, but it's it's all gone very good and it is good. Thank thank goodness for that. Thank you

[01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.780]

[01:26:12.740 --> 01:26:18.580]
It is not I said she's pretty hot. She's not bad looking at all and either was he as a matter of fact

[01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:22.740]
But he was too neurotic for anybody, but anyway he says what are your thoughts on the dessert?

[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:28.820]
Where how did he phrase it was one of the most strange lines but I'm not gonna talk movies again the audience could very upset about that

[01:26:28.820 --> 01:26:30.060]
We talking movies. No

[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:34.540]
In fact didn't watch any over the weekend just so we didn't have to talk about any

[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:39.760]
Duff did see Requiem for a dream again. He said it was great, but the directors caught was no different than a one he saw originally

[01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:46.000]
So he's probably a little bit disappointed, but it is worth seeing two three four times. What do you say at least?

Neil yes, sir. How you doing pretty good? Did you watch me the press yesterday? No, I did not

[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:54.180]
Howard Dean was on and Tim russard sliced and diced him really he has no shot of winning this

[01:31:54.740 --> 01:32:00.760]
I've seen all the Democratic candidates and there's only one they can be George W. Bush and the answer is

[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:03.640]
General Wesley Clark. Yeah, I mean he's uh, yeah

[01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.060]
He's sniffing around I saw the piece on him yesterday

[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.700]
Well, he may be sniffing around. There's a website called draft

[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:15.580]
Wesley Clark dot com. Yeah, and he's supposed to announce within the next two months whether you'll run

[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.460]
He's uh, he's not much of a speaker either. He's about as dynamic as a dead frog, you know

[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:31.040]
Well, I don't know what you watch, but he's been on meat depressed and he was very informative and

[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.040]
But I'm just talking about as a speaker. He just isn't

[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:38.660]
I guess I don't like him and of course being a general, you know

[01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:42.060]
Remember Eisenhower and all of that crap. I mean America goes for that kind of stuff

[01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:48.820]
He might be the one guy that could win, but he's a dynamic. Well, he's got an excellent biography in addition to being a gentleman before

[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:55.640]
He's a road scholar. Yeah, he finished number one. Well, so as Bill Bradley was a road scholar too now look how dynamic he was

[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:00.380]
You know, he couldn't win a first election right, but this guy was a general. He was the supreme ally commander of NATO

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.600]
He was

[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:07.420]
Graduated number one at West Point. I think you're wrong when you say he's the only one who could be to my thing Bob Graham could be

[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:11.620]
But I just don't think he wouldn't have an nation Bob Graham. It's frail. He's not gonna win Iowa

[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.520]
He's not gonna win New Hampshire. He's not gonna win South Carolina

[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:19.740]
He'll be out of the race by then. I don't think he can win. Then I just say that. I said I don't think he win the nomination

[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:22.040]
But I think if he ever could get to that point he could win the election

[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:28.820]
Well, I think I think Bush is very beatable. Well, I disagree. I think Bush is gonna win in a landslide and let the Democrats

[01:33:29.360 --> 01:33:30.840]
nominate General Wesley Clark

[01:33:32.220 --> 01:33:33.560]
Hey laugh all you want

[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:39.740]
But based on what what is it that sets him apart so heads and shoulders above all the other candidates? What is it?

[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:43.280]
He's articulate. He's telegenic. He's not articulate

[01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.820]
Have you seen him on meat depressed? He was able to let me ask you something

[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:52.640]
Why do you keep referring to meat depressed? I I didn't see yesterday because I was on route

[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.660]
I was on an airplane. Okay, it's hard to watch on a plane

[01:33:54.660 --> 01:33:57.840]
I do watch meat depressed and how he speaks on meat depressed

[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:02.720]
Why was he so much more dynamic there than the clips that I saw him making speeches over the weekend

[01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.180]
Meat depresses the most important political issue

[01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:08.340]
That's not the point the point is the public doesn't

[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:12.260]
Cast their voters to border candidate because of how they look on meat depressed

[01:34:12.260 --> 01:34:16.820]
Most people in this country don't watch meat depressed. They wouldn't know what time it's out of where to find it

[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:25.220]
Have a nice day sir. Why am I arguing with this guy meat depressed did you see him on eat depressed meat the pet had to be that had to be a paint your balls

[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:27.220]
But call had to be

[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:30.540]
I pray that it was there had to be a quack

[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.220]
So let me ask you yeah, did you see

[01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:35.420]
Eat the press

[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:40.800]
Let's see here's one. It says I watched Requiem for Dream the second time over the weekend because there was a lot

[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.320]
I missed the first time could you tell me what happened the first time Harry tried to get his arm looked at the hospital where they arrested uh, yeah

[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.180]
Yeah, they were arrested good good guess

[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:53.380]
That's how they got from uh the hospital to the slamer. That's that's how they got there

[01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:57.300]
They were arrested. That's why they big sheriff's deputy that big of you for the pusser guy

[01:34:57.300 --> 01:35:03.300]
It with the hat also regarding voting on your polls. I have belts out the ass. I can but I don't vote as many times

[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:08.280]
I want by well. You know that yeah, don't be given people away. Yeah, we have enough chronic stuff. They're already

[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:13.560]
So it's not scientific. It's just for fun. Okay, don't be so uptight your facts starts out very good

[01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:19.420]
I'm glad you like the movie and Harry went to the hospital along with the Damon Wayans and he missed the way in and they canceled the fight

[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:25.580]
5 6 7 0 5 60 it's a great movie and I did thought you know it's not worth it

[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:32.720]
But this guy he's peddling me you know he's peddling me. I like Bob Graham better than I like Wesley Clark. Yeah, but I know

[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.120]
In addition to which it's only June of 2003. There's a long way to go

[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.560]
It doesn't get serious till the beginning and exterior you got months to go here. Okay

[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:43.300]
Now if you saw Bob Graham on meet the press

[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:46.520]
See but you didn't

[01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:48.980]
No, I did not because he was not it was general Wesley Clark

[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:54.700]
I saw in fact. I was hoping I watched the piece in front of me was that must have been yesterday morning before I left

[01:35:54.700 --> 01:35:57.300]
And there was an extensive piece about a couple of appearances

[01:35:57.300 --> 01:36:00.320]
He made over the weekend and about how he was uh, you know

[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.540]
The meaty was like all following him and all excited about it and he kept playing cool

[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:10.180]
You know like oh, well, why all you hear all I did was come here to you know to wipe my ass and

[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:16.220]
I they showed him making a couple of speeches. He was about his dynamic as a frog's fart. Okay

[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:20.660]
That doesn't mean he couldn't be a great present. It couldn't be a win election

[01:36:20.660 --> 01:36:24.060]
But I'm just telling you this business. He's articular. He was great on me to press

[01:36:24.060 --> 01:36:27.380]
You don't have to be great on me to press you have to be great when you get up there making a speech

[01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.800]
And the public is watching another guy day evening news

[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:35.780]
That's when I'm when you get up there and debate against the god damn composable a liar

[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.980]
That's when you have to be great. I thought he was pretty melee mouth

[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.080]
In addition to which he was just spouting a bunch of uh glittering generalities about nothing in particular

[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:52.100]
And these two speeches he was made in say anything as opposed to Bob Graham who dissect bush and talks about the god then

[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:57.140]
Um the real threat with a Hess-Belon is country and about how they kept all this information from the god

[01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:01.100]
Them said it intelligence committee. I mean Bob Graham or our grant you maybe he can't win

[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:04.140]
But he's been dynamite. That's our god damn senator. He's been excellent

[01:37:04.140 --> 01:37:07.360]
He's been one of the few people of the god damn congress with a pair of balls

[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.740]
He's been one of the few democrats that there's to say anything

[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:14.900]
All the other ones are like sticking their god damn finger off the window to see which way to web

[01:37:14.900 --> 01:37:19.420]
Well, when does blowing which way to polls or blow because they're afraid he might the shoot themselves in the god damn foot

[01:37:19.420 --> 01:37:26.320]
Including Tom Dachel is a real piece of crap a real melee mouth and Nancy Pelosi the same thing. Okay Bob Graham's got a pair

[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:35.440]
Right right loving. I'm not gonna apologize because I like Bob Raymond this guy's gonna be where he's the only one like he knows it

[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:38.100]
He knows it, you know he gets your own talk show pal

[01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:40.340]
Everything he says is a fact

[01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:44.900]
Like more Howard David had same thing in fact. Maybe you and moe could do the god damn show gellie wants out

[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:51.580]

[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.060]
And Zimper said that he resented the fact that moe was after his job to do the dolphin play by plan

[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.580]
I resent bitterly it's an attack on my credibility. But but always the same bull crap

[01:38:42.580 --> 01:38:48.020]

Protect it and it is so often take it out for a nice nash

[01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:17.260]
Caron of not to care

[01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.020]
Home while you eat

[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:24.740]
That's strange and people will leave you alone all right

[01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:29.400]
Provo five at five sixty W.D. Kim and by the way mo take off those checkered pants

[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:31.220]
He's in denial again. That's that's a hoot

[01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.840]
That's just oh and and let me just tell you one thing during the break

[01:44:33.840 --> 01:44:38.020]
You know what they finally came into mind a little slow you know the punk that was calling about meat depressed

[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:41.960]
Yeah, that punk is the same when it was called last election

[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:46.040]
I forget I don't remember what the topic was but it was the same thing and we'll call air

[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:50.320]
Everyday would have said oh and you've got to think this and you've got to support you remember that of course

[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:54.060]
I don't think all the time what it's a political thing. Oh my god

[01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:58.920]
And not only does he call but he gives instructions as to what we're all supposed to think and what we must do

[01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:02.660]
And who we must support blow it out your ass schmuck. Okay, don't call us again without garbage

[01:45:02.660 --> 01:45:05.960]
You'll be on about a second and a half get lost

[01:45:06.920 --> 01:45:12.820]
He's he's almost as potter as that the schmuck's are for Miami to cause online. I need we're doing including today right out of the box

[01:45:12.820 --> 01:45:17.620]
Him and the retire guy those two guy maybe they can get the pad to get this somewhere

Yeah, maybe they can move it in

[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:26.980]
Here's our poll question today which overrated supposedly hot chick is actually the biggest dog

[01:45:28.220 --> 01:45:33.560]
255 votes, which is astonishing because we have all kinds of issues with our website this week so far

[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:38.200]
Off through kind of a rocky start and in the cold smith 100 nice even number 100 for that bitch

[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.240]
Sirica Jessica Parker 75 you're not doing bad what

Sirica Jessica I'm saying that land purpose. I know I like it better that way

[01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:53.980]
Cheesy I think I'm like totally retarded. Sirica Jessica park parker park park park park park it in her

[01:45:54.740 --> 01:45:57.380]
The glorious glorious step on 23

[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:59.480]
J. Low 20

[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:02.980]
Mariah scurries got 13 should have more than that

[01:46:02.980 --> 01:46:10.920]
Don't spill keys in the ray is god nine Maria Bartoromo five. Well, I hate that bitch Jackie Johnson will get a little bit. She's got four

[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:17.980]
highly overrated Jackie you do a nice weathercast, but uh, you're not in a no big deal believe me trust me when I tell you

[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:24.680]
The in fact the same guy is the same guys that ugl over Maria Bartoromo. That's bad. That's a little bit of a shot

[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:27.080]
Well, but it's the same concept, you know

[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:36.680]
See there's a certain group of people out there both heterosexual and homosexual and that is that the person that has the right body parts that they're attracted to

[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.420]
It doesn't make any difference anything else is not relevant, you know

[01:46:39.420 --> 01:46:44.260]
And in other words it but she's got a vagina and the least one breast and maybe an ass

[01:46:44.260 --> 01:46:49.160]
Then that's he's hot, you know she's hot. You know that crowd. Oh, yeah like the beast

[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:53.300]
I would say clearance, but in his case, I think indifference would be his vote

[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.720]
We ought to bring him like a team real bad reuse psychologist

[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:01.680]
Try to get to the bottom of that because they're like a test

[01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:10.180]
Yeah, if yeah, I think I think uh, that's that's the test where what you do is you take clearance and you sit them start naked in a chair

[01:47:10.180 --> 01:47:15.840]
You time up time to the chair and they put that that those things they tie like the sex offenders

[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:22.580]
They put the the troids the electrodes on your exactly they put the electrodes on his penis and then they show them a naked picture of Tom Brady

[01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:27.420]
They show them a naked picture of Britney Spears and then they show them a naked picture of Tom Brady

[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:32.020]
And we see what happens, okay, just kind of like spontaneously automatically

[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.080]
Squirt squirt what happens with clearance

[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.980]
So work on that while I'm away, okay, can I get back to my pull result here?

[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:45.580]
Uh Jackie Johnson for limb Martinez three who in the hell is limb Martinez? Let's put them on the phone

[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:52.320]
That's right. She's the other one was spielkeys the ray on that awful show that awful that show is the epitome what's wrong with channel seven

[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:55.880]
Oh, it's big on the channel seven you see who's coming back to do a talk show on channel six

[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:58.320]
No, Ricky. Yeah, Ricky Tiki

[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:02.420]
That was another puff piece by jikad that would have been on our website over the weekend

[01:48:02.420 --> 01:48:06.620]
I had that story in there, but unfortunately our website had a little bit of a problem named Carlos

[01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:08.260]
Terra reads got appear

[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:11.680]
Yes, she does a lovely pair according to Tom Brady

[01:48:12.940 --> 01:48:17.200]
See I've seen the pictures. I just it doesn't mean about this moment, but I've seen American pie

[01:48:18.340 --> 01:48:20.820]
Yes, she was the blue-eyed blonde girl

[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:25.760]
Who what's wrong with her? I know who you're talking about. She's cute. She is cute

[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:30.640]
I got this for a Tom Brady wouldn't be uh, he wouldn't be boning some nasty piece of crap or yeah

[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:33.540]
That's a Miguel thing that's the dolphins and just he jealous

[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.700]
That's the one that was going up with Chris Klein, but the other one

[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:41.760]
Whatever have it a Chris Klein butter when he vanished. No, he's still doing stuff. I guess. Is he? I don't see him no mo

[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.420]
And Pamela Anderson who just wanted there only moments ago a George was foaming at the wild

[01:48:46.420 --> 01:48:47.980]
I wish he had a chance to change his vote

[01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:54.120]
Swicken vote about 10 times for that bitch that disease infested bitch Pamela Anderson's got appear on

[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:57.620]
Keen they're not real, but she's got appear 266 votes

[01:48:57.620 --> 01:49:00.780]
That's not too bad considering all the grief we've had with his website today

[01:49:01.940 --> 01:49:04.200]
Now what's he uh, the same Miguel's got today off tomorrow

[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:09.900]
And I guarantee a high paid guy like him is not going to be coming in tomorrow on his day off to like try to fill the breach right

[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:11.740]
He doesn't put his deadbeat that we got now

[01:49:12.900 --> 01:49:14.680]
If you ask me to all come in

[01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:17.900]
And you don't say that. Oh, don't be such a pussy Jesus

[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:24.880]
Don't be a pus. He's a trooper wait. We don't want a trooper one of God. It's his hey. I can't do that

[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:27.060]
This guy supposed to show up for for his job

[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:31.720]
Lastly, it was some other bullshit story about he had to go up there

[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.760]
Does daddy had to go pick him up and take him to Boka and pick up his new car with the air conditioning on all these stories

[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:39.820]
No more stories no more excuses

[01:49:42.080 --> 01:49:46.820]
Jesus Christ I'm a hundred years old even I show up with me guy damn day for this crap because I like the paycheck

[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:51.640]
Okay, first in his case, maybe they just won't be no more projects way of thing. No, probably not not not for Wana

[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:57.060]
And look how far you have to commute that's right all the way from my guy damn bedroom into here about six feet

[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:01.140]
What I'd trip that is after drag my ass out of bed

[01:50:02.460 --> 01:50:05.820]
Can I mention by the way how much we liked 10 to two? Oh, yeah, whoa

[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:12.220]
How this how this is giving me my life back after they took it away. They stole it away. You bastard. You heartless bastard you

[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:18.920]
56705 60 will take some more calls. I'm just rambling. I don't know why I like it a lot

[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:24.240]
Why do you like the bedtime stories to look how that went over? The fact that you like it is not a very good witness to that

[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:26.680]
You probably like a screw me the screw the press to

[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:33.940]
Eat the press now that guy's a hoot. He's just he just calls and pontificates keeps repeating the same thing over and over again

[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:40.160]
The hook this time was meet the press. He was very articulate. He stunk on his speeches, but he was great on meet the press

[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:46.580]
By the way, if there's one guy that makes me my skin crawl. It's Tim russert. Oh, he is just ooh

[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.440]
He is brutal. In fact, Tim russert's a guy that helped get you a bush back in again in Florida

[01:50:51.440 --> 01:50:54.640]
You do know that don't you? Yes, he sliced up Bill McBride

[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.080]
He made the all kinds of you know illusions to attack cut that what attacks increased. There wasn't really come

[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:00.760]
He just he screwed up the whole election

[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:07.340]
And by the way you folks in Florida with your crappy education system and with a governor that's trying to do a tap dance

[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:12.980]
Still about the guy damn amendment the class size amendment. You've got exactly what you deserve a real piece of crap man

[01:51:12.980 --> 01:51:14.540]
a real piece of third

[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:18.020]
A bush by any other name would think the same

[01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:26.200]
What about I always told you the more devious and dangerous and lion and full of crap they are whether it was role martinis

[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:32.060]
Whether it was who's the guy in brown at the sunrise John Lamello right they like it

[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:37.900]
They like crooks they like gangsters they like liars. They just like mayor pinga pecania. There's another one for you

[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:44.560]
Like I said, I wonder who smear and hoof rollers a new joint the burger king and the pizza how to express it the airport

[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:49.180]
12 minutes Pat all the way do like pizza to express

[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:53.660]
Don't you close when I was there yesterday. I like pizza hot

[01:51:54.580 --> 01:51:57.520]
What did I call it pizza hot express? Yeah

[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:01.460]
That's what it is. Oh, you just don't like their pizza right come on

[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:04.820]
I'm talking about like if we were in a place like that. I'm not saying I would order from there

[01:52:05.340 --> 01:52:08.180]
I see and especially when we're doing the pizza loft spot next

[01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.880]
There would probably be a bad idea and I've got the copy in my hand right now and you're talking about pizza hot

[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:17.840]
Did I just say pizza blows? Yeah pizza hot pizza hot is industrial strength. As a matter of fact

[01:52:18.300 --> 01:52:22.460]
They they rule it out of a conveyor belt. It's got a flavor. I just can't uh

[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:26.080]
No, no, but the flavor is in the dough and they write it through that conveyor belt

[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:29.580]
So it's it's it's all the same. It's got that that thing

[01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:30.680]
The thing in it

[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:35.760]
Whereas at pizza loft they they whip it in the air they even go in there and see Jeff whipping it around and then the

[01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:37.620]
Crush too the dough

[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.440]
You ever see me there whipping it around all the time

[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:46.680]
Jeff is the master when it comes to great Italian cuisine and the pizza loft is going stronger than ever over there in Davie

[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.860]

Get one of these combo dinners because you can try a little bit of this and a little bit of that

[01:53:14.260 --> 01:53:19.280]
They got chicken dishes and veal and seafood three different kinds of great pizza calzones all your pasta favorites

Super subs and a best garlic rolls in history

[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.260]
You'll never break the bank at pizza loft because the portions are gigantic and the prices are teeny and tiny

[01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:33.720]
I'm university driving to engraved in 595. That's the Davie location for take-off delivery or catering call 954

[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:55.860]
Not really. I was listening to something now. Have you ever listened to something to book a bride in bid in the DCS called pizza loft a hoist? Yes

[01:56:06.340 --> 01:56:11.580]
We got the same lame story in fact pretty soon the audience would be able to recite these by heart like it's some kind of an exam

[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.140]
Thought of what I'm saying meet the press. That's where the that's where these stories are from

[01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:21.240]
Here's the call from Lake Worth. Hello

[01:56:22.900 --> 01:56:29.460]
Little male. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing great? Hey, listen a couple things. I went to the pizza law last week at a great time

[01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:34.540]
Good lunch 499 three slices in a coke man can't beat that okay very good

[01:56:35.060 --> 01:56:42.900]
Second thing is that tomorrow on Sundance to showing happiness at 11 p.m. Great and just want to know if there are any eggs out there

[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:44.600]
I need to be looking for during that movie

[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:48.980]
What does that mean?

[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:54.420]
No, just like any particular scenes that are good or anything. Oh the end of it

[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:59.720]
All the end of it. Don't miss the ending. Well, I'm just telling you this you know a lot of movies have a bad ending

[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.300]
This one has a great ending okay

[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:05.520]
Okay, well, I just want to inform that I know a lot of listeners probably want to catch that movie

[01:57:05.520 --> 01:57:09.680]
So if you've got cable and you get better after they're finished with meat to press they can catch your happiness

[01:57:10.440 --> 01:57:14.240]
Thanks, palmy take care buddy see when he said are there any eggs there to watch for you?

[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:19.580]
So I'm saying he's like I don't know if I don't say no don't don't start using that as spread most people

[01:57:19.580 --> 01:57:23.780]
I talk to even like people that seem to be fairly computer-libert. They don't know what that is

[01:57:25.360 --> 01:57:29.360]
e-ex.com got it Easter eggs e-ex.com

[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:33.900]
I'm sure it doesn't list all of the Easter eggs on all the CDs and

[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.820]
VVDs and VVDs but it's got a whole bunch

[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:42.680]
All right, you didn't like the ending in that movie you said it could have gone on a lot more until it finished

[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.300]
Well, you always say that about every movie no anything is satisfactory to you

[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:51.700]
You said the same damn thing about Magnolia which by the way Muffsa Magnolia and even he liked it

[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:53.780]
Yeah, well

[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.880]
Well, what now, oh brother what does that mean well well what mystery with you

[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.500]
That's not the point you there was something you were gonna say there that's what I was gonna say

[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:10.820]
No, it wasn't see you're getting like mo now you do you do some crap and then you back away from it like last week

[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.640]
Try to drag poor clearance out of the closet

[01:58:14.040 --> 01:58:18.100]
What a what a blow that would be to the reputation of a sports station

[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:22.760]
To have a program director who turned out to be a fact that that would be bad

[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:24.840]
You know what I'm saying never heard such a thing

[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:28.240]
It is unacceptable to the macho sports audience

[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.580]
They would be credibility of wql would go right in the turlid

[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:37.200]
So don't be spreading crap like that. It would be very detrimental to the mental health of qa m

[01:58:39.940 --> 01:58:44.620]
234 votes. We're making a little bit of progress here now that Eric finally got his fat act together

[01:58:45.020 --> 01:58:47.380]
Speaking of that and it calls from 122

[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:52.520]
Syrogesica Parker 94 or a Syracurgesica Parker right glorious Stefan

[01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:55.140]
Oh, look at that's only a two-hoss race a two-dog race

[01:58:55.140 --> 01:58:59.900]
Gloria Stefan's only got 26 J-Lo 23 in spite of the protestations of

[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:04.380]
Well, of course, you know Cubans they like big ass. Yeah, the girls the girls hot

[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:10.000]
So ready to that and let me say to get a guarantee that this woman has never seen at least not in person a real penis

[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.560]
I would bet your life on it. How do you like that? How about a fake one?

[01:59:13.300 --> 01:59:14.940]
Maybe maybe a stump penis

[01:59:16.840 --> 01:59:19.040]
That's possible like the one that Ben Affleis got

[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.340]
Mariah Carey 18 should be in the race 17

[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.140]
Pam Anderson's moving up the list George. You should be pleased. She's got seven

[01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:32.600]
Maria Bartoromo 5. Why and not only do I despise her but I can't stay in the way she says her

[01:59:32.600 --> 01:59:35.600]
Maria Bartoromo. Oh, I can't stand that bitch

[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:38.160]
I'm a rea you look so lovely today

[01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:45.280]
Let me say it for the eight minute time the people of public's only wish they had bags that big to put your groceries in

[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:52.140]
Jackie's Johnson's tied with Maria 5 that's bad. Jackie's a hot hell a lot better looking than Maria Bartoromo

[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:53.320]
That's bad

[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:59.360]
Flynn Martinez for from the spielkeys in the race show and terror reads in last place with three seeming how we told you

[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:02.760]
You're just jealous. He doesn't like her because she has no ass whatsoever

[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:07.040]
So what does that continue with anything a lot depending on who you're talking to? Oh, that's right

[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:12.220]
He's got JLo well, maybe you could shave about half a jalo's ass off and like slap that baby right on

[02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:17.200]
Well on tarazasse. Hey, there's enough for four enough for a family of six

[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.240]
Haha

[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:59.200]
It says meet the president for anybody in the age of 85

[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:06.060]
Absolutely correct sir. Tim russard is a complete whore and moron with absolutely no integrity who cares what he does

[02:01:06.060 --> 02:01:08.400]
I'm voting for Graham. He's the only one who guts it says

[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:11.400]
I've never donated money for political cost, but I sent a heart box to his campaign

[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:14.020]
I'm very proud of him. He should at least get the vice presidential nomination

[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:19.340]
I'm terribly voting for these safe choice from now on I vote my conscious. Thank you very much. We got a winner

[02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:36.120]

[02:02:37.200 --> 02:02:39.080]
But it does say me to the USA on well

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Verizon wireless line. Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello

[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:47.900]
Neil God. Yes sir speaking

[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:56.220]
Hey, um for you were a what was it on the Joe Rose show this last Saturday about the mo call the fact that

[02:02:57.540 --> 02:03:04.440]
Apparently mo call management and had them interrogate the two producers to find that Joe was lying or not lying

[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:09.820]
Yeah, okay, so to make sure that you knew about that. Well, what does that mean? Well, in other words what happened is

[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.500]
This last Saturday on the air a big heart on yeah

[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:16.360]
Exactly. Yeah Joe mentioned that that

[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:24.560]
So I'm just just Joe stand by the story that it was him who made the call no absolutely absolutely and it had a fact

[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.700]
He even on the air he even asked Dave Hagen whether or not

[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.020]
Mo would actually make the call and of course you know Dave Hagen being the wimp that he is kind of

[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:40.780]
Equivicated and basically said well it was someone who started like him, but no it was very clear that Joe was standing by his story good for you

[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:43.360]
Always like that Joe Rose man hey

[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:49.640]
I mean, what everything about about Westie Clark, you know, he really does have a a a very impressive resume and everything

[02:03:49.640 --> 02:03:54.380]
But you know, it's it's way too premature to say that you should be somehow unwanted the candidate

[02:03:54.380 --> 02:03:57.600]
I mean I asked I asked the guy specifically based on what now

[02:03:57.600 --> 02:04:02.060]
He did was give me a bunch of bull crap about how he's articular which he is not and he was great on me to press

[02:04:02.060 --> 02:04:05.520]
I mean if that's all he's got going for him save the time right and

[02:04:05.520 --> 02:04:12.120]
And it's actually no domestic record whatsoever now I will say this did you ever get a chance to read the

[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:16.120]
David Halberstam's book War and Time of Peace no I

[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:21.560]
Really hardly recommended and in the last quarter of that book it really spends a lot of time talking about cost of

[02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:26.660]
Oh, you know the battle in 1999 yeah, and that really is Clark's

[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:33.080]
Story actually and it really just revealed a lot of the pluses and and frankly a lot of the minuses of his personality

[02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:38.020]
If anyone's really considering you know, I think he's weak. I think he's very weak

[02:04:38.020 --> 02:04:41.980]
I think anyone's because I was watching I was watching those tips this weekend on the news

[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:46.220]
And I was sitting there was like rooting for him like you know come on and say something and be a little bit forceful

[02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:49.660]
And really and he was just didn't say anything

[02:04:49.660 --> 02:04:53.020]
Yeah, I'll tell you what I think good ticket would be his grand the Clark

[02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:56.480]
Okay, all right. Thank you sounds good to me

[02:04:57.620 --> 02:05:01.840]
5 6 7 0 5 what did you say about Moe you can kiss my rear end?

[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:04.100]
Okay, so in other words he stands by the story and Dave Hagen

[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:10.020]
I mean he may be waffling a little bit, but he would know see if was some punk that would you know work there about five minutes

[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:13.740]
Dave Hagen would know it was Moe right right and I just got the story from him

[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:18.760]
Think I just heard from Dave saying what they made him an offer he couldn't refuse

[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:24.600]
Really really well, I'll be damn

[02:05:25.340 --> 02:05:29.860]
So in other words the pressure is on and they're trying to like backtrack at us because well

[02:05:29.860 --> 02:05:32.920]
What differences and make it this point Moe? I mean you're you're done anyway

[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:37.360]

[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:01.640]
Very cook

[02:08:01.640 --> 02:08:06.620]
All head down. Oh, that's quite a bit simple. Why are you sometimes?

[02:08:07.140 --> 02:08:07.580]
I'm out

[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.700]
Yeah, you'll be

[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.640]
Almost there

[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.640]
Say

[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:19.760]
5,000 people visited the hospital 10 miles south of Boston and hospital

[02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:22.360]
Staffers expect another flood of visitors this week

[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:28.820]
The Virgin Mary she used to be on the bank building in where was it? Tampa clear water in clear water

[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:34.180]
That's it and then she went up in Atlanta or somewhere in some a little bum fork place in Georgia

[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:40.920]
On some then build a window of some building and now she's hanging out near Boston on a hospital building the Virgin Mary

[02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:42.840]
She sure gets around oh she

[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:48.100]
Does Tony wet yes? I interviewed some people and kind of recreated what happened in the

[02:09:50.040 --> 02:09:56.960]
You interviewed some people that's right. Yes for Howard insisted that they find out which producers were responsible for spreading those lies

[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:03.020]
Yes, Clarence asked Dave Hagen to come into his office and ask them if that if he was absolutely sure if that was Howard who

[02:10:03.020 --> 02:10:09.400]
Wait a minute and I know because Dave Hagen he don't beat around a bush. It was a one-word answer. Absolutely. Yeah

[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:16.380]
Absolutely. Yeah, there it was and then Clarence said all right just to be sure I want to ask you one more time are you absolutely sure that that was Howard who called

[02:10:18.500 --> 02:10:21.740]
Absolutely. Oh I see and David said absolutely not

[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:32.460]
So in other words there's the real story then there's the convenient to a sooth over old most story like there always is we have to pass

[02:10:32.460 --> 02:10:41.500]
A fighting old fart with the truth about how he's a curmudgeon out of control and can't stop interfering and being an asshole and then there's the politically correct story that I like to smooth it over.

[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:54.600]
And I'm going to tell you one thing about both Duff and about Clarence he may be gay what a hero. Both of them are real pussies. Okay not that that's a bulletin okay but they're real pussies.

[02:10:54.600 --> 02:11:09.800]
In like a real place of business they wouldn't be interrogating all the underlings because by now how long does it take before you finally catch on follow what I'm saying no what are you saying I'm saying that even the slowest of the slow the dumbest of the dumb the most

[02:11:09.800 --> 02:11:24.580]
Retardor of the retarded would by this point finally have caught on to what that was going on with the sky if he said it was Monday you check the counter you go out and take questionnaires in a parking lot like what they is just to be sure that's the

[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:35.820]
level of his credibility done exist no and so they're interrogating there that are grilling these people like he does this every time I didn't do that where do you get your information that's usually the

[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:42.580]
response where do you get the information like to think with the beast and then of course he intimidates these punks it's always the underlings like poor little

[02:11:42.580 --> 02:11:47.800]
Dave Hagener he's a good guy he never still afraid train he does a good job he shows up every day he's not a smith

[02:11:47.800 --> 02:11:55.240]
disturbing he don't cause any trouble he's not called up people out of the shows telling him what the hell to do and what to say what not you know what I'm saying but he does like free

[02:11:55.240 --> 02:12:02.940]
bacon there you go well good you're okay in our book Dave don't take any crap from that crusty old man next thing you know he'll be wanting you to

[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:12.500]
clean out his bag for him every morning just stay the hell away from that turd literally anyway here's a great pull I in a good news is I always told you good news is

[02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:21.080]
oh there's the new bedtime stories I was just looking at him on our poll before we freshened one away from there but the new stories are up I told you it's only 12th

[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:26.840]
the last of 1230 now you're the guy that brought Carlos in there you discovered him under the overpass being the sensitive

[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:32.860]
spec that you are you want to help him out and now you're turning on him where's the stories Carlos where's the

[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:45.600]
all morning long vision and morning and carrying on about my money yeah about my deepest and the fact of the matter is he's got all these other issues to deal with

[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:52.860]
he got the new stories on here and they're right there they are for you to peruse I mean there's what's the big hurry it's 145 degrees in the shade

[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:58.660]
the goddamn mosquitoes are the size of bowling balls why is anybody in a big hurry they'll get over to the website they'll

[02:12:58.660 --> 02:13:06.220]
eventually hop on it had a mosquito attack me in the car while it was driving down the highway and Miguel to yesterday oh no it'll

[02:13:06.220 --> 02:13:13.140]
west it'll stop me oh you know it's it's very appropriate that Miguel should be there today because I will say this for

[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:19.860]
him as much of a pussy as he is when I was down there last week he was the one one of the yet to and the

[02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:24.300]
I will get to the other momentarily but he's one of the two guilty parties who actually didn't come in

[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:28.120]
to it was pretending to put like a you know his t-shirt over his nose because he didn't want to catch

[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:34.440]
stars because I didn't go into incubation for 10 days in fact you know something I think it's a good idea now I'll go into

[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:40.440]
incubation for 10 days quarantine which means I'll have to I'll have to like did I say incubation and quarantine for 10 days

[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:49.200]
which means I have to lock the studio lock myself out on the outside yeah that sounds good to me in fact 10 days I think it

[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:56.540]
sounds like perfect timing you could lock it until we get that other schedule going but somebody else who was in the studio and

[02:13:56.540 --> 02:14:00.740]
and also was screwing up our show I should mention the over remember the day he was in their school with the equipment and

[02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:07.480]
messing up my overhead screwing up the goddamn speakers I don't want to mention that was our great chief engineer George I'm

[02:14:07.480 --> 02:14:13.760]
going to ask a little Corso should we mention that no no now let me ask you since you're there now Miguel although you

small guy I know he screwed the beast what the hell did he do to Joe Rose you tell us

[02:23:08.060 --> 02:23:13.580]
uh I missed that I guess if I played the call you probably would up I'll play the call okay this is

[02:23:13.580 --> 02:23:19.160]
a call huh thanks have a good I appreciate thank you okay thanks now which cut is it on here's

[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:24.100]
the number three I have to give you an update okay uh this allegedly a week ago Saturday and again

[02:23:24.100 --> 02:23:27.200]
there's a lot of con well there's really not any controversy except that Moe is not trying to

[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:31.280]
deny he was the one who had to call Dave Higgins says he is absolutely positive he said he would

[02:23:31.280 --> 02:23:35.600]
bet both Moe and Gellie's life on it then it was Moe who made a call off the air to Joe Rose

[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:39.220]
trying to tell him what to say what to do what to think yada yada yada it's their answer and so

[02:23:39.220 --> 02:23:43.360]
I want to give you an update of what took place just now off the air because I think it's important

[02:23:43.360 --> 02:23:49.020]
you hear this Howard would call the radio station Howard David who I get along with great I thought

[02:23:49.680 --> 02:23:55.820]
he called me an asshole saying I was trying to stir it up my point back to Howard is don't listen

[02:23:55.820 --> 02:24:00.620]
listen to one oh one point five let me see what age group one oh one point five for Howard

[02:24:00.620 --> 02:24:07.940]
maybe one oh two point seven some easily listening love music so you could focus on your wife and

[02:24:07.940 --> 02:24:14.300]
your family and the grandkids instead of listening and always calling the radio station he's

[02:24:14.300 --> 02:24:22.000]
becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boca Howard from Boca it's like you know it's okay

[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:27.700]
so anyway he's he's listening so just wanted to get the message out and don't call my show too

[02:24:27.700 --> 02:24:33.400]
just for a record don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you and I don't want to hear

[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:38.060]
you on the private line congratulations you know the private line number that's great but don't call

[02:24:38.060 --> 02:24:42.120]
because you're not coming on this show you got you've got your three hours five to eight

[02:24:42.700 --> 02:24:48.100]
Monday through Friday you can talk all you want but you're not coming on this show and we'll leave

[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:54.900]
it it down all right I got nothing against you you seem like a decent person no and I know you've

[02:24:54.900 --> 02:25:00.460]
been getting a taken a big hit on the radio station for everybody else but it's over me and you done

[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:05.940]
done by done now let me just say this to you here's another piece of evidence is the jury

[02:25:05.940 --> 02:25:11.560]
weighs in on this and examines the situation whoever it was that call let's assume we aren't

[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:16.460]
positive it was Mo okay whoever called called on a bat line absolutely okay now how many just

[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:22.960]
off the street ordinary Schmidt distributors have the inside line right right but maybe they

[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:27.520]
they producers in question just made that up and there never was a call oh maybe Dave Hagen just

[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.620]
lied about that then it wasn't on the inside line it was just somebody like on lines three or

[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:36.040]
something like that anybody believe it or the phone didn't even ring they just actually there

[02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:39.980]
never was any such a recall Dave Hagen just made it up because he's a Schmidt distributor we want

[02:25:39.980 --> 02:25:44.980]
to do create a lot of more problem from oh see look the preponderance and the evidence is so

[02:25:44.980 --> 02:25:50.420]
overwhelming here that in any quarter of law in any kindergarten classroom everybody would

[02:25:50.420 --> 02:25:54.680]
be it well you wouldn't even waste their time I mean you can go down the list why does Neil

[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.580]
Rogers despise Mo Howard David he's an asshole why does George Rodriguez despise Mo Howard David

[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.480]
it he's an asshole why does Zach hate Mo Howard David he's an asshole why did the beast hate Mo Howard

[02:26:05.480 --> 02:26:09.220]
David it he's an asshole why does Jim Mandit secretly although he's not in a position to say

[02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:14.180]
despise Mo Howard David he's an asshole why does Joe Rose despise Mo Howard David it he's an asshole

[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:18.460]
that is Hank Goldberg find him repulsive and repulsive and refuses to acknowledge his existence

[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:24.300]
he's an asshole there you go I leave anybody out but I mean you know see what I'm saying we're all wrong

[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:29.480]
and Miguel you notice I was nice to you I left you out of the equation absolutely well I mean we've

[02:26:29.480 --> 02:26:34.400]
got to save you with somebody but that's it and then I'll you people out there one of them use

[02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:39.300]
yourselves you can continue saying oh this is really some funny stick you know fine believe

[02:26:39.300 --> 02:26:42.720]
whatever the hell you want like I've told you before there's no way in the world that anybody

[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:48.240]
even with a wild hysterical imagination like I would that could create a character like this

[02:26:48.240 --> 02:26:54.360]
no not to mention the fact that his his history precedes his ass you know his bowl ass

[02:26:55.220 --> 02:26:59.900]
every place else whether it was Westwood Long whether it was the Jets whether it was the Celtics

[02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:02.640]
whether it was the Bucks you name it same story

[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:10.740]
no your reputation precedes you and believe me in the 1314 months you've been in our midst you've

[02:27:10.740 --> 02:27:16.760]
lived up to it and then some he's a hidden run and Schmidt this dude but that's what he is you know

[02:27:16.760 --> 02:27:21.780]
starts the crap behind the scenes and then goes on here very indignant I resent the take it very

[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:27.520]
personally not by all the bull crap you know all I crap and the fact of the matter is since you

[02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:31.100]
got me stood up on it I wasn't even going to talk about where did this come from or where did this

[02:27:31.100 --> 02:27:35.720]
all come from the new addition to the story which is oh I see the new the new denial there is a little

[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:39.900]
bit late isn't since this happened a week ago Saturday is a little bit slow another inquisition

[02:27:39.900 --> 02:27:46.260]
I see well the fact of the matter is we know for damn sure that wouldn't be the first time that he's

[02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:51.000]
got a history of making all these calls off here an addition to which is constantly listening to this

[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.160]
radio station this was part of the whole big thing with you and with me in him months and months

[02:31:24.420 --> 02:31:26.280]
and it's time for the

[02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:27.680]

usually i don't do this but

[02:31:36.160 --> 02:31:39.460]
let me tell you a little bit about the wheels that i drive to work in

[02:31:39.460 --> 02:31:45.300]
now i'm not trying to be rude but you can really get screwed by those dealers trying to sell your

[02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:50.320]
automobiles brand new see i don't need the fancy grills all those new cops man

[02:31:50.320 --> 02:31:54.880]
i've had my baby 20 years shifting on those stripped out gears to the hongo

[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:56.740]
and the hongo

[02:31:57.440 --> 02:32:03.880]
it got a four on the floor it got a four of its doors but not a hell of a lot more it needs a

[02:32:03.880 --> 02:32:09.300]
brand new ignition it got a broken transmission it got some holes in the body got front and

[02:32:09.300 --> 02:32:15.200]
rear fenders missing leaks like the son of a gun but i'm like so what it runs it's a piece of

[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:17.260]
you know what baby but at least it's paid for all

[02:32:17.260 --> 02:32:22.180]
one or three it's a real piece we can relate to that oh here's the fact is what did you

[02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:26.360]
roll sand here that prompted most alleged call they have to put legend there because we know

[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:33.260]
Dave Hagen is like a pulse of lyre a little bit a little bit of the background just very briefly

[02:32:33.260 --> 02:32:38.740]
because i'm on a 12 more than other two three hours is that uh joe was mentioning on a year that

[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:45.500]
the the conflict the rift between moe and gildey was growing and that you could it was palpable

[02:32:45.500 --> 02:32:49.260]
you can hear it on the ear the fact that there was a certain hostility in the run that morning show

[02:32:49.260 --> 02:32:54.200]
right which uh everybody been talking about that i mean it's not a secret everybody who listens

[02:32:54.200 --> 02:33:00.260]
knows it everybody right everybody and moe became indignant about that and if it was him the

[02:33:00.260 --> 02:33:03.640]
essence of the call was what are your full of crap and you're a backstabber and you're a liar

[02:33:03.640 --> 02:33:07.360]
blah blah blah blah and uh nobody there's nothing going on in gildey and i get along wonderful and

[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:12.420]
you're you're stirring the pot you're stirring up trouble and stuff like that and quite frankly i

[02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:20.680]
can't imagine anybody else in the world on the inside private line calling in and spouting that can

[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:26.300]
you know oh okay you don't have to chuckle at the end there you have to do a little bird thing

[02:33:26.300 --> 02:33:30.340]
and they're very you know straightforward question i think the annual we try to stay with you

[02:33:30.340 --> 02:33:34.800]
that's it but of course uh we don't know if i call at all ever again and

[02:33:39.240 --> 02:33:44.180]
first of all anybody knows david hangin i don't know if they've really well but david is not a he's

[02:33:44.180 --> 02:33:48.420]
just a unknown nonsense kid you know he's not the kind of guy that's not like the beast now the

[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:52.320]
beast would have been accused i could say yeah the beast on it you know because that's his style

[02:33:52.320 --> 02:33:57.260]
he's the kind of trouble making little uh yenta that would do something like that in fact now that

[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:01.900]
we think about the beast knows the inside line i'm gonna go oh how is this howard impersonation

[02:34:01.900 --> 02:34:07.660]
i don't know but we could turn the christ yeah oh that that was the beast wow

[02:34:11.180 --> 02:34:12.820]
this is starting to get pretty thick

[02:34:15.300 --> 02:34:20.180]
that's some water that that's the only possibility that's the only person not that i want to

[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:23.440]
throw the beast out of the bus because can you imagine what that bus would look like when we

[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:30.780]
finished it roly crap it is really bus like yeah like one of those exactly i was looking for the

[02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:34.620]
conversion chart the temperature conversion chart which i found here it's 90 90 today 91

[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:39.240]
tomorrow next two days here in Toronto yeah but you could probably still breathe the air now you

[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:42.900]
can still breathe although we do have a small advisory because it's real steamy but the humidity is

[02:34:42.900 --> 02:34:48.360]
only 42 percent wouldn't you just die for only 42 percent i'm gonna just die when i leave this building

[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:53.300]
today in the 90s for like so i got back in town for the howard which i like the howard whether

[02:34:53.300 --> 02:34:57.700]
as long as it's not humid and stifling and suffocating you catch my drift uh-huh good anyway i

[02:34:57.700 --> 02:35:01.900]
was just looking for that and i found at the same time another one i had sitting around with all my

[02:35:01.900 --> 02:35:06.240]
crap uh the it was a facts from a listener who said the big libosky is a great movie carlis is full of

[02:35:06.240 --> 02:35:12.480]
urine now did we decide about that he said that he liked it but he thought you wouldn't like it

[02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:15.860]
therefore he didn't recommend or you haven't seen it no i haven't seen it see i asked Miguel

[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:18.340]
about that but i don't think Miguel sees any movies where they speak english

[02:35:21.300 --> 02:35:28.480]
rarely what's the last movie you saw can pass a USA the movie matrix oh well what's you know

okay that's long enough for you want me to let him speak to you

[02:49:01.040 --> 02:49:03.660]
please the congress working on prescription drug

[02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:07.120]
benefits for older americans oh yes they continue drag now what's the

[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:10.640]
upshot it's very convoluted this thing about the canadian pharmacies that

[02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:13.560]
are selling drugs in the u.s. to senior citizens that save it from being ripped

[02:49:13.560 --> 02:49:16.300]
off so bad and save it in many case fifty percent more on the

[02:49:16.300 --> 02:49:20.560]
prescriptions and they're trying to put the kebash on at any the

[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:24.120]
the uh... one of the committees one of the set of committees remember the end

[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:28.940]
of the week they as they overruled it right and they said that they can

[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:31.760]
that it's nothing illegal about it and again no it doesn't uh

[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:36.260]
heart it represents no threat to the public safety but uh you know it's it's

[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:39.900]
not gonna go through but in the meantime just wondering what the status is

[02:49:39.900 --> 02:49:44.160]
anybody now i don't know because everywhere you go you see signs like on my

[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.540]
on a p.o. box places check about discount uh

[02:49:48.540 --> 02:49:52.400]
canadian pharmacy you know prescriptions all that stuff i don't want to say no

[02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:55.120]
no you don't because you don't take any drugs that are like illegal

[02:49:56.400 --> 02:50:00.360]
i take aspirin now now this is interesting now Miguel has just

[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:00.800]
uh...

[02:50:03.180 --> 02:50:07.520]
you see here's a guy that's so conscientious he just wants to do something he

[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:10.840]
wants to make it also feel like he earned his uh... pay today he's not

[02:50:11.240 --> 02:50:14.520]
conscientious he is not so i'm saying in spite of what you uh... all the stories

[02:50:14.520 --> 02:50:18.420]
you told me how much he's making and then he wants to earn every penny of it

[02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:21.280]
i mean like last year when we didn't have a best of and you like blamed him for

[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:24.300]
it and come to find out was because of your lazy ass not because of Miguel

[02:50:25.760 --> 02:50:28.260]
because you were too lazy to put the material together right

[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:33.340]
is that what it was sure well i'd like to argue over spilt milk okay over

[02:50:33.340 --> 02:50:36.940]
caused that were made by mowa we go Saturday on a jr.o. show let's have a

[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:42.180]
clean slate okay wipe it clean with both hands from the back to front

[02:50:43.540 --> 02:50:44.320]
wqa m

[02:50:44.800 --> 02:50:46.640]
you know how are you pretty good sir

[02:50:46.640 --> 02:50:50.500]
hey a couple things you know about last week i was a certain

[02:50:50.500 --> 02:50:53.900]
of jr.o.s that morning as a matter of fact i was very hungry over and i was

[02:50:53.900 --> 02:50:57.460]
just listening to the radio and you know when he came on there's no way he could

[02:50:57.460 --> 02:51:00.540]
that i mean it was just you know for one minute for the next i mean it just

[02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:04.020]
seems very real to me but that's the time point

[02:51:05.120 --> 02:51:08.940]
um... with with mowa i would hate to see him go because it's been so much fun

[02:51:08.940 --> 02:51:12.240]
all the mileage he got mad at the way he's not going anywhere

[02:51:12.620 --> 02:51:15.040]
okay i wouldn't be that either well we know whatever man but

[02:51:15.040 --> 02:51:19.080]
hey no let me tell you he has a year and eight or nine months left in that

[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:22.540]
contract and i guarantee you he's such a hard-ass if they make him get up at

[02:51:22.540 --> 02:51:24.900]
two thirty in the morning and come and change everybody's under where he's

[02:51:24.920 --> 02:51:25.620]
talking to you out

[02:51:27.400 --> 02:51:30.340]
okay and i also you heard a poll last week i don't know for the

[02:51:30.340 --> 02:51:32.620]
poll but you mentioned whether that was for all for all

[02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:37.600]
voice or not yeah and i i i i think you do it and the reason i said that is that i

[02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:41.020]
read this medical study this is very rare but there's a medical condition where

[02:51:41.020 --> 02:51:44.240]
people are born where there's sphincter muscles and their vocal cords

[02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:48.720]
switched really actually i think he's got to sphincter muscles but then it's

[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:52.080]
right though and far like when he's far it sounds like a symphony

[02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:56.660]
okay thanks for the vote of confidence okay there's a little shot at

[02:51:56.660 --> 02:52:01.380]
for all those climedia but if you had anything better than my dry gas on

[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:01.780]
a Monday

[02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:08.260]
uh i'd like to see him blow some dry gas right in the beast push which i think is

[02:52:08.260 --> 02:52:11.660]
what he did is i scorned Scott that makes up for the fact he's

[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:15.640]
see it was just like the giant Henry business that franchise it's always i don't

[02:52:15.640 --> 02:52:18.480]
know how i get into this okay because in the beginning remember when they

[02:52:18.480 --> 02:52:21.600]
at i would do when we first got to marlin's i used to go to all the games a lot of

[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:25.740]
games and sitting those crappy seats over the behind first base i mean the seats

[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:28.480]
were good but it was just that it was behind jabboosh and all his right wing

[02:52:28.480 --> 02:52:32.440]
republican friends including that big tank from teleassie is number one fundraiser

[02:52:32.440 --> 02:52:37.540]
i waited about 800 pounds and i went and then of course you know you start

[02:52:37.540 --> 02:52:40.320]
losing interest because it was boring is all hell it was a hundred

[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:44.300]
degrees in the shade and then they win the series 97 a Wayne sold everything off

[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:46.800]
by the way there's an interesting book it's called um

[02:52:46.800 --> 02:52:53.300]
uh if they don't win it's a shame the year the marlin's bought the world

[02:52:53.300 --> 02:52:58.160]
series by Dave Rosenbaum you read that i'm sure judge right oh yeah i got my

[02:52:58.160 --> 02:53:00.580]
final minutes ashamed to get a marlin's bought the world series and then

[02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:03.840]
actually paid all those guys they won a world series then he uh as we all know he

[02:53:03.840 --> 02:53:07.060]
as promised because they wouldn't build up a new stadium like a little spore

[02:53:07.060 --> 02:53:12.440]
child he had dismembered the theme he disemboweled it and then we had

[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:15.300]
little john henry and his quizzlings and remember the day that they hit him on

[02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:18.400]
the first team and i walk into building oh hi Neil somebody can drink and they

[02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:21.700]
looked at me like oh like frankenstein just walked in yeah i'm the

[02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:24.920]
enemy it's because any arrangers nobody shows up out there right

[02:53:26.220 --> 02:53:30.360]
right bullcrap to your fault in forels doing the same craft now well i don't

[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.920]
care what the arranger says what he thinks about the marlin's it's really

[02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:36.220]
and then finally he admits to me that in spite of what it says in the box

[02:53:36.220 --> 02:53:39.600]
where he has today ten thousand this is a team that's now almost five hundred

[02:53:40.480 --> 02:53:44.120]
they swept the series against the uh week admittedly week devil raised but

[02:53:44.120 --> 02:53:47.840]
nevertheless and he said if there was three thousand people there was a lot

[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:53.060]
so who's kidding who huh would you eat yesterday i had a lot of everything i

[02:53:53.060 --> 02:53:56.120]
went to the marlin's game and i've been able to i've been able to pull some

[02:53:56.120 --> 02:54:02.580]
halfway down my leg i think to be ankle to be honest with

[02:54:02.580 --> 02:54:06.000]
but anyway he's a great guy we love having him here even a wasteful of crap and

[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:09.020]
at least that he better late than ever he admitted about the twenty five

[02:54:09.020 --> 02:54:13.320]
hundred people there yesterday at tops maybe five six seven oh five

[02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:17.520]

[02:54:32.940 --> 02:54:37.440]
website what do you remember that page or just the fact he put the stories on

[02:54:37.440 --> 02:54:41.200]

[02:54:41.200 --> 02:54:47.620]
oh yeah you need to say no seriously what did i say that's what it said and then it goes into a

[02:54:47.620 --> 02:54:53.920]
sort of a humorous explanation of his predicament oh that's on my page on the homepage right on

[02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:59.420]
at least for me anyway air candidate deal thrown into doubt i'm reading from the Toronto star website

[02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:03.920]
the union representing air candidate pilots has told its members to stop voting on

[02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:07.620]
the tentative new deal at both sides have said is essentially troubled airlines restructuring

[02:57:07.620 --> 02:57:12.760]
a recent arbitrators ruling that tramples the seniority rights of air candidate pilots has put

[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:17.460]
that agreement on the survival of the carrier in jeopardy the air candidate pilots association

[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:22.680]
be saying ready for that no we've asked air candidate pilots to withhold their vote on the

[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:26.640]
collective agreements and the until the hour and the head said when so on so they just can't

[02:57:26.640 --> 02:57:32.100]
wrap it all up ok so we have to keep sitting on pins and needles especially those of my good

[02:57:32.100 --> 02:57:35.700]
friends down there who work for air candidate and especially those of us who don't want to be flying

[02:57:35.700 --> 02:57:40.800]
american airline oh no please say no way Jose now you didn't mind me to bitch out the

[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:46.920]
clift the pool man hey bitch out clift the pool man don't forget okay so anyway i don't

[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:51.200]
remember what the hell day it was come home from work one day last week in sunny hot human

[02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:55.800]
south Florida suffocating south Florida and uh John standing in the doorway of the up patio and

[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:58.600]
looking out he says we got a problem we got a problem

[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:04.160]
and it comes to fight out the illegally in lawn service that i have they have

[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:10.700]
back into the my pool heater oh no and you know how you have the piping that goes from your pool

[02:58:10.700 --> 02:58:17.600]
heater to the filter etc right your pool well they knocked it and they broke it and evidently

[02:58:17.600 --> 02:58:20.700]
there have been water just pouring out all of the goddamn place and John went out and figured

[02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:25.060]
out how to turn the damn thing off so the thing is broken and the guy says to me very apologetically

[02:58:25.060 --> 02:58:30.300]
i'm sorry the guy is an idiot and whatever it is we'll pay the bill and it's just broken piping

[02:58:30.300 --> 02:58:34.340]
i don't think it's that big of a deal so i immediately go in a house i get on a phone and i call

ninth time he's done it last two or three weeks and now we're like almost up to another year on

[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:14.360]

on and on and on until probably we all croak what do you laugh at about you know what i'm talking

[03:01:21.380 --> 03:01:26.420]
about here all of these assholes every minute of every day they're listed and they're loving it so

[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:31.840]
much they're squeezing themselves and just like everything else we've talked about if it's movies they

[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:35.720]
don't like it if i just mentioned the only reason i'm talking about the pool thing is because i

[03:02:29.840 --> 03:02:34.040]
well that's great Cliff but get your ass out there it's not a major job it's not the end of the

[03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:38.700]
world it's a couple of pieces of tubing that need to be fixed you know kind of like the ones you

[03:02:38.700 --> 03:02:45.140]
got in your back room yeah schmuck good column by marine doubt is always nested in New York times

[03:02:45.140 --> 03:02:50.960]
that i read it yeah i think i can pronounce the words in it too he says looking back you have to

[03:02:50.960 --> 03:02:54.620]
wonder if runny and satimer in two completely different movies runny starring in a heroic war

[03:02:54.620 --> 03:02:59.360]
adventure like sands of iwo jima while satimer was scheming in a slick heist caper like oceans

[03:02:59.360 --> 03:03:04.280]
eleven with a soundtrack by frank sonopera using the raki dictators favorite songs franches in the night

[03:03:04.740 --> 03:03:09.680]
could we have been at war with someone who wasn't fighting back in iraq rummy wanted to prove this

[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:13.760]
that the sleek high tech american military could be used to fight in unconventional ways but maybe

[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:17.740]
satimer who gives creepy new meaning to the phrase ultimate survivor was playing an even more

[03:03:17.740 --> 03:03:22.260]
unconventional game what if he never meant to mount a last stand in Baghdad merely spread word

[03:03:22.260 --> 03:03:25.900]
that there was a dread red line of chemical and germore heads bringing the capital to give

[03:03:25.900 --> 03:03:30.980]
himself time to melt away into subterranean safety two nights before the war began kuse or

[03:03:30.980 --> 03:03:35.200]
as minions were busy plundering a billion dollars from a rack central bank as u.s. tanks spent

[03:03:35.200 --> 03:03:39.120]
through a rack meaning surprisingly little opposition except for fedean harassment

[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:43.160]
satimer have been burning records of his weaponizing and terrorizing it probably already

[03:03:43.160 --> 03:03:47.740]
hidden and destroyed any bad stuff during the years the bush he spent trash talking about whooping

[03:03:47.740 --> 03:03:51.880]
him maybe he decided that rather than hit america with biological warfare he would use psychological

[03:03:51.880 --> 03:03:56.560]
warfare discrediting the u.s. with allies by stripping the anthrax coverings with the tarant

[03:03:56.560 --> 03:04:00.480]
sending out doubles in public while he plotted his getaway or making loyalists pretend to be double

[03:04:00.480 --> 03:04:05.100]
agents dishing fake tips to the CIA about where the ace of spades was dining so the u.s. would

[03:04:05.100 --> 03:04:09.120]
bomb the wrong places sought a new how hard it would be for americans to rely and trust

[03:04:10.300 --> 03:04:14.660]
rely on and understanding in a part of world that we don't understand where nobody trust us

[03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:19.460]
he had 12 years between wars and bushes after all the plot rooses his captured tap of the tent

[03:04:19.460 --> 03:04:23.260]
and this told american interrogators that he fled the syria with sottam sons after the war until

[03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:27.820]
syria expelled them and that sottam was hiding in a rack maybe sottam has been tortling from the

[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:31.740]
sidelines as his gorillas and islamic villains kill enough u.s. soldiers to make americans

[03:04:31.740 --> 03:04:36.620]
queasy maybe he couldn't flame an Iraqi rebellion over chaotic conditions to expel the occupiers

[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:40.960]
who came with no occupation plan or if sottam brought a plastic surgeon underground with him

[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:45.600]
perhaps he could resurface as a fresh face a populous candidate and in vice-royd bremmer's first

[03:04:45.600 --> 03:04:51.080]
democratic elections after all bath in him of his party trans lights as resurrection it's

[03:04:51.080 --> 03:04:54.140]
funny that the bush he didn't recognize the heist when they saw when given that they pulled off

[03:04:54.140 --> 03:04:58.100]
such a clever heist of their own they cracked the safe of american foreign policy and made

[03:04:58.100 --> 03:05:03.160]
awful generations of resistance to preemptive and unilateral attacks on friday senators on the

[03:05:03.160 --> 03:05:07.540]
intelligence committee cut a deal that lets a thorough review i.e. a republican whitewash go

[03:05:07.540 --> 03:05:11.480]
forward into whether the spy community ginned up pre-war intelligence the democrats already

[03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:17.000]
fowsted by their pre-war fear of being panty waste naturally caved on open hearings open closed

[03:05:17.000 --> 03:05:21.340]
who cares congress is looking for it in the wrong place the scrutinizing those who gather the

[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:25.880]
intelligence rather than those who pushed to distort it george tenet might have buttered up his

[03:05:25.880 --> 03:05:29.880]
bosses by not objecting loud enough when the bush is latched on to bogus or exaggerated claims

[03:05:29.880 --> 03:05:35.120]
but if obsequiousness is a subject of congressional investigation we're in for a busy summer the hawk

[03:05:35.120 --> 03:05:39.520]
started with sottams demise and worked backwards as the latest new republic reports that it's

[03:05:39.520 --> 03:05:44.960]
deception democracy cover article in the summer of two thousand two vice president chaining

[03:05:44.960 --> 03:05:49.660]
made several visits to the cia langley headquarters which were understood within the agency is an

[03:05:49.660 --> 03:05:53.820]
attempt to pressure the low level specialist interpreting the wrong intelligence that would freak

[03:05:53.820 --> 03:05:57.740]
people out said one former cia official it's supposed to be an ivory tower and that kind of

[03:05:57.740 --> 03:06:02.600]
pressure would be enormous on these young guys it's scary all right dig cheney's hot breath

[03:06:02.600 --> 03:06:04.000]
on your raw files

[03:06:11.840 --> 03:06:15.360]
we have mercilessly taken the following material out of context without endorsement or

[03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:18.180]
permission from those depicted it is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and

[03:06:18.180 --> 03:06:21.960]
decent look as ridiculous as possible we hope we reach that goal or at least major laugh

[03:06:21.960 --> 03:06:27.880]
