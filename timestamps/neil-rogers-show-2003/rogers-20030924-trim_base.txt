[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180]
Anyway, good morning, Neil morning Scott. Yeah, you're right about that dude

[00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.720]
You could have put you could have that was like the atomic clock man when a little hand hit the big head at 10 o'clock

[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.420]
Wow, that was exciting. I'm just ready. I'm trying to keep things on track for you because you know if it wasn't for you and I

[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.040]
They wouldn't even have a station here. So I'm taking four or five time. Let me ask you this question there

[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.840]
Are you doing a special thing to bar night at the game? Yeah, but it's what 14,000 will show up

[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.560]
I know what kind of crap is that I'm looking into paper this morning. I asked George is hosting this morning

[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.780]
I asked George before duck him in was crying about gonorrhea puss

[00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.640]
I was asking George was it raining last night or was there like some kind of a natural disaster? No no problems

[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.220]
25,000 311 for Don trail and the Phillies and the wild card all of these things it's pathetic

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.200]
That's terrible. I mean they're playing for the world and no one goes. I mean you're right. This town's full of losers

[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.240]
No one cares. I mean it's gonna be as bad as being a pirate fan when the pirates were gonna play us

[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.080]
They would always have like an entire upper deck open. That's what it looked like in the Marlins playoff

[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:07.600]
This is pathetic. I thought I thought serious they have at least 35,000 so listen to this Fox National you know Joe Buck and

[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.560]
Tim McCarver. They're doing a national piece on

[00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.020]
On me for this weekend's games really and

[00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:23.260]
They're talking about how I've inspired the Marlins fans and if they only knew that there are no Marlins fans and that the whole thing

[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.780]
It's gonna be a big on a wrong you didn't inspire the Marlins fans you inspired the Marlin team when you came to town

[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.500]
That's when a Marlins turned it around when Jack McKean turned 85. Yeah came to town on the air

[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760]
That's when all of a sudden they turned it around it turns out he's firing a Marlin fans

[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.900]
It's like saying we're having a party in a cemetery

[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.980]
Yeah, it turns out that Jack McKean for the first time in five years is regular now

[00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.500]
He has a regular dump every day of his movement. All right

[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.460]
Yeah, he was real he was real constipated until I came to town and now he's just how much fun

[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.580]
They made it him when he first when he first hired him and that crap about well

[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.400]
You know there's the race discrimination and they got fine and all this other crap and it's just a daughter about Howard today

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:04.320]
Howard so desperate he puts on the key and calls Lake the key is gonna be on today at 7 30's gonna be their guest

[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.240]
And he's a call that's three minutes to eight. He still put him on

[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.260]
Absolutely, I mean my god. Oh, and just a piss off power even more

[00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:19.500]
I moved like a mile from his Jew neighborhood and I'm moving in and how many have parties and I'm gonna have naked women and

[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.040]
Yelling and screaming in live bands so that Phyllis can hear me rocking over and I moved into the fancy place

[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.580]
Boca-Chay

[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.440]
He lives in the old excitement. She's had about 20 years. He lives in the limited income neighborhood. Yeah, that's limited

[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.340]
He lives in a villa. I live in a grand

[00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.080]
Golf tournament was sponsored on a station with your name on it

[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.920]
And they behind your back arranged to fly an OJ Simpson to beat your golf tournament in Pearson humanly you help

[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.100]
His stuff would you be at that? Oh actually Greg Reed did do that to me. He has some big huge golf tournament going on

[00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.560]
He shut down my golf tournament and bear us me with all my clients ruin my bus

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.440]
So they haven't go cut a deal behind his back and see how he likes that when I do business with a bunch of dirty

[00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.920]
Costa Ricans with millions of dollars and illegal cigars and a bunch of dirty hordes with simplest to give Howard diseases

[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.420]
Incidentally one other thing Neil today has got us my witness and Josh Darryl sought Howard David

[00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.200]
Try to grab my sack and was within one inch of my balls when I jump back and smack

[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.760]
He loves it baby. Yes man boobs and he tried to grab my sack

[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.460]
I live a nice day

[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.100]
Absolutely

[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.800]
Qem.com

[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.020]
Wow no grabs for the old Pharrell sack. I don't hear no music great open or anything

[00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.760]
I don't get there my friends on me

[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.600]
Well, Scott you know something a lot of stress

[00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.120]
Manage I

[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.540]
S***

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.460]
I don't know the button isn't it funny how some tastes just take you back like when you were a teenager

[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:49.260]
Remember sitting on your porch on a cool summer evening popping a zit with your fingers and then eating it

[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.240]
Well the great taste is back at the Puzz ballast

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.980]
Yes delicious creamy sump sir pus in a cone or a dish with your choice of toppings

[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.980]
All the great tastes of your body you enjoyed as a kid like warm hero acts

[00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:11.240]
Scabchiefs and our new booker bits the Puzz ballast ice cream you scream. We all scream for us. Thanks for the inspiration

[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.120]
Muff Muff lens here operations manager came in early this morning right and early

[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.920]
Head tears in his eyes was very emotional about gonorrhea pus. Yeah, well, I get emotional about that too

[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.900]
Well, we all have our problems. Okay. We all have our crosses to bear enough. Okay. Give me the name of what's his name doctor

[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.480]
Ove bend over

[00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.780]
So I got it extrapolated but I'm really whipped up and see for all got me all whipped up excited with that cross over this morning

[00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.220]
No, seriously, I have extrapolated it in this last two trends

[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.340]
Yeah, I'm figuring that he's already beating out. I'm Paul and young Ron and old Ron by handling men

[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.540]
But even Howard sperm because how it's firm even though he's still number one with a six two men

[00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.760]
He he's down about two points from like the usual eight something

[00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.760]
And it had that happens starting like in June when for all one on between eight and ten sure

[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.280]
So I think that when you were scrappling when we get them the hour by hour next month

[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.960]
I think you're gonna find out that he's already eight to ten beaten out Howard sperm and handling beat now old Paul and older Ron

[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.320]
Or whatever their names are now pretty exciting. That is exciting. It's going for all. Okay. You pervert sure

[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.560]
Wish he was on it seven sure wish you could get I wish he was on it six

[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.980]
Oh, can you begin to imagine what numbers we'd have he was on it?

[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.620]
I think most getting old enough five to six sounds good to me

[00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.180]
But anyway George had nice bonding experience with mo this morning

[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:31.440]
He room or what you're saying to you. I said no. We were washing up together

[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.320]
In the same you have like surgical gloves on or no, he used to get too close to a guy that picks dingleberries out of his button front of everybody else

[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.720]
Well, I always commiserating with us even Moe who hates us like poison and trying to get both of us

[00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.560]
Can't even moe commiserates on it. O.J. Gothamethin that was one of the lowest moments in the history of abroad casting

[00:05:53.560 --> 00:06:00.400]
He said only a scumbag station would consort with murder like that. Right see even moe can't stand you

[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.000]
O.J. hates you like poison even a low-life scumbag old you like moe Howard David and can't stand O.J. Simpson

[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.460]
Hates you wishes you would die a wicked death wishes you get in return

[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.820]
What you gave to poor Nicole and Ron you murdering son of a bitch you and in the meantime Greg and

[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.900]
Screw in and fill us in a bunch of our sports there's a they're still obsessed with O.J.

[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.600]
They they would rim him if he came in right now they'd lick his ass

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:27.260]
I'm telling you right now that there'd be a fight to see you could get to the crack first and his ass too

[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.220]
We asked yesterday

[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.820]
The best fast food chain we got two pulls today

[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.460]
We don't have time to dick around because it's Wednesday

[00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:41.020]
We got the big noon to one of us. Seriously for all got me all whipped up to a frenzy. They don't know why we haven't even gotten into the pus yet

[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.540]
We haven't even gotten into the pus although dust working on it

[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.040]
What a pussy he is man. What a well. I guess that was a bad choice of words

[00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.700]
In the same context well, you know the very upset about those bodily fluids. No, they're not

[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.100]
No, they're not tough. Okay. Maybe I'll draw you a diaphragm. Okay a pus field. They got to be a pus diet field a diaphragm

[00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.340]
We asked yesterday which I guess is probably not a good the time to me give the pull result in context with that the best fast food chain

[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.220]
Now we did this you know a long time ago

[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.840]
We can't do it different on every goddamn day although we have two pulls today. We've never done either one of them how do you like that?

[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.120]
Huh? Yeah, pretty good. How do you do that every day?

[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.380]
Neil how do you come up with something new and innovative and exciting?

[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:27.160]
Well, I don't know the best fast food chain is hands down your pants when these

[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.600]
277 it's juicy. It's the leash. What's not to like right?

[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:38.940]
Right Dave Thomas is felling somewhere in heaven somewhere in in hamburger purgatory Dave Thomas has got a big smile on his fat

[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:44.420]
Push 277 everybody like Dave Thomas didn't I did you know anybody who didn't like him?

[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.860]
Nope, and you know all kinds of good stuff in the community

[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.620]
He was a soft food a boy and gave all kinds of money to cheer the only bad thing was he was friends with Tony Cigreno

[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.080]

Just edging out 91 like I said edging out quizz nose with 86 quizz nose done very good

[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.160]

Well, no there were a lot of people lined up for the free Marlon tickets

[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:37.380]
Spinning the deal for the free tickets, but nobody was into it to quote Miguel

[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.180]
He says oh nobody wants your CDs this year. Thanks Miguel

[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.600]

[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:19.180]
Rally some huh rallies. No, not rallies. That's another one. Now you get warm

[00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.820]
It was like on biscuit

[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.160]
Just north of 79 on a on the right hand side on the east side. Okay back in the IOD days. I can picture it

Yeah, and that was great a great place and they last too long

[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.780]
But really good places don't stick around

[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:41.760]
Minisev's 24 which used to be a lot better till they decided they want to be in bed with the donor places in the ice being a

Why I like it to chicken kitchen

[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.860]

It's not a fantastic anyway. The first pull is up this hour

[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.640]
If we had a election for president today and these were the choices who would you vote for Ted Kennedy for the Democrats and George W

[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.380]
Bush for the Republic of Coons first 20 votes people have discovered that it's on air Ted Kennedy nine

[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.900]
I wouldn't vote six George W Bush five. That's how it's going so far

[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.720]
Now you know there was a lady on there Scott and I was gonna go to her first because then the ladies are very impatient

[00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.020]
The on the phone and she's already gone. Yep. What what is that all about? I don't know God you know

[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.240]
My Emmy on line seven hello

[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.120]
Hello, yes sir. Hey Neil actually I was I mean it's nice talking to you

[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.780]
But I called asking how can I send a hundred bucks to your abandoned pet network?

[00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:16.720]
I'm cause and they just put me on hold and I guess they're sending you to you now

[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.600]
Are we gonna talk about to do or to tell him what to do? Okay, excellent. See there you go

[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:34.340]
Well, that'll put us over 23,000 five. I mean this is really embarrassing and I understand and you look at Marlon attendance and

[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.740]
It's easy to not but it's just this year

[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.680]
I was telling muff this morning while he was in the middle of all those tears about the gastrointestinal

[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.060]
Apust or what you're gonna read or whatever he's got

[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.020]
That it's scary. There is really just nobody there

[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:51.860]
I mean there's enough there are enough people there with the kids in school and school buses and the traffic nightmares to make it

[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.560]
Hell driving, but they're just not enough people there to accomplish anything and it seems to be like a new phenomenon

[00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.720]
It's not just during the summertime it goes all the way until the so-called season starts the only people are there kids

[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.720]
They got people with punky kids in school and that's it right

[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.180]
Well people who just can't get that all out

[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.820]
Hold me in. No, what is this North-Might be based chicken kitchen hopes to expand into Chicago and laws Vegas

[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.760]
How do you like that never heard? Mr.

[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.820]
Mr. the bird that what kind of a name is that the order of this thing?

[00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:22.680]
Mr. the

[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.240]
Bird the rate

[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.340]
I never saw that with a capital E on the end with an ascent though, but what is that?

[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.880]
That never saw the name that's got a capital E on the end of it. Did you? Nope must it's obviously a French thing mr.

[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.720]
But a rate said he thought his stores needed to go to the gym and put on some lipstick

[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.520]
So chicken kitchen offered a great product

[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.500]
But allows you look he spent a year and a half and 150 to 200 grand to give it a facelift

[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:50.740]
All the stores are gonna be refashioned the franchise will have five years to upgrade

[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.860]
Menu prices will hold steady still as cheapest traditional fast food he said and the audio de audio

[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.960]
So they're trying to expand anybody to go to Chicago and Vegas and according to some of the people in the audience

[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.920]
It's sensationally old chicken kitchen never heard of it

[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.640]
By the way, this pull we're gonna be doing later

[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.380]
Which wouldn't start on any time since it is Wednesday and we got that one to two comedy vets are which really frauds some people

[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:11.860]
We don't care

[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.280]
Who is your favorite sportscaster of all time?

[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.000]
Now I wanted to do it because we could have done a series of those two

[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.900]
But because we have a lot of people in science don't care about sports that would be bad

[00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:25.480]
So unlike the dead people let's stick with you know, we can have dead sports casters on here

[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:30.400]
But sports casters covering play by play color guard guys people at talk sports on the air like the Humper

[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.720]
People like that

[00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.340]
So that's that's the list I started with so far. Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time?

[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.980]
This will be the second pull today the main event

[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:44.040]
Here's the list so far Rick Weaver Mel Allen Red Barber Jim Mandage Hank Goldberg. I hate sports

[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:49.680]
We have to have that on there because we get a lot of votes. I hate sports Joe Bowen bill Hewitt Fred Qsick Bob Prince Vincoli

[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.020]
Foster Hewitt or Sonny Hersh. That's a good list so far

[00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:55.840]
You even George would agree with that and he don't know what it out. We're talking about what you know

[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.560]
Who a lot of those people are? I know what you're talking about sports

[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.640]
Right so that's gonna be the second pull 50 votes on the presidential pool

[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.880]
Just close your eyes and pray and wish that we had that election right now

[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.440]
I'll tell you one thing for fat Ted Kennedy set in shape a quid and that dead bitch's side Mary Joe compact me

[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.160]
She's still dead setting that aside man

[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:21.000]
He's had one of the few people that's had the balls him and Howard Dean to open up a mouth and really blast this this lying son of a bitch

[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.180]
That we got there until it like it is poor Teddy

[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.840]
Yeah, he paid his patents. He could have been a contender

[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:33.260]
If we had the election right now today Ted Kennedy 25 I wouldn't vote 13 George W. Bush 12

[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.140]
How do you like that? Huh? How do you look at green apples? I'll take it

[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.160]
I'll speak of this fudge that's the reason I play that the George reporting

[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.400]
Guess what's on the top news? It's a

[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:48.160]
Naked ass. I guess you miss make it guys ass miss fudge probably really into that big time

[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.800]
So to speak figuratively speaking man, of course man

[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:57.060]
As the final days of the historic California recall election year another historic development is unfolded behind the scenes

[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.280]
Behind the scenes is a little play on words probably

[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.940]
Campaign operatives are scrambling to contain full-newity rodic photographs taken by controversial

[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:11.240]
Robert maple Thorpe full-new photographs of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's his controversialist

[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:19.620]
Yeah, that's what it says the controversialist the shocking news of Republican Schwarzenegger been kept under lock at the estate of Robert Maplethorpe in New York

[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:21.020]
The fudge report is learned

[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:25.920]
Maplethorpe who's infamous self-portrait with a bullwhip inserted in his ainas

[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.280]
As well as many photographs of penises and men engaging in homosexual acts

[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.340]
I'm sure of which Matt has a large collection

[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.420]
Considered Schwarzenegger one of his favorite subject court sources posted late artist tell miss fudge

[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:42.480]
I didn't like that. There's a picture. Well, it's kind of like blurred out. You know, there's a picture of Arnold and naked from the ass end

[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:42.860]
I know

[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:43.880]
Yeah

[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.520]
What an ass oh

[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:51.840]
Speaking of that this will get miss fudge all whipped up to a frenzy since he's listening obviously right now

[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.680]
And by the way you're welcome Matt for a given the story for me immediately about the California the courts and I yes

[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.840]
I know that's where he got it

[00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.780]
Because we had to before he did

[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.320]
Students cut off penis and tongue after drinking hallucinogenic tea you ready for that? No

[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:11.720]
A student cut off his own penis and his tongue after drinking an infusion of the latest drugs crazed to sweep Germany

[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:20.260]
The 18 year old named only his Andreas W. From Halley in Germany drank a tea made with the hallucinogenic angels trumpet plants

[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:26.900]
I guess he ain't got no trumpet no mo no his mother said and Andreas was behaving normally the whole day until he left the house and

[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.560]
Disappeared in the garden for a couple of minutes when he returned to the house

[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.120]
He was wearing a towel wrapped around him who was bleeding heavily from his mouth and between his legs

[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:42.360]
And she said you call that a penis the emergency doctor who arrived a few minutes later said the students cut off his penis and his tongue with a

[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.700]
Garden sheers and it was impossible to reattach the organs if they were gonna reattach him

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.040]
I sure hope they put him in the right place

[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.800]
There's a look for it. Can you imagine that?

[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:56.960]
I'm not gonna get now put rubbing your tongue Andreas could get a job in the movies with that

[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:02.740]
Dr. Andreas Menero's who's all I guess they're all named Andreas there in that town from the local psychiatric hospital

[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.380]
The student was admitted to said Andreas will have to receive

[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.020]
Psychological help for years tea from angels trumpets is extremely dangerous as the drug cannot be dosed

[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:17.960]
Hey, I don't know what that means. I am angels trumpets known for their fragrant and trumpet shaped flowers have increasingly become popular

[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.060]
There's an alternative drug in Germany

[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.000]
How do you like that? I suppose crazy kids

[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.120]
But I was crazy Germans cut off their penises and their tongues

[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 18 teeth

[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.300]
We'll build that other pool there with the sports casters for them sure they're gonna be like a whole bunch

[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.820]
200 names on there in the meantime 91 votes on a presidential pool

[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:43.960]
We're having a election right now this moment Ted Kennedy's got 50 votes out of 91 George W. Bush 22

[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.780]
I wouldn't vote 19 and the fact that George W. Bush has got 22 votes

[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:48.980]
is enough to make me

[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.700]
Earl, but that's a way it goes. That's why we take the polls

[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.180]
26 after 10 at 5 60 W.Q.M

[00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:01.200]
We got the mad dog at two the Humphors on four to six thirty and other tough two and a half hour show for Hank this afternoon

[00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:07.160]

[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.100]
They can ban you they can come with them and a whisker of clinching that wild card with the wind tonight

[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.060]
705 if they don't have more than 25,000 people tonight

[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:20.040]
We're gonna make Scott Jr. into a human sacrifice right on the show tomorrow. Don't you think that's a good idea?

[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:27.480]
Bernal live or yeah, it's a good time for him to show up any camp to the baseball game Joe and Mark overnight two to five at an

[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.420]
AM before the moment you know

0

[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.220]
It is cold it is so freaking cold

[00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:20.940]
And I cringe every time the wind blows

[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.780]
In my pants

[00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:27.880]
Something is shrinking

[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.940]
I'm so cold I can't lip-sync

[00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:40.260]
Let's be cos it's zero baby

[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.260]
And I cannot feel my toes

[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.480]
There's a tingling in my fingers

[00:25:55.120 --> 00:26:00.120]
And my pride that parts are close

[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.020]
Oh

[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:09.520]
My nose is about to fall off

[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:18.720]
There's a cloud every time that I call and my hands are blue

[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.140]
They are turning on

[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.680]
They might have you date my thumbs

[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:31.420]
All right

[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.560]
That's because it's still a baby

[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.380]
I can barely move my mouth

[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.300]
I'm a red hot like in love

[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:54.360]
But first I need to be thought out

[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.000]
Oh

[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.800]
Yes, I need to be thought out

[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:04.860]
That's because

[00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:05.900]
Brack them

[00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.820]
1033 I say for you at 560 WQM

[00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:16.020]
We got 123 votes if the election for president were being held today right this minute. Oh, there's rum spelled the way

[00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.440]
I would respond to your question Senator bird is this

[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:24.100]
123 votes 10 Kennedy 66 I wouldn't vote 29 George W Bush 28

[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.440]
So Teddy's got 53 and the ball 0.6 percent and George W's got 22.7 and we got like 20

[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.340]
As someone would lay out it just lay it out

[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:40.340]
Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time can be a play-by-play guy can be a color guy can be like a not colored guy

[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:48.680]
Like I did a sports show unlike radio like the Humper for example. I just use them as an example

[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:50.220]
right right

[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:58.840]
560 560 Crown 560 only AT&T line here's Westchester. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. What's up, dude? How you doing?

[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:05.260]
I have a couple of Godfather comments and then I got an awesome movie for you. I've never heard anybody tell you about that's it's the best

[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:06.260]
Mama

[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:08.860]
Mama me yeah, yeah

[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:15.680]
The best part in the for me the best part in the Godfather is when Michael shows up at the hospital to see his dad

[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:20.760]
Mm-hmm and he finds that all the guards have been sent away and then he has a baker stand with him next to him

[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.560]
Yeah, you know what you know don't forget when he goes in he hears the record is stuck the

[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.180]
Christmas music that happened to him and got father too by the way

[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:34.500]
But anyway, but the things he likes to cigarette and he realizes that his hands are shaking and that he's actually cut out for that line of work

[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.560]
So I think that's like for me that's the best part

[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.780]
The other guy he realized it was cut off for that line of work

[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.780]
That's that's kind of the way I see it like he sees that his hands aren't shaking

[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.380]
He's like hey, you know, maybe I could be a gangster Bobby damn

[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.820]
My question about the Godfather in part three until now. I thought it was to tag it about Barzini all along

[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:56.800]
Tag is a pin taggeria whatever in part three is

[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:01.420]
Michael's son syncs to him a song. He like does a little solo there on the guitar, right? Uh-huh

[00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.240]
I forget anything with a song. I've heard a couple different ways. What I can

[00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:13.780]

[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:40.280]
From the movie as anyone ever heard the recording that's actually in the movie

[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.540]
Because that's like a different kind of a version from that. Yeah, well you just played you know, I'll put greeno

[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:49.020]
I have an aversion to that version. He'll put greeno is the godfather

[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:57.440]
Anyway, there's a movie it's a Cuban film. It's called Fnessa Higolati, which means strawberry and chocolate

[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:00.360]
And it's about a Maricona Cuba

[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:04.520]
Who hooks up with like this guy who's real uh cat pro Castro

[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:09.240]
And he starts to like seduce him and at the same time he kind corrupt him

[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.060]
He starts giving him a little bit of Western influence like I think he gives him

[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:18.460]
Shimmist rego and he gives him some other stuff and it's a great film because it's like you know that you have the parallel of the guys

[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:24.660]
And at the same time he's corrupting him. It's a really good film if you can see that one you're gonna love it

[00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.940]
Well, what's the name of it? Fnessa Higolati

[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.580]
Oh strawberry and chocolate it's in Spanish so you gotta read the subtitle. No problem

[00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:36.900]
If you could check that one out you're gonna love that film. I highly recommend it if you want to see it tell them to give you a call

[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.660]
Watch out for them opera singers man. No, so come and I'll sing by the

[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:40.620]
Okay

[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.660]
He said kuchi kuchi

[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:01.660]
Oh

Where did you say

[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:14.120]
We say fart on your piano. Is that what he said? Oh man, but Rocky was all the time with listerine man

[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.960]
The music see how do we get started on the godfather again on an old man?

[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.940]
All roads lead to the godfather. I'll be damn man the music is so schmaltzy

[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:30.780]
It's just everything about it the music the acting the characters the old photography the old you leave

[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:35.700]
Keep buying for your father and it was a canole man such canole

[00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:39.060]

I'm sure we can get one. How seriously if it was realistic, I'll I say

[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.320]

Yeah, some of Denise's great drop-ins, but just pull the string

[00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.080]
Here's a west Palm Beach hello

[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.900]
Hello Neil. Yes, sir

[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.600]
Yeah, I'm one for the pole

[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:15.080]
and

[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:18.780]
giant announced that Jim Gordon

[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:25.940]
Jim Gordon was great not well known outside of New York, but Jim Gordon was sensational and he also did a great job on boxing too

[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:31.100]
Yeah, it was a great boxing guy. Yeah, I just wanted to add him and then also Lindsay Nelson for baseball

[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.700]
You like Lindsay Nelson? He had those neat sports jackets. Yeah, he had a plug it in every night to recharge it

[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.860]
Yeah, okay, thanks pal. All right, thanks a lot Lindsay Nelson. I didn't like him. He was but I mean he was

[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:46.560]
He knows we better put on our Kurt Gowdy because people have hoped for him

[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.520]
But Lindsay Nelson was he was just there a long time kind of like Bob Murphy in the mess if they lie and dry you

[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.040]
You know really affected southern cornpone lie and drive

[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.600]
I guarantee it was his name Dave Van Boring will be honest list

[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.960]
You better not call in and vote for Dave Van Boring you clowns because I won't put him on there

[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.320]
I mean it's exciting as the Marlon season has been and all this tremendous

[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:10.060]
And how do we must have manufactured those promos the one thing we just played for about five minutes there at the end of the break

[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.100]
Oh, I'm about a half an hour

[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:17.120]
We must have manufactured that because he never got that excited even when he had an orgasm with his hot wife

[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.180]
He never got as excited as on a promo. I just want to let you run the other hand boosters should be doing a whole game

[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:25.680]
You're at a Dave Van Boring set it back to Montreal the routine. It's gonna be extinct. How come we don't have boog on here

[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.180]
He was on there

[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.440]
There were some boosters calls you better. It's not no talking about on this pole

[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:33.280]
Oh boob charme

[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:36.400]
Your favorite sportscaster of all time

[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:40.940]
Okay, put him on there. You know how you spell his last name's SCI MBI

[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:46.420]
Yeah, I know how to spell boob charme and sunny harsh and hairy carry every other name that gets mentioned on this pole today

[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.860]
This is gonna be difficult. Jim Gordon. I got Jim Gordon Lindsay Nelson Kurt Gowdy Kurt Gowdy GODW

[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:54.800]
GODW

[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.980]
Should be able to handle that about GODWDY

[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:03.380]
What did I say GODWY GOD

[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:05.160]
Oh god

[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:06.680]
D.A.M.N

[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.560]
1041 at 560 by the time just I'm all whipped up from a forerald today

[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:15.220]
He got me inspired after I saw that crappy crowd at least see he won't lie about it

[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.400]
He won't cover up like some of the other people and I'll even say that for Moe

[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.700]
Okay, I can't say much for him, but I'll say this for Moe

[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.980]
Beside the OJ comment what he was right about and also about the attendance man

[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.960]
It's Bush League would be a compliment

[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.900]
And when any K goes under well, we don't care about the crowd you know that's well

[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.040]
Well, how the crap is that?

[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.120]
No, then that's a cop out that's trying to cover up for the fact it's a Bush League town

[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.320]
And that time won't support anything and it's a bunch of front-running phonies, okay?

[00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:42.120]
And all this crap about building a stadium and all that for what?

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:47.680]

Scoot over buddy Blanton on the game of the week by the way many many years ago about a hundred years ago

And you know who else we left off here, which is really a grotesque oversight in our part

[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:36.960]
And we don't mean no offense by it even if he'll take it personally. I know we got to put him on it right now

[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.420]
Mojaro david right right?

[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:45.080]
Okay, you don't think if we're putting boo shambian there were sure as hell put in it

[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:47.620]
It's not a knock on booze, but he's only been doing it for about five minutes

[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:51.740]
Mojaro david's been around for a long time no writing it. I thought you were gonna save Bill's infer

[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:55.580]
Okay

[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.340]
Mojaro david's been around for a long time no writing it. I thought you were gonna save Bill's infer

[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:04.420]
I mean, I like Bill and he was good, but I mean your favorite sportscaster of all time

[00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:06.440]
Is Bill's infer

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:12.980]
See even he finds it humorous. He's laughing at it. He was good. He was good to the solid job. You know, no BS

[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:15.940]
No one he arrives his comments during the game

[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.700]
Here's sunrise hello

[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:23.900]
Sunrise hey Neil yes, sir that's sportscaster George Kell

[00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:31.010]
Yeah, if Rocky could get a hold of one now and storm enormous hit one the Tigers would be right back in it

[00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.410]
I'll tell you what you knew it was summertime when you heard that boy

[00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:37.970]
He was just awful, but I'll put him down for you. I well, you don't know what I put on you hardwell

Okay, let's if we're gonna put George Kell on there is kind of a joke. Let's put on your hardwell

[00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:47.950]
Ernie really okay, but you have come Wesley Clark's not on your poll for president

[00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:51.250]
But we were just doing like one against one right now

[00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.050]
We'll do a poll Wesley Clark against a bush. We'll do that. Maybe we'll do that tomorrow the first hour

[00:41:55.050 --> 00:42:00.930]
Wesley Clark's a man. Okay. What about your restaurant? You never put braised burgers or gloves on there

[00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:05.230]
No, because they don't the wavs don't exist no mo

[00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.910]
Have a great day pals see this guy's you know, he's okay, but he won while he likes George Kell

[00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:16.930]
X-Jock, I mean if Rocky could hit one now

Howell also called the Bobby Thompson or more in the 1951 on the radio, but nobody around TV

[00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:41.710]
I guess I know one that probably everybody's forgotten about but the worst hide just one from the radio is the one everybody else got what?

[00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.630]
I know one that probably everybody's forgotten about and should probably be on the list. Okay, Neil Rogers

[00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:52.770]
No, okay, no that's self-aggrandizing. I'm not a spammy. I did sports night at the WM games, but that that's just assing

[00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:58.530]
No, I said I don't like doing that. I'm not I'm not looking to bend over so everybody can lick my Toshi. Okay, I don't like that

[00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.930]

You can part of the whole here. I don't need that. I don't need that affirmation

[00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:16.850]
I know I'm damn good if that's what I wanted to pursue

[00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:19.350]
I could have been the best play by play guy in a history of the human race

[00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:22.090]
I'm telling you right now. I know what you'd rather made some money though

[00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:28.330]
I'd rather make some money and not compete with a bunch of illiterate jocs like dizzy dean who slutt into third and George Califf only

[00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.290]
Rocky could get a hold of one now. You know, Rocky, Colorado. No, you don't know how about your Scott remembers Rocky

[00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:37.350]
Colorado's name. He don't know Rocky, huh? Sure dude. Go ahead and go ruin his career

[00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:39.090]

[00:43:57.430 --> 00:44:01.550]
23.1% of this audience would vote to reelect George W. Bush

[00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.350]
Shame on you people. What the hell are you thinking about? Are you crazy or what?

[00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.110]
Yeah, if you're rocker, you nuts

[00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:12.270]
Some kind of a county pico lunatic you like massive kistic want to see the world get blown up by a bunch of

[00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:13.850]
Farbiss and a right wing born again christian

[00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:15.590]
That explains it again

[00:44:17.650 --> 00:44:22.470]
567 05 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:27.750]
So many names are gonna be on this list and then we only got to one o'clock because we got it and it's this

[00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:30.790]
Pull this presidential thing will end at 11, okay? I

[00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:35.750]
Well, we got over 200 votes and they're already in just over half an hour. It's pretty impressive if you ask me

[00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:39.090]
So I think it's clear cut and tomorrow just to make this last goof off

[00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.890]
I mean this last guy a happy will do Wesley Clark and George W. So we'll keep track of how Teddy did today

[00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:45.350]
And we'll see how Wesley Clark does tomorrow

[00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:47.010]
general Wesley Clark

[00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:52.070]
Retired with retired general Wesley Clark. We former commentator on CNN

[00:44:52.750 --> 00:44:56.330]
Maven all around the good guy former Supreme Allied commander of NATO forces

[00:44:56.330 --> 00:44:59.770]
What's not happening once upon a time and then he said well, I'll be a Democrat. You know, whatever you want

[00:44:59.770 --> 00:45:03.790]
See, I don't care about that if we anybody that we can get in there to beat Bush or all forum, okay?

[00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:09.950]
I don't care but it's Wesley Clark Clark Kent lowest in Clark Lewis and Clark. Here's Miami. Hello

[00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:12.190]
Yeah, hi Neil. Yes, sir

[00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.530]
Yeah, I wanted to add a couple of names to that. How about a holy cow

[00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:25.410]
And also down goes Frazier my boy Howard Cosell. He was also a great. Well one out of two ain't bad Phil Rezudo

[00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:32.230]
And although you say holy cow he stole that from Harry Care, but that's okay. Phil Rezudo the scooter was awful and Howard Cosell

[00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:39.510]
That's probably the most that's probably the best remembered boxing line from all time down goes Frazier down goes Frazier right

[00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:43.990]
Okay, Neil. Thank you, sir. All the less Carter was a better boxing out through Howard Cosell

[00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:50.010]
We could put him on there, but nobody remember who that is Hank members less Carter I guarantee you that and I've actually more remembers that

[00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:56.650]
Let's see. Oh, here you go. This is a good facts excellent van Miller who's retiring after the season the 800-year

[00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.650]
Voice that he buffalo bills. That's a good one. He's great

[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:04.590]
Here's one that says how about the legendary van Miller who by the way is retiring after the season

[00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.150]
And he's on air put him on the right. How'd you get him on your van Miller? Got him great broadcaster outstanding

[00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:11.970]
I was at the Marlins game last night. It'll be my last one ever

[00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:15.570]
They had only one concession stand open so the line wrapped around like a ride at Universal

[00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:20.290]
I waited for 45 minutes online to get a hot dog in a beer which both were marginal at best

A bad new one fox from the producers of the OC comes a new drama that you'll become obsessive compulsive about

[00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:28.630]

You have such big strong hands do you know what I want you to do with those hands?

Wasp them five times in a row with water that's exactly 111 degrees Fahrenheit and a counterclockwise circular motion

[00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:00.790]
Yes, yes, yes, so grab a nice cold beverage sit back and enjoy the OCD

[00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.210]
But first make sure your cat isn't stuck in the refrigerator

[00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.750]
Oh, I wonder if the catch is sneak in again better check it again

[00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:13.970]
And again and again and again and again and again and again and again

[00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.930]
And again and again don't miss an OCD

[00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:23.170]
Only on box and catch a special encore presentation next week and it's been edited down to three minutes for those with ATT

[00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:29.710]
It's 11.01 at 560 WQ and I love that. That's great. So here's the final toll

[00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:34.270]
From our first poll today and what tomorrow will do Wesley Clarkon in first hour against George W

[00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:38.650]
In fact, maybe for now like the next few days will do a different democratic against WH day here

[00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:41.710]
And just to see how our audiences are doing all right use some real

[00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.970]
Witters too like Joe Lieberman like Carol Mosley Brown. Yeah

[00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:49.450]
Or Julie Burman sure any of them. Yeah, I'd love to do that one

[00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:55.170]
Let's see K. Wood Ledford spelled very badly here K. Wood Ledford was the long time voice of the Kentucky Wildcats

[00:49:55.170 --> 00:49:59.810]
He also was a race announcer. I do believe in Kentucky wasn't he?

[00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:04.210]
I think he called a Kentucky Derby at one time on a radio. So how do you spell it?

[00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:05.290]
Um

[00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:09.010]
Because I really wanted that way. I guess you can spell it that way. I guess maybe that's right

[00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:11.570]
I don't know. I never saw his name in writing K. Wood Ledford

[00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:17.310]
I'm surprised anybody who knew who that was. I remember as a kid here in those Kentucky Wildcats games on here the Kentucky Wildcats

[00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:23.230]
What the Wildcats that's what you used to say he was good a very stintorian voice. Thanks Rick and Kee Lago

[00:50:23.230 --> 00:50:26.310]
Thank you a name from the past K. Wood Ledford

[00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:33.330]
Anyway, 251 votes on a presidential pool if the election was right now and you had Ted Kennedy against George W

[00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:33.710]
Bush

[00:50:34.570 --> 00:50:37.970]
Teddy gets 134 votes. That's 53.2 percent

[00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:41.170]
About 53.3 percent like I said

[00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:45.210]
Wouldn't vote 59 23 and a half percent

[00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.230]
And George W gets

[00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:53.290]
What's he got 60 votes, which is 23.2 percent

[00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:58.530]
Just think he's changing. I mean don't you hit when it happens hey 250. I guess I better print out the last one there

[00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:00.090]
One mother plays

[00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:10.670]
Okay, 258. So let me say it again Kennedy 135 wouldn't vote 63 and W get 60 or 23.2 percent of our liberal county pinko audience, okay

[00:51:11.610 --> 00:51:14.950]
Which we're very proud of by the way. New people would vote for Bush shame on you

[00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:18.290]
We're gonna make sure next year in election day where we're gonna make sure you can vote this time

[00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:22.210]
Last time you made sure the dark post couldn't vote. We're gonna make sure you're not allowed to vote this time

[00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:28.070]
Oh, you're one of the Bush people back home now. Can you imagine if it turned out to be Dick Kemphart against George Bush?

[00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.790]
Hmm you can have like tube gigantic two bumper stickers

[00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:39.430]
Let's lick dick in 2004 or let's like Bush in 2004 right and the surprise out of Republicans is the only votes of counter in San Francisco

[00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.390]
Where's the other way around? I'm sir

[00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:43.530]
Well

[00:51:44.490 --> 00:51:48.510]
Oh look at this 800 pages just came up here. I just printed that thing out. I hate when it happens

[00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.230]
It's way it goes

[00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:54.350]
250.8 that's the final total now we get to the important poll to mean more the day

[00:51:54.350 --> 00:51:57.010]
Let me let me just stick that over there my uh things to do column

[00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:58.270]
Because they my pile

[00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:02.110]
The main one today. Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time

[00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:04.670]
Here's the list we have so far Rick Weaver

[00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:08.970]
The great Rick Weaver boy sure mess him, you know all right

[00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:12.170]
It sounded to me like you were starting like uh sucker-wilded more a little bit

[00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.710]
I think you're starting to like change your tune. Yeah, we're gonna go to lunch. We're gonna golf together

[00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:20.530]
It sounded like that to me this morning and I'm starting to rethink my position on the whole thing, you know

[00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.190]
You believe me? No, oh

[00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:27.050]
The fans beginning to blow the blow the uh

[00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.670]
Who the white selections I miss Rick Weaver. I loved Rick Weaver

[00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:35.110]
He was a he was just something about that voice about the whole thing about the way he smelled which wasn't too good

[00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:42.710]
Rick Weaver male Allen the great male Allen red barber highly overrated by the way Jim managed the great Jim Mad Dogman

[00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:47.090]
It was right best your favorite sportscaster not necessarily play by play could be the color guy

[00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:49.830]
Uh Hank Goldberg could be a talk show guy like Hank

[00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:56.450]
I hate sports that'll be on here because we have a lot of you people out there that resent sports that despise it to probably a bunch of pansies

[00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:01.790]
Joe Bowen the great force to the Toronto Maple Leafs Bill Hewitt the former great boy Fred Qsick

[00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:08.430]
Under Boston Bruins Bob Prince who has my for my money the greatest. Who am I gonna vote for? I don't even know. I don't even know

[00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:13.670]
Huh that well what the hell you're you don't know you're gonna vote what you already said you're gonna vote for a Hank

[00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:16.850]
Hey probably or boo. Oh, I already like Hank. I appreciate that very much

[00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:21.390]
But you're doing that me you know even listen to a show see that's the point it's interesting

[00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:25.970]
I have that work because you know him and so there you suck in his ass a little bit, you know, right?

[00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:30.290]
15 seconds and step it's that pack into the leaves

[00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.830]
And go to the fire wing

[00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.770]
Hey, oh man, oh man is

[00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:46.410]

[00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:47.230]
All right, oh

[00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:53.450]
See when you're a Toronto Maple Leaf fan just like it being a dolphin fan you have to live in the distant past

[00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:57.830]
Because that's what all the good stuff happened 100 years ago. That's a great bill Hewitt

[00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:03.970]
Uh Bob Prince Vince Scully highly overrated very boring foster Hewitt Sonny Hirsch Harry Kiri

[00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:07.630]
Oh too bad. I don't have that foster he would think Henderson. Oh, he just was awful

[00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:12.890]
Harry Kiri Jim Gordon Lindsay Nelson Kirk Gowdy who've shambied the booster who's really moving up in the world

[00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.550]
Which again, I should probably play just a little bit of

[00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:20.010]
Yeah, a little bit of huh? Well, no, we do like Boogalai. I do

[00:54:20.650 --> 00:54:26.350]
And look at that. I just knocked it down on the other line. I got well. I got a little carried away there. You know it's very carried away. Yeah

[00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:28.410]
So excited

[00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:34.210]
Like

[00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:44.450]
Busy Dean with all apologies to anybody who's a literate and articulate and can the sculler name

[00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:49.850]
Moe Howard David it. He'll get some votes. I want to give absolutely. I want to give you a kiss

[00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:57.150]
Girls in for George Kale Ernie Harwell till Resuda the Scoota Oli cow. He didn't say with an age. He sent Oli cow

Yeah fan Miller and K. Wood Ledford the great the Kentucky guy

[00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:12.690]
I'm sure he called a Kentucky Derby once upon a time somewhere somehow some old fart will tell us

[00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:18.450]
See we got to get the old fart because the younger people are all out of town anyway. They got out they left

[00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:21.390]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello

Well, when I wait wait wait wait wait wait wait see sir let me say it again because if I allow you to do this

[00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:07.370]
I am asking who is your favorite sportscaster? Well, then not who are your two favorites? Not who are your ten favorites?

[00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:10.330]
Okay, I just have one for two different sports. That's why

[00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:13.350]
Well for hockey it's Dan Kelly

[00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:18.390]
Dan Kelly was great and by the way his son John Kelly with a color by the airline

[00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:19.670]
He's got

[00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.030]
Ray Scott from the Green Bay Packer Packers

[00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:27.930]
And if you want to have a little joke on

[00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:31.750]
Joe the gassy family Cain fans you have listened until your show

[00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.530]
Ray Scott had a little bit of an embibing problem, but he was great

[00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:39.310]
Guy's terrific right Scott remember those wonderful days when each team had their own announcer

[00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:44.590]
Chris Shankle used to do the giant scams and King Coleman did the Browns and Ray Scott was the Vikings. I mean the packers

[00:56:45.450 --> 00:56:47.050]
Chris Shankle very much

[00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.290]
The others on I'm not sure from anywhere

[00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:55.270]
Okay, if you put the guy here you'll get a feel for how many you want. I'll put him on there just as the joke vote okay

[00:56:56.050 --> 00:57:00.390]
Thanks, paly how the great thing you know you too. Joe's a gassy man. He's the best

[00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:01.930]
Okay

[00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:06.870]
Let's see here's one it says uh oh, I know that's not right

[00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:09.070]
That's not the correct spelling

[00:57:10.110 --> 00:57:15.930]
Without without a why I think it was uh you can't spell k would without a why right

[00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:17.590]
You wouldn't think so

[00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:20.470]
That's like Eddie Haywood without a why

[00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:25.070]
Remember Eddie Haywood on decker records soft summer breeze. No, I bet your vocal Brian does

[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:29.490]
See this is one of the great things about being an old fart you have all of this unbelievable information

[00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:33.670]
It's all useless. It's all embarrassing because it makes you seem real old and I am and I'm proud of it

[00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:34.050]
I'm pleased

[00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:44.650]
56705 60 pound five 60 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line rather be an old grizzled fart then lay on punk like Scott who thinks that the cubs are gonna win a god damn pennant

[00:57:46.610 --> 00:57:50.030]
Let's see who's your favorite oh, that's right. He's a Pirates fan. Well, I don't know about that

[00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:57.210]
You're a Steelers fan which I don't understand but you are you a Pirates fan? No good good good thinking front runner New York Yankees

[00:57:58.030 --> 00:58:01.690]
Oh Jesus Christ like I said what's wrong with a Pirates he's been a joeyty

[00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:05.870]
Who the hell is oh Lanny Frateri has been doing a Pirates a long time. He's awful

[00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:08.330]
He's it not awful, but he's his very very weak

[00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:14.850]
You know and on the heels of the great Bob Prince and Jim Woodstave a guy like Lanny Frateri and Rosie Rosewell a hundred years ago before you were born

[00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:16.970]
Open the window at many here it comes

[00:58:18.370 --> 00:58:22.590]
Anyway, who's your favorite sportscaster of all time. I don't know. I'm gonna vote for

[00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:27.090]
Yeah, huh I voted

[00:58:28.530 --> 00:58:33.870]
For Hank we already know I voted for boob just to be different all right. I like that. Well boob's a great guy

[00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.970]
We love boob. I like the people. He's a great talent. He's one of the good

[00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.310]
He sucks on the talk shows, but he's great and played by play lost all that weight

[00:58:40.310 --> 00:58:44.550]
He's got a lot of weight. He looks like a human being. He's not some kind of a fag

[00:58:45.110 --> 00:58:51.330]
Jim manages got four and Howard co-star. You ever see him together? Oh, I tell you I think Jim manages to be a carnation of Howard co-star

[00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:55.670]
Down goes fresh. Yeah, down goes mode down goes mode

[00:58:58.270 --> 00:59:03.210]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound five. I voted for Bill Hewitt just because nobody else is going to

[00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:09.150]
And as a young lad growing up became a hockey fan. Thanks to listen to the bill he would on CBL Toronto

[00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:11.150]
On the face off. Lany McDonnell

[00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:19.070]
Lany McDonnell with that big handlebar mustache remember Lany don't you George? Oh, yeah

[00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:20.430]
5 6 7

[00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:28.230]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:32.790]
Why sure wish they were hearing me doing a show in Toronto today because these people least know something about the hockey announcers

[00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:37.950]
And something about sports and about life just besides blowing up the whole rest of the goddamn world like you're in 70 voice

[00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:43.150]
Yeah, that's all the americanos about now is violence and killing people just ask Michael Moore. He'll tell you

[00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:44.910]
Leafs one last night

[00:59:45.450 --> 00:59:50.410]
Yeah, at least one in Montreal two to one of meaningless exhibition game a couple of the kids from the AHL scored the two goals

[00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:52.350]
By the way, just in case you're keeping track Scott

[00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:54.770]
Scott's keeping track of the exhibition hockey games

[00:59:54.770 --> 01:00:00.170]
Wish you were very proud of that because once hockey season starts are we gonna be a hockey intensive on his show show or what huh?

[01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:03.290]
I think George is gonna be doing like a whole bunch of hockey shows with the rumor

[01:00:03.290 --> 01:00:03.950]
That's right

[01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:13.030]
Yes, feel anything there's Leafs TV. They got some hot babe on there just to run around naked in the ice and there is the racing from Georgian Downs

[01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:14.910]
I'm sure that all you people want to hear this stuff, don't you?

[01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:17.210]
Oh, yeah, put it up

[01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.930]
No

[01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:22.910]
Uh, oh look at this marv Albert as the best sportscaster and crossdresser

[01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:28.810]
Marv Albert and he's not a crossdresser. He just likes to address up a little bit. Marv Albert's good. Hello. Uh, you know who hates him?

[01:00:29.590 --> 01:00:30.770]
I give up absolutely

[01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:31.250]
No

[01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:36.750]
Because Marv Albert's not doing money and I football on a video. Oh, so I guess maybe a little joke

[01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:39.390]
Also as a joke then a smiller now we're not gonna do that

[01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:42.290]
Much of a joke Joseph Yankees enough of a joke

[01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:47.910]
Joseph Yankees sucks, okay? Okay. Here's a listener George says before I moved to Florida start listening to Neil God

[01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.850]
I used to spend my time listening to Ned Martin and Jim Woods calling the red socks him Jim Wood

[01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.970]
I'm gonna put Jim Woods on there George. Okay

[01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:59.590]
He was never the top announcer, but he was with the Yankees the Pirates at a Red Sox and he was excellent

[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.930]
I love Jim Woods. Oh brother was he good

[01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:07.230]
Jim Woods and Bob Prince doing a pirate games and Jim Woods mel Alan Red Barbarani Yankees

[01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:11.930]
Those were the days when we didn't have all these illiterate jocks on there taking all the job when we had like real broadcasters

[01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:12.650]
It was great

[01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.890]
Even George wishes he'd have been born and he might even become a sports fan

[01:01:17.430 --> 01:01:21.090]
Yeah, but I doubt it. Well, he'd rather play it and then look at it

[01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:26.810]
It depends on who it is. It was Brittany and uh Christine Aguilar you might look at it and play it

[01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.850]
Play with it 1114 at 560 WQM

[01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:34.510]

[01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:38.270]
Here's the answer dry concepts. They've been doing in my house even when I had the two dogs

[01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:42.270]

[01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:46.250]

Even introduced to something called the RIA

[01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:04.550]
Break it down. I knew one side day it would all come down only

[01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:09.690]
On those empty streets that I got off the whip of breathe

[01:03:09.690 --> 01:03:14.290]
So I'm saying goodbye to those songs I've promised

[01:03:14.830 --> 01:03:17.170]
So they said free songs I'm allowed

[01:03:17.170 --> 01:03:20.110]
So I'm playing for them. I'm a listen

[01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:24.050]
Senior region RIA too

[01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.970]
Lost suit now the fun is over

[01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:30.330]
And now we are soon no more free soul

[01:03:30.330 --> 01:03:34.050]
Sharing our music until any harm

[01:03:34.050 --> 01:03:36.690]
Get in her no one now living music

[01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:40.930]
Love her all complains and there up in arms

[01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.110]

[01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:43.430]
I'm

[01:03:48.010 --> 01:03:54.570]
Holy Machina this is Joe Bourne the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God

[01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:58.150]
Okay, I should have voted for Joe Bourne but I yeah, I just couldn't do it. He's the best in the history

[01:03:58.150 --> 01:04:03.930]
Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time and you know I screwed up on listener Georgia's facts because I was so excited about Jim Woods

[01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:05.770]
And I didn't read the rest of it for his real vote

[01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:08.790]
Did you see it? No, oh

[01:04:08.790 --> 01:04:16.530]
So this I can only vote for one I choose Johnny most the precursor to Wolfman jack and Scott for real Johnny most have the text on the ball

[01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:22.790]
Even us Scott there remembers Johnny most don't you sure do great voice of the Celtics the greatest the

[01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:25.830]
Celtic announcer I should mention with all due respect to absolutely

[01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:30.130]
Oh Howard David it who couldn't carry his dog strand. Hey since I'm a stealer fan can I add one?

[01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:33.170]
Oh wait a minute um

Huh come on you know it is

[01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:41.470]
Oh, who knows that no don't tell me the guy that they didn't do the play by play he used to do like the cornball stuff

[01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:45.590]
Don't tell me don't tell me I remember Bill Curry was the weatherman a KDK would have o-tie

[01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:50.130]
Uh-huh and this guy used to do the sports on KDK and he was like the oh

[01:04:50.130 --> 01:04:53.130]
Geez no no give me time give me time. They'll take me time

[01:04:54.050 --> 01:05:00.390]
He was very very famous in Pittsburgh probably only Bob Prince was more famous than this guy. What the hell would give me what was his first name?

[01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.670]
Give me give me the initials MC

[01:05:06.450 --> 01:05:08.490]
MC M is a Mary C is in Charlie

[01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:10.010]
MC

[01:05:12.850 --> 01:05:16.670]
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh I think my this is the first sign in my mind going George. I'm slipping

[01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:21.830]
Uh, oh wait a minute. I just had it on the tip of my uh left ear your your lobe

[01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:26.070]
Uh, okay. Give me get uh we'll come back to it, okay?

[01:05:26.370 --> 01:05:30.210]
Little ring of power. I'm serious. All right. All right. What?

[01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:35.970]
I said all right. Frank Gohares. He was a really nice guy. Yeah, he's kind of like a Howard Cosella's kind of guy

[01:05:35.970 --> 01:05:39.650]
He was real a cross-dick and did the sports on TV in Pittsburgh on KDK a

[01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:45.030]
Uh-uh little counter still does but it's funny. I remember uh Bill Curry used to do the weather with a big bow ties

[01:05:45.790 --> 01:05:51.370]
Five six and did you live in Pittsburgh? Uh, no. I spend a couple winters out there. Oh how sad

[01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:56.490]
Did you ever eat at the mountain view in in your Pittsburgh? Yes. That was a good place. Still is

[01:05:56.910 --> 01:06:00.130]
That's a great place to mountain view in god. It's so great to know

[01:06:00.390 --> 01:06:03.250]
It's uh, it's so great to know a bunch of crap that nobody else knows

[01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:09.930]
Five say earth here's about here's an inside show is it for Lauderdale? Yeah. Hey, how you doing? No pretty good?

[01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:11.590]
Uh, Marty Glickman

Marty Glum- uh more you know what to deal for it right? You got to say it right. Morty Glickman Morty

[01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:19.330]
He was great. He was

[01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:26.330]
And I couldn't get in for the nerd show, but you guys missed the ultimate nerd Arnold Stang. Oh that was good

[01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:27.550]
He was excellent. Yeah, right?

[01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:32.230]
I got chocolate if you look up nerd in the dictionary Arnold's picture is there

[01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.290]
It's either Arnold Stanger or Alice Schwarzenegger

[01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:36.870]
Thanks, okay. We have to get in Morty Glickman

[01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:40.290]
You know that I met Marty Glickman once since speaking in a name droppers. I'm sure he's dead by now

[01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.470]
I met Marty Glickman in Ithaca, New York

[01:06:43.210 --> 01:06:46.570]
Yeah, it's gonna go to work at some radio station in Ithaca, New York a hundred years ago

[01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.730]
And I just changed. I don't know what it was. I was going through a confusing period of my life

[01:06:51.390 --> 01:06:52.650]
Like the first 80 years

[01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.290]
Marty Glickman New York Giants football

[01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:57.930]
Let's see. Let's come back to it. Myron Cope

[01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:03.470]
It's just running. He's on the phone or he'd be applauding you

[01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:07.250]
He'd be applying. It's just kidding. I told you it would come back to me because I haven't heard his name in a

[01:07:07.250 --> 01:07:13.350]
Akunz age Myron Cope. That's the Pittsburgh. I get him on the list by the way. See OPE. Okay. Myron is in Myron Cone

[01:07:14.310 --> 01:07:16.570]
How do you like that Scott sooner or later? I knew it

[01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.710]
I'm sorry what Myron Cope that's him it just came back say

[01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:25.650]
5 6 7 0 and I realized a lot of these are first grizzled first

[01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.910]
But you know the interesting part of this is just like everything else the good stuff

[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:33.690]
I know this sounds awful, but the good stuff was a while ago

[01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:36.650]
You know now that you got all these little rich jocks doing the ball games

[01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:41.450]
I mean how many great sports cashews do you have today really when you come right down to it with the exception of all our

[01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:45.450]
Colleagues on WQM sports obsessive nerds sick radio how many of you got

[01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:46.890]
Huh?

[01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:53.030]
Third man again a whole country and a lot of those guys are guys that have been around for a hundred years like Vince Scully still around

[01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:56.670]
He's still doing those games even though he's highly overrated. God is he boring

[01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:05.070]
I know hit here a perfect game for a sandy co-fit. Oh my god. How could we forget and you really slipped up there mr

[01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:08.250]
Mr. Hockey fan my close personal friend Mike Lang

[01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:10.070]
From the Pittsburgh Penguin

[01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:20.350]
The

[01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:24.150]
Chroma time he gives up the lead for the three

[01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:27.410]
Info pray doesn't know whether to cry or want to watch

[01:08:28.690 --> 01:08:33.350]
Oh, what a guy Mike Lang how could I leave Mike off the list? Don't he be really pissed? I don't know all time

[01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:37.870]
No seriously. I mean from Pittsburgh in this guy you're sitting there with this got the make-believe Scott

[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:42.870]
He's supposed to be a Pittsburgh guy. You don't mention Mike Lang in supposed to be a hockey maven I was answering the phones

[01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:48.830]
Oh my god, and we left off the facts are coming in now billin for Lauderdale says chick her

[01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:53.890]
chick her and I think that most of them interview chick on a year and tomorrow course take died a while back

[01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:57.410]
But few months ago check her and he was there for a long time

[01:08:58.490 --> 01:09:03.370]
100 years on the west coast chick her and you got him we got him we already sent it

[01:09:04.530 --> 01:09:08.770]
Okay, here's a two I mean we ordinarily leave it only one but and you can't well

[01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:13.890]
I mean we have to separate them as individuals, but you know Pat Summaryll and John Madden, okay

[01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:19.650]
And since we're putting these people out and I don't want to get the hump or upset how about his close personal friend Al Michaels, huh?

[01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:21.010]
He ain't no chop liver

[01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:25.450]
I personally think he's overrated especially since he did that interview with Mo

[01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:32.930]
But I think he's a little overrated. He's he's good. He's good. Do you believe in miracles? Huh? No, no that line is also highly overrated

[01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:33.750]

Did you hear that that was in stereo

[01:13:23.210 --> 01:13:28.430]
He wasn't my favorite play he was my favorite Rochester Redwing play by play guy better than Tom Decker by quite a bit

[01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:32.850]
But I call and Joe Colony was pretty weak Joe Colony was weak. I like that

[01:13:32.850 --> 01:13:35.730]
But I used to I love listen to dizzy Dean when I was a kid

[01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:38.170]
Well three ducks down upon and

[01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:41.870]
Dooses are wild two out two on two oh

[01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:46.410]
How that they were when he started with that slud into third man. It's just that was the end for me

[01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:50.750]
When the games got boring he would do his rendition of the wall bash cannonball

[01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:55.590]
Yeah, I remember that and buddy blightner were tried to jump out of the boot three different times or Peewee

[01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:57.310]
He did the games with Peewee Reese or wild you know

[01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:01.290]
But yeah, but that was after buddy blightner got screwed over you do know that story don't you well

[01:14:01.290 --> 01:14:04.430]
Know what's that is that on CBS originally buddy blightner

[01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:08.870]
Who was great he was one of the few x-jots who was a great broadcaster to the same Louis Hawks for years on

[01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:10.910]
KM wax yeah, and anyway

[01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:16.470]
He was the main guy under but they thought that dizzy Dean was getting candid dizzy in his agent pulled some strings behind

[01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:21.250]
The scene and they can buddy blightner they stabbed him in the back and got Peewee Reese another illiterate jok in there

[01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:22.610]
And jeez yeah

[01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:29.430]
Then I use the buddy blightner from the my house and a Rochester on I get the KM wax because you could pick up the signal

[01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:33.490]
I listen to Bob Pettit and Cliff Agan and then I think I was a big Hawks fan in those days

[01:14:33.490 --> 01:14:37.110]
Thanks to buddy blightner see a great play by play announcer can make you a sports fan

[01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:40.990]
Yeah, yeah, absolutely and speaking of great announcers who talk much too loud

[01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:45.570]
There was an interesting piece on a racing network yesterday about Roger Houston the first voice at Pompo no Park

[01:14:45.570 --> 01:14:51.370]
He was the first voice we had to turn down the speakers when he left he was the first voice and the loudest voice

[01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:55.290]
Wow, they were playing some of his calls from the a little brown drug and man

[01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:59.430]
I thought my speakers were gonna pit it was so loud it was brutal. Oh, he's great for the jug

[01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:05.530]
But I don't think I could stand 18 races back to back to back little on the loud side and what a mammoth ego man

[01:15:05.530 --> 01:15:10.570]
I'll tell you it's just scary. You know, he's really a good guy too in person. You see? Yeah, I kind of like you, you know

[01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:11.190]

It's called creepers or maybe no or maybe just our audience is all gone

[01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:46.430]
That could be positive. Maybe that's why nobody wants the best in the LCD

[01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:52.090]
Maybe the audience is all gone. What do you think? They're long gone man. They're busy listening to what's his name? What's his name?

[01:19:10.570 --> 01:19:12.430]
That is I'd like to have a picture of that

[01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:17.050]
Now for flip the Howard's wing by the way Dave Johnson hates Howard Cosswell like Poison City was a real prick

[01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:20.090]
But that's what he said and believe me Dave goes is

[01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:26.910]
Wigs by now you've been hearing about laminets or us and is this the right spot? No, oh you see no you see what the problem is

[01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:32.670]
No, see she know it's a logical law of sky. You see what she did. Yes. I do. She put it as a second

[01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:35.890]
Whoever this draw is who's doing law she may be a very nice lady

[01:19:35.890 --> 01:19:38.870]
But she doesn't know it will say the laminets are us for next spot. Keep that in mind

[01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:42.750]
Keep a subliminal thing in the back of your mind folks about the hardwood flooring and how expensive it is

[01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:43.730]
Okay, what?

[01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:45.430]
Well, no, it's not the right spot

[01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:46.550]
I want to do these in a right order

[01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.450]
But she's sticking like live spots in the middle of bracelet and again

If the terror is warning

So as you drive on into world

[01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:48.510]
Be alert

[01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:57.430]
The White House says we're all doing now can't be sure where they might strike a neck

[01:21:57.430 --> 01:22:01.650]
Yeah, we're nervous Rex because of all of us friends

[01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:08.190]
Rumsville says we better watch out. He is the word I feel it clear

[01:22:08.190 --> 01:22:10.650]
It's a terror is warning

[01:22:11.430 --> 01:22:12.210]
Oh

[01:22:14.830 --> 01:22:17.950]
The government says be prepared

[01:22:18.770 --> 01:22:20.590]
And I'm scared

[01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:25.870]
They say not if but when now

[01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:29.030]
Not specific threats are a joke

[01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:32.390]
Yeah, I think there are hopes they could give me

[01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:37.450]
I think that I just will know again

[01:22:37.450 --> 01:22:39.750]
Live my life enjoy the ride

[01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:40.610]
In my life

[01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.010]
I'm

[01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.830]
Terrorist

[01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.790]
Oh

[01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:49.110]
I'm nervous the way that it started it

[01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:57.190]
We too was 14 to noon at 560 teni and candle has probably the biggest ass sucker I've ever encountered in my life

[01:22:57.190 --> 01:23:01.750]
He's first spent all summer looking your butt, which is fine. You know, he's entitled probably tastes good to him

[01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:06.830]
And now he's looking to boosters bud. I don't I don't know how he's got room. Maybe he's got like a fork tongue

[01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:08.870]
Can you see that?

[01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.870]
Look at both back home at the same time

[01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:16.910]
But anyway, he has the facts here about boog is becoming the greatest sportscaster

[01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:20.250]
He said kudos to the hammer for the fine because I guess the hammer is the one who uh

[01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:24.630]
Uncovered boog in a dumpster somewhere okay back when boog was big in a fat and disgusting

[01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:30.050]
It says just listen to a rain delay spectator and as long as maybe you won't fall asleep the boog's shot

[01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:35.470]
Not a boog's good. He's very good. They ought to get they ought to dump but because they've mismanaged the broadcast on a whole thing

[01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:40.230]
They screwed up a jo angel to make room for davel brine and then like a couple of weeks later davel brine said

[01:23:40.230 --> 01:23:45.110]
Oh, I'm a real star. I'm going to ESPN screw you guys and so jo angel went out to San Francisco and

[01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:48.890]
fell into a bucket of crap and got with a giant so I'd up in a world series and our women

[01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:53.270]
They're division by 100 games this season nice going to angel good guy man. We like to angel

[01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:56.070]
So davel brine who was highly overrated

[01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:59.810]
They made made a way for him that was under the john Henry regime and now they brought in this

[01:23:59.810 --> 01:24:03.030]
Terminally boring guy to use to do the games on the internet month y'all

[01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:08.550]
Dave and boring who's got a really hot wife and a bad hair piece and he's up up in a way as where they ought to send him

[01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:11.350]
With the fifth dimension and merrill and mccuckoo

[01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:13.290]
Cuckoo cook or a chew

[01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:19.530]
At any rate look at that the man see we got some bad spellings on the pull which we apologize for that

[01:24:19.530 --> 01:24:22.170]
But that's because we got two uh guys don't know nothing about sports

[01:24:22.170 --> 01:24:28.930]
Co-cells like that one s Eric only one s and Harry carry i'm pretty damn sure spelled carry ca r a y

[01:24:29.790 --> 01:24:31.650]
That's probably George's fault my fault

[01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:36.550]
Well nobody would know that except the next word like me Jim man. It's his moving in the first place

[01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:36.990]
Right

[01:24:38.790 --> 01:24:42.750]
Mad dog 32 Howard co-cell 29. I hate sports 23

[01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:47.750]
Harry carry 15 and matter how you spell it smell it mel Alan 13

[01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:49.030]
Kirk gaudy nine

[01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:52.310]
I always heard was good. Who was the guy that used to do Paul christman?

[01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:56.210]
Wasn't it with that the color guy in the football games and the old afl and Kirk out into the afl?

[01:24:56.370 --> 01:24:56.850]
I didn't be see

[01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:03.390]
Come on Scott before my time before my husband afl and then there was a ludi regatus

[01:25:03.390 --> 01:25:08.470]
There's no one's name luo aldi regatus aldi regatus. What is i i picture the humpar nose these names

[01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:14.730]
We're gonna have a show one day uh Scott and Hank and I we're gonna sit around and the eddy Kay

[01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:19.090]
And we're gonna end the and mo and we'll sit around and we'll reminisce about for it for it

[01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:23.330]
But you'll have to be over the age of a hundred to listen because all the punks they don't know when any of these people are like Scott

[01:25:23.330 --> 01:25:27.770]
All the all the anybody under 100 knows that know who these people are i'm de grade. Well you missed a good stuff

[01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:32.250]
I can't help it. I'm sorry. No seriously. Hey, it would be better than one of those stupid hockey shows

[01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:34.670]
Oh, oh all right. Yeah

[01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:40.490]
Hockey show and stuff for that's like having a show on god damn kosher food in Siberia

[01:25:40.490 --> 01:25:44.970]
Yeah, but they like it although they do sense some of the juiced Siberia. So that's a bad example i guess

[01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:50.350]
Kirk outie nine vince scully eight moe Howard David had speaking to some of those usable log in Siberia eight

[01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:53.950]
Now actually we're starting to get cozy with moe. I think there's a chance there don't you what

[01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:57.930]
Georgia was saying this morning that they were peeing together

[01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:59.410]
Well, we were washing

[01:25:59.850 --> 01:26:04.130]
They said that they were gonna be in field and stream together. I was actually pooping

[01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:06.310]
Rick weaver seven. He's right on mose-ass

[01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:11.090]
Bob princes god six or any harwell five. This is tough. This is a tough one. There's so many great ones

[01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:12.770]
Most of them from way back

[01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:18.470]
Sunny Hersh for Van Miller for red barber for pet summer all four tick hern three Fred Q6 three

[01:26:19.770 --> 01:26:23.330]
I think I got some for a Q6 in here, but it's not very good. Don't I?

[01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:25.730]
I don't know. It's not a really agree

[01:26:36.690 --> 01:26:43.990]
He's got one for a two to one Bruins. Please. Yeah, that wasn't very good. He was great. Fred Q6 was sensational. He's still alive by the way

[01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:49.610]
Still alive for a Q6 and certainly a lot better than those awful guys that got through in the Bruins games now

[01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:52.790]
Oh my god. The Dale Arnold. He I think he's a pansy. He's awful

[01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:55.770]
And who's the other guy that does it with a heavy oh Nguyen I said

[01:26:57.190 --> 01:26:58.970]
Scott you know nothing Bruins

[01:26:59.550 --> 01:27:01.770]
Yeah, now Rangers. I got John Davidson

[01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:07.910]
Oh John David JD would be good. I guess absolutely. No. All right. I'll put him on her

[01:27:08.690 --> 01:27:13.530]
Put on John Davidson JD JD JD air rumors got his tongue so far of JD's ass man

[01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:15.390]

[01:27:53.470 --> 01:27:55.490]

[01:28:00.150 --> 01:28:01.110]
US team wins

[01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.790]

Bobby Thompson hits on my rush of Hodges goes crazy the giants wind dependent to giants wind dependent even George has heard that

[01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:09.870]

Well, that's his vote

[01:28:19.230 --> 01:28:19.870]
You go

[01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:20.330]
Boog

Jim Woods don't have any and either does my my clang has no votes engine Gordon no vote and Rick Generat no votes George Kelln no votes thank god

Yeah, nobody wants your crappy CDs no more your uh Neil whatever your name is yeah

[01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:43.490]
Let's see. I know you hate basketball and most of South Florida probably hasn't heard his work

[01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:44.810]
But my pick is the legendary

[01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:47.650]
Lake your great chick her knees already on there uh Tucker

[01:28:48.210 --> 01:28:51.290]
Tucker's generally a pretty good fact here, but Tucker is uh mother today

[01:28:52.190 --> 01:28:55.510]
It says an innovator and a uh something talent

[01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:56.950]
True talent

[01:28:56.950 --> 01:29:00.310]
PS used to be a basketball fan, but he today's he might agree with that

[01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:03.770]
I was a big uh sandalous hot fan just strictly because of buddy Blatner

[01:29:04.190 --> 01:29:08.270]
Guy tried to retire two different times in the fans wrote in so many letters and telegrams of protest

[01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:11.730]
The extended his career buddy Blatner was great. He was sensational

[01:29:13.050 --> 01:29:15.010]
You remember that don't you George on KMORX?

[01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.750]
Yeah

[01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:23.610]
Here we go somebody votes for Joe Angel. Let's put them on there Joe who actually acknowledged my existence remember that time

[01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:28.410]
Thanking the broadcast mavens or whatever I said about his getting screwed by the marlins. Oh, yeah

[01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:31.630]
It says for the first few years at marons. I used to love Joe Angel says Kevin

[01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:36.950]
Also enjoyed mark van der mere on a hercun broadcast. We had to put mark van der mere on he's a good guy

[01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:43.190]
Although who was it that turned him against me? Mark van der mere oh was Joe's again. Oh, he's actually wasn't him was his wife remember that

[01:29:43.190 --> 01:29:47.210]
Didn't happen his wife used it didn't happen mark loves you

[01:29:47.890 --> 01:29:52.110]
But I his wife uh they always said it was his wife that would call. How come you pick on Joseph Gackie all the time

[01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:57.630]
Well some broad maybe good Dutch boy mark van der mere man whose family came from Amsterdam great god

[01:29:57.630 --> 01:29:59.250]
Good Dutchman excellent talent

[01:29:59.250 --> 01:30:03.370]
Went on the broadcast the Dallas Tech they they the Houston Texans

[01:30:04.190 --> 01:30:07.830]
Who beat the dog then they beat the dolphins in the first game where I dream that Scott was ever like

[01:30:07.830 --> 01:30:08.070]
Yeah

[01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.970]
hahaha

[01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:14.390]
I thought I just dreamt that a little girl's team beat the dolphins to open a game of the season

[01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:16.390]
Could have been like a nightmare

[01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:22.030]
Wow, and it was in Miami of pp park no less your robby's turning over in his grave and the shoes mice

[01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:25.830]
There must be laughing up his sleeve and even Jimmy's got his Johnson out. He's so excited

[01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:32.190]
See one thing about the s coaches. I really think they want their their their successors to fail don't you sure sure

[01:30:33.170 --> 01:30:37.170]
Because that was the whole thing because Jimmy Johnson set up Shula for getting

[01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:44.470]
Can which he didn't any everybody said you know he made the deal he resigned which he didn't he got can and then Jimmy of course fell flat on his that what

[01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:48.830]
I know that's true. No, it isn't true. Nobody else talks about it except nobody else on this station

[01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:53.090]
We'll talk about it, but Shula got blown out behind the scenes and then of course they made that big thing about oh no

[01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:57.010]
He announced the sp and the night before they called him a camera crew. He was yeah right

[01:30:57.010 --> 01:31:00.150]
Really would be too embarrassing for the shoes mice to get canned

[01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:05.810]
Then they'd have to change the his picture on his footballs in his restaurant. I got to look for something else to do probably

[01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:07.930]
If you work on his meat a little bit tenderize it

[01:31:07.930 --> 01:31:12.370]
But at any rate said and Jimmy Johnson committed fell flat on his ass which I love because I don't know

[01:31:12.370 --> 01:31:17.390]
See and of course the people on the station suck ass so much because they hang around these people and they interview these people in the buddy

[01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:20.770]
Buddy and they suck up. I mean like one step there's a guy just you know oh

[01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:24.110]
He's like one step away from how it smelly burger if you ask me

[01:31:25.930 --> 01:31:32.070]
Here's a call from Pinecress hello. I deal. Yes, sir. I got an answer for you haven't mentioned it. Okay

[01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:38.270]
Chuck Thompson who or Chuck Thompson was great. I know Chuck Thompson. There's an angel one of the men to one more

[01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:41.170]
But he only was out one but I like John Miller too

[01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:45.750]
John Miller's got he belongs on her you're right. You know I'm not a big of a fan

[01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:52.310]
Yeah, I don't know because the famous phrase that beer cold. Yeah, he was great. All right. Thanks a lot, Polly

[01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:56.170]
Yeah, in fact, he's a one at call on was it on TV or on radio? I guess on radio

[01:31:56.770 --> 01:32:01.170]
The Bill Mazorowski homework in 1960 when they pirate speed the Yankees in the semichin to win a world series

[01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:02.910]
George Rimbors that like who's just yesterday? Oh yeah

[01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:08.630]
And the the most famous part about that call whichever chis-cathas and even it was that Chuck Thompson called a wrong picture

[01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:14.510]
He said art did marthros. There's a long fly ball blah blah blah. Mazorowski to him on now

[01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:17.370]
He said back to the wall goes bear right at silver defense one run of pirates win

[01:32:17.370 --> 01:32:21.750]
But see how can I remember that almost like you can remember your name with all that clutter?

[01:32:22.190 --> 01:32:25.450]

It is frightening back to the wall goes bear it's over the fence for a home run of pirates win

[01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:36.090]
But at any rate it wasn't art did mar was Ralph Terry who threw the pitch that the Mazorowski at the winning home run in 1960 world series

[01:32:36.090 --> 01:32:41.350]

She's a loving person and she's given you so much so often

[01:35:03.370 --> 01:35:10.250]
This Valentine's Day why not give her something that says how much you understand what she's given you

[01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:13.950]
Give her the all-new STD bouquet

[01:35:15.350 --> 01:35:19.070]
The STD bouquet is sure to ignite her burning passion

[01:35:20.130 --> 01:35:22.350]
Or at least a burning sensation

[01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:25.190]
The STD bouquet

[01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:31.010]
The one gift she'll have long after this Valentine's Day is over

[01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:36.710]
Now you're probably realize I've played the wrong bit there is this the one that's got the Merlin Olsson

Yeah spread the joy and the germs with an STD pick it up bouquet

[01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:17.570]
STD it's the next best thing to being there

[01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:21.230]
Doing it anyway, the reason I played as somebody fax said what about dick inberg

[01:36:21.230 --> 01:36:25.210]
We couldn't leave dick off his list. He's done everything under the sun from tennis the baseball and football

[01:36:25.210 --> 01:36:29.350]
He's all over the place. You can't get rid of him. I used to like dick more than I do now

[01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:34.150]
I got that what about dick inberg always become a little senile camera board game

[01:36:34.150 --> 01:36:37.890]
He's right and it says he worked with father Murphy i.e. Merlin Olsson, which is why I played the STD

[01:36:37.890 --> 01:36:41.550]
We got so many bits in there that Cali somebody mentioned before but I'm glad we got other faxers

[01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:43.130]
I don't see it on there. I don't see a lot of money

[01:36:43.130 --> 01:36:45.510]
But the Erica get around it whenever you get around it

[01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.710]
I'm up to date

[01:36:48.290 --> 01:36:54.010]
You are? Are you are just taking a shot at Eric there? He's on right it's the lunch time man. I will never this relax relax

[01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:58.810]
Here's the facts from Todd and Hollywood chronic faxers is what I miss about Joangelis's daughter Natalie

[01:36:58.810 --> 01:37:02.650]
Who was so hot she could melt the bumpers off a gold post from a hundred yards away

[01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:05.910]
She used to work for Sunshine Network and it says God on here

[01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:10.290]
It says I remember the voice of the reds during the 60s, but not his name

[01:37:10.290 --> 01:37:12.250]
Marty Brennan is here looking for by the way Todd

[01:37:12.690 --> 01:37:15.130]
My old memory of shots is Todd Marty Brennan

[01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:22.590]
Who son Todd uh Brennan uh not his name Tom Brennan was with the cubs for a while with a Harry and now I think with fax Tom Brennan

[01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:23.670]
You know who that is Scott

[01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:27.110]
No, oh you don't

[01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:32.310]
Should I remember you don't know either one of Marty Brennan I know that I know Marty. I don't know who that's the son is

[01:37:33.370 --> 01:37:35.910]
Tom Brennan he was there before us Steve Stone was there

[01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:39.790]
You know miss Steve Stone. Yeah, I remember he's by the other way I see you

[01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:44.090]
Don't worry Steve Stone 25 and 9 with the Orioles. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:45.450]
You know about her don't you anyway?

[01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:49.110]
Here's the fact that this is for the greatest sports call of all time. What about that David Halberstom made

[01:37:54.030 --> 01:37:57.470]
Hardaway left for it. Yeah, I'm Marley three point oh

[01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.250]
He hit it

[01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:03.630]
He hit it

[01:38:03.630 --> 01:38:03.990]
Oh

[01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:09.910]
I don't mean that was a three. I mean that was from the moon

[01:38:10.590 --> 01:38:14.450]
From the moon from his restaurant about three blocks from here

[01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:19.090]
What a great guy Dave Halberstom got scoot over big time. I've been playing pet Riley for that you're an asshole Pat

[01:38:19.090 --> 01:38:20.970]
Okay, those are good easy show what?

[01:38:21.590 --> 01:38:27.790]
He still sends you bags of goodies. Oh, he's a great guy. He and his wife are super people they help us to

[01:38:28.930 --> 01:38:31.590]
Not to be confused with the politically oriented Dave Halberstom

[01:38:31.590 --> 01:38:36.190]
How could you forget about the great Gary Thorne? Well first of all because he's probably not great. He's good

[01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:39.490]
Gary Thorne is is is okay. He's pretty good

[01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:48.210]
Gary Thorne with an e on the end. You got a th r any Gary Thorne. Yeah, ESPN guide is hockey. He's uh Gary's pretty good solid

[01:38:49.030 --> 01:38:53.450]
The only thing I don't like about him is that every goal sounds the same. You know there's like that that

[01:38:54.630 --> 01:39:00.430]
Very predictable pause and then you know sounds like somebody shot him any answer with a cannon five six seven oh five six

[01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:05.550]
Steve the mad dog is running away with it. Let's hear it. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, we want more mad doggy all

[01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:09.830]
His ego is gonna be like puffed up man. He'll probably come in here like a god damn my bullfrog

[01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:11.970]
Look, I'm like a huffoso gracious man

[01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:17.830]
Who's gonna get Ricky a blow? There you go. Who'd have us would say that huh?

[01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:21.690]
I mean, but I do remember Chris Shankl saying he faked him out of his jackstrap back in 1956

[01:39:22.090 --> 01:39:24.950]
Back in the days when you just couldn't say that when a chance for playing a redskins

[01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:29.190]
He faked him out of his jackstrap and then there was a pause a pregnant pause when he realized what he said

[01:39:29.190 --> 01:39:31.510]
And he said he faked out of his shoes

[01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:36.250]
As if somehow by saying that it would cover up what he said the first time. Yeah, it didn't work. It didn't work

[01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:43.270]
G-man did I am a pussy? Yeah, but you're leading by leading the Pac-Man by a mile your favorite sports cast

[01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:46.930]
You're all the time and I bet you a lot of these people worsted mold would just let mad dog be mad dog

You have to be an old fart to remember Jim Gordon. He was great though. He was multi-talented

[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:59.840]
Did the Rangers did the next did boxing in New York? He was sensational Jim Gordon. Nobody knows who that is Tom

[02:01:59.840 --> 02:02:02.360]

[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:21.580]
US try US TV shies away from racie sitcom

[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:25.660]
This is from the BBC news. They're getting a little carried away because it's only two stations

[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:30.360]
WNDU in South Bend home not coincidentally of Notre Dame

[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.640]
You see the you see where we're going with this Notre-Dame

[02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:38.640]
Well, no, it's about them banning that show the coupling the sitcom

[02:02:40.220 --> 02:02:45.060]
And the other one is KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah. I was to see the connection there to Catholic Church in Notre Dame

[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:50.040]
It's big enough both of us. We just in the more WNDU in South Bend Indiana KSL

[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:55.380]
Salt Lake City are affiliated national over NBC which made the show but they aren't showing it because of its sexual content

[02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.120]
And we don't want no sex in Notre Dame do we and certainly not in Salt Lake City those moron?

[02:03:01.980 --> 02:03:06.720]
NBC's we made the cult head British comedy about six friends with the first episode to be shown tomorrow night

[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.700]
WNDU said the sexual jokes pushed the envelope well beyond the boundaries of our community standards

[02:03:11.700 --> 02:03:13.300]
They might even say penis

[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:17.200]
The stations managers said they were disappointed uncomfortable with the content

[02:03:17.200 --> 02:03:21.520]
NBC admitted the show is provocative but said the show was appropriate for national broadcast

[02:03:22.600 --> 02:03:27.380]
This is more about people not having sex the writer said as opposed to people screw in her brains out

[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:31.800]
Well, who else to see that? Who wants to see us show out people not having sex, huh? Not me

[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:38.260]
In fact, don't forget small bill nice Wednesday Clark's gonna be school brains out the seat. They don't have any sex on that show

[02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:43.000]
No, not yet. He's gonna discover it though and then man well, whoo! I doubt it

[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:50.160]
French silk chocolate pie somebody fact me this act the end of the show yesterday the recipe for French silk pies if I'm gonna be baking

[02:03:54.660 --> 02:03:57.620]
I'm telling you must be staking ill and I think they're uh their

[02:03:58.500 --> 02:04:01.540]
History I think the point is that French silk pie is a popular

[02:04:02.080 --> 02:04:04.100]
Concoction that is available in more than one place

[02:04:04.500 --> 02:04:09.120]
You know, I do understand that but there's a South Florida restaurant that's kind of like a staple of the South

[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.140]
Florida scene where one of their most popular

[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:15.700]
desserts was French silk pie that that's the point I'm trying to get across

[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:18.720]
I'm not saying that they're the only ones who ever made it or that they invented it

[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:23.500]
I think I've seen in the days when they had the mother butler I think I've seen a mother butler french silk pie

[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:26.040]
Oh, have you ever had those? Yeah, get it

[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:32.600]
Man, oh managers melt in your mouth if you like chocolate French silk pie. Oh my god. It'll change your life

[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:12.220]
Oh Neil I'm really enjoying the show. Thank you

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:16.160]
I just want to make two comments and ask you a question

[02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:17.600]
One I think

[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:20.840]
That Howard Coastal in the last

[02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:27.380]
Third of the 20th century made more of a difference in sports than any other announcer

[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:36.160]
I know how to do that. I mean the best announcer right uh, but uh, I mean in in terms of boxing and support of Muhammad Ali

[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:39.540]
Uh, money night football right

[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:45.680]
Uh, there's a refrigerator commentaries on his radio show too. Oh, I loved it

[02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:48.500]
And uh, Marty Glickman um

[02:05:49.080 --> 02:05:49.600]

[02:05:50.220 --> 02:05:58.060]
Was a great track star and was not allowed to participate in the 36th Olympic because he was Jewish right and uh

[02:05:58.720 --> 02:05:58.980]
uh

[02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:03.680]
And could broadcast they also did hornets raising at Yonkers race that is correct

[02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:10.680]
And I was just gonna mention that different kind of a racing right and my last question is I don't know why I've only heard you play at once

[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:18.100]
When Don Chul was fired and they let try to blame it on you or

[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:22.000]
Larry King called down and sort of screaming yelling at

[02:06:22.520 --> 02:06:27.160]
Where were you working? Oh, that was a Phil Henry bid, right? It was that a bidder is that

[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:32.680]
Is that uh, yeah, that was a bit. That was a made-up thing and where he did the law in place here

[02:06:33.540 --> 02:06:35.140]
I didn't know actually

[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:40.380]
But you know, I think that you know when you have to look at voting

[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:43.980]

[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:12.340]
It's just it need to perk it. It's taken up too much womb

[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:18.280]
Brandes isn't taken up too much room. Although I will say this they're getting bigger all the time because they've got over 40,000 pair of great name

[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:22.080]
Brand shoes and they're eight thousand square foot megastore over 25 years ago

Howard Cosell 39.

[02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.820]
I hate sports 38 and even 10% of this crowd hate sports.

[02:10:59.980 --> 02:11:00.860]
They don't want to know from it.

[02:11:01.020 --> 02:11:03.460]
They don't want to hear from balls or bats or anything.

[02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:04.580]
Maybe balls.

[02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.940]

[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:16.240]
He forgot his in Paul Christmas on her.

[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.220]
Like I said, what we don't want to know who that is.

[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:19.580]
No, I don't know who that is.

[02:11:20.020 --> 02:11:20.920]
And probably I'm not sure.

[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:25.260]
Mo you speaking a Mo most got 13 tied with Bob Prince.

[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:26.680]

All right, tied with any Harwell and Red Barber.

[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:42.120]
That's so good.

[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.820]
Van Miller 5, Fred Qsic 4,

[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:46.820]
John Madden 4 and he went on their late.

[02:11:46.940 --> 02:11:47.820]
Unfortunately, we apologize.

Keith Jackson 3 and down from there.

[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:58.240]
Somebody's faxes,

[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:59.880]
John and Tammy Amy are port faxes

[02:11:59.880 --> 02:12:01.060]
and I find this most amusing.

[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:02.080]
We'll put it on there.

[02:12:02.140 --> 02:12:04.420]
I guess if you want because it's a challenge spelling it.

[02:12:04.460 --> 02:12:05.680]
All you got to write there is spelled it right.

[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:06.680]
Wait, wait.

[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.120]
Who was a great pitcher for the Reds

[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:11.920]
and then he broadcast their games for 25 years.

[02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:13.340]
The most monotonous monoton,

[02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:16.320]
one of the ultimate ex-joc horrendous.

[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:16.840]
He used to sit,

[02:12:16.980 --> 02:12:17.600]
it's his famous,

[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:18.580]
Rheindelay broadcast,

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.940]
spoke for hours about baseball.

[02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:22.620]
How much the maker who was arrested

[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:25.840]
like the only problem is he would do it during the game too.

[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:28.960]
And he always did the game in the past tense.

[02:12:29.760 --> 02:12:31.260]
He would be telling one of his stories

[02:12:31.260 --> 02:12:32.300]
from like 20 years before.

[02:12:32.620 --> 02:12:34.040]
Oh, and you could hear the crack at a bat

[02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:35.560]
in the middle of the story and the crowd reacting

[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.760]
and then like 20 seconds later,

[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:37.000]
he would say,

[02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:37.920]
Johnny Branch,

[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:39.200]
I'm gonna first this hit a ground ball of the shortstop

[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.520]
and he threw the second for the first out

[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:41.960]
and he threw the first basins in double play

[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.580]
and he anything is over in the past tense.

[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:46.200]
See what I'm saying?

[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:46.820]
What?

[02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:48.200]
Right, exactly.

[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:51.160]
Wait, Hoi, you got him on here.

[02:12:51.280 --> 02:12:52.440]
He was awful, man.

[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:54.420]
He was bad, bad, bad.

[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:55.700]
Wow, was he bad?

[02:12:56.640 --> 02:12:58.620]
I'm surprised nobody said Van Patrick yet,

[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:00.880]
the great broadcaster for the Detroit Lions

[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.520]
who put on WSRF on here in Fort Lauderdale

[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:04.180]
a hundred years ago.

[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.340]
We put him on here?

[02:13:05.460 --> 02:13:05.600]
No.

[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.820]
No, Van Patrick and the Philadelphia Eagles.

[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:10.500]
How little they know,

[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:11.800]
you see the problem with South Florida,

[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:13.260]
I've talked about this many, many times

[02:13:13.260 --> 02:13:15.120]
is that it's so shelter geographically

[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:17.240]
that unlike when you grew up in the North or Midwest

[02:13:17.240 --> 02:13:18.360]
and they had the luxury at nighttime

[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.580]
of all those great 50,000-month signals coming in,

[02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:21.700]
oh, it was fantastic.

[02:13:22.140 --> 02:13:24.080]
Even Scott knows what I'm talking about, sure.

[02:13:25.420 --> 02:13:27.620]
KDK and Pittsburgh and WWVA

[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:29.640]
and Wheeling West Virginia, things like that.

[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:33.000]
Ah, where's the where's the where's the where's the where?

[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:34.760]
And KM election, St. Louis,

[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:37.000]
all of these things WAVC in New York,

[02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:38.800]
which at that time had some, I don't know, some ball games.

[02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:40.900]
So in any way, there you go.

[02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:42.480]
5'6, 7'0, 5'60,

[02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:45.840]
pound 5'60 on the AT&D, D and Verizon,

[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:46.340]
Marles line.

[02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:49.040]
Howard Dean in Folk Boston's revolutionary legacy

[02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.220]
on yesterday's the Americans to dump their

[02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:52.780]
later-day King George W. Bush,

[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:54.360]
whom he accuded of threatening democracy

[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:55.720]
and caring only for the very rich.

[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:57.720]
And he is absolutely correct.

[02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:00.140]
You go Howard, I'm still a Howard Dean man myself.

[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:00.760]
A lot of people.

[02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:03.180]
Hi, he's got a big pair.

[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:05.580]
And he's also smart enough him and his supporters

[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:07.500]
to use the internet to build grassroots support

[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:08.320]
and raise a lot of money.

[02:14:08.540 --> 02:14:10.280]
And they just shocked the hall of the establishment,

[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:11.480]
which is why I like him, you know.

[02:14:11.840 --> 02:14:13.440]
He's not hand picked like Wesley Clark

[02:14:13.440 --> 02:14:16.320]
by the little rock mafia, the Clintons, et cetera.

[02:14:16.500 --> 02:14:17.420]
Hand plucked.

[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:18.420]
Hand plucked.

[02:14:19.060 --> 02:14:20.280]
Here's South Miami, hello.

[02:14:22.080 --> 02:14:22.480]
Don't.

[02:14:22.660 --> 02:14:23.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:14:23.500 --> 02:14:24.740]
Hey, yeah, no.

[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:25.360]
Yeah.

[02:14:26.220 --> 02:14:28.900]
Rodi Rose, well, open a window at many.

[02:14:28.900 --> 02:14:29.900]
Here it comes.

[02:14:30.140 --> 02:14:31.160]
Hank Goldberg on.

[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:32.380]
Angry bird.

[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.480]
You see at the home runs.

[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:33.960]
Those days.

[02:14:34.180 --> 02:14:35.280]
Hank Goldberg, Angry bird.

[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:36.360]
Ray ever seen a team together.

[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:37.340]
No, same person.

[02:14:37.540 --> 02:14:38.660]
Rose, he rose well.

[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:39.360]
He was great.

[02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.460]
He was a great Pittsburgh.

[02:14:40.940 --> 02:14:42.280]
Ah, Prince was his understudy.

[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:42.780]
Right.

[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.620]
Listen, I need a,

What I need is your address to mail.

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.460]
I'm the mayor of this block.

[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:53.140]
And everybody's got dogs, cats,

[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.500]
cows, chickens, ducks.

[02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:58.740]
Now I'm going to hold the neighborhood

[02:14:58.740 --> 02:14:59.960]
and get some money for you.

[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:01.560]
Now I want to, I need an address.

[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:03.360]
I'll put you on hold and the scowl,

[02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:04.760]
I'll give you the info, okay?

[02:15:04.960 --> 02:15:05.100]
Yeah.

[02:15:05.480 --> 02:15:05.980]
Thanks a lot.

[02:15:06.100 --> 02:15:07.220]
Appreciate it.

[02:15:07.220 --> 02:15:07.860]
I'll take care of it immediately.

[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:08.380]
Take the info.

[02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:10.300]
I'll take care of it immediately.

[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:11.580]
Take care of it immediately if not sooner.

[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:14.060]
Five, maybe my ringcouple handled for you.

[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:16.880]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60 pound, five, 60 on a 18.

[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:17.940]

So we get our big one to two comedy bits are,

[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:21.360]
which is a nice restaurant for us here.

[02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:21.800]
I guess.

[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:23.220]
Well, not really a rest,

[02:15:23.340 --> 02:15:24.500]
but it's just like a recipe.

[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:27.500]
Yeah, from the hectic from the heavy duty pressure.

[02:15:27.580 --> 02:15:30.120]
I guess I better plug that promo again there for him and Gell,

[02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:32.200]
or he probably won't put out no more.

[02:15:32.700 --> 02:15:33.920]
Look for the QA and Vand today,

[02:15:54.720 --> 02:15:55.300]
Yes, sir. Okay.

[02:15:56.180 --> 02:15:57.680]
You just mentioned Ben Patrick.

[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.040]
You remember you used to do the Red Wing games.

[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.940]
Do I remember who did the Red Wing games?

[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:04.660]
Yeah, Bud Lynch and Bruce Martin.

[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.560]
Bruce Martin along with Sitable.

[02:16:07.700 --> 02:16:09.120]
Yeah, you know that Bud Lynch,

[02:16:09.160 --> 02:16:10.440]
Venus the Milo the one arm guy.

[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:12.100]
He's still doing the PA at the credit.

[02:16:12.240 --> 02:16:13.340]
Joe Louis Arena really?

[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:14.320]
Yes, he is.

[02:16:14.420 --> 02:16:16.200]
I heard you mark the eye here years ago.

[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:17.320]
Oh my God.

[02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:18.180]
He wasn't really.

[02:16:18.340 --> 02:16:19.240]
I didn't think he was all that good.

[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:20.380]
I thought Bud Lynch was better.

[02:16:20.540 --> 02:16:22.200]
I grew up with George Kellan TV,

[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:24.160]
but Ernie Harbour was the man.

[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:24.980]
He was the man.

[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:25.400]
You're right.

[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:25.840]
Hi, buddy.

[02:16:25.940 --> 02:16:26.300]
I'm good day.

[02:16:26.700 --> 02:16:28.500]
You two thanks some Detroit people.

[02:16:28.500 --> 02:16:28.900]
There you go.

[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:29.100]
Detroit.

[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.320]
When it used to be a great city.

[02:16:30.340 --> 02:16:31.440]
This is a long time ago.

[02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:32.280]
Till they burned it down.

[02:16:32.980 --> 02:16:34.940]
That just seems to have the funniest way happening.

[02:16:34.940 --> 02:16:35.460]
You know what?

[02:16:36.140 --> 02:16:38.360]
Yeah, it's what when people decide to burn their own city down.

[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:39.620]
All of a sudden it turns into a toilet.

[02:16:39.620 --> 02:16:41.820]
And often it just stays like the big bull.

[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.520]
Thomas Crapper would be proud.

[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:45.960]
Detroit is just like an outdoor toilet bowl.

[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:48.000]
Except the course at 11 mile under quinter.

[02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:49.740]
Hazel Park, home of Jack Riggs.

[02:16:50.280 --> 02:16:50.960]
Five six.

[02:16:51.100 --> 02:16:52.840]
I don't want to hear about how Jack Riggs is boring.

[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:54.920]
Do you know the first time that I had my friends

[02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:56.240]
from Detroit slept me to the race track,

[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.620]
which is a bad day in my life in 1960?

[02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:00.000]
That's 43 years ago.

[02:17:00.580 --> 02:17:00.980]
Okay.

[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:04.760]
Jack Riggs was announcing the races at Hazel Park that night.

[02:17:05.900 --> 02:17:08.760]
I bet $2 to show on Eldora Jencode number nine

[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:11.020]
driven by Donald McAmery, who's now dead.

[02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:11.720]
He won the race.

[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:12.700]
Pay 260 to show.

[02:17:12.940 --> 02:17:14.460]
But anyway, Jack Riggs was the announcer.

[02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:16.220]
Do you know who still call on the races at Hazel Park?

[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:16.900]
Jack Riggs.

[02:17:17.140 --> 02:17:17.740]
Excellent choice.

[02:17:17.900 --> 02:17:18.240]
There you go.

[02:17:18.440 --> 02:17:19.000]
All right, George.

[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.260]
See George Hose is crap.

[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.880]
He still sounds exactly the same little monotone

[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:25.640]
a lot of boring side not too excited.

[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:26.940]
You know, he's no Frank Salive.

[02:17:27.100 --> 02:17:28.660]
He's no what's his name.

[02:17:28.700 --> 02:17:30.680]
That's for sure from who we're talking about before

[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:31.600]
with Dick Feinberg.

[02:17:31.740 --> 02:17:32.120]
What's his name?

[02:17:32.740 --> 02:17:33.660]
From the meadows.

[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:34.840]
Diet.

[02:17:35.380 --> 02:17:37.080]
Yeah, I think the guy that screams it right here.

[02:17:37.360 --> 02:17:37.360]

[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.140]
Oh, that's for damn sure,

[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:40.880]
but you don't have to be screaming in yelling.

[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:41.840]
There's enough stress already.

[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:42.900]
Watch the narration screaming.

[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:43.960]
You son of a bitch.

[02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:44.900]
Walley hit it again.

[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:45.480]
You bastard.

[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:45.920]
You thief.

[02:17:46.060 --> 02:17:47.760]
You know, there's enough enough stress with that.

[02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:51.360]
Without having any announcers screaming and puking his guts out.

[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:52.740]
You know about that.

[02:17:52.800 --> 02:17:54.360]
You've been to the track twice twice.

[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:55.720]
Here's Carl Springs.

[02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:56.040]
Hello.

[02:17:56.920 --> 02:17:57.800]
Neil, how are you?

[02:17:58.040 --> 02:17:58.640]
Pretty damn good.

[02:17:59.080 --> 02:17:59.320]
Good.

[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:00.520]
I had a hockey announcer.

[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:01.460]
I wanted to add to the.

[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:04.960]
Okay, he didn't get a cell game of the week back in the 70s.

[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:06.440]
Also did the Rangers in Islanders.

[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:10.260]
My favorite hockey announcer ever Tim Ryan Tim Ryan.

[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:11.960]
I remember 10.

[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:14.240]
I don't know.

[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:14.940]
I think he's dead.

[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:16.240]
No, he's not.

[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:17.860]
He's still doing tennis on CBS.

[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:19.060]
Like I said, I think he.

[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:23.740]
But I thought he was a terrific hockey.

[02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:24.420]
He was pretty good.

[02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:24.740]
You're right.

[02:18:24.800 --> 02:18:25.160]
He was good.

[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:26.220]
He was.

[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:27.340]
I just thought he was a great Q6.

[02:18:27.440 --> 02:18:29.800]
Do you remember when Fred Q6 did the games and national TV on CBS?

[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:30.600]
Yes.

[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:31.480]
Fred Q6.

[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:31.840]
Great.

[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:34.840]
One of the guy wanted to throw in Gene Hart also that you.

[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.860]
Gene Hart the flyers fill off your flyers.

[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:38.340]
It's another taste of tasty cake.

[02:18:38.780 --> 02:18:39.040]
Yes.

[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:40.220]
Great hockey.

[02:18:40.340 --> 02:18:41.340]
And you know that is daughter.

[02:18:41.340 --> 02:18:42.380]
Of course he died a few years ago.

[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:44.600]
Do you know his daughter sings the national anthem at the flyer games now?

[02:18:44.720 --> 02:18:45.800]
Because then I heard it.

[02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:46.180]
Right.

[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:47.020]
She's good.

[02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:48.180]
Yes, she is.

[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:49.260]
Thanks a lot, Paul.

[02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:49.700]
I have everything.

[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:51.920]
You got Gene Hart down here.

[02:18:52.640 --> 02:18:54.340]
H a R T got it.

[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:56.140]
Gene is GE and you don't put like no.

[02:18:57.100 --> 02:18:58.260]
Too many tasty cakes.

[02:18:58.260 --> 02:18:59.060]
I think for Gene.

[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:03.840]
He bulked up just a little bit is rich on a red on poor not.

[02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:06.540]
I said I bet she doesn't have any votes.

[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:08.240]
So help me got a few.

[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:08.880]
Doesn't have any votes.

[02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:10.240]
It's going to really frost my ass.

[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.000]
I don't see a monitor.

[02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:12.560]
Do you?

[02:19:12.740 --> 02:19:13.340]
I'm right.

[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:13.800]
You need an email.

[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:14.680]
Oh, there it is.

[02:19:14.720 --> 02:19:15.200]
He's got one.

[02:19:15.200 --> 02:19:17.400]
That must be fat boy finally voted nice going fat boy.

[02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:18.120]
You tub of crap.

[02:19:18.740 --> 02:19:19.460]
Here we thorn.

[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:22.460]
We said here we thorn did that we not put him on their T or in E.

[02:19:22.540 --> 02:19:23.720]
There he's got the other side.

[02:19:24.040 --> 02:19:25.360]
What he's got two votes.

[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:27.100]
Here we thorns got a pair.

[02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:27.840]
How do you like that?

[02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:28.460]
He's he's good.

[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:29.180]
He's good.

[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:31.860]
He's like a little bit too generic for me, but he's no Joe.

[02:19:31.980 --> 02:19:32.120]
Born.

[02:19:32.140 --> 02:19:33.240]
I'm a tough guy.

[02:19:35.120 --> 02:19:36.340]
I'm a hard to make the story.

[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:37.200]
Joe bones great.

[02:19:37.340 --> 02:19:39.200]
He's the greatest sportscaster in history of mankind.

[02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:41.260]
Beyond a shadow, but I even George would agree with that.

[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:41.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:43.420]
1250.

[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:44.600]
Well, he does the promos for me.

[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:46.500]
So the hell you got to well, you know suck his ass a little bit.

[02:19:46.580 --> 02:19:46.980]
He's great.

[02:19:47.100 --> 02:19:48.400]
There ain't nobody in the world like Joe.

[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:49.440]
Boy, man, I'm sitting right there.

[02:19:49.520 --> 02:19:50.100]
Go leave school.

[02:19:50.200 --> 02:19:52.040]
I'll tell you that and he's aggressive with out.

[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:53.640]
And there you go with the Harry Neal.

[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:55.940]
I know you've got bad chase either is the best color guy.

[02:19:55.940 --> 02:19:56.600]
When you agree with that.

[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:56.920]
Yes.

[02:19:57.120 --> 02:19:57.340]
Yes.

[02:19:58.580 --> 02:20:00.000]
5 6 7 0 5 6.

[02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:00.520]
Yeah, no idea.

[02:20:00.600 --> 02:20:02.480]
One give the numbers out again because we're all number of the positive.

[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:03.780]
They because we got the one to two hour.

[02:20:03.840 --> 02:20:05.540]
We got all the lines lit up there with more sports catch.

[02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:07.440]
But I think we got enough on the bold.

[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:11.400]
No, before going up to what you're going to type.

[02:20:11.720 --> 02:20:15.240]
And listen, there's like a lot of great sports casters and a lot of great dead sports casters.

[02:20:15.520 --> 02:20:17.940]
Wait till we do the poll on who's the worst sportscaster of all time.

[02:20:19.140 --> 02:20:20.380]
Who's the most boring sport?

[02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:22.440]
You know, there's nobody mentioned Dave Van Hornie today.

[02:20:22.620 --> 02:20:22.980]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:20:23.620 --> 02:20:23.940]
No, no.

[02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:25.280]
Oh my god.

[02:20:25.460 --> 02:20:27.260]
I mean, the Marlins are just kicking ass.

[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:28.680]
All of some unexpected excitement.

[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.820]
And this guy up, up and away.

[02:20:31.420 --> 02:20:32.700]
And I'm exaggerating.

[02:20:32.820 --> 02:20:33.960]
You didn't get quite that excited.

[02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:37.300]
He probably saves it all for his lovely wife, you know.

[02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:41.520]
Hey, it's that time of year again when the mattress showrooms and furniture stores run those phony ad sales.

[02:20:41.680 --> 02:20:43.200]
Speaking of where you're going to be doing it.

[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:44.700]
The automatrix asked this.

[02:20:44.880 --> 02:20:47.340]
If you double the price and then offer half off, what kind of a deal is that?

[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:54.620]
The fact is that these kind of stores that pull that crap have to run a sale to come even close to the everyday low prices at the automatrix 3.5 days a year.

[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:58.340]
So for discount prices on dozens of top models in the world from Celi,

[02:20:58.340 --> 02:21:02.020]
Certa, temperedic, Simmons, King Coilers, Sterns and Fawsta, hewitt.

[02:21:02.380 --> 02:21:04.560]
You need to call this toll free number 1-800 mattress.

[02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:09.100]
No nonsense, no bait and swish, no house brands, no phony promises and best of all.

[02:21:09.380 --> 02:21:12.000]
You don't have to pay any premium at all for the best service on a planet.

[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.060]
You get service like you've been dreaming about from delivery team rank number one and customer satisfaction.

[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:19.340]
When you call down a mattress at 1-800 mattress, it's the truth.

[02:21:19.700 --> 02:21:23.500]
You pick the day and time of your delivery when it's convenient for you when your ass is going to be home.

[02:22:01.520 --> 02:22:02.960]
The radio is on your channel.

[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.920]
You am.

[02:22:06.780 --> 02:22:13.200]
I'm Andre Dawson of the Chicago Curves and this is the Neil Rogers 1-2-hour Go Curves.

[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:16.140]
As he has born, Fox and the tower addition take one.

[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:20.260]
Hello sports fans, I'm Ozeos one.

[02:22:20.260 --> 02:22:22.080]
The Prince of f***ing football.

[02:22:22.480 --> 02:22:25.180]
This year looks like it's going to be exciting in the NFL.

[02:22:25.920 --> 02:22:29.480]
One team to definitely watch out for are the Green Bay Packers.

[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.240]
That's Ozzy. That's Packers.

[02:22:32.400 --> 02:22:35.320]
What? Packers. Green Bay Packers.

[02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:37.760]
Not Packers.

[02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:43.440]
Okay, okay. Okay. Can we start again? Can we start it over?

[02:22:44.260 --> 02:22:44.900]
Can we start it over?

[02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:44.920]
Can we music?

[02:22:45.880 --> 02:22:50.240]
In the IFC Central, you have to watch out for the upstart Cleveland.

[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:52.300]
Browns. Browns.

[02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:54.480]
What the f*** is a brown?

[02:22:55.480 --> 02:22:55.800]
Cut.

[02:22:57.900 --> 02:23:00.220]
How about those New England guys?

[02:23:00.680 --> 02:23:02.600]
The f***ing Patriots or something like that.

[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:04.900]
That reminds me of when I was growing up in England.

[02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:07.320]
Right near Birmingham. We were poor family.

[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.160]
Ozzy, stick to the scrap if you can, please.

[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:13.040]
F*** you, I'm the Prince of f***ing football.

[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.720]
Cut. Cut. Shen.

[02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:17.400]
Cut. David Brown.

[02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:23.240]
In the IFC, you have to like the f***ing's, the bears, the Panthers and Lions.

[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:27.200]
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm in line with the f***ing zoo.

[02:23:27.580 --> 02:23:29.860]
Well, these f***ing f***ing's and Panthers and s***.

[02:23:30.240 --> 02:23:33.400]
Is this football or mutual of Omaha's wild f***ing kingdom?

[02:23:33.700 --> 02:23:34.380]
Cut it.

[02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:38.420]
That's all that's on the Q-Cut, man. What do you want me to do, man?

[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:41.020]
That just raps my palsy.

[02:23:41.180 --> 02:23:43.380]
That's all for this week. I'm Ozzy Osborne.

[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:45.340]
The Prince of f***ing football.

[02:23:45.340 --> 02:23:53.240]
S***! Tonight on CSI Fire Island, Agent Buds and Agent Cheeks work hard to solve their

[02:23:53.240 --> 02:23:54.380]
queerest case yet.

[02:23:55.140 --> 02:24:01.240]
Agent Buds, bigging Buds, Cheeks, get down here now. I've got a stiff...

[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:05.660]
So, if I bring the wine, I'll wish you just can't, it, girlfriend.

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:07.820]
I'm talking about a dead body.

[02:24:08.140 --> 02:24:08.720]
Hello.

[02:24:09.300 --> 02:24:10.560]
Neckrown, no, no.

[02:24:11.520 --> 02:24:18.140]
CSI Fire Island, party fire skin, Richard Siddling Star as TV's newest, not so ambiguously gay,

[02:24:18.260 --> 02:24:19.220]
crime solving duo.

[02:24:19.580 --> 02:24:22.520]
Check out this, Buds. I've examined the physical evidence.

[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:25.020]
Let's get physical, physical.

[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.900]
Hey, why don't you put up pluggin' it, Buds?

[02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:33.380]
Now, I've deduced the Thiais Island prefers entering through the back door.

[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:37.700]
To hell, Craig! That narrowed down the list of suspects, Cup-Police.

[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:42.180]
CSI Fire Island, with special guest, our roofered Everett.

[02:24:42.220 --> 02:24:44.080]
Peace. Till my heart.

[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:44.980]
Love him!

[02:24:45.640 --> 02:24:50.420]
Don't miss CSI Fire Island, coming soon, but not too quickly, to CBS.

[02:24:51.060 --> 02:24:52.320]
Do or ex-condems.

[02:24:54.920 --> 02:25:00.120]
Ultra thin, so each time feels like the very first time.

[02:25:01.900 --> 02:25:06.400]
If you're making love to a foreigner, you'd better put one on.

[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.560]
Do or ex-condems.

[02:25:20.700 --> 02:25:31.720]
Alcatam, Alcatam, Siddling on fire Alcatam,

[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:40.600]
Saw it on the TV, the planning more attacked,

[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:46.220]
Of those laundry heads, not obvious smoking crack.

[02:25:47.860 --> 02:25:48.220]
Yeah.

[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:55.440]
And I got a funny feeling, it won't be too inject.

[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:02.100]
If we take out all those maniacs,

[02:26:02.100 --> 02:26:09.760]
So I'm singing Alcatam, Alcatam,

[02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:17.160]
I'm so damn tired, Alcatam.

[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:28.200]
Blow my boom, drop, boom, drop, boom, now blow my boom, drop, boom, drop, boom, now blow.

[02:26:30.420 --> 02:26:40.520]
Alcatam, anyway Alcatam, Alcatam,

[02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.440]
Exciting.

[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:47.620]
Rarely Afark, it's Alcatam,

[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:57.820]
Blow my boom, drop, boom, drop, boom, now blow my boom, drop, boom, drop, boom,

[02:26:57.820 --> 02:27:02.260]
Now blow up our cover today

[02:27:03.760 --> 02:27:05.240]
Jerk

[02:27:05.240 --> 02:27:06.600]
Our cover

[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:10.280]
Our cover

[02:27:12.820 --> 02:27:15.960]
I'm so damn tired

[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:27.320]
Change my diet again last year

[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.920]
I gave up pizza, I gave up beer

[02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:34.600]
I yearn was crazy, but everything has changed

[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:36.660]
Now it's yellow wee wee

[02:27:38.140 --> 02:27:41.740]
No more cleaning, that other spray

[02:27:41.740 --> 02:27:45.520]
That steady streaming improved my aim

[02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.200]
Inside the bowl I see sunny sparkle glow

[02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:51.920]
I am yellow wee wee

[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:54.760]
Yellow wee wee

[02:27:54.760 --> 02:27:56.800]
Yellow wee wee

[02:27:56.800 --> 02:28:00.340]
It's my mind now it's coming up fine

[02:28:00.340 --> 02:28:02.380]
Yellow wee wee

[02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:04.160]
Yellow wee wee

[02:28:04.160 --> 02:28:07.480]
No need for concern, our yellow don't burn

[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:11.180]
When I rip it out in public toilet fits a thrill

[02:28:11.180 --> 02:28:13.280]
I give a shake and by the rate

[02:28:13.280 --> 02:28:14.920]
With wee wee pleasure chills

[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:17.260]
Cause it's yellow wee wee

[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:21.860]
The straining and burning was not a good sound

[02:28:21.860 --> 02:28:25.740]
I thought it was wrong and old, girl friends of mine

[02:28:25.740 --> 02:28:29.440]
My doctor said no, just change your diet and your fine

[02:28:29.440 --> 02:28:31.700]
You get yellow wee wee

[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:36.700]
There's something wrong if it's hazy or clear

[02:28:36.700 --> 02:28:40.480]
Just not being a junk food, that yellow me appear

[02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.100]
Then you can be proudly, without any fear

[02:28:44.100 --> 02:28:46.400]
You'll have yellow wee wee

[02:28:47.980 --> 02:28:49.780]
Yellow wee wee

[02:28:51.240 --> 02:28:55.260]
The sight should be whole, but it's helping our pride

[02:28:55.260 --> 02:28:56.980]
Yellow wee wee

[02:28:56.980 --> 02:28:58.800]
Yellow wee wee

[02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:02.520]
Just look at it flow, now I'm feeling fine

[02:29:16.080 --> 02:29:19.040]
Chelsea, Victoria Clinton arrived three weeks early

[02:29:19.040 --> 02:29:23.340]
On February 27th, 1980, at 11.24pm

[02:29:24.040 --> 02:29:27.140]
While I was recovering, Bill would put his foot on my throat

[02:29:27.140 --> 02:29:31.660]
Yank me by my hair and say, woman, don't spoil her

[02:29:32.520 --> 02:29:34.000]
I said okay

[02:29:34.940 --> 02:29:39.500]
Chelsea was sold by her opium-addicted father when she was eight years old

[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:43.720]
Chelsea looked at him and said, bad things about her daddy

[02:29:43.720 --> 02:29:46.480]
That sealed the decision for Bill

[02:29:47.160 --> 02:29:49.460]
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry

[02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:53.340]
But even more frightening, at the age of 15

[02:29:53.340 --> 02:29:56.460]
Chelsea had come back to haunt us

[02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:59.160]
She escaped and returned home

[02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:02.080]
Only to be sold again to a whorehouse

[02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:07.020]
Who would want to do that to kids who had never done anything to them?

[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.080]
Me, Hillary, Rotem, Clinton

[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:14.820]
Chelsea said, come on mom, don't do it

[02:30:14.820 --> 02:30:16.780]
Oh yeah, right I said

[02:30:16.780 --> 02:30:20.640]
Looking like a dazed boxer who had just been pummeled in the ring

[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:24.900]
She leaned toward me and whispered in my ear, you bitch

[02:30:28.340 --> 02:30:32.060]
Ladies and gentlemen, the brothers who say now

[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:35.440]
One, two, three, four, five

[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:38.080]
Well, once in for all we know they're not alive

[02:30:38.080 --> 02:30:40.760]
Cause we found their hiding, finding back dead

[02:30:40.760 --> 02:30:44.040]
And now that they're dead, I don't feel it in a bitch's sand

[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:46.360]
They did things that were so damn sick

[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:49.140]
Most of them sons were roasted on a stick

[02:30:49.140 --> 02:30:52.140]
They were rapists, murderers, hoodlums and crooks

[02:30:52.140 --> 02:30:54.800]
And now they're just a memory in our wacky history books

[02:30:54.800 --> 02:30:57.440]
In the end when I'd like jerks

[02:30:57.440 --> 02:31:00.440]
I wonder if they finally lost those evil cocky clerks

[02:31:00.440 --> 02:31:02.920]
Watching TV while all hell broke dudes

[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.520]
And a mom hit them cup boosts

[02:31:05.520 --> 02:31:07.780]
Big old ugly youth, they finally died

[02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:10.500]
We're little brother who saved by his side

[02:31:10.500 --> 02:31:13.320]
I wonder if the daddy even tried

[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:15.780]
To save his sons or ones he'd terrifying

[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:18.820]
We finally closed the book and then took some

[02:31:18.820 --> 02:31:21.800]
They were full of hate to soak room some

[02:31:21.800 --> 02:31:24.500]
Now they're on the hell bound seven trains

[02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:26.940]
Say goodbye to the brother to save

[02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:28.800]
And now you're gonna think I'm crazy

[02:31:28.800 --> 02:31:31.140]
But I'm telling you I hear something out loud

[02:31:31.140 --> 02:31:33.540]
That's just a TV, don't be so paranoid

[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:35.520]
I don't think it's a TV

[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.480]
It's a TV

[02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:38.840]
Something's wrong out there, we're a fendard

[02:31:38.840 --> 02:31:40.100]
We're sending a guy then

[02:31:40.100 --> 02:31:41.020]
Send the lawful

[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:43.560]
But check it out, check on blind

[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:44.420]
What the hell is that?

[02:31:44.440 --> 02:31:45.180]
What the hell is that?

[02:31:45.180 --> 02:31:45.440]
What are those people?

[02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.780]
Oh no, oh no!

[02:31:48.520 --> 02:31:48.840]
Yeah!

[02:31:49.160 --> 02:31:51.900]
Now they're gonna give you a date, finally died

[02:31:51.900 --> 02:31:54.640]
We're little brother who saved by his side

[02:31:54.640 --> 02:31:57.360]
I wonder if the daddy even tried

[02:31:57.360 --> 02:31:59.920]
To save his sons or ones he'd terrifying

[02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:02.800]
We finally closed the book and then took some

[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:05.920]
They were full of hate to soak room some

[02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:08.020]
Now they're on the hell bound seven trains

[02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:11.120]
Say goodbye to the brothers who saved

[02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:14.160]
They have no money waiting here at the gate

[02:32:14.160 --> 02:32:15.720]
Uh oh, isn't this the...

[02:32:15.720 --> 02:32:17.680]
No, I don't think it is not in here

[02:32:17.680 --> 02:32:19.600]
Yeah, you know why I tried, huh?

[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:22.100]
Yeah, it's like a thousand degrees

[02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:23.040]
It's one like that

[02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:23.980]
Yeah, look at all this

[02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:26.820]
I thought Magdad was hot, but this is where we are

[02:32:26.820 --> 02:32:28.000]
It's ridiculous, huh?

[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:30.180]
If our gigantic Wednesday wanted to

[02:32:30.180 --> 02:32:31.580]
I got some bad news for you guys

[02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:32.040]
Uh oh

[02:32:32.700 --> 02:32:34.280]
A federal court is blocked

[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:35.920]
The national do not call this

[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:37.420]

In a ruling filed yesterday

[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:44.860]
The district court Oklahoma City said the FTC acted

[02:32:44.860 --> 02:32:46.600]
Without statutory authority in creating

[02:32:46.600 --> 02:32:48.580]

[02:32:49.420 --> 02:32:49.520]

[02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:52.200]

In favor of the plaintiffs claim that the portion of the

[02:33:01.620 --> 02:33:03.280]
Final amended rule that pertains to the national

[02:33:03.280 --> 02:33:05.600]

[02:33:12.020 --> 02:33:13.640]
An FTC official to climate

And he's still ain't interested in

[02:34:47.980 --> 02:34:51.260]
My candidacy is all about big changes I commend him

[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.900]
What about those orgies he has?

It really comes down to this

[02:35:08.780 --> 02:35:10.600]
Game over

[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:19.660]
When summer rolls around there's nothing I like more than sitting on the front porch with a nice cold glass of

[02:35:19.660 --> 02:35:21.080]
Country and moment lemonade

[02:35:23.780 --> 02:35:28.180]
The only thing they could make it better would be a pretty little girl sitting next to me

[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:30.640]
No, wait a second, a pretty little naked girl

[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:32.060]

We take a good, hard stiff look and a start

[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:02.740]
Their success, world up like pus inside a pimple

[02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:05.660]
Then burst like the pop zit they really were

[02:37:05.660 --> 02:37:08.140]
Sending a blast of oily bodily fluids

[02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:10.980]
Smacking against the mirror of short term fame

[02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:13.120]
They were the fixed

[02:37:15.980 --> 02:37:18.000]
Well, we couldn't have known how right we were

[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.160]
When we came out with one thing leads to another

[02:37:20.160 --> 02:37:23.640]
The fixed lead vocalist, Cycrin, and explains the law of cause and effect

[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:29.160]
Oh, we had a big hit song

[02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:30.780]
And we made a lot of money

[02:37:30.780 --> 02:37:32.000]
We got laid a lot

[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:33.680]
And then we put another record

[02:37:33.680 --> 02:37:34.980]
It's f***ing tank

[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:38.440]
We were broke, couldn't get laid to save our lives

[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.860]
Realized we'd gotten down a rear from getting laid before

[02:37:41.500 --> 02:37:43.320]
We took jobs in convenience stalls

[02:37:43.800 --> 02:37:44.620]
Started drinking

[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:45.800]
Through up

[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:47.440]
I mean, through up a lot

[02:37:47.440 --> 02:37:48.980]
When in the rehab

[02:37:48.980 --> 02:37:50.860]
Realized we had to do something

[02:37:51.440 --> 02:37:52.040]
Got back together

[02:37:52.040 --> 02:37:53.320]
And now we're okay

[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:55.300]
Playing one thing leads to another

[02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:59.120]
At county fairs for all the losers who like this back in the 80s

[02:37:59.120 --> 02:38:01.920]
The fixed, if you must do what they did

[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:05.000]
At least try and incorporate the getting laid part

[02:38:05.580 --> 02:38:08.680]

And bending those bitches over the cap

[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:50.460]
So join ice each week as he fires up this old row

[02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:51.920]
Is this old his owl?

[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:54.060]
It's on the In the Hood and Garden Channel

[02:40:54.060 --> 02:40:55.400]
Be watch, wood up!

[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:03.340]
Let's dance when all I want to have are

[02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:05.560]
For you to be

[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:09.880]
Listen when every sentence spoken

[02:41:10.560 --> 02:41:11.960]
Seems incomplete

[02:41:11.960 --> 02:41:16.760]
And everything that I need

[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:20.220]
Just makes me laugh out

[02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:23.540]
Put it be the stuff I'm smoking

[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:26.020]
Yes, it's the grass

[02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:29.940]
Ice really

[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:32.080]
Blast me

[02:41:32.080 --> 02:41:34.300]
I'm all the way to the top

[02:41:35.220 --> 02:41:37.160]
Just let me

[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:41.380]
Well, we, I'm all the way to the top

[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:48.320]
I'm all the way to the top

[02:41:52.820 --> 02:41:55.300]
I'm all the way to the top

[02:41:58.020 --> 02:41:59.580]
Somebody, somebody, somebody

[02:41:59.580 --> 02:42:02.300]
It's the big, long, low-out-and-boom world

[02:42:02.340 --> 02:42:04.220]
And the skirt roller

[02:42:04.840 --> 02:42:07.340]
And the pushing into the bottom

[02:42:07.340 --> 02:42:10.960]
For an advantage

[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:16.600]
Player Pan hangs from the surface

[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:19.300]
It article here

[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:19.300]

[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:19.300]

[02:42:19.300 --> 02:42:20.580]
On all the Pyramids

[02:42:20.580 --> 02:42:21.260]
I know it's a memory

[02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:22.180]
It's exactly a disaster

[02:42:22.180 --> 02:42:26.760]
...this was transformed

[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:33.320]
125 at 560 Q. I'm speaking of blowing it out. Look at that mad dog is blowing out the competition. You believe that?

[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:38.340]
All right. I believe in mind to pull question. Who's your favorite sportscaster of all time?

[02:42:38.600 --> 02:42:41.340]
Not this week. Not between now and circus, but of all time.

[02:42:42.040 --> 02:42:49.460]
Jim Mandage 82 leading the pack by a month. All right. Howard Cosell 49. I hate sports 44 9.4% of this crowd.

[02:42:49.460 --> 02:42:56.960]
Harry Carrie 31. Bob Prince 18. The Gunner. Kirk Audi 18. Mel Allen 17. Al Michael 17. Rick Weaver 16.

[02:42:58.220 --> 02:43:04.660]
Vince Cully 15. Mohawar David and 14. Ernie Harwell 12. Pat Summer 11. Marv Albert 10. Myron Cope 9.

[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:08.120]
Bill Zimper 8. Boog Shamby and Red Barber and Sonny Hirschwood 7. A piece.

[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:14.620]
John Madden Keith Jackson 6. A piece. The Humper. Hank Goldberg 5. Fritzucic 5. Van Miller 5. The Scuda.

[02:43:14.620 --> 02:43:20.980]
Phil Resurro 4. He's awful. Dan Kelly 4. Dickenberg 3. Gary Thorne 3. Chikern 3. Mordy Glickman 3. Chuck Thompson 3.

[02:43:21.460 --> 02:43:28.460]
Mike Langsley got a pair. No hockey people. Joe Bowen 2. We have no hockey people. Johnny Mos 2. Lindsay Nelson 2. Jack Buck 2. Foster Hewitt 2.

[02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:34.140]
How's Paul Henderson doing Foster? Mark Van Emere's a pair and everybody else either got one or they be having none.

[02:43:35.720 --> 02:43:39.120]
My and all. This is sports 20. Oh, Fycy.

[02:43:39.700 --> 02:43:40.280]
You way.

[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:42.960]
Yeah.

[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:43.300]
Is out.

[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:05.400]
This is girl. I know she's pretty and she's really nice.

[02:44:06.340 --> 02:44:08.720]
She's got a kick and smile.

[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:16.320]
And a woman booty that's real fine. So I stepped up to her and I put on my skills.

[02:44:16.540 --> 02:44:25.240]
I'm back the girl in my best. She was something special with those balance you call

[02:44:26.040 --> 02:44:27.280]
friends.

[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:36.120]
But she has to go and her friends. He's like Jackie Chan.

[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:42.120]
She's like from Kizmai in the desert.

[02:44:44.340 --> 02:44:49.860]
Her underarms are hairy. Her arms and prehistoric men.

[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:55.720]
She has to be a worse than a foreign exchange.

[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:07.600]
They say I love his taboo that what we're doing is wrong.

[02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.220]
But I don't care what they say.

[02:45:12.880 --> 02:45:15.460]
Because my love is so strong.

[02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:17.280]
You know what I mean?

[02:45:17.280 --> 02:45:19.400]
They tell us we should be ashamed.

[02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:22.960]
We're not husband and wife.

[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.320]
But I cherish each moment with you.

[02:45:28.440 --> 02:45:31.460]
I'm so glad you're in my life.

[02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:44.200]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:45:44.420 --> 02:45:45.580]
My prison bitch.

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.980]
You're not like other men.

[02:45:48.080 --> 02:45:48.560]
All right.

[02:45:48.820 --> 02:45:51.100]
I'm glad we share a prison cell.

[02:45:51.580 --> 02:45:53.660]
When lights go past a tin.

[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:56.620]
I can't extend to a bill.

[02:45:57.040 --> 02:45:59.200]
Now that would be a crime.

[02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:01.440]
As long as I am with you.

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:01.440]

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:01.440]

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:01.440]

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:01.440]

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:01.440]

[02:46:01.440 --> 02:46:04.920]
I don't mind doing time.

[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:09.100]
Cause you're my prison bitch.

[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:10.500]
My prison bitch.

[02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:12.680]
And I have no regrets.

[02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:13.380]
Welcome.

[02:46:13.700 --> 02:46:18.260]
I got you for a candy bar and a pack of cigarettes.

[02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:21.040]
At first you were resisting.

[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:24.060]
But now you're all my friends.

[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:28.200]
I knew that I would give you in the end.

[02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:31.520]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:34.280]
Prison bitch.

[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:38.840]
I guess that you were sick from above.

[02:46:40.280 --> 02:46:42.580]
Yeah, prison bitch.

[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:45.320]
Prison bitch.

[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:46.660]
Oh, prison bitch.

[02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:48.840]
And now you are my prisoner.

[02:46:52.120 --> 02:46:53.420]
And your prison bitch.

[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:54.760]
Your prison bitch.

[02:46:55.140 --> 02:46:56.780]
And you're a sex machine.

[02:46:57.540 --> 02:47:00.320]
I only have a full request.

[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:02.340]
How about some Vaseline?

[02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:02.940]
Sure.

[02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:05.760]
I'm tired of this prison cell.

[02:47:06.260 --> 02:47:08.100]
I need to get away.

[02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:11.360]
The sentence leads you seven years.

[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:13.800]
Now you're seven times a day.

[02:47:14.300 --> 02:47:15.360]
And your prison bitch.

[02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:16.860]
Your prison bitch.

[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:18.600]
You're an informer.

[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:19.720]
Maybe I could kill you.

[02:47:20.020 --> 02:47:22.100]
I really hate these nagers.

[02:47:22.420 --> 02:47:24.900]
That you doubt you know my back.

[02:47:24.900 --> 02:47:28.140]
I thought that I could break away.

[02:47:28.460 --> 02:47:30.540]
But now I'm losing hope.

[02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:34.500]
God, I'm part of the pain of the soul.

[02:47:34.860 --> 02:47:37.880]
Prison, prison bitch.

[02:47:39.140 --> 02:47:40.680]
Prison bitch.

[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:46.200]
Turn up the lights because I can hardly wait.

[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:48.980]
Prison bitch.

[02:47:50.160 --> 02:47:51.740]
Prison bitch.

[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:52.660]
Prison bitch.

[02:47:52.660 --> 02:47:56.700]
When I get out, I'm ready to go straight.

[02:47:57.900 --> 02:47:59.640]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:01.100]
My prison bitch.

[02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:03.540]
I'll never say goodbye.

[02:48:04.140 --> 02:48:06.580]
You're not like all the others.

[02:48:07.140 --> 02:48:09.700]
Too bad they had to die.

[02:48:10.620 --> 02:48:13.980]
On the second thought I'd live outstake.

[02:48:14.460 --> 02:48:16.440]
If you won't be too.

[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:21.520]
Your prison bitch is never leaving.

[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:22.600]
You.

[02:48:27.740 --> 02:48:29.980]
You're my prison bitch.

[02:48:30.420 --> 02:48:31.640]
But now you're my soul bitch.

[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:33.020]
So prepare America.

[02:48:33.760 --> 02:48:34.740]
I know, gotta go.

[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:36.800]
Now I know what they call you.

[02:48:37.180 --> 02:48:38.280]
Heart criminal.

[02:48:38.680 --> 02:48:42.380]
You know, you're about to find out when they call this the Pokey.

[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:42.600]
Oh, my God!

[02:48:45.740 --> 02:48:46.180]
Whoa!

[02:48:47.780 --> 02:48:48.060]
Whoa!

[02:48:48.520 --> 02:48:48.920]
Whoa!

[02:48:51.380 --> 02:48:51.380]

[02:48:52.480 --> 02:48:52.560]
Whoa!

[02:48:52.560 --> 02:48:52.760]
Whoa!

[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:53.740]
I filled my tank up.

[02:48:54.080 --> 02:48:56.420]
Now as I don't know, I'd be helping finance 9-11

[02:48:56.420 --> 02:48:59.540]
by giving money to Unicala, Rabaqa, and the car louse.

[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:01.420]
I've turned my lights on last night.

[02:49:01.720 --> 02:49:04.260]
I was having a lot of pain in James Baker's green colonies.

[02:49:04.520 --> 02:49:05.680]
I made ten of ten today.

[02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:08.100]
Now as I don't know, I was providing bath water

[02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:08.960]
to the Middle East.

[02:49:09.380 --> 02:49:11.120]
Well, that ain't so bad, again.

[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:19.500]
Every time you light a marijuana cigarette, you're helping to finance run learn overlords and breaking a law based on the old movie refer madness

[02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:25.320]
Better children are, is the schedule of old manguide?

[02:49:25.620 --> 02:49:30.240]
I just spent the revert joint. Now I'm white man, you know?

[02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:33.680]
For now I will jump out this window!

[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:38.960]
This was a fish made for by the community to keep the man of it in the dark ages.

[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:42.420]
Reggie white, for a scum of soup.

[02:49:43.660 --> 02:49:46.300]
Hey, nothing like a hot bowl of soup!

[02:49:48.260 --> 02:49:54.020]
You know when you take me back to a time when my man had done made all whole neighborhood smell like canned tomatoes.

[02:49:54.020 --> 02:50:05.640]
Wearing it like that no more, with all the new payments from camel soup, like chickaboo stew, with chunky rats bowl and bottom ellippit, and my favorite creme omule,

[02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:32.760]
How quick with teagal poop to make it.

[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:38.500]
I went to go to Jesus State and something wasn't right

[02:50:39.220 --> 02:50:43.920]
I took the walk on down the street and I took out my flashlight

[02:50:44.640 --> 02:50:50.020]
And I suspected something funny when I saw spotted blood

[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:55.140]
Then I jumped over the wall and an octon Kato's door

[02:50:55.760 --> 02:51:00.800]
He told me about some things he heard so I looked around some more

[02:51:01.800 --> 02:51:06.220]
And I suspected something funny when I found a bloody glove

[02:51:06.220 --> 02:51:08.000]
A bloody glove

[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:14.320]
A bottle didn't tell Kato a bloody glove

[02:51:15.800 --> 02:51:17.480]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

[02:51:17.480 --> 02:51:22.880]
Next thing we knew, OJ went on a low speed, Drunk or Ride

[02:51:23.800 --> 02:51:28.240]
Now he's in an LA jail charge for double homicide

[02:51:29.180 --> 02:51:34.100]
And I believe it's the first degree murder easier to yell

[02:51:34.100 --> 02:51:35.400]
It's because

[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:41.080]
Oh oh oh, bloody glove

[02:51:43.880 --> 02:51:47.080]
Your favorite sportscaster of all time is holding 21 minutes away

[02:51:47.080 --> 02:51:49.420]
The mad dog, Jim, and it's a two-cat, hopper at four

[02:51:49.420 --> 02:51:49.840]
What?

[02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:51.480]
Late scratch, it's Joe Rose

[02:51:53.020 --> 02:51:55.280]
Well see this is what happens, it goes to their head

[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:58.540]
They win the thing by a zillion miles and then right off the bat they're taking the day off

[02:51:58.540 --> 02:51:59.280]
All right

[02:52:01.740 --> 02:52:04.760]
That's unbelievable so the guy wins hands down on our pole

[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:09.080]
And right off the bat doing it the QAMF and way he takes the day off

[02:52:09.080 --> 02:52:11.020]
Because maybe he's got a big heart on it

[02:52:11.020 --> 02:52:14.540]
That might be it from Cino's pole results so to speak

[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:18.220]
Anyway, mad dogs got the 91 votes, Howard Coase, L51

[02:52:18.220 --> 02:52:20.360]
I hate sports 46, 9.2%

[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:24.520]
Harry Scary 34, Bob Prince move it up there and rightfully so 20

[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:27.980]
Al Michaels 19 and Demel Allen 18, small potatoes after that

[02:52:27.980 --> 02:52:30.760]
20 till 2 at 5.60 QAM

[02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:36.360]
Ride in local, your sports radio 5.60 QAM

[02:52:38.460 --> 02:52:39.640]
My rear end

[02:52:39.640 --> 02:52:40.060]
Okay

[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:47.400]
Rackum

[02:52:47.400 --> 02:52:49.340]
Some of them are proud

[02:52:50.980 --> 02:52:53.400]
And that's all my great

[02:52:53.400 --> 02:52:55.900]
And that's all my great

[02:52:55.900 --> 02:52:59.640]
Well then can't walk up and can't walk

[02:52:59.640 --> 02:53:02.220]
And one is six foot eight

[02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:06.260]
And one of them is four

[02:53:06.260 --> 02:53:08.260]
And one of them is a girl

[02:53:08.260 --> 02:53:10.760]
And likes this criminal a

[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:12.520]
Like this criminal a

[02:53:12.520 --> 02:53:12.860]
Oh right

[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:15.200]
California free show

[02:53:15.200 --> 02:53:17.320]
A born and free show

[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:19.840]
A free collection day

[02:53:21.400 --> 02:53:23.180]
Swords and nigger ho

[02:53:24.680 --> 02:53:27.260]
He doesn't sell terminate

[02:53:29.840 --> 02:53:31.260]
And every single hustler

[02:53:33.600 --> 02:53:36.000]
Relax and delete

[02:53:38.500 --> 02:53:42.660]
And for Gary Coleman and Gary Coleman

[02:53:42.660 --> 02:53:44.600]
Would almost hit on your plate

[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:46.980]
Almost hit on your plate

[02:53:46.980 --> 02:53:49.460]
California free show

[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.540]
A born and free show

[02:53:51.540 --> 02:53:53.900]
It's a weird election save

[02:53:55.700 --> 02:53:58.320]
Things are looking damn bad

[02:53:58.320 --> 02:54:02.000]
I'm not getting out of the olden state

[02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.080]
Born and gone in state

[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:06.160]
And I told myself

[02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:07.980]
I told myself

[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.800]
It's not their face

[02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:13.160]
It's not their face

[02:54:13.160 --> 02:54:17.280]
I would vote for a real born to break it

[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:18.820]
It was hell today

[02:54:18.820 --> 02:54:21.080]
It was hell today

[02:54:22.000 --> 02:54:23.700]
California free show

[02:54:23.700 --> 02:54:25.900]
A born and free show

[02:54:25.900 --> 02:54:27.980]
It's such a freaky state

[02:54:41.060 --> 02:54:42.700]
Mr. Lector

[02:54:42.700 --> 02:54:45.700]
Save me a piece

[02:54:45.700 --> 02:54:49.000]
I'm disappointed you passed on claries

[02:54:49.540 --> 02:54:54.720]
Still eating people right after you kill them

[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:58.020]
Not even leaning behind a tiny crow

[02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:58.960]
Lector

[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:01.920]
Finger again

[02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:04.000]
He cleans up people

[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:05.640]
Taste just like chicken

[02:55:05.640 --> 02:55:09.240]
If you've seen it all fall on the streets

[02:55:10.020 --> 02:55:13.960]
Better honor you or dead meat

[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:23.620]
Mr. Lector

[02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:26.480]
I've got to ask

[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:30.400]
How do you eat things through that funky mask?

[02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:32.820]
The billet looks good

[02:55:32.820 --> 02:55:34.800]
You can't move your jaw

[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:37.440]
The first candle will be used

[02:55:37.440 --> 02:55:39.800]
The still is your old Lector

[02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.460]
I wish I saw

[02:55:43.480 --> 02:55:44.760]
You pay a visit

[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:46.560]
To Jevacorn

[02:55:46.560 --> 02:55:50.080]
Keep the Clintons on your next break

[02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:53.680]
Just remember you're Pepsi-A-C

[02:55:55.460 --> 02:55:58.060]
Next week on The Sipranos

[02:55:58.060 --> 02:56:00.680]
Come over I'm not going to say goodbye to your bankers

[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:04.460]
Tell me you guys are going to say goodbye to your bankers

[02:56:04.460 --> 02:56:06.680]
I'm going to say goodbye to your bankers

[02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:08.980]
I'm going to say goodbye to your bankers

[02:56:08.980 --> 02:56:10.320]
The Sipranos

[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:12.120]
Look at the impression of my diars

[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:15.600]
My diars are all left to my rear out of my diar

[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:17.180]
They're just all lullets, huh?

[02:56:17.480 --> 02:56:18.520]
The Sipranos

[02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:20.120]
Oh, we don't ask an Oli

[02:56:20.120 --> 02:56:22.020]
I had my mouth said I'm echoed Oli

[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:24.380]
Hey, Jay! You fat lumb!

[02:56:24.620 --> 02:56:25.920]
Did you eat the last cunolele?

[02:56:26.160 --> 02:56:27.060]
That was ugly, wasn't it?

[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:28.980]
Baw! Do you know why I didn't eat cunolele?

[02:56:29.140 --> 02:56:30.280]
Yeah, I haven't had any money

[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:31.500]
The Sipranos

[02:56:31.500 --> 02:56:33.380]
Christopher, let me talk to you

[02:56:33.380 --> 02:56:33.920]
Yeah, talk to you

[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:35.680]
Did his cargo pairs make my butt look big?

[02:56:35.880 --> 02:56:36.340]
What time?

[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:38.740]
My boss, today I'm picking these cargo pants

[02:56:38.740 --> 02:56:40.320]
I'm going in a wax and light

[02:56:40.320 --> 02:56:42.180]
We don't do that anymore in this show

[02:56:42.180 --> 02:56:43.640]
It's all about my digital bankers

[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:45.700]
It's an Oli's and that pressure and a diars

[02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:47.000]
The Sipranos

[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:48.880]
Should've been me and that cock

[02:56:49.980 --> 02:56:51.340]
I love to...

[02:56:52.540 --> 02:56:53.820]
My sweet cat

[02:56:53.820 --> 02:56:56.700]
Bobby, can I fix you some chicken masala?

[02:56:57.200 --> 02:56:59.140]
How about some congealed meat?

[02:56:59.140 --> 02:56:59.520]
That's all

[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:02.020]
Not about passing beans

[02:57:02.020 --> 02:57:03.040]
It's the right chance

[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:03.700]
It's...

[02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:05.360]
It's not about eating that cock

[02:57:05.360 --> 02:57:08.140]
I love to...

[02:57:09.120 --> 02:57:10.260]
Come on, cat!

[02:57:11.900 --> 02:57:13.340]
This is the Prano's

[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:15.400]
David Chase is done again

[02:57:15.400 --> 02:57:17.700]
Who could believe he could take a fast pace

[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:18.920]
Crown breaking series

[02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:20.680]
And make it look like Blossom

[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:20.980]
Why?

[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:22.720]
Remember the girl with the big horn in the kid who said

[02:57:22.720 --> 02:57:23.060]
Whoa!

[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:24.140]
Uh, metal!

[02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:25.480]
Can you see my underpants?

[02:57:25.900 --> 02:57:27.060]
My underpants!

[02:57:27.660 --> 02:57:28.640]
Where's my underpants?

[02:57:30.660 --> 02:57:31.180]
Why?

[02:57:31.620 --> 02:57:34.060]
My underpants!

[02:57:34.060 --> 02:57:34.300]
Why?

[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:38.600]
I thought Christie and the tea was fairy tale

[02:57:38.600 --> 02:57:43.620]
This religious thing was not for me

[02:57:45.500 --> 02:57:48.160]
They held a big convention

[02:57:48.940 --> 02:57:51.180]
And let me implore free

[02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:56.440]
I had no idea what I was about to see

[02:57:56.440 --> 02:57:57.120]
Oh!

[02:57:57.400 --> 02:57:58.640]
They were speaking in tongues

[02:57:59.160 --> 02:58:00.060]
That's what they were

[02:58:00.060 --> 02:58:01.680]
That they'd be a believer

[02:58:02.480 --> 02:58:04.820]
It was kind of fun

[02:58:04.820 --> 02:58:08.060]
To stick it out of my mouth

[02:58:09.540 --> 02:58:10.980]
Speaking tongues

[02:58:12.220 --> 02:58:14.820]
They got me believe in my tongue

[02:58:14.820 --> 02:58:17.100]
And we've been from side to side

[02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:18.220]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:23.780]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:29.020]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:29.020 --> 02:58:29.560]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:29.560 --> 02:58:31.260]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:31.940]
I'm not a bad man

[02:58:31.940 --> 02:58:34.080]
No Lord will now embrace me

[02:58:34.820 --> 02:58:36.720]
Or I'd plant my tongue to the beat

[02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:42.180]
Or now, whatever I do, you forgive me

[02:58:42.180 --> 02:58:42.780]
Oh, right

[02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:44.200]
Those now I speak in tongues

[02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:47.220]
But that makes me a believer

[02:58:48.800 --> 02:58:50.280]
And I'm having fun

[02:58:51.880 --> 02:58:53.740]
Playing round with my mouth

[02:58:54.860 --> 02:58:56.680]
Now I speak in tongues

[02:58:56.680 --> 02:59:00.980]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:00.980 --> 02:59:01.360]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:01.360 --> 02:59:01.940]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:01.940 --> 02:59:02.380]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:02.380 --> 02:59:02.740]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:02.740 --> 02:59:12.160]
I'm not a bad man

[02:59:12.160 --> 02:59:14.300]
He thought he was right to his head

[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:15.820]
He's speaking to your head

[02:59:15.820 --> 02:59:17.160]
If you've got no hair on your head

[02:59:17.160 --> 02:59:17.900]
Or like very little

[02:59:17.900 --> 02:59:18.800]
You'd like to have some mole

[02:59:18.800 --> 02:59:20.440]
And looking good as a voice to like mole

[02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:22.720]
If you don't want a dead muskrat or weasel on your head

[02:59:22.720 --> 02:59:24.360]
And you want people like looking at you and saying

[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:26.220]
Hey, he looks pretty good and a lot younger than we thought he was

[02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:28.800]
Charles Alfier is the only guy in the world to make you do that

[02:59:28.800 --> 02:59:30.200]
There's 80 billion guys out there

[02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:31.740]
They don't want to serve you some hair system

[02:59:31.740 --> 02:59:32.920]
And pills and potions

[02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:34.940]
And mousey looking muskrat stuff like that

[02:59:34.940 --> 02:59:37.380]
Charles Alfier is got the natural hair line system

[02:59:37.380 --> 02:59:39.280]
That looks like the real hair that's going on your scalp

[02:59:39.280 --> 02:59:40.160]
That's the difference

[02:59:40.160 --> 02:59:43.080]
So instead of having people fall down on their ass laugh and answer

[02:59:43.080 --> 02:59:45.400]
And realizing what a phony piece you got on your head

[02:59:45.400 --> 02:59:48.160]
You look like I said better and younger than you ever dreamed again

[02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:48.980]
And you got out of the loose

[02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:51.980]
But that shiny reflecting bald spot because everybody gets

[02:59:52.420 --> 02:59:53.580]
Charlie's 30 day guarantee

[02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:54.840]
You wear the piece for 30 days

[02:59:54.840 --> 02:59:56.420]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells

[02:59:56.420 --> 02:59:58.880]
If you're not getting more action than you did when you were like 16

[02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:00.380]
Charlie give you a full refund

[03:00:00.380 --> 03:00:01.380]
Unless like you're 17

[03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:04.160]
Call the day and take advantage of that $200 meal barge of Ziska

[03:00:04.160 --> 03:00:05.200]
When you mention my name too

[03:00:05.200 --> 03:00:07.560]
And don't forget Charlie also services and repairs

[03:00:07.560 --> 03:00:08.840]
All types of hair systems

[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:11.720]
Why do you wait for only 25 or 30 bucks and just about always

[03:00:11.720 --> 03:00:13.660]
Can make you look better like a real bench

[03:00:13.660 --> 03:00:15.800]
Call them toll free and give rid of that bald spot

[03:00:15.800 --> 03:00:18.460]
1-800-321-2413

[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:21.340]
That's 1-800-321-2413

[03:00:21.340 --> 03:00:23.280]
A log on it with most prestigious website

[03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:24.760]
Charles Alfier E.com

[03:00:24.760 --> 03:00:26.740]
And look all

[03:00:26.740 --> 03:00:28.880]
This is 4-3-0-516

[03:00:28.880 --> 03:00:31.340]
Way to A-M

[03:00:32.860 --> 03:00:33.840]
Howard from Boka

[03:00:40.500 --> 03:00:43.720]
Oh, that has really please go away

[03:00:44.780 --> 03:00:48.840]
Find a new way to attack up a big old home

[03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:51.500]
And eat your whole homes

[03:00:53.140 --> 03:00:54.780]
Until you're at slow

[03:00:55.960 --> 03:00:59.800]
Just like your fat fat churnin' ladies

[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:02.340]
Have to bite your seats on a plane

[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:07.740]
Spilling your fingers that a yellow stain from C2

[03:01:07.740 --> 03:01:09.940]
Can see your toes

[03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:13.960]
Faster piggy who knows

[03:01:14.740 --> 03:01:19.980]
How to be fat disgusting and tasty always

[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:25.600]
You make the childhood women smile

[03:01:25.600 --> 03:01:29.540]
They like a cow's scattered sassy

[03:01:29.540 --> 03:01:33.120]
Think smelly, fat, so repulsive and mild

[03:01:33.740 --> 03:01:37.180]
Your body cheese smells like a crap butt

[03:01:37.180 --> 03:01:40.300]
After it was occupied by head pass

[03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:43.140]
Learned it a shoe or two get into your car

[03:01:43.140 --> 03:01:47.380]
Dush and two got him wide

[03:01:48.180 --> 03:01:51.420]
I can squeal, I can squeal

[03:01:51.420 --> 03:01:53.900]
I can squeal fat lady

[03:01:53.900 --> 03:01:56.160]
Women with your number let me

[03:01:57.520 --> 03:01:59.980]
Slava and its door to the tree

[03:01:59.980 --> 03:02:01.920]
Between her knee

[03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:03.920]
That's material yeast

[03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:07.600]
Smells fishy to me

[03:02:08.680 --> 03:02:13.940]
Happened to put children at moist and tasty pain

[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:22.500]
Three old back, lives time's sex thing is old

[03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.100]
Sex is different today

[03:02:27.100 --> 03:02:29.860]
I hear every drug is safe

[03:02:29.860 --> 03:02:31.940]
That he needs something today

[03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:33.260]
To get it up

[03:02:33.940 --> 03:02:37.020]
And though I'm not really ill

[03:02:37.020 --> 03:02:39.380]
There's a nobody I could pill

[03:02:39.940 --> 03:02:42.040]
And as soon as daddy takes one

[03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:44.360]
There's no need for mom to fake one

[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:46.500]
And it gets me on the ball

[03:02:46.500 --> 03:02:49.140]
Gets me standing straight and tall

[03:02:53.640 --> 03:02:55.200]
Doctor please

[03:02:55.940 --> 03:02:57.440]
Submote and see

[03:02:57.440 --> 03:03:00.120]
I wanna score

[03:03:00.120 --> 03:03:02.280]
I need for more

[03:03:03.120 --> 03:03:07.120]
The old back things I'm sick in years old

[03:03:10.120 --> 03:03:12.540]
Then your saddened got a clue

[03:03:12.540 --> 03:03:14.920]
What we like and what to do

[03:03:16.020 --> 03:03:18.040]
So hard to satisfy

[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:20.600]
It's the last to watch you cry

[03:03:20.600 --> 03:03:22.960]
No, we are running for the shelter

[03:03:22.960 --> 03:03:25.580]
Of the father's little helper

[03:03:25.580 --> 03:03:27.800]
I could do this every night

[03:03:27.800 --> 03:03:29.340]
Be a porn hostile

[03:03:29.340 --> 03:03:30.460]
Yeah, right

[03:03:34.700 --> 03:03:38.340]
Doctor please more potency

[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:41.460]
Come back to bed

[03:03:41.460 --> 03:03:44.140]
She wants me dead

[03:03:44.140 --> 03:03:48.280]
The old back things I'm sick in years old

[03:03:48.280 --> 03:03:50.900]
You're living 16 about years right away

[03:03:50.900 --> 03:03:52.540]
How are you now?

[03:03:52.700 --> 03:03:54.580]
How are you now? He's fine

[03:03:54.580 --> 03:03:55.920]
What? Look at him

[03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:56.800]
I can't hear you

[03:03:56.800 --> 03:03:58.040]
Like when I was a teenager

[03:03:59.500 --> 03:04:01.680]
In 1945 he was a war hero

[03:04:01.680 --> 03:04:03.440]
And then he lost everything

[03:04:03.440 --> 03:04:05.360]
They're gonna freeze a human being

[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:07.560]
Oh, I have nothing left to live for, I'll volunteer

[03:04:07.560 --> 03:04:09.700]
He expected to be frozen for a year

[03:04:09.700 --> 03:04:11.180]
But there was a horrible mistake

[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:12.780]
He wanted to send me back your freezer

[03:04:12.780 --> 03:04:14.480]
I don't know, looks like a guy or something

[03:04:15.180 --> 03:04:17.180]
Wow, he's been frozen 50 years

[03:04:17.180 --> 03:04:18.660]
I probably got free super in by now

[03:04:18.660 --> 03:04:19.480]
I just leave him

[03:04:19.480 --> 03:04:22.420]
Mel gives him in his most controlled performance yet

[03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:23.640]
Oh, we have ice again

[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:24.300]
Oh, sorry

[03:04:24.300 --> 03:04:26.020]
He did the sketch to all your drink

[03:04:26.020 --> 03:04:26.500]
Oh, great

[03:04:26.500 --> 03:04:29.320]
Mel gives him stars in forever frozen

[03:04:29.320 --> 03:04:30.580]
Forever frozen

[03:04:30.580 --> 03:04:32.920]
Coming soon to an air conditioned theater near you

[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:34.000]
Bye, bye, bye

[03:04:34.000 --> 03:04:35.720]
The real Roger Show

[03:04:35.720 --> 03:04:37.480]
I'm rising to the end

[03:04:37.480 --> 03:04:38.780]
My name is for my name

[03:04:38.780 --> 03:04:40.720]
So many f*** ups who marches do it again
