[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.140]
It's phone on what day is it, Broward?

[00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.900]
And by the way, to the losers on Cloudy Channel?

[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.500]
The gimmick didn't work.

[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.300]
The gimmick was Asinine.

[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.540]
I appear on a program on network which happens to be carried by Cloudy Channel.

[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.620]
Guess what?

[00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.720]
What?

[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.840]
Yeah, our midday guy had a lot of laughs with it.

[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.420]
The laughter ends at some point, my man.

[00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:28.940]
Oh!

[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.480]
And this don't-be-ness perceived ashtick is Asinine.

[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.980]
A lot of trained monkeys on that program.

[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.020]
Had your fun, fun's over, careful, paybacks of bitch.

[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.020]
Oh!

[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.660]
It's coming.

[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.440]
It's coming.

[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.360]
Buckle your seatbelts because when I drop it, what happened in here?

[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.160]
First sheemon 45 was nothing.

[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:08.380]
Because when I drop the bomb on certain folks here and certain folks elsewhere, it's

[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.600]
going to be painful, baby.

[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.660]
We don't want to get into personalities.

[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800]
So what does it mean we're not in 10 hours today?

[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.220]
I can't be scared.

[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.680]
If you like that, you're welcome on the day.

[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.260]
25 boys won a motional girl.

[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.820]
Because they beat anymore desperate.

[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.620]
Lying like dogs, she didn't care.

[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.840]
They just want to see her bear.

[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.020]
The bachelor rat, Trista's her name.

[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.020]
And secretly she thinks she's man or lame.

[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.420]
But she tongue them all, these holy guys.

[00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.660]
And some even got to rep-hunterize.

[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.380]
She was a cheerleader.

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.180]
They wanted to run on her.

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.080]
But they were good enough for her.

[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.460]
When they saw her pretty face, they came to foodie race.

[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.500]
And the only one gets mistaken, tell me.

[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.540]
I'm going to have to go back to the bathroom.

[00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.820]
Making me go.

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180]
Oh, don't worry.

[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.260]
10 minutes.

[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.580]
I got to have to go back.

[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.600]
Hey, where the hell are you?

[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.900]
I'm Amy's Carlos.

[00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.460]
Get your ass out of that sink.

[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.320]
I got to wash these H spots off my hand.

[00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.540]
OK, I promise I will.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.440]
How are you doing in there anyway?

[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.360]
I am washing my balls.

[00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.160]
Forget out of there now.

[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.960]
OK, I promise.

[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.920]
I will.

[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.900]
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.080]

[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.760]
I kind of like a boy with a ball of foam there.

[00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.260]
Or like a hardware in your face.

[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.640]
Kind of a sexy.

[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.900]
I like that bowl of your balls.

[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.220]
Yeah, he's coming.

[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.900]
No, no.

[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.620]
You are a very bad man.

[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.180]
You're not my type.

[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.780]
Give me a dollar.

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.000]
OK.

[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.380]
I'll give you a dollar.

[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.440]
Say, let me give you a hand washing your balls.

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.000]
No, leave me alone.

[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.560]
I will not be your bitch.

[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.900]
Come on, I'll chop me.

[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.140]
You get used to it.

[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300]
Please, I have no balls and my mother's car.

[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.280]
Not a single luxury.

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.420]
I'll give you a dollar.

[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.440]
OK.

[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.120]
Who's the little boy?

[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.400]
Yeah, ow.

[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.420]
What do you got down there?

[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.720]
Some kind of me grand, isn't it?

[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.780]
I can't obviously win.

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.540]
I can't get out.

[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.040]
I can't get out.

[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.020]
I can't get out.

[00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.180]
I can't get out.

[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.200]

[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.300]
Oh, I'm a monkey.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.780]
You're a monkey.

[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.340]
She's a monkey.

[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.240]
Where are monkeys now?

[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.560]
I'm a monkey.

[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:51.060]
You're a monkey.

[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.620]
She's a monkey.

[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.380]
You're a monkey.

[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:53.480]
Where are monkeys now?

[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.760]
Swinging, trade, you trade.

[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.680]
Whisk, cream, that's what can shout.

[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.800]
No, response, that's a bell.

[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.660]
That's what we're all on.

[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.360]
Oh, I'm a monkey.

[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.840]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.340]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.100]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.100]

[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.900]
We don't know anything.

[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.500]
We're told because we don't know how.

[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.980]
Don't brush our teeth.

[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.540]
Don't come.

[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.060]
Our hair.

[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.660]
We don't even wear clothes.

[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.940]
We're lost on make you're lazy.

[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.020]
When our fire went on, checks fall.

[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.280]
I'm a monkey.

[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.780]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.300]
She's a monkey.

[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.840]
He's a monkey.

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.200]
Where are monkeys now?

[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.000]
We're not well-mannered.

[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.780]
We'll be hid.

[00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.540]
We just look to drop straw.

[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.960]
Well, don't some friends.

[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.760]
We'll meet you.

[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.580]
I'm from two.

[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.680]
We are fed.

[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.460]
Then we'll lay down.

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.700]
We're not friends.

[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.140]
Our butt said, watch you.

[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.080]
I'll turn red.

[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.760]
I don't want to hear a monkey.

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.300]
She's a monkey.

[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.820]
She's a monkey.

[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.220]
We're all monkeys now.

[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.200]
We wouldn't want to be a dumb cat.

[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.480]
A horse or cow.

[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.780]
We're smelly.

[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.760]
And we like it.

[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.740]
And we've heard the things you said.

[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.300]
Don't come with thin, thin feet of us.

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.020]
Or we'll listen to your head.

[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.240]
Oh, I'm a monkey.

[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.620]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.360]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.060]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.180]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.560]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.640]

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.080]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.320]
You're a monkey.

[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.300]
When you say to me.

[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.340]
Please leave me as well.

[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.860]
Can't tell.

[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.480]
Now it's by personality.

[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.680]
That's why we're all monkeys.

[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.180]
I was attacked by the monkey.

[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.780]
He went and named my friend Bunga.

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.060]
Oh, no, I don't feel safe.

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.060]

[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.920]
I'm in India!

[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.280]
Oh, I'd rather be in New York than drive a cab!

[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.840]
Thank you, my friend!

[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.000]
Wooo!

[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.520]
Wooo!

[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.100]
Wooo!

[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.480]
Oh, thank you, my friend!

[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.980]
Wooo!

[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:43.400]
Did you see our ratings for the last book?

[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.580]
Yeah, I know what that is!

[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.280]
Sure!

[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.740]
Could not be obvious!

[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.160]
Watch your back to back!

[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:51.160]
Play your own way!

[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.180]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.360]
Watch your back, Pat!

[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.520]
Play your own way!

[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.480]
No more!

[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.260]
I got enough!

[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.980]
I got to think about on top of getting right there, and I don't need a rating that's a minus eight!

[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.520]
Don't care what you do, long as it's understant, you gotta wake a little hotter on the guest you must!

[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.360]
A russian guts to go!

[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.120]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know!

[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.700]
That's right, watch your back!

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.520]
That's right, watch your back!

[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.280]
Play your own way!

[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.300]
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more!

[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.660]
Watch your back, Pat!

[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.660]
Play your own way!

[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.520]
Play your own way!

[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.080]
Oh, brother, all that blah, blah, I don't understand!

[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.080]
Are you coming from a trough while using both energy?

[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.920]
That big fat, much you made a rating, small!

[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.640]
You just like Clinton, it's all your fault!

[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.640]
And a straight-gip fat ass out!

[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.320]
Well, we'll take the food out of your mouth!

[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.860]
That's right, watch your back!

[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.380]
Play your own way!

[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.520]
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more, no more!

[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.740]
Watch your back, Pat!

[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:50.900]
Play your own way!

[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.880]
No more, no more!

[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:53.880]
This is what we said!

[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.020]
Play your back, Pat!

[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.220]
Play your own way!

[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.300]
Play your own way!

[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.620]
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more!

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.600]
Watch your back, Pat!

[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.720]
Play your own way!

[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:02.140]
Play your own way!

[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.840]
Play your own way!

[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.780]
Who I am!

[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.380]
Yes, Lucky, it does, it's Rocky!

[00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.760]
No.

[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.860]
I know one more time if you're up high!

[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.540]
It's just a...

[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.900]
Pat!

[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:51.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.840]

[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.860]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.860]

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.860]

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.860]

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.860]

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:51.860]

[00:07:51.860 --> 00:08:21.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:51.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:21.820]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:51.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:12.940]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:44.440]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:19.020]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:51.820]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:51.840]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:11:57.540 --> 00:11:58.880]
Oh no!

[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:21.580]
It's all my bad guys Cover them with perch.

[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.620]
I'm not a bad guy.

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.620]

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.620]

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.620]

[00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:21.840]
浪 fright

[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:27.040]
For he's gone, there's about some rocks

[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:34.220]
They lay things to him, and they will go here

[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.320]
How come the rocks are so far?

[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:48.860]
I'm born in silver, well, more one seems to care

[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:55.800]
For he's post, him rubber underwear

[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:03.740]
He still gets the chicks, whittles down his pigs

[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.340]
With his dear him head like stairs

[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.260]
Will it be Sarah or Laura?

[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:25.320]
Mujo, Allison or Mel?

[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:33.000]
And when they find out there's more money

[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:41.060]
Will they still want to ring his bell?

[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:48.580]
Or tell Jo, who called to help?

[00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.480]
He resized in history, right?

[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.700]
Mound there is raindrops

[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.680]
It gives a sense to some real bad times

[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.220]
But career is beginning

[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:34.080]
He walks on nights of the smoke

[00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:38.060]
In his black leather jacket

[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.880]
Brought those wild winning pills in a joke

[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:49.260]
Who does everybody hack in?

[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.660]
Oh, he lies

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.160]
He's dismissed and played what you can call him

[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.580]
And who dies?

[00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:02.320]
Three, nine and nine

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.180]
And then it's little boy who

[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:11.060]
He lies again

[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:33.840]
Baby Madonna, you're a ball to fame

[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:38.060]
Takes me one whole minute to say your whole name

[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.680]
Baby Madonna, let the best of net

[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:47.060]
Have you met your uncle Sean and Marron yet?

[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.080]
Which are preferents will be there when you wake up

[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.880]
The post-goman choir of people and the sun

[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.600]
When they see a mother with a makeup

[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.960]
See how they run

[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.100]
Your mommy is Madonna, her brother's made him red

[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:15.780]
So how she ever gonna get you fresh bed?

[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.040]

[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.440]
They still want him this

[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.460]
Do I gotta go?

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.400]
Hold on the pants

[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:01.400]
I'm in here

[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.260]
I'm in here

[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:06.400]
Where is he right now?

[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:08.920]
Oh

[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.320]
Farnie

[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:15.840]
Farnie

[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.260]
Farnie

[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.400]
Well you just wait a minute if you...

[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.520]
Oh that was stupid

[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.860]
Oh, Pambus

[00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:33.280]
Oh, she's coming

[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.760]
I'm sorry but there

[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.560]
Come here come kids

[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.660]
So I just heard all the words to hear by the Beatles

[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.960]
Have you listened to so many Beatles tunes lately that you're ready to puke?

[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.500]
We'll hold it under your lunch because there's much, much more when you order Beatles or app

[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.360]
That's right, all Beatles songs known to men won complete volume

[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.860]
Song by the rap stars of today

[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.300]
Here ice cubes do the classic I wanna hold your hand

[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:01.380]
I wanna hold your hand and slap your motherfuckin head

[00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.820]
Bobby Brown, I see Kulio or LL Kool J doing the unforgettable valid

[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.900]
Hey Jude

[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.020]
Hey Jude, shit you f***ing mad

[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.200]
They're all here on Beatles rap

[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.040]
Order today we'll even throw in Yokohama's own arrangements of yesterday

[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:13.900]
Yeah

[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.740]
Call me out, 1-800-Rap me up

[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:20.220]
Right, call me out 1-800-Rap me up

[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.900]
If your car's life is over

[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.060]
Go see Pendover

[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:33.440]
You'll realize what you had was heinous when you hop in and ride your heinous

[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.080]
Oh yeah, you've enjoyed driving Mercury, you loved your Saturn

[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.080]
Now come and dig Uranus

[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:42.620]
Love that new car smell? Nothing smells like Uranus

[00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.200]
The pendability? No one has ever got stuck in Uranus

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:51.320]
Take the plunge, now be courageous, Pendover, and ride your Uranus

[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.700]
And if you like a car that holds the road

[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.240]
You couldn't wipe out Uranus if you tried

[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:01.240]
Uranus, powerful, yet great with gas, neat trunk space

[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.980]
Rest assured you can pack anything in Uranus

[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:08.800]
And if Uranus is rear-ended, our well-loeb-ricated joints will soften the blow

[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.200]
Come to our showroom and pick out Uranus

[00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.160]
And leave that messy paperwork to us

[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.100]
Check out Uranus

[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.580]
Take the dive-life-rag-rude gain is bent over and ride your Uranus

[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:25.760]
Excuse me, Bill, I'm Robert

[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.320]
Get out, Bill, get out

[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.820]
I'm the new owner

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.840]
Bill, as you may know, I'm the CEO of Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceuticals

[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.400]
At Johnson & Johnson, we have a standard physical exam that we give all the employees

[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.660]
Could you drop your pants?

[00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.420]
Oh my, what sort of underpants are those?

[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.460]
Oh, I'll have to have the wife get me a pair

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.260]
First, let me ask, are all of your testicles in working order?

[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.340]
The true three that are

[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:47.860]
Three!

[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.500]
Um, drop your underpants, would you?

[00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:50.920]
Okay

[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.020]
Oh my, that is impressive

[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.920]
All right, Bill, let's move on to the rectal examination

[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:59.860]
It says here on your chart you had some problems with a past rectal exam

[00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.820]
Something about the thermometer getting stuck?

[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.880]
How did you have that removed?

[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:03.520]
Operation

[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.920]
Ah, surgically removed

[00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.720]
You know, Bill, our researchers at Johnson & Johnson have developed a rectal thermometer that self-heats

[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:12.680]
Should make the exam much more comfortable

[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:15.240]
I think that was quite an accomplishment on their part, really

[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.220]
Yes, so do we

[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:19.180]
All right, Bill, if you're ready, we'll begin the insertion

[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.480]
Is there anything you'll need?

[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.400]
You have to have something to hold on to, you know?

[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.520]
Oh, yes, yes, quite right

[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.660]
Why don't you just grip the edge of your desk?

[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.080]
Okay

[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.840]
Oh, you'll want a grip tighter than that?

[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.240]
All right

[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.160]
And I'll just slide it right in

[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.520]
Get out of this hole, okay?

[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.100]
What's that?

[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.600]
Get out

[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.420]
All right, Bill, no need to get angry

[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:34.860]
Get out!

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:35.240]
Bill!

[00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.340]
I'm standing on a scale, my weight is off the chart

[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.560]
And I'm hungry for a snack right now

[00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.920]
If I had a half a brain, I'd try to slim it down

[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.040]
But the burger king is right, down, down

[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:10.420]
Morning, noon and night, you will find me

[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.940]
Ordering out to take home

[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.500]
It's those damn golden fries

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:24.500]
Wappers and Mac Supercise

[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.240]
Think of taking another cruise through the new drive-through

[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.220]
And now, burnt, very hard

[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.360]
Cut a thigh, high, love junk food

[00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.920]
Love junk food

[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:48.400]
I'm looking for a place, a place to stuff my face

[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.140]
The drive-to-windies is in far

[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.620]
I am just a pig, and my abdomen's a big

[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:02.220]
I am stuck here in the seat of my car

[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.460]
Morning, noon and night, you will find me

[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.960]
Ordering out to take home

[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.280]
It's those damn golden fries

[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.900]
Wappers and Mac Supercise

[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.160]
Think of taking another cruise through the new drive-through

[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.960]
And now, burnt, very hard

[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:33.460]
Cut a thigh, high, love junk food

[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:37.580]
Love junk food

[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.000]
926-560 W. Cremecillal on the morbid side

[00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.420]
Yeah, don't you think that bits a little on the morbid side?

[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:50.980]
It's a little

[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.480]
It's a little morbid, man

[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:56.240]
Anyway, we'll get to today's pool, which is very, very interesting

[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.980]
At 10 o'clock, as one will do that

[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.120]
And then we'll get into today's pool, and then tomorrow's pool

[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:05.340]
So everybody get out there, pool, and get ready for a big one

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:06.640]
Hey, here's a question for you

[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.380]
Do you need car insurance?

[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.520]
Have you gotten tickets in the past?

[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.240]

Build the cars in monocross, the china

[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:45.920]
She lets out a giggle when he makes it way go

[00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:51.940]
Monocross is not the kind you can do in the behind

[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:56.860]
But a cigar and her vagina she don't mind

[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:02.080]
Well he don't know where a stoke goes

[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.420]
I can see how there was some confusion

[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.320]
Between humidor and humid horror

[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.660]
And then I can start the term cedar box

[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:22.640]

Working on a practical joke

[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:41.880]
He took him back a noodle for an explode in

[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:47.900]
Loading for a monocross was blowing rings a smoke

[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.640]
Feel that Hillary was wrong

[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.600]
Up in the Lincoln bedroom she was moaning

But a cigar and her vagina she don't mind

[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.040]
As prosecutor for the bright

[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.080]
You're like a Nazi from the O Third Reich

[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.640]
A plittin' anus to find anything

[00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:48.320]

Don't you think you got to fight?

[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.260]
Everybody thinks you are like Joseph McCarthy

[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.760]
Did you know that Joe McCarthy was gay?

[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:11.500]
Look kinda like he can except he never paid

[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.480]
He kept right home, closed by his side

[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.300]
Until he got fired with broken dice

[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.080]
What's your problem, can he start?

[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.300]
It's too bad that we're for old scones

[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:29.260]
We would wanna take you on

[00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.770]
Like Joseph McCarthy

[00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.510]
Creep, creep, creep, creep, or

[00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.350]
Creep, creep, creep, creep, or

It's too bad, he winks through film the morning

[00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:58.310]
He's still comin' his back

[00:28:58.910 --> 00:29:03.010]
He couldn't tell the work of art from a whole morning's break

[00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:05.530]
But stuff that's wild and woolly

[00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.150]
They come on just to do it

[00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.710]
Cause Johnson used to do the job

[00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:12.690]
And he's no longer doing

[00:29:13.490 --> 00:29:17.130]

And hate his mouth to die

[00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:29.230]
He'll kick you out of business

[00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:31.590]
Cause he's a right wing guy

[00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:34.030]
He'll break your heart to business

[00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:36.570]
But first he's got to go to live

[00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.190]
Cause that's the news that's done it job

[00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:41.570]
And it gets him off to do it

[00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:45.470]
Touchin' you is a dirty job

[00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:50.390]
Touchin' you is a dirty job

[00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.110]

Touchin' you is a dirty job

[00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:07.610]

You're a good post-personal friend

[00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:05.870]
Reacon Ralph

[00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:07.470]
He says I think the 9 to 10 hours

[00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:09.170]
The greatest thing since he invented the light bulb

[00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:10.510]
It's great

[00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.870]

Snueshow he said

Well it's kind of a transition

[00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.750]
Allowed is no question about that

[00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.910]
A little more lively than some of the stuff

[00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:22.810]

That could be really ugly

[00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.570]

[00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:56.090]
We're filling up our school

[00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:58.490]
Assholes on the water

[00:34:58.490 --> 00:35:00.590]
Assholes in the sky

[00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:03.110]
Sign the system of wanting

[00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:05.550]
When the assholes need to fly

[00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:16.990]
Oh teach you what you tell me

[00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:19.370]
Am I really made to praise?

[00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:26.550]
Am I held my glass or am I just another asshole on the grave?

[00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:55.190]
Assholes get the orders

[00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.390]
And assholes grow to vote

[00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:59.710]
Assholes get elected

[00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:02.090]
Because assholes get to vote

[00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.250]
I once heard it said

[00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.990]
That old assholes never died

[00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:09.270]
They just made a bid

[00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.210]
And all we ride

[00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:13.950]
Assholes in the morning

[00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.210]
Assholes every night

[00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:17.250]
And all we ride

[00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:18.330]
Assholes to the left

[00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.830]
And assholes to the right

[00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:21.750]
The earth

[00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:22.070]
The earth

[00:36:22.070 --> 00:36:22.370]
The earth

[00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.830]
The earth

[00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.390]
The earth

[00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:27.050]
The sky

[00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:28.050]
The people

[00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:29.450]
And assholes

[00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:30.290]
On the right

[00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:50.710]
You wanted more and you got it.

[00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:55.110]
The mad dog is back singing more duet on the banded sing.

[00:36:55.110 --> 00:37:14.070]
All you do is back airing off with the great singing more pig hits with even more big stars.

[00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:16.730]
The mad dog does them all.

[00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:46.230]
All right, it's an all new British invasion.

[00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:50.190]
With the mad dog singing like a man

[00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:00.650]
The truth is finally out that you managed was truly the fifth people

[00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:42.690]
The mad dog was just a little ambivalent when we asked him if he wanted to do it again.

[00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:51.250]
So we had Luke the Broughtsy Pam a little visit and tell him either his brains or his signature would wind up on the contract.

[00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:53.390]
That's kind of a bitch's cute.

[00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:06.530]
And it's sick.

[00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.970]
About you knew available now if you move quickly.

[00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.370]
I'm exhausted.

[00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:50.610]
At least that's what my people say.

[00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:56.750]
If you have to lock around these boots all day.

[00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:02.130]
There's more to it.

[00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:06.150]
More than a nervous breakdown.

[00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:10.190]
I think there's something you should know.

[00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.810]
So here I go.

[00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:20.450]
When my dear comes along.

[00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.970]
Need the way to fill my phone.

[00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:29.030]
I just love to get so high.

[00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:32.490]
It's the cold and crack I buy.

[00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:36.550]
So when all my stash is gone.

[00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.270]
I'll be pale and won't belong.

[00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:45.150]
Straight to my hospital room.

[00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:48.490]
When my dear comes along.

[00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:04.050]
Man and girl, what she was grand.

[00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:08.690]
Wanted to be in my rock and roll band.

[00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:12.890]
She tried singing and I had to conclude.

[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:17.470]
She didn't know none of our tunes.

[00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:21.550]
She couldn't play the drums or the guitar.

[00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:25.550]
But I told her I'd find her a part.

[00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.070]
I'm zit my pants shoulder, my instruments.

[00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:34.750]
Wanted to see if she could play a few legs.

[00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.530]
She can play it made.

[00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:41.050]
Like a cousin, she can play it made.

[00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:43.390]
La la la la.

[00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.850]
She sounded so great.

[00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:49.450]
And that's how that girl became a member.

[00:41:49.450 --> 00:41:52.910]
Just home in a way.

[00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.890]
Home that instrument I found in our.

[00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.430]
After that, she took a shower.

[00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.510]
She couldn't carry a note in a bag.

[00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.690]
But what a player, the best that I've had.

[00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.690]
She can play it made.

[00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:15.990]
Like a cousin, she can play it made.

[00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.670]
La la la la.

[00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:20.970]
She sounded so great.

[00:42:21.350 --> 00:42:24.710]
And that's how that girl became a member.

[00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:27.830]
Just home in a way.

[00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:33.990]
It's stammer time.

[00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.690]
Yeah, skip down with the man who put the disc.

[00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.050]
And his functional.

[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:47.570]
M.C. stammer.

[00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.530]
It's the album that's spotted its way to the top of the charts.

[00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:53.550]
Please hammer, don't hurt yourself.

[00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:56.170]
Yes, say it.

[00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:59.550]
You get unable to touch this.

[00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:00.410]
Have you seen?

[00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.730]
Beard her.

[00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.430]
And the stammer's latest mass.

[00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.350]
You got to.

[00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.610]
But critics agree about M.C. stammer.

[00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:12.430]
Bill Boyd says, speed it out.

[00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:14.990]
M.G.V. says, that's easy for you to say.

[00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.330]
And Ebony says, say what, homie.

[00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:19.910]
All the hell.

[00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:21.790]
Please hammer, don't hurt yourself.

[00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:24.290]
Available everywhere on CD's record and tape.

[00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:25.090]
Take.

[00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:26.070]
Take.

[00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:26.190]

[00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:26.890]
Take.

[00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:31.550]
All right.

[00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.250]
Oh, we're fine.

[00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:46.130]
You call that penis?

[00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:47.010]
No.

[00:43:47.530 --> 00:43:53.330]
People are watching women are staring at their green hooves and deer.

[00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:58.210]
But I'm not sharing some say his brain lives.

[00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:59.930]
And I'm not talking.

[00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.690]
Not much to look at.

[00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:08.630]
But I ain't looking for smells just a little too much.

[00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:13.050]
To that's all a little too close.

[00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.870]
His mouth is just a little too long.

[00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:24.330]
But while they've grown in, I've built them on and done it.

[00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:27.230]
And he's got a really big travel travel.

[00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:28.130]
Yes.

[00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:36.850]
He's got a really big travel travel.

[00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:46.830]
Roy.

[00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:51.370]
That's what can make me just whisper shout.

[00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:55.330]
He's got a really big travel travel.

[00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:56.950]
Roy.

[00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:58.110]

[00:44:58.110 --> 00:44:58.110]

[00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:04.790]
He's got a really big travel travel.

[00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.470]
He's got a really big travel travel.

[00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:14.370]
He's got a really big travel travel.

[00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:16.110]
But shit, oh, no.

[00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.730]
Hi, my name is Slim Shady.

[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.350]
I know I got a lot of haters out there.

[00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:27.310]
But now it's time for me to give back to the kicker community.

[00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.230]
I got a plan to avoid war in the Middle East.

[00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:34.070]
Yo, George Bush is a dumb who's saying she just do get out on the mic.

[00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:36.150]
Like I did in my movie eight miles.

[00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:38.290]
All right, all right, first up.

[00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:39.510]
My man, she's bush.

[00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:41.290]
She's bush, throw it down.

[00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.030]
W is what they dubbed me.

[00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:44.170]
Don't be a dummy.

[00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.070]
I'm bombing you through your gas so I can fill up my humbie.

[00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.010]
Not finishing you off was the only mistake my dad had.

[00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.570]
When I'm done, Baghdad will fit in my handbag.

[00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:54.510]
Hold me, don't go.

[00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:56.110]
Go, George Bush.

[00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.130]
It's so sad for you, baby.

[00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:00.610]
Bruch in the bush, bruch in the bush in the bush.

[00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:03.370]
Bruch in the bush, bruch in the bush in the bush in the bush.

[00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:05.670]
Hello, baby, bro.

[00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:10.410]
Yeah, well, at least they drop in bombs on the mic and not on us.

[00:46:10.690 --> 00:46:12.310]
Yo, so let's get this together.

[00:46:12.590 --> 00:46:15.290]
Then maybe the world could stop blaming his problems on me.

[00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:16.890]
Tick, tick, tick, Slim Shady.

[00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:19.090]
Now, 56, 56, that would have been a good no-way.

[00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:20.990]
Can I ask you, are you getting the tax credit for your SUV?

[00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:23.370]
No, but Ayada.

[00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:24.230]
Well, there you go.

[00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:25.690]
I use it for my business.

[00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.770]
Exactly. And a lot of monkey business, too, when you're a trained monkey.

[00:46:29.130 --> 00:46:31.930]
Anyway, that's our nine to ten hour just, I don't know, flies by.

[00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.690]
Now, I've got two faxes, a couple of them they like it,

[00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:36.290]
and then we got somebody who hates it.

[00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:38.330]
But we'll get to her momentarily.

[00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:40.610]
And the 10 o'clock hour, once we get into the real show.

[00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:41.450]
Is it over already?

[00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:42.610]
It's over already.

[00:46:42.830 --> 00:46:43.050]
Aw.

[00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.410]
I'll tell you what else is over the holidays.

[00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:48.030]
No more Christmas, no more Chanukah, no more New Year's.

[00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:50.890]
Kids are back in school, and a lot of you have gotten as fat as...

[00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:50.910]
Ow.

[00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:51.690]
Ow.

[00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:54.890]
A couple with the humidity and suffer of the weight gain is unbearable,

[00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.010]
especially, you know, a couple of months when it starts getting really hot.

[00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.190]
And you start sweating all over the place, and you can't even get up and walk.

[00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.970]
It's time to treat yourself, lose weight, and get healthy again.

[00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:04.970]
Balance for life is the way to do it.

[00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.150]
And of course, look at the beast.

[00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:09.090]
The beast is looking almost human now, and now it's your turn,

[00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:10.610]
almost being the operative word.

[00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:11.670]
He's getting there.

[00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:13.870]
Of course, some of the way did go into his head.

[00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.850]
Don't forget no cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries, no calorie,

[00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:18.010]
or recounting no carb counting.

[00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.730]
It's simple.

[00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:22.430]
Balance for life combines the knowledge of the zone diet, which is mighty complicated,

[00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:25.550]
with special emphasis on the glycemic values of carbohydrates,

[00:47:26.010 --> 00:47:27.170]
which controls your sugar levels.

[00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:29.650]
And they deliver right to your door at your home, at your office,

[00:47:29.850 --> 00:47:32.510]
where we are by 6 o'clock every morning, a little black sack.

[00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:36.530]
And your very important black sack, are three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks,

[00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.690]
and there they are, all the food you need for the whole day.

[00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:40.350]
And believe you me, you'll never go hungry.

[00:47:40.350 --> 00:47:42.250]
Everything is made with the freshest, the finest ingredients,

[00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.270]
and you get to pick between two choices for each meal every day that you're on the program.

[00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:49.590]
Try it for at least a week or two, because believe me, once you start eating this great food,

[00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.470]
you realize how easy, convenient, and simple it is to really lose weight,

[00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:56.330]
the effective, safe, delicious way with balance for life, not some kind of quackery,

[00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:01.350]
not some kind of magic potion, and certainly not some kind of frozen-their-pre-fat foods in a box.

[00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.410]
Let balance for life help you lose that weight and get back to good health again.

[00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:05.330]
I look a lot better too.

[00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.890]
Call them today, 9-5-4-568-3-2-29.

[00:48:09.370 --> 00:48:16.250]
9-5-4-568-3-2-29, or check them out on the web if you like it.

[00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:21.410]
Here's 4-2-5-6-6-8-2-A-M.

[00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:23.530]
Look over here.

[00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:24.070]
Oh, man.

[00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:27.510]
This is a very good thing, because you know, sell them three by four, you know,

[00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:28.530]
and then you'll know that they're no longer the same way.

[00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.450]
I can't afford it.

[00:48:29.610 --> 00:48:29.610]

[00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:31.270]
I tell you, man, I'll do a crazy.

[00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:32.650]
We sell them right, we sell them.

[00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:33.290]
We sell them right, we sell them.

[00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.690]
I didn't do nothing.

[00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.170]
I bought them a knife, but I didn't do nothing.

[00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:37.110]
I'm so, so, I'm going to tell you, we sell them right, we sell them right, we sell them.

[00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:39.870]
You know, when they call them, we sell them.

[00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:41.150]
You know, bubbles are the same way.

[00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:42.210]
You know, bubbles are the same way.

[00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:42.970]
I didn't do nothing.

[00:48:42.970 --> 00:48:45.330]
So, what am I to do with that, you know, you have to say, man,

[00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.650]
I want to make sure you don't talk to me, you know, I don't do nothing.

[00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.810]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:49.150]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.050]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:54.890]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:56.470]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:56.690]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:56.810]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:57.550]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.190]

[00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.190]

[00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.190]

[00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.670]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:00.230]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:00.670]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:01.430]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.890]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:02.890 --> 00:49:03.710]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:04.490]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.310]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.430]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:06.450 --> 00:49:06.950]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.450]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:13.590]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:18.730]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:19.530]
I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:19.690]

[00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:19.690]

[00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:20.670]
I'll show you why I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.290]
I'll show you why I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.850]
I'll show you why I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:25.590]
I'll show you why I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:25.770]
I'll show you why I'm not doing nothing.

[00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:25.770]

[00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:28.250]
Big breath That's funny What's going on?

[00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.150]
So anyway, just never stops with him, doesn't he?

[00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:34.390]
And I would explain to him, I'm thinking to myself,

[00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:36.250]
god, have we played that a million times before?

[00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:37.030]
It's not.

[00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.150]
It's just like that, didn't it?

[00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:39.110]
It's just like that, didn't it?

[00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:39.350]
Little bit.

[00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:45.430]
sure did a little bit. Oh man. I thought that's it verbatim. Anyway, O.J. Simpson,

[00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:49.790]
teenage daughter, placed a tearful 9-11 call after a quarrel with her famous father this month,

[00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:54.510]
complaining about her father's attitude and asking if a constitutive abuse had died County police.

[00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:59.270]
Sydney Simpson's 17-fold police from the Kendall Homes she shares with their father

[00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:09.330]
and 14-year-old brother at 11.30am, January 18, according to a one-page incident report. Now,

[00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:13.990]
in the brief and often unintelligible 9-11 call, Sydney 17, an honor student,

[00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:17.650]
got over prepencural gables, sobbed while describing her father as an unloving

[00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:23.330]
and the hero just says, A, blank blank, like, asshole. She says she no longer wanted to live with them.

[00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:28.290]
How come they can't put asshole on a hero? They're afraid I might reflect poorly on them.

[00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:32.150]
They're afraid that if they looked in the mirror, some of those people over there, they might see one.

[00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:35.970]
She later said her father told her none of his kids make him miserable except for me.

[00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:40.430]
She asked the dispatcher if that's not like an abuse thing. She did not ask for police

[00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:44.450]
help said they'd police. But when the call abruptly ended, police following department policy

[00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:48.630]
regarding interrupted emergency calls said officers to the Simpson home for how many times we

[00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:53.610]
don't know we can't count. According to the incident report, police found Sydney in her bedroom upset.

[00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:59.270]
When you get upset, the police come to your house? Well, me.

[00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:04.670]
The team then told officers that she and Simpson got into an argument over family issues.

[00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:10.010]
After she calmed down, Sydney agreed to leave the residence to defuse the situation and return later,

[00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:15.270]
said the report. Police did not report any signs of violence. No charges were filed. It was unclear

[00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:20.570]
if the report, if Simpson was inside the home. Simpson had turned the yellow galanter. Yanta told the

[00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:24.210]
AP on Wednesday that his client was listed on the report. Only because he's the homeowner, not

[00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:28.890]
because he was present, necessarily. There was nothing that occurred, but I do know as Mr. Simpson

[00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:33.690]
wasn't there, he said. Sydney and a younger brother, Justin, are Simpson's children, the slain ex-wife,

[00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:41.110]
Nicole Brown Simpson. You know the one that he's still looking for the murderer? Simpson was

[00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:45.290]
acquitted of the murders of his Emma. We know that. He continued to make headlines after moving to

[00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:50.150]
date. Counties successfully beating a road rage rap in October 2001. Two months later, he was again

[00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:54.330]
at the center of controversy when federal agents served a search warrant and his candle home looking

[00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:57.870]
for evidence relating to an alleged drug ring, money laundering and a stool and satellite equipment.

[00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:03.510]
The former NFL superstar was not charged with any crime underline that the former NFL superstar

[00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:07.250]
because at this station that makes a lot of difference. And in November, he once again made

[00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:12.590]
courthouse chatter. Simpson paid a $130 fine for speeding through a manatee zone in a powerboat.

[00:52:13.070 --> 00:52:17.470]
How did we miss that one? Did we miss that or did we have it? No, we just glossed over it.

[00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:21.210]
Yeah, it's not better to get with it, Mr. O. He's small potatoes now. It's right, but he is a

[00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:26.890]
former NFL superstar. I forget about that. How can I? Here's the result to yesterday's pool.

[00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:31.050]
Now isn't it amazing? What percent do I always tell you we have a bush-luckers? I mean, right

[00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:35.470]
way. I mean, conservatives out there in this audience. 18. Little over 18%. We asked yesterday,

[00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:43.490]
the president's state of the union speech was and we had 1,357 votes. Didn't watch it 436 of us

[00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:48.890]
said that, including me, 32.1%. Why bother? Were there any surprises? Did we get exactly what we

[00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:53.230]
knew we were going to get? Evidently. From what I'm hearing, the usual bull-crush myth they all

[00:52:53.230 --> 00:53:02.130]
do, 368, 27.1%. It was outstanding, 250, 18.4%. How do you like that?

[00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:09.590]
Thank you, Blake. This debt's consistent number, man. Pathetic, 145. Okay, 103 people said.

[00:53:09.850 --> 00:53:17.070]
Okay. And 55 said it was weak out of 13.57. I don't know where to start because we got the

[00:53:17.070 --> 00:53:21.650]
CBS News Sex Survey, which is going to lead into our pool today about how your pool is doing.

[00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:27.270]
But before that, here's a couple of facts. Here's one that says, Neil, I've listened to you

[00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.890]
show for many years now and next week, I'll be leaving you a barc on a new career in the

[00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:34.350]
trucking industry. Well, good luck to you, Joe. You old trucker. Just wanted to say a thing

[00:53:34.350 --> 00:53:38.510]
or two before I left. You're not going to like this. Oh. And regard to the pool about Georgia,

[00:53:38.510 --> 00:53:42.210]
today, something was left out of my opinion. I think George does a fine job when you're not there,

[00:53:42.210 --> 00:53:46.030]
although he does a needle-dune, you're type showing instead of his own stick. Hey, stick to your own

[00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:52.370]
stick. Please. But he's often informative and opinionated with suits, suits his style. The thing

[00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:57.450]
he does, which is annoying, though, is makes smacking and slurping noises on the ear. A technique

[00:53:57.450 --> 00:54:01.830]
he obviously learned from Mr. Ego, aka, what's his name? I'm not talking about the kind of noises

[00:54:01.830 --> 00:54:05.390]
you make when you're cozzling down food into the mic. I love the way he spelled that, by the way.

[00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:09.610]
Very good, Joe. I'm talking about smacking his lips and swallowing. They does constantly throughout

[00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:15.910]
his show. Stop swallowing, will you? He blames it on flim from allergies or something similar to

[00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:19.610]
that. But the obvious question is, why doesn't he go to a doctor and do something about it?

[00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:26.690]
A radio personality, a radio personality that doesn't speak clearly and succinctly is akin to a

[00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:34.570]
surgeon with Parkinson's disease. Tell him to take whatever he has in his mouth out and enjoy it

[00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:39.830]
after the show. Take whatever you have in your mouth out and enjoy it after the show it says.

[00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:44.870]
Another thing is something he once said about hockey being, well, I'm not going to debate that,

[00:54:44.970 --> 00:54:48.850]
because your comments here are so ass-in-eye. Do you know that many football players could

[00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.670]
survive an 80-game season with a ball on their right? They would kill most human beings,

[00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:56.390]
trying to say that because they only play 16 games in the hockey's about 80, which they play

[00:54:56.390 --> 00:55:01.030]
82, but therefore football is much tougher than just ask a German and she says, no, no thanks.

[00:55:02.090 --> 00:55:05.330]
See, football, they play offense, they play defense, they don't play both.

[00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:10.390]
Hockey, they go out there and they skate like a son of a bitch and then they go back to the bench

[00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.890]
for a couple of minutes. They come back out there and do it all over again and it goes on non-stop.

[00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:18.630]
Not with these long, long pauses where they run one play, then they go back to the huddle,

[00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:23.330]
they hold hands with each other, they go, you know, okay, and then they, the quarterback claps

[00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:27.570]
and they all clap and they all got to clap. I mean, come on, Joe, don't be a silly person. Will you please?

[00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:32.750]
And as far as conditioned athletes are concerned, do you think that any of those big fat tubs or

[00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:37.170]
crap who are supposedly athletes, the linemen and the NFL that they could play hockey or any other

[00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:41.910]
real sport get out of here? Crazy person, Joe. But anyway, it says, take care and we'll see you on

[00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:45.410]
XM radio. I don't think so, Joe. Look at it like that. And thanks for taking the time to send us

[00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:50.010]
all the straight facts now. Although, that doesn't have anything to do with the 90 to 10 hour.

[00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:54.870]
So we have like one each. Now, we're going to take a pull on it eventually, but certainly not tomorrow.

[00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:58.710]
It's not soon enough, right? Right. Maybe next weekend, next Friday, two to weekend.

[00:55:59.610 --> 00:56:03.650]
I think they had a week to digest it and spit it out like you had it with that cough drop if I was

[00:56:03.650 --> 00:56:08.570]
you. Spit it out. Enjoy it after the show. When it's like, kind of, here's Cheryl, who's a chronic

[00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:12.610]
factor who says, for the first time since I started listening to you, I find myself clicking

[00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:17.050]
through the channels, yuck. I enjoy the bits, but only when they're scattered throughout your show.

[00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:23.210]
Scattered. Scattered. The choices out there are awful. You have Howard Borristern, the home team,

[00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:26.970]
which is a former stripper, teamed up with a little guy with a Napoleon complex, not for me.

[00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:30.830]
Bob and Tom, I'm going to listen to a continuous lap track loop. They think they're way more

[00:56:30.830 --> 00:56:35.930]
funny than they are. Of course, on the A&M, don't you have your right wing wackos? I love Bob and Tom.

[00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:41.450]
And I think they're just as funny as they think they are. Anyway, she says, my vote is for you to go

[00:56:41.450 --> 00:56:46.790]
back. Wait until you hear this. And this fits right in, see? My vote is for you to go back to the

[00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:50.810]
bedtime stories, interspersed with vets is fine. Thanks for being there for our entertainment.

[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:58.690]
A big fan, Cheryl. How do you like that? Go back to the bedtime stories.

[00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:02.490]
No. Hey, I hate to break the news to you, sweetheart. That isn't going to happen.

[00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:06.870]
Let me tell you how many chances there are of that happening. How many?

[00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:12.890]
On a scale of five trillion. None. The big. Then ain't going to happen, sweetheart.

[00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:17.510]
We can't afford to have demographics 90 plus. Okay. And I don't want to knock you because you're

[00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:20.950]
interested in what's going on in the world. Go to our website, neo-rangers.com. You'll see a lot

[00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:25.350]
of fantastic stories on there, which I would waste the time and take the time to sit here and read

[00:57:25.350 --> 00:57:28.930]
on the air located for months and months and months. But the fact of the matter is most people are

[00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:33.550]
out there. That's not what they want. And if you're like, you know, you got an Italian restaurant,

[00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:40.130]
you don't serve steak. Am I right? Right. You don't serve french fries and an Italian restaurant.

[00:57:41.410 --> 00:57:46.490]
You don't serve sushi and an Italian restaurant. And on this Italian restaurant, we serve mostly

[00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:51.110]
entertainment, Cheryl. So lighten up just a little bit. And if you don't like the 90 to an hour,

[00:57:51.130 --> 00:57:54.670]
maybe you'll have some company. We don't know yet. It's too early. It's in its infancy. We're going

[00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:57.630]
to check with the Ray-Lions. We'll hold the press conference and see what they say about it.

[00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:02.830]
I mean, can you believe that they actually went through that thing with a dog and pony show with a

[00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:07.950]
judge in court who finally throws up his arms in there. Oh, well, you know, we have no jurisdiction.

[00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:16.170]
And there's probably no baby anyway. Adi, Adi, Adi. Oh, no, Schmidt. Now they said one of the babies

[00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:20.050]
is in Israel. Do you see that? No, I didn't. I don't know if he's circummisspect or not.

[00:58:20.530 --> 00:58:25.010]
10 past 10 at 560 WQM. It's a great Thursday here at the home of hysteria. And believe me,

[00:58:25.110 --> 00:58:28.490]
this place really is. Where's that new copy that Skippy was going to bring me in here?

[00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:32.810]
Skippy that brought in our new sales guy, but I knew guy. It seems like a nice guy. He has no

[00:58:32.810 --> 00:58:37.890]
idea what he's into, you know. He has no clue. They never do. And Bill Mullin works over there and

[00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:44.610]
they, oh my god. Can that be the same Bill Mullin that we used to work with at IOD? The way to?

[00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:47.330]
Oh, no. He's an asshole. That can't be the same one. And what do he

[00:58:47.330 --> 00:58:52.390]
has in dark and dark or yet? Because if it were, I mean, when you work with somebody for years,

[00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:56.390]
and then they come and work on another station in the same place, wouldn't you think just out of

[00:58:56.390 --> 00:59:00.570]
common courtesy? They would come in unless, of course, he doesn't like us. He probably just

[00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:04.810]
doesn't like you is what it is. I'm sure he likes me a lot. Right. I love it after 10 at 5,

[00:59:04.830 --> 00:59:08.670]
60 WQM. We all have different lifestyles, Mr. Mullin. Therefore, you need different products to

My, I love this is sports radio by city.

[01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:26.370]
Got two sets of lips. Hey young man. Listen, I've seen you hanging around my house and I

[01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:30.230]
have something I want to talk to you about. Listen here now. I'm going to put it this way.

[01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:36.610]
Wasn't you who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion. Put prints on the dashboard

[01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:43.370]
upside down. Hey, what? Who wasn't you? You Braco Bill been messing with my daughter Jill.

[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:47.030]
If it was you'd better leave this town. Well, yeah.

[01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:55.010]
Yes, was I who did the push and put the stains upon the cushion. Put prints on the dashboard upside down.

[01:00:55.090 --> 01:01:02.090]
Yeah. Yeah. But since I'm missing with your daughter, I've had trouble passing water so I guess we're

[01:01:02.090 --> 01:01:07.770]
even all around. Why you come over here? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:16.350]
That's 17. But I haven't played that in water about 400 years. I love that.

[01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:20.750]
And even sounds better than I thought it did. I thought it was a little on the money side, a little

[01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:25.390]
mushy. Anyway, here's the fact from Bill who says what's up with Jill Rosen is spots.

[01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:29.430]
It sounds like he's re-recorded all of his commercials, but now he's speaking as though he's

[01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.990]
actually talking to adults, no high-pitched screaming, no sport-whole yelling and panting and

[01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:38.610]
sounding like he's running toward the end zone as he reads the unbelievably lame copy. Did he finally

[01:01:38.610 --> 01:01:43.150]
realize how retarded he sounded? Now, I thought as soon as I saw the first couple of words in his

[01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:47.030]
facts that it was going to be about Joe Stumbling and Fumbling in at last spot that we played

[01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:52.390]
this moment ago. And the fact that he didn't edit it or he didn't redo it, you know what I'm saying?

[01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:57.790]
I thought that's what it was going to be. Bill also says, by the way, I heard somebody say

[01:01:57.790 --> 01:02:02.090]
Oli-Okin in Demo and he thought it was a breakfast commentant, condiment, condiment.

[01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:08.410]
Very cute Bill, just get it straightened out, went it down. Anyway, CBS News has got this sex

[01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:13.350]
survey, are you average? With Valentine's Day right around the corner of the thoughts of some of

[01:02:13.350 --> 01:02:17.130]
us, our team, the chocolate champion, what's so with Carlos, by the way? Is he out needing chocolate?

[01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:21.470]
So, no, maybe he's having a smoke. I'm sure it's got to be along. What's he doing, smoking a whole

[01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:25.790]
pack? Just let the whole thing on fire? Well, he's got to do cigarette for play first.

[01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:31.250]
I see. What's with where's he sticking at? With Valentine's Day right around the corner,

[01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:34.850]
the thoughts of some of us are turning to chocolate, champagne, and sex. The reason I say that

[01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:38.830]
is because I'm sure that Carlos probably isn't thinking of any of those. He's washing the dishes.

[01:02:39.610 --> 01:02:43.690]
He's taking a bath on the sink with Mulligan. Maybe he liked it the first time. But the average

[01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:48.990]
American ready to turn up the heat in the bedroom is the is it? February 14th, that's the question.

[01:02:49.410 --> 01:02:54.330]
The folks at sexualwellbeing.com decided to find out, conducted a national survey that asked

[01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:58.450]
about their sex life. Their sexual styles, the sexual styles of their mates and far more.

[01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:05.370]
Dr. Sandra Scatling, who is probably scantily clad, a licensed sex therapist visited the early

[01:03:05.370 --> 01:03:09.450]
show on CBS to talk about the results. You know, the CBS early show that nobody watches, that's the one.

[01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:14.530]
Americans appear obsessed with sexuality, be it movies advertising on the fashion runways.

[01:03:14.890 --> 01:03:19.490]
However, overall Scatling says Americans are relatively tame in the bedroom and give themselves

[01:03:19.490 --> 01:03:23.870]
a great of C in their sexual prowess according to the survey. They rate themselves as only average

[01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:29.610]
lovers giving themselves an average of seven on a scale of one to ten. Scatling says Americans

[01:03:29.610 --> 01:03:33.350]
rate themselves average in bed because they may be comparing themselves to pop culture icons

[01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:38.870]
that portray unrealistic images. She says the images of sexually happy, a celebrity sets us up for failure.

[01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:43.330]
Scatling says we have to appreciate who we are, what our lives are, and what our desires are.

[01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.090]
She says we should not compare ourselves to what we think we should be. So I'll get to the rest

[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:51.030]
of that. But here is the poll today based on that. Ready? Ready.

[01:03:52.790 --> 01:03:55.790]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life?

[01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:04.450]
And I've got let's see 369 excellent choices here. Something of the past, sensational.

[01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:12.810]
Okay. Okay. Could be better. Could be a lot better. I'm desperate, weak,

[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:17.970]
solo or non-existent. I think I covered everywhere from

[01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:25.390]
the night. What about I don't care anymore. We don't want to talk to those people.

[01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:29.490]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life? Something of the past which I think

[01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.270]
covers what you just said. Although it's generally geared through the

[01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:37.230]
older set who can't remember how to do it or what was all about just bigly. We're it went.

[01:04:37.890 --> 01:04:42.950]
Something of the past sensational. Okay. Could be better. Could be a lot better. I'm desperate,

[01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:53.010]
weak, weak, solo or non-existent. What's the weak thing mean? Just like as compared to the other ones.

[01:04:56.110 --> 01:04:59.710]
I have to draw you a diaphragm which seems like that's the same as one of the other entries.

[01:04:59.870 --> 01:05:05.570]
Which one? Could be better. No. Okay. Could be better. It doesn't mean it's necessarily all that bad.

[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:12.930]
But there's room for us to agree. Weak. Weak is like lazy. Lame. In other words, maybe they're getting

[01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:20.630]
away 600 pounds. Pudged up a little bit and smells real bad. And spends a lot of time in the

[01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:26.950]
produce department of publics. Yeah, things like that. Do you follow what I'm saying? Weak, in fact, you're

[01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:35.330]
right. You're asking me. Weak. Anyway, so that's our, some people presume a lot. I don't presume

[01:05:35.330 --> 01:05:38.750]
anything. I don't know what you're getting on the side. When Americans were asked to describe

[01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:44.510]
their sexual style, 85% key positive answer. They described sex as romantic and loving 37%,

[01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:51.310]
attentive in patient 26%, while the adventurous 22%, scantling says only 15% describe themselves

[01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:56.770]
as predictable and boring. When asked to describe their personal sexual styles versus those of

[01:05:56.770 --> 01:06:00.550]
their partner, respondents rated themselves more favorably than their partners, describing

[01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:04.970]
themselves as romantic and loving while more than a quarter rated their partners as predictable

[01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:09.970]
and boring. How do you like that? Like Carlos? He's predictable and boring. Just came waddling back

[01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:15.030]
in and again, probably was out there smoking 5, 10, 15, 20 of faggots. There goes that 25 bucks we gave

[01:06:15.030 --> 01:06:21.590]
to the other day. How about it's all gone by now, isn't it? Long gone. Long gone, man. How much for

[01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:30.010]
a carton now? About 30 bucks? 20 bucks. 25 bucks. Which is what he got? 25 bucks for a carton of

[01:06:30.010 --> 01:06:34.570]
faggot and that's what you got with the 25 bucks we gave you. You ought to be shocked. What else

[01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:42.010]
wrong with you? I could have used that 20 bucks of the track last night. And by the way, I didn't

[01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:46.490]
want to go to the track last night. I don't want to start playing butch boss with fat, rich,

[01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:50.090]
and direct, but I don't want to go to the track last night. It's kind of like while I'm here in town,

[01:06:50.090 --> 01:06:53.730]
I have to be babysitter for some people. I don't want to be anybody's babysitter. I don't like

[01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:58.150]
Wednesdays. There's very little cybercasting of all the nights. I had no interest in being there.

[01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:02.590]
You follow what I'm saying? Have you ever been in a situation where you've been some place

[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:06.890]
that you really didn't want to be? Like here for example right now. We're thinking about that.

[01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:11.970]
But last night I wind myself up being talked in which it doesn't look like with food. It doesn't

[01:07:11.970 --> 01:07:16.550]
take a lot to talk me into it. And I'm there and I'm like not having a good time at all. You know,

[01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:20.630]
for the honor of watching Rich and his nephew who's becoming rapidly addicted to gambling and

[01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:24.150]
going to sooner or later probably hopefully sooner learn that it's a fool in his money or soon

[01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:30.450]
parted. See there's this gigantic hose that they put through the window at the track.

[01:07:31.350 --> 01:07:34.170]
And what you read what they really would like you to do is take all your money and throw it up

[01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:38.510]
into the air and the hose and what's the race starts like a gigantic vacuum cleaner and you watch

[01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:43.890]
all the money getting sucked out. You see? And you just never see it again. Now I mean some people

[01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:46.690]
once in a while, but I should take it. We always have a great time. Don't get me wrong.

[01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.690]
But I didn't want to be there. I thought I was saying if I would have won money last night,

[01:07:52.690 --> 01:07:58.390]
I didn't want to be there. But I'm weak. I'm weak. I'm easily, people lay guilt trips on me. Well,

[01:07:58.450 --> 01:08:01.430]
you know, you're only here for a short time and you've got to be there to hold fat Rich's hand.

[01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:05.730]
No, I don't want to be there to hold fat Rich's. In fact, I don't want to be anywhere holding fat Rich's hand.

[01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:12.210]
See what I'm saying? Maybe side by side hurdles? No. People are like laying all these things out

[01:08:12.210 --> 01:08:18.190]
in too much responsibility. The survey indicates it may be a time for some to spice up,

[01:08:18.290 --> 01:08:21.530]
married sex. Married people are more likely to describe their partner's sexual style as

[01:08:21.530 --> 01:08:26.810]
predictable and boring 32% and less likely to use wild and adventurous as a sexual moniker, only 13%.

[01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:31.530]
Scantling says she thinks people see themselves more creative than their partners. Well, of course,

[01:08:32.070 --> 01:08:36.130]
just like people looking at me are like clearance there and things he's a sex pot and he still can't get laid.

[01:08:36.730 --> 01:08:40.330]
But not interesting how he just happened to open the door at that moment. What do you open the door for?

[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:44.770]
Doesn't he know what's going on here in this hour? Maybe he was looking for somebody. I think he was looking for somebody.

[01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:50.630]
Like I just said, he can't get laid there. Well, maybe he heard that's bit with Carlos and Moe yesterday.

[01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:57.070]
Maybe he's looking for you, Carlos. Probably has a dollar. Maybe. Maybe you've got two dollars.

[01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.850]
And when you're married and sleeping with the same person you're in and you're around

[01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:05.930]
chances are things can get a bit boring. It says here, George. So what do you do then?

[01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:09.550]
Besides go to the swing clubs and get your wife drunk and try to drag her along too.

[01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:15.090]
Scantling says you can add some spice by trying something new, going out on a limb and tasting something

[01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:19.230]
different with more flavors for your partner. What the hell is that talking about? This is on

[01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:24.810]
CBSNews.com. Tasting something different for more flavors with your partner. That's a great idea.

[01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:30.670]
Go taste something different. Rack them. Oh! Scantling says she isn't advocating anything outrageous,

[01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:37.450]
but she does say to experiment a little. She advises couples to go to a little outside,

[01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:40.930]
their realm of comfort because one thing's good, things get comfortable and get really boring.

[01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:45.170]
And that's what you got to stop, she says. In fact, you know something? I think I got the answer

[01:09:45.170 --> 01:09:53.170]
right in here. Oh no. It's not. It is. Oh my god. Big black number. I just dropped all my cramp

[01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:57.650]
on the floor. That's a really bad. Yeah. I just dropped the... wait a minute.

[01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:13.130]
I just dropped all my cramp on the floor. I was whipping out the big black thing named

[01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:20.430]
this is the one that got the be-so excited the other day. Take a look at that thing. Is that dangerous or what?

[01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:23.450]
So you got to try something a little bit different. Don't get boring. Don't get predictable.

[01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:28.530]
Is what it says here. You know, they always say the same cramp. In other words, go out,

[01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:33.290]
get a little strange on the side. Find somebody really hot, you know. How come you're like

[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.750]
spinning your head around a little bit? How was your realm of last night, by the way,

[01:10:36.750 --> 01:10:40.110]
speaking of that? Anybody? You know, real boring and nothing happened. I see.

[01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:47.950]
Yeah. Likely story. Can't imagine who might be listening to the show today. Those tickets sure were popular

[01:10:47.950 --> 01:10:51.950]
though. Not. No, they were actually. Did you actually give them away? Yeah. All of them.

[01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:57.150]
You gave away all the tickets. Everybody gave us. Really stiff. I mean, great costume up there and

[01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:02.610]
pop me to that awful place where you get pneumonia. Right. Oh, better than me. So that's good.

[01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:06.190]
People like stuff free. They don't care how crappy it is. And who's going to be there? Your white snake

[01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:10.010]
and who else? Scorpions. The white snake will be talking with the scorpions.

[01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:14.970]
Doc and I'll be dead. I remember dockin. You do? Yes. Matter of fact, I don't. Yeah.

[01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:20.230]
I'm kidding. Get with it. Stiff. They sucked. Anyway, would you like to take that

[01:11:20.230 --> 01:11:22.570]
out of your mouth right now and enjoy it after the show? Take what?

[01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:27.570]

And like a jungle love leotard whatever had you call that thing. What do you call it?

[01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:12.510]
A leopard skin. A leopard skin. Loin cloth? Not a loin cloth. A loin cloth. You must have a long

[01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:16.550]
loin. I'll tell you that. Vermont teddy bear even has got an officially licensed love meat tender

[01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:28.330]
Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don

[01:13:58.050 --> 01:13:58.310]
Don't 27 have a

[01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.850]
You're the most fool.

[01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.390]
No!

[01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:03.490]
And I would not be ashamed

[01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:07.690]
About a ginger and more gay union

[01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:11.550]
Just born and been stroking away

[01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:16.050]
Boy, make Kelly your not my type

[01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:17.170]
Yeah!

[01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:20.290]
You sound like a nine year old kid

[01:14:20.290 --> 01:14:20.730]
Hey!

[01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.930]
Only a macho-melly guy

[01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:25.190]
You don't know this!

[01:14:25.190 --> 01:14:27.890]
That makes me flip my wig

[01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:31.870]
If ginger was a lover of mine

[01:14:32.930 --> 01:14:35.890]
I'd bury my boldest feigny nose

[01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:39.430]
Inside his hip bleirin'

[01:14:40.290 --> 01:14:41.130]
Ratham!

[01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.770]
No, I would not be a sport-old

[01:14:44.770 --> 01:14:48.410]
If I was not a closet of fame

[01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:52.470]
That's why a ginger and more gay union

[01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:56.230]
Would make me feel to be a gay

[01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:59.130]
Everybody follow my thousand balls

[01:14:59.130 --> 01:15:02.130]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union

[01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:06.150]
Would make my swirl pony ass feel safe

[01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:10.470]
If we had a ginger and more gay union

[01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:13.610]
Then he wouldn't have to get me raped

[01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:14.790]
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

[01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:17.570]
10.34.5.60 W.M. Happy Thursday, too

[01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:20.210]
Got a bunch of votes on there already

[01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.470]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life?

[01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:24.170]
We got the 58 votes

[01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:26.110]
Pulled this one up only seconds ago

[01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:27.650]
Sensational 11!

[01:15:28.670 --> 01:15:30.890]
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! I know who didn't vote on that pool

[01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:33.130]
Could be a lot better, 11

[01:15:33.130 --> 01:15:34.350]
Could be better, 8

[01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:36.070]
Something of the past, 8

[01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:37.910]
Okay, 7

[01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:39.590]
Solo, 6

[01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:41.470]
Non-existent 4

[01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.570]
On desperate 2 and week 1

[01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:45.970]
So you thought we couldn't get any

[01:15:45.970 --> 01:15:47.090]
1

[01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.330]
Said it's pretty weak

[01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:50.590]
So it's kinda like...

[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:51.410]
Like that

[01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.970]
Limp

[01:15:51.970 --> 01:15:53.810]
Been over like a...

[01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:54.650]
Curly-cue

[01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:55.970]
They have pills for that now

[01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:58.590]
7 and 10 Americans have been having fantasies

[01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:02.670]
68% of women, 71% of men ranging from swinging with other couples

[01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:05.290]
Having sex in public places like out here on the street corner

[01:16:05.290 --> 01:16:06.350]
And in role playing

[01:16:06.350 --> 01:16:07.990]
Ho-ho-ho!

[01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.410]
You know, like kind of dressing up getting on the internet and pretending to be

[01:16:10.410 --> 01:16:11.050]
Griseldah

[01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:12.030]
Little bo-peepin Hitler

[01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:15.110]
However, 30% say they're not fantasizing at all

[01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.770]
See how right

[01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:16.030]
Ha!

[01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:20.250]
Scanling says many Americans don't see themselves wanting to be naughty or risky

[01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:22.730]
She says if you broaden your definition of fantasy

[01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:25.530]
It doesn't have to be out about swinging or having sex in public places

[01:16:25.530 --> 01:16:27.410]
Chances are you'll be able to accept it more

[01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:30.770]
Again having mild fantasies doesn't necessarily mean that you're naughty

[01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:33.650]
Scanling says it just means opening your...

[01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:37.510]
Mind up to new things and allowing yourself to be a bit more mentally free

[01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.110]
So open up your...

[01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.430]
Mind

[01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.310]
First start, rhymes with B

[01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.930]
Backed them

[01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:47.850]
Despite stereotypes men are more likely 62 to 56% than women

[01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:52.230]
To describe a good sexual experience as one that ends in laying in each other's arms

[01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.570]
Ah...

[01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:54.470]
Isn't it sweet?

[01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:55.130]
Ha!

[01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:56.190]
Ha! Ha! Ha!

[01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.370]
Scanling says there are tons of sensitive men

[01:16:58.370 --> 01:17:01.990]
She explains that all of these sensitive men who have had this macho idea

[01:17:01.990 --> 01:17:04.210]
Part of their heads think it's bad to be sensitive

[01:17:04.210 --> 01:17:08.930]
No women, she says all of these sensitive men have had this macho ideal

[01:17:08.930 --> 01:17:11.110]
Pounded other heads and they think it's bad to be sensitive

[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:15.110]
Like Miguel for example, there's a good example

[01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:16.930]
WAM Bam and you know...

[01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:18.590]
He's just got them lined up

[01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:19.670]
That's why his mattress is...

[01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:20.910]
He needs a new mattress by the way

[01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.490]
She explains that it's tough for men to want to be physically intimate without sex

[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:28.810]
She says it's about talking more communicating more and being open about your feelings with your partner

[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.450]
So you can both get everything you want

[01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:35.990]
Well if you're both going to get everything you want probably there are other people lined up at the door

[01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:37.430]
and you're ready to come in after the conversation

[01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:40.850]
If it's going to be your thing that you want, of course in your case

[01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:44.070]
When I asked what would improve their sex lives besides maybe a different partner

[01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:47.950]
Americans volunteered that they think a better body 37% would do it

[01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:48.730]
Yeah I think so

[01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:51.050]
How about we put like...

[01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.990]
I got an idea

[01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:55.650]
Call up the cloney the Raylion people

[01:17:56.190 --> 01:17:59.070]
And what we're going to do is like we're going to put my brain and heart

[01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:00.670]
Now maybe not my heart either, it's pretty old

[01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:03.130]
It's like brain into Miguel's body

[01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:05.310]
I'm going to swap brains with Miguel

[01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:09.870]
So we can be like no even be a great talk show host and I can look like you for a couple of weeks

[01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:11.910]
Huh? What would be wrong with that?

[01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.730]
I think a better body would help me a lot

[01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:17.190]
That's what Carlos said get out of here

[01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:20.890]
Go see Mulligan okay maybe he'll serve as you again and it'll happen to you sink

[01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.510]
More leisure time 29% said would help their sex life

[01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:26.650]
A better bedroom atmosphere 18%

[01:18:26.650 --> 01:18:30.410]
And more sexual knowledge slash know how 17% would be beneficial

[01:18:31.190 --> 01:18:37.350]
Scanling says it's a myth that if we have a fabulous J-Lo body in other words a big fat sex will be better

[01:18:37.350 --> 01:18:39.730]
She says beauty does not equate to great sex

[01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:43.690]
That's for an answer because if it did a lot of us would be out of luck as well

[01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:48.530]
Yeah, I'm not looking at anybody special Carlos but oh man

[01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:49.130]
Woo

[01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:53.590]
Scanling says curling with your partner could be the best medicine if you're stressed

[01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:55.950]
It has nothing to do with the quality of a time spent

[01:18:55.950 --> 01:18:59.330]
Nothing to do with the quantity it's the quality of time spent

[01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:04.550]
Business try yeah, right because this is the way Americans answer polls

[01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:08.610]
Most people answer polls with what they think you want politically correct to say

[01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:11.450]
Right? Of course let's expect it to say

[01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:15.290]
Paddle she says we need to stop thinking of sex or intimacy as a marathon

[01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:19.110]
Why is that? Scanling says she sees it as more of a buffet

[01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:21.470]
Now we're talking honey more of a buffet

[01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.790]
How do you talk the the sexual buffet?

[01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:32.730]
However I can have a little appetizer have a little dessert she says you don't have to have everything inside for a pleasurable experience

[01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:35.050]
Have a little dessert she said I don't think she was thinking about it

[01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:35.150]
Correct!

[01:19:35.330 --> 01:19:36.010]
Oh my George was

[01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:37.410]
Cherry's

[01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:42.190]
Close to half of the men well don't say cherry's right away start thinking about I think of a hotpot Sunday

[01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:46.230]
And since the Carlos no like chocolate I think of those chocolate covered cherries

[01:19:46.770 --> 01:19:47.930]
Yeah those little bond bonds

[01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:50.310]
Not into those that much

[01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:51.350]
I like to regularly

[01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:55.590]
In fact I could take a bottle of Merchino cherries and just not only eat all the cherries out of it

[01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.150]
Which are artificially dyed by the way and very bad for you

[01:19:58.150 --> 01:20:00.350]
Also drink the juice out of that whole thing

[01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:02.010]
Oh my god am I right?

[01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:06.010]
Pure sugar and it's like like taking a syringe full of sugar putting into your veins

[01:20:06.650 --> 01:20:09.250]
But in other words you don't agree that it's delicious

[01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:11.890]
You couldn't drink the whole

[01:20:11.890 --> 01:20:13.690]
Oh come on

[01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.650]
I could

[01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:17.050]
They taste like the dye to me

[01:20:17.050 --> 01:20:17.590]
Yeah

[01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:19.010]
Those are Merchino cherries

[01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.930]
That's the one with Yanuki

[01:20:19.930 --> 01:20:20.290]
Yeah

[01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:23.890]
You're full of crap

[01:20:24.670 --> 01:20:28.370]
I'll tell you right now it sounds great a nice hotpot Sunday on Rocky Road

[01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:30.110]
Or fish food

[01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:34.830]
With just surrounded by Merchino cherries right from the jar you're talking about

[01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.290]
With a little bit of that sauce drizzle on it

[01:20:37.290 --> 01:20:40.290]
I'll take the milk and a whole bunch of whipped cream on top

[01:20:40.290 --> 01:20:41.790]
Hot sludge or melted butter

[01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:43.110]
Or maybe some marshmallow would be good

[01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:44.930]
Oh man like in a big fat

[01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:45.470]
Ah

[01:20:48.330 --> 01:20:53.410]
Yeah all you people out there all you skinny people we can't stand you we despise you

[01:20:53.930 --> 01:20:55.970]
We hate you like poison Carlos

[01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:57.530]
Five and a local

[01:20:57.530 --> 01:20:59.470]
This is five cities

[01:20:59.470 --> 01:21:03.010]
The reuse of yours is not a huge deal

[01:21:03.010 --> 01:21:03.530]
Q&M

[01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:06.230]
I'm over here

[01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:08.310]
One ninety five at the local pet store

[01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:09.430]
Busy and cute

[01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.330]
Who could ask for more through the journal

[01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:12.870]
Yeah

[01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:13.730]
Do the journal

[01:21:13.730 --> 01:21:15.010]
All right

[01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:18.810]
Bestamp pack your ever gone home

[01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:25.750]
When we got here it's Richard here with the gerbil in the tube and the matches here do the gerbil

[01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.230]
Do the gerbil

[01:21:29.970 --> 01:21:33.530]
Bestamp pack you'll ever want to home

[01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:34.010]
Oh

[01:21:34.010 --> 01:21:36.430]
You could have a puppy

[01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:39.410]
You could have a pussy cat

[01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:41.250]
But when you got a gerbil

[01:21:42.190 --> 01:21:44.150]
You'll go where is that?

[01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:45.330]
It's one out

[01:21:45.330 --> 01:21:46.470]
One for flaws

[01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:49.670]
Choose the one with the night it's flaws through the gerbil

[01:21:49.670 --> 01:21:52.210]
Up to the gerbil

[01:21:52.210 --> 01:21:53.030]
Wow

[01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:57.990]
Bestamp pack you'll ever want to home

[01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:05.090]
Pen 45 560 WQM

[01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:06.830]
Don't miss the gym and eh eh eh eh

[01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:08.290]
It's this room again you know it

[01:22:08.290 --> 01:22:10.290]
I'm starting to get all gagged and choked up in here

[01:22:10.290 --> 01:22:11.670]
How come it's not in there?

[01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.470]
Fate

[01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:16.350]
Oh

[01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:18.930]
Justice or maybe because you're sucking on those cockroaches

[01:22:18.930 --> 01:22:19.150]
Maybe

[01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:22.890]
Don't miss the gym manager and gober show today when you hear the sound of a hockey goal

[01:22:22.890 --> 01:22:27.550]
Be the fifth color of the contest line 800 227 05 60

[01:22:28.890 --> 01:22:31.770]
Put it a pair of tickets to a panties home game you'll be qualified to win ticket

[01:22:31.770 --> 01:22:34.370]
No now you played that and I'm not supposed to call now

[01:22:34.370 --> 01:22:36.510]
No this is a demonstration of what they're listening for

[01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:38.650]
That was for demonstration purposes only

[01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:41.430]
Be the fifth color of the contest line

[01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:45.890]
1 800 227 05 60 to win a pair of tickets to a panties home game

[01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:49.210]
And you'll be qualified to win tickets to the NHL all star game on Sunday

[01:22:49.210 --> 01:22:53.110]
That's during the gym manage and hang goal berg to berg into hockey intensive shows

[01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:54.470]
It will be doing that

[01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:56.690]
Well you said it's a great idea

[01:22:56.690 --> 01:22:59.650]
During two very hockey intensive shows and the sound of that goal

[01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:03.930]
Is like that

[01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:07.430]
So be less than this afternoon and okay to our guys our pysoons

[01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:12.330]
A growing number of scientists they present bushes of administration is distorting the scientific advisory process

[01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:16.090]
By pointing conservative ideologues to panels that are supposed to be impartial

[01:23:16.090 --> 01:23:16.550]
Ah!

[01:23:16.930 --> 01:23:18.990]
They fear the appointments are politically motivated

[01:23:18.990 --> 01:23:23.630]
And meant to delay decision making affecting controversial areas such as the environment abortion and workplace safety

[01:23:24.450 --> 01:23:29.930]
Administration officials say they're merely looking for a diverse to use and accused the critics themselves of playing politics

[01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:35.790]
One potential appointee marketing consultant HIV patient Jerry Thacker is we told you on the show days ago

[01:23:35.790 --> 01:23:41.050]
With your was name after a wide media barrage of coverage of controversy surrounding his nomination

[01:23:42.210 --> 01:23:44.990]
The man who was writing and raping about the gay plague

[01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:45.810]
Jerry Thacker

[01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:53.230]
Close to half the men surveyed 44% to get back to this obviously you know we want to spend a lot of time on this heavy duty

[01:23:53.650 --> 01:23:56.730]
44% of the men say they want sex more than their partner does

[01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:03.310]
Scantling says this would be news to many women since nearly a third of them say they're a perfect match with their partner when it comes to sex drive

[01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:04.590]
Yeah they think

[01:24:05.310 --> 01:24:08.350]
Well that's because they don't know about their partner what they're doing on the outside George

[01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:14.210]
She says if people started thinking about and appreciating all the other stuff aside from the physical act itself

[01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:18.890]
The intimacy the closeness the deep bond those numbers would be far different

[01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:24.030]
Because sex when it's good she says it's not about the physical act it's about to bond between two people

[01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:28.430]
See this is another one of those she reminds me of the dietitians. It's the same thing crap

[01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:34.170]
Maybe for her it is or maybe for some of the people she knows or maybe for about 10 people or who knows

[01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:39.750]
For some people it is for some people it's not some people like hot food Sundays other people don't like chocolate

[01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:44.170]
These people that want to define it for everybody right that's what this bitch is doing to be teased

[01:24:44.170 --> 01:24:49.890]
Just because she's scantily clad and spends a lot of time in the cucumber department what the hell does she know

[01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:57.530]
When it's good it's not about this act it's about the physical bond between the two people

[01:24:57.530 --> 01:25:06.890]
Sometimes it is and sometimes it's not sometimes it's hot sometimes it's lukewarm like that porridge with the three beers

[01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:13.250]
That's basically what life is all about kind of like working in this place now when it gets hot we don't know yet

[01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:17.690]
So far it's been lukewarm tempered at best but that's just the way this outfit is

[01:25:17.690 --> 01:25:21.690]
How many votes we got on that pool which of these statements best describes your sex life

[01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:27.070]
121 votes could be a lot better 24 could be better 20

[01:25:27.690 --> 01:25:34.010]
Okay 17 sensational 15 I guess the sensational people voted right away and now they're busy doing it

[01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:39.290]
Huh doesn't that make sense sure if that's that great they must be doing it right now something of the past 15

[01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:41.110]
Solo 12

[01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:43.710]
Non-existent 8

[01:25:43.710 --> 01:25:50.570]
Week 6 and I'm desperate for now of course we ordinarily more and say well if your desperate sent us a picture

[01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:59.310]
But quite frankly if you're desperate I think we need the picture right yeah we know why we if it just like a Carlos and probably those four people are very very close to Carlos

[01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:04.890]
And curing those of

[01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.030]
Well don't be so verbose

[01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:13.890]
Sugar risk and make you okay let's not give the thing here because then we might get some causal that maybe not I don't really care today

[01:26:13.890 --> 01:26:17.030]
I'm just in two of bizarre of a mood this whole place is just psychotic

[01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:23.390]
Here is the fact we got was yesterday since self-vote only has a classic rock station that plays the same tired

[01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:27.630]
War now 20 rock songs and an alternative news rock new rock station plays nothing but crap

[01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:33.290]
That's right in fact on the FM band in this market that's about 90% of what you're not just on one station

[01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:36.150]
But all the stations pure unadulterated around the clock

[01:26:36.570 --> 01:26:42.670]
Why not do a pull on favorite rock bands that should be getting more airplanes but don't so let's even though we got the sex pole up there for today

[01:26:42.670 --> 01:26:44.370]
We'll build the pool for tomorrow

[01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:46.610]
What could be more fun the building a pool?

[01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:51.770]
Then maybe having a real one says here who cares about hip hop or

[01:26:52.610 --> 01:26:57.470]
Sisters salsa it says I don't care about s is salsa even are my

[01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:02.930]
Chips which I can use it joking although the baked chips the ones that you hate so much

[01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:07.110]
Yeah, I don't know how you could say that you've never had lays baked potato chips. Yeah, I have I'm talking about

[01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:08.830]
ones are pasties. Oh

[01:27:09.870 --> 01:27:10.990]
So good. Yeah

[01:27:12.610 --> 01:27:15.690]
As opposed to the kind of you like that are so salty man fried

[01:27:15.690 --> 01:27:20.410]
So when you when you eat the kind of you like it's like licking a salt look you feel like a deer in the headlights

[01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:24.630]
Like the president looks all the time. You just how you fucking your heart. That's how you know. It's good

[01:27:24.630 --> 01:27:26.170]
You feel that oh

[01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:30.290]
His vote by the way or its vote whoever said the facts was AC DC

[01:27:30.290 --> 01:27:33.850]
So that's where I'm gonna be tomorrow's and we'll take some suggestions because I don't have any

[01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:39.330]
Because I'm gonna listen to radio here anyway period. What's the point? I do monitor the most show in the morning on the way in

[01:27:41.010 --> 01:27:43.230]
And that come in I look at that phone man

[01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:46.010]
Whoo like that valley days

[01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:53.250]
It was really desolate all morning long every time I went out there to take a leak as I turned that corner

[01:27:54.210 --> 01:27:59.050]
Although Moe did eyeball me one time when I was turning the crowd. I guess he was checking out my outfit. I didn't like the no shirt mo

[01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:01.950]
And the new pants pantaloonies

[01:28:03.170 --> 01:28:07.310]
What rock fans do you think should be getting a lot more air play in South Florida is gonna be our pull question tomorrow

[01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:12.410]
Which are nearly we don't do it ahead, but this is the only we're gonna like build it right sure we're building it

[01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.890]
AC DC

[01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:21.750]
Is the one okay somebody did call yesterday with a suggestion, but I have no idea what they say. I forgot what was it we don't know

[01:28:23.210 --> 01:28:24.670]
Journey, um, I don't know

[01:28:25.330 --> 01:28:26.130]
How about foreigner?

[01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:29.310]
Okay, I love foreigner and it's not just that I love them

[01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:30.950]
But I don't I don't hear it because I'm not listening

[01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:34.990]
But who the hell in this marketplace foreigner cold as ice you'll hear once in a great while

[01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:40.230]
That's about it and like everything else just it you like you'll hear and you'll hear one song by a group that you're like a lot

[01:28:40.230 --> 01:28:44.730]
And then they play it so much you might have paid in the song and then the rest of the group songs that you may love

[01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:48.370]
You'll ever hear them like the cars with a hundred good songs. They play let's go. That's right

[01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:52.010]
And as soon as they play let's go I do do another spot on the dial

[01:28:52.770 --> 01:28:57.890]
Like what Cheryl does when she hears our nine to ten hour in the morning. She doesn't like she wants us to go back to bedtime stories

[01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:00.010]
No chance honey. No chance

[01:29:00.010 --> 01:29:04.650]
And I understand that we got that small percentage out there. It's too small, man

[01:29:04.650 --> 01:29:09.470]
That's what they're telling me too small who want to hear the bedtime stories like these guys here

[01:29:09.470 --> 01:29:13.190]
We'll lie a lot and even Miguel. Oh, yeah, that's great. We're really interesting stuff bull crap

[01:29:14.370 --> 01:29:18.410]
They don't want to hear that though. They want to hear crap. They want to hear us say crap on you or a lot

[01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:22.590]
We got Lynn Samuels listening up there on the internet. She wants to hear he's an asshole. That's right

[01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:26.110]
At least two three four five hundred times a day and that makes them happy. That's all they want

[01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:30.230]
They want a bunch of intellectual crap. What are they gonna? What are they gonna get intellectual from us?

[01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:35.590]
Are we intellectual no or much of slabs over here? That's all we like to eat we like to get laid whatever the hell it is

[01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:38.290]
Talk with a cop at our mouth. Talk with a cop at our mouth. I

[01:29:39.210 --> 01:29:46.130]
There you go. You don't even have a cop drop. You're on all of them in there. What can you got you got to die ones that make you I could use those okay

[01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:51.410]
I'm a little plugged up if I can say that probably from all that extra food

[01:29:51.410 --> 01:29:54.470]
I mean you get to a doctor and fix your problem instead of doing a radio show with

[01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:58.230]
Okay, you're gonna fill in yeah

[01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:02.810]
AC DC and for her that's the beginning of our list. I'm sure it'll be a sensationalist

[01:30:03.170 --> 01:30:07.010]
5 6 7 0 5 60. I think that's for a hundred of them. Just one would have been nice

[01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:08.570]
God

[01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:15.830]
The cough drop pusher got any good drugs. Okay. Now I can do it too. I'll grab

[01:30:16.810 --> 01:30:20.250]
Now who was it? Oh, he's leaving anyway the guy's gonna be the truck driver. We don't get me

[01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:24.570]
We like him a lot even over freez full of crap about his tough football players. Oh, man

[01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:32.290]
How you can call a guy to waste three hundred and forty pounds or three hundred pounds an athlete you must be off your rocker

[01:30:32.290 --> 01:30:37.590]
And this of course is part of the myth of the the football fan. Oh, these are the greatest condition athletes

[01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:38.650]
Right

[01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:41.250]
It's whatever big tubs of crap

[01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:48.270]
Big fat tub this stand there holding out of guys if they call all the holding in the NFL the game would take about 60 hours

[01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:49.870]
Every play would be a penalty

[01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:53.730]
They're tackling and of course the same in the NHL. By the way Gary Batman

[01:30:53.730 --> 01:30:59.090]
Now that all the people from the NHL are in town or at least they're getting their arriving for the all-star game this weekend

[01:30:59.090 --> 01:31:02.830]
Let me just say this Gary Batman. You were a disaster teams are going bankrupt

[01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:06.850]
There's more holding and clutching all that crap at the beginning of the season just like every day

[01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:09.690]
There are guys getting tackled out there and mid-ice

[01:31:10.750 --> 01:31:11.510]
No penalty

[01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:17.510]
How to help in the great players excel how can the game be exciting when there's all the just like Mario said a couple of years ago

[01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:21.370]
Before we hung it up that one time how can it be exciting when everybody's getting the yankton pulled and

[01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:25.470]
Tackled nobody wants to see that crap Gary Batman you idiot

[01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:32.510]
The game's got big problems especially all those people disguised as empty seats empty yellow seats at the Fleet Center

[01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:39.410]
Always a good idea to put your seats in bright yellow so that when there's nobody there like like a like a neon sign

[01:31:39.410 --> 01:31:46.370]
flashing hey look at this empty empty empty yeah good idea Gary Batman you imbecile you you moron

[01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:52.910]
In fact an honor the all-star game being it which I don't care about because I don't quote exhibition games and you know

[01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:54.510]
I want to see those guys play in real games

[01:31:55.070 --> 01:31:58.370]
In honor of Gary Batman M.O.R.O.N. yeah

[01:31:58.370 --> 01:32:01.730]
I knew we'd say something sooner or later I agreed with nice going mo

[01:32:01.730 --> 01:32:06.350]
Which of course are the first two letters of M.O.R.O.N. no coincidence either

[01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:13.490]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 boy my wound up today you know and I got a headache for meeting all that food at the track last night

[01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:17.490]
I didn't want to go to the track. I know it sounds like I'm like at my age a weakling

[01:32:18.190 --> 01:32:19.970]
Stand up for yourself be a man mr

[01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:23.730]
Don't get pushed around and run around like that, you know for other people's fun and convenience

[01:32:25.170 --> 01:32:28.390]
Don't you think a couple nights a week is plenty to go there and make a contribution?

[01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:32.350]
I have a good time up there, but you know enough is enough and when I go there I eat and

[01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:34.590]
There you are

[01:32:34.590 --> 01:32:36.550]
And there I am fat

[01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:42.530]
High blood sugar high blood pressure right from getting agitated and aggravated clogged arteries

[01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:45.650]
I got to one over to four seven eight. I don't give a crap what you got okay?

[01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:51.230]
I don't give a crap that your nephew is a gambling genius a gaming genius and is gonna

[01:32:51.230 --> 01:32:55.270]
Win the pick for which he didn't by the way nice going Anthony. He still parked on the outside

[01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:57.310]
Do you want an aspirin? No?

[01:32:58.010 --> 01:33:02.110]
I'm didn't say I'm sick. I said I'm a lease that you had a headache. I've been sad. What did I say that?

[01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:04.090]
Just now I said I need a cough drop

[01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:07.510]
30 seconds ago. Well, I'm a little bit behind okay

[01:33:09.730 --> 01:33:14.850]
Norther I see you're gonna need to do it too. Hey, and you only means you sent these in here so that I can talk with this crap

[01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:19.130]
No, you see right through my plan. I'll be every time I'm taking it out right now. So I can enjoy it after the show

[01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:26.890]
It might it might be a little gamey by that time especially sitting on his copy here, but nevertheless

[01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:31.070]
I'm gonna enjoy my horseman to lift his sugar free a lashing after the show

[01:33:32.210 --> 01:33:35.710]
And on the way home, which I'll probably have to make a real quick trip on the way home

[01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:38.230]
Well, why do you think I had to run in there and have a car was sitting here for you?

[01:33:38.250 --> 01:33:40.790]
Did you really but I want to tell you something folks seriously?

[01:33:41.370 --> 01:33:46.190]
Whatever you think of George. I have never seen a man crap as much in my life as a scuff or a little guy

[01:33:46.950 --> 01:33:53.190]
Seriously every morning at least four five six eight ten a hundred crafts before the show during the show

[01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:57.750]
You know, I didn't take the before the show in this morning, Mr. Exaggerator

[01:33:58.310 --> 01:34:01.030]
Don't you usually usually some days twice

[01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.930]
Some days twice

[01:34:03.250 --> 01:34:08.350]
That's my power yesterday to take a leak and guilty was oh he took the smelliest crap in there and he came

[01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:11.990]
I will say this he apologized when he came up because he was in birth. I was standing taking a leak

[01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:16.350]
What would you apologize? I just don't got the place that you know he admitted he knew it smelled real bad

[01:34:16.710 --> 01:34:20.370]
Yeah, but it's not like it's your fault and don't you understand the pressure he's in all morning every day?

[01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:23.770]
I you know, I feel bad for him. Maybe he should stab jokes in the back. I don't know

[01:34:24.230 --> 01:34:24.570]
Huh?

[01:34:24.570 --> 01:34:29.190]
No seriously, I mean poor Gelly, you know, he's like a between a rock and a heart and a high voice

[01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:34.530]
He can't help it. Oh, no, I feel bad because he's under such tremendous stress and duress

[01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:41.870]
If he were the wrong shirt if it's the wrong color socks. I mean he's gonna get bitched out his life will be made just a misery

[01:34:43.330 --> 01:34:49.470]
So probably that's why he's taking such smelly dumps in there and when you combine that with a smell of that pepsin at the

[01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:51.410]
Carlos has the wall smeared with

[01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:58.550]
God, I'll say one thing his breath must be okay because he uses like a habit to a toothpaste to clean out whatever you do that

[01:34:58.550 --> 01:35:03.630]
Trench mouth. Yeah, then he goes and smokes cigarette right after and he gets trench mouth right back the motorist teeth are orange

[01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:08.810]
Hey, I want to tell you something if you want to lose weight because you're fat because you grow test because you can't get laid

[01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:14.450]
Maybe because you haven't seen it in years you get in a shower and you're looking down all you see is a big fat

[01:35:15.790 --> 01:35:18.370]
Popic or his book of rhyme would say poopic

[01:35:18.850 --> 01:35:22.630]
Balance for life can't do it for you because there's no cooking no shopping no cleaning no words

[01:35:22.630 --> 01:35:27.450]
You don't have to do anything no matter how dumb you are no matter how simple you are they take care of it for you

[01:35:27.450 --> 01:35:33.550]
They bring you a little black sack they deliver it to your door at work at your office at your massage parlor by six o'clock every morning

[01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:38.370]
And then they're all your food for the day is waiting for you you get to choose between two choices for every meal

[01:35:38.370 --> 01:35:41.250]
Three gourmet meals are in your sack along with two delicious snacks

[01:35:41.250 --> 01:35:45.390]
And these are all in little plastic containers that you can microwave everything is fresh

[01:35:45.390 --> 01:35:48.730]
There's nothing frozen. There's nothing pre-fab no chemicals no garbage

[01:35:49.150 --> 01:35:53.790]
No little pigeon-sized portions either plenty of food to keep you satisfied and losing the weight all through the day

[01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:56.390]
So if you've tried all the other diets and I have a work for you

[01:35:56.390 --> 01:36:01.230]
If you're frustrated because you just don't know what to eat and lose that weight give this a try because like the beast

[01:36:01.230 --> 01:36:03.710]
He's turning into like almost a real human being pretty soon

[01:36:03.710 --> 01:36:13.810]

Every time I see

And in our ticketed idiots

[01:37:00.490 --> 01:37:05.030]

[01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:06.630]
But now he's here

[01:37:06.630 --> 01:37:09.710]
First road in the four years

[01:37:09.710 --> 01:37:11.270]
With President Thumb

[01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:12.070]
Thumb

[01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:13.130]
Thumb

[01:37:15.550 --> 01:37:15.850]
Thumb

[01:37:15.850 --> 01:37:18.970]
Oh what I get to

[01:37:18.970 --> 01:37:22.390]
No choice but to go

[01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:23.470]
And get to

[01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.830]
We all voted more

[01:37:27.210 --> 01:37:28.250]
Why

[01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:30.970]
If you want this

Thumb

Thumb

[01:37:47.810 --> 01:37:48.850]
Thumb

[01:37:48.850 --> 01:37:50.590]
He's President Thumb

[01:37:50.590 --> 01:37:51.310]
Thumb

[01:37:51.310 --> 01:37:53.950]
Yeah, don't care what it's up

[01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:56.830]
You got him here by hook or drop

[01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.350]
The Chris is right

[01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:59.710]
You know what it does

[01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:02.610]
You and I, but how don't fear

[01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:04.810]
We've got a great leader

[01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:06.850]
With President Thumb

[01:38:08.370 --> 01:38:09.090]
Thumb

[01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.970]
Thumb

[01:38:12.570 --> 01:38:13.290]
Thumb

[01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:14.290]
What is your history?

[01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:16.930]
I'll pay that. I'm about 4'5", 6'7", who?

[01:38:16.930 --> 01:38:18.250]
There's Muff just came in the door

[01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:19.510]
Turn around, walk right back out

[01:38:20.690 --> 01:38:21.750]
Were you looking for me?

[01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:24.030]
Because I can put on another couple of bits

[01:38:24.030 --> 01:38:25.070]
And we'll just chat for a few minutes

[01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:27.290]
I always enjoy chatting with the Muffster

[01:38:27.770 --> 01:38:29.730]
Anyway, here's the fact that you should have

[01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:31.330]
Three answers for your sex pool

[01:38:31.330 --> 01:38:33.030]
From Frank, thank you Frank, it's kind of cute

[01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:35.390]
One, try weekly, spell T-R-Y

[01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:36.030]
Try weekly

[01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:38.810]
Two, T-R-I, dash weekly

[01:38:40.110 --> 01:38:43.470]
And third, T-R-Y, W-E-A-K, try weekly

[01:38:44.490 --> 01:38:45.950]
Not bad, Frank, I like it

[01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:46.650]
Let's hear it for Frank

[01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:48.890]
He's lame, nice going Frank

[01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:49.890]
I'll tell you about lame

[01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:52.310]
I want you to stop everything you're doing right now

[01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:53.750]
Whatever you're having in there, forget about that

[01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:55.950]
Because I have a major bulletin for you

[01:38:57.610 --> 01:38:59.670]
I, you know who's a major asshole

[01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:01.510]
I mean, not that it's a bullet

[01:39:01.910 --> 01:39:03.370]
No, seriously, and of course again

[01:39:03.370 --> 01:39:05.730]
It's just like my getting tucked into the track when I don't want to

[01:39:05.730 --> 01:39:07.490]
I'm a weak sister, man, I'm weak

[01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:09.150]
I'm weak, I'm weak

[01:39:09.150 --> 01:39:11.490]
I need to have Marlon Brander, slap me on the side of my push

[01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:11.630]
Yes

[01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:14.610]
Now don't look for the drop in place

[01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:16.210]
Just listen to me, very important

[01:39:16.710 --> 01:39:18.970]
You're a close personal friend, a big fan of yours, Greg

[01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:20.170]
From Hunger

[01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:22.110]
Now, didn't I try to appease him

[01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:24.830]
And didn't we try to have like a little fun with him in faxes every day

[01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:25.810]
And we'd read it on it, right?

[01:39:26.130 --> 01:39:27.390]
Yes, I knew it was a mistake

[01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:29.650]
He's a sick, crazy person

[01:39:29.650 --> 01:39:30.830]
Like that

[01:39:32.610 --> 01:39:34.090]
And I stand by what I've always said

[01:39:34.090 --> 01:39:35.030]
The chronics are

[01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:38.730]
They're, they're, not just the chronics

[01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:40.210]
They're crazy people, Gordish, Telfin

[01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:40.850]
Exactly

[01:39:41.410 --> 01:39:43.830]
Sense me a fact today, now I don't care what I don't

[01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:46.450]
Don't I read them all with their critical, their cost, their sarcastic

[01:39:46.450 --> 01:39:49.170]
Today, he's not only upset with 9 to 10 hours

[01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:51.430]
He's upset with everything I've ever talked about on the show

[01:39:51.430 --> 01:39:52.710]
He's a lunatic

[01:39:53.150 --> 01:39:54.930]
Do not ever fax this again

[01:39:54.930 --> 01:39:57.070]
Because just like certain other faxes that come in here

[01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:59.950]
If we see the writing, if we see the printing, if we see the

[01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:02.710]
Telltale signs, write in a Schmidt can

[01:40:02.710 --> 01:40:04.730]
All you be doing is wasting some time

[01:40:04.730 --> 01:40:06.070]
Although we'll keep you off the street

[01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:08.430]
He is a certifiable, crazy person

[01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:10.150]
Who now is dissatisfied

[01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:12.850]
Not only the 9 to 10 hour, but also with the fact that

[01:40:12.850 --> 01:40:14.250]
Everything else I've ever talked about

[01:40:16.210 --> 01:40:17.430]
He must have a short memory

[01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:19.130]
I beg your pardon

[01:40:19.130 --> 01:40:22.990]
Do you remember all those psychotic faxes that he used to send way back when when he was hating you

[01:40:22.990 --> 01:40:24.410]
Because you wouldn't talk to him on the air

[01:40:24.970 --> 01:40:25.370]
Yeah

[01:40:25.370 --> 01:40:27.810]
Be rating you for very much the same thing

[01:40:27.810 --> 01:40:29.610]
Have a call with absolutely absolutely everything you do

[01:40:29.610 --> 01:40:31.170]
You say the glasses that you wear

[01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.310]
How about the Ramon somebody says

[01:40:33.310 --> 01:40:34.830]
We're not we better get with this

[01:40:34.830 --> 01:40:37.470]
Although I got a lot of stuff to do including a little chat with the

[01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.850]
Duff

[01:40:38.430 --> 01:40:40.850]
He looked like he looked like a lost puppy when he came here didn't he

[01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:43.030]
Looks like he was looking for a shelter

[01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:45.270]
How about the Ramones for the

[01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:46.250]
Thing to Martin Queen

[01:40:46.890 --> 01:40:49.410]
Can't hear enough queen on the air says Rick and Tampa

[01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:53.050]
How do you like that we're getting faxes from Tampa and our thing today? How do you like that?

[01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:55.290]
That's just jealous because they want a Super Bowl

[01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:56.530]
Okay, don't be picking on Tampa

[01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:58.570]
Even though they're mostly a bunch of mugwumps

[01:40:58.570 --> 01:41:00.330]
Rick's probably not one maybe is

[01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:02.190]
But he likes queen so we know what he is

[01:41:02.190 --> 01:41:04.110]
So queen and the Ramones right

[01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:09.790]
And for her an AC DC just now where we hear that I'm local does Zeta play a queen?

[01:41:10.930 --> 01:41:13.390]
I don't know and I wouldn't know now

[01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:17.450]
I'm like pop it up. Yeah, when's the last time you heard a queen record on Zeta?

[01:41:18.230 --> 01:41:21.770]
Six months ago he said well that's not gonna cut it mister, okay?

[01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:23.990]
Which which song was it too?

[01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:29.490]
Oh, what was it we are the champion well what a surprise oh

[01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:35.870]
We are the champion you know something if I ever heard that again I'm gonna turn into Freddie Mercury between that and another one bites the dump

[01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:38.890]
I'm gonna put a big earring on my other size amount rush more

[01:41:38.890 --> 01:41:43.830]
Yeah, another one bites it us to be improvement over we are the champion. Yeah, let's take play it. It's just like

[01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:48.390]
It's just like do we really want to hear that thing from the games again rock and roll part one two and five

[01:41:48.810 --> 01:41:52.810]
Gary's glitter all like litters is not so old maybe too young

[01:41:53.530 --> 01:41:57.910]
We don't want to hear that anymore. Why don't they stop and that's another thing Gary better than every arena

[01:41:57.910 --> 01:42:03.810]
It's all pre-fabricated the same crap on the screen. Oh nobody comes into our house and pushes us around

[01:42:03.810 --> 01:42:08.090]
You know the home team is losing like six nothing nobody comes into our house and pushes us around right?

[01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:13.650]
By the way, what's his name Brian Treche get fired as coach of the Rangers let's hear it

[01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:16.150]
Anything bad that happens to the Rangers makes me happy

[01:42:16.850 --> 01:42:21.110]
Because they suck the whole organization just spewing out money

[01:42:21.110 --> 01:42:24.010]
Bad money after worse or is it the other way around?

[01:42:24.550 --> 01:42:31.970]
Thanks Rick and Tampa couple of good suggestions there of course what does Rick and Tampa know about the music here maybe maybe he's lived here maybe he knows the radio here sucks

[01:42:32.610 --> 01:42:38.350]
Don't friend. Oh, let me put that down there so I can enjoy it after the show. Oh

[01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:45.350]
Here's a whole list. Oh, oh good list. I don't want to rush that we'll get into it. This could be a very lengthy list

[01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:51.070]
This could take days and days. So thanks very much to every set of set of set idea for that poll

[01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:56.910]
I like those then the audience loves those good look at that we actually got some calls on there which we make it

[01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:59.230]
Just shut the name out right here. No

[01:42:59.230 --> 01:42:59.450]
No

[01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:07.670]
See this is the problem we got that's why we had so many problems with the bedtime stories because George is too lazy to screen a phone calls

[01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:16.090]
He can't take the abuse he can't take the punishment like and take it. No you can't. No you can't. I know that you got that big new fat contract

[01:43:16.090 --> 01:43:21.870]
The years you got no excuses anymore for what they had to take a chunk out of Carlos's paycheck just to cover it

[01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:28.090]
Since times are really tough and now we got Bill Mullen working here in sales that's

[01:43:29.390 --> 01:43:34.190]
That's just it's not possible. Remember our good friend Scott Schwartz when he came to work here and we said he made a bad mistake

[01:43:34.190 --> 01:43:41.170]
The moment he came in the door who did he come and see us because he's our friend. He's our buddy. Good guy Scott and Laura Schwartz. How you doing guys?

[01:43:41.910 --> 01:43:47.310]
For the 15 kids. I've ever talked to her that's her about how she stiff me at records that day. She saw me coming in like

[01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:54.170]
Grand the other way. Get out. She didn't run the other way but she was in her ears. I remember that. Yeah and so she looked at

[01:43:54.170 --> 01:44:03.450]
Oh, not Neil. I don't have time to say hello. We always said hi and I was it. She just having you had times in your life

[01:44:03.450 --> 01:44:08.810]
When you've been in a situation where like in a major emergency like going and buying diapers at Walgreens or something

[01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:14.510]
And you'd be born to be bothered with it like Carlos where you saw him out of the corner of your eye you probably run even if I didn't have some

[01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:17.710]
I throw him one of the diapers. Probably come in handy in that sink

[01:44:19.090 --> 01:44:21.050]
While Mo was reaching around for them balls

[01:44:21.610 --> 01:44:27.370]
10 past 11 at 560 W to QMA speaking of balls if you're still laying yours on the same old lumpy worn out mattress

[01:45:10.290 --> 01:45:15.870]
If you're not comfortable after the first night you just bought yourself 59 more sleepless nights before you can do anything about it

[01:45:15.870 --> 01:45:19.230]
Then they'll charge you for restocking re-delivering you pay full retail prices on exchanges

[01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:23.450]
That's not the way anybody wants to do business and that's not the way they do business at dial amatras

[01:46:21.090 --> 01:46:27.890]
And work its attempt to steal a baby sheep but this week the farmer smells smoke

[01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:30.390]
Fire fire in the barn

[01:46:30.390 --> 01:46:33.290]
Fire in the barn only cow

[01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:38.230]
You're jammed and all their animals is in there what do we do to me?

[01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:39.870]
I got an idea

[01:46:40.590 --> 01:46:41.310]
Gassy

[01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:46.070]
Gassy you got to open the door and put the fire on

[01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:48.470]

[01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:51.670]
The door is still stuck

[01:46:51.670 --> 01:46:54.030]
Come on Gassy you can do it

[01:46:56.110 --> 01:46:58.610]
It's still stuck it's no use

[01:46:58.610 --> 01:47:01.950]
You're not going to do it Gassy try as hard as you can

[01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:12.090]
Look the fire is going out

[01:47:12.090 --> 01:47:17.170]
And the door is open all the animals are safe good job girl

[01:47:17.170 --> 01:47:18.910]
Good girl Gassy

[01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:22.390]
Guess this means an extra big plate of beans tonight

[01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:30.830]
Tune in next week for the continuing adventures of Gassy the wonder dog

[01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:33.670]
Love it 68 at 560 WDFM

[01:47:33.670 --> 01:47:36.810]
What an intemper little bastard that Carlos says you know my little dog is on the way out

[01:47:36.810 --> 01:47:40.710]
And he's laughing and he's making fun of it that was in very poor taste

[01:47:42.090 --> 01:47:43.630]
Want to do an office pull on the date?

[01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:46.270]
New pull how much does your girlfriend or wife weigh?

[01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:50.870]
These people man are all crying now didn't we ask we asked for creative pulls?

[01:47:51.170 --> 01:47:56.110]
How much does your girlfriend or wife weigh and he's got like all these categories less than 100 more than 200 etc.

[01:47:56.170 --> 01:47:56.950]
I don't think so

[01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:57.990]
You think so?

[01:47:58.850 --> 01:47:59.790]
I mean what does that mean?

[01:48:00.070 --> 01:48:00.070]

[01:48:00.850 --> 01:48:03.730]
How much does your wife or girlfriend weigh? How much do you weigh?

[01:48:04.050 --> 01:48:04.330]
Right

[01:48:04.330 --> 01:48:09.330]
Yeah, forget about your wife or girlfriend which you're probably trying, forget about that how much do you weigh?

[01:48:09.330 --> 01:48:09.890]
Fatso?

[01:48:10.750 --> 01:48:14.590]
I see no you guys out there 90% like fatter than I am and that's pretty fat

[01:48:15.210 --> 01:48:20.270]
Obes, tubby, got a huge overhang big big poopic

[01:48:20.270 --> 01:48:24.270]
Shovel it at time you're pushed like that Vanana split layer cake I ate at the track all the time

[01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:29.330]
I've no business a diabetic like me a fat ol diabetic eating banana split layer cake

[01:48:30.190 --> 01:48:30.590]
Good

[01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.970]
They all like that

[01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:34.010]
They drizzled like raspberry sauce surrounded and like

[01:48:34.010 --> 01:48:35.130]
Well not on your tombstone

[01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:35.770]
It was good

[01:48:35.770 --> 01:48:36.490]
It was good

[01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:39.990]
And I did it to say fat rich whatever that means

[01:48:40.750 --> 01:48:41.950]
You threw yourself on it?

[01:48:42.690 --> 01:48:45.010]
Stop playing the guilt trips on me okay you guys?

[01:48:45.590 --> 01:48:50.150]
I didn't come back to town so I could sit at the track they're holding fat ridges and having him say oh I had it

[01:48:50.150 --> 01:48:52.750]
I got the trip along I go one over to 678 I don't care

[01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:54.490]
I really don't care it's getting really ponderous

[01:48:55.730 --> 01:48:59.390]
Isn't it amazing how some people can take an experience that you would like like our sex pool

[01:48:59.390 --> 01:49:03.710]
Take an experience that you otherwise enjoy a lot and turn it into something awful

[01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:06.110]
Kind of like working here you know what I'm saying?

[01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:12.310]
Don't miss the gym manager Hank Goldberg showed today when you hear the sound of a hockey goal be the fifth quarter of the contest line

[01:49:12.310 --> 01:49:17.970]
1-800-227-560-2-0-880-2-2-2-70-560

[01:49:17.970 --> 01:49:22.610]
Win a pair tickets for a Panthers home game and you'll be qualified to win tickets to the NHL also a game on Sunday

[01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:29.070]
Now clearance made a change in that because the original copy I don't want to say what it's like

[01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:32.690]
Because it said to the Leafs game next Wednesday maybe they're not giving away tickets to the Leafs game free

[01:49:32.690 --> 01:49:39.030]
Maybe we got some Leafs fans going to be there a I'll be there next Wednesday February 5th at the Macarena Yanta Center

[01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:40.470]
Formerly called

[01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:43.250]
So anyway here's this list

[01:49:44.710 --> 01:49:48.250]
Group state ought to be played a lot more on South Florida radio

[01:49:48.250 --> 01:49:49.370]
ELO

[01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:50.390]
Oh yeah

[01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:52.370]
Alan Parsons project

[01:49:52.370 --> 01:49:54.190]
Okay so far so good

[01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:54.770]
Garbage

[01:49:55.690 --> 01:49:55.770]
Amen

[01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:56.710]
Vivo

[01:49:56.710 --> 01:49:57.470]
Okay

[01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:58.130]
Vivo

[01:49:58.130 --> 01:49:58.730]
Answer

[01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:02.530]
The monkeys other than last train at Clarksville and Daydream Believer

[01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:05.530]
Yeah there's a lot of other goods what do you know what do you give me a look like that

[01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:10.670]
Well the point is trying to make is that they only play those two like I'm not I understand you don't like the monkeys

[01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:12.670]
Yeah but they're like the monkeys

[01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:17.210]
What's wrong with you man are you some kind of a communist that's like they don't play it off our cheats

[01:50:19.290 --> 01:50:21.470]
The monkeys had a lot of big hits the archies

[01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.970]
I understand

[01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:25.070]
All the archies weren't a real good number one and neither were the monkeys

[01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.910]
That's not true

[01:50:26.350 --> 01:50:29.170]
That's not true Peter Turk was a fine musician and so was Michael Mason

[01:50:29.170 --> 01:50:32.010]
None of them knew how to play anything when they got the job with each other

[01:50:32.670 --> 01:50:37.470]
The only one you're talking about is Davie Jones and the Mickey Dolans were not real musicians

[01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:41.710]
Peter Turk Michael Mason has the first record a lot of music right he was like a the one

[01:50:41.710 --> 01:50:48.070]
So what the fact is that they had a lot of big hits okay here we go we're not going to be able to put groups on there that George doesn't like

[01:50:48.630 --> 01:50:49.530]
That's not what I'm saying

[01:50:49.530 --> 01:50:50.230]
Yes it is

[01:50:50.850 --> 01:50:55.270]
We just got the parameters of this pool when I'm pretty good at putting that guy put something on this

[01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:59.050]
I'm not putting anything on her if George doesn't like it like the frickin monkeys I like the monkeys open

[01:50:59.050 --> 01:50:59.770]
I like the monkeys too

[01:50:59.770 --> 01:51:03.670]
I like the monkeys a lot even though Davie Jones looks like he smells real bad

[01:51:03.670 --> 01:51:06.450]
But plain just the right amount of monkeys on the radio in some way or no

[01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:07.490]
No they're how do you know

[01:51:07.950 --> 01:51:09.490]
When's the last time you heard a monkey song?

[01:51:09.670 --> 01:51:09.990]
Exactly

[01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:11.890]
They didn't believe we were a last time to Clarksville

[01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:14.510]
Well I see what you're saying sarcasm

[01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:17.850]
I'm gonna put this damn thing there I can't how do you like that?

[01:51:18.050 --> 01:51:18.330]
Oh no

[01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:18.970]
I know you're a game

[01:51:18.970 --> 01:51:20.850]
Too can talk with this thing in their mouth

[01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:23.530]
And the Bee Gees before and after Saturday night fever

[01:51:23.530 --> 01:51:23.850]
I agree

[01:51:23.850 --> 01:51:28.150]
Which I thought I did a fantastic job if I say so myself and my arms were long and I'm gonna have to sell it

[01:51:28.150 --> 01:51:29.650]
I pat myself on the back and the ass

[01:51:29.650 --> 01:51:30.170]
Huh?

[01:51:30.430 --> 01:51:30.590]
Amen?

[01:51:31.110 --> 01:51:31.530]
That was great

[01:51:31.530 --> 01:51:34.130]
Because we never hear any of those great songs on the radio here

[01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:40.010]
It says and I'll pay money if somebody will break into magic and steal their copy of

[01:51:40.010 --> 01:51:41.970]
If you want to be happy for the rest of your life

[01:51:41.970 --> 01:51:45.350]
Just because every eight year old in that ten-toned request it doesn't mean that you keep playing

[01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:47.170]
Jimmy Soul if you want to be happy

[01:51:47.170 --> 01:51:47.730]
I don't know

[01:51:47.730 --> 01:51:48.330]
I don't want to hear that

[01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:49.190]
I'll tip into that case

[01:51:49.190 --> 01:51:51.290]
Or build me up buttercup by the foundations

[01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:52.150]
Don't want to hear it again

[01:51:52.150 --> 01:51:52.510]
Ever

[01:51:53.170 --> 01:51:53.570]
Ever

[01:51:53.570 --> 01:51:54.510]
Why don't you

[01:51:55.210 --> 01:51:56.010]
Build me up

[01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:59.550]
So there you go I think we got let's see

[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:01.130]
That's a good list

[01:52:01.130 --> 01:52:03.510]
And the Mucky's will go on list and spot your crap

[01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:06.050]
Oh they're not really musicians yeah

[01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:08.670]
That's not why it's just it's just bubble gum

[01:52:08.670 --> 01:52:09.950]
It's like the Archies

[01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:10.610]
It's just from the beginning

[01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:13.070]
But there are a lot of people who like the music

[01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:14.510]
The Archies have a lot of the things

[01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:18.150]
We're not confining it to one category of the kind of music that you like

[01:52:18.150 --> 01:52:19.450]
I understand that

[01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:21.530]
If somebody says they ought to play more to pack or whatever

[01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:24.030]
I'm not going to not put it under because I don't like rap music

[01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:25.730]
It's up to these what they want

[01:52:26.130 --> 01:52:27.090]
That's what you want

[01:52:27.090 --> 01:52:30.390]
If we want to know what you want we can discuss that before the show every day

[01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:32.910]
We don't need to take a poll of the audience to find out what you want

[01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:34.010]
We know what you want

[01:52:34.690 --> 01:52:35.190]
What's that?

[01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:37.010]
What you didn't get last night at Treasure Island

[01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.770]
That's what you want

[01:52:37.770 --> 01:52:38.270]
How do you know?

[01:52:38.690 --> 01:52:39.050]
Diddy?

[01:52:39.390 --> 01:52:40.470]

[01:52:40.470 --> 01:52:41.210]

Amy I got a name for your list

[01:53:49.690 --> 01:53:50.250]

[01:53:51.150 --> 01:53:55.430]
Hopefully I mean never a quiz I might have been you never recorded a bad song Jim Croci

[01:53:55.990 --> 01:54:00.110]
Jim Croci excellent but every one of our dead people we like too was on that list

[01:54:00.110 --> 01:54:04.310]
And they always play just Leeward Bound or whatever you know

[01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.890]
Or whatever

[01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:08.510]
You want to hear operator on it just radio here

[01:54:08.510 --> 01:54:14.150]
That's always popular but another list possibly is people you never want to hear again on the radio

[01:54:14.810 --> 01:54:17.110]
That's a good point I could take a lot of time

[01:54:17.110 --> 01:54:18.050]
Okay thanks

[01:54:18.050 --> 01:54:18.490]
Thanks

[01:54:18.490 --> 01:54:19.830]
What do you mean that could take a long time

[01:54:20.810 --> 01:54:22.630]
Like the monkeys you don't want to hear them anymore

[01:54:22.630 --> 01:54:23.510]
That's not what I said

[01:54:23.510 --> 01:54:24.670]
Do you want to hear the monkeys?

[01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:26.670]
Sure let's place the monkeys

[01:54:26.670 --> 01:54:27.550]

[01:54:28.230 --> 01:54:29.190]
And you know what I got?

[01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:30.950]

[01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:32.310]
Well we do that

[01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:37.310]
Oh now see I'm going to put this on the list even though I don't I won't say I don't like them

[01:54:37.310 --> 01:54:39.310]
I don't have a need to hear them again

[01:54:39.310 --> 01:54:39.930]
I agree

[01:54:39.930 --> 01:54:40.470]

Very good

[01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:45.650]
I like Boston as a city as a group I could you know take them or leave them

[01:54:45.650 --> 01:54:49.710]
I liked it all and then they played it and played it and played it more than a squealing

[01:54:49.710 --> 01:54:51.190]
Oh and no

[01:54:51.190 --> 01:54:55.050]
I had the record I had to give it away just because I didn't want to hear it anymore

[01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:59.310]
Well I have a feeling let's see here's when it says the patch mode the cure and the Smiths

[01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.450]
Excellent

[01:55:00.450 --> 01:55:01.330]
The choice is all

[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:07.090]
Yeah I have no problem with those see I'm agreeable here because I'm I'm opening this up to a wide variety

[01:55:07.090 --> 01:55:13.510]
And I did make a mistake the other day when we were like doing the the dead artists and we should have put two pack on there and big e-smalls

[01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:16.650]
And small e-bick with e-i-g and notorious s-a

[01:55:16.650 --> 01:55:16.970]
S-a-s

[01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:17.350]
Yeah well then

[01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:19.830]
And we didn't

[01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:23.870]
And I got news for it we got to take a pool what's the point of just gearing it to your own

[01:55:24.770 --> 01:55:26.530]
You know you can just come on and make an announcement

[01:55:26.530 --> 01:55:34.530]
Read list here's the people I like here's the groups I like and that's it you know what kind of a show is that what kind of a bunch of crap is that crap right

[01:55:35.590 --> 01:55:37.730]

[01:55:49.710 --> 01:55:53.410]
But we'll find out when we take that pool won't we

Well we'll find something out what do you mean by that why are you so I don't why is he such an asshole can you explain that to me it's natural oh I just have a feeling that they're gonna want to pee on the parade

[01:56:05.230 --> 01:56:13.670]
I don't have any idea what they're gonna do I think a lot most of them will give like an honest opinion they will analyze it and they'll say hey I hate it or I like it or it's great or it sucks that's what they'll say

[01:56:14.350 --> 01:56:18.170]

[02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:19.130]

five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty only eighteen teen for rise in line and I did not buy tickets for the all-star game

[02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:58.470]
Moses I'm very sorry and quit taking our steroids because you're starting to blow up like a balloon

[02:03:58.470 --> 02:04:05.890]
but I didn't buy tickets for the all-star game so no you can't have them and if I did the buy them I'm sure somebody else would have already scanned them okay

[02:04:05.890 --> 02:04:14.190]
I should think I would think I've had only about 600 people ask me oh if you're not going to use those tickets the all-star game

[02:04:14.190 --> 02:04:21.130]
I didn't buy tickets to the all-star game knowing full of advance that I would never under any circumstances go to a meaningless game

[02:04:21.130 --> 02:04:28.730]
where many many of the top stars the most important ones will not be participating anyway so can I have them yeah you can have all I got

[02:04:29.850 --> 02:04:38.850]
here's for Lauderdale hello hey Neil how you doing pretty good I got a band for your pole there and I also want to say another thing

[02:04:38.850 --> 02:04:48.910]
first real quick about the state of the union to address the other day yeah you know I'm not a big bush fan and I tried to watch it for a couple minutes with me and my wife

[02:04:48.910 --> 02:04:59.950]
just to see what he had to say and every three seconds everyone kept applauding and standing up and clapping and I really didn't understand you know what he was saying

[02:05:00.450 --> 02:05:10.510]
he really wasn't getting to any point and every two seconds everyone kept clapping and I was doing that that's why the state of the union addresses really a waste of time

[02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:17.410]
it's a simple crap so I watched it for two minutes and I turned it off I said I can't stand this all they're doing it's clapping anyways for the band

[02:05:17.410 --> 02:05:23.870]
now they got a real awful name and I know you're going to hate the name but I think they're a great band I'm Jeff Rolthol

[02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:32.510]
you're right you're right on the first part that doesn't mean I'm not going to put them down I'm not going to be like George and build a pole based on what I like

[02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:39.550]
thank you well you're all right Neil no matter what George says but no Jeff Rolthol is great they don't get enough radio play and the stuff they do play on the radio

[02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:48.990]
they're one of those bands that have a lot better music you know on the CDs that they didn't play on the radio I sure hope so

[02:05:48.990 --> 02:05:54.030]
but I'll put them down for me I appreciate it and George stop cracking so much yeah quick taking so many dumpster

I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I

[02:14:55.850 --> 02:15:14.430]
I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I know I

He's having stomach pride he's having some issues between you and him if he's having some issues I sure hope he brought some tissues between you and him. Ladies and gentlemen for those who keep track have a diary of this show every day.

[02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:39.050]
between Georgian Carlos, I think that's 86 crafts and it's not even noon yet. I just had the one.

[02:15:39.390 --> 02:15:39.630]
Wow.

[02:15:41.110 --> 02:15:44.490]
Anyway, here's the fact that it says, is they play the Bee Gees, you can hear Stan a lot but never lights on.

[02:15:44.590 --> 02:15:52.230]
But while we already went through that, Sean, if they play George Harrison, you'll hear the Durg while my guitar gently weaves switch and sperm and play that, which I love that bit by the way.

[02:15:52.450 --> 02:15:54.250]
But not you, what is life or dark horse?

[02:15:54.890 --> 02:15:55.350]
Here's the groups.

[02:15:55.770 --> 02:15:57.610]
ELO we got. Thank you. Moody Blues.

[02:15:59.550 --> 02:15:59.950]
Okay.

[02:16:00.210 --> 02:16:01.030]
38 Special.

[02:16:01.770 --> 02:16:07.410]
Okay. See now, you don't like 38 Special. You gave me that look and I don't I play that the light inside to behind.

[02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:12.170]
Once upon a time, they were overplayed and they kind of got destroyed for me.

[02:16:12.910 --> 02:16:13.470]
Why is that?

[02:16:13.730 --> 02:16:14.350]
Because they were overplayed.

[02:16:14.970 --> 02:16:15.090]
Oh.

[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:18.070]
Radio has it ruined certain songs or groups for you to play that.

[02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:21.050]
You know, I just get to say that before we were listening instead of sitting there, shmuzin with Carlos.

[02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:22.570]
What? You said probably what's making him sick?

[02:16:23.130 --> 02:16:23.490]
Yes.

[02:16:23.490 --> 02:16:23.630]
Yes.

[02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:28.430]
It says they're coming in a trance a great for you to get a crap break or knock off a piece of ass.

[02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:36.310]
And Jeff Roteau would somebody just say, isn't humanly possible leaving a gunpoint for big one or six to go six minutes without playing pink Floyd?

[02:16:36.610 --> 02:16:39.770]
If I hit the wall one more time, I'm going to put the B of PD's heads through one.

[02:16:40.630 --> 02:16:42.970]
And what is a T dance once Sean and Holly would know?

[02:16:43.170 --> 02:16:44.070]
Well, don't throw it away.

[02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:49.670]
I'm not throwing it away. I'm probably saying, Jesus, man, are you just on Tinder hooks?

[02:16:49.970 --> 02:16:50.630]
Whatever that means.

[02:16:50.930 --> 02:16:51.950]
What is a Tinder hook?

[02:16:52.130 --> 02:16:52.430]
I don't know.

[02:16:52.430 --> 02:16:53.530]
Oh, is there anything like a T-

[02:16:53.530 --> 02:16:54.330]
But you heard that, haven't you?

[02:16:54.490 --> 02:16:54.610]
No.

[02:16:55.330 --> 02:16:56.430]
Log into Messina.

[02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:58.690]
The Dubie Brothers.

[02:16:58.950 --> 02:17:00.270]
Yeah, we hear enough Dubie Brothers.

[02:17:00.630 --> 02:17:00.970]
Don't we?

[02:17:01.150 --> 02:17:02.230]
I'm crossing that out.

[02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:04.010]
The Eagles.

[02:17:04.250 --> 02:17:05.610]
No, I don't know.

[02:17:06.370 --> 02:17:08.210]
They were played to death, but I guess I don't know.

[02:17:08.270 --> 02:17:09.030]
Who plays them anymore?

[02:17:09.250 --> 02:17:09.650]
Not that I would.

[02:17:09.710 --> 02:17:10.690]
Magic, really?

[02:17:11.150 --> 02:17:11.910]
Once in a great while.

[02:17:12.130 --> 02:17:18.890]
In between, build me a buttercup and if you want to be happy for a rest of your life, what do they play besides life in the fast lane?

[02:17:19.670 --> 02:17:19.930]
Who?

[02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:22.750]
I don't know. Do I listen to the FM and this?

[02:17:22.830 --> 02:17:23.570]
I don't know.

[02:17:23.770 --> 02:17:24.350]
We're quiet.

[02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:25.990]
I don't know. And that's the reason I don't listen to this.

[02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.670]
So they play the same.

[02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:28.950]
You've lost that love and feel on by the righteous brothers.

[02:17:29.230 --> 02:17:31.050]
And I'll get built mentally coming out of my left here.

[02:17:31.050 --> 02:17:32.830]
And Bobby Hatfield coming out of the other one, okay?

[02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.350]
Who?

[02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:36.530]
Oh, so demorbitant, depressing.

[02:17:37.150 --> 02:17:39.490]
It's your suicide-inducing station magic.

[02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:40.290]
102.

[02:17:41.050 --> 02:17:41.390]
07.

[02:17:42.310 --> 02:17:42.510]
God.

[02:17:44.350 --> 02:17:45.370]
Depressing morbid music.

[02:17:45.470 --> 02:17:47.890]
At least the monkey's music most of it is a beat.

[02:17:48.130 --> 02:17:48.650]
Yes, it is.

[02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:49.250]
Fun music.

[02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:49.750]
Yeah.

[02:17:50.170 --> 02:17:53.550]
I mean, most of the beat's boys music is fun music, right?

[02:17:53.970 --> 02:17:54.090]
Yep.

[02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:58.270]
Even though they're morbidant depressing themselves, the ones who are still alive.

[02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:59.710]
Steely Dan.

[02:18:00.170 --> 02:18:00.750]
Are we out of gas?

[02:18:01.850 --> 02:18:02.750]
Yeah, we're out of gas.

[02:18:02.930 --> 02:18:03.170]
Oh.

[02:18:03.850 --> 02:18:06.150]
I don't think Carlos is from what I'm hearing.

[02:18:07.470 --> 02:18:08.410]
What is your problem?

[02:18:08.750 --> 02:18:10.390]
I think he has a bleeding ulcer or something.

[02:18:10.890 --> 02:18:11.050]
What?

[02:18:12.490 --> 02:18:13.930]
His stomach is killing him.

[02:18:15.530 --> 02:18:16.250]
Meaning what?

[02:18:16.590 --> 02:18:17.510]
I don't know what that means.

[02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:18.510]
It means what it means.

[02:18:19.430 --> 02:18:20.870]
He just took an ant's acid.

[02:18:21.130 --> 02:18:24.110]
I think we better send to the hospital to the emergency room.

[02:18:24.190 --> 02:18:25.830]
I think I should drive at Mount Sinai.

[02:18:26.610 --> 02:18:29.710]
Maybe he could be in the same bed that Morris was in.

[02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:32.090]
Maybe he had the same doctor.

[02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:35.130]
Maybe he could get the same operation.

[02:18:36.130 --> 02:18:38.850]
Anyway, Micah says you still need to have that place tested for more.

[02:18:38.990 --> 02:18:39.970]
Well, thank you anyway, Micah.

[02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.690]
But we'll pass.

[02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:42.350]
Well, what's the use?

[02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:44.030]
You know, I'm not going to be here that much longer anyway.

[02:18:44.310 --> 02:18:46.150]
And as far as George is concerned, well, whatever.

[02:18:46.150 --> 02:18:50.730]
Small potatoes, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:52.570]
So anyway, why don't you come in here and take the elbow?

[02:18:52.690 --> 02:18:53.670]
Don't fart when you come in here.

[02:18:54.470 --> 02:18:55.610]
But I'll give you all of these.

[02:18:56.070 --> 02:18:57.610]
Well, I don't really have that many of them so far.

[02:18:58.390 --> 02:18:59.550]
Because we don't need to repeat.

[02:18:59.710 --> 02:19:01.650]
And I don't have the time to sit here and write all that crap down.

[02:19:02.170 --> 02:19:03.130]
Do we have the time for that?

[02:19:03.430 --> 02:19:06.570]
Not especially now that we got that new 90% comedy bits out every day.

[02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:08.590]
Because now it seems like we just sat down.

[02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:09.590]
And it's not already.

[02:19:09.610 --> 02:19:10.010]
No, no, no.

[02:19:10.270 --> 02:19:10.530]
Yeah.

[02:19:10.750 --> 02:19:13.170]
You can maintain a constant energy level all the way to the end.

[02:19:13.310 --> 02:19:16.050]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life?

[02:19:16.770 --> 02:19:19.470]
OK, 55 could be a lot better, 54.

[02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:20.910]
Could be better, 52.

[02:19:21.670 --> 02:19:22.470]
Sensational, 50.

[02:19:23.210 --> 02:19:27.130]
15.6% of this crowd so far say their sex life is sensational.

[02:19:28.350 --> 02:19:31.330]
And they were just taking a little bit of a break to go to their pewter and, you know,

[02:19:31.650 --> 02:19:33.070]
fold on a pool and then they're right back at it.

[02:19:33.390 --> 02:19:34.050]
Solo, 32.

[02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:36.090]
Something of the past 28.

[02:19:36.410 --> 02:19:37.490]
Non-existent, 26.

[02:19:37.930 --> 02:19:38.490]
Week, 12.

[02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:39.990]
And I'm desperate, 10.

[02:19:42.710 --> 02:19:43.930]
Here's a call from Cooper City.

[02:19:44.070 --> 02:19:44.230]
Hello.

[02:19:46.050 --> 02:19:46.990]
Hey, Neil, how are you?

[02:19:47.070 --> 02:19:47.490]
OK, sir.

[02:19:47.890 --> 02:19:49.910]
Hey, listen, let me do with your polls or anything.

[02:19:49.950 --> 02:19:52.070]
I was driving the other day.

[02:19:52.090 --> 02:19:53.870]
I was coming to Kentucky, believe it or not.

[02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:56.010]
And this guy came on.

[02:19:56.090 --> 02:19:57.770]
He's a national, on the national radio.

[02:19:57.870 --> 02:19:59.490]
I mean, he was going to syndicated show and all.

[02:19:59.870 --> 02:20:05.230]
And he started talking about you as far as that condolence of thing saying that, you know,

[02:20:05.290 --> 02:20:09.930]
it's a disgrace and that, you know, somebody in the top administration should be.

[02:20:10.050 --> 02:20:10.310]
Yeah.

[02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:11.270]
Why is that?

[02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:14.390]
Well, because he was saying that it's wrong.

[02:20:14.390 --> 02:20:17.870]
It shouldn't be that he played and he didn't play it.

[02:20:17.970 --> 02:20:18.890]
I was going to call him up.

[02:20:18.890 --> 02:20:21.970]
I had to take with me and I was going to call him up and play it.

[02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:26.030]
But he read the words over the phone saying, you know, what it was.

[02:20:26.090 --> 02:20:28.890]
It was a disgrace and that he called the radio station.

[02:20:29.290 --> 02:20:34.630]
And the radio station said that whatever goes on and out, you know, has nothing to do

[02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:37.530]
with management, the station, whatever.

[02:20:38.010 --> 02:20:39.970]
In other words, what's the point?

[02:20:40.330 --> 02:20:44.370]
Well, I was just saying that, you know, what he was saying was that it was a big disgrace

[02:20:44.370 --> 02:20:46.230]
and he was talking a lot of the answer.

[02:20:46.410 --> 02:20:47.330]
Why do I care about that?

[02:20:47.350 --> 02:20:47.710]
What he says?

[02:20:47.850 --> 02:20:48.470]
I'm going to get stuck.

[02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:52.690]
I'm just, you know, we don't care about what people in Kentucky or in Illinois for that

[02:20:52.690 --> 02:20:53.570]
matter any other place.

[02:20:53.970 --> 02:20:55.430]
We care about what other people in this market.

[02:20:56.010 --> 02:20:59.150]
And so far for 27 years, they've been most of them pretty happy with his show and ones

[02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.350]
who aren't.

[02:20:59.450 --> 02:21:00.010]
They don't listen to it.

[02:21:00.610 --> 02:21:01.330]
Makes sense to me.

[02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:05.870]
Four minutes till noon at 5.60 W.C.

[02:21:05.910 --> 02:21:06.950]
I'm doing the right spot.

[02:21:07.050 --> 02:21:07.750]
I just tore up the law.

[02:21:07.850 --> 02:21:08.690]
What's bottom I'm doing now?

[02:21:08.890 --> 02:21:09.210]
Delights.

[02:21:09.210 --> 02:21:09.970]
Oh, no.

[02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:10.430]
Sorry.

[02:21:11.230 --> 02:21:11.510]
How it?

[02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:14.250]
Well, you don't want to be messing with Tom Lehman.

[02:21:14.410 --> 02:21:16.430]
He'll come right over here and drive a vehicle right over your head.

[02:21:18.090 --> 02:21:21.330]
Tom Lehman and Joe Preator are up to their armprits in vehicles right now because the

[02:21:21.330 --> 02:21:23.810]
factory sent them so many cars there's no place to park them.

[02:21:24.210 --> 02:21:27.750]
Even Tom Lehman had to park a whole bunch in his driveway in cars too, so they like to

[02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:28.510]
place one in yours.

[02:21:28.930 --> 02:21:32.390]
How it is blowing out all the new vehicles, regardless of profit, including the Pontiac

[02:21:32.390 --> 02:21:37.410]
Vime starting at only $13,998, and up to five grand off every GMC on-voy in stock.

[02:21:37.410 --> 02:21:40.830]
Plus, get 0% financing or up to a $3,000 rebate.

[02:21:41.170 --> 02:21:45.190]
And how it's also about like you'll always find their a gigantic almost endless sea of

[02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:48.310]
tremendous selection of dependable pre-owned cars, trucks, and SUVs.

[02:21:48.490 --> 02:21:51.090]
Maybe you can get like a tax rebate on your SUV, George, but I doubt it.

[02:21:51.430 --> 02:21:56.870]
And if your credit is really bad, man, if it blows, if it's marginal, if it's not

[02:21:56.870 --> 02:22:00.010]
existing, that's not a problem in how because they'll find a way to get you into whatever

[02:22:00.010 --> 02:22:00.690]
you're looking for.

[02:22:00.950 --> 02:22:03.370]
It's the winner-blessed emergency clearance sail going on right now.

[02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:06.950]
And how that Pontiac GMC, the same great place where they've been doing people great for

[02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:09.790]
over 35 years, 134 or once out of Dixie Highway.

[02:22:09.930 --> 02:22:12.850]
That's your West One across from the falls, open every day, seven days a week.

[02:22:13.290 --> 02:22:15.610]
And you can save even more by mentioning that near Roger sent you by.

[02:22:15.930 --> 02:22:19.950]
Call the near Roger's NEODial hotline at 1.883-440-211.

[02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:26.090]
That's 1.883-440-211 for Halibut Pontiac GMC who are professional grades.

[02:22:58.930 --> 02:23:01.730]
Hi kids, y'all like cutting little stinkers?

[02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:04.350]
That funny little sound that comes right out your stinkers?

[02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:07.610]
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I do?

[02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:10.270]
Get paid for writing little songs about boo-boo?

[02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:11.990]
My brains are gone.

[02:23:12.290 --> 02:23:15.550]
I'm trying to get my groove on, but I can't figure out which spice school I'm gonna

[02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:16.190]
fart on.

[02:23:16.610 --> 02:23:19.070]
And Dr. Dre asked, yo, man, you passed good?

[02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:20.010]
Hey, I know.

[02:23:20.190 --> 02:23:21.250]
So what do I smell like?

[02:23:21.490 --> 02:23:22.450]
I asked many new low-quests.

[02:23:22.450 --> 02:23:24.870]
Well, since age 12, it seemed like I always smelled.

[02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:27.490]
I thought ripping gasses in June was pretty swell.

[02:23:27.870 --> 02:23:32.250]
I got pissed off when I flipped my jeans off and bothered so hard to turn my underwear

[02:23:32.250 --> 02:23:33.830]
backwards like criss-crossed.

[02:23:34.150 --> 02:23:36.270]
And every night I'm like, oh, dinner last.

[02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:39.430]
Then fun at my ass, fast in the fat, fat, fat, you ain't too fast.

[02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:40.610]
Smell this honey.

[02:23:40.750 --> 02:23:43.370]
Yo, feel the weight of my ass, but girl, come on, I don't give a fuck.

[02:23:43.570 --> 02:23:45.230]
God sent me to stink the world, though.

[02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:52.430]
My ain't is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my

[02:23:53.050 --> 02:23:56.570]
ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain is, my ain.

[02:23:56.570 --> 02:23:59.650]
Well, I ain't good to hear you want to me kick down back in junior high.

[02:23:59.930 --> 02:24:02.510]
Still the problem was, something prone up my ass and die.

[02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:04.470]
I shot him in the face with my vapor.

[02:24:04.850 --> 02:24:08.270]
The worse happened later, when I covered his desk with used toilet vapor.

[02:24:08.610 --> 02:24:11.010]
Walked in a strip club, my testers would fill up.

[02:24:11.430 --> 02:24:13.870]
Moong the bartender took a dozen of tip club.

[02:24:14.350 --> 02:24:16.570]
Went over to a dancer, had a fuck in her guard.

[02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:19.750]
She listed a leg up, and I knew she was a fraud.

[02:24:22.330 --> 02:24:25.730]
I just found out my mom got all gas and I do

[02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:28.530]
I told her I grow up to be a famous rapper

[02:24:28.530 --> 02:24:30.410]
Make a record about strange noises

[02:24:30.410 --> 02:24:31.670]
Made on the crampor

[02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:34.470]
You know you will dirt when the lemon rush to leave

[02:24:34.470 --> 02:24:37.370]
You drive to hold it back but you wasn't even relieved

[02:24:37.370 --> 02:24:40.330]
This guy at White Castle said it was pretty cool

[02:24:40.330 --> 02:24:43.330]
But I had to go, go drop the kids off and the boo

[02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:46.470]
My ain't this, my ain't this

[02:24:46.470 --> 02:24:51.590]
My ain't this, my ain't this

[02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:53.890]
My ain't this, my ain't this

[02:24:53.890 --> 02:24:56.170]
My ain't this, my ain't this

[02:24:56.170 --> 02:25:02.830]
My ain't this, my ain't this

[02:25:02.830 --> 02:25:05.150]
12-3-5-6-8-10

[02:25:05.150 --> 02:25:06.030]
I'm sorry I think it's tonight

[02:25:06.030 --> 02:25:07.790]
Yes, that's how it's called

[02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:10.390]
I hope you enjoy it

[02:25:10.390 --> 02:25:11.970]
Anyway, here's a fact from Anne who says

[02:25:11.970 --> 02:25:15.130]
Listener for many years but your bush bashing is a little much

[02:25:15.570 --> 02:25:17.230]
Since you're supposed to be well informed

[02:25:17.230 --> 02:25:19.230]
You must have missed Powell's announcement last week

[02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:22.090]
That oil and its revenues are to be held in trust for the people of Iraq

[02:25:23.170 --> 02:25:26.130]
And Teddy Roosevelt told the Indians that some day they'd be able to open up

[02:25:26.650 --> 02:25:27.890]
Gambling things under reservations

[02:25:28.830 --> 02:25:30.510]
Casinos just takes a long time

[02:25:30.930 --> 02:25:33.010]
As far as chainy he's worth so many millions now

[02:25:33.010 --> 02:25:36.110]
I doubt he needs to sacrifice our boys to put bread on the table

[02:25:36.110 --> 02:25:38.310]
Oh, now who's being naive, Kay?

[02:25:38.370 --> 02:25:39.970]
Yeah, now who's being naive, Anne?

[02:25:40.650 --> 02:25:42.110]
Right, he's worth so many millions already

[02:25:42.110 --> 02:25:44.890]
See, one thing about those people and the people that they represent

[02:25:44.890 --> 02:25:46.150]
They never have enough

[02:25:47.210 --> 02:25:49.830]
That's why you have these proposed tax cuts again for the rich

[02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:51.850]
The first round that was just like child play

[02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.990]
I love to wet their beak

[02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:55.830]
Yeah, just wanted to wet their beak a little bit

[02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:57.830]
Now they want to wet their whole body at least down to their navel

[02:25:59.610 --> 02:26:01.370]
So Anne, you know, you're in time with your opinions

[02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:03.670]
But this idea, well I've listened for many years but

[02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:06.010]
If you don't like what you heard a program have a great life

[02:26:06.010 --> 02:26:07.050]
That's all I can tell you

[02:26:07.050 --> 02:26:08.650]
You don't have to agree with anything that I say

[02:26:08.650 --> 02:26:10.130]
This show is mainly entertainment

[02:26:10.130 --> 02:26:11.690]
But that does not stop talking about

[02:26:11.690 --> 02:26:14.190]
El Presidente and these goose steppers we got up there now

[02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:16.330]
And I do do, I do do

[02:26:16.330 --> 02:26:19.230]
Now you're the ones that do do, I do a lot of reading Anne believe me

[02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:20.890]
So I don't just make things up

[02:26:20.890 --> 02:26:24.310]
In fact if he went to our website and just beside the pool which is just for fun

[02:26:24.310 --> 02:26:26.790]
And found a really interesting story that around her

[02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:28.450]
Maybe you might learn something too sweetheart

[02:26:29.710 --> 02:26:31.310]
Although she's probably got her hip boots out

[02:26:31.310 --> 02:26:34.250]
She's probably goose stepping around the lunch table right now

[02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:35.090]
When you think?

[02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:36.750]
I can see it

[02:26:36.750 --> 02:26:39.650]
One of three women finalists on the hip fox we got on the show

[02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:43.210]
Joe millionaire is starred under another name in dozens of bondage and fetish films

[02:26:43.210 --> 02:26:44.750]
A website reported yesterday

[02:26:45.410 --> 02:26:49.490]
Sarah Coser has appeared often bound and gagged but fully clothed

[02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:53.750]
In such movies as Hogtide and help us heroines on the stage named Cindy Schubert

[02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:55.090]
According to Smoking Gun

[02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:59.530]
In pictures on a website Coser has seen bound and gagged in various poses

[02:26:59.530 --> 02:27:02.050]
In some cases dressed as a cheerleader or nurse

[02:27:02.050 --> 02:27:04.630]
In other photos she's seeing tying up, tying up men

[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:05.210]
Oh right

[02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:07.530]
Coser 29 could not be reached for comment

[02:27:07.530 --> 02:27:12.190]
A spokesman for Fox which describes her occupation as sales and design on the show's website

[02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:15.230]
Said only we don't come into the personal lives of our reality show contestants

[02:27:16.690 --> 02:27:19.610]
The program which was secretly taped in France late last year

[02:27:19.610 --> 02:27:22.370]
Has drawn unexpectedly high ratings for Fox on Monday night

[02:27:22.890 --> 02:27:24.770]
Except for me I'm not watching it

[02:27:24.770 --> 02:27:26.190]
Carlos ain't watching it

[02:27:26.190 --> 02:27:27.410]
Georgian wasn't

[02:27:27.410 --> 02:27:29.010]
Mad Dog loves it, he loves it

[02:27:29.010 --> 02:27:29.710]
Oh right

[02:27:30.210 --> 02:27:32.870]
Can I take a lot of the guys you know the the jot kind of guys

[02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:35.450]
The ones that really hate women deep down our neath and resent them bitterly

[02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:37.190]
No seriously that's why they like that

[02:27:38.370 --> 02:27:41.190]
Because they feel you know anything where the women are getting conned and

[02:27:41.530 --> 02:27:43.150]
Have one put it over on them so to speak

[02:27:43.150 --> 02:27:47.450]
Of course in the bottom line is that it looks like that the people are watching that are the ones that are getting conned

[02:27:49.150 --> 02:27:50.010]
But be that as it may

[02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:52.090]
Look at it look at this phone man

[02:27:52.090 --> 02:27:54.650]
I'm telling you we come up with something really spectacular here today

[02:27:54.650 --> 02:27:56.110]
And the phone is as dead as a door nail

[02:27:56.610 --> 02:27:57.230]
One call

[02:27:58.270 --> 02:28:00.870]
And especially like I said yesterday when we tried that 910

[02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:03.610]
And you can press it down to make the work of the audience that much less

[02:28:03.610 --> 02:28:05.950]
Put less that much less pressure on them

[02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:07.270]
Are they list building?

[02:28:07.510 --> 02:28:08.610]
Yeah very weak

[02:28:09.970 --> 02:28:10.490]
56050560

[02:28:10.490 --> 02:28:13.570]
pound 560 on the 18 and team Verizon line

[02:28:13.570 --> 02:28:14.390]
Miami hello

[02:28:14.390 --> 02:28:15.710]
Hello there how you doing?

[02:28:15.850 --> 02:28:16.310]
Okay sir

[02:28:16.310 --> 02:28:20.850]
Well you can this one call has been listened to you for about 15 years now

[02:28:20.850 --> 02:28:22.210]
This is the second time I've called

[02:28:22.210 --> 02:28:23.370]
That's about good that's right

[02:28:24.210 --> 02:28:26.490]
I wanted to add two up until your list

[02:28:26.490 --> 02:28:26.890]
Yeah

[02:28:27.610 --> 02:28:28.090]
Sugar cult

[02:28:29.710 --> 02:28:30.490]
Sugar why?

[02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:31.270]
Sugar cult

[02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:32.130]
Yeah

[02:28:32.690 --> 02:28:33.770]
What the hell is that?

[02:28:33.850 --> 02:28:34.410]
It's a group

[02:28:34.410 --> 02:28:35.150]
Okay

[02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:36.310]
Very good music

[02:28:36.310 --> 02:28:37.150]
Never heard of it

[02:28:37.150 --> 02:28:38.270]
Nobody here ever heard of it

[02:28:38.270 --> 02:28:39.710]
I know that's the problem

[02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:42.270]
They have had a couple of songs out

[02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:45.550]
But all their stuff has seemed to be good

[02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:46.450]
How they as good as the monkeys

[02:28:47.430 --> 02:28:49.470]
Same type of music to be honest with you

[02:28:49.470 --> 02:28:49.810]
Oh

[02:28:50.390 --> 02:28:50.790]
Similar

[02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:54.130]
I mean I'm surprised that it's not doing better

[02:28:54.650 --> 02:28:56.330]
Because of the type of music it is

[02:28:57.170 --> 02:28:59.490]
And there's another one called authority zero

[02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:02.030]
Yeah

[02:29:02.030 --> 02:29:04.870]
And what you could do with the polls is to split it

[02:29:04.870 --> 02:29:06.570]
Get more days out of it

[02:29:06.570 --> 02:29:08.370]
Yeah we might do it for like a couple of months

[02:29:08.370 --> 02:29:10.770]
I'll be honest with you the response is pretty disappointing

[02:29:10.770 --> 02:29:12.950]
And especially in a market where the music is such crap

[02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:13.950]
Would everybody agrees with

[02:29:13.950 --> 02:29:16.590]
You think that would be a lot better in this but this is this thing

[02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:19.290]
Everybody's conditioned to listen to the crap that's down here

[02:29:19.290 --> 02:29:19.530]
Yeah

[02:29:19.530 --> 02:29:25.610]
I mean if I didn't have a computer and watch TV very late at night

[02:29:25.610 --> 02:29:27.170]
You don't hear a lot of groups

[02:29:27.170 --> 02:29:27.530]
Yeah

[02:29:27.530 --> 02:29:28.930]
Okay we got you down on that

[02:29:29.450 --> 02:29:29.810]
Alrighty

[02:29:29.810 --> 02:29:30.690]
Have a good one

[02:29:30.690 --> 02:29:31.950]
Here's the fact that it says Chicago

[02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:33.850]
Which I would agree with that

[02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:36.270]
Especially

[02:29:36.270 --> 02:29:37.470]
I played more good Chicago

[02:29:37.470 --> 02:29:40.070]
Remember that the show I didn't Toronto that few days

[02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.290]
Yep

[02:29:40.930 --> 02:29:42.150]
The best American group

[02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:43.350]
Which we screwed up on

[02:29:43.350 --> 02:29:44.610]
And we left so many good groups off there

[02:29:44.610 --> 02:29:46.330]
And it was so that gives us a chance to do it again

[02:29:46.330 --> 02:29:46.790]
And get it right

[02:29:48.410 --> 02:29:50.110]
PS it says keep up the bush bashing

[02:29:50.110 --> 02:29:50.810]
Yes I will

[02:29:51.790 --> 02:29:52.510]
Absolutely will

[02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:54.950]
To see there's nothing I hate to break the news to the right wingers

[02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:56.170]
There's nothing that exempts

[02:29:56.170 --> 02:29:59.550]
This administration or anybody in it from criticism

[02:29:59.550 --> 02:30:03.530]
From being you know criticised either seriously or parodies or sat there

[02:30:03.530 --> 02:30:04.190]
Anything else

[02:30:04.830 --> 02:30:06.830]
There's no sign on the White House door this is

[02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:09.690]
Well we are above that and don't pick on us

[02:30:09.690 --> 02:30:10.350]
Screw that

[02:30:10.990 --> 02:30:11.830]
Doesn't work

[02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:15.430]
It's amazing I was discussing this with somebody yesterday

[02:30:15.430 --> 02:30:20.530]
It's amazing to me how you almost never read about liberals or moderates

[02:30:20.530 --> 02:30:24.690]
Or your independence trying to get conservatives off the air

[02:30:25.450 --> 02:30:26.950]
What's the last time you ever read about that?

[02:30:27.190 --> 02:30:27.390]
Never

[02:30:27.390 --> 02:30:30.670]
What's the people on the right they are always screaming about the liberal media

[02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:36.310]
They don't just want balance what they want is everybody who's the left of a telephone off the air now

[02:30:37.830 --> 02:30:41.810]
So anybody who confuses anything that's done whether it's here or anyplace else

[02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:45.590]
With any other issues it's all just out of piscation

[02:30:45.590 --> 02:30:47.530]
It's all a smokescreen

[02:30:48.730 --> 02:30:52.850]
Anybody to the left of a telephone must not be on the air expressing opinions

[02:30:54.330 --> 02:30:55.470]
Contrary to this administration

[02:30:56.470 --> 02:30:57.990]
And that's it that's just the way it is

[02:30:57.990 --> 02:31:01.550]
Joe McCarthy would not only be proud he's a piker compared to this crowd

[02:31:03.110 --> 02:31:05.810]
So I hope you and the president have a great time okay sweetheart?

[02:31:08.370 --> 02:31:10.950]
Nine minutes after noon at 5.60 WQYM

[02:31:10.950 --> 02:31:13.470]
I'll tell you one thing if you're having sleepless nights tossing and turning

[02:31:13.470 --> 02:31:17.410]
Maybe it's because you're worried about the world blowing up or maybe because of your mattress sucks or maybe both

[02:31:17.410 --> 02:31:20.710]
Well I can't help you with the first part but I can really help you with the second part

[02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:23.310]
Dialogue mattress of the people to call 1-800-MATRUS

[02:31:23.310 --> 02:31:25.790]

[02:31:43.330 --> 02:31:47.270]
And price can't beat them we're talking about everyday low prices and no bait and swish

[02:31:47.270 --> 02:31:51.490]
Exactly the mattress you want is in stock ready for nearly immediate delivery the top brands in the world

[02:31:51.490 --> 02:31:55.110]
Seely, Serta, Simmons, Kingcool, Airby, Sais and Stamau the Sun

[02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:58.630]
And you've got 30 days to try out in your home with the best comfort exchange policy in the world

[02:31:58.630 --> 02:32:03.710]
So why waste all that time and gas running around town going from bedding to departments throwing every place else

[02:32:03.710 --> 02:32:08.430]
When you can just sit there make one easy call, tool free 1-800-MATRUS and they'll be there in no time at all

1-800-MATRUS for diala mattress the answer for a perfect night sleep

[02:32:18.990 --> 02:32:24.030]
I've got a local, this is 560, the radio's on your side

[02:32:24.030 --> 02:32:26.190]
Q-A-N

[02:32:27.930 --> 02:32:30.130]
Bandage, I f*** them out

[02:32:30.130 --> 02:32:54.970]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

[02:32:55.910 --> 02:33:03.790]
America's titles back again and sets up finest art, Dumbled Man has gone, he's been the trunk of someone's car

[02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:12.290]
I'm hoping for controversy before it's all gone, other than that one-lake song, where's Kelly Clarkson?

[02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:20.850]
Piercings and tattoos and chubby girls in belly shirts, smoking marijuana and then sucking on their shirts

[02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:29.330]
Each one of them dreamin' that they might just be a star, when you could fit their talent in a little Mason chart

[02:33:29.850 --> 02:33:37.870]
American titles back again and set the finest star, Dumbled Man has gone, he's been the trunk of someone's car

[02:33:37.870 --> 02:33:46.330]
I'm hoping for controversy before it's all gone, other than that one-lake song, where's Kelly Clarkson?

[02:33:46.330 --> 02:33:55.410]
From 15 to 560 WQAM, here's a fast from Gregory from Coral Springs who says, when was the last time we heard any Warren Zeva on on a crappy 1 to 2.7?

[02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:59.270]
Besides, where Wolves of London, how many hits did he have?

[02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:07.670]
Zeva on his battling for his life with lung cancer will not live much longer, unfortunately thanks to the shallow playlist of magic songs like lawyers, guns, and money

[02:34:07.670 --> 02:34:12.010]
Or we're Wolves of London, we'll never be heard in our market, 1 to 2.7 sucks it says here

[02:34:12.010 --> 02:34:13.390]
Absolutely correct

[02:34:13.390 --> 02:34:16.690]
That's what Gregory says, you got Warren Zeva on?

[02:34:17.170 --> 02:34:21.150]
Don't pay any attention to George, okay, because he's still all bad out of shape about the monkeys

[02:34:21.570 --> 02:34:23.750]
Did I say not to put him on there? I just had a question

[02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:26.530]
Did I say that you said that? Did you say that I said?

[02:34:26.810 --> 02:34:27.650]
Did he write it down?

[02:34:27.890 --> 02:34:29.090]
Yeah, well that's all accounts

[02:34:29.090 --> 02:34:32.090]
Don't start gettin' it, no wonder he's got stomach cramps

[02:34:33.390 --> 02:34:38.490]
Here's one of our chronic faxers, Jane, who says the band I doesn't get enough airplay is NOFX?

[02:34:39.310 --> 02:34:41.050]
What's that? I'm afraid to say that

[02:34:42.690 --> 02:34:43.710]
You know what that is?

[02:34:45.050 --> 02:34:45.770]
No, FX

[02:34:46.430 --> 02:34:47.170]
No, I don't know

[02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:51.230]
The only thing that's all one word, the only states I've heard them on is WKPX

[02:34:51.230 --> 02:34:53.050]
But they have some great songs like Sold Out

[02:34:53.050 --> 02:34:55.110]
Please play this song in a radio and that's why I love her

[02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:56.790]
Oh yeah, we know those don't we?

[02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:59.430]
More season on the performer doesn't get played enough

[02:34:59.430 --> 02:35:01.010]
They might be giants, it's great

[02:35:01.010 --> 02:35:03.770]
You gotta check them out, the only reason you know them is because they get virtually no airplay

[02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:07.990]
See it's kinda hard to figure out who these groups are unless you see videos

[02:35:07.990 --> 02:35:10.650]
And there are in America no channels that play videos

[02:35:10.650 --> 02:35:12.150]
MTV don't play any videos

[02:35:12.690 --> 02:35:15.450]
Much music though, they got infomercials all morning long

[02:35:15.450 --> 02:35:19.550]
Did you ever hear that song, Istanbul was one's kind of to know of Constantinople?

[02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:21.230]
Yeah, that's they might be giants

[02:35:21.230 --> 02:35:23.870]
Oh, they're pretty good, considering

[02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:27.810]
See, oh when I'm in Europe I see all of that stuff because they're 80 million music video channels

[02:35:27.810 --> 02:35:30.830]
I know it's a very revolutionary concept

[02:35:30.830 --> 02:35:32.890]
But all day long they play music videos

[02:35:33.410 --> 02:35:33.770]
Yeah

[02:35:34.950 --> 02:35:38.370]
Which is why I bring back a lot of songs that you'll hear here like six months later

[02:35:38.370 --> 02:35:39.250]
Maybe never hear them here

[02:35:40.110 --> 02:35:42.790]
I remember listening to KPX in the early 1990s she says

[02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:45.050]
And the kids were playing all the songs that Zaid eventually switched to

[02:35:45.050 --> 02:35:47.410]
Like Nirvana's smashing pumpkins and Jane's addiction

[02:35:47.410 --> 02:35:49.950]
I still listen to KPX here, what's popular with the kids?

[02:35:49.950 --> 02:35:51.170]
And yes, I know they play crap too

[02:35:51.170 --> 02:35:53.250]
But sometimes they have really good new music

[02:35:53.250 --> 02:35:54.570]
You won't hear on Zaid for months or years

[02:35:54.570 --> 02:35:58.470]
And Jane also says PS, takebackthamedia.org has a campaign against Rush

[02:35:58.470 --> 02:36:00.030]
I haven't seen that but if it's true

[02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:02.170]
If it's a campaign to get them off the air, shame on them

[02:36:02.590 --> 02:36:06.170]
If it's a campaign to debunk all the crap that he's spews on here, more power to them

[02:36:06.170 --> 02:36:07.110]
See, there's a big difference

[02:36:08.550 --> 02:36:10.890]
You can disagree, you can criticize, that's fine

[02:36:10.890 --> 02:36:14.390]
But to say you don't have a right to be on because your opinion don't agree with ours or whoever

[02:36:14.390 --> 02:36:15.350]
That's bull crap

[02:36:15.350 --> 02:36:17.950]
Or to try to do it under the guys of some other bull crap

[02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:18.950]
Unacceptable

[02:36:21.170 --> 02:36:25.750]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[02:36:25.750 --> 02:36:28.350]
Rock groups that don't get played enough on radio south here

[02:36:28.350 --> 02:36:31.150]
Which in South Florida, which could be just about anybody

[02:36:31.670 --> 02:36:32.470]
Anybody good?

[02:36:34.130 --> 02:36:36.430]
That's one thing that very few people will disagree with me on

[02:36:36.430 --> 02:36:38.750]
Is that the music on FM in this market is so bad

[02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:41.810]
It's enough to make you want to take your radio and smash it with a ball penis hammer

[02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:46.870]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life, 365 votes

[02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:48.690]
Could be a lot better, 64

[02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:52.290]
Okay, 62 could be better, 57

[02:36:52.930 --> 02:36:53.890]
Sensational 56

[02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.950]
Solo 36

[02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:57.870]
Something in the past 32

[02:36:57.870 --> 02:36:59.630]
Non-existent 31

[02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:01.830]
Carlis nodded a couple of times

[02:37:01.830 --> 02:37:04.010]
Not existent 31, week 15

[02:37:04.010 --> 02:37:06.610]
And I'm desperate 12, he's nodding again

[02:37:07.190 --> 02:37:07.990]
Desperate 12

[02:37:08.970 --> 02:37:11.130]
This crazy rye, I wasn't really that good last night, huh?

[02:37:11.650 --> 02:37:13.430]
He was making some pretty solid inroads, I thought

[02:37:13.430 --> 02:37:14.030]
With Fat Boy?

[02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:16.490]
Or Miguel

[02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:18.130]
Fat Boy wasn't there

[02:37:18.130 --> 02:37:19.850]
Fat Boy wasn't there, no one here

[02:37:20.490 --> 02:37:21.970]
No, one of you tell me you had such a good time

[02:37:21.970 --> 02:37:23.410]
What was Wendy Graber doing there?

[02:37:23.590 --> 02:37:25.110]
He brought the tickets we were giving away

[02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.810]
I see

[02:37:26.490 --> 02:37:27.570]
That's a good excuse for him to show up

[02:37:27.570 --> 02:37:27.870]
He did, yeah sure

[02:37:30.470 --> 02:37:32.470]
Don't ever trust those guys with the ponytails

[02:37:32.470 --> 02:37:33.970]
Okay, just remember I told you that

[02:37:34.530 --> 02:37:36.650]
Always the horniest, the most dangerous

[02:37:37.330 --> 02:37:38.610]
Do anything that moves

[02:37:39.370 --> 02:37:40.850]
What do you mean that look?

[02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:43.510]
How many guys with ponytails do we know?

[02:37:44.050 --> 02:37:44.690]
Jeff Cohen

[02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:45.050]
Right

[02:37:46.410 --> 02:37:47.210]
And Woody

[02:37:47.210 --> 02:37:48.170]
Woody Graber

[02:37:48.970 --> 02:37:49.770]
Anybody else?

[02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:51.150]
Mitch Lewis used to have a pony tail

[02:37:51.150 --> 02:37:52.270]
But he cut it and they chopped it off

[02:37:52.270 --> 02:37:52.830]
Not no more

[02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:55.250]
So we know two guys with ponytails

[02:37:55.250 --> 02:37:56.650]
And they're both like real preverts

[02:37:58.490 --> 02:38:00.230]
Here's the facts from Wally and Deerfield

[02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:01.930]
Who says Bush wore a spin in propaganda

[02:38:02.690 --> 02:38:04.470]
And this is from the independent UK

[02:38:05.890 --> 02:38:06.290]
Okay

[02:38:07.050 --> 02:38:07.450]
UK

[02:38:08.390 --> 02:38:10.450]
We are denuged with more threats from Washington

[02:38:10.450 --> 02:38:12.250]
About states that sponsored terror

[02:38:12.250 --> 02:38:14.830]
Washington journalist play a leading role in this propaganda

[02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:17.170]
Take Eric Schmidt in New York Times a week ago

[02:38:17.170 --> 02:38:18.550]
Wait until you hear this mid he wrote

[02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:21.190]
He wrote a story about America's decision to confront countries

[02:38:21.190 --> 02:38:23.150]
That sponsored terrorism and his sources

[02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:25.990]
Senior defense officials, administration officials,

[02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:28.690]
Some American intelligence officials, the officials,

[02:38:29.070 --> 02:38:32.590]
Officials, military officials, terrorist experts, and defense officials

[02:38:33.250 --> 02:38:35.950]
Why not just let the Pentagon write its own reports in New York Times

[02:38:35.950 --> 02:38:37.350]
But that's what's changing

[02:38:37.350 --> 02:38:40.790]
More and more Americans were that the president declined the service company in Vietnam

[02:38:41.190 --> 02:38:43.970]
Realized that their newspapers are lying to them and acting as a conduit

[02:38:43.970 --> 02:38:44.930]
For the US government alone

[02:38:45.390 --> 02:38:48.090]
More and more Britons are tired of being told to go to war by their newspapers

[02:38:48.090 --> 02:38:49.750]
And TV stations and politicians

[02:38:50.510 --> 02:38:53.730]
Indeed I've guessed that far more Britons are represented today by the policies of President

[02:38:53.730 --> 02:38:55.950]
Shirokha France than the Prime Minister Blair Britton

[02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:58.310]
It says, in a story in the British UK independent

[02:38:59.930 --> 02:39:00.650]
Dream Theater

[02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:03.110]
What?

[02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:06.630]
I'm saying these groups and you're like, he's looking at me like, why?

[02:39:07.090 --> 02:39:10.850]
It says this group and other bands would something be blown away

[02:39:11.830 --> 02:39:13.110]
I can't read the facts

[02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.850]
It'll make you afraid

[02:39:14.270 --> 02:39:17.470]
KPX has signaled it in crap out like a year ago and I don't know what happened yet

[02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:21.030]
Yeah, probably got knocked off the air by the right wing

[02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:24.970]
You know all those subversives at KPX all those little punks?

[02:39:25.010 --> 02:39:25.930]
Our signal is better

[02:39:26.390 --> 02:39:26.790]
Oh!

[02:39:27.730 --> 02:39:29.250]
Our signal is better than anybody?

[02:39:29.430 --> 02:39:31.050]
Our signal on 441 sounds better

[02:39:31.890 --> 02:39:35.250]
Our signal doesn't, you can't complain about our signal on 441, it's non-existent

[02:39:35.250 --> 02:39:37.930]
I'm coming back from the track last night which I didn't want to go to by the way

[02:39:37.930 --> 02:39:40.030]
I'm coming back home and any K with a...

[02:39:40.030 --> 02:39:40.930]
Ruhu-what?

[02:39:41.810 --> 02:39:42.570]
You know like that

[02:39:43.490 --> 02:39:46.910]
I didn't have to worry about hearing the Leafs game before I could check the tape that I made

[02:39:46.910 --> 02:39:49.370]
I didn't have to worry about catching the score before I saw the outcome

[02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:50.910]
because I couldn't understand it anyway

[02:39:52.390 --> 02:39:55.150]
It's a miracle that we got anybody listening because you can't hear this thing

[02:39:55.150 --> 02:39:57.110]
But we can go 50,000 watts!

[02:39:57.510 --> 02:39:57.830]
Haha!

[02:39:58.390 --> 02:40:00.110]
I always think I got a sense of humor that Greg or what?

[02:40:00.510 --> 02:40:01.470]
How about Jack Elliott?

[02:40:03.210 --> 02:40:03.850]
Velvet Underground

[02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:05.770]
Velvet Underground?

[02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:06.870]
Wall of Voodoo

[02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.830]
They had...

[02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:09.810]
Carlos is right down that hit

[02:40:09.810 --> 02:40:10.650]
What did that wall of Voodoo do?

[02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:12.570]
And the Almond Brothers

[02:40:12.570 --> 02:40:14.450]
Oh that's what somebody called yesterday the Almond Brothers

[02:40:14.450 --> 02:40:15.050]
They had what?

[02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:17.350]
Wall of Voodoo had like one and a half hits

[02:40:17.350 --> 02:40:17.730]
Yeah

[02:40:17.730 --> 02:40:19.430]
What about Buffalo Springfield?

[02:40:19.890 --> 02:40:21.090]
Don't you want to hear all their hits?

[02:40:22.030 --> 02:40:23.090]
I've heard it

[02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:24.950]
I don't want to hear it again

[02:40:26.190 --> 02:40:27.710]
And I guarantee it's in this room

[02:40:27.710 --> 02:40:29.750]
It's in this room somewhere for what it's worth but

[02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:32.790]
There's something going down

[02:40:33.810 --> 02:40:35.330]
And it looks kind of brown

[02:40:36.430 --> 02:40:38.170]
And I think Carlos has something to do with it

[02:40:38.170 --> 02:40:40.290]
Anyway so there's I don't know put whatever you want on there

[02:40:40.290 --> 02:40:41.610]
We got 50 million of many huh?

[02:40:42.130 --> 02:40:44.090]
So another one of those lists that will go on too long

[02:40:44.090 --> 02:40:46.590]
This is like the businesses that went out of business you know?

[02:40:46.910 --> 02:40:48.170]
There's just two damn many

[02:40:49.050 --> 02:40:51.310]
It's about a 17-year-old partner

[02:40:52.710 --> 02:40:54.290]
Sugar Rescue can make you hungry

[02:40:54.290 --> 02:40:57.510]
Isn't this what I've always told you and finally I got it in my hand?

[02:40:58.570 --> 02:41:01.830]
This is from the herald no less so that might possibly be some truth

[02:41:02.710 --> 02:41:05.850]
Just in time for the crunch and munch of Girl Scout cookie sales

[02:41:05.850 --> 02:41:08.970]
A new study is linking sugar consumption with how much Americans eat

[02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:13.710]
And you know what that is that's called the Jane's Addiction to refine carbohydrates

[02:41:15.310 --> 02:41:17.110]
How many years have been screaming about that?

[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:17.450]
100

[02:41:17.450 --> 02:41:19.990]
And I'm going to the track and eating banana split layer cake

[02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:21.450]
I'll put fat rich

[02:41:21.450 --> 02:41:23.430]
Ask me if I wanted to go to the track last night

[02:41:23.430 --> 02:41:23.850]
Did you want to know?

[02:41:24.870 --> 02:41:28.270]
Pause a minute before you gobble up the thin-mintered chocolate smudged all about

[02:41:28.270 --> 02:41:29.290]
What's that?

[02:41:30.250 --> 02:41:30.870]
What's it all about?

[02:41:32.110 --> 02:41:32.850]
It's about like...

[02:41:33.370 --> 02:41:34.110]
No what is it all about?

[02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.910]
No top there's eight

[02:41:34.910 --> 02:41:35.430]
I don't know

[02:41:35.430 --> 02:41:38.070]
A chocolate smudged all about?

[02:41:38.890 --> 02:41:42.190]
You'll eat one but you won't stop there before you know maybe the entire pack is this free

[02:41:42.190 --> 02:41:44.390]
This is my life right here!

[02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:48.410]
I finally found it and we're sitting here busy arguing about the frickin' monkeys

[02:41:48.410 --> 02:41:50.970]
And Jane's Addiction and the wall of DUDO

[02:41:51.750 --> 02:41:53.150]
Oh my god

[02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:56.170]
Researchers say there's a good reason for that

[02:41:56.170 --> 02:41:58.010]
And we're not just talking about a lack of willpower

[02:41:58.010 --> 02:41:58.430]
See?

[02:41:59.510 --> 02:42:01.430]
Sitting in there called me a fat slob

[02:42:01.430 --> 02:42:03.210]
With no restraints

[02:42:03.210 --> 02:42:06.390]
We're talking about the paradox of a nature's sugar

[02:42:06.390 --> 02:42:10.250]
And of that whole delicious family of simple and readily digested carbohydrates

[02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:12.890]
That make up a hefty proportion of American diets

[02:42:13.430 --> 02:42:15.130]
You eat them, they make you hungry

[02:42:15.130 --> 02:42:15.810]
Oh!

[02:42:17.610 --> 02:42:19.650]
I've been screaming about this for years

[02:42:20.930 --> 02:42:23.410]
You eat stuff and it makes you hungry

[02:42:24.730 --> 02:42:26.450]
Hungry or some science is contendent

[02:42:26.450 --> 02:42:29.510]
And you were before you wolf down those thinments or that candy bar

[02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:31.850]
Or those crackers made a refined white flour

[02:42:31.850 --> 02:42:33.970]
Or that 60 ounce bottle of soda with sugar

[02:42:33.970 --> 02:42:35.590]
Or those slices of white bread

[02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:37.150]
Or potatoes

[02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:39.690]
Yes we've been talking baked russet potatoes here

[02:42:39.690 --> 02:42:40.690]
Tim russered potatoes

[02:42:41.570 --> 02:42:43.830]
So what do you do? You reach for more of course it says

[02:42:43.830 --> 02:42:44.490]
That's right

[02:42:44.490 --> 02:42:47.210]
These are known as high glycemic foods

[02:42:47.210 --> 02:42:48.430]
When eating without much else

[02:42:48.430 --> 02:42:51.090]
That's why I can only have three crispy cream donuts

[02:42:51.090 --> 02:42:53.990]
I can't eat it

[02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:55.450]
If you brought in one here

[02:42:55.450 --> 02:42:58.090]
When I finished with a one and you told me there were no more

[02:42:58.090 --> 02:42:59.450]
I'd start climbing on a wall

[02:42:59.450 --> 02:43:03.010]
I'd be like stamping my feet like a little child carrying on

[02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:05.690]
Like I was having sugar shockers

[02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:06.870]
I'm telling you

[02:43:08.050 --> 02:43:11.450]
But you don't have it obviously because you don't like anything sweet anyway

[02:43:11.450 --> 02:43:12.890]
You don't like anything

[02:43:13.430 --> 02:43:13.530]
Chocolate

[02:43:14.410 --> 02:43:15.950]
That's why you weigh about 14 pounds

[02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:18.870]
That's why he's the only person I've ever met in my life can be than the sink

[02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:23.790]
I will say Moa to even his advanced age must have good eyesight to find your balls

[02:43:24.810 --> 02:43:27.410]
These are known as high glycemic foods

[02:43:27.410 --> 02:43:28.830]
When eating without much else

[02:43:28.830 --> 02:43:31.210]
They tend to cause spikes in our blood sugar right

[02:43:31.950 --> 02:43:34.290]
And that's some sign to say triggers a chain of events that causes

[02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:38.130]
Discacl between intense hunger and trips to the snack machine

[02:43:39.210 --> 02:43:42.710]
Americans are chowing down on larger and larger amounts of high glycemic foods

[02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:46.190]
Not just around girls cut us out cookie sale time but all year long right

[02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:50.210]
A New York Times best seller sugar busters with ads crap

[02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:53.570]
And the recent release of latest edition of the new glucose revolution

[02:43:53.570 --> 02:43:56.850]
Oh, I have another book to read while I'm watching down

[02:43:56.850 --> 02:43:57.730]
Some crap

[02:43:58.170 --> 02:44:00.890]
Are among several books promoting diets with low glycemic levels

[02:44:00.890 --> 02:44:03.690]
Although nutritionists have said not enough studies have been done to prove that I

[02:44:03.690 --> 02:44:04.830]
In other words, they don't know anything

[02:44:05.510 --> 02:44:09.750]
But this whole business about this refined carbohydrate edition

[02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:14.090]
I've been screaming, I've been squealing, yelling, pleating, begging

[02:44:14.090 --> 02:44:16.550]
At least maybe you can't help me to do something about it

[02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:18.530]
But at least admit that that's what the problem is

[02:44:19.730 --> 02:44:22.310]
You eat this crap and instead of satisfying your hunger

[02:44:22.310 --> 02:44:25.010]
Instead of passing on, well I just have a little something that will carry me through there

[02:44:25.010 --> 02:44:25.550]
No wrong

[02:44:25.550 --> 02:44:27.850]
Well, it'll make you want more

[02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:30.110]
And you'll have lots more

[02:44:31.350 --> 02:44:32.230]
Don't you like more?

[02:44:32.570 --> 02:44:33.230]
Oh yeah

[02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:33.970]
Yes, you know what I'm saying?

[02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:34.670]
In every

[02:44:35.330 --> 02:44:35.750]
Smoars

[02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:37.730]
The real ones, smored flavored

[02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:38.130]
Right

[02:44:38.730 --> 02:44:39.270]
Top tarts

[02:44:39.270 --> 02:44:41.390]
How about Ben and Jerry Smoars ice cream?

[02:44:41.470 --> 02:44:42.550]
Smoars ice cream?

[02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:42.650]

[02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:43.670]
Who likes that?

[02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:44.610]
Somebody likes good?

[02:44:44.670 --> 02:44:45.070]
Yeah, that's good

[02:44:45.070 --> 02:44:46.290]
Smoars ice cream?

[02:44:46.290 --> 02:44:47.250]
Mmm, and graham crackers

[02:44:47.250 --> 02:44:48.910]
I love anything with marshmallows in it, you know?

[02:44:49.010 --> 02:44:49.130]
Yeah

[02:44:49.130 --> 02:44:50.170]
Except the course of...

[02:44:50.170 --> 02:44:50.590]
Back to the test!

[02:44:50.670 --> 02:44:51.450]
That's your territory

[02:44:51.450 --> 02:44:54.190]
Well, you put the marshmallow on top, not in it

[02:44:57.150 --> 02:44:58.470]
It's a topping after all

[02:44:58.890 --> 02:45:01.190]
Why aren't you talking before about those chocolate covered cherries?

[02:45:03.370 --> 02:45:04.550]
26 past noon

[02:45:06.350 --> 02:45:07.430]
Don't even go there

[02:45:08.070 --> 02:45:08.430]
Girlfriend

[02:45:08.430 --> 02:45:09.570]
Don't go there, boyfriend

[02:45:10.130 --> 02:45:10.490]
Girlfriend

[02:45:11.650 --> 02:45:13.490]
Another day's gone by and a lot of you guys out there

[02:45:13.490 --> 02:45:15.250]

Torgasms, I fake warplug

[02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:11.190]
Coming up tonight, on inside of the hind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[02:46:11.190 --> 02:46:14.850]
We take a good, hard, stiff look into stardom

[02:46:14.850 --> 02:46:19.350]
They were controversial, cross-dressing heavy metal rock and rollers

[02:46:19.350 --> 02:46:23.250]
They were Jerry Fowell and Jimmy Swaggerd

[02:46:23.250 --> 02:46:26.550]
No, wait, sorry, they were twisted sisters

[02:46:26.830 --> 02:46:32.870]
Oh, when I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna go home

[02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:35.790]
I can't believe people were threatened by me

[02:46:35.790 --> 02:46:38.230]
Twisted Sister Frontman, D. Snyder

[02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:43.430]
I mean, even with the makeup, I made about the ugliest damn woman in the damn universe

[02:46:43.430 --> 02:46:45.810]
Hell, I would never have f***ed me

[02:46:45.810 --> 02:46:49.190]
And yet, for some reason, the band's simple message

[02:46:49.190 --> 02:46:52.770]
Adults suck, school sucks, religion sucks

[02:46:52.770 --> 02:46:56.470]
In fact, everything sucks, except buying twisted sister records

[02:46:56.470 --> 02:46:58.630]
Was troubling to America's parents

[02:46:58.630 --> 02:47:00.830]
In a 1985 senate hearing

[02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:02.990]
Tegor, lashed out at the band

[02:47:02.990 --> 02:47:06.690]
As a woman who's had a stick up her lily white ass for years

[02:47:06.690 --> 02:47:09.570]
And hasn't gotten any decent oral effects from anybody

[02:47:09.570 --> 02:47:10.330]
Ever

[02:47:10.970 --> 02:47:15.050]
I feel uniquely qualified to tell other people how they should live

[02:47:15.050 --> 02:47:16.910]
But D. Snyder's proudest moment

[02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:21.690]
Can when US military forces moved into house manual Norega from the embassy in Panama

[02:47:21.690 --> 02:47:26.110]
As a punishment, they blasted the music of twisted sister at him

[02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:34.810]
Then President George Bush, senior, explains the decision

[02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:38.550]
As a man who's had a stick up his lily white ass for years

[02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:41.610]
And hasn't gotten any decent oral sex from anybody

[02:47:41.610 --> 02:47:42.290]
Ever

[02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:46.810]
I feel uniquely qualified to tell other people how they should live

[02:47:46.810 --> 02:47:48.530]
Twisted Sister

[02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:51.170]
They were the people your parents warned you about

[02:47:51.170 --> 02:47:54.910]
If your parents warned you about fat ugly freaks with no talent

[02:47:55.730 --> 02:47:59.350]
It's a big, juicy sobbing with look at your business tonight

[02:47:59.350 --> 02:48:00.710]

1232-560-2M

[02:48:02.770 --> 02:48:05.470]
Don't forget when you hear the Jim Manis and Angover show today

[02:48:05.470 --> 02:48:07.030]
When you hear the sound of a hockey goal

[02:48:09.870 --> 02:48:12.530]
When you hear the sound of a hockey goal

[02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:14.810]
Be the fifth caller to the contest line

1-800-227-560 to win a pair of tickets to a Panther's home game

[02:48:21.370 --> 02:48:24.470]
And you'll be qualified to win tickets to the NHL All-Star game on Sunday

[02:48:24.470 --> 02:48:27.050]
Where they got a few stars playing and a whole bunch of nuts

[02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:29.610]
Here's one that says if you put down Logan's and Messina

[02:48:29.610 --> 02:48:31.730]
I didn't put them down, I said they were...

[02:48:31.730 --> 02:48:32.590]
Oh, so you...

[02:48:32.590 --> 02:48:34.870]
I understand what it's so when you just...

[02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:35.310]
God...

[02:48:35.310 --> 02:48:35.450]
What?

[02:48:36.130 --> 02:48:39.850]
If you put down Logan's and Messina, then you must put down seals and crafts

[02:48:40.650 --> 02:48:43.270]
Summer breeze between your knees

[02:48:43.270 --> 02:48:44.370]
I'm in trouble

[02:48:44.370 --> 02:48:45.770]
I like Diamond Girl

[02:48:45.770 --> 02:48:46.870]
About three times

[02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:48.250]
I don't want to hear it again

[02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:50.110]
Well, that's to think with the monkeys

[02:48:50.530 --> 02:48:52.470]
No, I want to hear the monkeys again

[02:48:53.550 --> 02:48:54.350]
Play it

[02:48:54.350 --> 02:48:55.890]
I don't have time to look for it

[02:48:57.090 --> 02:48:57.490]
Although...

[02:48:57.490 --> 02:48:58.350]
Emerson Lekken Palmer

[02:48:59.350 --> 02:48:59.750]
Okay

[02:48:59.750 --> 02:49:00.450]
And Asia

[02:49:00.450 --> 02:49:02.890]
Now, why are you still writing this stuff down?

[02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.550]
He's not...

[02:49:03.550 --> 02:49:04.910]
Oh, good. He's writing other things down

[02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:05.950]
Like what?

[02:49:06.270 --> 02:49:08.190]
Neal Sucks, I did all this work for nothing

[02:49:08.190 --> 02:49:09.290]
Why do I do this?

[02:49:09.330 --> 02:49:10.350]
I'm not doing this pull

[02:49:11.070 --> 02:49:13.050]
Now, I don't want people to feel that I conned them

[02:49:13.050 --> 02:49:15.650]
Because I try not to do that on the show as far as the polls are concerned

[02:49:15.650 --> 02:49:16.750]
Most of everything else I do

[02:49:16.750 --> 02:49:19.470]
But, it's inane

[02:49:20.050 --> 02:49:21.810]
Because as we're going along here, we realize

[02:49:21.810 --> 02:49:23.430]
See, we all agree on one thing

[02:49:23.430 --> 02:49:25.030]
The music on F-Amy here blows

[02:49:25.030 --> 02:49:27.470]
In fact, here's the fact that it says where the hell is it?

[02:49:28.170 --> 02:49:30.210]
That it's the worst in the history of the human race

[02:49:30.210 --> 02:49:30.830]
And you're right

[02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:31.710]
You're absolutely right

[02:49:31.710 --> 02:49:32.150]
Here it is

[02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:33.370]
From a record guy

[02:49:33.370 --> 02:49:34.730]
Somebody in the music business

[02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:35.970]
Who had real big fish

[02:49:35.970 --> 02:49:38.090]
And mighty, mighty boss tones and sublime

[02:49:38.690 --> 02:49:39.870]
He says, I'm in the music business

[02:49:39.870 --> 02:49:42.190]
The music in this market is the worst ever played crap around

[02:49:42.190 --> 02:49:43.330]
In the history, you're right

[02:49:43.330 --> 02:49:43.930]
Michael?

[02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.850]
Absolutely right

[02:49:44.850 --> 02:49:46.110]
So, the point being

[02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:49.330]
That we could name just about every group that anybody likes

[02:49:49.330 --> 02:49:50.770]
And you'll never hear it

[02:49:50.770 --> 02:49:51.270]
Right

[02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:53.650]
Which is why I don't listen to FM

[02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:55.630]
Because the music in this market is the worst

[02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.790]
It's swell

[02:49:58.410 --> 02:49:58.770]
Garbysh

[02:49:58.770 --> 02:49:59.690]
So I didn't look at the dirty look

[02:49:59.690 --> 02:50:00.770]
He goes out of corner of his eye

[02:50:00.770 --> 02:50:01.530]
I can't be a dirty look

[02:50:02.290 --> 02:50:04.290]
Yeah, because he's frantically writing stuff

[02:50:04.290 --> 02:50:06.110]
That, look, at least he kept you in the chair

[02:50:06.110 --> 02:50:08.150]
And from going out and doing all that magic

[02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:09.530]
Do-do-do-doodoo, whatever you're doing

[02:50:09.530 --> 02:50:10.830]
Ooh, voodoo-do-do-do-do

[02:50:10.830 --> 02:50:12.010]
And smoking a limb faggot

[02:50:12.590 --> 02:50:16.090]
And if that's probably why he's there doing magic do-do-do

[02:50:16.090 --> 02:50:17.270]
He's smoking in those cancers

[02:50:17.270 --> 02:50:18.630]
Because he's chained smoking the packs

[02:50:18.630 --> 02:50:19.950]
Not just the individual ones

[02:50:19.950 --> 02:50:21.390]
He's got the packs lined up

[02:50:21.390 --> 02:50:22.370]
He just likes the whole thing

[02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:25.150]
Dio

[02:50:25.150 --> 02:50:25.990]
Dockin

[02:50:25.990 --> 02:50:26.890]
Oh, dockin

[02:50:27.650 --> 02:50:28.430]
White snake

[02:50:29.070 --> 02:50:30.610]
This is definitely from Woody Graber

[02:50:30.610 --> 02:50:31.670]
And Iron Maiden

[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:32.890]
Okay, whatever you say

[02:50:32.890 --> 02:50:33.970]
Here's some more

[02:50:33.970 --> 02:50:35.670]
Leon Russell and the Shelter People

[02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:36.810]
11 Spoonful

[02:50:38.090 --> 02:50:39.410]
Oh, is he still dead by the way?

[02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:43.030]
Now, why do I- you gotta be careful, John Sebastian

[02:50:44.210 --> 02:50:44.550]
died

[02:50:45.270 --> 02:50:47.250]
Or is it- no, it wasn't John, it wasn't John's death

[02:50:47.250 --> 02:50:47.390]
No, it wasn't John's death

[02:50:47.390 --> 02:50:49.190]
Jeff from the- I'm Amazon and Papa's it was John

[02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:51.270]
Papa John, I'm bigger friend

[02:50:51.270 --> 02:50:52.070]
Papa John

[02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.490]
Pizza

[02:50:56.230 --> 02:50:58.730]
See, that's where my mind is now that got this in the article

[02:50:59.830 --> 02:51:00.510]
Yeah, Philip

[02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.990]
She's trick

[02:51:00.990 --> 02:51:04.150]
I know what his- I know Michelle, Philips and Papa John

[02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:06.350]
And all those glam I know who those people are

[02:51:06.350 --> 02:51:07.870]
And Mama Cass with a ham sandwich

[02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:08.830]
See, there's more food

[02:51:09.850 --> 02:51:12.030]
It's your fault, you're the one that got me start with this food crap

[02:51:12.810 --> 02:51:15.990]
And we're talking about that dim- what was it?

[02:51:16.150 --> 02:51:18.530]
Oh, that's right, the hot pugs on there with the chocolate with the cherries

[02:51:19.630 --> 02:51:20.950]
And then of course the s'mores

[02:51:23.130 --> 02:51:25.070]
Yeah, we have- how come we don't hear no more s'mores?

[02:51:27.690 --> 02:51:28.750]
5, 6, 7, oh

[02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:58.730]

You know, there are so few good places out in western Brown, I mean, it's really sad, at least in the acres is very rare unless you like Denny's a lot, you know? And how many times can you eat that grand slam? So anyway, if you want to take out or delivery in plantation and that's the location of the Sunrise right beyond Walgreens, 954-382-1999, the good news for us is it's the same great delicious fresh food, cook the order, the same low prices, and the same friendly fast service. Pizza lock 954-382-1999, the plantation location on the Nabil and Sunrise,

[02:56:43.330 --> 02:56:49.290]

[02:57:13.330 --> 02:57:19.010]
I'm selling so high, and you're down close, and then head my giski's hard-twisted view.

[02:57:22.390 --> 02:57:32.370]

From 46 to 560 WQM, that's for Carlos who's had a little problem today.

[02:58:41.870 --> 02:58:44.470]
Here's a fact from Jean who just can't seem to get it right.

[02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:47.690]
Jean Rogers, no less, which I'm embarrassed that we share the same last name all at least

[02:58:47.690 --> 02:58:48.570]
hopefully yours is real.

[02:58:49.010 --> 02:58:51.910]
Don't forget, no OJ stories that are called 9.11 on last night.

[02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:54.390]
Ten o'clock right out of the box after 9 to 10 hours.

[02:58:54.490 --> 02:58:55.710]
What was our first story, George?

[02:58:56.170 --> 02:58:56.610]
OJ.

[02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.950]
OJ.

[02:58:58.130 --> 02:58:58.130]

[02:58:58.870 --> 02:59:00.030]
Thanks Jean, but as usual.

[02:59:01.170 --> 02:59:02.370]
Several hours late and short.

[02:59:02.690 --> 02:59:03.570]
This is really good.

Freedom Flour.

I don't have time to be the whole thing that goes along with it,

[02:59:15.270 --> 02:59:17.690]
but nevertheless, they're distributing these for people that have got a brain.

[02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:19.710]
800 bombs on Baghdad.

[02:59:20.650 --> 02:59:23.690]
The Pentagon is planning to fire 800 cruise missiles on Baghdad

[02:59:23.690 --> 02:59:25.070]
in the first two days of the war on Iraq.

[02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:27.710]
One cruise missile can destroy battleship or a large building.

[02:59:28.050 --> 02:59:31.670]
800 missiles are more than double the number of the US used against Iraq and all of the Gulf War.

[02:59:32.150 --> 02:59:35.850]
Most importantly, there are five million innocent civilians living in Baghdad today.

[02:59:36.210 --> 02:59:37.350]
The carnage will be unreal.

[02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:39.530]
The plan is called shock and awe.

[02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:42.750]
One Pentagon official suggested it would be like nuclear weapons at Hiroshima.

[02:59:43.370 --> 02:59:45.950]
CBS News reported all this on January 24th.

[02:59:46.930 --> 02:59:50.710]
Any American who witnessed the events of 9.11 can relate to the terrible concept of shock and awe.

[02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:52.430]
When civilians are targeted deliberately,

[02:59:52.430 --> 02:59:55.750]
when their bodies are smashed and left to gush their lifeblood into the dust of the street,

[02:59:55.990 --> 02:59:57.990]
we're all diminished and discussed and horrified.

[02:59:58.510 --> 03:00:00.830]
Ask yourself if you wish to be parted into this kind of action,

[03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:04.490]
taking against the city of civilians who had nothing whatsoever to do with the 9.11 attacks,

[03:00:04.810 --> 03:00:08.190]
finally, consider the very real fact that such a deliberate attack in civilians

[03:00:08.190 --> 03:00:10.650]
will definitely motivate all those terrorists we still haven't caught

[03:00:10.650 --> 03:00:14.950]
because we're spending so much time on Iraq to attack us here at home again.

[03:00:16.550 --> 03:00:17.290]
Think about it.

[03:00:17.370 --> 03:00:19.150]
Here in America, we believe in freedom and equality.

[03:00:19.150 --> 03:00:22.410]
We also have the propagated name Patriot Act, which allows federal officers

[03:00:22.410 --> 03:00:24.070]
to enter your home without warrant or notice,

[03:00:24.370 --> 03:00:25.890]
which allows them to tap your phone and email,

[03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:28.310]
which allows them to collect every bit of personal information available

[03:00:28.310 --> 03:00:30.670]
and place it away total information and wear this database

[03:00:30.670 --> 03:00:32.130]
to be managed by the Department of Defense.

[03:00:32.690 --> 03:00:34.090]
Here in America, we respect life.

[03:00:34.390 --> 03:00:36.230]
We also prepare for war against the nation that,

[03:00:36.350 --> 03:00:38.010]
while ruled by a terrible despot,

[03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:39.470]
is done nothing to threaten or harm us.

[03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:42.950]
War against Iraq will kill tens of thousands of people, just like you and me.

[03:00:43.450 --> 03:00:45.270]
War against Iraq will bring more terrorism here.

[03:00:45.690 --> 03:00:47.930]
War against Iraq will kill hundreds of thousands of our soldiers

[03:00:47.930 --> 03:00:50.410]
and expose these surviving troops to terrible diseases,

[03:00:50.630 --> 03:00:53.390]
like Gulf War Syndrome, which fully disabled almost 30% of veterans

[03:00:53.390 --> 03:00:54.590]
from the last war over there.

[03:00:55.050 --> 03:00:56.730]
Here in America, we believe we can do good.

[03:00:57.010 --> 03:00:58.710]
Here in America, right now, we can do better.

[03:00:58.990 --> 03:01:00.850]
We must for our sake and for the sake of our children.

[03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:03.290]
How do you like that?

[03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:04.210]
I like it.

[03:01:04.370 --> 03:01:06.030]
Find more about these people in this so-thing,

[03:01:06.110 --> 03:01:08.530]
the Alliance for Democracy.org, ORG.

[03:01:11.930 --> 03:01:14.330]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:17.390]
Which of these statements best describes your sex life we asked today?

[03:01:18.010 --> 03:01:18.830]
434 votes.

[03:01:18.890 --> 03:01:20.490]
Could be a lot better, 76.

[03:01:21.430 --> 03:01:21.890]
Okay.

[03:01:22.210 --> 03:01:23.630]
Yeah, but wait a second.

[03:01:23.890 --> 03:01:24.250]
Wrong one.

[03:01:24.330 --> 03:01:24.650]
Come on, Phil.

[03:01:24.690 --> 03:01:25.010]
Okay.

[03:01:25.230 --> 03:01:25.450]
Thank you.

[03:01:25.650 --> 03:01:26.130]
75.

[03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:27.890]
Could be better, 71.

[03:01:28.430 --> 03:01:31.110]
Sensational 64, 14.7%.

[03:01:31.690 --> 03:01:32.530]
Solo 40.

[03:01:33.050 --> 03:01:34.070]
Non-existent 39.

[03:01:34.430 --> 03:01:35.650]
Something of the past 34.

[03:01:36.030 --> 03:01:36.630]
As in what?

[03:01:37.390 --> 03:01:39.150]
Week 20 and I'm desperate 15.

[03:01:39.530 --> 03:01:40.370]
So take a look at that.

[03:01:41.050 --> 03:01:41.470]
Okay.

[03:01:41.770 --> 03:01:44.370]
And sensational is like 31.

[03:01:45.450 --> 03:01:46.110]
What is it?

[03:01:47.210 --> 03:01:48.090]
About 31%.

[03:01:48.090 --> 03:01:49.410]
You know what percent that leaves for the rest?

[03:01:50.990 --> 03:01:51.390]
What?

[03:01:51.790 --> 03:01:52.230]
69.

[03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:55.090]
See, there he goes again.

[03:01:55.450 --> 03:01:56.210]
I learned it from George.

[03:01:56.330 --> 03:01:57.330]
So it's a blubble, blubble messages.

[03:01:58.730 --> 03:01:59.170]
69%.

[03:01:59.830 --> 03:02:05.090]
Over 31% and almost 69% are either like weak or non-existent or all alone in the corner.

[03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:08.870]
Sit and play in Jazeal on the Internet.

[03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:11.190]
Hi there, I'm Jazeal.

[03:02:11.430 --> 03:02:12.770]
I'm looking for a, what else?

[03:02:12.930 --> 03:02:14.390]
An 18-year-old young man.

[03:02:15.310 --> 03:02:20.290]
Who's really well built and muscular with a very fine, large firm number.

[03:02:21.350 --> 03:02:21.670]
Yeah.

[03:02:22.490 --> 03:02:23.330]
Or maybe it's like,

[03:02:23.470 --> 03:02:24.230]
Hi I'm Jazeal.

[03:02:24.330 --> 03:02:25.450]
I'm looking for like a 12-year-old.

[03:02:26.050 --> 03:02:27.750]
Anyway, there are a lot of those, man.

[03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:29.550]
A lot of those are on there.

[03:02:30.150 --> 03:02:31.710]
In fact, Mad Dog yesterday had a good point.

[03:02:31.830 --> 03:02:36.890]
That is if you took away the perverts and the, you know, the Internet, the chat rooms,

[03:02:37.150 --> 03:02:37.650]
the no life.

[03:02:38.070 --> 03:02:38.670]
And what was the other one?

[03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:39.730]
He said there were like three categories.

[03:02:40.190 --> 03:02:42.490]
And if it took them out of there, there wouldn't be much left.

[03:02:43.030 --> 03:02:45.390]
I mean, there's some good stuff on there, like that thing I just read.

[03:02:45.550 --> 03:02:46.970]
There's a lot of really good and interesting stuff.

[03:02:47.290 --> 03:02:50.810]
And the stuff we put on our website every day, the really juicy productive stuff there.

[03:02:50.870 --> 03:02:51.290]
Good stories.

[03:02:52.830 --> 03:02:54.010]
See, we give you a little bit of everything.

[03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:55.630]
We give you our goofy pool like that today.

[03:02:55.950 --> 03:02:58.430]
And then we give you some goofy pictures of us, which we can't do much better.

[03:02:58.850 --> 03:03:00.570]
And then we give you some good stories on there.

[03:03:01.470 --> 03:03:03.430]
Like for example, today, what do we got on there?

[03:03:03.730 --> 03:03:05.050]
And I don't do this off it enough.

[03:03:05.530 --> 03:03:07.190]
Because I wish more people to go to our website,

[03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:09.350]
which check out the bedtime stories on there,

[03:03:09.510 --> 03:03:11.810]
which you'll notice I'm not wasting everybody's time reading them on the air

[03:03:11.810 --> 03:03:12.750]
because it's ponderous.

[03:03:13.150 --> 03:03:16.870]
Let's see, the hanging gun from Richard Cohen.

[03:03:20.090 --> 03:03:23.290]
Our Burgers, fries and kebabs addictive, which is very much like a story.

[03:03:23.410 --> 03:03:27.350]
I'm reading since his daughter calls 911 to complain against him.

[03:03:28.550 --> 03:03:31.430]
Tell Jean Rogers that we had that sex survey.

[03:03:31.430 --> 03:03:33.450]
Are you average, which ties him with a pull we're taking?

[03:03:33.770 --> 03:03:35.490]
Bishop to appear in anti-war commercial.

[03:03:36.990 --> 03:03:37.670]
Web site.

[03:03:38.010 --> 03:03:42.150]
Web site meeting their finalist and bondage is bondage star, et cetera.

[03:03:43.010 --> 03:03:43.490]
Good stuff.

[03:03:43.570 --> 03:03:44.910]
We had some great ones on there yesterday.

[03:03:46.610 --> 03:03:48.690]
But a lot of people are just not going to read that stuff,

[03:03:48.690 --> 03:03:51.350]
which is all the more reason for me to sit here and read it on the air is like,

[03:03:51.430 --> 03:03:54.210]
you know, hearing this one little corner of the world that we're in,

[03:03:54.270 --> 03:03:54.930]
which ain't much.

[03:03:55.890 --> 03:03:58.150]
94 1 at 560 WQ AM.

[03:03:59.310 --> 03:04:00.230]
Your hair is gone.

[03:04:00.410 --> 03:04:01.110]
Let me tell you right now.

[03:04:01.150 --> 03:04:02.530]
There's only one intelligent thing to do.

[03:04:02.650 --> 03:04:03.790]
I mean, you can paste them on.

[03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:05.810]
You can get some crazy glume on there.

[03:04:07.050 --> 03:04:09.590]
Now it would be kind of cute like remember David Ferry had the eyebrows.

[03:04:09.830 --> 03:04:09.910]
Right.

[03:04:10.250 --> 03:04:10.770]
Sweep it up.

[03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:11.410]
Put it back on.

[03:04:11.610 --> 03:04:12.330]
Sweep it off the floor.

[03:04:12.390 --> 03:04:14.990]
Go into your neighborhood barbershop and pick up a whole crap load of hair.

[03:04:15.090 --> 03:04:16.250]
Don't even have to make match.

[03:04:16.850 --> 03:04:20.410]
And just crazy glute on your head or go see my good buddy Chuck Alphierry.

[03:04:20.470 --> 03:04:21.170]
He'll make you look great.

[03:04:21.470 --> 03:04:25.570]
All you guys have basically given up because your ball spot is ugly and gross and shiny

[03:04:25.570 --> 03:04:26.890]
and getting bigger and bigger.

[03:04:27.010 --> 03:04:27.870]
That's the only thing on your body.

[03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:29.250]
It's getting bigger up in your public.

[03:04:29.710 --> 03:04:31.010]
The answer for his Chuck Alphierry.

[03:04:31.090 --> 03:04:31.950]
He's got the latest technology.

[03:04:32.010 --> 03:04:34.490]
He's got the natural hairline system.

[03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:39.410]
For over 25 years, Charlie's been helping rich guys and guys in the middle and shleppers

[03:04:39.410 --> 03:04:40.190]
like most of you.

[03:04:40.450 --> 03:04:43.610]
Because no matter how much you want to spend, you can't get a better, more natural looking piece

[03:04:43.610 --> 03:04:45.190]
than Chuck's natural hairline system.

[03:04:45.450 --> 03:04:49.370]
And you have nothing to lose but that embarrassing ball spot because everybody gets Charlie's

[03:04:49.370 --> 03:04:50.290]
30 day guarantee.

[03:04:50.730 --> 03:04:54.150]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells, if your sex life doesn't go from

[03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:56.410]
weak to spec, tack it or Charlie give you a full refund.

[03:04:56.890 --> 03:04:59.370]
And if you mention the Arrogance, you get an extra 200 bucks off the regular price.

[03:04:59.750 --> 03:05:03.150]
And Charlie also services and repairs all kinds of hairsprings while you wait.

[03:05:03.150 --> 03:05:05.790]
It usually improves them tremendously for only 25 to 30 bucks.

[03:05:06.210 --> 03:05:08.750]
So if you really want to get your hair back, if you don't want holes in the head, if you

[03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:12.650]
want a dead animal on the top of your forehead, get the natural hairline system from the one

[03:05:12.650 --> 03:05:14.030]
and only, Charlie's Alphierry.

[03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:17.230]

[03:05:23.370 --> 03:05:24.970]
Live and local.

[03:05:25.450 --> 03:05:26.850]
We're Sports Radio 560s.

[03:05:27.510 --> 03:05:27.810]
You ain't.

[03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.890]
You ain't.

[03:05:28.890 --> 03:05:28.970]
You ain't.

[03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:33.110]
Isht with the sewer of this place.

[03:05:33.310 --> 03:05:34.970]
Did you see our ratings for the last book?

[03:05:35.310 --> 03:05:37.210]
Yeah, I know what that is.

[03:05:37.470 --> 03:05:37.810]
Sure.

[03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:39.390]
Could it possibly be us?

[03:05:40.470 --> 03:05:42.970]
What you're back to back before you won't wait for long.

[03:05:43.140 --> 03:05:45.940]
No more, no more, no more, no more, no more.

[03:05:45.960 --> 03:05:48.340]
What you're back to back before you won't wait for long.

[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.000]
No more.

[03:05:50.860 --> 03:05:51.740]
I got enough.

[03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:55.760]
I got to think about it on top of getting right there and I don't need a rating that's

[03:05:55.760 --> 03:05:56.460]
a minus eight.

[03:05:56.740 --> 03:06:01.120]
Don't care what you do longer than something that's got to wake a little hotter on the

[03:06:01.120 --> 03:06:02.060]
desk to your mom.

[03:06:02.460 --> 03:06:03.840]
A ruse of guts to go.

[03:06:04.660 --> 03:06:06.580]
There's a lot of fat producers, you know.

[03:06:06.920 --> 03:06:07.560]
That's right.

[03:06:07.640 --> 03:06:10.180]
What you're back to back before you won't wait for long.

[03:06:10.420 --> 03:06:12.140]
No more, no more, no more.

[03:06:12.740 --> 03:06:15.680]
What you're back to back before you won't wait for long.

[03:06:16.220 --> 03:06:16.220]

[03:06:18.160 --> 03:06:20.620]
God, gruddle, all that glove I don't understand.

[03:06:21.160 --> 03:06:23.620]
How you can eat from a truff while you was in both ends.

[03:06:23.940 --> 03:06:26.380]
You have things that much you made a rating school.

[03:06:26.880 --> 03:06:29.120]
You just like Clinton, it's all you are for.

[03:06:29.340 --> 03:06:31.160]
And it's straight, you fat ass out.

[03:06:31.760 --> 03:06:33.800]
Well, we'll take the food out of you now.
