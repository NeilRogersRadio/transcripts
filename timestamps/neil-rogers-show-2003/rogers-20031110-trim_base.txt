[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.960]
It's a stupid stupid move. I don't talk don't talk about it because nobody in this town cares about it

[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.780]
That's true. They care about football to which I would only say oh right. Yeah, well nice job

[00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.400]
Talk about picking up the ass, baby. I got back here Saturday just in time to see a doubled-beard piece of crap

So on the telecast Sunday from St. Louis Scott Melonby who was a good guy

[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.060]
He did the thing with a rat. He was the captain

[00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:01.740]
Ten minutes of the second period. Bapapapapa and so boring and he and Denise are Bapapa and in the meantime all these great plays and your goals and great saves

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.840]
And Rimmer is silent because they got Melonby whoever is producing that you're on Fox

[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.940]
You ought to be strung up with Hermann Gearing. Okay. You asshole. Yeah. What a piece of crap. Yeah

[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.940]
Did you see it? I saw the whole game every inch love

[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.700]
What kind of crap is that there were a lot of great plays going on there and Rimmer can't describe it because they got Melonby into these

[00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.720]
Potvan which is like the blind leading the blind

I picked it up for the hockey game. It's a piece of crap plus technically

[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.620]
I want to say right now as bad as our sales department is and they suck you know that I know that our engineering department could be the worst in the history

[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.180]
But even Marconi would be embarrassed. I know nothing in this room works. I know everything in here is a piece of crap

[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.700]

Miami has the dolphins there the worst football team

[00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:30.620]
They flub the ball from goal to goal like no one's ever seen. Oh there on the ground

[00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.820]
That's where they'll stay. They're never in control and when you say Miami

[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.500]

[00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.960]
Huh

[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:07.420]
They don't know how to tackle they don't know how to block no their coaches ought to tell them to but then they and their jocks

[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:14.280]
Then they would run much faster and even in defeat when we go to the stadium

[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.700]
We'll see Miami and they're the Miami dolphins

[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.020]

Miami has the dolphins but the dolphins have no fans just 50,000 assholes sitting in the stands

She calls his signals in Hebrew

[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.800]
The dolphins have no defense and their offense is a joke like George Bush eating pretzels

[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.880]
You know they're gonna choke

[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.340]
They'll always disappoint you when they're in a playoff race

[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:13.400]
With fewer points than parkmarks on high zingers that we face in there the Miami dolphins

[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.720]
Let me tell you right now and a Troy Stratford you weren't supposed to come in here because even fatboy gave us a $50 check for a band-in-pat rescue

[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.640]
Little bald headed Troy Stratford

[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.300]
You know you like the way that they want that said we're gonna run Ricky right down their throats

[00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.760]
Yeah, they step something down your throat all right and it wasn't Ricky

[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:20.800]
Okay

[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.160]
The first part of it rhymes with Rick

[00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.120]
Anyway barbecues in the summertime forget about it no more that no more vacations kids are back in school

[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.680]
And you probably have bulked up over the summer with all them barbecues

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.380]
Your fat is a pig to make along story short balance for life might be the answer

[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.600]
In fact, I got a story here today about atkins and all these others and they put people do you see that?

[00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.140]
What's that for a year on four different

[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:45.940]
Popular diets and the end of the year and they didn't do squad

[00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.960]
So if you're trying to try to do with the heart and the reason that people don't do it on the zones

[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.480]
Because who can figure it out a balance for life is based on the zone diet

[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:56.680]
But they do the figure in four you they figure out all the carbs you don't have to count anything

[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.560]
There's no cooking no shopping no cleaning no worries no calorie counting no carb counting just great results

[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.540]
You start seeing results on that scale within just a matter of days

[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.320]
Beast was doing great, but he's a fat pig who can't help himself balance for life is the only company in the world

[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.500]
That's it choose between two choices for each meal and snack every day that you're in a program

[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.060]
You just reach outside that door by six in the morning whenever you get up

[00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.440]
And there's your little black sack all the food to keep you happy and full all day long

[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:24.820]
Not crack not prefabricated chemical stuff, but delicious great stuff three gourmet meals two delicious snacks

[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:29.060]
And like I said, it'll keep you full and happy all day along and wait will melt off your body

[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:33.400]
So if you're tired and frustrated carrying around that extra weight if you're out of shape lethargic

[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.240]
If you're diabetic run a verge of a ticket for me, it's no fun

[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.460]
So that balance for life finally help you lose that weight column today

[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:41.060]

[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.980]
I don't have a clue

[00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:09.680]
K Davis is done

[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.480]
Now we will vote as being care

[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:16.920]
That I pitched all their buns

[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.180]
The people of California

[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.660]
They like me a lot

[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.040]
Cuz just like their life had a few orgies and small lots of fun

[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.380]
I

[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.760]
And the governor is true

[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.200]
So bad that I do not have a clue

[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.180]
Everybody see what I

[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.820]
I am the calm

[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.440]
Everybody I

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:02.560]
The you like me in the movies that's why I

[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.100]
The

[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:06.920]
Boy

[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.900]
Is right

[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.660]
Nice to see a duck by the way you look pretty skinny pretty slim

[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.800]
Duff was in little late this morning. They were excavating his rectum

[00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.500]
Check from Troy and one from fat boy

[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:32.300]
And they were also excavating Moe's head for the reasons hey Troy the reason Jay Fieler can't play with it often

[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:37.320]
Is he in the remember those twins the Egyptian twins can join it the head join it the head

[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.840]
Well Moe is got his head of jays back

[00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.220]
And if for weeks they've been trying to get it out and they can't do it

[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.480]
So even though you saw Fieler on the sidelines during the game yesterday you didn't see behind him

[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:50.040]
Moe was crouch down behind him because he's got his head stuck up jays ass

[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:52.720]
Brian

[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:59.060]
Greasy hey Brian you suck baby you're bad. I told you he keeps falling down and every time he gets touched

[00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.380]
He drops it in the ball, too. You know what's that? Yeah every time he hears somebody coming

[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:07.240]
Squirt squirt he gets all panicky and drops it right on the floor and the ball, too

[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:12.080]
Right on the ground hey Brian you're bad baby. You're awful. You're no daddy

[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.760]
And it was daddy up in a press box. He's got the binoculars now. Oh gee not again Brian another full ball

[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.500]
Another dissension. You know, yeah, I was so excited watching that game yesterday

[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:25.820]
I was squeezing myself literally I thought this has got to be like dying and going to heaven

[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.900]
This is almost as good as the Jacksonville playoff game 62 to 7

[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.640]
Because really if Tennessee would have wanted to they could have scored a hundred points

[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.640]
I'm serious if they really wanted to

[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:42.380]
Because what you had yesterday was two teams won it played and the other one that obviously didn't give a Schmidt as Moe would say didn't give a Schmidt

[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.380]
He did say Bolshevik this morning

[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:50.720]
Can you find it? Yeah, he said Bolshevik right there on the year so you know he's listening right hey Moe

[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:53.340]
You're still an asshole. I'm glad I didn't see you this morning. You make me sick

[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.540]
Okay, let's give the poor result then we'll get into Ken's email. I'm I spent the whole show on that

[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.940]
I'm with me. I mean that that just sour hey by the way Troy. I'll be here at 830

[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.880]
Don't be bringing people in here 815 now. I could have at six o'clock in the morning for you. You bald skin hedge for our two you

[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.880]
Crazy pretty he is he's a nut. He's a nice guy, but he's nuts

[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.800]
Yeah, if you'd like to meet with a client a 15 now

[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.120]
I'll probably be here by them, but don't count on 830 would be plenty early enough

[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.140]
I would play about 30, but it's not in the thing here

[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.460]
See another reason that I need to be back in Toronto

[00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:26.520]
Because I got to do it in here. It's not on the 360 what it's not on there

[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.980]
And don't go dick it around and putting it on here because then George will come up

[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.660]
You know getting in trouble with him

[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.780]
By the way, Rimmer all your contacts met except for Dr. Hampton all suck and I'm not going to Ruth Chris

[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:43.140]
Okay, Rimmer you're a good guy, but you're all your contacts up too bad about my kingdom

[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:47.260]
But we're not talking about that nobody cares about hockey down here. They have no idea who that is

[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.140]
And Scott didn't pick up his tickets to go the penguin game on Friday

[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:56.520]
So all I heard all week long. Oh gee, where's my ticket? So John leaves you the tickets

[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.620]
He calls me to your message did he show up? No, he picked up the tickets. Did you go to the game?

[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.660]
Oh, he did go to the well good with somebody else's with some crappy seats

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.000]
I hope or maybe you're setting the press box

[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.220]
Or in the QAM suite

[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:13.120]
Is that what you call it? I don't know in an open end. They have one. Why would I go up there?

[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:17.220]
They've they've oh yeah come out up and see the game in the sweet. Why would I want to do that when I have those great seats

[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.860]
Are my seats primo? Are they best? I'm going to that game tomorrow night man Tampa Bay

[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:24.900]
I'm gonna see a real hockey team the lightning man. They're good. They are something

[00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.820]
You see that game any of the game against the penguins the other night nine nothing

[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.560]
He's talking hockey again Greg. He's gonna kill the audience

[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.360]
If I've told you once I told you a bunch of times

[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:40.420]
Don't talk hockey and stuff. Well, all well quite frankly. I think it'd probably be a better idea than our sports. It was talking football

[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.260]
Yeah, after the hercones and the dolphins man you talk about a

[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.240]
Quinella perfecta do weeks in a row. I've been very hard week cursed down here

[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.540]
We really are aren't we cursed down here Jim? Oh, right? Yeah

[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.060]
1200 and some odd votes on the pool. Oh, I should have probably printed out again

[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.800]
If you only had one taper DB movie that you could watch over and over again. What would it be? Godfather

[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.760]
277 wind hands down your pants the old godfather. I don't think those droppings are in here. Are they?

[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.200]
Well, they are in here. That's that's a beautiful thing. It's a good

[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.260]
Take it only

[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:19.480]
Candy shack came in second 157 airplane 113 maybe the funniest movie of all time sure funnier than candy shack

[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.780]
But see on a sports and third station you're gonna get the candy shack crowd

[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.960]
I mean, it was a good movie. It's funny, but not as funny as airplane

[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.040]
Airplane was what

[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.860]
You thought candy shack was funnier than airplane. Oh, no, no

[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.600]
Don't suck around. Okay, you're not gonna get any extra hockey tickets for second around doesn't work

[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.560]
You're not my type you're not anybody's type

[00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:45.260]
Monty Python and holy grail 99 or 102 now you better read off of there. How do I want to read off of there?

[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:53.080]
Godfather 268 young Frankenstein had 60 while things 57 history of the world power 155 the only reason I'm reading the whole list is

[00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.160]
Because I want to get to one of them the big Lewinsky 44

[00:19:56.720 --> 00:20:02.280]
Grease 39 Pink Floyd the wall 35 clock over in 35 Dr. Strangel of 33

[00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:08.760]
The one that I voted for obviously. I wonder what the hell's that's under the one I voted for where the hell is it?

[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:17.480]
Network head 27 endless summer. That's what I'm trying to get to had 19 votes

[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.520]
Endless summer the surfing movie does that tell you lots of not iconic honies and cheese out there in this audience

[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:24.120]
Lots of

[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:30.320]
Rones endless are it's a surfing movie with a bunch of young hot-looking

[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.880]
Surfers, you know teenage mostly underage by the way. We're gonna trace those votes

[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.740]
They're all like 16 17-year-old kids almost naked

[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.420]
Glen gerry Glen Ross 14 the great outdoors eight recommend for dream seven

[00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.120]
See I wouldn't want to watch that over and over if that was it. I kill myself

[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.260]
It's almost as bad as being in this place as much as I love the movie

[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:53.600]
It's not one that you just want to constantly see over and over again. It's so depressing

[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.220]
Right you saw it didn't you many times? Oh my god

[00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:03.760]
Maybe for the shock value. That's it. And you know what it's not in there. Oh George you are such a polycrack man

[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.160]
Straw dog six and until the end of the world one now seriously. He's just you know. He's marginal

[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.860]
He's okay. I feel sorry for him. That's why he's still here

[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.020]
Because his wife tricked him into having that second kid. No, that's the only reason he still got the job

[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:17.920]
I went to bad form when they wanted to fire his ass while Moe tried to get him can

[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.860]
And there were only two reasons I went to bad for George number one because

[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.260]
The fact his wife tricked him into that other kid and number two just despite Moe

[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.360]
I wasn't gonna let most are coming in here and dicking with his show

[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.880]
That's a reason he can't he tried that you know they got the what uh, yeah look

[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.260]
Yeah, blow out your ass Moe you silly old coot

[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.360]
And by the way, how about them plates in your skirt? How what's that all about?

[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:43.380]
He was complaining about the fact that I don't have what do they call him in the pants uh creases in your pan? What do they call those

[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.440]
creases creases when he's got plates in his skirt

[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.840]
See, but when you have the bag it's a lot easier to wear like a that little cheerleader skirt when you have a bag and reach under

[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:53.320]
They're real quick

[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.660]
Yeah, it makes for easy access

[00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.620]
Anyway, I'll better do the break because once I get into this thing about the limo

[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.380]
I mean, it's the audience will even believe it. They won't even believe it. I know. I can't wait. Oh you

[00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.600]
You haven't even heard the tip of the iceberg yet

[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:13.260]
For my good friend Ken who seems to have a you know how there are some people who seem to have to be born under a dark

[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:19.180]
Cloud and there always seem to be some reason why everything they try to do everything they touch turns to pre or shmit, you know

[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.560]
And that's Ken, you know good intentions. I think

[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:28.640]
But every time he's gonna pick one of us up is oh gee. I thought you were gonna be downstairs in your upstairs and uh

[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:32.240]
You were I thought you were gonna be out of the closet. You're in the closet at whatever, you know

[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:38.780]
Can you got real problems, baby? You got real serious problems. I think probably rumor has something to do with it

[00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:42.700]
20s and I still don't have my leafs tv rumor. Okay

[00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:48.100]
26 past 10 at 5 16 WDQ way him when it comes to having your carpets clean

[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.520]
And as a matter of fact, I do want to say one nice thing about being here

[00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.540]
I got a chance to see now that my dogs are both dead

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:55.880]
I mean, that's not good, but at least my carpets are beautiful

[00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:02.060]
Because about a month ago dry concepts came and man my carpets look like I just had brand new laid on the floor

[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.840]

Oh speaking of the day you also played that and that's because you told me that the audio was bleeding through on the speakers in there

[00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:38.340]
Even when my microphone is closed another engineering problem here

[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.760]
Socks of Q.A.F.

[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.380]
You can't complain about the work or engineering department does because they don't do anything

[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.300]
They suck

[00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.500]
How about a little outer kneel

[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.080]
You guys are pathetic. I thought once we got fixed it here. We might get some stuff fixed

[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.600]
But we didn't what we under do is get George Corso fixed

[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.840]
You got a rusty knife. I'd love to do that like the slices balls right off of he has any let's use a spoon

[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:09.240]
All right, sounds excellent to me. Here's today's poll question. I want to get back to the limo story real quick

[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:15.580]
But I'll give him something to do keep him off the streets. Oh, and you know something. I didn't realize. Are you aware before I get to that?

[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.240]
No, my mouse is all screwed up here too. Even my mouse is tight

[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:22.320]
Man, this place blows

[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:25.400]
Where's the where's our website?

[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:29.500]
Now did you go on the WMD countdown thing?

[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:30.440]
The

[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.180]
The weapons of mass destruction Scotch that I spell it out for you to want to go. Oh, yeah on our site now

[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.780]
But did you notice that there's audio with it? Yes, I didn't know that Eric's been hard at work

[00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.420]
All distorted on here of course

[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.100]
Don't that sound good?

[00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.320]
You're engineering involved in that connection there. Okay, so not only do his lips move

[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.740]
But he's also doing this whole thing and account down just goes on the weapons of mass destruction while more American kids are dying every day

[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:12.600]
But anyway the Miriam elephant thing which are just you know, it's never gonna end until they finally end today could be the day that gypses by by

[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.980]
Why should he care about the blackstack and a vote for his successor anyway if it's a Republican a vote for a W

[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.080]
So what differences to make?

[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:28.600]
Get rid of her ass, okay, but here's the big story ministers urge support for Miriam elephant several black churches act for cause of

[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:34.480]
Elections chief. She's incompetent. We don't care if she's black if she's purple if she put a new chink in a hole deal. We don't care

[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.760]
She is in F. She is incompetent non-copus penis honey. You can't cut the mustard. You're an idiot

[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.840]
And when you consider all the embarrassment that we had and then we got those 80,000 ballots

[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.460]
I never got sent out and Broward and the people that got like multiple ballots if you could hear how distorted this thing sounds in here to me on these speakers

[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.940]
You you would just crap your pants each and every one of you listening to me right now

[00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.980]
This studio is the biggest excuse and Greg and squint. Oh, we're number one in Pilling. We're going to Italy with the best

[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:08.920]
You guys are a joke any co any connection between broadcasting and Greg read and Beasley broadcasting is purely coincidental

[00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.860]
I never heard such a sound in my life

[00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.760]
God are you talking to somebody on there don't do a show it's he's talking to see doing a show with somebody on the phone

[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.920]
That nothing worse than doing a show don't argue put where you're calling from put them on hold and cut the crap

[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:24.780]
What was that?

[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.740]
Somebody for abandoned pet rescue wanted to send in a check. I like I said take all the time you want

[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:37.720]
Thank you. Okay. Here's the poll today. Which ethnic or racial group is the most protective slash paranoid about its own

[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.640]
You know what that means?

[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:43.720]
Which ethnic or right now we've done this before or similar, but that's okay the timing is good now

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.820]
Because this very elephant thing really frosts my fat old ass

[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:54.600]
Which ethnic or racial group is most protective slash paranoid about its own blacks Jews Cubans or Muslims

[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.240]
I'm sure that we can put some of anything you want on there right to leave anybody out

[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:04.180]
I mean like we could say Chinese I don't know Chinese paranoid about the here's so many of them you know

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.220]
Oh, I know how about Italians

[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.740]
Now there's some Italians who are very defensive about that whole mafia thing

[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.900]
Well, we're sick and tired of being portrayed as a bunch of mafia people even though Don Corleone was over for dinner last night

[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.480]
And Ed Manacolione and man can she make a sauce like you never had in your life

[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.340]
They'll put Italians on there just to pacify. Yeah, the other groups don't they won't win

[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:31.160]
So let me give you a little story. I arrive in Miami at the airport on Saturday right on time. I plan landed you could

[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:34.820]
The second hand you know sand the right on time

[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.560]
I

[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.060]
Got an arrangement with my limo driver who consistently seems to have a trouble making contact with us

[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.900]
I'm sure that he probably doesn't have it with all his other client, but at any rate

[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:50.320]
I'm supposed to as soon as I get to the you know as you come out of the gate in Miami International I come out of the

[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:54.640]
Jetway and you walk to the front and you walk through that area toward the front

[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.220]
And as soon as I get to the concourse there

[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:04.320]
I'm supposed to call him. I got a tool free number and he's gonna meet me right out front to avoid having to stand there and wait

[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.180]
And wait and wait to see if he's ever gonna show up which I've done that in the past with him too

[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:11.960]
And then he breathlessly come. Oh gee, you know, it's always some story

[00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:15.200]
So I call him up. Oh gee

[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.540]
It's always OG not OJ OG

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.420]
I got an emergency up north and I'm racing back up there

[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:27.920]
But I got a guy who's gonna pick you up in a black Lincoln town car the lights will be flashing

[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.940]
Go right outside there outside your gate gee concourse G and he'll be meet you right outside

[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.020]
Okay, Ken

[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:41.180]
I go outside. I'm standing there and of course there's a lot of traffic. You know, they're an airport

[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.900]
Surprise surprise there's people coming and going and slipping and luggage

[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:51.000]
Uh, do I see a black uh Lincoln town car with or without a slice flashing? No, I'm waiting and waiting

[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.720]
I wait 20 minutes which I think is a reasonable length of time before starting to get really pissed off

[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:02.620]
I go back in I call and I said hey, no, he ain't here yet. Oh gee. Give me that OG against it. There it is. Oh gee

[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:07.280]
You got to change the name of the limo service to OG limo is what it ought to be yeah

[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.840]
Give me another five minutes. So I go outside again

[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:16.660]
And I'm waiting and I'm waiting and I'm waiting another 15 minutes now 35 freaking minutes

[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:19.680]
35 minutes keep that number in mind, okay?

[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.580]
35 minutes got it

[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.980]
Not 30 but 30 man. No, but 35

[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.640]
Finally, I look way down not in front of like concourse G where it is supposed to be

[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.040]
But I see a black not with light flashing either but a black car of some kind. It's so far down there

[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.060]
And I see this woman get out of the car

[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.860]
Who looks like she just came off the banana boat she looked like a younger Cilia Cruz

[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:48.040]
With better hair

[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:54.740]
And she's holding up a sign. She's she's like in distress like I don't know what I did what am I doing?

[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.920]
And she's holding up a sign and of course from that distance even though my eye said into bad maybe a little cockeyed

[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:08.000]
But I can't read it so I can start walking at direction. She holds it up like praying that it might be me and sure enough Neil Rogers great

[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.780]
I'm giving her limo she gets in the car hello. How are you?

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.180]
And she says will be going?

[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:17.900]
Will be going

[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.880]
Where are we going?

[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:26.140]
I said you mean to tell me that they didn't even tell me any directions where where I live where we're going

[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.500]
Uh, well they give me an address, but they know give me an address

[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:28.580]
Yes

[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:37.200]
That that is a I'm not paraphrasing that is an exact quote they give me an address, but they know give me an address what

[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.900]
How do you like that?

[00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:45.620]
If this woman had been off the banana boat longer than a half an hour I I'll be really shocked I'd be surprised

[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.020]
Were you holding the sign right side up at least? No, it was in Spanish

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.540]
Senior Roy years

[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:53.460]
Senior now it was yeah somebody handed it to her

[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:54.420]
And the sign too

[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:03.200]
Now we get on the road with some difficulty because this woman she should have been driving and forget about a limo

[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:05.200]
She should have been driving a Kia

[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.140]
Like my little dog and he's been dead for a year, okay? I mean it just

[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:10.140]
insanity

[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:15.440]
She's squeezing the wheel so tight that I was surprised it wasn't blood coming out of her hands or the wheel

[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.360]
I mean one of the other squeezing it you know people that are terrified

[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.940]
She's squeezing it in the wheel too

[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.760]
And try to tell her how we get there. I should take the

[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.540]
95 up to the turnpike and we'll go up to 595 at a beep but a bo

[00:32:28.540 --> 00:32:32.640]
Now it starts raining. Oh boy. And now you think she was scared before

[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:37.980]
So we're on the turnpike going about 52 miles an hour and it's not raining hard yet at this point that way

[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:43.820]
Did till I got home about 52 and of course the speed limit is what 65 on the turnpike last time I looked at that sign with the numbers on it

[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.160]
I think it's suggested 65 it actually moves quite quick

[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:52.020]
No, no, it's not a suggestion. This is not New Jersey. Okay. It's not a suggestion

[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:58.680]
That's the speed limit. I'm not saying oh no granted all the traffic is going biased to the right to the left underneath us over the top of us

[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.000]
She's going about 52

[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.840]
Scared Schmittless, okay

[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:06.780]
Now we finally get to where the hell I tell her to get off and

[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.980]
She comes up to sunrise boulevard and I said we're gonna make her right here

[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.700]
But once you get over, we're gonna make her quick left

[00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:17.060]
So what she does is she pulls out and I see the light is green going east and west on sunrise

[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:22.320]
And I see there's some cars coming and I'm thinking to myself honey. You're gonna get us killed see Nureta

[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.720]
And she Dan you got us wiped out she pulled out right in front of the traffic

[00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:32.280]
And she was like kind of like listing like at like a big ship. You know in a storm listing from one lane to the other

[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.600]
He wasn't quite sure

[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.280]
Then

[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.980]
We finally get to my house and I tell her it's this house right here in the car

[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:46.480]
And she points to the house across the street this one. I said no. I said right across and so she now she keeps going again

[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:48.140]
I said no, no stop stop

[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.340]
Right here stop a key a key bitch

[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:53.740]
seniorita

[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.020]
And then of course like 20 minutes later it started raining like the end of the world

[00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:02.600]
It's humid at 87 degrees this place absolutely

[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.580]
Positively see anybody who thinks I exaggerate. Oh Neil is so negative. You know I'm blowing out your ass

[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.440]
This is a cesspool. This is the end of the universe make no mistake about it

[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:15.600]
Or maybe I just have bad luck here. Maybe just they're not meant for me

[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.420]
You know me maybe after all those other years maybe all these years

[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.640]
That's the limit, you know, and then you have to find someplace else to settle down

[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:28.720]
So I got a an email because because the uh the can the limo guy had called my house

[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:32.920]
While this was all going on. Oh, did you get home yet? No, not yet

[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.980]
Oh, haven't called me. We'll needless to say that I return to call no

[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.200]
Am I gonna use this guy again? No

[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.140]
Am I pissed off and fired up? Yes

[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.460]
I mean, you know, I had a very uneventful flight

[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.040]
Okay, in fact I slept half at a time which ended very rarely do

[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:52.960]
But I had to get up four and a more than the kids that flight

[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.000]
And so I like nodded off and it was very uneventful very smooth got here right on time

[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.260]
But even after a short flight like that

[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.900]
You're not in the mood to stand outside somewhere and then of course you don't want to go running back inside

[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.120]
Because you're afraid because I didn't have my cell phone

[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.160]
So you're afraid if you're going to go make a call it with your my luck

[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.260]
I go back inside is just when they're gonna pull up

[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:16.300]
So you're like, you know, your scut stomach is churning and your guts are your butterflies are

[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.280]
Hey Ken nice job sweetheart

[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.680]

[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:29.860]
WQM

[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:35.020]
Hey, I know one thing. It won't be long now before all the relatives come down for the holidays or maybe your parents coming down for the entire winter

[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.940]
In either case if you need a new mattress do this smart thing more and more people here at the radio station

They're jumping on a bandwagon like I'm always doing calling Donald mattress to get a great night sleep

[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.820]
Miguel and George and Bokobrine even disgusting Jeff don't call me fat boy high

[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:50.720]

[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.760]
I'm like noon to two 130 to 330 like that

[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.600]
I've been sleeping on a mattress in these people for years and believe you me my back is the only good part of my body

[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:21.240]
Honest sales prices fantastic service every day low prices same-day delivery and free setup and removal

[00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:25.850]

[00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.010]

and let you

[00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:36.510]
pataras

[00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:37.210]
to go

[00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.310]
put on

[00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:38.750]
em

[00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:39.490]
this

[00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:48.630]
This is Grand Contro to Meja World, your total 2037D.

[00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:55.130]
But you live outside of the living area.

[00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:02.190]
And that's how come you gotta come and pick it up.

[00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.890]
Yeah, let me show the back door.

[00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.250]
Yeah, this is Meja World, the arm control.

[00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.770]
I got off you, complain.

[00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:20.090]
How the heck I suppose to be the one to answer?

[00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:27.210]
Who, when you forget to give me a present school you've moved?

[00:38:29.410 --> 00:38:30.850]
Huh, what's this?

[00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.590]
Why you don't give me my surprise card?

[00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.050]
Oh, that's correct.

[00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:40.170]
To put on...

[00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:42.830]
That's a meetra game.

[00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:46.890]
Oh boy, this is gonna be real math fright.

[00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:50.290]
You left out my post-fiber ice!

[00:38:51.130 --> 00:38:52.090]
What are you thinking?

[00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:52.770]
Stupid!

[00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:56.470]
See, we didn't put the chainsaw in a pool so we don't have to worry about defending him.

[00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:57.630]
Because we don't have any less than anyway.

[00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.150]
How many we got?

[00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:59.510]
About four or five, not 30.

[00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.510]
10, 48, at five, 60, WQM.

[00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.630]
So here's the email I get right before the show.

[00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.550]
Just must be your coincidence, don't you think?

[00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:08.570]
Yeah, about a quarter to ten.

[00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:11.110]
Somebody wanted to make sure that I got it right here.

[00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.270]
Just before I went on the air, so I wouldn't rip him too bad.

[00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:13.950]
Didn't work, Ken.

[00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:15.050]
Didn't work.

[00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.010]
Wait till you hear this.

[00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:17.310]
Don't interrupt him again.

[00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:18.770]
Okay, don't start playing that game on him.

[00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:19.830]
You do on George all the time.

[00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:21.290]
Here's the...

[00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:22.310]
I'm just just relaxed.

[00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.230]
Okay, everybody here is so goddamn uptight.

[00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.810]
Yeah, turn the speaker up so it can hear it, Schmidthead.

[00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.870]
Schmidthead.

[00:39:29.010 --> 00:39:30.530]
So here's Ken's email.

[00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.530]
Neil, I'm really sorry for making you wait on Saturday.

[00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:35.750]
I was waiting right outside the airport to get you.

[00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:38.310]
When one of my drivers got stuck behind an accident,

[00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.610]
it would have been seriously late for a customer in Boca.

[00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.810]
So obviously the customer in Boca was a lot more important than I was.

[00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.490]
The only adjustment I could make was to send a car from an office base

[00:39:48.490 --> 00:39:51.550]
next to the airport to get you, as I had to bolt from I made a Boca.

[00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:53.690]
And I made it in 35 minutes he brags.

[00:39:54.290 --> 00:39:56.610]
Well, that's the length of time I stood there cooling my heels

[00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.850]
right outside of God damn gate G waiting for some asshole to pick me up, Ken.

[00:40:00.210 --> 00:40:03.990]
He was all the way to Boca by the time somebody finally picked me up so to speak.

[00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:08.310]
The back entrance to the airport where I was waiting was blocked off by construction

[00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.870]
and that Miami office is located back in that area.

[00:40:11.170 --> 00:40:13.470]
The driver did have to take a detour to get into the airport.

[00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:15.730]
That's why he took so long to get you.

[00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:17.030]
He?

[00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:23.610]
Needless to say Saturday was a bad day.

[00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:24.610]
Now you're getting warmer Ken.

[00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.430]
I don't really want anybody else to drive you,

[00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.690]
but I feel I had to make an exception that day.

[00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.090]
I feel bad that you had to wait.

[00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:32.330]
Well that makes two of us, Ken.

[00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.110]
I hope the driver was okay for you.

[00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.290]
No.

[00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.630]
Unfortunately I was unable to give him, him, him.

[00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.090]
Any directions to your house.

[00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.870]
Him.

[00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.250]
Let me know if I can make it up to you.

[00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.530]
No.

[00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.730]
No. Go away, Ken.

[00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:45.750]
Just go away.

[00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.290]
Don't go away, man.

[00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.910]
Just go away.

[00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:47.550]
Go pick up rumor.

[00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:50.590]
Pick up rumor and Denise and stuck them in the trunk together.

[00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:51.530]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.710]

[00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:53.190]
So you can out you out the other one.

[00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.450]
So you can drive the other one crazy first.

[00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:57.430]
Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

[00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:57.730]
Yeah.

[00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:00.430]
Anyway, how's that pull coming?

[00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:01.370]
64 votes.

[00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.710]
Which ethnic or racial group is most protective slash paranoid about its own?

[00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:08.430]
64 votes.

[00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:09.170]
Black 34.

[00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:10.270]
Jews 15.

[00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.110]
Cubans 12.

[00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:12.070]
Muslims 3.

[00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:12.590]
And Italians.

[00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:13.270]
Oh!

[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.050]
Don't have any yet.

[00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.730]
Except for Joe Dodgola who has all been out of shape in the godfather Kima.

[00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:20.010]
That's a long time ago.

[00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:22.130]
That's many, many moons ago.

[00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:23.110]
How many years that was?

[00:41:23.230 --> 00:41:24.150]
About 30, man.

[00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:24.450]
A go.

[00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:25.070]
That's right.

[00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.050]
72, 73, something like that.

[00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:30.370]
But the Italians made a big stink about that.

[00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:31.390]
But now we've worked on them.

[00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.590]
And finally, so, okay, you're right.

[00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:33.610]
We're all a bunch of gangsters.

[00:41:33.610 --> 00:41:34.430]
We're a bunch of crooks.

[00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.930]
We don't mind.

[00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:35.410]
We don't care.

[00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.950]
We're used to that.

[00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:37.070]
We like the sopranos anyway.

[00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:37.810]
Okay?

[00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:42.570]
Ministers, earths, is it like freezing inheritors of my imagination?

[00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:44.770]
The quiver, I can't handle it.

[00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:45.890]
I'm not going to do the show in here.

[00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:47.170]
I'm going to do it on the hall.

[00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:49.290]
Now, there's something wrong in this room.

[00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:53.230]
I'm already like, you know, gagging and puking.

[00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:53.810]
And what is that on?

[00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:54.330]
About 40?

[00:41:55.650 --> 00:41:55.970]
68.

[00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:57.230]
About 30, man.

[00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.990]
You know, I don't want to be made to feel it.

[00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:02.510]
Well, it's one thing to make you feel at home, but I feel like I'm in Toronto outside with no clothes on.

[00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.690]
And I feel that already, okay?

[00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.570]
68, my fat ass.

[00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:07.570]
Yeah, freezing in here.

[00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:10.690]
My left ear is already plugged up there.

[00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.810]
This is, let's get the guy to blow out the vents while we're on here.

[00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:14.530]
We'll just play music.

[00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:16.330]
This is not acceptable.

[00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:22.610]
And you wonder why the people in this building are walking around with strip throat and all sick and puking their guts out?

[00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:24.390]
Probably saw a screw in.

[00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:29.750]
Ministers, earths, support for Miriam Elephant says the story in the Sunsendle here.

[00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:31.410]
I'm holding it in my hand right now in the story too.

[00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:33.470]
Hey, Miriam, just like, can, go away.

[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.630]
Okay, go away.

[00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.490]
You're inept in the carpet.

[00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:37.250]
And just like, can, you're inept.

[00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:41.310]
Maybe your intentions are good, but just like, can, you can't get it done.

[00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:43.850]
You've always got, your life is just filled with crises.

[00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:46.770]
And you can't get the ballots out on time.

[00:42:47.050 --> 00:42:50.450]
And with that big 2004 election coming up, do we want to go through that again and floor it up?

[00:42:50.530 --> 00:42:50.650]
No.

[00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.370]
And be the laughing stock of the world and put Bush in there again.

[00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.130]
Thanks to the fact that his brother is going to did it all and bring a Catherine Harris back.

[00:42:57.450 --> 00:42:59.450]
You see she's going to run for the Senate now, that bitch.

[00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:01.050]
Catherine Harris.

[00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:04.230]
Now that Graham's not going to run again, when did they announce that?

[00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:07.330]
What do you mean when did they announce it was on our website?

[00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:12.090]
Well, we can, if you, if you, if you look at something besides your penis, you'd find out, okay?

[00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.290]
Although I realize it takes a lot of concentration.

[00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.750]
If you looked on our website, all his great bedtime stories I've been putting on here,

[00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:21.130]
you'd read that Catherine Harris is considering a run.

[00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:24.950]
She's got their runs like my rich aunt because she drinks too much dide soda.

[00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:29.670]
By the way, McGollock, case you haven't heard that, don't drink too much dide soda because you'll get diarrhea like my rich aunt.

[00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:33.270]
That was the ball report from my mother yesterday.

[00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:36.070]
Gotta give me a BN report on everybody, everybody in the family.

[00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:38.250]
How many ball movements they had this week?

[00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:39.170]
About third man.

[00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.230]
Were they firmed? Did they sink? Did they float?

[00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:42.850]
Stuff like that.

[00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:46.070]
I don't want to hear about your B.M.'s mom, okay?

[00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.790]
I didn't come home to hear about Schmidt.

[00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.330]
I got enough Schmidt in this place.

[00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:52.130]
Ministers urge support.

[00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.750]
Several black churches act for cross-evil actions chief.

[00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:58.230]
Some black ministers took to their pulpits yesterday morning urging support

[00:43:58.230 --> 00:44:00.890]
of a battle supervisor of elections, Miriam Elephant,

[00:44:01.270 --> 00:44:05.410]
while others ignored the issue in one black preacher back to a fire election department employee.

[00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.050]
Let the governor know we don't approve of what's been happening,

[00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:13.210]
said the Reverend Eric Jones at the 1045 A.M. Service at Canonia,

[00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:15.050]
a worship center in Carver, ranches.

[00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:19.670]
He told Congress the bombard governor, bush with email Sunday regarding Elephant.

[00:44:20.070 --> 00:44:23.010]
I'm not joking. I'm already getting like a raspy throat.

[00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.710]
I've been sitting in this room for two hours and twenty-three minutes.

[00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:27.290]
This is a sick building.

[00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.790]
There is disease in this building.

[00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:33.270]
And I'll be glad then if I'm going to come back here and get sick again.

[00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.770]
Once the last time I was out with a cold or anything like a scratchy throat.

[00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:37.630]
I wouldn't know.

[00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:39.730]
A little longer ago before you even were here.

[00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:41.470]
Ages ago.

[00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:46.490]
But sitting in the course last time, I've had time before last in February.

[00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:48.070]
I was here. What did I have? A stroke.

[00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.190]
Uh-huh. Right. A stroke.

[00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:51.510]
Really? Yeah.

[00:44:52.530 --> 00:44:53.790]
A freaking stroke.

[00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.130]
From being in this building? No.

[00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.830]
Just from being fat and out of shape and sitting on my ass here all day.

[00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.250]
And having all that food out there.

[00:45:00.590 --> 00:45:00.770]
Oh.

[00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.450]
Oh.

[00:45:02.350 --> 00:45:05.070]
Like the 40 pound. See, this place needs some leadership.

[00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.570]
That's what's wrong with this radio station.

[00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.330]
I'm glad I came back this week just so I could take a look and remind myself.

[00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:10.630]
This place has no leadership.

[00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.910]
We got...it's like the sisters that are blind and the...

[00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.050]
and their weak sisters is what's running this place.

[00:45:16.330 --> 00:45:17.650]
You got muffin airs and ice-kype.

[00:45:17.650 --> 00:45:18.790]
We got the balls of a fruit fly.

[00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:20.550]
And then you got clearance who don't have any balls.

[00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.370]
Maybe they should all drive limos.

[00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.270]
Oh, I did get my paycheck early.

[00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.930]
Thank you, clearance. You're the best on that. But everything else you suck.

[00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.610]
That's what the B-Sat. He said you suck.

[00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.670]
Here's our best and eel total.

[00:45:31.830 --> 00:45:33.570]
It's getting close to that $40,000 mark.

[00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:35.310]
There's Miguel looking at me who said with a straight face.

[00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.010]
Oh, we'll make $9,000. No problem. We do it every year.

[00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.010]
Uh-huh.

[00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:40.790]
Yeah. What a comedian. What a clown.

[00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:41.890]
What a clown.

[00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.090]
Of course, you notice if we had the disc in the stores like we used to.

[00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.310]
Like we used to have them in specs and peaches or whatever.

[00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.870]
How might still be in business or borders?

[00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:50.690]
That would be doing business every day.

[00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:51.990]
Are we doing business every day? No.

[00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.250]
Now.

[00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:57.570]
38,680 for a band of pet rescue.

[00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.790]
We're going to get to 40,000 by the end of the week or I'm leaving.

[00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:01.970]
I'm getting out of here.

[00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:04.610]
By the end of the week.

[00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:05.790]
I'm telling it right now.

[00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.150]
We don't make 40 grand by Saturday. I'm leaving.

[00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:11.870]
If we do make 40 grand by Saturday, I'm leaving.

[00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:15.310]
Alex says, hey, Neil, are we blessed here in Tennessee?

[00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.250]
PS Dolphins offensive is offensive.

[00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.850]
Keep up the good work and Moe is a major asshole.

[00:46:20.850 --> 00:46:22.710]
Well, I'm so really correct.

[00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.310]
I think you tested all the bases there.

[00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.950]
Alex, take first base and then go around the bases,

[00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:27.990]
rounding around and around.

[00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.310]
Okay.

[00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.410]
Keep running around in circles.

[00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:33.950]
98 votes on there. Blacks have got 50, Miriam.

[00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:35.450]
They're sick and tired of your crap.

[00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:37.770]
The OJ crap and the Miriam elephant crap.

[00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:39.410]
Every time a black person kills somebody.

[00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:41.290]
Oh, he didn't do it. It's a white thing.

[00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:42.730]
It's a white thing at bull crap.

[00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:43.170]
Okay.

[00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:45.350]
I'm never going to finish till two o'clock.

[00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:48.230]
I'm telling it right now. Can't you hear the, the way I'm losing my voice?

[00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:49.710]
It's getting raspy.

[00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.210]
Do I have a cold?

[00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.550]
No.

[00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:52.370]
Do I have allergies?

[00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:52.730]
No.

[00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.530]
Do I have a allergic to this place?

[00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.770]
You're smiling, but it's not like I'm making this up.

[00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:02.590]
I'm not for ral, I'm not putting out a voice, which is his real voice.

[00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:04.830]
Anyway, maybe that's why I got it.

[00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:09.250]
But there's no way I'm doing a whole week worth it.

[00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:10.770]
I'll do them from home on the phone.

[00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:11.750]
I'll call you.

[00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.250]
In fact, I can be home by 11.30.

[00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.510]
Ken's out there with a limo waiting to pick me up right now.

[00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:20.950]
As a matter of fact, I can be home by, I said 11.30 by 10 a.m. or p.m.

[00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:23.830]
If we call Ken, I can be home by 11.30 tonight.

[00:47:24.130 --> 00:47:25.130]
You could walk home faster.

[00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:27.530]
Ken, you're a piece of crap man. You're an idiot.

[00:47:27.930 --> 00:47:28.550]
You're very sad.

[00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.810]
And he's probably thinking, oh, but I didn't charge him nothing but I always gave everybody a nice,

[00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.190]
even as a banana boat lady, I gave her 60 buck tip.

[00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:38.510]
No, seriously, she just got off the banana.

[00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:40.230]
You're laughing. She just got off the banana boat.

[00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.270]
He got her from an office at the airport.

[00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:43.370]
Am I the airport?

[00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.170]
Does that tell you now?

[00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.590]
See, you don't have to be too swift to figure out who he's going to get.

[00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.230]
Where are we going? Where are we going?

[00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.830]
Or they give me an address, but they don't give me an address.

[00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:52.230]
They pass a USA.

[00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.230]
She's talking baby talk crap.

[00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:56.530]
I'm thinking, are you some kind of moron?

[00:47:56.650 --> 00:47:59.710]
She's like, see, see, see, see, you're...

[00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.450]
She was squeezing out wheels so goddamn tight she could have, she could have just crushed it.

[00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.990]
I thought I saw blood dripping out of it in the wheel too.

[00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.310]
I'm almost positive.

[00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:12.490]
I'd like to see blood dripping out of Ken.

[00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:14.970]
Oh, what a sweet thought that is.

[00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.530]
You are such a loser, Ken, but again, keep in mind.

[00:48:18.650 --> 00:48:19.730]
I wonder if he knows matured.

[00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.150]
Because they both know rumor.

[00:48:23.130 --> 00:48:24.710]
Tent it is freezing in here, man.

[00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:27.650]
It's freezing. I'm going to catch like pneumonia in this place.

[00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:28.530]
I say lawsuit.

[00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:30.730]
Law suit against the beesleaves.

[00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:31.730]
This is an unfit.

[00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:35.590]
And like I said, we got a bunch of whips out there who won't stand up for anybody.

[00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:37.550]
Engineering, it's the same old thing every time.

[00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:39.490]
But I'm doing a show in Toronto.

[00:48:39.530 --> 00:48:40.930]
I'm in a comfort in my own apartment.

[00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.030]
I can control the temperature.

[00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:43.110]
It's very comfortable.

[00:48:43.110 --> 00:48:44.250]
There's no allergies.

[00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.630]
I'd hop out of bed in the morning.

[00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.330]
I don't have to drive through all the asshole traffic.

[00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:49.750]
I sit down in a studio.

[00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:50.670]
I do a fine show.

[00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:51.810]
Everything is great.

[00:48:52.210 --> 00:48:52.890]
Everything is fine.

[00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.550]
Nobody screws around with equipment because they're ain't nobody in there.

[00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:57.110]
Nobody diddles with everything.

[00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.770]
Not here.

[00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:02.590]
This is the home of the dealer.

[00:49:05.850 --> 00:49:06.290]
1057.

[00:49:06.890 --> 00:49:08.010]
See, I can't even grip.

[00:49:08.010 --> 00:49:08.350]
Good.

[00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:09.510]
From this place.

[00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:10.470]
Even my burps.

[00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:12.150]
Even my burps are rasced me now.

[00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.590]
Do you hear that?

[00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:16.650]
Hey, if you're underpaid, no for work like Scott and McGill.

[00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:19.910]
Maybe like a new hot pain career, but you don't have four years to wait to waste on college.

[00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.130]

[00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:51.430]
I can't believe they pay for this stuff.

[00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:52.670]

My, in local career sports radio 560s, UA-M.

[00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:29.030]
The Makin'ah.

[00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:31.650]
This is Joe Ball on the Voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:34.550]
And you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God.

[00:50:34.590 --> 00:50:35.670]
This is Tamar.

[00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:37.930]
Don't use that kind of language around me.

[00:50:38.070 --> 00:50:39.010]
Or vertical quality.

[00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:39.730]
Er, you.

[00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:40.310]
Yes, I have.

[00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:41.050]
Stop it.

[00:50:41.310 --> 00:50:41.830]
Tifty friends.

[00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:46.450]
When they roll into town, they are a sight to see.

[00:50:47.570 --> 00:50:51.690]
Those five-wheeled press came in in a big SUV.

[00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:57.270]
Transling and gigging on my TV.

[00:50:58.490 --> 00:51:04.390]
Those queer eye for the straight guys are more like five women to me.

[00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:05.170]
Yes.

[00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.710]
They care of your bedroom and throw out your clothes.

[00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:15.790]
Wax your eyebrows, pluck the hair from your nose.

[00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.030]
They're good at their jobs, but they sit to pee.

[00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:27.850]
Cause those queer eye for the straight guys are more like five women to me.

[00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:28.510]
Huh?

[00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:36.030]
Oh, they get carried away.

[00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:40.370]
With the things that they say.

[00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:44.850]
They're so happy in the game.

[00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:46.890]
I got a problem with that.

[00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:54.530]
Oh, they can cut like a knife.

[00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:58.570]
They won't change your whole life.

[00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:02.310]
Or they'll even your wife.

[00:52:03.890 --> 00:52:07.890]
By the time that they leave you, you're thinking their way.

[00:52:08.790 --> 00:52:11.150]
It's no longer a big spread.

[00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:13.530]
It's now a new way.

[00:52:13.530 --> 00:52:18.290]
And you find yourself shopping for fresh poultry.

[00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:24.590]
Those queer eye for the straight guys are more like five women to me.

[00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:26.430]
It's okay.

[00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.490]
Everyone wetts the bed now and then.

[00:52:30.110 --> 00:52:32.470]
It's nice here to shave, but I don't know.

[00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:37.990]
But if they're in town, please send Carson and his friends to me.

[00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:39.730]
Love it all 4, 5, 60.

[00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.770]
Too many whims, too many faggots here at QM.

[00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.490]
Nobody with a firm wrist man.

[00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:44.950]
Nobody to really get the iron.

[00:52:45.090 --> 00:52:45.570]
That's what we need.

[00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.990]
Iron Mike.

[00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:47.090]
He's looking for a job now.

[00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.010]
He'll come in here and kick some ass, right?

[00:52:49.310 --> 00:52:50.310]
Let's get Mike Keenan here.

[00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.850]
What do you say?

[00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.610]
All right.

[00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:52.750]
He'll run this place.

[00:52:53.810 --> 00:52:55.110]
He'll see no more BS man.

[00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:55.650]
No more...

[00:52:55.650 --> 00:52:57.010]
Oh, T-greg, it's a fight.

[00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:58.190]
It's a fight in the home, Greg.

[00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:58.750]
No more that.

[00:52:59.390 --> 00:53:01.430]
No more that limperist that approach the broadcasting.

[00:53:01.770 --> 00:53:02.930]
Get some macho guy in here.

[00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.990]
Like me.

[00:53:04.790 --> 00:53:09.570]
Anyway, here's a Jorge, one of our former sponsors, who's looking for another free plug.

[00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:10.510]
Hey, listen, I appreciate it.

[00:53:10.550 --> 00:53:13.910]
He wants to come in and do an evaluation of our workspace, you know, the ear.

[00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.970]
The only problem with that is, is this place going to pay for that?

[00:53:17.050 --> 00:53:17.170]
No.

[00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.990]
Are they going to allow it?

[00:53:18.010 --> 00:53:18.130]
No.

[00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:18.330]
No.

[00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:22.250]
Because they know that even if he did it for free, you're going to find this place's...

[00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.850]
They would condemn this place the first minute.

[00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.990]
Again, and then they'd have to pay him off, too, just like they probably pay off the elevator inspectors.

[00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:30.270]
You know they got a...

[00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:32.190]
Because the certificate is on the thing they're in the elevators.

[00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:33.690]
You know that they had to pay somebody on.

[00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:37.250]
There's no way those elevators are going to pass any inspection.

[00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:38.370]
Because they're always breaking down.

[00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:41.230]
You never had a problem with the elevators?

[00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:42.850]
One of them lands kind of hard.

[00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.550]
Oh, really?

[00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:46.230]
Well, that's about the only thing in this place that's kind of hard.

[00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:46.790]
I'll tell you that.

[00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.170]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:50.570]
I'm not making it up.

[00:53:50.650 --> 00:53:52.750]
I'm not trying to be like, oh, he's such a sour pussy.

[00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:54.170]
No, it's just...

[00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:57.770]
I come in here already in a sour mood because the limo story, but everything's fine.

[00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.990]
Except the fact that Reigns and Cats and Dogs 24 hours a day,

[00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:04.230]
and it's 100 degrees in the shade and humid as hell,

[00:54:04.330 --> 00:54:05.510]
other than that, what's not to like?

[00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:06.190]
Right?

[00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.530]
What's not to like about this place?

[00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:10.490]
Especially those dolphins.

[00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:11.530]
Oh, okay.

[00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:12.570]
Yeah, now we're talking.

[00:54:12.750 --> 00:54:13.450]
And the Herkones.

[00:54:13.550 --> 00:54:13.950]
Oh, right.

[00:54:14.170 --> 00:54:14.710]
Two in a row.

[00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:18.830]
This is an organization of sourpuses that if they lose one game and...

[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.550]
WAAAAAAA!

[00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:21.370]
Well, if they lose one game and two years, WAAAAAA!

[00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.370]
Now they lose two games in a row, side by each, back to back.

[00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:27.530]
You can just imagine these suicide that's going on out there, huh?

[00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.530]
Decrease the surplus population, mix them room for the rest of us.

[00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.830]
Nothing but suicide.

[00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:36.870]
And then, across the dolphins, five and four now, with a little girl quarterback,

[00:54:37.970 --> 00:54:41.770]
it's got to tell you the extent of how desperate it is when you're praying,

[00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:44.210]
if you're a dolphin fan, you're praying for J. Feeler to come back.

[00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.250]
OY!

[00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.290]
That tells you how bad Brian Greacy is.

[00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:49.730]
Plus, Brian, you're still as ugly as daddy, man.

[00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:50.350]
You are brutal.

[00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:53.510]
Keeps dropping it and dropping it and just...

[00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.710]
Here's somebody of 20 yards down the field, come...

[00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:57.190]
OOP! There go the ball! There goes!

[00:54:57.890 --> 00:55:00.150]
Like a wet watermelon seed like Rick Weaver would say.

[00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:07.310]
130 votes on a pool, Black 62, which ethnic or racial group is the most protective-sized paranoid about its own.

[00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:11.810]
Black 62, Jews 36, Cubans 23, 23 Cubans,

[00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:12.570]
and Crable.

[00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.310]
Muslim 7 and Italians 2.

[00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:16.650]
I must let somebody off of there.

[00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:19.770]
Here's our first call. I bet you'd say it's going to be great.

[00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:20.710]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[00:55:21.610 --> 00:55:22.890]
Yeah, it is. I told you.

[00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:24.830]
Here's Coconut Creek. Hello.

[00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.990]
Hello. Yes, sir.

[00:55:26.730 --> 00:55:30.790]
Neil, you had a great show on about the Saudis and about Bush.

[00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:32.150]
Yeah, I'm going to talk to old people, sir.

[00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:34.110]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:55:34.570 --> 00:55:37.370]
I want to talk to somebody under the age of 90 who isn't just one of the chronic.

[00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:38.350]
Okay, that would be nice.

[00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:41.230]
Otherwise, we just might not take any phone calls here today.

[00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:44.190]
We'll play a lot of music so I can clear my lungs out, clear out my pipes.

[00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:46.910]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.570]
The pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:51.310]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:52.890]
Yeah, how you doing, Neil?

[00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:53.370]
Okay, sir.

[00:55:53.850 --> 00:55:56.250]
Are you going to be our first real caller today or not?

[00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:59.930]
I was a limo driver for 16 years.

[00:56:00.030 --> 00:56:00.250]
Yeah.

[00:56:00.550 --> 00:56:06.550]
Okay. And I have the most sympathy for you because the market used to get in screen fights

[00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:10.650]
with my boss all the time because these scheduled things were all

[00:56:10.650 --> 00:56:14.530]
and it would wind up leaving people sitting there, all another company,

[00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:18.430]
and not even bother giving them, facting them over a complete sheet,

[00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:21.590]
where the person lives, how to get there, and everything else.

[00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.890]
Yeah.

[00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:24.250]
I mean, this happened countless times.

[00:56:24.370 --> 00:56:27.590]
We lost many accounts because of stupidity.

[00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:31.290]
I mean, I'm sure that if you were in the wait 35 minutes,

[00:56:31.310 --> 00:56:34.430]
you would have had somebody, your friend, wait for them to get up or whatever.

[00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.530]
You know something, I could have gotten in a cab.

[00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:39.130]
There were 8 million cabs, even though it would have crossed me an arm and a leg.

[00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:41.230]
I don't, I can have a few bucks second afford to cab.

[00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:46.270]
I, you know, I could have gotten a cab within 10 seconds when I walked out there to the curb.

[00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:47.290]
Right.

[00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:49.870]
And let that be a message to all limo driver.

[00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.630]
I drove limo for 16 years, so I can speak.

[00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:57.590]
Let the all limo driver show respect and also limo owners.

[00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:02.870]
And then he's got the chutzpah to send me an email to brag about the fact he made it all the way up to Bokin 35 minutes.

[00:57:02.970 --> 00:57:05.490]
In other words, by the time I finally got my ass into the car,

[00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:09.170]
he was already in Bokin taking care of somebody who was obviously much more important than I am.

[00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:09.990]
That's right.

[00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.530]
Exactly.

[00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:11.230]
Well, school him.

[00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:14.430]
Thanks a lot, Poundy, and have a great day and don't do it again.

[00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.070]
There's a guy that probably screwed over a few people, he's not too happy about it.

[00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:19.910]
At least he's honest and he apologizes for it.

[00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.830]
You limo drivers out there. What else wrong with you people, man?

[00:57:23.630 --> 00:57:25.130]
And then this Ken guy's always telling me,

[00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:27.830]
oh, we'll see everybody's always complaining what we have to put up with.

[00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:28.670]
Well, I can see why.

[00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:30.590]
I can see why.

[00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:36.470]
As in CYA, which is what you try to do with a damn email, cover your ass.

[00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:37.510]
Forget about it.

[00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.190]
Thanks for the memories, but no thanks, okay?

[00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.790]
Tragic.

[00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:45.290]
Here's a fact from Slanny, Slann and Sammy.

[00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:48.710]
People over 35 should be dead, it's it.

[00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:50.310]
What's the end of me?

[00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:51.450]
Okay.

[00:57:52.070 --> 00:57:53.150]
That's I feel like it already.

[00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:54.230]
I'm checking out too.

[00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.370]
Like all the good cause we've had so far, it's going to be great.

[00:57:56.490 --> 00:57:58.090]
I don't care. I'm ready for a lot of good cause.

[00:57:58.270 --> 00:57:59.030]
I don't care what they are.

[00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:00.010]
Makes no difference.

[00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:02.810]
If you're being ludic on a planet cause, it's fine with me.

[00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.810]
I really mean that.

[00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:05.170]
I don't care.

[00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:06.130]
I've been talking to blind Mike.

[00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.790]
My, my, my.

[00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:07.890]
I want to hear some jingles, Mike.

[00:58:08.010 --> 00:58:08.270]
Come on.

[00:58:08.570 --> 00:58:09.050]
Let's go.

[00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:10.670]
Let's hear a few jingles.

[00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.030]
Because that's the least of my problems.

[00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:13.830]
I still get paid.

[00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.470]
My paycheck showed up early on the 7th.

[00:58:15.490 --> 00:58:16.110]
Today is the 10th.

[00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:16.490]
It's payday.

[00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:17.690]
They sent it on the 7th.

[00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:19.570]
So it'd be there when I got home just to impress me.

[00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:20.990]
Oh, look at that.

[00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:22.450]
And you were even paying you early.

[00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:24.390]
Don't you like us a lot?

[00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:24.730]
No.

[00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:25.870]
Don't you love the beesleaves?

[00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:26.030]
No.

[00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:27.350]
Don't you love working for these people?

[00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:27.510]
No.

[00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:28.170]
Only the money.

[00:58:29.030 --> 00:58:30.530]
And that's only cause it's in a contract.

[00:58:31.490 --> 00:58:31.870]
Believe me.

[00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:32.370]
They cry.

[00:58:32.370 --> 00:58:34.250]
Every time that they send that check out, they cry.

[00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:36.070]
Tears rolled on their eyes.

[00:58:36.330 --> 00:58:37.030]
I'm not serious.

[00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:39.570]
And of course Scott, when he gets his check, he cries.

[00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:41.850]
For a different reason.

[00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:42.110]
Right.

[00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.950]
Here's Miami.

[00:58:43.090 --> 00:58:43.330]
Hello.

[00:58:44.310 --> 00:58:44.930]
Yo, me.

[00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.910]
That sounds like you.

[00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:46.330]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:47.610]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:48.190]
Hey, Pa so.

[00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:51.230]
Hey, uh, that shows skin that I can't.

[00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:51.930]
Canceled, yeah.

[00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:55.030]
I think the, uh, naughty looking black dude and jail.

[00:58:55.310 --> 00:58:57.990]
Isn't that clearance Thomas III from the Moscow?

[00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.690]
Yes, it is.

[00:58:58.830 --> 00:58:59.650]
And he's a hundred years old.

[00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:00.330]
Can you believe that?

[00:59:00.330 --> 00:59:01.010]
He is.

[00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:02.410]
I thought that was in court.

[00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:03.830]
How come they cancel that, Joe?

[00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:05.150]
What's wrong with the public out there?

[00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:05.450]
I don't know.

[00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:06.310]
I thought it was okay.

[00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.230]
I thought it was a pretty good flesh in that, Joe.

[00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:10.550]
Yeah, but that definitely had.

[00:59:10.610 --> 00:59:11.090]
Hey, listen.

[00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:13.650]
Maybe the Reagan's got a canceled.

[00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:16.990]
I've got the, I've written down it.

[00:59:17.370 --> 00:59:18.910]
That they got together with the Bushes.

[00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.210]
Yeah.

[00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:21.450]
Hey, they got together in the bushes.

[00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:24.370]
You think Bob Greasy was cringing up in the booth

[00:59:24.370 --> 00:59:26.750]
when he was watching his daughter get gang rape yesterday?

[00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:30.450]
Oh, man.

[00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:32.730]
Oh, no.

[00:59:33.350 --> 00:59:33.470]
What?

[00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:35.390]
I was sick and living here.

[00:59:36.250 --> 00:59:39.930]
Brian and Bob Berlin could get together and make little girl cornerback.

[00:59:40.030 --> 00:59:41.870]
It's a good thing he wasn't listening to more in the broadcast

[00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.050]
because Mo did say gang rape is funny.

[00:59:44.130 --> 00:59:44.730]
He did say that.

[00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:46.050]
I have a great day, pal.

[00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:46.750]
You're out of material.

[00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:47.650]
Please, I hope.

[00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:51.690]
5 6 7 0 5 60 from WQAM.

[00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.830]
And pound 5 60.

[00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:53.990]
You got a lot of good stuff in here.

[00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:54.670]
I can't believe that.

[00:59:54.830 --> 00:59:55.990]
I can't wait till Friday.

[00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.290]
Hey, day.

[00:59:57.590 --> 00:59:59.510]
We just play mode-roppings today, huh?

[00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:00.610]
Look how much Scott's making.

[01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:02.250]
50 a day, sent.

[01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:06.010]
11 past 11 at 5 60.

[01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.590]
I see there's no showbending at Pompeyville.

[01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.310]
Parts of it are not ripped them while I'm doing their spot

[01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:10.910]
because Dick Feinberg and Steve Wolf are getting upset.

[01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:14.210]
So Kevin Wallace and Brad Cramer

[01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.890]
went to Raceway last night, fat rich.

[01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.850]
Just a message to Rich.

[01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:18.590]
I'll be there tonight Rich with Bells on.

[01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:20.170]
Okay, I'm gonna go to the hockey game tomorrow night.

[01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.810]
I'm gonna make the best of it this week.

[01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:22.310]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:24.090]
Unless I'm sick from this place.

[01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:25.110]
Oh, man.

[01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.210]
And he's right.

[01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:26.890]
Where is Moses?

[01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:29.790]
Is Moses supposed to be here last week?

[01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:31.550]
Oh, no.

[01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.130]
Now, don't tell me he's not gonna show up

[01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:35.310]
because that's gonna like Tessio said,

[01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:36.290]
screw up all my plans.

[01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:39.630]
We gotta get Rush all that OxyContin.

[01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:42.070]
Or he's never gonna get out.

[01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:45.170]
12 minutes after 11 at 5 60 WQM.

[01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.310]
Hey, all you harness racing and horse racing fans.

[01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.730]
Pompeyville Park is doing it.

[01:00:49.110 --> 01:00:50.910]

Every live racing day.

[01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:05.250]
All you old cockers go out.

[01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:06.670]
And if you like your poker, hello.

[01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.910]
Pompeyville Park is open seven days a week.

And night, featuring the best in Simulcasting.

Harness, through a bright, highly action fall across North America.

[01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:15.470]
Including Mohawk and Woodbine, of course.

[01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:17.590]
And don't forget that general parking and admission

[01:01:17.590 --> 01:01:19.690]
are always free at Pompeyville Park today for the live racing.

[01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:22.630]
New this season at the track of 20% increase in purses.

A nightly giveaway of a $400 betting voucher.

And a revamped free Powerplay Rewards program.

[01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:28.430]
That gives you points read to betting.

[01:01:28.530 --> 01:01:29.450]
The horses are playing poker.

Pompeyville Park where Wally Hennessy is most definitely the anti-crystall.

[01:01:48.930 --> 01:01:51.110]
And my life in Lowell's.

[01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.030]
This is 42560.

[01:01:53.590 --> 01:01:55.350]
Way to Way M.

[01:01:57.070 --> 01:01:57.950]

Mom is proud of you, Mo.

[01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:03.430]
Nice call, baby.

[01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:06.910]
When it's done, let it out.

[01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:09.030]
New this season watch the TV.

[01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:10.650]
Put the finger up there.

Whoa, white love to know.

[01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:15.710]
White love to know what Christian's super fun.

[01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:17.870]
Read five in the corner.

[01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.050]
While fondling their nuts.

[01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:21.690]
Whoa, white love to know.

[01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.650]
White love to know what Christian's super fun.

[01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:28.350]
Postal, white and tasty from the fascinating.

[01:02:30.290 --> 01:02:33.690]
It's hailing back to macaroni and cheese.

[01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:37.670]
Cut holes in the bitchy, just the tasty reproduce.

[01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:42.470]
That's just about all they're allowed to do.

[01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.570]
White love to know, white love to know.

[01:02:50.550 --> 01:02:53.050]
White love to know, white love to know.

[01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:59.450]
White love to know, white love to know.

[01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:03.630]
Do they get a swollen foot while leaning out their guns?

[01:03:03.810 --> 01:03:06.390]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know.

[01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:08.150]
With Christians who perform.

[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:10.490]
Do they polish out the fish?

[01:03:10.490 --> 01:03:12.530]
On the campaign of the truck.

[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:15.470]
Whoa, white love to know, white love to know.

[01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:17.070]
With Christians who perform.

[01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.650]
Read and stand and eat and sit back down.

[01:03:20.810 --> 01:03:21.970]
I can't eat you.

[01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:26.210]
And watch it all down with the twelve-hack of fruit.

[01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.430]
Live a life of order up to heaven, you go.

[01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:35.090]
Got only smile upon pouring that whole.

[01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:39.970]
Whoa, white love to know.

[01:03:39.970 --> 01:03:42.430]
White love to know, white love to know.

[01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:45.570]
Yeah, you have love to know, white love to know.

[01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:46.770]
White love to know.

[01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:56.730]
Look at that, that's the best.

[01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:58.310]
59, 15 is 59.

[01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.610]
That's too bad.

[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:01.150]
14, 3, partly cloudy.

[01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:02.350]
You getting a kid in that squad?

[01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:04.330]
John Jaros wants to know the weather in Rome.

[01:04:04.330 --> 01:04:04.850]
Excellent.

[01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:06.790]
Look at that, maybe a little on no rain.

[01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:07.810]
I don't see any rain at all.

[01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:11.170]
15, 16, 61 and low 40s.

[01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.710]
That's too bad.

[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:12.750]
Excellent.

[01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:13.730]
Thank you very much, sir.

[01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:16.130]
Everybody's coming and giving me the chance for a band of pears.

[01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.490]
You see, they wanted a way to come back so they could suck around.

[01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:19.210]
Thank you very much.

[01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:21.110]
And have a great time in Rome.

[01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:21.610]
In Rome.

[01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:22.630]
Say hi to Papa.

[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:23.590]
Why are you over there?

[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:25.270]
Give me a high sign for me.

[01:04:26.170 --> 01:04:26.730]
Give me some oxygen.

[01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.790]
2, 11, 19, at 5, 60, W and Q.

[01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:29.910]
It looks like he could use it.

[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:30.450]
The Pope.

[01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:31.670]
Not a good shape, huh?

[01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:35.190]
If the Pope would only smoke a little bit more dope, you know, the good stuff.

[01:04:35.590 --> 01:04:37.010]
If you only would have had Georgia's phone number.

[01:04:37.490 --> 01:04:42.630]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T, and for Ryzen Wireless Line.

[01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:43.770]
I think I'm finally adjusting.

[01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:45.910]
I would like a culture shock being in this place.

[01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:48.850]
And by the way, Ken, nice job at that, do with that limo.

[01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:50.490]
I don't want to do the whole show on that, do I?

[01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:51.210]
Yes.

[01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:53.470]
Just such a horseball job, man.

[01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:56.390]
And when somebody is bragging you, oh, I was up there in 35 minutes.

[01:04:56.870 --> 01:05:01.430]
Why, you were standing out there waiting praying that somebody might show up.

[01:05:02.590 --> 01:05:07.670]
And of course, he, he, this guy, he, didn't have to do this, and he had to do that.

[01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.710]
He, and I couldn't give him, right?

[01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:12.970]
So, otherwise, he hadn't got any clue who drove me home or anything surrounding it.

[01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.730]
He just called some banana boat company there at the airport, some desperate limo flunky place.

[01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:20.290]
Why don't you just tell me, hey, listen, I'm very sorry, but I have an emergency.

[01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:23.950]
My dog just cracked on a carpet at home, and you have to take a cab.

[01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:27.650]
I wouldn't have been too happy about it, but at least I'd have been home, right?

[01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:28.530]
Sure.

[01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:32.030]
And so, how much more could it, how much more seriously could it have cost me?

[01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.210]
I gave her a $60 tip.

[01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:35.250]
How much more could it cost me to have her cab?

[01:05:35.490 --> 01:05:36.430]
About 30, man.

[01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:37.070]
Yeah, right?

[01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.490]
From day to broward.

[01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:39.170]
How much would that be?

[01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:41.790]
But I would say about 90, right?

[01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:42.890]
And no more than a bill.

[01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.590]
No more than a bill.

[01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:44.170]
Oh, yeah, right.

[01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:45.190]
I can handle it.

[01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:48.130]
It's about what I lose at Pompa-Doh Park tonight, because we got no show betting.

[01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:49.510]
I'm going to bet $2 to show.

[01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.190]
How do you like that, Dick, and all the cybercasting?

[01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:52.550]
Just as the silent protest.

[01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:55.730]
I'll have $2 to show on the three and the four.

[01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:03.150]
171 votes, Wisethnick or racial group, is most protective or paranoid about its own people.

[01:06:03.810 --> 01:06:07.010]
Blacks 80, like Miriam Elephant, for example, Jews 53.

[01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:09.530]
Like Meyer Lansky.

[01:06:10.530 --> 01:06:12.170]
You ever hear any Jews defending Meyer Lansky?

[01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:12.730]
No.

[01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.990]
No.

[01:06:13.830 --> 01:06:17.030]
Cubans 28, Muslims 8, and Italians 2.

[01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:18.750]
Two grease balls out there, huh?

[01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:19.750]
Two for the Italians.

[01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:22.790]
So we got a whole bunch of checks here, which is good.

[01:06:24.010 --> 01:06:25.490]
Well, that's good news for you, a fush.

[01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:26.650]
Why me ain't coming until Thursday?

[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.770]
That means maybe you can get a scam.

[01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:29.770]
Somebody's hockey tickets before he gets his ass in it.

[01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.270]
See, I don't understand that.

[01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:33.770]
George, you're really well, fell down on the job on at the deal.

[01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:35.110]
He was supposed to be here today.

[01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:37.870]
He was supposed to be here today.

[01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.450]
He was supposed to be here a week ago.

[01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:41.210]
He was supposed to be here a week ago, okay?

[01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:42.210]
Moishi?

[01:06:43.350 --> 01:06:44.370]
Not cut, then, Moishi.

[01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:45.790]
I'm going to have to sick your daddy on you.

[01:06:45.850 --> 01:06:46.870]
Oh, speaking of your daddy.

[01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:48.610]
Oh, this Prince Charles thing.

[01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:50.550]
I have been telling the audience for years.

[01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:52.870]
There's a lot more than one queen at Buckingham Palace.

[01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:53.930]
I've been telling them that.

[01:06:54.090 --> 01:06:55.810]
They said, oh, yeah, that's Neil, what a clown.

[01:06:56.010 --> 01:06:56.930]
I told you.

[01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:59.770]
And you want to know how he knew that?

[01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:00.550]
Because they're Brits.

[01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:04.530]
The British guys are almost all queens.

[01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:05.930]
Almost every one of them.

[01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:06.630]
Oh, yeah, it's like Spicks.

[01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:07.090]
Same thing.

[01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.890]
I'll mark it down.

[01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:10.530]
Top 8 quiz, Charles, about his sexuality.

[01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:11.490]
I got a thing here.

[01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:13.450]
I'll take some calls for us, but it goes on a great length

[01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:17.430]
from the daily mirror of London at great length.

[01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:18.510]
It's about this long, he said.

[01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:20.190]
That's why Danny used to laugh all the time.

[01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:23.110]
Here's a lady in Evan's shirt, hello.

[01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:24.110]
Hi, Neil.

[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.490]
A belated happy birthday.

[01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:26.110]
Thank you.

[01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:29.190]
And you need to suck on his dang cough drop.

[01:07:29.410 --> 01:07:29.910]
That'll help you.

[01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:31.230]
I'm not sucking on anything right now.

[01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.890]
I knew I opened the door for that.

[01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:34.070]
Fine.

[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:37.670]
Oh, my, do I thanks to the van lady for my nice birthday card.

[01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:38.150]
Thanks, sweetheart.

[01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:38.850]
I hope you feel better.

[01:07:39.030 --> 01:07:39.310]
Go ahead.

[01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:39.990]
You're welcome.

[01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:41.270]
No, not you with the van lady.

[01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:42.450]
Oh, I know, but that's me.

[01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.790]
Oh, it's not.

[01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:45.070]
Oh, okay, okay.

[01:07:45.110 --> 01:07:46.190]
This is the crazy lady.

[01:07:46.790 --> 01:07:47.150]
Yeah.

[01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:48.550]
And her nice day.

[01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:51.630]
I said I talked to anybody, but not her.

[01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:54.070]
She's a lunatic, crazy person.

[01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:57.310]
5670560, pound five, what?

[01:07:57.850 --> 01:07:58.490]
Aren't they all?

[01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:59.850]
No, they're not all well.

[01:08:00.490 --> 01:08:00.930]
Most.

[01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:03.070]
Here's a call from Pompano.

[01:08:03.170 --> 01:08:03.350]
Hello.

[01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:04.170]
Hello.

[01:08:04.550 --> 01:08:04.910]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:06.270]
Hey, this is Kim.

[01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:07.190]
The guy.

[01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:08.610]
He's got an asshole.

[01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:15.330]
5670560, pound five 60 on the AT&T line.

[01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:16.090]
Here's Carl Springs.

[01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:16.430]
Hello.

[01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.830]
Carl Springs.

[01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:20.030]
I knew you.

[01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.830]
Good morning.

[01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.050]
Good morning, too.

[01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.750]
The first time, Carl.

[01:08:21.970 --> 01:08:24.450]
Well, I had, I heard before someone would call.

[01:08:25.730 --> 01:08:26.330]
Someone what?

[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.770]
You heard before what?

[01:08:30.210 --> 01:08:30.710]
He's gone.

[01:08:30.790 --> 01:08:31.110]
He's dead.

[01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:34.330]
Someone just, I think he just got right out of the goddamn plane.

[01:08:34.330 --> 01:08:34.890]
How do you like that?

[01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:35.910]
Just like, what's your name?

[01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.970]
Evol, what's that on passions?

[01:08:37.690 --> 01:08:39.610]
What's an amcasing Julian broader back in there?

[01:08:39.850 --> 01:08:40.250]
That's right.

[01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:41.450]
Well, why did you do that, Julian?

[01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.090]
I'm going to beat you.

[01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:42.910]
I'm going to kill you.

[01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:43.990]
That TC, man.

[01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:46.430]
Just come to take a couple of doggie downers with a TC.

[01:08:46.650 --> 01:08:47.250]
Just one.

[01:08:49.690 --> 01:08:52.370]
I'm trying to think where the hell we left off on Friday on that show, the wing.

[01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:54.270]
Charlie is floating up on shore.

[01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.990]
She's running around.

[01:08:55.310 --> 01:08:55.990]
They got the lights on.

[01:08:56.130 --> 01:08:56.930]
Charlie, they're on the island.

[01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.990]
They got her cornered.

[01:08:59.070 --> 01:09:01.310]
By the way, little Jerry with a squiggly head right.

[01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:02.250]
You don't have to waste your time.

[01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:03.070]
You don't have to sign these.

[01:09:03.130 --> 01:09:04.170]
It's always you, okay?

[01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:07.790]
But the fact that I'm here now, even waste some of our fax paper, which I see you're doing already.

[01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.650]
Little squiggly right in Jerry that's been faxing me for six years with it.

[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:14.170]
You said it, but you're listening every minute of every day.

[01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:15.090]
Art is sweetheart.

[01:09:15.410 --> 01:09:17.350]
You're listening every single minute of every day.

[01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:19.270]
You got your thumb deep up your ass.

[01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:20.050]
Listen to this show.

[01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:23.190]
Massage in your prostate, which is probably good for you.

[01:09:24.250 --> 01:09:24.710]
Oh, no.

[01:09:24.790 --> 01:09:25.750]
Now, why is he doing that?

[01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.630]
Why is Jeff in the pizza lockout?

[01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:30.310]
This just, just, just frost my fat ass.

[01:09:30.710 --> 01:09:32.010]
You're saying you talked to anybody?

[01:09:32.950 --> 01:09:35.890]
I didn't, I'm talking about callers, not people like you.

[01:09:36.370 --> 01:09:36.790]
Oh, okay.

[01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.410]
Now, I just wanted to tell you I'm going to come and visit you, Der.

[01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:40.710]
No, no, no, you're not.

[01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:41.470]
No, you're not.

[01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:42.630]
You're not bringing me any food.

[01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:43.790]
I don't have to bring food.

[01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.270]
I have to go there to talk to the salespeople, letting you wait.

[01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:47.370]
So I was just going to say hello.

[01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:51.190]
I've drove past your place in Davy last night when I went to Walgreens in a plantation,

[01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:51.650]
rather.

[01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.250]
Yes.

[01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.270]
And the help looked real only in there.

[01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:57.370]
I have certain things to tell you about.

[01:09:57.730 --> 01:09:57.910]
Yeah.

[01:09:58.090 --> 01:09:59.150]
There's going to be some changes.

[01:09:59.470 --> 01:09:59.630]
Yeah.

[01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:02.250]
So, but nobody ever listened to me.

[01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.650]
Now, you see, one thing I've learned in my life, all these hundred years that I've lived,

[01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:09.270]
is you can never tell anybody anything because no matter how smart I am,

[01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:10.690]
everybody else is so much smarter.

[01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:11.110]
You know what I mean?

[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:12.650]
I was not going to do it with smart.

[01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:13.950]
It's the same thing with kids.

[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.270]
You can't, they don't have a lot of experience.

[01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.870]
They know everything.

[01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:17.350]
That's what I'm saying.

[01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:17.810]
That's right.

[01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:18.470]
They know it all.

[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:21.090]
No matter what you tell them, okay, we have to learn a hard way.

[01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.290]
It's human nature.

[01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:24.050]
Everybody has to learn from their mistakes.

[01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:25.150]
I have friends like that.

[01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:27.050]
No matter what I try to tell them, they're smarter than me.

[01:10:27.170 --> 01:10:27.670]
They know it all.

[01:10:27.810 --> 01:10:28.410]
Okay, go ahead.

[01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:29.150]
Scrup your life.

[01:10:29.370 --> 01:10:29.890]
Have a good time.

[01:10:30.570 --> 01:10:31.970]
Because it's going to get some kind of disease.

[01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:35.050]
The good thing is, if you learn from penicillin.

[01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.310]
If you learn from your mistakes, you're okay.

[01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:39.170]
If you don't learn from them, then you're an idiot.

[01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:40.390]
That's what Al Goldstein said.

[01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:41.250]
Another good friend of yours.

[01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:43.270]
Yeah, that's another man with a lot of problems.

[01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.870]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:45.130]
Well, that's why I threw him in there, right?

[01:10:45.630 --> 01:10:45.990]
Uh-huh.

[01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.250]
Hey, by the way, Al, let me have the keys to your apartment in Amsterdam.

[01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:49.390]
Okay, you're not using it.

[01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.630]
He's never going to get to go there again because he can't leave the country.

[01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:53.970]
I don't think he's healthy enough to go, man.

[01:10:54.130 --> 01:10:54.930]
He's taking a beat.

[01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:56.130]
What do you mean by that?

[01:10:56.730 --> 01:10:57.550]
Mentally and physically.

[01:10:58.090 --> 01:11:00.450]
By hurting you lost 100 pounds, but that's not the way to do it.

[01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.250]
Yeah.

[01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:01.610]
Yeah.

[01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:04.370]
Anyway, it's good to have you in town.

[01:11:04.510 --> 01:11:04.970]
No, it's not.

[01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:06.290]
No, it is not good to be in town.

[01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:06.770]
It's a nightmare.

[01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:07.390]
It's a nightmare.

[01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.830]
Why?

[01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.990]
Why is it good for you to be a guy in town?

[01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.670]
Because I could come and be a pain in the ass and see you.

[01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:14.270]
You know what I want to see you.

[01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:15.050]
I know what you look like.

[01:11:15.230 --> 01:11:16.590]
I know what you're exactly what you look like.

[01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:17.310]
You never change.

[01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:18.410]
I have a new look.

[01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:20.170]
We'll be talking about my ears even shorter.

[01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.630]
Yeah.

[01:11:21.090 --> 01:11:21.570]
You know?

[01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.550]
That's why nobody's got an implantation anymore.

[01:11:23.610 --> 01:11:23.770]
Yeah.

[01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:25.010]
I want to see some skinhead.

[01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:26.470]
I'm in Davy now.

[01:11:26.690 --> 01:11:27.930]
The Davy is my story.

[01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.090]
Oh, so in other words, you're not connected with the other one?

[01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:34.950]
At the end of the year, there will be a different name and a different story.

[01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:35.610]
I'm not a bad person there.

[01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:37.470]
No, no, no, no, no.

[01:11:37.470 --> 01:11:37.770]
Yeah.

[01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:41.210]
So I'll show you how I'm going to detail this.

[01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:41.510]
Totally.

[01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:42.950]
It'll even be a different name.

[01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:43.610]
Yeah.

[01:11:43.710 --> 01:11:45.090]
Just don't tell anybody, okay?

[01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:45.490]
Okay.

[01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:46.730]
We don't want anybody to know.

[01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:48.110]
You know, they got the what?

[01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.550]
Yeah.

[01:11:48.650 --> 01:11:48.830]
Look.

[01:11:49.230 --> 01:11:49.430]
Yeah.

[01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:49.870]
There you go.

[01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:51.730]
Anyway.

[01:11:52.850 --> 01:11:54.330]
So it's good to hear you from here.

[01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.550]

[01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:55.530]
How about you're good buddies?

[01:11:55.530 --> 01:11:56.530]
The dolphins, baby.

[01:11:56.670 --> 01:11:58.090]
That was a beautiful performance.

[01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:59.030]
Thank you very much.

[01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:01.930]
See, I'm thinking, you know, Pat Riley was smart enough to equip

[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:02.910]
before they could fire him.

[01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.190]
Because they lose every game.

[01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:09.090]
And then my, listen to me, my Kenan gets canned after the game in St. Louis.

[01:12:09.690 --> 01:12:13.310]
And I'll want that if Wayne had any brains at all, wants that would be canned already.

[01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:13.930]
He'd be fired.

[01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:14.990]
Not true.

[01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:17.590]
They're going to still end up 10 and 6 in the play.

[01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:18.930]
Oh, you are so cool, man.

[01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:21.090]
And the Ravens are going to kick their ass on Sunday.

[01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.030]
You're a dream and man.

[01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:23.450]
You're in Lala land.

[01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:24.070]
You're one of those two.

[01:12:24.150 --> 01:12:26.530]
See, see, this is what kills me about dolphin fans.

[01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.290]
Like me, I'm a leaf fan.

[01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:29.870]
They're actually playing better than I thought they would.

[01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:31.130]
But at least I know when they suck.

[01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.810]
Okay, I don't pretend.

[01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:33.450]
Oh, my team is the best.

[01:12:33.610 --> 01:12:34.750]
We're going to win the Stanley Cup.

[01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:36.010]
We're talking Super Bowl.

[01:12:36.410 --> 01:12:39.730]
All the fans down here, always, they're in delusional state, like you.

[01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:40.390]
You're dreaming.

[01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:42.050]
That's what a fan is.

[01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.470]
Yeah.

[01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:47.010]
We're just because Louis Alaboy used to take showers in a back there at the loft.

[01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:48.730]
That doesn't mean you have to get that tight with him, you know?

[01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:51.970]
Well, you know, I happen to have been a dolphin fan from 1966.

[01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:53.570]
Well, my son of these two.

[01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:55.150]
My commiserations.

[01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:57.490]
And I can, I plan on keeping that up.

[01:12:58.210 --> 01:13:00.310]
And they're going to come back and surprise everybody.

[01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:01.150]
Yeah, okay, Jeff.

[01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:04.250]
I'm sure that everybody at Soft Florida feels a lot better here.

[01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:06.610]
And you say that everybody has ups and downs.

[01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.970]
Right.

[01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:08.450]
Just like the pizza loft.

[01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:10.630]
They're manic depressive with no ups.

[01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:11.730]
That's the dolphins problem.

[01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:12.690]
Is it bomber?

[01:13:12.930 --> 01:13:13.730]
Have a great day, Jeff.

[01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.470]
I'll see you soon and don't bring any food in here.

[01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:16.510]
That's going to be out of you.

[01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:17.970]
I'll put that day you place right now.

[01:13:18.170 --> 01:13:18.490]
Oh, problem.

[01:13:18.770 --> 01:13:19.070]
Okay.

[01:13:19.210 --> 01:13:19.630]
Take care.

[01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:20.370]
Bye-bye.

[01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:21.450]
Wow.

[01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.870]
28 past 11.

[01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:23.990]
Nobody will ever listen to me.

[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:25.150]
You know, my whole life.

[01:13:25.250 --> 01:13:26.250]
That's one of my great frustrations.

[01:13:26.250 --> 01:13:27.950]
You try to tell people things for their own good.

[01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:29.030]
Oh, what does he know?

[01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:30.030]
You're so negative.

[01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.710]
And then right away, well, we're going bankrupt.

[01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:35.110]
Hey, I'll tell you a place that's really great.

[01:13:35.230 --> 01:13:36.890]
One of the best kept dining secrets in town.

[01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:38.550]
It's going strong in Soft Florida.

[01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:40.610]
It's a cross-bring schooled Co-C Food Grill.

[01:13:41.130 --> 01:13:42.730]
They just celebrated their one year anniversary.

[01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:44.850]
And they got three and I have big bulging stars

[01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:46.610]
from the Sunsetville Showtime dining review.

[01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:49.190]
The Gold Co-C Food Grill's got all kinds of great dishes,

[01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:52.670]
including mango plum salmon, almond-crusted mahi-mahi,

[01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:56.070]
orange honey glazed sea bass, and crab and shrimp stuffed trout.

[01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:58.870]
There's a great bar atmosphere at the Gold Co-C Food Grill

[01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:00.850]
with an extensive wine and martinulus.

[01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:03.910]
Big fat martinis at happy hour, only five and a half bucks.

[01:14:04.370 --> 01:14:05.730]
From Fort Boyd, damn it.

[01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.410]
The levels on this board are in nightmare.

[01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:09.150]
Our engineering department sucks in the case.

[01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:10.050]
I forgot to tell you that.

[01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:10.670]
Jesus.

[01:14:11.930 --> 01:14:13.890]
Big martinis at happy hour, only five and a half bucks

[01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:15.710]
from four to seven pm every day, seven days a week.

[01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.810]
The Gold Co-C Food Grill and Croll Springs

[01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:22.830]
at 2752 North University Drive inside the beautiful prestigious walk shopping center.

[01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:26.670]
954-255 fishes, the number for reservations and more information.

[01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.030]
954-255 fish.

[01:14:29.410 --> 01:14:31.670]
You can dive inside, around side, large parties and private functions.

[01:14:31.870 --> 01:14:34.690]
Welcome to experience the best kept secret in lunch and dinner.

[01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.970]
Dining it's the Gold Co-C Food Grill and Croll Springs,

[01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:42.050]
and you'll find them at 2752 North University Drive inside the walk shopping center.

[01:14:42.170 --> 01:14:45.810]
You'll always find great seafood and great prices at the Gold Co-C Food Grill.

[01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:47.690]
It's my and local.

[01:14:48.090 --> 01:14:49.970]
This is Fort Boyd, 0560.

[01:14:50.610 --> 01:14:51.790]
You're way, you way.

[01:14:54.450 --> 01:14:54.890]
Yeah!

[01:14:55.710 --> 01:14:58.530]
Are you searching for a new sensation in dining?

[01:14:58.970 --> 01:15:01.590]
If you're tired of that same old bump and grind,

[01:15:02.070 --> 01:15:05.130]
then why not revisit an old friend and eat at the Y?

[01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.090]
That's right folks, because here at the Y,

[01:15:08.490 --> 01:15:12.050]
we've turned our old facilities into a mouth-watering buffet,

[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:15.590]
and you've never seen us read like this one.

[01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:19.190]
Featuring some of the most delicious entrees you've ever tasted.

[01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:22.770]
And if you like eating Mexican, you'll love the Y

[01:15:22.770 --> 01:15:25.250]
because every night is taco night.

[01:15:25.790 --> 01:15:28.390]
Or if you enjoy the taste of wild game,

[01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:34.330]
our chefs prepare a lips-snack-ing sauteed rabbit baked in a golden flower crust.

[01:15:34.710 --> 01:15:35.470]
That's right.

[01:15:36.150 --> 01:15:36.710]
Air pie.

[01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:38.110]
It's all here.

[01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:40.650]
Literally, mounds of piping hot food,

[01:15:40.670 --> 01:15:42.930]
including juicy steaks, cooked medium rare.

[01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:44.870]
Because when you eat at the Y,

[01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.790]
all the meat is pink in the middle.

[01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:48.990]
Or if you like spicy food,

[01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:50.590]
here's an unusual entree,

[01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:53.270]
a red hot-cage and mule steak.

[01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:56.410]
Talk about a piece of ass that brings tears to your eyes.

[01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:58.850]
It's lips-snack-ing good to chew,

[01:15:59.070 --> 01:15:59.750]
whoop-woop-woop-woop-no-ness.

[01:16:00.230 --> 01:16:02.270]
So, the next time you eat out,

[01:16:02.610 --> 01:16:04.030]
slide on down to the Y.

[01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:05.710]
It's not the perchie highway,

[01:16:05.770 --> 01:16:06.530]
I'm the number one egg.

[01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:09.350]
You need a bow-bye-gurth.

[01:16:10.330 --> 01:16:13.590]
You need a bow-bye-gurth.

[01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:16.450]
26 till noon at 5.60 WDQ,

[01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:17.910]
and I know some people probably have eaten it

[01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:18.870]
the Y all weekend long.

[01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:20.910]
Widow leaves, I already had this story on.

[01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:23.610]
Why are you people faxing me stuff that we already had on?

[01:16:23.770 --> 01:16:25.030]
We talked about this on Friday,

[01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.170]
Joan Crock leaving $200 million to NPR.

[01:16:27.170 --> 01:16:27.650]
Remember that?

[01:16:29.430 --> 01:16:30.310]
Remember that, Scott?

[01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:31.250]
Yeah.

[01:16:31.410 --> 01:16:33.290]
Now, what are you listening to, and are you listening to TV?

[01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:34.810]
Scott is listening to TV.

[01:16:36.150 --> 01:16:36.830]
Oh, I'm not.

[01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:38.090]
Well, what are you listening to?

[01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:41.150]
I have a buzz in my ear.

[01:16:41.370 --> 01:16:43.010]
No, no. I just, I could hear it in the hear.

[01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.590]
It was so loud.

[01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:44.890]
Scott's watching television.

[01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.830]
I said to him,

[01:16:45.970 --> 01:16:47.870]
remember on Tuesday we had Friday we talked about?

[01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:50.050]
He doesn't even know I'm talking to him.

[01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:51.890]
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.

[01:16:51.930 --> 01:16:52.470]
I'm going to get up.

[01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:54.270]
Wouldn't that be something if I got up and walked out?

[01:16:54.670 --> 01:16:55.510]
I am so tempted.

[01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:56.190]
You have no idea.

[01:16:57.250 --> 01:16:58.590]
This just ain't working, man.

[01:16:58.710 --> 01:17:01.650]
This studio, the levels are all over the goddamn place.

[01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:03.530]
Engineering's a disaster at QA,

[01:17:03.530 --> 01:17:04.510]
and we're a barrispiet,

[01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:06.150]
and we're pissed off and fired up about it.

[01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:08.270]
And Scott's an idiot who's watching television in there.

[01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:11.010]
You know, we need that TV in there like we need hemorrhoids, okay?

[01:17:12.130 --> 01:17:13.450]
Why do we have a TV in there?

[01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.490]
Why does George have to have a goddamn TV in there?

[01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:16.230]
That's him again.

[01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:18.250]
That's George B. and George.

[01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:21.970]
Watching goddamn Playboy TV and a bunch of tinny crap on it,

[01:17:22.030 --> 01:17:22.830]
we don't need that.

[01:17:22.930 --> 01:17:24.130]
We're supposed to be doing a radio show.

[01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.650]
I mean, if there's something in the world going on,

[01:17:27.670 --> 01:17:28.790]
like here's a CNN.

[01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:30.930]
There's a chicken flap.

[01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:32.150]
They're flappin' it at a KFC.

[01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.390]
That's the hot story.

[01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:35.390]
There's nothing going on.

[01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:36.690]
More dead bodies in Iraq.

[01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:37.330]
It's about it.

[01:17:38.430 --> 01:17:40.250]
Here's a fact from a Denver fan who says,

[01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:42.090]
have any hear you're in Banana Town, Florida.

[01:17:42.710 --> 01:17:45.870]
Came in just in time to see those sorry Miami-Fore fans morning.

[01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:48.190]
I love the days after disastrous weekend.

[01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:49.210]
I love that Dolphin defense.

[01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:50.530]
Says the Denver fan.

[01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:52.390]
Well, just wait till the Patriots kick your ass.

[01:17:53.150 --> 01:17:54.290]
And that's right there what he did.

[01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:57.770]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[01:17:57.950 --> 01:17:59.930]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:01.310]
And for Rise and Wireless Line.

[01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:02.950]
Give him a lot of great calls on here today.

[01:18:03.330 --> 01:18:04.470]
Prince Charles is a queen.

[01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:07.450]
They thought he was waiting to be king.

[01:18:07.690 --> 01:18:08.450]
Well, comes to fight out.

[01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:09.090]
He's going to be king.

[01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.770]
A queen.

[01:18:09.870 --> 01:18:10.870]
Now let's see, 3680.

[01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:12.030]
What do we get?

[01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:13.630]
Do we need any of these checks up that we got today?

[01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:16.470]
Was I supposed to be keeping them?

[01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.930]
No, no, no.

[01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:17.730]
I neither one of us was.

[01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:18.570]
I was my fault.

[01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:22.110]
I showed it because it's probably like around 37, 39 grand though.

[01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:25.230]
We'll get to 40 by the end of the week where I'm getting out of this place.

[01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:29.410]
Prince Charles was questioned about his sexuality by his most senior aided emerge yesterday.

[01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:31.150]
Says the Daily Mirror of London.

[01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:37.830]
Sir Michael Pete had a face-to-face meeting with Charles just after becoming his private secretary in August of last year.

[01:18:38.210 --> 01:18:41.690]
A royal spokeswoman said the talks him that all sorts of rumor and innuendo.

[01:18:41.690 --> 01:18:51.390]
So, yesterday Charles flew back from Oman to receive to face a renewed storm over claims of an incident between a servant and a senior royal that Princetonized this ever to place.

[01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:56.570]
Former press adviser Mark Bolin said, Pete had asked him, do you think Charles is bisexual?

[01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:08.290]
Royal aide, Sir Michael Pete, a man with a reputation for seeking the truth, talked face-to-face with Prince Charles last year as rumor and innuendo raids it emerged yesterday.

[01:19:08.690 --> 01:19:17.570]
Their meeting was revealed as Charles flew home from the Gulf into a growing furor over a former servant's claims to have witnessed an incident involving another palace employee and a senior royal.

[01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.910]
The rape, this is not a new story, by the way, this start was out months ago.

[01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.630]
Really?

[01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:26.470]
Oh yeah, about how one of the senior palace employees was supposedly raped while I wanted Charles servants.

[01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:27.990]
I must have been watching TV.

[01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:32.610]
Charles declared on Thursday night that he had no part in that and he said the incident did not take place.

[01:19:32.610 --> 01:19:38.970]
Yesterday, the controversy was reignited when his former press adviser Mark Bolin said Sir Michael had asked him, do you think Charles is bisexual?

[01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.910]
Would you like some spotted dick with your lunch?

[01:19:43.330 --> 01:19:50.790]
Clarence House has now indicated that Sir Michael, Charles private secretary, did have a push-to-push meeting with the Prince of Discussed Rumors circulating about his sexuality.

[01:19:51.130 --> 01:19:52.890]
He's a fag, he's another queen.

[01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:58.090]
And of course, Prince Edward, we know he's a fag and Prince Andrew, I'm here, does a fag, huh?

[01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:02.350]
And Prince Harry, he might as well be because he's so guy damn ugly, right?

[01:20:02.950 --> 01:20:03.110]
Sure.

[01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:04.310]
The moment of your red cheeks.

[01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.830]
Brackum.

[01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:06.690]
Yeah, they're too.

[01:20:07.730 --> 01:20:10.510]
Now let's see, there is a thing in here in this story, this is a very long story.

[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.970]
I got time.

[01:20:12.410 --> 01:20:15.550]
No, I'm not going to read the whole thing, it's too, because they don't care about it anyway.

[01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:19.510]
No, it talks about the incident.

[01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:21.130]
Oh here it is.

[01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:26.670]
Former Royal Valley, George Smith claims he was raped by a royal servant at St. James Palace.

[01:20:27.230 --> 01:20:33.610]
Mr. Smith, a veteran of Faulklands, the Abiga, Las Malvinus War, told Prince his Diana and she's understood it with taped his story.

[01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:38.010]
There have been investigations, and that might have been a good reason why they authored, you know what?

[01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:40.190]
That might be why they killed the bitch.

[01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:43.370]
There have been three investigations into the allegations.

[01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:45.430]
The palace and police both found no evidence.

[01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:47.970]
A probe last year by Sir Michael Pete also found nothing.

[01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:54.750]
Mr. Smith yesterday alleged he was stalked by a hooded gunman from 1966 beaten up until to keep your mouth shut or that'll be it.

[01:20:56.090 --> 01:20:58.890]
If you know what, I'm going to come in there physically, remove that TV set.

[01:20:59.510 --> 01:21:00.530]
What are you looking at?

[01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.690]
The Tab of Life, International on CNN.

[01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:07.530]
Why are you looking at it?

[01:21:07.670 --> 01:21:08.670]
First of all, it's not on now.

[01:21:08.850 --> 01:21:11.050]
Just took a look at four of the most popular died.

[01:21:11.190 --> 01:21:14.030]
I had that story on our website, I got it here, it was on yesterday.

[01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.810]
It's on our website already, it's old news CNN, okay honey?

[01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:20.550]
Put something new on like Prince Charles is a fag.

[01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:24.830]
You are so easily distracted, man, it's just unbelievable.

[01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:27.850]
You must be hanging around with Pharrell too much. Too many bad drugs.

[01:21:28.690 --> 01:21:29.870]
Too much bad drugs.

[01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.810]
560-50560.

[01:21:33.130 --> 01:21:34.690]
You know they got the what? Yeah, look.

[01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.370]
Count 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:39.990]
Now let's see the schedule shows here.

[01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:42.210]
The mad dog is going to be really fulmin at them out.

[01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.650]
Oh right.

[01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:43.710]
He's going to be here two to four.

[01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:45.310]
He is going to be suicidal, I bet.

[01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:48.390]
Then you got to hump where it's you was today four to seven.

[01:21:48.530 --> 01:21:49.830]
I guess I'm not going to see Hank today either.

[01:21:49.890 --> 01:21:51.210]
I haven't seen Hank in months.

[01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:53.010]
He's supposed to be here tomorrow though.

[01:21:53.210 --> 01:21:54.110]
Maybe I'll still be here.

[01:21:54.930 --> 01:21:56.310]
Ricky, were you sure with the Cleveland Rikki?

[01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:59.070]
Man, did you see when he got tackled by his hair that time?

[01:21:59.150 --> 01:22:00.810]
That's the third time the season that's happened already.

[01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:01.730]
Yes, seriously.

[01:22:02.090 --> 01:22:02.750]
You saw it didn't you?

[01:22:03.010 --> 01:22:03.630]
Yes I did.

[01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:06.430]
He got tackled by his locks by his Rostalox,

[01:22:07.170 --> 01:22:09.170]
which is one more good reason not to be wearing those.

[01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.370]
Okay, but it looks like crap.

[01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:13.370]
Who's the other dude on the team that's got the Rostalox?

[01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:14.790]
There's one other guy.

[01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:17.010]
No, seriously.

[01:22:17.150 --> 01:22:18.130]
There's one other player on the team.

[01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:18.570]
No, I know.

[01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:19.010]
I know.

[01:22:19.150 --> 01:22:19.590]
I just don't know.

[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:20.350]
He's got to say no.

[01:22:20.370 --> 01:22:21.290]
Let's go to the same barber.

[01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:25.690]
The Humber at four from Shula's Ricky William Show at the Cleveland

[01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:26.630]
and I'd seven eight o'clock.

[01:22:26.630 --> 01:22:27.530]
That should be an embarrassment.

[01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:30.730]
And then you got the Hercune Hotline and they that should be like a wake

[01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:31.490]
at Tony Romas,

[01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:33.730]
8K at 10 and mark Eisenberg overnight,

[01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:35.170]
which means you'll cast that away here tonight.

[01:22:36.090 --> 01:22:38.550]
Maybe Joe's going to just come in here and dittle with the board a little bit.

[01:22:38.850 --> 01:22:40.670]
That's what Scott just told me, Joe.

[01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.130]
He said, you come in here and do your guests and your

[01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:46.650]
auto racing crap and you dittle with the board and screw up the equipment all

[01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:47.570]
at the stuff like that.

[01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:48.630]
But then that's Scott.

[01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:49.530]
You know, he's a sourpuss.

[01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:51.590]
Here's Cutlerage.

[01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:51.830]
Hello.

[01:22:52.210 --> 01:22:53.810]
Hey, I want to talk about the dog.

[01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.830]
Go ahead.

[01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:56.470]
Just go record.

[01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:59.310]
Just close the door on a T-room there and talk all you want.

[01:22:59.410 --> 01:23:01.130]
Just talk to the little instrument, the little bowl.

[01:23:03.130 --> 01:23:03.490]
56670560.

[01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:05.490]
Now you know that's not going to be Miami on line nine.

[01:23:05.490 --> 01:23:07.290]
I've been trying to teach you this for a long time.

[01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:08.830]
You know it's going to be that chronic.

[01:23:09.170 --> 01:23:10.350]
Here's the chronic on line.

[01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:11.590]
Is Rost back here?

[01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:12.110]
Yes, see?

[01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:14.050]
56670560.

[01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:15.910]
Pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:17.830]
No rush eight back yet as a matter of fact.

[01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:20.890]
He's still waiting for the guy, Demoxy, con to show up this month.

[01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:24.710]
19 till noon at 560WQM.

[01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:25.590]
We'll let you know when he's back.

[01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:27.630]
Okay, pal, we'd like to give him a good old handy crap.

[01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:30.010]
Because he's full of it.

[01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:30.770]
You know, they got the what?

[01:23:31.090 --> 01:23:33.450]
Yeah, look, 1141 at 560QM.

[01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:34.990]
233 votes on that pool.

[01:23:35.850 --> 01:23:37.970]
And this all stems from that Miriam Elephanster,

[01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:39.310]
which I noticed nobody's talking about.

[01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:39.810]
That's okay.

[01:23:40.050 --> 01:23:40.650]
That's fine with me.

[01:23:40.650 --> 01:23:41.930]
It's like anything else.

[01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:43.030]
I don't have to say about it.

[01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:47.650]
Which ethnic or racial group is the most protective paranoid about its own people?

[01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:53.350]
Blacks 108, Jews 70, Cubans 42, Muslims 11, Italians 2.

[01:23:54.190 --> 01:23:57.990]
We should also put like Catholics on there, even though they're not ethnic or racial.

[01:23:58.190 --> 01:23:59.250]
Should have put Catholics, right?

[01:23:59.670 --> 01:23:59.890]
Sure.

[01:24:00.230 --> 01:24:00.630]
For Dennis.

[01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:02.750]
Hey, Dennis, let's put some Catholics on there.

[01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:03.650]
Come on, Eric, let's go.

[01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:04.110]
Catholics.

[01:24:04.830 --> 01:24:05.210]
Gays.

[01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:06.650]
Let's put Gays on there too.

[01:24:07.150 --> 01:24:07.790]
For Prince Charles.

[01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:09.350]
Oh, not here.

[01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:10.410]
Not the road family.

[01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:12.170]
They're not engaging in that kind of bugery.

[01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.710]
I'm sure that.

[01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:15.950]
No bugery there at the Guide de Mappalice.

[01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:19.410]
18 till noon at 560QM.

[01:24:19.410 --> 01:24:21.950]
Here's some big news of Halopodiac GMC.

[01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:26.490]
Has just been voted the number one Pontiac GMC dealer-indead county and customer satisfaction.

[01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:29.690]
And our good, close personal buddies, Tom Liman and Joe Prieto want to say,

[01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:31.150]
thank you for your support.

[01:24:31.570 --> 01:24:34.210]
Stop by Halop right now and check out the Pontiac vibe.

[01:24:34.590 --> 01:24:38.150]
Normally it retails for over 20 grand, but at Halopodiac right now, this second,

[01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:41.950]
you can buy it fully loaded for $16,500 bucks plus tax in tech.

[01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:45.270]
I noticed Bob Eisenberg wasn't in here because he's giving me this piece of confidence,

[01:24:45.390 --> 01:24:46.410]
got all kinds of mistakes in it.

[01:24:46.570 --> 01:24:48.470]
Plus, he hasn't given us a dime for a ban in Pet Rescue.

[01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:50.750]
So we haven't seen Bob Eisenberg with his bad due.

[01:24:52.330 --> 01:24:56.110]
How many of those you truck headquarters with over 300 to choose from, including the Yukon and the Yukon?

[01:24:56.490 --> 01:25:01.470]
And coming soon, the new Ann-Voy XUV and the new Ann-Voy XUV too, the most unique SUV in a market.

[01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:07.630]
Great Neal deals every day at Halopodiac GMC, or like it says here, at Halopodiac Pontiac GMC,

[01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:12.510]
134.01, South Dixie Highway, that's US 1 across and falls open every day, seven days a week.

[01:25:12.910 --> 01:25:16.070]
If you want more info, were you like born with like some kind of a mental defect?

[01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:19.390]
I mean, I was just noticing that there's something missing in your head.

[01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:24.630]
For more info called the Near Riders Neal Deal Hotline, toll free at 1-888-534-4211.

[01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:26.550]
He's trying to figure out what I'm talking about.

[01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:29.650]
I have never worked with anybody so strange in my life.

[01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:33.950]
1-888-534-4211, don't forget all offers subject to credit.

[01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:37.290]
Approval, see the folks at Halopodotales, Halopodiac GMC.

[01:25:37.290 --> 01:25:39.810]
Unlike Scott, they are professional grades.

[01:25:40.130 --> 01:25:43.030]
I have a look off this, this is 560.

[01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:44.830]
The radio's on your side.

[01:25:45.910 --> 01:25:46.670]
Q&A.

[01:25:49.090 --> 01:25:50.230]
What are those on your feet?

[01:25:50.450 --> 01:25:50.750]
Shoes.

[01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:51.150]
What else?

[01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:53.210]
S-O-C-K-S.

[01:25:53.330 --> 01:25:55.610]
You just said kiss my f***ing in Cantonese.

[01:25:55.730 --> 01:25:56.410]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[01:25:56.610 --> 01:25:57.170]
Don't be sorry.

[01:25:57.390 --> 01:25:58.390]
Hey, what's that around your waist?

[01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.750]
About?

[01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.390]
Spell it.

[01:25:59.470 --> 01:26:00.090]
B-E-L-T.

[01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:02.910]
You just told someone to f*** off in Zulu.

[01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:03.490]
Oh, my!

[01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:06.710]
And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn with the National Profanix

[01:26:06.710 --> 01:26:07.870]
language cassette program.

[01:26:08.170 --> 01:26:11.670]
National Profanix can have you cursing in Spanish, French, Italian, German,

[01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:14.210]
and a host of other languages in just a few weeks.

[01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:17.590]
So call 1-800-F*** you today.

[01:26:17.970 --> 01:26:20.590]
Because the most important thing you'll need to know about other cultures

[01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:22.190]
is how to tell somebody off.

[01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:24.510]
Say buddy, S-O-C-K-S.

[01:26:24.670 --> 01:26:24.830]
K?

[01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:27.230]
14-Dalloon at 560-W.

[01:26:27.330 --> 01:26:27.990]
Happy Monday.

[01:26:28.110 --> 01:26:29.970]
I realize this is not a good day to be coming back here.

[01:26:30.050 --> 01:26:31.810]
Everybody's done and I'm first of all it's a Monday.

[01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.510]
Secondly, it's been raining like cats and dogs.

[01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:35.390]
And thirdly, the sports people,

[01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:38.110]
where are we cursed down here Jim?

[01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.550]
Where?

[01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:40.170]
You know, quite like a bunch of little children.

[01:26:40.890 --> 01:26:42.810]
And then my keen ends get said, can, where?

[01:26:43.570 --> 01:26:45.770]
Hey, Geldy, you're nothing but a suckhole, okay?

[01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:48.070]
See, no matter what the organization does,

[01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:51.110]
if they would have like shot my keen end in the ass,

[01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:52.250]
well that's a good idea.

[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:52.630]
I am.

[01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:54.090]
I was at the higher than that.

[01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.910]
That's a good idea.

[01:26:56.210 --> 01:26:58.270]
Because he's a suckhole for the organization.

[01:26:58.990 --> 01:27:01.930]
That's why you see him up there on the goddamn scoreboard between periods.

[01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:03.430]
He wants Joe's McDonald's job.

[01:27:03.710 --> 01:27:05.170]
So he's just going to no matter what they do,

[01:27:05.170 --> 01:27:06.710]
he has no credibility there.

[01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:08.870]
He has no credibility and we're talking like he does.

[01:27:09.210 --> 01:27:10.250]
Like a baby.

[01:27:11.790 --> 01:27:13.130]
560-7.05-60.

[01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:14.990]
So I realize that you're done and dumps in here.

[01:27:15.130 --> 01:27:16.410]
I'm trying to cheer you up a little bit, right?

[01:27:16.570 --> 01:27:16.690]
No.

[01:27:16.810 --> 01:27:18.670]
Yeah, trying to make you feel a little bit better about life.

[01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:23.310]
Saw that thing on the news about 400 times over the weekend,

[01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:25.330]
about the school we headed on Thursday.

[01:27:25.450 --> 01:27:26.350]
Was it Thursday, I think?

[01:27:26.430 --> 01:27:26.830]
Not Friday.

[01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:28.110]
Goose Creek South Carolina.

[01:27:28.490 --> 01:27:28.490]

[01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:31.470]
Headed that on Thursday, saw it live there on CNNC.

[01:27:31.470 --> 01:27:33.850]
George tells Scott that instead of paying attention to me,

[01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:36.330]
on the show he's supposed to be sitting there watching TV watching the news.

[01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:38.690]
See, it's all George.

[01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.970]
George is the one he creates.

[01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:41.430]
It's like, Frank and Dr. Frank inside.

[01:27:41.730 --> 01:27:44.330]
He creates all his monsters like your predecessor in there.

[01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:45.090]
Like Beenerboy.

[01:27:45.630 --> 01:27:46.790]
He was probably getting them the drugs.

[01:27:48.370 --> 01:27:50.050]
He creates all his own little monsters.

[01:27:50.230 --> 01:27:51.290]
And then he just kind of like steps away.

[01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:52.490]
Oh, well, this one's incompetent.

[01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:53.770]
I made a bad mistake.

[01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:54.630]
You know that kind of stuff.

[01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:56.590]
Why do I need you to be watching the news?

[01:27:56.890 --> 01:27:59.210]
I'm watching the skiing, the little kid skiing on there.

[01:27:59.210 --> 01:28:01.790]
And Whistler Canada, he's smoking some good crap there.

[01:28:02.210 --> 01:28:04.250]
The late-year-old kid, he's smoking a big fat one.

[01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:05.690]
What's Whistler BC, you know?

[01:28:07.450 --> 01:28:09.250]
So I'll find out what's going on in the world.

[01:28:09.370 --> 01:28:09.730]
What's that?

[01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.610]
My check?

[01:28:12.950 --> 01:28:14.050]
I already got my check.

[01:28:14.150 --> 01:28:14.870]
Is that another check?

[01:28:16.230 --> 01:28:16.630]
Good.

[01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:18.110]
Just keep bringing them in, Duff.

[01:28:18.230 --> 01:28:19.430]
Just keep bringing them in the checks.

[01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:21.050]
What is that?

[01:28:22.810 --> 01:28:23.790]
Don't look at it.

[01:28:23.850 --> 01:28:24.670]
Just bring it in.

[01:28:24.930 --> 01:28:25.430]
Bring it in.

[01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:26.630]
He's looking at it.

[01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:28.050]
Maybe they made a mistake.

[01:28:28.050 --> 01:28:29.110]
Maybe they paid me twice.

[01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:30.070]
Don't be looking at it.

[01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.730]
I'll split it with you.

[01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:30.990]
Okay?

[01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:32.950]
I'll split 50-50.

[01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:33.850]
Thank you.

[01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:35.190]
Well, what is that?

[01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:35.970]
What is this?

[01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:38.550]
What is this for?

[01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:39.450]
One of them bonus?

[01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:41.090]
I don't know.

[01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:42.630]
I'll check it out and let you know later.

[01:28:44.050 --> 01:28:47.250]
5-670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:48.130]
Wireless line.

[01:28:48.190 --> 01:28:48.970]
Like I said, I'm leaving.

[01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.590]
I'm getting out of here now.

[01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.930]
I can't believe that they did that.

[01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:56.270]
This is a company.

[01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:57.670]
I'm not saying nothing.

[01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.570]
And you're not either.

[01:28:58.650 --> 01:28:59.450]
If you know what's good for you.

[01:29:00.810 --> 01:29:03.890]
It's 11 before noon at 560WQ and he's got my check.

[01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.810]
I would have sworn.

[01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:06.470]
Maybe that was another check for another day.

[01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:07.010]
I don't know.

[01:29:08.930 --> 01:29:10.830]
Body parts found in leaking FedEx package.

[01:29:12.010 --> 01:29:14.730]
FedEx workers discovered a shipment of two human legs in an arm

[01:29:14.730 --> 01:29:17.270]
where one of the boxes was found leaking at a company depot police.

[01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:18.210]
I can't do that.

[01:29:18.270 --> 01:29:19.190]
I got to give this back to you.

[01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:20.150]
They already paid me.

[01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:21.090]
I can't take this.

[01:29:21.970 --> 01:29:22.650]
It's a mistake.

[01:29:24.450 --> 01:29:25.610]
Well, you can come in right now.

[01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:26.230]
I have to wait.

[01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:28.110]
I mean, I might change my mind before you come back.

[01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:30.190]
No, it's a thank you, but it's a mistake.

[01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:31.290]
I already got that check.

[01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:32.570]
It's already in the bank.

[01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:34.150]
No, no, shit.

[01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:37.430]
Well, let me take a look at the data on it just to decide one more time.

[01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:38.370]
Because I like the amount.

[01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:40.150]
No, I mean, well.

[01:29:40.490 --> 01:29:42.350]
That's the fifth check for the 20th.

[01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:43.590]
For the 20th?

[01:29:45.550 --> 01:29:46.850]
What do you mean for the 20th?

[01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:49.210]
That's not for the 25th.

[01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:49.930]
No, that can't be right.

[01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:51.010]
Because that's got a talent check.

[01:29:51.270 --> 01:29:52.950]
Excuse us, folks, why we argue about my money?

[01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:55.210]
No, this is for the 10th.

[01:29:55.230 --> 01:29:55.910]
This is a mistake.

[01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:57.170]
Although, you know what?

[01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.750]
Maybe you're right.

[01:29:57.890 --> 01:30:00.250]
Maybe this is the first part and the talent check's going to come separate.

[01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:01.590]
Maybe it's a...

[01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:02.610]
I'm not going to open your mic.

[01:30:02.850 --> 01:30:03.430]
Oh, come on, there.

[01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:04.470]
Get out of here.

[01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:05.850]
That microphone doesn't work either.

[01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:06.390]
Are you crazy?

[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:10.070]
Maybe it's just a good faith thing.

[01:30:10.450 --> 01:30:11.910]
How do you like the way that sounds, Scott?

[01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:12.930]
Sounds like a tin can.

[01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:13.890]
Hey, everybody.

[01:30:14.110 --> 01:30:14.510]
It's cool.

[01:30:14.730 --> 01:30:16.690]
Yeah, but are we screwed up or what, huh?

[01:30:17.710 --> 01:30:19.350]
Yeah, I told you not to turn that on.

[01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.870]
Well, I don't know what to do with it.

[01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:21.270]
I'll tell you how.

[01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.690]
I'll hold it.

[01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:23.070]
I promise you, I will not deposit it.

[01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.910]
You find out what it is.

[01:30:24.050 --> 01:30:24.710]
Find out what it's for.

[01:30:25.130 --> 01:30:28.470]
I can't deposit it here anyway unless I leave real quick, which is not a bad idea.

[01:30:29.570 --> 01:30:36.190]
5, 6, 7, so anyway, I saw that thing on all the news that were submitting times where they had the kids down on the floor with a drug bust at the end.

[01:30:36.450 --> 01:30:38.030]
And then we had one call about that.

[01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.170]
Oh.

[01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:39.670]
I'm sure you people saw it.

[01:30:39.730 --> 01:30:42.890]
And this is the way they got you conditioned in this fascist country that you're living in.

[01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:44.230]
And you just accept that.

[01:30:44.610 --> 01:30:45.550]
Everybody hit the floor.

[01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:48.050]
It's a drug bust with a gun's drawn.

[01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:53.270]
15 crazy cops in some Redneck Yahoo school in South Carolina in Gooseneck, no less.

[01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:55.650]
Redneck's in Gooseneck.

[01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.030]
I mean, the public is sitting back there.

[01:30:58.210 --> 01:30:59.750]
Oh, I want to talk about the dolphin.

[01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.990]
What are we going to do?

[01:31:01.170 --> 01:31:04.370]
That Frank Reese blows and lets fire Dave Wandsett.

[01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.210]
And why is Dave Wandsett fired Dave Wandsett?

[01:31:06.690 --> 01:31:07.850]
I say, that's a great idea.

[01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:08.310]
Okay.

[01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:09.190]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:31:10.410 --> 01:31:11.090]
He's a loser.

[01:31:11.290 --> 01:31:12.130]
He was a loser with a bear.

[01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:12.650]
He's a loser.

[01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:13.250]
Here's an idiot.

[01:31:14.050 --> 01:31:14.670]
Here's plantation.

[01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.090]
Hello.

[01:31:15.610 --> 01:31:16.510]
Hey, how you doing?

[01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:17.250]
Pretty good?

[01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:21.990]
Hey, we know George is just trying to prove his manhood by having a fable in the studio.

[01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:22.670]
He's a fag.

[01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.430]
Everyone knows that.

[01:31:23.430 --> 01:31:23.890]
Okay, good.

[01:31:25.370 --> 01:31:28.150]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Line.

[01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:28.950]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:29.190]
Hello.

[01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.550]
Yes sir.

[01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:32.190]
I'm a long time hurricane span.

[01:31:32.370 --> 01:31:32.970]
I'm so sorry.

[01:31:33.370 --> 01:31:34.810]
No, it's been fun.

[01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:35.930]
But why?

[01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.090]
I mean, well.

[01:31:37.310 --> 01:31:39.850]
Are you one of those people that paints up your face orange and not green?

[01:31:40.130 --> 01:31:40.970]
I don't do that.

[01:31:41.130 --> 01:31:41.710]
Good, thank God.

[01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:42.570]
I don't enjoy watching them.

[01:31:42.570 --> 01:31:46.350]
But anyways, it seems to me like Tudzinski seems to have like...

[01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:47.110]
No, no wait, no wait, no.

[01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:48.450]
Are you talking sports to me?

[01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:49.130]
Yes sir.

[01:31:49.190 --> 01:31:49.690]
What are you talking about?

[01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:49.870]
What are you talking about?

[01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:50.170]
You're not out of here.

[01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:51.370]
Are you crazy person or what?

[01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:54.130]
He's talking about the hurricane, what they need the offensive line.

[01:31:54.250 --> 01:31:55.850]
And Dona Shalili has got a big one.

[01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:57.290]
I mean, I don't want to hear about that crap.

[01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.810]
Are you nuts?

[01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:00.750]
These people are insane.

[01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.310]
You're right.

[01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:02.250]
You were right before.

[01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:03.670]
It's the first time you've been right this year.

[01:32:05.370 --> 01:32:07.030]
5670560, can you believe this paycheck thing?

[01:32:07.130 --> 01:32:08.630]
I don't know why I should have just kept my mouth shut.

[01:32:09.130 --> 01:32:10.150]
Am I stupid or what?

[01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:10.410]
Yes.

[01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:12.410]
I mean, maybe it's like a duplication.

[01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:14.970]
I should have said, hey, Clarice, where's my check?

[01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:15.770]
And Dona Shalili, come here.

[01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:16.370]
It is, Neil.

[01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:18.850]
But I can't do that because then they'll catch it.

[01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:22.470]
And then like, you know, fry my ass.

[01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:26.830]
5670560, come on, where's the action here?

[01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:27.690]
Where's the excitement?

[01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:28.570]
I'm back in town.

[01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:29.570]
Everybody's bitching.

[01:32:29.630 --> 01:32:30.590]
He's out of town too much.

[01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:32.310]
We got all this stuff to talk about here.

[01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:35.410]
And this guy wants to talk about the guy, the offensive line of the freaking Hurikunz.

[01:32:36.130 --> 01:32:36.330]
Okay?

[01:32:36.610 --> 01:32:37.930]
Are you a crazy person or what?

[01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.450]
That's right.

[01:32:38.450 --> 01:32:39.430]
I forgot he's a Hurikun fan.

[01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:41.370]
He answered the question already.

[01:32:43.530 --> 01:32:43.890]
What?

[01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:45.510]
Why do you have the...

[01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.870]
I can't...

[01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:48.170]
I'm going to put it like a curtain, so I'm going to have to see you know.

[01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:51.310]
Not forget the fact that you're that ugly because, you know, I mean...

[01:32:51.310 --> 01:32:56.630]
But just the idea that you have these expressions that ordinary sane rational people

[01:32:56.630 --> 01:32:57.550]
don't have...

[01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:58.670]
It looks like that on their face.

[01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:59.030]
Ever.

[01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:00.030]
Ever.

[01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:02.610]
Man, a few people could see it.

[01:33:03.630 --> 01:33:04.230]
Here's Miami.

[01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.530]
Hello.

[01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:06.170]
Hey, Neil.

[01:33:06.270 --> 01:33:06.570]
How you doing?

[01:33:06.570 --> 01:33:07.130]
Okay, sir?

[01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:10.770]
Hey, you know, you're not probably not going to like this call, but...

[01:33:10.770 --> 01:33:11.170]
What is that?

[01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.970]
What is that?

[01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:13.130]
I'm not going to like this call.

[01:33:13.210 --> 01:33:14.390]
Why do you not come like what I have to say?

[01:33:14.570 --> 01:33:14.730]
But...

[01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:15.270]
How do you know that?

[01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:16.210]
Well...

[01:33:16.210 --> 01:33:18.390]
Why are you pre-judging what I'm going to think?

[01:33:18.570 --> 01:33:19.030]
Here's what I have to say.

[01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.870]
Maybe I'm going to love it.

[01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:21.290]
Maybe it's going to be great, but I doubt it.

[01:33:21.650 --> 01:33:22.610]
Here's what I got to say.

[01:33:22.670 --> 01:33:23.490]
I've been listening to you.

[01:33:23.570 --> 01:33:23.970]
I'm 33.

[01:33:24.370 --> 01:33:26.710]
I've been listening to you for as long as I can remember.

[01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:26.990]
Right.

[01:33:27.230 --> 01:33:28.370]
When you raised your mind.

[01:33:28.690 --> 01:33:28.870]
Right.

[01:33:29.790 --> 01:33:30.110]
And...

[01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.790]
I'm a bad guy.

[01:33:31.130 --> 01:33:33.750]
Lately, man, anytime I turn on the radio, you're just...

[01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:35.650]
It's winding and bitching and boning.

[01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:36.690]
Well, then don't listen anymore.

[01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:38.650]
I know you were going to say that too, but...

[01:33:38.650 --> 01:33:39.010]
Well, yeah.

[01:33:39.370 --> 01:33:40.710]
That's a really an option, but...

[01:33:40.710 --> 01:33:42.230]
That's an option, but...

[01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:44.090]
Everything is so negative with you now.

[01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:44.370]
It's like what?

[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:44.870]
Well, like what?

[01:33:45.190 --> 01:33:47.010]
The country saw...

[01:33:47.010 --> 01:33:49.170]
You know, you're talking about your paycheck.

[01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:50.570]
The Canada is so great.

[01:33:50.970 --> 01:33:51.250]
And, you know...

[01:33:51.250 --> 01:33:53.070]
I never mentioned Canada once here today.

[01:33:53.130 --> 01:33:54.310]
And there was some one word about Canada.

[01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:55.050]
But...

[01:33:55.050 --> 01:33:56.110]
You talked about just...

[01:33:56.110 --> 01:33:56.750]
I mean, things...

[01:33:57.570 --> 01:33:57.930]
I...

[01:33:57.930 --> 01:34:00.270]
So I guess I lost those ball games over the weekend.

[01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:02.530]
I'm the one that's all sour and bent out of shape.

[01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:03.890]
I don't care about the ball games.

[01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:06.330]
I'm the one that screwed up all the equipment in here in this place.

[01:34:06.330 --> 01:34:07.330]
I made it like a...

[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:08.350]
Not house in this studio.

[01:34:08.410 --> 01:34:09.390]
No, I'm worried about you.

[01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:11.450]
I think you need to get a new outlook on life.

[01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:13.010]
No, no, I'm not getting any new outlook.

[01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:13.390]
I don't...

[01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:16.050]
I don't take advice from other people how I should look upon life, okay?

[01:34:16.210 --> 01:34:16.250]
Okay.

[01:34:16.370 --> 01:34:17.910]
If you don't like the show, have a great life.

[01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.270]
Goodbye.

[01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.370]
Very...

[01:34:19.370 --> 01:34:19.810]
Very simple.

[01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.610]
I don't take advice on what I should say.

[01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:25.130]
We already have enough people in this country who are being told to act like a parent.

[01:34:25.390 --> 01:34:26.450]
And just repeat after us.

[01:34:26.510 --> 01:34:27.110]
You feel like it.

[01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:27.670]
You feel like it.

[01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:28.570]
I'm not going to do that.

[01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:29.490]
And going to happen.

[01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:32.930]
Oh, you're so sour and you're so negative about bye-bye.

[01:34:33.190 --> 01:34:33.870]
Very simple.

[01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.230]
Easy.

[01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:36.430]
Well, that's an option but button.

[01:34:36.530 --> 01:34:37.510]
You know he's not going to do it.

[01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:38.130]
Is he going anywhere?

[01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.410]
No.

[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:39.050]
Of course not.

[01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:40.210]
Not going nowhere.

[01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:41.970]
All you want to do...

[01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:43.330]
And I'm the one who's supposed to be negative.

[01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:48.150]
If you have nothing to contribute to this program, you have nothing brilliant to share with your fellow citizens of South Florida.

[01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:49.010]
And so what do you do?

[01:34:49.090 --> 01:34:50.330]
You call and take a cheap shot at me.

[01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.850]
I don't care.

[01:34:51.010 --> 01:34:51.430]
I got like...

[01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:53.750]
Not only do I have my check in the bank, I get an Aster check.

[01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:54.450]
How do you like that?

[01:34:54.670 --> 01:34:55.110]
Oh, right.

[01:34:55.610 --> 01:34:56.730]
I got checks up the S.

[01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:57.690]
How do you like that, sweetheart?

[01:34:57.690 --> 01:35:00.870]
I got money that hasn't been printed yet.

[01:35:01.450 --> 01:35:02.570]
I got purple 20s.

[01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:03.530]
Forget about the pink ones.

[01:35:03.630 --> 01:35:04.290]
They're PASS A.

[01:35:04.670 --> 01:35:05.750]
Plus it's bad for my image.

[01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:08.190]
5, 6, 7, 05.

[01:35:08.330 --> 01:35:10.070]
I know I was going to have to come in here all week and look at you.

[01:35:10.190 --> 01:35:10.810]
Act like an asshole.

[01:35:10.810 --> 01:35:12.070]
I definitely would have stayed there.

[01:35:13.230 --> 01:35:13.870]
Here's plantation.

[01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:14.350]
Hello.

[01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.870]
Hi, Meele.

[01:35:17.110 --> 01:35:20.330]
That last guy I just called is totally all jealous.

[01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:21.530]
He's right on it.

[01:35:21.530 --> 01:35:21.930]
He's on it.

[01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:22.290]
I'm negative.

[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:24.550]
Hey, but it's nice to have you back.

[01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:26.550]
Hey, I just want to ask if you have anything to say.

[01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:27.890]
I'll go around Sunday.

[01:35:28.170 --> 01:35:28.850]
Yeah, I did see that.

[01:35:28.910 --> 01:35:29.310]
He was great.

[01:35:29.670 --> 01:35:30.730]
Yeah, that was tremendous.

[01:35:31.090 --> 01:35:33.550]
And too bad he would have done that in 2000, you know what?

[01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:38.630]
Do you think that's going to be a thing where it's going to launch in with two more than

[01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:39.350]
natural came in?

[01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:40.550]
No, are you kidding me?

[01:35:41.150 --> 01:35:42.390]
Al Gore forget about him.

[01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:44.310]
He's as boring as a cigar store Indian.

[01:35:44.850 --> 01:35:49.370]
I know, but if all the other guys could pass on that message, man, we just run over, push.

[01:35:49.550 --> 01:35:50.270]
Well, you're right.

[01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:53.030]
No, don't say that because the public out there, they're still buying it.

[01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.650]
It was bull crap.

[01:35:53.650 --> 01:35:55.170]
It's astonishing to me.

[01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.790]
But the good news is the numbers are dwindling like crazy.

[01:35:57.810 --> 01:36:04.490]
In fact, the independence, he's already behind among the independence and the latest poll against, he's like Philly Philly with somebody that didn't even have a name yet.

[01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:07.090]
In fact, here's the story from CNN.

[01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:13.130]
A poll release Saturday finds more registered voters want to see President Bush voted out than kept an office in the next election.

[01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:14.110]
How do you like that?

[01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:18.530]
50% said the registered voters said they don't want to see him elected.

[01:36:18.630 --> 01:36:19.950]
44% said they do.

[01:36:21.270 --> 01:36:24.090]
So that's why we need more of your bedtime stories that way.

[01:36:24.330 --> 01:36:25.550]
We did out there, man.

[01:36:25.570 --> 01:36:27.030]
Oh, yeah, I'm going to make the difference, man.

[01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:28.070]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:36:28.370 --> 01:36:29.670]
And how about them, how about them, Hurricanes?

[01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:31.410]
Have a great day, pal.

[01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:32.170]
Thanks, that's it.

[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:34.130]
How about them, Hurricanes?

[01:36:34.350 --> 01:36:35.050]
They're doing it.

[01:36:35.310 --> 01:36:36.370]
They lost two in a row.

[01:36:36.370 --> 01:36:38.890]
That's why everybody's saying, oh, you're so negative, Neil.

[01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:41.870]
This town is just a bastion of negativity.

[01:36:43.410 --> 01:36:46.590]
Sitting there in Toronto most of the time doing the show and what do I get coming into the input?

[01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:47.350]
You can smell it.

[01:36:47.370 --> 01:36:48.030]
You can feel it.

[01:36:48.910 --> 01:36:52.430]
You know, even if you try to be positive about something, you can't do it in this town.

[01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:54.270]
I'll give you a classic example.

[01:36:54.670 --> 01:36:57.650]
I went to public yesterday morning when you take those stupid shades off.

[01:36:57.650 --> 01:36:58.770]
Jesus, God, are you an idiot?

[01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.790]
Is this man an idiot?

[01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:00.430]
God.

[01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:02.810]
Now, like I said, put him back on.

[01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:07.550]
I go to public yesterday morning and I got a few things.

[01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:12.670]
So one of my good friends, the old guy there, the back boy, 90 year old back boy, he's a good guy.

[01:37:14.270 --> 01:37:16.610]
And I leave and I get my beautiful Corvette.

[01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:22.810]
As I'm leaving, here's a woman coming in in a big, she's driving like an SUV or something that, you know,

[01:37:23.250 --> 01:37:28.570]
so as I'm going to make the turn to go out to the exit, obviously, there wasn't enough room.

[01:37:28.830 --> 01:37:31.170]
So I just sat there and I waited and I let her make her turn.

[01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:37.230]
So instead of nodding or thank you, she just gives me a look, you know, like the typical soft food.

[01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:39.230]
Like, oh, gee, you want to paint in the ass, you know.

[01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:46.590]
As opposed to like in a civilized place, like Toronto, as I just use it as an example, I'm sure there are others I haven't seen.

[01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:49.210]
And I'm fond of it. What are people would have said, thanks, have a great day.

[01:37:50.290 --> 01:37:51.070]
Thanks very much.

[01:37:51.930 --> 01:37:55.310]
No, instead of that, she gives me like the old, ah, hey, hey, two.

[01:37:56.090 --> 01:37:58.950]
And you want to know why she's miserable because she's probably stuck here, you know.

[01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:01.330]
Probably had a couple of illegitimate kids.

[01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:09.530]

A great looking piece of ass over there in 6127.

I like it. I like it.

[01:39:40.570 --> 01:39:42.890]
I didn't know you liked to know it in a rapid smoke.

[01:39:43.150 --> 01:39:45.210]
That's a manly thing to do. And I like men.

[01:39:46.130 --> 01:39:48.630]
Wow, don't hit me with that wall.

[01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.810]
Oh, what?

[01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:50.690]
Wow.

[01:39:51.450 --> 01:39:53.890]
Now that you've picked this, I did this thing like I asked you.

It's a demo. I took this for a whole video. Just like you said, I stand beside you.

[01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:59.850]
Let me get a good look at you.

[01:40:00.670 --> 01:40:02.690]
Move on me, I'm on run. I got a fence over the seat.

[01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:03.650]
It's a demo.

[01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.130]
Where?

[01:40:04.350 --> 01:40:07.690]
You can't defend over the side wall to see it. That's it.

[01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:09.370]
Hey, where's the door?

[01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:13.910]
Oh, you know, you can push me over, boy. Ah, why you?

[01:40:14.490 --> 01:40:16.230]
You can't move.

[01:40:17.170 --> 01:40:20.650]
What is wrong? No way. We're hitting for a wonderful.

[01:40:20.650 --> 01:40:24.470]
Think I'm pulling for that old trick. Why I'll have you to work.

[01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:25.690]

[01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:26.070]
Oh!

[01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:35.810]
Wait, at least we're on shot.

[01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:40.850]
Yeah, the wood had not a fighting message. Got me a poof.

[01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:43.670]
Yeah, let's see who dropped in here, Jab.

[01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:47.290]
Hey, fellas, Dylan. I'm Georgie.

[01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.190]
That's my uncle, sister, Jab.

[01:40:49.190 --> 01:40:51.590]
Howdy. And this here's my brother and my pal Marv.

[01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:55.690]
Mama named us after all the bushes in honor of the greatest

[01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:58.170]
pressure in this country ever had.

[01:40:58.470 --> 01:41:00.090]
George Washington, bush.

[01:41:00.450 --> 01:41:01.710]
Well, it's real nice meeting you and I.

[01:41:02.150 --> 01:41:03.370]
You ain't going anywhere, sister.

[01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:05.710]
Oh, see? Here, my good Christian friend.

[01:41:06.110 --> 01:41:07.950]
He's got your jersey. Get on your knees.

[01:41:08.370 --> 01:41:09.350]
You two, girlfriend.

[01:41:09.810 --> 01:41:10.910]
But wait, I'm a boy.

[01:41:11.130 --> 01:41:14.270]
You sure sound funny, but I like you, really.

[01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.470]
Don't.

[01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:16.350]
No!

[01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.730]
No!

[01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.950]
No!

[01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:22.110]
That fight now.

[01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:23.370]
Because you get used to it.

[01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:24.090]
You want to be the girl?

[01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:25.410]
Yes, you want to be the girl?

[01:41:25.530 --> 01:41:27.490]
No! No, no, no, no, no.

[01:41:27.530 --> 01:41:28.530]
You want to have that, Mom?

[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.710]
Yeah, you'll be feeling like a woman in no time.

[01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:31.490]
You want to be the girl?

[01:41:31.770 --> 01:41:32.190]
No, no.

[01:41:32.190 --> 01:41:34.250]
I got a bad kiss. You get the front.

[01:41:34.450 --> 01:41:36.730]
I suppose you want me to steal your mouth, eh?

[01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:39.450]
Don't see how you got her. You have not.

[01:41:39.670 --> 01:41:40.790]
You're gonna have to push that arm.

[01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:46.030]
Oh, you're gonna have to push that arm.

[01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.450]
Oh, you're gonna have to push that arm.

[01:41:46.450 --> 01:41:46.870]
Oh, you're gonna have to push that arm.

[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:47.710]
Oh, you're gonna have to push that arm.

[01:41:48.170 --> 01:41:48.770]
Back them.

[01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:50.610]
Come on, 4-5-60-WDQ.

[01:41:50.730 --> 01:41:52.410]
I'm happy Monday to you whether you like it or not.

[01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:55.190]
I'm the one that's sour. That's the one that gets me, man.

[01:41:55.290 --> 01:41:56.330]
That's what really kills me.

[01:41:56.630 --> 01:41:59.030]
If you ever had eight votes on the pool, which, and, uh,

[01:41:59.170 --> 01:42:01.010]
and let me give you another piece of, uh, exam,

[01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:02.310]
uh, exam, piece of example.

[01:42:04.150 --> 01:42:05.190]
Why shouldn't be here?

[01:42:06.150 --> 01:42:07.590]
Door just opens, there's Muffigan.

[01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:09.170]
And trying to kill me with kindness.

[01:42:09.170 --> 01:42:11.390]
Oh, there's some sandwiches done, huh? Can I get you a couple?

[01:42:12.730 --> 01:42:13.930]
Now, what did I say about food?

[01:42:14.190 --> 01:42:17.930]
How many times, how many times have I said since I sat down here at 8.30 this morning?

[01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:18.890]
About 30, man.

[01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:20.710]
I'm not eating food while I'm in here.

[01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:22.650]
I then you're killed myself the last two times.

[01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:25.070]
I'm not gonna get forced fed food. I don't need to eat.

[01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:27.570]
This isn't the goddamn cafeteria. It's not a kitchen.

[01:42:28.750 --> 01:42:31.490]
It's just, well, it's not a radio station either, but it's supposed to be.

[01:42:31.770 --> 01:42:33.610]
It's not a broadcast studio. It's far from that.

[01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:35.910]
But it's supposed to be. We're doing a freaking radio show.

[01:42:36.150 --> 01:42:37.870]
We're not doing a goddamn gay gourmet.

[01:42:38.650 --> 01:42:40.230]
We're not doing an iron chef.

[01:42:41.130 --> 01:42:44.030]
It's the freaking the erogier show. It's a radio station.

[01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:45.930]
So I know your intentions were good.

[01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:49.370]
And by the way, Scott is calling you the paper pussy, which I think is disgusting.

[01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:52.090]
At least paper tiger would be good.

[01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:55.610]
5.670560, 05.560.

[01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:56.530]
I like that shade of red.

[01:42:57.030 --> 01:42:58.770]
05.560 on the AT&T.

[01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:01.850]
It won't make any difference. It takes a lot to get candy around here. Believe me.

[01:43:02.490 --> 01:43:03.930]
You got to turn Duffer Greg down.

[01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:07.830]
Or both. That's what Prince Charles said. He turned him both down.

[01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:10.810]
Here's a call from Bokeh. Hello.

[01:43:11.490 --> 01:43:12.290]
Welcome home.

[01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.910]
Yeah.

[01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:14.910]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:17.170]
When is your personal appearance?

[01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:20.930]
Here's a call from Ford Pierce. Hello.

[01:43:22.670 --> 01:43:23.390]
Welcome, God.

[01:43:23.650 --> 01:43:24.850]
They're good. Aren't they? They're great.

[01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:26.690]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:26.710 --> 01:43:26.950]
Sorry.

[01:43:27.130 --> 01:43:27.870]
Sorry, you're back.

[01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:28.990]
Yeah, me too.

[01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:30.210]
Oh my God.

[01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:31.810]
Quick, suck job. Roll quick.

[01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:35.330]
I'm one of your faithful truck driving listeners for about six years now.

[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:35.730]
Oh, right.

[01:43:36.430 --> 01:43:38.850]
It's a small army of us out here, too. Believe you, mate.

[01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:41.830]
And I just want to say to that guy that called me,

[01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:43.990]
that he's got the blinders on, that you're a negative.

[01:43:44.370 --> 01:43:47.670]
You're part of the problem down here, because you can't even see it.

[01:43:47.790 --> 01:43:48.830]
You can't be bitching about it.

[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:51.870]
And I just have to turn you on every day.

[01:43:51.930 --> 01:43:54.390]
I love the way when I said to him, you can turn it off.

[01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:56.170]
Well, that's an option, but that's an option.

[01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:59.470]
But in other words, he's going to tell me how I should view life

[01:43:59.470 --> 01:44:01.770]
and what I should do to make him happy.

[01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:04.630]
I mean, how do I do that when I got all these thousands of people listening?

[01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:05.510]
Am I supposed to let eat?

[01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:07.290]
How do I appeal to each one of them?

[01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:08.710]
How they decide I'm supposed to do the show?

[01:44:09.370 --> 01:44:11.350]
You just do what you do, and then if they can't,

[01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.350]

[01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:14.310]
That's what I do. I do do a lot, and believe me, my mother's very jealous.

[01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:15.910]
Well, it's quality do do.

[01:44:16.050 --> 01:44:18.010]
I mean, you're the best, man. You ought to smell it.

[01:44:18.450 --> 01:44:20.970]
Real quick. Do you already, I'm sure you already covered the mic,

[01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:22.150]
and get fired, bit.

[01:44:22.830 --> 01:44:24.970]
Well, I covered it as much as I can on it,

[01:44:25.090 --> 01:44:27.790]
because nobody cares about hockey here, so why dwell on it?

[01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:28.910]
Well, that's the same.

[01:44:28.910 --> 01:44:29.670]
But a death wish.

[01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:33.130]
Now, is that going to be the same deal as when they fired my clean?

[01:44:33.490 --> 01:44:37.930]
Then, Doug McClain, that was the straw that broke the camels back the first time around,

[01:44:38.030 --> 01:44:41.750]
when they brought in PM, and they keep in mind that that first night, when Brian Murray coached,

[01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:44.530]
they beat Boston 10-5, and from then on, they went straight down hill,

[01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:46.290]
and I was the end of the organization as we knew it.

[01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:49.410]
And now, this is, I mean, this Alan Cohen guy that bought the team,

[01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:51.270]
he doesn't know what the hell he's doing. This guy's an idiot.

[01:44:51.650 --> 01:44:52.430]
He's a total idiot.

[01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:56.830]
This is the interim coach. Where did this position in this before he became coach now?

[01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:59.730]
He was a general manager. Now, he's a general manager and coach.

[01:44:59.730 --> 01:45:02.230]
It doesn't work out too well as we discovered in Toronto. It sucks.

[01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:04.870]
Oh, God, here goes the BM thing all over again.

[01:45:04.890 --> 01:45:05.050]
Right.

[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:08.330]
Okay, well, let me go get a different team. Go hockey.

[01:45:08.470 --> 01:45:09.330]
Okay, good luck to pal.

[01:45:09.710 --> 01:45:10.150]
Thanks, Neil.

[01:45:11.070 --> 01:45:12.950]
Yeah, this organization has been screwed over.

[01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:14.930]
And Alan Cohen and that whole Bernie Kosa are thing,

[01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:16.770]
which you saw how fast he disappeared, old Bernie,

[01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:18.890]
and the whole dog and pony show.

[01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:22.270]
And I'll say it again, I saw a little bit of that game against Minnesota not too many nights ago.

[01:45:22.710 --> 01:45:25.190]
And there was, I guess LA, rather, there was nobody there.

[01:45:25.930 --> 01:45:27.190]
You were there? Yeah.

[01:45:27.370 --> 01:45:30.190]
And even you admitted that there were 7,000 there were counting the ushers

[01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:32.110]
and the people that got lost in the parking lot.

[01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:33.650]
Very much. Nobody there.

[01:45:35.130 --> 01:45:37.950]
They've destroyed. It used to be a fun thing, especially in the old building.

[01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:41.490]
It was great. We built that great head that one great year went to the stand-up finals.

[01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:43.870]
And since then, it's just like what happens with everything else.

[01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:45.070]
They destroyed and tear it down.

[01:45:47.530 --> 01:45:49.950]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Nobody cares.

[01:45:49.950 --> 01:45:51.770]
It's pound 5, 60 on the 18th.

[01:45:51.770 --> 01:45:54.210]
Just like they don't care about that story from Gooth Creek South Carolina.

[01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:56.710]
People ought to be screaming bloody murder about that.

[01:45:57.010 --> 01:45:58.570]
You ought to be scared, schmittless man.

[01:45:58.890 --> 01:45:59.870]
This is going on in America.

[01:46:00.250 --> 01:46:02.110]
They're coming in with your guns drawn and your kids,

[01:46:02.210 --> 01:46:03.830]
or your auntie if it was your kids in their school.

[01:46:04.170 --> 01:46:05.810]
And they did it. You people would be foaming at them out.

[01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:08.750]
You'd be frothing right now. You'd be rabid.

[01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:10.110]
You'd be doing rabbis.

[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:13.710]
Here's a call from Jupiter. Hello?

[01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:15.850]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:46:16.130 --> 01:46:17.170]
Another one of your trucking buddies?

[01:46:17.570 --> 01:46:17.850]
All right.

[01:46:17.850 --> 01:46:20.290]
And I just want to call the state, but later happy birthday.

[01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:22.330]
Thank you. Happy birthday to me.

[01:46:22.970 --> 01:46:23.450]
When's that?

[01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:24.410]
Today, sir.

[01:46:24.670 --> 01:46:27.190]
Oh, today is your birthday. Well, let's give this guy a little something.

[01:46:29.130 --> 01:46:29.790]
Thank you, sir.

[01:46:30.150 --> 01:46:30.750]
Have a happy, pal.

[01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.590]
You too.

[01:46:31.750 --> 01:46:32.890]
And if your smarts stay off the road.

[01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:34.170]
Okay. Good luck.

[01:46:34.730 --> 01:46:36.250]
Well, at least for bastards, I'll say it again.

[01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:37.490]
You people I have to drive, we're living.

[01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:39.170]
Like you limo drivers out there.

[01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:42.190]
Oh, man.

[01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:44.550]
You know, anybody can make a mistake.

[01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:46.010]
Anybody can be a few minutes late.

[01:46:46.170 --> 01:46:47.270]
I'm not a perfectionist.

[01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:49.630]
I don't expect I understand people have problems on the road.

[01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:51.050]
The airport's all messed around.

[01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:55.670]
But, but don't be giving me a song and an answer about how you got all the way up there to bokeh in 35 minutes.

[01:46:55.950 --> 01:47:00.230]
While I was standing there, a curb peeing in my pants, waiting to see if I was going to have to walk home to plantation.

[01:47:00.450 --> 01:47:02.530]
Probably could use the exercise, but not a good idea.

[01:47:04.570 --> 01:47:05.710]
God almighty, Ken.

[01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:07.730]
I, in fact, pick up rumor while you're at it.

[01:47:08.070 --> 01:47:09.430]
Even he wouldn't ride with you no more.

[01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:12.090]
Although for free, he might.

[01:47:12.630 --> 01:47:12.990]
No tip.

[01:47:15.290 --> 01:47:18.890]
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:21.810]
Here's a call from Pompano. Hello.

[01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.610]
Hello.

[01:47:22.970 --> 01:47:23.630]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:24.150 --> 01:47:25.130]
I came to God.

[01:47:25.350 --> 01:47:25.990]
You're a little guy.

[01:47:26.410 --> 01:47:26.670]
The one?

[01:47:26.990 --> 01:47:27.310]
The computer.

[01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:27.770]
I shall.

[01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.710]
Okay.

[01:47:29.670 --> 01:47:30.790]
You agree with the guy?

[01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:31.830]
You go back to Canada.

[01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.870]
Okay. Yeah.

[01:47:32.930 --> 01:47:33.910]
I probably shouldn't be left.

[01:47:34.270 --> 01:47:35.890]
I'll see now that you can't this crowd.

[01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:36.710]
You can never please him.

[01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:40.190]
Because George is always saying, oh, they like when you heard better because you're more aggravated here.

[01:47:40.190 --> 01:47:41.810]
So now I'm here. I'm more aggravated now.

[01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:43.410]
Go back to Canada. You're so negative.

[01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:44.290]
See, see what I'm saying?

[01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.810]
He can't wait.

[01:47:44.850 --> 01:47:46.870]
It's a catch 22 with a South Florida audience.

[01:47:46.930 --> 01:47:48.950]
They're all been and pissed off and fired up.

[01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.930]
Like Mark.

[01:47:50.170 --> 01:47:50.890]
Like Mark.

[01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:53.030]
He was number 22 and we get that straight down.

[01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.470]
We did.

[01:47:53.630 --> 01:47:55.110]
And Troy Stradford was 23.

[01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.650]
Right.

[01:47:55.890 --> 01:47:57.110]
And still has the big ball spot.

[01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.970]
You're okay now.

[01:47:57.990 --> 01:48:01.990]
Troy gave us a check for band of pepper rescue this morning, along with fat boy and John Juris.

[01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:02.690]
And who else?

[01:48:04.850 --> 01:48:06.170]
Somebody else did, I think.

[01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:07.270]
Then we get three, four.

[01:48:08.170 --> 01:48:13.630]
See, wait until I came back into town so they could impress me and stick it right in my hand and the checks to here.

[01:48:13.630 --> 01:48:14.390]
You go, Neil.

[01:48:15.090 --> 01:48:16.330]
Didn't Clarence give us one.

[01:48:16.530 --> 01:48:19.870]
Clarence, he, well, he, yeah, he's thinking about it.

[01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:23.550]
5, 6, 7, oh boy, this is brutal today, man.

[01:48:23.650 --> 01:48:24.670]
This is absolutely brutal.

[01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:26.070]
I may have to go to my bedtime stories.

[01:48:26.110 --> 01:48:26.590]
I got a pile.

[01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:27.390]
I don't want to.

[01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:28.970]
I want to converse.

[01:48:29.110 --> 01:48:33.150]
I want to have verbal intercourse with my good post-personal friends out there in media land after almost 30 years.

[01:48:33.490 --> 01:48:34.190]
And this is what we get.

[01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:35.090]
Critiques.

[01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:37.570]
Oh, you're so negative, you're such a son of a bitch.

[01:48:37.710 --> 01:48:38.630]
Yeah, and what's your point?

[01:48:39.010 --> 01:48:39.970]
But I can't turn it off.

[01:48:40.250 --> 01:48:41.070]
And you won't turn it off.

[01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:41.850]
That's the best part.

[01:48:42.610 --> 01:48:45.110]
Under no circumstances, when you turn it off, and we all know that.

[01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:47.330]
You're glued to it right now.

[01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:52.250]
In fact, you're squeezing yourself just with excitement from the fact that I'm even dignifying you by talking about that call that guy before.

[01:48:54.250 --> 01:48:54.990]
What is it?

[01:48:55.130 --> 01:48:57.290]
12, 11, at 5, 60, QM ad dog at 2, boy.

[01:48:57.370 --> 01:48:58.250]
He's going to be sour today.

[01:48:58.430 --> 01:49:01.990]
Wow, he is going to be just, you talk about bad smelly diarrhea.

[01:49:02.770 --> 01:49:06.090]
He is going to be in a real nasty mood, even worse than my aunt.

[01:49:07.090 --> 01:49:12.950]
Speaking of diarrhea, whether you're on the Atkins diet, South Beach diet, sugar brothers or busters or any other, they're low carb diets.

I'm trying to think of a word for you, Scott.

[01:51:28.770 --> 01:51:31.070]
And the word I just popped in my mind was incompetent.

[01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:35.410]
5667.0560.560 on the 18 and 10 horizon.

[01:51:35.410 --> 01:51:39.790]
I wish ethnic or racial group is most protective or paranoid about its own.

[01:51:39.930 --> 01:51:40.530]
Its own pickle.

Black's 152.

[01:51:42.890 --> 01:51:43.850]
How's it going, Miriam?

Them preachers, man.

[01:51:45.210 --> 01:51:46.030]
They're sticking up for you.

[01:51:46.790 --> 01:51:50.230]
If he was white, they wouldn't have two words to say about that bitch.

[01:51:50.250 --> 01:51:51.210]
I'll tell you that right now.

[01:51:51.610 --> 01:51:52.430]
If Miriam were white.

[01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:53.850]
Oh yeah, get that bitch out.

[01:51:55.090 --> 01:52:01.590]
But because she's black, therefore it's some kind of a racist conspiracy that the governor and everybody else wants to fire her ass.

[01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:02.830]
She's incompetent.

[01:52:02.890 --> 01:52:03.890]
Don't you people get it?

[01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.410]
No, no.

And don't, don't do it.

[01:52:13.610 --> 01:52:15.610]
You're having enough problems just to do anything extra.

[01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:16.970]
Just sit there and look stupid.

[01:52:18.230 --> 01:52:19.570]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[01:52:19.850 --> 01:52:24.370]
And now one call about that story in Goose Creek South Carolina about them that drug rate in the school.

[01:52:24.710 --> 01:52:25.210]
Not one.

[01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:30.450]
And I guarantee everybody in this audience has seen that they showed it 50 million times over the weekend.

[01:52:31.230 --> 01:52:32.950]
CBS, CNN, MSNBC.

[01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:35.010]
All of these things.

[01:52:35.770 --> 01:52:37.950]
Oh well, you know, we got to clean up them drugs.

[01:52:38.210 --> 01:52:38.810]
Drugs are bad.

[01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:40.770]
Here's Miami.

[01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:41.090]
Hello.

[01:52:42.710 --> 01:52:43.790]
Miami, when is this?

[01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:45.210]
Neil.

[01:52:45.390 --> 01:52:45.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:48.290]
Neil.

[01:52:48.670 --> 01:52:49.030]
Speaking.

[01:52:49.670 --> 01:52:50.590]
Sorry about that.

[01:52:50.730 --> 01:52:55.570]
So, Mike, I'm calling about, uh, uh, I want to talk about that school thing too.

[01:52:55.650 --> 01:52:58.530]
That was just disgusting, especially since they found nothing.

[01:52:59.810 --> 01:53:00.270]
Yeah.

[01:53:00.710 --> 01:53:04.890]
You know, and the other thing is Neil about that cartel up there in Washington.

[01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:08.310]
I mean, how are they controlling our media?

[01:53:08.630 --> 01:53:09.470]
I don't get it.

[01:53:09.690 --> 01:53:11.950]
You know, they didn't want to show.

[01:53:11.950 --> 01:53:14.810]
They're controlling it because Michael Powell is the chairman of the FCC.

[01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:26.790]
And because they're holding over their heads that if they want to go and play fast and lose buying up all the TV and radio stations and newspapers, they'd better go step right along, which is why CBS canceled the Reagan in the series, and which is why you get one version of the news.

[01:53:27.250 --> 01:53:27.490]
Yeah.

[01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:32.330]
You know, we complain about all those third world countries that pushed by the media.

[01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:32.570]
Right.

[01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:36.490]
And we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, I mean, not me.

[01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:38.510]
I'm not following because I knew everything from the beginning.

[01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:46.190]
Well, if you look, if you look on our website today, we got a great story by Scott Milford, speakers say media beer, some blame for the war in Iraq and they're absolutely correct.

[01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:48.630]
Oh, no, that is absolutely right.

[01:53:48.750 --> 01:53:53.410]
I told everybody, all my friends, all my right wing Republican friends, all these fascists.

[01:53:53.490 --> 01:53:57.010]
Neil Nazis, that this was this war was about oil and money.

[01:53:57.130 --> 01:53:57.470]
Right.

[01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:59.010]
You must have heard that from me.

[01:53:59.130 --> 01:53:59.210]
Right.

[01:54:00.610 --> 01:54:01.430]
And you know what?

[01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:03.690]
I'm, I've got a good idea for a bumper.

[01:54:03.690 --> 01:54:05.170]
It's like an afford to do it.

[01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:06.690]
But Clinton lied.

[01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.290]
Nobody.

[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:08.630]
I bush died.

[01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:09.670]
Soldiers died.

[01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:10.590]
There you go.

[01:54:10.590 --> 01:54:12.610]
In peace, the son of gun right now.

[01:54:12.670 --> 01:54:14.110]
In peace, the son of a bitch right now.

[01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:15.130]
You got it.

[01:54:15.170 --> 01:54:16.190]
Yeah, I had a great day.

[01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:21.110]
Miss leading an incomplete reporting by media news outlets help President Bush, the American to war with Iraq.

[01:54:21.530 --> 01:54:26.390]
Speaker said Friday during the opening session of a three day national conference on media reform at UW Madison.

[01:54:27.070 --> 01:54:30.670]
This war could never have taken place without the complicity of the news media.

[01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:38.930]
It's a John Stauber author and founder of the Center for Media and Democracy group that speaks to expose corporate and the media that sold this war doesn't want to examine how they did it.

[01:54:39.190 --> 01:54:40.310]
Which is why we put that link.

[01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:43.770]
I think we got a lot of hits on that thing too on that CBC thing on a conspiracy theories.

[01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:53.210]
Andy Goodman, host of Pacific Radio's Democracy Now program said war would stop if media outlets showed images of injured and dead Iraqi civilians, including children.

[01:54:53.210 --> 01:54:58.690]
As often as they showed images such as the toppling of a large statue of Saddam Hussein draped with that American flag.

[01:54:59.690 --> 01:55:03.430]
Goodman also fall to the media and US government for failing to tally Iraqi casualties.

[01:55:03.810 --> 01:55:09.610]
She quoted Secretary State Colin Powell as once having justified this by explaining that the military doesn't count enemy deaths.

[01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:13.010]
I don't consider a little dead Iraqi girl or boy on the ground.

[01:55:13.010 --> 01:55:18.250]
My enemy Goodman said in front of about 1600 people in the great hall of the Memorial Union on campus.

[01:55:18.250 --> 01:55:24.410]
The conference said, consumer advocate and former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader was a part of this as well.

[01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.930]
But there you go.

[01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:33.410]
The American media sucks. Magnum mistake about, oh that's right, I'm being negative again now.

[01:55:34.570 --> 01:55:38.310]
And of course, you know, that guy that called before wake up before it's too late, you moron.

[01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:41.190]
The CBC tape that I played not once but twice.

[01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:45.950]
Where did that come from? Canada A. They've Canada participating in the Iraq attack?

[01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:48.730]
No, they did not. They had the balls to say no way.

[01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:53.590]
When your friends are right, you help them out. When your friends are wrong, you say no thanks, you're wrong. You're making a mistake.

[01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:06.350]
Jesus, God, these America first do these mindless automatons want to be manipulated by the God they corrupt government for the benefit of beck telling a hell of Britain, all the other money grabbers out there.

[01:56:06.510 --> 01:56:08.910]
You got to be a crazy person man. You got to be a masochist.

[01:56:10.050 --> 01:56:16.470]
And that's why the Bush people are able to do it because the media keeps spoon feeding the public and because the masses out there most of them are morons.

[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:21.850]
Most of them are like from South Carolina, North Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana.

[01:56:22.650 --> 01:56:29.150]
Who the hell is that one ball per other quarter back on the hercones? What else is name that bad Berlin, Brock Berlin.

[01:56:29.150 --> 01:56:34.230]
Have you ever heard him talk? No. I mean, he should have been on that pool we did last week.

[01:56:34.230 --> 01:56:43.810]
We also left off Bush Davis. We left him off that pool. Dueling Rednecks, Bush Davis. Brock Berlin, he's from Louisiana. He talk live this and he can't play for Schmidt but other net.

[01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:53.410]
That's America for you man. It's mostly a bunch of Dueling Rednecks and the rest of us are all painted as a bunch of commy-pink ol' liberal fags which you're partly right.

[01:56:55.830 --> 01:57:04.130]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Okay, Neil, how you doing, man? Okay, sir. All right. Listen, I love your show either way if you're in a bad mood or not.

[01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:15.950]
I'm in a great mood. I'm in a fine mood. I know, but I saw the show. It's just pickled a pickled adet to be here. I got a question for you. Can you please play that song that's often sung the losers?

[01:57:15.950 --> 01:57:22.990]
I started the show with that. I'll play it again. I'm sorry. I just tuned in, my man. I'll play it at one o'clock. How's that? Thank you, sir. And get rid of George.

[01:57:24.030 --> 01:57:35.150]
Oh, we got rid of him this week. I thought we were going to like upgrade but it turns out we got Scott 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on the AT and T. We got a lot of calls on there. I mean, a lot of open lines.

[01:57:36.230 --> 01:57:41.610]
A lot of open lines on his board on a Monday and my first day back in town. So I don't have to make me want to stick around here too long. I'll tell you that.

[01:57:42.270 --> 01:58:00.550]
350 votes on a pool, which I think a racial group is the most protective or paranoid about its own blacks 159, Miriam, Jews 109, 109 as in PT 109, Cuban 64, Muslims 14, Italians 4, only four grease balls. Here's Miami Beach. Hello.

[01:58:01.430 --> 01:58:29.890]
Maybe not. Okay. I just want to comment on that. Stopped Caroline with the cops. Yeah. I was just a bait. My wife's out of town and she came back in the town. I told her what happened. What I thought I and we put on the local news. I thought,

[01:58:29.890 --> 01:58:38.590]
but everything seems to be blown off locally. No big deal. You know, the next thing I'm wondering, they're going to not come in front door in my house and just bash it. Oh, just looking. Just looking.

[01:58:40.810 --> 01:58:57.910]
So just just amazed and dismayed and disturbed by the whole thing. Now, the worst part of it is the way the public sits back and nothing shocks them anymore. They've been desensitized to the point of matter. What the crap goes on? It's like, oh gee, well, that's pretty interesting. Yeah. And everything's okay now. All of a sudden it's okay.

[01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:13.970]
Yeah. Very, very. Be afraid. Okay. Okay. Piling in there. See under the bed. You know, they got the what? Yeah. Look. Here's a call from Miami. When is this? Where are we going? Where are we going? He can be in a dress. But you know, give me an address.

[01:59:13.970 --> 01:59:43.130]
Yes. Five, six, and I get paid a lot more than you. I get paid more than one paycheck, pal. And you're going to make it two years. How do you like that? Loser. Don't worry about what I get paid. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How are you, buddy? Okay. I actually wanted to get your opinion on what happened in California with 22. My little girl that was taken to the hospital drowning and she was for not dead in 40 minutes later. Police officers are moving. Yeah. It's a damn good thing they didn't enjoy in the dumpster like they usually do.

[01:59:43.130 --> 02:00:13.070]
Yeah. This is exactly why I don't trust doctors. They reminded me of something from passions. You know, like Luis, he was underwater for about six hours. He came back up and they just tapped him on a chest of you. Oh, it looks like he'll be okay. What I didn't hear was during those 40 minutes when she was obviously alive. Where the parents notified that maybe she's. I have no idea. I didn't spend a lot of time on that story. And I'm saying she's alive. She'll be fine. Okay. Well, take it easy. And you're right. Dr. Suck. Drs. Blow. For the record, the show is a lot better when you're.

[02:00:13.070 --> 02:00:42.750]
Angle. So whatever I can do to piss you off. Just let me know. Okay. Thanks. Keep talking. It'll do it. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on you. We like it when you're pissed off. Cause then we can share our misery with you. We feel that we've succeeded in making you as miserable as the rest of us here in this festering toilet. All the way to work this morning. It's peeing and peeing and peeing and peeing. I'm thinking is it is November already? Does the rainy season ever end? No. No. Mo. Used to be like, you know, July and August were really bad. But no. Mo.

[02:00:42.750 --> 02:01:12.690]
No. No. No. Rain's air be God them day. No. 180 degrees. We've got the God them. Mosque is the size of bowling balls. I got a cool problem. But I. Well, I had a little cool problem on my patio. Really. Well, do they have very distinctive footprints? In fact, there was an article in the Herodius in the front page about raccoons. Did you see it, of course, not? No. And about how some people feed them and encourage them. It about how a lot of them got rabbi's. They're Jewish coins. And.

[02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:42.350]
And they leave it like when it rains. You can see the footprints out there. And you know, just probably come in and drink it out of the pool or like sniffing around the barbecue or whatever. They get big and nasty. But now that I have no more dogs, I made sure I got all my screens like fixed in there, my door and a whole deal. And they're not going to come in no more. No more coins in my hood. 27 past noon at 560 WQM.

My and local career sports radio 560's you a you a.m.

[02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:45.870]
I've broken through a bedroom window.

[02:02:48.590 --> 02:02:51.890]
And 5-8M to get my wick.

[02:02:54.490 --> 02:03:03.590]
And what I did I do was criminal. But that it doesn't do if you play for the fish.

[02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:10.430]
I guess my girlfriend forgot to tell me.

[02:03:13.050 --> 02:03:16.810]
That is not a bitch, but someone else is wild.

[02:03:16.810 --> 02:03:18.470]
A friend.

[02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:23.550]
A servant of the most beautiful bee that helps him.

[02:03:24.170 --> 02:03:32.350]
And I found out when it changed me with a knife. Why didn't that bitch tell me?

[02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:37.790]
It was too dark to see.

[02:03:39.810 --> 02:03:40.650]
You go, Cecil.

[02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:44.570]
She'd be in bed with her whole bed.

[02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:50.510]
And that's the best part of me.

[02:03:50.650 --> 02:03:51.910]
You don't feel me now.

[02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:56.010]
Don't worry, that's what they need. They need Cecil Collins back.

[02:03:56.110 --> 02:03:59.270]
I'll turn him around. Hey, Ricky, give me the ball. Give me the ball, Ricky.

[02:04:00.710 --> 02:04:01.850]
Was that pathetic or what?

[02:04:02.650 --> 02:04:07.570]
When you got tackled by the dreadlocks in that one play, I just about peed in my pants. That was so great.

[02:04:07.810 --> 02:04:13.310]
It was. And what did you get about the minus ADR's Russian? Whatever the hell number you got. 14 was on one play.

[02:04:15.890 --> 02:04:21.130]
You can't run against them. And once that the genius that he is says before the oh, we're gonna run them.

[02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.310]
We're gonna go back. We're gonna run Ricky right down their throats.

[02:04:25.090 --> 02:04:29.370]
The league in Russian physics. The second half of the season we're gonna be we're gonna be a bunch of running fools.

[02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:33.590]
Yeah, you're gonna be running all right right back to Chicago, Dave. You're gonna be running right out of town.

[02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:37.030]
It's gonna be great when the jets come in and deal them their death blow.

[02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:44.390]
Won't that be something because now that I got the Chad back, the man couldn't believe well, that was the Schmidt ball out there in Oakland yesterday.

[02:04:44.610 --> 02:04:51.210]
It was. That was pretty it was like, oh no, we don't want to you take it. No, we don't want to run our losing record.

[02:04:51.390 --> 02:04:53.010]
It's like the giant game the week before.

[02:04:54.190 --> 02:04:55.410]
And I was awfully nice.

[02:04:56.650 --> 02:05:04.130]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT. What is this thing? Somebody just faxed me cross dressing teens from a Harvey Milk High School

[02:05:04.130 --> 02:05:09.690]
offered sex for money in Greenwich Village and then robbed the would-be Johns by pretending to be cops versus at last night.

[02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:16.110]
This is from the New York Daily News. The boys all passing the solves off his ladies of the evening took money in credit cards from at least six men.

[02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:22.470]
This is from the Harvey Milk High School for fax. Five youths were arrested yesterday in the scam which cops they went like this.

[02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:28.110]
The students from the Astroplace High School for Gays and Lesbians promised men cruising the village various sex acts for money.

[02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:34.030]
Once the men stopped the students flashed fake NYPD badges and handcuffs and told the Johns they were undercover vice cops.

[02:05:34.590 --> 02:05:40.630]
In one case the youths brandished a gun. The team pushed them in against Walls handcuffed them and took their money credit cards and bank cards.

[02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:44.070]
They also demanded the person lie D number for the bank credit cards.

[02:05:44.210 --> 02:05:51.170]
We keep guns. Yeah, organized. Once they had the vatables the teens typically would say, oh you're not such a bad guy let them go.

[02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:53.270]
Now that I got your goods, so to speak.

[02:05:53.870 --> 02:06:02.270]
The robberies began October 5th when a 24-year-old man was hustled on Greenwich Avenue by a pair of teens in drag who would do twelve hundred bucks from his eight his account.

[02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:07.450]
The last robbery took place early yesterday when three teens stole eighty five bucks from man on West 16th Street.

[02:06:08.190 --> 02:06:17.970]
How do you like that? Gerald Kimberly Howard 17 was wearing a red wig with blonde highlights and a bright red sweatshirt and had handcuffs and police scanner with him when he was busted sources set.

[02:06:18.250 --> 02:06:19.990]
They said the piece was even better than mose.

[02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:28.790]
Howard began to blab sources set in last night cups that arrested four more Harvey Milk students were being held on charges of robbery and criminal impersonation of a police officer.

[02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:33.050]
How do you like that? You got to give him a hand at to him and the pin too.

[02:06:34.790 --> 02:06:43.070]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. We'll solve the problems in the world right here today before two o'clock. I guarantee you that.

[02:06:43.170 --> 02:06:47.930]
Don't mistake about it. Just like Mike Segal. Here's Tamarack. Hello.

[02:06:48.630 --> 02:07:03.190]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I called about something else, but since you did mention Dave wants that. I've got a 10 year old niece. Well, grand niece, but I want to learn her being coached by him for hot Scotch.

[02:07:03.270 --> 02:07:17.390]
We only have one thing to say today wants that. Bye bye. Bye. Beyond that. Yes. You're talking about George W. Bush. I'll tell you what really kept me off to the fact that he's a low life sock.

[02:07:17.930 --> 02:07:41.230]
As they say in Texas, yes, not a compliment. That is when he said, oh, that banner about mission accomplished. Well, that was those boys. I still have to cut my mission accomplished yet, but they feel it. There's he's bad freaking news. He's having American style daily, man. They're making it proud.

[02:07:49.470 --> 02:08:17.910]
Oh, that was great. I told you, talk about 600 calls, but I tell you what's in why you get to do a really good one. Here's one of the most chronic factors of them all. I love your show. Listen to me. Also happy to be Republican who lows in fears. Bush. Good. However, just want to remind you Canada's what is it is today because it's fortunate enough to share land space with the US. What kind of defense been? Well, what is that? What's going on right now? That's great. That's history. Our salvation army can kick their ass, but who would threaten them with the proximity of the US? Love your show. By the way, I'm not sure.

[02:08:17.930 --> 02:08:36.010]
Republican Congress and Democratic president are the key. Oh, yeah. There you go. Sure. Whatever the hell you say. I say a third party is the key. That's the answer. Real party. In fact, a very wise guy. I used to work in this building once told me what we need is a new party.

[02:08:39.110 --> 02:08:51.950]
Rest in peace. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Verizon. You know, they got the what? Yeah, look wireless line. Here's a call from plantation, which is usually not good. Hello.

[02:08:52.650 --> 02:09:04.070]
You can pay the money. See there. What I tell you? What did I tell you? Psychic powers again. The whisperer plantation. Hello. Meal. Yes, sir. Hey, we need about media diversity.

[02:09:04.070 --> 02:09:19.190]
These people are worried about the panthers, coaches, stuff. We've got state run television, state run news, rush limbaugh on 400 channels. What's going on? And what are you going to do about it? What's who going to do about it?

[02:09:19.710 --> 02:09:29.690]
They actually see came out with saying low power radio stations for diversity to. Yeah, forget about it. That's just the window dressing. Yeah, that's bull crap. Right. That's how low power light.

[02:09:34.970 --> 02:09:59.530]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[02:10:23.190 --> 02:10:24.910]
what is going on in this world? this world?

[02:10:24.910 --> 02:10:29.430]
is a place that doesn't have a network of provincial operators to cross each other

[02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.510]
all these Engineering services can be

[02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:32.870]
He had people jumpy when they heard of Fart.

[02:10:33.810 --> 02:10:37.010]
Monday morning went to get some ammo.

[02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:40.970]
Tuesday he goes shooting with his son.

[02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:45.610]
When say they get busted by the phone.

[02:10:47.050 --> 02:10:50.750]
They found a gun.

[02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:54.970]
Mike Burmohamed, part of a psychopath.

[02:10:54.970 --> 02:10:59.710]
And we will be happy till he's in the chair.

[02:11:03.710 --> 02:11:04.790]
I am here.

[02:11:07.590 --> 02:11:09.870]
Pro 44, that must be another racial thing.

[02:11:09.970 --> 02:11:14.410]
I would imagine 391 votes on it, which I think a racial group is most protective or paranoid

[02:11:14.410 --> 02:11:15.550]
about its own people.

[02:11:15.730 --> 02:11:22.670]
Blacks 180, Jews 120, Cuban 71, Muslim is 15, Italians 5, and Eric refuses to put the other

[02:11:22.670 --> 02:11:23.090]
ones on it.

[02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:24.530]
Because he's busy having brunch.

[02:11:26.150 --> 02:11:28.410]
He's busy and you didn't call him up like I told you to.

[02:11:28.730 --> 02:11:29.970]
I don't call him.

[02:11:30.410 --> 02:11:32.770]
He's been doing such a great job getting this stuff on here.

[02:11:33.070 --> 02:11:36.670]
And if you haven't seen the double weapon of mass destruction countdown yet without President

[02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:38.370]
say you better take a puke at it today.

[02:11:39.090 --> 02:11:41.170]
It walks, it talks, it moves, it moves it slips.

[02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:43.330]
And if them lips don't look just like precious.

[02:11:45.130 --> 02:11:49.130]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line.

[02:11:49.130 --> 02:11:49.690]
Here's Kendall.

[02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.990]
Hello.

[02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.390]
Hello?

[02:11:51.390 --> 02:11:52.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:52.530 --> 02:11:52.850]
Yeah.

[02:11:53.610 --> 02:11:53.930]
Yeah.

[02:11:54.230 --> 02:11:54.550]
Neil?

[02:11:54.690 --> 02:11:55.030]
Yes, sir.

[02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:57.610]
Hey, you're the voice of reason, it's time for first time call.

[02:11:57.870 --> 02:11:58.250]
All right.

[02:11:58.550 --> 02:12:01.790]
I just, I have to talk a lot of times you mentioned things but upstate New York.

[02:12:02.150 --> 02:12:05.050]
In 1979, I was playing against the Rochester Red Wing.

[02:12:05.170 --> 02:12:06.010]
I played in Charleston.

[02:12:06.270 --> 02:12:06.590]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.510]
You remember Winkeren Chickie's play for UM?

[02:12:09.150 --> 02:12:09.350]
Yeah.

[02:12:09.450 --> 02:12:11.050]
I used to do UM games, you respect.

[02:12:11.050 --> 02:12:11.410]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:11.670 --> 02:12:14.370]
Well, he was on that team and that night it was opening night.

[02:12:14.550 --> 02:12:18.090]
He took, he saw me and he took me out to a place called the Winfield Grill on Wickham

[02:12:18.090 --> 02:12:18.310]
Road.

[02:12:18.570 --> 02:12:19.170]
You ever go there?

[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:19.850]
Never heard of it.

[02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:21.570]
Okay, it was a hot spot back then.

[02:12:21.730 --> 02:12:21.830]
Right.

[02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:23.050]
I met a girl then.

[02:12:23.150 --> 02:12:25.330]
It was 79 and she's one of my girlfriend ever sent her.

[02:12:25.330 --> 02:12:25.470]
We did.

[02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:30.210]
I was going up there for 24 years and she was right down the road from Mendenton Park

[02:12:30.210 --> 02:12:31.170]
on Clover Street.

[02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.510]
Yes.

[02:12:31.810 --> 02:12:33.510]
I've heard you mentioned Mendenton Park before.

[02:12:33.670 --> 02:12:33.850]
Sure.

[02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:37.890]
Yeah, but I guess every time you mentioned something from up that way, I know that area

[02:12:37.890 --> 02:12:39.810]
pretty good now from going up there for so many years.

[02:12:40.610 --> 02:12:43.430]
I guess, like I said, and that's something else you've mentioned before.

[02:12:43.610 --> 02:12:43.970]
Toronto.

[02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:47.290]
We were up there about a year and a half ago and I went to the hockey hall of fame there

[02:12:47.290 --> 02:12:47.870]
in Toronto.

[02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:50.170]
It had a great time, fantastic time.

[02:12:50.290 --> 02:12:51.410]
Well, that's a hockey town, man.

[02:12:51.550 --> 02:12:53.790]
It's people where people really, you know, they're into what it's a religion.

[02:12:54.230 --> 02:12:57.550]
Well, like I said, it's first time car and I enjoy listening to you mentally and keep

[02:12:57.550 --> 02:12:58.110]
up a good work.

[02:12:58.170 --> 02:12:58.750]
Thanks a lot, Pellie.

[02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:59.250]
Have a great day.

[02:12:59.290 --> 02:12:59.410]
Okay.

[02:12:59.710 --> 02:12:59.970]
Bye-bye.

[02:13:00.190 --> 02:13:01.290]
See you at the Vick and Irves.

[02:13:02.490 --> 02:13:03.930]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:13:04.050 --> 02:13:04.910]
See you at the 12 corners.

[02:13:05.370 --> 02:13:06.790]
Monroe Avenue and Wynton Road, baby.

[02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:09.750]
See you at 123 for Weenah Drive in Brighton, New York.

[02:13:10.610 --> 02:13:10.890]
What?

[02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:13.690]
The way you just rattle off these names.

[02:13:14.070 --> 02:13:15.370]
That's why you still live when I was a kid.

[02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:16.430]
I can even give you the phone number.

[02:13:16.430 --> 02:13:20.510]
Monroe 5, 7, 7, 0, M. You'd see you don't remember when you'd have prefixes with letters.

[02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:21.230]
No, not at all.

[02:13:21.290 --> 02:13:23.050]
I remember dial phones, rotary phones.

[02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:27.430]
Yeah, well, when years old is I am, remember when Bill made that first call.

[02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:33.110]
Mary had a little lamb, but seriously, we used to have prefixes, you know, like in New

[02:13:33.110 --> 02:13:35.010]
York, they had 85 million prefixes.

[02:13:36.310 --> 02:13:39.150]
And our number was Monroe 5, 7, 7, 0, M.

[02:13:39.730 --> 02:13:39.930]
Wow.

[02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:41.110]
How do you like that?

[02:13:41.390 --> 02:13:41.870]
How do that work?

[02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:43.230]
How do what work?

[02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:44.570]
Prefixes like that.

[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:45.810]
All right, what was the prefix?

[02:13:46.090 --> 02:13:47.270]
Monroe, what would be the prefix?

[02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:48.150]
M-O-M.

[02:13:48.670 --> 02:13:49.390]
M-O.

[02:13:49.690 --> 02:13:49.870]
Mo.

[02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:52.830]
Don't you understand it?

[02:13:53.570 --> 02:13:54.690]
Mo was the prefix.

[02:13:55.450 --> 02:13:56.750]
Monroe would be like the first.

[02:13:57.130 --> 02:13:57.570]
No, no.

[02:13:57.730 --> 02:13:57.890]
Yeah.

[02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.790]
No, no.

[02:13:59.290 --> 02:14:03.090]
Monroe 5, 7, 7, 0, M.

[02:14:04.510 --> 02:14:06.310]
Give it a call now, maybe somebody's going to answer the phone.

[02:14:06.430 --> 02:14:08.030]
Maybe the yellow answer the phone, but I doubt it.

[02:14:08.490 --> 02:14:09.710]
You don't get paid enough through that.

[02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:14.130]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T.

[02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:15.970]
Yeah, why do you like Canada so much?

[02:14:16.190 --> 02:14:17.230]
Why do you like Toronto so much?

[02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:18.710]
Why are you such a goddamn set of a bet?

[02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:19.710]
Because I feel like it.

[02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:21.370]
Because I feel like it.

[02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.930]
How do you like that?

[02:14:22.310 --> 02:14:23.750]
Because I say what the hell is on my mind.

[02:14:23.890 --> 02:14:25.450]
That's what they pay me the big bucks for.

[02:14:25.710 --> 02:14:26.670]
In fact, they like me so much.

[02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:27.850]
Sometimes they try to pay me twice.

[02:14:29.250 --> 02:14:30.350]
Did you hear that scam before?

[02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:31.930]
We're duff trying to bring me to check, Miguel.

[02:14:32.670 --> 02:14:33.390]
Brow me a check.

[02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:35.210]
I already got paid Friday at 12.

[02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:36.870]
I said I paid the day early Friday.

[02:14:38.190 --> 02:14:39.310]
It brings me in another check.

[02:14:40.690 --> 02:14:43.010]
And I did not accept it because I'm an honest guy.

[02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:44.250]
Plus they would have caught it anyway.

[02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:45.570]
If I'd have thought they wouldn't have caught it.

[02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:46.750]
I said, hey, sure no problem.

[02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:48.610]
Well, no, they're going to catch it anyway.

[02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:50.510]
And then they're going to think, oh my god,

[02:14:50.510 --> 02:14:52.510]
we got a scam artist working here.

[02:14:52.650 --> 02:14:52.810]
You know?

[02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:55.890]
I mean, if it was you, sure you'd take it

[02:14:55.890 --> 02:14:57.230]
because you couldn't pay peanuts anyways.

[02:14:57.230 --> 02:14:58.210]
You can afford to steal it.

[02:14:58.270 --> 02:15:00.270]
But with me, I can't do that.

[02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:01.470]
I got it's making my kind of money.

[02:15:01.470 --> 02:15:03.210]
Just ask Rimmer and Mitchell, I'll tell you.

[02:15:03.710 --> 02:15:04.510]
They just have a lot of money.

[02:15:05.790 --> 02:15:07.050]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:07.330]
Hello.

[02:15:08.430 --> 02:15:09.830]
Boy, you're just a trip man.

[02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:11.370]
The way you look like that, you know,

[02:15:11.370 --> 02:15:12.310]
how many of you wrote things out?

[02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.770]
It's great.

[02:15:13.050 --> 02:15:13.550]
Yeah, it is.

[02:15:14.050 --> 02:15:15.410]
What kind of phone are you in, man?

[02:15:15.510 --> 02:15:17.450]
Sounds like it's underwater.

[02:15:18.630 --> 02:15:19.250]
Is that better?

[02:15:19.470 --> 02:15:20.130]
That's a little better.

[02:15:20.290 --> 02:15:21.130]
Yeah, it's crappy phone.

[02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:23.390]
I take the phone back and tell them to stuff it.

[02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:25.250]
Yeah, a piece of junk AT&T motor.

[02:15:25.530 --> 02:15:28.670]
Oh, it's a work phone company.

[02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.810]
It's a little better now.

[02:15:29.890 --> 02:15:30.750]
It's clearing up a little bit.

[02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:32.850]
Just like Scott's complexion, little.

[02:15:34.010 --> 02:15:37.590]
I wanted a reference to the thing that you

[02:15:38.130 --> 02:15:39.710]
told last week with the CBC.

[02:15:39.890 --> 02:15:40.110]
Yes.

[02:15:40.110 --> 02:15:43.210]
I went this weekend to the website and I actually

[02:15:43.210 --> 02:15:44.870]
put it out a bunch of stuff from there.

[02:15:45.730 --> 02:15:49.770]
I went with, I had a family gathering on Saturday evening, so I went on and, you know,

[02:15:49.770 --> 02:15:51.310]
showing people all this information.

[02:15:52.050 --> 02:15:55.530]
And my family, yeah, they're pretty bright and they're pretty open to things.

[02:15:55.970 --> 02:15:58.070]
But you know, they had the capacity to say to me,

[02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:59.470]
that I've never got all of this up.

[02:15:59.830 --> 02:16:00.110]
Yeah.

[02:16:00.610 --> 02:16:01.650]
I didn't make this up.

[02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:03.370]
I put it up from the CBC website.

[02:16:03.670 --> 02:16:05.630]
They said, we don't believe one word of this.

[02:16:05.850 --> 02:16:07.010]
You must be out of your mind.

[02:16:07.090 --> 02:16:07.910]
Oh, yeah, right.

[02:16:08.330 --> 02:16:12.030]
I said to them, I said, well, I'm going to just, you know, near a car on Monday and try

[02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:14.330]
to find out if you could either do one of two things.

[02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:18.670]
One, see if you could put the audio up on the website or if you could possibly play

[02:16:18.670 --> 02:16:20.730]
that the whole thing for us and let us know.

[02:16:20.870 --> 02:16:22.470]
Well, again, I played it again on Friday.

[02:16:22.610 --> 02:16:23.970]
I'm not going to play it every day.

[02:16:23.970 --> 02:16:25.130]
That would kill an easy hour.

[02:16:25.230 --> 02:16:25.890]
I'm not going to do that.

[02:16:26.470 --> 02:16:26.770]
All right.

[02:16:26.930 --> 02:16:28.050]
Well, what do you mean?

[02:16:28.210 --> 02:16:29.250]
They don't believe it.

[02:16:29.310 --> 02:16:30.270]
What do they think they came from?

[02:16:30.370 --> 02:16:31.070]
You just made it up?

[02:16:31.610 --> 02:16:31.930]
Exactly.

[02:16:32.210 --> 02:16:33.390]
They said it.

[02:16:33.390 --> 02:16:33.990]
Yeah, sir.

[02:16:34.170 --> 02:16:36.030]
Sir, listen, you're spinning your wheels.

[02:16:36.190 --> 02:16:36.850]
Don't waste your time.

[02:16:36.850 --> 02:16:38.290]
OK, consider the source, you know.

[02:16:39.550 --> 02:16:41.350]
There's an old saying where there's no sense.

[02:16:41.370 --> 02:16:42.230]
There's no feeling.

[02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:45.330]
Well, I'm glad that we have a good time to give us that money.

[02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:46.430]
Me too, because I need the money.

[02:16:46.570 --> 02:16:47.170]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:48.170]
Have a great day.

[02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:49.550]
See you around, eh?

[02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:51.690]
Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60.

[02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:52.790]
Go, leave school, baby.

[02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.890]
Let's see who we playing tonight.

[02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:55.450]
Oh, that's right there on the West Coast now.

[02:16:55.510 --> 02:16:56.670]
This turn at 60 Road Trip.

[02:16:57.170 --> 02:16:58.030]
Who are they starting with?

[02:16:58.310 --> 02:16:59.090]
Mighty Ducks, I believe.

[02:16:59.490 --> 02:16:59.810]
Uh-oh.

[02:17:00.170 --> 02:17:00.870]
When is that game?

[02:17:01.090 --> 02:17:01.830]
I don't really care.

[02:17:02.370 --> 02:17:02.890]
I don't want to know.

[02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:04.270]
Scary.

[02:17:04.270 --> 02:17:07.610]
No, actually, they have played better than I thought they would at this point.

[02:17:07.950 --> 02:17:11.970]
They have tied Jersey again, Friday and beat Edmonton, four to one.

[02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:16.810]
McGilley tried to give the puck to what a kid Matt's stage in there for the empty head goal.

[02:17:16.810 --> 02:17:20.050]
If you see that, yeah, and his pass, unfortunately, a stage it was getting checked.

[02:17:20.210 --> 02:17:21.250]
His pass lit into the net.

[02:17:21.330 --> 02:17:21.630]
Nice going.

[02:17:21.890 --> 02:17:22.790]
Number 89, man.

[02:17:22.890 --> 02:17:23.850]
McGilley is so underrated.

[02:17:23.990 --> 02:17:24.490]
He's so great.

[02:17:24.670 --> 02:17:26.490]
He is just, he's a pleasure to watch.

[02:17:26.670 --> 02:17:28.530]
We've been watching him for years, following him for years.

[02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:31.490]
Yeah, 76 goals with the Sabers about 100 years ago.

[02:17:31.510 --> 02:17:32.090]
And he's still great.

[02:17:32.730 --> 02:17:33.670]
Anybody know who that is?

[02:17:34.170 --> 02:17:39.350]
No, sorry, sorry, Mr. 401 votes on there and the dark folks seem to be walking away with it today.

[02:17:39.890 --> 02:17:41.750]
They seem to be a step ahead of the Jews.

[02:17:42.790 --> 02:17:44.410]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:45.030]
Hello.

[02:17:46.090 --> 02:17:46.830]
Hey, Neil.

[02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.430]
Yes, sir.

[02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:52.970]
I just wanted to like give you a job like Mike Moore's book.

[02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.810]
It was great.

[02:17:54.150 --> 02:17:56.430]
It was right phenomenal.

[02:17:56.470 --> 02:17:57.130]
It is.

[02:17:57.510 --> 02:17:59.810]
You got to read the Frankenboy.

[02:18:00.490 --> 02:18:01.990]
I got it in my apartment up there.

[02:18:02.010 --> 02:18:02.670]
I'll read one and get back.

[02:18:03.030 --> 02:18:06.690]
I'm reading right now the David Corn book, The Lies of George W. Bush.

[02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:15.510]
But just for your reader, mean three to listeners, that it's just like easy to read and...

[02:18:15.510 --> 02:18:16.910]
Well, that's good for this crowd.

[02:18:17.090 --> 02:18:17.510]
That's really...

[02:18:17.510 --> 02:18:17.870]
Exactly.

[02:18:19.510 --> 02:18:21.510]
But everyone should check it out.

[02:18:21.810 --> 02:18:27.110]
The lies and the liars and all that air and culture and that's a big bitch.

[02:18:27.730 --> 02:18:30.010]
Okay, pal, I'll get on as soon as I get back.

[02:18:30.130 --> 02:18:30.710]
I vote.

[02:18:30.930 --> 02:18:31.150]
Thanks.

[02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:34.010]
Here's the fact that says, oh, no, this is bad.

[02:18:36.270 --> 02:18:41.170]
The Sunsental must think that you dark folks all look the same because rookie award may

[02:18:41.170 --> 02:18:45.190]
be Willis and the picture they have of Don Trail Willis is really one peer.

[02:18:45.330 --> 02:18:45.730]
Look at it even.

[02:18:45.870 --> 02:18:46.230]
I know that.

[02:18:46.330 --> 02:18:47.530]
I don't pay much attention to the Marlins.

[02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:48.390]
It is.

[02:18:48.490 --> 02:18:52.770]
There's one peer on the bottom and the article is about Don Trail Willis and it says

[02:18:52.770 --> 02:18:53.710]
Willis under the picture.

[02:18:53.710 --> 02:18:58.090]
You people of the Sunsental, your idiot's okay, you're much of morons.

[02:18:59.270 --> 02:19:03.150]
You would know a goddamn newspaper story if they slid it up time to his ass.

[02:19:03.330 --> 02:19:04.830]
You people of the Sunsental, what a disgrace.

[02:19:05.330 --> 02:19:08.750]
That's another reason this town is full of bozos going, put him up like that, give me

[02:19:08.750 --> 02:19:11.150]
the ball, give me the ball, because there are two newspapers here, suck.

[02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.690]
You suck.

[02:19:14.550 --> 02:19:19.090]
Don Trail Willis, my fat old Yidd Fagass, man, it's one peer.

[02:19:19.770 --> 02:19:20.810]
What do you think wraps better?

[02:19:23.970 --> 02:19:26.990]
I'll tell you one thing, you put the hero on the bottom of a bird cage and your bird

[02:19:26.990 --> 02:19:28.090]
will leave home.

[02:19:28.370 --> 02:19:30.050]
We'll fly right out and never come back.

[02:19:30.250 --> 02:19:31.970]
I'm telling you, let me see your bird again.

[02:19:33.530 --> 02:19:38.410]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, I tell you the story about my limo driver yet.

[02:19:39.710 --> 02:19:45.930]
On the 18 and 10 and Verizon, hey, you know, I couldn't have made up a better story than

[02:19:45.930 --> 02:19:46.090]
that.

[02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.370]
Could I?

[02:19:46.730 --> 02:19:46.890]
No.

[02:19:46.890 --> 02:19:49.070]
First of all, he still thinks some guy picked me up.

[02:19:49.070 --> 02:19:52.210]
To this moment until I gave that story, he didn't even know who to help me home.

[02:19:52.290 --> 02:19:54.030]
I could have walked home.

[02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:56.030]
I could like hitchhiked.

[02:19:56.730 --> 02:19:57.630]
He doesn't know.

[02:19:58.170 --> 02:20:00.430]
He didn't even follow through on it to find out what all happened.

[02:20:01.570 --> 02:20:04.610]
I'll then call on the house and realizing I wasn't there yet and then realizing I'd

[02:20:04.610 --> 02:20:05.210]
never called him back.

[02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:08.570]
So I must have been pretty pissed off, which is why he emailed me just before the show

[02:20:08.570 --> 02:20:09.030]
this morning.

[02:20:09.370 --> 02:20:10.770]
Yeah, see why I ate real quick.

[02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:13.090]
Yeah, he covered it big and fat, man.

[02:20:13.630 --> 02:20:15.570]
Plus you got a sour attitude, too, Ken.

[02:20:15.570 --> 02:20:17.030]
I just want to tell you that right now, OK?

[02:20:17.490 --> 02:20:20.750]
I don't want to sound like an in grade, but your attitude is kind of like sour after,

[02:20:20.750 --> 02:20:24.770]
especially after coming back from Europe that long nine and a half hour flight, which

[02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:26.030]
thank God I don't do no more.

[02:20:26.690 --> 02:20:27.610]
He had to go to Boca.

[02:20:28.710 --> 02:20:29.070]
Took him.

[02:20:29.070 --> 02:20:30.150]
He got there in 35 minutes.

[02:20:30.270 --> 02:20:30.850]
How do you like that?

[02:20:30.930 --> 02:20:32.730]
I was going to say I'd take Motivision or Parker some.

[02:20:32.770 --> 02:20:35.650]
Yeah, I probably had to take Motivision or BagChange joint.

[02:20:36.470 --> 02:20:36.670]
Yeah.

[02:20:37.050 --> 02:20:38.170]
They had to clean out his bag.

[02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:40.870]
I hope he had to stand there and sniff it.

[02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.850]
Oh, no.

[02:20:42.010 --> 02:20:43.450]
Do you see Carl Gablesitz is on there?

[02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:44.490]
You know, you know what that's going to be?

[02:20:44.490 --> 02:20:44.890]
Yep.

[02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.930]
Another one of those.

[02:20:46.290 --> 02:20:47.770]
Here's Carl Gablesitz predictable.

[02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:48.230]
Hello.

[02:20:48.530 --> 02:20:49.610]
How are you doing?

[02:20:49.730 --> 02:20:50.070]
Pretty good.

[02:20:50.530 --> 02:20:54.310]
I wanted to let you know, I'm leaving the country tomorrow and I wanted to thank you for

[02:20:54.310 --> 02:20:56.430]
all the years of a fine program from here.

[02:20:56.430 --> 02:20:58.410]
This is a real call from Carl Gablesitz.

[02:20:58.970 --> 02:20:59.410]
It's rare.

[02:20:59.970 --> 02:21:01.210]
I can't believe it.

[02:21:01.270 --> 02:21:03.710]
Well, I'm not a, you know, I moved in California three years ago.

[02:21:03.970 --> 02:21:06.270]
I think I lost up there with fate when I did that.

[02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:07.330]
Yeah, that was a bad move.

[02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:11.930]
Yeah, well, I see it's so bad I have to not only need the state, I have to meet the

[02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:12.250]
country.

[02:21:12.250 --> 02:21:12.830]
So, uh-huh.

[02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:15.090]
That's also a good move.

[02:21:15.210 --> 02:21:19.210]
Well, hopefully, you know, the United States Socialist Public or USSR is becoming a bit interesting.

[02:21:21.870 --> 02:21:26.290]
But I figured out, my job has to fund somewhere else and just look out from the, you know,

[02:21:26.410 --> 02:21:27.810]
look out in it's rather more fun.

[02:21:28.010 --> 02:21:29.010]
Just find your lookout.

[02:21:29.790 --> 02:21:31.030]
Thank you so much for all the years.

[02:21:31.190 --> 02:21:31.870]
You've been the best, Neil.

[02:21:32.010 --> 02:21:32.670]
Yes, I have been.

[02:21:32.810 --> 02:21:33.630]
I mean, you used to be pretty good.

[02:21:33.730 --> 02:21:34.210]
Have a great day.

[02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:34.970]
Paddy, good luck to you.

[02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.750]
Have a great life.

[02:21:36.010 --> 02:21:37.370]
I used to be really good once upon a time.

[02:21:38.250 --> 02:21:40.850]
I mean, that was when I was younger when I was an old daughtering angry fart.

[02:21:40.850 --> 02:21:43.070]
About 30 years ago, I was pretty good.

[02:21:43.150 --> 02:21:44.470]
Then I came here and then look what happened.

[02:21:44.610 --> 02:21:45.150]
Oh my God.

[02:21:45.230 --> 02:21:46.970]
And I'm, and has happened wild diarrhea.

[02:21:47.470 --> 02:21:50.450]
And my mother calls up to tell me, don't drink diet so it'll give you wild diarrhea.

[02:21:50.810 --> 02:21:54.630]
If you'd worry a lot less about my mom's mom, life would be a hell of a lot better.

[02:21:54.690 --> 02:21:56.250]
Your blood pressure would go down 40 points.

[02:21:57.330 --> 02:21:58.050]
I'm serious.

[02:21:58.250 --> 02:21:58.990]
That's, that's it.

[02:21:59.110 --> 02:21:59.290]
90.

[02:21:59.590 --> 02:22:03.470]
When you read her autobiography, 90 years of squeezing it, it's, it's going to be incredible.

[02:22:04.350 --> 02:22:05.310]
Yeah, your brother last week.

[02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:09.770]
And my brother four days visiting mom and didn't have a good, didn't have any B.M.

[02:22:09.770 --> 02:22:10.430]
Till the fourth day.

[02:22:10.610 --> 02:22:12.750]
See, so I get a report on everybody in my family.

[02:22:15.470 --> 02:22:16.330]
Do you get that?

[02:22:16.590 --> 02:22:17.990]
Anybody tell you about their bowel movements?

[02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:19.310]
No.

[02:22:19.470 --> 02:22:21.210]
Well, that's what you're missing, you see?

[02:22:22.030 --> 02:22:22.390]
Thankfully.

[02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:26.350]
I would tell them, listen, another family, they stayed there a little bit more up front

[02:22:26.350 --> 02:22:27.550]
with each other, a little bit more honest.

[02:22:28.110 --> 02:22:29.210]
I come from the Italian household.

[02:22:29.470 --> 02:22:31.010]
They talk about their gallbladder surgery.

[02:22:31.150 --> 02:22:32.730]
Oh, well, I don't have my gallbladder no more.

[02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:34.470]
Although, you want me to tell you about my surgery?

[02:22:34.470 --> 02:22:53.850]
It was my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

[02:22:57.050 --> 02:23:23.470]
my leg, my leg, my leg , my leg, my leg, my leg, my leg, my leg doll, my leg, my leg, my leg doll, my leg doll my leg

[02:23:23.470 --> 02:23:27.310]
30 June Miami Dolphins

[02:23:27.310 --> 02:23:29.470]
Miami Dolphins

[02:23:29.470 --> 02:23:32.250]
Don't bet on them you'll always lose

[02:23:35.410 --> 02:23:37.730]
They don't know how to tackle

[02:23:37.730 --> 02:23:39.810]
They don't know how to block

[02:23:39.810 --> 02:23:42.590]
Their coaches ought to tell them to

[02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:44.430]
Put them day in their jocks

[02:23:44.430 --> 02:23:46.730]
And they would run much faster

[02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:48.750]
And even in defeat

[02:23:48.750 --> 02:23:51.450]
When we go to the stadium

[02:23:51.450 --> 02:23:53.350]
We'll see Miami heat

[02:23:53.350 --> 02:23:56.550]
And they're the Miami Dolphins

[02:23:56.550 --> 02:23:58.670]
Miami Dolphins

[02:23:58.670 --> 02:24:00.790]
Miami Dolphins number

[02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:02.170]
How many teams in the way?

[02:24:03.070 --> 02:24:05.430]
32 Miami Dolphins

[02:24:05.430 --> 02:24:07.590]
Miami Dolphins

[02:24:07.590 --> 02:24:10.510]
The team that hasn't got a clue

[02:24:13.710 --> 02:24:15.910]
Miami has the dolphins

[02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:18.050]
But the dolphins have no fans

[02:24:18.050 --> 02:24:20.690]
Just 50,000 assholes

[02:24:20.690 --> 02:24:22.590]
Sitting in the stands

[02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:25.290]
They watch the game and all they do

[02:24:25.290 --> 02:24:27.050]
Is moan and gripe and bitch

[02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:30.310]
I wonder how Jo Rabi got to be

[02:24:30.310 --> 02:24:32.310]
So goddamn rich and they're the

[02:24:32.310 --> 02:24:34.470]
Miami Dolphins

[02:24:34.470 --> 02:24:34.730]
Oh!

[02:24:35.410 --> 02:24:36.810]
Miami Dolphins

[02:24:36.810 --> 02:24:38.990]
Miami Dolphins number

[02:24:38.990 --> 02:24:40.410]
How many teams in the league?

[02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:41.230]
God you do!

[02:24:41.610 --> 02:24:43.630]
Miami Dolphins

[02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:45.770]
Miami Dolphins

[02:24:45.770 --> 02:24:48.390]
I hear the crowd begin to boo

[02:24:48.390 --> 02:24:51.190]
Boo, boo, boo, boo

[02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:54.190]
The dolphins have J. Feedler

[02:24:54.190 --> 02:24:56.210]
That quarter backs at you

[02:24:56.210 --> 02:25:00.750]
Run down the field and he will throw a pass over you

[02:25:00.750 --> 02:25:03.450]
Or he'll never win a super bowl

[02:25:03.450 --> 02:25:05.350]
You shouldn't be surprised

[02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:07.970]
When he gets cut that doesn't mean

[02:25:07.970 --> 02:25:10.270]
That he was circumcised in there

[02:25:10.270 --> 02:25:12.830]
The Miami Dolphins

[02:25:12.830 --> 02:25:15.090]
Miami Dolphins

[02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:17.170]
Miami Dolphins number

[02:25:17.170 --> 02:25:18.550]
How many teams in the league?

[02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:19.530]
Pity two

[02:25:19.530 --> 02:25:21.810]
Miami Dolphins

[02:25:21.810 --> 02:25:23.970]
Miami Dolphins

[02:25:23.970 --> 02:25:26.550]
J. calls his signals in Hebrew

[02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.470]
Oh!

[02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.970]
Oh!

[02:25:28.490 --> 02:25:28.490]

[02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:32.330]
The dolphins have no defense

[02:25:32.330 --> 02:25:34.430]
And their offense is a joke

[02:25:34.430 --> 02:25:36.970]
Like George Bush eating pretzels

[02:25:36.970 --> 02:25:39.070]
You know they're gonna choke

[02:25:39.070 --> 02:25:41.410]
They'll always disappoint you

[02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:43.550]
When they're in a playoff race

[02:25:43.550 --> 02:25:46.010]
With fewer points than Pac-Marx

[02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:48.430]
On high zingas ugly face in there

[02:25:48.430 --> 02:25:50.990]
The Miami Dolphins

[02:25:50.990 --> 02:25:53.270]
Miami Dolphins

[02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:55.370]
Miami Dolphins number

[02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:56.470]
Oh, what the hell?

[02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:57.390]
32

[02:25:58.110 --> 02:26:00.030]
Miami Dolphins

[02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:02.290]
Miami Dolphins

[02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:05.530]
Miami Dolphins

[02:26:05.530 --> 02:26:07.330]
Now they're through

[02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:16.070]
Miami Dolphins

[02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:17.950]
102-560 WQM boy today

[02:26:17.950 --> 02:26:18.890]
Sucker what huh?

[02:26:18.990 --> 02:26:19.870]
They are brutal

[02:26:20.390 --> 02:26:20.790]
Awful

[02:26:21.670 --> 02:26:22.470]
Embarrassing humiliating

[02:26:22.470 --> 02:26:24.590]
I would say I'm taking a three other games

[02:26:25.270 --> 02:26:27.530]
The 62 to 7 loss to Jacksonville playoffs

[02:26:27.530 --> 02:26:28.310]
Few years ago

[02:26:28.310 --> 02:26:30.230]
And then their I remember what season was

[02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:31.850]
But at the end of the year they were playing the bills

[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:35.310]
The end of the season they played the bills the last game

[02:26:35.310 --> 02:26:39.930]
Before the playoffs and just got blown out and then they went up to Buffalo when it's snowing got blown out again

[02:26:39.930 --> 02:26:41.330]
And the opening round the playoffs

[02:26:42.390 --> 02:26:44.710]
Few years ago they didn't make any see this isn't a sports show

[02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:49.110]
So I haven't had a look on your face like oh wow, I don't remember you know, it was does make a difference what year was

[02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:54.270]
I remember when they got blacked out during a playoff game right against the Colts and they couldn't sell it out

[02:26:54.270 --> 02:26:55.270]
That's right when it's out

[02:26:55.270 --> 02:27:00.290]
This is such a great football town. We couldn't saw it a playoff game. Is that embarrassing or what huh?

[02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:02.570]
And I mean it doesn't make any difference

[02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:08.510]
But it's just the idea the reason you enjoy it is because when you're rooting for another team the people here take it so hard

[02:27:08.510 --> 02:27:12.790]
Because that's that's like the Marlins with the world series. You know how fast that disappeared

[02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:18.050]
When the people taking the baseball camps back to Kmart for refund well, we went to the parade now

[02:27:18.050 --> 02:27:20.210]
Can we have our money back? You know like we're never gonna go again

[02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:23.730]
And we're certainly not gonna go to any games because my cost is some money

[02:27:25.630 --> 02:27:27.590]
So that like Vanne said that's history

[02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:34.330]
But they take it like oh aren't we blast down here Jim aren't we curse down here Jim like the whole quality of life

[02:27:34.330 --> 02:27:37.190]
Is she was based on the successor failure of your sports teams?

[02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:42.830]
Well, I'll tell you one thing if that's the case for last 36 years Toronto must must be a cesspool

[02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:44.650]
You know what what how would I want to be there?

[02:27:45.290 --> 02:27:49.830]
For last 36 years any cups no any chance no it ain't here

[02:27:50.930 --> 02:27:52.870]
What's that that's why you're not here?

Neil yes, sir. How's it going? Okay good good. I want to tell you a couple comments

[02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:43.890]
Number one boarding for call on mine. Whoever hasn't seen it go out and rent it right now. It's a great movie

[02:28:43.890 --> 02:28:46.210]
Have you seen it? Yes

[02:28:46.850 --> 02:28:50.210]
Number two, I want to say thank you because I checked out the website

[02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:53.290]
Over the weekend and saw some of the info from

[02:28:54.450 --> 02:28:57.850]
CBCC B.C. Yeah, it was totally I mean, I was a little bit

[02:28:58.290 --> 02:29:03.570]
I wouldn't be sure about it, but I kept on reading you know, it sounded like you know stuff that the government would want to say no

[02:29:03.570 --> 02:29:08.790]
Stuff that sounded somewhat true. I'm a lot more informed. We've got him. Yeah, it's not so much. True. It's all documented

[02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:11.590]
It's not like somebody pulled it out of a hat or just made it up

[02:29:12.070 --> 02:29:17.690]
And especially the part about the government trying to hide all the information classifying it all it's uh, um, you know

[02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:19.410]
We can find more information like that or not

[02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:24.230]
Where you can find more while I read some books to be good like go on our website and you'll see a whole list

[02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:29.130]
The books you ought to be reading like the al-frankin book and the david corn book and the molly ivens book

[02:29:31.150 --> 02:29:36.290]
And the michael more book since he mentioned bowling for column buying the new michael more dude wears my country

[02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:39.550]
That's what you ought to be reading which are read 20 pages or 30 pages on the air

[02:29:40.190 --> 02:29:45.250]
That's what you ought to be doing pal read do some reading don't believe that out of the media and sure as I don't believe your government

[02:29:46.610 --> 02:29:51.610]
They're having a subpoena the white house the the committee that they appointed to investigate 9-11

[02:29:51.610 --> 02:29:55.970]
They're having a subpoena the the records that the white house refuses to turn over

[02:29:56.970 --> 02:30:02.350]
You don't know my answer. It's like and the media continues to pass along stuff and you listen to what you think

[02:30:02.350 --> 02:30:08.350]
You people must think we're all morons like with Arnold while Arnold said that once the election was over

[02:30:08.350 --> 02:30:11.330]
He would investigate these allegations against him

[02:30:12.150 --> 02:30:14.490]
Have you ever heard of anything so ludicrous in your life

[02:30:14.490 --> 02:30:18.270]
He's gonna get a private investigation going of the charges against him

[02:30:18.270 --> 02:30:19.770]
That would be like Ted Bundy sin

[02:30:19.770 --> 02:30:22.870]
Well, I don't really know remembering of that but I'm gonna I'll connect it

[02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:26.770]
It's like oh Jay saying he's gonna investigate the murders of Ron and Nicole same thing

[02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:31.990]
He's gonna investigate is it is if he doesn't know whether we did all these things or not Arnold

[02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:39.010]
And the media reports it like oh this makes sense don't don't you understand he's gonna investigate it

[02:30:39.470 --> 02:30:39.870]
What

[02:30:40.850 --> 02:30:43.770]
Like Hitler's gonna investigate whether those people really died or not

[02:30:45.090 --> 02:30:50.590]
Well, wait for that. Yeah, but I'm just as an example. I mean how can anybody be so stupid as to believe that

[02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:53.670]
How could the media be so irresponsible as to put it in those terms?

[02:30:53.810 --> 02:30:57.610]
Well, you know, he's he told Tom Broca. He's gonna investigate it once the election is over

[02:30:59.530 --> 02:30:59.930]
The

[02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:07.350]
Right it would be like Bubba saying oh, I'll investigate about those blow jobs. I'll conduct an investigation

[02:31:09.810 --> 02:31:12.550]
Oh, yeah, he's going to haul the dry cleaners

[02:31:14.550 --> 02:31:16.870]
What a joke man. What are freaking joking?

[02:31:16.990 --> 02:31:20.470]
By the way little jury you can send at facts eight million times. I don't look at it

[02:31:20.470 --> 02:31:24.350]
Not interested. You're an idiot and thanks for listening to that top-rated show in the USA

[02:31:25.490 --> 02:31:26.810]
In the world in the universe

[02:31:28.590 --> 02:31:34.670]
5670560. No, this is see this is a guy used to send with little squeaky writing for years and years every single day

[02:31:34.670 --> 02:31:38.370]
You're an idiot. You're out of your mean. You're nasty and now he tries

[02:31:38.370 --> 02:31:39.490]
He's got something a new deal

[02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:43.430]
But I have to do is he'd like one word on the facts. You know who it is. He sends it over and over again

[02:31:43.430 --> 02:31:46.850]
So no, do we have to take his radio? We got to take his facts machine now, too

[02:31:46.850 --> 02:31:49.410]
No, we just have to take him into burn his ass

[02:31:49.410 --> 02:31:53.870]
Oh, right with a lighter with a big lighter of be good just stick it in their real deep back to him

[02:31:55.050 --> 02:31:59.870]
5670560 pound five 60 maybe just singed it a little bit first on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:32:00.610 --> 02:32:03.050]
Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes

Is this you sounds like me? Oh man. It's a pleasure sounds like me or my twin brother

[02:32:21.210 --> 02:32:23.010]
I haven't spoke to you since 2000

[02:32:23.670 --> 02:32:27.830]
So I guess that doesn't make me too chronic. I wonder if I had a twin brother if you'd have good ball movements or not

[02:32:27.830 --> 02:32:32.330]
But anyway, go ahead sir. No, it's just you know what you're great. I love listening to you

[02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:35.370]
I've been listening to you. I've had the privilege lately to be out on the road and

You just make fun of them. You're very hilarious. There you go and you're the best man. Look at this is all that it's almost there 130 and there we go

[02:32:50.870 --> 02:32:53.590]
The hospital at UV lady giving you the nasty look

[02:32:54.190 --> 02:32:58.650]
I wouldn't say she was hostile, but she was just very ungrateful and the just you know

[02:32:58.650 --> 02:33:00.850]
She couldn't give a crap. It was the unbroward in public

[02:33:00.850 --> 02:33:05.570]
Oh, cuz you know, I just moved from day county to Broward and the difference is unbelievable people

[02:33:06.010 --> 02:33:09.990]
Maybe brutal and Broward, but compared to day county god. It's like a breath of fresh air

[02:33:09.990 --> 02:33:13.430]
Yeah, well day counties are foreign country you take your passport when you cross the border

[02:33:13.430 --> 02:33:16.230]
I have to show my passport of the turnpike thing every morning

[02:33:16.650 --> 02:33:20.290]
I hear you hey, I was wondering cuz you know I didn't have a touch. I was out of the state

[02:33:20.290 --> 02:33:24.130]

[02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:26.490]

[02:33:27.550 --> 02:33:27.870]
Correct

[02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:34.550]
That is part of a hilarious bit that I'm not playing the bird's center in no way. Yeah, you never play it

Well for those of us who heard it. It's still a good memory. Keep telling you that that. Thanks a lot, pal. Thanks for the suck job

[02:34:08.690 --> 02:34:10.130]
time I've seen it many many times

[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:10.910]
and

[02:34:12.350 --> 02:34:15.090]
It's the same thing. It's like they're bunch of stalkers

[02:34:16.310 --> 02:34:22.150]
And no matter how much you despise them how revolting they are you can't get rid of them. They just refuse to go away

[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:28.630]
So monkey man go play with somebody else's monkey. Okay get lost. I'm not reading your facts. Look at it your pictures

Time I get a chance the archives and everything

[02:40:10.030 --> 02:40:12.870]
Last week we got about the Reagan movie and CBS

[02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:18.550]
You know pandering and pulling it off they pulled it they pulled it. Yeah

[02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:23.450]
And that guy called you up. I never ripped you or anything never

[02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:28.470]
You're a best in radio, but it got me angry with that guy called up

[02:40:28.470 --> 02:40:30.770]
That you were a hypocrite now

[02:40:30.770 --> 02:40:35.510]
Oh, that was a crank that he was a kid. It's a chronic crank

[02:40:35.510 --> 02:40:40.310]
The condolence of that yeah, why you can't play it and you can't last week

[02:40:40.310 --> 02:40:44.590]
That's not even on your best of CDs right yeah put it on there. That is correct

[02:40:44.590 --> 02:40:48.770]
I thought QAM had nothing to do with your best stuff. They don't help you out or anything

[02:40:48.770 --> 02:40:52.910]
Say what you put on there. That is right. The in that particular case you're correct

[02:40:54.050 --> 02:40:58.370]
Well here's the clanchor see let me tell me try to explain something you and a lot of other people out there

[02:40:58.370 --> 02:40:59.550]
I think that life is so simple

[02:40:59.550 --> 02:41:02.150]
There are people I hate to break the news to you

[02:41:02.150 --> 02:41:07.270]
But there are people out there who would like to use things like that to try to attack this program

[02:41:07.270 --> 02:41:11.630]
My livelihood this radio station and we're not just gonna like hand it over to them say

[02:41:11.630 --> 02:41:16.970]
Oh, well here you go see how much damage you can do so you just like make this stuff go away if you have any brains at all

[02:41:16.970 --> 02:41:17.670]
Oh

[02:41:18.430 --> 02:41:21.710]
So if somebody theoretically I'm not playing me

[02:41:22.930 --> 02:41:30.230]
But if they had a copy of that they wanted to stick it on a file sharing program and spread it about that wouldn't be a good idea

[02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:32.910]
I don't know what do I care thing to do whatever the hell they want

[02:41:33.970 --> 02:41:34.370]
Oh

[02:41:34.970 --> 02:41:37.950]
Why are you so obsessed with that bit what what there is is a make

[02:41:38.630 --> 02:41:45.410]
It's just the principle behind it that you always say what's on your mind you don't back down

[02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:49.390]
Sir say there's a there's a difference though. Don't you understand? There's a difference it was

[02:41:49.390 --> 02:41:54.650]
I work I work for other people who pay my paycheck. Okay. I'm not a network

[02:41:54.650 --> 02:41:56.070]
I don't make decisions like that

[02:41:56.070 --> 02:42:00.310]
I work for other people and they had the final say on what's going to be on a radio station or not

[02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:02.070]
They own the license. Don't you see the difference?

[02:42:02.450 --> 02:42:07.670]
You're still the best in radio. Okay. Have a great day sir. Oh brother round and around and around and around

[02:42:53.330 --> 02:42:57.070]
I can hear you sir. Okay. A couple of things you

[02:42:57.070 --> 02:43:00.110]
As far as the cops would be in the school

[02:43:00.110 --> 02:43:06.710]
You remember the picture of a Nazi with a five year old kid holding a rifle to a kid in Germany. Yeah

[02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:10.870]
It's the same same kind of stuff the kids are laying it with his hands up

[02:43:10.870 --> 02:43:18.250]
All right, the second thing I wanted to talk about is the prisoners of war from the first Gulf war that were tortured

[02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:21.090]
They were pissed upon they were they were

[02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:26.790]
clicked up with the revolvers and everything and they were awarded money

[02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:33.390]
But however the Bush administration says we cannot release the frozen funds from the

[02:43:33.990 --> 02:43:38.890]
With the Iraqi funds because we needed to rebuild the rack right there's not beauty

[02:43:38.890 --> 02:43:43.670]
I just like those great veterans benefits who do such a good job on too

[02:43:43.670 --> 02:43:50.110]
Do you know I just I just donated to the JWV because the guy was standing with a cup. I don't give money to anybody

[02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:52.430]
They're all a ripple of fear Florida

[02:43:52.990 --> 02:43:55.810]
But but the point is they're they have to pay

[02:43:55.810 --> 02:44:00.390]
$8.1 as a combat veteran if they're in the hospital

[02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:05.710]
We're charging our veterans money to be wounded in the hospital right

[02:44:06.590 --> 02:44:10.190]
Unbelievable and we and until I came out of the news until a few weeks ago

[02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:13.150]
We were charging them for meals too. We were trying to pay for their own meals

[02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:14.450]
That's correct

[02:44:16.030 --> 02:44:20.550]

[02:45:39.070 --> 02:45:42.390]

Mars one of 17 and Italians only five

[02:46:53.410 --> 02:46:58.830]
And you want to know why to say Italians only five because they don't want to offend their Italian friends. You don't understand it don't you

[02:46:59.630 --> 02:47:04.310]

[02:47:58.010 --> 02:48:06.270]
But it tastes like tuna. The Jessica Simpsons. It's TV's first animated reality show with two-dimensional

[02:48:15.350 --> 02:48:19.350]
Be silly Jessica. Everybody knows buffalo wings are made from chicken

[02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:22.470]
Like chicken of the sea

[02:48:22.470 --> 02:48:28.530]

[02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.910]

Here's a call from Davie hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir

[02:48:54.910 --> 02:48:59.190]
You know you're about that caller last week, you know who's called you hypocrite. Yeah

[02:48:59.190 --> 02:49:03.330]
Yeah, you're just doing what your bosses are telling you to do and you know you don't lend a radio station

[02:49:03.330 --> 02:49:07.630]
But why do you criticize still Henry for you know for his views

For his views on what you could if that's so Henry for well

[02:49:11.110 --> 02:49:14.650]
Well, wait a minute. What what his views have to do with what that caller was talking about?

[02:49:14.770 --> 02:49:16.070]
He wasn't talking about my views

[02:49:18.930 --> 02:49:24.530]
Because I think he because I think he's sold out that's why because I he wanted answer to the question or not

[02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:27.950]
He wanted answer you just want to keep up up up up up up up up up up up. You don't want an answer

[02:49:27.950 --> 02:49:31.870]
So I'm not gonna waste my time. What what is the comparison between that?

[02:49:32.810 --> 02:49:36.490]

[02:50:04.690 --> 02:50:09.330]
Yeah, we have American kids who are dying every day in Iraq who should award that you've never been fought

[02:50:09.330 --> 02:50:14.670]
We got kids being threatened at gunpoint by a Gestapo stormtroopers in South Korea in our public school

[02:50:14.670 --> 02:50:18.910]
And you're worried about why the marlins haven't been to the White House? No, I don't really care

I thought you'd get a good laugh on knowing that um

[02:51:11.210 --> 02:51:15.250]
Do you you get men's health magazine? No, I sure don't only fags get that

[02:51:18.290 --> 02:51:23.010]
This latest edition lists highly in the top 25 best cities for men to live

[02:51:23.890 --> 02:51:27.110]
Are you kidding me? Yeah, but you got to get it just to check it out

[02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:29.470]
No, I would never buy that magazine. It's bad for my image

[02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:33.070]
Have a great day palae and push up a little will you sweetheart? There's a fact

[02:51:34.170 --> 02:51:39.450]
What you buy men's health magazine? No, of course not only only fags by that magazine

[02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:45.530]
I don't know why he's like I like naked pictures or something. I've never even I just know it's a fag mag

[02:51:47.710 --> 02:51:53.710]
It's a metrosexual publication. Oh, is that what it is? I forgot about that. That's how a dean said it's metrosexual

[02:51:55.830 --> 02:51:59.330]
Howard Dean, which was the way of saying I'm not a queen just by it because I do have a wife

[02:51:59.330 --> 02:52:03.290]
You know in a family just because I signed at the gay partner thing in Vermont see now

[02:52:03.290 --> 02:52:06.750]
Now I love Howard Dean, but that was such a stupid way. He got boxed in the corner

[02:52:06.750 --> 02:52:10.250]
And I because they replayed the debate over the weekend the rock the vote

[02:52:11.330 --> 02:52:16.270]
And when he's saying when they're back in the middle corner about the Confederate flag and he's appealing to the white

[02:52:16.270 --> 02:52:20.350]
Yahoo pickup truck driving voter in the south by saying that we want your vote

[02:52:20.350 --> 02:52:23.510]
And we want to get you into our tent and all and then he turns around say well

[02:52:23.510 --> 02:52:27.050]
I'm the only one on this platform who signed gay rights legislation for

[02:52:27.810 --> 02:52:33.910]
Partnerships and I'm thinking to myself. Oh, yeah, that's the thing. Oh roof is down there in Georgia with his doberman and his pickup truck

[02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:38.130]
And his is rebel flag on the back. He sure gonna come to you right now Howard

[02:52:39.330 --> 02:52:42.230]
Jesus tell me up a little bit about crap like that. Keep it a secret

[02:52:43.110 --> 02:52:43.470]
man

[02:52:44.270 --> 02:52:50.030]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT and T in Verizon and to show you how desperate

[02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:56.190]
John Kerry is number or no John Kerry fire to campaign manager and now what's his name John Edward from North Carolina

[02:52:56.190 --> 02:52:59.730]
Now he's bringing up the rebel flag thing again. He's he that's his only issue

[02:53:00.350 --> 02:53:01.610]
Bringing that back again

[02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:06.350]
As the Democrats do what they do the best try to like shoot each other in the foot and self-destruct

[02:53:07.950 --> 02:53:10.050]
Here's Hollywood. Hello

[02:53:10.590 --> 02:53:11.470]
Hello, yes, sir

[02:53:13.330 --> 02:53:14.530]
I'm doing all right

[02:53:15.850 --> 02:53:19.510]
Better than dolphin fans man. I'm doing a better than them. Yeah, that's the very sad

[02:53:19.510 --> 02:53:20.210]
What they saw

[02:53:21.270 --> 02:53:22.930]
We'll talk to you about the

[02:53:23.470 --> 02:53:30.190]
Another cell out weasel like like I front fiddle Henry now no, no, don't start segway with this last caller

[02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:34.590]
Okay, let's just stick to whatever you want to talk about these these people are playing a game today

[02:53:34.590 --> 02:53:36.610]
They all got a game they all got an agenda

[02:53:36.610 --> 02:53:37.570]
Yeah, the

[02:53:38.310 --> 02:53:40.390]
Congress and that issue are you sure

[02:53:41.710 --> 02:53:46.030]
The issue of the non-issue of paying for your meals in hospitals here

[02:53:46.030 --> 02:53:48.590]
And it's a non-issue because

[02:53:49.150 --> 02:53:54.270]
Military personnel who don't eat on a base get a check to get the meals

[02:53:54.270 --> 02:53:59.510]
And when they get the meals on the base while I get a hospital they're gonna give that money back

[02:53:59.510 --> 02:54:01.730]
That's all it is. It's wherever you are

[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:05.790]
And so and that's anybody in a hospital whether you're sick or

[02:54:06.590 --> 02:54:14.090]
In state-tider whatever but that of course the weasels and Congress grabbed a heart of it and said we're in a defend our military person now

[02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:18.650]
And those of them that don't get killed while we're gonna get in their meals pretty well really

[02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:22.290]
Well, I think that was an interesting thing those of them that don't get killed. That was the operative

[02:54:23.510 --> 02:54:28.050]
one very fat too that it is offered their dining every day man and they're dying for nothing

[02:54:28.050 --> 02:54:29.710]
They're dying for oil and for big business

[02:54:30.130 --> 02:54:33.870]
It's a sin and a pun in a public's worried about why the marlins aren't at the White House

[02:54:34.490 --> 02:54:39.050]
Yeah, in fact, I want maybe the marlins ought to be running the White House be a hell of a big improvement. Have a great day, Pally

[02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.950]
Two

[02:54:40.690 --> 02:54:43.270]
Yeah, maybe jack McKeehan ought to be running this country. What do you say?

[02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:45.370]
All right, let's go old jack, huh?

[02:54:46.110 --> 02:54:46.510]
He to man

[02:54:47.230 --> 02:54:52.950]
Instead of this ridiculous big dumb Oeared goofball is D&D guy dangerous and dumb

[02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:54.910]
Who's just a pawn?

[02:54:55.450 --> 02:55:00.130]
Yeah, Dick Cheney's the one. It's called a call mishatz. We have some good articles on the website last two three days

[02:55:00.910 --> 02:55:03.350]
About how this country is uh being run by dick

[02:55:05.230 --> 02:55:05.850]
It's right

[02:55:06.730 --> 02:55:08.150]
It's exactly what we got

[02:55:08.790 --> 02:55:12.690]
Dick with the bad ticker man. He's got E5 pacemaker and other dick in the White House

[02:55:12.690 --> 02:55:15.550]
That's what we got. I wonder if he spotted or not like the old spotted all

[02:55:17.370 --> 02:55:22.950]
567 05 60 pound 5 60. I hope you all had a good bomb moving over the weekend especially after those two football games

[02:55:22.950 --> 02:55:25.990]
Can you imagine put my mother's really uh, she's jealous

[02:55:26.690 --> 02:55:27.610]
She is jealous

[02:55:28.990 --> 02:55:34.870]
Because if there's one thing you could say about both performances by the heracune and the dolphins it was that that was it

[02:55:34.870 --> 02:55:36.690]
Heavy-duty unbelieveable

[02:55:37.170 --> 02:55:38.950]
Total and pure and unadulterated

[02:55:39.890 --> 02:55:42.090]
Said again. I love it

[02:55:42.090 --> 02:55:43.250]
And by the way, that's no

[02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:48.570]
22 till two don't forget you've got to get for real to bring me in a check tomorrow. You're laughing about it

[02:55:48.570 --> 02:55:52.410]
Just remind him he just keeps forgetting about he'll do it. He's not a cheap skater's he

[02:55:53.470 --> 02:55:58.090]
No, no, he's uh, he's a uh, in fact get him licked up a little bit give him some of them pills that George left you

[02:55:58.090 --> 02:55:59.830]
He might steal freight trance that point

[02:55:59.830 --> 02:56:03.650]
Yeah, yeah, good. Well, he can donate it to a pendant perescue. We'll sell it

[02:56:03.650 --> 02:56:08.050]
Well, potted we'll option off right on the street corner where Miguel's gonna be selling drugs tomorrow

[02:56:09.450 --> 02:56:15.170]
22 before a two already this has gone by fast today don't ask me why I never dreamed of the first part

[02:56:15.170 --> 02:56:19.890]
See of course there's two things number one. I have a work in this studio in a couple months and number two

[02:56:19.890 --> 02:56:22.130]
It's Monday morning, which means that the sports

[02:56:22.810 --> 02:56:26.230]
Aswells have been here all weekend long. George is always screaming about it too and rightfully so

[02:56:26.230 --> 02:56:29.170]
It's screwing with air with all this settings with everything

[02:56:29.890 --> 02:56:33.450]
Because this is like a playground for the sports nerds when we have a bunch of ball games on

[02:56:34.050 --> 02:56:35.090]
And we had a hurricane

[02:56:35.590 --> 02:56:38.610]
Game on we had a Panther game on sary night such as it was

[02:56:39.090 --> 02:56:41.590]
By the way, Scott Melon me we love you, but shut up already

[02:56:41.590 --> 02:56:45.490]
And then we hit the dolphin game on yesterday such as it was I think the dolphins missed the bus

[02:56:45.490 --> 02:56:47.790]
To the stadium in Tennessee, do they?

[02:56:48.530 --> 02:56:53.430]
So who is on the field the Miami women's auxiliary? What might as well have been? I mean seriously

[02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:56.610]
As you watch that game you I kept thinking to myself

[02:56:56.610 --> 02:57:00.590]
I see two different things. I see one team that's out there to try to win a football game

[02:57:00.590 --> 02:57:04.630]
And I see another team that's just like they're going through the motions. They they don't care

[02:57:06.050 --> 02:57:08.450]
My grandmother could attack on better than they were doing yesterday

[02:57:08.450 --> 02:57:13.250]
And I still say Tennessee could have scored at least a hundred points if they really would have you know put their nose to the grindstone

[02:57:13.250 --> 02:57:16.430]
But what why bother? I think they held up. Yeah, they held back

[02:57:16.430 --> 02:57:21.630]
I mean that was so piss poor and these people oh like Jeff Cohen

[02:57:21.630 --> 02:57:23.590]
I mean just a good guy, but he's another one of those fans

[02:57:23.590 --> 02:57:26.630]
You have to if you're going to be a real fan don't delude yourself

[02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:29.490]
You're hope for the best of course you like your team to win every game

[02:57:29.490 --> 02:57:33.350]
But but don't delude yourself in the thinking that your horseball team is great

[02:57:33.350 --> 02:57:37.750]
Oh, they're gonna turn around we're talking super boy now it happens in this town all the time

[02:57:37.750 --> 02:57:42.530]
Why can't you you can still be a fan and not bull crap yourself

[02:57:43.230 --> 02:57:46.310]
But that's what they do. Oh here we go. Let's hear it

[02:57:49.130 --> 02:57:50.910]
