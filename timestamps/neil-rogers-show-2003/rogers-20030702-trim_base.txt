[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]
Neil last night I filled two sessions you left

[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.920]
two

[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.480]
How those people in the ballpark were paid admission?

[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.160]
Every single one of them I gave them tickets and they spent a hundred bucks each drink and 13,073

[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.120]
Announce I just want to give you the challenge

[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.540]
I fill that one of them in one chance

[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.380]
They don't have here we go in here

[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.940]
One into one if they don't have 15,000 don't travel is putting tonight if they don't have at least 15,000

[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.320]
Then you're just farting in the windmill

[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.920]
I guarantee you tonight they'll have 30,000 fans for five hours

[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.380]
I thought you buy me bread now now what about the scene when they were

[00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.140]
When De Niro was in the opium room just sleeping and smoking opium for like a day

[00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.800]
Yeah, that was a great those opium and all those people went in there. They just slaps for two days

[00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.280]
Well, that's what they say the last scene is that the whole day movie was nothing but an opium trip

[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.240]
Well, I just spent four hours watching something that was just an opium brick, but it was still very entertained

[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.580]
Great great music great great. I think a re adaptation of New York now

[00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.500]
What about Magnolia did you see that because I wanted to get last night very strange movie? I did see it

[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.940]
Very different very unique very twisted. I have not seen your wreck. We a movie, but I love that

[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.400]
You're lucky a lot. It's all about the other thing I wanted to talk about the other sex

[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.680]
I really wanted to talk about why is it that they don't have the balls to put me on while you're on your

[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.160]
Whatever they call it's the badical Jesus Christ you work about two days a minute

[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.100]
I came up with a solution yesterday, which was the perfect idea

[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.800]
Listen to me you do a sports show, right?

[00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.600]
Show and sports once they always have a kid then that's what they're afraid of

[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.640]
Moza vacation for a solid week

[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.480]
You could be in there with guilty you could have slid right into this morning

[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.040]
You could be doing six to ten right now and then like Wally Pipp and Lou Gehrig

[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.960]
You just never give the globe

[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.180]
And you know, it's funny is that I was negotiating in New York to do a political show for four hours a day across America

[00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.340]
I probably would have been sued and fired within a month anyway, but the fact remains is that I didn't want to do sports

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.220]
I wanted to talk about the things that you talk about I can talk about politics all day and have every right wing

[00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.360]
Conservative super fine. You're gonna lose the license

[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.420]
If you want to license a motion, don't lose the license

[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.380]
I heard you saying that about me yesterday, too. Who are you kidding? I mean, I you say asshole 300 times to my one

[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.080]
There's nothing wrong with it. It's like a rectum's in mother afferves and you follow me when you follow Mo

[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.600]
You can say asshole all you want. You're on the station. It's simple. No one can argue with you

[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.940]
But I can tell you this much. I think you're way more high risk than me. I would. Why say some guy

[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.500]
I'll burn off of his dick

[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.600]
I'll buy a ball of you say okay. I'm not repeating your usage

[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.900]
You're crazy if you think I'm gonna cost him. I'm gonna push you to say that I've never once been fine

[00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.180]
I'm gonna spend it by the all the fascists at the FCC. Well, I'll let you find out what George because quite frankly

[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.080]
I don't have a crap who doesn't wonder I can't believe it don't have me feeling afraid

[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.100]
I mean you gotta have somebody that can carry deliver into the kitchen. I have the real story here

[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.340]
Now let's give the rest of the story you were you were jacking them for a few bucks extra for that now

[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.920]
Let's let's face it. They're too cheap to know the best deal in the world and so

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.800]
I am across the way extra cash

[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.500]
Yeah, like they don't have any extra cash

[00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.480]
I think I'm not gonna pay any out

[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.160]
Tag grex steals it and takes it home to his family. You got that right. Yeah, I know I do I

[00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.520]
Don't like any of those people good luck. You have a lousy day. Okay, see ya

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:29.020]
The mad dog is out of control and you'll find out why when you hear the latest release from blackpuster

[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.740]
Entertainment you maddened sings duets

[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:09.180]
Here's a mad dog

[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.660]
I

[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.860]
First Jim said he felt a little bit cool

[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.900]
Like a unit in a hole, but now he says I like it

[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:45.160]
I like the mad dog just can't kiss enough for that cottage cheese, but if he wants me to sing God bless America and face

[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.060]
He's in the G string up here. I'll do it

[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.120]
The mad dog sing himself happy

[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.440]
Oh

[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.140]
You maddened sings duets available now at all blockbuster stories

[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.380]
All I have to say about last night was this yeah

[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.700]
How do you like me now?

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.140]
Who's kidding who?

[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.200]
Take a good look at last night and this includes Neil Rogers a Neil up there in in fact city

[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.500]
Listen to me

[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.140]
How do you like me now?

[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.960]
I filled two sections full a ride whoa

[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.260]
See I they can pack the whole damn park every night just give the tickets away free

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.680]
Let's start giving away the parking for free. Oh, what do you say sounds good to me and a hot dogs and a hot fun Sundays

[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.360]
Sounds excellent. They to me. I'll go for that. He can't out shout me now because we don't have money here at this point

[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.220]
Well wait, I'll go get him, but we did find out something very very illuminating wasn't I right?

[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.140]
Our good friend for us a little bit upset over the fact that see look if you're gonna do something do it

[00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.900]
You know we do too much himming and hawing he's gonna fill in he's not gonna fill in and how many times of that change

[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.880]
Fuck third man. Yeah, and so finally we said we would do the line in the sand

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.840]
We said well they can't get that thing done and George is gonna do his thing, you know

[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.980]
We just got a respect not that we have a lot of respect for George, but just a little bit of respect

[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.920]
You know just out of common decency the guys been doing it for a few years now, and there's not a problem

[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.900]
And you notice how I didn't get a response about him back and up and doing the show with guilty

[00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.760]
I mean most on vacation this week. I'm nobody on this show is on vacation right now

[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:41.160]
Right, I mean, assuming and being a boy. We're we've got our full staff here right now

[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.020]
What about mobile and on vacation right?

[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.000]
Absolutely starting this morning makes all the sense in the world of me for well and guilty

[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.760]
I could have listened on the way into work. There you go Scott and Galdi and a morning two interesting voices a little bit of a contrast there

[00:06:54.760 --> 00:07:00.760]
Huh, but there's some I don't know what there is there's not even a crossover there at eight o'clock when guilty does the show like this morning

[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.800]
There's no crossover. There's no fun. There's no I don't know what that's all about

[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.160]
But I think it's just a perfect and I think that there's a little bit of paranoia there

[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.480]
You do understand that I may be exaggerating a bit

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.660]
A little bit of paranoia on somebody's part they're afraid that if Forell moves into the morning there with Galdi

[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:21.080]
And does that six to ten for a few days and it goes over bigger than Mary Taylor more that maybe somebody might not come back or maybe

[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.740]
Something come back and just do five to six like a warm-up power

[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.180]
Or maybe somebody come back and just do the updates

[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.580]
See what I'm saying. Yeah

[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:33.480]
So that seems to me to be the logical move is for Forell to have been filling there

[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:39.880]
But far be it for me. I'm not pulling the strings. We're very happy here doing 10-04 to two whatever it is when we find to get on

[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:46.620]
10-04 till two that's fine with me. I'm not looking into after all these years to you know branch out moving anybody else's territory

[00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.320]
Well, we're real happy being back in our time slot where we belong

[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.060]
So good luck, you Scott. I mean, you know again

[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.520]
I wish him all the luck in the world. He's dynamite. He's different. He's off the wall

[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.720]
But the fact that a matter is he's putting all of his eggs in a dead basket, okay?

[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.100]
And believe you me that's what mode told me there's nothing worse than having a dead basket

[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.880]
For this Marlem thing you can whip it and you can flagulate it and you can beat it in a 120 to one

[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.900]
I don't care if they want 200 to one the fact is that there isn't one more even though it's a front-running foany town

[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:23.320]
It came over 500 the fact of the matter is that there is a one more person that it gives a flying cramp about it

[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.580]
Than they did yesterday before they want 20 to one any more before they lost 25 the night of Boston last Friday

[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:34.200]
Nobody cares. You're trying to force feed something, okay? Good luck to you more power to you

[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:40.500]
We can wait till Panthers season starts and give away we can fill up I'm not saying fill up because most of them won't show up

[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.260]
But we can give away three sections full of tickets

[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.920]
See given away stuff for free and South Florida is not what I would call like a major accomplishment

[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:53.620]
You follow what I'm saying in the free loading capital of the entire globe. Don't take any crap you got for free

[00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.900]
Although you remember when you were trying to I know I take that back

[00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.180]
I give them all a credit in the world because remember you were trying to give away Marlem tickets at Treasure Island

[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.580]
Okay, I filled a Marlins

[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:09.320]
Couldn't do it yet. Yeah, let me tell you right now. You pull a crap. That's what you're full. Oh, you're full of crap

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:20.340]
Well, that's because you turned into a warehouse out there. That's fine. That's good

[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:26.780]
Free it fact let's announce it right now free sex for everybody at the Marlin game next time you're out there

[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.740]
There you go

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.140]
For else gonna service everybody

[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.480]
Line them up in the header. I'll do it with a smile. Maybe service with a smile

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.360]
Yeah, you know had a good time here this weekend. Let's say that

[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:45.880]
All those fags right here this weekend hundreds of the in fact I guarantee we had a hell of a lot more fags here this weekend

[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.660]
You've got people at the Marlin game all season long, but that's another story for another day

[00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.800]
He's listen. He's an optimist. He's trying real hard

[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:57.740]
He wants to make that the centerpiece of his life and the only thing he can open is that baseball seasons over real quick

[00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.860]
That that second half of the season just slides on by real fast and then we get to something we can really sink our teeth into it sound for a hockey

[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:08.880]
This is for trail by city

[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.840]
Oh god Neil

[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:20.740]
One is the total

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.480]
And inside of Marlin game

[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.260]
Oh

[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:33.040]
Three we'll make it to the one that's the total attendance at the mall in the blood

[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:47.320]
To my way to see your home run at the Marlin game

[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.340]
Ha ha ha

[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.120]
You might be the only one to get a stroke from the sun

[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:55.580]
The

[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.460]
To be there all alone and have yourself the whole play

[00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.420]
While you go for a walk and have a nice talk with the guy

[00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:17.880]
The

[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:31.680]
ball in the

[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.740]
So you notice there is that the hostility there because for all's not doing this 10 to 2 or

[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.840]
part of it during these summer months.

[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:02.840]
Did you hear that?

[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:04.040]
Yeah well.

[00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.660]
And what did I tell you before the show because he's not coming in there and bonding with

[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.660]
you guys in the morning anymore?

[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.700]
He's eating out in a hallway.

[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:13.860]
In fact, he's eating in his studio which Clarence said he's going to go in there and just

[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.540]
beat the crap out of him which was rather amusing.

[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:16.660]
Nice going Clarence.

[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:17.380]
Give it a good shot.

[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.780]
So sir, I can't be there to see all these interesting battles going on.

[00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:24.400]
Missing all the fun.

[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.920]
Here's the poll result from yesterday which actor actress would cause you absolutely not

[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.060]
to see a movie that they're in.

[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:35.820]
1414 votes, pretty good response considering nobody's in town.

[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.940]
Ed Norton and Jean Gershon didn't have any.

[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.960]
See what's the point of people calling them in and then they don't even get one vote.

[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:42.800]
They get to call.

[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.500]
Oh, well that's good.

[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.000]
We like that.

[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:46.840]
Actually, we did have a lot of call.

[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.000]
Wippy Goldberg beat everybody hands down your pants.

[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:54.020]
173 don't want to be making Wippy or seeing Wippy they don't want no potter Wippy cushion

[00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.300]
okay.

[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.380]
They cannot stand looking at that bitch and I agree.

[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.800]
Barbara Streisand, 114.

[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:01.200]
Oh you know something she's going to be on today's poll.

[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:01.980]
I forgot about her.

[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.360]
But she'll be on there.

[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:04.100]
What will we get to that?

[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:09.880]
Pauli Shore 98 Leo to Caprio 96 they don't come more macho than Leo.

[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:11.840]
Spike Lee 81.

[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.340]
Jean Clog God damn 60.

[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:15.600]
Adam Sandler 59.

[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.480]
Ted with Will Smith.

[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:17.900]
That's a good match right there.

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.620]
It's hard to separate that pair.

[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.660]
It's like clearance in the beast.

[00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.460]
Hard to separate him.

[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.940]
Adam Sandler will Smith.

[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.040]
He said 59 votes up.

[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:24.660]
Noxious.

[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.760]
Slice the lone 53.

[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.040]
Steven Seagal 45.

[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.320]
Sandra Pollock 38.

[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.200]
Now I think George who was out sick yesterday.

[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.080]
You'd agree with me that's unusual in cruel punishment.

[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.560]
Right.

[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.560]
What's wrong with her?

[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.380]
I don't know.

[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.640]
Isn't a lot of crappy movies but it's not her fault.

[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.620]
I mean she's cute.

[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.340]
I mean maybe she's a little bit too cutesy.

[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.300]
I don't know.

[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:47.860]
I actually never chose her breasts so maybe for those people that have a problem with that.

[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:48.500]
Yeah.

[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:51.040]
While Madonna shows her breasts anybody want to see her.

[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.420]
No, no, no.

[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:51.960]
I don't think so.

[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:52.800]
All the let's see.

[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.480]
She was a late addition on here.

[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.060]
Wasn't she or do we never put her on here?

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.460]
We never put that bitch on here.

[00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.460]
She's a better bender boy.

[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.580]
How could we have done that?

[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:04.480]
We missed Madonna.

[00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:05.580]
Somebody called it in.

[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.600]
Actually somebody just called it right now to say that.

[00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.440]
Well we apologize profusely.

[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:11.660]
Okay.

[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:12.260]
We screwed up.

[00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.360]
Nobody's perfect.

[00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:13.640]
All right.

[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.900]
It probably was a errors fault.

[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.440]
Jennifer Lopez 37.

[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:18.920]
Patrick Sleazy 35.

[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.000]
The rock 33.

[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.740]
Julia Roberts 25.

[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.580]
Another one that I'm a little.

[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:26.820]
Now see that's become it's become invoked to hate Julia Roberts.

[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.020]
Right.

[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.440]
Become very fashionable.

[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.560]
I think she's fine.

[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:32.960]
She's just I mean personally she may be obnoxious disgusting

[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.900]
screwed up bitch.

[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:34.880]
But then again, who isn't?

[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:35.160]
Okay.

[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.840]
And air drop of it was a good movie.

[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.840]
And sleeping with the enemy was an excellent movie, right?

[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:42.140]
I thought her performance in that movie was fabulous.

[00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.140]
Nothing wrong with that.

[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.960]
Robert Downey Jr. 24 Martin Lawrence 24 Mickey work 21.

[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.640]
Sorry Mickey.

[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.580]
They don't like it too much.

[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.660]
John Vulton can't or Reeves each had 20.

[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.160]
Kevin Costner 19.

[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.620]
He should have had more than that.

[00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.780]
He is coma inducing John Redder 17.

[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.000]
Chakaston 17.

[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.900]

Melody Griffith 15.

[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.400]
Bruce Willis 14.

[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.240]
Should have done better Richard gear 14.

[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:09.120]
Same person.

[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:11.700]
Are they Charles Groten was a late edition did 13.

[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:12.920]
He should have had more than that.

[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.580]
Ted Danson 13.

[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.220]
Now you can straighten that out.

[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.740]
Ted Danson was going with whoopee Gulberg.

[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:18.560]
That's for real, right?

[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.160]
Yeah.

[00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.720]
Once upon a time right.

[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:21.700]
He never boy didn't believe that.

[00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:24.120]
Was it him or was he or the beast didn't want to believe that?

[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.740]
The beast.

[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.060]
On a beast by the way that was a good spot.

[00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:29.240]
He did that last break on for real show.

[00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.120]
That was a good spot.

[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.980]
I didn't know he had it in him.

[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:32.740]
It sounded pretty good.

[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.120]
It sounded like you that usual amateur hour let usually those way screams too much.

[00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:38.420]
But we're going to get the beast back on balance for life.

[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.260]
That's the good news.

[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.140]
Being a man of my word that I am.

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.720]
I told Troy the boy this morning tourist.

[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.360]
I forgot to back under that fat tub.

[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.380]
Give him one more shot.

[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:45.860]
Okay.

[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:46.440]
One more shot.

[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:47.440]
For Tubby.

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:48.980]
Try to save his life.

[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.240]
Rosie Perez and Mel Gibson each had 12.

[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.480]
McColley Culkin and Jeff Goldblum 10.

[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.460]
Ever see the two of them together?

[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.960]
Sally Fields and EGRC each had nine.

[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.180]
Michael Paray had eight.

[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.540]
You stuck that on there before you left.

[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:04.460]
Right.

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.820]
He hasn't done anything that anyone would notice in a long time.

[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:07.440]
Yeah.

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.380]
And there's a reason for that.

[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.100]
Oh.

[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.560]
He's been making a lot of B movies lately.

[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:13.980]
Eddie and Acruzion was hardly an A movie.

[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.700]
Well what A movie did he ever make?

[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.540]
Eddie and Acruzion's.

[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.060]
That was not an A movie.

[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:19.180]
It was a cult classic.

[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.080]
What?

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.840]
Rob Schneider, Chris Rock and Tom Hanks each have seven.

[00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.200]
Eddie Murphy and Meg Ryan, six.

[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:25.980]
Christian Slater, one of your least favorites

[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.360]
in Matthew McGonay, he had five.

[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.760]
Nicholas and the cage four.

[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.280]
Haley Joel Osmond, three.

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]
Donnie Osmond was not here.

[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.140]
Eric Roberts and Brendan Fraser and Kurt Russell, two apiece.

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:36.300]
Clint Eastwood, Samuely and Ashley Judd, each had one.

[00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.100]
That's it out of over 1400 votes.

[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.800]
People who would prevent you for ever seeing a movie.

[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.920]
And sometimes you do that and you make a bad mistake.

[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.900]
You miss that on a really good flick

[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:46.120]
because you have that pre-puse prejudice.

[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:46.440]
Sure.

[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.040]
Like the Burt Rettled thing in Boogie Nights.

[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:48.560]
Who to thunk it?

[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.580]
Well, yeah, but he was good in deliverance.

[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:51.080]
Yeah.

[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:51.880]
That's one.

[00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:53.920]
You wouldn't not watch deliverance

[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.660]
because Burt Reynolds was a well-known woman.

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:56.600]
No, it's a good thing I saw deliverance

[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.340]
before I hated him.

[00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:58.900]
How can you explain something to me?

[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.240]
Why don't we have these calls on here?

[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.740]
Here's Sonny Isles.

[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.000]
Hello.

[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:02.920]
Neil.

[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:03.700]
Yes, sir.

[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.760]
Hey, I watched Recklingham for a dream last night.

[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.980]
One word for the movie, disturbing.

[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.100]
Wow, awesome.

[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:10.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.560]
They got a good website.

[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:16.020]
I got a good movie on Columbia House.

[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:16.560]
Right.

[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:18.460]
And it was amazing.

[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:20.100]
It was a nice little hind shirt and a two.

[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.540]
And Recklingham had a good website.

[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.560]
You want to check it out.

[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:24.280]
OK.

[00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:25.300]
So I'll have a go.

[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:27.140]
What's another movie you guys are talking about?

[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:28.220]
It's similar to this one.

[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.140]
Magnolia.

[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.220]
Yes, there was another one too.

[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:33.580]
Memento?

[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.840]
Yeah, that's it.

[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.560]
Thanks for the lot, boy.

[00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.120]
You have a good one.

[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.900]
OK, enjoy it.

[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:37.780]
See what we're doing.

[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:39.400]
And I noticed for real, was talking

[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.860]
with me about movies a little bit there at the end.

[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.660]
He agreed once upon a time in America was great.

[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.020]
And Magnolia, although I didn't think he'd like Magnolia that much,

[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.280]
he said it was interesting.

[00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:49.440]
You know, if he eats somebody's food and you say,

[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.200]
oh, how did you like it?

[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.280]
Oh, it was interesting.

[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:51.860]
Here it is.

[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:52.700]
Yeah.

[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.520]
Magnolia was great.

[00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:55.680]
I watched it again last night.

[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:56.780]
Don't worry about the Easter eggs.

[00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.740]
And it's not a big deal.

[00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:58.920]
Somebody called about that yesterday.

[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.160]
And it's not any eight minutes.

[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:03.420]
It's like maybe three or four minutes.

[00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.480]
And it's it's OK.

[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.000]
I mean, there are a couple of flubs and tom Cruise

[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.140]
cracks up a couple of times.

[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.300]
If that turns you on great, OK?

[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.980]
But the Easter eggs aren't really worth the effort.

[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.980]
But Magnolia is the best movie ever made.

[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.400]
It's not a debatable point.

[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:17.580]
There's no question about it.

[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.260]
You can go scene by every scene in that movie.

[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.420]
And it's over three hours long.

[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.240]
Every scene is classic.

[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.220]
Do you know what I mean by that?

[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:26.520]
I'm not debating it.

[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.340]
No, no, I'm just telling you, every scene in that movie

[00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:30.740]
is a classic, right?

[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.200]
Every character in there, every acting performance is spellbinding.

[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.860]
Is that debatable?

[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.260]
Nope.

[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:45.840]
From the cop to what's his name who croaked?

[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:57.860]
It's not what you thought when you first began.

[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:02.000]
I said and watched that.

[00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.220]
When that scene comes on, I watched that so intently.

[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.060]
You know, because it's just so brilliantly shot.

[00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:06.980]
Yes.

[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.900]
And then when the spaz, the young wife is in a car just,

[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.700]
she's almost in a coma from drugs and booze.

[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.640]
And she's singing a song.

[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:18.820]
And what's his name?

[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:19.840]
They're old Ed Partridge.

[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.700]
Isn't that his name in a movie?

[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.360]
I don't know.

[00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.780]
Whatever the hell his name is.

[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:25.060]
He's lying there on his deathbed with a tube in his nose.

[00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:26.040]
And his lips are moving.

[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.900]
He's singing the song.

[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.220]
They're all singing it.

[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.120]
Oh, one of the outtakes.

[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.460]
Earl, Earl Partridge.

[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.380]
Earl Partridge, sorry.

[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.320]
You got him confused with Danny Partridge.

[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.340]
One of the outtakes was the cop.

[00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:39.060]
You know, when they show him sitting on the bed

[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.560]
and he's doing his part singing the song

[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:45.100]
and that whole montage there, they go to the bed.

[00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.000]
And it's really dark.

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.000]
And like the camera's panning around.

[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:49.240]
So it's right to find him.

[00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:51.720]
And he's on a bed faced out with his pants down.

[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.640]
He's moaning in the camera.

[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:54.440]
And everybody just cracks up and goes nuts.

[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.980]
It's, you had to be there to see it.

[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.180]
Be here, yeah, something that the clearance probably would like.

[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.380]
1026 at 560 QIM.

[00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:01.900]
560 QIM.

[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.620]
And look off.

[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.820]
This is 420560 QIM.

[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.240]
Hey, Ferrell.

[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.480]
By the way, sir.

[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:12.980]
I've been given it some stuff.

[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:13.560]
See?

[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.440]
Oh, what do you think of this?

[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:19.740]
I know that me and you can do much better.

[00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.680]
Go in 6 to 10 and not in 5.

[00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.940]
A Gentile in the Frankie Jew.

[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:28.900]
I think we might be happy to get there.

[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.220]
I think you really got out of your mind.

[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.520]
You got to have your weary bed.

[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.000]
Snap down to tight.

[00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:40.480]
No chance I'll always show it to you.

[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.900]
I'd rather die.

[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.780]
We'd be crappy together.

[00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:51.240]
Why, I'll help you know that I'm a big mafia Jew

[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.160]
from Brooklyn High.

[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.780]
I've been raped by everybody but you.

[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:00.880]
You're not my type.

[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.460]
Me and Mo, this snack would blow.

[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.760]
No way that if we had a fight,

[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.300]
that you'd survive,

[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.580]
who'd wanna hear a Gentile

[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.040]
and push it like that's crappy together.

[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:14.740]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:18.680]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.020]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:22.880]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.400]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:29.300]
I'm a Gentile.

[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.860]
And so would you and me for me

[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.760]
is much better 6 to 10 than 5.

[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.520]
It's only right that I should get more sleep than night.

[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.600]
I think we might be happy take a day.

[00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:46.860]
Snap.

[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.460]
SCREAM

[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.200]
I have to get there.

[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.620]
What, what, what, what?

[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.820]
What can be the night?

[00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.780]
What, what, what?

[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.240]
What, what, what?

[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.500]
What, what, what?

[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.120]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.840]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.280]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.040]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:07.900]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.640]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.940]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:15.220]
What, what, what, what?

[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.540]
What, what, what?

[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.700]
What, what?

[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:19.860]
1032-560 W.

[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.940]
So let me just set the record straight on one thing.

[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.820]
Okay. And of course, when we do that crossover,

[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.600]
I might as well just sit here and like, listen,

[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:27.340]
and make a few betterable sounds,

[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.900]
because once he gets, once he gets going,

[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.400]
there's no interjecting, you'll be like,

[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.240]
like that.

[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:36.160]
But when the first suggestion was made to all of us on the show

[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.000]
about him like picking up the slack on some of the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday

[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.400]
in the summertime, what was the response?

[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:41.540]
Great.

[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:42.720]
I'm like,

[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:42.940]
I'm like,

[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:43.220]
Oh, yeah.

[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:43.660]
That's good.

[00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.320]
Sounds good to me.

[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.360]
And then they dittled around and dicked around,

[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.540]
and while Greg says this,

[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.600]
and for outside that,

[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:50.020]
and maybe he doesn't want to do it,

[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:50.640]
and maybe they misunderstood.

[00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.200]
In fact, didn't he on this show say that he only wanted to come on on Friday?

[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:54.700]
Right.

[00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:54.960]
And he said,

[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:55.220]

[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:55.520]

[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:55.720]
Right.

[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:56.360]
And he said,

[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:56.360]

[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:57.320]
And he said,

[00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:58.060]
Right.

[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:03.380]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.320]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:10.640]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.040]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.040]

[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.040]

[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:11.520]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.840]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:20.860]

And he said, Right.

[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:21.500]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.600]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.160]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.040]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.980]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:27.900]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.300]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.240]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.040]

And he said, Right.

[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:34.740]

[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:35.680]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.100]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.380]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:37.740]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:38.300]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:38.480]

[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:41.500]
And he said, Right.

[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:41.500]

[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:41.500]

[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:41.500]

And he said, Right.

[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.320]

[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.980]
thing that's basically all no no no see I get this all the time about how negative I am

[00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.220]
know it's the people of South Florida who are negative it won't support anything

[00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.520]
don't look at me I tried getting people out tomorrow games I tried given yeah well

[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.540]
you know something you in this life you have to learn your lesson you have to

[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.440]
stop beating the dead horse and have a great day okay plus we don't want to talk

[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:34.960]
to people over the age of a hundred which is basically yeah I don't want to get

[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:39.480]
into it yeah why are you so negative I'm not negative it's the people of this

[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.720]
that area that are so freaking negative because I notice that every time he gets

[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:47.380]
into one of these tyrants it's also well also for Neil Roger as if I'm the

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:51.080]
reason this sounds like John Henry all over again you know what I mean yeah

[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.260]
if the Arrogers would just be more enthusiastic then we get some people out here

[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:58.780]
right first I have a set morning show with Chuck Meyer that's right that was

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.560]
when it started when I screwed up the Chuck Meyer morning show on IOD and

[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.660]
since then I have a relentless I haven't stopped being a real prick I have no

[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.140]
problem with I mean and the interesting part of it is to have listened to

[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.140]
about all the screaming in the Ellen on this station about David Samson and

[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.880]
Delilah and all of this other crap about the ownership and about what a

[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.120]
bunch of jerks they are and then all of a sudden they get out one a few games

[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:22.760]
and we got a new guy on the block who's you know the for whatever reason hitch

[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:28.100]
to start away to a dead situation now all of a sudden everybody's going to

[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.500]
care about the freaking Marlins every time we take a poll on the show we could do

[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.080]
it again today but I'm not gonna waste my time the interest is minimal to

[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.420]
non-existent oh sure there's a bunch of people watching for free on TV just

[00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:43.700]
like that crap about Don Trell will us oh my god he's gonna be the hottest

[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.380]
draw and mad dogs on earth are going on about and every time he was on the TV

[00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.060]
ratings went up because you can sit there at home and watch it for free that

[00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.080]
doesn't mean getting off your ass and spending a few bucks it's the most

[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.380]
inexpensive sports ticket in town maybe if it's for free and maybe if you'll

[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.980]
give us a park and pass and maybe if you'll feed us and maybe if you'll put

[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:06.220]
on a goddamn porno show there and have a few strippers out there maybe we'll

[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.260]
show up if we're in the right mood and the moon isn't right in Uranus maybe I

[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:14.680]
didn't just arrive on a scene baby I've been around a long time in this town

[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.260]
okay and I've seen people beat their heads against the wall trying to promote

[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:22.180]
it's almost impossible even a couple years ago when a panthers had a big

[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.200]
year whatever the hell it was was how many years ago yeah when I had their best

[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.480]
home season it had been we had like one or two sellouts the whole season the

[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:33.980]
whole goddamn year and they had a phenomenal home market it was like about

[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:39.220]
three years ago and you can get on there and just waste your air time and then

[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.700]
the fact of the matter is all you're doing is tuning people out because the

[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.960]
majority of the people don't care about these things okay you can't force

[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.400]
feed stuff that people are all care about it what was number three on the list

[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.060]
two days ago when we did the poll about things that people don't ever want to

[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.680]
hear on this show sports was number one hockey was number three I rest my case

[00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:00.020]
we didn't even waste their time putting the marlins on there there would have been

[00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:05.860]

Floridians done

[00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.120]
She's a burned up big mouth.

[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.820]
Cheryl's grow is a worn out height.

[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.440]
Just shine and fight hold.

[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.740]
Cheryl's grow is a white and a white home.

[00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.760]
She's a Malays loser.

[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:07.240]
Every day you can hear her whine.

[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.920]
I wish somebody could.

[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.180]
1047 and 560 WKM.

[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:17.320]
I thought that I forgot about Hillary, didn't you?

[00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:19.120]
I was hoping to pray.

[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.540]
No, it's not going to bite the chicken.

[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.900]
Just a couple of sentences here.

[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.820]
Oh, and also I hit the jackpot.

[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.540]
I was going to vote for Jerry Seinfeld and I looked at that thing and I thought, no, he's dripping with it.

[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.780]
New York, Jewie kind of look.

[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.180]
But nobody comes close to Fran Drescher.

[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:34.640]
So I voted for him.

[00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.860]
And we're going to choose just a drawn away from the packs.

[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.220]
He's already got 26 votes.

[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:39.460]
Man.

[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.700]
In fact, the ADL and the JDL and everybody else should be protesting against the reruns of that show.

[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:46.560]
That's not still on it.

[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:47.460]
I'm sure it's long gone.

[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.440]
In syndication.

[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:48.920]
Ooh.

[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:50.760]
Rosie Perez.

[00:34:52.740 --> 00:35:00.060]
When you stop, when you stop with that fixed stuff, Hillary writes, my sister is, see, it's truly off here.

[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:00.880]
My mother's sister.

[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:02.280]
Yamama.

[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.260]
My mother's sister is a bell was born in 1924.

[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.160]
The girls were often shuttled from one relative to another and from school to school.

[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.500]
Never sit saying anywhere long enough to make friends.

[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.220]
Maybe that's when she got the roots for her ice princess routine.

[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.380]
In 1927, my mother's young parents finally got a divorce.

[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.140]
Wearing those days in a terrible shame.

[00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:26.200]
Neither was willing to care for their children so they sent their daughters from Chicago by train to live with their paternal grandparents in Alhambra,

[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.720]
a town near the San Gabriel Mountains east of Los Angeles.

[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.420]
On the four-day journey, eight-year-old Dorothy was in charge of her three-year-old sister.

[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:36.720]
End of today's reading from the Hillary book called Living History by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:37.800]
It is terminal.

[00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.700]
It is ponderous.

[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.020]
I think I'm doing a big service there, okay?

[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.120]
I'm almost through two pages.

[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:43.980]
I hate you.

[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.600]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:52.280]
And regardless of what you're at, stress to peddilya, go see Magnolia.

[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.280]
Go get it, go win it, or buy the DVD.

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.520]
It's well worth it. It's one of the great movies of all time.

[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.700]
Even though you're not satisfied with the ending.

[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:03.600]
Which I still find it bizarre that you like the ending and once upon a time in America, that was okay.

[00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.880]
I didn't say I liked it.

[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:05.200]
Oh.

[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.620]
Well, after four hours it had it had it end eventually.

[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.140]
Right. I'm just glad to be released.

[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.760]
Oh, God.

[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.240]
It had it end soon or later in this case.

[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.660]
Although they were kind enough to put an intermission down there.

[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:18.640]
Although, that's funny.

[00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.940]
The intermission is on this.

[00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:22.680]
It's in the middle of this too on the CD set.

[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.880]
What do they do that?

[00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:25.700]
What? Just so you don't miss it.

[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.400]
Well, I hate to break the news to you, Mr. Hodge.

[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.240]
But in Godfather, there was an intermission in Godfather too.

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.380]

[00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:30.640]
I know.

[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.400]
And gone with the wind.

[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.280]
Go on with the wind.

[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:33.940]
There you are.

[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.820]
Because people got to go pee.

[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:37.020]
You know, they got to go do the stuff.

[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.760]
Plus they want you to go out and buy a bunch of crap to rot your teeth with too.

[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:40.760]
They want your money.

[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.500]
56670560, pound 560.

[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.820]
Neil, can't you be a little bit more positive?

[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:50.340]
Can't you be one of the front-running phonies like the rest of us here?

[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.080]
Here's Boyton V.

[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:53.440]
Hello.

[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:54.940]
Neil.

[00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:55.800]
Yes, sir.

[00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:59.640]
Can we add Jackie Mason to the list?

[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:00.920]
Yes, we certainly can.

[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:02.300]
We can add Jackie Mason.

[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:03.940]
He's one of those very obnoxious.

[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:08.160]
Neil, have you seen, we all hate Leo.

[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:09.940]
Have you seen gangs of New York?

[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:11.580]
Is he in it?

[00:37:12.260 --> 00:37:13.080]
He's in it, but that's the idea.

[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.220]
Why would you ask if I've seen it?

[00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:16.920]
If he's in it, I ain't seen it.

[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.380]
Well, Daniel Day Lewis is awesome in that movie.

[00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:20.140]
Yeah.

[00:37:20.460 --> 00:37:21.620]
It's worth it just to watch it.

[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:22.820]
I'll take your word for it.

[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:25.500]
And you get to watch Leo get his face feet in, so it's worth it.

[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.100]
Oh, like I said, I'm thinking about it.

[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.520]
Okay, thanks for the good news, Palli.

[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.020]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:29.740]
Have a great day.

[00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.520]
Okay, have a great, in fact, have you ever seen Jackie Mason and Mo together?

[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:32.800]
No.

[00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.800]
No, something to think about.

[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.100]
They both have that same kind of pedantic sound, right?

[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.520]
I could tell you something about Mo, but I don't want to go into it on the year here today.

[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.880]
I want to have a nice pleasant last couple of days before my summer schedule starts.

[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.380]
I could go into that thing, but I won't for right now for the moment.

[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.300]
Mo talk about paranoid and delusional and psychotic and just a real piece of dirt.

[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.520]
Even for Alice Moring, didn't you about you didn't hear it?

[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.520]
Because you don't listen to Q.A.M. shame on you.

[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:58.880]
How about you, Venerboy heard it?

[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.440]
Did you hear the part where Scott was talking about how the atmosphere in the building went?

[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.340]
He says, I love Mo, but, but.

[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.840]
And then he went through the thing about how everybody would, when Mo is there,

[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.880]
it's like when a school teachers around, everybody's walking on eggshells,

[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.540]
it has to be on their best behavior, which I think was a very kind way of saying that everybody hates them like poison, which he's already said.

[00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.400]
Yeah, and his comments will get worse.

[00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:22.760]
And it's absolutely true.

[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.000]
I mean, the week that I was down here, because I only saw Mo in passing a couple of times, like two ships in the night.

[00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.860]
Oh, I thought that a big celebrity like you would be driven to work in us limo every day.

[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.400]
Yeah, that kind of crap.

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.700]
But at any rate, I only saw him like for a few seconds, which I could handle.

[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.440]
But the rest of the time, it was like a party atmosphere in a whole building.

[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:50.220]
So for while not only the audience love his act, but also the, he's got all of that tremendous positive vibe because he's not Mo.

[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:52.280]
See what I'm saying? He's got like a double whammy there.

[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:53.540]
He can't miss.

[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.720]
Even though he would like to do this show starting next Monday.

[00:38:58.360 --> 00:38:59.100]
Take a check this out.

[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.700]
Wow, that's that flush.

[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:04.900]
Nanny.

[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:09.760]
Oh, it's on now somewhere.

[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:10.720]
Yeah, lifetime.

[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:12.680]
Oh, geez.

[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.920]
I hate that bitch in that show.

[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.280]
Now look at.

[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:19.220]
Tody.

[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:20.980]
See her name was spelled.

[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:21.380]
She's dead.

[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.340]
First of all, she hasn't been on her walk.

[00:39:23.460 --> 00:39:23.920]
She's dead.

[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:26.860]
Tody was TOT and Scott TOT.

[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.660]
Well, she was like a big fat boofo toad.

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.700]
Tody feels she's dead and so are Jessica Parker.

[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.880]
And then you stop with that.

[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.860]
Here's one that says how about Ricky Tiki Martin.

[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:40.080]
I don't know.

[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:42.000]
I think he's fooling a lot of stupid women out there.

[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:42.380]
Don't you?

[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:43.800]
Oh,

[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.940]
a real type of he representing.

[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:47.660]
Thank.

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.180]
Oh, are they talking about spick?

[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.100]
I don't know.

[00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:52.280]
There were go other time.

[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.660]
No, no, no, no.

[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.200]
No, in fact, if you wanted to put somebody dead on there, how about Desi Arnez?

[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.300]
All right.

[00:39:58.900 --> 00:39:59.340]
Lucy.

[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.520]
I mean, he let's put him on there.

[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:01.800]
Okay.

[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.420]
Well, there's an ugly stereotype.

[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.620]
He was an accurate stereotype.

[00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:04.920]
No, no.

[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:06.560]
Oh, were you stopped?

[00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:07.180]
What?

[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.960]
Oh, that's how that's how Cubans are like Desi Arnez.

[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.620]
I had to choose.

[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:15.480]
I mean, they're not all band leaders.

[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:18.740]
And cognitive on players, but they don't like that.

[00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.460]
They dress like that.

[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.920]
I heard that story about the band leader.

[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.980]
They're like Andy Garcia.

[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.700]
They'll beat up their wives.

[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.140]
And I want Desi Arnez on the list.

[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:28.420]
Okay.

[00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:29.740]
I think he'll get a lot of votes.

[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:30.360]
Lucy.

[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.900]
Lucy, I mean, come on.

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.880]
Let's see Charles Berkeley.

[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.800]
Yeah, but Charles Berkeley is, well, he's a ball player.

[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.640]
And we don't want to put athletes on there.

[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.580]
Says, hey, Scott Farrell, time will tell.

[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.340]
Time will tell.

[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.180]
Neil is God Scott.

[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.260]
Whatever that means.

[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.520]
He has goldie took a shot at most ages this morning.

[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.120]
I wish I had that.

[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.740]
Oh, when I love to hear that.

[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.240]
How old did he say he was?

[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.280]
About 30, man.

[00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:57.880]
Times three.

[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:00.120]
Man, oh, man.

[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:02.300]
She's some good stuff is going on.

[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:03.660]
I was getting really juicy at QM.

[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.460]
This is what the audience can stick their teeth into.

[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.020]
They love it.

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.740]
They like it a lot.

[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.720]
Even though, of course, somebody is on vacation.

[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:12.520]
And he's very indignant that you should say this.

[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.340]
And you should say that.

[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:13.940]
And then, blah, blah, blah.

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.840]
Friend Reshers got 37.

[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.040]
Eddie Murphy's got 11.

[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.560]
Jim J Bullock 9 screamer.

[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.440]
Now, I was going to put Charles Nelson Raleon there,

[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.740]
but he we don't see him anymore except on a match game.

[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.240]
Not alone.

[00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:28.560]
No, but we don't see Desi Arnez except that reruns

[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.880]
because he's been dead for about 20 years.

[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.240]
Yeah, but let's put Charles Nelson Raleon there.

[00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:33.260]
We're going to have a few fags.

[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:38.120]
Because that's generally what the media does best is represent all minorities

[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:39.860]
with the ugliest, most stereotypical.

[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.440]
In fact, Hollywood squares, which we mentioned the other day,

[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.700]
always had to have either Paul Lind or some other really fruity guy

[00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.360]
in a center square.

[00:41:46.460 --> 00:41:47.000]
Now, don't get me wrong.

[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.560]
I love Paul Lindy.

[00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.480]
But he was a real food cake.

[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.280]
Who's some of the other screamer?

[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.500]
Oh, and then they had that jackass from the advocate Bruce.

[00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.580]
What else is his name?

[00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:56.300]
The Lanch.

[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.380]
Bruce Velland.

[00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.400]
Oh, my God.

[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:01.440]
I want to go back in a closet when I see that queen on there

[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.120]
with a blonde wig and a whole deal.

[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:07.860]
He, I think he and the freaky Carlos to make a great pair of those two.

[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.080]
Maybe they'll all look.

[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.760]
We put him on there, but I don't think anybody knows who's that.

[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:14.280]
Who's that?

[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:14.820]
No, they don't.

[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.460]

stage of India throughout the country.

[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.860]
Plus staking this twice or three Shakespeare sponsorship off

[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:11.000]
of Kimmelwood on the stage ofoming concert,

[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.360]
Also, you have to add Andrew Dice Clay

[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:19.560]
Okay, whatever what stereotype does he know whatever one I'm not putting him on it. What stereotype?

[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:27.880]
Ginnies no forget about him. Oh here you go Carol O'Connor all in the family no

[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:35.200]
You think no, I mean while he's a stereotypical

[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.680]
Britain big it but you know and JJ Walker

[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:44.600]
I don't think either one of them qualify for list all over JJ was a little bit a little bit the top five six seven oh five sixty

[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:49.300]
pound five sixty on the 18 and team for rise and wireless line. How much do you care about the Marlins?

[00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.300]
That's our pull question today and would you like some free tickets?

[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.600]
Here here's the column west Palm Beach hello

[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.280]
Hi, the all right. Yeah, pretty good sir

[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.460]
Good I'd like to

[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:07.080]
Well, first of all I ask a question I've ever seen for real and Harvey Pires team together. No, I have it as a matter of fact

[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.780]
Oh, okay, that's that's all these suspicious. How about Harvey Pires team for the poll?

[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:14.500]
Yeah, that's a good one. Okay, no Magnolia

[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:22.840]
What do you mean by that? The movie Magnolia and the character Donnie my god, I'm not so hard

[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.320]
Yeah, how did weren't the scenes in it then that bar unbelievable?

[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.320]
Unbelievable

[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.180]
Brad the bartender and

[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:36.500]
The guy who's Henry Gibson from laughing who was just phenomenal and then poured the Wiz kid or whatever it was

[00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:40.460]
Yeah, when he falls off the building. Oh my god, I couldn't have left so hard

[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.000]
But like we said before to show a judge now we're discussing at least when he fell off the building

[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.400]
He actually had a legitimate reason for the dental work

[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:52.720]
Have a great day, palmy. Thank you. That wasn't that was great. There were like about three trips back into that bar scene

[00:49:53.580 --> 00:50:00.560]
And it was great. I have a lot of love to give. I just don't know where to put it back to him that immediately came out

[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:03.240]
That's what clearance has been sent. He has a lot of love to give

[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:06.620]
He didn't know where to put it until recently and he finally found a receptacle

[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:12.180]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.840]
Probably from some dark guy who's pissed off and fired up

[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:31.680]

[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:23.420]
You would know him if you saw him. He's probably on his hair and

It says his uncle Reem is too long ago. He says dead is desi arenaz

[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:46.620]
Uncle Reem was in a real person

[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.200]
That's the difference as opposed to Lucy Lucy desi arenaz Lucy

[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.660]

[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.840]

Now he's really pissed off about that. I guess he I think

[00:54:57.340 --> 00:55:03.280]
Pay him something it does bug me a little bit that he looks at is though was like my decision and I don't want him to

[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:06.800]
In the show and yet we we welcomed him with open arms and legs and armpits

[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.580]
But the fact of the matter is it did they made it into a big they thought he was the volunteering

Everybody was dicking around too much, okay? I don't uh

[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.120]
Who cares?

[00:59:58.320 --> 00:59:58.840]

[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.760]
And the bottom of our chest

[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.040]
About that special feeling we get in the cockles of our homes

[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.320]
Maybe in the sub-cockle area

[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.880]
Maybe in the liver

[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.440]
Maybe in the kidneys

[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.620]
Maybe even in the colon

[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:26.900]
We don't know

[01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.760]

[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.500]
Where the nice art would pour

[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:45.500]
My wife

[01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.580]
And my job

[01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:47.540]

[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:52.880]
So go

[01:00:56.340 --> 01:00:58.180]
But sometimes I'm just

[01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.160]
Painting up

[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.000]
To keep a man like me

[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.240]

[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.480]

In the ultra fast lane

[01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:18.000]
While people

[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.240]

In the handicap spaces

[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:51.700]

Ranting and raving and carrying on

[01:02:10.700 --> 01:02:12.820]

[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.140]

[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:50.480]
The old fashioned, not by the great-of-a-style container

[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.860]
And when I'm done sucking down those three small burgers

[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.020]
I'm gonna wipe my mom with the American flag

[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.860]
And then I'm gonna talk to the style from containers

[01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.220]
Right off the side, and then I'm gonna cut damn thing

[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.740]
Anybody can do it, but you know what?

[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:02.400]
Because we got the bomb

[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.880]
That's why it's too words

[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.240]
Nuclear f**king weapons

They can have all the democracy they want

[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.960]
They can have a big democracy cake

[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.600]
We're off right through the middle, it's the end of it square

[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:15.360]
And it won't make a lick of difference just because we ain't got the bomb

[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.340]
So dad, John Wayne's not dead

[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.500]
He's frozen, and as soon as we find a cure

[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.120]
If I can't, we're gonna fly around that duke

[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:22.320]
And he's gonna be pretty pissed off

[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.340]
You know why? The duke is taking a cold shower

[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.380]
We won't apply that by 15 million times

[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.960]
That's how pissed off the duke's gonna be

[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.940]
I'm gonna do a John Decivetti's

[01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.720]
And leave arm and nail and sand-tack and fall

[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:34.020]
And I face a wade and try down a jack sink

[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.820]

you know when your hair is bad and it's fallen out in clumps you start

[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:06.820]
developing that big shiny spot in the middle of your head absolutely there

[01:08:06.820 --> 01:08:09.700]
are a lot of things you can do about it you walk around with the dead animal who

[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:11.760]
just kind of like gets a nest on top of your head

[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.880]
or you can look really great with the Charles Alfie or a natural headline system

[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.460]

and right now Charlie's offering his summer special hair system only five hundred

[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.840]
and forty nine bucks for first time customers and the reason it's so great is

[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:26.940]
because it looks like the real thing it looks like it's going out of your

[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:29.900]
scalp instead of like a barnyard animal hopped up on your head and died

[01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:33.320]
if you already have a hair system you can save yourself fifty percent on service and

[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.120]
repair on all kinds of hair systems including

[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:39.600]
shampoo and trim as well it's a perfect opportunity to give Charlie a try nothing like Charlie's

[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:43.560]
trim and if you travel to her his hair system for 30 days and don't love the way it looks and

[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:26.820]
you know didn't believe in going to war with the rack and he said well how do you feel about that

[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:32.740]
she says well that's okay I respect them and he said well what are you saying this is like a double

[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:39.000]
standard and he ended up saying you know I don't agree with your book and that was it I mean

[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.240]
she is a nasty woman yes nasty mean spirited speech and she was on film our couple months ago

[01:13:45.240 --> 01:13:54.320]
and called ex president Clinton and Jimmy Carter jackasses but yet you know can't say a thing

[01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:02.140]
the Democrats we can't speak out but daily listener and you're the one that's you know the voice

[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:08.380]
here because these people they have no clue amen have a great day so happy for it same to you bye bye

[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:12.900]
now do we have that your rose thing I want to give you an update of what took place just now

[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:17.340]
off the air because I think it's important you hear this Howard just called the radio station Howard

[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:24.760]
David who I get along with great I thought he called me an asshole saying I was trying to stir it up

[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:31.860]
my point back to Howard is don't listen listen to 101.5 let me see what age group 101.5 for Howard

[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:39.720]
maybe 102.7 some easily listening love music so you could focus on your wife and your family

[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:46.380]
and the grandkids instead of listening and always calling the radio station he's becoming Howard

[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:55.900]
the caller like Howard from Boka Howard from Boka it's like you know it's okay so anyway he's

[01:14:55.900 --> 01:15:00.560]
listening so just wanted to get the message out and don't call my show too just for a record don't

[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:05.340]
call off the air because I don't want to talk to you and I don't want to hear you on the private

[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:09.640]
line congratulations you know the private line number that's great but don't call because you're

[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:15.660]
not coming on this show I'm ready you got your three hours five to eight Monday through Friday you

[01:15:15.660 --> 01:15:20.900]
can talk all you want but you're not coming on this show I'm listening leave it at that all right

[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:26.240]
I'm listening I guess nothing against you you seem like a decent person and I know you've been

[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.360]
getting that taken a big hit on the radio station from everybody else but it's over me and you

[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:39.920]
don't absolutely now what was that I'm listening what is that something that was dropped off

[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:44.560]
to us this morning that's lovely how many is listening right now hey mo have a crappy holiday okay

[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:50.580]
have a horrible vacation I hope your muskrat runs away you know I just had a great idea George

[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:55.640]
yeah because I had to play that off the disc you know that it brought back with me yeah that's

[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:00.520]
got a lot of interesting stuff like Howard from Boka like that on it since I'm gonna have all

[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:06.100]
this extra time on my hands now if you what you need to do now that I'm an expert on the 360

[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:11.020]
absolutely I could certainly put this stuff in the DCS I did that before ages ago when we first

[01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:15.160]
they moved over to QA then I forgot how to do it I'll walk you through it can you imagine

[01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:20.180]
the wealth of material I could put in there during these next few a couple of months I mean

[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:23.560]
that would be more difficult than just swapping the hard drives out so that you could get this

[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:28.880]
updated one up there now we don't want to do that that takes too long it involves engineers

[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.080]
and the whole we don't need to do that that's the point I'm trying to make plus at that point I put

[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:38.140]
in here stuff in my own DCS here that I want see what I be saying no problem I'll walk you right

[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:43.460]
through it absolutely in fact what you can do is you can like write it out and fast me a sheet

[01:16:43.460 --> 01:16:48.080]
we have to we have to interface because I don't know which configuration they gave you up there

[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.220]
and there's two different ways to do it depending on which one they did I see so like tomorrow

[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:57.100]
morning don't forget about that will not a team here's a here's a fact from our most chronic of

[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:01.360]
all factors who says have a great day have in fact in weeks right how about a stereotypical

[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:06.460]
subhating queen misgrudge now that's that's accurate but again that's not the kind of stereotype we're

[01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:13.360]
looking for don't forget now speeder boy don't let him forget writing it down as you said very very

[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:17.320]
important Neil on the DCS getting Neil working up to a frenzy see other than just have it all

[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:22.780]
at leisure time yeah you don't I almost feel bad about that thing with Ferrell and this but you

[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:29.200]
know it's not his show say I almost feel bad about it but this morning he finally like leaked it

[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:33.640]
out I I told you at last couple days I've warned you that I had a feeling he was getting a little

[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.220]
nervous about that he was upset that we weren't inviting him to do a summer film here but we did

[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:43.620]
invite him and then they got it all screwed up because he actually wanted to get paid I can imagine

[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:47.640]
right well they're they're it's not in the cards and I can do that I'm going to pay you and pay him

[01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:54.380]
pay me and all of this other stuff it's just not their deal but the point I'm trying to make is

[01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:59.480]
keep in mind that Ferrell came in he did a few fillings okay for like about a week or two then

[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.020]
but I'm being before you know it all of a sudden he's got his own show and he's jamming

[01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.860]
Moe back in there in the middle of the night thank God absolutely right but just kind of like

[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:11.640]
stick with I don't try to branch out too fast that would be my advice far be it for me to tell

[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:16.740]
you what to do but don't try to like spread your testicles out too far like a giant guy damn

[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:22.320]
thing you know I'm talking about no what are you talking about like an octopus oh

[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:30.240]
just keep your testicles and tentacles in there from like about 756 to 1004 and for the time

[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:37.800]
being everything will be fine 1204 155 like I said as long as I get paid he can have all your time

closing in on her ass she better watch it oh oh oh whoo

[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.800]
back to him pick up the pace a little bit friend before that bastard catches you

[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:44.780]
see I know this is ridiculous I know that it's just so un-American to say this but the fact

[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:50.300]
that there are morons who will still pay to watch that asshole I don't want to say fight because

[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:55.500]
he doesn't really fight anybody but to watch him perform I mean it's just it's mind-boggling

[01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:01.660]
my Tyson although I also you know the character that Tom Cruise played in magnolia yeah a lot of

[01:24:01.660 --> 01:24:07.940]

[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.820]
these people most represents an ugly sexual racial or ethnic stereotype we're asking today

Barbara Streisand 36 he passed her like she was sitting on a in the court yard

thing I've learned in the past is if you just if we just have these conversations and mentioned

[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.820]
something all of a sudden it pops up on a pool well a multitasking so you know one year's got to go

[01:26:43.420 --> 01:26:47.200]
no interest in baseball I have no team that I like or dislike I wish him all the luck in the world

[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:54.460]
with his endeavors but the he'll need it that's all I can say to him it is boring it is ponderous

we thought we're good George involved out there a little bit couldn't even can even get a

[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:04.340]

[01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:59.820]

in Verizon wireless line no request from Arlington it's today no damn it we got Don Trell pitching

[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:08.720]
night don't they have like a special fireworks show tonight to a fourth of July thing

[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:13.100]
or something about that I don't know if it's tonight I don't know if that's for real or not see

[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.260]
what I probably is because I think they're going on a road for a couple of weeks yet they're at

[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:19.180]
the Phillies Friday they're going to be gone for two weeks so this is the last home game for a while

[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:24.100]
so I bet you they do that thing tonight so that'll boost up the attendance see it's no big trick

[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:28.740]
I hate to break the news to Scott or anybody else when you're giving away bobble head dolls or

[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:34.600]
you're giving away helmets team helmets or you're giving away any paraphernalia it always

[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:40.380]
boosts up the attendance by a few thousand not gigantic but a few thousand especially in South Florida

[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:46.160]
anywhere but especially in that time because it's a free loader town everybody knows that if it's

[01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.700]
free it's me are we put that before on the show stop me if it's free it's me that's the model of

[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:57.140]
South Florida so you know just show me your average ordinary run of the milk pedestrian game on a

[01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:01.400]
weekdied or or even on a weekend where there's no big giveaway then I'll decide if there's any interest

[01:30:01.400 --> 01:30:05.580]
and don't give me the old any cappin routine any famous for this oh we don't want to discuss that

[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:09.320]
about the attendance that's old news and I'm not interested you're not interested because it's

[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.720]
embarrassing because it goes to show you that the stuff that you guys waste so much time on there

[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:19.100]
is very minimal to not exist an interest in you can't you can't eliminate that especially at

[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:52.980]
was

[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:55.080]
Every June shore was bright,

[01:45:55.540 --> 01:45:57.620]
Down by the days,

[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:01.160]
And we reached out low and yet,

[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:05.360]
Every June from R.E.M.

[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:08.220]
Mr. We just knew one day,

[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.660]

That's the fans' commitment, wait.

[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.580]
To let sucks we have to pay.

[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:29.080]
Those were the days.

[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.160]
I can just see it now. Archie Bunker downloading all those R.E.M. songs, can't you?

[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:37.860]
Club 19, and maybe he's got like a big blow-up doll of Michael Stein.

Remember that kid that called in a few days ago and said that that was his guy with a bad face, but was really hot?

[01:46:43.280 --> 01:46:45.420]
Yeah. Maybe he's touched it.

[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.200]
Maybe he's touched.

[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.160]
Mike Tyson has just passed friend Resher.

[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.180]
Let's hear it.

[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.560]
56670560.560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:01.520]
No, forget we're looking for a big sellout at the Amarling game that I had at P.P. Park.

[01:47:01.840 --> 01:47:02.380]
No excuses.

[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:05.220]
Here's a call from Davy. Hello.

[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:06.480]
Neil.

[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:07.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.720]
How about anybody mentioned the honorable Reverend Jesse Jackson?

[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:12.620]
No.

[01:47:12.620 --> 01:47:13.340]
No.

[01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:14.500]
How about Al Sharpton?

[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:16.100]
No.

[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:17.380]
Neither one of those.

[01:47:17.380 --> 01:47:18.840]
What are they a stereotype of?

[01:47:19.200 --> 01:47:22.980]
Oh, just the professional black people now.

[01:47:23.940 --> 01:47:24.020]
Yeah.

[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.620]
No, I'm sorry.

[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.560]
I know what you're saying, but I don't think it fits what we're looking for.

[01:47:31.940 --> 01:47:33.660]
Can I get a request any moment?

[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.040]
Go ahead.

[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:35.780]
Any moment.

[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:36.400]
Any moment.

[01:47:36.580 --> 01:47:37.240]
Any moment.

[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:37.580]

[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:40.140]
I'm listening.

[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.400]
Absolutely.

[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:43.760]
Oh, man.

[01:47:44.380 --> 01:47:45.900]
Yeah, let's inject one right now.

[01:47:46.060 --> 01:47:47.140]
Okay, just it'll be real quick.

[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:47.920]
Don't get panicky.

[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:50.940]
Let's stick one in there now that we haven't heard in a while.

[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.740]
That's often back what one's kind of lame.

[01:47:55.860 --> 01:47:56.520]
Which one?

[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:57.840]
What about?

[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:02.780]
56680560.

[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.220]
W-U-A-M presents.

[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:06.300]
Leave it to these.

[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.300]
Starring Moe Howard David as Moe.

[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.860]
All in as gay carlos.

[01:48:16.380 --> 01:48:23.020]
Steven J. Goldstein as Wally and Brian Lundin as the Beast.

[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:26.900]
I'm home.

[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:29.020]
Hey, where's the hat stand?

[01:48:29.500 --> 01:48:30.880]
I ain't got no place to hang my wig.

[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:31.980]
I'm out of it.

[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.880]
I had another piercing accident.

[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.600]
Watch out for the puddle.

[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:36.180]
Whoa!

[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:39.020]
Why didn't the beast cling to his up?

[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.680]
He's upstairs with Wally.

[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.500]
G-Beast, you better clean that bean puddle before Moe gets home.

[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:48.800]
Um, yeah, I don't know, Wally.

[01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:49.880]
It's kind of sticky.

[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:50.960]
Ha-ha.

[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:53.400]
So you didn't cling the bean puddle.

[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:54.000]
Ha-ha.

[01:48:54.260 --> 01:48:55.700]
Yeah, fat little bastard.

[01:48:56.100 --> 01:48:57.580]
You tuba lad.

[01:48:57.940 --> 01:48:58.580]
You're walking.

[01:48:58.960 --> 01:48:59.280]
Going up.

[01:48:59.420 --> 01:49:00.440]
Told you he'd get sore.

[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:01.920]
Don't be so hard on the blind.

[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:02.980]
Hey, come here, beast.

[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:04.800]
Time we had a little chat.

[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.560]
Um, I don't know.

[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:07.280]
Okay.

[01:49:07.460 --> 01:49:10.300]
No, you don't say anything to Lumpur while the stand did it.

[01:49:10.300 --> 01:49:10.560]
Okay.

[01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:12.500]
I said that to Lumpur on Pogun.

[01:49:12.640 --> 01:49:13.480]
But you stop.

[01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:14.840]
But I don't, right?

[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:15.520]
That's it.

[01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:17.500]
Remember my friend here?

[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:19.000]
Mr. Belt.

[01:49:20.980 --> 01:49:22.500]
Don't, don't, don't.

[01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:22.740]
Stop.

[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:23.400]
How many?

[01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:23.900]
I know.

[01:49:24.020 --> 01:49:25.000]
I will ya stop.

[01:49:25.940 --> 01:49:27.840]
Don't, I said stop it.

[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:29.820]
You shake your mouth, you're quite smoking poop.

[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.600]
Okay.

[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.840]
But don't stand near the window.

[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:33.460]
What for?

[01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:35.920]
Cause you might fall down.

[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:44.000]
One great season of Magnolia in Ed Barr is where, uh, Donnie, the quiz kid, Jess, is sitting

[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.620]
with his dyed coke at the counter before he decides that he's going to have a tequila.

[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:53.400]
And he's watching Henry Gibson coming on the bartender, Brad the bartender.

[01:49:54.300 --> 01:49:56.080]
And his expression goes from a smile.

[01:49:56.080 --> 01:50:01.640]
There's a long shot where his expression goes from his lips are curled up to like straight

[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:02.800]
across to a frown.

[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:04.160]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.400]
Every scene, everything in that movie is just so brilliantly done.

[01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:08.220]
And George don't like it.

[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:09.860]
I didn't like the ad.

[01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:13.660]
George didn't like Magnolia, which I find is shocking and astonishing and absolutely

[01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:14.860]
un-American if you ask me.

[01:50:15.260 --> 01:50:15.260]

[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.100]
I think it's, huh?

[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.160]
I'm dying to see it again.

[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:21.000]
I saw it again last night.

[01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:22.020]
Let me say it one more time.

[01:50:23.140 --> 01:50:24.620]
And it's, it's just brilliant.

[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:25.240]
It's phenomenal.

[01:50:26.300 --> 01:50:28.000]
Maybe a little bit too intellectual for George.

[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:28.700]
Maybe a little bit.

[01:50:28.740 --> 01:50:29.080]
Right.

[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.160]
It's cop out, especially with a frog's throat.

[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:31.400]
It dropped.

[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:32.580]
It's too intellectual for George.

[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.680]
All of George was right.

[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.540]
I told you off the air.

[01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:35.880]
We might as well give you credit on the air.

[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:42.820]
George was correct about the scene where Jimmy Gator, the TV quiz show host, is going to

[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:45.960]
blow his brains out after his wife has finally outed him about molesting the daughter.

[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:47.560]
And he sticks the gun.

[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:48.900]
It was that I shouldn't say, should I?

[01:50:48.960 --> 01:50:49.540]
Well, that's okay.

[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.540]
Doesn't ruin anything because we talked about this.

[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:52.560]
He can't ruin the end.

[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:54.820]
No, in fact, this makes it even better because we don't know what really happened.

[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.660]
He puts the gun to his head at this point.

[01:50:56.660 --> 01:50:59.360]
This is when the, it's raining frogs and toads.

[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:00.980]
And they're just poor.

[01:51:01.300 --> 01:51:04.060]
And those houses must be built pretty poor, you know?

[01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.700]
They can go through a little skylight.

[01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:10.320]
It fell through a skylight, but nevertheless, I mean, well, whatever.

[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.860]
And it falls to the skylight and hits the gun and the gun goes off.

[01:51:14.100 --> 01:51:16.680]
And then it actually right to hit the TV screen.

[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.940]
And that's why the, the core, the power cord sizzled and fried.

[01:51:20.940 --> 01:51:24.600]
And he is on the floor like a little butt on his, on his lapel.

[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:27.820]
But that's from hitting the floor, I guess, because there's broken glass and crap.

[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:32.120]
Just, I know it's just a small detail, but you were right on that.

[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:35.040]
Yeah, because I couldn't, because it happens really, really fast.

[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.800]
And you have to go back and, well, if I would have just said you were full of crap,

[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:38.320]
you wouldn't know.

[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:42.580]
At least I'm honorable enough to say I watched a three four a whole bunch of times.

[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:45.460]
Just to make sure you were right.

[01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:49.320]
Just to keep watching that big frog fall.

[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.520]
It's like a free fall.

[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:51.320]
It's a beautiful thing.

[01:51:51.860 --> 01:51:52.420]
It's a great shot.

[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.060]
It's slow mo.

[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.020]
56670560, pound five.

[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:58.920]
That would be a good bit for Boka Brian to the tune of its reigning men.

[01:51:59.180 --> 01:51:59.940]
It's reigning frogs.

[01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:01.760]
Something to think about.

[01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:04.360]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:04.680]
Hello.

[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:06.680]
Daniel?

[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:07.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:09.420]
Thanks for taking my call.

[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:13.140]
To me, one of the most obnoxious people has to be Gilbert Gottfried.

[01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:15.760]
Yeah.

[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:16.700]
Is he a stereotype?

[01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:25.140]
Well, I mean, I don't know if he found a stereotype, but he's definitely obnoxious.

[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:28.200]
And that's all I got.

[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.260]
And we hope he dies.

[01:52:29.400 --> 01:52:30.080]
Okay, thank you.

[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.140]
Yeah, I agree with him.

[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.700]
He is obnoxious, but I don't think he fits what we're talking about, do you?

[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:33.960]
No.

[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:34.640]
No.

[01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:36.320]
I don't say like that.

[01:52:36.520 --> 01:52:37.540]
Like, I mean, give me a break.

[01:52:38.100 --> 01:52:38.220]
No.

[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:39.520]
His intentions were good.

[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.820]
He just wanted to rip a guy in the ass.

[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:41.800]
And I think he's right.

[01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:42.740]
Yeah, he's right.

[01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:44.220]
He's obnoxious, but we didn't ask that.

[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:46.600]
Quit being a nitpicker, okay?

[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:48.740]
And by the way, the frog didn't knock the gun.

[01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:50.300]
Mike Geisen.

[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.120]
Mike Geisen.

[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:52.840]
Mike Geisen.

[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:53.820]
Remember Max?

[01:52:54.120 --> 01:52:54.880]
What was his name?

[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:55.900]
Max Geisen.

[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:58.800]
The guy that I'm always talking about that you have no idea who finally died.

[01:52:58.960 --> 01:53:00.460]
The guy that did a TV show with false teeth.

[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:02.820]
Well, if you don't know who he is, with no false teeth.

[01:53:03.340 --> 01:53:04.120]
Ask Tom Jickel.

[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:06.340]
Tell you because Tom used to be on a show with him a hundred years ago.

[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:08.780]
Well, look at this.

[01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:09.700]
What is this?

[01:53:10.020 --> 01:53:10.900]
Very nice.

[01:53:10.900 --> 01:53:14.740]
The daughter of Muhammad Ali and Mark will duke it out in the ring.

[01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:16.560]
To be doing August 23rd and boom.

[01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:17.560]
Oh, my God.

[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.140]
Another one of these contrived.

[01:53:19.220 --> 01:53:23.280]
You know, I'm going to tell you, Jerry Springer needs to be taken off the earth for just a few months.

[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:24.680]
Okay, let America calm down.

[01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:26.900]
Another one of these phony brawls.

[01:53:27.820 --> 01:53:32.220]
Muhammad Ali's daughter, and a promotional press conference there for her fight coming up.

[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:34.280]
And she gets into a bra with some bitch.

[01:53:34.420 --> 01:53:34.980]
Was Sheryl.

[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.340]
And not a channel that you get.

[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:37.720]
Oh, that's right.

[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:38.300]
He said a boot.

[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:40.200]
Yeah, he said it's a boot time.

[01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.740]
They beat the crap out of each other.

[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:44.200]
Mike Tyson's got 90 friend, Ressure 85.

[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:47.580]
Let me read the question again because some of you are starting to like lose it.

[01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:54.880]
Which of these people most represents an ugly sexual racial or ethnic stereotype?

[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:58.340]
Mike Tyson, 90 friend, Ressure 85, Barbara Streisand, 47.

[01:53:58.700 --> 01:53:59.780]
Jim J Bullock, 31.

[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:01.000]
Jackie Mason, 21.

[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:03.240]
Well, I like Jackie Mason.

[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:07.520]
Jerry, you know, I saw Jackie Mason at the, what the hell was the name of that hotel?

[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:12.800]
I come to be on Atlantic, the, not the Atlantic powers right on the street from there.

[01:54:13.040 --> 01:54:15.060]
How many years ago in 1956 and Miami Beach?

[01:54:15.560 --> 01:54:16.420]
Did you look the same?

[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:17.560]
Look the same.

[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:18.280]
He sounded the same.

[01:54:18.500 --> 01:54:19.400]
He looked exactly the same.

[01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:20.760]
Jackie Mason, 21.

[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:22.500]
Jerry, son, fell 18.

[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:23.880]
Christopher Lowell, 17.

[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.920]
Eddie Murphy and Charles Nelson, Marley, 15.

[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:27.280]
I'd like to see those two together.

[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:28.900]
Any griffin eight.

[01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:30.380]
Rosie Perez has got seven.

[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:31.080]
Nice going, Rosie.

[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:32.200]
She's crawling up the list.

[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.160]
Well, at least she's up to eight.

[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:34.780]
Desiarnes five.

[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:36.440]
Lucy, Queen of Tepa five.

[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:38.420]
And that's about it.

[01:54:38.540 --> 01:54:40.320]
27 past noon at five 60.

[01:54:40.460 --> 01:54:44.200]
See when we do these Wednesdays, I enjoy that one to two hour, but I don't know.

[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:45.800]
I feel like we're rushed, you know?

[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:47.620]
I don't.

[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:50.320]
Well, you believe that I was saying?

[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.640]
No, it sounds good though, because we got so much.

[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.060]
We got to accomplish here and so got them a little time.

[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:56.380]
By now you've been here.

[01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.580]
We talk about lamin and cirrus.

[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:01.320]
I hope and how laminated word flooring from lamin and cirrus is the smart, the easy.

[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:04.460]
The low maintenance alternative to expensive natural word flooring.

[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:08.580]
Lamin and cirrus is the best place for you to find laminated wood flooring from the top names in a

Venice, Peridoy, Pergo, Wilson, our Unifluor and Quickstep.

[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.800]
They've got all the top names all installed by Pergo certified installers.

[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:17.260]
Here's another real reason why I got to be called lamin and cirrus.

[01:55:17.360 --> 01:55:19.200]
Their prices will absolutely floore you.

[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:22.880]
Right now you can get the summer special for just $1995.

That's correct.

[01:55:23.940 --> 01:55:28.020]
Just $1995 from the 380 square feet of beautiful laminated wood flooring.

[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.940]
It is positively unbelievable.

[01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:32.760]

Get a light.

[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:09.840]
We've assembled you all here today because we're looking for a few good men to join the new Iraqi Army.

[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:14.260]
And as soon as you all stop throwing your shoes at us, we can get started.

[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.520]
How many here already have combat experience?

[01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:23.100]
Great.

[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:25.800]
I see many of you actually brought your guns.

[01:56:25.980 --> 01:56:30.380]
We'll be taking those, but don't worry. We'll replace them with these cute little teddy bears.

[01:56:30.580 --> 01:56:32.080]
When do we get to blow our shoes up?

[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.080]
No, no. In this army, you will not be blowing yourself up.

[01:56:36.300 --> 01:56:37.560]
Boom! Blow up now! Boom!

[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.620]
No, boom! No, boom! Now let's move on.

[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:43.500]
How many of you are familiar with the way the US Army works?

[01:56:46.380 --> 01:56:47.400]
Okay, that's great.

[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:50.060]
How many of you are familiar with modern warfare?

[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.760]
Jihad! Jihad!

[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:02.800]
No, no, Jihad. There won't be any Jihading.

[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:04.260]
Jihad! Jihad!

[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.360]
No, Jihad!

[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.440]
No, Jihad!

[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:08.480]
Blow myself up now!

[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:08.940]
No!

[01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:11.980]
Jihad! Jihad!

1232 at 560 WDQ. I'm happy Wednesday to.

[01:57:22.500 --> 01:57:24.720]
Happy Fourth of July. Anybody still in town?

[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:24.940]
No.

[01:57:25.040 --> 01:57:26.100]
How many people we got left in?

[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:27.060]
About 30, man.

[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:30.260]
Mike Tyson has opened up a 7-volt lead.

[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:33.700]
Mike Tyson 95, friend, Resher 88, Barbara Streisand 50.

[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:35.300]
Everybody else is small taters.

[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.140]
Here's a call from Margate. Hello.

[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:39.220]
Hi, Neil.

[01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:40.380]
Yes, sir. How are you doing today?

[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:40.880]
Good.

[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:41.800]
Great, you're the best.

[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:43.680]
I got a couple for your poll there.

[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:45.400]
How about for the Italian?

[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.580]
How about Joy Betafugo?

[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:48.820]
Okay.

[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.140]
And how about for the homophobes Reverend Jones?

[01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:52.000]
And I'm out there.

[01:57:52.480 --> 01:57:52.760]
Okay.

[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.580]
Do you have any idea what he was talking about?

[01:57:58.860 --> 01:58:00.180]
Yeah, it's another one of his buddies.

[01:58:00.380 --> 01:58:02.600]
Apparently he has a person or two that doesn't hate him.

[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:03.480]
I see.

[01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:07.740]
Oh, and speaking of that, it's a good time because I was just wondering in my mind

[01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:09.100]
during the break, sure how my mind works.

[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:12.320]
The difference between Greg Videl and Mohawar Davida.

[01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.320]
Besides the weight in the age and the hair.

[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.520]
Because Greg Videl thinks that everybody hates him.

[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:20.400]
In most cases, he's right.

[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:22.580]
567-0560.

[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:24.460]
See, you're not paranoid when it's the truth.

[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:27.920]
Pound 56 on the AT&T in Hawaii and Marvellous Line.

[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:28.980]
Moh doesn't think that.

[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:30.680]
Absolutely.

[01:58:31.820 --> 01:58:32.920]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.020]
Hello.

[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:36.860]
Hey, two things.

[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:38.440]
One is Charo.

[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:41.100]
You should be on that list for some reason.

[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:44.600]
Yeah, for some, for some specific reason we haven't figured out yet.

[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:45.600]
I don't know.

[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:46.380]
I don't know.

[01:58:46.380 --> 01:58:48.000]
You look at Charo on her.

[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:50.100]
She's a good one, although I don't know where you just find anybody else.

[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.300]
But she's got to choose up noxious.

[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.100]
Number two is I'm from Pennsylvania.

[01:58:53.900 --> 01:58:58.380]
And they built the new stadiums and taxpayers expense for the pirates and the dealers.

[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:00.460]
And there's still nobody going to the pirate games.

[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:01.800]
Nobody's going to it.

[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:07.720]
And they just raised their beer up $4 a case and raised cigarettes 60 cents a pack trying to recoup the money.

[01:59:07.900 --> 01:59:08.360]
There you go.

[01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:09.100]
My pack's dollars.

[01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:10.460]
So don't do it.

[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:11.740]
We voted no for it.

[01:59:11.780 --> 01:59:12.820]
We still ended up with it.

[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:13.400]
Yeah.

[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:17.280]
So hey, you got a great radio station just here of his and I'm leaving for bone tomorrow.

[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:18.380]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[01:59:18.420 --> 01:59:18.960]
Have a safe trip.

[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:19.680]
Thank you.

[01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.320]
Bye-bye.

[01:59:20.780 --> 01:59:21.540]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:22.880]
Pittsburgh, they built a new stadium.

[01:59:22.880 --> 01:59:23.560]
They're drawing anybody.

[01:59:23.680 --> 01:59:24.420]
No, Detroit.

[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:25.780]
In fact, let me take a look.

[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:28.040]
The Blue Jays are taking a coma and Detroit, but.

[01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:31.980]
I'm on my way.

[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:42.180]
I think it's a section that threw in the and the crapper here.

[01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:47.760]
Let me dig around the crapper for it.

[01:59:53.620 --> 01:59:54.760]
I'm digging around.

[01:59:55.220 --> 01:59:56.560]
But what I found you.

[01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:57.160]
I'm trying to get out of the truck.

[02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.080]
I got that crap.

[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:05.420]
Quit playing awful music here.

[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:06.980]
Here's buddy.

[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:07.740]
Hackett's a bit.

[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:08.560]
He's still dead.

[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:09.840]
But he's still dead.

[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:11.420]
Let's take a look at the attendance.

[02:00:11.620 --> 02:00:13.240]
The blue Jays after Detroit Tigers.

[02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.240]
Well, look at that.

[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:18.400]
Detroit where they built that new stadium and they thought, oh, we're going to get a lot of money now.

[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:20.120]
The tenants be way up to the team will be great.

[02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:22.180]
The Tigers are one of the worst teams in history.

[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:25.140]
They're in last place in their division by a zillion games.

[02:00:25.140 --> 02:00:25.800]
They're twenty three.

[02:00:25.940 --> 02:00:27.500]
They're twenty and sixty one.

[02:00:27.620 --> 02:00:28.420]
They played any one games.

[02:00:28.500 --> 02:00:29.320]
They've won only twenty.

[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:31.500]
They're already twenty three games.

[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:33.280]
They're already it's only the early July.

[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:34.940]
They're already almost mathematically eliminated.

[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:35.500]
It's so bad.

[02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:39.660]
So nobody cares about the Detroit Tigers.

[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.680]
Nobody's going to their crappy new stadium, but.

[02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:47.280]
But the attendance there 15,000, 448 last night for the blue Jays.

[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.160]
Or cold as ice ready for that.

[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.960]
What beating by twenty five hundred.

[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.060]
The attendance announced at the Marlin game.

[02:00:55.200 --> 02:01:01.480]
Now both the tendances is goose up a couple of thousand, but nevertheless just go based on what the numbers are there because they're both probably goose up the same.

[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:05.080]
15,000, 448 in Detroit with the worst team.

[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:08.060]
In fact, as anybody got a worst team, I can't imagine a Tampa Bay.

[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:08.380]
No.

[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:11.080]
No, nobody's even close.

[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:13.860]
The Tigers are by far by several games.

[02:01:13.860 --> 02:01:17.100]
The worst record in all of baseball, including even the anxious Tampa Bay devil raise.

[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:22.180]
And in spite of that, they had well over 15,000 for last night's game there.

[02:01:22.180 --> 02:01:31.140]
And the Marlins winning 20 to one game over 500 13,073, including the three or 400 Missions that the for all gave away for free.

[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:32.780]
How do you like that?

[02:01:33.320 --> 02:01:34.640]
But you keep working on it Scott.

[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:36.720]
You keep swimming upstream, baby.

[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.880]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:01:39.940 --> 02:01:41.440]
The way I look at it is better him than us.

[02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:42.540]
We've already played that game.

[02:01:42.700 --> 02:01:44.520]
Okay. We've already got all the battle scars.

[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:46.500]
Here's sunrise. Hello.

[02:01:47.340 --> 02:01:47.780]
Hello.

[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:48.600]
Yes, sir.

[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:50.160]
Yeah, first time long time.

[02:01:50.300 --> 02:01:54.560]
You're missing the number one professional ethnic of all time.

[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:54.920]
Okay.

[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:56.700]
I'll be on a Ross Lateman.

[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:57.860]
Oh, I love that.

[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.300]
That's an ugly stereotype right there.

[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:02.700]
Very ugly.

[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:04.320]
In every respect, yes.

[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:05.820]
You know, I'll talk to the other night.

[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.640]
Somehow she goes from Iraq to Fidel.

[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:09.440]
Sure.

[02:02:09.700 --> 02:02:14.240]
I don't know how you could be talking about crispy cream donuts and she'd find a way to a Thai Fidel.

[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:16.260]
Do you know what I'm cute, but they're going to have to be pretty.

[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.060]
She have his beard getting stuck on a sugar.

[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:21.280]
Okay.

[02:02:21.280 --> 02:02:21.880]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:22.360]
Good choice.

[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:23.100]
Yeah.

[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:26.500]
Yaliana Gross-Latin, one of my least favorite people.

[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.800]
And a perfect representative for South Florida, man.

[02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:30.820]
She fits in like a rubber glove right inside your back.

[02:02:30.880 --> 02:02:31.260]
Oh, Venus.

[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.760]
Yaliana Ross-Latin.

[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:37.540]
She's a late addition on there, but I guarantee if VenaBroad puts his head to what we get around her.

[02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:39.560]
She's going to zoom up that list fast.

[02:02:41.020 --> 02:02:43.340]
And boy in South Florida, is she the perfect?

[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:45.180]
I mean, is there any doubt?

[02:02:46.460 --> 02:02:50.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:51.360]
We got 398 votes.

[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:53.960]
Gotta be a few people around town, not too many.

[02:02:56.140 --> 02:02:57.620]
Scott seems pretty happy to be there.

[02:02:57.720 --> 02:02:59.840]
Although he is having me sit for South Beach the next few days.

[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:00.240]
Why not?

[02:03:00.400 --> 02:03:01.320]
If it's so great in Boka.

[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:04.240]
I don't understand.

[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:07.700]
And if he's up in, if he's down in South Beach and Mo is hanging around a house in Boka,

[02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:09.420]
then I'm going to get to bond and play golf together.

[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:09.860]
Are they?

[02:03:10.180 --> 02:03:10.480]
Absolutely.

[02:03:10.680 --> 02:03:10.800]
Not.

[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:13.160]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:13.520]
Hello.

[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:14.680]
Happy Fourth Neil.

[02:03:15.040 --> 02:03:15.580]
Back to you, sir.

[02:03:16.620 --> 02:03:17.920]
Couple of movies real quick.

[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:18.540]
Okay.

[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:20.600]
I watched a movie last night.

[02:03:20.600 --> 02:03:22.180]
I know you've probably never seen it.

[02:03:22.260 --> 02:03:25.420]
George and being a boy probably has a scary movie.

[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:28.440]
There are so many scenes in there that you would just wet yourself.

[02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:29.760]
The guy won't death.

[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:30.620]
Well, practice.

[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:33.980]
There's one guy smacking all the guys on the ass is looking at him.

[02:03:34.300 --> 02:03:35.400]
There's so many things in the movie.

[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.740]
I think about you when I watch it.

[02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:37.520]
It's a real miracle.

[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:39.160]
There's a gory hole in the movie.

[02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:40.960]
It's a, I mean, your movie intensive.

[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:42.880]
And that movie is a couple of years old.

[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:44.820]
But I'm telling you, it's as funny as any Leslie.

[02:03:44.920 --> 02:03:45.100]
Why?

[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:45.920]
I've seen it.

[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:46.680]
I've seen it.

[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:47.560]
Scary movie.

[02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:48.720]
I never heard you mention it.

[02:03:48.960 --> 02:03:49.200]
Sure.

[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:49.800]
Okay.

[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:50.760]
And two more things.

[02:03:50.880 --> 02:03:51.220]
It's a hoot.

[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:55.280]
Once upon a time in America, which is one of my favorite movies, is that as the DVD

[02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:57.440]
works, buying with the extra minutes in it.

[02:03:57.500 --> 02:03:57.760]
Yes.

[02:03:58.020 --> 02:03:58.380]
Absolutely.

[02:03:58.720 --> 02:03:59.760]
I just watched it this weekend.

[02:03:59.920 --> 02:04:00.220]
Absolutely.

[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:02.460]
Jennifer Conley there.

[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:07.560]
And once upon a time in America, if you look at the credits, it has a stunt double for her.

[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:09.680]
That must be the ass part there when she's a little girl.

[02:04:09.680 --> 02:04:10.660]
They couldn't show her actual.

[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:12.320]
I mean, recommend for a dream.

[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:13.100]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:17.200]
And once upon a time in America, she drops her dress for the kid looking through the

[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:18.460]
scene.

[02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:19.540]
That's not Jennifer Conley.

[02:04:19.720 --> 02:04:20.280]
Yes, it is.

[02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:20.880]
Yes.

[02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:22.300]
Under a different name.

[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:23.360]
Yeah, it's her.

[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.540]
No, it's her Jennifer Conley.

[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:24.940]
Oh, does it?

[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:25.360]
Yeah.

[02:04:25.420 --> 02:04:25.820]
Wait a minute.

[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:26.480]
Hang on a second.

[02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:27.820]
Oh, George, I whistle the tune.

[02:04:28.020 --> 02:04:28.340]
Hang on.

[02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:28.960]
Okay.

[02:04:31.700 --> 02:04:34.100]
You might be using it.

[02:04:43.220 --> 02:04:43.580]
Okay.

[02:04:43.660 --> 02:04:44.800]
I got the thing right in my hand.

[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:45.020]
Right.

[02:04:47.020 --> 02:04:50.040]
Of course, the only problem with it is there are so many people in my movie.

[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:50.380]
Right.

[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:50.880]
Or movie.

[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:54.560]
But if her name doesn't appear anywhere that I've seen, then she's on the credits.

[02:04:55.020 --> 02:04:55.680]
She's the little girl.

[02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:58.800]
And the part of Elizabeth McGovern?

[02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:00.740]
No, no, no.

[02:05:00.860 --> 02:05:01.660]
Yes, one little girl.

[02:05:01.900 --> 02:05:01.940]
Yes.

[02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:03.360]
She's the little Elizabeth McGovern.

[02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:03.940]
Right.

[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:05.120]
Exactly.

[02:05:05.920 --> 02:05:07.340]
Yeah, because that's when he's looking through the people.

[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:07.840]
Right.

[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:10.600]
She's noodles and noodles is in love with her when she's the little girl.

[02:05:10.900 --> 02:05:11.100]
Right.

[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.780]
That's Jennifer Conley.

[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.160]
Yes.

[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:13.280]
Yes.

[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:18.520]
She turns around and shows her ass and on the credits it says...

[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.000]
Back to him.

[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:20.940]
Jennifer Conley stunt double.

[02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:24.580]
So that's it stunt ass there, unlike in Requiem.

[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:26.100]
Oh, in Requiem, should we...

[02:05:26.100 --> 02:05:27.160]
Well, that's why she made up for it.

[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.320]
That's why she asked to ask to make up her last time.

[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:32.740]
And one more thing you may not have ever considered in the movie The Godfather.

[02:05:32.740 --> 02:05:38.160]
There's so many lines, but there's one line that really says a lot when...

[02:05:38.160 --> 02:05:44.120]
when the lawyer, Tom Hagen, tell Sonny to make the deal and he says,

[02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:45.100]
that's easy for you.

[02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:49.840]
He's not your father and he says, he is as much a father to me as you or Michael.

[02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:53.140]
But he doesn't mention Freito.

[02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:54.020]
Isn't that interesting?

[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:55.100]
Never know this thing.

[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:56.200]
Yeah, I think it's interesting.

[02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:56.740]

[02:05:56.760 --> 02:05:58.640]
As much as Sonny as you or Michael, there's three.

[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:00.180]
Hardy bones, but he never mentioned the middle one.

[02:06:00.700 --> 02:06:02.040]
I want to make them on offer again.

[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:02.800]
Okay.

[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:03.460]
Have a great, great cake.

[02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:04.060]
You too, Pallee.

[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:04.360]
Thanks.

[02:06:05.420 --> 02:06:06.040]
How do you like that?

[02:06:06.040 --> 02:06:07.120]
We're getting movie intensive again.

[02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:07.680]
And we like it.

[02:06:07.940 --> 02:06:08.660]
Everybody likes it.

[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:10.980]
That was just a bunch of sour pie, okay, all those assholes.

[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:13.200]
Even Ferrell was talking movies with me this morning.

[02:06:13.220 --> 02:06:13.440]
See?

[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.200]
We'll bring them around.

[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.000]
Well, you rather hear about movies at Amarlands.

[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:17.340]
Who you ask?

[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:19.520]
That's a tough one.

[02:06:20.140 --> 02:06:21.120]
That's a tough contest.

[02:06:22.720 --> 02:06:24.040]
1241 at 560 WQM.

[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:28.200]
Happy anniversary to our good post-personal buddies at Brandy Shoes in Poppedo Beach.

[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:30.620]
25 years this year in business.

[02:06:30.860 --> 02:06:33.260]

[02:07:24.680 --> 02:07:26.680]
Men's rigorous bochoos, only 3990.

[02:07:27.320 --> 02:07:31.060]
Stop it or visit Brandy's on their website at BrandysHews.com.

[02:07:31.680 --> 02:07:32.680]
I'm not alone.

[02:07:33.940 --> 02:07:35.680]
This is sports radio, five to six.

[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:37.020]
You way, yeah.

[02:07:38.580 --> 02:07:39.760]
Gotta fight it!

[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:42.860]
What a, what a, you're lunger!

[02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:45.140]
Wow!

[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:51.560]
Now, another page from the audio diary of Mike Tyson.

[02:07:52.460 --> 02:07:54.000]
Here's the audio diary.

[02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:57.820]
Trouble seems to follow me like a bad soup.

[02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:00.020]
Oh, that's the other thing.

[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:08.260]
I recently found out when your soup can't is all dennin' and smashed in, don't eat it, there we go.

[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:12.040]
I was suffering from a terrible case of vachakism.

[02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:16.340]
I had awful crap in my lower intestine.

[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:16.780]
That's the cause.

[02:08:18.480 --> 02:08:26.380]
Anyways, I was arrested and had sports released on my own with climbers.

[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:32.680]
Two thugs was up to no good and started making trouble in my neighborhood.

[02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:38.740]
That's a line from the French Prince of Bellville, there we...

[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:40.900]
I love the little brother on that show.

[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:44.560]
His name was Carlton, but he's not a door man.

[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.520]
Anyways, back to the arrest part.

[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.560]
Them two hula hands was making sure of me.

[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:55.520]
They said my face tattoo looked like an etch of sketch.

[02:08:56.300 --> 02:09:01.860]
I don't know what an etch of sketch is there, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't so knife on the safe.

[02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:07.080]
One of them was about to plug in me with a pipe.

[02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.740]
What was that to do, Dairy?

[02:09:09.740 --> 02:09:14.000]
I mean, I felt the Hulk boiling up over inside of me.

[02:09:14.640 --> 02:09:19.440]
I turned even greener than I did when I was suffering from the vachakism.

[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:24.140]
How does this thing always seem to happen to me, Dairy?

[02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:27.060]
I mean, I need my luck to change.

[02:09:27.580 --> 02:09:32.800]
I applied to be on the big brother show, but Dairy said that I couldn't be.

[02:09:33.360 --> 02:09:37.740]
They sent back my application and said I was too nicoterious.

[02:09:38.760 --> 02:09:41.440]
How dare they call me Nick Sifakarus.

[02:09:41.920 --> 02:09:42.780]
I'm not Greek.

[02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.580]
This has been another page from the audio diary of Mike Tyson.

[02:09:46.800 --> 02:09:47.460]
He's an asshole.

[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:48.320]

[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.360]
Pro 48 at 560 WQM.

[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:52.040]
We just got one of the great faxes in history.

[02:09:52.180 --> 02:09:54.260]
Although, well, yeah, it's in his fax.

[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:56.280]
Before we get to that, two things.

[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:58.340]
Number one, the Marine Dowd column he just faxed me.

[02:09:58.380 --> 02:09:59.240]
It's on our website today.

[02:09:59.480 --> 02:09:59.800]
Oh, sorry.

[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:01.660]
Next up, the gate of Orsay.

[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:03.120]
Okay.

[02:10:03.380 --> 02:10:04.200]
Thanks anyway, Elmer.

[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.460]
Not too many people named Elmer.

[02:10:06.460 --> 02:10:07.560]
The blue guy's named Elmer.

[02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:10.180]
Elmer Conrad, remember him from Corridor, Indiana.

[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:10.740]

[02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:12.120]
You do?

[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:12.780]
No.

[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:14.440]
Fiveish Finkel.

[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.100]
Who the hell is Fiveish Finkel?

[02:10:16.980 --> 02:10:17.640]
Some Jew.

[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.240]
Well, seriously, who is that?

[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:20.100]
I'm supposed to know who's the other one.

[02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:21.460]
He's under a Boston public.

[02:10:21.460 --> 02:10:22.620]
He's been in a bunch of things.

[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:23.300]
Oh.

[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.620]
I don't think enough people know Fiveish Finkel.

[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:26.920]
Okay.

[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:29.060]
It's kind of Fiveish Sixish.

[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:31.840]
But this is a great fax.

[02:10:32.140 --> 02:10:32.740]
And it says.

[02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:36.720]
And by the way, you got to keep your eye on Beanyr Boy and Eric.

[02:10:36.920 --> 02:10:37.580]
Every moment.

[02:10:37.700 --> 02:10:41.060]
If you look away for a second, it's just, uh, they're just not cutting it.

[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.400]
Richard Simmons, how long ago did we mention that?

[02:10:44.460 --> 02:10:44.740]
And I said, absolutely.

[02:10:45.540 --> 02:10:46.920]
I even played the Richard Simmons bit.

[02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.340]
Is it on there?

[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:50.980]
No.

[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:51.440]
No.

[02:10:53.420 --> 02:10:55.640]
And Bruce Villain, even though you said nobody knows who that is,

[02:10:55.680 --> 02:10:56.220]
I think he belonged.

[02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:58.740]
Enough people have seen him on Hollywood Square as soon as fruitcake.

[02:10:59.220 --> 02:11:00.220]
Let's get him on there too.

[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:01.060]
You got it, Beanyr Boy.

[02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:01.980]
Can you handle this or not?

[02:11:01.980 --> 02:11:03.880]
I think it's the last Bruce, Bruce who?

[02:11:04.660 --> 02:11:06.640]
VLanche, V-I-L-A-N-C-H.

[02:11:06.940 --> 02:11:11.440]
You've seen her screaming wild queen with a yellow wig.

[02:11:11.860 --> 02:11:12.440]
That's a wig.

[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:14.240]
Fat, tubby, whatever it is.

[02:11:14.380 --> 02:11:14.900]
I don't want to know.

[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:16.180]
I'll let you find out.

[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:18.260]
I'll let the freaky car was, uh, check it out.

[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:20.460]
Bruce Villain and Richard Simmons.

[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:21.880]
How come are she Simmons ain't on there?

[02:11:22.300 --> 02:11:23.620]
Is that one of Eric's things again?

[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:25.820]
I don't know if I'm not right now.

[02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:28.700]
Get those queens both on it.

[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:29.840]
Anyway, the fax was on to say.

[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:31.600]
They should both be definitely on the pool.

[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:33.740]
I can't stand those screaming silly faggots,

[02:11:33.760 --> 02:11:37.480]
which is why I made a comment I did yesterday about the big pride parade they hit her on Sunday.

[02:11:37.820 --> 02:11:39.440]
I don't know why he didn't go out and get involved.

[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:41.080]
I didn't even look at it.

[02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.660]
I mean, more power to all of those people,

[02:11:43.660 --> 02:11:45.640]
but why do you have to go out there a lot of you

[02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:47.360]
of mincing and the prancing around, you know?

[02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:49.560]
It says, I'll never understand it.

[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:51.960]
I'm gay, which means I've attracted a men in masculine behavior.

[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.860]
Why would I want a surrogate woman?

[02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:54.820]
I want a man.

[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:55.880]
Now you're talking.

[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.840]
Just like Tom Brady.

[02:11:57.840 --> 02:11:59.020]
There's a real man.

[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:02.640]
Just like all the queens who drive around

[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:05.220]
Wilton Manners with their rainbow stickers and leather pride flags.

[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:06.100]
Newsflash.

[02:12:06.420 --> 02:12:08.240]
Nobody cares about your orgasm,

[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:09.920]
except Rich's and Tourmangerie Falwell,

[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:10.740]
and they're just desperate.

[02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:12.620]
Excellent facts. Thank you very much.

[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:15.940]
Couldn't agree with him more.

[02:12:17.360 --> 02:12:19.100]
Maybe Donnie the WizKid.

[02:12:19.180 --> 02:12:20.140]
Maybe he cared. The quiz kid.

[02:12:20.260 --> 02:12:21.240]
Whatever he was. The Jizz kid.

[02:12:21.860 --> 02:12:22.780]
Maybe he cares about it.

[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:25.580]
Mike Tyson 106.

[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:27.400]
He's pulling away, man.

[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.260]
He's got the actor burners on.

[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.340]
Friend Resher 92.

[02:12:31.900 --> 02:12:33.360]
Barbara Streisand 52.

[02:12:34.300 --> 02:12:35.720]
Jim J. Bullock 33.

[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:37.340]
Yeah, let's get those other queens on.

[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:38.320]
They give him some competition.

[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:39.720]
Who's those numbers up there?

[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:42.480]
567-0560.

[02:12:43.140 --> 02:12:44.660]
Can you believe it's almost one o'clock?

[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:46.300]
And we got that one to two hours during this in the push?

[02:12:46.580 --> 02:12:48.620]
Can't wait. God damn it.

[02:12:49.620 --> 02:12:50.840]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:52.040]
Hello, Neil.

[02:12:52.420 --> 02:12:52.760]
Yes, sir.

[02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:53.840]
How you doing today?

[02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:54.600]
Pretty good.

[02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:56.820]
Listen, I was down to stadium.

[02:12:57.180 --> 02:12:59.160]
You may be buying forl breakfast, my man.

[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:01.660]
It's almost a sellout down there.

[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:02.440]
Yeah.

[02:13:02.980 --> 02:13:03.500]
For tonight.

[02:13:04.320 --> 02:13:06.060]
And if you would do me a favor and talk about it.

[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.760]
Wait a minute. Why don't we go a little bit beyond this?

[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:11.740]
Tonight, they're having a free fireworks show.

[02:13:12.420 --> 02:13:12.620]
Right.

[02:13:13.360 --> 02:13:13.540]
Yeah.

[02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.380]
But I heard you this morning.

[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:18.040]
Forl came here and see the whole year.

[02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:20.080]
Well, I see. So in other words,

[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:22.240]
if they sell out on a day they would have sold out anyway.

[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:24.540]
I'm supposed to like to build a mstatch who is at it.

[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:26.840]
I don't know. He's crazy. Maybe.

[02:13:27.080 --> 02:13:28.560]
Well, I know he's crazy. We know that.

[02:13:28.620 --> 02:13:29.920]
That's what we like about him. He's crazy.

[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.900]
But that's beside the point.

[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:32.960]
You serious there? Almost a sellout already?

[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:34.520]
Yeah. I was down there.

[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:36.560]
Well, how do you know that? They told me that?

[02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:38.400]
They openly up for deck too, as well.

[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:39.280]
Yeah.

[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:43.040]
Well, I had friends at Salt Lake Run have 60,000 people there tonight.

[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:43.380]
Excellent.

[02:13:43.500 --> 02:13:44.620]
I wouldn't go that far.

[02:13:46.060 --> 02:13:47.200]
But third, man.

[02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:52.080]
Well, if he can do it more power to a mobile mstatch you.

[02:13:52.080 --> 02:13:53.740]
All right. If you could talk to Hank.

[02:13:54.760 --> 02:13:58.260]
I'm going to get the Shimata rag out and take it a little easy on the Marlin.

[02:13:58.820 --> 02:13:59.040]
Okay.

[02:13:59.480 --> 02:14:01.240]
What is that? What does that mean?

[02:14:01.500 --> 02:14:02.460]
What are you talking about?

[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:06.120]
Well, he does it. He's not an optimist. He's a pessimist.

[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:09.640]
You know, I mean, people call him up to talk about baseball.

[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:13.360]
And as soon as you want to talk about it, maybe a trade or something happening,

[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:14.460]
he says the finger point.

[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:18.220]
Well, call him up and tell him about it. Don't call me and give me instructions on what Hank ought to talk about.

[02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:20.720]
Call him up and tell him about it and see how many seconds.

[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:21.900]
Count the seconds you'll be on.

[02:14:21.900 --> 02:14:22.780]
About third, man.

[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:23.260]
Or less.

[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:26.200]
Now, Hank's been around. He knows what it's all about.

[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:32.260]
He's been through the Wayne business and the John Henry business and the David Sampson and Delilah business and all the stuff we're going through.

[02:14:32.500 --> 02:14:35.740]
And you know, they were going through this little period of euphoria right now.

[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:38.380]
And it's the holidays and they're having a big fourth of July fireworks.

[02:14:38.860 --> 02:14:42.080]
Let's see on the next home stand after this next couple of weeks on the road trip.

[02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:44.600]
Let's see then. I'm not trying to pee on their parade.

[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:46.340]
But I will say this to you.

[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:52.280]
If you think that, you know, if we get a bunch more people start showing up that the rest of us are going to start supporting public money for a stadium.

[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:52.960]
You're dreaming.

[02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:55.240]
You're whistling. Dixie because that's not going to happen.

[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:01.160]
So selfish, selfish, pathetic thing that a small handful of people want the rest of us to subsidize.

[02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:05.760]
And it's not going to happen just like the guy from Pittsburgh said before they build a new stadium.

[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:11.660]
And then after on flies and now they have to find all kinds of ways to tax the public to try to find the funds to pay for it.

[02:15:12.060 --> 02:15:14.000]
When the hell is the party stop already?

[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:19.620]
But anyway, I mean, I know George is pretty whipped up about it.

[02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:22.080]
Good God. I have no idea which is having the past five minutes.

[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:25.080]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:15:30.420 --> 02:15:33.520]
I want you to tell Hank to give him some slack.

[02:15:35.660 --> 02:15:36.960]
Whatever that baseball team's name is.

[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:38.480]
What does that mean? Take his belt out of notch?

[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:40.560]
Tell him well from what you been telling me.

[02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:43.920]
And the last time I was there, you notice he was conspicuous by his actions.

[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.120]
I realized you don't come on to four and I'm out of there right at two o'clock.

[02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:52.300]
But ordinarily in the past, the couple of times he's coming a little bit early so that we could bond for a couple of minutes.

[02:15:52.300 --> 02:15:55.400]
And you know, just a shmoo's a little rip moan ass.

[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:59.940]
But he didn't come by because you've been making comments about how he's still a big as a house.

[02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:04.320]
Shame on you, George. That was shame on you.

[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:08.260]
Yeah, it was you. Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello.

[02:16:08.640 --> 02:16:10.060]
And you always apply for mine.

[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.840]
It is. We'll crack two ideas for your poll.

[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:16.180]
Yes. Ellen DeGeneres and Michael Jackson.

[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.000]
Yeah, but what is Michael?

[02:16:19.340 --> 02:16:22.660]
Okay, he just hung up. What is Michael Jackson the stereotype of besides the freak?

[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:27.680]
Yeah, huh? He's not a stereotype of anything black because he's not even he's not even light mocha anymore.

[02:16:27.860 --> 02:16:31.020]
And Ellen DeGeneres, she's a she's a stereotypical dyke.

[02:16:31.620 --> 02:16:33.600]
I don't think so. Whatever.

[02:16:34.380 --> 02:16:37.280]
No, if I was going to put a stereotypical dyke on there, I'd put Rosie.

[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:38.640]
What's wrong with Rosie O'Donnell? Right.

[02:16:39.040 --> 02:16:40.280]
Let's get her ass on there.

[02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:43.500]
Rosie. No, not Jenna Reno. Come on.

[02:16:43.740 --> 02:16:45.960]
Oh, it's a good point. No, not Jenna Reno.

[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:48.920]
If I have to pick one Rosie O'Donnell.

[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:53.120]
Okay. Okay. I mean, the poster child.

[02:16:53.380 --> 02:16:55.800]
Right. She's the poster child from big up now. She's dykes.

[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:59.640]
There's no quick doubt about that. I mean, making all these aspersions about the Janet.

[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:05.480]
Although there are a couple of chapters in the Hillary book about the things that the two of them did together, but that's beside the point.

[02:17:06.240 --> 02:17:10.420]
We'll save those for the for all show. The game's almost a sellout for all did it.

[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:14.640]
You got Don trail tonight. You got the fireworks show.

[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:16.700]
Marlins one 20 to one last night.

[02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:19.240]
Let's go out there and fill a joint. What do you say?

[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:23.880]
I know George and Vena more going to be out there buying pain for their own tickets.

[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:24.900]
Miguel's going to be there.

[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:28.720]
Whole station probably be there except of course, remote from the war out of town.

[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:31.300]
Only if they get me in the pool.

[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.800]
Yeah, only if he can get laid in the pool. That's the whole deal going out there.

[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:38.680]
Just like the for all people. They're not going out there for the Marlins or for the ballgame. Let's face it.

[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:43.120]
I mean, he's getting them out there by giving the tickets away. They're going out there to have an orgy. Great. No problem.

[02:17:44.120 --> 02:17:49.000]
And of course, the last time we talked about that and he had one of his nights out there. Do you remember the episode the next day?

[02:17:49.380 --> 02:17:53.860]
And but I beat that about the moment they're having closed door meetings and, you know.

[02:17:55.420 --> 02:17:58.140]
They thought that what's his name with their Tony Dow looking for beaver.

[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:04.900]
I'm serious. A little bit of a problem with some of the sluts got arrested. A big, a big scene over there.

[02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:09.300]
So let's just try to keep a little bit on it. Not how many people is the limit getting busted in the game tonight.

[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:14.100]
But 30 minutes. Okay, we can handle that. But over that it's going to be a mess and they're going to get all psychotic and better to shape.

[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:18.800]
Let's try to tone it down just a notch or two. That's all not like coma, but just a notch or two.

[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:24.380]
As we get really Marlin intensive on QAM all Marlins all day.

[02:18:24.380 --> 02:18:27.720]
We can get we can break a one share in the next book on the minus side.

[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:31.580]
1256 at 560 WQM. Here's something good for you.

[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:35.660]
Oliomid. I'm popping some every morning. I religiously pop it in my purse.

[02:18:36.180 --> 02:18:39.220]
Oliomid soft shells contain the finest olive oil you've ever had in your body.

[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:42.620]
Not just ordinary olive oil, but super concentrated low with health benefits too.

[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:45.420]
In fact, Clarence and Abistavid using it for some amazing things.

[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:48.580]
Oliomid every day can produce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol.

[02:18:48.580 --> 02:18:52.220]
There are 14 different Oliomid formulas you can choose from.

[02:18:52.220 --> 02:18:55.400]
Each one combining the finest olive oil, like I said only moments ago,

[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:58.280]
with vitamins, minerals and herbals to support specific health needs

[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.900]
from your bones to your blood pressure to your immune system.

[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.800]
Just pick out the formulas that are right for you.

[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:06.740]
Now there are three new Oliomid formulas. One to help you sleep, one to help you control your weight,

[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:10.840]
and CoQ10, self-Q10 for your heart. Pick up some Oliomid today

[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:13.860]
while you're out prusing around doing your shopping because just about everybody's carrying it.

Now you'll find that public's, records, Walgreens, whole food markets,

[02:19:17.440 --> 02:19:20.760]
Navarro's and Sedanos, who order it online if you like Oliomidamerican.com.

[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.560]

Why in local, here sports video 560s, you a-u-a-summit.

[02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:42.760]
Hey, I'm Frao, Iliomidamerican.

[02:19:45.200 --> 02:19:48.980]
I like scrubbing my smelly grilla ass with salt made from juice

[02:19:48.980 --> 02:19:53.160]
and listening to the new Roge Amunista Hour.

[02:19:53.500 --> 02:19:53.980]
Take iron!

[02:19:54.740 --> 02:19:57.760]
Welcome to another edition of Inside Life with Sporthold.

[02:19:58.880 --> 02:20:01.400]
Dray Stan nasal mist is our guest today.

[02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:05.840]
Yelp Dre, yo, what do you have to say about your admirers who are obsessed

[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:12.820]
and worship you in every way and base their intellect and entire existence on your ability to catch a ball?

[02:20:12.960 --> 02:20:16.640]
I don't know what I've been told, but a big-legged woman ain't got no thought.

[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:20.840]
What's your take on the over and under and the under of the over of the underwear?

[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:25.920]
I don't know what I've been told, but a big-legged woman ain't got no thought.

[02:20:26.260 --> 02:20:34.300]
And what's your take on those rumors flying around that you're articulate enough to replace Michael Jordan on those MCI spots?

[02:20:34.300 --> 02:20:37.520]
They say you're getting close to signing that contract.

[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:41.600]
I don't know what I've been told, but a big-legged woman ain't got no thought.

[02:20:41.960 --> 02:20:51.940]
Tell us more about your charitable work for underprivileged children helping to improve their mathematics skills through showing them how to properly weigh crack rock.

[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:56.420]
I don't know what I've been told, but a big-legged woman ain't got no thought.

[02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.980]
Mmm, we'll be back with more Inside Life with Sporthold.

[02:21:01.980 --> 02:21:06.900]
Coming up tonight, on Inside the Behind the True Hollywood Celebrity Music Biography Profile Story,

[02:21:07.320 --> 02:21:13.000]
you may not know who the Rembrads are, but they wrote the theme song for the most popular sitcom on television.

[02:21:13.580 --> 02:21:15.440]
No, no, not according to Jim.

[02:21:16.160 --> 02:21:16.540]
Friend!

[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:23.300]
Oh man, come on!

[02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:30.660]
Do you realize how many times on how many TVs in how many markets our song gets played every f*** day?

[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:32.880]
Rembrads co-founder Phil Sulemon.

[02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:35.500]
How long would you say we've been talking now, 30 seconds?

[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:40.480]
In that 30 seconds I have just made enough to pay for three more hores!

[02:21:41.320 --> 02:21:44.660]
Be right there, my little biological receptor!

[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:51.260]
Yes, although the Rembrads have no real talent, they make roughly $50,000 every seven minutes.

[02:21:51.260 --> 02:21:56.400]
In layman's terms, that's enough for 866,000 hores a year.

[02:21:56.840 --> 02:22:00.400]
And I'm not talking skanky hores either. These are the top of the line hores.

[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:04.300]
There is nothing Phil and I like better than channel surfing.

[02:22:04.600 --> 02:22:11.280]
Rembrads other co-founder, Danny Wilde, describes how he and Phil Sulemon spend hours with the remote calculating their earnings.

[02:22:12.380 --> 02:22:14.240]

[02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:40.940]
You'll get man's mouth again!

[02:22:46.700 --> 02:22:48.080]
I eat like a man!

[02:22:48.600 --> 02:22:51.600]
Meat makes you grow up bigger and strong, like Neil.

[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:53.940]

I think our body's here on the wrong plate.

[02:23:21.520 --> 02:23:22.480]
Oh, this is cool.

[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:28.800]
And if you think they're that bad, I'm sorry, you wouldn't think you're like a flyer when a swat away.

[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:29.760]
Get out of here!

[02:23:30.700 --> 02:23:32.640]

You only talk about men.

[02:23:55.960 --> 02:23:57.920]
I don't know what to do anymore.

[02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:04.440]

[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:52.520]
Hello, miss Peterson. Yes, hi, this Bob Williams down at sores Bob's boss. Oh, hi. How are you? How are you today? Fine?

[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:58.580]
Are you sitting down? Yes, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you. What do you mean bad?

[02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:05.720]
I understand that Bob's been with us for almost 20 years now and Bob's okay, isn't he? Oh Bob's fine

[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:11.920]
A little upset but fine. He's been a good worker for us. He's made all his quotas his bonuses have always been in line

[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:14.700]
But we're gonna have to let him go

[02:30:16.080 --> 02:30:18.280]
We're gonna have to fire him and

[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:22.400]
Unfortunately being the boss sometimes you have to do things that you're not very pleased doing

[02:30:22.400 --> 02:30:23.800]
Very fair

[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:27.160]
Yes, he has

[02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:34.320]
I can imagine you're failing that way absolutely, but feeling that way you don't understand

[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:35.020]
Baby

[02:30:35.020 --> 02:30:46.360]
I fully agree with you, but there's something is happened down here at the office that that we can't overlook

[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:50.360]
It's an it's an image problem and a problem that you might want to address yourself

[02:30:51.320 --> 02:30:55.080]
Um, I don't know quite how to tell you though. Why are you firing him?

[02:30:55.980 --> 02:30:56.360]
Um

[02:30:59.460 --> 02:31:04.000]
It's a little delicate unfortunately we found him on top of his desk making love to his secretary

[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:08.820]
I'm about son of a bitch. Well, I can understand you're being upset at this point, but

[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:13.620]
The word that stupid rotten son of a bitch. I can't believe this well

[02:31:14.040 --> 02:31:15.680]
He's gonna need your support through this

[02:31:16.740 --> 02:31:22.340]
All right right now. He's on his way home to you and he's got another thing coming when he gets from

I'm gonna change the locks on the door. I'm so excited on the front one

[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:30.460]
I'm not even gonna be here when he gets back

[02:31:30.460 --> 02:31:34.340]
That's the front of a bitch and now now I don't feel so bad about

[02:31:35.640 --> 02:31:40.180]

Don't look for my name look for a different name you might have deleted it thinking it was spam

[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:38.460]
I'm not gonna say what it is because that's why you're talking about I send it to you from a different my personal email address

[02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:40.020]

Oh gosh, look at the twerk, though.

[02:38:20.500 --> 02:38:22.000]
Gay watch. Tonight.

[02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:30.600]
Well, my name is Gary Condon, and I am living my worst beer.

[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:37.220]
Because I banged one of my interns, and then she went and just fell on beer.

[02:38:39.540 --> 02:38:42.760]
Oh shunned really worth a price.

[02:38:42.800 --> 02:38:45.940]
So in a pirate's open time, I'm high,

[02:38:46.460 --> 02:38:50.820]
And I was open shunned a huff, and heard instead of my wife.

[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:52.120]
All right.

[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:02.720]
Oh wow, oh wow, oh wow.

[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:06.880]
Hope, and Shandra, hope, and Shandra.

Hope, and Shandra, yeah.

[02:39:15.980 --> 02:39:17.440]
And I bleed about more.

[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:28.420]
Back in the day when someones are strong,

[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:31.120]
we didn't take their cry.

[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:32.320]
Yeah, no, no, no.

[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:38.320]
In Pearl Harbor, where the jams drop their bonds, we bomb them back.

[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.980]
And now the Saudis, they in us hard.

[02:39:42.420 --> 02:39:45.020]
And on our cards, our little flags wave.

[02:39:45.980 --> 02:39:51.880]
As that Saudi-loving, retired, points of bombers the wrong way.

[02:39:54.380 --> 02:39:55.040]
Absolutely.

[02:39:55.040 --> 02:40:02.580]
And on embarrassed to be in Americans, where they follow books like cheese.

[02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:08.240]
The United States of Americans, led by Bush and his family,

[02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:10.100]
breathing at this country.

[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:15.280]
Up, and the lengthores to the darkest days in history.

[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:24.220]
I don't want to be a tax America in the goddamn USA.

[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:32.900]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:35.560]
Stop living in the past.

[02:40:36.600 --> 02:40:42.500]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.

[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:49.080]
If the greatest country in the world, they train us to believe.

[02:40:49.640 --> 02:40:57.680]
In anyone who says that, obviously, and before to leave.

[02:41:00.220 --> 02:41:07.140]
And on embarrassed to be in America, where we pay triadly please.

[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:10.460]
Wave a flag and what asked with our head in the sand,

[02:41:10.720 --> 02:41:13.260]
that blindly follow the powers that be.

[02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:14.140]
Habitat ticked.

[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:15.140]
Fuck off.

[02:41:16.100 --> 02:41:20.220]
Watching state reviews on a 65-inch screen.

[02:41:21.180 --> 02:41:22.580]
Scratch your balls and fire.

[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:24.340]
Everything's okay.

[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:28.460]
In the goddamn USA.

[02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:31.020]
I'll push America.

[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:34.620]
You emailed me at the other address.

[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:35.700]
That's why I didn't have that email.

[02:41:36.080 --> 02:41:36.660]
Oh, sorry.

[02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:37.720]
You're catching me off guard.

[02:41:37.880 --> 02:41:38.220]
That's okay.

[02:41:38.220 --> 02:41:39.580]
You just trying to catch me off guard.

[02:41:39.800 --> 02:41:40.040]
I know that.

[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:41.120]
I saw a gaslight.

[02:41:41.320 --> 02:41:42.300]
I saw a gaslight.

[02:41:42.460 --> 02:41:45.360]
I didn't see punch-drunk love yet, though, but here's another facts.

[02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:47.520]
Well, we had a whole bunch of people.

[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:48.860]
That's where you were out sick yesterday.

[02:41:49.360 --> 02:41:51.440]
We were at him, Sandler was doing pretty well on our pool.

[02:41:52.020 --> 02:41:53.360]
People would keep you away from a movie.

[02:41:53.580 --> 02:41:56.000]
But we had a whole bunch.

[02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:56.580]
I would say.

[02:41:56.660 --> 02:41:57.520]
Fuck third man.

[02:41:57.700 --> 02:41:58.360]
People call him in sand.

[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:00.980]
Oh, even if you don't like Adam Sandler, you'll end up being a boy.

[02:42:01.040 --> 02:42:01.760]
I also saw it, didn't you?

[02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:04.480]
Haven't seen it, but people made it less frustrating.

[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:06.880]
Maybe it was a faso that saw it at the beast.

[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:08.340]
Punch-drunk love.

[02:42:08.340 --> 02:42:10.020]
It's from Paul Thomas Anderson.

[02:42:10.220 --> 02:42:11.060]
So now it's got to be great.

[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:15.400]
Director Writer of Boogie Nights and Magnolia, which George admits is the best movie ever made.

[02:42:15.640 --> 02:42:17.440]
My, my, and lo-ho.

[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:19.620]
This is Fort Real High School.

[02:42:21.240 --> 02:42:22.040]
