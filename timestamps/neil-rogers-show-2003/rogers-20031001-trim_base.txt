But every time I walk in there his face turns blue good Gurgley myster. He knows how much I can put away food and booze

[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.040]
Well, I'm gonna change my name to Neil Gurgley

[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.420]
Hey, that would work. I love that name. Hey, uh, goodly man. Only I'm a sports station

[00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.220]
Can you have something named Gurgley? Hey, did you hear about the Boston sports rider that came out yesterday?

[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.920]
Yeah, I have a good one here. I have the story right here man. I could say you got it right here

[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.380]
Yeah, I got it right here. I'm gonna read it. I'm like listen to what's he so mad about?

[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.660]
He thinks everybody's a homo fault and everybody's out to get him or something. He's listening to your show a lot

[00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.020]

[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.520]
Well, then he's like anyway, I have a real dilemma today

[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.140]
We're gonna take a preliminary pool on it because Moe is like going to such great lengths now to reach out

[00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.320]
He's like extending the hand the gland of friendship to us and I just I don't know because it's almost like too much too soon

[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.620]
You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, it's tough for me. I think it's I think it's your fault because you've turned on

[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.780]
I'm so much. I think he's like reaching out the last person he can

[00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.700]
Well, look at me funny. It's simple. I see him every day and you don't have to and so I

[00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.540]
I've done everything I can to be cool to this guy. I've known him for years. I've told you many times

[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.920]
You know, I can't force him to be

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.240]
Cool, I can't force him to not be the way he is. I mean, nobody knows how he is Christ. Well, what is the way he is?

[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.440]
I've been trying to say well you know the fact you love me to start saying stuff the bottom line is that

[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.960]
Let's just say it gets under people's skin. Yeah, and he's good at it

[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.840]
And you know what? Doesn't face me one way or the other coated John Holmes. He got under people's skin. It's a big d's

[00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.660]
Yeah, no, I think I think

[00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.660]
Is glad I'm living in what's his name? What's his name that's playing John Holmes in this movie? What's his name for out anyway?

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.880]
Oh, seriously, what the hell's uh, you know, I didn't know you're talking about the John Holmes movie

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.840]
I didn't know there was a new portal. He was he played in he played Batman

[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.180]
You know, the guy played Jim Morrison in the doors movie about killer about killer. That's right

[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.860]
He plays him and I liked him in salt and sea. I saw yesterday on a regency. He looked like Jesus. He was fab with a beard

[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.440]
Just John Holmes a little clippet of John Holmes thing and from the from the crotch up. He looked just like him

[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.320]

[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.620]
Go for it. Well, I don't know that way, but I can tell you the reason my favorite I got down to John Holmes model

[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.800]
Maybe he's got something really surprising for you. Yeah, you know, I should get my girlfriend a John Holmes model and strap that on the end of my missile

[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.460]

[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.860]
Oh no, no, I think that maybe you're like looking for the old. Oh, I forgot to play bend over yesterday

[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.160]
Let me just say this lastly to you. I know that we talked yesterday about Danny heavey wrecking the car now you were like

[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.340]
He was drunk dude. There's no doubt and they're gonna cover up his blood out all tests for five weeks

[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.560]
That's the dumbest thing I've heard and they didn't know anything about Buckhead knows they were out drinking

[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.160]
It was two in the morning they're driving a Ferrari nine miles an hour. Yeah, they have limited amounts of alcohol on a

[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.180]
It's a bunch of both crap then snider or whatever the kids then what's the other kids name?

[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:17.680]
He's brain dead now. He's in a coma. Is he really brain dead? Yeah, he's in a coma. Oh my but they're saying that uh, you know, I yesterday

[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.140]
I was I guess today is that your vengeance on the trashers. No, it isn't right. I love the trashers

[00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.540]
I want them to win, but you can't blame me because they were out at two in the morning drunk driving a Ferrari nine miles

[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.720]
And I was the stationery. Did you work for the team? I was for the Turner sports was shown in the team

[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.420]
They don't own them anymore. They saw them for this is this is for us vengeance on the team

[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.300]
You're high here wrong. I hope that Danny healy dies my vengeance was simple

[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.960]
Let me explain it so you can clear this up. Yeah, I got paid for four years. I worked for one. There's your vengeance

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.600]
I kind of nice deal Neal. I'm not stupid. I can all relate to it. That's a deal deal. I paid from PAX and that is a new deal

[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.820]
I'm like your Neil deal working today. Oh my the Humper has got the best deal

[00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.940]
You notice how Hank is like off every day. It's off the whole week long and none of it is vacation time hammer

[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.220]
I like hammer so he's got a set one I asked him for out in John thing. It's and he said he just couldn't get him

[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.480]
Yeah, I love the hammer though. He's he's the best you know, I you keep saying that with the Howard job

[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.940]
I really rather do after news who the hell wants to talk sports in the freaking morning job is at it

[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.500]
Yeah, who's job you really want? Let's put it right out there in the table

[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.740]
I think if I was on before the games I'd make the stationery lot more money than talking about him in the morning

[00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.580]
Yeah, I think people that talk sports in the morning are depressing

[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.680]
I think people to talk about him right before the game or right after make money

[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:37.380]
I did a syndicated show and I was successful. I was on right out. I was happy to be out in John's ticket to yeah

[00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.000]
Okay, have a nice day Neil

[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.620]
See you

[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:50.420]

Got the white I put on a fresh look at this before I realized I get a tiny cake

[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.580]
Absolutely walled-dead seat

[00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.320]
Countless

[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.020]
I had sold a bacon that I saw this morning

[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.100]

[00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.360]

I got a diaper ready

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.180]
That's why I wear baggy veil

[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.360]
I need the room for more time

[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.700]
I got a diaper ready

[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.440]
The diaper's on my when I was control

[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.820]
You can hear the crud when I scratch my whole neck

[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.440]
I scream on a little bowling bar

[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.480]
Under the flat for my school

[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.120]
Out from my pain time you're in some trips

[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.160]
You'll be so much trouble of the way you do

[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.820]
Dear Mo, just put a rubber band around your balls like this

[00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.500]
Now

[00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:31.820]
There was only one thing I get to do

[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:32.700]
My ass

[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.820]
I get the diaper ready

[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.560]
Okay

[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.500]
I put a pillow on the back

[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.960]
Under his back and now I feel so romantic

[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.500]
You're my moment for you

[00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.600]
But you like so much joy

[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.020]
10.07 at 5.60 wqa. I'm happy Wednesday to it's our big Wednesday extra

[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.260]
We got that gigantic one in two hour which will really be good because it can be a chance to watch some of the Yankee twins game is the Yankees go down

[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.760]
Like I told you Scott they're going down down down down

[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.080]
Get out down and out

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.440]
And not in Beverly Hills either

[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:31.260]
It's a beautiful thing and then of course you can hear the the gasping choking sounds from Atlanta. Can't you hear them?

[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.560]
I can same ones that you hear just about every year at this time choking squeezing

[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:38.120]
Crappin they're done

[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.920]
They'll be out I think the cup will be them in three straight now

[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.160]
So we got the twins in the Yankees at one o'clock which won't be on the year but I'll be watching it

[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.100]
We'll do like a little play by play again like yesterday

[00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:54.240]
Marlon Zondecdo follows the mad dog another short show for the mad dog and no show for the hopper always

[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.300]
But I'm a real man we're on the wrong time slot you know what oh yeah, I know let us start looking at these schedules

[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.780]
The beginning of the season and figure out what time we want to be on

[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:10.340]
You know the Yankee games tomorrow. Oh it's not today. No, they have a day off. Well, what kind of a schedule is that?

[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:16.520]
We got the A's in the Red Sox today, but that's not till 10 o'clock tonight. Well, that's where it is. Oh

[00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.180]
Jesus

[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:22.860]
Ah mad dog two to three thirty Marlon Zondec three thirty Marlon's and the ad Giants in frisco again 406

[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.260]
It's a must win because if they don't win this one, it's basically over right wouldn't you agree with that? Yes

[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.440]
10th inning playoff special would lamb Casper and Tommy Hutton at the 730

[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.600]
Cubs at the braves and like I said you can hear those gurgly sounds from

[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.860]
Atlanta at eight thirty night at a key follows the game

[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:43.240]
Joe and Mark overnight and Joe Castello is going to be out in our QM van tomorrow noon to two. Oh my god

[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.740]
explanation on that whole thing and what's that but that noon till whatever thing

[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:53.240]
They're only required to be there or whatever for an hour, but Miguel said here's the deal and I think it's a good idea

[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.540]
Well, let me require whatever whatever is that we all they made the company just wait a minute

[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:04.200]
So if they don't make five hundred they don't have to stay there the whole two hours if it turns out to be a lame location

[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.920]
They can pick up and go somewhere else

[00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:13.140]
Right for about five minutes for another hour every few minutes if there isn't like a whole bunch of people

[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.260]
They'll just pick up and go someplace else now we'll put it on a year and then by the time anybody gets there

[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.420]
They'll be one of another place that sounds good. Okay, they can keep chasing the van around yeah, just keep

[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.780]
Well, you remember how like in previous years they would go to a location

[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:30.920]
We thought it would be a good location and it turned out to be a dud and they were like stuck there

[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:36.880]
So right way he's not gonna be stuck in Atlanta and those days it would be like they would start like a 10 30 or 11 o'clock in the morning

[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.540]
And we had like generally during the entire show now it's a different start when you start at noon

[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.780]
There's not like really time to be grouped and pick up and go to a second place. I don't think I don't think so

[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.000]
Well McGell on his way out of here this morning say if he does five hundred dollars in the first hour

[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.240]
He'll stay another hour

[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.560]
Well, what do you mean on his way out of here this morning? He's not doing anything today. No, it is way out of the studio

[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.680]
vio

[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.120]
If he does five hundred dollars the first hour he'll stay another hour

[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.400]
Well, what kind of a deal is that so what if he does like four sixty? Well come on. We're not gonna split hairs

[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.280]
Not seriously if he does four hundred the first hour like maybe people are a whole bunch of people on a way

[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.520]
They're to get there for the second hour and he might have another six hundred to second hour

[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.120]
And he's gonna leave because he didn't do five hundred what kind of a deal is that just a game

[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.180]
Listen, it's kind of like we're jerkin as difficult as it is to raise money for charity this year

[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.760]
This is gonna be one of the toughest years in a long time

[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.740]
To be jerkin the public around like that and say well

[00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.200]
Will be there from noon to two if you show up and if not like when you get there

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.000]
I'll probably be gone

[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:38.840]
What's he got going he can do the rain before noon? Okay two or three times

[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.940]
With his potent the penis he can he can do her two or three times

[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.340]
Jesus we've her laying gasping for oxygen right there on a guy

[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:51.780]
They in promotion room floor and then head on out of there and they go do something productive for a couple of hours

[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.600]
Take a little breather

[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.860]
Take a respite from that bitch

[00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.300]
Right

[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.020]
Yeah, sure no one wouldn't you be parked off if you sit up like 20 till two if you drove from like homestead

[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:08.100]
I'll not like we're not gonna save what's going on on the year yeah

[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.180]
Well, suppose you drew all the way from homestead and like two minutes before you got there

[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:18.200]
I came on a year it said oh well it wasn't too good so Miguel took off sure because he's they're gonna drive all the way from homestead

[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.040]
Right or whether that you came from not all of our audiences in pop it all beats thank God

[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.860]
We got a few people on the age of a hundred how many we got 30 man we've got some

[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.600]
I mean, there's nobody lives in pompato beach who isn't at least 90

[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.660]
I tell them not to stand near the window

[00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:09.520]

[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.560]
Is that your real hair? I can assure you it is

[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.320]
I'm not believe you mind if I chat

[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:37.560]
Two potchak win at blow tries out fella try some dipty do I'll be back with some final thoughts after this oh

[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.980]
say 1033 at 560 WQM happy Wednesday to you

[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:47.860]
Uh see I thought when for us talking about dance neither there being in a coma in a way he said it sounded like he was on a verge of dying

[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:52.200]
Uh, when I'd be in a coma seriously not good, but the article here from the

[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.220]
Atlanta urinal constitution says he remains in a coma this morning, but doctors had test so far ruled out serious brain damage

[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:05.380]
His cat scan looked fairly good said doctor Sanjay Gupta. Uh-oh good luck Dan

[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:10.840]
Gupta from CNN that asshole a neurosurgeon who operated on stutter referring to computer brain imaging

[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.240]
It didn't show any significant bleeding

[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:18.940]
He said he also suffered max celebration deceleration which results when I had to suddenly whip forward and backward

[00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:25.540]
Gupta said he was able to take some pressure off stutter's brain during surgery and the coma was partially induced by anesthesia

[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.900]
So there you go. That's a deal. He's uh, he's in a coma, but he's doing just fine. I guess. I don't know

[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.220]
It's not brain dead. He's not brain dead

[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:37.080]
It's speaking of Moa and here's our poll the first poll today

[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.100]
And the reason I'm doing this is because I'm getting all these spirary ports

[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:46.200]
I couldn't hear Mo show this morning because some asshole had the pot turned off and I couldn't hear the audio from the station this morning for some strange reason

[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.680]
Somebody was dicking with stuff. What happened there just before 10 o'clock by the way Scott was that in the other room?

[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:56.120]
I have no idea everything was good here. Why I couldn't hear the audio yet. How to be from the other room?

[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.860]
I think it's that Dan the Robert again

[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.920]
He's probably under a lot of stress because he didn't buy anything for our yum kippur

[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.060]
Like I said yesterday. I'm glad I'm not the only asshole around here. No, no

[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:11.480]
Oh, you got a lot of company fitting like a rubber glove should Neil accept know how it david is overtures of peace and love

[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:14.880]
He's really been sucking up to me big time. What's that line about? I'm his main man now

[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.000]
Well something like that and

[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.380]
He's promoting a hell out of our abandoned pair rescue, which I appreciate. He's a dog lover

[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:27.740]
So we have to give him brownie points for that right? Okay, and he was playing some drops from his keychain

[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.900]
Very excited to get him

[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:36.680]
And he's really bond and tight with you. He we she whipped it out for you in a tea room the other day and his driver's license as well

[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:40.120]
And sure he he was 59 years old and plus a few months couple months

[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.480]
Almost as old as me and almost as old as Hank who's the oldest of me. I wonder how old 80k is

[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.680]
Huh? See Eddie's not vain so he wouldn't be one of those people who wouldn't tell us

[00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:56.720]
Who's the oldest of them all Hank is a let's see June of the July hours of a four months old and I am okay

[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.340]
I'm a year and a half older than Moe which is amazing because I must be in much better shape than his sorry ass

[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:07.060]
He must live the tough life when everybody hates you like stresses you out and what about any cake because there's nobody else

[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:10.980]
I don't think he's got a shot on a year right? I don't I don't think Eddie K is older than not

[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:17.160]
What about the Gurgley man? No, I'm just I just like saying that the Gurgley man the Gurgley man can't you hear that right now?

[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:24.200]
We don't think Eddie K is what older than bed no, I think he's 50 something maybe yeah

[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.060]
He's already 50 now. How do you know that maybe just look the good? Well, he's got a lot of taking a guess

[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:34.720]
No, no, he's probably only 35 just dressed up and all that plunging those professional gamblers man. Oh, just kill you

[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:39.540]
So here's our first pool today should need to accept Moe Howard David's overtures of peace and love

[00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:44.700]
I mean this keeping keeping in mind when you cast your vote on the heels of him desperately trying to get George's ass

[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.260]
Can try to interview with his show and try to make me into a racist like Rush Limbaugh

[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:52.360]
Which we'll get to that story and all this other stuff trying to do everything is power to sandbag us

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:57.200]
Just because of the fact we talked about his checkered pants and pasty ass wig and the fact that show suck

[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.560]
So at any rate, you know, we've had this year and a half now real hostility and deep-seated hate

[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:08.780]
And now all of a sudden just out of nowhere. I don't I don't understand why the effect of for alternate on a real fast

[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:12.180]
He's looking for an ally he continues searching for a friend

[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:19.380]
So here's the five choices should Neil except Moe Howard's overtures of peace and love yes, we need harmony of QAM

[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.260]
Just like I'm passion they're all in harmony

[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:23.020]
Oh

[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.420]
Only if Neil has no self respect

[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.600]
Absolutely not we hate Moe

[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.060]
Who's Moe Howard David and only if Moe paints his bald spot

[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.940]
Those are the five choices

[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:39.940]
What do we got on there so far look at that there's so many votes pilot on there right now it won't even refresh you on here again

[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.720]
Ah, it was refreshing though 65

[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:43.760]
Should

[00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.400]
What is going on with this thing? It's just going crazy

[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.960]
See all we have to do is take any kind of a pull on Moe and it just goes absolutely

[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.420]
Aveshmit they go on us

[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.320]
67 votes

[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:02.000]
Should Neil except Moe Howard David is overtures of peace and love absolutely not we hate Moe 24

[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:07.320]
Only if Neil has no self respect 16 so there's 60% almost right there

[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:10.400]
Only if Moe paints his bald spot 11

[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.880]
Yes, we need harmony of QAM 10 and who's Moe Howard David at six

[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.860]
Not looking to promising is it and of course you know we always abide by the will of the audience don't we oh?

[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:24.480]
Yeah, maybe we'll let this caller from pop it on line six decide for us pomp it oh hello

[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.820]
What is it

[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:29.380]
Yeah

[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:43.980]
Yeah, yeah, that's it that's my call you're jerky in a new life. Oh jerk jerk. I thought you said George jerk jerk jerk jerk jerk

[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.960]
Idiotic jerk. Okay. Thanks asshole

[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:54.000]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT and tanita new life. No my life's pretty damn good to be honest with the pal and I'm sure I have a lot better newers

[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:00.540]
Loser sad pathetic loser who sits around waiting for 20 minutes on hold on some stupid ass talk show

[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:05.040]
So we'd come on the air for like 10 seconds to jerk you need a life jerk. Yeah jerk this

[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.480]
So anyway the a wrestling ball thing you did see that I'm sure about ESPN where he made the comments about Donovan McNebb

[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.440]
No, I didn't see it on in Georgia's favorite quarterbacks

[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:19.300]
Donovan McNabb has been a three-strait pro-balls to consecutive NFC championship games

[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.420]
And was the finalist for the NFL MVP award as first will see to his starter still commentator rush

[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:32.740]
Hermann gearing limbaugh questions his credentials before McNebb led the Eagles to a 22th or 23 13 went over to bills

[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:40.400]
Limbaugh said on ESPN study NFL count on the McNabb is overrated the comment contained racial overtones that set off controversy

[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.560]
Now see most other guys have been fired for things like that who've been like in the you know like Jimmy DeGeek right and

[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:49.200]
People like that outcampanis with the Dodgers

[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.440]
I don't think that

[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:54.840]
That he's been that good from the get go limbaugh said I think what we've had here is a little

[00:32:54.840 --> 00:33:00.120]
Social concern in the NFL the immediate has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well

[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.880]
There's a little hope invested in McNabb

[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:06.260]
And he's got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve the defense carried this team

[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:12.380]
And ESPN spokesman said yesterday that limbaugh doesn't do interviews added that he didn't think the comments were racially biased

[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.840]
It was comparing McNabb's performance on the field was reputation in the media spokesman Dave Nagel said

[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:25.880]
Uh, Nagel said that with limbaugh on the show this season ratings for Sunday NFL count on our up 10% overall and up 26% among the 18 to 34 male demographic

[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.700]
Which shows you there is absolutely no hope for America

[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:34.120]
ESPN hired limbaugh for his passionate his ability to express opinions spark debate as a football fan

[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:40.120]
In just one month he certainly has delivered okay, so basically what he said is this far to ain't so good

[00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.700]
But everybody says he is because he's uh, he's a got a dark skin

[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.100]
Donovan McNabb how do you like that?

[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.440]
And probably don't have invoked the democratic too, so Russia hates him like poison

[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.980]
20 to 11 at 5 60 don't forget we have the official marlin's watch party again today

[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.160]
Hopefully with the better result than yesterday. It was a pretty tense game

[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.260]
Giants had a scratch out a couple of runs to win it

[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:04.400]
But they could have gone either way so anyway, we got the big watch party this afternoon

[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:09.040]
330 a chula steak two and Miami Lakes Billy the Marlin Marlin Mermaids interactive pitching games will be there

[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.280]
One who makes the third rock that I got

[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.680]
Two bare soul said Jenny keeps the rock

[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.760]
We said have a little now I have a lot

[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.280]
The metal movie was a din my dime stop

[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.020]
I just serve every rock that I got

[00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:08.420]
No way they stay Jenny keeps the rock

[00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.380]
But the stomach has put thin and hot

[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.940]
The metal where I go I have a movie rocks

[00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:15.860]
Once was married to a dancer Chris Judd

[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.540]
He was a dud

[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.320]
His diamond was smaller as a stud

[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.580]
Now the weddings or plan

[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:23.400]
I'm alone if it's true this two carat sewing

[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.920]
Get Tiffany's on the phone

[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.800]
Don't you see?

[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.980]
And don't be worried, don't need no pity

[00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:32.920]
I think she'll get the delay

[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.720]
One who makes the third rock that I got

[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.120]
Two bare soul said Jenny keeps the rock

[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.200]
We said have a little now I have a lot

[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:41.720]
The metal movie was a din my dime stop

[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.260]
I had to pull out for the straw that I got

[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:46.700]
Two bare soul said Jenny keeps the rock

[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.900]
I spread a little cause the spring is hot

[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:50.220]
No way they've made a shot

[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:51.500]
But I source the fence hot

[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.520]

[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:57.060]
Why are you even looking at the emails?

[00:36:57.260 --> 00:36:57.900]
I don't get it

[00:36:58.860 --> 00:36:59.580]
Oh sometimes

[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.740]
Subject, rock to New York

[00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.880]
No but for the University of Miami I did

[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.140]
Isn't Miami University the one in Ohio

[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.040]
Is that what they call it?

[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.180]
Miami University of Ohio

[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:14.100]
Anyway but University of Miami

[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.640]
Thanks is Jeff

[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:24.900]
He's off the mix for a garbage plate

[00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.680]
Nice ball baby get the old garbage plate

[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.220]
But that's good

[00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:29.320]
Would like smeared with a hot sauce all over him

[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.900]
If you're on the icons by the way

[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.560]
You really love vikin herbs too

[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:34.980]
That's what has to make tacos

[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.280]
What?

[00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.340]
Is that sarcastic?

[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:37.040]
What?

[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.020]
If you're on the icons you'll love vikin herbs

[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.660]
Herbs

[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:40.480]
No

[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.360]
You don't eat the pond

[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:43.220]
Oh

[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.280]
Well you sure don't get it do you

[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.060]
No look at the tremendous response on the phone

[00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.660]
We had a one call already with some

[00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:52.860]
I'm not just hateful as it jerk jerk

[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:53.860]
And that was it

[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.080]
And that's South Florida once again

[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.580]
Exporting their hostility hate

[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:58.320]
It's great that we can let you vetted all the way

[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.620]
100 miles north right here to this beautiful city

[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:01.100]
It's wonderful

[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:02.840]
Sonny are going to be 52 here today

[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.220]
It's a beautiful day

[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.160]
I love this time of the year

[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:09.240]
Pompadot Park drops show wages from Ed and Fort Lauderdale

[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.420]
Thank you what I didn't know this

[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:11.920]
Because my close friends at Pompadot Park

[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:12.900]
Didn't bother to tell me this

[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.840]
Opening October 10th for its 40th season

[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:16.720]
Great Harnessed Racing

[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.200]
Without show wagering this year

[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.720]
Track management decided to drop the wager after show wagering counted for only

[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.620]
1.45% of its total handle last season

[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.320]
I guess so it's no more five across

[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.820]
On a long shot

[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.660]
My good close personal friend General manager Dick Feinberg

[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.160]
Said we realized that show wagering is a traditional horse racing

[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.320]
But we think it's a sucker bet for our patrons

[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.600]
It's not worth risking two dollars for an insignificant payoff that's the norm

[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.080]
I believe it drives away the novice for first time player

[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.340]
Thanks to making a low risk wager

[00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.560]
And are disappointed when your payoff is a few cents more than their investment

[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:51.080]
We also see see my first bet in the game was $2.60

[00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.340]
I bet two bucks to show

[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.780]
I'll reach for you this eight minute times I'll throw a jenko

[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:57.360]
Here comes Don McHummery the nine horse he wins the race

[00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.280]
I made 60 cents

[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.620]
We also see domination show waiting his way to boost bets on our win and

[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.520]
Place pools which have much higher payoffs

[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:06.700]
Yaudi yaudi

[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.820]
Nice going error Dick

[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:11.000]
Meanwhile Ken done a call or so we wouldn't do that because you know

[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:11.700]
We're done

[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.180]
You're done Ken

[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.500]
So that's what Dick Feinberg says

[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:20.760]
No comments at a rush limbaugh thing is that incredible or what the phone should be full just on that which we're not even talking about it

[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.060]
But it should people should have something to say about that

[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.760]
Yeah, here's a call from boca hello

[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:33.380]
Boca hold what hold are we on hold okay, so that's two for two so far two ass holes out of two

[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:39.880]
We're batting the thousand even baby Ruth and Ty Cobb never did that even PD Rose didn't do that speaking of the genrich gamblers

[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:45.380]
Who bet 20,000 ashore whatever he'll he does I can't that business to go into a racetrack and just putting up

[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.100]
Stack up bills on the table

[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:53.040]
So I'm not joking about it. He piles up a stack of a hundred dollar bills and put them on the table like hey look at me

[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.060]
Look at this. I got some money here. Look at this. I'm a schmuck. You know, you know a peepin

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.680]
No, why don't they don't let him in bigot damn Mahalla fam. You're you're disgrace PD. Okay, make me sick

[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.940]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Yeah, hey Neil. Yes, sir

[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.120]
Again, that's a bring up, you know history all into this if anybody out there remembers the draft

[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.040]
All the people in Philadelphia

[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:23.160]
Were a little a peo that they picked out of the Nick Manoppe because they wanted them to take bricky Williams

[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.740]
That was the year that Edwin James

[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.100]
Well, let's not this isn't a sport today

[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.940]
Let's not get off into it like mentioning everybody who ever played every black

[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.860]
That's not the issue is just you know using his right wing

[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:42.840]
Feel yeah, trying to get people to talk about it so that more people tune in the ESPN well

[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:48.680]
It sure worked out. Say that you know, I mean if a little bit some liberal guy saying that they would have canned his ass already

[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:53.700]
Yeah, but because people in Philadelphia believe me they did just oh, let's get the black guy

[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:59.320]
You know, they were they wanted Ricky Williams. I mean, and I think he's got a thought too last time I checked

[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:04.860]
He looked pretty dark to me too. Yeah, so I'm ready on our side anyway listening good show. Take care

[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.280]
All right, great day. Say goodbye

[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.100]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a get no seriously

[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.900]
Somebody other guys have been canned for even less than what this guy said he's tried to say oh he's really not all

[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:20.420]
I good, but they wanted him because he's black that that's one of the most disgusting out knocks just right right from the get go right out of the box

[00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.820]
This tub of right wing

[00:41:22.340 --> 00:41:29.100]
Haustlely and crap this bigoted nasty miserable red necky a tub of Schmidt how about our good one Dave Halberstam and that

[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:35.400]
Right, that's right poor Dave Halberstam who's a great guy doesn't have a bigoted voting his body. He gets blown out

[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:40.780]
Oh

[00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:48.440]
He gets blown out by the heat because of the fact that he made some off the and it was nothing so an occupist comment innocuous

[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:56.560]
And right and all the other different people and Howard Cosell who nearly got Schmidt canned for that Alvin Garrett little monkey, you know

[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:01.800]
Because everybody is so sensitive, but if rush says it hey look at the great demographics

[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.660]
He's good look at the great numbers. He's getting you know

[00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.960]
That's America for it. Just like that Jerry Springer crap

[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.360]
I was watching before but all those college kids running around taking their pants off

[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:15.980]
Some of more kind of girls. Oh seriously. I mean what's the use and there is no question in my mind

[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:21.920]
I want to apologize to myself not to anybody else for wondering how it is that anybody with any kind of IQ

[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:30.080]
Could vote for Arnold for governor of California. Well, how is this possible? How can there be so many stupid stupid stupid people

[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.520]
It's amazing. It's shocking is what it is

[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.080]
But it don't shock me no mo

[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:43.020]
After seeing this oh the 18 to 34 demographic there are 26% on the ESPN pregame show on her ratings let's some days

[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:49.080]
Because rushes on her because Hermann Gehring is on her who's stepping and given all kinds of bubble mice

[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:55.080]
These in wild stories about how Clintons had 30,000 people murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night in the Audi Audi

[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.880]
I also the craft is making up crap as he goes along

[00:42:59.100 --> 00:42:59.540]
Yeah

[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.160]
man

[00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:05.480]
300 pounds of crap on legs

[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.100]
Here's a call from bokeh hello

[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:11.000]
Hey, you know you're right about

[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.900]
We used to call him lord actually lost some weight. Yeah, he's a little

[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:19.400]
I know you don't ever listen to a show with you know I don't know the car and he blamed

[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.120]
He actually blamed the new leak on the spi thing on quen

[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.760]
He spun that around now. Blaine's on quen. Yeah, probably Chelsea done it

[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:32.620]
Well, no, he said he said that dog because Bush is this caring sensitive person

[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:34.000]
He left a lot of people in the

[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.320]
Secret service that were Clint night

[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.020]
Right the broom hasn't think room and swept it clean yet

[00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:46.640]
Because he's supposed to get along with everybody. Yeah, the stuff the boom headlup rushes fat ass

[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.740]
Yeah, and it was Clintons people that have that have basically yeah, I want to know something

[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:57.120]
Why isn't if Novak supposedly knows who did this? Yeah, with the new Patriot Act, which you would not probably both hate

[00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:00.100]
Why can't they force him? I know that he's got this

[00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:05.000]
The Patriot Act doesn't the Patriot Act doesn't apply to write Winger's like Bob Novak's thing right?

[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.260]
Will it only to come he pink or liberals like us?

[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:13.140]
Right will if it if it's a journalistic integrity in all this isn't that national security whoever not for his standpoint

[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:20.500]
But whoever told him the name of this person and keep in mind keep in mind the law that they broke by doing that was put into effect by

[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.480]
Bush one by W's papa. Oh, yeah, and then they talked about

[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:29.460]
You that was nothing rush talks about how the democrats wanted to get rid of that like with the

[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.120]
Independent council

[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:36.640]
They wanted to get rid of that the democrats did and the reason for that is because all they were doing is attacking Clinton

[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.800]
They weren't finding out anything. So we got a bj big deal. Yeah

[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.440]
And then and then now we want an independent council and then rushes all like oh my god

[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.920]
See how they're two faced as democrats. Well don't don't make them mistake again, man

[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.400]
I'll just get your blood pressure up don't do it. I know how do you know I have blood pressure?

[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.080]

Thanks man. Okay, take to encum down

[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:04.560]
5670 560 pound 560 audio TNT and Verizon wireless line the media has been very

[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:06.920]
Desirous that a black quarterback do well

[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.720]
Seems to me that years ago what that was a uh Freddie Solomon

[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.160]
Who was the blind he wasn't the quarterback?

[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.020]
Williams call his quarterback Doug Williams for Tampa right in Washington. Yep

[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:21.420]
Doug Williams his black is the ace of spades. He did very very well

[00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:25.440]
Through a black quarterback. What about Randall cunningham? Huh?

[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:33.260]
Sure another great one right great black quarterback. So what the hell is this fat tub of Nazi right wing crab

[00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:37.580]
Pedal in here the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. So um

[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:41.780]
McNabb is a doubt of a McNabb he's got to be made to be looked like a big hero even though he's not

[00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:49.100]
Who's the quarterback for a Tennessee McNair? Steve McNair. Err is there. He looks pretty black to me

[00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:53.860]
Right sure does there's all kinds of black quarterbacks all over the place rush

[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:59.620]
Maybe if you got your fat ass out of the goddamn kitchen once in a while out of your goddamn fast food joint once in a while

[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.300]
Actually watch the ballgame you know what that you were talking about

[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:06.440]
There's black quarterbacks up the ass rush and that's where I'd like to stick my foot is right up yours

[00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:12.980]
Your big fat ass is what I'd like to do. He's echoing the sports media from 15 years ago, I think

[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.180]
From 15 I see like 50 years ago

[00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:19.780]
He probably got some reason my Jackie Robinson should be allowed to play baseball

[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.160]
Rest in pieces don't coax him. Hey, that'll probably be coming up this coming Sunday

[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:29.580]
So here you go all they got to do now on ESPN on the logo is put like a little swastika on there

[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:38.400]
That sounds good to me. I can just hear the opening for uh the pregame show on ESPN. You might mention my name's rice master Gary

[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.140]
Here we go

[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.600]
Here's the new theme for ESPN pregame Sunday football on the NFL

[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.500]
Good lord ass

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.120]
Gary

[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:55.980]
I didn't say blue garrick I said lord ass garing yes, that's how you would know who blue garrick was anyway would you?

[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.300]
Blue garrick he had that disease

[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:00.860]
New you were gonna say that I knew it

[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:08.740]
Absolutely knew it how much should I know it I don't know well. He's a sports guy right if that right up your alley selling

[00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:19.500]
It's

[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.640]
If I am he tells

[00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:24.760]
At five six oh

[00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:26.100]
Hey

[00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:33.520]
Coming up next on queer eye for that Palestinian guy we make over

[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.660]
Yes, they're air a fast he's trying to take over the PLO again from that mohammed

[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:43.680]
What's his name if he's to succeed he needs some help no kidding. I mean what is up with that do rag?

[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:50.680]
I mean it's so five minutes ago really and that's gravely weird. I mean who are you it's going to be our biggest challenge ever

[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:56.860]
But we're ready to scrap that drab wardrobe and transform yes sir from a ringo star look alike to a

[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:02.640]
Will it well he's still gonna look like ringo, but just cleaner. We need to do something about those glasses too

[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:08.080]
Oh, we're gonna be doing just a ton of things on the next queer eye for that Palestinian guy Thursday night today

[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:13.460]
11 o'clock is five six you w2 and we got to big gamarlands watch party three thirty to seven noon

[00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.600]
Now who's pitching for the mollans today? Scott

[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.260]
Brad penny oh

[00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:19.920]
pennies for rimmer

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.220]
So Brad pennies pitching now I see I don't understand. Why do they pitch down trail on sunday on a closing day of the season

[00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:30.160]
Why did they do that instead of saving him for like one of these first two games out there?

[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.820]
Well, they they want everybody to get sufficient rest and they why you buy to pitch out a rotation

[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.240]
Not good well Brad penny might just turn out to be uh the he might be the answer

[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:47.540]
They maybe it's like a two-hitter and the marlins are like four nothingness afternoon when they're fiscal penny had outstanding stuff

[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:52.800]
His last game out outstanding let's back into sports intensive here. Okay. Yes. You're starting to sound like that last bad

[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.520]
I was giving a huck in me a try to anyway

[00:48:54.520 --> 00:49:00.020]
Shula steak too is where it's happening to marlins watch party three thirty to seven noon did we get word on whether or mad dogs doing a show out there today?

[00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:00.680]
Not yet

[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.660]
Keep them in suspense. Okay. Keep you hanging

[00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:11.820]
It's like tomorrow like we got that big gavan hit maybe and maybe it'll be like from noon till 12 15 or

[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:14.520]
Just go there and see if there anybody's really there or not right

[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:21.480]
How's that poll coming 169 votes in our first poll today should Neil except Mohawar dividends over to a piece in love

[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.060]
Absolutely not we hate mo 55 we hate him

[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:27.500]
We absolutely absolutely hate him

[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:33.060]
Only if Neil has no self-respect 36 see I have to take that very seriously under consideration

[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:38.300]
kind only if Moe paints his vault spot 35 that's what I voted yes

[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:46.780]
We need harmony of qm only 26 15 percent not too strong and who's Mohawar david at a full 10 percent 17 people say who the hell is who'd at?

[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:52.060]
Not a fact that we can we can get professional painters to come in if he chooses that option because you have to admit that

[00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.680]
He really is a strenuously

[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.080]
Extending the hand of friendship. I mean he's sticking it out there. He's probing. He's reaching it around. He's

[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:06.180]
Moving it all over the place right right? I mean when he's stuck right out there in the tearum you must have been a guest

[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.200]
Here's the line you be. Hello

[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:13.120]
Yes, hello Neil. Yes, sir. Yes. Thanks. You know just to comment real quick on the

[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:18.280]
elimination of the show betting in pompano that may be due to the rounding factor

[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:25.060]
I think that the minimum payment on on a ticket on a two dollar ticket has to be two dollars and ten cents

[00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:27.640]
Yeah, and on the show bets they they made

[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:35.480]
After the races won they made to the mathematics and find out that each of those people should get maybe two dollars and five cents

[00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:39.960]
So the track has to pitch in a nickel on every other that's very very rare

[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:44.180]
That's only if there's an enormous amount of you have a bridge jumper that fits like ten grand in the show portion

[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:46.520]
Like that happens only once in a blue moon very rare

[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:51.260]
But I still wonder that it might have something to do with the rounding factor

[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:55.740]
I mean, you know you figure that the more types of tickets they can sell the better

[00:50:55.740 --> 00:51:00.680]
And if it is only one point four percent of their handles still that's one point four percent

[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:07.380]
See I don't like it because there are people and every now and an I'll bet like on a long shot five bucks across the board or whatever ten bucks across

[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.000]
And if a horse pays for example five forty to show because it's a long shot

[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.640]
And maybe the favorites off the board and you get like say five eighty to show just a good example

[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:20.180]
You you lost the buck on the whole thing, you know, so like it's it's a good bet

[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:22.000]
That's true. It offsets the other bets

[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.820]
Yeah, I like it. You really may not have a good feel for it

[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:31.140]
You may not be that interesting, but you want to make a bet to have a some interest in the race so you make a show bet

[00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.760]
Mm-hmm, you know, and I I don't know I guess we can't do anything about it

[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.840]
But it's sad to see that they made that sort of a good deal. Well, I have an agree

[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.200]
I mean, you know, a pomp and a park effect or spots coming up in them and they're good friends of mine

[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:46.440]
But I just disagree with them on this I think show betting you should be allowed the tradition is there for zillion years

[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.040]
You know, I think so too when play show across the board

[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:53.860]
In addition to it's a track is got the paragot of either in a five horse feel for example

[00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.580]
Or if there's a stupendous favorite in a race like one to nine track

[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.720]
They can eliminate show betting and any race that they want to yes, that's true on a race by race

[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.960]
But that's true. I thought about that point. That's a good one. You know, they can do it if it works

[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.240]
And they do they and they do do do it. Yeah

[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.060]
Okay, thanks pal. Right off. I'm with you. Yeah, I don't like it dick

[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:14.920]
I know dick five words. Proud of us there right now and swearing that's not about that. He's not saying that

[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:18.860]
He just you know, he might be I mean if I want about two bucks and Donald breeder to show it

[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.300]
I pay 50 bucks to show if he ever hits the board. Hey, don't let's this way overturn the middle of the track

[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:28.700]
Not way out there by the grandstand. Come on Donnie hit him again. Just tip him again. They're like a Lucian Fontaine

[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:29.900]
We got to them again

[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:34.280]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T

[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:39.000]
See, I have forgotten that this is you holiday thing rushes on all the way through a yom kipur man

[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.540]
It's it's always like a little bit of downtime. I forgot that

[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:46.220]
It's another one of the excuses in South Florida. Why there's nothing humongous

[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:51.540]
tremendous enthusiastic response that we love and know and expect yeah, don't we expect it

[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:55.220]
No, expect something here's Miami. Hello

[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:57.060]
Yeah, yes sir

[00:52:57.660 --> 00:52:59.060]
How you doing? Good

[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.620]
Hello, yes sir speak to me speak to me. I'm doing great. How you doing sir? I

[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.000]
Want to talk on Sunday. Yeah

[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:14.040]
Hopefully we're gonna run the ball another 40 45 times and pound it down. So what are you talking about?

[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.840]
What in God's name are you talking about

[00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:24.560]
The game Sunday. I don't care about the game Sunday sir. It's not a sports show talk to the sports nerds about the game Sunday

[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:25.880]
You idiot you moron

[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:32.060]
See all I had to do is mention Rush limo and Donnie McVick and McNeid and all of us said which is a social issue

[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:35.040]
It's a media issue. It has nothing to do with a game itself

[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:41.020]
Other than the fact that the guy happens to play the game in a little bit happens to be on a show that's associated with a pregame

[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:47.440]
And this guy wants to hack me about we're gonna run a ball 45 times run it up your ass. Okay pal you and Ricky Williams. I'm sorry

[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:48.560]
5

[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:54.240]
5 6 7 0 5 60 when you can't mention Ricky Williams and up the ass in the same breath it gets very upset

[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.500]
And then a little bastard write a column about it. You know about how Ricky Williams is really Cuban and all that

[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:00.420]
It'll be sore

[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:05.680]
Yeah, now let me ask you this if if the dolphin should win a Super Bowl which they won't but if they did

[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.260]
Would Robert Steinbeck write a column and say oh

[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.020]
The dolphins didn't win a Super Bowl. We wanted the black folks. He wouldn't write that would no

[00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:16.240]
See that's usually what an asshole Dan La Bastard is man

[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.320]
I have ever seen him together with that Elliott Rodriguez from channel four same person

[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:28.140]
Professional Kubano that's uh in fact have you ever seen them and Miguel together? No same person

[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:31.280]
Professional Kubano

[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:33.160]
Papa feed out feed out

[00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:37.580]
That's why I stopped for the soulful of division and hate man people are just can't let it get well ready

[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.840]
Okay, and the hotel's there were never so great in the first place. I don't give a crap lot. Hi, Min Roth said

[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.740]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[00:54:45.740 --> 00:54:50.060]
Yes, I knew yes, sir. You're the greatest man. I love you. Yes, I am

[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:56.660]
Yeah, well, I'm gonna say about Rich Lauch, Rush Lam limbo or whatever his name is

[00:54:56.660 --> 00:55:01.720]
He uh, you know one moon was a great quarterback. He's one of the top quarterbacks in the whole NFL

[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:07.080]
How could we forget war in the moon man? That's right who also was the Canadian football league exactly and um

[00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:13.140]
You know rushes the type of person that you know if you take him to seriously of course you're gonna pop your lid

[00:55:13.140 --> 00:55:15.780]
You know you're gonna get kind of yeah, you know

[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:19.560]
But he if he's all a part of the whole spin the whole right winner

[00:55:20.340 --> 00:55:26.060]
That they're spinning yeah psychology thing they're trying to just hypnotize everybody to believe in what they're saying

[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:31.940]
It's right and it's doing seem to be doing some kind of a job in a lot of these people because they seem to be you know

[00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:36.580]
It's really interesting if I come on here and I play a song parody about condolese and say that

[00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:42.000]
She's a right wing sell out in a and a lackey of chevron and big oil if I say that right away

[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.780]
There's a whole bunch of people want to get me off the air

[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:49.840]
But this tub of crap can go on national TV on ESPN and he could say that the only reason that they're touting out of it

[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:53.860]
And McNabb is because he's black and immediate wants to make a black guy look good in football

[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:59.020]
Yeah, I mean even if they're people are giving them flack of eyes. I'll bet you they don't want to let it go on the

[00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:02.020]
On the media not on the air. They're not gonna say anything

[00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:10.040]
Okay, paly well hang in there. It's all I can tell you have a great thing. What do you say? I five six seven oh five sixty

[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:15.380]
pound five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon Marles by don't forget best of the old van hit tomorrow noon to two

[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:22.220]
Or noon till they give up that that ration now you were given before was so weak, but that's just we've done it that way in the past

[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:26.280]
We have done it that way in the past, but we didn't start it at noon. We didn't start doing it at noon

[00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:27.500]
See that's what you're forgetting

[00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:31.400]
We gave people ample time so that if it was like a change in

[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:37.140]
The game plan they had time to switch to switch gears. See you have that time to switch your gear

[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.840]
That's what Richard said and he's swishing it right now

[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.620]
River Yamaha 3671 North XI went popular beach. That's where I'm a girl and

[00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:48.720]
Joe Castello beat him on noon to noon till two

[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:53.260]
At the first five donators get a pair of Alice Cooper tickets for Friday at popular beach

[00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:57.700]
The courtesy of the real yellow pages and the good news is George's DSL's working

[00:56:57.700 --> 00:57:02.860]
Let's air it today. Make Gary Sarner happy what today? Don't don't be

[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:07.900]
See you're so skeptical. I think it's gonna be working for years and eons to come you watch

[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:13.020]
We're gonna daily report. I hate them thumbs up or thumbs down. I don't want to hear about it

[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.120]
Here's pompano. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir

[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:21.060]
Yeah, I wanted to ask your opinion on something regarding you know limbo work on an ESPN

[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.300]
Yeah, they're talking about how their ratings have gone up

[00:57:24.300 --> 00:57:27.900]
You're interesting because Michael Irving joined them this year also

[00:57:27.900 --> 00:57:31.300]
You think he might be responsible for their ratings going up a little no

[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:36.560]
Well, no reason I'm asking is you know he is a black former athlete. He's a quasi-criminal

[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:42.840]
Direct to the number of times and he's and he's semi-literate at best right exactly

[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.140]
I mean that does bring a lot of people to

[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:50.340]
So it's a lot oh I'm speaking of in articulate what the hell was I mean

[00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:54.540]
Tony Gwyn was one of the great baseball players of hitters anyway of our time

[00:57:54.540 --> 00:57:58.800]
But what the hell is he doing on here? It's not bad. I don't think I worked stuff up on her too on it

[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:05.080]
Braves Cubs game last time Tony Gwyn. I mean this guy he sounds like Mickey Mouse on helium

[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:09.920]
You know, there was somebody working with the come game last night. It was so comical. Let me tell you what happened

[00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:11.080]
It was two hours

[00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.040]
I was on

[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.700]
Yeah, and somebody gets a hit and he scored and the guy was commenting that was really great

[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:21.660]
You know he he stopped to see that there was a hit before you know he broke for home

[00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:25.380]
I'm like it's two hours you run at the crack at a bat when there's two hours. Yeah

[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.840]
This is an ex-ball player saying this. I mean

[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:32.420]
It's that played a game for 20 years and he doesn't realize that when it's two hours you make contact

[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:34.920]
You just take off for God. Who was it?

[00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:38.240]
Tony Gwyn who sounds like somebody squeezed and is not for the greatest

[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:43.760]
Whoever was was terrible, but you have just curious you know because I don't want the SPN show

[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.180]
I don't like I don't want any of these pre-game shows. Yeah, I don't know

[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:51.280]
I want to see the game. I don't want to see a bunch of x-jok slap any other on the ass and yuck it up

[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.200]
You know Terry Bradshaw bunch of the illiterate morons sit there

[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:58.320]
Don't talk you on try to and Chris Collins worth all trying to like out humor the other one

[00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.200]
You know be real broadcasters. You know, but it's so long

[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:05.100]
It's interesting because you know they talk about limboid bringing you a bigger audience

[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.880]
You know, I'm just curious if you felt that urban had anything to do with it. No

[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:13.000]
So something I was just curious but I think maybe Frank Irving and Brett Hanover

[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:20.140]
I had something to do with it. Have a great day sir five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Marles line

[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:22.040]
What's the only horse that people had hand over twice

[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:24.440]
Mr. Red

[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.640]
Was it eddie was vick

[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:32.880]
Was that that horse that great horse that Chris boring drove? What was the name of that horse? See now?

[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:37.180]
I'm gonna lose my mind. How we get started on this? I mentioned the thing about worse limboid all of a sudden

[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:39.960]
I were getting sucked into a sports show. Do we want to do a sports show? No

[00:59:41.460 --> 00:59:43.600]
212 votes on a polo pretty heavy duty

[00:59:44.140 --> 00:59:47.080]
Should Neil accept mo how he dividends overtures of you know

[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:52.080]
We might leave this pull up all day today and save the other one for tomorrow. Sure. Don't you think good plan

[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.840]
This pool is getting a phenomenal response. I mean these people are really into a mo

[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:58.060]
Pole just say no tomorrow

[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:03.740]
That's when people are saying all over town just say no tomorrow especially when I get those arbitrary and diaries a lot of her just saying no

[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.160]
Aren't they absolutely? Oh

[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:06.620]
Oh

[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:14.840]
I see I really honestly don't know I mean I have you know me I got that soft spot and as much as he's really been a pin in the ass

[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.280]
A bit obnoxious to us

[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:26.380]
You and the yours truly. It's he's just trying so hard now like a little child like please please won't you forgive me and can't we kiss and make up in the audience is basically saying

[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.240]
No, no, no, no, well, they love the thing

[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.260]
They do like they like to stir up hate. That's right. Just remember hate hurts the hater

[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:36.520]
Oh

[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:43.300]
Right where they say in Atlanta hate hurts the heat Lee but that's terrible about Danny heat Lee and especially about dance nighters in a coma

[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:48.540]
But he isn't as he's got dr. Gupta taking care of him so we won't be seeing him no more probably

[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:54.960]
2012 votes should Neil except Mohawar dividends overtures of peace and love absolutely not we hate mo 65

[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.800]
Only if no more paints his vault spot 44

[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:06.680]
It's just changing again. Uh only if Neil has no software respect 42. Yeah, those two together and you got like 70%

[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:16.360]
Yes, we need harmony of QAM 37 16.8% and who's Mohawar david in 28 now maybe there's just too many negative categories on there you think maybe

[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:17.820]
No

[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.920]
No, I mean, how about one that says uh

[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:27.700]
What else could it say can't we all just get along? No, but we got that the harmony thing at QAM

[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:32.840]
This audience don't like harmony. They like hate and division and you came to the right place

[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:41.280]

This is Rush Wimbaw, serving of humanity, talk show host, hemorrhoid, sufferer

[01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:13.340]
Folks, it over 300 pounds. I know the agony of this kind of dilemma. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you there's help

[01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:22.360]
With new preparation rush and my rush to excellent suppositories. Now you can end the pain and itching of hemorrhoidal tissue

[01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:30.060]
Just look for my picture on the box of suppositories and the applicator to you back them another fine product from OIV

[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:36.500]
The obesity and broadcast thing network speaking of pain in the ass. Here's my close friend Dick Feinberg from pompadopark

[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.220]
How did I know you'd be calling? Oh, that's a great segue

[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.020]
I

[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:44.200]
Ever see the two of them together? No, rest my case

[01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:49.340]
I want first I wanted to answer your your question from before the break

[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:55.700]
Audio's Vic Jim Dennis did be right maybe Brett Hanover couple. Well, did I say that? I used you

[01:03:55.700 --> 01:04:00.260]
Yeah, you did and the horse you were you were and I could have told you was audio's big. What was the Chris Boring horse?

[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.440]
True Dwayne true Dwayne

[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:08.540]
He'd be Brett Hanover Hollywood Clark in the classic of the only race to Brett Hanover finished worse than second in his career

[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:12.680]
And a reason I think that happened is it was one of those races that they tried to race him from behind

[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:15.260]
Which wasn't his style of racing? He liked to race on the front end

[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:18.520]
Frank urban changed the boy for some reason he changed the bridal

[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.480]
He wasn't always like this fresh last race and he either he went from a open bridal and put blinders on him

[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:31.400]
And he couldn't hold him and he went like he went the record if he went a pile and record time the problem was the race was a mile and a 16

[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.700]
Yeah, he got tired at the end. He had Ronnie Franklin syndrome

[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.640]
Yeah, yeah

[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:41.340]
But I know I did call alpha to defend myself a little bit, but

[01:04:43.900 --> 01:04:46.020]
I'm not all bent out of shape about it

[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:50.700]
I just happened to agree with a guy to call before that old cock that it was complaining about the show betting

[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.940]
I happen to like you know if you've got a 15 to one shot or 20 to one shot or real good long shot

[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:59.720]
And it's worth taking a shot at it and you bet like five bucks across the board on it

[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:03.640]
You can make some serious cash on it if it comes in and if it comes in third

[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:07.400]
If it actually hits the board you might actually make a couple of bucks. That's true

[01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:11.440]
I've got a couple of things that weren't mentioned one is that

[01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.540]
With our with our field size which averages a little over eight horses array

[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.520]
The value is really diminished the tracks that have 10 horses to 10 starters more array

[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.480]
I think there's still plenty of value in the show pool and the issue of the minus pools is important

[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:30.520]
Us because the way it works in Florida a lot of out-of-state tracks and

[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:37.580]
Shops are uneasy taking our signal because if a bridge jumper comes in the their place and makes the bet

[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.960]
They get stuck with making up the

[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.860]
The difference the nickel on the dollar and it's not like that in other states

[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.920]
So we think it's gonna help us sell our signal

[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:48.500]
A little more

[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:54.380]
Outside the state, but I know it's it's gonna be controversial one of the reasons we did it was that

[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:59.980]
You know to do something a little crazy get people talking about us. I think that's worked already and

[01:06:00.560 --> 01:06:03.200]
You know, we'll see you we'll see how it plays out

[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:08.220]
The thing that bothers me you've been on a launch out the show at 20 to 1

[01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:12.620]
Finish it finishes there you get all excited and the two favorites happen to run one two

[01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:18.340]
And you get a you get a payoff of $2.60 or even worse that 20 to 1 shot wins

[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:23.040]
The two favorites run two three then you see them and you've got a show bet

[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:28.720]
It's gonna pay $42. Maybe $14 the place and then $260 to show

[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.020]
You feel like you've been worked over a little bit

[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.380]
Yeah, or maybe if the one to five shot finishes off the board and it pays like

[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:42.060]
$40 to win 16 bucks to place and 35 bucks to show because the one to five shots off the board made a break

[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.240]
That's right. Well, you know you can still uh

[01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.820]
That's why they call it horse racing

[01:06:46.820 --> 01:06:51.540]
You'll still be able to bet make show bets on the other 15 or 20 tracks. We bring you

[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.660]
You know

[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:54.240]
You can't make it show bet

[01:06:56.940 --> 01:07:01.700]
So it's not that the show bet is very good. See what you're really trying to say as you try to paint me into a quarter

[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.840]
What a pussy trying to trap that show money this guy is, you know

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:08.320]
Well, I mean it is only 1.4% of our handle

[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:12.960]
Yeah, we you know we think we can make more more by selling the signal to more help at that estate

[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:18.040]
Well, take a shot see how it works and we'll get people talking like to me Johnson said we got a shot

[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.000]
That's right

[01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.060]
And uh, yeah, the rush things, you know

[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.420]
He started to get popular when he was right across the street from me in Sacramento

[01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.780]
A station called KFDK right across from the barn area where you could smell all the horse poop

[01:07:33.420 --> 01:07:39.620]
And uh, he just used to come over to the races and uh on 4th of july and you like with uh, you know

[01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:44.620]
Be the be the MC for the fireworks show, but that was you know that was that was the beginning of it for him

[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.220]
He was actually probably was eating all of kevler cookies from the kevler elves and rick kevler

[01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:52.560]
That could be but he was that you I mean he was like a 200 yards from

[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:57.840]
From my office. That's where his that's where he broadcats is, you know, that's where I all the that stuff

[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:04.020]
You know that's where he uh, he got his uh, he got his a pop than uh, I'll be damned and yeah

[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:09.960]
Well bad day was for a walk, so we can not not only can we blame you for eliminating the show betting at pop in a park

[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.040]
We can blame you for a given rush limbaugh his start. That's right. We gave him a leg up as they say in the horse racing

[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:15.400]
Yeah

[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.620]
Yeah, that's um

[01:08:17.160 --> 01:08:18.920]
Well, it wasn't really neat. It was

[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.080]
I had I had no choice over that it was uh

[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.000]
uh

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.900]
That was a state fairgrounds and sacramental thought he would be a good uh, representative

[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.500]
Well, there was no Steve Orington. I'll tell you that

That's fine. That's all right not even have any calls about the Moe and this whole thing that we got going on with a pool today

[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:57.760]
Not gonna have any calls about the fact that for well wants the most job and hangs job and everybody else's job

[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:03.460]
Like I said, he's a self-promoter man. He's a go-gitter. He wants to spread it out when it doubts spread it out

[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.600]
Here's Margate. Hello

[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.860]
Hi Neil. Yes, sir

[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:13.980]
Yeah, um, I just had an idea um with the internet voting you know how the banks can take your money

[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:17.520]
You know through the bill paying or whatever. Yeah, I couldn't they do have an election

[01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:21.080]
You know do that the voting through an election type process

[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:27.680]
I'm a internet. Yeah, I mean they can encrypt it. What about people? What about people that don't have computers?

[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.260]
Yeah, well, they go to the polls then. What about computer hackers?

[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:32.940]
Well, I mean

[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.260]
Can't they fix that somehow eventually?

[01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:39.520]
What about creepers? What about people that load up with phony votes like they do on our pool all the time?

[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:41.900]
What about those people virus as it works?

[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:45.180]
But what about the old virus in the week and what about the wicked worm, huh?

[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.540]
Yeah, well, couldn't they do like a verification like a pen number or I mean they can take your money

[01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:53.460]
But they can't get a proper vote. You know what I mean? Yeah

[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.940]
Well, they're saying now the electronic voting is gonna be is even more subject to

[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:03.720]
Fixing than the the old thing at least with a balance yet something tangible to count and recount the the electronic thing

[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:08.280]
It's just a number in a machine somewhere they can they can press a button and make it read whatever number they want I guess

[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.780]
Yeah, I thought I thought it you know eventually maybe they could do it though it would work well

[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:20.640]
I thought maybe someday when they get to be foolproof in about a hundred years. Thanks a lot Pally good idea, but I ain't gonna happen

[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:27.020]
Very difficult to make it happen. How would you think wherever gonna have another honest election in America? No

[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:32.420]
In fact look at all the time it's gonna say we can still have some entertainment shows on election night

[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:33.440]
Pretty entertaining

[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:39.080]
It's not entertaining no more except of course in 2000 when Florida gave America all of that

[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:44.400]
All of spielkeys man when people were taking me locks by the gallon. What a show? Oh, he won

[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:46.680]
Miami has the dolphins there the worst football team here. They flub the ball from goal to goal like no one's ever seen

[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:50.980]
Oh, there on the ground. That's where they'll stay. They're never in control

[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.440]

They don't know how to tackle they don't know how to block

[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:24.860]
Their coaches ought to tell them to but then day in their jock

[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:28.320]
Then they would run much faster and even

[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:36.980]
Indifit when we go to the stadium. We'll see Miami. And there the Miami Dolphins

[01:14:36.980 --> 01:14:39.100]

Take all his signals and he broo

[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.900]
The dolphins have no defense and their offense is a joke

[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.400]
Like George Bush eating pretzels

[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.480]
You know they're gonna choke

[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.960]

[01:17:42.900 --> 01:17:47.060]
What else are listening to it in the morning? You think it's possible that anybody out there don't know who Moe is

[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.840]
No, your liars

[01:17:57.220 --> 01:18:00.120]

[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:08.860]
It was it was fairly close, but he was out

[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:14.080]
It's a damn good thing. They didn't pull out game out after that because that would have been really some comfort tops on that

[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.200]
He was out. It was a double play oj v. Okay

[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:22.640]
Blind men blind leading blinds. I think it's a home call. Yeah, it was a homo call

[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.320]

And eight-off Hitler anthem and waved a Nazi flag doing a football halftime show band director Charles Grissin

[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:19.500]
Remember mr. Grissin now Charles Grissin said the song and flag were part of a musical performance called visions of World War 2

[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:24.300]
It was performed at a Dallas High School Friday, which also just happened to be Russia

[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:28.640]
Sean of the start of the Jewish New Year one of the holiest days in the Jewish calendar. How do you like that?

[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:36.560]
The performance is an attempt to factually portray the history of WDW to try and put over evil and honor our veterans for their sacrifices

[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.440]
Ensuring freedom throughout the world Grissin said in the statement

[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:42.500]
He added later that he made a major mistake in judgment

[01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:45.680]
Absolutely, yeah

[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:53.380]
The performance was greeted by heavy booze at the Hillcrest High School in Dallas and several objects were hold at the band

[01:19:54.200 --> 01:19:58.360]
How do you like that even in Dallas? They said hey you far-bissed her right way Nazi bastards

[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:11.740]
Just grants Britain U.S. and Japan the flags were waived twice as a musical selection of each country was played

[01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:16.620]
I bet you they didn't have a bunch of people run around making like pull their eyes apart like slatty art things

[01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:20.580]
You know, I don't think so oh I know it just like this about the judges

[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:26.260]
That's what I was doing the Paris school district issue and an apology to Hillcrest High and the Dallas school district said Paul troll

[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.600]

[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.240]
We strive to be sensitive to the feelings of others

[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:35.920]
And are always willing to amend our actions when we fall short troll

[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:42.300]
The band will still perform musical composition, but we'll only have the U.S. flag on display not the swastika

[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.980]
Paris, Texas located about a hundred miles northeast of Dallas

[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:02.940]
How do you like that swastik is and you you I wonder about this the creeping fascism and what did I tell you? Huh?

[01:21:02.940 --> 01:21:05.260]
It's not a coincidence this story you're

[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:09.920]
Ariana Huffington Clinton California by the way she's to defeat the recall and get rid of Arnold

[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.440]
It's a good by the Arnold because only more odds would vote for Arnold only idiots would vote for Arnold

[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:20.520]
For Rex it from the race most like there's the way for Lieutenant Governor Cruz Busce de Monte Democrats best

[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:23.640]
Hope of toward a shorts negrish should governor great Davis lose the recall vote

[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:28.300]
They ain't got a chance man. It can't beat the media. Arnold's got the money. He's got the media. He's in

[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:33.860]
Arnold for governor. I think that's a good idea. Let's start picking governors for all of the states

[01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:39.300]
Okay, we already got a bozo in Florida. We don't need to replace the jet by stage. It's a joke better than that. Can we sure

[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:41.760]
Amelio Estefan

[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:51.980]
Amelio Estefan? How about Amelia Estevez? Sure. Yeah some local celebrity some clown. How about Jose Conzucco?

[01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:54.780]
Hi, good lady. How about you with the peace to defend themselves with

[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:57.480]
He can keep the peace

[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.140]
Peace are crap

[01:22:02.260 --> 01:22:10.140]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I mean instead of Arnold let's go for somebody at least with a sense of humor

[01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:16.200]
I know how about Mickey Mouse I think would be better. I know Mickey's in Florida now. Maybe Mickey Mouse forgot about Florida. What do you say?

[01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:23.600]
How does the world end land? Right. I think it's a hell of a good idea. We can do Mickey and Minnie, but we get Mickey

[01:22:25.940 --> 01:22:31.860]
I'm gonna slip you to Mickey in a minute if you don't cut the crap 20 till noon at 560 WQ and we got a I don't know it seems like we're getting

[01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:36.000]
It was short-changed here today. I don't know what it is am I complaining? No

[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:40.660]
No, not when you consider that all week long. I guess the hump are worked on Monday and that was it

[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.740]
And keep in mind this is not for those who keep track not a vacation week

[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.720]
You can just fall again. We'll buck out a crap as the old saying goes just lucking out winning it out the hump are lucked out

[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.260]
Right you got these damn playoff games right there squared in the middle of his time slot

[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:56.760]
That's probably why for real though for others not one of those who wants off here. He wants on

[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:02.480]
He is always on he wants on now he wants on next week. He wants on on sookas. He wants someone on vacation

[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:07.860]
Remember those days sure that was not a good idea. That was not a good idea Scott

[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:14.560]
That would be like oh well, I hate someone on vacation this week. How about Neil DeWanhengshaw and uh-oh no

[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:15.860]
I'm afraid so

[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:18.940]
Right to what I'm saying. Yeah, they make any sense

[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.140]
What Scott is trying to like bridge you know bridge out a little bit branch out

[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.320]
He's trying to like move into all it pretty soon. It's going to be all for all all day

[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.900]
Yeah, and as much as we love for well that voice after the first 15 18 hours might start getting a little bit grating. You know what I'm saying?

[01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.700]
I think five to ten aim would be I mean eight to ten aim is perfect

[01:23:38.980 --> 01:23:41.320]
First Scott I don't want to step on poor mole

[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:46.160]
It's right so hard. There's like a part of me the old softy that I just uh you're right though

[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:50.660]
I would have no self respect to make up with him after all the evil horrible things he's done. Dr. evil mo

[01:23:51.140 --> 01:23:53.180]
He's been bad. You don't think it's uh

[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:56.960]
Never too late. Look at that. There's Phil Cabaretta former cub

[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.320]
Remember me and

[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:01.920]
Hmm? They'll come back and I say yeah, I'm like grandpa remember you playing

[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:06.340]
Wow, Phil Cabaretta he was also the manager one time like everybody else was and a little budro

[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:09.300]
Uh, what's his name? Donovan McNebs gonna make a statement

[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:12.440]
Which I haven't been watching here, but let me know when he uh start speaking

[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:19.400]
In response to what rush had to say about the him only being counted by the media because he happens to be black and media is trying to invent this

[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.160]
Successful black quarterback and as we mentioned how many do we mention about third man?

[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.680]
Warren Moon to Randall Cunningham to like a whole bunch of very successful

[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:29.780]
Black quarterbacks and see

[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.980]
It's just amazing. I'm almost speechless from this

[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:38.340]
I see the same thing here the same comparison is bubble and the blow jobs and everybody was talking impeachment

[01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:40.940]
We had to go through all that ugly business and waste those millions of dollars

[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:47.980]
And now we got a president into a got us into a war based on lies and American kids are over there dying every single day

[01:24:47.980 --> 01:24:55.940]
Your tax dollars are being flushed out of toilet every single day and other than a couple of people with balls nobody's really seriously talking about impeachment yet

[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:01.400]
It's freaking unbelievable and it's the same thing with a rush thing you know

[01:25:02.340 --> 01:25:06.620]
Jimmy DeGeek said this and this one said that there been a whole bunch of guys who've been canned because

[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.120]
Everybody on the national networks anyway, so thinking of sensitive and uptight about racial remarks

[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:18.300]
But rush limbaugh that fat lion son of a bitch. He can go on her say any damn thing. He likes hey the ratings are up. It's great, you know

[01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:24.160]
He's a crap 18 to noon at 560 wqm if you're fat like rush

[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.980]
They just showed a clip in he used to look better when he was fat

[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.420]
Yeah, he's got all that he looks he looks evil now. He looks even more evil than before

[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.420]
He before he was like a circus found when he was fat

[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:37.980]
It would you didn't look quite so dangerous now he looks dangerous kind of like uh Joseph Gerbels

[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:40.820]
And David Gurgley

[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.100]
Hey, I'll tell you a place of your stomach is gurling because you're fat like rush

Let's rape

[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:09.600]
Oh

[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:20.420]
I'm listening to the show and

[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:24.860]
One of the morning hosts was carbon up a restaurant that I think is terrific

[01:27:24.860 --> 01:27:29.100]
He were talking about how he had gone to this restaurant for loradill is steakhouse

[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:33.400]
Jackson's which is I've never been there. I've been to Burton jacks, which is now closed

[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:37.880]
But he was saying how great it was and then for some reason he took a shot at New York prime

[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:40.860]
I'm gonna tell you something that's in bokeh. I'm gonna give them

[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:42.720]
A make good because

[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:46.760]
He said that the services bad and they try to rush you out of there

[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:50.300]
Maybe they just didn't kiss his inflated ass or something you know

[01:27:50.300 --> 01:27:55.780]
I mean some guys who are well known they like to go on a restaurant where people fawn over him if they don't get that

[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:57.780]
They get unhappy with the place. I'm gonna tell you something

[01:27:57.780 --> 01:28:02.600]
I have been to that place probably a half dozen times. I know a lot of people who go there

[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:07.220]
The restaurants fantastic and I will go out on a limb and tell you it's the best steak sauce

[01:28:07.220 --> 01:28:13.340]
You can get anywhere south of Peter Lures and anybody who would knock that restaurant has got the problem

[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.740]
The restaurant is not the problem

[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:19.380]
They're been there before together. Well, we'll go anytime you want to and you can tell me if I'm right or wrong

[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:22.780]
Okay, that place is fantastic. It's where and you know what it's not that far

[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:28.740]
If you left from here, it's less than a 45 minute ride. It's right. It's right in my zone apart

[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:32.220]
I'm not saying it's better than the other place because I haven't been to the other place

[01:28:32.220 --> 01:28:36.760]
I'm just saying it didn't deserve to get knocked now. Maybe he had a bad experience there

[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:41.360]
Maybe they didn't want him around that one, you know, it's maybe he was a pain in the ass, you know

[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.460]
And they said let's get this guy out of here get him served and get him on a road

[01:28:44.460 --> 01:28:47.940]
Absolutely, let him 48. I wonder who he was talking about 12 minutes before noon

[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:52.020]
Yeah, you know, you got an awful lot of fence menu to do before we all of a sudden just start saying okay

[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:54.680]
All of us were given please come home. We're gonna kiss your balls

[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.520]
But we're gonna like squeeze your bag a little bit and see what pops out, you know

[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:05.600]
Got a lot of fence menu to do it. I have to be take weeks and months and maybe never but he's given it is a best shot

[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.900]
Maybe on the week's back or two maybe you know that would be good all the way don't like food basket

[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.300]
I like food a little bit but not a food basket. You ever seen a food basket?

[01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:17.940]
Yeah, as a matter of fact grapes here's a lady in Boyton Beach. Hello, Cherry

[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.840]

Yeah, well, how do you get them out of there?

[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:09.080]
Sounds like probably an election next year if they decide we still want to have one

[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:15.680]
Listen, I voted for McBride up here in Palm Beach five times and it never came out. It never came out

[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.500]

So it's all fixed and it's gonna be all fixed. You're right

[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:34.360]
I understand that the only no, not the Pastrami. I'm going to get some

[01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:38.520]
Monsible soup and Kishka. I never did that the other day. Oh, I was gonna ask

[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.880]
Ask what how was the Kishka? How was the soup? You ruined Pastrami for me

[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:49.480]
No, I did not our culture and culture did it don't blame me. Okay, I'm surrounded forever

[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:52.440]
And the fact she's got the cool slaw on all the

[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.880]
Cool slaw and a cheese

[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.200]
And believe me that ain't Russian dressing

[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:05.420]
There's another five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and horizon wireless line

[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:08.820]
Moe is up to 16.3 percent. Yes, we need harmony a QM

[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:13.360]
He's edging up there a little bit. He's trying his best. Okay. He's making a real honest effort

[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.540]
I get a little credit for that not too much

[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:21.180]
But I do I want to look at this thing openly honestly. I want to have it open mind. Don't I? No, huh?

[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.160]
I know George does because George is like he's got him right there

[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:27.040]
You know like look at him at the face you keep you keep having these encounters

[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:27.540]
I

[01:31:28.880 --> 01:31:31.360]
It's not what I try to avoid and I had

[01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:32.280]
successfully

[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:33.800]
for

[01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:42.260]
And then all of a sudden there are in the same room encounters their advances. Maybe he's seeking you out

[01:31:42.260 --> 01:31:46.800]
Maybe when he whipped it out in the teardown, but he was trying to like send you a message. You know like Joey Zanzi

[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.600]
sending a message

[01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:51.180]
Maybe he was trying to say hey pal, he'd take a look at this. Okay

[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.660]
Well that old pipe smokers at a time maybe he'd like to you know

[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:04.260]
Here's Evan Tura. Hello. Hey, no, how you doing? I think it's really steel wool. Yes, sir

[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:07.120]
I might be your truck actor first of all with Mo

[01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:13.580]
Uh, I think that Mo has become clean. He has to come into your studio and sit on and reveal whether you really try to get George by it

[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.820]
Well, now he really called oh, he already admitted that to me. I already know that no

[01:32:17.820 --> 01:32:23.400]
But he needs to admit it to the audience. Oh, I'm in the air right. That'll be the day about with with with with

[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:28.020]
Joe Rose and with George Rodriguez everything he has to come clean with everything

[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:34.640]
Secondly with the Russian Embossed situation. I blame the fpn number one because it's like they're trying to make this guy mainstream

[01:32:35.020 --> 01:32:39.120]
And when they try to make a mainstream mainstream then they're gonna try to make the public think that oh

[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.800]
They don't care what they don't care what they make him as long as they can use them and manipulate them to get bigger ratings

[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:47.600]
Which seems to be what they're already accomplishing and you know because it's all about money

[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.900]
They don't give a crap about what they make him as long as they can use him and his popularity to get people to tune it in

[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:55.640]
But I think it's twofold to it. I think that's that's true

[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:01.200]
But it has a they have deviants plans also because a lot of them are little races not super public is in their shoes

[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.560]
But they want to try make them mainstream

[01:33:03.220 --> 01:33:07.160]
Number two with that is that the a lot of these black players and they're gonna be on a shaboy card

[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:11.280]
Yes, you nation going to show and you know if I they should be the ones that really speak up

[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.760]
You know they get a little complacent

[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.720]
They make a little bit of money get complacent and they say oh everything's good

[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:21.980]
But meantime these people are in the back door trying to school everybody over. I mean the comedy is so inane

[01:33:21.980 --> 01:33:28.800]
It's so idiotic it will be like shan. Oh, well, let me just try to make Rick and William's look good because they're overblowing his performance because they want to make a

[01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:31.060]
Black running back look good, you know

[01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:31.460]
I

[01:33:32.100 --> 01:33:39.760]
It's just insanity. Well, I said any different really from any other things that you said it's not it's not and in another thing

[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.080]
As far as the the leak in the White House as far as them exposing that

[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:49.440]
Um the guys white that just go show you how they don't care about the lives all these soldiers that are being killed

[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:55.500]
Or there why would think I think you're less about one woman who were sent to CIA because of a husband embarrassed well said well said I

[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:59.760]
Needle think it easy. Thanks palying good call five six seven oh five sixty ran oh

Uh, I just had a comment on honor running it for governor in California. Yeah, really it really shouldn't surprise anybody

[01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:37.240]

[01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:38.780]

You're at Murphy George Murphy

[01:34:42.860 --> 01:34:49.360]

[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.880]

[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:18.240]

[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:19.320]
Hello

[01:35:20.300 --> 01:35:26.100]
Astila vista baby time to terminate great Davis you know, I mean the man is so god damn you a little bit stupid

[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:32.800]
Then you have to be a moron right? So I guess what the message is is that 40% of the registered voters in California

[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.540]
The ones that are going to show up must be moron absolutely correct

[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:39.440]
Right, I think I got my finger on it

[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:40.420]
boy

[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.320]
Where is that press conference already with Donahueck McNeum?

[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:46.720]
I would love to see them firewashed limbaugh's ass off of there

[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.500]
Not that it makes any difference. He's a multi-millionaire. He's making tons of money from his goddamn shows

[01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:56.160]
He's syndicated on 650 stations from coast to coast probably because his agent isn't like an overgrown child

[01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:00.400]
Probably because he's got a good agent. I'm surfing channels feverishly right now

[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:06.300]
No, no, yeah, I got it on CNN. They said that they're going to carry a lot. They showed the uh the setup where they had a microphone for the press conference

[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:12.500]
But uh it is not yet believe trust me what I tell you it'll be on there. Just don't panic stay calm like us. No, I mean

[01:36:13.980 --> 01:36:24.020]
Here's dear field hello. Hey, no, yes sir. I was watching TV a couple days ago. Has anyone called in common about Rick Sanchez coming back to South Florida?

[01:36:24.140 --> 01:36:27.240]
Not a one your kid me on NBC six

[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:30.540]
They are going to have the Rick Sanchez show

[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:35.340]
Oh, well, we knew that was coming but I know that yeah, well, what happened?

[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:37.760]
I already have a homosexual relation

[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.680]
So I might as well have one with you two. Yeah, you wonder what happened with one

[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:48.160]
Hello, you said you wonder what happened with one? Well, he was with that mess. NBC. I was a very short term

[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:54.220]
Right, right, and they found out that he was embarrassing and melodramatic and ridiculous and had no credibility

[01:36:54.220 --> 01:37:01.260]
He said hey, Rick bye-bye. I wonder if his first topic on the show should be drums driving on roads or anything like that

[01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:06.220]
And he will probably give us an update on that guy who's still dead by the way. He ain't saying much from what I heard

[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:08.120]
Uh the temperature is so I will it

[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:16.580]
What is it? What is it temperature up there? Am I asked oh right now? Yes, sir. I'll tell you what it is right this second. Oh wait a minute

[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.680]
Wait a minute. I gotta go

[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:24.100]
Auto service expert. It's a 50 but I gotta go back to um see it on the planet in the league who are African

[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:31.460]
Or the kids that are in college who have dreams of playing on this level or kids in high school who are you know

[01:37:31.900 --> 01:37:37.000]
Are using all of the African-American quarterbacks as you know a role model

[01:37:37.660 --> 01:37:43.360]
You know either lies enough. You know now when you say that you know now that they feel well

[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:49.260]
If I go out here and I say that I'm on down in the McNabb or I'm gonna don't take cold pepper or a Michael Vick

[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.180]
Yeah, how about Michael Vick? He's got good on

[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.420]
You know because of the color my skin

[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:01.680]
You know and and that's sad because you know you have kids that are African-American you have kids that are Caucasian

[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.840]
Asian kids, you know you have kids all across the world who who wear our jerseys

[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:10.860]
You know kids who watch the things that we do and say you know

[01:38:10.860 --> 01:38:13.560]
He's the best player in the league. I want to be just like him

[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.120]
But when you sit there at pinpoint a guy because of the color of his skin

[01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.080]
Uh

[01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.900]
And not really pretty much on just just performance or you know the things he's been able to do while

[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:29.800]
That kind of makes you look like you know you're the bad guy

[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:39.700]
You know what um, I look at this situation. I say I don't need a personal project, you know

[01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:44.280]
What is that gonna you know you've already said it you've thought about it

[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.400]
Uh, so you had time to think about before you said it

[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:51.460]
So when you say it, you know what some I'm sorry gonna do

[01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:55.000]
You know, it's like saying here. I'm gearing and Hitler if they would have said I'm sorry

[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:58.100]
I wouldn't have got the job done. I think that's what he's trying to say. Uh-huh. If you ask me

[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:01.960]
Anyway, it's sunny and 52 is gonna be the high today. It's 50 right now. It's a beautiful day

1158 at 560 WQM if you're fat. It's never a beautiful day

It's always a gloomy day because no matter what the weather's like outside inside you're eating your guts out because you're not happy being fat

[01:39:12.740 --> 01:39:17.380]

[01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:36.980]
367 votes on a poll, Shaneel of Seppmo Howard David, its overtures of peace and love.

[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.940]
Absolutely not, we hate Moe, 118, 32.1%, almost a turd.

[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.480]

Only if Moe paints his bald spot, 66.

Yes, we need harmony at WQM, 61.16.6% say we need harmony at QAM.

[01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:58.020]
Who's Moe Howard David at 53? 14.4%.

[01:42:58.020 --> 01:42:59.460]
People must be liking a cocoon.

[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.880]
Oh, see, there we go, Neil, what I just said.

[01:43:02.120 --> 01:43:02.560]
cocoon.

[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.200]
Oh, look at that phone, man.

[01:43:05.300 --> 01:43:07.740]
All of a sudden, like it, when noon came, they just all finished.

[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.920]
56670560.560 on a AT&T and Verizon line.

[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:14.260]
Hi, Alia, hello.

[01:43:15.780 --> 01:43:16.220]
Hello?

[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:17.640]
Neil.

[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:18.360]
Yes.

[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:19.320]
Yes, yes.

[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:20.460]
I enjoy your show.

[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.980]
I just heard about that ridiculous statement that I rushed to him about me.

[01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:26.900]
But you know, I'm glad that he came on.

[01:43:27.020 --> 01:43:28.080]
I heard of some of the one there.

[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.700]
He did talk intelligently about that.

[01:43:30.860 --> 01:43:31.820]
I mean, what a fool.

[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.380]
There's something like that.

[01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:35.100]
I just want to say hello to you.

[01:43:35.180 --> 01:43:37.860]
I enjoy your show as much as I can when I get a chance to listen.

[01:43:37.860 --> 01:43:41.220]
I'm a truck driver, so I don't give you a lot because I'd be out of time.

[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:44.340]
But every chance I get a tune in to you, I enjoy your show a lot.

[01:43:44.460 --> 01:43:45.160]
You have a good date, Neil.

[01:43:45.200 --> 01:43:45.500]
You too.

[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:45.960]
Thanks, Pelle.

[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.340]
I enjoyed as much as I can, too.

[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:48.400]
Some days not so much.

[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:51.100]
Well, like today, the phones are kind of like quiet, but then that's the way it is

[01:43:51.100 --> 01:43:52.200]
because it's the Jew holidays.

[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:53.300]
Oh, see, there he goes again.

[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:58.540]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, and I guarantee you, here's my fearless,

[01:43:58.740 --> 01:43:59.360]
perilous prediction.

[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:00.920]
Nothing is going to happen to rush.

[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:01.920]
He won't be suspended.

[01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.420]
He won't be reprimanded.

[01:44:03.520 --> 01:44:04.860]
He won't do a goddamn thing.

[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:07.060]
Okay, because that's his trade and stock anyway.

[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.320]
Is it stock and bail on hammer?

[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:10.840]
That's his whole deal.

[01:44:11.740 --> 01:44:14.100]
Is lion and saying outrageous ridiculous things.

[01:44:14.260 --> 01:44:16.640]
And the difference being, he doesn't say him from a comical standpoint.

[01:44:16.640 --> 01:44:18.140]
He means it.

[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:20.520]
He says it to appeal to that hateful,

[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:23.380]
that archived bunker mentality, which he's a classic example of,

[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:24.640]
well, the ain't for entertainment.

[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.240]
Piece of dreck.

[01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:33.200]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T of Verizon line.

[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:35.940]
The do not call things starts today allegedly.

[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:39.360]
They still got their wires crossed, those are the store and CBS news.

[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.460]
Government officials still predicting a large decline in telemarketing calls to

[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.100]
millions of registered phone numbers.

[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:49.320]
But there's this legal struggle going on back and forth to

[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.600]
and fro side by each.

[01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:54.580]
29 states now have their own do not call rules.

[01:44:54.780 --> 01:44:58.520]
And North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper says his state's new law is not

[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.120]
affected by federal court rulings and the incident.

[01:45:00.180 --> 01:45:00.700]
Government list.

[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.040]
He says we'll be enforcing our state do not call in North Carolina based on the

[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:06.780]
federal registry.

[01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.220]
And if they don't like it, they can jam it up.

[01:45:08.220 --> 01:45:09.620]
They're slowly white assed.

[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.160]
They didn't say that.

[01:45:11.460 --> 01:45:15.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:17.180]
And Verizon wireless line.

[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:18.320]
Here's a call from Tamarack.

[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:18.620]
Hello.

[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.560]
In the Ohio you doing pretty good.

[01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.080]
Listen, you know, a compability and culpability is important in society.

[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:28.380]
You know, give me the Greek lost his whole career and everything he had

[01:45:28.380 --> 01:45:30.740]
because he made an outrageous comment.

[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:32.320]
People thought it was outrageous.

[01:45:32.800 --> 01:45:36.780]
But in Rush Limbaugh, he won't suffer any consequences because of who he is and

[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.280]
in the upper echelon of the Republican party.

[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:40.700]
Right.

[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:42.400]
So what do we do?

[01:45:42.580 --> 01:45:47.760]
I mean, as a society, what do we do to correct these, you know, her dissatisfaction?

[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.540]
I think the most investing the public can do if they're pissed off about it is to watch

[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:52.520]
some other pre-game shooters.

[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:54.400]
A zidian other pre-game shows on Sundays.

[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:55.920]
He's not on the game telecast.

[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:58.400]
He's on a USB and a pre-game, which is on the cable.

[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:01.800]
And if people turn it off and watch you're one of the 50,000 other pre-game,

[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:05.000]
or just not watch any of them, then those numbers are going to go down.

[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:05.720]
That's what they can do.

[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:06.860]
That's a beautiful thing.

[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:07.820]
So people should do that.

[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:09.320]
And we should also like, you know,

[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:12.060]
with the God the Arnold Schwarzenegger running for governor of California.

[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:14.480]
I mean, if that's not the biggest, you know,

[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:17.780]
I don't even have a term to describe what it is.

[01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:19.060]
Yeah, it's beyond belief.

[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.200]
It's beyond human comprehension that there could be anybody that's stupid.

[01:46:22.540 --> 01:46:24.620]
I mean, I thought in the beginning, it's kind of like a joke,

[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:26.720]
for what he did, maybe five or seven or eight percent.

[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:29.740]
But the fact that he's got 40 percent in the latest polls and he's beating

[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.640]
boost them on him by like a landslide,

[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:34.540]
this has to tell you how many morons are right on a loose now.

[01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:37.980]
And you would think California would its economic repercussions.

[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.400]
I mean, it's like the fourth biggest economy in the world.

[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.080]
Why would they be voting for a more unlike this?

[01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.340]
Because there's a lot of morons lived there, I guess.

[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.920]
Okay, scary stuff, Nailed, scary stuff.

[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:48.920]
Good luck to you, pal.

[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:49.940]
You too, buddy.

[01:46:50.100 --> 01:46:50.860]
See an Agra Falls.

[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.980]
5670560, they got a nice casino there in Agra Falls, I should point out.

[01:46:55.440 --> 01:46:55.640]
Yeah?

[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:56.300]
Yeah.

[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:58.380]
Meet everybody right there at the border,

[01:46:58.540 --> 01:47:01.080]
right between Agra Falls and New York and Agra Falls, Ontario.

[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:02.360]
Come across.

[01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:03.580]
Wave your over.

[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:05.780]
We'll pass you over.

[01:47:07.500 --> 01:47:09.980]
5670560, what about that damn Rush Limbaugh, huh?

[01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:10.720]
Nothing's going to happen.

[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:11.980]
Davin's still a bad one, buddy.

[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:15.500]
I said, you know, we're looked upon as not human beings because we're getting paid,

[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:16.760]
you know, that much money.

[01:47:17.220 --> 01:47:20.200]
You know, it's something which I'm still looking for answers for.

[01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.440]
I mean, if it's ratings, did the ratings go up?

[01:47:24.240 --> 01:47:25.200]
No comment, huh?

[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.640]
Can you, can you imagine anybody saying,

[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.140]
in the context of the NBA and all the great players, Michael Jordan and all the big,

[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:35.660]
all the big superstars, the black superstars, can you imagine somebody coming on

[01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:39.560]
here and saying, well, the reason they're trying to make this guy look good is because

[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:44.060]
they want the media's really helping on making a white center look like a superstar on the NBA.

[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.660]
Can you imagine anybody ever saying that?

[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:49.700]
No, no, no, of course not.

[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:52.140]
They wouldn't even get home that night.

[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.420]
But Rush Limbaugh, man, in the right wing, they can do and say what I would have to

[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:59.600]
want because they got the context, they got the good connections.

[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:02.500]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:02.800]
Hello.

[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.020]
Good meal.

[01:48:05.300 --> 01:48:05.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:10.960]
On the move thing, I don't like him, but I like listening to him.

[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.700]
And I can't stand Pharaoh.

[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.160]
Pharaoh should not buy a house down there.

[01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:17.480]
He's liking somewhere land though or

[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:22.000]
staying Peter's bird or somewhere over over there somewhere.

[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:27.540]
I don't like Mo.

[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.440]
I'd rather listen to him.

[01:48:29.840 --> 01:48:30.700]
Hopefully than that.

[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:31.720]
Pharaoh fella.

[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:33.980]
Pharaoh, okay, I'll tell Pharaoh you said so.

[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:34.460]
Thank you.

[01:48:36.140 --> 01:48:36.540]
5670560.

[01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:38.220]
Lots of open lines here, boys and girls.

[01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:39.800]
It's really desperate, man.

[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:42.560]
pound 560 on a AT&T in Verizon.

[01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.200]
While a look at this, the shortest picture of a Russian at NFL Countdown.

[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:46.640]
Yes, sir.

[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:47.160]
It started all the cut.

[01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:49.680]
Just foaming and it looked like a hymrychimler in heat.

[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:51.360]
Yeah, and acid pounding the powder.

[01:48:51.360 --> 01:48:51.960]
Did you see it?

[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:52.200]
Sure.

[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.600]
pounding the podium.

[01:48:54.980 --> 01:48:57.200]
This is just the last thing they needed, man.

[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:00.160]
I guess it goes to sure that football so mediocre now,

[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.480]
they've decided that they have to really spruce it up and goose it up.

[01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:04.320]
They couldn't find another Howard Coase cell.

[01:49:04.500 --> 01:49:05.100]
Goose step it up.

[01:49:05.520 --> 01:49:07.520]
So they found this goose step or the goose step it up.

[01:49:09.580 --> 01:49:10.520]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:10.800]
Hello.

[01:49:11.620 --> 01:49:12.580]
I get afternoon, Neil.

[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.360]
Yes, sir.

[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:15.740]
You think I would get a football team in Toronto?

[01:49:16.240 --> 01:49:16.960]
The NFL?

[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:17.880]
No.

[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.160]
I'll come.

[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:20.820]
Because football ain't big here.

[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.240]
The Argos that don't drop flies.

[01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:23.720]
They're always on a verge of going out of business.

[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.060]
They talk about that, but football is just not big here.

[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:27.560]
It's too many other fish to fry.

[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:29.800]
But the basketball's doing really well.

[01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:32.420]
Bandit, well, the team sucks, but they do, they draw well.

[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.020]
They sell out.

[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.320]
Okay.

[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.660]
All right, thanks everybody.

[01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:36.340]
Okay.

[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:38.180]
The answer is no.

[01:49:38.260 --> 01:49:40.940]
No, I never have, I won't say never, but not any time in the near future.

[01:49:41.020 --> 01:49:42.240]
We won't have an NFL team in Toronto.

[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.560]
We got the hockey too big.

[01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:45.580]
Too big, even though they're going to suck this year.

[01:49:45.840 --> 01:49:48.020]
And you got lacrosse sold out in the air Canada center,

[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.400]
which is I'm using, but true.

[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.900]
And the Raptors did the draw very well.

[01:49:51.980 --> 01:49:53.520]
Like you said, even though their team sucks this year.

[01:49:53.840 --> 01:49:54.820]
But what can I tell you?

[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:57.160]
You can't, you can't be all things to all people.

[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:58.680]
Isn't that what somebody wants?

[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:00.900]
They didn't, George T. Farmer strong wants to say that?

[01:50:01.380 --> 01:50:01.860]
Something like that.

[01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:06.320]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT in T-Land.

[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.220]
Don't forget the official Marlins watch party is 3, 30 this afternoon.

[01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:10.500]
It's true, let's take two in Miami Lakes.

[01:50:10.860 --> 01:50:11.780]
Billy, the Marlin will be there.

[01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.420]
Marlin Murmur, it's interactive pitching games.

[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:15.920]
It'll be nice to know if Mad Dog's going to be to show again,

[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:17.480]
since it's like past noon already.

[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:20.060]
You would have think that one of our hot shot,

[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:23.880]
middle or upper level management people would have made a decision on it.

[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.080]
Maybe Mad Dog, what?

[01:50:25.360 --> 01:50:29.240]
Just like yesterday, the Mandage Production Crew will show up for work like they do.

[01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:30.880]
And you know, then they'll let us know.

[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:32.440]
Madagal.

[01:50:33.740 --> 01:50:37.940]
So in other words, our middle level management is uninvolved in these decision making processes.

[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.700]
Little level management doesn't tell us.

[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:41.080]
I see.

[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:43.860]
So like I said, we'll let you know where the Mad Dog's going to be between

[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.520]
two and three, 30, and then we got the watch party.

[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:46.480]
Then we got Game Two,

[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.320]
four, oh six this afternoon pre-game at three, 30.

[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.540]
If you're underpaid and are underappreciated,

[01:50:52.640 --> 01:50:55.680]
if your job is basically a pain in the ass and you're not getting anywhere on it,

[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.560]
if you're like walking on a treadmill, your feet are moving,

[01:50:57.680 --> 01:50:59.300]
but your life is staying in place,

[01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:01.860]

[01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:20.120]
Fast train offers job placement assistance,

[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.560]
and then take Todd Drex advice,

[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:45.440]
call tool free, one, eight, six, six fast train.

[01:51:45.540 --> 01:51:47.360]
That's my life and love.

[01:51:47.900 --> 01:51:49.700]
This is 440560.

[01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:51.900]
You ain't too way yet.

[01:51:58.660 --> 01:52:01.360]
The days from walking down the aisle

[01:52:02.340 --> 01:52:05.520]
with something inside his tendon

[01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:09.020]
then he tried to jump and gently as he opted to

[01:52:09.020 --> 01:52:10.120]
with Bentley and said,

[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:11.920]
I need a full-on cable.

[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:15.960]
Welcome, find yourself another troll.

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:17.560]
Ben said,

[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.940]
Todd, do the bunch.

[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.840]
And she went up and up.

[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:28.000]
A screaming and yelling as he drove away

[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.940]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[01:52:30.940 --> 01:52:35.020]
He grabbed up flight to Vegas

[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:38.880]
and hit all the street clubs.

[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.500]
And girls were grabbing his pants

[01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:43.180]
they were giving Ben a laugh

[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:46.120]
and he was hotter than the freaking clubs.

[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:47.660]
They said,

[01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:50.040]
bye to the butts.

[01:52:51.260 --> 01:52:53.680]
And she went up and up.

[01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:54.520]
Welcome.

[01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:58.000]
A screaming and yelling as he drove away

[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.100]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:05.020]
From the time he made me and gently

[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:08.460]
stay the head and make her call.

[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:12.120]
I understand that she leaves a couple

[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:16.440]
with such a feeling but the whole mess was a big damn wrong.

[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:20.100]
Ben all had to go use that stuff call.

[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:21.300]
Ben said,

[01:53:21.300 --> 01:53:23.740]
bye to the butts.

[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:27.420]
And she went up and up.

[01:53:27.420 --> 01:53:28.540]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.720]
A screaming and yelling as he drove away

[01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:34.620]
because they wouldn't have a wedding day.

[01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.520]
From 18 to 560,

[01:53:36.640 --> 01:53:38.240]
WDQM 402 votes on there.

[01:53:38.340 --> 01:53:39.020]
Not too shabby.

[01:53:39.080 --> 01:53:41.580]
Should nearly accept Mohawar David's overtures of peace and love.

[01:53:41.740 --> 01:53:44.880]
Absolutely not. We hate Mohawar 132, nearly 33%.

[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:45.220]
A third.

[01:53:45.820 --> 01:53:47.560]
Only if Mohawar paints his ball spot 73.

[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:49.260]
Only if Neal has no self-respect.

[01:53:50.100 --> 01:53:50.580]
72.

[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.460]
Yes, we need harmony of WDQM 66, 16.4%.

[01:53:55.460 --> 01:53:58.120]
And who's Mohawar David at 59.14 point?

[01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:58.740]
Some odd.

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:00.860]
So anyway, somebody mentioned this before.

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.860]
Ed Gray, who's a sports writer for the Boston Herald,

[01:54:03.080 --> 01:54:03.700]
out and proud.

[01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:07.140]
I'm going to read it.

[01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:09.180]
Do I have your permission to read it? Please, could you do it?

[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:11.280]
He says, I didn't strike out.

[01:54:11.340 --> 01:54:13.540]
I wasn't thrown out and above all, I wasn't forced out.

[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.000]
I'm out because I no longer in good conscience.

[01:54:16.220 --> 01:54:17.460]
Truth would ignore the unabashed homophobia

[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:19.460]
that is so cavalierly tolerated

[01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:21.020]
within the world of sports.

[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.320]
I'm out because the silence of a closet

[01:54:23.320 --> 01:54:26.160]
and a gay man only serves to give his implicit approval to bigotry.

[01:54:26.380 --> 01:54:28.700]
I'm out because I refuse to continue hiding from the truth

[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:31.480]
that an openly gay man has as much right as a straight man

[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.860]
to play sports or report on them.

[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:36.220]
Frankly, I'm out because I can't come up with a single logical reason

[01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:38.680]
why I should have denied myself the right to live and work as openly

[01:54:38.680 --> 01:54:40.320]
and freely as everybody else.

[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.300]
Nor should anyone find a reason why an openly gay athlete

[01:54:43.300 --> 01:54:45.140]
should be denied the right to play a team sport

[01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:47.980]
without fear of becoming a target of prejudice or physical harm.

[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:51.140]
In the cases of both a gay athlete and a gay sports writer,

[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:53.300]
homophobic athletes always come up with the same idea

[01:54:53.300 --> 01:54:56.160]
and the same sorry excuse to justify the perpetuation of prejudice

[01:54:56.160 --> 01:54:59.340]
on the basis of sexual orientation, the locker room.

[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:01.840]
What exactly does a straight athlete have to fear

[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:03.380]
from a gay teammate or sports writer?

[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.500]
Any man secure in his heterosexuality

[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:08.680]
should not have a cure in the world when a gay man is present in the locker room.

[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:11.160]
He's only there to earn a living not to infiltrate the locker room

[01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:13.700]
in a covert operation to convert straight athletes.

[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.440]
There are infinitely more friendly and healthy environments

[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:19.920]
in which a self-respecting gay man would prefer to explore his sexuality

[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.460]
than a locker room fullest-rate guys.

[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:24.560]
From the viewpoint of a sports writer, gay or straight,

[01:55:24.980 --> 01:55:27.620]
the professional locker room is a relatively hostile environment

[01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.640]
where too many athletes have there often us against the mentality

[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:31.340]
toward the media.

[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:33.780]
Reporters usually working on deadline

[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:36.460]
are only too glad to vacate the premises as soon as they're able

[01:55:36.460 --> 01:55:38.840]
to extract enough quotes to write their stories.

[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:41.800]
Should a gay athlete be braven up to come out during his career

[01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:44.740]
he'd spend considerably more time than a sports writer in a locker room

[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:47.140]
likely causing some teammates to feel uncomfortable.

[01:55:47.740 --> 01:55:49.960]
Being along a vast majority of straight teammates,

[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:53.500]
even a homophobic player would have to eventually realize that he's not so

[01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:56.640]
vulnerable that he should be intimidated by the presence of a single gay teammate.

[01:55:57.780 --> 01:56:01.080]
No active player in major professional sports team has ever come out

[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:04.620]
but former NFL players, Asara Tualo, who'd hell is that?

[01:56:04.980 --> 01:56:05.400]
Tualo?

[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:08.860]
And Dave Cope and former Major League baseball players,

[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.360]
Billy Bean and the Lake Glen Burke, surely aren't the only

[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:14.180]
closet gay athletes to share locker rooms with their straight teammates.

[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.440]
It wouldn't be surprising at all if their gay athletes

[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:19.840]
on a great many professional teams tolerated under a duplicitous

[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.220]
don't-ass-don't-tell understanding.

[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:24.880]
Somehow a gay teammate is only regarded as a threat if he's honest

[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:28.180]
and a stand-up guy, qualities that are usually valued in team sports.

[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:32.340]
In an effort to justify homophobia, some would claim that an openly gay player

[01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:34.600]
would become a distraction that would undermine his team.

[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:38.320]
A media frenzy surely would be created by a player coming out of a closet

[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:40.360]
but how long would a gay player be such a distraction

[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.960]
if all this teammates rallyed around him for the whole world of witness?

[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.720]
Professional athletes are role models and a demonstration of team solidarity

[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:50.100]
would send the profound message, we support our teammate and you should too.

[01:56:51.080 --> 01:56:53.780]
Obviously the climate is not ideal for a gay athlete to come out

[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:56.660]
when San Francisco 49ers running back, yours and Hurst can say,

[01:56:57.060 --> 01:57:01.060]
I don't want any faggits on my team and New York Giants Tide and Jeremy Shockey

[01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:05.100]
can call Dallas Cowboys Coach Bill Parcells a homo without any fear of being

[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.920]
suspended or filed by his team or the NFL.

[01:57:07.940 --> 01:57:11.020]
The gay community is the one minority that's still very much fair game

[01:57:11.020 --> 01:57:13.180]
for over-displays of prejudice in the world of sports.

[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.640]
While inroads toward achieving equality are slowly being made in the real world,

[01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.140]
a gay man is still expected to bear the burden of shame in the sports world.

[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:24.840]
He's got rights or whatever, really picture Tide Jones was quoted in Dead for Newspaper last spring

[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.820]
before being traded in the Red Sox but he shouldn't walk around proud.

[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:32.460]
I'm out and I'm exercising my right to walk around proud since Ed Gray.

[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:34.900]
How do you like that? Ed Gray and Aboston Herald.

[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:39.120]
I wonder since he covers sports that a hero does he get to see Tom Brady naked in the locker room?

[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.980]
Yeah, it's a perk.

[01:57:42.340 --> 01:57:43.480]
How you spell that?

[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:53.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line and a beautiful one too is what I hear.

[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:55.300]
A lovely perk.

[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:58.780]
What is that Bob Novak not she said of a bitch?

[01:57:59.140 --> 01:58:00.160]
He just had honor for a second.

[01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:03.900]
Later today, Jody, Bob Novak's going to be a guest on my five o'clock show.

[01:58:04.060 --> 01:58:07.960]
No, we can't wait Wolf Blitzkrieg and then Hungry Kim Alert Hermon Gearing is going to be on a perk

[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:10.060]
completely live to that T and Crumpets.

[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.300]
Blow the trumpet, it's staff at a crumpets.

[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:15.000]
What are crumpets anyway? Do we have any idea?

[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:16.420]
Oh, they look like this.

[01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.260]
Oh, about this size.

[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:20.820]
I mean similar to Courage and Way or Spotted Dick.

[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:23.760]
Here's Miami, Buenos dias.

[01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:25.180]
Hello?

[01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:26.040]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:26.380 --> 01:58:27.380]
Neil, A sign.

[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:28.240]

[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:29.380]
That telemarketing list.

[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:31.460]
Okay, that takes effect today.

[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:37.940]
There are 11 executives that work with those telemarketing companies that are on that list.

[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:41.440]
They themselves don't want to be called.

[01:58:42.540 --> 01:58:42.860]
Yeah.

[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:44.480]
Are you aware of that?

[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:46.280]
No, I was not aware of that, but I am now.

[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:47.700]
Yeah. Isn't that funny?

[01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:49.720]
Themselves? They put themselves on the list.

[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:54.180]
Who the hell in there right now would want to be bothered getting five, ten, fifteen calls a day for massholes?

[01:58:54.440 --> 01:58:55.120]
Who the hell wants that?

[01:58:55.420 --> 01:58:55.600]
Yeah.

[01:58:56.140 --> 01:58:58.620]
I mean I get paid to take calls for massholes, but that's it if it's true.

[01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:00.720]
All right, buddy, take care.

[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:01.760]
Thanks for the good news, Bob.

[01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:02.260]
Have a great day.

[01:59:04.220 --> 01:59:06.100]
Hold on, we're going to make it tomorrow's pot bigger.

[01:59:06.100 --> 01:59:08.320]
It's an angry thing. It's Wednesday. We got that one or two hour coming.

[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:10.080]
You know, because I can see these people are like, I don't know.

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:11.240]
They're a little off their feet this week.

[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:12.800]
It's the Jew holidays again, you know.

[01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:13.420]
Is that what it is?

[01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:16.160]
It's got to be. I told you that this morning before the show.

[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.160]
I've forgotten about that.

[01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:25.540]
I thought there's a fact that it says, is it just possible that the PR machine that helped install GW in the White House has used up Rush Limbaugh on his outgrown his purpose?

[01:59:26.340 --> 01:59:30.280]
Considering that possibility, the machine may just be allowing them to self-destruct so they can be rid of them.

[01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:31.160]
No, I don't think so.

[01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:37.260]
Beyond a doubt if the Bush Cabal wants a second term, they'll have to use a snow job on the American voting public.

[01:59:37.500 --> 01:59:44.860]
The closer it comes to election time, I can just imagine a kindler, gentler GW the second time around, and the Veronica public just might fall for it.

[01:59:45.240 --> 01:59:49.280]
Limbaugh's sole purpose was to muck Ray Clinton out of office. What purpose does he serve now?

[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:53.720]
He is yesterday's meatloaf and ready for the trash. Oh, that's an insult to meatloaf.

[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.080]
Maybe the garbage chute was just greased.

[01:59:57.280 --> 02:00:00.680]
Oh, yeah. He only tried by sliding his fan ass down there.

[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:04.520]
Here's another fact. I wonder if this is going to be accurate or not.

[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:07.840]
It says, making tomorrow's pot bigger in George Wants It right now.

[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:11.780]
In fact, he and the scot are going to sit around and pick out the seeds during the one to two hour.

[02:00:13.020 --> 02:00:24.460]
For Thursday's van hit from noon till two, with Joe Costello and Riva Yamaha, 3671 North-XI-I went to Pomato Beach with our vest of Neil Merchant-Ice, including those vaunted Mojaro David and Keychains and our CDs, etc.

[02:00:26.700 --> 02:00:28.900]
Endorse by Mojaro David and so on.

[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:31.420]
Yeah, that's right. Most have been plugged into Thanks Mo. Thanks a lot.

[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:34.360]
Absolutely. Even though the audience is hostile toward you. I mean, incredibly.

[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:39.540]
Here's the deal. I have five parotickets to see Alice Cooper in concert in Pomato Beach, amphitheater and

[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:49.220]
or eight parotickets to the Panther Lightning game at the ODC, O the Office Depot Center, at the Info Center on Saturday the 4th.

[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:53.920]
Well, that's the old exhibition game. So I mean, that's nice, but it's an exhibition hockey game.

[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:59.540]
And they're free. So at least they're trying. Miguel is trying. He's like trying to throw a little more crap in there.

[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:02.800]
I mean, good stuff to get people out there tomorrow so we can raise some bucks.

[02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:08.440]
It's been really tough. It's a tough year to raise money and I get all frustrated and flustered. But you know something that's good.

[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:13.960]
It's good that I do that because that like, embarrasses people. It works. They said a little bit tougher, but it works in the end.

[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.000]
That's what Mo said. He said it works. Absolutely.

[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:18.820]
In the end.

[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:24.500]
Here's a call from Lake Worth. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir.

[02:01:24.780 --> 02:01:27.760]
All right. Well, right in the background. I hope it's not too much from here.

[02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:35.680]
Don't hear from a couple of comments from earlier. The rushed limbaugh factor is just hilarious.

[02:01:35.900 --> 02:01:40.600]
Of course, you know, nothing will be done because afterwards there'll be hope. We missed a quick what he said.

[02:01:40.980 --> 02:01:43.280]
It was all of our fault. You made a mistake on that.

[02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.980]
The other one, the guy said, why don't we do what we're going to do about this next time around?

[02:01:47.100 --> 02:01:49.980]
We're going to do the same thing we could have done about the last six years.

[02:01:50.380 --> 02:01:56.860]
Oh, get off your dead rear. Quick. Come on. People next year go to the next time I'm going to make damn sure next year election time.

[02:01:56.960 --> 02:01:58.820]
I'll be down here and I'm going to be voting all day long.

[02:01:59.040 --> 02:02:08.240]
And I think the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing is no difference than the supposed poll showing the president popularity.

[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:15.780]
I think we will in the back you just as though the popular vote when it's nowhere near half the people anywhere in this country could care less for him.

[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:18.760]
Let alone in ever having a fifth. I don't know if you're ready or anything here.

[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:22.880]
That's enough. Enough. There's distorted my numbers. The same thing they do with California.

[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:30.840]
One of the one of the worst stories that I've seen in ages. I have it in my head right now as many as a million ballots could go on count on election day next Tuesday.

[02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:37.760]
Throwing in the doubt for days or weeks. The outcome of the recall election because an unprecedented number of absentee ballots have been requested.

[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:46.000]
Two points seven million but fewer than half of it returned by voters thus far leaving a huge number of ballots likely to be handed in the pouring place to arrive at a male local election.

[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:49.960]
So you can see Desi will over again. It could do just like they didn't Florida.

[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:56.620]
They can get all these zillions of votes out there and then who the hell knows who's counting what and what how long you're going to be counting.

[02:02:56.820 --> 02:03:02.480]
You know when you're up nailed a show up within five days after the election and depending on which box they need them in. That's what they're up.

[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.840]
Yeah, exactly how it works and there'll be a bunch of bushies. There'll be a bunch of bushies that the elections headquarters pounding on the door.

[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.760]
Let us in. Let us in. We're dead.

[02:03:10.980 --> 02:03:14.260]
Yeah. Cutting residents. Excuse me. Hang on. Let me call town blaze off of the two in our next movement.

[02:03:14.700 --> 02:03:16.120]
Yeah. Where do we go next?

[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.820]
Exactly. We'll be there too. Absolutely. And I'll thank you.

[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:23.420]
Let's hang rush by a yard arm from the 12th Corps of writing. Sounds good.

[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:27.440]
Take care. Right in front of the barbershop. Right in front of that greased pool.

[02:03:28.780 --> 02:03:38.160]
The interesting thing about those in more disturbing, although nobody gives a crap no more, is that all of those people are outside the door there in the dead county pounding on the door like they were all imported from out of state.

[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:38.980]
They were like professional.

[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:39.600]
A smithers.

[02:03:41.140 --> 02:03:43.300]
1228 at 560 Q.A.M.

[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:48.040]
I'm not going to look at this. This is 560. The radio is on your.

[02:03:49.340 --> 02:03:50.660]
Q.A.M.

[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:55.980]
To G Gordon Lydia and they don't come any worse than Neil Rogers.

[02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:14.060]
Now that he is on the ticket here on her governor's always here.

[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:14.360]
Yeah.

[02:04:19.300 --> 02:04:25.600]
If he's voted in, there'll be a big change. You're going to feel the burn, you'll feel the pain.

[02:04:31.020 --> 02:04:38.060]
The lost he plans to pass in Cooldown to put you up like a blue yeah.

[02:04:44.060 --> 02:05:06.120]
If now Bill

[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:08.640]
I'm just watching around here.

[02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:10.820]
From pretty creative politicization of the NFL,

[02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:12.020]
maybe that's just what we needed.

[02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:12.380]
Not.

[02:05:12.460 --> 02:05:12.920]
No, right.

[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.620]
They've already got, you know, basically what

[02:05:14.620 --> 02:05:16.820]
it boils down to is that almost all of the black athletes,

[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.000]
those who are even interested in politics,

[02:05:19.060 --> 02:05:21.100]
are like Democrats, and the white athletes,

[02:05:21.340 --> 02:05:22.920]
and that's just in football, but in sports generally,

[02:05:23.340 --> 02:05:24.300]
are right-wing Republicans.

[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.400]
Not just your regular ordinary, but like board again,

[02:05:26.400 --> 02:05:28.620]
like Steve Lardzend and Jim Bunning and that ilk.

[02:05:29.500 --> 02:05:31.060]
And vinegar bent my self.

[02:05:31.220 --> 02:05:31.760]
People like that.

[02:05:32.060 --> 02:05:33.140]
Never vinegar bent my self?

[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:33.520]
Who got?

[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:34.060]
No.

[02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:35.020]
First night.

[02:05:35.020 --> 02:05:36.140]
Wait before your time.

[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:36.920]
I know Steve Lardzend.

[02:05:37.240 --> 02:05:39.960]
It's a sports thing, man, because you got to be a right-wing,

[02:05:40.140 --> 02:05:42.620]
you got to be macho, you got to go to those Christian prayer

[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.840]
breakfast, you got to be full of crap, basically.

[02:05:45.640 --> 02:05:47.480]
Because they're all like, you know, involved in not all,

[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:49.260]
but most of them are involved in all these orgies,

[02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:51.080]
you know, these gang bangs, and they're like booze in there

[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:52.740]
and a little big time stuff like that.

[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:54.740]
By the way, did Brian Greasy ever get up?

[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:57.500]
Huh?

[02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:58.660]
Because I kept hearing that.

[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:00.920]
I kept hearing that fellow down, bro.

[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:03.840]
I'm just wondering if you can come on, Brian,

[02:06:03.840 --> 02:06:04.860]
get up already, okay?

[02:06:05.520 --> 02:06:06.340]
They're paying you a lot of money.

[02:06:06.420 --> 02:06:07.460]
Let's give it a shot after,

[02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:09.940]
they're gonna be a tough game for a J this weekend.

[02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:13.880]
Isn't it interesting that the Marlins are playing the Giants

[02:06:14.620 --> 02:06:16.480]
and the dolphins are playing the Giants?

[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:19.320]
Almost at the same time, almost side by each.

[02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:21.500]
That'll save that in Canada.

[02:06:23.120 --> 02:06:24.980]
Here's an interesting story, very depressing.

[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:28.180]
Actually, it's a letter to the editor in the Spokesman Review,

[02:06:28.200 --> 02:06:29.700]
which is a Spokean Locked News paper.

[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:30.640]
How was my first job?

[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:31.600]
What?

[02:06:31.780 --> 02:06:32.960]
Delivering the Spokesman Review.

[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:34.620]
What are you talking about?

[02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.400]
I won awards.

[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:37.740]
If you wait long enough, sooner or later, comes in handy.

[02:06:39.020 --> 02:06:40.520]
Randy and Pam Forceier,

[02:06:40.520 --> 02:06:41.300]
when you shut up a minute,

[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:43.700]
Randy and Pam Forceier have Spokean right?

[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:46.460]
Soldier must pay for his trip home.

[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:49.780]
We are usually quiet individuals,

[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:52.400]
expressing little about world events and politics, et cetera.

[02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:54.820]
However, we have to stand up and say something now.

[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:56.840]
Our son-in-law is in the Army,

[02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:58.660]
serving our country for several months in Iraq.

[02:06:59.180 --> 02:07:01.540]
He was recently authorized to return home for two weeks.

[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:03.120]
We're grateful for this news.

[02:07:03.320 --> 02:07:04.300]
However, there's one catch.

[02:07:04.800 --> 02:07:06.000]
He has to pay for the journey.

[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:09.600]
How can the government expect him to pay his own airfare?

[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:11.000]
It seems unfair.

[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:13.360]
The government won't put the bill to send troops home

[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:15.120]
after they risk their lives for our country.

[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.440]
They've had to leave their family struggling emotionally

[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.260]
and some financially.

[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:19.840]
Then when they do have the opportunity

[02:07:19.840 --> 02:07:21.980]
to come home briefly, they're expected to pay their own way.

[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:23.460]
This is an atrocity.

[02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:25.180]
And too often, there's no way

[02:07:25.180 --> 02:07:26.880]
some of these families can afford the airfare.

[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.220]
Our country is spending a fortune on behalf

[02:07:29.220 --> 02:07:30.060]
of another country,

[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:32.200]
but our fighting forces should be the main priority,

[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:34.160]
including traveling home for a reprieve.

[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.460]
We truly believe our armed forces should be rewarded

[02:07:36.460 --> 02:07:38.060]
with a paid visit to their loved ones.

[02:07:38.300 --> 02:07:41.220]
Don't you say Randy and Pam Forci have spoke in Washington

[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.280]
and it is morning spokesman review.

[02:07:44.140 --> 02:07:45.740]
Is that pathetic or what?

[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:46.440]
Oh, God.

[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:51.640]
But you see, there is no outrage in America.

[02:07:51.900 --> 02:07:54.220]
It's just like the thing with limbo.

[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:55.120]
It's any of the stuff.

[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:55.900]
There's no outrage.

[02:07:56.760 --> 02:07:58.080]
People don't give a crap anymore.

[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:00.260]
And that's why they're in America's industry

[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:01.220]
that it's in right now.

[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:05.460]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, there's one call on the board.

[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.460]
Like I said, there's no interest.

[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:07.040]
Here's Hollywood.

[02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:08.140]

[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:12.560]
I don't think they're even there.

[02:08:13.040 --> 02:08:13.460]
Hello, hello?

[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.340]
Yes, sir.

[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:15.580]
How are you?

[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:16.260]
Okay.

[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.960]
I have a question for you.

[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:20.200]
Get back to the end grade.

[02:08:20.780 --> 02:08:21.980]
That's the general's name.

[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:22.520]
Yes.

[02:08:23.260 --> 02:08:23.400]
Okay.

[02:08:24.400 --> 02:08:26.660]
You know, if you have a male coach or a female coach

[02:08:26.660 --> 02:08:28.660]
and a coach or team with the opposite gender,

[02:08:28.960 --> 02:08:32.140]
they have to wait until the team is dressed or undressed

[02:08:32.140 --> 02:08:33.280]
before they can go into locker room.

[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:33.580]
Correct?

[02:08:34.600 --> 02:08:35.180]
I don't know.

[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:35.940]
I don't know.

[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.780]
I know that they do have female sports writers

[02:08:38.780 --> 02:08:39.580]
in men's locker rooms.

[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:40.800]
We saw that a long time ago.

[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:42.980]
That debate has been over for years.

[02:08:43.900 --> 02:08:47.860]
So my question was, should it be the same way for a gay writer

[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:50.600]
or a gay member of the media to have to wait until the same

[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:52.820]
section ready to...

[02:08:52.820 --> 02:08:54.860]
Did you hear what I just got to you saying?

[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:57.060]
Or are you like so determined to make your homophobic point

[02:08:57.060 --> 02:08:57.620]
that you don't...

[02:08:57.620 --> 02:08:59.200]
You have your blinders and your plugs in.

[02:08:59.460 --> 02:08:59.460]

[02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:01.520]
Okay.

[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:03.380]
So you should have made a difference that.

[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:04.340]
No, it should not.

[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:05.220]
Okay.

[02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:06.160]
That's all I want to know.

[02:09:06.400 --> 02:09:07.140]
Do you think that it should?

[02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:09.020]
Sure, I think.

[02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.020]
Why is that?

[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:13.360]
Well, this is a little bit from a male's point of view.

[02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:15.200]
I think every male is...

[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:16.240]
Let me ask you this question.

[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:17.860]
When you were in a high school, for example,

[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.160]
because I know when I was in a high school,

[02:09:19.340 --> 02:09:21.300]
we used to have to take showers together in gym class.

[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:22.940]
Okay.

[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:25.780]
Did they ask anybody, is there any homosexual in here?

[02:09:25.900 --> 02:09:26.920]
Are there any pansies in here?

[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:28.240]
Did they ask anybody that question?

[02:09:28.620 --> 02:09:30.000]
There were all these guys running around the show.

[02:09:30.100 --> 02:09:32.080]
Nobody was ever having any sex that I know of,

[02:09:32.200 --> 02:09:33.520]
but they were running around the show.

[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:35.600]
See, after you see one, so you've seen them all, okay?

[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:38.180]
See, there's this...

[02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:39.800]
Oh, my God, there's a fag in there.

[02:09:39.880 --> 02:09:41.120]
He's going to get all whipped up and excited.

[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.100]
Maybe start grabbing it, you know, or something like that.

[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:46.340]
Now, if I saw Tom Brady in there, I might get like a little emotional,

[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:47.660]
but I don't think I'd grab it.

[02:09:48.300 --> 02:09:48.760]
You might.

[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:52.160]
No, I would not, because self-preservation is very foremost in my mind.

[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:55.020]
Because he'd knock my lights out in about two seconds.

[02:09:55.720 --> 02:09:57.280]
I mean, what an idiotic comment.

[02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.960]
This is America for you again.

[02:09:59.300 --> 02:10:01.860]
Don't you think, and he completely ignore what I just said

[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:03.300]
about the women in men's locker room?

[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:04.520]
Don't get in his way.

[02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:06.900]
Right, don't try to mess on his point,

[02:10:07.020 --> 02:10:09.020]
because he's already got it in his mind that this ed gray

[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:10.120]
keep him out of the locker room

[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.480]
because these heterosexuals know they don't want to owe fags

[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:13.200]
to see them naked.

[02:10:13.520 --> 02:10:14.380]
Oh, my God.

[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:15.340]
Whoo!

[02:10:17.320 --> 02:10:19.220]
Especially all those beautiful football players,

[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:21.820]
99% of whom nobody is interested in touching anyway.

[02:10:22.160 --> 02:10:23.660]
Especially the big, Parker alignment.

[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:27.260]
Maybe Tom Brady could put him off like in a cubby hole

[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:28.100]
or off to the side.

[02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:28.540]
Don't want to say?

[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:32.920]
Give him his own shower facility.

[02:10:33.820 --> 02:10:34.560]
What an asshole.

[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:36.240]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[02:10:36.300 --> 02:10:38.360]
pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line.

[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:40.080]
Here's a call from Davy.

[02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:40.320]
Hello.

[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:41.380]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:42.120]
Yes, sir.

[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:45.140]
There's a story last week in the regular news.

[02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:48.460]
I think it was on CBS News that's similar to the one you just read.

[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:51.400]
When the troops got wounded in a rock,

[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:54.780]
they bring them over to Bethesda and they were charging them for their meals.

[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:55.640]
Right.

[02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:57.400]
Yes, we had that surround our website, right?

[02:10:57.460 --> 02:10:57.620]
Yeah.

[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.220]
Also, I find it very strange that just now your collars are starting to realize

[02:11:04.220 --> 02:11:05.400]
that Rush Lombard's a fraud.

[02:11:06.180 --> 02:11:06.380]
Yeah.

[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:09.520]
Well, how do you know just now that they're starting to realize that?

[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.660]
Well, they're, they're, they're, because obviously the, he's on right now.

[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:14.660]
His radio shows that the people are talking to me now.

[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:17.900]
Are people who are choosing this program over his fraudulent bullcrap?

[02:11:18.080 --> 02:11:19.880]
So I think they've been on the wood for a long time.

[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:21.380]
Yeah, but you know what though?

[02:11:21.380 --> 02:11:23.200]
The right wingers, they're not playing fair.

[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:24.820]
They, it's all politics anyway.

[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:28.140]
I mean, you know, every, what do you, what does that mean?

[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:29.000]
They're not playing fair.

[02:11:29.140 --> 02:11:32.080]
Every time, every time the Clintons had a bad bowel movement,

[02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:32.880]
they had an independent council.

[02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:34.080]
Yeah.

[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:36.360]
And when you really need an independent council,

[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:39.540]
the Senate yesterday wouldn't even take it up on the floor.

[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:42.900]
But isn't that kind of an oxymoronic idea of right wingers playing fair?

[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:44.620]
I mean, when's the last time you heard of that?

[02:11:44.640 --> 02:11:44.800]
Right.

[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:45.680]
It's not the truth.

[02:11:45.980 --> 02:11:46.200]
Yeah.

[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:46.700]
Not the truth.

[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:47.380]
Which is right.

[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:50.080]
What the, see, this is, I was just thinking during the last break.

[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:54.860]
Here, here's Maria Schriver, who's a member of this Kennedy family and her mother, by the way.

[02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:57.380]
And oh, yes, we're all for Arnold.

[02:11:57.540 --> 02:11:59.840]
And he's going to make a great governor of California, all of a sudden the crap.

[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:04.140]
And in the meantime, even setting aside the fact that he's a moron and he's illiterate,

[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:06.840]
the fact that this is part of a Republican power play.

[02:12:07.100 --> 02:12:10.040]
And it was financed by a right wing Republican manipulator.

[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:11.560]
And that, that's what this is all about.

[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:12.320]
It's a virtual world.

[02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:12.940]
And they like to read again.

[02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:14.940]
Don't confuse the Kennedy family with the facts.

[02:12:14.940 --> 02:12:16.220]
I guess I mean, it's pathetic.

[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:16.800]
Yes.

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:17.420]
Yes.

[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:18.000]
Exactly.

[02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:22.500]
So trying to find anybody in America who stands on principle anymore is not easy.

[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.820]
Yeah, but you know the people out there, they don't, if they don't wake up,

[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.820]
we're going to get another four years of this clown in the White House.

[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:29.260]
Yeah.

[02:12:29.500 --> 02:12:34.060]
They think it really does scare me to see what he's going to do because if we went down this path

[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:37.780]
in less than three years, what will we do with him having five more years?

[02:12:38.440 --> 02:12:39.360]
Come to Canada, man.

[02:12:39.460 --> 02:12:40.760]
Progress being made here every day.

[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:41.600]
No, but I'm not joking.

[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:42.060]
I'm serious.

[02:12:42.060 --> 02:12:43.140]
I'm not joking either.

[02:12:43.240 --> 02:12:44.040]
I'm not joking.

[02:12:44.260 --> 02:12:44.800]
I'm not joking either.

[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.360]
I'm completely serious.

[02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:48.060]
He's a very scary man.

[02:12:48.200 --> 02:12:49.820]
He made the world scare your place.

[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:51.480]
Absolutely correct.

[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:55.340]
And the people need to wake up because you get out and vote and get this guy out of there.

[02:12:55.540 --> 02:12:58.760]
Because you know, he's the kind of person that if somebody would say, you know,

[02:12:59.200 --> 02:13:00.080]
we're going to do this.

[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:01.320]
Well, let me say this to you right now.

[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:04.420]
The fact that there are millions of people clamoring for his impeachment right now

[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:09.320]
if they're starting a bogus war based on lies tells you that the people probably are not going to wake up.

[02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:13.860]
Well, if they don't wake up, you know, we'll wake up in the morning and you'll see one of our cities just destroyed.

[02:13:14.180 --> 02:13:17.080]
Okay, well listen, set the alarm clock and let us know what time it's going to go on.

[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:18.600]
Wake up, George.

[02:13:18.940 --> 02:13:21.000]
1242 at 5.60, QAM.

[02:13:24.120 --> 02:13:27.340]
We're sports radio 5.60, QAM.

[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.160]
Lonely, drifting through life without direction.

[02:13:32.380 --> 02:13:36.280]
Then I want to talk to you about an exciting career as an episcopal bishop.

[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:39.640]
You see the flashy hand in robe are just the beginning.

[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:47.280]
There's the glitz glamour, plenty of TV coverage and a personally autographed 8 by 10 of Harvey Firestein with every archdiocese.

[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:49.300]
Commandments, shmanments.

[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.440]
We think of the more as suggestions.

[02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:53.280]
I mean, 10 Commandments are fine.

[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.220]
But if you can bat 300, it's fine with us.

[02:13:56.480 --> 02:13:57.540]
Catching's an option too.

[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:02.020]
Or if you're into the sweet science of boxing, you can always beat the bishop.

[02:14:02.020 --> 02:14:05.440]
Now if you're thinking, hey, I'm not episcopal, how can I be a bishop?

[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:06.080]
Don't worry.

[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:07.860]
We have two bishops that are Muslim.

[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:09.060]
Five atheists.

[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:13.700]
And a Buddhist bishop that lets you rub his belly for good luck before you play bingo down in Saint Latoya's.

[02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:14.560]
Join us.

[02:14:14.900 --> 02:14:18.620]
The few, the proud, the color coordinated episcopal bishops.

[02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.320]
1246 at 5.60 WDQM are a big one to two hour count up briefly.

[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:26.360]
And to show you how insane the certainly not news network is to show it a bunch of lunatics they are,

[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:27.680]
you see who they have on now?

[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:29.020]
Not yet.

[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:29.720]
Oh, there it is.

[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.140]
David Limbaugh, Russian brother, this good braiding boy in Christian,

[02:14:34.740 --> 02:14:37.440]
who's written this ludicrous book called Persecution.

[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.920]
Now see, the first question we'll pass him is if this is the real reason,

[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:43.400]
the timing for this that they have in honor.

[02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:47.160]
Well, any comments that you might have about your brother Russian is latest flammable,

[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:48.520]
the SBN and Donovan McNeath.

[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:49.960]
Well, I've been on a book tour.

[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:51.040]
I'm out of the loop on that.

[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:52.180]
So I really can't comment.

[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:54.740]
I'm not a spokesman of my brother, sure.

[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:59.700]
And wolf's response is, oh, well, of course we know that your brother can speak from us.

[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:00.580]
He's not shy.

[02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:01.940]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.620]
And what's this whole piece on?

[02:15:03.700 --> 02:15:09.480]
It's a puff piece to promote his book Persecution, which the thrust, the crux of it is,

[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:12.280]
that Christianity in America is being treated like a disease,

[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:15.160]
and that Christians are persecuted to the US.

[02:15:15.460 --> 02:15:15.660]
Right.

[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:16.740]
Right.

[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.720]
So here's this asshole on there.

[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:22.180]
Another right-wing asshole is brother David Limbaugh.

[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:24.760]
Well, he's nothing to say about the other thing, because he's been on a book tour.

[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:26.020]
He don't know nothing about it.

[02:15:26.120 --> 02:15:26.740]
He didn't know nothing.

[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.580]
Just like the Nazis, they didn't know nothing.

[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:31.120]
How do you like that?

[02:15:32.520 --> 02:15:33.320]
I don't.

[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:34.840]
459 votes on a poll.

[02:15:35.020 --> 02:15:40.220]
Shaneel of Seth Mohar, David is overtures of peace and love, which he's really trying very hard.

[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:41.200]
We'll say that for him.

[02:15:41.320 --> 02:15:41.740]
That'd be funny.

[02:15:43.220 --> 02:15:44.020]
Absolutely not.

[02:15:44.140 --> 02:15:45.360]
We hate Moa 155.

[02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.540]
33.7% over a third.

[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:48.720]
What do you ever do to them?

[02:15:49.420 --> 02:15:51.320]
Only if Moe paints his bald spot 80.

[02:15:51.860 --> 02:15:53.940]
Only if Neil has no self-respect 79.

[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:56.860]
So you add those three categories and you got almost 70%.

[02:15:56.860 --> 02:15:59.320]
Yes, we need a harmony of QA and 77.

[02:16:00.020 --> 02:16:01.340]
16.7%.

[02:16:01.860 --> 02:16:04.680]
Say we need harmony of QA and 68.

[02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:06.140]
14.8%.

[02:16:06.140 --> 02:16:07.200]
Say who's Mohar David?

[02:16:08.060 --> 02:16:09.420]
How to 459 vote.

[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:13.640]
Anyway, there is hope for the future boys and girls in his name is Howard Dean.

[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:18.560]
Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, Pope, funded his fundraising success.

[02:16:18.900 --> 02:16:22.320]
Yesterday in his first appearance on a J Leno show last night, they showed a clip.

[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:24.180]
In a film clip,

[02:16:25.020 --> 02:16:25.580]
Dean was,

[02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.040]
Dean was showing playing a guitar on a street next to science,

[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:34.040]
reading your change for real change and will strum for presidency.

[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.060]
People were showing placing money in an open guitar case, kind of like you see on the dam rack and I'm stood up.

[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.220]
Posted updates on his website showed Dean had raised more than $14.2 million in a three month period,

[02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:48.120]
breaking the Democratic presidential record for a single quarter,

[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:51.920]
said by then President Clinton raised 10.3 million over three months in 1995.

[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:56.340]
Earlier in the day, Dean campaigned in the intercity of L.A. promising jobs,

[02:16:56.540 --> 02:17:01.260]
health care and a dialogue on race and a meeting with local leaders along with skeptical of politicians' promises.

[02:17:01.780 --> 02:17:05.200]
Dean didn't call for money but rather a sale president bush for what the Democrats said

[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:08.260]
was the government's failure to put money into blighted urban areas.

[02:17:08.760 --> 02:17:13.640]
The former Vermont governor also promoted his plans for widespread healthcare coverage and education funding

[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:15.640]
and promised work for creating jobs in intercitys.

[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.360]
He also supported affirmative action.

[02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:22.920]
We have a 400 year old legacy of Jim Crow and slavery and that's not going to become overcome

[02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.360]
because we all have good intentions, he said.

[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:30.300]
Dean called for a national dialogue on racial issues saying whites can be indifferent to the plighted minorities.

[02:17:30.620 --> 02:17:31.800]
Like Rush Limbaugh for example.

[02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:39.780]
I mean, yeah, I can't stop thinking about how stupid this is because in the wake of Jim Brown and Bobby Mitchell

[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:45.480]
and Walter Payton and Gail Sayers and all the great black running backs in the history of the National Football,

[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:51.880]
he would be like saying, well, they wanted to make Ricky Williams see what that really is because the media is obsessed with making a black running back look way.

[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:54.940]
It's just stupid, there have been lots of very successful black quarterbacks.

[02:17:55.640 --> 02:18:03.000]
I forgot all about Michael Vick who just as a pure athlete may be the best of them all just for athletic ability.

[02:18:04.160 --> 02:18:09.120]
But no, here comes this bag of right wing pompous crap and what do we get on CNN?

[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:12.240]
We get his brother there, how could about how Christians are persecuted in America?

[02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:13.580]
Oh my God.

[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:20.020]
Well, let's create if you ever if you ever put your damn bearded push on my screen, I just turned it off.

[02:18:20.020 --> 02:18:21.340]
I won't watch him.

[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:24.300]
I'm watching the CBC.

[02:18:24.700 --> 02:18:26.740]
Oh, that whole question of whistle blowing.

[02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:29.920]
Yes, either talking about blowing on CBC. That's more like it.

[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:33.180]
Yeah, that's the kind of politicians we like like Bubba blowing.

[02:18:33.380 --> 02:18:34.260]
I change on the agenda.

[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:35.980]
I'm a high brow like Jerry. Right.

[02:18:37.060 --> 02:18:37.720]
Somebody's back.

[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:40.080]
Is he out again?

[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:42.700]
Oh, he's everywhere.

[02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:46.340]
President has directed the White House to cooperate fully.

[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:48.420]
That message was sent.

[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.580]
Yeah, there's too much leaking.

[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:50.640]
Quartz Gordon, White House.

[02:18:50.760 --> 02:18:52.440]
Okay, somebody's got a bladder infection up there.

[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:54.720]
Somebody's got a real serious problem.

[02:18:55.020 --> 02:18:58.120]
Oh, I like the guy that called earlier, the dark complexity guy called early in the show.

[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:58.640]
He had a good point.

[02:18:58.720 --> 02:19:03.020]
If they don't care about all these soldiers, we're getting killed over there in Iraq for no good reason at all based on a bunch of lies.

[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.620]
What makes us think that they give a crap about the life of one woman who was a CIA operative?

[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:07.900]
What the hell do they care about her?

[02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:08.440]
Do they care?

[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:08.720]
No.

[02:19:08.720 --> 02:19:08.940]
No.

[02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:11.920]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:19:12.100 --> 02:19:12.240]
Hello.

[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:14.760]
Your boy.

[02:19:15.700 --> 02:19:16.900]
Lady in the North Miami.

[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:17.200]
Hello.

[02:19:19.220 --> 02:19:19.620]
Gone.

[02:19:19.740 --> 02:19:21.320]
Did she just disappear, Lady North Miami?

[02:19:21.540 --> 02:19:21.940]
Just hung up.

[02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:23.220]
No, here she is.

[02:19:23.220 --> 02:19:23.520]
Hello.

[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:24.560]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:19:24.700 --> 02:19:25.240]
Good show.

[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:26.320]
Yes, it is.

[02:19:26.420 --> 02:19:27.360]
And I agree with you.

[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:28.640]
And I'm a poor woman.

[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:29.140]
Oh, it's her.

[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:31.440]
That the government wants her.

[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:32.620]
Who's who she?

[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.100]
Who's her?

[02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:34.440]
The chronic island lady hates you.

[02:19:34.600 --> 02:19:34.920]
Hates me.

[02:19:35.080 --> 02:19:35.900]
Rips calls Dove.

[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:36.680]
Calls the front office.

[02:19:36.680 --> 02:19:38.040]
Is this the crazy island lady?

[02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:39.860]
I think it's part of it.

[02:19:39.860 --> 02:19:40.900]
Yeah, it's the crazy island lady.

[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:41.140]
You're right.

[02:19:41.700 --> 02:19:42.820]
Get some help, sweetheart.

[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:44.260]
Here's Dear Field.

[02:19:44.420 --> 02:19:44.580]
Hello.

[02:19:46.520 --> 02:19:47.340]
Dear Field.

[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:48.320]
Yeah.

[02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:49.200]
Neil.

[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:49.980]
Yes sir.

[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:50.120]

[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:55.400]
I just wanted to make a comment about, you know, people talking about Rush Limbo's race.

[02:19:55.760 --> 02:19:56.380]
Those comments.

[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:00.700]
How about the Scab for Elle this morning, implied that everybody's stupid except the Jews.

[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:03.620]
I think he ought to zip up the...

[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:04.180]
Yeah, yeah.

[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.180]
I'm sure he was dead serious about it too, sir.

[02:20:06.180 --> 02:20:08.680]
You know, lighting up a little bit about five shades, you jackass.

[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:16.460]
See, one thing for Elle and you were truly not about this, you know, we're well known for being wiseasses and comedians and all this other...

[02:20:16.460 --> 02:20:18.660]
Well, Rush Limbo, I want to think he is not as funny.

[02:20:18.940 --> 02:20:20.920]
Okay, there's nothing funny about a big fat Nazi.

[02:20:21.460 --> 02:20:22.740]
Ask Hermann Gehring, he'll tell you.

[02:20:23.740 --> 02:20:24.960]
In my envelope.

[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:27.360]
Is this school 20-year-old bicycle?

[02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:28.900]
You way, yeah.

[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:33.120]
I've mentioned my name to Ricemaster Gehring.

[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:33.740]
Okay.

[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:36.160]
I'm a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit of a guy who's been a little bit

[02:21:36.160 --> 02:22:06.140]
I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a caravan's fakes I'll play a car

[02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:35.180]
I'll play a caravan's fakes

[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:38.320]
A group of businessmen linked by their close ties to President Bush's family and his

[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:41.520]
administrative setup are consulting firm to advise companies that want to do business

[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:46.480]
in Iraq, including those seeking pieces of taxpayer-financed reconstruction projects.

[02:22:47.340 --> 02:22:51.680]
Kind of like they're reaching into your pocket and extracting your cash.

[02:22:52.740 --> 02:22:55.820]
The firm, Newbridge Strategy, is headed by Joe M. Albaugh.

[02:22:56.060 --> 02:22:57.680]
We had an article about him a couple of days ago.

[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:02.040]
Mr. Bush's campaign manager in 2000 and the director of FEMA until March.

[02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:07.140]
Other directors include Edward M. Rogers, Jr. Vice Chairman, and Lanny Griffith-Lobius

[02:23:07.140 --> 02:23:11.000]
to her assistance to the first President George Bush and now have close ties to the White House.

[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:14.020]
I'm just going to read a little bit of a piece.

[02:23:14.460 --> 02:23:18.840]
I had a time on the Administration's seats congressional approval for $20.3 billion

[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:23.420]
to rebuild Iraq, part of an $87 billion package for military and other spending in Iraq

[02:23:23.420 --> 02:23:24.060]
and Afghanistan.

[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:28.340]
The company's website, www.nubridsstrategies.com, says,

[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:32.520]
the opportunities evolving in Iraq today are of such an unprecedented nature and scope

[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:36.720]
that no other existing firm has the necessary skills and experience to be affected

[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:39.000]
both in Washington, D.C. and on the ground in Iraq.

[02:23:41.060 --> 02:23:44.660]
The site calls attention to the links between the company's directors and the two Bush

[02:23:44.660 --> 02:23:49.180]
administrations by noting, for example, that Mr. Albaugh, the chairman, was chief of staff

[02:23:49.180 --> 02:23:54.960]
to then Governor Bush of Texas and was national campaign manager for the Bush-Chainy 2000 presidential campaign.

[02:23:56.520 --> 02:24:00.260]
The company's website says the company was created sp Uhh specifically with the aim

[02:24:00.260 --> 02:24:04.480]
of assisting clients to evaluate and take advantage of business opportunities in the

[02:24:04.480 --> 02:24:08.180]
Middle East following the conclusion of the U.S.-led war in Iraq.

[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:11.000]
Sagendale sends again.

[02:24:11.140 --> 02:24:11.700]
Yes, please.

[02:24:12.260 --> 02:24:14.900]
The company website says the company was created specifically

[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:19.680]
with the aim of assisting clients to evaluate and take advantage of business opportunities

[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:22.240]
in the Middle East following the conclusion of U.S.-led War in Iraq.

[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:25.400]
You can read the entire story. I left most of it on our website today on your

[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:31.340]
rg.com along with a lot of other disturbing stuff. Oh, poor Catherine Gagan,

[02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:36.240]
father Gagan Sista. She's not happy with the slaying investigation. She wants more

[02:24:36.240 --> 02:24:39.140]
information coming out about why they left poor father Gagan in their loan.

[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:42.280]
We've discovered been sexually molested as a child and they all kind of

[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:46.120]
looked the other way while he got the off. Yeah. Well, he got off a lot of

[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:49.980]
other times. He just paid a wicked price for it. Rubia Fort Likardale, Faxes and

[02:24:49.980 --> 02:24:53.760]
says, dear George, I can't call but please don't kneel at his boy. You'll

[02:24:53.760 --> 02:24:56.880]
win the quarterback Tom Brady's on the cover this month's men's health magazine.

[02:24:57.400 --> 02:25:02.440]
Thanks, Ruby. As a healthy man. Hmm. Hmm. Real, real healthy to me. So what I'm

[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:04.960]
going to do is we're like, make sure that I don't read it like in the in the

[02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:09.580]
bathroom like anywhere near the showers. Okay. I'm saying. I want to get that

[02:25:09.580 --> 02:25:14.880]
guy in Hollywood all upset. And let me ask you this. Is it great? Is it the gate?

[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:20.280]
Hello, this is on. This is not a tumor. It's the one to two hour.

[02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:20.000]
Yeah. Yeah. You are the material girl. Yeah. But I still felt like something was

[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:27.560]
on. And what was that something? Britney. Britney. I mean, it was just a friendly

[02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:33.140]
kiss. Cool. Yeah. Who is it? Incredible. Really? Yeah. And fun. And I don't know why

[02:27:33.140 --> 02:27:37.580]
people are making such a big deal about it. You really don't. I really don't. You

[02:27:37.580 --> 02:27:41.720]
really don't. Hasn't anyone ever seen two girls kiss before? Well, I don't know

[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:48.980]
most of America has. Go right ahead. Really? Yeah. I'm not kidding. Okay. Okay. Hmm.

[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:56.900]
Hmm. It's incredible. Yeah. It's a good thing. It's a very good thing. Yeah. Yeah.

[02:27:57.180 --> 02:28:03.060]
Good thing. Hey, do you want to run faster? Jump higher and make the blind see again. Why

[02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:08.020]
do you want to move like the wind? Sort like an eagle and raise people from the dead. Huh?

[02:28:08.020 --> 02:28:15.140]
Yeah. Because there is only one small thing in a small mold. It would loose air. Jesus. Jesus.

[02:28:17.960 --> 02:28:23.580]
What they'll do for your game is a miracle. I want to do anything.

[02:28:24.320 --> 02:28:24.900]
Don't touch.

[02:28:25.580 --> 02:28:26.860]
Come on.

[02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:38.780]
Oh, Jesus!

[02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:41.940]
Here Jesus lies in the soul.

[02:28:42.420 --> 02:28:45.160]
The patent of Cushion Chamber is filled with avion,

[02:28:45.460 --> 02:28:46.700]
carefully laid into the scene,

[02:28:46.900 --> 02:28:49.880]
so every part of your foot is always walking underwater.

[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:53.540]
Sorry, not responsible for any water chamber that turns to wine.

[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.940]
And then coming soon, look for the only air-jeetis' cross-trainer's air-jeetis.

[02:28:59.360 --> 02:29:03.020]
And I'll make you feel like you're going to get...

[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.880]
Fair back, your favorite Jewish rock and roll nostalgia band.

[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:10.900]
It's Russia Shunana with their greatest hits album,

[02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:12.360]
Suck Hop at the synagogue!

[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:16.620]
My rare birth back is when it's just as a baby!

[02:29:16.980 --> 02:29:20.240]
My baby, my rare birth back!

[02:29:20.460 --> 02:29:26.720]
Yes, Russia Shunana is reformed to renew 12 kosher-carts of hoppin' Hebrew high-gains.

[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:34.300]
That joy isn't good for Jews.

[02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:38.520]
This album should be in every or the Dutch rocker's collection.

[02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:41.640]
Rolling Stone gives it five stars of David!

[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:48.100]
It's a wonder wonder wonder who wrote the book of Job.

[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:50.380]
Suck Hop at the synagogue!

[02:29:50.840 --> 02:29:52.180]
You from Russia Shunana!

[02:29:52.480 --> 02:29:53.780]
Available at all record stores.

[02:29:54.060 --> 02:29:55.240]
We'll talk twice when you get here.

[02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:57.080]
So, man, it's over this album!

[02:29:58.120 --> 02:29:58.780]
They're Hebrew!

[02:30:05.420 --> 02:30:10.360]
Well, he's an action hero, but he wants to play a brand new roll now.

[02:30:12.220 --> 02:30:16.380]
Terminating great-divis has become his number one goal now.

[02:30:18.100 --> 02:30:22.420]
And he's leading candidate in court into the new fall sound.

[02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:23.280]
Oh, my God.

[02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:26.280]
Arnold, run, run, run, run!

[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:28.200]
Tell the voters to give us a win!

[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:30.760]
Run, run, run, to the voters to give us a win!

[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:34.000]
Well, it's married to a demographic where we are.

[02:30:34.100 --> 02:30:36.740]
She's got your feet now, she's got your feet!

[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:41.180]
And like his local life, when it's used to be a woman, I don't care.

[02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:41.620]
I don't care.

[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:42.720]
I don't care.

[02:30:43.120 --> 02:30:47.960]
But unlike that, Kennedy, he is an excellent driver of green now.

[02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:49.260]
Just like an entire age.

[02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:50.860]
He'll run, run, run!

[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:52.960]
Tell the voters to give us a win!

[02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:56.840]
Run, run, to the voters to give us a win!

[02:30:57.080 --> 02:30:59.180]
Run, run, run, to the voters to give us a win!

[02:30:59.540 --> 02:31:02.360]
Run, run, run, to the voters to give us a win!

[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:04.260]
Run, run, run, to the voters to give us a win!

[02:31:04.280 --> 02:31:07.620]
Bullshaw Dashbox says that's what he's got to do.

[02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:09.920]
I love the rule of law!

[02:31:11.100 --> 02:31:11.560]
All right!

[02:31:13.800 --> 02:31:17.540]
Happy notice, lately, the right wing GOP.

[02:31:18.340 --> 02:31:22.320]
Always say the rule of law, whenever they make their speech.

[02:31:22.620 --> 02:31:25.780]
Bullshaw Dashbox says that's what he's got to do.

[02:31:26.060 --> 02:31:28.200]
I love the rule of law!

[02:31:31.940 --> 02:31:33.680]
Section 1 says you're better.

[02:31:34.340 --> 02:31:36.020]
Obey what Ashcroft says.

[02:31:36.760 --> 02:31:38.260]
Section 2 says you're better.

[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:40.480]
You never, never, never, never, never.

[02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:42.940]
Have sex in section 4, you can go out.

[02:31:43.340 --> 02:31:44.540]
But it's a sin to dance.

[02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:49.500]
In section 3, you'll procreate, but you never remove your pants.

[02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:53.120]
Bullshaw Dashbox says that's what he's got to do.

[02:31:53.380 --> 02:31:55.480]
Follow the rule of law!

[02:31:59.060 --> 02:32:03.200]
What they're trying to say is they're better than you and me.

[02:32:03.820 --> 02:32:07.920]
They have the high rule of law, when it meets their needs.

[02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:11.320]
Bullshaw Dashbox says that's what he's got to do.

[02:32:11.320 --> 02:32:13.700]
Follow the rule of law!

[02:32:17.880 --> 02:32:20.500]
What will Johnny do?

[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:23.420]
Follow the rule of law!

[02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:25.500]
Rashi can you hear me?

[02:32:26.800 --> 02:32:29.720]
I have the fiddle for you.

[02:32:31.360 --> 02:32:33.480]
Patch a picture here, ring.

[02:32:35.280 --> 02:32:37.340]
I have you, sugar, or two.

[02:32:38.340 --> 02:32:46.340]
Oh, Rashi, Rashi, Rashi, Rashi.

[02:32:46.960 --> 02:32:48.280]
What will?

[02:32:51.300 --> 02:32:52.020]
What?

[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:53.580]
What?

[02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:56.680]
What, what a touch of wood.

[02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:57.780]
What?

[02:32:58.220 --> 02:32:58.340]
What?

[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:00.340]
What?

[02:33:01.600 --> 02:33:01.800]
What will?

[02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:06.460]
What that, that, that, that, that?

[02:33:06.460 --> 02:33:08.860]
One with one

[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:17.000]
Why will you do more with all your feelings?

[02:33:17.620 --> 02:33:21.600]
To bat for you, to hateful treats?

[02:33:22.640 --> 02:33:27.800]
What's the value of a dangerous doggy?

[02:33:28.380 --> 02:33:32.840]
I might jump through, but I'm not sorry

[02:33:32.840 --> 02:33:41.020]
What's the value of a dangerous doggy?

[02:34:00.700 --> 02:34:02.820]
What's the value of a dangerous doggy?

[02:34:02.820 --> 02:34:11.460]
The happiness, peace, a sense of well-being, a sense of self-worth, it comes from the inside out.

[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:13.900]
It doesn't come from the outside in it.

[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:20.120]
Dr. Phil drives me up a wall. There's no substance there at all.

[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:20.680]
I know.

[02:34:20.680 --> 02:34:26.080]
It takes this metaphor that don't mean the same things.

[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:30.040]
Dr. Phil's brain isn't when it walks.

[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:33.300]
He's a mister, no it all.

[02:34:33.880 --> 02:34:38.200]
Never want to see him wearing the jeep strings.

[02:34:39.100 --> 02:34:40.060]
That's crazy.

[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:42.100]
Dr. Phil's wife

[02:34:44.340 --> 02:34:46.440]
Do your eyes do that?

[02:34:46.760 --> 02:34:48.660]
Dr. Phil tries

[02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:53.100]
To lose some of your own things.

[02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:58.280]
What makes you think that you do have the right to judge him?

[02:34:58.420 --> 02:35:01.500]
Forget it if you barely put a use of my mind into it, you hear?

[02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.960]
If you'll give him folks a fight,

[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:08.200]
while he screams at for a housewife,

[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:13.260]
about eating more than every human sure.

[02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:18.100]
Dr. Phil, please just make it down.

[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:21.380]
You're a freaking circus clown.

[02:35:22.060 --> 02:35:25.780]
Try to handle things like your friend or bro.

[02:35:26.640 --> 02:35:28.060]
That's crazy.

[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:29.920]
Dr. Phil stops

[02:35:32.100 --> 02:35:36.260]
We try to go away. Dr. Phil stops.

[02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.420]
Just leave and take your son, Jay.

[02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:43.960]
Ever see Dr. Phil in Russia at the same time?

[02:35:44.340 --> 02:35:44.700]
No, never.

[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:45.340]
Sing a.

[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:49.960]
Don't forget we got the Big Marlins watch party this afternoon, 3.30.

[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:51.180]
And sure let's take two of them.

[02:35:51.220 --> 02:35:53.880]
I mean, like, did we figure out yet as a mad dog doing a show over there or not?

[02:35:54.260 --> 02:35:54.440]
Yes.

[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:55.860]
But I tell you.

[02:35:56.120 --> 02:35:56.560]
I knew it.

[02:35:56.740 --> 02:35:57.820]
I can count on a mad dog.

[02:35:57.820 --> 02:35:58.360]
All right.

[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:01.000]
Let me be doing a show 2 to 3.30 at the Schulis Day 2.

[02:36:01.340 --> 02:36:05.260]
And then starting at 3.30, it's the Big Marlins watch party pregame show starts at 3.30.

[02:36:05.580 --> 02:36:06.900]
Game at 406 out in Frisco.

[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:08.440]
Billy, the Marlin will be there.

[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:10.200]
The Marlin Mermaid will be there.

[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.000]
And interactive pitching and pitching games will be going on in the course of the mad dog too.

[02:36:14.700 --> 02:36:20.880]
That's how many are again with the macro showrooms and the furniture stores run a big, big, fancy, shmancy, phony ads.

[02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:23.340]
The automatrix wants you to stop and think about it.

[02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:27.000]
If you double the price and then offer the public half off, what kind of a sale is that?

[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:27.620]
It's a joke.

[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:28.440]
It's a scam.

[02:36:28.940 --> 02:36:37.080]
The fact is that all of these stores have to run a special sale to make their prices look nearly as low as automatrix is every day low, prices 365 days a year.

[02:36:37.480 --> 02:36:46.540]
For discount prices on dozens of top models from Celi, Surtos, Temporpidic, Simmons, Kingcourt or Sterns and Foster, you need to call...is that the bananas Foster?

[02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:47.120]
Yes.

[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:47.980]
Well, I love that.

[02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:51.180]
Call 1-800-MATRUS 1-800-MATRES.

[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:52.200]
No nonsense.

[02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:53.100]
No bait and switch.

[02:36:53.300 --> 02:36:53.880]
No house brands.

[02:36:54.080 --> 02:36:54.740]
No false promises.

[02:36:55.240 --> 02:36:58.860]
And best of all, you don't have to pay a premium for the best service going any place.

[02:36:59.280 --> 02:37:00.580]
You'll get service like you dream about.

[02:37:00.700 --> 02:37:03.060]
From the delivery team right to the best in the world and customer satisfaction.

[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:11.340]
When you call dial amateurs toll-free like I always do 1-800-MATRUS, you pick the day in time for delivery when it's convenient for your ass when your ass is going to be home.

[02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:18.840]
Within any tour of Windows 7 days a week from 8 in the morning till 10 a night and like to be clean and noon in 2, 1 in 3, 2, 15, and 4, 15, etc.

[02:37:19.300 --> 02:37:21.600]
And you'll be sleeping like a baby the very first night.

[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:23.800]
I've been sleeping on a mattress from these folks for years.

[02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:24.680]
George's as well.

[02:37:24.800 --> 02:37:26.200]
Miguel has screw in his brains out on it.

[02:37:26.500 --> 02:37:27.320]
He ought to be doing the same.

[02:37:27.620 --> 02:37:29.860]
With low prices, same day delivery, free setup and removal.

[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:34.300]
It's easy to see why dial amateurs is ranked the best in the universe and customer satisfaction.

[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:35.640]
Don't get sucked in.

[02:37:35.740 --> 02:37:38.280]
Don't be fooled by those mattress showrooms, phony sales and ads.

[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:41.420]
They aren't even close and not in the same leak with dial amateurs.

[02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:43.280]
Call them today and they'll be there in no time at all.

[02:37:43.340 --> 02:37:44.080]
Knock on on your door.

[02:37:44.480 --> 02:37:50.280]

Here's sports radio 560-C-A-U-A-M.

[02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:00.220]
Let's be ladies and gentlemen.

[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:03.400]
We return you now to SIR search.

[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:06.980]
And your host, our scenario haul.

[02:38:07.640 --> 02:38:08.640]
Let up.

[02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:10.040]
Hey, everybody.

[02:38:10.380 --> 02:38:13.580]
I'm off to New Hall and welcome back to SIR search.

[02:38:13.860 --> 02:38:15.440]
You already for our first contestant.

[02:38:15.800 --> 02:38:16.420]
All the way.

[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.640]
Come home, call.

[02:38:18.340 --> 02:38:19.620]
Give it up for comedian.

[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:22.100]
Him, young, bad.

[02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:25.000]
Okay, okay, how you do?

[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:26.400]
A first talk.

[02:38:26.980 --> 02:38:28.920]
Who's gentlemen walking through the bottom?

[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:30.300]
First one's sake.

[02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:40.880]
What's your hands together for him?

[02:38:41.060 --> 02:38:42.100]
Long bad, everybody.

[02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:44.300]
Oh, man, I'm in a dine all season.

[02:38:44.740 --> 02:38:45.920]
That was just pain old whack.

[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.140]
All right, let's hear from my judges.

[02:38:48.460 --> 02:38:49.300]
I'm at Zappa.

[02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:50.640]
What you think of him?

[02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:51.380]
Long bad.

[02:38:51.740 --> 02:38:52.380]
I loved him.

[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:53.400]
He was great.

[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:54.260]
Five stars.

[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:55.700]
Oh, me and everybody.

[02:38:55.960 --> 02:38:56.440]
Five stars.

[02:38:57.060 --> 02:38:59.340]
Next up, my whole boy, the one the only.

[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:00.280]
Been.

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:00.280]

[02:39:00.740 --> 02:39:01.180]
Stan.

[02:39:01.900 --> 02:39:05.280]
His brand of comedy is infectious.

[02:39:06.100 --> 02:39:06.980]
Three stars.

[02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:08.380]
All right, it is.

[02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:11.100]
And finally, our last SIR search judge.

[02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:14.080]
The lovely and talented Naomi Judd.

[02:39:14.420 --> 02:39:15.120]
What do you think of him?

[02:39:15.240 --> 02:39:15.760]
Long bad, Naomi.

[02:39:16.100 --> 02:39:16.540]
Naomi.

[02:39:17.200 --> 02:39:17.880]
What up, girl?

[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:18.980]
Oh, no.

[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:20.540]
Oh, she ain't breathing.

[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:21.860]
I better give him out the mouth.

[02:39:22.500 --> 02:39:23.680]
Come on, baby, breathe.

[02:39:24.900 --> 02:39:25.220]
Oh, oh.

[02:39:27.220 --> 02:39:28.660]
Maybe that wasn't such a good idea.

[02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:31.440]
Oh, damn.

[02:39:32.020 --> 02:39:32.940]
What I'm going to do that?

[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:35.440]
We got to take a quick break.

[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.400]
I'm going to be right back.

[02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:39.200]
Good morning.

[02:39:39.740 --> 02:39:40.840]
SIR search.

[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:43.540]
Maybe not.

Go high and golden to grab out your hair.

[02:39:59.320 --> 02:40:01.140]
We are dead.

[02:40:02.820 --> 02:40:05.880]
Not canary but no.

[02:40:06.300 --> 02:40:09.100]
Satan's babies sing Simon and Garbago.

[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:10.680]
Oh, yeah.

[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:13.480]
She's dying her plane.

[02:40:14.060 --> 02:40:16.860]
She crashed into the ocean.

[02:40:18.420 --> 02:40:21.160]
It's Satan's babies sing Simon and Garbago.

[02:40:21.160 --> 02:40:23.240]
R güiled and stole in stores now from Rinto.

[02:40:23.780 --> 02:40:26.080]

Satan's babies sing Billy Joel.

[02:40:29.020 --> 02:40:30.740]
Your hair is aging.

[02:40:31.960 --> 02:40:35.620]
I don't want you here for me, here.

[02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:38.260]
What's the oil with the chains up?

[02:40:38.480 --> 02:40:39.120]
Where would I doe

[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:41.200]
Take them off and make you bleed

[02:40:42.080 --> 02:40:44.820]
St. St. St. St. Bill and Joel

[02:40:45.340 --> 02:40:47.580]
My sister's house on fire

[02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:49.140]
Yeah!

[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:52.380]
St. St. St. Bill and Joel

[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:55.020]
Let's doors now from Britain go!

[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:05.420]
I went to the solid city party

[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:08.840]
I was invited by the priest

[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:11.100]
He said, turn with me

[02:41:11.100 --> 02:41:13.660]
I have some friends to see back in the

[02:41:13.660 --> 02:41:15.280]
For red theory

[02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:16.060]
Bratdom!

[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:19.180]
When we got to the solid city party

[02:41:19.180 --> 02:41:22.220]
There were some other priests in the book

[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:25.420]
Then he dropped his plans and said,

[02:41:25.680 --> 02:41:29.200]
Be a good lad, your face I want to stuff

[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:32.620]
And I realized that

[02:41:33.620 --> 02:41:36.100]
I didn't do very well

[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:40.380]
You see, the priest couldn't get all

[02:41:40.380 --> 02:41:43.820]
So he had the peace himself

[02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:00.560]
Then the priest at the solid city party

[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:03.420]
Said, I paid some, tried again

[02:42:04.560 --> 02:42:06.220]
As he took my hand

[02:42:06.220 --> 02:42:08.420]
Then he said that me felt you

[02:42:08.420 --> 02:42:10.240]
Try to understand

[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:14.240]
He said there's something I must remind you

[02:42:14.240 --> 02:42:17.480]
Before you give it another chance

[02:42:18.560 --> 02:42:21.020]
The holy men who wrote the Bible

[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.220]
Were wearing any pants

[02:42:24.220 --> 02:42:27.560]
Now I'm alright now

[02:42:28.240 --> 02:42:31.220]
I can do that very well

[02:42:31.220 --> 02:42:35.260]
It's good that I can please say it was

[02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:37.980]
And I won't go to hell

[02:42:41.700 --> 02:42:43.460]
With more Zach got the job

[02:42:43.460 --> 02:42:45.620]

[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:51.960]
Hi! My name is Dustin Diamond

[02:42:51.960 --> 02:42:53.760]
Where you can call me Screech

[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:55.740]
That was my name on Save By The Bell

[02:42:55.740 --> 02:42:56.920]
I'm your new partner

[02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:58.160]
I don't like the sound of that

[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:00.860]
Don't worry about it, by the 11th season

[02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:03.340]
I was Mr. Bell's assistant principal

[02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:05.080]
I'll make a great job

[02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:06.700]
I don't think so, Asfees

[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:09.340]
Hey! Zach used to call me Screechiru

[02:43:09.340 --> 02:43:11.580]
And AJ called me the Screechinator

[02:43:11.580 --> 02:43:13.740]
But I don't think I like Asfees

[02:43:14.500 --> 02:43:15.440]
Open your mouth again

[02:43:15.440 --> 02:43:16.880]
And you're gonna get bitch slapped

[02:43:16.880 --> 02:43:19.920]
Mr. Bell used to protect me from bitch slappers

[02:43:19.920 --> 02:43:22.340]
What do you do if I call him down here

[02:43:22.340 --> 02:43:23.360]
So I'm gonna kick his ass

[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:25.360]
Huh? What if I call AJ?

[02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:26.580]
I'm gonna kick his ass

[02:43:26.580 --> 02:43:28.020]
Yeah, we just be buds

[02:43:28.020 --> 02:43:29.180]
And your dreams pal

[02:43:29.180 --> 02:43:30.800]
You sound very disturbed

[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:32.800]
Right back at you, douche bag

[02:43:32.800 --> 02:43:34.820]
Hey! I'm not a disturbed person

[02:43:34.820 --> 02:43:36.560]
I just played one on TV

[02:43:36.560 --> 02:43:38.540]

Ooh, no, no, no, Sajin

[02:44:06.720 --> 02:44:08.360]
I've been saying

[02:44:08.980 --> 02:44:13.060]
Sajin for the nukes they hid away

[02:44:13.060 --> 02:44:14.640]
Hey, hey, hey

[02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:18.640]
But I don't think we'll ever find them

[02:44:19.320 --> 02:44:19.900]
No

[02:44:19.900 --> 02:44:24.260]
They were in there in the first place

[02:44:25.560 --> 02:44:27.000]
Don't define

[02:44:28.560 --> 02:44:31.120]
Yeah, how you know

[02:44:31.120 --> 02:44:33.060]
From house to house

Oh, man, brother

[02:44:56.560 --> 02:44:59.220]
But we'll be folks of Sajin

[02:44:59.220 --> 02:45:02.540]
Ooh, no, no, Sajin

[02:45:03.180 --> 02:45:03.840]
Keep looking

[02:45:03.840 --> 02:45:07.980]
Or move up on the new table

[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:10.040]
Hey, hey, hey

[02:45:10.040 --> 02:45:11.520]

[02:45:15.320 --> 02:45:15.800]

They never have been made

[02:45:18.620 --> 02:45:26.200]
They never find them

[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:36.740]
Oh, right, where were they?

[02:45:38.020 --> 02:45:39.960]
Locke chains that wound

[02:45:39.960 --> 02:45:41.400]
Stray on

[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:43.040]
Hair is blind

[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:47.200]
Shake my pen, I turned guys on

[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:50.200]
But there's a place

[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:54.200]
Where all the guards could hide it

[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:57.580]
I can make guys grow

[02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:00.280]
Right behind their seats

[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:04.480]
I can make guys grow

[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:06.640]
With my body and booty

[02:46:07.240 --> 02:46:10.340]
That's where fair blood flows

[02:46:10.340 --> 02:46:12.580]
Cause of such a beauty

[02:46:12.580 --> 02:46:15.700]
It's one of those things I've worked for

[02:46:15.700 --> 02:46:17.960]
Being such a bad girl

[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:21.860]
I can make guys grow

[02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:24.480]
With my body and booty

[02:46:25.240 --> 02:46:27.900]
That's where fair blood flows

[02:46:27.900 --> 02:46:30.040]
Cause of such a beauty

[02:46:30.040 --> 02:46:32.840]
It's one of those things I've worked for

[02:46:32.840 --> 02:46:35.620]
Being such a bad girl

[02:46:35.620 --> 02:46:37.280]
I can make guys grow

[02:46:41.280 --> 02:46:43.560]
One 24 or 5 60 W Commodore

We forgot all of us today

[02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:46.620]
What's that?

[02:46:47.240 --> 02:46:49.300]
What day is this? It's Wednesday, October 1th, right?

[02:46:49.880 --> 02:46:51.320]
Yeah. Smallville.

[02:46:51.320 --> 02:46:53.200]

And the season premiere of Angel with Spike

[02:46:59.040 --> 02:47:00.480]
Oh, what time is that on?

Before or after a small bill

[02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:04.620]
And what about Dawson's Crick?

[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:06.540]
Who cares? Let me say it again

[02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:08.600]
Cause I don't, what's his name? James VanderGeek

[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:10.160]
That Dutch kid, if you say that

[02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:11.260]
Cause I don't like that show

[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:12.800]
But boy, that movie rules of attraction

[02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:14.800]

Isn't that what Eli Waller said? Something like that.

[02:47:45.940 --> 02:47:47.040]
Before he ate the cannoli

[02:47:47.040 --> 02:47:49.040]

Everybody in the world is laughing at him

And like Sam Donaldson, like Dennis Cassinich

[02:48:05.920 --> 02:48:06.960]
Who says a lot of good things

[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:08.980]
But he's got that awful dead thing on his head

[02:48:08.980 --> 02:48:09.720]
Just like Mo

[02:48:09.720 --> 02:48:12.360]
Well Charles Alfieri can't help you look better and younger

[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:15.480]

This is 420516

[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:22.880]
UA-M

[02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:30.700]
You'll remember this golden gasser

[02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:36.800]
One through four WQAM

[02:49:36.910 --> 02:49:38.410]
WQAM

[02:49:45.290 --> 02:49:46.130]
Alright

[02:49:46.910 --> 02:49:50.070]
Bill's the cause and Monica's vagina

[02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:54.710]
She lets out a giggle

[02:49:54.710 --> 02:49:57.950]
When he makes it we go

[02:49:58.910 --> 02:50:03.990]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind

[02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.410]
Back on

[02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:39.730]
Now, please, and he was working hard

[02:50:39.730 --> 02:50:43.150]
Late nights in the overrear this

[02:50:43.990 --> 02:50:47.130]
Working on a practical joke

[02:50:48.470 --> 02:50:51.570]
He took a mac and noodle

[02:50:51.570 --> 02:50:53.490]
Put an exploding

[02:50:53.490 --> 02:50:59.650]
Loading for Monica was blowing rings a smoke

[02:51:02.170 --> 02:51:06.090]
Bill's the cause and Monica's vagina

[02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:10.750]
She lets out a giggle

[02:51:11.650 --> 02:51:14.110]
Every time he makes it we go

[02:51:14.110 --> 02:51:19.830]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind

[02:51:19.830 --> 02:51:20.450]
Back on

[02:51:20.450 --> 02:51:24.910]
But a cigar and her vagina she don't mind

[02:51:24.910 --> 02:51:25.750]
Alright

[02:51:26.910 --> 02:51:30.850]
All people feel that Hillary's been

[02:51:30.850 --> 02:51:33.810]
Made a fool of by her husband

[02:51:34.910 --> 02:51:38.910]
Feel that Hillary was wronged

[02:51:40.230 --> 02:51:42.490]
Up in the Lincoln bedroom

[02:51:42.490 --> 02:51:44.670]
She was moaning

[02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:50.330]
Moaning how God was doing her with Bill's old bum

[02:51:52.990 --> 02:51:56.810]
Bill's the cause and Monica's vagina

[02:51:58.990 --> 02:52:01.690]
She lets out a giggle

[02:52:01.690 --> 02:52:05.610]
Every friggin time he makes it we go

[02:52:05.610 --> 02:52:10.330]
Monica is not the kind you can do in the behind

[02:52:11.050 --> 02:52:15.890]
But a cigar and her vagina she don't mind

[02:52:15.890 --> 02:52:18.830]
Oh candy is a candy

[02:52:19.890 --> 02:52:23.110]
Yeah, just master is faster

[02:52:23.890 --> 02:52:30.830]
Oh yeah, what you gotta do is take a tip of real love

[02:52:30.830 --> 02:52:32.910]
And put it in a breath

[02:52:32.910 --> 02:52:35.050]
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

[02:52:35.890 --> 02:52:38.610]
Oh now how you gonna run

[02:52:38.610 --> 02:52:40.830]
Oh yeah

[02:52:46.170 --> 02:52:48.770]
I did by the ride

[02:52:49.890 --> 02:52:51.570]
That moves like douchebag

[02:52:51.570 --> 02:52:53.170]
60 more rides

[02:52:53.170 --> 02:52:55.630]
I did by the ride

[02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:58.350]
I felt like a douchebag

[02:52:58.350 --> 02:52:59.890]
Cause I didn't even recognize

[02:52:59.890 --> 02:53:01.870]
I know you may not understand

[02:53:01.870 --> 02:53:03.890]
What I did or who I am

[02:53:03.890 --> 02:53:06.070]
Most of you don't read any books

[02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.590]
No

[02:53:06.590 --> 02:53:10.150]
So let me introduce myself I was a well-respected heart

[02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:12.290]
Right man and trusted by high level

[02:53:13.490 --> 02:53:17.150]
I used to have a powerful, Republican position

[02:53:17.150 --> 02:53:20.010]
High up on a poor road ground

[02:53:20.010 --> 02:53:23.110]
The Holy Christian's wearing systems that I have

[02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:26.750]
This red and Clint's is which any means that could be found

[02:53:34.290 --> 02:53:36.750]
She said I had a nervous breakdown

[02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:40.190]
All time was blinded by the ride

[02:53:40.190 --> 02:53:42.990]
And moves like douchebag

[02:53:42.990 --> 02:53:44.530]
The moral face he cried

[02:53:44.530 --> 02:53:46.950]
And blinded by the ride

[02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:49.790]
I felt like a douchebag

[02:53:49.790 --> 02:53:51.230]
Cause I didn't even recognize

[02:53:51.230 --> 02:53:53.210]
I had a mission to the hardest

[02:53:53.210 --> 02:53:55.010]
For my moralistic Christians

[02:53:55.010 --> 02:53:56.110]
And crawling there

[02:53:56.110 --> 02:53:57.410]
taking on the road

[02:53:58.190 --> 02:53:59.970]
Why dad knew that you'd fund a sister

[02:53:59.970 --> 02:54:01.850]
And go to their raising sisters

[02:54:01.850 --> 02:54:04.430]
Give them power balls of trust

[02:54:04.430 --> 02:54:06.730]
My job was to alter views

[02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:08.030]
To the right wing

[02:54:08.030 --> 02:54:11.210]
For the views people might be too sweet

[02:54:12.030 --> 02:54:13.750]
And of the hatred that I spewed

[02:54:13.750 --> 02:54:15.770]
About minorities and beggar jewels

[02:54:15.770 --> 02:54:17.950]
Make me one of you today

[02:54:25.230 --> 02:54:28.170]
I knew it in the day I was gay

[02:54:28.170 --> 02:54:31.630]
Cause I was blinded by the ride

[02:54:31.630 --> 02:54:34.450]
And moves like douchebag

[02:54:34.450 --> 02:54:35.530]
The face he cried

[02:54:35.530 --> 02:54:38.350]
And blinded by the ride

[02:54:41.190 --> 02:54:43.370]
There was info

[02:54:43.370 --> 02:54:45.730]
For she was naked on a pause

[02:54:45.730 --> 02:54:47.530]
What you guys think of her

[02:54:48.090 --> 02:54:48.590]
Welcome

[02:54:48.590 --> 02:54:50.970]
The obvious time

[02:54:51.530 --> 02:54:52.730]
All right

[02:54:54.310 --> 02:54:56.110]
Baby let's do it

[02:54:56.110 --> 02:54:57.570]
Like pretty Martin's career

[02:54:57.570 --> 02:54:59.830]
We'll do it once real fast

[02:54:59.830 --> 02:55:01.930]
And then while this will be here

[02:55:04.030 --> 02:55:05.750]
You and me can do it

[02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:07.490]
Just like Jeffrey Dahmer

[02:55:07.490 --> 02:55:09.270]
And now that you're dead

[02:55:09.270 --> 02:55:11.570]
The sex will be so much Dahmer

[02:55:13.650 --> 02:55:15.350]
You and me baby

[02:55:15.350 --> 02:55:17.090]
Ain't nothing but monkeys

[02:55:17.090 --> 02:55:18.550]
I'd get my butt

[02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:20.310]
Plus then that and you just

[02:55:20.310 --> 02:55:21.330]
The bees see

[02:55:23.490 --> 02:55:24.050]
You

[02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:28.630]
You

[02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:29.010]
You

[02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:31.010]
You

[02:55:31.950 --> 02:55:32.510]
I'm so

[02:55:32.510 --> 02:55:35.010]
horny for you

[02:55:35.790 --> 02:55:36.410]
You

[02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:38.030]
Will you stop

[02:55:39.010 --> 02:55:41.010]
Precise and me

[02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:42.990]
You want me

[02:55:42.990 --> 02:55:43.990]
Don't you

[02:55:45.650 --> 02:55:46.970]
You

[02:55:48.550 --> 02:55:49.010]
You

[02:55:49.870 --> 02:55:50.030]
You

[02:55:50.030 --> 02:55:50.330]
You

[02:55:53.010 --> 02:55:53.610]
I'm so

[02:55:55.010 --> 02:55:57.010]
horny for you

[02:55:57.010 --> 02:55:59.390]
Won't you please

[02:55:59.390 --> 02:56:00.510]
Hell

[02:56:00.510 --> 02:56:03.170]
Get me off

[02:56:03.170 --> 02:56:04.030]
Look

[02:56:05.010 --> 02:56:05.970]
But don't touch

[02:56:05.970 --> 02:56:07.310]
I want you

[02:56:07.310 --> 02:56:12.210]
Strip down to your bare skin

[02:56:13.010 --> 02:56:15.250]
Coat yourself with

[02:56:15.250 --> 02:56:16.630]
Lard

[02:56:16.630 --> 02:56:18.150]
Baby I want you

[02:56:19.010 --> 02:56:23.210]
My penis was standing straight up

[02:56:23.210 --> 02:56:23.610]
I'm so

[02:56:23.610 --> 02:56:24.750]
horny for you

[02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:24.750]

[02:56:24.750 --> 02:56:27.810]
So hard I now

[02:56:27.810 --> 02:56:29.050]
Got blue

[02:56:33.210 --> 02:56:33.950]
Boat

[02:56:35.210 --> 02:56:37.370]
I just want to

[02:56:37.370 --> 02:56:38.570]
Do you

[02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:39.550]
You want me

[02:56:39.550 --> 02:56:40.850]
Don't

[02:56:40.850 --> 02:56:45.190]
Get me off

[02:56:45.190 --> 02:56:46.050]
Look

[02:56:47.210 --> 02:56:48.010]
Don't touch

[02:56:49.210 --> 02:56:50.750]
Boat

[02:56:51.730 --> 02:56:52.370]
Over

[02:56:56.130 --> 02:56:56.770]
You

[02:56:57.530 --> 02:56:58.170]
You

[02:57:06.650 --> 02:57:08.790]
There's a marvelous place I know

[02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:10.450]
We're all the wealthy people

[02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:13.230]
It's where royalty play follow

[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:15.090]
And that's what I like about Boka

[02:57:15.090 --> 02:57:16.930]
A down where he goes on

[02:57:16.930 --> 02:57:19.190]
Have a small, a down where they say

[02:57:19.190 --> 02:57:20.790]
And how tall in every corner

[02:57:20.790 --> 02:57:21.730]
As a wall

[02:57:21.730 --> 02:57:23.610]
And that's what I like about Boka

[02:57:23.610 --> 02:57:24.070]
Oh

[02:57:25.870 --> 02:57:26.470]
Oh

[02:57:26.470 --> 02:57:26.990]
Oh

[02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:28.010]
Oh

[02:57:30.730 --> 02:57:31.330]
Oh

[02:57:31.330 --> 02:57:31.810]
Oh

[02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:38.230]
Spin 10 grand on

[02:57:38.230 --> 02:57:41.050]
Of course we see it spend the day in Jewish factories

[02:57:41.050 --> 02:57:43.230]
You should taste these delicacies

[02:57:43.230 --> 02:57:44.970]
That's what I like about Boka

[02:57:44.970 --> 02:57:46.290]
A pleasing excuse

[02:57:46.290 --> 02:57:47.170]
Our attitudes

[02:57:47.170 --> 02:57:49.710]
And our BNWs

[02:57:49.710 --> 02:57:51.850]
And for we find pleasure in being rude

[02:57:51.850 --> 02:57:53.590]
That's what I like about Boka

[02:58:06.430 --> 02:58:08.970]
Who cheesed belts at Rolex watches?

[02:58:09.330 --> 02:58:11.170]
White shoes make us so affinacious

[02:58:11.170 --> 02:58:12.030]
If you're clean

[02:58:12.030 --> 02:58:13.190]
Let you touch us

[02:58:13.190 --> 02:58:14.790]
And that's what I like about Boka

[02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:17.330]
We really don't care what you think

[02:58:17.330 --> 02:58:19.390]
You see how a dude who doesn't stink

[02:58:19.390 --> 02:58:20.610]
There's no coffee

[02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.670]
Only Mocha

[02:58:21.670 --> 02:58:23.310]
And that's what I like about Boka

[02:58:23.310 --> 02:58:24.490]
White shoes

[02:58:35.150 --> 02:58:36.470]
That's the key

[02:58:36.470 --> 02:58:38.610]
That's what I like about Boka

[02:58:38.610 --> 02:58:40.090]
Call number two

[02:58:40.090 --> 02:58:40.410]
And number two

[02:58:40.410 --> 02:58:41.190]
And number two

[02:58:41.190 --> 02:58:43.450]
We got the Mad Dog coming over

[02:58:43.450 --> 02:58:44.330]
From Shola State

[02:58:44.330 --> 02:58:47.550]
And Frisco

[02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.790]
And Frisco

And Frisco

It's an exclusive pan to method and believe you me,

it works, which is why I've used it in my house

[02:59:18.910 --> 02:59:20.490]
for over 20 years, you ought to be doing the same.

[02:59:20.770 --> 02:59:22.390]

scam artists, they give you a written guaranteed price upfront

[02:59:49.650 --> 02:59:52.150]
before they even start doing a job on your carpeting,

[02:59:52.210 --> 02:59:53.830]
your draper, your poultry, your furniture,

[02:59:53.850 --> 02:59:54.690]

DRIVE, IN LOGALS, THIS IS 420-560-188.

[03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:21.630]
Be sure to lift it up my skirt.

[03:00:21.910 --> 03:00:25.790]
He said, I live, I live, I live, I live, I live, I live,

[03:00:25.790 --> 03:00:27.070]
I live in cold, I live in cold.

[03:00:36.750 --> 03:00:40.490]
I'm singing this song and I'm feeling kind of sad.

[03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:44.430]
I got my smile from mom, but my chicken from my fat.

[03:00:45.170 --> 03:00:48.630]
I've got a body like a driving range man.

[03:00:49.150 --> 03:00:52.470]
When it's cold outside, use my knits to hang your hat.

[03:00:54.270 --> 03:00:58.530]
I can blow in your ear, give you a lap dance.

[03:00:59.230 --> 03:01:02.330]
But you won't notice me till I get some implants.

[03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:08.330]
I need a guy who ain't got issues like feeling up a chest

[03:01:08.330 --> 03:01:10.650]
and finding tissues.

[03:01:12.890 --> 03:01:16.490]
Guys, I am cute, this am pretty.

[03:01:17.410 --> 03:01:20.690]
I'm not wrong, you need your pity.

[03:01:20.690 --> 03:01:24.850]
I've got a nice ass and fur like a kiss deep,

[03:01:25.050 --> 03:01:29.390]
but I can't get a man, cause I got no titties.

[03:01:29.450 --> 03:01:31.170]
I got no titties.

[03:01:31.190 --> 03:01:34.590]
Your wonder, bra, is something I can't afford.

[03:01:35.150 --> 03:01:38.790]
When you lay on me, you'll swear you're on a diving board.

[03:01:39.230 --> 03:01:42.610]
When I turn 11, I started to get fused.

[03:01:43.290 --> 03:01:46.710]
Now I'm 24, and so waiting on my boobs.

[03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:52.370]
Guys, I am cute, this am pretty.

[03:01:53.430 --> 03:01:56.690]
I'm not wrong, you need your pity.

[03:01:57.230 --> 03:02:00.850]
I've got a nice ass and fur like a kiss deep,

[03:02:01.210 --> 03:02:04.710]
but I can't get a man, cause I got no titties.

[03:02:05.470 --> 03:02:07.150]
I've got no titties.

[03:02:07.210 --> 03:02:09.450]
I've got no titties.

[03:02:11.170 --> 03:02:13.430]
I've got no titties.

[03:02:15.410 --> 03:02:18.850]
I've got no titties.

[03:02:19.570 --> 03:02:21.310]
It's my little brown cool.

[03:02:22.110 --> 03:02:23.970]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:02:24.750 --> 03:02:26.470]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:02:26.830 --> 03:02:29.910]
It's easy to brag about, so don't put me down.

[03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:33.430]
I must tell you what my car is, that's the talc ground.

[03:02:33.650 --> 03:02:36.770]
It has a hole in the trunk and a fence is a door.

[03:02:37.550 --> 03:02:40.410]
And you can see the road through the hole in the floor.

[03:02:40.850 --> 03:02:42.270]
It's my little brown cool.

[03:02:42.950 --> 03:02:44.830]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:02:45.610 --> 03:02:47.470]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:50.850]
It's just 82 kilometers, one heading late.

[03:02:51.450 --> 03:02:54.430]
So when it gets dark, I can use my flight.

[03:02:55.030 --> 03:02:58.010]
When something breaks down, no, it's not hard to fix.

[03:02:58.350 --> 03:03:01.310]
Cause duct tape and bailing wire, that's the trick.

[03:03:01.830 --> 03:03:03.290]
It's my little brown cool.

[03:03:04.190 --> 03:03:05.850]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:03:06.590 --> 03:03:08.390]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:03:08.390 --> 03:03:15.470]
I never knew how to drive a car before, but they handed me the keys when I got too short.

[03:03:16.190 --> 03:03:18.830]
I didn't let any of them to make you really flip.

[03:03:19.410 --> 03:03:22.890]
There's one more thing I got no place on it.

[03:03:23.150 --> 03:03:25.930]
It feels up with water on rainy days.

[03:03:26.670 --> 03:03:29.490]
But the tape and the windows seems to work okay.

[03:03:30.170 --> 03:03:33.110]
The front wheels start to shake when I try to steer.

[03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:36.390]
And I can't get it out of second gear.

[03:03:38.970 --> 03:03:41.030]
I'm so proud when I got.

[03:03:41.690 --> 03:03:43.590]
So I'm proud when I got.

[03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:45.470]
It's just my little brown cool.

[03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:56.070]
It's a little old lady from Alexandria.

[03:03:59.090 --> 03:04:01.850]
It's a little old lady from Alexandria.

[03:04:02.810 --> 03:04:05.030]
I'm ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:08.650]
With a baseball cap and a silk hardy knife

[03:04:08.650 --> 03:04:11.090]
I'm ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:04:11.090 --> 03:04:13.710]
Hitting in a rickety, one down,

[03:04:13.930 --> 03:04:17.070]
Shatches out of mid-conditioned 60th gas lag

[03:04:19.850 --> 03:04:23.270]
Now I can't think of no one who could make me meaner

[03:04:23.270 --> 03:04:26.210]
Than a little old lady from higher lia

[03:04:26.210 --> 03:04:28.950]
She crawled and she stole, she's a real fart

[03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:32.130]
She's a terror of howl and they'll be full of arms

[03:04:32.130 --> 03:04:35.530]
She's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:04:37.890 --> 03:04:41.570]
She's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:44.070]
Ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:04:44.070 --> 03:04:47.490]
You'll cut your oven after like you've never seen ya

[03:04:47.490 --> 03:04:50.290]
Ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:04:50.290 --> 03:04:53.170]
Don't try and blow your own due agitator

[03:04:53.170 --> 03:04:56.270]
Cause she'll only keep sucking on a respirator

[03:04:58.950 --> 03:05:02.310]
Now I can't think of no one who would make me meaner

[03:05:02.310 --> 03:05:05.250]
Than a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:05.250 --> 03:05:07.950]
She crawled and she stole, she's a real fart

[03:05:07.950 --> 03:05:11.050]
She's a terror of howl and they'll be full of arms

[03:05:11.050 --> 03:05:14.690]
She's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:16.950 --> 03:05:20.670]
She's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:20.670 --> 03:05:23.130]
Ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:05:23.130 --> 03:05:26.710]
It's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:29.170]
Ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:05:29.170 --> 03:05:32.490]
It's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:32.490 --> 03:05:35.310]
Ready for the 20 slow, ready for the 20 slow

[03:05:35.310 --> 03:05:38.590]
It's a little old lady from higher lia

[03:05:43.630 --> 03:05:49.030]
We on south, and hacking sectors are telling us

[03:05:49.030 --> 03:05:51.430]
Old tamer act with your living

[03:05:51.430 --> 03:05:56.030]
On a cold attack and prevention out the going next door

[03:05:56.030 --> 03:06:00.030]
They all drive for half a mile a day

[03:06:00.030 --> 03:06:03.530]
Where that Gucci smile and they stare

[03:06:03.530 --> 03:06:07.710]
In line a while, waving on their favorite

[03:06:07.710 --> 03:06:11.670]
Lea's Manhattan, the function police

[03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:14.590]
Got an island too, leave the parents here

[03:06:14.590 --> 03:06:17.710]
Take the car and all, and hook look back

[03:06:17.710 --> 03:06:20.210]
Down the jerseys, it turns like a tamer

[03:06:20.210 --> 03:06:23.610]
Rex stole the malls, and the sidewalks sell

[03:06:23.610 --> 03:06:26.590]
Herb your hair, as you wrap your nails

[03:06:26.590 --> 03:06:29.030]
Herb your friends, they're going to blooming

[03:06:29.610 --> 03:06:31.930]
They'll let it all fit far behind

[03:06:56.170 --> 03:06:59.590]
Lea's Manhattan, the function police

Take the car and all, and hook look back

[03:07:05.690 --> 03:07:08.050]
Down the jerseys, it turns like a tamer

[03:07:08.050 --> 03:07:11.490]
Rex stole the malls, and the sidewalks sell

[03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:14.510]
Herb your hair, as you wrap your nails

[03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:16.870]
Herb your friends, they're going to blooming

[03:07:16.870 --> 03:07:19.610]
They'll let it all fit far behind

[03:07:20.610 --> 03:07:23.350]
We're down south, it's past hack and sack

[03:07:23.350 --> 03:07:27.190]
There's a town, we call tamer, we live

[03:07:27.190 --> 03:07:31.910]
On a cold and sack, and come that's about to go in next door

[03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:35.310]
We're down south, it's past hack and sack

[03:07:35.310 --> 03:07:39.230]
There's a town, we call tamer, we down south

[03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:42.270]
It's past hack and sack, there's a town

We call tamer, we down south

[03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:50.050]
It's past hack and sack, there's a town, we call tamer

[03:07:51.810 --> 03:07:55.590]
There too, Miami cops, with a hot new beans

[03:07:56.230 --> 03:07:58.350]
There on the streets fighting crime

[03:07:58.350 --> 03:08:00.970]
They pops, that's a handicap base there

[03:08:00.970 --> 03:08:02.370]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[03:08:02.370 --> 03:08:05.650]
In Helen Vale's vise

[03:08:05.650 --> 03:08:08.750]
We got a problem, the grey gang is up to the road of tricks

[03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:11.170]
Lieutenant, in that the group has seen your citizens

[03:08:11.170 --> 03:08:13.990]
who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven

[03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:15.370]
Yeah, they're backing down

[03:08:15.370 --> 03:08:16.990]
Let's go get them

[03:08:17.870 --> 03:08:21.010]
Yeah, they'll stop it, nothing, clean up the streets

[03:08:21.010 --> 03:08:24.330]
Hey lady, you can't cross here, you'll have to cross in the light

[03:08:24.330 --> 03:08:27.770]
Yeah, they're determined to clean up the smuggling business

[03:08:27.770 --> 03:08:29.990]
Alright, sister, you're under arrest

[03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:33.130]
Also, now you're arresting my wife, watch the charge

[03:08:33.130 --> 03:08:36.770]
Session of power, open that purse, let's hit that white stuff

[03:08:37.410 --> 03:08:40.810]
Yeah, just a thought, you got over 100 bags in here

[03:08:40.810 --> 03:08:44.970]
Over 100! Sweet love, Matt restaurant, he just came out of

[03:08:44.970 --> 03:08:46.010]
Let's take a minute

[03:08:47.950 --> 03:08:51.850]
Yeah, they're coming in Miami cops on a hot new week

[03:08:51.850 --> 03:08:57.210]
In Helen Vale vise, removing this bomb on MBC

[03:08:57.890 --> 03:09:01.570]
151 at 560 WQA, we got 559 votes on there

[03:09:01.570 --> 03:09:03.930]
And I guess Mo was kind of a slow study, you know what I mean

[03:09:04.570 --> 03:09:06.770]
You've heard of a quick study, he just kind of a slow study

[03:09:06.770 --> 03:09:10.350]
Well, it's just taken a year and a half and I don't think the public's ready yet for his apologies

[03:09:10.350 --> 03:09:11.390]
Are they? No

[03:09:12.470 --> 03:09:14.530]
Maybe another half a year, maybe who knows

[03:09:14.530 --> 03:09:17.450]
Maybe about time it gets to be about 65 next year

[03:09:17.450 --> 03:09:22.690]
Hey listen, it's a big one, it's the 2003 Near Rogers Blowout sale going on right now

[03:09:22.690 --> 03:09:25.350]
And you know exactly where it's taking place, Helen Pontiac GMC

[03:09:26.130 --> 03:09:29.890]
