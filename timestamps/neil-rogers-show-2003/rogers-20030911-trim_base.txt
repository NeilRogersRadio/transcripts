[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980]
June, who's your mouse?

[00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.820]
I'm the same thing everybody.

[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.360]
I think he's annoying about 10-30.

[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.280]
I know the letter that he gave me.

[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.980]
I just bummed out.

[00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.920]
Just keep going away.

[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.360]
What happened?

[00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.160]
You could have a freaking party here.

[00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.700]
And it was gonna go...

[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.520]
It's a day to remember the fallen 9-11-2001 in New York City

[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.320]
in Washington, D.C.

[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.520]
and the people that died outside of Pittsburgh

[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.660]
were always made to be made to be 93 crashed

[00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.140]
in the hills of suburban Pittsburgh.

[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.280]
And the heroes that were involved.

[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.560]
So we honored them today on this show.

[00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.180]
And we hope that everybody remembers them today.

[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.420]
And it's also Stephanie's birthday, 34th,

[00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.160]
happy birthday.

[00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.600]
The best you can make of it on a daily basis.

[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.720]
Welcome, great-bye.

[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.260]
This is your birthday tomorrow.

[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.040]
He's a good man.

[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.980]
He's a great man.

[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.580]
Just keep going.

[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.360]
Don't forget to like your friend, Papa Joe Shavalli,

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.160]
and birthday tomorrow.

[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.000]
Bye-bye.

[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.680]
I love to all those people.

[00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.080]
And I'll go off and have sex later.

[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.460]
Sure, no problem.

[00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.880]
So the bottom line is...

[00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.900]
Neil, is he there already?

[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.800]
No, I'm not here.

[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.100]
Okay, don't bother me.

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.660]
I'm just looking to keep going.

[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.100]
You're on a roll.

[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.440]
I said he'll mid-byte sounds good.

[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.700]
Do you want me to play some bets for you or anything?

[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:14.820]
What are you talking about?

[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.900]
About something about fist.

[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.580]
He stuck his fist where and clearance is...

[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.700]
What the hell are we talking about?

[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.560]
He never said there was a fist or a thing in the rectal area.

[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.920]
But I'm not going to look into that until later as a...

[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.720]
So in other words, the asshole sitting in there don't have me on the air.

[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.240]
I've been rambling here for like two minutes.

[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.000]
So you're on the air.

[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.000]
Just got in here.

[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.260]
You're on the air now.

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.080]
There you go.

[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.320]
Yeah, I hear you.

[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.140]
Well, that's because who had me on the audition?

[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.600]
I need never have got auditioned.

[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.440]
You're a star.

[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.860]
Your punks, your punks in a control room.

[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.240]
They're Robert Gugler sleepers.

[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.280]
No, we had it right in here.

[00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.080]
I don't know what's going on.

[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.220]
So who had it in Echo?

[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.720]
Maybe that was the hit of one.

[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.240]
Everybody is absolving themselves of blame.

[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.400]
I remember the banning time with the money back to 10 and you just rambling.

[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.840]
I love it. Just keep going.

[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.420]
What's going on? Is it there?

[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.880]
Three minutes past 10.

[00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.560]
It's only 703 out there so you've got another three hours to go.

[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.520]
My watch is wrong.

[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080]
It's five of. I need another one.

[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.900]
Let me ask you a question. What time is your show on 8 to 10, right?

[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.080]
It's on 8 to 10.

[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.940]
So in Vegas now it's 703.

[00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.280]
Yeah. So you've got like almost three hours to go.

[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.100]
Just keep going.

[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.760]
Okay.

[00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.180]
The mile is way to begging.

[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.940]
Marlins are 60 over.

[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.200]
They're 80, 165.

[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.340]
I ran into the MGM.

[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.760]
I ran to the sports market five.

[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.440]
I love the MGM.

[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.840]
It's fancy. I can't even imagine how nice my room is.

[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.240]
So anyway, I go to the sports market.

[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.620]
I play a bit on the bridge and they beat the Phillies in the first bet I placed in Vegas.

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.180]
I hit.

[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.420]
Oh right. So I won a bunch of money and I think that the

[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.680]
Marlins are up again.

[00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900]
You get my call together, DeGenerate Gamblers. We have on the station.

[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.040]
You realize that nobody on QAM has ever lost a bet. You do understand that, don't you?

[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.200]
Oh, I lost a lot of bets like the Dolphin.

[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.200]
You're in the olden London because all the chronic gamblers we have on the station, which is most of our people,

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.400]
is you know, gamblers only talk about the bets they cashed.

[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.820]
Not the Zidian ones that they lost.

[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.560]
All right. The first thing I do on Monday is I'm in there and talk about all the ones I eat.

[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.340]
Yeah.

[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.600]
I mean, some of my picks are so bad. Like I do a show in Atlanta.

[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.300]
I'm in the top.

[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.960]
Do I have a room service at the MGM?

[00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.600]
Do I have I ordered it yet?

[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.460]
Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.460]
Room service is awesome there. It's like going to a gourmet restaurant.

[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.620]
That's how good the room service is.

[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.780]
Well, I'm going to have to do that today on my girlfriend's birthday.

[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.060]
And you know, the best part of every meal I eat is I'm going to give the builder clearance.

[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.520]
And what does that restaurant I mentioned yesterday but it escapes my memory because I have all

[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.620]
the Alzheimer's today. What the hell is that?

[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.600]
I'm not talking about it in there.

[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.620]
The rest, the great gourmet restaurant down by the Imperial Palace.

[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.620]
What is it, George? I always forget the name of it.

[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.240]
I had it yesterday.

[00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.880]
I just wanted to get rid of it.

[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.760]
George, get rid of it.

[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.800]
Rosewood Grill, you're reading in there?

[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.000]
I didn't get the Rosewood Grill. They got great lobster.

[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.060]
Go down there and mention my name. They'll laugh you out of there.

[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.420]
I had a restaurant at a place called Hugo Seller in the Four Queens, Down on Freedom,

[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.680]
which is a great state tour.

[00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:53.180]
Oh, Queens, yeah.

[00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.760]
And then the other place I'm going to take them to is in West.

[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.580]
What's the name of the place is the garlic realm of your head?

[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.940]
That place is over like the West.

[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.560]
You got 3, 4 C. Who else you're taking?

[00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.520]
It's me, dear. I got so France, a good Jew with me.

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:06.820]
Oh, Scott is with you?

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.620]
That's what I talk about. I mean, Zach.

[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.820]
You got so good in your show for no more.

[00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.980]
Zach, Jesus, why you take a fat cow like that out there with you?

[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.300]
Because he likes it, and you're 55 years old, and that.

[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.080]
You eat a meal or two.

[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.040]
Somebody who's emaciated and scrawling, if we had anybody like that working,

[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.340]
like Theran's would have been good.

[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.920]
Tomorrow's show, we're going to dedicate it entirely.

[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.860]
You would barely see it, but like Theran saw hide under your bed, let him watch.

[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.340]
He was obsessed with it. He liked to listen.

[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.820]
Everybody wants to have sex with me.

[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.920]
He doesn't have the balls to touch her, but he just would like to listen to the sound of the sound.

[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.240]
He did touch her at a myelin's game. He felt so up her leg.

[00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.040]
Did he really?

[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.720]
Yeah, he did.

[00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:42.120]
From the scroll in front of a single verse that's gotten him laid so often.

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.800]
He worked and then go out with her.

[00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.580]
He reaches right out and tries to like grab it.

[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.500]
So tomorrow I'm going to do gambling all day.

[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.620]
I'm going to bet on every college game and every program.

[00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.940]
We've just tried that every other day.

[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.740]
What about you?

[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.780]
You said he was a tough handful to handle.

[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.400]
I heard that Clarence does love a handful, speaking of fisting.

[00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.940]
Anyway, Neil, have a great day.

[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.180]
You too, Scott, by the way, if you want another couple hours, just keep going.

[00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.000]
Oh, thanks.

[00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.840]
I'll do it tomorrow, do it all six hours.

[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:06.540]
All right.

[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.540]
I love you.

[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.040]
I love you.

[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.800]
See.

[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.080]
Birthday, Troy. You're our only hope.

[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.420]
Are you ready for some football?

[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.660]
Our old Mars vote presents the Nazi football league.

[00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.340]
Tonight, a mighty Christian area,

[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.200]
take on the week liberal dissenters.

[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.460]
And now, do I be the government with Heinrich Himmler and Russ Wimbong?

[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.900]
That would be the best.

[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.320]
The third or the last time I was in the league was the most blue.

[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.280]
And Bill Antolli gave me that film.

[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.700]
This Heinrich, my friend, is a good night for football and this glorious administration.

[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.580]
The identity of the House of David.

[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.040]
Oh, you are so right, Heinrich.

[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.920]
It's your part and the fun.

[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.400]
But the dissenters acquired some light people in the draft.

[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.020]
You know how well they're bred to rock.

[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.440]
They go east to the Mainland, get some interesting fun.

[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.760]
And Bill Antolli had even said that.

[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.660]
The dissenters hard to point onto the field.

[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.080]
They could tell by the reaction of his crowd.

[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.280]
The Mottelman.

[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.360]
And they can lead them to the Mainland and put it to a whole new world, definitely sweet.

[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:10.140]
It's not so not a fear of it.

[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.040]
And here comes the mighty Christian Arians.

[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.000]
The Indian Arians are both from the North.

[00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.220]
And a perfectly dead one for Lee.

[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.500]
With the new rules in place, Arians will start this game.

[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.920]
So the people who grow to have to get in there.

[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.580]
Both teams are lining up.

[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.900]
The flag is down and.

[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.000]
The mighty Christian Arians wants to get March 2 victory.

[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.880]
The Mottelman.

[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.080]
Bring it in.

[00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.000]
This portion of the Nazi football team.

[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.600]
It was brought to you by Citibank.

[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.840]
A line out of ten Saudi terrorists prefer Citibank to any other underground funding.

[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.640]
10-09-560 WQM Happy Thursday, too.

[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.660]
It's September 11th, so we have to remind you that.

[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.940]
No.

[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:01.800]
That wouldn't think so.

[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:07.680]
The news networks, of course, are just inundating the public with wall-to-wall, round-of-clock,

[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.820]
reminiscing and hand-ringing.

[00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.280]
It's one thing to remember, but nobody's ever going to forget.

[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.260]
I don't think this is one of those days when we have to say,

[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.280]
let's remember the heroes and let's reflect back.

[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.460]
Do we really have to do that?

[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.620]
No.

[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.300]
Unless you do.

[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:20.400]
I think we have to.

[00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.820]
No, I think we need a four-hour moment of silence.

[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.440]
Sounds good to me.

[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.380]
Let's start right now.

[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:30.460]
Speaking of moments of silence, this is not the way to build a railroad.

[00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.880]
We figured out what happened.

[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:35.200]
No, but let me express this before you interrupt as usual.

[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.780]
I never have any idea when I'm on here, because you know,

[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.400]
or clearance is little boyfriends in there, they open up the pod.

[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:43.220]
Let me stop you now.

[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.420]
Whatever the hell they feel like it, yeah.

[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:44.880]
Please.

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:45.580]
For help.

[00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:45.840]
Please.

[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.520]
Didn't have his headphones on and or up.

[00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.560]
In other words, he couldn't hear me reverberating from the walls of the MGM grand.

[00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:53.900]
We sent him out.

[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.440]
They're not listed in my show at the MGM grand in Vegas while shame on them.

[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.240]
Probably a bunch of glam.

[00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.320]
He wasn't listening to himself.

[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.920]
It didn't occur to him that that's the only way that he was going to be able to hear you.

[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.740]
He was caught up his hands.

[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.720]
Because everything was fine on this end.

[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.740]
Oh my God.

[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.640]
I'm looking like a shot.

[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:11.360]
That is pretty amusing.

[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.200]
But no, even when he's there, a lot of times I have no idea when I'm on,

[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.180]
because when a little hand hits the big hand, it gets to be 10 o'clock.

[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.020]
That's when this pod should be open.

[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.800]
Okay, the kind of money that they're paying me, they want to get the full four hours.

[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.920]
Okay, Robert, you little quizzling, you little pansy, you silly little goose, you,

[00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.540]
who should have been fired a long time ago if they could have pictures of clearance in the beast?

[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.220]
God, that kid's a piece of crap.

[00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:37.320]
Anyway, now what that was I just saying, oh that I never know when a hell of a mom.

[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:37.800]
That's okay.

[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:38.900]
So it was Scott's fault.

[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.400]
But he's a little bit wound up, you know.

[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.040]
I liked it though.

[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.160]
I had the feeling he was never going to stop.

[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.540]
He just was, it was good.

[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:46.980]
As only he can do.

[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.180]
Anyway, here's our poll result from yesterday.

[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.940]
I'm delighted to see that I did it very well.

[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:52.540]
I'm dangerous.

[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.600]
Other than George W. Bush, who is the most dangerous man in the world today.

[00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.460]
Osama, your mom, my nut.

[00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.800]
Osama was in about third place most of the day.

[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.520]
And then the announced that they had received the videotape and the audio and a whole deal there.

[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.880]
And I guess that inspired people to like say, oh my God.

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.560]
Yeah, he's dangerous.

[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:11.960]
He's still alive.

[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.900]
Isn't it something all these bastards who are still alive?

[00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.540]
Didn't somebody once say that we were going to get him better alive?

[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.140]
You heard that other cowboy talking all out of the baloney, you know.

[00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.180]
I'm going to go out there and chop off the head of the snake and all this other crap.

[00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.400]
He's still roaming around there.

[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.660]
He looked pretty good health to me.

[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.180]
And Alzo Azohari, whatever his boyfriend's name is there.

[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.080]
It looked like they were just in the pink of good health.

[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.520]
So anyway, after that tape came out, Osama moved into first place.

[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.560]
Out of 1142 votes, the most dangerous man in the world other than our president day is Osama with 207.

[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.220]
Dick Chaney, though, a very respectable second for a guy with a heart that beats once in hour, 191.

[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.040]
Donald Rumsfeld, who's absolutely lost at 177.

[00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:56.080]
John Ashcroft, 158.

[00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.880]
Now, we added him late and we apologize for that, but isn't it impressive the way he steadily moved up?

[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.940]
He goost stepped up the ladder?

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:01.400]
Yeah.

[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:02.940]
He had those jack boots on.

[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:09.280]
Kim Jong-il, 107, which is pretty impressive too, considering about 80% of the audience hasn't got any ID who that is.

[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.040]
Moe Howard David did 74.

[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.060]
He didn't do too bad.

[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:12.540]
Absolutely.

[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.060]
The Pope 67, yours truly, Neil Rogers 46.

[00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.660]
I'm proud to be that dangerous.

[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.500]
Even more dangerous than Fat Ariel Ciron, only 36.

[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.220]
Rush Limbaugh 33.

[00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:23.720]
Small potatoes now, I guess.

[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.560]
Especially now that he's, uh, hockin' with a pigskin.

[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:28.240]
Jerry Falwell only 18.

[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.500]
Paul Wolfowitz 14.

[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:30.820]
Pat Robertson 12.

[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.340]
And Richard Pearl only two.

[00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:33.480]
Guess what, folks?

[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.600]
That's, that was your mistake.

[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.880]
Richard Pearl should have been way up on the list.

[00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:38.200]
Yeah.

[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.620]
But they don't know who that is.

[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.460]
On top of Dick.

[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.060]
He should have been ahead of Dick, yeah.

[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.280]
So anyways, already 12 past 10.

[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.880]
And we're just, uh, poor, I like those, for all those long, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, like that.

[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.300]
It's great. Now some of our audience, we got about a few people with no sense of humor.

[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:53.200]
About third man.

[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.740]
And they don't like that because they hate him.

[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.020]
But of course in South Florida, everybody hates everybody anyway.

[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.580]
You can't, you can't have anyone.

[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.600]
Even Britney Spears, there are probably some people that hate Britney, you know?

[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:01.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.160]
Couple of fags.

[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.320]
How could you hate Britney?

[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:04.940]
I don't know.

[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.220]
Well, maybe just for revenge on the fact that she allegedly was doing Justin Tinkerbell,

[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.100]
I'd, I'd guarantee she never touched it.

[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.180]
Never saw it.

[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:12.640]
Okay.

[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:12.840]
Huh?

[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.740]
I'm talking about his vagina.

[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:15.900]
He certainly doesn't have a penis.

[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.300]
Yeah, yeah, sure.

[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.400]
So you really believe Justin Tinkerbell has a penis?

[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:19.760]
No.

[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:20.740]
Oh, come on.

[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:20.900]
Yeah.

[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.540]
Why do you think they call him Tinkerbell?

[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.800]
Remember the summer of 42 went ahead to tie the bells around their privates?

[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.040]
No.

[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.860]
You never saw, and not the summer of 42, the class of 44 was the sequel with Gary Grimes?

[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:31.260]
No.

[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:32.940]
Well, what do you know?

[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.920]
You never saw that movie?

[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.700]
Does that the fraternity one with the guy died?

[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.700]
1013 at 560 WQA.

[00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.240]
And hey, guys, if you spent the entire year last year avoiding mirrors like Bella Legosi,

[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.980]
because you're sick and tired of seeing a giant bald spot.

[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:48.080]
Well, here's the deal for you.

[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.780]
If you're constantly looking back for the baseball cap to cover up that ugly glaring shiny spot on your head,

[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.420]
time to call my good buddy Charles Alfieri for a lifetime.

[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.320]
He's been putting out the best hair in the business using the very latest technology.

[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.780]
It's called the natural hairline system.

[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.900]
And it looks like real hair.

[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.680]
That's the difference.

[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.500]
It doesn't look like a dead weasel on your head.

[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.720]
It doesn't look like somebody drilled holes in your head with a blood dripping on your forehead.

[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.880]
You don't have to take any dangerous pills that'll really propish you off.

[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.700]

We are Sports Radio 560s, UAM.

[00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.900]
New York.

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.740]
Hey dudes, hey man, you have a haircut that's short on the top and long on the back.

[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:07.760]
Well you know a mallet.

[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.360]
Let's all take care of it properly with Mullet Shampoo.

[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:11.500]
Mullet Shampoo.

[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:12.960]
We're all hell yeah.

[00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:19.080]
Mullet Shampoo adds body to the spiky part on the top and a lustrous sheen to the flowing locks in the back.

[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.800]
Business in the front or in the back.

[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.540]
Dude you bitch, and Mullet Shampoo is perfect for all kinds of Mullets.

[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:34.440]
Like the achy breaking band, the staking, the lever paddle, the comaril cut, hockey hair, the neck warmer, the soccer rocker, and the all fired Kentucky waterfall.

[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.400]
Not to mention the Tennessee top-ass.

[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.440]
Oh but dude, will Mullet Shampoo work on my eighth thread?

[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.280]
No problem, oh, shorty long back.

[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.960]
But don't take my word for it.

[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.060]
Listen to Mullet Shampoo, some celebrity endorsement.

[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.420]
Howdy.

[00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:46.840]
I'm Billy Ray Cyrus.

[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:53.540]
My escoral pal made me the number one country star between the months of March and June of 1992.

[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:55.540]
And it's all because of Mullet Shampoo.

[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.360]
No, I'm Billy.

[00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:56.960]
Yeah.

[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.940]
So hop in your I-Rot T28.

[00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.080]
Pull the whole shot, sir.

[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.440]
Hope we're done store for a final of Mullet Shampoo.

[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.140]
Mullet Shampoo.

[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:09.240]
Just because your haircut is 20 years old doesn't mean your shampoo has to be.

[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:13.780]
Just saw a preview for a temptation island all I can say is holy crap.

[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:14.420]
Wow.

[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:15.140]
Yeah.

[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:16.940]
Got push-and-goody.

[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.720]
Okay, here's our poll for today.

[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.300]
Now we do this every year after the summer.

[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:24.360]
Now we've had a couple of weeks of the audience is, you know, it's fallen out, fallen back in.

[00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.880]
They're falling, they're, they're boot stepping along.

[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.180]
And we do it every year to see how Georgia's coming along under my tutelage.

[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:35.360]
He's gone from horrendous grotesque, embarrassing, and humiliating, and bush league, and mumbling to be awkward.

[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:39.380]
To what, I know, I voted for, what's leading right now.

[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:39.800]
Look at that.

[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.760]
I voted for that and probably so did you.

[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.140]
No, I voted for Okales.

[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.220]
Well, then I'm looking at that then.

[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.560]
I've got five categories here.

[00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.220]
How did George do filling in this summer?

[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:50.300]
Here are your choices.

[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:51.060]
Great job.

[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:51.760]
Best ever.

[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:52.940]
Fabulous.

[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.560]
Time for Neo to retire.

[00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.580]
Okay, I listened.

[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.680]
Week, I really listened or awful.

[00:14:58.800 --> 00:14:59.640]
I stopped listening.

[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.720]
Now just, just went up there.

[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:05.120]
We only got seven votes because then needless to say, we like catching them off guard.

[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.000]
Plus we didn't realize there.

[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:07.900]
Look at that already.

[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:08.600]
Uh-oh.

[00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.500]
I said, well, we'll see how it shakes out.

[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.340]
But that's a good sign.

[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.260]
Three say, time for Neo to retire.

[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:20.340]
So if that wins, what I'm going to do, because I can't afford to retire yet, but I'm going to do like semi-retirement.

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:21.080]
Okay.

[00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:23.780]
And, no, seriously, I'll take your role.

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.760]
I'll be like the, I don't want to say the passive.

[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.180]
It has like sexual connotation.

[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.060]
I'll be like, you know what I mean?

[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.120]
You'll be the silent partner.

[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.280]
I'll be the silent partner.

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:35.360]
And you'll basically do the show and you'll take the, well, I'll punch up the call, but then you'll talk to him.

[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:35.940]
Okay.

[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:37.920]
And I'll hit the drops.

[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.340]
And I'll hit like that.

[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.180]
You know, well, I'm going to try to do as much with the kind of money they're paying me.

[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.500]
I want to do a little bit of something, you know.

[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:44.940]
All right.

[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.000]
By the way, I found an article.

[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.900]
I got lots of articles.

[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.240]
I'm going to read some stuff today, which I know they get upset about.

[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.980]
Well, in the honor of 9-11, we can do something and like maybe educate people a little bit.

[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:53.960]
Yeah.

[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:54.460]
Okay.

[00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.120]
Well, I mean, I said a little bit.

[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:56.440]
All right.

[00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.300]
But I was looking for this the other day.

[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.780]
Remember, I was asking you because I saw Blurban City Pulse here and I couldn't find the article.

[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.360]
Here it is from the Guardian today.

[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:04.860]
The British newspaper.

[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:07.300]
Actually, it's from Tuesday, September 9th.

[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.700]
So I must have found it on one of our, one of our websites.

[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.680]
Academic says al-Qaeda stronger than pre-9-11.

[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:15.680]
Okay.

[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:16.380]
Don't let me forget that.

[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.440]
Also, somebody that I thank good, you know.

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:18.880]
All right.

[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:19.920]
By the way, I found an article.

[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.860]
I got lots of articles.

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.180]
I'm going to read some stuff today, which I know they get upset about.

[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.920]
Well, in the honor of 9-11, we can do something and like maybe educate people a little bit.

[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:27.920]
Yeah.

[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:28.400]
Okay.

[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.060]
Well, I mean, I said a little bit.

[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:30.380]
All right.

[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:32.260]
But I was looking for this the other day.

[00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:35.720]
Remember, I was asking you because I saw Blurban City Pulse here and I couldn't find the article.

[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.320]
Here it is from the Guardian today.

[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:38.880]
The British newspaper.

[00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.580]
Checkmarks there, Scott.

[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:42.120]
I don't understand what happened to my phone.

[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:43.700]
I see Chuck Martin.

[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.140]
Please don't turn it.

[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.280]
He's working here.

[00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:45.800]
Everything works.

[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.400]
No, here it's not.

[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.780]
All the checkmarks just went out.

[00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:49.880]
You just, the monitor did a little blurb like you were saying.

[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.400]
Oh, okay.

[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.080]
This relaxes you to a plate.

[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.060]
Everything came back.

[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:53.680]
Just come back.

[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.100]
Here's plantation.

[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:55.560]
Hello.

[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:57.460]
Leo.

[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:58.340]
Yes, sir.

[00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.280]
What's up, buddy?

[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.160]
How are you doing, pal?

[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.180]
I love calling when you got something going on about George.

[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.380]
Hallelujah, pal.

[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:05.780]
Yes.

[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.000]
Yeah.

[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.880]
He's the absolute worst.

[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:10.160]
You should have a category on there, unlistenable.

[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:11.360]
Yeah.

[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:12.620]
What we do?

[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.220]
We do have.

[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.680]
It's an awful, I stop listening.

[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:16.600]
Oh, okay.

[00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:17.160]
Well, that's good.

[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.680]
But I mean, I'll be, you know, I'll wake up or I'm going to work on.

[00:17:20.820 --> 00:17:21.600]
Oh, Neal's on.

[00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.160]
I turn it on and as soon as I hear that, that, that...

[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.900]
That's mumbling blur.

[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:37.280]
He looks like he looks like Yoda is what he looks like if you ever see now. He's real. He's like 311

[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:42.000]
Yeah, but please keep him off the air put on I don't know

[00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.220]
Jesus

[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.940]
In fact, you must be you must be a pressure because Jesus will be filling in next up about wicked studs

[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.080]
What about Rick and Suds they want to get paid how bad Carlos?

[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.340]
Have a great day pal

[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:02.420]
He was good. I like him. He's enthusiastic. He hates you like poison and how come that didn't drop out? Uh-oh

[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:09.800]
Assistant produces currently not connected to a server so now I got out this hasn't happened a long time, right? I think it's sabotage

First of all, what else is there on the radio to listen to the side of the board? You want to speak and talk to your Lord?

[00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.920]
Nobody wants to listen to the block war the other thing is

I'll make you don't even know why

[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.360]
They blocked investigation and information's better but

[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.740]
They got your sword and you find a him blind

[00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:50.380]
And so many more will die from his deceit and lies

[00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.180]
Who's calling the shot and really running the place

[00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:59.160]
Why is it so many already up?

[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:03.900]
Bush stinks, Bush stinks, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:08.180]
They have to be you, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:16.180]
They have to be you, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:27.090]
He wants us to admit he'd not be me yet

[00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:34.450]
Who's once in a hole? Bush stinks, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:39.450]
They have to be you, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:45.630]
They have to be you, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:52.090]
They have to be you, Bush stinks, Bush stinks, Bush stinks

[00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:57.770]
Bush stinks, be sure watch your hands frequently guys and girls

[00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:01.370]
with anti-bacteriological soaps and liquids and detergents

[00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:05.750]
20,040 we had for the best of meal up stuff on that through Sunday

[00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:08.330]
And here it is like Thursday and we still had only 20,040

[00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:12.350]
20. This has got to be the worst, the most inept fundraiser I've ever been involved

[00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:17.230]
with in my life. I mean we're now like into the period we're almost coming up to an end

[00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:24.970]
of a full month. Yeah and it's a pretty lame. Great nothing happening. Now I do see we

[00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:29.670]
have a van hit tomorrow at the Yershall station Sheridan Street just west of I-95. It has

[00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:35.250]
no time again. See this is this is a problem. Is there we're trying to like do this in a vacuum

[00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:39.110]
and it's not working out all that great. So you'll have the best of the merchandise there

[00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:42.990]
at the Shell Station on Sheridan Street just west of I-95 which I'm sure it probably has

[00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.690]
like a name the place where it is you know. Is that the one by where we used to be?

[00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:55.970]
Okay. By where Paxen used to be? I reckon by the Cox building there on Sheridan Street just

[00:23:55.970 --> 00:24:00.730]
for nobody. Are we do we have a communication problem here Houston? I think what we have is a

[00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:04.430]
is that far too. That's the kind of relay information as we're talking. I love it one.

[00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:12.090]
Yes that's the the Shell Station you're talking about and 111 is the time. 11 to 1? Yes. 11 a.m.

[00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.770]
to 1 p.m. tomorrow. Okay. Because we need to give this thing rolling for a band and pet rescue

[00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:21.710]
because it is really really lame. You got your Mohar David Keechane. Absolutely. All the other good

[00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:25.390]
cramped that we got. Best of the Eel CDs. We didn't even put one out last year. So we got two

[00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.990]
years worth and not everybody can make making copies. Look at that. I got that thing working again.

[00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:36.970]
Oh. The internet was down. It was on your end. Right. The internet wasn't down here. It was on your

[00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:40.590]
end. Right. In the bus we want to tell you. I know why because even on that computer I clicked

[00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.990]
onto the internet explorer and it came up like instantaneously like faster than you could take a

[00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:51.350]
cramp. How do you like that? But it's as usual we have technical problems on your end in some

[00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:56.390]
photo. It's so sad. It's so very very sad. What do you mean the internet was down in the building?

[00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:02.630]
No way. No way. You know. So in other words my studio here's like a stepchild of the kind of

[00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:07.370]
cheap crap you got down there. That's the problem. Because my internet here never goes out and

[00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:12.390]
it's lightning fast. It's so quick. Look at that. It's just a George Corso's an asshole. It just

[00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:17.110]
printed it out automatic. Automatic pilot. 129 votes. Man, they're whipped up about you.

[00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:22.850]
See one thing about George even as much as he mumbles and is low key and is boring as some people

[00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:28.290]
that is the fact that the matter is he engenders a phenomenal response. There are a few people who

[00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.930]
have no opinion about George Rodriguez. Let me tell you that right now. They either love him

[00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:37.630]
or they hate him. They either love him like crazy and they have like some special thing with his

[00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:42.950]
eating ass routine or they just hate him and find him obnoxious and humanly unacceptable on a

[00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:50.370]
visceral level. Don't you love saying that on a visceral level? That's a good word. I love that

[00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.730]
word. Anyway, here's what we got so far on our poll on George's performance. We got 140 votes

[00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:01.350]
in less than half an hour. You follow me? How did George do filling in the summer? Okay, I

[00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:07.290]
listen 42. Say, no, let's not care. Okay. So they say why did Joseph Yankee?

[00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:20.130]
Awful. I stopped listening 35. Week. I rarely listen 33. Great job. Best ever 23. Fabulous. Time for

[00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.170]
time. We started out with four like in a very one of them was mine because I would like to be

[00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.410]
Terry if I could get paid for it. Don't you think I've earned it? I've paid my dues? Sure.

[00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:31.770]
I mean, with a kind of Paul NC, I don't see a name on line six. Now probably a good reason.

[00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:33.310]
Here's line six. Q. I. M.

[00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.490]
Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, good morning. How are you doing?

[00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:42.750]
Good. Listen, I think he's doing an okay job. I guess you would have to check with your ratings

[00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.710]
if you see how they are, but he's doing great. Joseph, I want to touch base.

[00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:49.630]
I can really hear the call, Scott. I think it's you if that pod is probably

[00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:55.790]
where Jared smoked it. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Yeah, you know that tape that Osama came out with or

[00:26:55.790 --> 00:27:01.510]
allegedly or what? Right. Well, what do you mean allegedly? Didn't you see it? Yeah, but

[00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:06.670]
I think is it really him? I mean, you don't know. I mean, he's got body. We don't know what we

[00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.130]
don't know when it was made. They're saying they think it was made in April. I have no idea how

[00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:15.010]
they know that. Okay. They said he was even pacidic he candy or something. So they think it was in

[00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:20.890]
April. Well, one thing, you know, it's really scary what they're saying is that, you know, because it came

[00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:26.510]
out during, you know, September 11th today, yesterday came out. Right. And they keep on saying with,

[00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:32.850]
you know, what Osama keeps saying with, you know, we keep backing Israel or whatever, but we back all

[00:27:32.850 --> 00:27:37.830]
sorts of countries. What's the difference to we back? I mean, you know, do you understand what I'm saying?

[00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:44.630]
Bobby, you can't rationalize the crap. Well, that does make a difference as far as the

[00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:50.210]
billions of dollars and other 87 billion just asked to get now to fight a fan to try to put the

[00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:53.450]
mess back together that we created in Iraq, which has nothing to do with any of this. This is,

[00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.590]
this is one of the most frustrating parts of this whole 9-11 anniversary to me is that here we are

[00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:01.530]
and everybody's, you know, bowing their heads and doing the obligatory reading the names of the dead

[00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:07.430]
again. But in the meantime, the billions of dollars we should be spending to nail bin Laden and all

[00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:11.690]
of these lunatics who are left and get rid of al-Qaeda once and for all, we're not doing that. What

[00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.610]
we're doing is we're wasting the money in Iraq so that they can have their pipeline get

[00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:18.710]
hold of their hands on the oil and do the rebuilding job with our friends at Bechtel and Haliburton.

[00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:22.350]
It's criminal. Exactly. I agree with you and that's what they were saying yesterday on the

[00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:27.510]
youth, but they had to retain that, you know, all these millions of dollars are going in Iraq and

[00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:34.110]
they'll go after Osama. They're not even doing it anymore. So not only are we destroying our economy,

[00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:39.050]
but we're making the country weaker and more dangerous for the American people. It's an

[00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:44.330]
insult to the memory of the people who died on 9-11. It's a slap in the face. Yes, sir. Okay, thank

[00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:48.830]
you. Have a great day. Have a great day. Yeah, don't let me forget when we come back, al-Qaeda

[00:28:48.830 --> 00:28:52.570]
stronger than pre-9-11. I knew I saw this story on CityPulse a couple of days ago. I couldn't find

[00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:56.710]
it printed out and here it is in the British newspaper, of course, the Guardian Unlimited in the

[00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:00.370]
Brit paper. So if you want the real news, forget about CNN, which stands for Certainly Not News

[00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:04.970]
or MSNBC, which stands for, hey, how can we away the flag and be more right-wing than Fox?

[00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.810]
I forget about it. You're not going to get it on the American. We're sorry you're going to get

[00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.310]
this problem as they continue waving to pom-poms and just to give him propaganda. In other words,

[00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.450]
a bunch of bullcrap. My life and laws. This is for trade-off by City.

[00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.270]
You way, you way.

[00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:31.150]
Yes. The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to domative

[00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.330]
people killed with the gas that we sold in.

[00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:40.450]
Warmer's time, a crescent nation and the only one that's going. Now more blood will be spilled

[00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:47.470]
to get that oil going. Forget about Korea and the notes there tell to Namba,

[00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:59.130]
right-wing is drilling it over and over and to our head. That iraq has some weapons of

[00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.470]
mass destruction.

[00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:17.290]
3000 people killed. I now forgot let's exploit them instead.

[00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:21.950]
Hey, there's oil to be counted. Going after September 2.

[00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:30.390]
Plankato Sama. There's no longer mention of the name in Laden but no one seems concerned all.

[00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:35.370]
Come be in complacence. Believe in every word of this cartel of

[00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:42.990]
administration that controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right-wing is

[00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:53.810]
drilling it over and over and to our head. That iraq has some weapons of mass destruction.

[00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:10.650]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying. We're all suspects now.

[00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:14.690]
Not the ash drop this sand. I have nothing to hide.

[00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:20.770]
Tables, partners, all are sand. Lino-pedian cattle don't have any reservation.

[00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:27.390]
Out of provoked fatiless. World annihilation. Old regime must fall in

[00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:31.230]
hell and burden and stout with no objection at all.

[00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:39.790]
Till the crack don't have the balls and the right wing is drilling it over and over and to our

[00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:46.770]
parade was passed. I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:54.910]
Only I rack has some weapons of mass destruction.

[00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.470]
Probably the greatest sanctuity in the history of the human race. That should be played from

[00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:03.530]
loud features all over America today. Real, real loud. Don't you think without a dude?

[00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.670]
Without a dude? By the way, you know that cell station where Miguel is going to be tomorrow

[00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.230]
between 11 and 1 in Hollywood. It's kind of like Moe. Here's an easy way to remember where it is.

[00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:15.690]
It's like Moe. It's over the hill. Right? Very good. Right? Sure enough. I thought that was

[00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:19.670]
kind of cute. Absolutely. Look at like Moe. It's over the hill. Because when you like going

[00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:27.230]
along on Sheridan Air, when you're heading west, east, I mean east, right? And there's like

[00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.910]
a little incline and I hope you're inclined to stop there and buy a bunch of merchandise.

[00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:34.810]
If we don't get $2,000 there tomorrow, I know it's only two hours 11 and one. But if we don't raise

[00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:39.410]
two grand for Best of Neal and abandoned Pevrescu, I'm going to be parked off. And when I get parked

[00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:44.790]
off, I get dangerous. It's big and dangerous. Yeah. How come how come I? Oh, I see.

[00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:51.210]
I just have that sitting here. Well, just in case. The Marlins are 16 games over 500. We got to talk

[00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:57.130]
sports. Okay. Here's a real shocker for you before I get into that other story. A Kennedy is

[00:32:57.130 --> 00:33:02.470]
finally found a Republican to vote for. What a surprise. Kanoel. President John F. Kennedy's sister,

[00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:06.870]
you, you and his Kennedy Schraver came out yesterday to back her son-in-law Arnold Schwarzenegger

[00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:10.690]
as California governor, even though we're famous Democratic family as long battled Republicans.

[00:33:11.390 --> 00:33:14.870]
Schraver, of course, is the mother of Maria Schraver. In other words, she's his goddamn mother-in-law.

[00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:19.050]
This is a story in Washington Post. You people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. Okay. This is a

[00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:25.190]
new story that his mother-in-law came out in favor of while hallelujah. Oh, happy day is the

[00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.650]
Edmund Hawkins singers would say. Isn't that pathetic? That's the right. In the Washington post,

[00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:37.390]
which is supposed to be a real newspaper. Anyway, the Guardian unlimited, which is a real UK newspaper.

[00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:45.530]
UK. Okay. Says the Al-Qaeda terrorist network is stronger than before the 9-11 attacks in the

[00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:50.410]
Westled War on terror has so far been a failure. A British academic concludes in the study published

[00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:55.010]
Tuesday. Paul Rogers, no relation to Professor of Peace Studies at the University of

[00:33:55.010 --> 00:33:59.810]
Bedford in England, said the U.S.-led coalition's military successes in Afghanistan and Iraq have

[00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:05.090]
failed to crush Al-Qaeda's structure or stem its recruitment. Al-Qaeda and its associates have

[00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:09.570]
managed to plan and often undertake irremarkable ranger activities with these collectively showing

[00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:14.050]
a capability that exceeds the existing, though that existing before the 9-11 attacks Rogers wrote.

[00:34:14.050 --> 00:34:19.530]
On this basis alone, it's difficult to accept any claim that the war on terror is being won.

[00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:24.750]
But other terrorism experts said the U.S. Senate's allies had scored significant victories against

[00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:29.470]
Al-Qaeda. They cautioned however that the chaos of Port-Ware-Rak represented the setback.

[00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.390]
Rogers report was compiled for the Oxford Research Group of Fingtang specializing in arms

[00:34:35.390 --> 00:34:39.610]
control and non-proliferation issues. In his report, he said that while U.S.-led anti-terrorism efforts

[00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:43.790]
had succeeded in preventing some terrorist plots, Al-Qaeda linked a tax of killed more than

[00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:49.330]
350 people injured almost a thousand in two years since 9-11. The attacks include the October

[00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:53.650]
12,000 to bombings on the Indonesian island of Valley that killed more than 200. Car bombings

[00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:58.050]
are residential compounds in the Saudi capital of Riyadh that killed 26 in May and the August 5th

[00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:03.310]
Car bombing in the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in Indonesia, which 12 people died. They're stronger

[00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:08.050]
today than they were before 9-11, but we're winning the war on terror is what a president is telling

[00:35:08.050 --> 00:35:11.510]
and by the way, look at me, another 87 billion because we're in a quagmire in Iraq.

[00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.190]
The American public should be foaming at them out, but instead they're spending today listening

[00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:23.210]
to a bunch of kids, reading the names of the dead people who died for absolutely no reason on 9-11

[00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:30.030]
two years ago today, for no reason. Total absolute ineptitude and incompetence all the way around.

[00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.510]
And all every dime of this money could be spent for Homeland Security, for real security,

[00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:41.270]
for really battling Elkite, for really going after Osama Yomama and Mullah Bula Omar and El Zawari

[00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:47.230]
and all these other far-bison Muslims. Yeah. And let me say it again, I'm really concerned a little

[00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:52.810]
bit about how the all the air traffic stopped but within the day or two after 9-11, here was the whole

[00:35:52.810 --> 00:35:58.110]
and not just the immediate family, but it was like a 40-some odd and they were odd of the bin Laden

[00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:02.690]
kin on a plane over to Saudi back to Saudi Arabia. That's where the Chigra and the Woodpile is,

[00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:09.150]
forget about Iraq. That's where we should have been heavy duty. In fact, we know something we

[00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:12.610]
should be in Saudi Arabia, we should be in Riyadh right now, we should be running the country,

[00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:17.250]
we should have occupation in Saudi Arabia and send those Shmataids back to the where the hell they

[00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.170]
came from. What were they doing? Were they picking cotton or were they just cotton picking

[00:36:21.170 --> 00:36:27.110]
the Saudis? They're helping candles. Is that what they were doing? Sure. As long as I'm on a

[00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:31.590]
rule, I've got a lot of heavy duty stuff here today. Let the audience be all whipped up about George.

[00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:36.610]
They are whipped up on a website. Now I'll tell you, you in gender response that is so amazing.

[00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.910]
How did George do filling in this summer? Look at this, it's not even 11 o'clock yet and we put

[00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:47.190]
the pull up about 20 after. In a little over half an hour, we got 215 votes already. Is that we may

[00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:52.010]
set records today on our website, which I hope when you go to our website, you'll click on a band

[00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:56.350]
and pay rescue and get the best meal stuff and put dick in a round. If we don't raise 100 grand

[00:36:56.350 --> 00:37:01.570]
this year, I'm going to be really porked off. Then they will fear me. You think I'm danger? I was

[00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:04.490]
dangerous yesterday and I pull away until after then and you'll see dangerous.

[00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:11.070]
How did George do filling in this summer? Okay, I listened to 73. Okay, not great, but okay,

[00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.710]
that's not bad. We accept that. We take it as long as you listen. As long as you listen to

[00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.750]
and you wrote it down. You know what I'm saying? I'm sure I'll have to buy those FM stations.

[00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:22.010]
Write it down. You know, like a subtle hint. Like when you get your Arbor Tron diaries, be sure and

[00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:28.290]
write it down. Don't forget us. And so we say, don't forget us. Offal, I stopped listening 50.

[00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:35.910]
Week, I really listen 47. Great job. Best ever 38. And fabulous. Time for Neil to retire.

[00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:46.270]
Out of 215. So let's see. Let's add the good ones is 73 and 38 and 7. 45 and 73 is 118. And the

[00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:53.770]
other negative is 97. How do you like that? You got a slight lead there. Wow. In a current

[00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:57.630]
plantations probably like doing cartwheels up his ass. He's so pissed off and part of a boom.

[00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.130]
Seriously, he's probably inserting all kinds of rectangular objects into his body. I'll be visiting

[00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.630]
his workplace. Well, you've got to see. You've got a few of those guys. It's just the hate you

[00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:10.170]
like poison. I've got many of them. I've got oh boy, sure. Look at that poll yesterday. Right.

[00:38:10.330 --> 00:38:13.810]
Thank you. Out the Rush Limbaugh and Ariel Sharon is being the most dangerous piece of crap

[00:38:13.810 --> 00:38:18.090]
bag in the face of the globe. You're an evil doer. That case after the overthrow of President

[00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:22.650]
Salvador Ayende and the imprisonment of thousands in Chile, Professor his journalist and

[00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.370]
activist around the world continue to expose the full role of the then US government and funding

[00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:31.850]
and promoting the coup. Just like we installed Sodom in there, we helped to stick his ass in

[00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:35.670]
there. Back when it was expedient for us and helped prop him up against the Iranians against the

[00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:40.070]
I. African tola. And of course, the reason the I. Tola got an urge because we had stuck the

[00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:44.170]
shot of Iran in there and then see we just keep doing this all over the world. And then we have

[00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:49.350]
to pay a wicked price for it. Thousands of secret US documents now declassified have been

[00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.790]
synthesized in a book the Pinochet file. How do you say that actually and be careful

[00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:57.870]
are you said Pinochet? Now, but actually they always say Pinochet, which I don't know because I

[00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:01.310]
know that's not how you would say it in this fun. You'll. But anyway, the Pinochet file by Peter

[00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:06.290]
Cornblu of Washington's investigative national security archives. You know him? No. You do now.

[00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:10.590]
The documents detailed the crude workings of Washington during the Cold War. It is firm and

[00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:16.930]
continuing policy that Ayende be overthrown by a coup reads a CIA document from 1970. It is

[00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:21.110]
imperative that these actions be implemented kind bestently and securely so that the US

[00:39:21.110 --> 00:39:26.190]
government and American hands be well hidden. Two days after this document was written,

[00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.730]
top CIA officials proposed a terrorist campaign to stun the Chilean people that were accepting a

[00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:37.230]
military regime. Concord giving Turk gas canisters and gas masks, working on obtaining machine guns

[00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:42.390]
reads the CIA memo. Conservative Chileans argue that a coup was a hungroere affair, but anybody with

[00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:48.830]
a brain in IQ larger than their penis realizes that's laughable at best. Don't let me forget,

[00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.750]
we'll be come back after the break or at least sometime very soon. I want to read this Robert

[00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:56.250]
Fisk article 20 or 30 times. Don't forget, especially on the anniversary of 9-11, how freaking

[00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.830]
important it is. Not that I'm going to change the world. I'm not turning into like a male Randy

[00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:03.490]
Rhodes. Even though her heart's in the right place and has good intentions, think I'm going to

[00:40:03.490 --> 00:40:07.230]
change anything on some little horse ball sports station in Miami. And it's going to happen.

[00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:10.770]
But the Robert Fiskian, did we ever figure out how we're going to get that on our website?

[00:40:10.770 --> 00:40:15.330]
No, I'd searched and couldn't find a free copy of it. Now I couldn't either because I

[00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:20.870]
checked Buzz Flash and Smirking Chimp and all of these things. Oh, maybe we can get it from

[00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:24.770]
precious on passions today. When it up, we'll check her out.

[00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:37.870]
Come on baby, come play with these titties. One minute you're in the club and everything's fine.

[00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:39.830]
Then it strikes.

[00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:51.010]
The silent dance floor killer CRD Caucasian rhythm disorder. We've all seen someone displaying

[00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:56.030]
the classic symptoms, the flailing arms, the face-to-skin, and ability to find the beat.

[00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:01.850]
Millions suffer with the shame and embarrassment of CRD. But we know Caucasian rhythm disorder

[00:41:01.850 --> 00:41:07.230]
can be cured. You can help keep the beat alive. Call the center for rhythm disorders today and

[00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:12.690]
make your tax deductible donation. That's 1976 offbeat. Please, though carefully, send a

[00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:18.150]
buck to save the beat. Call the beauty of the universe day. And to make him stop that.

[00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:24.850]
111 at 560 WQIM. Now here it is the second anniversary of 9-11. We're talking about the great job

[00:41:24.850 --> 00:41:29.410]
or the horrible job George did this summer. We were listening to any of your observations. I'm

[00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:33.330]
sitting here ranting and raving and there's one call on the board and it says, my me chronic me

[00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:38.410]
things is a Scott probably one of those retire or one of those or maybe it's the whisper of the

[00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:43.090]
breathing heavy breather you know let's find out. Well let's find out online six. Here's my Emmy. Hello.

[00:41:43.450 --> 00:41:52.570]
Hello. Yes sir. Don't be tired. Yeah. Whatever happens. Okay. You're eight men. I'm it. Yeah.

[00:41:52.930 --> 00:42:00.190]
You have two letters on. 567 open. Why? Maybe not the first two letters. It already said I'm

[00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:04.890]
it but I know he meant something else. I'm sure. Well he was good and you see you thought he

[00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:08.290]
was a bad call. He was just want to call lick my cheeks a couple of times. What's wrong with that

[00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:12.970]
Scott? All right go answer one three then. Miss Mr. Hockey expert. I'll take the calls. You just

[00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:18.210]
relax. You're hopeless. Study. Get your hockey handbook out and start doing a little studying. Okay.

[00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:24.170]
Tell me about Portia Selming. Okay. Borgia Selming. Oh please. We should have taken that little

[00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:28.270]
trivia challenge this morning. I beg your pardon? Yeah you should have taped that. That was really good.

[00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:33.130]
Joe Bowen. Yeah. Yeah. Joe Bowen. He's going to be in gold this year. He's telling me about Kujo is

[00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:37.750]
playing gold for the Leafs. Oh brother. I'll see you answer the phone. Why did you do that? He didn't take

[00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:42.310]
you seriously. What a schmuck. You got a ton of things two or three times. I see. You're an idiot.

[00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:45.630]
You're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're an idiot. Okay. Let me read this article and let's get

[00:42:45.630 --> 00:42:51.090]
serious. These people got nothing to say. Remember going to change is it? There it is. By the way

[00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.410]
you were wrong on Tuesday. You people have voted. Nothing was going to happen on the anniversary

[00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:58.870]
night. Look at all this stuff. It's happened already. Right. You got to assimilate. Here's a kid playing

[00:42:58.870 --> 00:43:07.910]
a violin. Gohan is sproking. Serranya Schwindwag. Fitzroy. Yeah. All of this ritual and all of this

[00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:12.070]
song in advance. This is not getting the job done. This is not how you honor the memories of the

[00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:16.570]
people who died. We ought to be taking care of business. And I got to story about how ABC once again.

[00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:23.290]
Once again showed that the the borders are a joke. For the second year in the row,

[00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:26.530]
US government screeners failed to detect the shipment of depleted uranium in a container

[00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.810]
said by ABC news from overseas as part of a test of security and American ports. You can't

[00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:34.310]
complain about the security at the airports and the ports because generally speaking, there isn't

[00:43:34.310 --> 00:43:40.190]
any way. Then we got the air cargo. They sparse it at the hit himself and a goddamn box in a crate.

[00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:46.130]
Or there's so many lines you could use for that. You know. Oh brother. Hey, maybe you wanted to go

[00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:49.290]
home and pick cotton. I don't know. That's the way we brought the black people over back when it

[00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:53.630]
was expedient. Oh, I sure wish I had that thing from you got it there. I'm not going to play it

[00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:58.610]
from bowling for Columbine. You know that cartoon thing that brief history of America. We do. Oh,

[00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:02.270]
it's on a cassette. It's on a cassette that's in the thing right there. But we don't need to do it.

[00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:07.510]
I'll load it up at some point. You will probably queue up right now. It's probably screwed up.

[00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:13.950]
Anyway, Robert Fisk writes in the UK independent. Folly taken to a scale we haven't seen since World

[00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:19.770]
War II. When the attacks were launched against the World Trade Center in the Pentagon two years ago,

[00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.350]
whoever heard of Fallujah or Hila, when the Lebanese hijacker, Flouist plane into the

[00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:28.050]
grounded Pennsylvania, who would have ever believed that President George Bush would be announcing a

[00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.310]
new frontline in the war on terror as his troops embarked on a hopeless campaign against the

[00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:36.750]
guerrillas of Iraq? Who could have ever conceived of an American president calling the world to

[00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:42.330]
arms against terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq and Gaza? Gaza? What are the miserable crushed

[00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:46.630]
cruelly imprisoned Palestinians of Gaza have to do with the international crimes against humanity in

[00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:51.190]
New York, Washington and Pennsylvania? Nothing, of course. Neither does Iraq have anything to do with

[00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:55.750]
the 11th of September, nor were there any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, any al-Qaeda links with

[00:44:55.750 --> 00:45:00.330]
Iraq, any forty-five minute timeline for the deployment of chemical weapons, nor was there any liberation?

[00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:06.370]
No, the attacks on 11 September have nothing to do with Iraq. Neither did 11 September change the

[00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:10.990]
world. President Bush cruelly manipulated the grief of the American people and the sympathy of

[00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:16.070]
the rest of the world to introduce a world order dreamed up by a clutch of fantastic, how do you say

[00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:22.790]
that? Phantasists advising the Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Phantasists. The Iraqi regime

[00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:27.210]
changes, we now know, is planned as part of a Pearl Wolfowitz campaign document to the would-be

[00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:32.510]
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu years before Bush came to power. It beggars believe that

[00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:35.910]
Tony Blair should have signed up to this nonsense without realizing that it was no more or

[00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.790]
or less than a project invented by a group of pro-Israeli American neo-conservatives and right-wing

[00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:46.430]
Christian fundamentalists. But even now, we're fed more fantasy. Afghanistan, it's American-paid

[00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:50.130]
warlords, raping and murdering their enemies. It's women still shrouded for the most part of their

[00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:54.210]
bookers. It's opium production now back as the world's number one export market, and it's people

[00:45:54.210 --> 00:45:58.370]
being killed up to a hundred a week. Five American troops were shot dead two weekends ago. Is a

[00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:03.910]
success? Something which mentioned Bush and Rumsfeld still boast about. Iraq, a midden of guerrilla

[00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:09.490]
hatred and popular resentment is also a success. Yes, Bush wants 87 billion to keep Iraq running. He

[00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:13.710]
wants to go back to the same UNI condemn as a talking shop last year. He wants scores of foreign

[00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.570]
armies to go to Iraq to share the burdens of occupation, though not, of course, the decision-making,

[00:46:17.690 --> 00:46:22.990]
which must remain Washington's exclusive imperial preserve. What's more, the world is supposed to

[00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:27.610]
accept the insane notion that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the planet's last colonial war,

[00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.930]
although all mentioned of the illegal Jewish colonies in the West Bank and Gaza have been

[00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.310]
erased from the Middle East narrative in the American press, is part of the war on terror.

[00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:39.050]
The cosmic clash of religious will at present, Bush invented after 911. Could Israel's interests

[00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:44.490]
be better served by so infantile gesture from Bush? The vicious Palestinian suicide bombers

[00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:49.670]
in the grotesque implementation of Jews and implantation of Jews and Jews only in the colonies

[00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:54.170]
has now been said in this colossal struggle of good against evil, in which even Ariel Sharon

[00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:58.990]
named this personally responsible to the 1982 sovereign Shantilla massacre by Israel's own

[00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:04.690]
commissioner of inquiry, is a man of peace according to Mr. Bush. A new president's are set without

[00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:09.170]
discussion. Washington kills the leadership of its enemies with impunity. It tries to kill

[00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:13.350]
Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar and does kill Uday and Kusay Hussain in both of its prowess,

[00:47:13.650 --> 00:47:18.150]
in liquidating the al-Qaeda leadership from rocket firing drones. It tries to kill Sodom and

[00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:23.470]
Baghdad and slaughter 16 civilians and admits that the operation was not risk-free. In Afghanistan,

[00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:27.410]
three men have now been murdered in the Western Terrogation Center at Bagram. We still don't know

[00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:32.410]
what really goes on in Guad-Tanamo. What do these presidents mean? I have a dark suspicion.

[00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:37.290]
From now on, our leaders, our politicians, our statesmen will be fair game too. If we go for the

[00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:41.810]
jugular, why shouldn't they? The killing of the UN Sergei Overea del Mello was not, I think, a chance

[00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:45.710]
murder. Hamas's most recent statement and since they've been added to the Bush circus of evil,

[00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:49.350]
we should take them seriously, are now more than ever personally threatening Mr. Sharon.

[00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:54.610]
Why should we expect any other leader to be safe? If Yasser Arafat is driven into Wazal yet again,

[00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:59.710]
will there be any restraints left? Of course, America's enemies were a grizzly bunch. Sodom saw

[00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:03.810]
this country with the mass graves of the innocents. Mullah Omar allowed his misogynist legions to

[00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.830]
terrify an entire society in Afghanistan, but in their absence, we've created banditry, rape,

[00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:13.990]
kidnapping, guerrilla war and anarchy, at all in the name of the dead of 9-11. The future of the

[00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:17.950]
Middle East, which is what 9-11 was partly about, though we're not allowed to say so, has never

[00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.010]
looked bleaker and more bloody. The US and Britain are trapped in a war of their own making,

[00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:26.030]
responsible for their own appalling predicament, but responsible to fertilize of thousands of

[00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:30.870]
innocent human beings, cut to pieces by American bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq, shot down in the streets

[00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:36.670]
of Iraq by trigger-happy GI's. As for terror, our enemies are closing in on our armies in Iraq and

[00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:41.530]
are supposed to allies embag that in Afghanistan, even in Pakistan. We've done all of this in the name

[00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:46.410]
of the dead of 9-11, not since the Second World War have we seen folly on this scale, and it is

[00:48:46.410 --> 00:48:52.050]
scarcely begun. Robert Fiskin today is UK Independent. I sure wish we had a way to get that on

[00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.650]
our website, but we can't find the other way. I'm sure there will be a way, maybe just not right now.

[00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.410]
Where there's a will, there's a way, right? And our courage in a way? I mean, I'm going to maybe

[00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:04.050]
read that again later on. I have to. It's just that. It's good. Too damn good, and probably I'll do a

[00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:09.070]
better reading. And look at that. Look at the phone. Yeah, there's not one call on the board.

[00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:13.230]
Screenless, no less. Screenless we're doing, no less, not one call on the board.

[00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:17.190]
Why don't we bring C-SPAN in to hear the reflections of the public?

[00:49:17.470 --> 00:49:20.930]
Maybe they're observing a moment of silence. Is that what it is? A Euro silence in South Florida?

[00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:25.570]
A lifetime of silence? A lifetime of indifference? How did George do filling in this summer?

[00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:29.470]
We're not even as emotional as they are on a pool, and much less than now we got over 300 votes.

[00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.610]
Boy, you get him whipped up, man.

[00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:37.510]
1024 votes. How did George do? Okay, I listened. 96. Offal, I stopped listening.

[00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:44.210]
Week, I rarely listen 69. Great job. Best ever. 57. Fabulous time for Neil to retire.

[00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.170]
Eight. That's what we got so far. I don't know. We're 300 votes. You got him whipped up, man.

[00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:57.710]
WQAM. Hello? Yes, sir. I felt George did a good job, Neil. I was listening to him over

[00:49:57.710 --> 00:50:04.170]
the weekend, and he actually tried to do a radio show over the weekend. Yeah, he'd get a Saturday show.

[00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.530]
He was playing music. He thought he was an arch-boy. He was a DJ.

[00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.750]
Oh, this is Reverend Jones. WQAM. Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:14.950]
Pretty good. Listen, Neil, you're a little too smart to believe some of those things you read.

[00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:18.210]
I know you agree with a lot of what that guy just said that's that story you just read.

[00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:22.890]
What part of it don't I believe? Well, not don't believe, but you know, he's the guy sitting in

[00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:28.610]
ivory tower just writing about, you know, I just, it's part of what he did, what I just read is incorrect.

[00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.290]
Oh, that was just said as much as trigger happy GI just blown people away for the good of it.

[00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:37.010]
Did that happen to Vietnam? You damn right. It did. And a lot of people shouldn't have happened.

[00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:41.630]
Listen, we're there and it's terrible. And I 9, 11. Well, let me ask you this. Why are we?

[00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:46.530]
Why are we there? Why are we in here? Sir, sir, why are we in Vietnam and why are we in Iraq?

[00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:52.270]
Well, we dropped up that that's goofball administration in Vietnam. We shouldn't have done that.

[00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:55.690]
But that's why we prop up a goofball administration in Iraq.

[00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.690]
No, listen, it just happened, Neil. We just, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[00:50:59.690 --> 00:51:04.570]
Why can't I have a conversation with people like you? Didn't we prop up a goofball administration?

[00:51:04.590 --> 00:51:07.710]
If that's the word you want to use and saw them who say in Iraq?

[00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:13.250]
Yes, we did. Didn't we sell him chemical weapons and then we were, and then say nothing about it

[00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.410]
when he was gassing the curves? Then we do that. Well, well, there's a certain thing that didn't need

[00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:21.090]
to happen. I understand the world more complicated than you try to make it out to be.

[00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:25.630]
You know, it's like Michael Moore. You like that guy, right? You want him for president?

[00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:29.190]
I saw bowling for Colin Bein. It was very good. I understand.

[00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:33.030]
I mean, we shouldn't have finished. We did. Let me ask you this, sir. Who do you think has got a

[00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:37.250]
better grasp? Who's got a better intellect and a better grasp on the realities of life in the

[00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.910]
world today? Michael Moore or George W. Bush? Probably Michael Moore in his sense. But I don't

[00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:48.090]
Okay, thank you. In his sense. In his sense. I mean, you know, this guy's just getting all

[00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:51.750]
emotionally not saying anything, not saying anything. Well, you know, we didn't Vietnam. Yeah,

[00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:55.830]
we butchered people in Vietnam thousands and thousands and thousands. We brought 50,

[00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:59.470]
thousand American kids home and body bags. We're bringing kids home and body bags right now.

[00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:05.570]
Not in those numbers yet. Air every single day. Not to mention, of course, the fallout.

[00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:09.850]
We had this story on our website yesterday about the quality of the air in New York. Right.

[00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.930]
On the former site of the World Trade Center and the crap that the people breed

[00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:18.570]
in then and what they're still breathing in now. And you can imagine about the quality of the

[00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:22.830]
air in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq. We're not just talking about what's happening right now.

[00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:26.570]
You know, Agent Orange didn't want to kill people in a couple of weeks. It's the cumulative

[00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.150]
effect of these things. But this administration doesn't care about any of those things because

[00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:35.170]
just like Robert Fist and it said it so well. This was all planned before Bush even stole the election.

[00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:38.590]
Right. By a bunch of right wing lunatics by a bunch of crazy people.

[00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:44.310]
They stole it in a bloodless school. They stole your government from your right and broad daylight.

[00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:48.170]
And here's a guy rambling on, wow, do you really believe Michael Moore? You know,

[00:52:48.590 --> 00:52:50.570]
when are you going to get a brain, sir? When are you going to get a life?

[00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:55.190]
When are you going to stop with a partisan political horse crap? Because that's what it is in

[00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:59.810]
Americans. I'm not your horse crap. And John Kerry's running around. Well, you know, he didn't have

[00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:03.250]
any follow through plan and you leave him and running around. Well, if you were against the

[00:53:03.250 --> 00:53:07.070]
more than you're some kind of a far bus and a goi. Whatever he's talking these days, you know,

[00:53:07.590 --> 00:53:12.450]
they're all full of crap. Democratic Party is just as guilty. They set back and they like

[00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:16.530]
rubber stamped all of this crap because they were terrified of the political fallout.

[00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:21.370]
Now that it's expedient that we're stuck at a quagmire and that people are dying every day in

[00:53:21.370 --> 00:53:25.070]
a certain Americans. Now it's become fashionable. Only Howard Dean was the one right from the

[00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:29.770]
beginning who said, this is an infomalia. This is unacceptable. It's all based on a pack of lies,

[00:53:29.770 --> 00:53:36.430]
which it was. It's not even debatable anymore. And here's Colin Powell with his bull crap

[00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:39.770]
about, well, we have these maps and he's holding up this stuff at the UN and then we're telling

[00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:42.850]
you when that well, if they don't go along with his resolution that they're going to be just

[00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:46.490]
a paper tiger, they're going to be meaningless. Nobody will take them seriously. And now we're going

[00:53:46.490 --> 00:53:50.150]
back again and say, hey, can you give us a helping hand? Can you have us out of this mess we got

[00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:56.010]
ourselves into? For all time, say, yeah, for all time, say, I'm a cat lick. And of course,

[00:53:56.110 --> 00:54:05.510]
don't forget about that road map. 14 past 11. How about those ball games, man? 14 past 11 at

[00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:09.590]
560 WQM. Hey, how low can those interest rates go? I'm sure you're wondering that right now. Well,

[00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.690]
right as you speak, the financial group is doing the limbo rock. They're sneaking under that

[00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:19.110]

Credit restrictions apply rate subject to change monthly 5.19 APR.

[00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:17.930]
We're supporting you 5.16. You AM.

[00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:21.630]
Hang in the butt, honey. Are you sure?

[00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:23.770]
Yes.

[00:55:26.550 --> 00:55:27.310]
Okay.

[00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:34.750]
Back in the day when someone done us wrong, we didn't take their crap.

[00:55:35.290 --> 00:55:41.390]
In Pearl Harbor, when the jabs dropped their bombs, we bombed them bad.

[00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:48.170]
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard. And on our cards, our little flags wave.

[00:55:49.050 --> 00:55:55.830]
As that Saudi woman retarded, voice of our lures the wrong way.

[00:55:59.050 --> 00:56:05.270]
And of embarrassed to be in America, where they followed us like she.

[00:56:06.030 --> 00:56:11.350]
The United States of Americans, led by Bush and his family,

[00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:18.470]
Green they got this country up, hammering toys to the largest seas in our history.

[00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:27.250]
I don't want to be a tax America in the goddamn USA.

[00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:38.490]
What's a few thousand innocent lives? Stop living in the past.

[00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:45.670]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.

[00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:50.030]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.230]
They train us to believe.

[00:56:53.290 --> 00:57:00.690]
And anyone who says that, obviously, ends up for to leave.

[00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:06.370]
And of embarrassed to be in America,

[00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:11.990]
Oh, where we paint triadically, with a flag in one hand,

[00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:17.530]
with our head in the sand, and blindly follow the powers that we have aesthetic.

[00:57:18.490 --> 00:57:23.350]
Of washing stains from you, who's on a 65 inch screen,

[00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:27.590]
scratch your balls and find everything's okay.

[00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.770]
In the goddamn USA.

[00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:34.150]
God bless America.

[00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:38.710]
1121, fun for the mindless, that's what it's all about.

[00:57:39.050 --> 00:57:43.270]
The mindless masses, answers, 5670560, pound 560.

[00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:47.610]
Look at this, you have generated over 340 responses in an hour.

[00:57:48.190 --> 00:57:49.110]
That's a few polls, but no.

[00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:50.610]
I think that's a record.

[00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.330]
I think that may be a post-Aleon record.

[00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:55.090]
Well, there's similarities.

[00:57:55.870 --> 00:57:56.990]
How did George do?

[00:57:57.090 --> 00:57:58.390]
Yeah, but he had a larger penis.

[00:57:58.670 --> 00:57:59.950]
That's what the albuela said.

[00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:01.210]
Yeah, they ain't seen nothing.

[00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:02.430]
They were yank of it.

[00:58:02.970 --> 00:58:04.470]
How did George do filling in this summer?

[00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:05.670]
Can you imagine what it's like now?

[00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:06.370]

[00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:07.750]
No, he's probably got an inning now.

[00:58:07.810 --> 00:58:11.510]
He's probably like, uh, uh, George did okay.

[00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:12.510]
I listened to 110.

[00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:13.810]
Oh, he was okay.

[00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:14.210]
Okay.

[00:58:14.410 --> 00:58:15.730]
Which is all you can ask for, okay?

[00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:16.230]
Okay.

[00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:17.310]
110.

[00:58:17.730 --> 00:58:19.210]
Offal, I stopped listening 83.

[00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:19.990]
Oh, good news.

[00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:21.030]
What's that?

[00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:23.230]
Nothing to interrupt you, but this is really important.

[00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.830]
You interrupted me.

[00:58:23.830 --> 00:58:24.250]
Yeah, no.

[00:58:24.450 --> 00:58:27.310]
Jim is offering to email the text of the article to Eric.

[00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:29.130]
Would you, could you please, uh, Jim?

[00:58:30.050 --> 00:58:31.210]
Please do get it.

[00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:32.250]
Right?

[00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.790]
Right.

[00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.970]
ErickantNeilRodges.com.

[00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:34.390]
Thank you, Jim.

[00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:35.710]
That's Eric ERIC.

[00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:36.870]
Eric and NeilRodges.

[00:58:37.070 --> 00:58:37.650]
Well, no.

[00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:38.630]
I mean, what does he know?

[00:58:39.110 --> 00:58:41.010]
It could be with a K like a Viking.

[00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:45.830]
There are people named Eric who spell it with a K, okay?

[00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:46.510]
K.

[00:58:46.830 --> 00:58:46.830]

[00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:47.710]

[00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:50.350]
Now, what the hell was I just doing?

[00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:51.030]
I was reading the results.

[00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:51.170]

[00:58:51.770 --> 00:58:52.450]
Here we go.

[00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:54.390]
Okay, I listened to 110.

[00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:55.630]
Offal, I stopped listening 83.

[00:58:55.830 --> 00:58:57.130]
Week, I rarely listened to 75.

[00:58:57.450 --> 00:58:57.830]
Great job.

[00:58:57.930 --> 00:58:58.430]
The best ever.

[00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:59.550]
Nice going, George 65.

[00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.650]
fabulous time for NeilRodges.

[00:59:01.870 --> 00:59:03.250]
And look at how many we got on that.

[00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.630]
We got.

[00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:04.610]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:06.310]
Probably Robert Creeper voted about five times.

[00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:06.910]
You little creep.

[00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:08.010]
Creeper to Creeper.

[00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:09.890]
You little scumbag you.

[00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:11.830]
See, I was thinking about that.

[00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:12.450]
Now it's 10.

[00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:13.210]
He just voted again.

[00:59:13.830 --> 00:59:14.730]
Out of 348.

[00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:18.330]
I was thinking about these similarities between clearance

[00:59:18.330 --> 00:59:20.670]
and his little crew of sports nerd misfits.

[00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:22.490]
Clarence the beast and Robert Creeper.

[00:59:22.830 --> 00:59:23.690]
What do they have in common?

[00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:25.290]
Can't get laid.

[00:59:26.330 --> 00:59:27.310]
Why can't they get laid?

[00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:29.370]
Well, first of all, personality defect number one.

[00:59:29.710 --> 00:59:31.910]
Number two, at least that with women anyway.

[00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:34.370]
Homos don't do women.

[00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:35.770]
Number three, if you don't have a penis,

[00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:36.670]
it's kind of hard to get laid.

[00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:37.650]
Notice his strap on on.

[00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:38.710]
Maybe you want a little clearance

[00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:40.190]
that big black piece that

[00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.710]
bruh.

[00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.750]
We're so obsessed with.

[00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:42.710]
Which one we got a couple.

[00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:45.590]
Oh, the one that's Karan was so obsessed with too.

[00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:46.350]
The one with the handle.

[00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.770]
She fell in love with it.

[00:59:48.770 --> 00:59:50.930]
Yeah, the woman had a big plunger.

[00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:53.870]
348 votes and let's see.

[00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:58.190]
Now the positive ones for you, 122, 187.

[00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.310]
So, in Nevatoria, 161.

[01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:02.610]
You're a little, you're ahead.

[01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:04.210]
You're ahead.

[01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:06.330]
Not by a lot though.

[01:00:06.410 --> 01:00:06.970]
It's nip and tuck.

[01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:07.450]
It's close.

[01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.330]
And of course, the future of George's broadcasting

[01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:12.870]
career as marginal as it is, is hanging on this vote today.

[01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.570]
Absolutely.

[01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.870]
WQYM, hello.

[01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:16.670]
Yeah, Neil, what's going on?

[01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:17.450]
How you doing, sir?

[01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:20.770]
Listen, man, seven out of 10 people believe it's not a per se

[01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:22.490]
and as I'm going to do it in the World Trade Center.

[01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.030]
Right, because the public is stupid.

[01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:27.890]
I read it in either the Washington Post or the New York Times

[01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:29.150]
that I only lived a couple days ago.

[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.990]
Do you have a hint on our website a few days ago, Ryan?

[01:00:32.270 --> 01:00:33.750]
I'm just based on that.

[01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:34.090]
Unbelievable.

[01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:35.530]
Just that alone.

[01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:38.290]
I mean, you've got to pull the metal and your teeth

[01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.070]
to your hair up, man.

[01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:40.190]
It's absolutely insane.

[01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:42.070]
Yeah, I'm spinning my wheels.

[01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.310]
I'm doing a Randy Rhodes.

[01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.610]
Fun.

[01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.830]
They leave a ball.

[01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:46.410]
Right, I mean, I should just be sitting here going.

[01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:47.090]
I'm a little bit like that.

[01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:48.030]
They like that a lot better.

[01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:48.730]
I don't know.

[01:00:48.830 --> 01:00:49.890]
I really don't know what to do, man.

[01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:51.130]
I mean, we're going to move to.

[01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:51.810]
You can't move anywhere.

[01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:53.570]
I think Toronto sounds good.

[01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:55.470]
You have a six-spensive there, though.

[01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:56.230]
No, it's not.

[01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:58.510]
Well, I have a Canadian dollar.

[01:00:58.630 --> 01:01:00.690]
Canadian dollars only worth 73 cent American.

[01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:02.490]
And so it makes it very affordable here.

[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:03.490]
That's not bad.

[01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.450]
All right, we'll take care and keep your head up.

[01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:06.710]
Okay, we're getting you two.

[01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:07.890]
I'm trying to keep my head on it.

[01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:12.390]
Only if they take their hand off the vacuum and you know,

[01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:14.890]
let me kind of steer my own path.

[01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.410]
Algebra errors purported bin Laden tape.

[01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:23.090]
The audio tape says the real battle hasn't started yet.

[01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.530]
On the eve of the second anniversary of 9-11 attacks today,

[01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:29.650]
Arabic language news network Algebra broadcast yesterday.

[01:01:29.850 --> 01:01:30.790]
What it said was that new video.

[01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.430]
Oh, you know what?

[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:32.510]
Other tape they showed yesterday?

[01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:34.030]
If I can interrupt myself now.

[01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:35.570]
Which I loved.

[01:01:35.730 --> 01:01:37.190]
I wish I had taped the audio of that.

[01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:39.650]
God, did you see how the cranking

[01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:41.230]
a rumsfeld in his speech to the press club?

[01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:41.770]
No.

[01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:42.770]
You didn't see that?

[01:01:42.830 --> 01:01:43.050]
No!

[01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:44.390]
Oh, it was green.

[01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:48.390]
There were a couple of young ladies up there with huge protest sign

[01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:51.550]
about the bloodbath in Iraq and about the soldiers that are dying.

[01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.810]
And he's in the middle of his speech and she yells out,

[01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:57.030]
Mr. Rumsfeld, you're fired!

[01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:59.910]
And he looked up all like Starland.

[01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:03.030]
He started going off-man and about you're a butcher and a murderer

[01:02:03.030 --> 01:02:04.750]
and American troops are dying every day.

[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.390]
And this is an illegal war.

[01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:07.490]
It was all based on lies.

[01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:08.950]
And they finally, of course, security.

[01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:09.610]
It took a little while.

[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.570]
They were like upstairs.

[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:13.450]
And the took security about 30 seconds to get up there.

[01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.290]
But yeah, they had a city pulse here in Toronto.

[01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:16.230]
They showed the whole thing.

[01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:18.110]
Oh, you got to just roll a tape.

[01:02:18.110 --> 01:02:18.650]
Just keep going.

[01:02:18.790 --> 01:02:20.950]
I wish I had the audio.

[01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:21.730]
It was fabulous.

[01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.430]
And then, of course, you know, trying to be the wise guy.

[01:02:24.570 --> 01:02:25.530]
He always is the thing.

[01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:28.350]
And she finally gets dragged away and he looks at the president.

[01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:31.530]
Well, well, you know, and just picks up where he left off

[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:32.570]
from the prepared text.

[01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.590]
How witty.

[01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.430]
It was a beautiful performance.

[01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:36.230]
Nice, God, sweetheart.

[01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:37.170]
Whoever the hell you were.

[01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:38.690]
Naturally, they dragged them away.

[01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:40.370]
In typical, fascist fashion,

[01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.290]
just like a scene from the Vietnam era,

[01:02:42.290 --> 01:02:44.550]
the tricky dick all over again, and LVJ.

[01:02:47.490 --> 01:02:49.710]
Anyway, Osama, let me read it again.

[01:02:49.830 --> 01:02:51.690]
I mean, even the second anniversary of the 11 Arabic language

[01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.490]
news network, Al-Jazeera broadcast yesterday,

[01:02:53.630 --> 01:02:55.350]
when it said was a new video type of al-Qaeda leader,

[01:02:55.350 --> 01:02:57.590]
Osama Yomama Bin Laden, and his top yet be in the radio,

[01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:00.530]
voiceovers urging Muslims to interact and devour the Americans.

[01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.430]
They're going to eat us.

[01:03:03.370 --> 01:03:05.130]
In the audio tape accompanying the video, a voice

[01:03:05.130 --> 01:03:07.070]
purported to be that of Bin Laden's chief deputy,

[01:03:07.330 --> 01:03:09.890]
Iman Al-Zawari, warning that the battle with the US

[01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:11.730]
was far from over, and exorted fighters

[01:03:11.730 --> 01:03:14.210]
in Iraq to bury the Americans in the graveyard of Iraq.

[01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.230]
The purported voice of Al-Zawari was also saying

[01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:20.690]
the US is so far experienced, just the first skirmishes,

[01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:23.330]
and has not yet begun to realize the two volume of its casualties.

[01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:26.610]
Those fighters in Iraq, we greet them in salute them,

[01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.810]
and support them and ask God to bless their efforts in their

[01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:30.390]
bravery and fighting crusaders.

[01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.070]
He said, and we tell them God is with you,

[01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:33.430]
and the nation is supporting you,

[01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:35.050]
dependent rely on God and the audio-dead.

[01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.870]
It warned that the real battle hasn't started yet,

[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:39.630]
prepare yourself for the punishment of your crimes,

[01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:41.550]
we recommend to the mothers of the soldiers,

[01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.810]
if you like to see your sons,

[01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:45.070]
then hasten to ask your government to return them,

[01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:46.050]
rather than coming back to you,

[01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:47.550]
and coffins the voice said.

[01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.350]
27 after 11 at 5, 60 WDQM,

working for peanuts for some schmuck-like clearance

[01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:33.510]
at other day.

[01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:34.510]

Hey.

[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:50.490]

[01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:51.130]
H third.

[01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:05.050]
Alternate babies.

[01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.810]
Kidding.

[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:08.810]

[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:08.810]

[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:17.730]
That's not enough, because I'm a virgin wearing a G-Straight baby.

[01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:31.030]
If the world don't know I'll want it to be known, and now I'm hotter than yesterday.

[01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.930]
My body's up, my ground butt's still awake.

[01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:41.590]
I'm fit to know what I'll be here to see next.

[01:05:45.770 --> 01:05:46.570]
I'm hotter.

[01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.710]
All right.

[01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:50.170]
Love a 32 or 560 W here I'm speaking of.

[01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:50.670]
All right.

[01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:52.090]
Get mad at your one at two.

[01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.950]
Whatever the hell time is on.

[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.450]
Two to four.

[01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:57.890]
See I'm back in a time more, I'm forgetting that 9 to 1 that abortion that they had us for a year and a half that they settled us with.

[01:05:57.890 --> 01:06:00.670]
Shame on you Greg, you idiot, you quizzling.

[01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:02.690]
How did you manage to to four?

[01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:06.630]
Hank Goldberg for the 7th and a Humber in the studio, 5 to 6 that Bino for the cook show.

[01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:09.150]
Don't ask me why, but Clarence has a lot of people listen to that.

[01:06:09.570 --> 01:06:09.950]
Do you believe it?

[01:06:10.510 --> 01:06:10.990]
Did he really?

[01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:11.830]
That's what he said.

[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:12.730]
He said they get big numbers.

[01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:14.590]
They've checked out 5 to 6 when Bino was on.

[01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:15.790]
He said, about 3rd man.

[01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:16.650]
People listen to that.

[01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:21.290]
Hercoun hotline from Tony Romas in a Gables, 7 to 9 tonight with Josie and Don Bailey,

[01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:23.690]
Jr. and all those Hercoun silly people, probably the Beast too.

[01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:26.230]
He'll be over there sucking up some free food, fat slob.

[01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:31.310]
9 to 2, a 5 hour show for Eddie Cake as the marlins have a travel day off today before they come up against the braves tomorrow.

[01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:34.290]
Joe and Mark overnight 2 to 5 is a lead-in until you know what, you know.

[01:06:34.350 --> 01:06:34.730]
Absolutely.

[01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:35.750]
The week one.

[01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:41.610]
Tony Faxusen says CNBC reported the Tuesday night that Bruce Bernie Eber's

[01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:44.210]
others who ran World Com are born again Christians.

[01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:45.730]
World Com he writes it.

[01:06:46.070 --> 01:06:47.810]
They thought that God would straighten out their mess.

[01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.730]
Well, how do you like that?

[01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:49.430]
Born again Christian.

[01:06:49.690 --> 01:06:50.450]
Rippin off the public.

[01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:51.430]
What a concept, huh?

[01:06:51.830 --> 01:06:55.130]
I bet the Jimmy Tammy Fair proud and Jimmy Swagrid and Jerry Falwell,

[01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:59.490]
and Charles Keating and all those other four-nie below me and the Pope.

[01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:01.790]
All the other religious fakers.

[01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:05.270]
When is the public going to wake up and I'm sitting here on a sports station in Miami,

[01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:06.530]
Cuking my gut side.

[01:07:06.550 --> 01:07:09.070]
I might as well be talking to the guy at the M. Wall except I'm getting paid a lot of money.

[01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:13.030]
I mean, what's it all about, Alfie?

[01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:14.770]
You know, what is it all about?

[01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:16.610]
And there's Dumbled right there.

[01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:16.950]
Look at that.

[01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:19.230]
There's El Presidente attending church services.

[01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:19.770]
What we do?

[01:07:20.490 --> 01:07:21.370]
I got news for her.

[01:07:21.410 --> 01:07:22.130]
We ain't got a prayer.

[01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:23.150]
Not with him in there.

[01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:28.050]
560-560, pound 560 on the AT&T.

[01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:32.510]
And Verizon World's Thunder doing screenless because Scott's under a lot of pressure

[01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:33.870]
he's having an emotional breakdown.

[01:07:35.030 --> 01:07:38.550]
Trying to find out why Boria Somme and then he gives me crap this morning about the Panthers

[01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:41.130]
are going to do a run-of-standard cup because they signed Joe Newandike.

[01:07:41.450 --> 01:07:42.910]
The Leaf signed Joe Newandike.

[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:44.010]
Okay, silly person.

[01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:45.090]
Silly goose.

[01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:46.230]
I have no right.

[01:07:46.590 --> 01:07:48.070]
No wonder he re-clearance the one who pay it.

[01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.430]
WQAM.

[01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:52.410]
Hello, I like the stage of the meal.

[01:07:52.410 --> 01:07:53.230]
Go ahead.

[01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:54.750]
Hello, Neil.

[01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.530]
Yes, sir.

[01:07:56.190 --> 01:08:02.030]
Listen, I have a prediction about six months or so before the next election.

[01:08:02.410 --> 01:08:02.590]
Yes.

[01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:08.350]
That's where they're going to find Adam Hussein and Ben Laden and maybe even some very

[01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.030]
weapons of mass destruction.

[01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:11.110]
Very treasure, yeah.

[01:08:11.690 --> 01:08:12.850]
Yeah, yeah, like that.

[01:08:13.170 --> 01:08:15.350]
And put his, you know, push to look good.

[01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.590]
It'll be helpful if people would be yes again.

[01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:24.090]
And one other thing for your charity, I got a good thing to connect some money.

[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:24.670]
Okay.

[01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:27.110]
Remember all how-to-duty puppets?

[01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:29.070]
Sure do.

[01:08:29.250 --> 01:08:34.550]
You push the embushes of puppets, you know, make, put some strings on what it owes and make some money.

[01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:37.750]
We're just making a Mr. Bluster with a bush head on it sounds good to me.

[01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:38.570]
Remember Mr. Bluster?

[01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:39.450]
I think I have herpes.

[01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:40.690]
Okay, well just calm down.

[01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.610]
Okay, it's a family show we don't want to talk about it all year.

[01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:44.690]
Especially transmitted diseases, okay?

[01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:45.350]
I think I have herpes.

[01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.690]
Okay.

[01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:48.930]
That's God punishing you for being a Jets fan.

[01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:51.350]
Everybody knows, everybody's on to him.

[01:08:51.450 --> 01:08:54.390]
They know he's the whole family's got the green and white to Jets colors painted on.

[01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.550]
You're full of nobody, Mo.

[01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:56.030]
That's who you're looking for.

[01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.330]
No, Mo.

[01:08:57.610 --> 01:08:59.330]
Now line nine, what do you think that is, Scott?

[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.130]
I just want to see if you're learning anything, line nine.

[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.690]
All right, could be somebody who's not genuine.

[01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:06.250]
You mean like you?

[01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:11.070]
Here's line nine, Scott says you're not genuine.

[01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:11.450]
Hello.

[01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:13.430]
Hey, Neil, how you doing, buddy?

[01:09:13.530 --> 01:09:14.070]
Are you genuine?

[01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.790]
I am for real.

[01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:18.370]
Are you like a real living and breathing caller on line nine?

[01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:19.390]
Let me mark this down.

[01:09:19.390 --> 01:09:20.330]
I'm keeping a diarrhea.

[01:09:20.530 --> 01:09:21.510]
By all means.

[01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:21.950]
Okay.

[01:09:22.210 --> 01:09:22.610]
Indeed.

[01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:27.610]
I'll tell you what, I don't mess with politics or religion, so I have nothing to talk about there.

[01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.250]
What is sex and money, man?

[01:09:29.350 --> 01:09:29.910]
That's where it's at.

[01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.650]
Money and sex.

[01:09:30.650 --> 01:09:31.410]
Sex and money.

[01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:32.490]
That's what you're glanding in.

[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.090]
This has to do with sex.

[01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:36.970]
I actually am getting engaged here soon.

[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.230]
I thought you had good news for us.

[01:09:39.690 --> 01:09:40.250]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:40.790]
Thank you.

[01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:43.970]
I know nobody's for it, but God knows.

[01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:45.170]
You got to do it sooner or later.

[01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:45.530]
Yeah.

[01:09:45.790 --> 01:09:47.450]
I'll lose my dowry.

[01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:51.690]
What happens is the rings are ready today.

[01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:57.130]
I was thinking about doing it tonight and then I realized by listening to you with September 11th.

[01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.670]
Will this be a good or bad thing?

[01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:02.470]
I could make a happy September 11th or something.

[01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:07.310]
I would screw my brains out whether without the rings or what kind of ring you're talking about.

[01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:08.090]
I can't see.

[01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:13.430]
Yeah, I don't know, but it's about 10 grand and I don't want to lose it over the weekend either.

[01:10:14.010 --> 01:10:15.010]
I go for it.

[01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:19.930]
I go for it because the way I go right now, especially with these Nazis in here, you never know whether the weekend is going to be finished or not.

[01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.190]
So just do what I can.

[01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:24.270]
Yeah, Bush is going to bomb us before we say bomb us.

[01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:26.250]
Do it until that thing falls off, man.

[01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.530]
That's my best suggestion for you.

[01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:28.170]
You got it, buddy.

[01:10:28.230 --> 01:10:29.110]
Okay, good luck to you.

[01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:29.450]
Have a good one.

[01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:30.610]
He's plugging it.

[01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:31.670]
He's plugging the gap.

[01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.390]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60.

[01:10:34.390 --> 01:10:36.490]
Seriously, a section money, that's where it's at.

[01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:38.390]
Of course, if you haven't got any money, then what?

[01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.630]
You're me.

[01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:43.230]
Oh, what a concept.

[01:10:43.530 --> 01:10:44.190]
What a concept.

[01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:48.450]
By the way, thanks to Jean for that fact before I'm sorry, you waited half an hour on hold, but it's the way it goes.

[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.470]
I had a lot of important crap.

[01:10:49.770 --> 01:10:52.310]
I'm going to read that Robert Fist article again later in a 1 o'clock hour.

[01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.850]
Don't let me forget.

[01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:58.270]
And I know it's not going to change a damn thing and we will get it on our website, but it will feel good.

[01:10:58.710 --> 01:11:00.290]
It makes us feel like we're doing something.

[01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:05.090]
Just like today's when I did the 7 months without any phone calls and I thought like I was doing something that was a moron and idiot.

[01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:11.350]
See, I think that might have been a format that would have worked like, you know, if we had, if we were on a bunch of stations,

[01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:17.910]
if the show was syndicated, like every other talk show in America, except that I got Norma Kent who's a silly person with his bobble head dolls, who's an overgrown child.

[01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:27.370]
Let's see, here's one that says that Democratic presidential ticket for 2004 should be dean and gram because of the only ones with balls to stick it to Bush.

[01:11:27.370 --> 01:11:29.210]
P.S. It says don't let Donna Shalala hear that.

[01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:31.110]
Yes, she gets upset with years about balls.

[01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:32.230]
She don't like balls.

[01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:36.230]
She likes breasts and things like that.

[01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:37.850]
She said it's breast by test.

[01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:39.570]
Silly as bitch.

[01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:41.290]
Donna Shalala to you of them.

[01:11:41.490 --> 01:11:44.350]
You know, that whole episode is so, it's so unconscionable.

[01:11:44.370 --> 01:11:45.230]
It's so amazing.

[01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:55.070]
So I so unbelievable that the president of the University of Miami raised the stink that we had to take the logo off a couple of billboards because it's a WQM.

[01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:59.350]
We've got balls, which is a line used by every sports station in America.

[01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:00.730]
I mean, you think we got anything original?

[01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:01.430]
Of course not.

[01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.510]
We stole it from all the other guys from some other agency.

[01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:05.550]
And Donna Shalala.

[01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:07.670]
And, Daily, you know, probably busy.

[01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.350]
I would like to be waxing Janet Reno Shalala right now.

[01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:11.890]
She's a makes a big stink about it.

[01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:13.450]
Get our name off the billboard. That's disgusting.

[01:12:14.010 --> 01:12:14.870]
We've got balls.

[01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.530]
That's grotesque.

[01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:17.850]
It's absolutely unbelievable.

[01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:19.730]
She blew nose assholes at the U of M.

[01:12:19.730 --> 01:12:24.190]
They ought to change the colors of U M from orange and whatever the whole of his green.

[01:12:25.150 --> 01:12:28.890]
Just a blue as in blue nose or maybe brown eye or something like that.

[01:12:29.050 --> 01:12:29.770]
What a bunch of pink.

[01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:30.690]
Really, seriously.

[01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:34.190]
Even though I broadcast those baseball games for about a hundred years over there, what?

[01:12:34.410 --> 01:12:35.930]
I learned. I really learned, man.

[01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:37.970]
I got to see the inside of what that place is all about.

[01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:42.730]
The alumni and the blue noses in the, just the whole operation.

[01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:44.150]
You have to make your pick your guts out.

[01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:46.550]
And then they're playing another girl school and football.

[01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:49.770]
The East Carolina State Polytechnic Girl School for the Blind.

[01:12:50.970 --> 01:12:53.150]
A bunch of amputees they're playing this weekend.

[01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:55.250]
What's the, yeah, seriously.

[01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:56.930]
That's the kind of schedule they make up.

[01:12:57.250 --> 01:12:58.390]
Oh, we're number one.

[01:12:58.570 --> 01:12:58.950]
Look at it.

[01:12:59.050 --> 01:13:00.590]
And the town's never going to change.

[01:13:00.610 --> 01:13:01.590]
It's still the same horse wall.

[01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:02.610]
Place it always has been.

[01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:05.270]
I'm going to tell you right now.

[01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:09.070]
And I'm not pretending to be a Marlon's fan or a baseball fan because I'm not.

[01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:09.990]
I could, could cure less.

[01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:12.350]
But the fact that he's guys had done the job that they've done.

[01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:15.650]
And they brought in this 90-year-old manager, Jack McKeon, who's coming here and done a hell of a job.

[01:13:15.650 --> 01:13:20.350]
And they're like 16 games over 500 and they're leading in a wildcard race with only 15 games to go.

[01:13:20.490 --> 01:13:22.690]
The fact that they've done that is a major accomplishment.

[01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:26.970]
And I've got to tell me they're expecting 35,000 games for the Braves, which I hope a lot of those.

[01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:29.450]
And who's more going to be rooting for in those games, by the way.

[01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:32.390]
Mr. Braves fan, which they already basically got the division clinched.

[01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:33.610]
They don't need to win any of those games.

[01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:36.930]
He'd then better be rooting for the Marlins or we're going to root his ass out of town.

[01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:37.450]
That's absolutely.

[01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:38.370]
Toronto, Tonto.

[01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:42.530]
But if there's any empty seats in those games, that's going to be bogus.

[01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:44.050]
It's going to show up the town for what it is.

[01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:45.670]
They'd better be packed to the Raptors.

[01:13:46.690 --> 01:13:47.430]
Am I right?

[01:13:48.610 --> 01:13:50.230]
They better be packed in them in there.

[01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:51.430]
Yeah, screw you, Moe.

[01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:52.490]
You silly old goose.

[01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:56.070]
You nasty rotten, anti-human piece of turd.

[01:13:56.830 --> 01:13:57.270]
God.

[01:13:57.710 --> 01:13:59.730]
How did we ever get saddled with that thing, huh?

[01:14:00.150 --> 01:14:00.610]
Tell us, sir.

[01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:01.690]
We Mr. Weaselhead.

[01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:04.570]
How did George do filling in this summer?

[01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:06.670]
That's our poll question on eorogers.com.

[01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:09.630]
401 votes in an hour in the 20 minutes, George.

[01:14:10.090 --> 01:14:11.490]
We're going at a record pace here.

[01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.450]
Conceivable, we could top 800 votes just during the show today on this poll.

[01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.010]
That's how emotionally they are about you.

[01:14:18.190 --> 01:14:19.130]
That has never happened.

[01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.030]
What?

[01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:21.250]
800 during the show?

[01:14:21.510 --> 01:14:22.650]
I don't think so.

[01:14:22.770 --> 01:14:24.250]
Maybe I may be, but I don't think really.

[01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:24.830]
I don't think really on days.

[01:14:24.990 --> 01:14:25.590]
I don't believe so.

[01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.690]
Is that?

[01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:27.530]
Thank you, everybody.

[01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:28.110]
Yeah, see.

[01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:29.670]
401 votes.

[01:14:29.670 --> 01:14:30.490]
How many tours do you fill in?

[01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.090]
Okay, I listen to 133.

[01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:34.310]
Like I said, it just changed again.

[01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:37.130]
Out of 404.

[01:14:38.650 --> 01:14:39.370]
3 Moe.

[01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.090]
Awful.

[01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:40.830]
I stop listening.

[01:14:41.590 --> 01:14:41.990]
99.

[01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.130]
Week.

[01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:44.330]
I wear a listen 84.

[01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:45.390]
Great job.

[01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.990]
The best ever.

[01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:47.070]
76.

[01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:48.510]
And fabulous.

[01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.110]
It's time for Neil to retire.

[01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:50.890]
12.

[01:14:51.490 --> 01:14:52.970]
2.9% want me to retire.

[01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.690]
Okay, no problem.

[01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.570]
See, I'm figuring 150,000 listeners at 10 bucks a piece is a million and a half.

[01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:02.650]
So if you least contribute 10 bucks a piece tax-free is, you know, no problem for the rest of my life.

[01:15:03.930 --> 01:15:04.330]
See?

[01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:04.670]
Okay.

[01:15:05.110 --> 01:15:05.790]
I'm telling you.

[01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:06.790]
I'll share.

[01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:08.770]
I'll even share some of that since it's tax-free.

[01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:11.010]
Few thousand.

[01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:12.030]
530, man.

[01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:12.310]
Yeah.

[01:15:12.490 --> 01:15:13.130]
I'll keep you alive.

[01:15:13.130 --> 01:15:14.450]
And maybe a few bucks for Scott too.

[01:15:14.550 --> 01:15:14.890]
How many bucks?

[01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:15.910]
530, man.

[01:15:16.090 --> 01:15:16.290]
Yeah.

[01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:17.630]
Which is more than he's making now.

[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:17.990]
Yeah.

[01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.570]
I agree.

[01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:20.290]
It's 30 more than he's making now.

[01:15:20.370 --> 01:15:21.530]
Thanks to the clearance being in there.

[01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:23.990]
Hey, clearance, you know, you're put on a good act, but we know you're a plus.

[01:15:24.710 --> 01:15:26.990]
That's why that's why every and what was it?

[01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.790]
It was 34C.

[01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:28.930]
It was for Relsa Grophane.

[01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:30.330]
He tried like put his hand up her leg.

[01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:31.130]
Who are you?

[01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:31.710]
Talk to her.

[01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:33.170]
He really did that?

[01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:35.590]
That's what the story says.

[01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:36.030]
Yeah.

[01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:38.210]
Now, it has slacked his ass down so fast.

[01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.370]
Get your hands off the merchandise.

[01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:40.410]
You little quizzling.

[01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:41.210]
You little fairy.

[01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:41.970]
God.

[01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:43.090]
Who are you?

[01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:43.470]
Kidding.

[01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:46.190]
You know, it's one thing about being in the Appedis position.

[01:15:46.370 --> 01:15:46.690]
Accumulate.

[01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:47.950]
So we had Andrew Asson woods.

[01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:49.250]
We had Muff.

[01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:50.210]
And now we have clearance.

[01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:51.750]
You see a pattern developing here?

[01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.450]
No.

[01:15:53.770 --> 01:15:57.990]
When the time comes to have your carpets cleaned, you can go on open the yellow pages and take Russian

[01:15:57.990 --> 01:16:00.010]
Relent, you know, play all kinds of games and get ripped off.

[01:16:00.130 --> 01:16:02.330]
Or you can do the smart thing like I've done to my house for over 20 years.

[01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:04.470]
Call the best people in the universe, drive concepts.

[01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:05.270]
They are sensational.

[01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:06.350]
They are fabulous.

[01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:09.670]
What a great job they do for me, including I think about a month ago it was there.

[01:16:10.290 --> 01:16:12.750]
And when I got home, I took a look around and I said, no problem.

[01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.330]
Same beautiful job they always do.

[01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:17.690]
Your carpets look and feel and smell just like brand new at a fraction of the course of the

[01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:17.970]
cost.

[01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:20.710]
They give you a written guaranteed price before they start the job.

[01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:22.410]
Soon I have to worry about getting ripped off.

[01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:26.710]
Drive concepts is offering you a chance here during these final days of summer to say 15%

[01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:28.410]
extra on your next carpet cleaning.

[01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:30.810]
Just call the ride concepts at the usual toll free number.

[01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:35.250]
1-800-248-5071 has to be put on their stand violinist.

[01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:38.390]
Then ride concepts will call you and extend it got an opening in your schedule.

[01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:42.990]
Just like when you fly stand by if you're available and they have an opening, they'll knock 15% off the price.

[01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:45.890]
So called ride concepts today has to be put on that stand violinist.

[01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:48.390]
They might even have an opening for you the day you call, like today perhaps.

[01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.690]
And they give you 15% off the price of the job.

[01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:53.570]
And I guarantee you'll be amazed if you ever use these folks before.

[01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:55.470]
How stupid is your carpets will look?

[01:16:55.670 --> 01:16:56.950]
They'll be drying a couple of hours.

[01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.810]
They'll smell a mini fresh.

[01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:00.910]
And like I said, look like they had brand new lead right there on the floor.

[01:17:01.170 --> 01:17:05.230]
Call toll free 1-800-248-5071 or check out the price.

[01:17:05.230 --> 01:17:08.110]
Click on the worldwide wicked web at dryconcepts.com.

[01:17:08.130 --> 01:17:14.110]
Live live local, your sports radio five 60s, you and you AM.

[01:17:19.230 --> 01:17:32.950]
Brave young men who shave their chest, spray 3M to mouth-fake breasts, trim their nuts with burning pain.

[01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:42.950]
So they can be queen for a day with weak plates upon their head.

[01:17:43.630 --> 01:17:47.950]
Smooth nylon lace and a slutty dress.

[01:17:48.710 --> 01:17:49.110]
All right.

[01:17:49.230 --> 01:17:55.690]
Who got their cheeks and bodies gray now they're ready to play.

[01:17:55.690 --> 01:18:03.310]
We've got a day, some link out in five and a month.

[01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:18.310]
Who go hobbling about the clothes in the home of getting laid so they can feel like we've got a day.

[01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:25.990]
Meeting friends at the cabaret or the duty garland.

[01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:27.310]
The ones can have a day.

[01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.910]
The cabaret is spent like this.

[01:18:32.210 --> 01:18:36.370]
So fan and day holding on the stage.

[01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:38.410]
We tore a day.

[01:18:38.890 --> 01:18:39.130]
Okay.

[01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:43.650]
And counter five of trunks for a fan.

[01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:49.210]
Who said, hey, baby, I want to be your man.

[01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:53.570]
Perhaps a club, but people don't play.

[01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:56.150]
It's a take-you-take.

[01:18:56.870 --> 01:18:59.330]
I'll be the queen for a day.

[01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:10.830]
Okay.

[01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:11.650]
It's 11 till noon.

[01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:12.790]
It's not required.

[01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:14.190]
It's a rhetorical question.

[01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:15.470]
11 till noon at 5.60.

[01:19:15.610 --> 01:19:18.310]
And I was always talking about the old people in the bad driving.

[01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:19.030]
Yeah.

[01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:22.730]
Making drive-throughs driving into buildings and pizza shops.

[01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:24.750]
Well, we're trying to even out a little bit.

[01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:25.430]
Change of demographic.

[01:19:26.250 --> 01:19:28.050]
Palm Beach Post reports this from Tampa.

[01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:35.190]
Authority set a toddler slipped out of his mother's lock motel room, climbed into his family's car, and accidentally drove it through the room's door and window.

[01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:40.850]
Rex Davis, too, was not injured in the accident yesterday morning.

[01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:47.410]
The Holtbrook County Sheriff's Office said his mother, Gina Hopkins, was taking a shower at the red roof in when Rex left the room.

[01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:50.290]
It's almost unbelievable that a two-year-old could have done that.

[01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:55.610]
Said Holtbrook County Sheriff's Lieutenant Rod Reader, one detective dubbed him Little Houdini after the accident.

[01:19:56.610 --> 01:20:02.750]
Reader said while Rex's mother was showering, the youngster managed to get the car keys, unlocked the motel room door, go outside, enter the unlocked car.

[01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:07.450]
Once he started the manual transmission vehicle, this is a real story.

[01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:07.770]

[01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:08.630]
Huh?

[01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:09.670]
It was a manual.

[01:20:10.290 --> 01:20:11.130]
Oh, that was the problem.

[01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:12.610]
Maybe he read about it in the manual.

[01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:13.570]
That's even tougher.

[01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:16.130]
No, you have to start on the manual transmission vehicle.

[01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:21.990]
It lurched forward about eight feet, crashing through the door and window over 133 Reader said Hopkins had left the car in first gear.

[01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:24.410]
Reader said nobody was in the room at the time.

[01:20:24.430 --> 01:20:28.230]
No one was hurt. Reader said a motel employee saw Rex timing out of the passenger side of the car.

[01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:34.110]
The accident caused about two granted damage to the motel, Reader said Hopkins declined comment.

[01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:39.690]
Kelly Johnson spoke to one of the Dallas-based Red Roof in chains and motel officials won't investigate the accident.

[01:20:40.070 --> 01:20:42.510]
Decided whether anybody should be reliable for monetary damages.

[01:20:42.930 --> 01:20:45.270]
Right now we're just thankful nobody was hurt. Johnson be saying.

[01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:46.730]
She said watch out for your Johnson.

[01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:49.510]
The child was well cared for.

[01:20:49.630 --> 01:20:51.790]
The door was locked and the mother has to take a shower sometimes.

[01:20:51.790 --> 01:20:55.190]
She said she did everything right. She just has a very percussive child.

[01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.450]
Two years old.

[01:20:57.450 --> 01:20:59.090]
Can you imagine by the time he's about ten?

[01:20:59.290 --> 01:20:59.690]
What a talent.

[01:21:00.010 --> 01:21:02.550]
He'll be stealing Janet. We know as a Mac truck.

[01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:05.630]
A little rent truck. Poor Janet.

[01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:08.010]
Poor Miss understood Janet.

[01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:11.390]
By the way, Eric is the best. He continues to amaze and astonish me.

[01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:14.910]
I just checked our website. The Robert Fist story is already up on there.

[01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.830]
All right.

[01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:18.490]
How do you like that? It's the lead story on theoranges.com.

[01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.650]
Folly taken to a scale we haven't seen since WWII.

[01:21:22.370 --> 01:21:24.850]
I mean he lays her right out there for it. It doesn't pull any punches.

[01:21:24.850 --> 01:21:28.230]
It's right there for you. I'm going to read it again in the one to two hour.

[01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:28.710]
Excellent.

[01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.910]
So sick and tired of all this propaganda.

[01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:33.530]
They certainly not news network.

[01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:38.170]
An MSNBC with her flags and her pom-poms and the pictures on the wall

[01:21:38.170 --> 01:21:41.790]
and his glorious operation Iraqi freedom and all the other bullcrap.

[01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:44.190]
Stop the lies already. You people in the meeting make me sick.

[01:21:45.710 --> 01:21:47.170]
Make me sick to my stomach.

[01:21:49.410 --> 01:21:51.090]
Dean takes slightly naive a pull.

[01:21:51.170 --> 01:21:52.810]
Shall I come down a little bit? I think just a little.

[01:21:52.810 --> 01:22:17.530]

with or without his tits and 2% Ohio representative Dennis Kassinich. Florida Senator Bob Graham,

[01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:55.850]
Carol Mosley Brown and retired General Wesley Clark each had 1%, Clark's expected to decide soon

[01:22:55.850 --> 01:23:00.550]
whether he'll enter the race and I don't see a desogny polite I want to go through the other numbers.

[01:23:00.930 --> 01:23:05.950]
Speaking of Wesley Clark here's the interesting part okay for anybody who might care. Democratic

[01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:10.170]
presidential candidate Howard Dean is an astronaut Army General Wesley Clark to join his campaign

[01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:13.690]
if the former native commander does not jump into the race himself next week and the two men

[01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:17.350]
discussed the vice presidency at a weekend meeting in California the sources from anywhere

[01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:20.630]
the discussion said. Clark and a telephone interview yesterday

[01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:24.110]
he didn't want to comment about the private meeting asked about reports that the two men

[01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:27.030]
have discussed the wide range of issues including endorsing Dean joining the campaign

[01:23:27.030 --> 01:23:31.190]
possible roles in the administration of his presidency said only it was a complete tour of the

[01:23:31.190 --> 01:23:37.310]
horizon. Later in advisory advisor quoted Clark is saying I have only one decision to make

[01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:41.290]
while I seek the presidency I think that ticket can't lose Howard Dean Wesley Clark.

[01:23:42.010 --> 01:23:45.230]
Leslie after Wesley Clark was so strong I meet the press several weeks ago because if you're

[01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:49.090]
strong I meet the press you know I'm saying did you see that show that meet the presser

[01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:53.710]
looks red and pasty and Irish which he is he's red and pasty and Irish Tim Russell makes me ill.

[01:23:54.130 --> 01:23:57.590]
So there you go there's the possibility there's a new president president Dean

[01:23:58.870 --> 01:24:05.370]
no kind of Jimmy Dean or Timmy Dean or even dizzy Dean. This is very disturbing the story from

[01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:09.230]
ABC and let me say it again on the day when everybody's like waving a flags and we're hearing

[01:24:09.230 --> 01:24:13.730]
all the names red you know that's all well and good you know we're big on ceremonies on ceremonial

[01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:19.330]
crap but in the meantime how about taking care of business right yeah that's what we ought to be

[01:24:19.330 --> 01:24:22.430]
doing with all that money that we're wasting over there in Iraq and that guy that was fumping and

[01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:26.470]
stumbling around that call me earlier try well I knew you believe some of the stuff you read yeah

[01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:30.590]
no I read it because I don't believe it okay because I'm a fantasist like it says in there how can

[01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:37.410]
you only read stuff you agree with yeah oh that's cute and work hard tunes from our friend there

[01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:43.770]
just calm down Gene here's the facts that says from Josh says the thing that really frosts my ass

[01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:47.730]
and I can't recall anyone else being this up is the fact that Bush is using these tax cuts to pay

[01:24:47.730 --> 01:24:51.790]
for his reelection bid the economy is in the crapper and this douchebag thing he's going to

[01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:55.530]
stimulate it by giving rich bastards who spend as much money as they already want more money

[01:24:56.010 --> 01:25:00.290]
unlike Bush Karl Roe was no moron he knows that those rich bastards are going to donate a good

[01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:04.010]
portion of their booty in other words tax cut right back to George's reelection campaign in other

[01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:08.350]
words he's siphoning it back into his own ass that's right he's literally putting it his reelection

[01:25:08.350 --> 01:25:14.510]
campaign on the national credit card like I said Josh says frost my ass and then it says no

[01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:20.170]
George you cannot frost nor eat my ass no worries no worries Josh as far as Georgia summer

[01:25:20.170 --> 01:25:27.910]

[01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:33.230]
okay better than tapes bigger as in bigger not bad most of the time I enjoy listening to him his

[01:25:33.230 --> 01:25:37.370]
best day was the one where he was refusing to shout some QA M dirt and one of the colors

[01:25:37.370 --> 01:25:40.810]

whatever that mean what was that all about I forgot what it was about but I wasn't going to say

[01:25:45.210 --> 01:25:49.010]
anything because I was afraid someone might get pissed off and then it occurred to me that I'm

[01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:53.370]
going to be fired to be in your contract anyway so who cares yeah but in the meantime we got

breach question mark as customs fails to detect depleted uranium again for a second year U.S.

[01:31:13.690 --> 01:31:16.850]
government screeners have failed to detect the shipment of depleted uranium in a container sent

[01:31:16.850 --> 01:31:22.410]
by ABC News from overseas is part of a test of security at American ports did they pass the test

[01:31:22.410 --> 01:31:29.490]
I think this is a case in point which established the soft underbelly of national security

[01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:34.730]
and homeland defense in the U.S. said Senator Diane fine-stine a California California who's been

[01:31:34.730 --> 01:31:39.430]
urging the Bush administration to do more to enhance port security the ABC News test was

[01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:43.150]
criticized by officials at the Department of Homeland Security who assigned agents in at least

[01:31:43.150 --> 01:31:48.770]
four cities to investigate ABC personnel and news sources involved I think you're a news reporter

[01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:53.210]
who's trying to carry out a hoax on our inspectors homeland security assistant secretary asshole

[01:31:53.210 --> 01:31:57.770]
Hutchins until Brian Ross ABC News is chief investigative correspondent for report to be broadcast

[01:31:57.770 --> 01:32:03.670]
today on world news tonight and prime time Thursday the ABC News project involves shipment of

[01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:08.670]
two Los Angeles of just under 15 pounds of depleted uranium a harmless substance that's

[01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:13.790]
that's legal of important to the U.S. uranium in a steel pipe with a lead lining was placed in

[01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:18.510]
a suitcase for the shipment if they can't detect that then they can't detect the real thing

[01:32:18.510 --> 01:32:23.230]
explained Tom Cochran a nuclear physicist at the National Resources Defense Council which lent

[01:32:23.230 --> 01:32:28.730]
the material ABC News for the project Cochran said the highly enriched uranium youth for nuclear

[01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:32.890]
weapons would with slightly thicker shielding give off a signature similar to depleted uranium

[01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:36.670]
in the screening devices currently being used by homeland security officials at American ports

[01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:42.550]
the ABC News suitcase containing the uranium was placed in a teak trunk along with other furniture

[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:47.150]
put in a container in Jakarta Indonesia a city considered by U.S. authorities to be one of the

[01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:51.270]
most active al-Qaeda hot spots in the world the container was shipped to LA and late July just

[01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:57.190]
a week before the bombing of Jakarta Mary out hotel to kill from people homeland security secretary

[01:32:57.190 --> 01:33:02.190]
Tom Ridgis they major improvements in port security in per apart because of enhanced vigilance overseas

[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:06.070]
so that our borders become the last line of defense that our first line of defense for its

[01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:09.810]
seventh speech last week he said the U.S. was increasing security thousands of miles away

[01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:15.830]
long before a container is first loaded on a ship but in Jakarta ABC News producers David Scott

[01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:22.310]
and Rhonda Schwartz found that the chest in which they had placed the depleted uranium was never

[01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:27.910]
open to respected before being sent on the LA how do you like that I took us only a few days to find

[01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:31.770]
a ship or willing to send a container to America with almost no questions asked said Scott

[01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:35.650]
we didn't tell a company about the depleted uranium said Schwartz and they never asked

[01:33:35.650 --> 01:33:40.730]
don't ask we won't tell the shipping was handled by Merst logistics part of the giant

[01:33:40.730 --> 01:33:46.590]
Merst shipping company based in Copenhagen ever been in Copenhagen no I love Copenhagen

[01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:51.890]
to finish a Merst company officials say the procedures do not require the

[01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:55.430]
agents to inspect containers loaded outside of the pure area Merst provided what it calls

[01:33:55.430 --> 01:33:59.810]
door to door service which allowed the container to be loaded in a furniture store we rely on

[01:33:59.810 --> 01:34:03.610]
screening government authorities to validate shipping content say Merst security official John

[01:34:03.610 --> 01:34:08.070]
Hyde in a statement Merst said the ABC News findings had caused it to investigate and review

[01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:13.870]
its procedures overseas thank the Lord thank you God any important deviations from formal

[01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:17.870]
procedures will be rectified immediately the statement said furthermore security procedures

[01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:21.690]
will be reviewed again in order to evaluate with any other adjustments could be because they got

[01:34:21.690 --> 01:34:26.970]
egg on their post they're embarrassed okay this is the kind of security we got and we're spending

[01:34:26.970 --> 01:34:32.690]

[01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:34.190]
us anything except early bird dinners and freebies but also for little George there's that fat

[01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:46.370]
by the way in case you're curious Americans are flying today at slightly lower than usual numbers but

[01:42:46.370 --> 01:42:53.670]
not like any gigantic drop off okay okay I'm just passing that line it was just on the blurb

[01:42:53.670 --> 01:42:57.030]
there on the bottom of the screen which is where we're supposed to be fixated you know to see oh

[01:42:57.030 --> 01:43:03.270]
and also they're warning that there may be because of the tape the Osama Imamate and the coincide

[01:43:03.270 --> 01:43:07.830]
of the 9-11 anniversary there may be a taxi against US interest abroad the only thing I'm thinking

[01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:13.690]
it was like in Europe on the in Britain now it's like 520 in the afternoon on the main land at 620

[01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:22.970]
and of course in Asia it's just even later than that to what I'm saying so I'm not saying that it

[01:43:22.970 --> 01:43:26.470]
can't happen but it's getting a little late it's if the day is getting a little better hurry

[01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:30.830]

[01:43:54.490 --> 01:43:58.410]
morning you know you get in your day to with the whole American flag stickers and everything and

[01:43:58.410 --> 01:44:03.370]
it's just kind of interesting to me that I mean I know I'm pretty sure to acquire but you get this

[01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:08.990]
we will never forget or remembering in the question I have for everybody what are you remembering because

[01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:15.450]
nothing has changed this has happened right and today I mean I probably look like a schmuck but

[01:44:15.450 --> 01:44:21.870]
I took a plane to you shirt I just wrote on it and you know 9-11-2 years later no answer no justice

[01:44:22.430 --> 01:44:29.890]
no weapons of mass destruction no Osama wake up American and peach bush oh right excellent I love it

[01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:33.970]
you know I mean I might I might look like a schmuck but I'm serious nobody's asking the questions

[01:44:33.970 --> 01:44:37.990]
and you know what I'm I'm I'm turning blue in the face and he just says something really

[01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:41.790]
interesting about the times on differences and we're worried about American interests abroad

[01:44:41.790 --> 01:44:47.950]
there's a thing that we kind of slap into into the media real quietly and happens in every aspect

[01:44:47.950 --> 01:44:52.410]
is that we're shifting the world like the United States is the world and the United States is not the

[01:44:52.410 --> 01:44:56.810]
world and we do that it's 9-11 over here and it's 12 o'clock in the afternoon that means it's 12

[01:44:56.810 --> 01:45:01.150]
o'clock in the afternoon everywhere it's not yeah well you remember most of the American people are

[01:45:01.150 --> 01:45:05.930]
very myopic they live in this little this tiny little existence of theirs and most of them don't

[01:45:05.930 --> 01:45:09.810]
even really know forget about going other places they don't even know where to find them on the map

[01:45:09.810 --> 01:45:14.550]
you know it's I like I said I just want to let you know that you know there are a few rational people

[01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:18.830]
out there and and I don't care if I look stupid or people want to come my head up but hopefully

[01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:22.710]
just one person understands that or at least we'll just get upset about something that you might

[01:45:22.710 --> 01:45:28.990]
say at least investigate it themselves the answers are out there and you know what a year ago I

[01:45:28.990 --> 01:45:32.990]
thought there was no way that Bush is going to lose this election and I'm honed out hope it might

[01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:38.070]
happen I think it's looking really strong man I mean as long as he's con we keep on taking the

[01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:41.730]
dump like it is we might have a chance because you know the bottom line is still money not

[01:45:41.730 --> 01:45:47.130]
right good job pal keep it up bye bye thanks there you go see we got some really good calls

[01:45:47.130 --> 01:45:50.850]
last couple of days I was great I like that I liked it a lot because there are people out there

[01:45:50.850 --> 01:45:54.310]
with an RQ larger than their kneecap and they go they're thinking they realize they're not

[01:45:54.310 --> 01:46:01.290]
fooling everybody and the poll numbers continue dropping like a rock like a rack oh no seriously it's

[01:46:01.290 --> 01:46:06.690]
it's just you can fool people for so long but when you come when you concoct this whole scenario

[01:46:06.690 --> 01:46:12.450]
all based on a pack of lies and it can be so easily shown that it was all bull crap and here's

[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:16.990]
colon power you know the highly respected colon power with his very light complex you know sitting

[01:46:16.990 --> 01:46:20.750]

this morning they're all waving a flags they got the ceremonies and the kids are deciding the names

[01:47:31.610 --> 01:47:36.690]
but it's just another you know another exercise in being a sheep being a professional sheep

[01:47:38.170 --> 01:47:42.730]
and you got a small percentage of the public about 30 man a lot less than that you realize that

[01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:49.570]
only like 23% of the American people who got a passport no no no no no no one I you know it

[01:47:50.010 --> 01:47:54.330]
less than a quarter of the people in this country in America see I keep saying this country

[01:47:54.330 --> 01:48:01.050]
excuse me I have got a passport which means that 77% don't go nowhere you know their idea like in

[01:48:01.050 --> 01:48:06.070]
South Florida I mean if we go to Port Saint Lucie oh man that's a big outing that's a heavy duty trip

[01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:21.910]
immediate how continues perpetuating it what do you think they were talking about on crossfire

[01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:26.810]
yesterday which I watched about 10 minutes of and I don't know why you know the Democratic debate

[01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:42.890]
Carlson with a stupid ass bow time at baggy look on his post and he's going on what about your

[01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:49.030]
and then he's telling about how he's a big jury what's your call grateful dead fan Garcia

[01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:53.330]
if he would have said cherry Garcia and I'd say hey at least he's got some good taste

[01:48:53.330 --> 01:48:59.850]
but in juries the jury Garcia that's taste and then there's a little B.D.

[01:48:59.950 --> 01:49:04.110]
odd Bobby Graham talking about Jimmy Buffett at that point I said well no wonder he's got 1%

2nd anniversary of 911

[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.180]
they're all pontificating all the networks

[02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:39.260]
all the talking ads but it

[02:02:39.260 --> 02:02:40.680]
but it won't put all the stuff

[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:43.440]
581 votes before one o'clock we're

[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.040]
gonna have over 600 dj it's scary

[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:45.400]
yeah

[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:46.540]
it's a scary

[02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:49.660]
here's the fact from oskey and homestead

[02:02:50.200 --> 02:02:53.040]
says enjoying your show while packing gold fish for a shipment

[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:54.820]
i'd like you in the list to know that the only way

[02:02:54.820 --> 02:02:56.620]
can ship anything in the airplane cargo

[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.800]
or pass your planes to be a known shipper

[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:02.380]
this isn't that what Reagan said when one for the shipper

[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:06.920]
this means an airline rep or freight sales manager has to physically

[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.440]
and personally come and visit your place of

[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.800]
business and take that all put in information about you

[02:03:10.800 --> 02:03:13.340]
once satisfied you're a legitimate shipper with roots of warehouse or

[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:15.580]
place of business at which you ship slash receive etc

[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:18.040]
you're certified as a security or pal number

[02:03:19.140 --> 02:03:20.100]
hi pali

[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:24.280]
supposedly once one airline certifies you you're in a database but

[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:27.200]
every airline is to visit you on their own time and convenience

[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:30.560]
or your stuff isn't going to get on board except the course for those

[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:33.720]
hand grenades and american airlines overheads

[02:03:33.720 --> 02:03:37.200]
the acceptance smaller lines were either too lazy or disinterested in visiting

[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:40.520]
you occasional shipments not enough volume in which case you must bring your

[02:03:40.520 --> 02:03:42.940]
boxes to them open so they can physically inspect the

[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:45.260]
contents and at their mercy except the shipment

[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:48.380]
some airlines charge 20 bucks per set inspections others nothing

[02:03:48.380 --> 02:03:50.600]
occasionally even as an own shipper the goods are

[02:03:51.180 --> 02:03:54.580]
most airlines also use x-rays on top of everything else this guy who

[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:56.760]
shipped himself in a crate must have used some pal's number

[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:01.200]
maybe had a pal right there's simply no failsafe method and being an own

[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:04.160]
shippers about a safe as it gets no this though airlines that do not

[02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.260]
comply subject to very heavy fines for each

[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:09.660]
infraction by the fAA glad you're enjoying the Toronto with this and plus i'm

[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:12.820]

[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:36.240]

[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:39.400]
safer than during the Cuban missile crisis when cashier at ICBMs pointed

[02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.800]
our way safer than a draft age male during vietnam

[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:46.320]
safer than when Nixon ruled question mark franken melbourne says i feel safe

[02:04:46.320 --> 02:04:49.400]

ranger houston used to work at pompino park he better start writing all

these things down take notes an ex chronic in deer field faxes as i have what i

[02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:16.060]
feel are some non mainstream radical ideas about the nine-legged incident

[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:19.420]
and the concept of memorializing the events is a patriotic display to be

[02:06:19.420 --> 02:06:23.180]
carried out by the blind faith public remember the alamo remember the main

[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:25.900]
remember pearl harbor remember the world trade center it seems that the war

[02:06:25.900 --> 02:06:29.680]
lords never tire of the same tactic and never hesitate to recycle the propaganda

[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:33.240]
yes i'm believing the existence of conspiracies and we're like to throw nine

[02:06:33.240 --> 02:06:37.220]
eleven on top of the pile i can't remember when or why the label conspiracy

[02:06:37.220 --> 02:06:41.940]
theorist became synonymous with raving lunatic as an avid reader of non-revisionist

[02:06:41.940 --> 02:06:44.980]
history our long go came to the conclusion that there are very few

[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:49.220]
coincidental natural events there always seems to be a guiding hand to

[02:06:49.220 --> 02:06:53.200]
persuade the events much like hurting the sheep to market two years after

[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:56.300]
the cataclysmic events of nine eleven the deceit has become the greatest

[02:06:56.300 --> 02:06:59.660]
perpetration of license the political assassination of the sixties never

[02:06:59.660 --> 02:07:03.560]
underestimate these stupidity of the american mainstream absolutely correct

[02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:06.800]

[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:38.460]
hell when and she left when she should the night that Gary can't to give it to her but good

[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:51.040]
they were out on a date parking Gary star maybe Gary had gone just a little too far he showed up

[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:59.440]
the motor turned her her and said how about it baby i could use me some dead maybe that young

[02:13:59.440 --> 02:14:06.140]
intern thought that that wasn't right but the cocktails in their system made them feel so

[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:15.140]
like she'll try for a moment and said you're low class that maybe true said Gary but I still want

[02:14:15.140 --> 02:14:28.540]
you're real spectrum over where can that show to be she ain't been heard or seen for so many weeks

[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:36.160]
if she's gone too heaven then she left when she should the night that Gary can't to give it to her

[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:45.120]
but good squirt squirt when he woke up the next morning some troubles not around

[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:53.020]
though Gary had noticed his pants were still down he remembered her points into her hard

[02:14:53.980 --> 02:15:02.560]
yes Gary finally got bored he wanted last night she had opened the door winked at him and said

[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:10.980]
all we back in just a little bit to a while then she took off after he blew her a kiss

[02:15:10.980 --> 02:15:18.060]
and no one including Gary has seen her since well the fact is she's gone these facts made

[02:15:18.060 --> 02:15:24.660]
not be right if somebody knows the truth well then the truth will be night

[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:29.960]
I want to give you a kiss 103 at 560 Joe Rose for the Ahmad Dogga to this afternoon

[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:35.740]

[02:15:36.300 --> 02:15:39.400]
how did George do this summer filling in okay I listened to it at 11

[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:51.660]
awful I stopped listing 143 149 George week I rarely listen to 125 great job best ever 113 and fabulous time

[02:15:51.660 --> 02:16:00.280]

[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:04.600]
didn't think it was when you said it earlier we got a shot you get on their vote okay right now

[02:16:04.600 --> 02:16:08.260]
that's not a request it's a demand okay I'm going to go to the white man from your comment deer

[02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:14.160]
and I got bad news for Eric though his intentions were great he did the best he could he put the

[02:16:14.160 --> 02:16:16.900]
link to the Robert Fist story the only problem is that when you click on the link

[02:16:16.900 --> 02:16:21.560]
it goes back to the same thing with the UK independent where you like to subscribe to read the whole

[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:27.800]
article you you get the blurb part of it yeah so I think probably is my duty on my civic duty on

[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.140]
this second anniversary of 911 I am going to read the Robert Fist article again

[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:35.100]
from today's UK independent how do you like that all right

[02:16:36.520 --> 02:16:40.340]
Robert Fist writes when the attacks were launched against the World Trade Center in the Pentagon

[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:45.100]
two years ago today who had ever heard of Fallujah or Hila when the Lebanese hijacker flew his

[02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:48.400]
plane out of the ground in Pennsylvania who would have ever believed that President George Bush

[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:52.180]
would be announcing a new front line in the war on terror as his troops embarked in a hopeless

[02:16:52.180 --> 02:16:56.720]
campaign against the guerrillas of Iraq who could have ever conceived of American president

[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:00.560]
calling the world to arms against terrorism in Afghanistan Iraq and Gaza

[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.800]
Gaza what do the miserable crust cruelly imprisoned Palestinians of Gaza have to do with the

[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:10.000]
international crimes against humanity in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania nothing of course

[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.180]
either does Iraq have anything to do with 11 September nor were there any weapons of mass

[02:17:14.180 --> 02:17:18.960]
destruction in Iraq any El Qaeda links with Iraq any 45 minute timeline for the deployment

[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.760]
of chemical weapons nor were there any liberation know the attacks on 11 September I have nothing

[02:17:24.760 --> 02:17:29.340]
to do with Iraq neither did 11 September change the world president Bush cruelly manipulated the

[02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:33.100]
grief of the American people and the sympathy of the rest of the world to introduce a world order

[02:17:33.100 --> 02:17:39.020]
dreamed of by a clutch of fantasists advising the secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld the Iraqi

[02:17:39.020 --> 02:17:43.180]
regime change as we now know as planned as part of a Pearl Wolfowitz campaign document

[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:47.540]
to the would be Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu years before Bush came to power

[02:17:47.540 --> 02:17:52.080]
it beggars believe that Tony Blair should have signed up for this nonsense without realizing that

[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:56.420]
it was no more nor less than a project invented by a group of pro-Israeli American neo-conservators

[02:17:56.420 --> 02:18:01.980]
and right wing Christian fundamentalists but even now we're fed more fantasy at Afghanistan it's

[02:18:01.980 --> 02:18:05.900]
American paid warlords raping and murdering their enemies its women still shrouded for the most

[02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:10.200]
part of their burkas it's open production now back as the world's number one export market and

[02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:14.040]
its people being killed it up to a hundred a week five American troops were shot dead two weekends

[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:20.040]
ago is a success something which messes Bush and Rumsfeld still boast about Iraq a midden of

[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:24.980]
guerrilla hatred and pocket of resentment is also a success yes Bush wants eighty seven billion

[02:18:24.980 --> 02:18:28.520]
dollars to keep Iraq running he wants to go back to the same united nations he condemned

[02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:32.940]
as a talking shop last year he wants scores of foreign armies to go into a rack to share the

[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:37.100]
burdens of occupation though not of course the decision making which must remain Washington's

[02:18:37.100 --> 02:18:42.220]
exclusive imperial preserved what's more the world is supposed to accept the insane notion that

[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:47.200]
the Israeli Palestinian conflict the planets last colonial war although all mentioned the illegal

[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:50.560]
Jewish colonies in the West Bank and Gaza been erased in the Middle East narrative in the American

[02:18:50.560 --> 02:18:55.580]
press is part of the war on terror the cosmic clansher religious will that President Bush invented

[02:18:55.580 --> 02:19:00.180]
after 911 could Israel's interests be better served by so infantile gesture from Bush

[02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:06.220]
the vicious Palestinian suicide bombers and the grotesque implantation of Jews and Jews only

[02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:10.800]
in the colonies has now been said in this colossal struggle of good against evil in which even

[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.600]
aerial shiron named as personally responsible for the 1982 Sabra and Shatilla massacre by Israel's

[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:22.220]
own commission of inquiry is a man of peace according to Mr. Bush and new presidents are set without

[02:19:22.220 --> 02:19:26.900]
discussion Washington kills the leadership of its enemies with impunity it tries to kill Osama bin

[02:19:26.900 --> 02:19:31.360]
Laden and Mullah Omar and does kill Uday and Kuseh Hussein and both of its prowess in liquidating

[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:36.600]
the al-Qaeda leadership from rocket firing drones it tries to kill Sodom and Baghdad and slaughter

[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:42.040]
16 civilians and admits that the operation was not risk-free in Afghanistan three men have now been

[02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:45.500]
murdered in the West interrogation center at Bagram we still don't know what really goes on

[02:19:45.500 --> 02:19:51.340]
in Guantanamo what do these presidents mean i have a dark suspicion from now on our leaders are

[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:56.220]
politicians our statesmen will be fair game too if we go for the jugular why shouldn't they the

[02:19:56.220 --> 02:20:00.160]
killing of the when surgery over here at Del Mehla was not i think a chance murder Hamas is most

[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:03.940]
recent statements and since they've been added to the bush circus of evil we should take them

[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:08.420]
seriously are now more than ever personally threatening Mr. Shiron why should we expect any

[02:20:08.420 --> 02:20:13.100]
other leader to be safe if yes or arafat is driven to exile yet again will there be any restraints

[02:20:13.100 --> 02:20:17.920]
like that all of course america's enemies were grizzly bunched Saddam soled his country with

[02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:22.140]
the masquerades of the innocence mullah Omar allowed his misogynist legions to terrify an entire

[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:27.540]
society in Afghanistan but in their absence we've created vanditry rape kidnapping guerrilla war

[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:32.760]
in anarchy at all in the name of the dead of 9-11 the future of the middle east which is what 9-11

[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:37.360]
was partly about that we're not allowed to say so has never looked bleaker or more bloody the

[02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:40.800]
united states and britain are trapped in the war of their own making responsible for their own

[02:20:40.800 --> 02:20:45.340]
appalling predicament but responsible to fit lives of thousands of innocent human beings cut to

[02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:49.600]
pieces by american bombs in Afghanistan in a wreck shot down on the streets of a wreck by trigger

[02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:55.460]
happy g-i's as for terror our enemies are closing in on our armies in a wreck and are supposed to

[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:59.780]
analyze and bag that in Afghanistan even in Pakistan we've done all of this in the name of the dead

[02:20:59.780 --> 02:21:05.400]
of 9-11 not since the second world war if we seen folly on this scale and it is scarcely begun

[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:08.120]

oh i don't think it's gonna get to eight okay we'll see we'll see how this audience comes

[02:27:29.180 --> 02:27:34.240]
through okay how emotional they are how whipped up into a frenzy there here's a poll terror laws

[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:38.740]
for threatened freedoms see an end poll while most americans don't feel they've lost individual

[02:27:38.740 --> 02:27:42.660]
freedoms because of anti terror laws passed after nine eleven attacks two third say they

[02:27:42.660 --> 02:27:47.500]
worry that this could happen in the future according to an ap pool the survey also found

[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:51.920]
sharply partisan differences in how people view attorney general john ascroft and ardent

[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:55.520]
supporter of anti terrorism laws that he says of an instrumental in preventing another attack

[02:27:55.520 --> 02:27:59.980]
against the u.s about two thirds of respawn and say there's somewhat of very concerned about

[02:27:59.980 --> 02:28:04.320]
the possible loss of freedom from such measures on a separate question thirty one percent so they

[02:28:04.320 --> 02:28:08.660]
think people's legal rights have been violated by fifty eight percent so they hadn't and yada yada yada

[02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:12.880]
yada about half of those polls say the bush administration's been about right and using new

[02:28:12.880 --> 02:28:17.320]
electrified terrorism while twenty four percent say the government's gone too far eighteen percent say

[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:23.320]
it hasn't gone far enough oh the poll also found fifty one percent of people believe it'd be necessary

[02:28:23.320 --> 02:28:26.820]
for average people to give up some individual freedom as part of the fight against terrorism and

[02:28:26.820 --> 02:28:30.520]
to please those people who think the other start giving up their rights got good news for you

[02:28:31.920 --> 02:28:37.020]
president bush told congress yesterday to untie the hands of law enforcement officials and arm them

[02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:41.420]
with wider legal powers to combat terrorists aim the groups that struck america two years ago are

[02:28:41.420 --> 02:28:47.520]
wounded but still dangerous he's specifically called for expanding use of the federal death penalty

[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:51.460]
tougher bail restrictions greater subpoena powers that he said are available for other crimes

[02:28:51.460 --> 02:28:54.920]
such as drug trafficking and bezeling but they can't be used against terrorism

[02:28:54.920 --> 02:28:58.480]
yeah the death penalty would have been very effective at nine eleven wouldn't it oh yeah

[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.320]
would have all those suicide bombers in the zillion the hijackers that would have deterred them on

[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:09.180]
this disparity in law makes no sense bush and the speech at the FBI academy in quattico verginia

[02:29:10.040 --> 02:29:13.500]
bushes appeal through the white house in a way growing debate over the anti terrorism USA

[02:29:13.500 --> 02:29:17.560]
patriarch enacted after the attacks of nine eleven credit state laws too intrusive and a

[02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:22.040]
threat to civil liberties and fear that the administration is trying to pass a second version

[02:29:22.040 --> 02:29:27.040]
of the measure in piecemeal fashion even some house and center republicans have talked about

[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:31.160]
rolling back portions of the patriot act i don't think tom braides to happy about it either after

[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:36.260]
last sunday for the sake of the american people bush said congress should change the law and give

[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:40.900]
law enforcement officials the same tools they have to fight terror that they have to fight other crime

[02:29:41.440 --> 02:29:45.860]
bush acknowledge that not all members of all congress agree with the need to tighten law but he

[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:50.580]
said a lot of them do the white house indicated bush supports tougher laws in other areas beyond

[02:29:50.580 --> 02:29:55.360]
the three instances he cited the a c l u said that further erosions of judicial oversight and the

[02:29:55.360 --> 02:30:00.920]
basic checks and balances are the wrong path to take and they of course are absolutely correct but

[02:30:00.920 --> 02:30:05.320]
nevertheless don't confuse the american people because we have to be safe

[02:30:07.300 --> 02:30:11.580]
speaking to be in safe scientists who analyze the aftermath of the nine eleven two thousand one

[02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:16.360]
attacks on the world trade center say that workers at ground zero suffered brutal effects from

[02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:21.520]
the fumes coming out of the wreckage the day b repile acted like a chemical factory said professor

[02:30:21.520 --> 02:30:27.200]
Thomas kehl of the university of california davis it cooked together the components of the buildings

[02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:31.940]
in their contents including enormous numbers of computers and gave off gases of toxic metals

[02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:37.480]
acid and organics for at least six weeks he said professor kehl held a research group which

[02:30:37.480 --> 02:30:41.860]
collected over eight thousand air samples between the second and thirty of october two thousand and

[02:30:41.860 --> 02:30:45.540]
one a mile away from the collapse trade center towers the group produced report on those samples

[02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:49.380]
last year but has not come up with a much more detailed explanation of what went on after the

[02:30:49.380 --> 02:30:54.780]
catastrophe when the towers burn and collapse tons of concrete glass furniture carpets insulation

[02:30:54.780 --> 02:30:59.800]
computers and paper were reduced to enormous oxygen four day repiles that burned slowly till

[02:30:59.800 --> 02:31:05.400]
the semen nineteen in that hot pile some of the constituent elements combined with organic matter

[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:09.800]
and abundant chlorine from papers and plastics and then escape to the surface as metal rich gases

[02:31:11.320 --> 02:31:15.340]
these then either burned or chemically decomposed into very fine particles capable of

[02:31:15.340 --> 02:31:20.100]
penetrating deeply into the human lungs the university be saying professor kehl and his

[02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:24.640]
colleagues identified four classes of particles likely to damage human health fine and very fine

[02:31:24.640 --> 02:31:29.000]
transition metals which interfere with lung chemistry sulfuric acid which attacks cilia and lung

[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:33.560]
cells directly very fine insoluble gas glass particles which travel through the lungs to the blood

[02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:38.620]
stream and heart and high temperature organic matter many components which are known to be carcinogens

[02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:43.240]
conditions would have been brutal for people working at ground zero without respirators slightly

[02:31:43.240 --> 02:31:47.240]
less so for those working we're living in immediately adjacent buildings professor kehl said the

[02:31:47.240 --> 02:31:51.160]
new date has been presented to the national meeting of the american chemical society in new york

[02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:58.080]

[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.460]

A spectacular outpouring of emotion and content and disgust and affection and well.

[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:49.960]
Whatever.

[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:53.160]

[02:50:57.980 --> 02:50:58.120]
No.

[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:01.060]
And one day I sat down and I don't remember when we started.

[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:03.020]
Do we do like tapes the first vacation or not?

[02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:04.060]
I don't know.

[02:51:04.440 --> 02:51:04.900]
I don't remember.

[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:06.180]
But I do have that.

[02:51:06.720 --> 02:51:12.600]
I remember those awful times down there on the second floor and that awful awful grotesque smelly nasty of.

[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:14.700]
Whatever that building is.

[02:51:14.900 --> 02:51:15.120]
Yeah.

[02:51:15.460 --> 02:51:16.260]
That's the Tanner building.

[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:17.960]
Oh, sure.

[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:23.680]
I mean, down on the second floor, it's bad enough on the third floor there, but on the second floor was unfit for human habitation even a rats move out.

[02:51:23.880 --> 02:51:25.280]
Those were the good old days if you recall.

[02:51:25.440 --> 02:51:26.580]
No, those were the bad old days.

[02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:30.400]
Why would they do good old days is when we had the whammy guy thing people in there and before that.

[02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:31.740]
And nothing was working.

[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:32.920]
Whammy.

[02:51:33.080 --> 02:51:33.900]
Got it sucks.

[02:51:34.260 --> 02:51:35.900]
That's true. We were alone. Nobody was bothering us.

[02:51:35.980 --> 02:51:38.700]
We actually had our own studio. They weren't coming in and dicking with all the equipment.

[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:42.660]
That part of it's true. All the equipment didn't work anyway.

[02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:42.720]
Right.

[02:51:43.480 --> 02:51:43.740]
Right.

[02:51:44.080 --> 02:51:47.820]
I think the best part of that whole deal was like the weeks leading up to going on a year.

[02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:54.200]
Like right after Duff call and said, oh Greg wanted me to tell you that the studio isn't going to be ready by the summer 30th.

[02:51:54.340 --> 02:52:01.720]
And I said, well, tell him that if the studio is already I'll be on some other station on the summer 30th because that's when I'm going back on here after getting paid seven months not to work.

[02:52:01.940 --> 02:52:02.960]
Yeah, I'd have packed some people.

[02:52:03.140 --> 02:52:05.140]
That wasn't the only one. There were lots of good ones.

[02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:07.140]
Oh, yeah. The quonset hut, the trailer.

[02:52:07.920 --> 02:52:08.280]
Right.

[02:52:09.680 --> 02:52:14.900]
Anyway, those weeks that we were spending in there working just doing our own thing putting all the stuff on those mini discs. Remember that?

[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:15.280]
Oh, yeah.

[02:52:15.540 --> 02:52:21.220]
And then of course we finally got the DCS which arrived in parts from Philadelphia because they certainly were going to buy a new one where they are.

[02:52:21.220 --> 02:52:21.500]
Oh, no.

[02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:29.580]
From their station in Philadelphia and arrived like there a couple of days before and then hours and days and weeks of working over a goddamn hut, the computer.

[02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:31.320]
Putting all that stuff.

[02:52:31.420 --> 02:52:36.960]
And of course after seven months being paid vacation there from Paxon when we came back on the air we had like all that neat new cramp.

[02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:38.080]
Yeah, you know, yeah.

[02:52:38.680 --> 02:52:45.960]
And I would say out of all of the things that we had probably the most lasting and the most significant was.

[02:52:47.900 --> 02:52:48.820]
This is Debbie.

[02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:49.740]
Hi, Debbie.

[02:52:50.220 --> 02:52:52.420]
I'm interested in going through operations done.

[02:52:52.900 --> 02:52:53.200]
Okay.

[02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:55.540]
And some body contouring and some liposuction.

[02:52:56.060 --> 02:53:00.960]
And I was wondering if you had some tummy tuck and lip augmentation cosmetic vest.

[02:53:00.960 --> 02:53:03.580]
Since I first hit all of these things.

[02:53:03.960 --> 02:53:05.160]
And those wondering.

[02:53:05.540 --> 02:53:06.360]
What would you like to start with?

[02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:13.220]
Well, I need to get everything done. Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing.

[02:53:13.860 --> 02:53:14.800]
Okay, we don't do that.

[02:53:15.140 --> 02:53:17.180]
No. Could you do breast implants though?

[02:53:18.140 --> 02:53:20.840]
It can't be done but they don't know if they would do it right away.

[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:22.760]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:53:23.940 --> 02:53:24.880]
How much?

[02:53:25.560 --> 02:53:26.420]
5,000.

[02:53:26.800 --> 02:53:27.180]
Excellent.

[02:53:27.580 --> 02:53:29.640]
I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too.

[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:31.360]
Layser surgery.

[02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:35.360]
Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy?

[02:53:36.020 --> 02:53:36.600]
Excuse me?

[02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:38.500]
Don't hurt mommy's little baby.

[02:53:39.020 --> 02:53:41.020]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:44.780]
I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV.

[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:45.680]
Okay.

[02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:47.940]
Can you make me look more like a woman?

[02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:49.440]
Well, we'll have to see you first.

[02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:51.860]
And there's one looking at you. We can tell you that when we see you.

[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:55.940]
Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy?

[02:53:56.640 --> 02:53:57.740]
If you'd like to.

[02:53:58.180 --> 02:54:00.000]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:00.540 --> 02:54:01.400]
Or should I make an appointment?

[02:54:02.080 --> 02:54:02.500]
Yes.

[02:54:03.020 --> 02:54:06.140]
Okay. There is a $100 consultation fee.

[02:54:06.500 --> 02:54:07.040]
That's fine.

[02:54:08.640 --> 02:54:09.200]
Okay.

[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:10.920]
Okay.

[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:13.840]
My name is Buffalo Bill.

[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:15.880]
Okay. Let me get a little information from you.

[02:54:16.140 --> 02:54:16.540]
Mommy.

[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:19.340]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:20.380]
I understand.

[02:54:20.800 --> 02:54:22.900]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:22.900 --> 02:54:25.360]
Do you want to come in for consultation?

[02:54:25.660 --> 02:54:29.100]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:29.680 --> 02:54:30.180]
Okay.

[02:54:31.040 --> 02:54:32.320]
Would you like to make it appointment?

[02:54:32.520 --> 02:54:33.300]
Or do you want to call me back?

[02:54:33.660 --> 02:54:35.360]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:38.180]
I got my skin suit nipple I'd like to see.

[02:54:39.600 --> 02:54:40.100]
Bill.

[02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:42.840]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:44.100]
I understand that.

[02:54:44.200 --> 02:54:46.680]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:47.380 --> 02:54:48.320]
Would you like to make an appointment?

[02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:50.360]
It puts the lotion in the basket.

[02:54:50.820 --> 02:54:52.460]
Okay, I will talk to you in the time, okay?

[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:54.380]
It puts a lotion in the basket.

[02:54:54.860 --> 02:54:55.180]
No.

[02:54:57.100 --> 02:54:58.880]
So like I said, it had its moments.

[02:55:00.420 --> 02:55:02.380]
743 votes, he will do over 7 feet.

[02:55:02.680 --> 02:55:03.660]
Pinks says hi, by the way.

[02:55:04.100 --> 02:55:04.740]
Who does? Hank.

[02:55:05.160 --> 02:55:06.200]
Oh, hi, hopper. How you doing?

[02:55:06.940 --> 02:55:08.940]
Is he in there? Oh, he's in the hallway.

[02:55:09.260 --> 02:55:11.660]
Oh, he's in the hallway. I hate him. Love you. Love, hold Hank.

[02:55:11.860 --> 02:55:14.440]
And boys, he got a good scam. I mean, he actually is doing a whole three hour show today.

[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:17.740]
Although, he's got the one hour of bino cook, so it's like, and that's easy.

[02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:18.740]
It's like falling off a log.

[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:22.840]
But, uh, yeah, Hank's gone. He's got a town pat mad dogs off today again.

[02:55:22.960 --> 02:55:25.600]
We got it going on QAM. I've taught these people well.

[02:55:26.020 --> 02:55:27.100]
My students, my disciples.

[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:29.040]
Less work, more pay.

[02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:33.220]
Work a couple hours here, a couple of days a week, go off to Vegas, go to the Bahamas,

[02:55:33.660 --> 02:55:35.820]
take a few months off here, and that's the way to do it.

[02:55:36.820 --> 02:55:40.120]
You know, as much as we belly, I can complain when it comes to the bottom line.

[02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:44.360]
Seriously, of course not for you, because you could pay crap and treat it like garbage, but beside that,

[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:49.200]
for some of us, those of us big fat celebrities, mostly fat, we're doing pretty damn good, you know.

[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:49.640]
Mm-hmm.

[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:53.460]
And you're, you know, you suck it off some good freebies here and there.

[02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:55.360]
Here they're. Once it wants in a great while.

[02:55:56.940 --> 02:55:59.440]
743 votes. I'm sure it's probably close to 750 right now.

[02:56:00.820 --> 02:56:02.680]
Let me take a puke. Do we do the break?

[02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:07.800]
Come on, look at that. Now they're jamming up on there. That's why it takes so long for this to a refresh.

[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:10.440]
Ah, it was refreshing though. 746.

[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:14.660]
How did George do filling in this summer? Okay, I listened to 156.

[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:18.060]
Awful, I stopped listening 177. Awful, George.

[02:56:18.460 --> 02:56:18.820]
Mm-hmm.

[02:56:18.960 --> 02:56:23.380]
Week, I really listened to 152. Great job. Best ever, 136.

[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.800]
Fabulous time for Neo2. Retire!

[02:56:27.500 --> 02:56:29.940]
25. 3.3%.

[02:56:30.980 --> 02:56:33.620]
Like I said, don't expect much.

[02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:38.660]
Seriously, 10 bucks a year from each listener out there, and that's all I had.

[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:40.660]
Just for the rest of my life, and yet I'm an old fart anyway.

[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:42.360]
I might croak next week. The fart years.

[02:56:42.880 --> 02:56:45.260]
Although my parents both lived in 90 and was still alive.

[02:56:45.500 --> 02:56:47.060]
I just meant that it was a warning, okay?

[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:50.360]
So if you're going to make a commitment, at least they'll continue for another 20 years.

[02:56:50.480 --> 02:56:51.820]
10 bucks. I mean, how much is that?

[02:56:53.360 --> 02:56:55.620]
10 bucks a year. Mm-hmm. For 20 years.

[02:56:55.700 --> 02:56:58.140]
200 bucks to get me off the air. I think it's a piece of cake.

[02:56:59.440 --> 02:56:59.760]
Cake?

[02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:02.980]
154 at 560. WDQ, I'm no forget we got a van.

[02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:07.700]
And then, if QM van will be at the Shell Station Sheridan Street just right by on 95 there tomorrow on Hollywood.

You can worship in peace. You can marry a girl named Steve.

[02:59:53.460 --> 02:59:57.840]
A bitch, a culture. It's fun to stay at the best.

[02:59:58.600 --> 02:59:59.920]
A bitch, a culture. Yeah.

[03:00:00.420 --> 03:00:00.460]
Alright.

[03:00:01.420 --> 03:00:04.600]
Young man, young man. We will let you run in.

[03:00:05.060 --> 03:00:08.180]
Young man, young man. We sing shows who's not here.

[03:00:09.040 --> 03:00:14.800]
Well, this has been a breath of pressure today. If you ask me, I'll tell you on this end of the show, I give it about a 55 on a scale of two, you know what?

[03:00:15.220 --> 03:00:17.500]
Let me make you over and pat myself on the back. Nice going, Neil.

[03:00:17.560 --> 03:00:18.160]
Yeah, good.

[03:00:18.460 --> 03:00:19.160]
Thank you. Not bad.

[03:00:19.420 --> 03:00:22.440]
Callers just sucked pretty all the earlier in the show. We had a lot of good calls, you know what?

[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:23.920]
Right. So don't press your luck.

[03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:24.980]
Time's up.

[03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:26.140]
I'm not talking for me though.

[03:00:28.200 --> 03:00:29.800]
760. I'll just pretend I didn't hear him.

[03:00:30.260 --> 03:00:32.420]
762. How did George Duder in the summer?

[03:00:32.420 --> 03:00:36.000]
Okay, I listened to 63. Offal, I stopped listening 182.

[03:00:36.520 --> 03:00:40.820]
Week, I rarely listen 154. Great job. Best ever 137.

[03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:43.520]
Fable list time for Neil to retire.

[03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:48.560]
26. Keep those checks coming, baby. The little dog, whatever the dog is named.

[03:00:48.620 --> 03:00:49.460]
