[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280]
You know there are no warning, it's time for Hall of Burton to get busy

[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.760]
Out of patience at a time, let's get those oil fields online

[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.440]
If humans have to die, well that's a pity

[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.340]
I'm the late one

[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.240]
We're marching in, walking tall, like John Wayne with pink balls

[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.800]
Kill anyone who dares get in our way

[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.380]
Walk in the ground, who it is, for women down to little kids

[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.900]
We've got the pump that oil rattle in

[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.480]
Because war is good for business, my love grew

[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.440]
War is good for business, and global crossing too

[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.800]
War is good for business, and friends of three

[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.360]
War is good for business, even MSNBC

[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.200]
Who's that?

[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.060]
You asshole

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.420]
Point the camera over here, look at the woman

[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.880]
Welcome fears of people glad to see us

[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.380]
The radar act

[00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.600]
Only the spin machine knows what the camera doesn't show

[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.600]
All the rifles we got pointed at their backs

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.080]
Our trouble can't work in fine

[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.900]
Got the goose nebbing in line

[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.500]
Those warrants will buy anything we say

[00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.880]
And those who choose to follow

[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.080]
Fly will be rewarded in kind

[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.300]
With cheaper prices at the public pay head

[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.840]
They'll say that war is good for business

[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.440]
Only well

[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.980]
War is good for business, and Ron and Beckton

[00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.620]
War is good for business, he is right

[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.400]
War is good for business, and friends of three things to love

[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.020]
Who's this?

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.700]
Oh

[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.000]
Look at these pictures, baby, US tanks roll in the bag there

[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.680]
Yeah

[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740]
I'll tell you a powerful image is man

[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.560]
And the people are getting brainwashed big time

[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.100]
I'm sitting here looking at this and thinking

[00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.440]
Yeah

[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.400]
Is it emotional?

[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.640]
Yeah, of course it is

[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.100]
All wave and American flag, all these teenagers out there

[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.760]
All these people

[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.040]
We're in Baghdad, no more Sodom

[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.100]
It looks like he's either dead or badly injured

[00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.860]
Or

[00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.780]
Neither of the above depending on which

[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.680]
How come the overhead is so loud today

[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.400]
Do you hear that?

[00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.740]
Good God is this thing cranked up

[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.380]
I can't even turn a goddamn thing

[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.180]
By the way, the good news here is the better news even than that

[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.040]
Now you didn't pay much attention

[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860]
The overhead there's something wrong with this thing

[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.120]
It's too loud

[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.680]
Too loud

[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.940]
Oh, it must be because the speaker was put

[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.980]
Maybe they did something with it

[00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.460]
This thing is grotesque

[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.680]
Anyway, to see how Holyo fat Holyo engineer lost 25 pounds

[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.540]
You don't understand?

[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.640]
I noticed that he's lost something in

[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.860]
I said to him, I think I embarrassed you into it

[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.760]
And he said, you're probably right

[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.600]
How do you like that?

[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.540]
Yeah, see

[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.520]
These people in the audience who think I'm a hardass and tell people

[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.020]
You're a disgusting fat slob

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.060]
Which I'm a fat slob too but at least I admit it

[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.340]
And I'm always working on it and the fat too

[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.660]
But I embarrassed him into it

[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.580]
Sometimes that's a good thing

[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.500]
Rather than saying, oh, Eugene, don't worry about it

[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.580]
You know, you're pleasantly plump

[00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400]
But that's what he thought he was pleasantly plump

[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.980]
He was a gigantic fat tub of crap

[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.140]
I mean, he's a good guy

[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.700]
But he was a big tub

[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.220]
I think the overhead is streaming on now

[00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.880]
I mean, maybe not

[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.540]
Doesn't sound right

[00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.180]
Maybe they replaced that speaker

[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.200]
Maybe they'd dicked around with the speakers

[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.320]
And then sound too good to me

[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.260]
Sounds really bad, muff

[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.480]
Sounds really bad

[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.620]
Get the whole crew in here

[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.980]
And start working on this

[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.200]
You'll be pleased at all

[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.400]
By the way, speaking of how things feel in sound

[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.200]
That Moe came to the door this morning

[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.380]
I was sitting here about 830

[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.800]
And stuck and said, hey, there's Skippy

[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.400]
There's a real rocket scientist for you

[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.020]
That's right

[00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.860]
I said, oh, you made for me

[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.540]
You're the best man

[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.480]
I always said, this Skippy

[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.360]
If there's one guy in the sales department we can count on

[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.580]
It's that little Skippy

[00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.680]
I used to have a dog named Skippy

[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.540]
But he's been dead for a long time

[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.680]
That Skippy, you're okay

[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.880]
I mean, compared to like fat boy

[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.340]
You're okay

[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.280]
Which ain't saying much

[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.320]
Here's my oh, you made for blood pressure

[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.560]
I'm gonna pop a couple of

[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.800]
Pop a couple of

[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.100]
Couple of

[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.560]
Couple

[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.800]
Yeah

[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.020]
Right here on the years

[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.700]
What I'm gonna do

[00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.240]
See, I'm all worked up because Moe came

[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.180]
And he said, feeling okay

[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.120]
And I waived

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.860]
I said, never better

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.060]
I gave him the old thumbs up

[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.340]
We have American flag

[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.860]
Hotel and the

[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:52.060]
Meridian

[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.360]
Palestine Meridian hotel

[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.940]
So at a Palestine hotel again, we just got bad aim, you know

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.540]
We said that the shots came from the lobby

[00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.420]
All that supposed

[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.920]
Sniper fire

[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.880]
Which all the journalists said there wasn't any sniper fire

[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.900]
But we said it came from the lobby

[00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.160]
And then all of a sudden it was shooting up on the 15th floor

[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.880]
So I guess we must just have bad aim once in a while

[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.700]
And nothing's perfect

[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.040]
It's war, you know, war is hell

[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.480]
Right

[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:14.940]
Collateral damage, man

[00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.860]
Just one of those things

[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.440]
Here's my oleo oleo med

[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.760]
Open it up the box

[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.360]
So what was I just about to say before that little

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.340]
Nitwood Skippy came in here, boy, see

[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.000]
How much of it was that

[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.340]
He's got a dangerous looking isn't he

[00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.400]
I mean kind of like in a

[00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.540]
I don't mean dangerous like

[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.760]
Offensively but like

[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.300]
You know what I mean

[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.580]
Like if brains were dangerous he'd be a lot safer

[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.880]
Or is it the other way around

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.420]
I don't know

[00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.460]
Here's my oleo med for blood pressure

[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.460]
Beautiful, thank you very much guys

[00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.000]
That's my close personal pizons at oleo med

[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.720]
This is good stuff

[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.740]
So anyway, let's see you got a

[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.720]
Fax here says good luck to your Leafs and a playoffs

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.880]
Rip in the Panther organization

[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.280]
This fact I don't have time to talk about the panthers today

[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.280]
Because last time I checked the playoffs start tonight

[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.820]
Are they in it?

[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.060]
No

[00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.600]
No, they're not

[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.940]
As usual

[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.860]
It's become

[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.200]
Oh and talk about neurotic repetition

[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.420]
This is going to be like yes they

[00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.500]
I'm going to ramble a lot

[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.940]
Got a lot to say

[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.440]
And plus we have the big noon to one hour today

[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.620]
Which we will continue doing

[00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:09.460]
We like it a lot

[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.180]
Love it

[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.080]
We love it on this show

[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.500]
It's better what some people might say

[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.240]
You asshole

[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.760]
Like him

[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.640]
Now he's very concerned about how I feel

[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.480]
Naturally he just slow on the uptake

[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.260]
He doesn't understand that we hate him like poison

[00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.540]
And he just he's in denial

[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.440]
He's like a guy that beats his wife and kids

[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.820]
And then just you know

[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.800]
Blays it up to the point where they never want to see him again

[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.060]
And he comes back to the door saying

[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.500]
Oh are you guys okay

[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.020]
I mean he didn't really mean it

[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.640]
You know it's like the same thing

[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.900]
You know

[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:39.580]
I heard that knit with Scott that called him this morning on the way to work

[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.780]
I wanted to the knit with Scott guy

[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.520]
He sounded just like that's why I played it to he sounded like

[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.440]
Kits off gets me fired up when I hear someone say that

[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.260]
Like that guy I think it was him Scott

[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.160]
You're a knit with Scott

[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.700]
See the audience has a difficult time relating

[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.200]
That's why we had a jerk call in yesterday

[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.180]
Wow this is all for ratings to get people

[00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.300]
It's got nothing to do with ratings

[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.240]
It's just they're confused

[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.740]
Because in the history of their lives

[00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.220]
They've never heard any any person

[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.600]
So vilified and crucified as Mo

[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.000]
And of course

[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.980]
Because they've never met anybody like Mo

[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.360]
They've never been I've never myself

[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.580]
Been in a situation like this

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.600]
Where everybody in a building just finds him

[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.780]
Detestable unacceptable on a human on a visceral level

[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.340]
As Mr. Ego would say on a visceral level

[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.220]
But that's all your fault

[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.540]
It must be on my fault

[00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.240]
I guess I was the one to try and force him to try to get George fired

[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.120]
And start with all that race baiting crap

[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.060]
And all of a sudden a bull crap

[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.340]
Yeah, it must have been my fault

[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.500]
Now it must have been me that told him

[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.660]
Hey go after Doreen out there if that's a golf tournament

[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.180]
Right didn't I tell him that

[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.440]
He did go attack that nasty bitch

[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.660]
Make her life miserable

[00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.340]
Make her wish that she that he was dead

[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.920]
Like I said Mo

[00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.860]
I feel great in fact I'm in good shape to dance on your grave

[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.360]
So let me know I don't want to be out of town when it happens

[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.280]
I want to be here

[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.740]
Willy T. Ribson I'm going to do a little tap dance

[00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.820]
Sammy Davis said he might just come back for a little while

[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:51.280]
Just just long enough to do it

[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.980]
Yeah

[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.860]
I'm putting taps on my shoes man

[00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.120]
With my old lime green pants

[00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.180]
My 72 year old pants and my prune juice

[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.640]
I'm putting some taps on his shoes

[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.440]
Suspected execution side actually a more

[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.700]
I just mentioned this in passing

[00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.280]
I don't want to pee on your parade because obviously it's a glorious day for the

[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.840]
Invader lovers. I mean the award lovers. I mean the Liberation

[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.480]
Attack on Iraq. I keep thinking about that about the different logos like on cbc

[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.160]
As opposed to our operation Iraqi freedom

[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.080]
But bag that has fallen the American tanks are up and down the streets

[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:25.240]
I believe there isn't any given directions

[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.740]
They're standing out there with their rifles

[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.600]
No sort of control do they have over this country

[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.580]
Even the Iraqi minister

[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.880]
Information minister is gone which I'm going to miss him

[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.520]
He was a hoot

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:39.180]
He was almost as funny as the clowns Sodom that was out there in the streets that we saw those tapes over and over again

[00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.720]
The Iraqi information. We are still in control here and there's no problem

[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.260]
The Americans were going to kill them every one and there's nobody here

[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.920]
They're not in the city and the

[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:51.360]
And there's tanks and the tanks who right behind them and the bombs are like bursting in air right behind

[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.960]
He was a client who was very amusing very entertaining

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:59.580]
But he's he's a evidently a whole day. It's what the expression might be. They're all gone

[00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.340]
They're all gone

[00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:03.940]
What's ice full of money I heard the the best

[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.820]
Guess that we can give is the well depends on which report you want to believe but Sodom evidently was injured badly

[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:12.700]
Seriously along with one son and the other son whose name which one was it

[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.120]
Uh kuse

[00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.500]
Kuse he was killed is what they're saying

[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.540]
And the rumors that Sodom and the one son are in

[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:26.100]
Mosul and they're trying to get to Syria to get medical attention because they're like badly hurt

[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:28.560]
Not going to get any tears from me on that

[00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.300]
scumbags

[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.120]
Now if I really believe we were in there to remove the scumbags for the right reasons

[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.280]
I would say oh right. Yeah, but I'm not gonna do it

[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.820]
I'm trying very hard not to get swept up because this is so emotional all these pictures

[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.860]
Then you was gonna be yeah, I was part of the plan

[00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.880]
But I hate and of course three weeks to the day wasn't that three weeks ago tonight that they dropped the first

[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.180]
Bunker busters when they started two days ahead of time. Yep. Three weeks to the day

[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:56.920]
But I hate to break the news as I started to say before Carlos interrupted that

[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:03.620]
This is this is the easy part in spite of all the bloodshed and the thousands and thousands of dead civilians and the

[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.820]
Thousands of other injured and wounded and of course the ally troops the whatever we're not the allies what we call it the coalition sorry

[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:15.180]
Uh, this that was the easy part now comes the hard part. I got a really good facts here from William

[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.000]
I want to read it momentarily

[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:22.120]
Oh did I mention the thing about these suspected executions side actually a morgue I'll get to that lots of good stuff

[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.500]
We got the poor result from yesterday. We got a great new pool. We got the new to one comedy bits hour

[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.440]
Life is sweet baby WQ I am

[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.220]

Yeah Howard Howard David is Goldie there. Peace. Uh Goldies on the can

[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.560]
The best call of day

[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.000]
The first one it can only get better from that nice go answer. Let's light it up a little bit

[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.940]
We don't want to get more but again. We try to like alternate alternate more bid days with lighthearted

[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:53.280]
You know, I don't want to get immersed in all the morbidity

[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:58.840]
Let's give people a few yucks here is who determines who gets the contract. Yeah

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.380]
Wow my timing strikes again just as I put my finger on it who's gonna get all those big contracts

[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.040]
So we'll rebuild the countries and do get those oil fields up and go it again and oh

[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.380]
Boy, I guess we better ask condolese and

[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.920]
Dick Cheney and those guys some other dick

[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:20.620]
Love it past nine at five sixty WQ. I'm gonna be before I do this bottom

[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.140]
I'm gonna pop a couple of olio med my purse and you can be a witness look at that

[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:28.220]
For my blood pressure my pressure is gonna be so low. I'm probably gonna be in a coma

[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:29.960]
Huh you'll see why

[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.140]
There goes one oh

[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.560]
There goes two at the same time

[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:45.440]
Oh, that's good stuff and you can you can it doesn't linger in your mouth, but you can taste the olive oil in it, you know

[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.180]
Really yes, I thought it was like the capsule cover all that stuff

[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.440]
It is but you can when you first take them you can taste what you want to know that there's something in it

[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.920]
That's true. Jesus. What what is wrong with you? You know, I think you hung around George too long

[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.600]
If you say if it sounds like I'm in a really good mood is cause George is off this week

[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.580]
Not that I don't love George very much and appreciate all the tremendous things he's done for this show

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.060]
I can't think of any at the moment, but it's just a pleasure not that I mean

[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:16.020]
And of course tonight we got treasure island with Carlos and Miguel are gonna be there

[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.660]
No George to like hustle everybody to try to get something

[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.300]
See by people to be a little lucky. We'll talk about that lots of good stuff going on here at QM because Baghdad fell maybe

[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.120]
Yeah, it's in the Baghdad

[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.900]
In fact, you probably want to call your travel agent right now get over there the hotels are gonna be beautiful

[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.540]
Don't stay at the Palestine hotel though not yet. I'll let you know when

[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.940]
How many times have you heard an opportunity and you didn't act you didn't reach out and just grab it

[00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:48.120]
You missed out right now is one of those times rarely does an opportunity interrupt you but this one should interest rates have gone down even lower

[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:56.240]
Financial group is offering interest rate of 3.45 percent then lowered it to 2.95 percent now rates have gone down even lower believe it or not

[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.200]
I'm gonna wait by agree

[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.200]
2.45 percent financing with financial group let me say it again

[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:06.620]
2.45 percent call financial group toll free at 180940 land

[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.620]
How long will these low interest rates last who to hell knows but probably not very long

[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.580]
It's a window of opportunity so hop right through it with the national group and get an incredible or rate of just

[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:21.940]
2.45 percent and save yourself a Schmidt load of cash call financial group toll free at 180940 land

[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:26.480]
And let me tell you what 2.45 percent financing will do to those monthly payments if you have a

[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.360]
$200,000 loan you pay only

[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:30.500]
$786 bucks a month if you have a

[00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.160]
$100,000 loan you pay only

[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.300]
393 bucks a month chump change so do it now call financial group

[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.900]
5.34 APR

[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.240]
Other train monkey

[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:05.720]
If you watch only one reality show this season you'll want to watch the show where the kids finally get into the action

[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:15.940]
Tonight on Fox the premiere of touched by an American Idol young boys from all over the country will compete for the affection and fortune of American icon

[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:21.280]
Michael Jackson that's the beautiful thing touched by an American Idol what's it doing now?

[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:28.860]
It's called growing and changing its reality TV like no other and you get to vote on who gets to sleep and Michael's bed

[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.560]
Touched by an American Idol Tuesday night at 10 on Fox

[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.440]
What's wrong with sharing alone but I don't want to share

[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:45.060]
Well, here's an interesting facts here in Eagle Arab Sublight TV is showing cheering crowds in Baghdad greeting your US Marines as other crowds

[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.920]
griefily loot Iraqi government buildings

[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:53.180]
uh american TV showing jubilant Curtis demonstrators in northern Iraq as the mercenary fed iEem are being killed by the thousands

[00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:59.240]
British TV journalist have taken us through an Iraqi secret police station in Basra as locals tell of years of torture of men

[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.640]
Women even children in the depths of the building in light of these current events blind opposition in this war is beginning to look ridiculous

[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:07.940]
Of course, I was never blindly opposed to what i'm still not okay blind opposite

[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.860]
Says so the question for you today is can a man in your position afford to make himself look ridiculous

[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:15.320]
Still a fan Gregory and Coral Springs Gregory

[00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:21.000]
That's my comment to you. Okay, it wasn't blind opposition and i'm still not blind and you're the one with the blinders on okay

[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.560]
But these are very very heartening pictures and it's wonderful if we if you really believe that we're gonna go around the world

[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:32.120]
Because we're so benevolent and free all of the oppressed peoples of the world then i got some wonderful swampland in the glades man

[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:33.820]
I'll sell you real cheap, okay?

[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:36.420]
Gritty or nobody ever criticized the ends just the means

[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:38.920]
Are you starting it again?

[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.300]
Carlos is starting it again, okay?

[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.160]
Can't help it

[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:48.900]
In addition to which i did criticize the ends because the ends is gonna be a US puppet government

[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.760]
In fact, that's what the big argument is now which are not the visions that you see on your screen

[00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.020]
All we did talk about it at length last night between the brits and the you win any merkins and of course

[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.420]
Uh Bush is saying ah you went in gonna, you know, of course yesterday

[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:05.080]
He said the right thing in Ireland because it was because Tony Blair was standing right there. You want him to

[00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:06.760]
slap me in the pus

[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:12.380]
That's right you want Tony to butcher up for just a moment reach over and just slap him on the side of the head

[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.540]
Of course you're reached over in your slap moe on the side of the head

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.440]
I'd like to see that like to see that piece of your skull flying right off

[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.260]
Man, that would be a hoot

[00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:24.740]
So anyway, thanks very much for your costic um glad you're still listening okay Gregory, but you know

[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:29.920]
But here's the fact that this agrees also, but it's uh at least a little more tolerant of opposing views

[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:34.740]
It says Neil all the way agree with you 99% of the time and to prove that i'm currently reading stupid white men

[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:39.300]
Did not vote for any bushing would have paid for aliens one way ticket home and even though we do not agree on the war

[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:43.920]
I respect your opinion and you're ineligible right to voice the same maybe from a for the moment you may feel the same

[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.460]
What one thing about this war is that either you're forward or against it now

[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.780]
There's some people like on the fence and especially now they're like wow, I don't know

[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.660]
These pictures are pretty uh awesome

[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.960]
So what's it so it's agreed we will not change either one's opinion he said absolutely correct

[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.440]
That's right nor should we he so well we could this is William

[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.600]
He says to that and i'd like to give an alternative point of you regarding the war

[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.420]
I don't know how much of a threat Sodom Hussein is or potentially could have been to the west in the past or may have been in the future

[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:16.420]
And that we may never know i can't believe that Hussein has any regard for american life when we know he has no regard for the lives of his own citizens

[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:24.300]
My hope is that if this war accomplishes one thing and one thing only that is to give any other rogue nation's second thoughts when considering a terrorist attack on our country

[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.540]
And the consequences of an attack then i'll consider the innocent lives lost not to have been in vain

[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.000]
Actually, I didn't think it was a rogue country that was behind 9-11 wasn't a country

[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.800]
Anyway

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.960]
Do I believe we're using iraq and our superior fighting power over to make our point?

[00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:42.600]
Yes, but if we do nothing doesn't that leave us open in that for future terrorism

[00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.820]
I would hate to find out later that we should have done a bit more proactive

[00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:51.200]
We lost 3,000 innocent lives on 9-11 those folks had no warning at least the civilians in Baghdad

[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.720]
Do we were coming to get out on time he's talking about the ones that are still alive

[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.420]
I do not want my child to live in fear and he has since that fateful day

[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.320]
And if this is what it takes to protect the US and her citizens and i agree

[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:05.220]
Thank goodness the people in Baghdad last year we've seen been living in fear

[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:06.460]
You know what?

[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.560]
And still a lot of them i'm sure are you know like they're putting on a good face right here and hoping for the best

[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.240]
Ah, i'm mannequins very very good bush is good you know, of course. What do you want him to say?

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.720]
If it was the Russians that were like with their tanks downtown Baghdad

[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.840]
Puntaing very good puntaing we like puntaing you know they'd be saying that

[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.140]
Very very good but come very very good

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.980]
Let's have a drink that's that's what they'd be saying

[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:33.920]
So anyway, thank you waiting for at least being a reasonably you know you're obviously an intelligent guy

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.500]
And you're entitled to your opinion, but i think that it's a real stretch

[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:43.200]
To rationalize all of the bloodshed and the crap that's going on all the lies too by the way the unbelievable propaganda

[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.560]
Oh speaking of propaganda the really even better news is now did you see that the US has taken over iraqi radio and tv

[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.720]
Yeah, we can put the guy then comedy channel on here now

[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:59.260]
Right we can put fox news on there for the air fox news baby all spin all day

[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.720]
So that he uses weapons of mass destruction what weapons oh, i'm sorry

[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:10.620]
And iraqi warehouse full of skeletal human remains appears to have been a repatriation facility for soldiers killed

[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.760]
During the iraq war in the 80s not a torture chamber or execution site just another example

[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:19.600]
Just like those weapons of mass destruction that turned out to be pesticide but you hear very little about that

[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.480]
On the weekend British troops engage in a security sweep of an abandoned military camp on the ox grits of zubir southern Iraq

[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:32.960]
Found a makeshift morgue filled with 664 wooden coffins and the remains of up to 400 nade people and of course the media were hyperventilating

[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:38.000]
Oh look at this not to say that he didn't torture and kill a lot of people because we know that he did just like caster is done

[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.500]
Oh, i'm sorry

[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.420]
They initially thought they discovered a secret iraqi execution site

[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.360]
A nearby courtyard had what appeared to be a custom built shooting gallery and an office containing with a british officer said were

[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.580]
Cells with meat hooks in the ceilings and catalogs filled with photographs of people who have been shot in the head or badly mutilated

[00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.520]
But after preliminary investigations

[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.800]
A special US military war crimes documentation units said the bodies maybe those soldiers killed in the iraq war

[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:05.800]
Forensic scientists examined some of the bodies and determined the injuries were all war related

[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.040]
Chief warrant officer Dan Walter is leader of the task force criminal investigation division said the remains in some of the documents

[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:19.060]
Suggested Iraqi officials have been preparing to exchange the bodies with Iran up to a million people died in the Iran Iraq war of the 1980 to 88

[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.600]
In which of course Sodom was our good close personal friend and we gave them all of our tangible support including all the weapons and

[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.180]
muffins of mess destruction he needed

[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:32.020]
The two countries are still trying to account for tens of thousands of soldiers have been listed as missing

[00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.480]
Uh, Walter said the documents found up to site list all dead people in the facility by name rank and nationality

[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.940]
Some of the bags of human remains examined by US and British investigators also contain personal effects like wallets uniforms and ID tags

[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.640]
So it had nothing to do with being a torture chamber. It's I just mentioned that in passing

[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:55.560]
As part of the propaganda campaign there just dazzled the masses out there. Oh, you see that he was a bad guy

[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.900]
No kidding. Here's another great piece of stuff from the

[00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.940]
Sun sentinel they let it to the editor from herman mz. Edmund pompano beach well

[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:09.480]
Now herman may be under the age of 100 by I don't know people are right letters to the other generally turn out to be over the age of 100

[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.640]
herman says biased headline

[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:18.480]
Pist off at the Sun sentinel is herman. He says your March 22nd headline at Baghdad Marketplace carnage

[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:26.240]
Give the wrong impression. Isn't there a war going on? It should read for American servicemen killed by suicide bomber whose side are you on?

[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:30.160]
Oh

[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.340]
That you know right there. Herman great letter because that says it all

[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:41.340]
That says it all from the America firsters, you know from the field you just dummy up. Okay, you have no right to say those things

[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.340]
You're eating and abetting the enemy right

[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.680]
Whose side are you on it should read this in fact you people have the Sun sentinel don't make any headlines anymore

[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.720]
Herman will tell you what to just put them on the payroll. He'll tell you what the headlines should read

[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:59.840]
As herman picks and chooses selectively the what news that we're going to pick up what propaganda I mean what news

[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:04.460]
You're right. It's very difficult not to get very enthralled by these pictures are great

[00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:08.800]
You know something you know something I'm not very very happy for the liberated

[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.260]
Racky people who are you know at least the suckin are pretty good and looting getting some good free TVs and chairs and stuff

[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.660]
But that that's the small picture like rum spell says that's the little slice of the pie

[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:24.820]
We're looking at and of course the TV images, you know also very selectively are showing us what they want to show us

[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.840]
Not all the dead people. Oh, there was some stuff on yesterday

[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:30.640]
Wow, did you see any of it? Yeah, oh

[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.920]
The people who just happened to be in a wrong place at the wrong time

[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.260]
Man really I'm surprised they showed it nasty nasty stuff

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:43.700]
You're ready Rex the large city. I mean, they're just showing us one little block kind of a bagdad today

[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:49.200]
No, this is also going on in northern Iraq. They showed they've got some spots around where the people are like wave and American flag now

[00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.260]
They're doing USA USA. Let's go mess. Let's go. Oh, so speaking of let's go mess

[00:21:54.260 --> 00:22:00.140]
I don't want to spend much time out of cuz it's beating a dead horse and I do understand this is a sports radio station

[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.840]
Okay, so 16 hours a day

[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:07.980]
Outside of this show in a jone mark show they have to they have to find desperately some crap to talk about related with sports

[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:11.980]
But this thing with a marlin's it. Oh gee, there were only 10,000 people

[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.160]
I don't think there was even 10,000 because I saw a couple of meetings on TV last night

[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:21.040]
The met and several thousand of those were met fans of course with all the New Yorkers we have done here

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.840]
That's a given so nobody nobody showed up. What else is new? I mean, you're beating a dead horse. Don't you understand it?

[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:31.200]
I'm thinking the SPC ought to start checking his place out. You're beating a dead horse

[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.140]
They don't care they didn't care before and they're not gonna care anymore. Okay, they disemble

[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.280]
They've been screwed over in the beginning. They didn't care

[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.100]
They hopped on a bad wagon when at big year 97 and all of a sudden in the last playoff series

[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.300]
They started selling out in the world serious. Hey, we love them marlins

[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.440]
You know how this sounded this is not a baseball town. It's never gonna be you could put another stadium on every street corner

[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:58.020]
Okay, you can have Pudge Rodriguez and Jo Fernandez and Alex Fernandez and Carlos Sanchez you can have all Julio ball player

[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.200]
They don't care. They're not interested

[00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:05.520]
Don't buy and the weather must have been the reason yesterday. Oh, beautiful evening. I mean perfect

[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.500]
Just fantastic

[00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.000]
They don't care but they keep beating it and flage-lating it you talk about boring

[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.500]
So I'm not gonna be further with again just mention that in passing because like I said I have lots lots and lots of business to take care

[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.600]
Nobody q.a.m. Oh

[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:21.960]
Baby

[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.480]
Don't start with them all my stroke case my good buddy now is concerned about my health and welfare

[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.740]
Right, I think his Alzheimer's kicking and I really do

[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:35.500]
I think the weight of that muskrat on his head has started to affect what used to be his brain

[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:41.400]
Don't you understand him what we hate you you're in denial. We hate you Hank hates you mad dog won't say it on here

[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:44.960]
But he hates you the people in programming they hate you

[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:50.520]
Carlos hates you George really hates you the people are work on your show hate you. I don't want to mention no names

[00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:52.480]
They hate you

[00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:00.920]
So so what's not I mean if you can deal with that deal with it. That's all I can say but don't come sucking around here like you're concerned about my health

[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.260]
The stress and the grief that this man is caused in just over here in this place is

[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:07.620]
incalculable okay

[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:09.160]
incalculable

[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.180]
You couldn't put a measuring stick on it. So just stick it. Well anyway the point yesterday who or what do you fear the most?

[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.300]
We had 1439 votes Carlos pretty impressive. I mean be your boy

[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.360]
We're religious fanatics 474

[00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.060]
George W. Bush 343

[00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.180]
lost their freedoms 182

[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.300]
terrorist 156

[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.460]
Moe Howard David did

[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:35.320]
91

[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:46.860]
John S. Croft 62 World War 61 while he must be listening to James Woolsey

[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:48.480]
about W. W. W.

[00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:52.800]
4 George Rodriguez 47 he's scary and Donald Rumsfeld 23

[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:59.760]
So religious fanatics George Bush and loss of freedoms were the top three and of course I see a lot of similar and a little slap over there

[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.160]
Where we heard

[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:14.880]
One of the air reporters talking to one of them re-insane now USA good USA good we love Bush we love Bush

[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.140]
But whatever they're saying you know

[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:22.300]
Because we made them an offer they couldn't refuse you know, but I'm being that's right just like Santino said in a godfather

[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.040]
He said the being your blood it brains all over you nice side relief suit. That's right

[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.340]
And just don't take no for an answer

[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.940]
So now it's gonna be I'm telling you the people on the other side of this whole war thing

[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.180]
They're just look at this three weeks to the day only three weeks and a tensor runs through Baghdad

[00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:41.360]
They're knocking on those Sodom statues and we liberated the poor Iraqi oppressed people

[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.620]
Right wait till I'm gonna tell you what's really gonna be exciting when we go to Jamaica

[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.100]
You think this was good when we go to Jamaica

[00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.600]
That'd be fantastic especially when we light all those fields on fire

[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.560]
Everybody all the soldiers are gonna be stoned out of their minds

[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:56.900]
Huh Jamaica's on fire

[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.360]
Mon hope it

[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.240]
I hope they bring back the draft for that one

[00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.620]
I just want to hope that their

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.560]
Wind is blowing in the right direction

[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:09.600]
Westwood one said you'll get out of here while we break your legs. So now I sit by the pool life since good is

[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:16.880]
Ingenious with my paladin cocktail placing bets on the jets in paradise paradise. I don't kiss nobody's ass in power

[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.820]

[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:23.900]
But the cleaners aren't ready with my lime green pants. How long does it take?

[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.420]
Killed it calling to play and we just a little thought so what I left this thing

[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:31.980]
I think that's funny when I'm not gonna say which buddy. I can do what I want but the management loves me

[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:36.240]

With that new no one comedy, but so we might have to smit cannet not

[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:10.780]
Well, we took a poll on a yesterday and it won just a little more than 50 video was really very tight

[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.360]
And then the I think the clear channel people were voting on it and they said they liked it a lot

[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:19.300]
I'm trying to get used to where this overhead is now. We got to speaker fixed. It was a loose wire. That's what moths said

[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.360]
He said somebody had a loose uh thing in here

[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.960]

Golf talk or talk about Mo

[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:04.160]
Another good selection. That's great. I'm pulled us up by the way their votes coming in already to trickling in what I'm undecided

[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:08.640]
It was a talk to us. I voted for golf talk myself. I'm the one of what I mean seriously

[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:15.760]
This is just and if I hear anybody else with this Martha Burke and hoody Johnson, you know something a plague on all of them at this point

[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.640]
I don't care anymore

[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:21.720]
You know, we just bagged that is free. They're gonna work it on that statue of Sodom look at look at that kid

[00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:29.640]
Look at that. There's a kid here. They got a noose around the neck of the statue and there's this teenage kid who stand into base trying to figure out how they're going to

[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.680]
Why yank the statue down and that that's something in it and

[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:37.720]
And that continues now and part of this process appears to be an attempt to

[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.480]
Pull the statue down. No, no kidding John John singing thawler there with some real real piercing

[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.200]
Interpretation therefore an MSNBC some great analization. Well that could or what

[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:53.600]
It's like oh yeah one insight you get from the American TV network's man

[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.020]
Here's a kid he's putting a rope around a statue and he's like circling always got that he's got some health now

[00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.360]
He's got another guy a couple of guys

There's three kids there and they're trying to yank this thing down and a statue too

Can you name me seriously other than guilty who I don't I mean guilty was called me even at home

[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.560]
Just practically in tears there a couple of months ago

[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.400]
Wining about what's he gonna do and that show is awful and moe is

[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.520]
Terrorizing him so obviously guilty is in a position. He can't say anything just like mad dog

[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.960]
He wants to stay on those dolphin broadcast mad dog finds him I humanly unacceptable at every level

[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.460]
But name me somebody else in the building who like even remotely is like an ally of his well

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:52.100]
I'll tell you Joe Castello and you wonder why for first of all they have to see each other

[00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:54.720]
You know the crossover because they work in the same studio

[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:59.800]
So it's six every morning. There's that crossover they do and addition which Joe is a was you know

[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:05.800]
No, I love Joe Castello. He's a good guy, but he's a pussy. You know, I can't you can't help himself anything to be non-confrontation

[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.660]
Exactly. He's a very

[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.240]
Seen Joe if you're gonna be in this business. I don't want to tell you how to do your show Joe

[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:15.540]
Because you're a good guy, but be a little bit more outspoken and not so namby pami

[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.880]
You know, well people will text senior citizens. I I don't go for that. Well fine, okay

[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.420]
Just sit there and talk about what a lovely day it is and the birds are singing

[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:25.980]
You know drop a little load on your car and that's it

[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:29.060]
I mean sports motor talk

[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:34.000]
Motor sports that's right. I didn't put it on there, but all out of deference to Joe because he get upset

[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.380]
We don't want to get him all better to shape, but quit being such a pussy. Okay, Joe

[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.120]
Even if he came in here argue because he is a hard-ass. That's the funny thing about her off the air

[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:44.940]
He's a real hard-ass

[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.640]
Which he and his lovely wife. I mean the two of them can you just even imagine the confrontations in that house

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:58.120]
My god world and for both stubborn as a mule. I mean real, but maybe that's good, you know likes a track

[00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:00.420]
One of them will come out alive

[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:05.680]
Here's the fact that says you're right when you say no one cares about the marlins you are absolutely

[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.180]
and

[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:14.120]
It's been that way since day one Dave and boring is a perfect fit for this team. Oh

[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.580]
Yeah, oh, you know, we left one off the list Eric

[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.000]
Preseason Marlins baseball

[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:24.400]
Should be on list or now we don't need to put preseason just marlins baseball

[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:30.580]
Let's add that on there. Okay, you don't have to call him up. I'm sure Eric is listening right now in between this breakfast burritos from burger king

[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:34.580]
I'm maybe he's got a couple of burritos of creams without the beans from

[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.200]
Taco Bell. It's really swell and can you imagine what's gonna be happening now in Iraq and Baghdad?

[00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:45.900]
Can you see the McDonald's going up the taco viva's the taco bells? Huh burger king?

[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.900]
What else are the we're gonna have to give him American Idol on TV?

[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:54.360]
Okay, Mark. Oh Iraqi Idol

[00:34:55.820 --> 00:35:00.080]
Walmart. Oh, yeah, Walmart will be over there those goose steppers. They'll be over there real fast

[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.860]
faster than you can say sing high

[00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:03.440]
high-o-bush

[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:04.460]
right

[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:08.020]
They're gonna have like a gas station at every street corner

[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.800]
Oh 30 cents a gallon a dollar a holler to fill up the tank. Do they have cars over there?

[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.500]
They got plenty of cars over there. Okay, they got pick up trucks. They got cars. They got donkeys. They got a little ass

[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.900]
Look at that down the time and not I guys. I don't think it's gonna work the statue that they're

[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.700]
attacking for those of you who are not near a TV the statue that was like is a gigantic statue

[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:33.660]
It's about no I'd say 25 feet tall

[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.220]
A huge statue of Sodom and it I would say it probably weighs about a ton

[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:40.440]
when you

[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:46.040]
Yeah, or at least a thousand pounds and they've got a a gigantic rope tied around that I've very nicely

[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.840]
They've tied a knot and now they're gonna try to yank it down

[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:53.080]
I have I could be wrong, but I have a feeling that that rope ain't gonna get the job done, you know

[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:57.400]
No way I would say maybe one of the tanks could just everybody could back away in the tank

[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.280]
But after seeing the bad aim on at hotel yesterday. I'm not so sure. That's a good idea

[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:07.340]
You know the shooting at the lobby and the 15th floor gets hit good part. Yeah, so our aim may be a little bit off

[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:13.740]
Kurds are seller. This is in northern Iraq by the way look at the Kurds in way and one guy's got an American flag cap on

[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.060]
And they're like holding up pictures and American flags in USA USA. Let's go. Let's go. I love it

[00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:23.500]
Huh, we can we can export. Okay. In fact, you know something

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.320]
This may be the way to get rid of the Iraqis

[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.580]
We've put enough McDonald's in there

[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.480]
It's working in Europe. They're getting all the same a heart disease and oil clog and all of that good stuff

[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:39.000]
So this may be way to eliminate all of our enemies then they will fear us once they taste that crap and start getting

[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.020]
Of course, I'd better put it off a little walk as the hospitals are a little bit busy right now

[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:51.620]
Anyway, this fax was out of say what makes me crazy about the marlins is this uh, the year the ownership keeps saying come celebrate the 10th anniversary

[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:56.980]
They said the same thing last year marlins first season was 93. So this is their 11th year not 10th. That's right good point

[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:03.360]
Today sports trivia question for the erudgers show when was the last time a city with all four major sports teams

[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:08.260]
Sucks so bad they all miss the playoffs did the marlins make the playoffs last year? No did the heat make the playoffs

[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:10.600]
Did the dolphins make the play out now panthers?

[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.400]
Now I think we're talking about a good point excellent facts from a real chronic factor. Thank you

[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:18.600]
Well, I'm telling you I'm really worked up again today

[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:23.060]
And if I can get that damn ear unplugged then I'm gonna go see my doctor friend if I get that ear unplugged

[00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:23.660]
It's gonna be

[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.980]
Then I'll be dangerous then they will fear me. I'll take that right now. Oh look at all of

[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:35.360]
Votes and they're already pulls only bit up about 10 seconds. We already got 66 votes. Mary, Olamoo, Olamoo would be proud

[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.020]
Bye-bye, but Mary, oh, we love you

[00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.980]
Go Leafs go by the way. Just mention that in passing on you flyer fans

[00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:42.920]
To you, okay? It's gonna be tough

[00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.280]
Gotta be tough

[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.840]
And I notice David Jane the old right in the same swill in the paper again about the Leafs are whiner that you know

[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.620]
You don't know what know a god damn leaf have fell on your ass, okay? You silly goose

[00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:56.700]
You organizations sucking idiot

[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:01.880]
66 votes which of these sends you to the dial to change stations fastest religion talk 16

[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.760]
Georgia's voice 12 Mohawar david's voice 11. We got a battle going on

[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:09.820]
Even your raki's didn't put up in battle is good golf talk 9

[00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:17.140]
Killed his voice 9 hockey talk 3 race track talk 3 talk about mode 2 ward talk 1 and marlin's baseball just went up on her

[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.600]
So give him a chance. They'll start making a move. They'll make their move just like the marlins

[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.660]
That made a movement you can smell it. They're two and six. They're off to a way lower start

[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.940]
Nobody cares if they were six at oh with anybody care now

[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:36.520]
Anyway, if you had a big ball spot the people around you care because they look at you and they see the reflection shining in their head

[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:42.440]
You know, it's not a good thing not a good thing to be like a human beacon like bokeh Brian like Mo without that that animal

[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:45.240]
If you want to look great and younger than you ever believed you could again

[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.140]
There's one guy in the world that can make you do it

[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.260]
I mean there are a lot of other people peddling all kinds of crap

[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:52.920]
Charles Alfieery isn't into those mousey looking things or into those phony looking pieces

[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.640]
He's into the latest technology which is of course his natural hairline system

[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.580]
It looks like real hair like it's going out of your scalp not like a whole bunch of farm animals

[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.820]
Just fell on top of your head from the sky for over 25 years Charlie's been working with a millionaires and in between the shleppers

[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.680]
And even the poor folks goes first of all his systems might be affordable

[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.420]
And secondly no matter how much cash you've got no where can you go and get a better more natural looking system than his natural hairline deal

[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:20.940]
And of course nothing to lose except the ugly balls spot because everybody who goes there gets Charlie's

[00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:24.460]
30-day guadantee if you don't love the way it looks and feels Charlie give you full refund

[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.840]
So you have nothing to lose but that big reflection on your head

[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.160]
And when you mention the arrangers when you call Charles Alfieery they give you an extra 200 bucks off the regular price

[00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.540]
So do it now and look better and younger like a bench like a real guy

We're big

[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:10.760]
In the macho and and and we saw a billboard side today. We don't like that

[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:19.360]
We have balls is not the kind of that we'd like to see

[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.220]
In flying we have any balls with this red presents our team

[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.840]
And we want our name off of the sign

[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:37.120]
Yes, it isn't very nice and so we want to verify the dolphins have no balls

[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.040]
That's for hope billboard signs that we've got

[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:51.300]
Oh

[00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:54.340]
With horrified and so appalled

[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:55.800]
He's

[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:04.700]
Many many lifeless hurricane fans will now be checking inside their pants do I have to

[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.460]
Or am I smooth

[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.780]
Take down that coin

[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:13.360]
Don't have any ball

[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:14.120]
Okay

[00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:19.840]
I

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.840]
Wait to hear this over and David is quite a comfortable. I'm going on any Jones made rumor take down that sign in front of his house

[00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.180]
The one that said rumors balls

[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:34.260]
Dollar-rehealer or whatever the hell it said very upset about that

[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.960]
948 12 minutes till 10 at 560 WQ. We got the mad dog from the masters in Augusta golf talk started

[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.780]
And I want a clock, but he can make it interesting that dog can make anything interesting

[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.540]
You know he really can he's got away with it. He hates mo

[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.340]
3 o'clock we got and Hank go over back in the studio

[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.200]
Maybe the hub broke him an early day. I can see if he lost an answer to

[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.440]
Huh

[00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:01.140]
I haven't seen him in a long time to hopper. I want to make sure and I can also tell him that he's full of crap about the overtime and hockey

[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:05.400]
You know, you just I mean you love he Hank, but don't talk about hockey. Don't know anything about it

[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:07.460]
Over time and hockey is sensational

[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.740]
Especially of course in the playoffs when we play the full you know 20 minute periods, but that's beside the point

[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:17.980]
Uh, Hank 3 to 6 30 6 30 it's Marlins on deck rhymes with Dreck

[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:25.660]
705 the marlins and the match over the pp park and then of course any captain again join Mark overnight tell Joe to grow up here now speaking of the

[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.480]
pp park

[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:34.480]
I noticed in Houston they changed the name of the field from enron field to um, I don't know orio cookie or well whatever it is

[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:41.440]
Feel some of the name because then run obviously is out of business right but pp pro players have been out of business for what about two years

[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.680]
At least and we still call it pro player stadium

[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.180]
Huh, I mean I realized it doesn't make a big difference because nobody cares

[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:53.660]
Although the dolphins still do play there. Why don't they go back to Joe Robby stadium? Huh?

[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.180]
Just just out of common decency even though I realized they don't have any

[00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:01.380]
But some of you guys are still trying to sell the name. Okay, so so in the interim

[00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.760]
Even a way that way is a hard-ass

[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:09.160]
Why can't they just go back to Joe Robby stadium now? He was a hard-ass too, but at least at least he did something

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:11.840]
You know he didn't just talk he didn't run around with his hand up

[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:15.160]
He got the financing done himself. We thank her up to the rest of his family, but nevertheless

[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:17.780]
Uh, you know at least he built us the stadium

[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.700]
Which as far as I'm concerned is a damn nice stadium. All the people complaining about it

[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:25.400]
I don't see anything wrong with that stadium at all. No, that's under the location

[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.840]
I mean you dating Brad right on a county line my god right between the two counties and even from Palm Beach

[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.940]
You can drive down a turn if I can be there like about the ten minutes if you drive real fast

[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:41.220]
No, no seriously the look and you drive in off the turnpike right into the parking lot

[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:44.880]
What not to like? I mean sure the prices are ridiculous, but that's not the stadium

[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:51.480]
I say let's rename it to Joe Robby stadium. Come on. What do you say? No, you jackass you bolted a geek

[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:58.760]
Let's see now. I want to join beener boy and Miguel a treasure island tonight happy hour five to seven p.m

[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.420]
Come on by and catch an eye fool

[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:02.660]
Get an eye fool

[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:10.960]
Maybe you want to wear a surgical mask of the wall the wall lovelies including this week's feature Dana Lee

[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]
Uh Carlos is gonna be over there pawing away trying to get a little touch a little feel a little squeeze

[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]
Try my best

[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.620]
And of course the good news is George is not here this week so might actually get close

[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:26.980]
I'm sure that's what he does over there. I'm sure he's like, you know, rolling around trying hoping to run into somebody

[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:28.960]
Ready to get a appearance

[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.620]
Now I'm not talking about that. We're just getting a little feel

[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.240]
I heard he was a rolling around with fat boy a couple weeks ago

[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:36.100]
Ugly sight

[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:37.840]
They grow test site

[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:43.180]
Okay, five six seven oh five sixty. How's that pull coming out of the new pool? It's a good one as usual

[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:47.180]
Which of these sends you diving to the dial to change change the stations the fastest

[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:50.180]
I sure hope our various dude programming department is checking this out

[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:55.420]
Religion talk 24 see that's George again. He's always done there with his militant anti-religion

[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:57.120]
Okay, I'll tell you one day one

[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.620]
Something he's gonna have to face the Lord to meet his maker

[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.560]
To meet Marvin maker at Monticello raceway

[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.740]
George's voice 21 see that's all George stuff there

[00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.980]
God he's killing this show

[00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:14.840]
Moe Howard David is voice 20 so those three each have over 20 you know the disease in this room is back again

[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.180]
I think you know it's tough was just in here. I think he drops some pellets on a way out

[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.960]
Either that or he's dating a rabbit

[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:27.760]
Duff droppings. Yeah, tough droppings. They look like rabbit droppings to me

[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:32.300]
Uh turn it off on a here golf talk 17. That's moving up the list fast

[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.800]
Oh, is that coma inducing or what?

[00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.560]
Gell these boys 12

[00:45:36.980 --> 00:45:38.280]
12 say Gell these boys

[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.840]
What is them and Gell's talking about what's he that roaps not gonna work

[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:49.160]
Tell us something we don't know okay, but the good news is and at least they better tell us poor kids to get off the guy to him

[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.980]
Because on the base of the monument there they're like banging away with sledge hammers and all kinds of crap

[00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:01.920]
And so that thing is gonna come tumbling down in a second in the meantime they got all these they're gonna be more collateral damage

[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:05.800]
I'm afraid there's all these kids that are up there out mountain of stancho. They're mounting Sodom

[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:11.180]
Now, but they'd like to oh, oh, I bet they love it. Your Moe would like to mount Sodom, huh

[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.440]
Go go go start getting even with the rest of the human race everybody else has been doing Moe

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.740]
Maybe he can start doing Sodom at least to stancho anyway. He can hop on it

[00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.720]
So they got their rope tied around Sodom's neck. I don't think kids. It's gonna work too well

[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.340]
But why don't they show the bottom again you assholes? Who is that? Oh, this is coming from the Arab networks

[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:36.260]
And the good news let me say it again the US is taking over a raki tv and radio. Oh, they're gonna be getting the show pretty soon

[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.460]
That'll change their altitude I guarantee you that wait till they hear douchebag the first time, huh?

[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:46.820]
In fact, I bet you would make a lot of big Moe fans over there in Iraq, you know what?

[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:53.080]
All we got to do is seriously all we got to do is play one drop in you asshole and they'll love it, huh?

[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:55.400]
Can you imagine that be going around high-fiving themselves?

[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:00.320]
And others just this one little kid with that rope, but he's these climbing down it

[00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:07.700]
This is really comical man. It's hysterical show us the base of the statue to monument again you idiots

[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.180]
That's where the good works going on

[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.400]
They're making some progress on it. They're like banging the stones away that things

[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.040]
And you know what's really gonna be bad is when it comes tumbling down

[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:19.500]
You got about 200 people gathered around it now. Uh-oh war collateral damage

[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:22.480]
Say

[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:28.900]
He would will turn 66 if he's still alive at the end of this month, but as we have said

[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:35.460]
I couldn't be at least to wait until his 66 birthday. Is she talking about Mo again? Oh, it's not him. She's talking about that. She's talking about Mo

[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.800]
WDQ I am

[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.920]
Yeah, yeah, sir

[00:47:42.340 --> 00:47:45.840]
Hey, don't good morning to you and when is the astus sir?

[00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:51.860]
You've been asking all week long. I'm trying to get through with this war. It's really up to us. Yeah, what's it all about?

[00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:57.640]
I have a different opinion. Okay, everybody else. Okay, we have to do it Mr. Bush's legacy

[00:47:57.640 --> 00:47:59.080]
If you think back to the last

[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.580]
3040 years, let me present it and had a legacy, you know, Kennedy was a bay of pig

[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.560]
Nixon with water gate

[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.080]
Regulment control

[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:13.240]
And our boy Clint, you know, he had a legacy of getting a little, you know extra activity in the White House, you know

[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:17.800]
But that wasn't your legacy. That was their like week link. That was their weakest link

[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.860]
Yeah, I know. It was the

[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:19.800]
Tink in the room for

[00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:24.240]
Yeah, what they're known for. If you think about that president, that's what they're known for at that time

[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:29.120]
You know, and your seniors that is that Bush senior was a wimp being on for a wimp and backing out of Iraq

[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.640]
Right, right and you hear him and CNN they just renamed Baghdad

[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.640]
Is he on Bush guardians now?

[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.060]
I love it. Okay. Thanks a lot, man

[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:43.980]
He was pretty weak until he got to that. That was excellent Bush guardians, uh, west

[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.420]
Let's see 16 Iraqis died trying to knock down statues store in 30 minutes. That's bad. Somebody factors me

[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.840]
That's that's really bad plus a city a lot more 16 if that thing

[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:59.280]
No, seriously, they're like working on it. They got at least 200 people pounded and banging at one four

[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.940]
What somebody else give them some help maybe a 30-day

[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.640]
You want to like the only sledgehammer in town because he's just banging away on that thing

[00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:06.460]
banging

[00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:12.460]
Between the statue and the money, but it's got away a ton got to minimum because that's heavy duty stuff

[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.660]
You know, I say more than that. They spirit no expense in building all of that crap with that oil money, you know

[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.740]
Just banging and pounding the poor kids with a rope. You know, what am I gonna say? You got to laugh

[00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.620]
It's comical. I mean they mean well. They're giving it the best shot

[00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.180]
But I don't think you're gonna be able to yank him down with a rope

[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:33.640]
What they would like to do is get the real sedom like Mussolini and hang his ass upside down in the middle of town

[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:38.380]
Like they did with Mussolini now. Have you ever seen those pictures? Those were the best. That was great

[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.380]
First they were already dead, but I mean the hungry bodies of him is uh his lady friend

[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:43.380]
Mussolini

[00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:49.620]
Anyway, here's a fact that says extending the order to a rack would have incurred inculcurable human and political cost

[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.280]
We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad in effect rule Iraq

[00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:57.180]
The coalition would instantly have collapsed and the Arabs deserting an anger at other allies pulling out as well

[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.560]
Exceeding the UN's mandate would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression

[00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:07.920]
We hope to establish had we gone the invasion route the US could still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land

[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.320]
That's a direct coach from George Bush senior and Brent Scowcroft in time magazine 1998 why we didn't remove Saddam

[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.160]
How do you like that? I just mentioned that in passing

[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:17.420]
Okay

[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.540]
Since the guy brought it up about pop a bush

[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.960]
Pop a bush and mama lapinga

[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.380]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty oh here's a good

[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.120]
PR Ralph says

[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.480]
Baghdad is free. Yeah

[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.580]
So Jeff from pizza lock just set a plane with a banner look for his brand newster as soon also a new crystals

[00:50:38.580 --> 00:50:44.100]
Plus a new ball team and a stake in shaking a royal castle. I'm telling you. We'll cloud the arteries by the middle of June, huh

[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:50.060]
Just imagine all of the things we can export over there now all a great American businesses, huh the dollar signs

[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:56.720]
Just flashing my what what am I missing? I think they got some help now that looks like a tank that came in there to I don't know

[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.440]
It's gonna help them out

[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:03.560]
Oh, yeah, we got a big it's a tank is either want to help and take the statute or or something else what we got bad aim

[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.460]
We're not trying to get them, but we got bad aim lately

[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.740]
They're handing out the free passes for the paradise hotel or is it the oh?

[00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:16.680]
Look at the what now what's the tank doing? But Iraqis who are still willing to fight there was a lot of them out there

[00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:20.440]
We still need to get up to to create other parts of the country. So

[00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:28.060]
Cauchy's optimism is the way I would describe it. Oh my god 10 a.m. Vice President Cheney's gonna speak. We'll be listening to some of that, okay

[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:35.200]
958 at 560 WQ I just popped a couple of only a minute in my push and look how great I look in sound right now

With his name's Bush he's a hemorrhoid in the Toshir he picked the guy who would die so we be alone there's nothing in his empty

[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:18.920]
Military

[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.620]
Power of his weapons but by the character of the men and women who serve

[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:32.240]
Since the war our forces have conducted themselves with all of the skill and integrity

[00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:38.160]
The present Bush and the American people expected of them except for the friendly fire

[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:44.920]
Operations continue all across Iraq securing cities except for the Abaddheim on hotel

[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:48.280]
Delivering tons of humanitarian aid

[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:55.220]
And downtown Baghdad this morning we're seeing evidence of the collapse of any central regime authority

[00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.500]
And the statue too don't forget about that dick

[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:04.660]
So anyway Greg Regis comes rushing in here breathlessly and says to me how many people are gonna die if that statue comes to me now real quick

[00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.240]
And I said how many Greg and he said

[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.320]
He is obsessed with that he is really a sick puppy, I'll tell you

[00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.100]
He also said he does hate mo

[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.940]
Here's the fact from Josh in Chicago who says let me start by being a little I'm not gonna leave that chanye stuff on oh my god

[00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:24.220]
Talk about an evil doer. He really he is evil baby. He is evil incarnate

[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:31.160]
Truth can not come from that man. Yeah, the truth will set your free dick and you give it to us now the truth either

[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.300]
Josh in Chicago faxed and says let me start by being a little nostalgic

[00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:41.800]
I've been listening for over 10 years neither time zones nor distance can stop me from listening to somebody tell it like it is

[00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:49.600]
I was thinking yesterday about the best moments in recent memory on your show. Here's my list number one fox news Heather possibly the best radio I've ever heard

[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:57.680]
Two mo he's been a godsend not for people that listen during his hours those that listen to your show he's a godsend as in

[00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:01.040]
Three the guy who's saying kneels away normally

[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.720]
I imagine you'd have dumped the call but it was so spontaneous that it worked

[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.680]
I kept thinking he was finished, but it kept singing and singing it was awesome for your first day of QA

[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:12.000]
I'm that no compete stuff sucks and five every time you come back from vacation

[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.060]
man

[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.380]
Somebody give me a towel please

[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.200]
Wow, this is unbelievable

[00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.260]
Please enough talking on a different subject isn't it legal to coin to international law for one nation?

[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:27.820]
Was assassinate the leader of another nation? We are clearly targeting him. So why isn't anybody making a stink about this

[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:32.520]
Tell Mo what I know is that he's wearing my cat on this and I want mr. whiskers back

[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.740]
Thank you josh and chicano have a wonderful life, okay, and it will warm up someday

[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:41.260]
Here's one that says give them a damn grenade already the hammer won't do it

[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:43.400]
The hammer won't do it

[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:48.580]
He's busy. Okay, he's busy making bets now. Does he collecting from his bookie? How is that oh they're not showing that?

[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.000]
Anyway, there it is I heard a ground fighters couldn't I not seen I don't want to hear changing

[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.960]
I want to hear the play by play on the

[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.360]
Saddam statue coming out in Baghdad

[00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:01.160]
Damn it all we're gonna now the kicking pictures of a Sodom ripping up the card

[00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:06.040]
Convergence yeah, he put him on because I'm expecting somebody to be from there. Tell us what's going on

[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:09.560]
And we keep hearing a sad tragical man with the uh gimpie heart

[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:15.400]
Rip it up pictures of Sodom and there's the photographer's taking a picture of a little photo off form

[00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:22.040]
Rip it up baby stop on it kick that mother scratcher. Okay, and by the way, he's dead we think and if not who cares

[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:26.720]
And let me say it again in case you missed it the Iraqi information minister who was even better

[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:29.380]
He did a better stand-up back than George Carlin. He's disappeared

[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:35.720]
He vanished with a sack of cash probably with a bunch of denars and in fact probably rumor hopes to buy him a few denars

[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:37.120]
You think?

[00:56:38.300 --> 00:56:40.360]
He hopes anybody buys him a few denars

[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:47.440]
So anyway, there they are and they're uh celebrating and they're having a great time in the liberty proud of Iraq now

[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.580]
Let's let's hear Jesse say liberty power Iraq

[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:55.600]
Which on a one hand I understand this is this is the moment that the hawks have awaited for all look

[00:56:55.600 --> 00:57:00.260]
Look at what a great job we did. Okay, so there's thousands of dead people and about a hundred dead Americans

[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:04.600]
At least that they're admitting so far and a whole bunch of brits or dead which most of which we killed them

[00:57:04.600 --> 00:57:05.320]
But that's okay

[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.800]
Because that's the price you have to pay for liberty pada iraq

[00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:18.040]
There's going to be an exon station on every corner there be a VP more uh, uh, uh, uh, what amaco right across the street exon kitty corridor that

[00:57:19.560 --> 00:57:21.600]
There'll be a Baptist church under the other corner

[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:27.960]
No Catholic church. They don't want no part of them. Sorry. You lose papa. That'll teach you to be against the war

[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:31.420]
That's right. They're going to go over there and Christianize those heathen bastards

[00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:36.600]
No more of this to muslim stuff you watch by the end of this month all the one billion muslims on the face of the earth are going to be

[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.000]
We're in little of Jesus. They're going to have like a cross under dashboard

[00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:44.320]
They are they're going to have a little Jesus a little of virgin Mary thingo. I'm sorry. That's a Catholic's again

[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:52.420]
5670560 pound 560 the statues still standing they've they've wiped away at the base of that baby pretty good

[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:56.520]
They've done some heavy duty damage, but it's got a way about what I say about 25 tons

[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:01.760]
Get one of those tanks. They tried to come and hear one of our tanks. There's a get just loaned to us for a while

[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:04.600]
They do it. I'm a chariot cry. Huh? Yep. There goes

[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:10.780]
There goes what a tank going for the statue. Is it really? Yeah? Well, they know that no that's earlier

[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:17.220]
See, you know, you don't understand. Where are you? Why am I listening to you that the inset? What are what channel are you watching CNN?

[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.440]
Well, I'm not watching CNN. It's it's gonna hit it

[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:24.080]
Here comes the tank and the tank is going after the statue like I said

[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:25.600]
MSNBC sucks

[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:30.940]
Exactly how it's going to open over or what exactly it's going to do this is read

[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.720]
This is one more fun to watch in Amarland's

[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:38.220]
To the tank and attempt to pull the statue off to dump over

[00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:46.520]
These Iraqi civilians it at first started pelting the statue with shoes a couple hours ago

[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:52.620]
And we picked up the shot about an hour ago when someone had actually scaled the pedestal the statue with a ladder

[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.740]
Try to you know who it was. I saw them same went back down to the pedestal

[00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:03.180]
And I all we could see was one axe that they seemed to be whacking. Well, let me ask you a question

[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:10.580]
Exactly. It's a very large statue and doing it that way would take a long time

[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.980]
No shmit man heavy duty inalization again. They're for you

[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:20.700]
So they would help out the American Marines. They've got one of the tanks. There's that one of their tanks. They don't have any tanks left

[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.060]
We're using one of our tanks to assist them in one of their first acts under a free Baghdad and a liberated Baghdad

[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:31.380]
And that is to knock down this big disgusting statue because the rope didn't work too good

[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.600]
To save that rope from one if we still find them alive. Okay, save the rope

[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.080]
Look now they'll climb the knot and now all the kids are climbing on top of the tank

[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:44.480]
Are you sure this isn't the tank that was just left in the middle of the street then they look like an old beaten up

[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:49.300]
That's not an American tank. It's not a tank. It's an armored personnel carrier or something excuse me

[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:52.760]
I didn't know that you were so militaristic. I mean

[00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.220]
So there they are

[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:06.920]
Be sure to take a lot of photos. They'll be selling at Walmart. They'll have the commemorative edition

[01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:12.940]
Oh, yeah by the end of the by the weekend that the bash that a Walmart he'll have at least six locations all around the country

[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:18.580]
Here's the fact from Tom says the raki's look happy wait till they start working 16 hours at in sweatshops

[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.760]
Come on Tom hop on a bad wagon baby liver time USA USA

[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:26.980]
Illiana Ross lightning for a cheap jackass

[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.780]
PS where you want aspirin therapy when you had that mini stroke uh, no

[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.500]
I was taking a baby aspirin. What's that mean?

[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.400]
No, I just uh, I don't know. It's fat

[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:42.160]
I was fat and sitting on my ass every day doing a exercise. I don't want to be hash all of that

[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.480]
It was a pulmonary embolism very similar to what the David Bloom died from

[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:49.160]
And what a tragedy that was just like the tragedy of all these lost lives

[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:52.960]
All these children they showed pictures yesterday finally after three weeks

[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.560]
They showed all these gruesome pictures that made you want to cry

[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.560]
But hey see now again. It's all it's all the images if we only would have had tv during

[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.780]
At least the live coverage during Vietnam if we would have had satellite technology

[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:09.160]
Instead of listening to all the propaganda the lies that they told us just like it

[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.800]
We heard the lies about that patriot missile for on behalf of the Raytheon company from Normie Schwartzkopf

[01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:18.960]
He would never lie what he sure did that's what Moshe Aaron said and Moshe Aaron's nobody named Moshe ever lies

[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.980]
Well, I'll just be trying to suggest something

[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:28.600]
567 of 560 pound 560 on the air we will interrupt commercials all programming as soon as the statue topples

[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:33.380]
Okay, because this is one of the highlights of our life is watching that say these not that it's a big deal

[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:36.460]
But it's the symbolic value right of the statue like

[01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.100]
Going down

[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.440]
Now we got somebody again, and I see climbing the rope or is he coming back down?

[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:45.020]
He's coming back down he went up he went up to put one thing get somebody

[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.460]
like like they like they

[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.100]
Like in Vegas. I'm getting tongue-tied you see that haven't you when they when they blow up all the cute old casinos

[01:01:55.620 --> 01:01:59.940]
If you've never seen it on the travel channel they show that about 10 times today sit up all the bomb yeah

[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:05.320]
They set up all the the one of the charges the charge. Thank you. I'm getting tongue-tied because I'm so excited

[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.440]
That we finally have liberated Baghdad

[01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:11.740]
I can't hear you with the mic off

[01:02:11.740 --> 01:02:17.260]
Oops, they put that guy they send that guy up to put a chain around them instead of a rope a shame a shame

[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:24.580]
Huh, I don't think that's gonna do it either guys. They can think ways what I say 7,500 pounds

[01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:29.720]
And they were attacking it would like a it's kind of like the way the Iraqi army defended Baghdad

[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.980]
It's the same kind of you know attacking a gorilla with a BB

[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:38.500]
Robozo it's 11 past 10 at 560 wq. I am on a great day man

[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.920]

[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:53.140]

The proceeding message has been brought to you by the Iraqi tourism council

[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:28.760]
Okay

[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.880]
Everybody's backed off the back of the statue

[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:44.660]
Not yet

[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:48.560]
There's a little punk kid almost jumped up on there

[01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:52.240]
Well, there's always going to be a little collateral damage during these heroic moments

[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:54.700]
There's always going to be you know a few bodies to be dragged away

[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:57.640]
But you're you're looking at the little picture. You got to look at the big picture

[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:00.980]
Okay, the symbolism of this magnificent event. Okay. I think they're getting ready

[01:06:08.460 --> 01:06:08.780]
Go

[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:12.660]

I hope it's the soldiers and throwing them into the crowds. Yeah, I think they're getting looted

[01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:42.660]
That that's throwing like paper airplanes at the stats. You hope and then we'll get the job done

[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:47.300]
Well, they never were really good fighters. You don't case you haven't noticed they never were really great fighters

[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.040]
WQ am

[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:07.660]
Hello

[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.140]
I just wanted to say in passing that

[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:15.220]
When Coleman Powell did his show at tell at the UN

[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:16.300]
after

[01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:23.600]
He had a press conference and somebody asked him if you Americans knew where the weapons of men's destruction are

[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:27.940]
Why didn't you just tell the UN inspectors right and Coleman Powell said well?

[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.340]
We're looking at ways that we can get him that information

[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:35.180]
Well today begins week four in Iraq if we know where they are

[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:40.260]
Where are they we're still looking man? Where are they buddy? We did find some press the side

[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:40.780]
Rummy

[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.600]
Don't be so negative man. We're not going to stat you down get with it

[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:51.020]
Yeah, but you don't 50% of Americans now say we don't care if you find them or not

[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.480]
What kind of bullshit is that exactly because you deal with them in brainwash very nicely congratulate him on a great job of

[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:03.280]
Brainwashing. Oh now what I broke the rope broke. Oh no. Geez the rope broke

[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.160]
Well, first of all what were they going to use the rope for anyway the rope isn't going to hold

[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:12.100]
They were going to attach the rope to the tank and like back it up. Oh give me a break. Okay

[01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:17.540]
Like I said their tactics never were like really all that great. They weren't great military tacticians, you know

[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:24.880]
Poison gas that worked pretty good with the Iranians, but and the Kurds, but as far as like Yankeen statues down not too great at least in Baghdad

[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.780]
So now there's the rope was just hanging

[01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.660]
So strong it's waving the breeze and they must be really demoralized about that

[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:37.840]
Just when we thought we're going to pull them down and they pulled us back in

[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.880]
Here's a good article by the way. It's on our website by Brian Reed in the UK mirror

[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:46.800]
It was all planned long ago in line with what this gentleman just said

[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:52.720]
He says take pride in the courage of our board now. He's talking about the British take pride in the courage of our boys

[01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.760]
Fear relieved your building society shares are soaring and enjoy the Hollywood choreography as America races the stars and stripes and bag that

[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:04.480]
But amid all the back slapping take a second to ask yourself a couple of crucial questions about this illegal

[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:09.180]
Iraq why and with whose authority are we there a quick recap

[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.200]
Washington first set a rag needed invading because it had links with al-Qaeda never proven

[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:19.260]
Then it was to remove weapons of mass destruction, but you and inspectors found none and the allies haven't so far

[01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:24.620]
On Sunday typically eloquent u.s. Brigadier general Vincent Brooks said the places. It's most likely to be found

[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.920]
We haven't even gotten to them yet

[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.620]
Which presumably means parts of Baghdad Saddam was still holding so why hasn't the heartless monster used them against us?

[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:38.880]
Is it because he has none in which case? Why did we invade or why didn't he use them because of the appalling consequences in which case?

[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:39.780]
Why did we invade?

[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.340]
But of course weapons aren't this month's excuse for toppling Saddam now

[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.740]
We're told it's about liberating the people from a vicious dictator

[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:49.500]
If you believe that you believe Bush's crucial vote in Florida was not rigged

[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.040]
Saddam Hussein is an evil despot who's killed his own people to stay in power

[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.180]
We know this because when he was our friend in the 1980s

[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.900]
We colluded in those atrocities by supporting him with arms

[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:01.940]
But do you know how many more evil regimes currently operate?

[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.480]
Do you have any idea how many more current evil regimes there are Carlos?

[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:06.500]
Thought third man

[01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:11.980]
Tries in Bobway where opponents of Robert McAvoy are arrested and tortured why not invade there

[01:11:11.980 --> 01:11:14.040]
So why don't the coalition put things right?

[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:20.020]
The answer is simple either corporate America doesn't need the regime change there or military America couldn't pull it off

[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:25.720]
The truth about this grossly immoral war is that America's right wing pro-Israeli politicians planned to out-sautom

[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:32.620]
Years ago 9-11 gave them the cover to destroy the most powerful Arab state readraw them at least and control the earth's second biggest oil reserves

[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.320]
Ask yourself again why we've invaded a sovereign state

[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:40.440]
How would you feel if China eventually decides to make Britain a puppet state and drives its tanks into the palace of West

[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:40.780]
Minister

[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:45.700]
We have a moral case to oppose them or like the Iraqis who tread on our splotter cluster bombs

[01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:47.360]
Well, we not have a leg to stand on

[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.680]
Think about it good article air by a Brian Reed in the UK mirror

[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:55.540]
Think about it. Are they thinking about it? No, they're thinking about this statue

[01:11:55.540 --> 01:12:00.840]
That's what we got to work on right now. We got statues to work on man and a bunch of old pictures that we got in tear apart

[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.920]
raw raw siss boom that's right. Let's hear it in fact. Where's the uh, what do we got in here? We have god bless America

[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.140]
Well, I must have something very patriotic oh

[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:16.100]
Oh, I know a wait a minute. I know what we got oh

[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.040]
Canada

[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.120]
Ha, that's the wrong one

[01:12:21.860 --> 01:12:28.440]
567 05 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and for rice not getting a lot of calls about those Stanley Cup playoffs because they start tonight

[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.280]
And I know that this town is just wild about probably even hangs gonna be watching some of that huh

[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.600]
WDQ I am

[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.520]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir

[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:41.300]
Um, did you hear something on the news yesterday about uh

[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:47.960]
Somebody paying $45,000 and then to put a ad in the emphasis those monical the peach

[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:50.720]
I

[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.780]
Didn't hear it

[01:12:55.440 --> 01:13:01.480]
But uh they might as well take the money and flush it down the turlid. I'm gonna subscribe to that paper right now. Okay

[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:05.360]
Um, that story you read last Friday on that uh

[01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:13.480]
On bush and it's mentality uh because he lacks wisdom. I was looking for that on your website. I couldn't find it. I wanted to print it out

[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:17.220]
Is it there story that he lacks wisdom?

[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.000]
Yeah, that was in every story that we've been reading. Yeah, that's true. You got a point there

[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:23.100]
Uh

[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:30.220]
And closing that guy to fact if I say we're paying I love that guy that uh deals way that was great

[01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:32.340]
I was great. We might play that today. I'll kill some good time

[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:37.420]
Uh, could I put in a request for some I'm hurting all right? Sure no problem now. Whatever you want

[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:42.220]
We're in a great mood today. We got that statue coming down. How about the old popcorn song

[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.080]
But balls

[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:44.560]
But balls

[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:48.220]
Oh but beads

[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.580]
Yeah, okay, okay. Thanks. Okay. I think that was a requested more ways than one

[01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.560]
He said stick those but balls. Oh we can't say that. We don't want to get down to Shalately all upset again

[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.740]
And especially Eddie Jones. He's having a problem with rumors balls

[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:06.140]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T line. They're working on that statue man

[01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.340]
I had a Christian mentioned there was a sign

[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:11.920]
Hold up by some Iraqis which in in no uncertain terms

[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:15.760]
Told them to go home, but mostly it's got a amusement

[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.660]
seemingly that the it is very me lucky's

[01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:24.140]
See them with some amusement perhaps is my limited impression from here

[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.340]
Simon as we lost our signal with you we caught up with

[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:36.260]
We we actually gave us a new information the vice president dick cheney saying this morning quote

[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:39.420]
We are seeing the collapse of the central regime authority

[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:45.080]
That's according to Reuters that he apparently said then is that Paula where you stop that's news

[01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:50.260]
That's news they've been having us on here all morning. There is no millet. There's no uh 30 year-old

[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:52.240]
There's no government. There's no presence there

[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.080]
Maybe they're gonna put them under the tree in December once we've crystallized them. Don't you think

[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:01.900]
They're saving a presence for Christmas and Hanukkah when we uh Judy eyes them

[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.820]
Now forget about those two those two won't cover the Baptist man. They got it. They got this looked

[01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:11.360]
In fact, Jan and Paul Crotch are already putting up a TV tower and Baghdad. I think they already have one there

[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:14.540]
Do they really? I'm serious wouldn't surprise me. They got him everywhere

[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.520]
Jan and Paul Crotch

[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:19.820]
With Iraqis it's uh

[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:23.240]
Now what are they talking to colleagues who were working in southern Iraq?

[01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:25.800]
Are the overwhelming impression that everyone has got

[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.760]
Is that until a town in secure and vast party officials and local

[01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:33.780]
Military officials have been

[01:15:35.820 --> 01:15:40.780]
Nutri-ized either killed I guess by American forces or put under

[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:44.480]
I guess these are all people that don't have to go to work today, huh or school

[01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:48.160]
I'm out of the streets. I'm with seeing now. I don't feel

[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:53.960]
Just want to lighten things up a little bit. Okay. Don't get so tense and depressed everybody. Okay. I mean we're in South Florida

[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:55.420]
We got a problem. I'm so our own to deal with

[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:58.460]
If you don't believe me just open a window and take a whiff

[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:01.260]

It was a little operator error because we're getting all whipped up above the statue, which I think is primarily your fault

[01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.580]
5 and a local

you see

[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:24.520]
it's a legal drug

[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.060]
regarding true

[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.680]
and good

[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:28.880]
and old

[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.680]
I will see

[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:33.740]
God

[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:45.560]
Oh, can it best be?

[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:55.160]
Oh, can it best be?

[01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:03.420]
Oh, can it best be?

[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:09.600]
Okay, here we go. They've got an extension on the tank.

[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.660]
They've got a crane, maybe they're going to work.

[01:19:13.780 --> 01:19:15.220]
Not that they've done an extension.

[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:18.280]
Go! On account of three.

[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:19.260]
I don't know, ready yet?

[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.280]
No, unless they want to kill that guy.

[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:22.900]
This is through in some project, you know?

[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:27.640]
It's a damn good thing that the armlet here was a lot more hip than they are in not going to a statue down.

[01:19:28.200 --> 01:19:29.640]
Let's get one of guys. Come on.

[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:36.280]
Take out a building, take out statues, take out various symbols of bodies.

[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:37.480]
Take out some Kentucky fried.

[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.240]
5, 6, 7, 8, I'm telling you, we're going to export some real cocoa over there.

[01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:47.180]
It's going to be great. It'll be really good to get some of those deflated stocks up there like McDonald's.

[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:50.360]
It's in the crap. Look at that phone.

[01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:53.680]
Look at this phone. There's not a call on it. We're doing screenless. We're having a great day today.

[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:57.340]
And I take a look over, get ready to punch up a bunch of calls and you people are going to be like that.

[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:58.940]
You want to know why they're all watching the statue.

[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.920]
Okay, well we can play that game.

[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.160]
Say I've done that enough.

[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:09.260]
Here we got some guy climbing up on the extension, right up face to face with Sardiner.

[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:10.440]
He gave me a little kiss, I said.

[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:20.180]
As a matter of fact, if you see the picture of the soldier, one of the Iraqis was so happy that he was being liberated.

[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:24.400]
He tried to kiss him on a cheek and the soldier turned his head like, ah, not us.

[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.560]
We're a macho guys.

[01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:29.180]
I think that's what he said. Maybe he said later on when it gets dark.

[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:33.620]
Anyway, the way and the scene with where this ties a turn,

[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:36.780]
but it'll be interesting to see how they do finding.

[01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.840]
You can't complain about that Iraqi technology, baby, because they don't have any.

[01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:42.900]
The sort of 70s scientists thought he'd out people use.

[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:47.020]
World teachers have been in out there. Spiral gun, meltback, razor flag.

[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:49.840]
What is this? This is one of the Marines, isn't it?

[01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:52.700]
Yeah, this is a Marine who's putting an American flag around.

[01:20:54.380 --> 01:20:58.280]
This is great. He's putting the American flag over Sodom's push.

[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:01.060]
Yeah, right over his head. Look at that.

[01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:06.960]
You talk about a dog and pony show, huh?

[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:10.220]
The talking news had networks would have compared $1 billion.

[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:17.440]
Yeah, the Marines said you're a bunch of ineptish.

[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:18.960]
We're going to come in here and do a right.

[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.020]
Okay, you guys couldn't you couldn't look a stamp.

[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:24.460]
Much less our army. So there you go. They're doing it.

[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:27.860]
As we watch this picture, Christy on one of the ads.

[01:21:27.980 --> 01:21:32.300]
Like I said, they're powerful pictures, baby, but of course what you see is not necessarily what you get or what they're going to get.

[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:36.720]
Let's enjoy while we can. It's a hoot WQ I am.

[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:38.980]
Yeah. Nail? Yes, sir.

[01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:44.320]
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm not watching the statue. I'm out here on 820.

[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.260]
You're missing a hell. You'll see later on the news, man. It's great.

[01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:52.440]
Oh, I can't wait to see it. I got the American flag and tarylie wrapped over Sodom's head.

[01:21:55.340 --> 01:21:59.420]
I can't wait to get home and watch channel seven news might say.

[01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:03.040]
They'll have it on every 15 minutes.

[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:05.140]
Hey, I got a 20.

[01:22:06.460 --> 01:22:08.660]
Today, you some play this song.

[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:12.140]
Nobody's six in one anymore. Can you play that?

[01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:16.140]
You know something I love that bit. And I don't know what they'll judge. I'll try to find it.

[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.920]
Okay, see with that little pinhead did with that disc. Thank you.

[01:22:18.920 --> 01:22:20.440]
Thank you. Have a great day. Have a great day.

[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:21.440]
Hey, off the pal metal, man.

[01:22:22.660 --> 01:22:24.120]
Good luck to you. Oh, he's on the pal metal.

[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:29.260]
Oh, there's fat boy wobbling in here right in the middle of the show. What is he doing in here? Doesn't he get the memo? What do you want?

[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:31.120]
What is he saying?

[01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:32.320]
It's a treasure island.

[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.420]
Oh, he's talking to you. Okay. Good. Talk to him. I don't want to talk to you.

[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:39.700]
So there we go. The Marines are off.

[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.160]
And after three weeks in the desert, they probably mount almost anything at this point.

[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.140]
And Christian, the American flag.

[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.060]
They took the flag off his head.

[01:22:47.160 --> 01:22:50.620]
I'm going to say it looks like they're either repositioning the fly or taking it down.

[01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:55.580]
It reminded me of something I think we actually witnessed together in live television out of uncoaster.

[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.000]
I know what they're going to do with the flag.

[01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:00.500]
Yeah, that's what they're going to do with it. Stick it right up, sit down, shoot.

[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:09.380]
Fort and there was so much reaction from the civilians who were so angry about that show of what they called American period.

[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:11.240]
Isn't that flag came down within minutes?

[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:17.680]
Yes. And that's basically being what has happened in other instances as well.

[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.840]
I mean, you know, that they don't want to look like an occupation army.

[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:25.640]
They don't want to. Oh, you see, F Kenny. Yeah, he's I know we get some of this. He's given me the sea.

[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.640]
I told you so near there. Now they're partying. Well, we'll see how long that lasts.

[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.100]
Okay, don't get too carried away, Mr. Hachot, Mr. Genius, Mr. Rocket scientist.

[01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:39.520]
In addition to which all of the collateral damage those dead people and the people that are wounded like falling apart in the hospital, they're not in on the party.

[01:23:40.020 --> 01:23:46.260]
They said, call us when a party started to center apologies. We can't make it because we're either really badly injured or dead thousands of us.

[01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:47.820]
But that's beside the point you see, F Kenny.

[01:23:48.380 --> 01:23:52.760]
Very for our children's funeral. Just get your whole life to that little 17 in screen.

[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:58.820]
You're looking into your 25 or 52 inch tube and get all your information about life in the world right to that screen, man.

[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:02.300]
Let them mesmerize you and obviously they did a good job.

[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:07.300]
Let's see, here's one from some fact. I mean, some guy my partner and I were talking about the funniest thing yesterday.

[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.740]
We had a list of people you talk about who have appeared on your show who we would get it on with.

[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:16.460]
Oh, who would you pick? Al Goldstein.

[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:19.640]
No, no, no, no, no. Greg Reed.

[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:21.500]
No, George. No, no, no. Humber.

[01:24:22.860 --> 01:24:29.060]
No, mad dog. No, Geldie. No, Josh Friedman. No, Troy. No, Carlos. No, no, no, no, no, no, Miguel.

[01:24:30.100 --> 01:24:30.460]
Yes.

[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.940]
P.D. Lenny. It says we know when he looks like you don't mind when we look at him.

[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:36.060]
Wimmer. No, no, no, no, no. Joe Zagaki.

[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:42.800]
Oh, and it says please play him going whatever it is he goes. Where the hell is him going like?

[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.920]
Oh, my, oh, my or Wayne, I think I know. Talk about a tough choice. I'd have to abstain.

[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.960]
He says, I guess he never seen Miguel. Hey, Miguel, ain't your type. Okay. Sweetheart or the other way around.

[01:24:53.040 --> 01:25:00.400]
Are they doing it? They're going to put any raki flag up there. I thought that was pretty in bad taste of us to go put the American flag when all these are rakis are there in their city.

[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:08.520]
Well, don't you forget we did that the first day in Bosnia there. We're in all of a sudden. Is that not a good idea? Yank it down because it makes it look like an occupation when you do that.

[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:13.460]
Here was sitting here tittering because it was amusing, but it's not saying they took it down for that reason. It was not a good idea.

[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:18.340]
Put your raki flag. Didn't we say that your rakis are going to run their country? Didn't we make that up? I mean, say that.

[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:24.380]
Wally in dear field says, where is the janitor in a water graph model, wake up compound busting tank when you need it.

[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:28.500]
Nice going, Wally as usual.

[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:37.740]
Yeah, Janet don't need no tanks. She just yanked that baby down her endowment, Shalela. They go there and just yanked that. She knocked it over with the red pickup truck easy.

[01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:56.340]
It's vacuum. It points to a very dangerous vacuum because you know, look, let's let's face it. I think the original the original idea by the politicians by the so-called coalition of Britain and the USA was that you know,

[01:25:56.340 --> 01:26:06.460]
a little costically, Christian police forces would fall on side and they would sort of immediately turn to sort of policing the new Iraq, the free right that the regular

[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:15.940]
militias, the army, the Republican Guard would would join in the sort of, you know, building and maintaining a border and construction of the new Iraq.

[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:29.820]
Well, that hasn't happened and there is a vacuum and the question is who fills that vacuum and we've seen in other areas in another country that we've been in these kinds of situations where unless there is a quick,

[01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:36.320]
a quick attempt to fill that vacuum, there can be a period of.

[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:46.380]
And you know, disorder and looting to a sure glad we didn't see a looting it 20 before 11 at 560 WQ way I'm not telling you one thing they sure have their TV thank

[01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:52.880]
out for that now we control that would be a good poll question and let's do that tomorrow. That's going to be tomorrow's poll question.

[01:26:53.060 --> 01:27:00.020]
What's the first thing Iraqi should see on TV or here on radio? Huh? Since we're more controlling it now, in case you tune in late,

[01:27:00.020 --> 01:27:09.360]
America does control Iraqi TV and radio now. I'm thinking maybe I'll do it for free. Oh, I don't think they want to I don't think the American government wants to put me on.

[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:23.580]
No, I want to put me on here much less over there. Condoleez al-Amsoir. 19 till 10 at 560 WQ if you're not sleeping good tonight, maybe you got something wrong with your or maybe there's a very good chance that your mattress has something wrong with it like it's

[01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:30.560]
finished like Sodom. Well, here's the answer for you get you a great new name brand mattress and I guarantee you when you call dial amateurs that's exactly what you're going to have happen

[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:37.380]

[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.320]
David's bitch.

[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:33.080]
Oh Sarah.

[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:33.940]
Oh Jim.

[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:35.580]
Sarah.

[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:36.760]
Sarah.

[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.640]
Shouldn't we be using you know.

[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:42.200]
Oh don't worry. I'm using the new sponge.

[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:42.880]
Oh?

[01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:43.960]
Mm-hmm.

[01:28:44.860 --> 01:28:46.020]
Hi guys.

[01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:49.240]
I just love these dead together.

[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.360]
Don't you?

[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:51.360]
Who's this?

[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:52.620]
Um, Jim.

[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:54.540]
This is Bob.

[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.160]
Nice to meet you Jim.

[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.360]
Hey, I got a great idea.

[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.480]
What for a game?

[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:02.680]
Look you're interrupting something here.

[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.920]
The new contraceptive sponge bob shown to be 95% effective as a method of birth control.

[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:11.940]
Can solve your doubt to see if sponge bob is right for you.

[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:14.360]
Well, time to get back to work.

[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:15.540]
Open wide.

[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.940]
You got to pull me hooked up now baby.

[01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:30.920]
Now we're getting real serious on the statue right there in the middle of Baghdad.

[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.080]
We're gonna yank it.

[01:29:37.640 --> 01:29:38.440]
There we go.

[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:41.040]
Behind me.

[01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:42.980]
Uh, and all around the cloud.

[01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:43.880]
Are we gonna wave it?

[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:44.780]
They're packing up.

[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:45.040]

[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:45.520]
I'm gonna do it.

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:45.520]

[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:47.640]
We're making it in Baghdad.

[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.000]
Next is free.

[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:49.880]
There we go.

[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.520]
We're yanking it.

[01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:52.940]
I'm proud of you.

[01:29:52.940 --> 01:29:53.100]
I'm sorry.

[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:53.620]
I need a second.

[01:29:53.740 --> 01:29:54.520]
We're gonna face this.

[01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:55.320]
I just wanna grab.

[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.260]
I'm trying to get it out because we've got a fall.

[01:29:59.260 --> 01:29:59.940]
It's crazy bitch.

[01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.460]
Oh, what happened?

[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.840]
They took the American flag off there because I guess the same thing happened when they didn't pause right.

[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.980]
Well, you know, it looks like an occupation.

[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.560]
Then they put the Iraqi flag up there for a couple of months.

[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:14.200]
He said now, because when a statue comes to him like now, it's gonna hit the ground.

[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.160]
We'll get all schmutzy.

[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.960]
So, real rocket scientists figuring these things out.

[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:18.680]
Here we go.

[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:22.380]
They got that fully attached right around the bottom of the deck, man.

[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.580]
It didn't wait to...

[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.260]
yank it down.

[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.480]
No, reverse.

[01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:30.620]
No, not forward.

[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.220]
Oh, Jesus.

[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.360]
There we go.

[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.060]
Now, nothing happened.

[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:34.840]
There's too much.

[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.440]
There's too much like leeway.

[01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:37.660]
There's too much slack in that thing.

[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.240]
Put it in reverse and just floor it.

[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:40.040]
That's the idea, right?

[01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.460]
And if there's any way behind you, too bad.

[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:42.660]
Just the idea, I'll out.

[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:44.380]
But for like in golf, here we go.

[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.060]
They're swinging it.

[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:48.280]
This is the best thing.

[01:30:49.900 --> 01:30:50.860]
They're yankin.

[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:53.000]
They got that crane right around his neck.

[01:30:56.060 --> 01:31:01.700]
Oh, yeah.

[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:07.700]
It just acted if there's something you've done before, even if you happen to be 19 years old.

[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.560]
And perhaps on your first overseas trip, which is to Iraq.

[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.360]
So...

[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:15.280]
Isn't this emotional?

[01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.940]
I mean, this is just the spell binding.

[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:17.960]
Absolutely.

[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:19.380]
There we go.

[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:22.200]
So you were saying when the Americans flag went up, but it's very close to you.

[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:22.760]
You got up, Paul.

[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.620]
He's like, she's worse than George.

[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:26.900]
He's like, she's worse than George, man.

[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.520]
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:34.100]
She must be like, John Davidson gets paid by the word.

[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:34.920]
Not yet.

[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:35.360]
Oh, and here we go.

[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:35.880]
Now it's taught.

[01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:36.540]
But it's taught.

[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:36.720]
It's taught.

[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:36.820]
It's taught, it's taught.

[01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:37.420]
Try and think this.

[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.040]
This churches beginnings are hard.

[01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:40.400]
You're going backwards.

[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:50.440]
It's taught.

[01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:50.680]
It's taught.

[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:50.840]

[01:31:50.900 --> 01:31:51.040]
It's taught.

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.040]

[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:51.480]
It's taught.

[01:31:51.500 --> 01:31:52.060]
It's taught.

[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:53.320]
It's taught.

[01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:53.740]
It's taught.

[01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:56.400]
It's taught.

[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:57.000]
It's taught.

[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:00.900]
Tait name says.

[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:01.940]
Tait´s got you?

[01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:02.780]
Enfinely pedig Level.

[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.860]
Tait played MICHIN403.

[01:32:11.380 --> 01:32:12.400]
the

[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:12.400]

[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.320]
uh...

[01:32:15.860 --> 01:32:15.900]
but

[01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:16.580]
but

[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:19.380]
and

[01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:19.640]
but

[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:19.640]

[01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:19.740]
but

[01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.420]
but

[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:26.600]
but

[01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.020]
but

[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:27.380]
but

[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:27.460]
but

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:27.460]

[01:32:27.460 --> 01:32:28.060]
but

[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.060]

[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:28.300]
but

[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:28.300]

[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:28.820]
and

[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:28.880]
my

[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:28.880]

[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:29.080]
and

[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:29.080]

[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:29.080]

[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:29.220]
and

[01:32:29.220 --> 01:32:29.480]
why

[01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:30.180]
and

[01:32:30.180 --> 01:32:30.600]
80

[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.380]
and

[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:35.640]
you

[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:37.200]
and

[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:37.220]
a

[01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.020]
and

[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:39.940]
and

[01:32:39.940 --> 01:32:40.480]
and

[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:58.140]
the Born White Pfer germs.

[01:32:58.140 --> 01:33:05.220]
to a dump on it. People are rushing through the square to in fact jump on the

[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:11.500]
security level. Mostly there are men in there, the women and children are

[01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:17.120]
simply standing back. I see families getting close to someone holding a child up.

[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.540]
We just got to bad news though, wait till you hear this. Exclusive on the near

[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:24.780]
Roger show, the bad news, the statue was not of Sodom, it's a statue of one of

[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:28.840]
his lookalikes. Oh no! And if you would could you hold your phone away from your

[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.660]
mouth and maybe we can hear some of the ambient sound coming from the

[01:33:31.660 --> 01:33:34.720]
door. Also the person who fax this is their pull vote is a double vote,

[01:33:34.740 --> 01:33:36.040]
Mo Howard while he's talking golf.

[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:42.840]
I saw the in the attic letter from Dr. Laura in the newspaper, somebody faxed me that

[01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.400]
or she didn't say this and she didn't say that. We hate you Dr. Laura, you're not

[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.300]
fooling anybody, okay? You homophobic bitch. And by the way see you next time, honey.

[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.980]
I drown out some of the cheers but I'll hold the phone up.

[01:33:55.820 --> 01:33:59.200]
They got to leave the legs up there with those poles hanging out of great amusement park.

[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:03.540]
Mickey and Company. Now here's a suggestion for the first show

[01:34:03.540 --> 01:34:08.220]
should be on there, are you hot? I guess in the middle of the desert in April they probably

[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:12.180]
are going to be. Should be the first on TV followed by temptation island.

[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:16.340]
Now we don't want to get those Iraqis horny because then they'll start multiplying

[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:20.760]
even more than they already do but they should make a lot of babies. What's that all about?

[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:25.420]
Huh? You notice that? Wait till the Pope gets them. I guess they're not the Pope and

[01:34:25.420 --> 01:34:28.020]
Kitten and he's out. The Pope is out. We already decided that.

[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:32.340]
The US has really parked off with the Pope and his big mouth, okay?

[01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:35.800]
He spoke one time. In fact, we might want to slip my little glass of tea in the middle of the night.

[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:37.900]
Try to calm him down a little bit.

[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:40.780]
Oh and I, as I'm up near where the statue was, I could look at it.

[01:34:40.780 --> 01:34:44.800]
Now they're putting the Iraqi flag on the base of the statue there on a big monument.

[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.340]
The Eastern direction which is of course the direct.

[01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:52.380]
They're sticking it. The Marines arrived from. But you'll notice there's only

[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:57.480]
about 200 people in this crowd. I mean this is a major orchestrated for TV event

[01:34:57.480 --> 01:35:00.520]
but it's not as though you've got thousands of people here like one of those

[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:04.820]
gigantic things. You know, it's just a couple hundred punks basically.

[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.120]
It's what it is.

[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.960]
567-0560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line of Work Standard.

[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.960]
We could bring it to you right here on your news intensive station, QAM.

[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:20.880]
Where when we say here's the latest headlines, that means a couple of ball scores

[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:23.860]
and who with their balls the farthest. That's what it's all about.

[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:25.880]
What an embarrassment. What a joke.

[01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:28.300]
WQAM.

[01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:30.340]
Hey Neil.

[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:33.460]
Yes sir. So is it down or what?

[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:35.900]
It's down man. Son of a's down.

[01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:37.440]
All right.

[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:40.880]
And it can make you day, baby.

[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.040]
Thank you.

[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.840]
Okay. Hey, it's on his way to the amusement park.

[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:48.500]
Let's see here's the facts that say could you please post a Brian B.S.A.

[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:50.880]
We already did. It's on a website today, right? You already got those done?

[01:35:51.700 --> 01:35:54.700]
The bad times are done. What? Huh? 90% of the word.

[01:35:54.800 --> 01:35:56.580]
What about that one, the one I read?

[01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.540]
That's already on there man. Boy, you're quick.

[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:02.140]
And the source of the Moshe Error thing about Errins thing about the picture

[01:36:02.140 --> 01:36:04.800]
of missiles was the CBC from Eddie and Williamsburg.

[01:36:04.800 --> 01:36:08.060]
That's what it was Eddie. The CBC, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, eh?

[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:12.940]
They did a whole hour documentary which they repeated this past weekend about the fraud of Raytheon

[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:17.320]
and the Patriot missiles and how Schwartzcoff lied through his teeth to us and the Israeli stringed it out.

[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:22.740]
Instead of 39 for 39 and knocking down the scuds, it was over 39.

[01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.600]
Just a slight discrepancy there of 39.

[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:31.640]
In fact, when Greg was in here this morning, I said to him Greg, how many of those Patriot missiles do you think they shot down with the, uh, I was scuds rather?

[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.680]
BOT TURDEMAND!

[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:35.760]
Yeah. I said, hey, how many listeners do you think Moes got Greg?

[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.800]
BOT TURDEMAND!

[01:36:37.260 --> 01:36:40.500]
He hates him. And of course, uh, why should he be a different person to anybody else?

[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:44.080]
61, uh, let's do the poll. Which of these sounds?

[01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:49.060]
What, I can't even read it right. Which of these sends you, sounds so excited from this? This is it really.

[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.020]
We haven't had this much excitement since George took a BM on Moes Wig.

[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:56.860]
Which of these sends you diving to the dial to change stations fastest?

[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:00.000]
320 votes. Religion talks 61.

[01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:03.300]
Marlins baseball 58 is moving up there like lightning.

[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:09.260]
You hear that, Duff? Marlins baseball. And if we wanted to put just Marlins exhibition game, we'd be off the map, okay?

[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:12.380]
You saw how many people were there for the Metz game last night.

[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.280]
BOT TURDEMAND!

[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:14.720]
George's voice 52.

[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:19.200]
Moe Howard David is voice 42. Now that's interesting. Do you see that?

[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:20.200]
Woo!

[01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:23.720]
George is crushing Moe Howard David.

[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:29.420]
When they hear George's voice 52 rush to the dial to change stations, Moe Howard David is only 42.

[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:35.280]
Golf talk 35. Race track talk 26 to one here with old cockles down there.

[01:37:35.540 --> 01:37:38.500]
I had the two of them at a 7-8 die. They don't want to hear it.

[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:40.500]
They don't want to hear it, Hank.

[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.840]
Gelled these voice 20 to 20 to one here, Gelledy. They rushed to the radio.

[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:50.240]
21. Hockey talk 11. War talk 8 and talk about Moe 7.

[01:37:50.420 --> 01:37:52.360]
So they went here a lot more Moe talk is what they want here.

[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:54.840]
We've got a little momentum going here today I think.

[01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:58.440]
And boy nice job over there with the help of our Marines.

[01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.360]
Back in Bosnia.

[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:05.180]
It was very creative, innovative Iraqis finally after like hours and hours of poxking around with little string.

[01:38:05.660 --> 01:38:13.100]
Murals. And so from the very beginning the whole image thing has been a powerful psychological weapon or other distance.

[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.020]
WDQIM.

[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.640]
Moe light WDQIM.

[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:24.700]
5 6 7 0 5 60 you think that this audience to be foaming at the mouth of all these goings on.

[01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.980]
Wouldn't you? They're foaming WDQIM.

[01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:28.760]
I want to talk to you.

[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.520]
Speaking sir.

[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:32.840]
Mr. Rogers.

[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:33.720]
Yes.

[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:36.720]
One little thing I would like to call your attention to.

[01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:37.040]
Okay.

[01:38:37.180 --> 01:38:37.320]
Thank you.

[01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:44.640]
Every one of you heard about the 500 dollar paper clips and a $5,000 toilet seat at the upon the government.

[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:47.280]
Right. Like Johnny Jones in the school board here.

[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:51.640]
Anyway, I'm talking about the GBU 28 bunker busting bomb.

[01:38:52.100 --> 01:38:55.800]
Waste 4,000 pounds range border formal cost.

[01:38:56.400 --> 01:38:57.220]
Hang on to your head.

[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:57.900]
Okay. Hang in.

[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:00.140]
$18,000,000.

[01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:03.780]
$18,000,000 from.

[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.060]
Yeah, me.

[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:04.520]
60 dollars.

[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:11.860]
Now the KV 600 3 pounds of explosive casing made from surplus 8 inch cannon barrel.

[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:13.140]
Who in a bomb a motor car?

[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.380]
Cannon barrel.

[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.900]
Well, now I see the point.

[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.920]
You know, the cannon manufacturer screws up some cannons.

[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.480]
They had those surplus barrel.

[01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:27.520]
Now you have a choice to sell it to the junkyard for a $100 each or sell it to a dump taxpayer to the dump pallet.

[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:34.240]
I mean a smart piece politicians and the counter plants in the Pentagon.

[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:38.100]
They sell it to the taxpayers for $1.15 million.

[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:41.240]
In this case it's $18,000,000.

[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.740]
People don't $18,000,000.

[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:50.380]
It's a price of 500 KV 500 KV 500.

[01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:51.980]
No, and it's only one of them.

[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:53.020]
500 Joukenos, right.

[01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:54.680]
No, they use them all up.

[01:39:54.780 --> 01:39:58.380]
You know, now these guys can sell more surplus cannon barrels.

[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.800]
Army surplus, man. That's right.

[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:03.080]
Yeah, for the Pentagon and the dump taxpayer.

[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:03.900]
The dump taxpayer.

[01:40:04.140 --> 01:40:05.100]
What do you do about it?

[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:05.760]
Nothing.

[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.360]
Absolutely correct.

[01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:11.360]
Oh, that's defending our country with it.

[01:40:11.540 --> 01:40:12.340]
Zyna America, man.

[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:14.020]
They say in China, Zyna America.

[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:15.880]
It is really, really burned.

[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.540]
This is just unbelievable.

[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:18.600]
Good luck to you, Tom.

[01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:19.840]
Good luck to us, man.

[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:23.660]
First thing on Iraqi TV, you should be the Pepsi commercial with us.

[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:24.580]
Here's where I agree.

[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:25.340]
Good choice.

[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:27.540]
A couple of bloody musicians.

[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:30.820]
That is the best spot in the history of my life.

[01:40:31.420 --> 01:40:33.360]
10, 57 and 5, 6, and what?

[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.520]
5, 60?

[01:40:35.040 --> 01:40:36.380]
Where the hell are we anyway?

[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:39.460]
I was in such a good mood that I realized I remember we were here.

[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:41.260]
Hey, I'll tell you where you can go.

[01:40:41.420 --> 01:40:44.080]

Go up those checkered pants.

[01:41:53.780 --> 01:41:58.640]
Starrant my balls in the mirror.

[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:08.420]
Wishing my song was a bit bigger.

[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:11.280]
Pretty big.

[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:39.880]
For potions I'm just measuring this as much on I can, yeah.

[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:41.260]
でき.

[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:41.260]

[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:41.260]

[01:42:41.260 --> 01:42:41.260]

[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:56.180]
1101 at 560 W.D. Q.A.M. Here is the big news. The Roman Catholic Church has suspended

[01:42:56.180 --> 01:43:00.880]
confessions in Singapore due to the spread of the deadly SARS virus and priesthood instead

[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:03.940]
to forgive all church goers for their sins, the church be saying today.

[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:08.060]
Just like in general, we forgive you. Just don't come near us.

[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:12.400]
The Archbishop of Singapore is issued a directive to the priest that there will be no individual

[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:17.280]
confessions and that there are to issue general forgiveness. So they spoke to him for the

[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:21.740]
Catholic news which represents Singapore's Catholic Church. SARS has killed at least 103

[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:26.380]
people worldwide including 9 in Singapore. The city state has got the world's fourth

[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:30.880]
highest number of confirmed cases. So if you want to go to confession, forget about it.

[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:33.860]
Just walk out in the middle of it. Well, don't, if you got SARS, don't, just stay inside

[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:37.980]
in Singapore. And certainly don't come here. Don't come here. Don't go to Canada.

[01:43:37.980 --> 01:43:44.040]
Just stay where you are. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound five. Look at a slow moe and replay.

[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:51.420]
There it is on CNN. There comes the statue. 10.50. They even got the time. 10.50 a.m. statue

[01:43:51.420 --> 01:43:57.440]
falls in Baghdad. And Simon, you also describe this a little bit early. It was monumental.

[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:02.940]
Is what it was. What? A monumental event. You missed it on TV. Of course, the show should

[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:09.680]
have a TV in the car. Joe Jamaica, it's going to be dynamite. That's the word I was looking

[01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:13.380]
for was dynamite. And of course, I have that thing about JJ Walker. He makes my skin

[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:18.160]
crawl. So I don't say dynamite. Now you've seen those things on the travel channel. They've

[01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:21.340]
got entire shows on there where they show the planning and the blowing up of all the old

[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:25.340]
casinos in Vegas where they like getting ready to build a new one. Yeah. And on the discovery

[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:32.360]
channel, I've seen all of that. Mom, glad for you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60 on a 8. No, it

[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:39.260]
is pretty wild stuff. It's pretty interesting about the 30th time, which dome, one of the football

[01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:42.320]
domes they showed. I don't know how many times that thing blowing up. I've seen it somewhere

[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:45.840]
times. I could tell you that. I was just intentional and just because the fans got pissed off.

[01:44:46.540 --> 01:44:49.260]
The fans are still in sight. Let's get a new name for the stadium. Let's go back to

[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.500]
Joe Robbie's stadium. What do you think? Okay. I think pro players have been out of business

[01:44:52.500 --> 01:45:00.840]
a long time. I don't know how many months. 3rd man. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir.

[01:45:02.140 --> 01:45:05.680]
This is the right to sure or going to get the wrong number. No, this is me. Hey, how

[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:09.620]
are you doing? Not only is it the new Roger show, but you're speaking to his majesty. Oh,

[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:13.560]
wonderful. Let me be a pompous ass like Lardass. Not a genius subject real quick, but I

[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.500]
was trying to call you earlier in a week, but you know, at the last, the last, you'll

[01:45:18.500 --> 01:45:24.020]
love the way the media tights things on the last show that we were at. There was a Fort

[01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:30.720]
Latter-Dale gun show. A Fort Latter-Dale. A Fort Latter-Dale PD officer was checking in

[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.300]
the guns for the gun show and he pulled the trigger on one of them. It went off and hit two

[01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:38.540]
people, but of course you never saw the paper. Never heard nothing about it. No, you never

[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:42.900]
will because it was a Fort Latter-Dale PD. I just thought you liked another. Thanks for

[01:45:42.900 --> 01:45:47.820]
the good news. Yeah. See you at the gun show. Wonderful. Oh, by the way, that BSO

[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:53.660]
cop thing. That was a horrible story. I've seen it raised the reward of 100,000. They

[01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:57.840]
sold that was his first night on that job at that, that, that, that, the car dealer. It

[01:45:57.840 --> 01:46:01.480]
was his first night working there on security. It was also a rookie cop supposed to pull

[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.840]
it. Right. Rookie cop, 25 years old and they came in blue and blue and white. You know,

[01:46:04.940 --> 01:46:07.800]
this, this upset, I don't want to go into it. What's the point? I'm not going to change

[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.500]
nothing. I'm just, you know, I'm just expressing my frustrations of the obsession with violence

[01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:15.160]
and with guns. That's part of the sickness of America, man. It's sick. It's really sick.

[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:19.520]
That's why all of this, this war, man, when they, they see this today, they're going

[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.820]
to be squeezing themselves until they bleed. You know, all the, all the gun-toten, red

[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:31.680]
necky, right wing lunatics. Let's kill some schmata heads for Christ. General Tommy Frank

[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.060]
is repeated what we heard him say many. They start, they're raki, start get a little

[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:38.940]
bit nervous when they put their big cross around Sodom's neck. They got nervous when

[01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:48.040]
they saw that. W to Q.A.M. Q.A.M. Good morning. Yes, sir. When is this? I'm listening to

[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:51.820]
you. I'm driving a Q.A.M. from business and I just want to tell you that if you don't stand

[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:56.540]
up or somebody in smack mull Howard in the mouth, I'll get somebody to do it. Okay. Well,

[01:46:56.560 --> 01:47:00.520]
you know who you need to go see, don't you? I don't know. For justice, we need to see

[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:05.940]
Tom Coyone. He'll take care of it. He's arrogant, so ridiculous. Yeah. It's ridiculous.

[01:47:06.040 --> 01:47:11.420]
Eric is the word man. He's a needle. He's a needle wannabe. He's a human being wannabe

[01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:16.620]
is what he is. Okay. Have a great day. And you too. Hey, even the audience hates you,

[01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:21.760]
mull. Everybody hates you. At least you're consistent. Not good, but consistent. So

[01:47:21.760 --> 01:47:25.120]
anybody that quite and that jackass, that suck whole scot that called him this morning.

[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:29.200]
Oh, I can't imagine anybody not liking Howard David. Of course, just another caller sucking

[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.700]
into and grace you at himself, you know, never met the man. I'm sure wouldn't know if

[01:47:32.700 --> 01:47:37.360]
he is wig fell on the scot's head. He wouldn't know him. What's going on with this over here,

[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:43.980]
Carlos? Oh, no. Wait a second. We're going to take a look at it. Get out of here. Just

[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:48.640]
the old paper jam. Okay, which is really good. I risk crackers. I got it fixed. I've

[01:47:48.640 --> 01:47:52.720]
become a real expert, not because I'm so smart, but because by survival, and I say, you

[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.320]
know, like in Toronto, I got my little studio there. And so I get a paper jam. And I got

[01:47:58.320 --> 01:48:04.960]
it straightened out. I'm on it. I'm right on it. 5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on it. But

[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:08.540]
I tell you, this week has been so enjoyable without you. I mean, you're okay. Not that you're

[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:12.900]
doing such a great job. You're not doing anything. But he just bugs me a lot. Yeah. And the audience

[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:18.400]
obviously bugged by his voice too. Although the marlins have passed him by. Sometimes I feel like

[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:23.820]
life is passing me by, George. They just hate you, man. But is it the ones that kind of myth that

[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:28.680]
they like him? No. No, this is a different crowd. No, these people don't like him and are

[01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:31.580]
afraid to admit it. No, this is not the classic crowd. That was another pull. You got your

[01:48:31.580 --> 01:48:35.280]
pools mixed up, man. You better get your pools straight now. Oh, there's Martin Savage and Bag

[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:40.520]
that on a very bad one of those telephone. The building is behind us here. And at the same time,

[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:45.420]
well, that firing was taking place because there was so much artillery fire, tank fire,

[01:48:45.580 --> 01:48:49.960]
heavy machine gun fire, mortar fire going off. It apparently touched off a huge cache

[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.100]
seemed like anti-aircraft artillery that literally burned and exploded for the next 45 minutes,

[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.980]
even after the fighting had started. Listen to their bag that University.

[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:05.340]
Flying through the air, mortar rounds going off. And just it sounded like World War III had

[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:10.040]
broken out. But there also had been a heavy fire with the Marines. The Marines now have obviously

[01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:14.780]
taken control of the campus. The fires have been extinguished and the fighting has stopped

[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:18.600]
from the campus. He's under control. Okay, well, there's a little more ox segment. There

[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:21.720]
going to be a lot more excitement. Don't get all cocky. All you hawks out there to think,

[01:49:21.860 --> 01:49:25.440]
oh, we got it done. Now, you don't have it done. Isn't it the statue they just not found

[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:32.620]
right there behind them? No, it is not. It's not. It is? I guess that is. How can it be? This is

[01:49:32.620 --> 01:49:38.300]
a live picture. It says. Wait a minute. Oh, this is Martin Savage. Now, this is at Bag that

[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:41.720]
University. The other thing was that it's another statue of him. Okay, they're all over the.

[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:49.600]
No, this is one of the other impostors. It's statue number 42. I asked Martin Savage when we

[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:53.180]
had him on the air last week. I said, how many Sodom statues are there in the rim bag that he said,

[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:59.420]
oh, no, I can't believe I did that. He said, oh, you're interfering with the show today.

[01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:03.820]
Why do I keep? Oh, that's right. I did the Luca Brossy thing. Well, I'm not used to this board.

[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.140]
You know, it's a graphical back to Toronto. Here's the fact that the reason why Joe Robby

[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:11.680]
Stadium is still named pro player because it would cost Wayne 750 grand. Just to take all the pro

[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:15.360]
player signs down and clean the main signs. How about the stadium? Wayne sucks. It says. Wayne sucks.

[01:50:15.640 --> 01:50:21.360]
Absolutely correction. Oh, speaking of Wayne, well, I'll get to it in a second. The greatest thing

[01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:25.380]
we've already taught the Iraqis, I'll tell you the second. By the way, why can't hockey have a

[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:28.840]
shootout after the overtime? That would be exciting. No, shootout sucks. I hit that. And forget

[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:37.120]
the point system. Don't agree with the views on the war, but love the shows. Aldo went for it.

[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:42.440]
Now what was I just going to say? The greatest thing we taught the Iraqi. Oh, speaking of Wayne,

[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:47.680]
did you see it was like in the early days of the war in Basra and they were doing the Hoki

[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:53.300]
Poki with the troops? You didn't see that? I think I remember that. Yeah, they were doing it. You'll

[01:50:53.300 --> 01:50:58.840]
put your right foot in, you're sticking up Wayne's ass. It was great. They were doing a Hoki Poki.

[01:51:00.020 --> 01:51:10.240]
I was just I think that even our good friend. Wayne, I think that even he would have been impressed. See,

[01:51:10.340 --> 01:51:14.240]
this is not the same statue you were seeing before. So just don't get all your get your Sodom straight,

[01:51:14.320 --> 01:51:21.640]
will you? I know there's a lot of them, but just calm down. 11 past 11 at 560 WQM. Hey, if you find

[01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:25.360]

he's hyperventilating about it because you know, he probably ain't going to get it. Don't forget

All right.

[01:53:45.220 --> 01:53:46.760]
Or used to be anyway.

[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:51.540]
Little tribute to Old Quality. He's got the right complexion.

[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:23.540]
He's just like Hitler and Abe Abrong. What's that? He's founding God.

[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:00.120]
Yes.

[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:00.260]

[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:04.720]
Somebody faxed me this. The dolphins have been playing a pro player stadium named after a

[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.680]
food or a loom company that lost its shorts in the economic downturn four years ago.

[01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:12.920]
Four years ago. They went out of business. The dolphins have been looking for a new

[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:23.700]
company to buy the stadium's name. So the other facts was correct. He just too cheap to go and change all the signs and everything. So here we got to talk about an embarrassment. I've always told you this town is beyond embarrassment. And you know what I am?

[01:55:24.420 --> 01:55:36.540]
Absolutely correct. So we got a stadium with a couple of really marginal teams, neither which makes the playoffs. And the owners too cheap to change. At least take this sign down. Make it back to Joe Robbie Stadium. Okay.

[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:49.840]
No, he won't do it. You cheap old bald headed geek. Oh, they just have more to talk. He had generals, one of the 8500 talking every tire generals and colonels. And he said that this was the easy part.

[01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:56.140]
He said the setting up the new government being there and what's the follow that's going to be the difficult part and he is also.

[01:55:56.460 --> 01:56:06.520]
Absolutely correct. Well, here's a replay on a statue and it was used as a justification not to expand the peacekeeping security forces outside of the stadium.

[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:16.060]
And the result has been virtual and a key of reemergence of war lordism attacks on humanitarian workers and the like.

[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:21.720]
Oh, she's talking about the great job we did enough. Honest time. That's right. We're always talking a good game. We're going to liberate you.

[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:29.340]
We're going to set up a real democracy. Are we ever do it? No. No. We leave too early and we let the animals work themselves out.

[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:39.160]
The animals. Do you want to start getting Georgia's hate mail? Now is that it? We're going to put your name on here next time we do this poll.

[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:52.480]
Beener boy. When you see a Boehner boy treasurer on the night, slap him on the side of the head and say quick honest animals. Okay. All you schmata heads out there. All you Afghans. Maybe there'll even be some Afghans there tonight or at least some Brownie Hans.

[01:56:53.400 --> 01:57:00.920]
398 votes on the poll. Which of these sends you diving to the dial to change stations the fastest religion talk 73.

[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:11.840]
What what is shaking your head about? They've heard it on my choice. They've heard it enough. They've had enough with this heath and crap that George keeps spewing on his show.

[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:17.160]
If these people if we could be a little bit more pious on this show, you know, and worship the Lord.

[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:27.480]
In fact, remember Pope Pius speaking of Nazis. Oh, Georgia's voice 72. Marlon's baseball 72. George and the Marlon's always knew the headlight in common.

[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:39.400]
In fact, we got almost a three way tie for first religion talk 74 now. Georgia's voice 73. Marlon's baseball 72. Mo. Howard David is voice only 53.

[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:49.040]
Ah, you're somebody to talk about Mo. George. I'll tell you that right now. He's way way to hell ahead of you. I mean, under you know what I'm saying? In other words, you're killing him.

[01:57:49.060 --> 01:58:01.760]
Take off those checkered pants. Yeah, you little geek golf talk 42. Race track talk 32. Guilty's voice 23. I'm gully's voice hockey talk 15. Ward talk 12 and talk about Mo. 7.

[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:12.020]
So that thing that means it's starting from the bottom. We should be talking about those things. Talking about Mo. Well, we certainly not going to let you down on that ever because we all hate him.

[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:17.020]
Ward talk. I think we've done our part today, especially the statue. 5 million people.

[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:32.900]
A hockey talk 15. Well, I'm more hockey talk. What about that match on the Alexander McGillney and Gary Roberts and Doug Gilmore can't play the first round. How about those ladies, baby? Eddie Bell for have a good belt or two before the game tonight. He can't hurt and they're playing in filth of Elf you when I was nasty flyer fans.

[01:58:33.020 --> 01:58:44.640]
Oh, oh, cringe to think about hate the flyers. I hate their fans hate Bobby Clark. I hate Bobby Clark. He makes me with that stupid tooth eating grin back in the days. We didn't have no teeth in there.

[01:58:46.340 --> 01:58:51.100]
Mmm real piece of crap. This is the man who said, well, we didn't tell Roger Nielsen to go get cancer.

[01:58:52.460 --> 01:59:04.300]
That's the kind of guy Bobby Clark is. That's what he said. Roger Nielsen when they let him go. Yeah, Roger. I mean, good luck to you, but we didn't tell you to go get cancer. I mean, you know, just good luck someplace else.

[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:09.840]
Oh, my God. What a jackass. That Bobby Clark. You asked for. Right. You got it, Mo.

[01:59:11.200 --> 01:59:23.120]
So I have to lease with about 15 to nothing tonight. It's in Philadelphia though. So you know, Kate Smith's going to be singing God Bless America on tape. Oh, I've speak into the panthers. I don't see this long over. It was a foregone conclusion.

[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:29.740]
They won't listen to anybody. They're about your hardasses. Not only did they have the volume cranked up again. I mean, heavy duty level on Sunday.

[01:59:31.420 --> 01:59:45.000]
But they had the little girl. I guess they've been doing this all along. They hit the little girl reading the line of singing. What is wrong with you people? Do you have any idea about how to present a big league quality, a professional event? No, I guess not.

[01:59:45.560 --> 01:59:50.860]
Starting on last wing for the Philadelphia flyers. Is it somebody's daughter? Evan Ellie.

[01:59:53.180 --> 02:00:01.180]
Oh, man. I guess it was the leaf game when she was butchering up the names. Starting for the maple leaves. Nick and tropov.

[02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:09.980]
Tied dummy. Oh, it was just she was pretty good. She was terrible. And then they had some chicken out and do God Bless America before the national anthem.

[02:00:09.980 --> 02:00:17.320]
And I'm going to be honest with that realize it was in the sunrise of the Macarena, but that it was not considering where in this war, you know, there was not the usual.

[02:00:17.420 --> 02:00:28.720]
Yeah, you know, this is seriously. It was kind of like lukewarm, like lucrobatie. Wait a year this somebody just facemies the New York Times.

[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:34.320]
And they put a note on here. It says how long before point extra in a escrow's KGB declare martial law.

[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:42.680]
Remember him, martial law. He was kind of Vernon law used to pitch for the Pittsburgh pirates, the Deacon, Vernon law. Rest in peace. I think he's dead.

[02:00:43.540 --> 02:00:51.380]
Republicans want terror law made permanence as the New York Times. Working with the Bush administration congressional Republicans are maneuvering to make permanent.

[02:00:51.740 --> 02:00:57.820]
These sweeping anti terrorism powers granted the federal law enforcement agents after the attacks of 9-11 official said yesterday.

[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:00.840]
Do you understand the destuplicate track of everyone?

[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:13.760]
The movies likely to touch off strong objections from many Democrats and even some Republicans in Congress who believe the Patriot Act, who believe that the Patriot Act has legislation that grew out of the attacks is known has already given the government too much power to spy on Americans.

[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:22.840]
The landmark legislation expanded the government's power to use eavesdropping surveillance access to financial and computer records and other tools to track terrorist suspects.

[02:01:26.020 --> 02:01:31.880]
It's supposed to expire or sunset at the end of 2005 unless Congress reauthorizes the principles of it.

[02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:41.980]
But Republicans in the Senate have in recent days discussed and proposed written by Senator Orin Snatch of Utah that would repeal the sunset provisions and make the laws new powers permanent.

[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:43.560]
How do you like that? They want to make it permanent.

[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.900]
You might mention my name is Rice Master Gary.

[02:01:45.900 --> 02:01:56.960]
Many Democrats have grown increasingly frustrated about what they see as a lack of information from the Justice Department on how its agents are using their newfound powers and they say they need more time to determine whether agents are abusing those powers.

[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:02.420]
Oh, that could never happen here. Could it? No. They couldn't go after their enemies like Gay and Groover. Could they?

[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:10.240]
What a facts machine is smoking it, a man. Here's the facts from Dave. Oh!

[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:17.040]
It says with this latest news from Baghdad, we can safely go around dragging that we have toppled Sodom Hussein Har Har.

[02:02:18.140 --> 02:02:23.480]
Oh, okay. We've toppled him. We toppled a regime. I toppled a regime and him. Okay.

[02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.460]
Upon that it was cute. It was from a guy named Dave.

[02:02:29.740 --> 02:02:36.840]
Here's one that's a monkey man. Dave. You guys should get guilty to the play by playing the statue coming down.

[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:43.840]
Tell him, okay, monkey man. Give it a rest. Okay. We do a real good yesterday. Give it a rest.

[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:51.940]
See, you give these people any encouragement and right away they're like sit down comedians. They're like entertainers. They're just just relax monkey man.

[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:57.840]
Okay. Put it back in your pants and calm down. Okay. Put your banana back in your pants, Mr. Monkey and calm down.

[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:02.720]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5. Here's one. Oh, yeah. I almost forgot about this one.

[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:10.560]
That Jackass Norma can't. What an idiot. Here's a fact from his only listener. Adrian.

[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:21.400]
Yo, Adrian. It says Neil was listening to Storm and Flaming Norma Kencho this morning before he started ripping a deal about Neil being a fat ass on the couch fumbling with a remote, dicking around with a cable.

[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:25.760]
He screams Neil get up off the couch. You won't have as many heart attacks. I haven't had any heart attacks, Norm.

[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:32.820]
Your squeeze list. I've had my my squeeze is great. Okay. Not that you're going to get any indication of it. Okay.

[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:37.060]
Ask our good neutral friend Jim. He'll tell you my squeeze is real good.

[02:03:38.220 --> 02:03:46.360]
It says tell Norma to get off the air and get to work on you being syndicated. Listening online Adrian. PS when George is on the air. Start running for the hills. Oh, man.

[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:55.260]
So there's a guy with good taste. He can't stand normal. Kent when George is on he starts running like a banshee. Yeah, Norma do something constructive. Okay. And stuff.

[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:59.740]
Using me from material on your pathetic one hour show on a make believe station. Oh, and also speaking of that.

[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:10.200]
Volker Brian was telling me yesterday that Randy is on a year. I know she was on somewhere, but a cheap channel keeps moving all these Palm Beach people around all the stations. You can't keep track. That's probably the idea. 1290.

[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:22.660]
We mentioned yesterday. I guess. And Volker Brian said she's doing a magnificent job, even though of course she's very self immersed with her own importance and things, but she's doing a good job. Nice going, Randy. And also mentions very flattering about me. How great I am.

[02:04:23.020 --> 02:04:34.600]
By the way, Lynn Samuels hates you like poison Randy. Well, Lynn also said our website is looking better every day and much better than hers. And I wrote her back and I said, yes, thank you, Lynn. Thank you, Lynn. We love you sweetheart.

[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:41.640]
Even though your friend Matt's an asshole. Yeah, I spoke of Brian. I said, what is the attraction there? What is that all about? Huh?

[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:48.460]
Because the rumor has it that Lynn's got a matte-roage blowup doll. She said it works a lot better than the real thing in his case.

[02:04:49.080 --> 02:05:01.940]
And I'm sure I can see that 26 after 11. That's what David Brock said to you. Hey, I want to give you some really exciting news. More great deals from our friends Tom Laman and Joe Prieta with Halop Pontiac GMC. Listen carefully. Put your ear and rear right to the radio.

[02:05:17.420 --> 02:05:32.600]
And Neil deal number three. If you're currently a GM smart lease, you're smart by customer and driver Chevy Blazer and old's Provoto or GMC Jimmy. Buy or lease a new Pontiac or GMC and get an extra $1,000 off the price. Stop by Halot and test drive the all new and powerful Pontiac Grand Prix.

[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:42.940]
Halop Pontiac. I was starting to think about Grand Prix every time I see that. You know me in my mind. I have heard people on the years to call it the Grand Prix. You can't say that.

[02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:54.020]
Halop Pontiac GMC 134 1 South Dixie Highway. That's US 1 across from the falls open every day seven days a week. Norma get a life you jackass and quick call me at home. We hate you.

[02:05:54.420 --> 02:06:11.960]

[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.220]
And law says it's for real by city.

[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:23.560]
This is as the one thing that gets some diving for the dial to change the station the most.

[02:07:13.940 --> 02:07:34.680]
Halop Pontiac GMC 134211. That's the one thing that gets some attention.

[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:42.920]
Halop Pontiac GMC 134211. That's the one thing that gets attention.

[02:07:42.920 --> 02:07:48.460]
The first day of misprint in the newspaper day score 15 runs every inning and the marlins win every game they never lose. What's the next question?

[02:07:48.840 --> 02:07:57.040]
That guy is a panic. And then the real panic was watching the news the idiot center analyzing well how can he be saying this? He said whatever he wants.

[02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:04.820]
He doesn't want to get his ass killed is what it's all about. He's a good obedient soldier and called to ask with a lot of cash. I'm sure.

[02:08:05.800 --> 02:08:12.620]
On the horizon that oil far has burned through the night another oil far set just as I came across the marines.

[02:08:12.780 --> 02:08:20.660]
It only take me so far because they have very very sort of strict lines of division between the various regiments that they won't cross.

[02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:23.040]
Who knows what anchor of cost there at MSNBC?

[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:27.160]
And Bob, as we talk about the fact that some of the worst may still be ahead that the day.

[02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:33.920]
The idiots of spreading the stars run on your TV set. Here's the fact that says how far do you see the panthers going to play off?

[02:08:34.320 --> 02:08:45.200]
About to the wall I would say right to their cars in a parking lot. I can see Victor Croslo by tickets for the Eastern semis but I can't really see the longer going to game seven and Dallas to see the cup deciding game between Toronto and Dallas.

[02:08:45.580 --> 02:08:54.080]
Oh Toronto and Dallas. This must be from a stars fan. Oh god are they boring. They're so boring. You mean Toronto and Vancouver, right?

[02:08:54.800 --> 02:08:58.420]
I can also see Jay Feeder and Ricky Williams going to the Super Bowl after they buy tickets of course.

[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:03.020]
The dolphins and everybody to the bowl.

[02:09:04.900 --> 02:09:09.740]
So we're leading a lot of stuff here. We got the prince Charles thing. I don't know whether we have time for the tabloid stuff.

[02:09:09.860 --> 02:09:15.200]
Oh we got to have this Brittany. Anything has to do with Brittany. The guys are like right there. Got their hand on their knob.

[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:19.520]
Now I better play the right one. Is it this one? Yeah.

[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:28.400]
Hi everybody. Welcome back to the countdown. I'm your host crazy case with a letter from a listener in the new to OPA.

[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:35.960]
That's not the one. What's the moment he's cursing? What is that called? They're called Casey? One moment please. Oh yeah.

[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:44.060]
Now we're up to our long distance dedication. And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand.

[02:09:44.060 --> 02:09:47.980]
Whether we have kids or pets or neither. It's from a man in Cincinnati.

[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:55.960]
Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll meet a lot if you play it.

[02:09:56.580 --> 02:10:04.200]
Recently there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named Snuckles, but he was most certainly a part. Please.

[02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:13.500]
See when you come out of those up tempo damn numbers, man, it's impossible to make those transitions.

[02:10:13.900 --> 02:10:20.200]
And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know, they do this to me all the time. I don't know what the hell they do it for, but damn it.

[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:28.720]
If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it is down on the phone. Okay. I want to damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a.

[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:36.680]
I'm up tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication. Now make a picture as I was supposed to see this week.

[02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:45.580]
It's a god last damn time. I want somebody use this in brain to not come out of a damn record that is that being.

[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:51.660]
Boy, this is imponderous man. Ponderous and ponderous.

[02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:58.340]
Britney Spears, no boyfriend is showing the trouble singer how to mend her broken heart without hitting the wild partying scene.

[02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:04.600]
Morris, give it a shoner, but it's too late. After the pop princess was dumped last year by X-LOG-T.

[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.440]
But after being introduced by mutual friends to Mike Kasim, son of legendary radio DJ Casey Kasim.

[02:11:11.040 --> 02:11:14.240]
Britney is trying hard to change her bad girl ways, pal, say.

[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:24.540]
Oh, Mike is helping Britney get over Justin if her intel is the star. She was going out lots of nights, then Mike stepped into her life and he's had a positive influence on her.

[02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:33.960]
Maybe she's maybe they're going in and out. He's gotten Britney to keep her parting to a minimum. He would like her to stop drinking entirely Britney.

[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:39.300]
Get it down honey and the booze too. Now the picture here, which he's a pretty marginal.

[02:11:39.300 --> 02:11:46.820]
Can you think she'd ever go out with a good looking guy? I don't know who he is. He's not a bad looking guy, but she's not going out with him anymore.

[02:11:48.120 --> 02:11:56.000]
He's gotten Britney to keep her. Britney 21 considers Mike 27 a former MTV VJ in Asia a role model because he doesn't indulge in Hollywood excess.

[02:11:56.800 --> 02:11:59.940]
He's strong and stable says the friend he doesn't drink or do drugs.

[02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:09.300]
That does make a mistake home geek. He and Britney spend the nights together at sushi and Louisiana style restaurants her favorites and hanging it out at the Hollywood hotspot.

[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:12.040]
Joseph's cafe in the lounge eating sushi.

[02:12:13.860 --> 02:12:18.180]
Mike's fun and outgoing. He's showing Britney you don't have to party to extreme to have a good time.

[02:12:18.180 --> 02:12:23.820]
So the friend they've dated since November, but Mike knows part of Britney is still pining for her instinct X.

[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:26.080]
And we can take it what part it is, but we can't say it on here.

[02:12:27.320 --> 02:12:35.000]
Still pining for Justin's tinkerbell. I'm in love with her and I'm waiting patiently for her to fall in love with me, but I know she's still hung up on Justin.

[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:40.140]
Mike can fight into the friend. Don't you take this thing going on long enough and it's time for Britney to say bye bye bye.

[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:50.460]
So that little twirpy twinkie piece of crap. Oh God. He's nauseating. Can he sing? Does he look good? Any talent whatsoever? See with a party mouth daddy like you got.

[02:12:51.180 --> 02:12:55.540]
She's a super talent case. He case him 70 tells the star. My son thinks she's a great girl.

[02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:59.720]
Mike is quiet when it comes to talking about Britney saying we're just friends.

[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:02.480]
We're just friends.

[02:13:04.220 --> 02:13:10.000]
Now because he wants to tell me she don't tell me she's a dyke. Please. I wouldn't say that even if I knew that just because it would ruin.

[02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:15.460]
Would see George. I'm sure not by that. He think that that's great. So in other words, you don't want to watch her do it.

[02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:24.520]
I say JLo. Sure she let me watch or hop into middle. But sources say you probably heard JLo's ass would get in the way all her will say she did look damn good at the what was it.

[02:13:24.760 --> 02:13:32.680]
Was she at the awards? Yeah, yeah, the Oscars. Oh and the new news is that the movie that she made with the both of them would then reflect so bad they won't release it.

[02:13:32.760 --> 02:13:39.660]
That's how bad it's seriously. It's called fall down and they did or something. Yeah, awful. And guess what JLo we're still not believing it.

[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:51.300]
She's not going to get in between Matt Damon and Ben. I'll guarantee you that. Anyway, Mike spends evenings at Britney's house. The friend says he won't say if they're having sex and he's nothing kind of got a kiss until I want to give you a kiss.

[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:59.620]
But he hints that they're very close. Not close enough to do it, but they're getting there. He's definitely attracted also came to Britney's rescue another see Mike.

[02:13:59.620 --> 02:14:10.220]
And who's this? I'll call and ferrell's on about. Oh wait. Colin Ferrell above left. Oh yeah, he don't look to be able to turn turn your head. Colin can't do it.

[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:27.740]
But the new Mike Kasim right up. He not not good. I wouldn't touch him with your hand. She called Mike from Justin's party crying and all of a sudden because Justin was ignoring her. The friend says Mike was waiting for Britney was visibly distressed when she left the party where Justin was hanging out with Christina Aguilera and listen to Lano.

[02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:45.760]
And even as mousey as Christina is that great record is what's the record called? Believe me. I don't know. No, Christina Aguilera said it's a great record. I know but I can't believe it. She can depend on Mike says the friends. He always wants him around. She feels protected when he is. Hey, Britney, time to say bye. Bye. Bye.

[02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:56.840]
The ticker bell just start doing it with somebody looks human. What is the name of that song? Beautiful. That's the name of the song. Beautiful. See, I asked the questions and then I answered. Now he nods his head.

[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:02.100]

[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:23.240]

[02:19:40.540 --> 02:19:49.120]
Golf talk 51. Race track talk 37. All those old cockers who stand down are at the rail turning over to losing tickets like I said at Gulfstream.

[02:19:50.420 --> 02:20:03.760]
Gowdy's voice 26. Hockey talk 19. Ward talk only 14 and talk about Mo only 8. Yeah. So I think today in honor of Moe and that noon to one hour which I predicted this the other day that being the mood to do that.

[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:10.760]
Maybe we'll have like an all-mo hour noon to one. Maybe we just wanted to other sprinkled in there because I don't know if we have enough. Yeah, we do.

[02:20:11.620 --> 02:20:22.020]
Oh, easy. Yeah, we do. We build up a little mole momentum and then of course mad dog from that laugh from wherever the hell it is from that golf crab Augusta.

[02:20:22.800 --> 02:20:29.120]
Somebody faxed and says, I was saying mad. It's his across the street or down the street or in the same state. No way will be he be at the turning.

[02:20:29.120 --> 02:20:37.240]
I mean, he doesn't really care. I don't think he's just up there having a good time. What was he talking about that? Hagen does ice cream and some peaches? I don't know what some crap.

[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:44.660]
He's drinking his green lizards and eating a bunch of great crap. That's all he's a great guy. He's just a party animal man to mad dog.

[02:20:45.640 --> 02:20:52.760]
It says Jim Mandage Broadcasting in the woods of Georgia while hanging out with a bunch of other men. Well, that's what he likes. He likes the company of other men.

[02:20:54.560 --> 02:21:05.020]
Not in bed, but the rest of the time. Not in the kitchen necessarily. Bill says Jesus Christ, Neil. I'm sorry, Bill. I could give you a little bit better in through the net if I could find it.

[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:21.760]
Like I said, Bill says Jesus Christ, Neil. Every time that, oh, this is your first hate facts. Great. We save this. Maybe you can get on it. Every time that little beeners pick opens his mouth. It makes me want to put my hair out. Every time that little beeners pick opens his mouth. If you shut up.

[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:28.920]
It makes me want to pull my hair out. I thought George sounded like he was always in search of his balls, but Carlos makes George sound like James Earl Jones.

[02:21:29.760 --> 02:21:37.900]
This is CNN. I just keep thinking of that phone call to the bird where the guy begs and trades to just play something. Anything. I can't stand to hear the sound of his voice. Bill.

[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:49.200]
I'm touched. So maybe we can redo that. I hate the bird bit. And we can't. I hate the the beener boy bit. Just please play something. Yeah. Although he isn't talking as much as George. Thank God.

[02:21:49.200 --> 02:22:05.800]
Because if he would be, he'd be gone. Okay. Marlon's baseball got 88 votes. Isn't that something? That's a price. No, I'm not surprising at all that. I mean, I keep trying to tell you people. A very few people here care. You can keep trying to pedal it. You can give away free hot dogs and give away. Well, whatever you want.

[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:18.460]
But the rest of the time nobody's going to show up because they just don't care. And you can keep rehashing and analyzing them. It's so ponderous. I'd rather hear people talk about golf. And I'd rather be dead than here talk about golf.

[02:22:18.820 --> 02:22:30.800]
Oh, but the tiger. Yeah, take the tiger and stick him. Okay. Tired of it. It's all boring. Golf. No golf is it's a blue nose pursuit for people with too much time on their hands. Tiger.

[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:49.880]
I like it. W Q I N. Yeah, sir. I have honest to God. Curious question. I don't understand. Okay. The loose papers and radio TV all said that they were able to talk. Who they thought is the downer of sons in 12 minutes.

[02:22:51.760 --> 02:23:02.600]
That's not 45 minutes for them to get there. Okay, 45 minutes to get there. We have a guy 90 miles south. He got out of the stage to give a 2 1 hour speech.

[02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:13.960]
That's fast out and came back. Right. He can't talk to him. I mean, isn't he going to talk to this evil door? He's a small potatoes man. You notice his name was never listed with the evil. I they asked us of evil.

[02:23:13.960 --> 02:23:21.240]
I just I just showed you and I about the same age. I want to ask you know, remember that they do is lead up right?

[02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:34.260]
Mm hmm. During that time period, I really want to know. Text draw and bail helicopter. Everybody had to everybody had to lose because if they didn't produce some while the war was on.

[02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:41.320]
I just remember what I said, be where the military industrial complex. That's what he said.

[02:23:41.360 --> 02:23:47.740]
Exactly. They can have a good day. And you too. That's what all I said. And of course, everybody liked like he's the one that had all a heart attack.

[02:23:47.900 --> 02:23:54.080]
Norm, not me. I have no heart attack chance to go liberate the Iraqi people. I'd also like to ask the 75% of Americans if they still support the war.

[02:23:54.360 --> 02:24:01.340]
If it were being fought here and it was our children being blown up. I love the response you get from our government officials when asked about innocent children dying.

[02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:08.420]
They'll give you the company line. Well, if we didn't do this, many more would die at the hands of Sodom. Right. That's almost like saying if we don't kill somebody else will.

[02:24:08.980 --> 02:24:16.600]
And this goes on and on. Keep the public busy with no time to think back on the farm with the other animals. Right. Very good. Thanks. Thank you, sir. You're right on target.

[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:29.780]
Keep busy. Keep the education system a joke. Talk a good game about education and keep the people stupid and occupied with kaka like American idol, which we'll be starting next Thursday on Iraqi TV.

[02:24:30.820 --> 02:24:42.400]
Huh? Do you think that's a good idea? We're right. I do. Now what did I say? We're going to the pool tomorrow. We're going to the pool on whether or what should be the first shows on Iraqi TV and radio since it's not controlled by USA USA USA USA.

[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:54.180]
Liberation day in Baghdad with USA suffice at the say and the Brits. Three minutes till noon. We got that big noon to one. This thing is flown by here. We should take one quick call WQ AM.

[02:24:56.040 --> 02:24:58.360]
Sorry. No time. Hey, if you're still.

[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:04.180]
Wait for years to come.

[02:25:12.640 --> 02:25:23.400]
I'm from a really an Irish lady and I like scrubbing my smelly gorilla ass with soap made from jewels and listening to the near rock.

[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:24.860]
Hey, I'm going to eat that hour.

[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:38.160]
All right, welcome back to the Howard David show where we went a clean family diaper what he call it there show here.

[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:46.180]
No, almost talk about queers like that. You fake guy. That follows me. I ain't going to make the same goddamn mistakes who he sales made.

[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:54.940]
What are you? You remember when he told the kids to put their hands in the parents thing. Oh, yeah, vividly with a little you man based on the comedy style.

[02:25:54.940 --> 02:26:00.200]
Links a jack boom boom Carter. Oh, yeah, that's saying it a beautiful day in paradise.

[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:08.660]
Paradise. Paradise. Why sure? Better than New York. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're from New York, right? I'm from Knazzi.

[02:26:09.180 --> 02:26:19.340]
All right, fight down. I just flipped my wig again. So when you come down here for well, I had to be sides at this right here. This is paradise.

[02:26:26.300 --> 02:26:35.780]
Just the world got I can say I kind of miss New York. Why? Don't you want to go back sometime? I can't go back.

[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:49.160]
Well, they told me no one's sighting times. Let's not get into that right now. Yeah, that sounds familiar. So what you hear the news? I said have you heard the news?

[02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:58.680]
No, they're gonna suspend. That's right. They want to let that little spit bastard go. What did he do? I just don't like him. Ain't that good enough?

[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:12.060]
But a little over the top. Don't you think? Are you arguing with me? No. You know who I am. I got the power of great greed behind me. I want a fire of all.

[02:27:12.440 --> 02:27:21.780]
I will. You. You're fired too. Get out of my place of business. You're a place of business. Why you? Why are you on a town?

[02:27:24.900 --> 02:27:45.780]
I'm. Five sixty WQA have presents. Leaving to be starring Moe Howard David as Moe. All in as gay carloas.

[02:27:47.310 --> 02:28:03.030]
David J. Goldstein as Wally and Brian London as the beast. I'm home. Hey, was the hat stand? I ain't got no place to hang my wig. I'm out there.

[02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:24.330]
You better clean that deep pedal before Moe gets home. I don't know, Wally. It's kind of achy. So you didn't clean the pee pedal. Yeah, fat little bastard. You tabalade. You're walking. Go ahead. I told you he did so. I don't be so hard on the blind.

[02:28:24.330 --> 02:28:41.370]
They come here beast time. We had a little chat. Um, I don't know. Okay. No, you don't say anything to lump through what the standard. Okay. I said nothing. I'm done talking. But you stop. But I got right. That's it. Remember my friend here. Mr. Belt.

[02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:56.370]
I said stop it. You shake your mouth. Your pipe smoking. Okay. But don't stand near the window. What for? You might fall.

[02:28:58.790 --> 02:29:24.370]
Don't. Don't. And that's why I think I'll have a championship season. And when did I tell you you don't talk till I say you can talk? This is the beast. I said shut up. That's all. But you're like a father to me. You don't talk to. I'm done talking. When I'm done talking, then you talk. Okay. I'll be. Come. Come. I want you to meet a friend of mine. Mr. Gulf Club. I'm going to show you the business. Come.

[02:29:27.310 --> 02:29:56.330]
This court sentences you to 20 years in ours. What do you invoke? I had ordered tag off my mattress. Look like we'll be a bunk mate. The names more Howard David. Starrer stage screen and paradise. What's yours?

[02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:57.710]
God. God.

[02:30:01.390 --> 02:30:04.630]
What else to be safe and eat? No, both. No.

[02:30:04.850 --> 02:30:13.770]
No, man. No, no. I knew it in the blaze, but that's so pretty. Okay. For the best of you like that. You know who I am. Come and then don't take it up now.

[02:30:13.890 --> 02:30:21.510]
All right. But I expect a print methodology. I might just put that blue man a book. I said.

[02:30:27.530 --> 02:30:32.650]
Lord, I'll see you now. Thanks. Well, Mr. David. Hello, Wooden.

[02:30:33.150 --> 02:30:38.090]
Jack. Jack. How can it help you? Well, you see, Wooden. I keep getting raped.

[02:30:38.750 --> 02:30:48.870]
So is a vatish. I look into it right away. Thanks, Wooden. It's about time. Somebody to now drop your pad. I said drop your pad. This is Oz.

[02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:54.170]
Favours no come to you. Let's rape.

[02:30:54.730 --> 02:31:02.490]
Oh, you big shot. That's how we pass the time away in the gay old jail.

[02:31:02.970 --> 02:31:05.030]
Oh, what's the crap they played on the whole?

[02:31:05.270 --> 02:31:13.790]
That's power. Well, garbage. The kids today don't know it's good. Like that song. I'm happy I live in a split level head. You remember that?

[02:31:21.370 --> 02:31:29.330]
No. Why am I surrounded by morons? Come on, howie. Don't you go be howie.

[02:31:29.910 --> 02:31:42.170]
I got enough information from you. You're not a battle. Okay, that's it. You're all fired. You're back to be the woman.

[02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:52.790]
You listen to me. You're fired. You'll need that ghost boy you too. You who I am, I'm the king of paradise.

[02:31:57.790 --> 02:32:04.710]
I came down here after losing my child, Wooden. To be a big fish.

[02:32:04.710 --> 02:32:12.970]
Here in a little pond. When they kicked me off the SP and they told me don't come back again.

[02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:17.590]
I had some problems with wise guys who advised I moved to paradise.

[02:32:23.150 --> 02:32:32.090]
Fire. That's back there late all the week night. I was fucking. You're a fire. And I hope that kids got what dies.

[02:32:34.350 --> 02:32:46.890]
I hope you all die. I'm a big fish and a little pond to see you. I'm a big fish and a little pond.

[02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:56.170]
Yeah. Why does anybody do anything? Well, now come down. I don't want to play the extra stuff. That's the extra stuff at the end of that bit.

[02:32:56.170 --> 02:33:01.890]
It always hits on the CD. You have to buy most bits in order to get that extra stuff. Here's a great cartoon.

[02:33:02.050 --> 02:33:11.490]
There is the Tin Man and the Skircro, but it's Cheney and Bush. And over Cheney's it says it. If only I had a heart and Bush is saying it.

[02:33:11.550 --> 02:33:15.930]
If only I had a brain. That's beautiful. Thank you very much. It's a lovely thing.

[02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:22.710]
Let me say it again. If they were showing all the powerful images from the Baghdad hospitals. Maybe that might have a little bit different impression.

[02:33:22.710 --> 02:33:29.510]
If you're one of those weak, neat, emotional people that's going to allow all your reasoning about what's been going on for a long time, three weeks plus,

[02:33:30.710 --> 02:33:36.630]
to be tempered by these very limited scenes that they're showing today, then you must be pretty simple. That's all I can tell you.

[02:33:37.350 --> 02:33:43.730]
You must be a perfect creature for television. And you wait till we get that Iraqi TV and radio on, man. Just wait. I'll let you buy tomorrow.

[02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:50.790]
They got the goddamn Rush Limbaugh show on. Speaking of that, if you're working for Real Jackass, if you're making like peanuts,

Is a butt ass smell it?

[02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:58.650]
What the hell am I always getting raped by men?

[02:34:58.850 --> 02:35:00.170]
You have a nice fat mo.

[02:35:00.490 --> 02:35:02.610]
I'm sure but I don't ever get raped by brothers.

[02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:04.130]
When and don't race men?

[02:35:04.290 --> 02:35:08.310]
And it's too bad that there is such a thing as an attractive man you know.

[02:35:08.310 --> 02:35:08.910]
Mau?

[02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:10.650]
What are you know you're crumb?

[02:35:10.970 --> 02:35:12.090]
What are you some kind of fairy?

[02:35:12.550 --> 02:35:14.990]
What are you go for your other monkey footy organ grind it down the hole?

[02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:16.410]
I'm not a queer.

[02:35:16.770 --> 02:35:18.730]
What do you know about being queer you moron?

[02:35:19.010 --> 02:35:20.490]
I've been right to not to know the difference.

[02:35:20.590 --> 02:35:21.690]
Sorry mo dad.

[02:35:21.850 --> 02:35:27.630]
Now see here we're supposed to be talking about sports here not about good looking men just men in general and nothing else.

[02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:30.370]
This is sports radio over here we love men.

[02:35:30.750 --> 02:35:32.270]
But I guess the city have a bird.

[02:35:32.650 --> 02:35:37.530]
I guess the other night I saw this commercial on overnight TV when this guy was growing out at the ocean see.

[02:35:37.530 --> 02:35:48.950]
On this island filled with strippers that are brought they looked okay but this guy in the commercial I would say in an objective sort of way he was pretty cute.

[02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:52.130]
Get out your left.

[02:35:52.530 --> 02:35:54.870]
Get left and did I give you clearance to left?

[02:35:55.310 --> 02:35:56.890]
Was this gonna scriptuate Mau?

[02:35:57.530 --> 02:35:57.830]
Yeah.

[02:35:58.150 --> 02:36:01.190]
And the guy was growing out of the islands you thought he was cute?

[02:36:01.350 --> 02:36:02.010]
Yeah that's right.

[02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:03.650]
Are you asked me to be objective?

[02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:06.130]
I actually asked and you still make fun of me.

[02:36:06.130 --> 02:36:07.870]
You wanna get fired again?

[02:36:08.050 --> 02:36:08.230]
How?

[02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:10.530]
That guy there had pinchable jaws.

[02:36:11.270 --> 02:36:12.810]
I'm sure we're too goddamn funny.

[02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:14.650]
That was George.

[02:36:15.830 --> 02:36:17.390]
That was George.

[02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:19.090]
You're Morgan grinders monkey?

[02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:26.150]
You know maybe I am in love with that mango munch and speak.

[02:36:26.710 --> 02:36:31.070]
He certainly does make a ring with my nose glow like a neon rainbow.

[02:36:33.010 --> 02:36:37.130]
Wanting him fired must have been just a re-enchantment suppressor through the power of the world.

[02:36:37.450 --> 02:36:41.110]
But I can't for anybody know what I want to enter his place.

[02:36:42.010 --> 02:36:43.850]
Get out of here all you you're all nuts.

[02:36:44.330 --> 02:36:45.230]
You're all...

[02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:46.930]
Hey I can't move.

[02:36:47.310 --> 02:36:49.250]
Look at the bulging your pants Mau.

[02:36:49.590 --> 02:36:49.990]
Oh no.

[02:36:50.370 --> 02:36:52.150]
If I move the wrong way out.

[02:36:52.750 --> 02:36:54.850]
Hey everybody, Momest is pants.

[02:36:55.410 --> 02:36:56.490]
Do do do do do do do you grub him?

Not that I mind it but I'm way too old

[02:41:53.930 --> 02:41:57.090]
I emphasize about being in bed

[02:41:57.870 --> 02:42:01.670]

That makes me lift my wig

[02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:49.730]
If ginger was a lover of mine

[02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:53.850]

[02:43:06.310 --> 02:43:10.230]
That's why a ginger and more gay union

[02:43:10.230 --> 02:43:14.350]
Would make me feel dizzy and gay

[02:43:14.350 --> 02:43:16.990]
Everybody follow my thousand balls

[02:43:16.990 --> 02:43:20.090]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union

[02:43:20.090 --> 02:43:23.990]
Would make my swirl-boney ass feel safe

[02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:28.310]
If we had a ginger and more gay union

[02:43:28.310 --> 02:43:31.490]
Then he wouldn't have to get me raped

[02:43:34.730 --> 02:43:37.990]

I'm a dare

[02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:34.170]
I'm a dare

[02:44:34.170 --> 02:44:35.350]
I'm a dare

[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:35.350]

[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:35.350]

[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:35.350]

[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:35.350]

[02:44:35.350 --> 02:44:47.890]
I'm a dare

[02:44:47.890 --> 02:44:50.670]
Stop it you moron! What's the matter moh?

[02:44:50.670 --> 02:44:51.750]
My wink fell off again

Ok, alright where were we?

[02:44:54.590 --> 02:44:56.910]
Spoils were in game back then

[02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:58.290]
I'll take it from here

[02:44:58.290 --> 02:45:01.170]

[02:45:46.750 --> 02:45:49.170]
A little sports host show

[02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:52.910]
What else are you there for?

[02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:57.530]
Gelvy talking like a baby

[02:45:57.530 --> 02:46:00.330]
Who needs a little training?

[02:46:01.210 --> 02:46:03.430]
Why can't you understand?

[02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:06.490]
You don't sound like a man

[02:46:07.530 --> 02:46:09.610]

[02:46:18.770 --> 02:46:19.970]
Gelvy

[02:46:19.970 --> 02:46:23.550]
Your lucky management don't care

[02:46:23.550 --> 02:46:25.450]
Cause Gelvy

[02:46:25.450 --> 02:46:29.350]

The sports can't wait till your voice cracks

[02:46:35.450 --> 02:46:40.390]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job

[02:46:40.390 --> 02:46:45.950]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop

[02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:47.530]

You think I want to throw up?

[02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:57.390]
You feel a squeaky boom

Yeah, yeah, forget about it. What do you want?

Is it true? You bet against Miami?

[02:51:39.970 --> 02:51:41.070]
I don't know what you're talking about.

[02:51:41.430 --> 02:51:43.530]
You bet against Miami?

[02:51:44.070 --> 02:51:45.570]
Yeah, I didn't bet against Miami.

[02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:47.650]
Bet against Miami?

[02:51:48.250 --> 02:51:49.350]
You got some noise, pal!

[02:51:49.810 --> 02:51:51.450]
Question it in my integrity, get it?

[02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:53.430]
Bet against Miami?

[02:51:54.410 --> 02:51:57.210]
How dare you! I didn't bet against nobody!

Now look, I talk to you, what an asshole!

[02:52:08.710 --> 02:52:09.650]
Hey, that guy, an asshole!

[02:52:10.010 --> 02:52:10.270]

That guy there!

[02:52:11.650 --> 02:52:12.970]
Why don't you say he's an asshole?

[02:52:13.250 --> 02:52:14.510]
I can't say words like that.

[02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:15.070]
Why not?

[02:52:15.350 --> 02:52:16.270]
That's not nice.

[02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:19.870]
Well, are you some kind of pussy?

[02:52:20.290 --> 02:52:21.350]
No, I just...

[02:52:21.350 --> 02:52:22.850]
Did you say you're good tap dancing again?

[02:52:22.850 --> 02:52:23.670]

[02:52:32.530 --> 02:52:33.750]
You see the bottom of my shoe?

[02:52:34.090 --> 02:52:34.850]
Yeah, but...

[02:52:35.590 --> 02:52:35.690]
Damn!

[02:52:36.150 --> 02:52:36.150]

[02:52:36.450 --> 02:52:36.790]
Damn!

[02:52:37.290 --> 02:52:38.890]
That's the you benghi-stomp!

[02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.710]
Damn!

[02:52:40.610 --> 02:52:40.890]
Damn!

[02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.950]
Damn!

[02:52:43.770 --> 02:52:44.030]
Damn!

[02:52:44.510 --> 02:52:44.510]

[02:52:44.970 --> 02:52:45.170]
Damn!

[02:52:46.330 --> 02:52:48.470]
We got... not an auction coming up.

[02:52:48.610 --> 02:52:49.070]
Oh boy!

[02:52:49.270 --> 02:52:51.130]
That's why we auction off an item of great value.

[02:52:51.130 --> 02:52:52.850]
You're slashing me, mo.

[02:52:53.310 --> 02:52:53.730]
Oh yeah.

[02:52:54.350 --> 02:52:55.510]
They're holding this way.

[02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:56.070]
Okay.

[02:52:56.610 --> 02:53:00.890]
Now, we got the auction these items off for a very, very good, good cause.

[02:53:01.390 --> 02:53:02.190]
Reach for the sky.

[02:53:02.610 --> 02:53:03.530]
What's that mean?

[02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.830]
It means stupid.

[02:53:05.210 --> 02:53:07.630]
If they don't give up a goat, we take it anyway, see?

[02:53:08.030 --> 02:53:09.590]
Oh, like reach for the sky!

[02:53:09.890 --> 02:53:10.810]
You're running or you're wigg.

[02:53:11.790 --> 02:53:12.670]
What's the matter, mo?

[02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.850]
I'm thinking.

[02:53:14.170 --> 02:53:15.410]
Just a joke, mo.

[02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:16.250]
A joke, huh?

[02:53:16.650 --> 02:53:17.970]
Yeah, I got a joke for you.

[02:53:18.130 --> 02:53:19.130]
Now that's funny.

[02:53:19.970 --> 02:53:22.170]
Now, uh, why do we got auction off this diet?

[02:53:22.290 --> 02:53:23.850]
Why not auction off your pee bed?

[02:53:24.170 --> 02:53:25.750]
Say, that's not a bad idea.

[02:53:26.050 --> 02:53:27.110]
I need to know when anyway.

[02:53:27.150 --> 02:53:27.930]
Yeah, please.

[02:53:27.970 --> 02:53:34.110]
But please let me tell my minions in paradise about the luxurious of a glades hotel and its magnificent spa.

[02:53:35.070 --> 02:53:39.450]
That's where my close place, little man, friend Jake Feedler and I go quite often.

[02:53:39.830 --> 02:53:41.270]
He's nothing like two men in a spa.

[02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:44.410]
Line there naked with just a doubt.

[02:53:45.050 --> 02:53:47.610]
Steady moisture, aeroyt and your balls.

[02:53:47.610 --> 02:53:49.790]
J-Sort hands.

[02:53:50.190 --> 02:53:51.990]
Get me caressing my butt, ux.

[02:53:52.990 --> 02:53:55.990]
Then grasp it on your holiday clothes, eh?

[02:53:56.450 --> 02:53:58.050]
You can't carry the way, mo.

[02:53:58.150 --> 02:53:58.870]
You're spright, mommy.

[02:53:59.210 --> 02:53:59.710]
Stop it.

[02:53:59.850 --> 02:54:00.850]
You are professional smook.

[02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:03.190]
How dare you interrupt the spot?

[02:54:03.370 --> 02:54:04.810]
Would you splash in me again?

[02:54:05.030 --> 02:54:06.390]
How did you splash, kid?

[02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:06.930]
No!

[02:54:07.930 --> 02:54:12.750]
You were splashing me with your disparic escape.

[02:54:14.690 --> 02:54:16.370]
You wanna see?

[02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:20.530]
The bill put them in my pants, queen.

[02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:23.930]
That, it smells like fox in a sketch.

[02:54:25.630 --> 02:54:27.710]
That's time you gotta brand new pants.

[02:54:28.090 --> 02:54:28.870]
Go, go, go, go, go.

[02:54:28.930 --> 02:54:29.290]
That's a no.

[02:54:29.630 --> 02:54:32.230]
That, that, that, that, that makes me feel good.

[02:54:33.310 --> 02:54:35.330]
Like an old cock-ass chute.

[02:54:36.970 --> 02:54:38.890]
It even feels nice.

[02:54:38.890 --> 02:54:42.870]
Like when I melt the hot wax in my eyes.

[02:54:44.770 --> 02:54:46.290]
This old one here is thanks.

[02:54:47.650 --> 02:54:49.850]
So I gotta get a brand new pick.

[02:54:51.850 --> 02:54:52.370]
There.

[02:54:52.850 --> 02:54:54.010]
You just splash me.

[02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:55.350]
It stinks.

[02:54:57.710 --> 02:54:59.010]
I'm so excited.

[02:54:59.390 --> 02:55:00.050]
I'm coming.

[02:55:02.090 --> 02:55:04.430]
Gee, thanks for being nice to me today, mo.

[02:55:04.730 --> 02:55:06.250]
Don't mention it, Goldie.

[02:55:06.250 --> 02:55:08.550]
You're not gonna get raped again today, I am old.

[02:55:08.710 --> 02:55:09.650]
Nah, you know why.

[02:55:09.950 --> 02:55:10.790]
Why is that, no?

[02:55:10.970 --> 02:55:12.530]
Cause rape's not funny.

[02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:14.750]
But I ain't gonna be a mean man no more.

[02:55:15.030 --> 02:55:17.150]
If they think that's funny, it's fine by me.

[02:55:17.310 --> 02:55:19.250]
Wow, you really changed your way.

[02:55:19.430 --> 02:55:20.490]
Ah, forget about it.

[02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:22.810]
I'm turning over all new fig newtons leaf.

[02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:25.610]
You have a nice day and power, nice mic, ugly friend.

[02:55:26.250 --> 02:55:26.670]
Hey, mo!

[02:55:27.130 --> 02:55:28.230]
Look out for that truck!

[02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:30.370]
Look out, look out, look out!

[02:55:30.370 --> 02:55:35.830]
Mo look like a shapeless pile of gold.

[02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:39.330]
You, you, you.

[02:55:39.330 --> 02:55:43.490]
To show my respect, I stole the shoe.

[02:55:43.690 --> 02:55:45.750]
I wasn't even pulled before that bastard.

[02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:47.010]
Who stood my shoes?

[02:55:47.850 --> 02:55:50.370]
I don't wanna say I'm glad.

[02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:54.890]
Outside of being a nasty old schmuck, he wasn't bad.

[02:55:55.650 --> 02:55:57.330]
It's a machia.

[02:55:57.330 --> 02:55:59.350]
Oh, how is David's dad?

[02:56:00.670 --> 02:56:00.670]

[02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:04.070]
Oh, how is David's dad's blood is wingless?

[02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:06.790]
Oh, how is David's dad?

[02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:08.070]
Blood is wingless?

[02:56:08.530 --> 02:56:10.730]
Oh, how is David's dad?

[02:56:10.990 --> 02:56:12.070]
Blood is wingless?

[02:56:12.690 --> 02:56:14.390]
Oh, how is David's dad?

[02:56:14.410 --> 02:56:19.410]
22 to 1 to 5, 60 got the mad dog from the master's from Augusta, from Outtawood somewhere.

[02:56:19.970 --> 02:56:22.330]
One o'clock, three o'clock, he got the Hank Goldberg show in studio.

[02:56:22.830 --> 02:56:25.110]
Six thirty, Marlins on a Dreck.

[02:56:26.830 --> 02:56:29.330]
Marlins host the Met 705, any interest?

[02:56:29.510 --> 02:56:29.670]
No.

[02:56:30.230 --> 02:56:33.210]
Any came after the game from G.A. Joe and Marco were not to show you how much.

[02:56:33.330 --> 02:56:34.710]
Oh, look at that George past the Marlins.

[02:56:35.350 --> 02:56:36.970]
We got a battle going on here.

[02:56:38.010 --> 02:56:44.350]
Neoranges.com we asked today, which of these sends you diving to the dial and change the station's fastest?

[02:56:46.110 --> 02:56:47.430]
George's voice, 112.

[02:56:48.590 --> 02:56:49.990]
Marlins baseball, 108.

[02:56:50.650 --> 02:56:51.870]
Religion talk 93.

[02:56:52.210 --> 02:56:53.930]
Mohawar David's voice 76.

[02:56:54.970 --> 02:56:56.050]
Golf talk 57.

[02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:57.790]
Race track talk 50.

[02:56:58.290 --> 02:56:59.550]
Yeldy's voice 28.

[02:57:00.390 --> 02:57:02.350]
Hockey talk 20, word talk 19.

[02:57:02.730 --> 02:57:04.550]
And talk about Mohawar, which we're doing this hour.

[02:57:04.770 --> 02:57:06.290]
It's still stuck there on only 8.

[02:57:06.510 --> 02:57:07.310]
They love it.

[02:57:08.350 --> 02:57:10.990]
So when he says he's the only topic conversation we say.

[02:57:11.770 --> 02:57:12.310]
All right.

[02:57:12.470 --> 02:57:12.830]
Thank you.

[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:14.410]
Something we can thank him for.

[02:57:14.490 --> 02:57:16.030]
And don't ever stick your head in the door again, by the way.

[02:57:16.030 --> 02:57:18.830]
I noticed Carlos just got the schedules for next week.

[02:57:18.830 --> 02:57:19.790]
His name is on there.

[02:57:20.670 --> 02:57:22.710]
Was that the schedule in that part you had?

[02:57:23.250 --> 02:57:23.530]
Yes.

[02:57:23.890 --> 02:57:25.110]
Doesn't have Mohawar down there.

[02:57:27.730 --> 02:57:28.990]
21 till 1.

[02:57:30.090 --> 02:57:31.490]
I have 560 W.

[02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:34.530]
You're right.

[02:57:35.170 --> 02:57:35.590]
Wow.

[02:57:35.870 --> 02:57:36.730]
I wonder what that means.

[02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.430]
Uh oh.

[02:57:39.030 --> 02:57:39.510]
Wow.

[02:57:39.830 --> 02:57:41.510]
You know, I picked the bad date of quitsnith and glued.

[02:57:43.010 --> 02:57:44.550]
Anyway, speaking of a sniff in it.

[02:57:44.670 --> 02:57:47.790]
If you want to lose some weight, if you're trying to be in a big fat tub

[02:57:47.790 --> 02:57:49.350]
like so many of us have been for years.

[02:57:49.890 --> 02:57:51.290]
Like my good friend Julio, engineering.

[02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:53.110]
Lost 25 pounds.

[02:57:53.390 --> 02:57:55.590]
Like the beast who used to be good friend of ours.

[02:57:55.790 --> 02:57:56.690]
Good little Brian London.

[02:57:57.030 --> 02:57:59.390]
Used to be a friend of ours till he started doing it with Donna Shalela.

[02:58:00.210 --> 02:58:00.930]
Concording that is.

[02:58:00.970 --> 02:58:01.370]
They're concerning.

[02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:03.970]
Anyway, he lost 60 pounds in balance for life.

[02:58:04.030 --> 02:58:04.710]
He can do the same thing.

[02:58:04.930 --> 02:58:08.590]
It's the delicious, the easy way to lose the weight because number one.

[02:58:08.850 --> 02:58:10.550]
They supply all the food for it to keep you full.

[02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:13.290]
And number two, you don't have to count any calories or carbohydrates

[02:58:13.290 --> 02:58:15.590]
or figure out any convoluted formula.

[02:58:15.930 --> 02:58:18.530]
And number three, there are no dangerous pills or drugs to take.

[02:58:19.130 --> 02:58:22.870]
They bring your little black sack every morning by 6 in the am right to wherever you want.

[02:58:23.010 --> 02:58:23.430]
To your house.

[02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:25.390]
To your work, to your neighbors wherever you're going to be.

[02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:28.670]
And in your little black sack is all the food you need for the entire day.

[02:58:28.750 --> 02:58:31.530]
You just choose between two alternatives for each meal every day.

[02:58:31.550 --> 02:58:32.090]
You're on a program.

[02:58:32.290 --> 02:58:33.810]
That's the only tough choice you'll have to make.

[02:58:34.410 --> 02:58:38.570]
In your sack, three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, all fresh and delicious goodies.

[02:58:38.930 --> 02:58:42.690]
Chicken dishes and beef and egg dishes, all kinds of great stuff.

[02:58:43.850 --> 02:58:45.550]
And the wages pours off your body.

[02:58:45.910 --> 02:58:46.570]
Simple as can be.

[02:58:46.930 --> 02:58:49.230]
And like I said, plenty of food need to keep you full all day long.

[02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:51.770]
You won't have to worry about shopping and about snacking in between

[02:58:51.770 --> 02:58:53.930]
because they give you lots and lots of good stuff to eat.

[02:58:54.250 --> 02:58:58.130]
So lose the weight now once and for all, stay to hell alive and look a lot better too.

[02:58:58.410 --> 02:59:00.130]
Call balance for life because it really works.

[02:59:00.270 --> 02:59:02.570]
Call 954-568-3229.

[02:59:04.850 --> 02:59:06.550]

[02:59:06.550 --> 02:59:09.030]
Or check them out at WickedWorldWideWeb if you like it.

[02:59:09.450 --> 02:59:10.890]
BalanceForLife.com.

[02:59:10.890 --> 02:59:12.550]
Ride and local!

[02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:15.570]
You're sports video 560-Q-A-M!

[02:59:15.570 --> 02:59:16.690]
You A-M!

[02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:19.170]
Chamberlain, rate me.

[02:59:19.290 --> 02:59:20.230]
Forget about it.

[02:59:20.510 --> 02:59:21.530]
That's what I say.

[02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:23.750]
As that for a funny show idea.

[02:59:24.210 --> 02:59:26.750]
If I may borrow a phrase from the great model Alan.

[02:59:27.070 --> 02:59:27.650]
Hello, Dare.

[02:59:28.010 --> 02:59:29.630]
Everybody in Paradise Land.

[02:59:30.050 --> 02:59:31.430]
I'm Howard Davided.

[02:59:31.690 --> 02:59:35.650]
I hope you'll join me each and every Friday for my forget about it, Joe.

[02:59:35.650 --> 02:59:39.850]
That's when I opened the phone lines to all three of my regular low-income callers

[02:59:39.850 --> 02:59:42.730]
and led them ventured on what the bother and death.

[02:59:43.050 --> 02:59:44.790]
I was up all night dreaming this one up.

[02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:48.130]
At first I thought I'd go in with hand puppets like Sandy Becker.

[02:59:48.470 --> 02:59:51.350]
Or maybe a fold to a vocal whisper quake.

[02:59:51.630 --> 02:59:52.910]
But management and I agree.

[02:59:53.250 --> 02:59:54.650]
This will be a real showstopper.

[02:59:55.590 --> 02:59:57.310]
Now I run a family type show here.

[02:59:57.470 --> 03:00:00.650]
So I don't want no references to fixed jigger bowls or baggage gizlas.

[03:00:01.550 --> 03:00:05.630]
Other than that, I promise you a hilarious cacophony, a high jigsaw.

[03:00:05.630 --> 03:00:07.630]
And open conversation.

[03:00:07.870 --> 03:00:08.890]
Forget about it Friday.

[03:00:09.330 --> 03:00:13.350]
That goes for listening to 560 WQAM.

[03:00:13.730 --> 03:00:14.290]
Fat bad.

[03:00:14.730 --> 03:00:17.890]
I'm honoured and grateful that you would see me today.

[03:00:18.250 --> 03:00:20.510]
Tell me, my most valued friend.

[03:00:20.870 --> 03:00:22.870]
For what reason do you bother me today?

[03:00:23.130 --> 03:00:25.310]
I want a session of it on my own.

[03:00:25.430 --> 03:00:28.290]
And what has he done to reserve such a fate?

[03:00:28.510 --> 03:00:29.530]
He's a mean man.

[03:00:29.930 --> 03:00:31.330]
A very mean man.

[03:00:31.590 --> 03:00:32.630]
He wants to be mobilized.

[03:00:33.510 --> 03:00:37.550]
You're saying us too, but I will have a safe and tolerant doe!

[03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:38.430]
Thank you guys, Polar!

[03:00:43.050 --> 03:00:44.530]

[03:00:47.950 --> 03:00:48.470]

[03:01:09.790 --> 03:01:12.670]
What do you mean you're not mo? I'm just filling in today. I'm boke of Brian.

[03:01:12.790 --> 03:01:17.070]
Oh, the Brian. I must have got confused this year. He's naked. It looks like a noisker.

[03:01:17.310 --> 03:01:19.650]
Yeah, it does, doesn't it? So where's more?

[03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:23.410]
Well he knows Geldie put a contract out on him so he's siding out at Scougans.

[03:01:23.890 --> 03:01:27.070]
Scougans, huh? Yeah, and he's using Clarence for a human shield.

[03:01:27.210 --> 03:01:30.570]
I know that's going. Come on, let's go. I gotta down the door for the god's help.

[03:01:30.570 --> 03:01:32.510]
Okay, let's go.

[03:01:37.710 --> 03:01:42.230]
My mascot is full. Would you like another kid to coffee?

[03:01:42.550 --> 03:01:42.750]
Yes.

[03:01:43.470 --> 03:01:44.230]
I know.

[03:01:45.470 --> 03:01:49.770]
Well, you know Clarence, what do you say we blow this pot stand for a little sport hold

[03:01:49.770 --> 03:01:53.830]

[03:01:54.250 --> 03:01:58.230]
Sports? Oh, don't say it like that. You know, I guess sports.

[03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:01.350]
Sports.

[03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:01.930]
Sports.

[03:02:02.010 --> 03:02:03.930]
Night-to-one. Sports.

[03:02:04.330 --> 03:02:06.970]
Sports. No women. Just men.

[03:02:07.730 --> 03:02:10.510]
Boys. Damn. Give my half a little bit.

[03:02:11.970 --> 03:02:15.310]
Ha ha. I got hit. The jigs up all.

[03:02:15.450 --> 03:02:17.030]
They hurt it. Yeah, what about it?

[03:02:17.230 --> 03:02:18.830]
Uh, and you're sure we can save jigs?

[03:02:19.170 --> 03:02:21.910]
Pick up them pink chickens. Hey, everybody.

[03:02:22.230 --> 03:02:23.850]
This way, show me.

[03:02:24.130 --> 03:02:25.250]
Come on, get up.

[03:02:25.250 --> 03:02:25.710]
I'm not here.

[03:02:26.070 --> 03:02:26.270]
I'm not here.

[03:02:26.270 --> 03:02:26.270]

[03:02:26.270 --> 03:02:29.090]
God, I'm like, just want to see you having fun, though.

[03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:32.130]
Tell me why you little say.

[03:02:32.510 --> 03:02:34.630]
What are you doing outweighin' five and chills?

[03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:36.590]
Well, my wife likes it so much.

[03:02:36.770 --> 03:02:38.370]
I always press like this now.

[03:02:38.610 --> 03:02:38.790]
She.

[03:02:39.390 --> 03:02:40.050]
Oh, oh, oh.

[03:02:40.750 --> 03:02:42.150]
You like it you're better than me.

[03:02:42.570 --> 03:02:42.930]
Sports.

[03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:43.830]
Huh.

[03:02:45.470 --> 03:02:46.190]
It's a toy.

[03:02:47.650 --> 03:02:48.590]
It's a toy.

[03:02:48.930 --> 03:02:50.090]
It's a toy.

[03:02:50.330 --> 03:02:51.270]
It's a toy.

[03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:53.510]
And I'll tell somewhere in Hell in the Bell.

[03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:55.070]
It's El Michael's.

[03:02:56.510 --> 03:02:57.270]
Yep.

[03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:58.470]
Oh.

[03:02:59.110 --> 03:02:59.150]
Oh.

[03:02:59.650 --> 03:02:59.650]

[03:03:00.250 --> 03:03:00.250]

[03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:02.130]
Oh.

[03:03:03.230 --> 03:03:03.350]
Oh.

[03:03:03.350 --> 03:03:23.470]
CRAP CRAP K has caught me...

[03:03:23.470 --> 03:03:24.970]
My长!

[03:03:26.310 --> 03:03:27.610]
He was shot up, stupidly.

[03:03:38.690 --> 03:03:41.430]
I remember you put those nylons on Joe's name?

[03:03:41.750 --> 03:03:43.270]
Oh yeah sure.

[03:03:43.690 --> 03:03:44.990]
It was at the park, Sheridan.

[03:03:45.750 --> 03:03:47.210]
You want to know what it is?

[03:03:47.290 --> 03:03:49.850]
That was quite a twist we had that night.

[03:03:52.290 --> 03:03:54.950]
Yeah, so how's Paradise?

[03:03:55.330 --> 03:03:59.450]
Well, our day there still on 560 WQA.

[03:04:02.190 --> 03:04:06.570]
Hi, welcome back to another fine installment of the Malafoosius Mohameda David Show.

[03:04:06.790 --> 03:04:08.870]
We can take your emails now.

[03:04:08.910 --> 03:04:11.330]
It was like a ticket to Spachgok at a computer.

[03:04:11.910 --> 03:04:14.110]
So click there mo, click there.

[03:04:14.350 --> 03:04:16.710]
Yes, shut your mouth, I'm computing over here.

[03:04:17.470 --> 03:04:19.690]
I'll email them until I figure this thing out.

[03:04:20.650 --> 03:04:25.590]
You know, none of this would have been necessary if they didn't wedge me in between two non-sports.

[03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:26.450]
Mr. Shows.

[03:04:27.730 --> 03:04:29.310]
What's wrong with this piece of crap?

[03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:30.930]
They got a call over here mo.

[03:04:31.230 --> 03:04:31.770]
Yeah, what?

[03:04:32.970 --> 03:04:35.250]
Why can't you access your email?

[03:04:35.450 --> 03:04:37.550]
I don't know, click this, I click that, I put the thing in the thing.

[03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:44.470]
No, why isn't it coming to me to show you guys how to perform tasks in the company?

[03:04:44.470 --> 03:04:45.850]
That won't speak that way.

[03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:50.570]
Every day you don't know how my life is falling apart.

[03:04:51.210 --> 03:04:54.310]
Hey, pal, when I said wedge, I didn't mean the sandwich.

[03:04:54.530 --> 03:04:54.990]
Wow!

[03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:58.050]
So she went anywhere associated with the pipe smoker.

[03:04:58.470 --> 03:05:00.930]
Hey, look, look, look, we got an email.

[03:05:01.410 --> 03:05:05.090]
You suck, brink back, brink and southern desert.

[03:05:05.530 --> 03:05:06.590]
Who's brink and southern desert?

[03:05:06.930 --> 03:05:10.470]
And there are only those guys, there are more anybody needs.

[03:05:10.970 --> 03:05:12.450]
Wait, brink, it's another one.

[03:05:12.750 --> 03:05:18.170]
This one says a mo blows, brink back, brink and southern desert.

[03:05:18.610 --> 03:05:19.330]
Damn it.

[03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:20.550]
What happened?

[03:05:20.970 --> 03:05:21.970]
It crashed, no.

[03:05:22.350 --> 03:05:23.050]
Damn it, man.

[03:05:23.790 --> 03:05:24.450]
Damn it, man.

[03:05:24.490 --> 03:05:24.490]

[03:05:24.570 --> 03:05:25.350]
Get past it.

[03:05:25.850 --> 03:05:26.530]
Stop it, man.

[03:05:27.170 --> 03:05:28.790]
Stop it, stop it, fast.

[03:05:29.470 --> 03:05:30.310]
Stop it, man.

[03:05:30.530 --> 03:05:33.130]
I heard you have a computer, Greek, so I thought...

[03:05:33.130 --> 03:05:34.330]
Hey, you're not a felcant, aren't you?

[03:05:34.510 --> 03:05:34.810]
Sure.

[03:05:35.250 --> 03:05:36.490]
I don't need your help.

[03:05:36.690 --> 03:05:37.530]
Get out of here, you bum.

[03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:38.270]
Okay, dude.

[03:05:38.710 --> 03:05:40.310]
You know what, me to help you with the computer?

[03:05:40.650 --> 03:05:42.250]
Guess that means I got a rapier.

[03:05:42.370 --> 03:05:43.770]
That chance of punk-like you.

[03:05:44.070 --> 03:05:44.930]
Boom, boom, boom.

[03:05:44.930 --> 03:05:45.610]
Mom, dude.

[03:05:45.850 --> 03:05:47.030]
That was on my private side.

[03:05:47.030 --> 03:05:48.930]
Dude, you got a bonus.

[03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:50.710]
Boom, boom, boom.

[03:05:50.850 --> 03:05:50.870]
Boom, boom, boom.

[03:05:50.870 --> 03:05:52.230]
Where the hell is this lady standing?

[03:05:52.430 --> 03:05:53.790]
Okay, damn it.

[03:05:53.790 --> 03:05:54.530]
Boom, boom, boom.

[03:05:54.530 --> 03:05:55.590]
Dude, yo, yo, yo.

[03:05:55.950 --> 03:05:57.230]
You're gonna rape Mo!

[03:05:57.730 --> 03:05:58.030]
Damn it.

[03:05:59.150 --> 03:05:59.150]

[03:05:59.750 --> 03:06:00.230]
Damn it.

[03:06:00.230 --> 03:06:00.410]
What?

[03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:03.310]
I hear you get some great emails.

[03:06:04.490 --> 03:06:06.270]
1251 and 562 WQM.

[03:06:06.270 --> 03:06:08.110]
They're celebrating in Dearborn Michigan, baby.

[03:06:08.250 --> 03:06:10.290]
For the Arab community, they're dancing in the streets.

[03:06:10.510 --> 03:06:11.850]
They're waving their flag, they're jumping around.

[03:06:12.010 --> 03:06:14.290]
They're gonna look at us kids with their drums and bag, Dad, huh?

[03:06:14.570 --> 03:06:14.890]
Look at that.

[03:06:15.730 --> 03:06:17.930]
These little tiny selective slices of life,

[03:06:17.930 --> 03:06:19.070]
it's a beautiful thing, man.

[03:06:19.210 --> 03:06:21.510]
Let's play the national anthem and wave it proudly.

[03:06:21.530 --> 03:06:22.430]
Okay, the flag too.

[03:06:23.350 --> 03:06:23.970]
Now, tell you something.

[03:06:24.090 --> 03:06:26.010]
If your carpets look like they need intensive care,

[03:06:26.010 --> 03:06:28.410]
like they're really in bad shape, don't spend a lot of money

[03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:29.910]
because you're wasting it by a new carpeting.

[03:06:30.130 --> 03:06:30.750]
Cost you a fortune.

[03:06:31.250 --> 03:06:31.910]
Do the smart thing.

[03:06:31.970 --> 03:06:34.250]
Make one easy call to my good pizons at dry concepts.

[03:06:34.650 --> 03:06:36.270]
And you'll thank me for turning you on to them.

[03:06:36.350 --> 03:06:38.390]
If you haven't called them yet, what can you be waiting for?

[03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:40.770]
I've been using it in my house and talking about these people

[03:06:40.770 --> 03:06:43.690]
on the air for over 20 long, amazing years.

[03:06:43.690 --> 03:06:44.590]
And they're still doing it right.

[03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:46.910]
They're still the best people in the world that make an old,

[03:06:47.170 --> 03:06:50.150]
nasty looking carpeting or even recent carpeting that's schmutzzy.

[03:06:50.410 --> 03:06:51.270]
Look just like brand new.

[03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:53.850]
When it get done, your carpets, like I said, look brand new.

[03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:55.650]
They smell them in the first, they're drying it a couple hours,

[03:06:56.010 --> 03:06:57.790]
and you'll be amazed at how great they look.

[03:06:58.150 --> 03:07:00.090]
They also do a stupendous job of cleaning your drapes,

[03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:01.970]
expensive area rugs, all your good stuff.

[03:07:02.230 --> 03:07:03.690]
And those are all your own flying carpets too,

[03:07:03.770 --> 03:07:04.750]
for your next trip to Baghdad.

[03:07:05.070 --> 03:07:06.850]
If you have problems with pet orders, milder voters,

[03:07:07.050 --> 03:07:09.210]
caused by water damage, they'll make those go away too.

[03:07:09.290 --> 03:07:11.170]
And don't forget, when you call dry concepts,

[03:07:11.330 --> 03:07:12.710]
you don't have to worry about any scams

[03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:13.930]
because they don't play that game.

[03:07:14.330 --> 03:07:16.770]
No rip offs, no per room craft.

[03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:18.730]
They give you a written guaranteed price

[03:07:18.730 --> 03:07:20.850]
before they start doing their amazing job

[03:07:20.850 --> 03:07:23.510]
of dry cleaning those carpeting and void it into a super job.

[03:07:23.970 --> 03:07:25.110]
Call them toll free from anywhere.

[03:07:25.290 --> 03:07:27.170]
You'll never think about calling anybody else again.

[03:07:27.690 --> 03:07:30.090]
1-800-248-5071.

[03:07:30.590 --> 03:07:33.010]
That's 1-800-248-5071,

[03:07:33.290 --> 03:07:35.050]
or log onto their website and give more information

[03:07:35.050 --> 03:07:36.390]

[03:07:36.650 --> 03:07:38.490]
Don't forget, when you do business with dry concepts,

[03:07:38.650 --> 03:07:40.830]
you're clean today, you can entertain tonight.

[03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:42.690]
My life and love.

[03:07:43.210 --> 03:07:45.030]
This is 4356.

[03:07:45.630 --> 03:07:47.170]
You're way too, yeah.
