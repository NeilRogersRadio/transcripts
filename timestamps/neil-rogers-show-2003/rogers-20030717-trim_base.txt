[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.580]
Neil sleeping with the beast as he spends days on vacation the beast went up to Toronto to spend a few days with you

[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.060]
No, the beast actually the reason that he's out there this week

[00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.280]
Because current stiff them. Oh, yeah, Clarence has taken his job. That's a that's certainly a

[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.700]
Great great horrible piece on the beast in the city link. That's really awful nasty

[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.880]
He has no chance to win

[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.020]
They should have showed the full shot of him in the toilet

[00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.840]
Not just toilet paper on his ugly face

[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.140]
Suffers back. He's got no anything. He's just a and then to talk about reason out rich parents

[00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.220]
Well, who the hell gives a credit?

[00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.240]
He's gonna check with rich parents

[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.780]
Yeah, yeah, I think he might be I think him in Clarence that's sorry might be there

[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.560]
Maybe a little more truth to that than we realize now the reason is clearance as a date tonight as we all go to hand out

[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.960]
Cheeseburgers for breast cancer with what he's got a date with one

[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.420]
He's got no he's got a date with a girl going to the Coral Springs cheese with a real living and breathing girl

[00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.300]
And I'm gonna be like a living witness

[00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.340]
No, what do you mean about me today for about that? You know low by blow on us tomorrow morning

[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.460]
You said you were gonna ask me about Greg read it on Tuesday and I know he's throwing out the first pitch Saturday night

[00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.600]
You think he'll bounce it in I do no I think Greg is gonna hold out for a longer contract with the Marlins

[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.580]
Yeah, I think he will too with the care line of mudcasts

[00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.040]
He's got he's gonna threaten to sue the Marlins if they don't give him a longer contract

[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.740]
So it turns out Howard has a blood disorder and he's gonna have to seek treatment

[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.280]
Come on. Yeah, yeah hasn't showed up for work today. He was at the blood doctor yesterday

[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.260]
We're thinking there may be something serious

[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.960]
We're gonna have to have his wife gonna do it next week for five days now

[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.240]
Let's put that story to rest okay because we finally got the real story

[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.080]
We pieced it together as close as we can get and the reason that you won't read about it in the newspapers because Greg is to

[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.520]
Emperors to tell Barry Jackass his mouthpiece about this story when they shift it all the time

[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.900]
And this is your fault by the way

[00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.020]
Yeah, when they had to make room for you 8 to 10 and you can kiss

[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.600]
6 to 10 advise a matter of fact now with his story yeah, they violated most contract because it's specifically said 6 to 9

[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.660]
I don't have any 6 to 10 at you know wishes. I would be 8 to 10. I want to lead into you

[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.400]
So I'm gonna take out the world a crap

[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.340]
So I made a mess. I am now your dad so as a

[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.580]
Moe and his agent attorney whoever they they made him an offer they couldn't refuse so they had to rewrite his whole deal and

[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.380]
It's said of an so on and he's there for about 100 years

[00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660]
Hey, you know that the lease house the Panthers two days before

[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.520]
Consisting Toronto both teams are gonna suck so bad that could be the toilet bowl of hockey

[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.840]
It's it's so deep pressing out the big news here is that the Leafs just a reside wait be like

[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.440]
I'm telling you how bad thing I got better news remember last week when you were bragging about the 75 cents dollar

[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.960]
Where he had 69 not her know it all what do you think?

[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.960]
There's worth nothing you're missing your

[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.720]
Seven to see and it's good for Americans. You don't get it. It's cheaper to live here asshole

[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.300]
Your beef is filled with mucus and disease you you worry about your meat now worry about my

[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.680]
There's 40 people dying and some respiratory

[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.680]
You know Marlon tickets away when you should have been doing a tribute to Celia Cruz this morning

[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.780]
Celia Cruz and all of her dancing. What do I care when a whole man drives over people at the Santa Monica pair killing people at the

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.180]
Farmers markets away matters. You know what his punishment is did you read about it?

[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.420]
They're giving him a new cane no there they banished him to Halendale. I heard he was gonna be in

[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.020]
Harry Rosenberg is gonna get given the key to the city in Halendale. Oh, yeah, well

[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.720]
Lovely area. Doesn't it drive rail run through there is a matter of friends see what's his disguise name Russell Weller

[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.200]
He was driving a Buickless Saber. Yeah, it was a nice red one. They're gonna

[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.960]
Give him a nice Jew canoe a Lincoln continental to drive up and down

[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:37.340]
Federal Highway in Halendale the Panthers extended their broadcast agreement with WQM 560 Greg Reed cut the deal and overall

[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.060]
Salad would less than two ice-tea. Well, that's something since you can't get sick

[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.620]
I said how about taking jigsaw the new day games on the radio. I already offered my services to the station management that if jigs

[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.560]
Would have a heart attack or some of the arm of cancer would read your body. Obviously. Yes. I would do a one or two day stint

[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.520]
Because there's one thing that I can do is call hockey game people may think I'm an a hole, but I can call a hockey game

[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.940]
Mm-hmm. I'm not very good, but I can call it don't talk too much hockey in this town man forget about it

[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.940]
That's what you said about the Panthers or the

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.040]
Marlon's you know and what is this?

[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.120]
I'm talking about waiting to come out in a week. I'm not gonna be part of that waiting book if I wanted to give away

[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.100]
200 Marlon tickets every day. That's the same 200 free loaders. That's what where the news are I know I know

[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.860]
I know I got news for why we can save your precious airtime, which we want to hear you

[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.020]
We don't want to hear you giving me a Marlon ticket. Listen to me. I'm listening. Give away season tickets to the same

[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.580]
People that you don't have to do it every day. I agree with you now. Let me ask you this question

[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.260]
Why do you think for some for

[00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.820]
Procrastra is reason that I'm gonna be in the

[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:41.640]
Minute up with the spring book. Why am I suddenly involved in the spring? I was here for like two days

[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.780]
Bull crap. No, you've got me rattled with some kind of ratings thing in the spring

[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.060]
You talk to me after the summer book and fall book April time in with anyone. I was here. Oh, no

[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.740]
We're counting on you. I don't want to put too much on your shoulders, but we're counting on you

[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.300]
Some guy wrote in the hours showing the word some guy wrote in the hours showed us that I can't stand the new guys Jeff

[00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.320]
Farrell. Yeah, so I mean that no one knew me until I was a

[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:11.540]
Rivermer's first names. Is it really? Yeah, for a mer? That's Jeff and his wife is their name is Farrell a Dennis

[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.760]
Pond man. Send him back. Oh, don't know. It's my name's Farrell. Yes

[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:24.040]
Shimmer. He's I will have you ever met Denise potpan? I know Danny, but I don't know Denise. Yeah

[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.020]
Denise here. Here's his here's his most famous line on the Panther broadcast like a really really

[00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.700]
Yeah, he said that on the air. Yeah, that's terrific. Uh-huh, and that was one of his better lines

[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.640]
Do you think up he wrote to me in the hall of fame and if that one didn't impress you he said

[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.660]
A lot of spoons in the year. Yeah. Oh my God

[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.580]
That's Denise potpan. Yeah, I've done frog in the dictionary his pictures next to it

[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.440]
I don't give a flying crab about p-ros. He's a major ass

[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.200]
P-ros P-ros used to sit across from well not used to but one night

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.960]
He came up to pop it all park in the dining room

[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.140]
Santa the table across from us and he's sitting there with some sleazy broad and he's got he's got a hundred dollar bills

[00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.620]
And I from what people tell me does this all the time to try to impress everybody

[00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.860]
He's got a stack a hundred dollar bills on the table never cashed about losing and losing and losing his ass

[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.560]
Sounds like Dennis Rodman anybody

[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.700]
It says that p-ros doesn't have a compulsive gambling problems full of crap

[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.680]
He's an asshole should he be in the hall of fame? Yes, I was reading article yesterday about the Roberto all

[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.820]
Alamar and the Toronto papers said that because of his spitting herchback because of that incident

[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.080]
He won't be in a hall of fame and he's in the same category with people like Ryan Sandberg who are just a little bit under

[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.240]
How can Ryan Sandberg not be in a hall of fame?

[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.580]
He was a class act

[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:41.000]
Ryan Sandberg was great and I'll give you a classic example Bill Mazer-Roskey is in a hall of fame for one reason

[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.400]
Because he hit the home run at 160 World States

[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.400]
No, he's in gives the best second basement of all time

[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:48.780]
Bill Mazer had an error in his career

[00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.340]
He's your crazy mind

[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.020]
He never committed an error at second base

[00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.560]
He's better than Ryan Sandberg

[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.240]
We turned the 6.3 double play turn the double play better than anybody in the history of baseball

[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:01.800]
Ryan Sandberg could hold Mazer-Roskey's the ball without an error

[00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.000]
Good oldest glove

[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.240]
Good oldest glove and you should know that old man

[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.180]
Don't start with you, Mazer-Roskey

[00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.660]
And Ryan Sandberg's season ticket holder 69 cent mad cow eating herpes

[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.120]
Most blood disorder I gotta go, I'm gonna have a...

[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.560]
Is that true about most blood disorder?

[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.640]
No, but it's true that Greg redid the deal over two iced teas

[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.880]
Yeah, we can only pray about more

[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:24.860]
Oh, good luck

[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.780]
Have a great day Scott

[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:26.720]
Good luck to you

[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.560]
I'm listening on the next visco

[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.180]
The doctor has his hands full with Mr. Klepto

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.220]
Yeah, Dr. Visto, I have a problem

[00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.560]
I seem to...

[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.760]
I have a club domain problem

[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.760]
Sure, I know that's rare

[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.340]
Sure

[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.720]
I'm coming, I think you still may

[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.300]
Sure, how you tried masturbating

[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.280]
I...

[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.800]
Have not

[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.540]
I suggest you try masturbation

[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.780]
You mean...

[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.840]
In the store?

[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.920]
No, no, I mean now, for instance, uh...

[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.280]
Uh, while you were...

[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.300]
I'm...

[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.280]
At home

[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.000]
I'm masturbating now

[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.300]
No, I didn't mean now...

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.060]
Oh, yes

[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:16.060]
You misunderstood, I don't mean now on the phone

[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.380]
Oh, yes

[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:19.740]
You see, I am

[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:20.160]
Sure

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:22.780]
Sure

[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:23.760]
Sure

[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.340]
Oh

[00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.360]
Dr. Visto, weekdays at noon

[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.880]
Okay, the important reason that we play that today

[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.040]
masturbation could protect against prostate cancer

[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.800]
Study suggests

[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.180]
Oh!

[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.540]
In the Abritish Independent newspaper, ready for that?

[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.620]
I do that

[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:42.720]
Masturbating more than five times a week between the ages of 20 and 50 could protect men against prostate cancer

[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.280]
Australian researchers claim today

[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.700]
They think ejaculation, score, score, could flush cancer, cause and chemicals out of the prostate

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:53.800]
That walnut-sized sex gland that lies at the neck of the urethra and the bladder

[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.040]
Maybe we could play some urethra songs in a background for this

[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.820]
Okay, another possibility is that it induces the prostate cells to mature fully making them less susceptible to carcinogens

[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.160]
Not exciting?

[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.500]
Uh-huh, I'm excited

[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.100]
So precise

[00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:12.180]
Professor Graham Jarls from the Cancer Council of Victorian Melbourne Australia discovered the apparent link reported today in New Scientist magazine

[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.560]
After questioning a thousand seventy nine men to wait prostate cancer about their sexual habits

[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.100]
He then compared them with twelve hundred fifty nine men of the same age

[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.980]
He found that men who had ejaculated more than five times a week in their twenties

[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.280]
Were a third less likely to develop aggressive prostate cancer later in life

[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:37.480]
The results of the new study contradict previous studies which suggested that having many partners or frequent sex increases the risk of prostate cancer by up to forty percent

[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.840]
Professor Jarls recorded the overall number of ejaculations whether or not intercourse was involved and suggested

[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:46.740]
That infections caused by intercourse might help promote prostate cancer

[00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:53.460]
The more you flush the ducts out the less there is to hang around and damage the cells that lie on them said Professor Jarls

[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.440]
So when a doubt flush them out, squirt squirt, that's the message okay, that's new science

[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:02.420]
That's just a couple of weeks ago they were telling us that hair would grow on the palms of your hands and you would go insane

[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.220]
And now it's like good for you squirt squirt and a doubt while flush them out

[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.180]
I'm getting choked up about it

[00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.960]
I'll speak into getting choked up

[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.060]
I have to admit, although YouTube guys would never make our sales department

[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.700]
By the way, speaking of sales, George Hates, Gary Sarner, like poison, Gary you're an asshole

[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.040]
Nice to see that things haven't changed

[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.920]
What an asshole he is, you know

[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.120]
Yeah, I know

[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.780]
But before we get to that, you've made very poor salespeople because you almost didn't talk me into rewatching the end of a beautiful mind

[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.120]
And nobody in the audience did either by the way, what a great movie

[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.240]
Right, I'm a lousy salesperson, I'll admit that

[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.640]
Yes, and so is Voner boy

[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.320]
Sorry, my bad

[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:41.200]
No, seriously, if you had said, now it's really worth it, I mean, you know, there would have been a way

[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:43.880]
And it's just by luck, I don't know, I thought I'll give it a shot

[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.380]
And if you can withstand, if you can take some no-dos and withstand the first 40 minutes which are slow as molasses

[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.340]
Oh my god, slow and ponderous

[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.940]
Kind of like listening to a pop-lid word speak, you know, from Woodward and Bernstein, Gary, here's CM on TV

[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:06.660]
No, he talks real slow and very deliberate Larry and he's very, oh god ponderous

[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.740]
So the first 30 to 40 minutes of that movie, you think nothing is ever going to happen, where is this thing going?

[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.420]
And then like you said, it turns out completely different

[00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.520]
Not what you think it was

[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:25.200]
In addition to which, because of the twist and turns in the story, you don't really know for sure what the deal is

[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:28.920]
That's right

[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.680]
I'm not one of those people that cries the movies a lot, but I was teared up at the end of that movie

[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.880]
It was tugging

[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:40.340]
You had to be a stone, you had to be a rock, an emotional stone, not to get at least get choked up a little bit

[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.800]
The last 20 minutes of that flick

[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.760]
Right, speech?

[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.180]
That speech is at the end

[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.280]
Oh beautiful mind, yeah, that's when it just hit me

[00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:51.620]
I just went to peace and I didn't go to peace, but I did get a little, you know, a couple of tears

[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.380]
So anyway, guess who else hates Mo?

[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.180]
I am very good authority

[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:06.680]
Joining the list of the thousands and millions of people all over America who hate Mo Howard David and like Poison

[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.940]
I don't want to mention names, but the name of the person is

[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.160]
I am very good

[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.560]
Who allegedly hates him like Poison

[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.180]
Are you starting up with him after just finding out about his blood?

[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:27.000]
When I think of him

[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.480]
Yeah, I'm hoping if we talk about it enough it'll put him over the edge, he can croak before Monday

[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:34.640]
Yeah, the Gellies doing pretty good by himself on there, by the way the audience likes that

[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.320]
Yeah, they do

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.800]
They do, and I like it too

[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.960]
Although I will say this Gellie, I mean at least while you're on, when you get rid of that Wonton tomato guy, Jesus God

[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.220]
No wonder Celia Cruz dies, he probably heard Wann on a morning show

[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.900]
Give her a brain tumor, I mean seriously wouldn't that put you over the edge?

[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.540]
I have Wann

[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.260]
Wann, you're beyond chronic, I don't think in our lifetime we ever had a chronic as bad as Wann

[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.820]
I mean one that we actually put on the ear

[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.060]
Oh, no

[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.480]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:00.320]
Yeah, right

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.940]
Oh, impossible

[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.760]
Anyway, we got a lot of Celia Cruz stuff to talk about

[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.560]
Good God

[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.400]
That McGell, you're such a silly spick me up, by the way McGell's gonna be a daddy

[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.640]
Wait a minute, I shouldn't have said that, should I?

[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:14.220]
No, we said it on the ear, we made it in the end

[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:14.900]
Wonder they get married?

[00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:16.660]
When are they getting married?

[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.880]
Or had they got married?

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:18.380]
In a month

[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.540]
They're getting married in a month and she's pregnant, that's bad

[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.940]
Ah, sliding it right under the wire, she's not gonna show

[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.320]
He slid it in before the wire if he has married

[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:32.000]
Ten, fourteen, five, sixty, WQM, happy Thursday, two, his sonny here, it's beautiful

[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.660]
So 73 degrees, low humidity

[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.160]
Same, we got that stones concert coming up on the 30th, the guests who are gonna be there, ACDC, Rush

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.580]
Ah, Isley Brothers

[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.400]
Just a take-up out

[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.680]
How low can those interest rates go?

[00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:50.000]

[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.320]
Yeah

[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:52.920]
It didn't play

[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:57.180]
Yeah, well how about if we play the, is that the end of the break?

[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.820]
Yeah, unfortunately

[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.900]
The big H

[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.020]
That's it?

[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.440]
The big H

[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:16.340]
The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people

[00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:20.940]
Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression

[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.200]
Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait

[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.540]
It's just the way it's going to be

[00:15:27.540 --> 00:15:34.280]
We like to be the dumb who say and it's him with a whine

[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.540]
Sit back and watch his head explode like a melon way to life

[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:48.400]
He tried to steal away Kuwait and beat the OUCHI

[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:55.480]
He'll let you go up to his head and blow away this heat

[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.140]
He won't need to be us, I got it too far

[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:02.560]
Then he'd come way up with the land and the sun

[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.580]
Fight for life whatever it is

[00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.100]
I'll be the champion in the game with the sheep

[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.560]
He's going to pay

[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:12.660]
The sun will pay

[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.180]
The sun will pay

[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.460]
The sun will pay

[00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.200]
Boy sure haven't heard that in a long time you know it?

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.760]
About 100 years

[00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.120]
Anyway here are we off to like kind of a rocky start here this morning or something?

[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.300]
Or is it just my imagination?

[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.300]
Yeah, was either my phone moving fingers or

[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:36.520]
That's probably what it was

[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.500]
Or what an act of God is that what it was?

[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.360]
Yeah, yeah

[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.340]
Here's the pull that George took yesterday

[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.260]
Good pull and excellent South Florida pull

[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.980]
I'm just going with the flow man

[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:46.900]
Well, no that's right that's South Florida for you

[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:48.160]
I hate what do you hate?

[00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.560]
Now George hates Gary Sarner like poison

[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.380]
I should have put away in Heisenga hates Moe and Anakin

[00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.420]
So does everybody else

[00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.200]
And the rumors hate George like poison

[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.340]
And the feeling is mutual

[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.840]
And I hate Moe like poison and I'll dance on his grave and fart in his face

[00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.580]
And other than that

[00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:03.120]
Everybody hates everybody in South Florida

[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.360]
See that's one of the big differences between a place like Toronto and South Florida

[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.740]
Everybody here basically if they don't like each other

[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.360]
They at least put on a good act and they get along and it's friendly

[00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.840]
And as opposed to down there where they want you to know how much they hate you like poison

[00:17:15.620 --> 00:17:19.420]
Is that my friend on line six the West Palm Beach call because you know it's not from West Palm

[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.820]
Here's West Palm Beach, hello

[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:23.140]
Hello

[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.860]
He's not even here I thought it was retire

[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.340]
We sure miss a day without him you know it

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.780]
Anyway here was the pull from George yesterday I hate Republicans to 102 that one hands down

[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:39.260]
I see I could have voted well Republican isn't the right term right wing assholes would have been a better term

[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.920]
Because not all Republicans are our right wing assholes just most

[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:48.660]
By the way they are going to bring Russ Weller from Santa Monica California 86 year old Russ Weller killed all those people yesterday

[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.440]
Hit the gasses to the break they're going to bring him to Hallendale

[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.640]
Give him the key to the city in turn and loosen a jukenoo

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.940]
I thought he was going to be more chauffeur

[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.980]
He's going to be Moe moe moe moe she who?

[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.940]
Religious people I hate religious people 140

[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.300]
I could have voted for that but I didn't

[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:08.220]
Asshole drivers 135 like Russell weller 86 of Santa Monica California coming soon to sunrise

[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.960]
Reality TV 109 people hate that

[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.920]
80 now there was a real good battle we had going on between you and Moe yesterday

[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.480]
I thought to myself how embarrassing when you're doing the show how embarrassing would that have been?

[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.320]
If you were like come really close luckily for you Moe pulled away

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:23.980]
Absolutely

[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:29.580]
He put on the actor burners and pulled away in spite of his blood disorder Moe had 87 votes

[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:33.860]
87 people hate him like poison 66 people hate George what?

[00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.120]
What?

[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.880]
66 you said it likes sports

[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.200]
Well I'm just getting so big I ate two pieces of generous salami because I ran out of bacon I forgot to get some

[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.820]
So I had a little bit of generous salami here Moe I'm like it's good stuff though

[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.580]
58 people including me said they hate South Florida that was my vote

[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:56.620]
That's all just and keep in mind that's 5% but that's 5% of the people are actually are there now

[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:03.120]
You see what I'm saying right in other words the people who bailed out because they can't stand the heat and humidity and the assholes and the driving and everything else

[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.320]
They're not even there to vote

[00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:06.360]
My life 40

[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.840]
45 people said I hate my life well isn't that great? I wonder if Bonerboy voted for that

[00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.960]
No he voted for George

[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.720]
I think what he was trying to say was

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.480]
I have no life

[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:28.340]
The homeless voice and the Cubans 40 now see that's amazing to me only 41 people said they hate Cubans I think it was

[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:29.120]
It went on late

[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.720]
Oh I went on for really what were there is a mate they had all night to vote on this homeless voice and Cubans how about Cubans?

[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.200]
How about Harala at least one thing you'll say homeless voice there are no Cubans in homeless voice are there?

[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.200]
Not that I know of

[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.860]
I never saw any

[00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:47.840]
I see white guys who look like they just crawl out of a dumpster and sparsos that's all I see I don't see any Cuban homeless voice people

[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.340]
Pretty much

[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.420]
So there's something we can say for the Cubans right?

[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.120]
Inclaible

[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:57.460]
34 people hate Democrats so let's see 202 a.t. Republicans 34 Democrats so that should give you a pretty good idea of this crowd

[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:00.960]
31 hate Pat Robertson late addition also

[00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:09.060]
28 hate the a bit hour our one to two hour that we do about now does that include like just Wednesdays or nearly or the fact we're doing it every day during the summertime?

[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:13.820]
Well we didn't make the distinction I see but that's only 2.3% right?

[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.900]
Hate it enough to vote for it 28 people at almost 1200 people

[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:22.560]
They don't hate it enough to call during that hour or like contribute

[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:25.540]
Well listen ask me if I care do I care? No

[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:32.380]
I like it not just because it kills an hour first of all it's the summertime people don't lot world war three

[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.720]
I learned this from the great jury Williams many years ago

[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:41.320]
Remember jury Williams because Tom jikershure don't oh that's right Tom's in LA getting wind and dine by all those Hollywood the big shots

[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.460]
But anyway in the summertime especially but even audio round itself Florida in the middle of the day in the afternoon people don't want heavy duty

[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:55.380]
They don't want world war three they want a few laughs it's hot they're frustrated with the drivers out there they're sweating up a storm

[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.620]
Their life is a turn into crap right and for from the rise they don't want like world worth three

[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.280]
Especially in the summertime when it's 100 degrees in the shade so that one to two hours a nice bread in addition

[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:13.880]
Which I got all these hundreds of new bits today between one and two I'm going to try to play everything stuff that we haven't like that last bit I played right haven't played in a long time

[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:29.580]
I love the way sawdemy starts oh yeah and there's nothing I can do about that because that's just the way it is which adds like a little flare to it

[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:50.840]
28 people hate to bid our too bad this is disturbing to me and it shows you how parochial south float is 23 people I'd foreigners I mean what does that mean foreigners you know people from other countries oh them kind I mean what kind of crap is that again that's another reason why if anybody says south Florida my name is a world class city

[00:21:50.840 --> 00:22:19.380]

[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:33.220]
white white star quiet storm Celia Cruz is dead and a hero only devoted a whole bunch of pages that story today I mean it took me 55 pages of fast

[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:40.980]
paper just to pronounce the old god damn story so I got a read like one or two pergaret and Miguel comes in there oh everybody knew Celia Cruz I said I never heard of her

[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:47.700]
I knew Freddie Cruz and I knew hector Cruz and I know Jose Cruz I was ball player heard ever

[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:54.980]
but we're gonna discuss seeing the Cruz momentarily what we do after the break and we got today's poll which I think is kind of like

[00:23:54.980 --> 00:24:01.340]
interesting I don't think we've ever done exactly that one you know who I left off of that so far I give up well we'll get to it I

[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:07.540]

[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:13.560]
a bunch of people and he feels very very sorry about it in fact his driving is he more than being a boy which is saying a lot only

[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:20.920]
Russell well has gotten excuse he's an old fart he's 86 years old he's clueless I'm a sixth driver see that in that nice I mean it's a horrible

[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:26.080]
story but at least it happened in California not in South Florida where it doesn't even make the newspaper anymore because it happens almost

[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:32.260]
every day maybe we can bring not only bring him to Halondale but we can get him a six year license in the mail what do you say Russ

picking on poor little chance her birthday see you guys are such bastards that you're gonna like scrub

[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.820]
her birthday with a negativity man no what did they took that point is to who do you hate you know if

[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.260]
it was me I'd say who do you love you know other than your friends and relatives who do you love

[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.280]
but I'm not doing that poor because I'm not fool South Florida now it was it was the perfect pull for

[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.460]
South Florida was excellent fact I was one of Georgia's first good pulls in in long time but turn man

[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:30.440]
years here's today's pull now the reason I did this aside from Neil is because I'm not one of those

[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:34.440]
guys that wants to do a pull where we I invite you to like slapping on their back oh we like

[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:40.680]
you know I hate that stuff I can't stand that what validate me oh and how can we don't put you on

[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.620]
here I don't know don't no we got some other ones to put on here let's see I'm adding George

[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.920]
Rodriguez I haven't told you the full yet well I had him anyway and then I'll say what it is when

[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.440]
I get around to it and I also left off Rick Rally and so it's cool remember we have to put them

[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:59.260]
on separately could we well we have to put them on separately because we're at the pull question

[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:05.300]
is aside from Neil the best all-time South Florida radio personality is or was because

[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:09.400]
the several of these have passed away the big broadcast booth in the sky in other words they're dead

[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.960]
and then my list that I had so far was Rick Shaw Randy Rhodes

[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.920]
Phil Henry are you sure who we used to like a lot?

[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.660]
micronary bill caller Jim Mandage Jim Mandage

[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.200]

uh-Jerry Williams Bill Tanner what footy big Wilson Alice Rantell Steve Kane

[00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:38.240]
George right now I'm adding these other three make sure we get these on there okay I'm assuming

[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:41.940]
that we will I just I just say that because the way things are going lately George Rodriguez

[00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:48.140]
Rick Rally and Suds Coleman individual see because the question is aside from Neil the best

[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:53.240]
all-time South Florida radio personality is or was so you can't put like a uh can we do we want to

[00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:57.040]
put Ron Diaz and Ron Beddington well let's see I was going to ask you about a whole bunch of names

[00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:01.720]
that you know not you know okay well listen that's the idea is to kill a lot of time here we only

[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:06.860]
got three hours anyway before a big one to two hour I'm no wait huh it's the middle of the summertime

[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:11.380]
I'm not gonna in addition to which look at what we got we got Miami on line six now you know who this

[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:20.800]
Miami hello thank you okay now I'm looking at our um hot couples contest and people are going to

[00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:24.340]
say well boy that thing is you're bouncing around but today's only Thursday and we got until

[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:29.040]
Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock correct so those of you who entered and we appreciate all 18

[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.240]
couples we appreciate very very much that you would degrade yourself to the point of like allowing

[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.000]
us to exhibit you but that's great but it has bounced around at either point we've had like I

[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:44.940]
think three or four different in fact look what's happening right now so if you have a lot of

[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:49.480]
friends or if you have somebody out there in the our audience who happens to like you a lot uh

[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.320]
because the rules of the contest just say whoever gets the most votes at the end of a week that's it

[00:30:53.320 --> 00:31:00.740]
right because we can't control what happened anything right we it's just there so if there's

[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:06.620]
somebody out there it's got like a daisy chain going or whatever uh whatever right right right

[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:11.240]
I mean if it sounds helpless that's because we're helpless to control it so let's have fun with it

[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:17.120]
and let them get upset Alexa and Mandy are in first place with 463 coming from the middle of the

[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.920]
pack to like blow into first they're blowing it Maggie and Tom 424 they had a comfortable lead early

[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:28.520]
but boy Maggie and Tom uh I don't know as a matter of fact Aaron and Brandon continue being on

[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:36.440]
their ass they got 399 and today's big move so far Brittany and Greg 335 again coming from

[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.780]
nowhere and it looks to me like they're zooming toward the top Natalie and Adrian who actually

[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:44.860]
moved into first place briefly 321 they ran out of friends or whatever or supporters

[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:50.100]
Rich and Cheryl 113 who have tried before and they're trying it again Adrian and David 11

[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:53.180]
Michelle and Rick 95

[00:31:54.780 --> 00:32:00.400]
Rick Helen Donovan 72 uh Brecht and Danielle 51 they should be doing a little bit better than that

[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.400]
I try to remain very neutral because I don't want to be accused of influencing but they should

[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:08.200]
be doing a little bit better uh Yanet and Peter 33 am I still don't believe I'm saying that right

[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:18.240]
Yanet sure whatever Yanet Silje is that like Cindy Lumet yeah uh Laurie and Mike had got 32 votes

[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:24.200]
Kimberly and Bob 29 uh I don't know if maybe I shouldn't go all the way to the bottom I guess I will

[00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:30.800]
Doris and Kelvin Kevin 17 sorry Kevin uh Eileen and Ben only 14 now they also it seems to me

[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.660]
what's wrong with them what I feel like they just don't have any friends I guess marina bill 13

[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:41.980]
event and Nelson 13 and Maria and Michelle have got only nine you know Michael

[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:48.200]
I beg your pardon Michael okay would you just relax I didn't even get the word out of my

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:52.320]
that's how you say it in French I see we just need look French

[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.700]
Maria and Michael have nine votes only not a 2500 and 44 which that sounds like a very

[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.360]
impressive total after only a couple of days and I bet you like some of those votes are for real

[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:10.520]
yeah maybe maybe now Maria and Michael ought to be doing better than nine votes but the problem is

[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.100]
and I hate to say this Michael but you look a little if you had a silly hat on you know who he'd

[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:21.760]
look just like bill huh oh how many clues do I have to give you if he had a real silly hat on

[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:27.900]
were you drudge packing oh no he looks just a little tad like Miss Fudge no he's not sure

[00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:33.570]
he's a much a metric old a much nicer person and the plus he's straight Michael so anyway

[00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:37.150]
they're in last place at the moment but things are changing dramatically on our right and we got

[00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:42.510]
all the way to the next Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock here's that the poll today now let's see

[00:33:42.510 --> 00:33:48.090]
did we say we're gonna add Ron Diaz and Ron Bennington or not yes we did here's a fact that says

[00:33:49.010 --> 00:33:56.050]
make sure NR knows that yesterday coming out of these 730 to 35 break more referred to him as a

[00:33:56.050 --> 00:34:00.170]
stupid old daughtering fool well that's original that would be like going on here and saying you're

[00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.850]
reading the same two books that that from else father said he was reading the day before and lying

[00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:09.650]
about it not even knowing the name of the second book we're on the mo absolute no world is on your

[00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:15.990]
plus that bogus deal that you coerced with a Greg I mean talk about an asshole talk about forcing

[00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:20.430]
yourself into a place where you know you're not wanted you're reminds me of an awful awful movie

[00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:26.030]
sent of a woman without patino where he shows up at his relative's house for thanksgiving even

[00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:29.870]
though he knows that some of them hate him like poison and don't want him there and creates this

[00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.390]
confrontation and they wish to hell he would die and leave and everything else and but he insists

[00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:39.050]
on being there I see the same apparel with Mohawar david absolutely even though he knows that

[00:34:39.050 --> 00:34:43.070]
everybody wants him out of there in the worst possible way or the best possible way or on a stretcher

[00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:48.870]
he just insisting and so he found that the technical glitz there that grand court that's Greg

[00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:53.150]
again Greg you know improving with one hand and screwing things up with the other hand kind of the

[00:34:53.150 --> 00:34:57.490]
in and the yang the in and the out the up and the down trying to balance out his mistakes nice go

[00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:01.490]
but Greg will be throwing out the birth pitch at the Marley games 30 night anybody care no

[00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:07.410]
thanks by the way Bob for informing me about that daughtering a court and see that's what I call

[00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:11.610]
him all the time so again rather than coming up with original material on his own all he does like

[00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:16.590]
if we ought to call him mode of parrot in fact there's another idea for our website we got

oops

[00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:56.430]
I

[00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:13.750]
when I'd win to learn I

[00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.350]
look that

[00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:21.830]
In this spring, driving home, I was all alone,

[00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:24.710]
thinking someone's playing tricks on me.

[00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:31.770]
But in the rear view mirror, I could see Jesus staring back at me.

[00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:38.670]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of my.

[00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:45.570]
I saw Him on my path of toaster and the sea in my path.

[00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:52.970]
All my friends think of us and the rhythmic bar.

[00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:59.650]
Oh, I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:06.670]
Oh, I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:13.890]
I saw Him on the side of the taht of where the looked at on my path.

[00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:19.570]
I saw Him in the bollies big giddy in the sky,

[00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:21.270]
I saw His mother's car.

[00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:28.270]
Yes, I saw Jesus on the stick of all of my.

[00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:35.130]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:42.210]
I saw Him on my path of toaster and the sea in my path.

[00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:49.530]
All my friends think of us and the rhythmic bar.

[00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:58.030]
Yes, I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:12.170]
Oh, I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:36.890]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:41.650]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:41.650]

[00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:42.150]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.030]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:01.070]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:01.070]

[00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:07.850]
I saw Jesus on the stick of all of.

[00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.350]
My mother is crying and, uh, ripping hair out.

[00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:13.730]
Yes, I'm sure your momma is crying most of the time,

[00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:16.170]
basically because of the terrible things you say about her

[00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.990]
running her right now, let's see this.

[00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:21.830]
Were you intending to fax this to me or to eric again?

[00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:26.010]
Or just to, uh, tall sagte me just to stay ahead of, uh, is this?

[00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:33.630]
Who are you sure Architecturally� bashin honest?

[00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.230]
I don't believe this.

[00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:43.430]
Bill Calder for Mohawar, David for Randy Rhodes for Rick Shaw, three.

[00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:45.290]
George Rodriguez has a pair.

[00:39:46.610 --> 00:39:51.010]
Mike Reneer has got two Rick Raleigh, two Ron Bennington, two Jerry Williams, one Big Wilson,

[00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.850]
one Hank Goldberg, one.

[00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:56.750]
No votes yet for Alice Rantell, Steve Cain, Larry King, Bill Tanner.

[00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:57.390]
What?

[00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.650]
Fuddy or Ron Diaz?

[00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.090]
How do you like that?

[00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:02.990]
The cigar store Indian.

[00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:04.910]
Boy, he was really an asshole, you know what?

[00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.390]
Yeah.

[00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:06.130]
He was.

[00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:07.030]
Man.

[00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:08.450]
Humorless?

[00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:12.690]
Humorless wooden, self-absorbed, piece of turd.

[00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.690]
The only thing that he had gone for him, and I told him that I didn't put him in those terms,

[00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.410]
but he had a voice that sounded like Howard Stern.

[00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:20.510]
He didn't hear of anything else.

[00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.990]
Huh?

[00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:21.730]
How dare you?

[00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:22.690]
You got a lot of nerve-saying.

[00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.230]
Yeah, I just stuck that hand grenade in my mouth and pulled the pin again.

[00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:27.950]
Never seen that.

[00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.250]
The quote Tommy Kramer, who still hasn't done any drugs.

[00:40:31.830 --> 00:40:35.410]
Well, those were the days, those bizarre few months at Paxing, you know what?

[00:40:36.490 --> 00:40:41.850]
Oh, that was so strange that whole period of time makes me want to play that song.

[00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:44.190]
Is it gonna make you want to play that song?

[00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:45.490]
Make you want to hear the song.

[00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.350]
Make you want to hear that song and think of those good old days.

[00:40:48.530 --> 00:40:53.610]
They saw this radio station and the future is in town.

[00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:54.650]
Yes.

[00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:03.610]
You're doing this, huh?

[00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.870]
Nope.

[00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:12.270]
Something I've seen, but it's not like we would know where hair is.

[00:41:12.530 --> 00:41:13.370]
By the way, don't be afraid.

[00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:14.450]
We hate you, molder.

[00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:19.910]
I think that it's a bummer when the Henry's gone.

[00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:20.910]
Okay.

[00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:26.450]
Say goodbye to Aaron, someers say hi to Ron and Ron.

[00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:28.350]
They're gonna work for Paxing.

[00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.670]
And that's a matter of fact.

[00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.950]
They're gonna work for Paxing.

[00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.250]
But he'll need change in his act.

[00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:43.190]
I've said so born again, Christian.

[00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.230]
Boy, God Jesus, he can be.

[00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:52.650]
He wants to change the stations, letters, the WGOT.

[00:41:53.050 --> 00:41:54.750]
Now we'll work for Paxing.

[00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:58.050]
Paxing is a pleasure, new thoughts.

[00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:01.270]
Paxing, the Pax we have gone on, one compaction.

[00:42:01.810 --> 00:42:04.470]
Paxing, Paxing, Paxing, make the sign of the crop.

[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:10.030]
In the label.

[00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:13.590]
10.51 at 5.60 W.D.C.

[00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.490]
I'm thinking of some of these great people that we worked with over there at Paxing.

[00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:17.110]
Briefly.

[00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.490]
Engineer Max.

[00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.190]
We'd like to Shmoos.

[00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.870]
He'd like to eat.

[00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:22.690]
He'd like to cruise.

[00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.250]
He'd like to eat.

[00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:25.570]
He didn't like to work too much, though.

[00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:26.770]
You forgot adultery.

[00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:28.910]
He'd like to adultery and cruise.

[00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.910]
I said cruise.

[00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.490]
Oh, I'm sorry.

[00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.730]
Give it a good word.

[00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:33.470]
I guess you didn't see that movie without Patino.

[00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:34.350]
Yeah, I did, actually.

[00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:35.170]
Neither did I.

[00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.850]
I sure didn't.

[00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:37.250]
I'm glad.

[00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.270]
Oh, in other words, that movie you would go and see with nothing.

[00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:43.190]
I just go and see it.

[00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.630]

[00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:44.250]
Don't do it.

[00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:45.890]
Like I would go and see that.

[00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.250]
Yeah.

[00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:48.590]
Someone put it in the machine and said, hey, here's a good movie.

[00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.650]
You should watch it without telling me what it was about.

[00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:52.170]
Who said that, Pat Robertson?

[00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.690]
I'm a faggot.

[00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.550]
Yeah.

[00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:54.930]
No, no, no, no.

[00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:56.330]
No faggot was said that that was a good movie.

[00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.790]
Trust me.

[00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:57.890]
That's exactly how it went.

[00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.850]
Unless it was like some self-hating faggot.

[00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.130]
Ding, ding, ding.

[00:43:01.490 --> 00:43:02.070]
There you go.

[00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:03.430]
Like I said, Pat Robertson.

[00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.210]
A horrible movie.

[00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.150]
But you won't watch it atown there, Mr. Ripley.

[00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.230]
I will watch it.

[00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:09.910]
I'm just waiting for someone to visit you for free.

[00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:10.430]
Right.

[00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:11.070]
I'm a cheapskate.

[00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:12.350]
Anyway, you're writing on the list here.

[00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:13.110]
Alex Bennett.

[00:43:13.830 --> 00:43:14.190]
Yeah.

[00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.450]
He made it impact.

[00:43:16.610 --> 00:43:18.030]
Which the only line.

[00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:19.710]
How come this thing isn't working out?

[00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.990]
The only line.

[00:43:21.310 --> 00:43:21.910]
Just relax.

[00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:22.410]
Okay.

[00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.110]
I got it in here.

[00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.410]
If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now.

[00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.050]
Take your goddamn teeth in.

[00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:31.210]
That was Alex Bennett throwing a snip with poor Rick and suds, having a nervous breakdown.

[00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:35.110]
And then just like so many others, like Tom, don't like us before him.

[00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:36.030]
We're not putting him on the list.

[00:43:36.590 --> 00:43:42.670]
Just, you know, gotten this is little meada and his wimpy little meada and the high tailed out of town.

[00:43:42.890 --> 00:43:43.470]
Tom, like us.

[00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:44.050]
We forgot him.

[00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:45.430]
I just got through a sandwich.

[00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.570]
We're not putting him on the list.

[00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.230]
We're not putting him on.

[00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.370]
Well, you want to put him on there?

[00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:49.750]
Go ahead.

[00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:50.310]
I don't care.

[00:43:50.430 --> 00:43:50.710]
It's free.

[00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.990]
It's L-E-Y-K-I-S.

[00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:55.050]
Don't include that leather jacket.

[00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:55.610]
Lakers.

[00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:57.290]
Dick Farrell.

[00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:58.510]
Dickie Farco.

[00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:59.470]
Do you think anybody remembers him?

[00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:00.110]
I did.

[00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.170]
I had to work with him.

[00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:02.310]
Stan Major.

[00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:02.890]
Right.

[00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:06.730]
By the way, Stan needs your car for a few days.

[00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:07.990]
George, his car is in the shop.

[00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:09.470]
Really?

[00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.070]
No, you don't, you know this story?

[00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:13.650]
No.

[00:44:13.970 --> 00:44:14.830]
I was up here.

[00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.810]
Now, keeping in mind, this is the guy who said that I was an overpaid talent.

[00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.130]
This is the guy who, when I told him I'd resound, he needed my contract with IODs, slammed the phone down.

[00:44:22.290 --> 00:44:23.030]
I'm here hung up on me.

[00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:25.330]
And I'm up here in Toronto.

[00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:28.410]
Calls the house and tells John that his car is in the shop.

[00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:32.370]
Can you get ahold of me because he needs to borrow one of my Corvettes for four days?

[00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:34.530]
Are you ready for that?

[00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:35.810]
I was there.

[00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:37.450]
Stan Major.

[00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:40.850]
Now, a New Start Radio 610, W-I-O-D.

[00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:44.050]
If you've missed the last show, you missed this.

[00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.250]
Well then, what the hell is your problem?

[00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.130]
Pain is in New York, fella.

[00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.290]
What he was doing is your, I don't want to stay in back.

[00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:51.150]
I just told you that.

[00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.530]
Well then, who do you want?

[00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:53.490]
Who do you want?

[00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:54.410]
You want Alan Burke?

[00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:55.190]
I don't want that.

[00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.650]
I think you want Joe, you're Reynolds?

[00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:57.230]
So what?

[00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.470]
They want the hell do you want in the air?

[00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:00.090]
Silence?

[00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:01.530]
Is that all we have to do?

[00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.850]
What do you give me a name?

[00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.930]
But is that all we have to do?

[00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:04.670]
Who do you want?

[00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:06.070]
Is that all we have to do?

[00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:10.410]
What kind of content do you want during two to six?

[00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.850]
I did.

[00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:13.550]
Here, the next Stan Major show.

[00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:17.930]
This afternoon at two on New Start Radio 610, W-I-O-D.

[00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.930]
And of course, how could we have left off?

[00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:20.950]
I am that him, right?

[00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.690]
Joey Reynolds, right?

[00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.530]
It's for you.

[00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:25.710]
I'm certain that his little group of his little coterie of misfits

[00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:27.490]
still be delighted to vote for Joey on the poll.

[00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:27.650]
Sure.

[00:45:28.070 --> 00:45:29.530]
So your psychic power strike again?

[00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:30.090]
Yes.

[00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.590]
Just last night on the way home from Treasure Island,

[00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:37.530]
Boca-Brion was filling me in on the olden days before I showed up,

[00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.210]
before I came to town, with Stan Major and the set-up calls.

[00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.650]
You mean like the great show that Stan did about what kind of watch you were

[00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:46.450]
and then you tried to move away dark shows?

[00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.630]
Well, I brought up some of those Milky Way dark shows in the end of the video.

[00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:54.670]
But like the whole EJ thing and everything, say I was, you know, around for all of that

[00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:57.590]
with the set-up calls, which I thought really set-up calls, you got to be, uh,

[00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:58.350]
Josh and me.

[00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:00.270]
No, he wasn't Josh and me.

[00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:03.310]
Oh, we don't have that EJ thing in here?

[00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:04.870]
Oh, I know what it's under.

[00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:06.390]
I know what it's under.

[00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:07.090]
Let me file a file.

[00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.650]
Here it is.

[00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.950]
Hello.

[00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:09.790]
There's a lot of money in the cell.

[00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:21.130]
All the advantages, all the things that I've got to do.

[00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:25.350]
You know, the interesting part about this business is no matter who you put on the year,

[00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:29.870]
that particular individual will attract a certain little core.

[00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:34.130]
And in some cases, a very little core, but nevertheless, a core of...

[00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:35.110]
Miss Smith?

[00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.130]
A core of bizarre individuals.

[00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.530]
Miss Smith, whatever you want to call it, a core of groupies,

[00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:44.990]
who are specifically geared to that one person.

[00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:45.610]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:46.510]
Oh, I know.

[00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:52.070]
Like what Stan, it was EJ and DJ and, uh, Paul Harvey Jr.,

[00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:53.430]
I think he invented him, I do believe.

[00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:55.610]
That's what Bokobrine was telling me as a matter of fact,

[00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:56.930]
because that's how it got started.

[00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.130]
It was like, where did we come from?

[00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:00.630]
Of course, we can always blame Bokobrine for what's his name?

[00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:01.330]
They're Chris Baker.

[00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:03.670]
And Cheky Patterson.

[00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:04.870]
Cheky Patterson.

[00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.510]
Why isn't he on there?

[00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:07.550]
Yeah, get Chris Baker on the list.

[00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:08.090]
That's a good one.

[00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.710]
Who's not turned into another right-wing talk host.

[00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:11.170]
How unusual.

[00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.470]
They're flaming right-wing talk host in...

[00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:14.050]
Where would he be?

[00:47:14.050 --> 00:47:16.890]
He was in Omaha, and I was somewhere in Texas, in Bumfork, Texas.

[00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.850]
Where would he be?

[00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.230]
Seca, just goes to Shoya.

[00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.090]
There's a hope for you, George.

[00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:24.770]
In fact, George has got some votes on here.

[00:47:25.350 --> 00:47:28.190]
Aside from Neil, the best all-time South Florida radio personality was,

[00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.670]
Isar was, Phil Henry.

[00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:30.070]
Okay.

[00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:30.750]
21.

[00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:32.810]
I had a feeling.

[00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:34.670]
He's always, every time we do anything similar to this,

[00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.530]
he always does it, although not probably not overwhelming,

[00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:38.170]
because now a lot of people hate him like Poison.

[00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.250]
But at least when he was local in South Florida, IOD,

[00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:43.050]
he was a great.

[00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.970]
Jim Nandage 12, Suds Coolman 8, Randy Road 7, Randy.

[00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.690]
RAH-WAH!

[00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.250]
George Rodriguez 6 tied with Rick Shaw, and now that's really amazing.

[00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:56.870]
Rick Shaw, a legend in the market, been on the year for over 40 years,

[00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.830]
the longest standing, South Florida radio personality,

[00:48:00.090 --> 00:48:03.370]
Ricky Tickey's only got six votes, and George has got six.

[00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.550]
And we were listening to Rick Shaw air checks from 1966 on the way home

[00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:08.790]
from Treasure Island last night.

[00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:09.730]
How do you like that?

[00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:12.730]
I'm got W.A.

[00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:15.170]
My good personal friend Rick Shaw, who loves this show,

[00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:16.690]
whose most famous line was...

[00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:17.090]
It's a lie.

[00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:18.390]
I am not, but not see.

[00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:20.490]
At least not with the capital in Rick, right?

[00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.990]
George Rodriguez 6, Rick Shaw 6, Hank Goldberg 5,

[00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.030]
Ron Bennington 5.

[00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.350]
Oh, how are you, David and 4?

[00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.410]
You better get it up, Mo.

[00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.470]
Mo.

[00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:30.290]
Absolutely.

[00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:35.150]
Uh, Mike Winnery 4, Rick Riley 4, Bill Carter 4, Bill Tanner 3.

[00:48:35.450 --> 00:48:35.750]
What?

[00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:36.990]
Big Wilson 2.

[00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:40.030]
See, now a lot of this is based on time.

[00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:41.050]
You're right.

[00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:41.950]
The time frame.

[00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.330]
In other words, some of these people, uh, who'd help remembers them, you know?

[00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.970]
If you're not an old fart like me, if you're not a dottering old fool like me and Mo.

[00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:52.830]
We are sports radio 5.6.

[00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.430]
UAM.

[00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:02.350]
Merry Christmas from CKW.

[00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:09.610]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.750]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:12.410]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:13.770]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:14.750]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.750]

[00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.750]

[00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:17.110]
And go through the messy f***.

[00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:19.870]
George's going with that head.

[00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:22.270]
Won't still bring back Hitler's butt.

[00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:25.050]
And I sent my douchebag.

[00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:26.870]
Hey, the LeBunner, my skirt.

[00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.530]
Watch out my rosebeef, squirt.

[00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:32.030]
Don't make coffee with the gas.

[00:49:32.810 --> 00:49:34.630]
One of my favorites is a bag.

[00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:37.370]
I would like to recall him too.

[00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:39.670]
If only he was in a few.

[00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:42.310]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:43.470]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.910]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:44.170]
Uh-huh.

[00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:45.150]
He's a big black.

[00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.430]
If there's many, sir, who are?

[00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:50.670]
What would he do to his girl?

[00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:53.690]
Or a rosebeef hanging, oozing past?

[00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:56.410]
Who might have tried to f*** her?

[00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:58.270]
I know that ain't come true.

[00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.710]
So, is that here's what I'll do?

[00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:03.730]
I'll give my Hamilton a good rub.

[00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.850]
My highlight cost takes make me come.

[00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:20.210]
Love it on a two of five sixty.

[00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.970]
Come down there.

[00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:21.590]
Come down in.

[00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:22.290]
1102.

[00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.390]
We got the Mad Dog coming up at the highly popular Mad Dog,

[00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.610]
who's right on Phil Henry's ass by the way in the assurvey.

[00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:29.650]
All right.

[00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:32.090]
Here's the fact that says if you really want to revisit the

[00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.710]
Paxton Days, why don't you ask John Ford to block Georgia's

[00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:35.030]
car again?

[00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:36.110]
I don't know what that means.

[00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:39.750]
When we, uh, there was a big raid involving Chris,

[00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:43.550]
remember Chris Reed and Sam, remember your good buddy Sam

[00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.850]
when we had to go and get our show materials out of there

[00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:46.850]
and they wouldn't let us have it.

[00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.490]
Yeah.

[00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.430]
So we loaded up the van with my cabinet, which is in here now

[00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:52.790]
and all those dats, which is at the core of the DCS.

[00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:54.570]
And a whole bunch of CDs and a whole bunch of other things

[00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.550]
that belong to us.

[00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.950]
Right.

[00:50:56.050 --> 00:50:57.710]
They wouldn't let us leave with it.

[00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:01.070]
And so Pete Bolder told John Ford to block the van

[00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:02.330]
in with his car, which he did.

[00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:04.290]
And then they called the cops.

[00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.770]
And I don't remember any of this.

[00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:08.610]
You weren't in here.

[00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.470]
Yeah.

[00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:12.470]
This was during your seven month hiatus and I came back

[00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.490]
and they came.

[00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:13.830]
You're going to spend a month paying limbo.

[00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:14.310]
I love that.

[00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:14.430]
Right.

[00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:15.150]
Let's try that again.

[00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:15.650]
What are you saying?

[00:51:15.790 --> 00:51:19.250]
A week later I came back and Pete Bolder, who told me

[00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.210]
don't worry, you can just get your stuff when you come back.

[00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:21.770]
Lied.

[00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:25.630]
And wouldn't let us have my stuff, my stuff.

[00:51:25.630 --> 00:51:27.790]
And so we had to raid the building.

[00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.430]
Our good friends let us into the building.

[00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:31.390]
Helped us load the van up.

[00:51:31.650 --> 00:51:33.990]
But then when John Ford arrived on the scene, he blocked the car.

[00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:35.730]
You're just got through telling us this.

[00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:36.070]
Yeah.

[00:51:36.310 --> 00:51:36.950]
Well, there you go.

[00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.410]
Didn't he just tell us this, Bean or Boer, am I dreaming?

[00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:41.110]
Yeah, he did.

[00:51:41.570 --> 00:51:43.570]
What are you repeating the whole story again?

[00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:46.290]
Let's hope it's effective to make sure that you got it the first time.

[00:51:46.590 --> 00:51:47.010]
Oh, I see.

[00:51:47.130 --> 00:51:48.510]
So what was the upshot of the story?

[00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:49.730]
We got away with our stuff.

[00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:53.670]
Pete Bolder kept a box of vests of dats.

[00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.550]
And still has them, I guess.

[00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:56.230]
Yeah.

[00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:57.850]
What do you know we can do with me?

[00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:58.870]
We can stick them up his hand.

[00:51:59.050 --> 00:51:59.750]
Get out of here.

[00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:00.170]
God.

[00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:02.690]
Be better than most of the crap he's putting on here.

[00:52:02.970 --> 00:52:06.790]
Here's the fact that it says kudos for scolding Furella on your cross over this morning.

[00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:09.770]
It's sickening to hear the, oh yeah, listen, I love Furella.

[00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:11.410]
I'm not doing any disclaimers.

[00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:12.950]
I keep saying that because it's true, but.

[00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:19.050]
But it says it's sickening to hear the leeches in this town call and beg for $4 tickets

[00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.090]
during Furelles' giveaways.

[00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:22.830]
I've listened to you bitch about that aspect of this town for a while,

[00:52:22.830 --> 00:52:24.350]
especially the women who call and beg.

[00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:26.890]
And as usual, you have your finger running in the pulse too.

[00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.750]
I'll keep listening for similar words of wisdom since this chronic factor.

[00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:31.070]
You are right on top of it, man.

[00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.890]
It sucks.

[00:52:32.970 --> 00:52:34.430]
I want to hear him doing this thing.

[00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:35.510]
I'm like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

[00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:36.190]
I want to hear that.

[00:52:36.350 --> 00:52:36.690]
I don't want to hear.

[00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:38.210]
Okay, we got, we need six.

[00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:38.910]
We got you covered.

[00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:39.490]
We got, okay.

[00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:40.770]
Denise, you need ten.

[00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:41.350]
We got you covered.

[00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:42.190]
What is that?

[00:52:42.930 --> 00:52:43.650]
What is that?

[00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:46.850]
Let's give away $50,000 in tickets.

[00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:47.410]
What do you say?

[00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:47.790]
Okay.

[00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:50.030]
Let's give $200,000 in tickets.

[00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.930]
That'll be a hot seller.

[00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:54.850]
I mean, you give me a chance to fill up a couple of sections,

[00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:56.050]
given out tickets for free.

[00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:57.070]
What is that proof?

[00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:59.270]
I mean, you talk about beating a dead horse,

[00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:00.970]
even C. Biscuit ain't dead dead.

[00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:03.530]
It is just a lost cause.

[00:53:03.790 --> 00:53:05.970]
And, well, you know, maybe they're going to get hot, maybe darn out,

[00:53:06.110 --> 00:53:07.790]
and they make the playoffs.

[00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.510]
I have never in my life encountered anything, anything,

[00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.090]
like the whole Marlon experience,

[00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.170]
where they're just trying to flagulate and just beaded into the ground.

[00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:23.110]
You can't force people to care about something that they don't.

[00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:25.350]
In fact, there was an article yesterday, and one of the papers here,

[00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:28.430]
about the interest in Major League Baseball is way down.

[00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.790]
And Bud Seedig is doing his best degree of bet minimization.

[00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:32.230]
Oh, everything is just fine.

[00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:32.750]
No problem.

[00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:33.790]
You know, we don't have no problems.

[00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:36.890]
Interest is way, way down.

[00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:39.830]
The ratings for the All Star Game last night, way, way down.

[00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.470]
Or whatever it held later was.

[00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:43.210]
A Tuesday night.

[00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:45.830]
So, what the hell are they kidding?

[00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.790]
And, like we're going to devote the whole goddamn radio station

[00:53:48.790 --> 00:53:51.130]
during the sports hours to the Marlins and Marlin tickets,

[00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:52.350]
and who's throwing off the first pitch,

[00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:53.970]
and Greg Reed is throwing the first pitch.

[00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:55.750]
Greg Reed, maybe ought to get the microphone

[00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:58.250]
and make an announcement there in the stadium on Saturday night,

[00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:01.410]
and admit that he made a bad mistake there,

[00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:04.370]
which allowed mode of snooker room in.

[00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:04.990]
Nice going, Mo.

[00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:05.510]
Absolutely.

[00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:09.710]
I'm almost, and again, I underline the almost part,

[00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.610]
almost on most side on that, you know what?

[00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.030]
You follow what I'm saying?

[00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.630]
I understand.

[00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.530]
They change, they had a right in the contract,

[00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:19.810]
and they heard him do six to nine,

[00:54:20.030 --> 00:54:21.750]
and then they shove his time slot back,

[00:54:21.830 --> 00:54:22.550]
which is great with me.

[00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:24.330]
I like to see him on like from three to four in the morning,

[00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:27.710]
kind of like a guest on the Jo and Mark show.

[00:54:27.850 --> 00:54:28.490]
That's the most.

[00:54:29.790 --> 00:54:31.690]
And then they think they can just, you know, and that's it.

[00:54:32.190 --> 00:54:34.250]
And when you're dealing with somebody as devious and dangerous

[00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.490]
and conniving as he is, you don't pull crap like that,

[00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:38.690]
because then you wind up paying for it.

[00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:40.330]
That's why you have a right about it in your newspaper,

[00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:42.850]
because Greg is trying to keep it a secret,

[00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:44.950]
which is especially why I keep talking about it every time

[00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:47.570]
that I'm on, which you ought to be glad it's the summer schedule.

[00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.570]
How about Alan Courtney?

[00:54:49.570 --> 00:54:51.650]
It says, of course, he was on for a long time.

[00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:52.650]
About 30, man.

[00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:53.450]
A million years.

[00:54:54.830 --> 00:54:55.030]
Yeah.

[00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:57.530]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.590]
Ah.

[00:54:59.310 --> 00:55:00.290]
This is excellent.

[00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.630]
This fact, you just sent me with a phony signature on it,

[00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.170]
but it's cute.

[00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.690]
It says, hey, Neal, what about Sunny Fox?

[00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:07.930]
And it's signed Ron Hershey.

[00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:08.950]
Hi, this is Sunny Fox.

[00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:11.130]
I listen to you, Rogers, because I could hear the word asshole.

[00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:11.570]
Oh, yeah.

[00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:13.830]
I had those glorious days when we had the Ron Hershey highway.

[00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.330]
And what did he call that thing where he used to do those phony

[00:55:17.330 --> 00:55:18.330]
corny, awful interviews?

[00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:19.590]
Oh, my God.

[00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:20.570]
I wouldn't have.

[00:55:21.010 --> 00:55:23.890]
Oh, and Clarence was sitting in there sucking Ron Hershey's ass.

[00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:25.930]
Well, he got some good practice for the beast, I guess.

[00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:27.010]
Oh.

[00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:30.630]
Here's one that says, and I see this is not right.

[00:55:30.770 --> 00:55:32.590]
His name wasn't Gene Michael McCay.

[00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:34.870]
It was the, it was an initial G Michael McCay.

[00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:35.570]
Right.

[00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:38.390]
It says, creative innovator of JJ Moose,

[00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:41.270]
that Elvis Polo ponies for the poor and the dysfunctional father.

[00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.470]
Okay, G Michael McCay.

[00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:43.090]
Got him on there.

[00:55:43.170 --> 00:55:43.430]
We got it.

[00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:43.630]
Good.

[00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.410]
Phil, hangry, walk it away with it so far.

[00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.110]
34, mandates 19, suds, clomot 11,

[00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:52.730]
micrinary, nine, George Rodriguez nine.

[00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:55.390]
I'll get out of here with all due respect to George.

[00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.590]
Read the question again.

[00:55:57.630 --> 00:56:00.870]
Okay, aside from Neal, the best all time softwater radio personality

[00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:04.470]
user was George Rodriguez is tied with micrinary with nine votes.

[00:56:04.770 --> 00:56:05.970]
I mean, come on, folks.

[00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:07.390]
Are we on the air?

[00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:08.090]
Is this a joke?

[00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:08.850]
Squirt, Squirt.

[00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:10.310]
I don't see any calls on that board.

[00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:12.510]
I don't see any reviews on a beautiful mind.

[00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:14.070]
People call him and say, oh, you're right.

[00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.150]
It was a great movie.

[00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:17.830]
In fact, that's the reason I almost didn't watch it.

[00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:18.830]
It was just you two guys.

[00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:19.870]
Right.

[00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.270]
And that was the end of that.

[00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:23.710]
Also, no more names coming in for a list.

[00:56:23.790 --> 00:56:25.210]
I think we got most of them so far.

[00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:27.830]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:29.650]
I'll do screen list the rest of the two hours.

[00:56:29.890 --> 00:56:30.790]
Don't be answering no phones.

[00:56:30.850 --> 00:56:32.570]
Okay, you got a lot of very important stuff in there to do.

[00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:32.950]
I love you.

[00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:34.370]
Take a defense team.

[00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:36.010]
You got to take care of those bedtime stories.

[00:56:36.550 --> 00:56:38.030]
You got to get ready for your defense

[00:56:38.030 --> 00:56:40.670]
that you're going to mount in your 17 cases year coming up.

[00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:46.270]
Under a lot of stress, that's what happens when your life is a piece of crap.

[00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:50.670]
When you can't get your life in order to affect that, we're going to stick you right in there with what's his name?

[00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:52.770]
Old Russell from Santa Monica.

[00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:54.230]
Russell Crowe.

[00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:55.830]
Russell Crowe.

[00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:58.250]
And that's another thing that really isn't disturbing to me.

[00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.370]
So maybe he is an asshole, okay?

[00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:01.730]
Yes.

[00:57:02.290 --> 00:57:03.270]
That's what everybody says.

[00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:03.570]
Yes.

[00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:05.930]
But his acting in that movie was so sensational.

[00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:06.310]
Right.

[00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:06.750]
He's a good actor.

[00:57:06.750 --> 00:57:08.290]
Didn't he win an Academy Award for that?

[00:57:08.590 --> 00:57:08.730]
Yep.

[00:57:09.450 --> 00:57:11.350]
Did he or just Jennifer Connolly?

[00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:12.290]
No, he won't.

[00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:13.050]
I think he won something.

[00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.090]
I could go get the disc in the other room and look on it, but I'm not going to.

[00:57:16.090 --> 00:57:16.830]
I'll do it during the break.

[00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:19.090]
And she was great in the movie.

[00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.630]
Although he was.

[00:57:19.770 --> 00:57:20.990]
I mean, you can't compare it.

[00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:22.130]
No, he does a good act.

[00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:23.950]
When he showed up in the movie, I thought he was all about him.

[00:57:24.310 --> 00:57:24.450]
Right.

[00:57:25.050 --> 00:57:25.750]
It was amazing.

[00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:27.670]
And she was great.

[00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:28.410]
She was very good.

[00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:29.130]
It was fantastic.

[00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:31.550]
But so he's an asshole.

[00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:33.770]
I'm not looking to go to dinner with him.

[00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:34.250]
Okay.

[00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.470]
I'm not looking to socialize with him.

[00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.910]
I'm looking at his work, his art, his performance.

[00:57:40.450 --> 00:57:42.270]
All this other crap is so extraneous.

[00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.410]
It bugs their hell out of me.

[00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:46.610]
All this personal garbage, you know.

[00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:48.930]
I mean, look at some of the people we work with.

[00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.030]
Like Mo, he's an asshole.

[00:57:50.290 --> 00:57:50.650]
Absolutely.

[00:57:51.110 --> 00:57:54.610]
But look at what a great show he might be doing someday.

[00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:58.490]
Look at a great show.

[00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:00.410]
He doesn't have the Marlon game at the dolphin games.

[00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:01.850]
The only problem being.

[00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:05.190]
I mean, when you're doing a job like he is on the games and somebody that owns a team,

[00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.570]
hates you.

[00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:09.350]
When I think of.

[00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:13.250]
And I'm not just making that up.

[00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:14.910]
I got that and very, very good authority.

[00:58:14.970 --> 00:58:17.050]
Somebody I respect and trust very much.

[00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:18.470]
Here's a question.

[00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:21.870]
It says, did you read the first paragraph of the AP story and the murder and bloodshed at the market?

[00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:28.470]
Authorities were investigating why the 86 year old man's car plowed through a crowded farmer's market,

[00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:30.030]
killing nine and drinking up to 45 others.

[00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:33.090]
Whether the driver was competent to be behind the wheel in the first place.

[00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:38.510]
It says under what guidelines do you find an 86 year old man driving through three blocks of people competent?

[00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:40.450]
It must be the US intelligence doing the investigation.

[00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:41.350]
It's a matter of fact.

[00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:44.150]
They thought he had that uranium from Niger.

[00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:45.190]
Yeah.

[00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:47.810]
They thought he was the guy that was carrying it in the trunk of his car.

[00:58:47.810 --> 00:58:52.250]
Which is why they put him on a high chase and he like veered off the road right under that market.

[00:58:52.930 --> 00:58:54.030]
Well, that was a weapon of mass destruction.

[00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:54.750]
Poor Russell.

[00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:57.690]
Audio used to the Queen of Salsa.

[00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:59.010]
You've been interrupting me so much.

[00:58:59.090 --> 00:59:01.790]
I haven't had time to really do a pay her or do my best.

[00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:06.590]
One of your very favorite Celia Cruz, the grand dom of Cuban music, the woman who's unmistakable voice,

[00:59:06.590 --> 00:59:09.290]
resonated with the rhythm music rhythm rich.

[00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:10.350]
Babaloo.

[00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.030]
Babaloo.

[00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.630]
That wasn't her.

[00:59:11.830 --> 00:59:12.510]
It was unmistakable.

[00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:12.850]
All right.

[00:59:13.290 --> 00:59:17.750]
Died Wednesday after a seven month battle with brain cancer in Georgia is pretty pleased about it.

[00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:20.310]
Cruz died at five p.m. at her home in Fort Lee, New Jersey.

[00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:23.250]
She was 77 or husband said or 78 according to mostographers.

[00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:25.090]
What's the year or two when you get to be that old?

[00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:28.550]
The Cubans on this side of the Florida straights her death and keep in mind.

[00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:31.490]
This isn't a herald again, waxing eloquent about one of those people.

[00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:36.570]
The Cubans on this side of the Florida straights her death is much more than the silencing of one of their home men.

[00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:37.810]
Greatest musical figures.

[00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:42.430]
Celia was the very embodiment of a fabled nostalgia, a nostalgia-hued Cuba,

[00:59:42.930 --> 00:59:48.610]
an icon of nine inch heels and sky-high wigs whose heart always beat to the sway of those long lost palm trees.

[00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.570]
What does that mean long lost palm tree? Where did they go?

[00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:53.870]
I don't know. I know where they are.

[00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:54.810]
Her can't get them.

[00:59:55.330 --> 00:59:55.450]
Baby.

[00:59:56.050 --> 01:00:02.370]
Her death represents the shattered hopes of every abuelo and abuelo who pray they'd live long enough to see the end of an El Castro.

[01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:03.990]
It was Cubans.

[01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:04.570]
It was Cubans.

[01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:12.850]
Oh, and then this article goes on about the exiles this and the pain of losing their hog.

[01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:15.010]
What does this have to do with the price of rice, huh?

[01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.190]
What does this have to do with text, Max?

[01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:18.110]
Nothing.

[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:19.910]
What does it have to do with my life?

[01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.350]
I have no idea who she was.

[01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:27.970]
There will never be another Celia Cruz, a good friend Israel Kachow Lopez, credited with creating a mambo.

[01:00:28.130 --> 01:00:29.630]
Oh, I knew I didn't like her for some reason.

[01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:33.630]
Nobody has her grace, her style, her voice like Benny Morey.

[01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:35.390]
She was born to be a legend.

[01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:36.870]
Oh, Benny Morey.

[01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:37.690]
No, that is no.

[01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:38.510]
I don't need her.

[01:00:40.610 --> 01:00:45.630]
Kachow had known Celia since he first started going with her family of neighborhood dances featuring his orchestra at age 14.

[01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:49.010]
She was just a girl who with no thought of being her performer, but she loved the music.

[01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.590]
It was always in her, he said.

[01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.470]
I think her part was always in her.

[01:00:52.810 --> 01:00:53.130]
Kachow?

[01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:56.670]
And it goes on pages and pages and pages and pay.

[01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:57.530]
Oh, my God.

[01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:58.810]
I must have missed something important here.

[01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.450]
Celia Cruz, muy importante.

[01:01:00.850 --> 01:01:01.730]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:03.170]
I'm sure we'll get a couple of calls on that.

[01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:04.090]
What do you think?

[01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.990]
Asuka.

[01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:06.210]
There it is.

[01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.850]
There's the call.

[01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:13.670]
1113 at 560 WQM.

[01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.770]
Hey, if your hair is on the decline, if it's on a way out, maybe it's already out.

[01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:18.870]
Maybe there's not much left there.

[01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:20.810]
Maybe like Wayne, you got a big shiny bald spot.

[01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:22.930]
In his case, he can't afford to do it.

[01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:25.130]
Well, he can look like whatever the hell he wants because he's a billionaire.

[01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:26.610]
If you don't like it, shove it.

[01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:27.970]
But most of you guys are there.

[01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.030]
If you want to look good, you want to look your best.

[01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.570]
Having a full head of hair is an important component to that.

[01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:35.690]
And that's why you ought to become my good friend Charles Alfieri because he's been designing

[01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:39.310]

This is Charlie's natural hairline system, the best in the business.

[01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:57.190]
And it looks just like the hair is going out of your head instead of a farm animal diet on your hair.

Where your hair used to be.

[01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:02.130]

Or check them on the web at CharlesAlphiore.com.

[01:02:28.190 --> 01:02:31.870]
I am law. This is which we need to find safety.

[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.390]
Q-A-M.

[01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.610]
The M-W.

[01:02:38.270 --> 01:02:42.270]
First, there was the club. They had a theft device that lost to the steering wheel of your car.

[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:46.310]
Then there was the cap. They had a theft device that prevents thieves from picking your airbags.

[01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:50.590]
Now there's the ultimate instinct of the art of protection, introducing the crap.

[01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:56.050]
2.5 pounds of steaming human extra mint that plops neatly into the front seat of all domestic and most foreign vehicles.

[01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:59.030]
Properly installed, the crap deters even the whole determined thief.

[01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:04.470]
Hey, nice car. They left a door unlocked. Let's take this for a little spin.

[01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:09.490]
Oh my God, someone took a dump on the front seat. That is disgusting.

[01:03:10.170 --> 01:03:11.470]
I'm moving on to the next car.

[01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:17.250]
One roof of the crap. And thieves will move on to one other car that doesn't have a steaming pile of human extra mint on the front seat.

[01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:19.970]
We guarantee it. Order the crap. We are car today.

[01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:22.550]
And anyone who tries to steal your car will be in deep.

[01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:23.870]
Well, you know.

[01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:25.930]
Yeah, we know all right. It's our speciality.

[01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:26.490]
Crap.

[01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:30.730]
1119 at 560 bots tell you we have really blown it here today.

[01:03:30.850 --> 01:03:34.270]
How could we do the first almost an hour this pull not have Scott Forella on there?

[01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.310]
What are we thinking about?

[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.390]
Shocked and dismayed. I don't know.

[01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:37.250]
What is wrong with us?

[01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:39.810]
I'm thinking about selling your cruise how crushed I am at her passing.

[01:03:40.310 --> 01:03:43.290]
He's driving home on a way up the Hershey highway to the Bokka and he's here.

[01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.770]
And we're shining him here. Believe me, it's not by intent.

[01:03:45.850 --> 01:03:50.190]
Although we do wish you quit that Marlon giveaway crap. But nevertheless, Scott Forella, he's going to get a lot of votes.

[01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:52.530]
In fact, he may catch up to fill and even pass him. What do you think?

[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.090]
Are you sure?

[01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:54.450]
I don't know. We'll see.

[01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:57.650]
Here's one. How could we forget her?

[01:03:58.110 --> 01:03:58.430]
Right.

[01:04:00.010 --> 01:04:03.590]
She may be gone, but her laughter lives on.

[01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:05.690]
She's already on their work trying to work a little bit ahead.

[01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.990]
The babbling brook Daniels. She's already on. She's still on the air somewhere or not.

[01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.110]
We can only pray not. How you doing brook?

[01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:17.090]
Raining roads want to be. How about jazz McKay?

[01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:17.650]
Hey.

[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:19.590]
Yes, McKay.

[01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:21.210]
Let's get jazz McKay on there.

[01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:21.990]
He will go about.

[01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:23.110]
How about?

[01:04:23.310 --> 01:04:24.290]
Let me give you a little clue.

[01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:26.570]
Holy cow.

[01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:30.210]
And I don't mean Harry Curie. How about Aaron Summers, right?

[01:04:30.790 --> 01:04:31.630]
Boy, we're slipping.

[01:04:32.130 --> 01:04:33.530]
How about Chuck Meyer?

[01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:36.070]
A lot of work put into that show.

[01:04:36.070 --> 01:04:38.310]
See the audience ain't helping us out with this. So screw them.

[01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:40.410]
I mean, if anybody knows who's been on here, I know.

[01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.430]
And I might even remember a few of the names, even though I'm a dovering old fool.

[01:04:47.170 --> 01:04:50.170]
Here's one. Oh, this one said the one that said babbling brook.

[01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:53.950]
It says signed award-winning news journalist William Millford the turd.

[01:04:55.390 --> 01:04:56.150]
You turd.

[01:04:56.410 --> 01:05:00.310]
Oh, that's a panic. Yeah, we sure had some real interesting people there during those

[01:05:00.310 --> 01:05:01.890]
Paxing days. Wow.

[01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.350]
Woo! More on.

[01:05:05.890 --> 01:05:08.090]
And Tom Hopkins. Well, time Hopkins, wasn't he?

[01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:09.550]
He did radio first night shows.

[01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:10.750]
Huh? No.

[01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:12.090]
How about the news guy?

[01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.870]
We're not putting news people on here.

[01:05:14.070 --> 01:05:14.450]
Meig Green.

[01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:16.530]
Meig Green.

[01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:16.870]
Yeah.

[01:05:16.990 --> 01:05:19.010]
The light you're going to want to put the plant guy in there too.

[01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:21.910]
We're talking about people that like had to show more than once every six months.

[01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:22.530]
You know, okay.

[01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:24.670]
A few more shows then.

[01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.590]
About third man.

[01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:26.270]
And she did.

[01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:32.130]
Phil Henry 48 aside from Neil the best all time software or radio personality is or was.

[01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.270]
Phil Henry 48.

[01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:34.130]
He made it 24.

[01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.230]
Rick Shaw 14.

[01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:36.810]
George Rodriguez 14.

[01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:40.570]
Now, even you were begging me like that.

[01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.670]
I mean, what do you mean stand begging you?

[01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:46.630]
You've got 14 votes?

[01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:47.530]
Why not?

[01:05:49.190 --> 01:05:50.010]
Why not?

[01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.870]
Why not?

[01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:53.710]
Is he got a serious look on his face when he says that being a boy?

[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:55.330]
He's a dead serious.

[01:05:55.770 --> 01:05:59.550]
He's looking at me with a hurt face, with a bad eyes, with a boy.

[01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:00.750]
Let me, let me, let me.

[01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.710]
Now, keep in mind, okay, that a lot of these, oh, I don't really like that.

[01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:04.710]
You know who he left off?

[01:06:04.830 --> 01:06:04.930]
Who?

[01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:05.810]
Alan Burke.

[01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:08.250]
That's Mr.

[01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:13.610]
The Dean is rolling in his grave hearing the fact that you got 14 votes and we didn't even remember to put him on her.

[01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:16.130]
Suds Coleman is probably really pissed off.

[01:06:16.290 --> 01:06:17.190]
I voted for Suds.

[01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:18.450]
That you got 14.

[01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:19.310]
He's got 13.

[01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:19.870]
Damn it.

[01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:20.530]
I'll fight out.

[01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:21.210]
I'm not too happy about it.

[01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:21.710]
Damn it.

[01:06:22.330 --> 01:06:23.590]
Although, hopefully he'll be in tomorrow.

[01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:26.550]
How does it make him and Rick feel that you got 14 when you're beating him out?

[01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:28.390]
Well, that makes us feel like duty.

[01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.850]
Right.

[01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:29.570]
I don't blame you.

[01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.390]
Anyway, Suds got 13.

[01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:32.710]
Randy Rose got 13.

[01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:33.030]
What?

[01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:35.610]
Mike Reiner, 11.

[01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:36.690]
Bill Calder, 9.

[01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:37.290]
Rest in peace.

[01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:38.430]
Both of them.

[01:06:39.130 --> 01:06:40.170]
Rick Riley, 7.

[01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.970]
Rest in.

[01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:42.670]
Hank Goldberg, 7.

[01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:43.030]
The Humber.

[01:06:43.410 --> 01:06:44.150]
Ron Venington, 6.

[01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:45.230]
Mohawar, David, 5.

[01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:46.730]
That must be the humor vote.

[01:06:47.490 --> 01:06:49.930]
Bill Tanner IV, Alice Randthell, 3.

[01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:51.650]
Big Wilson II, Jerry Williams II.

[01:06:51.990 --> 01:06:53.450]
Jerry Williams only has two votes.

[01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.530]
I voted for Jerry.

[01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:57.430]
Anyway, Jerry Williams only has two votes.

[01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:02.710]
Well, again, like I said, all those people who used to have a WNWS, they're all dead now.

[01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:06.490]
Big Wilson II, Tom Likus II, I totally need to be on there.

[01:07:06.810 --> 01:07:07.630]
Scott Farrows got one.

[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:08.430]
He just went up on there.

[01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.610]
Steve came one, 41.

[01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:11.010]
Stan Major one.

[01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:12.290]
Alice Bennett one.

[01:07:12.690 --> 01:07:13.450]
No votes yet.

[01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.910]
None.

[01:07:14.570 --> 01:07:14.910]
Zero.

[01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.770]
That's bad.

[01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.450]
When you've got no votes run, the Azlery King, Joey Reynolds, Alan Courtney, G Michael

[01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:24.890]
McKay, Brooke Daniels, and Chris Baker, and Jazz McKay and Aaron Somers.

[01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:27.030]
They just both went up there out of 200 votes to have none.

[01:07:27.290 --> 01:07:28.370]
Wouldn't you be a little bit embarrassed?

[01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:30.030]
Well, that they were here.

[01:07:30.350 --> 01:07:32.050]
And aren't you embarrassed that you have 14 votes?

[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.590]
I am.

[01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:34.150]
No, now it's 15 votes.

[01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:35.590]
Are you dealing with that thing?

[01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:38.390]
Is he doing multiple votes, being a boy?

[01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:40.170]
He's trying to get me to.

[01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:43.150]
Yeah.

[01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:45.790]
He's probably sending emails around the building.

[01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:46.390]
About for me.

[01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:46.990]
About for me.

[01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:48.170]
What difference does it make?

[01:07:48.290 --> 01:07:49.350]
How many votes you get on there?

[01:07:50.090 --> 01:07:50.370]
Exactly.

[01:07:50.910 --> 01:07:57.450]
I think people were so disappointed that they were so impressed with George after they heard

[01:07:57.450 --> 01:07:59.850]
me on for about five minutes on that Friday.

[01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:01.190]
Yeah, that must be it.

[01:08:01.310 --> 01:08:02.870]
You notice we didn't put Benavory on there?

[01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:03.310]
Oh, yeah.

[01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:03.890]
Uh-huh.

[01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:04.270]
No.

[01:08:06.110 --> 01:08:06.730]
Great wording.

[01:08:07.530 --> 01:08:08.530]
Now, I was thinking this.

[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.690]
Well, do you think they'll go forward?

[01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:12.690]
I mean, they went for putting Moe back on there and rewriting this contract on the

[01:08:12.690 --> 01:08:13.290]
throttle lawsuit.

[01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:15.890]
I think what I'm going to do is like make them an offer they shouldn't refuse.

[01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:19.650]
And that is they can continue after at my six, three and a half years or sooner, much

[01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:19.930]
sooner.

[01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:22.230]
Uh, the Carlton E. Aradjo Show.

[01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:28.970]
And what I'll do is I'll let them use my voice in my name and I'll do some spots.

[01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:30.410]
What are you laughing about?

[01:08:30.610 --> 01:08:31.570]
No, I'm thinking about this.

[01:08:31.670 --> 01:08:32.550]
You'll do the show.

[01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:33.070]
Mm-hmm.

[01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:35.190]
And you get them all like, uh, be like a phantom.

[01:08:35.190 --> 01:08:37.270]
You know, like Jikka said, I'll do like Colin is the mood.

[01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.770]
You know, I'll sit around here at the board once in a while, open a pot.

[01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:40.950]
I don't know.

[01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:44.630]
I mean, let me silence, uh, but they'll still call them E. Aradjo Show.

[01:08:44.690 --> 01:08:46.450]
Still get a decent still probably have the highest number.

[01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.510]
See, this is one thing as bad as Georgia's and he is awful on the air.

[01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:53.970]
But when he's on the summer time, he still beats the rest of the station.

[01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:55.770]
He beats those sports shows not even close.

[01:08:55.770 --> 01:08:57.330]
Oh, you don't want to say that inside this.

[01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:59.130]
Well, I don't give a crap with the ram or not.

[01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:00.190]
It's the freaking truth.

[01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:02.550]
Still has the highest numbers on the station.

[01:09:03.530 --> 01:09:04.630]
So what does that tell you?

[01:09:04.670 --> 01:09:07.670]
It tells you either the other shows that sports stuff is his boring is dog crap.

[01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:09.630]
And what's with this for all trying to back down today?

[01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:10.290]
Do you hear that?

[01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:12.390]
Well, I was only there two or three days.

[01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:13.130]
That's full crap.

[01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:14.630]
When did we start going back 10 to two?

[01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:14.930]
What was that?

[01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:15.390]
It was a June.

[01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:16.770]
He was on in May.

[01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:18.970]
He was while his, uh, he showed up in May.

[01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.950]
I don't know when the whole more.

[01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:22.010]
No, but when when did we start this new lineup?

[01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:24.330]
I give up.

[01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:26.050]
Well, let's let's find out.

[01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.890]
Let's have somebody in the building.

[01:09:26.890 --> 01:09:27.330]
Let us know.

[01:09:27.370 --> 01:09:31.350]
I'm sure it was like by the first of June because that was the idea that we'd have the whole month of June.

[01:09:31.930 --> 01:09:34.130]
To swoon and crew and spoon.

[01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:37.110]
And sing a happy tune when the numbers came out.

[01:09:37.110 --> 01:09:38.570]
Can I grant you the logs?

[01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:39.350]
Huh?

[01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:41.070]
Carlos can dig through the logs.

[01:09:41.250 --> 01:09:42.010]
No, I don't want to dig.

[01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.470]
Why can't Duff come running in there?

[01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:45.690]
He's probably practicing his karaoke for the Animal Coast.

[01:09:46.210 --> 01:09:47.590]
Come in there and give us some information.

[01:09:47.890 --> 01:09:50.010]
Duff or Clarence is something that knows when did we start?

[01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:54.350]
The new form had to go back to 10 to two and for Elle from 8 to 10 and stick in Moana,

[01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:55.870]
which she was a violation of his contract.

[01:09:56.330 --> 01:09:57.870]
Stick him in there between 5 and 8 in the morning.

[01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.870]
Absolutely.

[01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.810]
We'll find out.

[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:01.890]
Or maybe they're holding their meat again.

[01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.830]
You think that's possible?

[01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:06.830]
Clarence is probably under a lot of pressure because he's got a fill in for a guilty.

[01:10:06.830 --> 01:10:07.210]
Let's see.

[01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:09.370]
What is what's the story with that?

[01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:10.570]
Well, that's right.

[01:10:10.650 --> 01:10:11.990]
This week he's filling in for the beast.

[01:10:13.570 --> 01:10:17.350]
Next week, I see he fills in an Anokit the schedule.

[01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:18.890]
He fills filling in for somebody else here.

[01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:20.810]
Hey, he fills in for a guilty next week.

[01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:22.010]
He's all over the goddamn place.

[01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:23.370]
He's kind of like our swingman.

[01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.970]
He's swinging it.

[01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:26.210]
And the audience to be very pleased.

[01:10:26.370 --> 01:10:29.550]
The Clarence, Josh Dero is going out with a real living and breathing girl,

[01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:30.770]
according to Forreal tonight.

[01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:36.110]
And we're going to want a blow by blow, a lick by lick, a snip by snip.

[01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:37.930]
Yeah, that's right.

[01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:39.070]
And we'll put him on our website.

[01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:41.470]
Fill 59.

[01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:42.730]
Jim Manditz, 27.

[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:44.370]
George Rodriguez, 18.

[01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:45.650]
Now that's got to be a crank vote.

[01:10:45.810 --> 01:10:45.990]
Sure.

[01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:47.110]
Randy Road, 16.

[01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:47.650]
Rick Shaw.

[01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:48.730]
Can you imagine Rick Shaw?

[01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:50.070]
He's probably twisting that cap now.

[01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.970]
He's so pissed off of you.

[01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:51.810]
He's already rich.

[01:10:51.970 --> 01:10:52.490]
What does he care?

[01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:53.110]
14.

[01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.730]
He ain't rich.

[01:10:53.870 --> 01:10:55.510]
You think if he was rich, he'd still be working.

[01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:57.110]
You think he's in there because he loves the business?

[01:10:57.430 --> 01:10:57.650]
Yeah.

[01:10:58.070 --> 01:10:58.790]
You out of your mind?

[01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:00.730]
I hope he calls in.

[01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:04.850]
I hope he calls in and says, you know, and tells you what we're really all about.

[01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:08.770]
Just because he guys have been on here for 40 years, you think that that means that he's rich?

[01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:09.390]
He ought to be.

[01:11:09.730 --> 01:11:10.750]
I know what he's going to say to you.

[01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:11.330]
Let me trust you.

[01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:11.650]
Yeah.

[01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:13.290]
Rich my ass.

[01:11:15.850 --> 01:11:16.630]
Well, I'm telling you.

[01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:17.870]
How am I taking a call or two here?

[01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:18.230]
I don't know.

[01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:20.610]
I got a lot of stuff to do here.

[01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:21.930]
Got some very important stories.

[01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:24.310]
Women promiscuous with the facts of their sex lives.

[01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:28.850]
And basically this story, which I thought was very interesting, that women lie.

[01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.590]
They deny having sex as often as they really do.

[01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:32.250]
Oh, no kidding.

[01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:33.130]
Right.

[01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:36.870]
They assume the men were lying, exaggerating the number of the partners.

[01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:39.010]
But the new study suggests it's the women who lie.

[01:11:39.070 --> 01:11:39.590]
We'll get to that.

[01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:44.250]
Drugs from Canada, Spark, US, ROW, where they started the pharmaceutical company,

[01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.290]
being as clever as they are.

[01:11:45.590 --> 01:11:48.630]
They've come up with a new, full-new organization, a front group calling itself,

[01:11:48.850 --> 01:11:52.490]
the senior's coalition, questioning the safety of Canadian, European prescription drugs.

[01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:55.610]
Because the drug companies want to continue raping you people for your prescription drugs,

[01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:57.150]
and they're getting everybody in a panicking.

[01:11:57.430 --> 01:12:00.890]
Oh, we can't be sure over the safety of those drugs from Canada and Europe.

[01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:05.510]
Like if you buy whatever you're buying, Zochor in the US,

[01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.110]
it's different from the Zochor they sell here.

[01:12:07.270 --> 01:12:08.810]
I mean, who the hell's kidding who here, huh?

[01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:11.890]
And then I got the British claim they invented lasagna.

[01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:12.950]
Oh, right.

[01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.430]
The good story.

[01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:14.950]
All kinds of crap.

[01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.870]
So little time and so much crap, you know what?

[01:12:17.570 --> 01:12:18.770]
Like I said, that's our specialty.

[01:12:18.870 --> 01:12:20.230]
We'll find out what Andrew was just front seat.

[01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:21.570]
Probably John Ford left it there.

[01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:23.510]
Well, what an asshole he turned out to be, you know?

[01:12:23.610 --> 01:12:24.410]
Yeah, with his cardigans.

[01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:28.370]
Worked with me and the bird and Captain Dave on Zeta pretending to be our good buddy.

[01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.290]
And then all of a sudden when he came home with a passing crowd,

[01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.570]
wouldn't even speak to me.

[01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.630]
Pretending he didn't even know me until one day.

[01:12:34.030 --> 01:12:35.890]
Who was it that tried to diminue that one day?

[01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:39.370]
Was it Bulger or was it the Harry penis?

[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:40.310]
The Harry penis.

[01:12:41.210 --> 01:12:42.250]
Hey, Harry, how's it going?

[01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:45.370]
One thing about the packs now,

[01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:47.370]
if they sure had a lot of drunks working for them, you know?

[01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:48.650]
I think it was a club.

[01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:51.770]
28 past 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

[01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:53.490]
When the time comes to have your carpets cleaned,

[01:12:53.710 --> 01:12:55.230]
the name you want to think about is dry concepts.

[01:12:55.630 --> 01:12:58.790]
You know, everybody that comes to work wasn't for using dry concepts here a couple weeks ago?

[01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:02.350]
6203 was the loon, the loon lineup.

[01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:05.690]
Okay, so in other words, almost the entire month of June.

[01:13:06.130 --> 01:13:09.670]
Yes, well not really because the spring work at a June 18.

[01:13:09.930 --> 01:13:12.770]
So in all fairness, it's like a little more than a half a month that he'll be there.

[01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:13.750]
But he should make an impact.

[01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:15.590]
You better make an impact, Scott or else.

[01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:17.170]
We're also going to take away those Marlon tickets.

[01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:18.250]
What are you going to do?

[01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:20.750]
Anyway, dry concepts was in my home a week ago,

[01:13:20.870 --> 01:13:22.790]
two dated their usual stellar job over the years.

[01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:25.710]
Over 20 years I've been using them in my house because nobody anywhere is better.

[01:13:25.710 --> 01:13:28.850]
Dry concepts is the number one carpark cleaning company in the world

[01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.030]

We're sports radio five cities.

[01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:23.610]
You and you, A.M.

[01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:26.310]
Matchly a lesbian.

[01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:27.370]
You checked out.

[01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:38.990]
If you fry your cats in Crisco.

[01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:40.830]
All right.

[01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:47.270]
Make them tasty and crispy everywhere.

[01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:55.990]
If you fry your cats in Crisco.

[01:14:57.390 --> 01:15:04.010]
You won't miss them at picnics everywhere.

[01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:10.710]
All across the nation.

[01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:19.510]
And a mole of our patients grows thin.

[01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:25.690]
All the consternation.

[01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.110]
Greenpeace emanations.

[01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:34.170]
You're not again.

[01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:38.130]
Not again.

[01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:46.890]
Please do not fry your cats in Crisco.

[01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:48.610]
11-33-560-W.

[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:49.470]
Here's everyone.

[01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:51.370]
How could we forget our close personal friend?

[01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.990]
Party.

[01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:55.090]
Yeah.

[01:15:55.330 --> 01:15:56.010]
Concox.

[01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.910]
Right?

[01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.270]
Right?

[01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:58.290]
Get him on there right away.

[01:15:58.770 --> 01:15:59.850]
And roll a pearl out.

[01:15:59.910 --> 01:16:01.350]
Now there's somebody actually is our friend.

[01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.970]
Roll a pearl.

[01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.450]
Yes indeed.

[01:16:02.770 --> 01:16:03.390]
Good guy.

[01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:04.290]
Very good.

[01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:05.330]
Is he still at the kiss?

[01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:06.090]
Far as I know.

[01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:09.250]
See that's amazing part about that.

[01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:10.930]
I mean power 96 all the way.

[01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:12.230]
They're in the same building power 96.

[01:16:12.450 --> 01:16:13.810]
We still have no idea who's working over there.

[01:16:13.890 --> 01:16:14.750]
So for Albe's silk.

[01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.130]
Who's a good guy?

[01:16:16.890 --> 01:16:18.970]
But do we know anybody else that works there now?

[01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:20.590]
Tony the Tiger.

[01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:22.430]
He's still there?

[01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.970]
Yeah.

[01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.630]
Kid Curry.

[01:16:24.570 --> 01:16:25.210]
DJ Lars.

[01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:30.990]
I don't know who that is.

[01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:35.130]
Anyway, roll the pearl is going to go on there right away.

[01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.050]
Somebody says how about adding Craig Worthing?

[01:16:37.150 --> 01:16:37.830]
List of course.

[01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:39.550]
How could we forget old Craig?

[01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:42.310]
Well it's a long time.

[01:16:42.450 --> 01:16:46.090]
You know, I mean most of the people we had listening at the KT they've been dead for a long

[01:16:46.090 --> 01:16:46.510]
time.

[01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:47.810]
Maybe 20 years maybe.

[01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.110]
At least.

[01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:53.210]
And here's this fact is you're absolutely right about a beautiful mind.

[01:16:53.210 --> 01:16:54.290]
Everything about it is well done.

[01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:55.250]
Russell Crowe is tremendous.

[01:16:55.390 --> 01:16:58.970]
If you haven't seen LA confidential with Crow and Guy Pierce or the insider you must see them.

[01:16:58.970 --> 01:17:00.590]
Is it good or better than he is in a beautiful mind?

[01:17:00.730 --> 01:17:01.030]
Is that true?

[01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:02.030]
You saw the insider.

[01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:03.070]
I did.

[01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.050]
We talked about it.

[01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:05.610]
The about the smoking thing.

[01:17:06.370 --> 01:17:08.710]
The tobacco company exact and they were making a great movie.

[01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:09.370]
That's a great movie.

[01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.750]
He rides.

[01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:16.030]
And LA confidential is also a very good movie with Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Danny DeVito.

[01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:18.590]
Kevin Spacey is better than that one.

[01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:19.390]
That one the usual suspects.

[01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:20.290]
Oh yeah.

[01:17:21.670 --> 01:17:23.250]
I'm not going to talk about the ending.

[01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:24.050]
You know, whatever.

[01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:25.390]
You like it or you won't.

[01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:27.050]
The ending of one.

[01:17:27.070 --> 01:17:27.150]
The ending of one.

[01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:27.370]
The ending of one.

[01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:28.490]
The ending of one.

[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.490]

[01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.490]

[01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:28.710]

[01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:28.710]

[01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:28.730]

[01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.750]

[01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.750]

[01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.750]

[01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.790]

[01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.950]
The ending of one.

[01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.950]

[01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.950]

[01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:29.070]
The ending of one.

[01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.070]

[01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:29.470]
The ending of one.

[01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:30.550]
The ending of one.

[01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:31.910]
The ending of one.

[01:17:31.930 --> 01:17:32.710]
The ending of one.

[01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:33.650]
The ending of one.

[01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:35.590]
The ending of one.

[01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:42.490]
The ending of one.

[01:17:44.010 --> 01:17:47.630]
The ending of one.

[01:17:50.010 --> 01:17:53.390]
The ending of one.

[01:17:53.390 --> 01:17:53.990]

[01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:53.990]

[01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:53.990]

[01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.290]

[01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.730]
The ending of one.

[01:17:55.850 --> 01:17:56.490]
The ending of one.

[01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:56.610]
The ending of one.

[01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:56.610]

[01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:56.810]
The ending of one.

[01:17:57.190 --> 01:17:58.410]

[01:17:58.410 --> 01:17:58.410]

[01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.810]
Gurry Luthor Rellel Thinking

[01:18:41.810 --> 01:18:41.830]
R Н Hall O Prima bear

[01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.830]

[01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:46.710]
You need some help real

[01:18:46.710 --> 01:18:52.130]
You've never heard the whining he went through this morning about how Gary's guy's Gary Sarner screwed him over on an account.

[01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:54.470]
Yeah, both here for that whining.

[01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:57.010]
And I mean, I, I empathize, I sympathize.

[01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:58.090]
But what am I going to do about it?

[01:18:58.090 --> 01:18:59.530]
You know, it's different in that place.

[01:18:59.790 --> 01:19:00.330]
It's typical.

[01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:01.510]
What am I going to do?

[01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:05.730]
Make up for the 50 cents a week that you're going to lose it or not having an account or whatever it is.

[01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:07.350]
I'm already paying your goddamn car payment.

[01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:08.770]
I, yeah, asshole.

[01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.770]
He was just venting.

[01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.870]
But I don't want to hear it.

[01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:13.130]
I'm on vacation.

[01:19:13.130 --> 01:19:14.010]
I'm not even here.

[01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.830]
This is a recording.

[01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:17.810]
Phil Henry 70 votes.

[01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:19.790]
He's running away with it as we figured he would.

[01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:20.270]
Are you sure?

[01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.630]
Sure.

[01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:21.890]
He used to be really great.

[01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:27.030]
Used to be Jim Manage 31 George Rodriguez 30.

[01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.290]
Wendy Rhodes 19.

[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:31.610]
Suds Coleman 15 Rick Shaw 14.

[01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:32.610]
Mike Winnery 14.

[01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:35.490]
Mikey is spinning in his grave here in a George got more votes than he's got.

[01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:37.310]
In fact, just hearing that George is on the air.

[01:19:37.710 --> 01:19:39.370]
Hank Goldberg 10 Bill Calder 10.

[01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:43.830]
Sometimes I feel I haven't played one of those in a long time.

[01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:44.210]
You know what?

[01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:44.630]
Yoder.

[01:19:45.370 --> 01:19:47.130]
I should play all of them.

[01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:50.010]
Oh, those, those are great.

[01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:50.810]
Is what they are.

[01:19:55.390 --> 01:20:04.050]
Sometimes I feel myself sometimes I feel that Jim is passing

[01:20:04.050 --> 01:20:04.990]
you by.

[01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:06.030]
Oh, I can.

[01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:09.730]
I feel and then there's always.

[01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.950]
Oh, I.

[01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:27.970]
Sometimes I feel.

[01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.430]
Oh, they're watching me by.

[01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:36.710]
There's one of the unsung heroes of South Florida Radio for the last many, many years

[01:20:36.710 --> 01:20:37.710]
as our good friend, Mitch Lewis.

[01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.890]
Am I right?

[01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:41.070]
He's the best.

[01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:42.510]
He's an unsung hero.

[01:20:42.610 --> 01:20:43.730]
He's the guy that gave us back.

[01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:47.150]
And also boy and so many other things.

[01:20:47.450 --> 01:20:48.070]
Always good.

[01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:50.630]
Anyway, the fact from Brian says, how about her?

[01:20:50.690 --> 01:20:55.410]
Remember me being from the GT R glory days before it turned into the soap coast station

[01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.570]
with your bloody Johnny dark.

[01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:58.170]
How about Johnny dark?

[01:20:59.250 --> 01:20:59.870]
He was never on.

[01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:01.810]
Well, yeah, he was on your reading liners.

[01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:02.630]
Yeah, get Johnny dark.

[01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:05.470]
I mean, he'll appreciate it, especially since you all of them come in for lunch anymore.

[01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:13.510]
No, seriously, I like Johnny, even though I just don't want him sitting there pretending

[01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:14.590]
to be in my sidekick.

[01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:17.570]
I was pretty embarrassing Johnny and her.

[01:21:17.670 --> 01:21:19.150]
And McBean, but how do we do that?

[01:21:19.230 --> 01:21:19.650]
Because we're out.

[01:21:19.770 --> 01:21:20.730]
We're out putting groups on.

[01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:21.410]
We're putting individuals.

[01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:23.030]
I I don't know.

[01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.630]
I don't even get her.

[01:21:23.730 --> 01:21:24.450]
And skip her man.

[01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:25.070]
That was his name.

[01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:25.570]
Mm hmm.

[01:21:25.710 --> 01:21:26.610]
I was McBean's name.

[01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:29.790]
Ali McBean was it was a Jim McBean?

[01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.950]
I think I'll somebody will know.

[01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:33.290]
I think it was Jim McBean.

[01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:36.790]
Also Billy Raven from Love 94, Seven of Midnight.

[01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:38.010]
Do you have any idea who that is?

[01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:38.650]
Never heard of it.

[01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:39.390]
Billy Raven.

[01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:40.590]
How about how could you forget?

[01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:44.730]
He you know he's going to take it personal and maybe commit suicide before he starts his new job.

[01:21:45.230 --> 01:21:45.910]
Greg Vidal.

[01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.750]
Greg Vidal.

[01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:47.870]
Gregory Benjamin Vidal.

[01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:49.710]
A legend in his own mind.

[01:21:49.810 --> 01:21:50.370]
Well, we're slipping.

[01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.410]
Huh?

[01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:55.310]
Get him on there before he starts to take a lot of pills or something.

[01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:56.090]
Then don't forget.

[01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:58.930]
It's a good time for the great taste.

[01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:05.930]
Neil, this is noodles reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste.

[01:22:06.670 --> 01:22:07.630]
Yeah, noodles hasn't come back.

[01:22:07.690 --> 01:22:09.110]
He's still in that opium parlor.

[01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:14.190]
See, I watched that again at the four hour version.

[01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:14.690]
That was great.

[01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:22.190]
I mean, how many movies can you watch until you have to take a few days off and let your brains unscramble and absorb all the stuff you watched before?

[01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:25.390]
But I think I better get the big little whiskey.

[01:22:25.570 --> 01:22:26.510]
I better get that one this weekend.

[01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:31.910]
And what was the one you were just touting a minute ago with Russell Crowe LA confidential?

[01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:33.490]
Yeah, I never thought that's good.

[01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:34.330]
Very good.

[01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:36.410]
Yeah, that's what you said about bully too.

[01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:36.790]
Okay.

[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:39.610]
Bulley and the bully bully and all that other crap.

[01:22:39.610 --> 01:22:42.870]
Whatever it had you were peddling those little punky kitty movies.

[01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.670]
Those awful nasty kids, gummo George.

[01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:49.430]
George didn't recommend gummo.

[01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:52.790]
I've never seen so many more kids don't.

[01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.330]
I won't even let them near my machine.

[01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:57.090]
I won't let the kids near my machine.

[01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:59.590]
Twenty till noon at five sixty W.

[01:22:59.710 --> 01:23:01.470]
Here's something you ought to let near your mouth.

[01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:02.790]
And that's no, not that.

[01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:03.570]
Oliometh.

[01:23:04.010 --> 01:23:08.050]
Oliometh soft gels contain the finest olive oil on this planet around any planet for that matter.

[01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:11.450]
I can't imagine they got too much olive oil on the other planets because they're not growing too many trees.

[01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:12.770]
They're growing too many olives.

[01:23:13.510 --> 01:23:17.030]
Anyway, this isn't just your ordinary pedestrian olive oil like you'd find on the Uranus.

[01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:19.430]
It's super concentrated and loaded with health benefits.

[01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:20.410]
Oliometh everyday.

[01:23:20.490 --> 01:23:21.350]
I was just thinking about that.

[01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.370]
Oliometh on Uranus.

[01:23:23.410 --> 01:23:26.050]
Oliometh everyday can produce the risk of heart disease, not cholesterol.

[01:23:26.050 --> 01:23:32.250]
Plus there are 14 different Oliometh formulas for you to choose from each one combining the best pharmaceutical grade olive oil you can find

[01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:36.490]
on the universe with vitamins, minerals and herbals to support specific needs in your health.

[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:39.470]
From your bones to your blood pressure to your immune system.

[01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:41.750]
Just pick out those formulas that are right for what you need.

[01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:43.910]
Now there are three new exciting Oliometh formulas.

[01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:47.210]
Want to help your sleep, want to help you control your weight and sell Q10.

[01:23:47.610 --> 01:23:51.010]
Believe me, CoQ10 is one of the most important things you could ever stuff in your mouth.

[01:23:51.550 --> 01:23:56.030]
Pick up some Oliometh while you're out shopping today at Public's Echoids Walgreens Whole Food Markets, Debrons and Sedanos,

[01:24:10.690 --> 01:24:12.810]

[01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:16.650]
This is 4356-QA2A.

[01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:20.730]
But let me say something for, let me say something.

[01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:23.030]
Boy, what a workout, huh Tom?

[01:24:23.250 --> 01:24:24.610]
Oh yeah, I'm feeling pumped now.

[01:24:24.730 --> 01:24:27.010]
Hey, after we hit the showers you want to go to scarves some burgers?

[01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:27.610]
Sure Frank.

[01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:28.290]
Sounds great.

[01:24:28.290 --> 01:24:31.090]
Oh, tea Tom, nice skidmark you got there.

[01:24:31.290 --> 01:24:34.050]
Yeah, I have a little trouble with butt spits whenever I break wind.

[01:24:34.230 --> 01:24:34.990]
But what are you gonna do?

[01:24:35.290 --> 01:24:35.610]
Butt hay?

[01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:36.110]
What?

[01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.910]
Butt hay?

[01:24:37.150 --> 01:24:37.850]
Butt hay what?

[01:24:38.130 --> 01:24:38.310]
No!

[01:24:38.770 --> 01:24:40.110]
Butt hay, it's new.

[01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:43.970]
It acts as a shield against those nasty skidmarks that conform after days of use.

[01:24:44.350 --> 01:24:46.010]
You know, I think I'm gonna try new butt hay.

[01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:48.890]
Without the markings, how I know which way my underwear goes.

[01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:50.650]
Well, you've always got old yeller.

[01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:51.410]
Oh yeah.

[01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:54.370]
Butt hay, my bro text.

[01:24:54.370 --> 01:24:58.610]
It's 1146, 14-dil-newnet 560 WFM, they highly popularly,

[01:24:58.730 --> 01:25:00.150]
the wildly popular Jim Mandits.

[01:25:00.230 --> 01:25:00.650]
Oh right.

[01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:04.370]
Mad dogs coming up at 2 o'clock, Hank, the hump will be on 4-7, 3-4 hours.

[01:25:04.730 --> 01:25:06.730]
No ballgame tonight, Marlon's in the Cubs tomorrow.

[01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.270]
Let's give away some Marlon tickets, what are you saying?

[01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.770]
Come on, come on.

[01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:11.030]
You need 10?

[01:25:11.230 --> 01:25:11.830]
I got you covered.

[01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:16.430]
Oh, let's see, aside from me, a LeBest all-time South Florida radio personality user was

[01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:19.650]
Phil Henry just waltzing away, just burying the competition.

[01:25:20.650 --> 01:25:21.390]
83 votes.

[01:25:21.390 --> 01:25:23.130]
George Rodriguez got 40.

[01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:25.430]
Jim Mandits 35.

[01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:28.150]
Now, aren't you embarrassed that they made you the crank vote of the day?

[01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:29.870]
Yeah, I'm shocked and mortified.

[01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:33.690]
Jim Mandits 35, Randy Roads 22, Micronary 17.

[01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:35.150]
I'm only gonna read the double digits.

[01:25:35.410 --> 01:25:39.430]
Rick Shaw 17, Suds Quilman 16, Bill Calder 10, The Humpers got 10.

[01:25:39.650 --> 01:25:41.230]
And for a while, there was a late edition of that 10.

[01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:44.270]
We have problems with that as far as, you know, Marlon gave everybody else a handy crap.

[01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.610]
Right?

[01:25:46.230 --> 01:25:46.490]
Sure.

[01:25:46.810 --> 01:25:47.710]
He'll be zooming up the list.

[01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:49.230]
In fact, he might even pass George.

[01:25:50.850 --> 01:25:54.050]
Dan says, how the heck would anybody remember Alan Burke to even vote?

[01:25:54.190 --> 01:25:57.870]
Well, if they're remembering, I see Craig Worthings got one.

[01:25:58.190 --> 01:25:59.250]
Alice Randthell's got four.

[01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:01.970]
How many is Jerry Williams got?

[01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:02.830]
The late great Jerry Williams.

[01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:03.010]
Three.

[01:26:03.650 --> 01:26:03.650]

[01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:04.110]

[01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:05.810]
One of those is mine.

[01:26:06.670 --> 01:26:07.350]
How sad.

[01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:08.190]
One of the legends.

[01:26:08.190 --> 01:26:13.770]
I mean, he was no George Rodriguez, but anyway, how the heck would anybody remember Alan Burke to even vote?

[01:26:13.870 --> 01:26:16.010]
I'd have to say Phil reviled as he may be in recent days.

[01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:18.750]
Although I did love listening to Burke and even go to old Jeff Charles.

[01:26:20.650 --> 01:26:22.410]
Do we want to put Jeff Charles on here?

[01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:22.750]
Who?

[01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.790]
No, we don't want to put him on there.

[01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:30.430]
Rick and Suds in the morning, then Neil, then Phil never again will be a golden lineup like that.

[01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:32.410]
Still brings tears to my eyes to Dan Leslie.

[01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:33.370]
And me too, Dan.

[01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:34.070]
Almost as many.

[01:26:35.610 --> 01:26:39.470]
Almost as many as when I was watching it last 20 minutes of a beautiful mine.

[01:26:39.510 --> 01:26:40.230]
Everything was great.

[01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:43.850]
I think I should take some of these calls because I'm a risked role in the long.

[01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:46.210]
Got a lot of stuff here as Rick Rollywood say.

[01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:47.070]
Look what did for Rick.

[01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:48.950]
The big Q.A.M.

[01:26:49.230 --> 01:26:50.610]
See nobody on it even wait now.

[01:26:50.610 --> 01:26:52.250]
I only been rambling for about 45 minutes.

[01:26:52.370 --> 01:26:53.770]
You people better get with it at summertime.

[01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:54.930]
There's nothing going on there.

[01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.710]
You're not fooling me.

[01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:58.870]
Got the big rolling stones here July 30th.

[01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:04.250]
Gonna be some people coming up from the estates, maybe even from South Florida for that.

[01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:05.850]
The guests who?

[01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:07.230]
AC DC?

[01:27:07.710 --> 01:27:08.290]
Eyesley Brothers?

[01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:08.890]
Rush?

[01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:11.490]
Justin, think about it.

[01:27:11.490 --> 01:27:12.450]
And a bunch of other people too.

[01:27:12.450 --> 01:27:14.030]
Do I leave anybody out?

[01:27:14.350 --> 01:27:16.350]
The one good piece of news Ann Murray won't be there.

[01:27:16.630 --> 01:27:18.970]
And either we'll soy and he I'm sure he'll be there either or so.

[01:27:20.170 --> 01:27:22.910]
WQ I am senior cruise won't be there.

[01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:24.010]
Hello?

[01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:25.030]
Yes sir.

[01:27:25.690 --> 01:27:30.330]
I can't believe that George Duke's allow us to take a far famous from you.

[01:27:30.410 --> 01:27:30.750]
Yeah okay.

[01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:32.850]
Thanks very much sir Reverend Jones asshole.

[01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.750]
Drop dead.

[01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:35.290]
WQ I am.

[01:27:35.330 --> 01:27:38.810]
George Duke's name is the business character way of fooling up at it.

[01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:40.110]
Yeah he is.

[01:27:40.630 --> 01:27:41.330]
WQ I am.

[01:27:41.770 --> 01:27:42.170]
Neil.

[01:27:42.610 --> 01:27:43.010]
Yes sir.

[01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.710]
How you doing?

[01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:44.350]
Okay.

[01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:46.010]
I just I'm out of here.

[01:27:46.050 --> 01:27:47.250]
Have you seen beautiful mine yet?

[01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:49.630]
No I haven't seen it yet.

[01:27:49.710 --> 01:27:50.330]
I'll check it out.

[01:27:51.010 --> 01:27:51.750]
WQ I am.

[01:27:52.730 --> 01:27:53.810]
Yes good morning Neil.

[01:27:54.150 --> 01:27:54.430]
Yes sir.

[01:27:54.510 --> 01:27:54.750]
How are you?

[01:27:55.330 --> 01:28:02.190]
I was vote for Ron and Rob but only if they were listed together on the call because once they separated they were never the same.

[01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:03.910]
But Ron and Ron together I would vote for.

[01:28:04.330 --> 01:28:04.710]
Really?

[01:28:05.130 --> 01:28:05.410]
Yeah.

[01:28:05.770 --> 01:28:06.690]
Even better than George?

[01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:08.450]
Better than George.

[01:28:09.170 --> 01:28:11.090]
Only because they made me laugh a lot more.

[01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:12.530]
George isn't funny.

[01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:14.270]
George is very entertaining but not funny.

[01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:16.790]
Right he makes you think about things but he never makes me laugh.

[01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:17.730]
He is too cerebral.

[01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:21.590]
Yeah he gets caught up in these fangs and he can even eat a lot.

[01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.290]
Yeah you're right he is boring.

[01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:24.470]
Okay thanks a lot Pallie.

[01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:26.570]
56705 60.

[01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:36.370]
John Benton stood before that he fructy piscable priest the man Benton accused of sexually abusing him up to a hundred times thirty years ago.

[01:28:36.370 --> 01:28:37.670]
This is in Largo Florida.

[01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:41.330]
A panellist Pascot judge ordered the ex priest to look at Benton.

[01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:42.710]
You stripped away my youth.

[01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:43.550]
You stole my innocence.

[01:28:43.630 --> 01:28:44.650]
You destroyed my spirituality.

[01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:46.430]
Benton said in the pack court room yesterday.

[01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:50.590]
Mr. Pollard you are guilty and most certainly meet your end in a cold and lonely prison.

[01:28:51.390 --> 01:28:54.030]
To which we say absolutely correct sir.

[01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:59.650]
Richard A. Pollard, father Dick, dressed in a blue jail uniform stupid out showing any apparent emotion.

[01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:06.350]
Pollard 74 pleaded guilty to two capital social battery charges and was sentenced to 25 years in prison for abuse that occurred while I was in prison.

[01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:07.430]
Pollard was a priest.

[01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:11.230]
It all Saints Episcopal Church in Tarpen Springs about well about a year ago.

[01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:12.170]
About 30 man.

[01:29:12.330 --> 01:29:13.650]
That's what it says about 30 years ago.

[01:29:14.090 --> 01:29:17.910]
Pollard must serve every day of the sentence which would make him 99 if he's ever released.

[01:29:18.370 --> 01:29:21.030]
Judge Jackson Arnold said a sentence was tantamount to life.

[01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:26.970]
Benton a residential designer was family of friends that had been friends with Pollard when he was a boy.

[01:29:27.630 --> 01:29:32.690]
Total 30s he was sexually abused by Pollard both in Tampa and Tarpen Springs and it goes on and on and on.

[01:29:32.690 --> 01:29:38.790]
Other tragic story that assholes like this would like to cover up in a very upset that we actually put them on here because it's true.

[01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:46.910]
Because it's embarrassing and humiliating and degrading that this the world's biggest scan the world's biggest closet continues to go on and flourish.

[01:29:48.230 --> 01:29:50.270]
Although they're a little bit churred on cash at the Vatican.

[01:29:50.370 --> 01:29:51.090]
You want to help Mark George?

[01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.870]
I'm not.

[01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:53.030]
And being able to take it up a collection.

[01:29:53.250 --> 01:29:53.450]
Good.

[01:29:54.670 --> 01:29:58.730]
Now this story about Russell Weller like I said of Santa Monica this 86 year old fart.

[01:29:58.730 --> 01:30:01.090]
I don't I just can't stop thinking about it.

[01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:06.910]
Oh you know I knew we were pressure packed today but my God somebody should have cautioned me.

[01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:09.210]
It's almost noon. You know what I haven't done yet?

[01:30:10.810 --> 01:30:12.290]
I was hoping you'd forget.

[01:30:12.670 --> 01:30:13.030]
No.

[01:30:14.150 --> 01:30:14.910]
I have it.

[01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:16.410]
I have it marked in my book right here.

[01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.870]
We're already through page three.

[01:30:18.010 --> 01:30:19.650]
I'm going to move on to page four.

[01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:23.090]
Another paragraph from that bestseller living history.

[01:30:23.230 --> 01:30:26.170]
Hillary Rodham Clinton which is sold over a million books from coast to coast.

[01:30:26.170 --> 01:30:30.670]
Hillary says my mother's father died in 1947 so I never even met him.

[01:30:31.390 --> 01:30:37.130]
But I knew my grandmother Della as a weakened self-indulgent woman wrapped up in a television soap opera and disengaged from reality.

[01:30:37.470 --> 01:30:40.010]
When I was about ten and Della was babysitting my brothers and me.

[01:30:40.390 --> 01:30:43.410]
I was hit in the eye by a chain link gate while at the school playground.

[01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:47.610]
I ran home three blocks crying and holding my head as blood streamed down my face.

[01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.530]
All right.

[01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:50.470]
When Della saw me she fainted.

[01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:53.410]
I had to ask our next door neighbor for help in treating my wound.

[01:30:53.410 --> 01:30:57.790]
When Della revived she complained that I had scared her and that she could have gotten hurt when she fell over.

[01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:01.510]
I had to wait for my mom to return and she took me to the hospital to get stitches.

[01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:02.230]
There you go.

[01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:06.730]
And if today's reading brief right to the point from living history by Hillary Rodham Clinton.

[01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:10.630]
You know I'm going to get blank for tank in the numbers in the summer and you're launching torpedoes like that.

[01:31:11.050 --> 01:31:12.050]
What are you talking about?

[01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:15.070]
This audience is riveted Della's book.

[01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:21.890]
I see so in other words he's covering his ass again as he moves into second place here on a pool as he's pumping in all kinds of phoney votes.

[01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:22.590]
I'm sorry.

[01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:30.390]
But I feel like it will be remote told me feel had me 92 George Rodriguez 46 and the worst part is George believes it.

[01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:34.010]
Jim Manus 37 Randy Rhodes 24 Rick Shaw 18.

[01:31:35.450 --> 01:31:38.990]
Renery 17 sud 16 Scott from Ralph 13 he's moving up.

[01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:42.510]
Bill Carter 11 Rick Riley 11 Hank Goldberg the humbers got 10.

[01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:47.670]
Everybody else in single digits any votes for the old timers on here yet one for Craig worthy one for Alan Burke.

[01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:57.430]
Say somebody remembers 342 votes so far you know the I've told you this before but it bears repeating since we're discussing this today old time radio stuff.

[01:31:58.670 --> 01:32:01.790]
If that he was really a very nice guy C K on W.

[01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:08.370]
Weather he was Alan Burke even though on the year he came across as a real curmudgeon and a prick and a hard ass.

[01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:11.930]
Because I replaced him not once but twice.

[01:32:12.410 --> 01:32:13.250]
Were you aware of that?

[01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:14.290]
No I met him once.

[01:32:15.890 --> 01:32:20.070]
They blew him out at I.O.D. when they heard me he was doing afternoons after they got rid of Sandy.

[01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:21.570]
Oh my little baby Sandy.

[01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:21.930]
Sandy P.

[01:32:21.930 --> 01:32:22.790]
Oh let's get her on there.

[01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.350]
Sandy painted a bill Smith but we'll get to that.

[01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:27.390]
And so I replaced him there at I.O.D. and then.

[01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:30.830]
Wait a minute was that the second time.

[01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:37.730]
That was the second time because when they heard me at I.N.C. he was working nights and they replaced me to they hired me to replace him at I.N.C.

[01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:42.650]
And in spite of that when I hit my stroke the first one there at I.O.D.

[01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:45.630]
He was one of the people who called me at home.

[01:32:45.770 --> 01:32:49.090]
I have no idea how I got my home number but coming was extremely nice and concerned.

[01:32:49.090 --> 01:32:50.630]
It was a really great guy and now he's dead.

[01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:54.770]
See the good people are the dead people like Celi Cruz.

[01:32:56.010 --> 01:32:57.930]
So Celi Cruz he was a good person.

[01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:59.730]
She was like bundles of funds.

[01:32:59.730 --> 01:33:01.890]
She was annoying on TV so I hear from Joy.

[01:33:02.190 --> 01:33:03.230]
I scared the hell out of me.

[01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:04.650]
But anyway she's a dead.

[01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:05.630]
It's a mood point now.

[01:33:06.390 --> 01:33:08.430]
Sandy Payton let's get there on there right away.

[01:33:08.610 --> 01:33:14.170]
Okay and I'm sure that a lot of the old ladies out there been waiting breathlessly for Sandy to say.

[01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:14.890]
Have a nice day.

[01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.190]
Right.

[01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:16.070]
What more could you want?

[01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:17.070]
Sandy.

[01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:17.850]
Have a nice day.

[01:33:17.970 --> 01:33:18.790]
Thank you.

[01:33:19.290 --> 01:33:21.310]
I would love to keep you all to myself.

[01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:22.070]
What a bitch.

[01:33:22.250 --> 01:33:27.150]
Everybody at I.O.D. told us I never met her but they told us that see that that's Alan Burk and me verse.

[01:33:28.130 --> 01:33:32.650]
On the air he came across as a prick like I often do and off the air he was a great guy like me.

[01:33:32.650 --> 01:33:33.210]
Right.

[01:33:33.550 --> 01:33:37.910]
Her on the air she came across as sweet and off the air she was a bitch.

[01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:39.510]
Quite everybody that worked with her at I.O.D.

[01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:43.230]
Everybody except of course our friend Cheryl.

[01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:46.150]
But other than that it was unanimous.

[01:33:46.210 --> 01:33:48.270]
Who was the one that hated like I guess a renery.

[01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:50.050]
I didn't get along at all.

[01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:52.450]
I used to do their own little cross over there and he hated her.

[01:33:52.830 --> 01:33:56.650]
Oh after I went there and you mentioned her name he would like hyperventilate.

[01:33:57.670 --> 01:33:58.130]
Sorry for a minute.

[01:33:58.670 --> 01:33:58.930]
Huh?

[01:33:59.390 --> 01:33:59.430]
Huh?

[01:33:59.790 --> 01:34:00.050]
I'm sorry.

[01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:03.470]
Did you say say you're not getting reneering now the man is dead for crying out loud.

[01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:04.810]
He was a good guy.

[01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.870]
Yes he was.

[01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:08.970]
See you have a bug up your ass because of Roger Magdalene.

[01:34:09.190 --> 01:34:09.610]

[01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:31.330]
About the 30 man.

[01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:33.810]

You're a silly person.

[01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:55.030]

[01:42:13.610 --> 01:42:14.230]
He's an asshole.

[01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:14.990]
No.

[01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.130]

[01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:23.510]
See he wasn't totally a more.

[01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.490]

We made him into well.

[01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:29.490]
I made him into a legend.

[01:42:30.990 --> 01:42:32.390]
I mean anybody that can say.

[01:42:32.490 --> 01:42:32.730]
Oh.

[01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:34.910]
With the kind of fruity enthusiasm that he did and.

[01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:35.250]
Okay.

[01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.250]
What's not to like.

[01:42:36.330 --> 01:42:37.890]
Plus we got all these things in here.

[01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:38.710]
There's only one.

[01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:39.570]

[01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:40.330]
Thank God.

[01:42:40.450 --> 01:42:42.590]
And I don't want to be him.

[01:42:42.750 --> 01:42:43.090]
Foundal.

[01:42:43.090 --> 01:42:43.330]
He's not available.

[01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:43.810]

[01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:45.130]

[01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:45.390]
Oh man.

[01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:46.470]
I saw him once.

[01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:47.710]
It made me a bird.

[01:42:47.810 --> 01:42:49.810]
I wanted to go straight so bad when I saw that child.

[01:42:49.890 --> 01:42:52.830]
He made freaky carols out there at our reception desk.

[01:42:53.070 --> 01:42:54.310]
Seemed like a Hercules.

[01:42:54.630 --> 01:42:55.950]
He had a handshake like Bob Neil.

[01:42:56.850 --> 01:42:57.210]
Yeah.

[01:42:57.410 --> 01:42:57.590]
Fruity.

[01:42:57.670 --> 01:42:58.030]
Real fruity.

[01:42:58.190 --> 01:42:59.450]
By the way, Bob Neil, we hate you.

[01:42:59.610 --> 01:43:00.630]
We can't stand you.

[01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:03.910]
I want to pass this along just so you can't say you didn't tell us so.

[01:43:03.970 --> 01:43:04.550]
We told you so.

[01:43:06.510 --> 01:43:06.870]
What?

[01:43:07.190 --> 01:43:08.370]
You don't even know what it is yet.

[01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:10.030]
I'm speculating.

[01:43:10.670 --> 01:43:11.710]
No, you have no idea.

[01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:12.690]
I have in fact this story.

[01:43:12.690 --> 01:43:13.910]
It's not one of our bedtime stories.

[01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:14.630]
All it should be.

[01:43:15.670 --> 01:43:19.630]
Internet users who allow others to copy songs from their hard drives could face prison

[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:23.690]
time, beener boy under legislation introduced by two Democratic lawmakers yesterday.

[01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:26.010]
And the ticket defense team will be able to help you with this one.

[01:43:27.230 --> 01:43:28.570]
I'm not saying that you're doing that.

[01:43:28.610 --> 01:43:30.030]
I'm just passing through a computer.

[01:43:30.030 --> 01:43:31.090]
Was it I'm passing it along?

[01:43:31.370 --> 01:43:31.990]
Oh, thank you.

[01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:37.350]
The bill is the strongest attempt yet to deter the widespread online song copying that recording

[01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:39.630]
company says led today to client and CD sales.

[01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:41.450]
Of course, it couldn't have anything to do with the crappy music.

[01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:41.930]
It couldn't.

[01:43:42.570 --> 01:43:47.650]
No sponsored by Michigan representative John Conniers and California representative Howard

[01:43:47.650 --> 01:43:48.170]
Burman.

[01:43:48.890 --> 01:43:53.150]
The bill would make it easier to slide criminal charges on Internet users who copy music, movies,

[01:43:53.530 --> 01:43:56.330]
and other copyrighted files over peer to peer networks.

[01:43:57.490 --> 01:44:00.050]
Also over peer to queer networks too.

[01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:01.310]
Recording industry.

[01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:03.110]
Are you interrupting me again?

[01:44:03.190 --> 01:44:03.190]

[01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:06.330]
Here I'm trying to do like a couple of bedtime stories.

[01:44:06.330 --> 01:44:10.990]
The recording industry is aggressively pursued Napster, Kazai and other peer to peer networks

[01:44:10.990 --> 01:44:14.250]
in court and recently announced a plan to sue individual users as well.

[01:44:14.990 --> 01:44:21.010]
In a series of hearings on Capitol Hill last spring lawmakers condemned online song swapping and expressed concern that

[01:44:21.010 --> 01:44:25.950]
efforts could spread computer viruses, create government security risk and allow children access to pornography.

[01:44:26.650 --> 01:44:30.130]
Few online copy or write violators have faced criminal charges so far.

[01:44:30.490 --> 01:44:35.230]
A New Jersey man pleaded guilty distributing a digital copy of the movie The Hulk in federal court three

[01:44:35.230 --> 01:44:40.450]
weeks ago but the Justice Department has not taken action against Internet users who offer millions of copies of songs each day.

[01:44:40.930 --> 01:44:47.450]
The Conniers Burman bill would operate under the assumption that each copy write had work made available through a computer network was copied by at least 10 others

[01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:56.230]
and by others at least 10 times for retail total value of 25 or bucks that would bump the activity from a misdemeanor to a felony carrying a jail sentence up to five years in jail.

[01:44:57.810 --> 01:45:03.190]
It would also allow the practice of videotaping a theater, a movie in the theater, a favorite elicit method of copying movies.

[01:45:04.370 --> 01:45:12.370]
Can you imagine that? I don't have to imagine it. No seriously, have you ever seen a guy watching a movie in a theater with a camcorder?

[01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:18.490]
Yes. You have? Yes. Get out of here. No. No seriously, have you seen that?

[01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:25.290]
They usually do it during the private screenings, the pre-screenings that they make available to the critics.

[01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:31.370]
I think those people are just going to stop right on the spot. I mean what kind of crap is that? I mean talk about being blatant and obvious.

[01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:39.490]
At least go out and get a boot like power didn't want. I'm not suggesting that. But I mean obvious. That's what the seller. That's what you must sell it. Yeah, that's where they get the boot like assholes.

[01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:47.610]
George is moving a little up onto Phil's ass there. Aside from Neil the best all time. What? You're giving me a little laugh.

[01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:59.210]
You got a shot, man. Like like Jimmy Johnson said. We got a shot. We got a shot. Aside from Neil the best all time software, radio, personal, user was best all time over the last hundred years.

[01:45:59.210 --> 01:46:05.590]
All through these golden oldies days of radio. And now ladies and gentlemen, the Charlie Van Dyke show. CKW.

[01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:13.730]
Well, here we are in this market. Phil Henry 103, George Rodriguez 65, the mad dog Jim Mann which 44. Oh, you got him beat.

[01:46:14.650 --> 01:46:22.830]
Randy Rhodes 29. 29 Randy. What? Rick Sean 19. Ricky Tickie started to put a little move on his pist.

[01:46:23.850 --> 01:46:29.690]
Rik Winery 18. Suds Coleman 17. Rick Riley 16. But if you put them together, they still can't come close to George.

[01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:37.970]
Hank Goldberg 14 Scott for Ralph 14. Now, when you think for a week, move up a little off faster. He just has a robot up. He hasn't been here that long yet though.

[01:46:38.710 --> 01:46:48.810]
Exactly. I mean, when you look at George's got 65 votes and for else got 14 and Moe's got only eight. In fact, you add them together. They got 22 between the two of them.

[01:46:49.670 --> 01:46:58.490]
And you got 65. Suds. You got to be now listen to me 65 to 22. That means you're going to be getting paid three times as much as the two of them put together.

[01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:11.330]
Bill Connor 11. Joy Reynolds, Joey Reynolds 10. Mohawar David at eight. Joey Reynolds is even beaten out the moment. Absolutely. Wow. That's embarrassing. And you know what? That's humiliating. I know the brother. Listen to Joey.

[01:47:11.850 --> 01:47:24.450]
We that's just a cheap shot. And don't say too loud because I'm listening. He's monitoring right now. No, not on his day off again. His days off are just excuses to sit there and keep the radio cranked up.

[01:47:24.450 --> 01:47:34.210]
You're loud and grumble all day long. You're a cruel man. He's got that blood thing. He's got the blood blood disorder that's for all made up right. The one that he made up so it was not to do it. So we could stiffer on that golf tournament.

[01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:42.550]
If I ever heard that man talking about charity about the giving back to the community and raising money for charity again. I'm going to spit blood all over his post. I don't have a blood disorder.

[01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:55.390]
I can't wait until the winter time until November when I come back for the entire winter. That's going to be great. I'm going to come in extra early every day to avoid the traffic and to bond with my close personal friend. The mole man. That'll be great. Absolutely.

[01:47:55.750 --> 01:48:08.890]
Can't wait. I'm serious. I'm going to hang around in the control room there with that muskrat on my head. You know that. Were you were you were you on vacation that day? I don't think you were there that day. Were you there? I was here. Are you sure? Yeah.

[01:48:09.970 --> 01:48:21.350]
Are you sure that Boca Brian brought in here? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I slept at my head and I walked into control and he looked at me like. Like that almost had a heart attack. Yeah. He didn't know whether a scream or eat a banana.

[01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:29.330]
The best part was when he started chuckling and said, take off those checkered pants. He's obsessed with my pants. I think he wants to get in my cell. I think that's a deal.

[01:48:29.850 --> 01:48:36.830]
I believe that I think he's got the hot for me. So obsessed with the way I dress and my shoes and my underpants, all of these things.

[01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:52.950]
I mean, certainly his wife can't be put now for him anymore. I mean, would you? God, well, that sour nasty attitude. He's got 1213 at 560 WQM. It's Neil Rogers summer savings event and it's going on right now presented by the great Tom Limit and Joe Prieto at Haloponti Act GMC.

[01:56:19.050 --> 01:56:21.850]
so i say what's wrong with a bit of a scan here in here how's long we can

[01:56:21.850 --> 01:56:24.750]
continue entertaining the public why not so we have to start over hot

[01:56:24.750 --> 01:56:25.110]
microphone

[01:56:25.110 --> 01:56:27.170]
four hours is a long time and

[01:56:27.170 --> 01:56:27.890]
exhausting

[01:56:27.890 --> 01:56:31.370]
it is exhausting it's a draining it's innovating

[01:56:32.450 --> 01:56:36.050]
it's it's it's exasperating debilitating

[01:56:36.050 --> 01:56:36.970]
everybody

[01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:41.310]
feel Henry one twenty and George's got seventy

[01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:45.270]
a few crankers i mean a few people out there continue supporting George's

[01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:49.050]
way he could pass for like he's standing still. What's about the time they cranked on my behalf?

[01:56:49.230 --> 01:56:55.370]
Are you sure? WQA him, hello. Yeah, I wanted to mention Takima Kalam. Oh, how could we forget

[01:56:55.370 --> 01:57:01.630]
Takima? In fact, you know something? The scratchiest voice before Pharrell was Takima Kalam.

[01:57:01.670 --> 01:57:02.810]
You got it. Thanks.

[01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:05.950]
Front of it. Like sir. Was Peppy Field on the radio?

[01:57:06.810 --> 01:57:10.370]
I'm KT, but like only a part. I mean, if we're going to put her under, you have to put Alphion

[01:57:10.370 --> 01:57:15.070]
there, all those other, I mean, come on. The only KT person to be on her was Craig Worthing

[01:57:15.070 --> 01:57:16.470]
and yours truly. Anybody else know?

[01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:18.130]
I don't know how to spell Daffy Duck, whatever.

[01:57:18.190 --> 01:57:19.810]
C-A-F-F-Y Taffy?

[01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:23.970]
MC, Capital C-A-L-L-U-M Kalam.

[01:57:24.930 --> 01:57:28.230]
Hi, this is Takima Kalam and I'm a real right wing asshole bitch.

[01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:31.490]
Maybe she actually died and turned into an encoder, you think so?

[01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.710]
Sure.

[01:57:31.850 --> 01:57:32.130]
possible.

[01:57:32.670 --> 01:57:36.030]
All the other thing Taffy was whatever Ann is. Not see bitch.

[01:57:36.810 --> 01:57:37.690]
Takima Kalam.

[01:57:38.670 --> 01:57:41.590]
I got another good one for you. How about John?

[01:57:41.590 --> 01:57:42.010]
What?

[01:57:43.670 --> 01:57:45.170]
I forgot all about him.

[01:57:45.170 --> 01:57:45.490]
See?

[01:57:46.530 --> 01:57:49.150]
Oh, and see that would have been a good spot. I'm sorry.

[01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:51.130]
My bad.

[01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:54.510]
That's the part where you're supposed to say from last year.

[01:57:54.570 --> 01:57:55.810]
I didn't know he was dead.

[01:57:55.970 --> 01:57:56.450]
Oh yeah, I was.

[01:57:56.610 --> 01:57:59.610]
Who he was talking about when he was, uh, I didn't know why.

[01:57:59.770 --> 01:58:00.570]
I have no idea.

[01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:04.130]
You're asking me like stuff that happened all that that many years ago.

[01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:07.550]
You got to be off your rocker, whatever your name is.

[01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:10.330]
Five six seven, oh, five six.

[01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:12.470]
No, seriously, my memory is still damn good.

[01:58:12.550 --> 01:58:15.610]
In fact, when you get to be my age, when you get to be a little far like past 60,

[01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:19.610]
you start doing in your spare time while you're sitting there like taking your metamusel,

[01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:21.950]
you know, whether you have to spoon in the glass,

[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:24.570]
you're spinning the metamusel right and why you're doing that?

[01:58:24.650 --> 01:58:28.050]
You start thinking about, uh, and with me, of course, it's harness racing.

[01:58:28.150 --> 01:58:30.790]
As long as I can remember, all the horses driven by Francis O'Hare

[01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:34.530]
from Flushing Michigan, you know, OH Jane, OH Leo, Buckydale,

[01:58:34.730 --> 01:58:36.850]
and think of the times, the quarter times of the races.

[01:58:36.850 --> 01:58:38.730]
Ed that I know my mind is okay.

[01:58:39.670 --> 01:58:41.590]
Mildred R driven by Kermit Beetle.

[01:58:42.110 --> 01:58:43.830]
How many years ago these things are?

[01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:47.930]
140, uh, uh, 40 years plus.

[01:58:49.270 --> 01:58:52.630]
When you can remember that the first horse you ever bet on was named El Dora Janko,

[01:58:52.710 --> 01:58:54.730]
driven by the late Doc McElmery at Hazel Park,

[01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:56.550]
and was from the nine hole in Wonder Racing,

[01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:58.510]
paid too early to show and you buy $2 to show,

[01:58:58.670 --> 01:59:00.450]
then you know that you remember we're still pretty sure.

[01:59:00.850 --> 01:59:01.490]
What's your name?

[01:59:02.570 --> 01:59:06.030]
So you have to be the important stuff, not the minutiae.

[01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:08.430]
Newshire like some of these people we're talking about today.

[01:59:08.950 --> 01:59:10.610]
I did remember Jazz Makedo,

[01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:12.650]
T.L. Bird Radio, that was good, right?

[01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:15.770]
What was your better ratings only, uh, they don't give diaries on the inside.

[01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:21.470]
You actually remember those days he was,

[01:59:21.590 --> 01:59:23.170]
this is the true story for those people,

[01:59:23.330 --> 01:59:24.090]
I'm not old enough to remember.

[01:59:24.210 --> 01:59:26.410]
We had a guy named Jazz Makedo on I.O.D.,

[01:59:26.410 --> 01:59:27.350]
doing afternoons for a while.

[01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:28.530]
Yeah.

[01:59:28.710 --> 01:59:32.270]
We'll actually use to get a lot of phone calls from guys in jail.

[01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:32.630]
Sure.

[01:59:33.050 --> 01:59:34.030]
More than not.

[01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:34.970]
Yeah, right.

[01:59:35.070 --> 01:59:36.590]
Most of his people like us that run inside.

[01:59:37.070 --> 01:59:39.130]
Joe Rose, how could we forget Joe Rose?

[01:59:39.650 --> 01:59:42.210]
My God, especially after the way he's redeemed himself,

[01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:43.250]
these last few weeks,

[01:59:43.410 --> 01:59:44.730]
my God, the things he said about Howard.

[01:59:44.930 --> 01:59:46.790]
He's got a big heart on things like that.

[01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:48.450]
Joe Rose, why isn't chapter four,

[01:59:48.610 --> 01:59:49.010]
it's on this call?

[01:59:49.770 --> 01:59:50.910]
Why isn't Diffle on there?

[01:59:50.930 --> 01:59:51.270]
That's right.

[01:59:52.130 --> 01:59:53.750]
Well, we can't look, it's taking us time.

[01:59:53.770 --> 01:59:55.150]
This is a massive undertaking.

[01:59:56.230 --> 01:59:56.950]
Speaking of undertaking.

[01:59:57.210 --> 01:59:57.550]
Absolutely.

[01:59:57.810 --> 01:59:58.850]
It's a fact about Mo again.

[01:59:59.690 --> 02:00:01.790]
It says, I think another great image of Mo for your website

[02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:03.170]
would be Mo Man the Super Hero.

[02:00:03.170 --> 02:00:05.250]
Can you imagine him standing in checkered pants

[02:00:05.250 --> 02:00:07.590]
with one hand on his hip and other holding a seven iron

[02:00:07.590 --> 02:00:08.710]
with his cape blowing in a wind?

[02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:09.330]
I like that.

[02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:11.870]
It says, if I was computer savvy, I would do it,

[02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:12.250]
but I'm not.

[02:00:12.310 --> 02:00:13.230]
This is from Jay and Pointe.

[02:00:13.470 --> 02:00:14.650]
Also, I like Pharrell a lot,

[02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:16.310]
but he is doing his best to kill a show.

[02:00:16.610 --> 02:00:16.810]
Oh, yeah.

[02:00:17.370 --> 02:00:18.610]
See, it's not just me.

[02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:21.010]
Two hours of, if it's free, it's me.

[02:00:21.130 --> 02:00:22.970]
People calling in droves is dreadful and embarrassing.

[02:00:23.390 --> 02:00:24.770]
You know, you're a great talent for well.

[02:00:24.770 --> 02:00:25.990]
That's what pisses us off even more.

[02:00:26.090 --> 02:00:26.790]
If you had no show,

[02:00:27.110 --> 02:00:29.190]
if you had no actuating, that would be different.

[02:00:29.770 --> 02:00:31.010]
But you're a very funny guy.

[02:00:31.010 --> 02:00:31.650]
You're very entertaining.

[02:00:31.650 --> 02:00:33.050]
You know, some of your sports inside

[02:00:33.050 --> 02:00:35.330]
and not although I'm as aroski wasn't as good as Ryan Sandberg.

[02:00:35.490 --> 02:00:38.230]
But regardless, that's what people tune in for.

[02:00:38.310 --> 02:00:38.630]
Not to hear.

[02:00:38.730 --> 02:00:42.370]
I mean, ticket, if I never did it, I'd be, you know, out of line.

[02:00:42.710 --> 02:00:43.670]
But I've been through that.

[02:00:43.770 --> 02:00:44.630]
I've been there done that.

[02:00:44.710 --> 02:00:46.530]
It was a board of, I mean, George can tell you.

[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:47.290]
Oh, please.

[02:00:47.470 --> 02:00:48.750]
We all know he's a good boy.

[02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:50.150]
How can I head the tickets?

[02:00:50.370 --> 02:00:51.010]
Can I head the ticket?

[02:00:51.170 --> 02:00:52.310]
Oh, my God.

[02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:53.110]
It's a temptation.

[02:00:53.510 --> 02:00:57.430]
It's a worst radio and absolute tune out.

[02:00:57.430 --> 02:00:58.430]
If ever there was one,

[02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:01.430]
the most embarrassing crap that I've ever done

[02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:03.690]
and, you know, W-I-O-D.

[02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:04.550]
Hello.

[02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:05.550]
Ticket central.

[02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:07.890]
Hello, hello, have the ticket, please.

[02:01:08.170 --> 02:01:08.750]
Yeah, there you go.

[02:01:09.290 --> 02:01:11.930]
He was one of the people out of the millions of free loaders

[02:01:11.930 --> 02:01:12.610]
and soft loaders.

[02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:13.730]
It's bad radio, Scott.

[02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:15.150]
The audience is starting to get p-oed.

[02:01:15.650 --> 02:01:16.110]
Cut the crap.

[02:01:16.250 --> 02:01:17.310]
Forget about the freaking Marlon's.

[02:01:17.310 --> 02:01:17.770]
Nobody cares.

[02:01:18.710 --> 02:01:20.570]
You know, hurricane seasons here before storm hits,

[02:01:20.630 --> 02:01:22.170]
you always put up shutters to protect the windows

[02:01:22.170 --> 02:01:23.030]
and doors of your home.

[02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:25.370]
But what about the roof of your house, huh?

[02:01:25.830 --> 02:01:27.190]
The so-may paint factory makes roof

[02:01:27.190 --> 02:01:28.690]
mastic a roof coating that can help you

[02:01:28.690 --> 02:01:29.630]
hurricane-proof your roof.

[02:01:29.630 --> 02:01:32.270]
So may the roof mastic save hundreds and hundreds

[02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:33.950]
and zillions of roofs during hurricane Andrew

[02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:35.770]
while the unprotected roofs are peeding off

[02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:36.710]
and flying down the road.

[02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:39.510]
So may also has waterproof coatings for every kind of roof,

[02:01:39.630 --> 02:01:44.610]
called the so-may paint factory at 305-633-6333.

So may is going to save you a lot of cash

because they eliminate the middleman markups

[02:01:52.450 --> 02:01:53.810]
and they sell to you and everybody else

[02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:56.210]
at wholesale prices that are 60% lower

[02:01:56.210 --> 02:01:57.690]
than what you'd pay for the same national brands

[02:01:57.690 --> 02:01:59.450]
in your expensive retail stores.

[02:01:59.830 --> 02:02:01.530]
So protect your home and property from softwaters

[02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:34.330]
for W

[02:02:34.330 --> 02:02:36.330]
if you can spot the fat one

[02:02:56.650 --> 02:02:57.410]
you

[02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:59.950]
who's that man on in the morning

[02:03:01.890 --> 02:03:03.750]
the six to ten on S

[02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.970]
U

[02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:09.430]
he's the guy who makes down jello

[02:03:09.430 --> 02:03:10.430]
he's crying

[02:03:11.410 --> 02:03:14.130]
he likes to think he's number one

[02:03:14.690 --> 02:03:16.030]
blah blah

[02:03:17.410 --> 02:03:21.190]
he's bigger than the post-blow bell

[02:03:22.170 --> 02:03:25.470]
his eyelids are the most blah bell

[02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:30.270]
the biggest man in radio today

[02:03:34.730 --> 02:03:37.470]
he plays the songs that make you sleepy

[02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:42.690]
he steals material from me

[02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:48.810]
he gives the time when the weather's looking fine

[02:03:49.730 --> 02:03:52.250]
his jobs have played the song again

[02:03:53.010 --> 02:03:54.410]
blah blah

[02:03:56.530 --> 02:03:59.790]
he's bigger than the post-blow bell

[02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:04.310]
his eyelids are the most blah bell

[02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:08.830]
the biggest man in radio today

[02:04:13.310 --> 02:04:16.910]
let's make the son our sister station

[02:04:18.530 --> 02:04:20.890]
and bring the blood in here today

[02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:27.010]
if the clap man could lose another kid

[02:04:28.130 --> 02:04:30.710]
he'd have more boring songs to play

[02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.290]
blah bell

[02:04:34.770 --> 02:04:39.490]
he's bigger than the post-blow bell

[02:04:39.490 --> 02:04:42.370]
his eyelids are the most blah bell

[02:04:44.290 --> 02:04:47.470]
the biggest man in radio today

[02:04:50.490 --> 02:04:52.570]
blah bell

[02:04:53.970 --> 02:04:57.430]
he's bigger than the post-blow bell

[02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:01.970]
his eyelids are the most blah bell

[02:05:03.570 --> 02:05:07.030]
the biggest man in radio today

[02:05:09.950 --> 02:05:11.450]
from 36 at 5.60

[02:05:11.450 --> 02:05:14.250]
Bob Lasseter is a memory laying a lingers on

[02:05:14.250 --> 02:05:16.110]
he's the only person I ever know in my life

[02:05:16.110 --> 02:05:17.090]
who had fat eyelids

[02:05:17.870 --> 02:05:18.550]
that's what it was

[02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:20.650]
that's why that line is in the in the bit

[02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:22.670]
it's true he had fat eyelids

[02:05:22.670 --> 02:05:24.150]
and then we got to be a pretty god damn

[02:05:24.150 --> 02:05:25.810]
fat fat eyelids droopy

[02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:28.610]
now here's a fact with all these names on it

[02:05:28.610 --> 02:05:29.730]
and I thought we already were going to put

[02:05:29.730 --> 02:05:31.510]
sunny fox on there I don't mean to sound

[02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:32.730]
offensive or disrespectful

[02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:35.370]
but if you walk in the control of a senior

[02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:38.050]
Roger's it appears as though he should have

[02:05:38.050 --> 02:05:40.070]
wheels on both sides of his chair okay

[02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:41.390]
I mean he's sitting there like

[02:05:41.390 --> 02:05:45.110]
crouch down he's so forceful in the radio

[02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:47.630]
and he's such a little like if he doesn't have a body

[02:05:47.630 --> 02:05:49.790]
gun but he leaves the radio station good luck to him

[02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:51.930]
what does that mean

[02:05:53.050 --> 02:05:55.170]
that means I'm a defenseless I'm just

[02:05:55.170 --> 02:05:59.750]
a bandit is a run the as one said I'm the softest human being

[02:05:59.750 --> 02:06:01.590]

gave a lower figure on how many sex encounters

[02:11:39.950 --> 02:11:41.550]
they've had if they thought their answer would

[02:11:41.550 --> 02:11:43.170]
become public and a higher one if they thought

[02:11:43.170 --> 02:11:46.190]
they'd be caught lying when the women thought

[02:11:46.190 --> 02:11:47.530]
that they were hooked up to a lie detector

[02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:49.150]

drugs from canada spark us row i want to say it again it's a scam

[02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:59.310]
the so-called seniors coalition is a manufactured lobbying group created by

[02:13:59.310 --> 02:14:02.370]
the drug companies themselves it says it may come as a shock but Canadians

[02:14:02.370 --> 02:14:05.130]
apparently are putting their lives online each time they use prescription

[02:14:05.130 --> 02:14:07.310]
drugs approved by Ottawa this is a natural star

[02:14:08.210 --> 02:14:11.250]
or so millions of americans in more than half of the 50 states are being

[02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:18.730]
blasted the us radio campaign is irresponsible scared tactics by the giant

[02:14:18.730 --> 02:14:23.110]
us pharmaceutical industry in a bid to defeat legislation that would allow

[02:14:23.110 --> 02:14:26.650]
the re-importation of american made drugs from canada and europe a lobby group

[02:14:26.650 --> 02:14:30.030]
calling itself these seniors coalition is questioning the safety of

[02:14:30.030 --> 02:14:32.090]
Canadian and european prescription drugs a

I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:46.270]

[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:46.270]

[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:46.270]

[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:46.270]

[02:26:46.270 --> 02:26:47.670]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:48.310 --> 02:26:48.870]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:50.050 --> 02:26:50.550]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:51.250 --> 02:26:52.450]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:53.190]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.990]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:53.990 --> 02:26:54.690]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:26:54.690 --> 02:26:54.850]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:27:04.170 --> 02:27:09.270]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:27:12.450 --> 02:27:12.450]

[02:27:12.690 --> 02:27:13.370]
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.

[02:27:14.890 --> 02:27:20.610]
We do stand on our way there.

[02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:21.810]
We again man.

[02:27:22.130 --> 02:27:23.370]
Are you speaking French or English?

[02:27:23.370 --> 02:27:31.190]
Because you're being as we, we, we, I, we are, I, we, I, there we go, we, I, you sound like Dan Quayel now, sir, you can't even spell us.

[02:27:31.630 --> 02:27:33.870]
You don't want to ask me to pick on the radio.

[02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:34.390]
Right.

[02:27:35.770 --> 02:27:39.950]
And you know you'd have to have to pick as in we, we, you sound like that baby now.

[02:27:40.450 --> 02:27:44.510]
Are you in Luther? Are you an Ametrecer? I think you've been up an Ametre in the woods with that baby.

[02:27:44.670 --> 02:27:46.070]
You want to admit it now and wait till tomorrow.

[02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:48.070]
Some people don't.

[02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:53.270]
They don't have a clue.

[02:27:54.810 --> 02:28:02.990]
They walk all around with their head up their glutes.

[02:28:05.070 --> 02:28:07.350]
There's always the same.

[02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:11.730]
They're just looking for fame.

[02:28:14.010 --> 02:28:17.330]
And they're lovely of use.

[02:28:18.850 --> 02:28:21.790]
Like the chronic from loose.

[02:28:23.750 --> 02:28:26.470]
These are chronic from loose.

[02:28:31.290 --> 02:28:34.630]
I don't believe it. Look at that girl.

[02:28:35.310 --> 02:28:41.230]
She's a big name beauty who's appeared in movies and you've seen her in the picture show.

[02:28:41.230 --> 02:28:47.930]
Yeah, I saw Ghost Bruce Willis, is her hubby, and she's got a little baby that she brings to the studio.

[02:28:48.290 --> 02:28:54.970]
Right. She makes all kind of toys about all kinds of clothes, but the clothes she doesn't wear.

[02:28:55.730 --> 02:29:01.970]
Are the clothes that are painted on the girl who's naked on the cover of the vanity fair?

[02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:06.230]
Vanity fair, every morning is naked on the cover.

[02:29:06.510 --> 02:29:09.370]
Fair is suit, that's made from watercolor.

[02:29:10.190 --> 02:29:12.810]
Fair is a truth, or is it fair?

[02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:15.710]
On the cover of the vanity fair.

[02:29:16.650 --> 02:29:18.630]
And it's a very, very good thing, John.

[02:29:19.070 --> 02:29:20.390]
I think I'll take a bite.

[02:29:21.370 --> 02:29:27.390]
I got a great big passion for skin type fashion because she's gone out on the limb.

[02:29:28.390 --> 02:29:31.050]
She got a body by her Williams.

[02:29:31.450 --> 02:29:34.090]
And they even put in the trim.

[02:29:34.690 --> 02:29:38.530]
Yeah, she got a pinstrap, pulls a metal pebbles, no with them.

[02:29:38.810 --> 02:29:40.710]
And she's looking so damn awesome.

[02:29:41.970 --> 02:29:47.950]
But you ain't seen nothing like the extra bunnies on the cover of the vanity fair.

[02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:52.150]
Vanity fair, every morning is naked on the cover.

[02:29:52.590 --> 02:29:55.530]
Fair is a truth, that's made from watercolor.

[02:29:55.530 --> 02:29:58.870]
Fair is excuse me if I stare.

[02:29:59.330 --> 02:30:01.930]
And the cover of the vanity fair.

[02:30:02.530 --> 02:30:04.930]
On the cover of the vanity fair.

[02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:07.550]
I'm a poor person naked on the cover.

[02:30:07.890 --> 02:30:10.710]
Fair is a truth, that's made from watercolor.

[02:30:11.070 --> 02:30:12.810]
I'm a poor person naked on the cover.

[02:30:12.810 --> 02:30:17.310]
Fair is a truth, that's made from watercolor.

[02:30:17.310 --> 02:30:19.250]
Boy, that's right. She might do it in a cover man.

[02:30:19.390 --> 02:30:20.810]
Look, she's so beautiful, smiling.

[02:30:21.210 --> 02:30:22.530]
She ain't even pregnant this time.

[02:30:22.530 --> 02:30:25.270]
A million of American shower with Lever 2000.

[02:30:25.650 --> 02:30:28.370]
The body soap, we're all your 2000 touchable parts.

[02:30:28.910 --> 02:30:31.430]
Now there's new Lever 2000 touchable parts.

[02:30:31.810 --> 02:30:33.470]
And your three untouchable parts.

[02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:34.750]
Hey boss, how was your workout?

[02:30:35.010 --> 02:30:39.050]
Rude, you know nothing perched me up in the middle of the day like a quick game of squash in an ice hot shower.

[02:30:39.170 --> 02:30:40.470]
Well you look really refreshed, sir.

[02:30:40.530 --> 02:30:42.630]
And I feel refreshed, thanks to Lever 2003.

[02:30:42.990 --> 02:30:43.830]
Lever 2003.

[02:30:44.050 --> 02:30:46.170]
I knew soup, thanks my 2000 touchable parts.

[02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:47.470]
And my three untouchable parts.

[02:30:47.750 --> 02:30:48.730]
What untouchable parts?

[02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:49.910]
Well my heinous for one.

[02:30:50.210 --> 02:30:52.030]
Why don't I just drop my pants and let you see for yourself?

[02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:52.470]
I'm a sir.

[02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:53.510]
I mean as a whistle, look.

[02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:54.090]
Very nice.

[02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.670]
Don't touch.

[02:30:54.890 --> 02:30:56.390]
No, check out my scrotum.

[02:30:56.450 --> 02:30:57.110]
Your scrotum, sir.

[02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:58.130]
My second untouchable part.

[02:30:58.390 --> 02:30:59.230]
How's that for fresh?

[02:30:59.490 --> 02:31:01.290]
Fresh is a daisy, sir, but don't touch.

[02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:01.910]
You know how to problem.

[02:31:01.950 --> 02:31:02.730]
I knew you wanted it.

[02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:04.070]
I really have to be going, sir.

[02:31:04.190 --> 02:31:05.630]
But you haven't seen my third untouchable part.

[02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:06.250]
Oh, that's okay.

[02:31:06.330 --> 02:31:06.830]
My penis.

[02:31:07.250 --> 02:31:08.490]
Look, but don't touch.

[02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:08.930]
I know, sir.

[02:31:08.970 --> 02:31:09.850]
No, you can step to this one.

[02:31:09.970 --> 02:31:10.990]
No thanks for the guy who's in this.

[02:31:11.110 --> 02:31:11.770]
I really rather not.

[02:31:11.790 --> 02:31:12.530]
Here, give me your hand.

[02:31:12.630 --> 02:31:13.250]
That's it.

[02:31:13.530 --> 02:31:15.290]
You kicked me right in the...

[02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.550]
What?

[02:31:15.870 --> 02:31:16.270]
Sorry, sir.

[02:31:16.270 --> 02:31:17.710]
I didn't mean to scuff your scrotum.

[02:31:18.170 --> 02:31:19.490]
It's only the shoe polish, sir.

[02:31:19.570 --> 02:31:20.490]
It'll wash right out.

[02:31:20.670 --> 02:31:21.270]
Number 2003.

[02:31:22.270 --> 02:31:25.930]
The soak that leaves you feeling so clean, you'll be touching yourself all day long.

[02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:28.450]
Ten after one at five, sixty, nobody came here.

[02:31:28.450 --> 02:31:28.810]
You're right.

[02:31:28.930 --> 02:31:30.410]
I got the list here from people.

[02:31:30.510 --> 02:31:31.490]
Well, we're going to put them all on there.

[02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:32.430]
Might as well put them all on there.

[02:31:32.470 --> 02:31:32.570]
Right?

[02:31:32.670 --> 02:31:33.430]
I'll just pass these along.

[02:31:33.790 --> 02:31:35.990]
Guess who else we didn't put on there?

[02:31:36.370 --> 02:31:37.170]
Ken Maldon would be upset.

[02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:39.790]
Did Ken do a music show on GBS?

[02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:41.470]
Because that's before I came to the market, I believe.

[02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:42.490]
I don't know.

[02:31:42.770 --> 02:31:43.430]
He might be out there.

[02:31:43.970 --> 02:31:45.370]
Carla says, yes, we were talking about it yesterday.

[02:31:45.370 --> 02:31:46.990]
I believe he did, but I can go there.

[02:31:47.150 --> 02:31:49.270]
Okay, well, Ken Maldon is one of my favorite people in the world.

[02:31:49.390 --> 02:31:49.790]
Ken Maldon.

[02:31:49.890 --> 02:31:55.370]
And Arnie Ginsburg, who was at the GBS for about a hundred years, maybe not a hundred, but at least...

[02:31:55.370 --> 02:31:56.250]
Stop thirding, man.

[02:31:56.590 --> 02:31:57.010]
Arnie Ginsburg.

[02:31:57.270 --> 02:31:57.750]
Remember, Arnie...

[02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:59.330]
Not Arnie Ginsburg, Arnie Warren.

[02:32:01.470 --> 02:32:02.910]
Arnie Ginsburg was in Boston.

[02:32:03.050 --> 02:32:04.130]
And you're letting me say these things.

[02:32:04.210 --> 02:32:04.750]
That's what you know.

[02:32:04.850 --> 02:32:04.990]
I know.

[02:32:05.470 --> 02:32:06.190]
Arnie Warren.

[02:32:06.450 --> 02:32:06.690]
Okay.

[02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:11.190]
I apologize to Arnie Ginsburg if he's still alive, because Arnie Warren was a corny old coot.

[02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.590]
Anyway.

[02:32:13.570 --> 02:32:14.330]
I'll be silk.

[02:32:14.330 --> 02:32:15.290]
He should be on there, right?

[02:32:15.730 --> 02:32:15.730]

[02:32:16.430 --> 02:32:16.790]
Dullzim.

[02:32:16.850 --> 02:32:18.510]
And I say, I'm not putting the sports people on there.

[02:32:19.130 --> 02:32:20.910]
Because that's a different category.

[02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:23.050]
We can do a whole separate thing on that someday.

[02:32:23.590 --> 02:32:26.570]
Because this other list, you've got me, you've got a whole bunch of sports people on there.

[02:32:26.610 --> 02:32:27.690]
We're not putting sports in there.

[02:32:27.790 --> 02:32:29.030]
How about Steve Goldstein?

[02:32:30.110 --> 02:32:30.190]
Okay.

[02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:32.070]
Because it is a talk to you, not just the sports player.

[02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.770]
I'll tell you about the place though.

[02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.490]
Yoldi.

[02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:34.390]
Get Yoldi on there.

[02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:36.850]
Castronova, how can you have forgotten him?

[02:32:37.270 --> 02:32:37.570]
Easy.

[02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:38.370]
Ah, yeah.

[02:32:38.650 --> 02:32:39.190]
Yeah, really easy.

[02:32:39.330 --> 02:32:40.070]
Paul Castronova.

[02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:41.050]
And young Ron.

[02:32:41.050 --> 02:32:42.890]
And put young Ron on there separately.

[02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:44.270]
Ron, what's his name, Brewer?

[02:32:44.710 --> 02:32:45.410]
Is that his name?

[02:32:45.570 --> 02:32:45.830]
I don't know.

[02:32:46.030 --> 02:32:46.970]
I don't know, because I don't listen.

[02:32:47.370 --> 02:32:48.050]
Liz Wilde.

[02:32:49.310 --> 02:32:51.250]
And how could we, and this is you.

[02:32:51.430 --> 02:32:52.290]
I blame this on you.

[02:32:52.350 --> 02:32:52.590]
Mm-hmm.

[02:32:52.990 --> 02:32:54.090]
Of all the people to forget.

[02:32:55.210 --> 02:32:55.930]
The sheep.

[02:32:56.010 --> 02:32:58.730]
I crossed my mind, but he was on for like 30 seconds as well.

[02:32:58.810 --> 02:32:59.850]
Ron, you need to better net.

[02:33:00.010 --> 02:33:01.010]
He deserves to be on air.

[02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:03.190]
The element bearers for getting Robi Young.

[02:33:04.190 --> 02:33:05.530]
Robi Young should certainly be on air.

[02:33:05.690 --> 02:33:07.670]
Captain Dave, Dave Capri, needs to be on air.

[02:33:07.690 --> 02:33:09.050]
He wasn't just with me on Zeta.

[02:33:09.930 --> 02:33:10.710]
He was all over the place.

[02:33:10.710 --> 02:33:11.410]
I've been there.

[02:33:11.610 --> 02:33:13.870]
And you'll never believe who I was.

[02:33:14.010 --> 02:33:15.430]
My psychic powers again.

[02:33:15.510 --> 02:33:16.490]
Thanks by the way for Liz Mark.

[02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:19.670]
I was thinking about in the shower this morning.

[02:33:19.670 --> 02:33:20.790]
I have no idea why.

[02:33:21.090 --> 02:33:22.590]
I guess I was thinking of this pole.

[02:33:23.230 --> 02:33:23.310]
Okay.

[02:33:24.610 --> 02:33:25.370]
Debbie Ellis.

[02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:27.070]
Boy was she at Cal.

[02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.850]
Get her on air.

[02:33:28.930 --> 02:33:30.110]
Debbie, I never saw her in my life.

[02:33:30.210 --> 02:33:32.610]
But evidently she was like a little on a porky side.

[02:33:33.570 --> 02:33:34.310]
Speaking of Debbie.

[02:33:34.970 --> 02:33:35.350]
Yes.

[02:33:35.530 --> 02:33:36.350]
I like Joyce Kaufman.

[02:33:37.250 --> 02:33:38.790]
Oh, Joyce Kaufman would be wonderful.

[02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:39.750]
Let's get her on air.

[02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:41.070]
Did you put Norma Kent on her yet?

[02:33:41.850 --> 02:33:43.710]
Well, don't you want to get her all twisted into a knot?

[02:33:44.850 --> 02:33:45.470]
Norma Kent.

You cowardly American individuals have nothing to fear!

[02:42:38.630 --> 02:42:44.670]
That's why leading health experts encourage all Americans to fly to Beijing, China

[02:42:44.670 --> 02:42:49.770]
and lead the doorknob of the restrooms at the local walking clinics.

Puff the match of rapper is on my TV!

[02:43:56.750 --> 02:44:01.770]
No one heard of him before, or his name is Puff Daddy!

[02:44:02.230 --> 02:44:08.350]
I said that's Puff the match of rapper won't be here that long!

[02:44:09.130 --> 02:44:14.190]
Not unless he learns to sing on the right of friggin' song!

[02:44:39.130 --> 02:44:41.930]

The obesity and broadcasting network

Coming up tonight, on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[02:51:13.870 --> 02:51:17.130]
Only one thing rivaled her to look lips of the heart

[02:51:17.130 --> 02:51:20.130]
And that was the total eclipse of her career

[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:22.630]
She was Bonnie Tyler

[02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:26.610]
I think I can do a totally clip so far

[02:51:27.130 --> 02:51:31.030]
As a member of the child growing up in Wales, you couldn't keep me away from the piano

[02:51:31.030 --> 02:51:34.450]
Did you say Wales? Isn't Catherine Zeta Jones from Wales?

[02:51:34.990 --> 02:51:35.850]
I think so

[02:51:35.850 --> 02:51:36.790]
But I...

[02:51:36.790 --> 02:51:38.390]
God, Lord that woman is hot

[02:51:38.390 --> 02:51:40.990]
I mean, when she's pregnant, you just want to do her

[02:51:40.990 --> 02:51:42.170]
Yes, that's fine

[02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.990]
No good thing

[02:51:42.990 --> 02:51:45.370]
Michael Douglas could ever have bagged her if he wasn't famous

[02:51:45.370 --> 02:51:47.390]
I mean, come on, he's like 60 or something

[02:51:47.390 --> 02:51:51.870]
Look, I thought we might discuss my work with Meatloaf songwriter Jim Steinman

[02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:53.190]
Oh, you f***ing...

[02:51:53.190 --> 02:51:56.690]
I'll bet sometimes while he's in bed with her, he's just lying there thinking, holy s***

[02:51:56.690 --> 02:51:58.830]
I am banging Catherine Zeta Jones

[02:51:58.830 --> 02:52:04.810]
Perhaps you'd find my contribution to the Footloose soundtrack worthy of your program

[02:52:07.230 --> 02:52:12.690]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Footloose is great, good for you Catherine

[02:52:12.690 --> 02:52:13.190]
Bonnie

[02:52:13.190 --> 02:52:13.650]
Whenever

[02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:16.190]
Hey, you ever see her around, you know, in Wales?

[02:52:16.510 --> 02:52:19.410]
I'm not interested in Catherine Zeta Jones

[02:52:19.410 --> 02:52:22.190]
Oh, come on, I bet even women want a piece of her

[02:52:22.190 --> 02:52:25.590]
I think she holds tremendous appeal that both sexes

[02:52:25.590 --> 02:52:27.490]
Bloody hell, I'm going away now

[02:52:29.130 --> 02:52:31.430]
Didn't you already do that back in 1985?

[02:52:32.870 --> 02:52:36.070]
Anyway, it's a big juicy, soft and wet look at show business

[02:52:36.070 --> 02:52:37.990]
Tonight, on inside of behind

[02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:45.070]
Spreading like crazy

[02:52:46.890 --> 02:52:49.430]
Spreading mid-chirms

[02:52:49.430 --> 02:52:50.310]
Oi

[02:52:51.190 --> 02:52:53.430]
Soon they'll be buried

[02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:57.190]
And eaten by worms

[02:53:00.190 --> 02:53:02.050]
People don't come together

[02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:06.490]
People they stay apart

[02:53:08.190 --> 02:53:10.190]
Nothing can stop it now

[02:53:10.870 --> 02:53:15.170]
Because we are all scared of stars

[02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:18.530]
Don't go to Asia

[02:53:20.850 --> 02:53:22.850]
Don't go to Hong Kong

[02:53:26.810 --> 02:53:27.490]
Absolutely

[02:53:28.510 --> 02:53:30.930]
If you want to live long

[02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:35.150]
People don't live forever

[02:53:37.450 --> 02:53:39.150]
People must all depart

[02:53:41.550 --> 02:53:44.250]
But no one wants it to happen now

[02:53:45.890 --> 02:53:47.870]
That's why we are scared of stars

[02:53:50.290 --> 02:53:52.090]
People don't come together

[02:53:54.490 --> 02:53:55.870]
People they stay apart

[02:53:58.810 --> 02:54:00.670]
Nothing can stop it now

[02:54:00.670 --> 02:54:02.110]
I filled my tank up

[02:54:02.110 --> 02:54:07.630]
Now as I don't know I'd be helping finance 9-11 by giving money to Unicall or Abacall and the carlie

[02:54:07.630 --> 02:54:09.710]
That's in my life, son, that's not

[02:54:09.710 --> 02:54:12.630]
How's that an hour's paying James Baker's great fees?

[02:54:12.770 --> 02:54:13.970]
I made two to today

[02:54:13.970 --> 02:54:17.330]
How was I to know I was providing bathwater to the Middle East?

[02:54:17.730 --> 02:54:19.450]
Well, that ain't so bad again

[02:54:19.450 --> 02:54:21.830]
Every time you light a marijuana cigarette

[02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:27.770]
You're helping finance run your overlords and breaking a law based on the old movie Refer madness

[02:54:27.770 --> 02:54:29.930]
Let a JoJo on up

[02:54:29.930 --> 02:54:33.470]
Is the schedule of a poor man guide

[02:54:33.470 --> 02:54:35.730]
I just want to help Reaver join

[02:54:35.730 --> 02:54:37.870]
Now I'm white man

[02:54:37.870 --> 02:54:41.950]
You know, I'm the chef of this window

[02:54:43.810 --> 02:54:47.310]
This message paid for by the committee to keep America in the dark ages

[02:54:47.310 --> 02:54:50.250]
Welcome back to this installment that'll moh how it David

[02:54:52.070 --> 02:54:52.910]
Slap me, will you?

[02:54:54.970 --> 02:54:57.030]
Slap me before I have a strong will you?

[02:54:58.410 --> 02:55:01.810]
So, why are you, what's the big idea?

[02:55:02.810 --> 02:55:03.630]
You're cured, Mo

[02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.870]
You're dead

[02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:06.910]
I'll give you a shot, pedal, you're here

[02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:09.010]
Now let's go to the halls

[02:55:09.010 --> 02:55:12.270]
No rose pot behind the abandoned pithy pride, hello

[02:55:12.270 --> 02:55:13.170]
Oh yeah, hi Mo

[02:55:13.170 --> 02:55:15.110]
Yeah, what do you know what you're saying?

[02:55:15.430 --> 02:55:17.170]
I just want to tell you I love your show

[02:55:17.170 --> 02:55:18.890]
Right, thank you

[02:55:18.890 --> 02:55:20.910]
And if you've seen my dead beaver

[02:55:21.450 --> 02:55:22.790]
What dead beaver?

[02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:25.210]
The one that's glued to your head

[02:55:41.090 --> 02:55:43.330]
Alright, Mr. David, you're supposed to leave

[02:55:43.330 --> 02:55:44.030]
What a hell of a yo

[02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:46.990]
We'd be here to end the third of the win

[02:55:47.950 --> 02:55:48.750]
Wait, wait

[02:55:49.310 --> 02:55:51.830]
Why I'll have you know I once had lunch with wit missiles

[02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:55.270]
Hey, what are you doing?

[02:55:56.090 --> 02:55:57.010]
Get your hair off me

[02:55:57.010 --> 02:55:58.690]
You can do this the easy way to hold me

[02:55:58.690 --> 02:56:01.310]
What do you think you are? You know who I am?

[02:56:02.170 --> 02:56:03.770]
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[02:56:03.770 --> 02:56:05.550]
I don't push me here

[02:56:05.550 --> 02:56:06.610]
And I'll move your peg

[02:56:06.610 --> 02:56:08.910]
Hell yeah, you'll move your peg

[02:56:10.090 --> 02:56:10.650]
Oh

[02:56:10.650 --> 02:56:11.850]
What can you do?

[02:56:12.030 --> 02:56:13.290]
Send them over me, please

[02:56:13.290 --> 02:56:15.030]
You can't wrap them down

[02:56:15.030 --> 02:56:16.710]
And tonight

[02:56:18.210 --> 02:56:19.550]
Hey, hey you

[02:56:19.550 --> 02:56:20.370]
What's that?

[02:56:20.810 --> 02:56:21.610]
What the wood plank?

[02:56:22.110 --> 02:56:23.870]
Oh, what's that?

[02:56:24.270 --> 02:56:25.730]
Oh, oh

[02:56:25.730 --> 02:56:26.970]
Oh, what the hell?

[02:56:28.190 --> 02:56:29.190]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:56:29.190 --> 02:56:31.990]
Oh, oh, oh

[02:56:31.990 --> 02:56:34.290]
See, my brush is tingling

[02:56:35.170 --> 02:56:36.930]
Now I know how that giansk has looked

[02:56:36.930 --> 02:56:37.510]
Ooh

[02:56:37.510 --> 02:56:37.890]
Ooh

[02:56:37.890 --> 02:56:38.530]
Ooh

[02:56:46.410 --> 02:56:48.850]
20 til two at five, 60, WDQ

[02:56:48.850 --> 02:56:51.910]
And we got the double digit giders on the pole so far

[02:56:51.910 --> 02:56:53.570]
Bob lasted at ten

[02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:55.230]
Aside from me at the best all time

[02:56:55.230 --> 02:56:56.950]
Sound Florida Radio personality Is or was

[02:56:56.950 --> 02:56:58.890]
Bill Carter 12, Joey Reynolds 14

[02:56:58.890 --> 02:57:00.310]
Scott Farrell 19

[02:57:01.290 --> 02:57:07.110]
Hankelberg 21, Ricky Tickie Shaw 24, Reneerie 26, Rick Riley 28, Sutsculeman 32.

[02:57:07.930 --> 02:57:13.070]
You feel better now? Yeah much. Randy Rose 44, Jim Manage 68.

[02:57:13.230 --> 02:57:13.670]
Oh right!

[02:57:14.490 --> 02:57:20.310]
George Rodriguez 76, and Phil Henry 174, just running away from the pack when he used to be a good guy.

[02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:23.950]
Hey we got some exciting news. This isn't just the usual commercial for him,

[02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:28.090]
we'll coast about the grape of faye and all the great natural stuff without any MSG

[02:57:28.090 --> 02:57:31.550]
and any cornstarch and any crap in it and all the cholesterol free rolls that they cook with.

[02:57:31.690 --> 02:57:36.870]
But there's a rumor going around that they're going to be having karaoke nights and Tuesday night haven't you heard that?

[02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:40.350]
It might not be every Tuesday night, we're still searching for the deal.

[02:57:40.370 --> 02:57:44.210]
Well at any rate we want to be the first ones to put it out there just so you don't call it be caught off guard

[02:57:45.450 --> 02:57:51.230]
and promising and threatening to be singing if those karaoke nights materialize that our most cost is Duff Lindsay!

[02:57:51.230 --> 02:57:52.710]
Oh! Worth the drive.

[02:57:53.170 --> 02:57:55.990]
Worth the drive from anywhere that's going to be in the sunrise location of course.

[02:57:56.330 --> 02:58:00.950]
There are three emerald coasts, not only are they in sunrise but they're north Miami Beach and Pembroke Pines as well.

[02:58:01.350 --> 02:58:05.670]
And what about faye this is? Not just your ordinary pedestrian but it's like walking into a sea of food you nearly get lost

[02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:07.450]
there's so much fresh delicious goodies.

[02:58:07.790 --> 02:58:12.290]
Six different soups, dozens of succulent entrees including your strip made your order at the gourmet center

[02:58:12.290 --> 02:58:17.730]
that sizzling Asian grill featuring grilled shrimp scampi style, jumbo scallops wrapped in bacon and the new seafoods

[02:58:17.730 --> 02:58:23.770]
and some Chinese jacquat, dunginess crab and ginger and scallions, hand-carb, pre-mixed, new oriental chicken salad and so much more.

[02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:27.570]
The buffet features a full salad bar, there's a suci bar and fresh room cocktail too.

[02:58:27.950 --> 02:58:32.690]
And if you have by some miracle, a little bit of room at the end, stuff some dessert in your mouth or in your pants because it's outstanding.

[02:58:32.870 --> 02:58:37.910]
The dessert bar features pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings, fresh fruit as well.

[02:58:38.310 --> 02:58:41.590]
You'll find them in sunrise, pineapple and a forty-fourth street, Duff Lindsay coming there soon,

[02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:47.650]
Collins Avenue just north of 163rd North Miami Beach and at the end of 6th of Flamingo and Pemberg Grotes in prestigious Pemberg Pines.

[02:58:48.070 --> 02:58:51.670]
Take your family or a book your next business luncheon right now, all-size parties are welcome.

[02:58:51.830 --> 02:58:56.630]
Let the folks at the Emelco's do all the work in cooking for you and make delicious feast available to you and don't forget

[02:58:56.630 --> 02:59:01.450]
take on the liver you're available to call 9-5-4-572-3822.

[02:59:01.570 --> 02:59:10.510]
What's that number again? 9-5-4-572-3822 and keep your eye and your shrimp peeled for Duff Lindsay coming soon to the Emelco's Chinese buffet.

[02:59:10.510 --> 02:59:17.750]
5-6-6-6-6-8, the regular your family, you am!

[02:59:19.950 --> 02:59:20.510]
Yo!

[02:59:24.210 --> 02:59:28.430]
Oh, what's the problem officer? The ploy from the vehicle.

[02:59:28.750 --> 02:59:30.470]
Quick watch, 11 bullets in the air!

[02:59:31.070 --> 02:59:36.110]
If you're God-driving without a seat belt, you will be removed from your car and shot.

[02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:41.570]
The police now have the authority to enforce seat belt safety under the new Patriot Act 2.

[02:59:41.990 --> 02:59:45.650]
The new law is an effect now, so click it or be shot.

[02:59:46.390 --> 02:59:49.730]
Officers don't like doing this, they are only following orders.

[02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:53.730]
It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight against terrorism.

[02:59:54.250 --> 03:00:01.130]
Terrorists act such as mouth noise, purpose and fighting that could be annoying to others.

[03:00:01.130 --> 03:00:05.230]
So under Patriot Act 2, eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:10.090]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot.

[03:00:11.070 --> 03:00:12.490]
It's the law.

[03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:14.930]
We like saying that.

[03:00:15.190 --> 03:00:15.690]
The law.

[03:00:16.210 --> 03:00:17.130]
The law.

[03:00:20.290 --> 03:00:21.370]
It's the law.

[03:00:33.670 --> 03:00:36.010]
It's for the time.

[03:00:36.090 --> 03:00:38.050]
It's for the time.

[03:00:38.470 --> 03:00:40.230]
It's for the time.

[03:00:40.650 --> 03:00:42.350]
It's for the time.

[03:00:42.390 --> 03:00:42.390]

[03:00:42.930 --> 03:00:44.550]
It's for the time.

[03:00:45.010 --> 03:00:46.690]
It's for the time.

[03:00:47.150 --> 03:00:48.870]
It's for the time.

[03:00:49.330 --> 03:00:51.050]
It's for the time.

[03:00:51.270 --> 03:00:54.250]
The law of children, welcome to the Asher's Terrorist kindergarten.

[03:00:54.770 --> 03:00:55.670]
You know what that means?

[03:00:56.050 --> 03:00:56.890]
It's for the time.

[03:00:57.450 --> 03:00:58.450]
That's right.

[03:00:58.450 --> 03:01:00.130]
And what do we want to be?

[03:01:00.310 --> 03:01:01.510]
We want to be partners.

[03:01:02.310 --> 03:01:03.410]
And how do we do this?

[03:01:03.690 --> 03:01:07.390]
You know what our hero is?

[03:01:07.390 --> 03:01:07.530]
You know what our hero is?

[03:01:07.530 --> 03:01:08.750]
You know what our hero is?

[03:01:08.850 --> 03:01:10.870]
You know what our hero is?

[03:01:11.310 --> 03:01:15.570]
You know what we fund our activities with money from Southampton saying,

[03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:18.790]
I'm your heavy amuse at a bar, the Black Rim America.

[03:01:19.330 --> 03:01:21.490]
Junior, do we want peace with Israel?

[03:01:21.850 --> 03:01:24.730]
No, we want to kill them and drive them into the sea.

[03:01:24.730 --> 03:01:25.990]
They're good children.

[03:01:26.210 --> 03:01:27.410]
No stress on your bones.

[03:01:54.730 --> 03:01:55.210]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:56.470]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:58.150]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:01:58.350 --> 03:01:58.770]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:01:59.050 --> 03:02:00.330]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:00.470 --> 03:02:00.650]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:00.670 --> 03:02:00.910]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:01.490 --> 03:02:02.310]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:02.530 --> 03:02:02.890]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:03.030 --> 03:02:03.910]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:04.890 --> 03:02:08.550]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:11.170]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:11.850 --> 03:02:17.130]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:20.930 --> 03:02:22.730]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:25.890]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:26.210 --> 03:02:26.650]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:26.650 --> 03:02:26.650]

[03:02:26.650 --> 03:02:26.650]

[03:02:26.650 --> 03:02:26.810]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:26.810 --> 03:02:30.490]
No one!

[03:02:30.770 --> 03:02:30.950]
No one!

[03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:31.010]
I'm a bad boy.

[03:02:31.270 --> 03:02:43.130]
When you want us, you'll just convince our하는 lives next.

[03:02:45.610 --> 03:02:46.330]
We'll have fun.

[03:02:46.330 --> 03:02:52.710]
100 years fairy, 100 years, a thousand years while we're still blind,

[03:02:52.710 --> 03:02:52.710]

[03:02:54.810 --> 03:02:57.350]
Well, build their boy toys around.

[03:03:00.710 --> 03:03:04.290]
First, there was Calvin Klein's obsession.

[03:03:05.170 --> 03:03:07.750]
Then, Elizabeth Taylor's passion.

[03:03:08.670 --> 03:03:16.510]
Now comes an exciting new fragrance inspired by America's number one television star.

[03:03:18.150 --> 03:03:22.070]
Introducing Horse and Bals derriere.

[03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:23.750]
Hey, gals.

[03:03:24.090 --> 03:03:28.450]
You know, women like you and me are never gonna look like Liz Taylor.

[03:03:29.130 --> 03:03:31.470]
So why should we smell like her?

[03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:33.590]
Just do what I do.

[03:03:34.610 --> 03:03:40.550]
Splash some of this junk on until you're studying often to kiss your dairy.

[03:03:41.270 --> 03:03:46.490]
Imagine how you'll feel with horse and bals derriere.

[03:03:49.470 --> 03:03:55.090]
There's nothing bigger than my dairy hair.

[03:03:55.430 --> 03:03:56.810]
Dairy hair.

[03:03:57.370 --> 03:04:00.330]
Just look for the huge pink can.

[03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:03.270]
New from Estelao Book.

[03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:09.510]
Here's Ricardo Motobom and the Chrysler New Yorker.

[03:04:09.510 --> 03:04:16.210]
This luxurious automobile has always delivered the performance you'd expect from a New Yorker.

[03:04:16.530 --> 03:04:25.670]
And now Chrysler introduces an onboard microprocessor which even speaks to you just like a New Yorker.

[03:04:25.710 --> 03:04:30.190]
Hey, moron. You wanna put on your f***ed seat belt or what you're about to eat just steering wheel, eh?

[03:04:30.430 --> 03:04:34.590]
Ah, yes. This is truly a New Yorker.

[03:04:34.590 --> 03:04:37.930]
Hey, genius. You see that's the f***ing headlights on.

[03:04:38.270 --> 03:04:39.870]
Jeez. You want dumbass?

[03:04:40.210 --> 03:04:40.870]
Oh, you know that.

[03:04:41.010 --> 03:04:46.270]
And for the most dangerous city in the world, a security system second to none.

[03:04:46.810 --> 03:04:49.390]
Hey, bagel braids. You wanna lock the f***ing doors?

[03:04:49.770 --> 03:04:53.050]
Or maybe we should put a f***ing sign in the f***ing window since Rip me off.

[03:04:53.190 --> 03:04:55.350]
Yes, the Chrysler New Yorker.

[03:04:55.770 --> 03:04:58.890]
If you can find a better luxury car, buy it.

[03:04:59.350 --> 03:05:02.670]
Ah, buy this, dip s***. I got your luxury right here.

[03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:04.470]
You know, Rosanne made a mistake in it a bit.

[03:05:05.070 --> 03:05:07.390]
That's what she said she would never look like Liz Taylor.

[03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:16.690]
Yeah. See if you wait long enough, 152 at 560 WQM we got the Mandolk coming up at 2 o'clock to a Humper or Hank Goldberg for the 7th of big.

[03:05:17.070 --> 03:05:17.290]

Absolutely.

He'll be solo at the A.M. before.

[03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:31.570]

[03:06:44.030 --> 03:06:44.490]
Hey, mister.

[03:06:45.050 --> 03:06:46.090]
Mister mouse.

[03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:49.790]
What the hell are you doing to me?

[03:06:50.550 --> 03:06:51.710]
What do you mean, sir?

[03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:53.370]
Why am I reading in the paper?

[03:06:53.570 --> 03:06:55.910]
You're going to put a Disney theme park in Brooklyn?

[03:06:56.430 --> 03:06:58.230]
Sir, we're just scouting locations.

[03:06:58.750 --> 03:07:02.210]
Jesus, I'm scouting CEOs. You are killing me.

[03:07:02.750 --> 03:07:06.470]
But sir, who we've done with New York City Times Square, bringing back in street.

[03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:07.110]
Hang on.

[03:07:08.230 --> 03:07:08.630]
Bring it.

[03:07:09.690 --> 03:07:10.450]
Bring it.

[03:07:13.290 --> 03:07:15.250]
Get the blue bird out of here.

[03:07:15.310 --> 03:07:16.030]
Okay, boss.

[03:07:16.950 --> 03:07:17.970]
Eisner, book, sir.

[03:07:18.090 --> 03:07:19.590]
Look what we've done with Midtown Manhattan.

[03:07:19.850 --> 03:07:21.470]
40 Seconds Street is incredible.

[03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:25.370]
I don't know what, publicly, I supported that, but you took all the porn away.

[03:07:25.490 --> 03:07:26.090]
You're killing me.

[03:07:26.250 --> 03:07:27.970]
I'm going through a gabboscom like kids.

[03:07:28.450 --> 03:07:31.210]
We're just scouting areas calm down.

[03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:32.350]
Listen to me, but much.

[03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:33.670]
Don't tell me to calm down.

[03:07:33.910 --> 03:07:36.590]
We got lucky with Lee Loan's stage, $128 million.

[03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:39.570]
Now, you're trying to ruin the whole network.

[03:07:39.570 --> 03:07:41.730]
What kind of programming are you running?

[03:07:43.030 --> 03:07:44.530]
Hang on a minute.

[03:07:44.650 --> 03:07:46.750]
Three months.

[03:07:47.330 --> 03:07:50.790]
Yes, the blue bird crap all over your shoulder.

[03:07:51.650 --> 03:07:53.950]
Bring yourself up for heaven's sake.

[03:07:55.370 --> 03:07:57.150]
And head off the module, cleaner.

[03:07:57.370 --> 03:07:58.210]
Okay, boss.

[03:07:58.750 --> 03:07:59.690]
Look, God.

[03:08:00.230 --> 03:08:01.990]
Sir, the network is fine.

[03:08:02.070 --> 03:08:03.830]
Why couldn't you come up with American Idol?

[03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:06.790]
Good God, you're still running James Bobmovie.

[03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:08.670]
There's 60 years old.

[03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:11.810]
Why don't you just put James Bobmov willing on to be done with it?

[03:08:12.070 --> 03:08:14.270]
Lee Tha'ai make a couple of damn dollars.

[03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:16.950]
Well, the movie division's fine.

[03:08:17.310 --> 03:08:18.730]
You mentioned we were in Stitchin' now.

[03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:21.810]
We have the new M Night Shummel on movie coming out later this summer.

[03:08:21.910 --> 03:08:22.790]
Oh, I know. Signs.

[03:08:22.830 --> 03:08:25.550]
What the hell does that mean? Stop sign, yield sign.

[03:08:26.110 --> 03:08:28.710]
You've got to start swinging some of these titles past me.

[03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.630]
Please.

[03:08:30.150 --> 03:08:31.730]
Oh, what's that?

[03:08:32.470 --> 03:08:32.950]
Remus.

[03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:35.030]
Remus.

[03:08:37.250 --> 03:08:38.990]
I know you can't hear me.

[03:08:39.390 --> 03:08:39.830]
Remus.

[03:08:40.230 --> 03:08:42.090]
You're still running on the back of the planet.

[03:08:42.570 --> 03:08:43.710]
You're done, Bobmo.

[03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:44.750]
You're running on the back of the planet.

[03:08:44.810 --> 03:08:46.010]
Get out of here, Remus.

[03:08:46.230 --> 03:08:47.710]
And take that blue bird with you.

[03:08:48.090 --> 03:08:49.450]
All right.

[03:08:49.910 --> 03:08:50.350]
Hi, sir.

[03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:51.590]
Yes, sir.

[03:08:51.630 --> 03:08:54.170]
I'd be very careful the next time I started my car.

[03:08:54.330 --> 03:08:54.810]
Why were you?

[03:08:55.090 --> 03:08:56.170]
What do you mean, sir?

[03:08:56.170 --> 03:08:56.990]
I'm not done with you.

[03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.350]
What?

[03:08:57.610 --> 03:08:59.030]
I've done what, sir.

[03:08:59.110 --> 03:09:00.770]
I'll put Hannah Starr in your job.

[03:09:01.090 --> 03:09:01.370]
What, sir?

[03:09:01.470 --> 03:09:02.610]
You're not terrible.

[03:09:02.930 --> 03:09:03.270]
I'm sorry.

[03:09:03.270 --> 03:09:05.130]
Maybe I'll put Remus in there.

[03:09:05.210 --> 03:09:07.730]
I don't want to be president of Disney Remus.

[03:09:08.150 --> 03:09:09.190]
Oh, man.

[03:09:09.490 --> 03:09:10.830]
What a wonderful day.

[03:09:11.230 --> 03:09:12.770]
Get out of here, you nutbag.

[03:09:13.270 --> 03:09:14.870]
No, will you call that stuff, man?

[03:09:15.010 --> 03:09:16.910]
Bobmo, can you get that mess out my face?

[03:09:17.270 --> 03:09:17.470]
Damn.

[03:09:17.990 --> 03:09:18.910]
Give it to Mikey, man.

[03:09:19.050 --> 03:09:19.910]
He hate everything.

[03:09:21.930 --> 03:09:23.550]
Oh, save it. It's not too bad.

[03:09:24.310 --> 03:09:25.370]
He likes it.

[03:09:25.570 --> 03:09:26.370]
Hey, Mikey.

[03:09:26.890 --> 03:09:28.310]
My ties in fact,

[03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:30.670]
and you put a ship in my helmet.

[03:09:30.670 --> 03:09:34.230]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:09:34.230 --> 03:09:37.990]
Now I'm gonna get gas and get everything you wanted.

[03:09:38.430 --> 03:09:41.930]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:09:41.970 --> 03:09:45.370]
In three years, has he become a wolf sea?

[03:09:45.670 --> 03:09:49.110]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:51.950]
The first thing that he did is go out and get some.

[03:09:52.150 --> 03:09:52.410]
Yeah.

[03:09:52.910 --> 03:09:56.470]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:59.450]
Hey, now all of his is mentioned.

[03:10:00.510 --> 03:10:03.150]
Hey, he's up on the wolf incentives.

[03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:07.150]
In the ring, he's gonna look to deck ya.

[03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:10.970]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:10:11.050 --> 03:10:14.430]
Just stand here, cause he'll be rest facing mecha.

[03:10:14.770 --> 03:10:18.290]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:10:18.350 --> 03:10:19.290]
Hey, I am Mike.

[03:10:19.570 --> 03:10:21.590]
Get your big hand off our assets.

[03:10:22.050 --> 03:10:25.350]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:10:25.350 --> 03:10:26.510]
That's so happy, cute.

[03:10:26.730 --> 03:10:28.870]
But we won't go for your passive.

[03:10:28.870 --> 03:10:32.810]
All along, all along my tights and bad.

[03:10:33.330 --> 03:10:36.010]
Now if you're into pinching tails,

[03:10:36.890 --> 03:10:39.490]
Hey, every thought she's gotta bear.

[03:10:40.190 --> 03:10:43.930]
We thought in jail that you might try to get out.

[03:10:45.250 --> 03:10:45.690]
Out.

[03:10:47.250 --> 03:10:50.090]
You'd make a real cute miss like USA.

[03:10:51.330 --> 03:10:51.330]

[03:10:54.190 --> 03:10:57.630]
That ties the back and he's for and comes to play.

[03:10:57.630 --> 03:10:58.730]
Bye, bye, bye.

[03:10:59.130 --> 03:11:02.310]
The rest you showed on Clips and Knew Q&A.

[03:11:02.330 --> 03:11:04.110]
My name is for my name's Hardy.

[03:11:07.030 --> 03:11:08.030]
Yeah, absolutely.
