[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.920]
He's dirty.

[00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:01.760]
Dirty, dirty, dirty.

[00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.060]
Harry, Calla, Hanni is back.

[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.460]
And now he's passing out flowers and airports.

[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.320]
Hey, pal.

[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.900]
You wanna buy a carnation for your lady friend?

[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.540]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.620]
Uh, no thanks.

[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.620]
Come on, pal.

[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.160]
Make my day.

[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.800]
Uh-huh.

[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.380]
Okay.

[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:19.000]
Ah!

[00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.880]
Clarity's wood is dirty, Harry.

[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.740]
Krishna.

[00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.860]
You know, in all his excitement, I don't know if I sold you six flowers or only five.

[00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.860]
But seeing as how Krishna is the most powerful being in the whole universe, and he blew all my hair clean off.

[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.920]
You gotta ask yourself one question.

[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.840]
So what's that?

[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.980]
You're like my orange smock.

[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.680]
We'll do ya, punk.

[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.520]
Clarity's wood.

[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.000]
It's just me, smithing westerner, and McDowell Lama.

[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580]
He is dirty, Harry, Krishna.

[00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.380]
Now chanting at an airport near you.

[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.300]
902560WQ, what a great poll George took yesterday.

[00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.120]
Oh, I guess, uh, did you mention that I gave that to the TV trailer and over again.

[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.580]
Carla said you never mentioned it even once.

[00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.620]
He says a lot of things.

[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.200]
Never mentioned it once.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.220]
That's okay.

[00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.260]
Look at all the response George had on his nifty poll yesterday.

[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.680]
Oh!

[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.680]
Because I did come in here thinking I was gonna work.

[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.620]
I have to be crazy.

[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.440]
I have to be nuts because-

[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.360]
Your heart is dirty.

[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.700]
Right.

[00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.940]
Now it's been all day, I stay six hours.

[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.680]
Over at the Cleveland Clinic.

[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.980]
Thanks to, uh, I'm a big bush fan now, I should mention.

[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.720]
That's Dr. Bush, not George W.

[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.940]
Thanks, Doc.

[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.420]
And they put me upside down and backward and inside out into my my side in a stress test in the-

[00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.900]
Do you ever see, uh, do you ever do that?

[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.080]
I've seen the procedures like on the news.

[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.080]
Where you not only see your heart beating, but you actually hear, you know, the attorney audio off.

[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.180]
And then it was just, like that once.

[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.100]
Oh my god.

[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.740]
I thought I was having a fart attack.

[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.980]
But after all of that, after six hours of that, I, he said-

[00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:55.920]
Your heart is dirty.

[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.840]
But it's in good shape and you're okay and get out of here.

[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.720]
How do you like that?

[00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.760]
Very good.

[00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.860]
I like it.

[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.360]
I'm not in good shape because it was something else which I told you, but you know, a minor thing.

[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.840]
Yeah.

[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.480]
A minor thing which we won't discuss because I don't want to go to my mother's for lunch today, have her say,

[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.340]
You're wearing pants that are two sizes too small.

[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.740]
I spent six hours laying on this thing with a gown on, okay?

[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.180]
And not the usual lovely gown that I'd be expected to wear.

[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.920]
But just one of those medical gowns with the ass-

[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.920]
I get home three o'clock and sure enough she had called.

[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.960]
Be sure and call as soon as I get home.

[00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.800]
And I hadn't said five words before it comes out.

[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.180]
You're sick because you're wearing pants that are two sizes too small.

[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.340]
See they didn't start out as hip-

[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.460]
And I said, see it tomorrow, Mom.

[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.340]
Click, click, click, bitch.

[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.180]
Nasty, mean, spirited, evil, doer.

[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.460]
I'll tell you one thing, she ought to be on the list of the evil doers.

[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.280]
You know what?

[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.800]
Okay.

[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.200]
She is.

[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.100]
Got some company for her.

[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.240]
She's on the list with your mom, evil doers.

[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.520]
Just, yeah, because my pants are two tight.

[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.020]
I don't wear the hip-hugger's mom.

[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.160]
There was just coincidentally, maybe she's psychic.

[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.040]
Maybe she knew that piece was going to be on the news last night about the hip-hugger's make you, um,

[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.860]
Your nerve damage and all of a sudden crap.

[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.620]
Damn it.

[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.580]
I like the hip-hugger's.

[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.380]
That's what they said.

[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.420]
Anyway, so I'm okay.

[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.340]
I'm back here again, George.

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.340]
Did a great job yesterday.

[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.360]
I'm sure you're going to get a lot of calls about what a stupendous pool George took.

[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.360]
And that's why I've played Clint Eastwood because he's number one.

[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.700]
Oh!

[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.620]
Which, you know, leaves me, I mean, not that I don't like dirty Harry.

[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.200]
He's okay.

[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.320]
And it's time.

[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.460]
The question was, who is your all-time favorite movie character?

[00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.900]
Well, I forgot to tell you, by the way, that today would be a real good day.

[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.220]
It's like the middle of the week and we got to noon to one comedy hour.

[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.540]
But today, during that hour, be a good time while you're listening in your car to go out and get some duct tape.

[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.340]
And we want bottle water.

[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.780]
And this queen.

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.620]
Batteries.

[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:47.220]
What is it?

[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.760]
This queen.

[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.320]
That's what you tape with the duct tape over your windows.

[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.500]
This queen.

[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.060]
This queen.

[00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.700]
This queen.

[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.200]
This queen ain't going to be doing none of that.

[00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.120]
I'll tell you that right now.

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.740]
Okay.

[00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.520]
I have no idea what you're talking about.

[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.640]
And they showed the thing last night.

[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.520]
I don't want to say we have a lot of illiterate people out there,

[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.260]
but the company that makes one of the, well, I guess it's a brand name.

[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.040]
It's called Duck Tape.

[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.820]
Not Duck Tape.

[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.100]
Right.

[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.120]
You ever seen that?

[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.440]
Yeah.

[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.260]
Duck Tape.

[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.300]
If you get annoyed by the Aflack spots, it's a good thing to have handy.

[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.960]
You just put it around his beak.

[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.060]
And then he'll wet it.

[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.480]
Who is your all-time favorite movie character?

[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.620]
Dirty Heary 84.

[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.840]
Don Corleone is 75.

[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.360]
How, how, how depressing, you know?

[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.760]
I mean, is there any, but then again, you got to keep the age thing in mind.

[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.100]
Right.

[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.400]
And he was middle of the pack for a while there,

[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.540]
at least just Don Corleone number 10 or something like that.

[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.460]
What a disgrace.

[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.680]
What a freak in disgrace.

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.380]
I told you that we had a lot of people out there.

[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.640]
That's why this town is so out of it.

[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.320]
They don't know from the Godfather.

[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.120]
And anybody who don't know from the Godfather, they don't know squat.

[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.220]
Tony Montana from Scarface.

[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.340]
Oh, it's going to take me a long time to go down this pool.

[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:57.720]
He's got 70.

[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.280]
James Bond 69.

[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.480]
Darth Vader 60.

[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.080]
Now, I notice James Bond is like generic, because we just asked character not actor actress right.

[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:08.760]
Darth Vader 60.

[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.560]
Carl Spackler, the groundskeeper, played by Bill Murray and Candy Shack 58.

[00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.360]
Now, the reason you were, you thought it was bogus.

[00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.840]
It's not bogus.

[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.040]
From the beginning, it was like number three for a while way up there.

[00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.760]
Because this audience, like, got to be a QAM.

[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.980]
No, they like Candy Shack.

[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:27.340]
That's their favorite movie.

[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.400]
Don't you understand?

[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.140]
Okay.

[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.920]
Now that you drew me a picture.

[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.840]
Yeah.

[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.560]
It all makes sense.

[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.300]
I'm just telling you, they like Candy Shack.

[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.200]
That's their thing.

[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.820]
I liked it too when I was a teenager.

[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.340]
That's the QAM teenager when I was a child.

[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.240]
Anybody that would call and ask about, you know, the 10-year-old quarterback that's playing in Oklahoma,

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.520]
what kind of movie do you expect they would like?

[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.920]
The natural.

[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.980]
Is that in here?

[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.940]
Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, had 53.

[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.120]
Lieutenant Kilgore played by Robert Duval on Apocalypse Now 50, which I have no idea what that was.

[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.180]
Because I never watched it.

[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.840]
I still got it.

[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.880]
I still got it.

[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.460]
Just fast forward to that one scene.

[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.900]
Indiana Jones 49, Travis Bickel played by Robert De Niro-Taxi, driver 47.

[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.500]
A very scary guy.

[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.160]
Even scarier than Luca Bratzie.

[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.840]
Inspector Kusso, Peter Seller's 39.

[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.120]
Kaiser, I don't know who this is.

[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.540]
It's from the usual suspects.

[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.960]
Kevin Spacy and the usual suspects.

[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.540]
Kaiser Soce, Verma Cent.

[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.340]
Soce?

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.060]
Soce.

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.500]
Soce.

[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.180]
Are you sure you're still on that right?

[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.320]
Soce is Carlos.

[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.000]
No.

[00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.120]
S-O-C-E in Italian, that would be Soce.

[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.320]
Soce.

[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.980]
That would be the Kaiser.

[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.800]
It's like some real hero character.

[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.240]
Hanibal Lecter, sounds the lambs 34.

[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.240]
How could Hanibal Lecter be beaten up by Kaiser Soce?

[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.280]
So we did the movie psychos, he won.

[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.960]
And I'm sure you got this name wrong.

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.020]
Yeah.

[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.900]
Not that I wanted to pick, because it was a great pull.

[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.000]
I got over a thousand votes.

[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:56.940]
It was my poll.

[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.620]
Anyway, Alex Delarge, clockwork orange.

[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.020]
Malcolm McDonald, 32, no, that was not his name.

[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.460]
Alexander Delarge, trust me.

[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.060]
It was?

[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.280]
Alexander Delarge?

[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.880]
I did have a big snake, but it was in his drawers.

[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.480]
Basil.

[00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.020]
Did you have the big snake in his drawer?

[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:10.540]
Remember that?

[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.260]
That one scene he pulled it right out.

[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.840]
In fact, there was another scene he did well.

[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.280]
J, see, I can't, I can't can tie.

[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:18.820]
I know.

[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.920]
J from J and Silent Bob had 24 votes.

[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.920]
Jeff Spicoli, Sean Penn, and Fast Times at Ridgemont Han 25,

[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.380]
which I didn't see that, but I don't remember him.

[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.960]
That's how I'm scared of him.

[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:31.060]

[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.060]
I'm the guy that the star, he makes me nauseous.

[00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.520]
I can't explain that.

[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:34.000]
Let's go!

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.560]
Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart and Cassablanca, 21.

[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:40.580]
Captain Quint, Jaws, 21.

[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.160]
Now how come that Humphrey Bogart character

[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.120]
didn't Captain Quig make it on here?

[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:45.960]
No.

[00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.240]
I talked about it, but...

[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.400]
You have to be Schmittingman.

[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:51.700]
I put enough of those on my own.

[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.420]
Captain Quig with a strawberries didn't make our point.

[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:57.080]
Way better than the Rick, but they were consistent.

[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.440]
Good thing I wasn't here to do this poll yesterday.

[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.500]
I'll finish your results, but let me give you today's poll,

[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.480]
so Eric can make it up.

[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.280]
And I already printed this out here, as much as I want.

[00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:07.180]
As much as I can take.

[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.600]
Hey listen, we're busy doing duct tape, okay?

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:11.880]
And bottled water.

[00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:12.920]
Get ready.

[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:14.340]
Can, sorry.

[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.520]
I don't want to be negative.

[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.400]
I don't want to like pee on the government's parade,

[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.640]
but let me just say this to you.

[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.420]
Because the media naturally, they don't stop and think logically.

[00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.900]
For example, if you live in Onion to New York,

[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.820]
if you live in Ishmeng, Michigan,

[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.660]
if you live in Dubuque, Iowa,

[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.900]
I'd say that the need for duct tape and plastic for your windows

[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.360]
and what was it this, this queen?

[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:41.040]
This queen, yeah.

[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.800]
The need probably is low, but if you live like a major

[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.200]
metropollet in area like New York,

[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:49.740]
Philadelphia, Boston, L.A., Miami,

[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.720]
what else?

[00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.100]
Detroit?

[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.760]
Yeah, they're not going to mess with them.

[00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:56.200]
Chicago?

[00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:56.980]
Chicago?

[00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.480]
Capitalist, serious tower?

[00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.580]
Right, big Washington DC?

[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.800]
Then maybe you ought to go out and buy heavy duty, yeah.

[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.920]
I just find it mind-boggling.

[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:08.820]
And what's even worse is that people are doing it.

[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:09.520]
Oh, I do.

[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.900]
Of course, here in South Florida,

[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.180]
all you've got to do is say,

[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.000]
oh, I can't.

[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.200]
And right away they all run, like storm, rainstorm.

[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.720]
And either that is not a stimulus.

[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.660]
People are out shopping.

[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.280]
That's what it is.

[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:19.540]
That's why they're stimulating the economy.

[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.020]
Although Alan Greenspan says,

[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:21.780]
well, we'll get to that.

[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.700]
Not a good time for a tax cut.

[00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.160]
Hey, Alan.

[00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.300]
I wouldn't start my car alone if I were you these days.

[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.340]
Okay, and I'm saying I get that remote control job.

[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.180]
Don't be making comments like that about not a good time for a tax cut.

[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.540]
10 past nine at five sixty.

[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:38.320]
Oh, here's the poll before I do the break.

[00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.680]
What's your take on the latest bin Laden tape?

[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.160]
It's not him.

[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:45.900]
He's really dead.

[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.360]
All the more reason to attack Iraq now.

[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.460]
Proves that Bush is playing into his hands.

[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.440]
It changes nothing.

[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.720]
Or what, me worry, is our poll today.

[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.020]
Pretty good poll if I say so myself.

[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:01.660]
Five magnificent choices.

[00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.820]
I want you to get panicky.

[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.100]
But a lot of bad crap going on.

[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:08.220]
And what they worried about on ABC.

[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:09.620]
I had a good morning America show.

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.180]
Michael Jackson's nose.

[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.200]
And I don't want you to get nervous about it.

[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.600]
Because Carlos is assured all of us that Michael Jackson is not a pedophile.

[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.980]
So we feel a lot better about that.

[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.680]
Thank the Lord for those little kids who are sharing Michael's bed.

[00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.200]
He just is lonely and likes company.

[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.180]
You're an idiot, Carlos.

[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.480]
You're just, you're pathetic.

[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.240]
That's what happens when you smoke all in faggot.

[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:34.760]
That's why he's going to go for a physical today.

[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.180]
Young man of his age, he's going to go there going to draw blood.

[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.920]
They're going to do all kinds of crap.

[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.740]
Probably stick their finger when his...

[00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.120]
Correct them.

[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.740]
Well, yeah, they do that too.

[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.580]
Look what happened to John Kerry, man.

[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.060]
You can never be too...

[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:46.440]
Right.

[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.460]
To have somebody stick their finger in there and check your prostate.

[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:53.300]
Right, as a matter of fact Joe was just here.

[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.560]
He had some issues with that.

[00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:55.940]
What do you mean by that?

[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:56.920]
He had some issues with it.

[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:57.620]
With his prostate.

[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.180]
He did?

[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.200]
Yeah, like what?

[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.120]
Dr. Prasad, he wasn't milking it often enough.

[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.260]
True story.

[00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:08.760]
You shouldn't have seen the prescription.

[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:11.480]
Come on, it's after 9 at 5.60 WQIM.

[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.980]
Maybe that's why he's going to be a...

[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:14.940]
Treasure Island tonight.

[00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:16.660]
Willie?

[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.660]
No, maybe he'll show up.

[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.420]
What's in here, of course?

[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.060]
Speaking of that, guys, Valentine's Day is this Friday,

[00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.480]
and what women really want us for you to put a little...

[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.840]
...thought and creativity into your gift.

[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.400]
This year, express yourself in a fun and original way,

[00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:29.500]
say it with a Vermont teddy bear.

[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.560]
Just call 1-800-829-Bair.

[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.620]
And a friendly bear, councilable, will help you choose from over 100 bears,

[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.160]
hand-cracked in in Vermont and delivered in a colorful gift box

[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.120]
with free card and chocolate.

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.000]
Tell her she lights your fire with a new Burnin' Love Bear,

[00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.200]
dressed like a hunky fireman,

[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.080]
with Love Tattoo on his arm,

[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.300]
or say I'm wild about you with a younger Love Bear.

[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.640]
They even have bears for her hobby or occupation,

[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.220]
like the prostitute the bear.

[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:53.240]
Setting a Vermont teddy bear is a creative and personal alternative to flowers.

[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.660]
It'll be around long after Valentine's Day to remind her of you.

[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.380]
Send a bear to the office or work homework

[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.120]
so you can see how thoughtful and romantic you are.

[00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:01.800]
overnight in Valentine's Day delivery,

[00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.600]
guaranteed even at this late date.

[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:08.000]
Call 1-800-829-Bair or shop online at VermontTeddyBair.com.

[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.140]
Don't forget to do it right this year.

[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.360]
Say it with a Vermont teddy bear for Valentine's Day.

[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.300]
Be sure and tell them that Dirty Old Neal

[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.360]
toured it to call 1-800-829-BEAR.

[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.480]
That's only my heart by the way that's dirty.

[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.000]
And I'm mine and Lord,

[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.740]
this is sports 20 or 5-6-E.

[00:12:23.940 --> 00:12:24.940]
You way up.

[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:27.800]
Don't have a penis.

[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.600]
Well congratulations, get a life.

[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:31.680]
Kaboom.

[00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.940]
Look outside on the same day.

[00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.240]
Look outside on the same day.

[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.880]
George Bush has got your name.

[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:42.120]
Look outside on the same day.

[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.560]
He says we know.

[00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:43.840]
No.

[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.380]
We know just what you're doing.

[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.240]
Look outside on the same day.

[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.800]
You've been a very naughty boy.

[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.500]
You're a very naughty boy.

[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.180]
You're a bunch of new.

[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.720]
Oh, side of him he'll get you.

[00:12:57.180 --> 00:12:58.480]
He'll get you.

[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.820]
He's got some missiles pointed at you.

[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.360]
And he'd love to bomb me right here.

[00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:09.120]
Back into the middle ages.

[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.080]
He's loved you.

[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.520]
He loved you, loved you, loved you, loved you.

[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.220]
George W. is the president.

[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:17.900]
He is the president.

[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.960]
Congress wants him to explain.

[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.560]
They say what do you think you're doing?

[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.900]
What do you think you're doing?

[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:29.760]
He says we're going to take him out.

[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:31.540]
We're going to take him out.

[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.820]
Look at this new, same bomb.

[00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:36.680]
Side of me, loved you.

[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.580]
He loved you.

[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.860]
You're shooting a bunch of missiles at you.

[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.720]
Yeah, he loved you, loved you, loved you.

[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.020]
He loved you, loved you, loved you.

[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:45.240]
Uh-huh.

[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:49.100]
Back into the middle ages.

[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.280]
He loved you.

[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:50.960]
Yeah.

[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.400]
He loved you, loved you, loved you, loved you.

[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.040]
He loved you, loved you, loved you.

[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:57.860]
917-562-WQ-A.

[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.460]
Here's a fact from John and Craig Corwell.

[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.680]
I'm sure he's a wonderful guy and a real dedicated listener.

[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.860]
But, it says I hope you're feeling better.

[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.980]
The start of a career at New York Times.

[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.300]
I'm at the Estatica L'Enjoy.

[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.200]
The Wimps of War by Paul Krugman.

[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.280]
John, thank you very much.

[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.400]
But that was on our website yesterday, one of our bedtime stories.

[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:13.720]
Yeah.

[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:15.960]
Which I brought in.

[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.540]
And it's a damn good thing I do bring him.

[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.400]
And you want to know why because our equipment here

[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.520]
our internet connection, everything here is screwed up.

[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.500]
It's really a piece of crap.

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.220]
It's a crap shoot.

[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:27.260]
Yeah.

[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.480]
But Joe Costello is not the one that screwed things up.

[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:30.840]
He came in and told us that this morning,

[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:33.080]
while he and Carlos were giving us a lecture

[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.760]
about how Michael Jackson is not a pedophile.

[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.900]
And we feel very, very sorry for him.

[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.100]
I feel sorry for us.

[00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:39.700]
That ABC News.

[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.140]
I mean, the price of gas is what?

[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.520]
About $75 a gallon now.

[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.860]
Not that they're exploiting this situation, you understand.

[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.540]
And we got the latest audio tape from Osama Yomama allegedly.

[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.680]
And we got the terror attack that may take place

[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.840]
as early as some time at the end of this week.

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:57.840]
At the S in this week.

[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.020]
And what am I missing?

[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.840]
Oh, and Chicago got all this ground on Academy Award nomination.

[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.100]
Right.

[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.520]
And we're worrying about Michael Jackson's nomination.

[00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:09.220]
Oh, that's for no reason.

[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:10.660]
Right. That's why I just said.

[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:12.500]
I would just say, I thought.

[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.680]
Well, I thought you were talking about the band.

[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.060]
You're going to start with that again with Peter Seterra.

[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:17.860]
He has a wife, you know?

[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:19.120]
Okay.

[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:19.480]
Let's see.

[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.500]
The new poll is up there already before I get back to yesterday's video.

[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.160]
We're getting away ahead of ourselves, which is good,

[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.880]
because we got that pain in the ass noon to one hour,

[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.660]
which really breaks our heart.

[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.140]
Then I got to go to lunch at mommy's today.

[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.600]
Maybe she can let out my pants.

[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.580]
I'm not making that story up here.

[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:37.040]
I know.

[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.260]
This is the same woman when I had a stroke years ago, 12 years ago.

[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.540]
Was that my house taken care of my dogs?

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.380]
I had to force my way out of the hospital, drove myself home.

[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.460]
And the first thing that she says to me,

[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:51.400]
I got that pain in the ass noon to one hour,

[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.180]
which really breaks our heart.

[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.640]
And then I got to go to lunch at mommy's today.

[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.660]
Maybe she can let out my.

[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.760]
I like how she knows it for 20 years.

[00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.920]
He's a great actor.

[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.860]
I just disliked the fact that he kept plugging that

[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.740]
Trish Vandervere because he was married to her.

[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.100]
And she was like 15.

[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.560]
He was plugged in a lot.

[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:07.400]
He was plugged in a lot.

[00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.180]
Fletch, Chevy Chase, 15.

[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.660]
Jewels Winfield, Samuel L Jackson and Pulp Fiction,

[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.840]
which again, this audience has an obsession with Pulp Fiction,

[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.540]
because they've been told it's a really good movie,

[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.460]
even though it's just 15.

[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.980]
Khan, Ricardo Mothelbond, and Star Trek 2, 13.

[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.200]
John Torrance, Jack Nicholson, and the shining 13.

[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.460]
I mean, here's Johnny.

[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.200]
Igor, and young Frankenstein.

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.340]
That could be Marty Feldman, could it?

[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:31.500]
Yes.

[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:31.860]
12.

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:34.480]
Tommy, Joe Pesci and Goodfellas 12.

[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.880]
See, again, I mean, he was good.

[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:39.700]
Yeah.

[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.200]
But I thought Robert and I were even better in Goodfellas.

[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:42.460]
Right?

[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.480]
Yeah, over there.

[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.300]
Right down there.

[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.300]
Right down there.

[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.680]
But they liked him because of that.

[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.860]
He didn't want to use...

[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:49.860]
He didn't want to dress...

[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:50.660]
That's what I'm saying.

[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:51.760]
They liked the wise guy.

[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:51.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.060]
That's the male audience out there.

[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:55.460]
They liked the wise guy stuff.

[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.340]
They don't like...

[00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.920]
There was a lot of wise guys in the godfather.

[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.200]
They didn't get it.

[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:01.800]
If somebody was saying, hey, these are much of wise guys,

[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:02.860]
they would like to better, I guess.

[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.160]
Fenced through, but played by Benicio Adeltero

[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.480]
unusual suspects, didn't see it.

[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:07.740]
12.

[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:08.940]
It was all right.

[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.840]
Dr. Evil, Austin Powers, only 11?

[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:11.720]
How's that possible?

[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.740]
I don't know.

[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:13.500]
Yeah.

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.660]
Fletch was way up on the list.

[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:15.920]
Oh.

[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.400]
Down there.

[00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.240]
Billy Jack, 10.

[00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:19.800]
Do you know what that sound I just make?

[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.640]
I said it like Mrs. Wallace on passions.

[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.260]
Oh.

[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:22.760]
Betty.

[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:26.140]
And by the way, Betty, you're not getting me, uh, Louise.

[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.200]
That scene just goes, that guy to call the other day, he's right.

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:31.100]
Goes on and on and on.

[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.140]
And Beth is standing in the corner, Eve's dropping,

[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.100]
and Louise's insured and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.700]
Oh, I can't live without you, but you have to.

[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.140]
No, how long?

[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.160]
And there's Beth.

[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:39.660]
Oh, goody.

[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.300]
Oh, crap.

[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:41.680]
Billy Jack, 10.

[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:43.640]
Mad Max, 9.

[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.120]
How about Billy Jean speaking to Michael Jackson?

[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:48.400]
What movie was he in?

[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.240]
Billy Jean.

[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.340]
Don't you remember Billy Jean?

[00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:51.540]

[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:52.600]
And?

[00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.340]
And?

[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.860]
Do you think that was a great movie?

[00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:55.940]
Don't you remember Bing's?

[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.340]
Oh, the Legend of Billy Jean.

[00:17:58.940 --> 00:17:59.760]
The Legend of Billy.

[00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.040]
What happened to you, yes?

[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.300]
There was only out of here one day.

[00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:03.840]
What happened?

[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.420]
It's nothing.

[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.460]
Lots of drugs after the show.

[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:05.940]
I see.

[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.480]
When I told him it was going to do the show,

[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.600]
he started popping all kinds of pills.

[00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:11.640]
Red ones and yellow ones and blue ones.

[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.700]
Green ones.

[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:13.440]
Brown ones.

[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.160]
A Mad Max 9.

[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.060]
Neo from Matrix 9.

[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.160]
Bull Meacham.

[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.740]
Robert Duol and the Great Santini 8.

[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.360]
Now, that's a good choice.

[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.660]
I'm amazed that this audience,

[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.820]
the same audience that likes catty-checked so much,

[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.060]
picked Bull Meacham.

[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:28.400]
Or even remembered the four calls.

[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.680]
The name of the character had eight votes.

[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:30.880]
That was a good movie.

[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:32.780]
Of course, it had a cult following,

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.420]
which means it was a bomb at the box office,

[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.540]
but it was a damn good movie.

[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.700]
What is it that you're doing with?

[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.220]
What are you, uh, patching around?

[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:39.720]
Log stuff.

[00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.140]
Oh, don't be messin' with a log, mister.

[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:44.680]
Howard Beale from Never Not.

[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.540]
Now, that, of course, was my vote.

[00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:47.660]
Howard Beale.

[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.900]
Now, how come the internet keeps goin' down here, Carlos?

[00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:51.800]
Don't tell me that we're having more problems

[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.040]
with our damn connection again.

[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:54.620]
It is.

[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.100]
It is gone.

[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:55.680]
Huh?

[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.580]
It's completely gone?

[00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.660]
My client, there it is.

[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:00.340]
73 votes.

[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.260]
I'll keep my eye on it.

[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.940]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:04.700]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.080]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:05.660]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.580]
Howard Beale had only eight votes.

[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:08.660]
Now, I'm gonna tell you, seriously.

[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.120]
Okay, maybe I'm the only one who likes that movie.

[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:12.880]
And seven other people.

[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.740]
But if Peter Finch, if that wasn't one of the greatest performances in the history of mankind,

[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.660]
I don't explain to me why.

[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:21.660]
How could you not love that performance?

[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.200]
And the little character.

[00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.980]
A lot of people are having fun here at the same time.

[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:25.400]
You know, a lot of people are having fun here at the same time.

[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:25.700]
Right.

[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:29.440]
Oh, and speaking of bullshit, what's that one movie?

[00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.480]
That was nominated for the Oscars, something Schmidt, what is the name of that movie?

[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.240]
About Schmidt.

[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.060]
About Schmidt.

[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.380]
I never saw a preview of it.

[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:42.920]
About Schmidt.

[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.040]
Isn't that what the show is about?

[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:44.920]
Right.

[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.200]
I guess it's a movie about the show.

[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.940]
It's all about Schmidt.

[00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:48.420]
Man.

[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:49.500]
Howard Beale.

[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:50.940]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:51.880]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:51.940]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:51.960]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.040]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:52.640]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:53.260]
I'm as mad as hell!

[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.060]
Only eight votes.

[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.580]
Moses played by Charlton Heston.

[00:19:57.580 --> 00:19:58.560]
And the tenth command.

[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.180]
I wanted it.

[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.660]
I thought it was Moses, our friend Moses, and it's Charlton Heston.

[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.380]
He would have gotten all those.

[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:03.980]
He would have gotten all those.

[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.180]
He had seven, but a lot of his fans forgot to vote for him.

[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.560]
And I know that was very insensitive.

[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.220]
Sorry, Ronnie.

[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.900]
Buffalo Bill sounds Lam's head only seven.

[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.680]
Raymond Dustin Hoppin and Rayman had six.

[00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.300]
Dr. Frank Inferter from the Rocky Horror Picture Show 6.

[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.560]
Rocky Balboa.

[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.060]
Six.

[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.640]
Well, Stan's Field, Gary Olvin and the Professional Six.

[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.680]
Vincent Vega played by John B. Volton.

[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:26.720]
Pulp Fishing had four.

[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.860]
Also with four Frank Booth and his Hopper and Blue Velvet.

[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.200]
And John Ryder.

[00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.500]
Who played?

[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:36.120]
Who was played by Rucker Howard and a Hitcher had only one vote.

[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.500]
I mean, at least he got the one.

[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.100]
I know.

[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:40.900]
Well, somebody must have called it in, right?

[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.320]
Right.

[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.940]
The guy who invented finger foods and he only got one vote in this poll.

[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.720]
Excellent poll, a mediocre result.

[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.500]
That's all I can tell you.

[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.320]
A little bit disheartened by your result.

[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:53.680]
27 after 9 at 5, 60 W at QAM.

[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.320]
If you're not feeling that great this morning because you didn't get a good night's sleep last night.

[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:03.500]
Now, part of the reason you didn't get a good night's sleep is you're worried about, you know, a bottle of water and duct tape.

[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.000]
And what's the other stuff?

[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:05.480]
This queen.

[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:06.720]
And plastic.

[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.460]
But maybe another part of the reason is your mattress sucks.

[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:12.920]

[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.260]
John Pearlet, the taxi driver.

[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.260]
Drought park.

[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:36.500]
You looked at me so quissically.

[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:38.480]
If I could tell, he was in a dark.

[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:45.220]
So I acted out my puncture in and with my arms the trees I made.

[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:46.180]
There's no buzz.

[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.940]
He speaks English and I'm on a run.

[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:56.180]
I went down to my young man bridge where the weather was nice and sunny.

[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:01.540]
I walked into a liquor store but the guy there talks real funny.

[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:07.200]
I asked him for a pint of Holtium Beamy's ass, not the end of what does that mean.

[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:10.800]
The butter sticks English and I'm all.

[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.160]
That's a cornered derby.

[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.720]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan speak English, Mellig.

[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.620]
Are you think I'll back to Laird?

[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.960]
I came here many years ago to learn my ABC.

[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.440]
I don't say much is grossy is.

[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.780]
I said pretty great.

[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:46.760]
Don't get yourself to a classroom quick here in America now. Stop making this thing.

[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:48.440]
No but I speak English.

[00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:54.820]

[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.980]
Getting a little antsy for baseball season to start at Hermes Day that the other day.

[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:05.580]
7 o'clock should go pan through the majors and the Macarena.

[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.880]
At 7.30 we got the game as Alexi Kovala will be his first game back as a ranger again.

[00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.040]
As their paper balloons up to $400 million they still won't make the playoffs.

[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:20.080]
Eddie Camp to the hockey game from G.A. and Joe and Mark overnight who are messing up our studio night after night.

[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.240]
Joe says he didn't do it.

[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:22.700]
Right.

[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.260]
He said the doctor told me he wasn't doing it.

[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.120]
Orange Alert says this facts.

[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:30.420]
Uncle Bill from Royal Palm Beach.

[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.600]
It says anyone caught sticking their hair pieces in the match.

[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.680]
Potatoes will be forced to do a low rating sports show in Miami.

[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.360]
PS the Carlisle bus driver is always late.

[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.260]
And obviously Bill ain't too happy about that.

[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:42.680]
Hey listen I mean that's what we're here for right?

[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.040]
To take that look at it.

[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:47.880]
I giri conduit for the audience out there in the real world.

[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:54.200]
102 votes on a pool and luckily we're getting you know every once in a while actually comes back on here.

[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.980]
What's your take on the latest bin Laden tape that was released yesterday?

[00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:57.760]
What's your take?

[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.820]
Proves that Bush is playing it was hands 30.

[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.940]
It changes nothing 26.

[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:05.040]
All the more reason to attack Iraq now.

[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.700]
Now 23.

[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.420]
What me worry 16 and it's not him he's really dead.

[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:12.320]
Seven.

[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.620]
How do we know it is him?

[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:24.120]
I mean I realize that they have these experts, these voice recognition experts who analyze the tape like those tapes that we intercepted with the Iraqis talking to each other.

[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:24.540]
Right.

[00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:27.640]
We know that those were real people.

[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:28.980]
Absolutely.

[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.780]
And there's no question about that.

[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.540]
Well what we got on the website today some pretty good stuff.

[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:37.520]
US had hit data hinting of Oklahoma bombing which is very disturbing.

[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.740]
By the way that was under the watch of Bubba.

[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.380]
So all you people all you Bush defenders.

[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.280]
We're not gonna blame him on that one.

[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.820]
This was under the watch of the FBI of course.

[00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.560]
They just don't seem to get the you know they can't get it together.

[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:56.700]
Chicago tops Oscar nominees along with all that Schmidt.

[00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.600]
What is that about Schmidt?

[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:01.560]
Well this one too this is somehow we missed this.

[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:06.280]
Sarasota woman charged with making terrorist threat at airport in Tampa.

[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:12.980]
A 30 year old woman has been charged with telling a screen or a Tampa international airport that she was a terrorist and had a bomb and knife in her luggage.

[00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.880]
The FBI said Monday well at least the FBI got that on the control.

[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:21.640]
Silla S. Zoki S.C.O.K.E. 30 of Sarasota.

[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.620]
Which charged with providing false information regarding the presence of a bomb in a piece of baggage according to the FBI.

[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:34.240]
She was released Monday on $10,000 bond and it says here on the AP there was no telephone listing for Soki in Sarasota.

[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.240]
She don't have no phone.

[00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:42.740]
Soki was a ticket at passenger's side and then when she told a screener she was a terrorist and had a bomb and knife in her baggage according to the FBI.

[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:47.140]
A day earlier the Bush administration raised the national terror alert for me on the orange which we know that.

[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:47.880]
Orange alert!

[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.360]
Just in case you've been sleeping.

[00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.400]
Case you've been hibernating out of touch.

[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:55.480]
Here's another fact and there's still coming in with the movies by the way.

[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.420]
Which is okay that'll kill some good time.

[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.680]
How about the man with no name?

[00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.540]
Well he did have a name.

[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.160]
Manko, the Clint Eastwood character in the Good Bandai Ugly.

[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.600]
Also a fistful of dollars and a few dollars more.

[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:09.060]
Manko.

[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.420]
Is that Manko?

[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:12.520]
I thought he was in Chicago.

[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.160]
Manko.

[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:13.940]
Do it in the morning shift.

[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:14.200]
Yeah.

[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.340]
I don't have any idea what that's all about.

[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.620]
Well there are Clint Eastwood obsessed.

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.320]
I am a... I like Clint Eastwood.

[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.980]
My favorite Clint Eastwood movie was Play Misty for me.

[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:22.420]
Yeah.

[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:22.900]
That was good.

[00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.920]
I like that better than Dirty Harry but they like Rituit as violence.

[00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:31.600]
They like movies that have a lot of shooting, like health fiction, a lot of dead people, a lot of bodies.

[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:33.360]
A lot of Rituit as violence.

[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.300]
I don't think I didn't like Dirty Harry but I'm not in the same league with Play Misty for me.

[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.460]
He would just like a water or outlaw Josie Wales which had shooting and a good story.

[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:42.840]
Play Misty for me.

[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.560]
Now is... how many times have I seen that?

[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:44.940]
100?

[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:45.620]
At least.

[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.700]
Nobody ever talks about that movie.

[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.000]
That's a little close to home for those of us in Radio Do.

[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.540]
And what about her name?

[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.540]
What that was the name of the character just a broader play?

[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.700]
Somebody will know.

[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:57.500]
Misty.

[00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:58.680]
No.

[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.060]
Poor Earl Garner, he's still dead.

[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:02.800]
He's rolling over in his grave thinking about that.

[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.260]
Play Misty for me.

[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.480]
And of course he had that real...

[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.980]
That the... so many things if you're in Radio about that movie that you love for example.

[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.000]
He didn't... he didn't queue up the record.

[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.840]
He just... he put the needle on the record and we got queued up.

[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:16.260]
Yeah.

[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.520]
Put the needle on the record on the turntable back in the days when we had records.

[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.220]
Ain't that remember that?

[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:20.480]
No.

[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.580]
While us all far it's due.

[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:25.240]
He just... he just reached over, put the needle on the record and bought a bing.

[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.200]
There was like, right off... you know...

[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:27.720]
Like magic.

[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.460]
Like a magic trick by Clint Eastwood.

[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:32.920]
It was just so many phony things.

[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.060]
It was almost as fake.

[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:37.960]
But at least it was a good movie unlike Talk Radio, Eric Bogosian, that piece of rap.

[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.620]
Or the... where the boardop is spinning around like he's like a dreidel in heat.

[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.620]
Like Linda Blair's head on a turntable.

[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:45.640]
Just spinning around.

[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.500]
Throwing carts and... oh, Mr. Cool, man.

[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:50.600]
Mr. Cool.

[00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.140]
Well, at least we didn't confuse it with you.

[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.460]
Here's the fact that it says...

[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.840]
Doesn't it seem that we Americans are getting ready for our next fight when the last one isn't finished?

[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.560]
Iraq didn't blow up the World Trade Center with Al Qaeda.

[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:02.880]
Huh.

[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.700]
When or if we get attacked this week or next, it'll be...

[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.860]
Let's see, now... just because they're saying it's gonna be this week.

[00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:09.660]
Do you believe that?

[00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.640]
No.

[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.140]
In fact, I think every time that they say it's gonna be at a certain time, that makes it less likely that it's gonna be at that time.

[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.500]
But it says...

[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.300]
When or if we get attacked this week, it'll be Al Qaeda.

[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.840]
My concern is that in our need for revenge, after an attack, people become bloodthirsty.

[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:26.740]
Forgetting the real enemy and jumping behind the Bushmeister's war for oil.

[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.760]
Forgetting about bin Laden and the real threat to American safety.

[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:34.120]
Also, I'm the only one that wonders why it is that converts predicted attack, but can't stop on it.

[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:34.960]
Huh.

[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:38.580]
But anyway...

[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.460]
Well, that's a bit, but I'm just happy to be in there.

[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.360]
Nice timing, you'll thank you.

[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.460]
5-6705-60, we like to hear from people that are out there buying duct tape.

[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.060]
Bottled water.

[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.760]
This queen...

[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:50.900]
Right.

[00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.700]
Plastic sheets of plastic.

[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.120]
Don't be spastic. Just go out and get some plastic.

[00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:56.700]
That's what this queen is.

[00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:57.380]
Oh, I see.

[00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:58.520]
Oh, is it really?

[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:58.920]
Yeah.

[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.800]
I never heard of that.

[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.300]
And what do you do with it?

[00:30:01.540 --> 00:30:02.200]
What do you do with it?

[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:02.620]
Oh my god.

[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:04.380]
I was close.

[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.500]
21-10, but I tell you this shows just zooming along here today.

[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:11.140]
Something must have happened here, really good yesterday.

[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.240]
Maybe it was a really good pull.

[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:14.780]
See, yeah.

[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:21.500]
Just consider yourself lucky that by the time I decided I was actually going to go and find out if I was still alive, that I started scratching.

[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.280]
And of course, Georgia's response, much like my mother, was unacceptable.

[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.720]
Oh, I think I've already done that one.

[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.820]
I noticed that didn't prevent you from doing it.

[00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.020]
I didn't say that at all.

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:31.580]
Yes, you did.

[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.740]
I think your head was in a fog.

[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.860]
I said we did psycho villains.

[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.620]
Not the same thing.

[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.220]
The point I was making was that it was not the same.

[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:41.600]
I don't look in Carlos.

[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.560]
Yeah, he's giving you a little evil taste.

[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.680]
He's giving you a little evil dirty look.

[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:47.880]
Well, maybe he's smitten our tight.

[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.420]
I don't know.

[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.980]
20 maybe go over there and work on that show.

[00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:54.200]
Oh, and speaking of that, I was in a car with how they was it.

[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:56.500]
Yesterday, I guess going to the track on Monday night.

[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.840]
Oh, I punched over to the Schmidtmeister as bad.

[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:03.540]
When I say vintage Tampa radio, that's an understatement.

[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:10.700]
That show was so freaking bad and so predictable and so just, and the callers on their mates like, uh, Ditto heads anonymous all over again.

[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:12.520]
Sad.

[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:13.560]
You ever heard that show?

[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.240]
Not a second.

[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.040]
Don't.

[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:15.960]
Don't.

[00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:18.540]
It'll scare the Schmidt audience.

[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.300]
20 to 10 at 560 WQM and guys, I want to tell you definitively they've done all kinds of studies they've determined.

[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.780]
there are some of those are like three minor markets those are three especially

[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:47.180]
c-addle and many apple saint paul

[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.780]
right

[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:50.040]
anyway

[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.300]
bridges

[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.580]
borders just pages of this crap

[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.160]
the coast guard scrambled to search the waters of the

[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:00.920]
san francisco oakland bay bridge before dawn yesterday after a tugboat

[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.100]
operator reported the man wearing a wetsuit which was two sides of two small by

[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.380]
the way was buzzing around in an inflatable boat without lights after an intense

[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:12.120]
search no one was found see this this is and how come we're out here in very

[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:16.120]
much more about those cubans the acube in the defector postcard guys right

[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:20.060]
that will came up on true and a little boat the only thing we're here about it is

[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:23.200]
that one broad it says that the castor government owes her eighty trillion

[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.960]
dollars she's pissed off yet once again the boat right that's all we hear about it

[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:52.540]
and that's all we hear about it

[00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:56.140]
and of course on channel four new so said it's not a couple of

[00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.520]
the status of liberties and ice gift as a parting gift yeah

[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:03.320]
that was like seven million years ago on speaking of that did you see the thing

[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.640]
about the expanding universe yes i did okay

[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.560]
so now they say the universe is like what was it thirteen billion years old

[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:15.800]
right now i just i don't want to put anybody out of spot but how do you rationalize

[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:19.360]
that and of course they asked all of these different experts right scientists

[00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.920]
about life and all these uh...

[00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:24.160]
massive people after the uh...

[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.000]
Columbia blew up

[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.640]
about what they believe in life on other plans and they all said including a lot

[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:30.740]
of the former astronauts yes of course obviously

[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.060]
either now or some other time but no question about it right

[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:38.920]
how do you know how does that rationalize with all this mumbo jumbo in both the

[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.420]
jewish and goysha testaments in the bible that say that the world is five

[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.960]
thousand years old i've gotten very sacred

[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.860]
or saint maybe the other evidence the scientists are satanists the scientists are

[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:54.260]
flooding the world and the things that are made up that the panic why the

[00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.920]
fossils were put there by satan probably on halloween right the readings that

[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.800]
the scientists are getting satan uh-huh okay

[00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.900]
i'll be done everywhere

[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:07.340]

i mean i put that on there but it's just i mean obviously everybody's got

[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:28.740]
opinion

[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.500]

wednesday

[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.740]
alright exactly my sentence precisely

[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.920]
that was Miguel with the uh... treasure island promo

[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:32.420]
i don't know

[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:38.420]
why didn't want to clutter up your reading area

[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.620]
i'm not going to be reading the the the only thing that's sitting behind there is

[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:43.120]
the temperature conversion guide

[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.860]
i don't want to be reading that because uh... you know when it says minus uh...

testing in a weapon was the terrorist a twisted scientist riskate mental patient or could the

[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:39.620]
gasser actually be a figment of people's imagination spread by mass panic as some experts suggested

[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.260]
now don't you think it must be just a coincidence that he was the court he was born or he went to

[00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:51.020]
high school in matune illinois this person of interest and then they're digging him up again

[00:58:51.020 --> 00:59:03.540]
you know this last couple yeah yeah they're resurrecting that old lame thing five six seven

[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:09.020]
i guess a terrorist support vehicle over here at x on about five hundred bucks uh well it was

[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:16.260]
five fifty this week but uh you know i don't understand uh how uh everyone can think that bush

[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:22.580]
is not behind this uh gas price increase i mean if you got x on on a fourth quarter profit posting

[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:28.820]
over four billion dollars i mean how many just did i yes how can they expect us to you know

[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.640]
do anything else but go to war thank the lord that they're not exploiting all these horrendous

[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:36.860]
things that are going on in the possible i mean you know gasses are oils up to thirty five bucks a

[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:40.900]
bill which is very high but they're saying that these price increases aren't in any way justified

[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:45.540]
but it ain't stopping you know i'm saying just in case we have a real trouble with the war and

[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:50.240]
we lose the Iraqi world at center and so on well it's just it's just bushes propaganda war

[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.700]
machine pushing the americans toward war that's all it is okay and i thought i got to say i'll see

[00:59:54.700 --> 01:00:00.660]
it the home depot okay all right this queen that's all you got to say anybody you see they just say

[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:04.360]
that'll look like a code they're speaking in code again

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:13.960]
now it's not the time for tax cuts green span uh says oh he better dump me up i'm telling you right now

[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:19.500]
federal reserve chairman alan green spandard congress yesterday to restrain to refrain to cut it out

[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.660]
no cutting taxes while the threat of war hangs over the economy saying he's not certain the major

[01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:28.840]
physical stimulus is necessary taking emitting a large multi-year deficit projected by president

[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.180]
and bush the central bank chief also made a strong plea for tougher budget discipline he said that

[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:37.600]
any future tax cuts should be budget neutral or essentially offset by spending cuts

[01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.220]
so thank goodness that we got the economy under control

[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:48.620]
that we don't have gas people being raped by the uh oil companies and all of these things

[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.860]
and that the rich people are going to get another tax cut yeah if he has his way what you want

[01:00:53.860 --> 01:01:00.200]
to go through i don't think five six seven oh five sixty pound five six did you see boba on

[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:04.080]
air with lyric king chastising him about you don't need the tax cut and i sure as hell don't need

they're they're busy they're buying gas and uh they're plastic well they must be loaded then

[01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:40.320]
if they're buying gas you think this would be good for us they won't be driving nearly as much

[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:43.520]
because they can't afford to waste all the expensive gas and they got to stay close to home

[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:30.740]

[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:54.820]
although there's a very suspicious looking truck and now they got it over there on the snow

[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.060]
and they got to pull the truck off to the side and there's a big ass tow truck

[01:15:00.620 --> 01:15:05.460]
a big yellow toad just a regular pedestrian tow truck kind of thing like tow pedestrians away

[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.300]
and it's just that that's it there's nothing going on there's like nobody near it now maybe there's

[01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:15.180]
afraid something it was like three blocks from the bridge yeah well maybe maybe it's good they

[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:19.040]
got it before got to the bridge look like it was aiming in the other direction maybe they're like

[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.280]
a bunch of liberals on it which is why they got it on fox news they're going to like tow them away

[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:28.620]
we won't see them again can we go to like a real news network on here instead of that crap oh here's

[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:33.580]
this guy again John Kerry discusses surgery can't it's in PSA is a blood test it's made by the

[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:38.740]
prostate if the cancer has been completely eliminated the PSA test should be undetectable and I

[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:43.600]
would expect it to get to be an old fart like me every year have that PSA test I was 2.9 not

[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:50.000]
two bad senators sometimes it's like 1.9 it kind of like it fluctuates if it gets over 4.0

[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.500]
then you stuck in a little bit concerned if it gets to be really high then you've got to go what

[01:15:53.500 --> 01:16:01.080]
does that actually stand for PSA yeah public service and I do that I don't know see this guy's

[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:04.960]
asking me by track glycerides and you're asking me the what I want to know what those PSA test

[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:11.920]
stand for like an expert name I just picked your own health no but exactly like a picture of

stands for somebody will call in tell us that too I don't know and what and what differences

and make what it stands for you want to be getting ready to post how when you get your blood test

[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.080]
Carlos used to young for that all the way you never know but like after you're like 35 or 40

[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:39.780]
every time you get your blood taken like every year whenever you want to have the PSA test on to

[01:16:39.780 --> 01:16:48.100]
can't hurt that's what John Kerry said 24 11 at 5 60 prostate specific

[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:56.380]
see I have part of it that's what it means I feel better now no no you don't because it doesn't

[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:29.020]
disasters but i would say fatal mistakes as the globe as we look through these tabloids this week

[01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:33.540]
right on the front cover there Columbia tragedy they're last surviving they're last to

[01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:37.200]
terrifying seven minutes inside the shuttle and it's got pictures of course of these streaking

[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:43.460]
all the different pieces of the Columbia zooming across the skyline fatal mistakes how human error

[01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:49.960]
and budget cutbacks led to loss of seven brave souls i think they're ever in their final report

[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:53.280]
gonna actually admit that no even though lots of other people are saying that's what it was

[01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:57.740]
even though even though we had the warnings about the oh rings before the challenger you know

[01:20:57.740 --> 01:21:02.240]
again that ice iceing up business but don't confuse the public with the facts because they like

[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.060]
the hearts and flowers aspect of these stories and the media is very you know that's what they

[01:21:06.060 --> 01:21:11.540]
emphasize on it's just not the right thing to say is that you know we sacrifice seven people and

[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:15.620]
we just basically killed them that's not that's not a good thing to say especially during these

[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:21.740]
trying times five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:28.360]
lady and sunrise hello Neil yes ma'am i'm serious this morning and i just got up i beg your pardon

[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:32.960]
i'm serious this morning well i'm serious too i just got off the phone with my daughter from

north carolina she just returned from Vegas right you know how women change their

[01:21:37.160 --> 01:21:42.200]
purses they use you know different times they have different packets so she emptied out her purse

[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:51.260]
found a pocket knife a silver one yeah yeah that she's been at least on eight on a plane eight times

[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.140]
with a pocket knife in her purse and it went undetected how about the box cutter

[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:00.460]
she said i was glad that she was the one that had the pocket knife

[01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:07.080]
uh-uh-uh-uh makes me feel real safe this is incredible Neil yeah well they put it on a good

[01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:11.080]
dog and pony show for us but it's a look at a smear and i still say when you look at the people

[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.460]
who are doing the checking at the airports forget about it well let's take a look at them

[01:22:16.460 --> 01:22:20.960]
they're supposed to go to australia and now she doesn't want to go she doesn't feel safe on an

[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.940]
international flight well not only that but well of all the places to go why would she want to go to

[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:28.960]
australia well they're on the list they're on the schmittless believe me

[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:34.260]
russ morks through xerox or um not xerox i be him and they're sending him there

[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:41.980]
hmm this summer but she's very skeptical now i mean this is disgusting i just can't believe it i

[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:46.720]
don't fly a lot myself but for the people that are boring these planes thinking they're safe

[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.280]
i never i never thought that i mean i you know because i see the way that they're doing things

[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.200]
and they always seem to pick me out and they check my belt and they check them we take my shoes

[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:59.300]
off and they're looking at practically doing a cavity search i just don't think that and plus

[01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:03.640]
i'm such a regular flyer uh they should they should already have a profile by now they should know

[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:07.960]
that i'm not dangerous to anybody except at the food counter well they stopped algor too remember

[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:14.640]
you're right okay good luck good luck yeah you'll need it so she's not too confident right there

[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:19.120]
that lady a lot of the rest of you folks that fly they get on these commercial flights and you

[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:22.980]
look around at those people the screeners and you say i don't think so and you watch the behavior

[01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:26.580]
you know how they get bogged down talking back and forth and just like that little boat

[01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:31.860]
in San Francisco the little dinghy and it always is like the people in the airport

[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:39.360]
and like they vanish in a thin air maybe it sunk no no seriously i mean how is that possible

[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:44.380]
how is it possible if they're really paying attention if they're really and of course we got to

[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:49.180]
have these big tax cuts so we can't afford the kind of budget we need for real homeland security

[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.660]
that's what it boils down to well we got the patriot act we got homeland security right

[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.380]
five six seven we're not on fox anymore we're back on the other case we're quick talking at cramp

[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:22.300]
going on at Malvo pumpkin that other guy remember that they kept saying that they were in a white

[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:28.040]
trunk and a truck and a white van yeah turn out to be nothing to do that they were in that beat-up

[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.860]
old Chevy should we be calling Rick Stan Chad to cover the thing or what oh he's gonna cover it with

[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:15.460]
public that they're buying it they're buying it we believe you and then again they take this tape

[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.400]
yesterday this uh been a lot of tape and they spin that into something that it certainly doesn't

[01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:24.980]
sound like to anybody but a brain when he's talking about the fact that uh Sodom is a uh

even ask here here it's north Miami hello hello yes sir this is me yes me i wanted your opinion on

[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.000]
the middle east a little something that hasn't brought up in the news um you'd like wait a minute

[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.660]
you'd like my opinion on the middle east no i will the question i'm about to ask you what is your

[01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:26.360]
opinion on all of our content rated troops in one small place as far as um you know being vulnerable

[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.580]
with all those troops and if they do have nuclear capability how come they wouldn't do it right

[01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:35.580]
there and make us look bad and and give us the blame yeah well uh he's already said that whatever

[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:39.320]
capability he's got he's gonna use it if we invade he's got nothing to lose at that point

[01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:44.980]
that's what i'm saying is what if he does it in his own territory takes out a lot of our special

[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:49.120]
special forces troops right that's not bad because everybody else thinks we dropped the bomb

[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:52.420]
and what's gonna have what do we have left for north career by the way that's what yeah

[01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.400]
something to think about and for the fight against terrorism which i thought it was what this

[01:26:56.400 --> 01:27:02.480]
was all about it isn't i thought that's what we were doing is fighting the evil dorsh the real

[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:06.000]
evil dorsh and these other small potatoes that we could like deal with the you know we can keep

[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:09.760]
him under a microscope for years if need be while we're taking care of important business and

[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:14.660]
another thing i don't understand while George tenet is up there a testifying in front of congress

[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:22.980]
from the CIA uh they keep telling us about all these uh al-Qaeda individuals that we have not

[01:27:22.980 --> 01:27:26.860]
uh you know not necessarily sells but these individuals that they're following and monitoring

[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:31.220]
now i realize that they're gonna say well you know if we keep following them they'll lead us to

[01:27:31.220 --> 01:27:35.820]
others and so on but why aren't they in custody right because every time we arrest a bunch of

[01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:42.520]
these people it it disrupts whatever planning that they're doing right right but they're not doing

[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:48.400]
that unless maybe they're not following anybody no well that that's what they're telling us

[01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:53.560]
well i'm convinced in addition to which this morning i start out on the news by saying well

[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:56.900]
there's a whole bunch there maybe hundreds of al-Qaeda operatives in the country that we don't even

[01:27:56.900 --> 01:28:02.080]
we're not even on to yet well surprise is if that is a shocked anybody are you shocked

[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:08.640]

[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:27.600]
Iranian officials have contended that this step has been undertaken to address civilian energy needs

[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.680]
always that Olympia still remain who said that they found out about the orange terror alert uh in

[01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:35.820]
the news media she said the federal government did exactly do a great job in informing the officials

[01:28:35.820 --> 01:28:39.140]
around the country in the 50 states because the people in Maine found out about it through the

[01:28:39.140 --> 01:28:45.380]
news media they heard about it on CNN uh but we do understand we are taking these things seriously

let them all create five sixty-one

[01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:37.100]
so somebody factors mean Molly Ivens great column from my Sunday the only problem with that

[01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:40.680]
causing up to the fringe right the only problem with that is we headed on the website on Monday

[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:44.520]
huh see these people don't understand I appreciate very much them

[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:48.800]
fixing me the stuff but we're on top of it man I'm scouring it

[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:54.100]
and what's on it and another problem is that they're not checking a bedtime stories on our website

[01:32:54.100 --> 01:32:58.080]
which is very depressing to me too they ought to be they ought to be every single day

[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:02.340]
because unlike before when I was wasting all the valuable airtime reading bedtime stories

[01:33:02.340 --> 01:33:07.680]
which the audience obviously does not want at all so I don't have to do that anymore because they're right on our website

[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:12.200]
and you know anybody with a brain if they don't have a computer like that Haitian guy they go out and you know it's the one burrow one

[01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:18.980]
go to the library go to the library go on the internet every day this should be like part of your homework assignment

[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:24.600]

[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:26.780]
we know nothing there's Robert Bird

[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:33.920]
he knows that he just celebrated his three hundred and forty second birthday

[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:38.100]
and he's just barely remembers those days when he used to walk around with those white cheats on

[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.180]
yeah Bobby this world Bobby

[01:33:45.740 --> 01:33:48.280]

[01:33:49.100 --> 01:33:53.120]

[01:34:14.020 --> 01:34:20.640]
birdie not that the news is slanted or tilted is a CNN by the way finally to make sure that that was the same guy that missed

[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:26.780]
uh... pronounce Gary Puckett's name the final part of the resolution clearly said Leon whatever's name there are new

[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:32.220]
material breaches further material breaches mean you know that's how his voice is cracking out he's getting so desperate to put it over

[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:40.140]
as it must then serious consequences will do every member sitting in the council that day and all their

[01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:49.900]
capitals understood that serious consequences meant if Iraq did not take this last chance this last opportunity no more chances you've had it that's it

[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:58.100]

forward was he can walk in part at the same time

[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.480]
but you know you and those days you certainly couldn't say would be very presidential to say he can't walk in

[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.300]
part at the same time he could walk and fall at the same time or like a horse maybe could walk in

[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:41.300]

get a videotape when i had a laugh they were saying yesterday explaining why it was an audience

[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:22.960]
that a videotape it's much easier to smuggle the somewhere a audio tape than a videotape

[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:29.900]
because you know how big those videotapes are the size of our debts those big clunky videotapes

[01:41:29.900 --> 01:41:34.840]
i know what that i'm just being for see i know i'm being for see just like that joke

[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.000]
but this is the mass media for you know just just saying a lot of stupid idiotic things

[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.560]

[01:41:45.260 --> 01:41:51.780]

here's for a lot of day hello hello Neil yes sir yeah i need to two things for you on your pole

[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:34.940]
if not or something you really dead it's applauded by bush just to get America to back them

[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:40.600]
yeah all right so in other words bush made the tape is that what you saying well i'm not saying he

[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:50.280]
made the tape but the administration did yeah well that's one thing that's one way of thinking there

[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:56.660]
it is another thing i don't know he's looking for backing right yeah and what's the other thing

[01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:01.940]
the other thing with the viscreen you need plenty of viscreen and duct tape duct tape the corner

[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:08.540]
gone gets mulliboyle okay great and have a good time have a party i guess he's going to be a treasure

[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:16.380]
I'll let us see it tonight oh boy no that was duct tape we said sir with a deed i think he misunderstood

[01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:22.060]
duct tape you know what this reminds me of i don't want to be a sceptic or cynical or you know

[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:29.620]
not not abide by the word of my government but it's all it's a step away from back during a cold war

[01:43:29.620 --> 01:43:34.880]
when it's a little kid in the school ace to have these instructional films to show us what to do

[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.640]
in the event of a nuclear attack and they would show those and it would show you how to hide under your

[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:46.640]
desk in school you know what i'm saying it's a bomb hide under the desk put your hands over your head

[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.800]
stick one foot up your back of ass because that'll keep you from melting right

[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:58.380]
it's it's one step away from that and of course the obedient masses out there they're going to go

[01:43:58.380 --> 01:44:04.140]
out there and they're not gonna they're doing it they're doing it and i'll say it like i said

[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:07.680]
in the beginning of the show nobody's commented on this but it just makes common sense to me

[01:44:07.680 --> 01:44:11.680]
although that's the story about matunele and oil i mean that's a little bit uh this concerning

[01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:16.380]
even though steven hat fill went to high school there but i don't think if you live in

[01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:24.460]
prokipsi in new york or in el miro or in alby and michigan or in how indiana or in shelby

[01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:32.240]
montana i don't think you're in a lot of danger right right but you never know i mean what are

[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:38.240]
they talking about they're talking about east coast targets primarily the northeast seems to be

[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.740]
what they're emphasizing and you know what we never heard one more word about that white box truck

[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:48.980]
please we never heard another word about it well i was a rocker well we're too busy with showed

[01:44:48.980 --> 01:44:55.680]
on a rack but at any rate uh what what good is it going to do what could it possibly do

[01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:03.000]
to put duct tape on your windows what is that kind of it's like it's like here's a picture of a guy

[01:45:03.560 --> 01:45:07.500]
Pedro Lera an employee of flagrous surplus well see i mean they're just they want to do business

[01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.780]
which is fine more power to him you know who don't want to buy those ugly things anyway

[01:45:11.540 --> 01:45:16.520]
in fact a hundred years ago when my father had an army surplus store uh we used to sell those too

[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:22.500]

[01:45:45.300 --> 01:45:49.720]
that this wouldn't do any good yeah then they tell us that yes shut up oh

[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:56.220]
and smallpox will this will i pretend now of course not

[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.340]

[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:11.800]
yeah feel better just one i just want to question now i need to ask like um just um colon

[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:16.720]
power was showing you the sites that might be potentially um they supposed to have the chemicals

[01:49:17.820 --> 01:49:23.080]
so why don't they send the inspectors in there so he could be sure well you know they say that

[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:27.280]
every time they send them in there that the inspectors go in the front door and they shut the stuff

[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.580]
out the backdoor is what they're saying not not that then quick oh yeah there's no way in the world

[01:49:31.580 --> 01:49:34.660]
i think well not only that but if they really believe that why aren't they giving the information

[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:38.020]
the inspectors in private and not having him go on the year and put it out for the entire world

[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:43.500]
of here see thank you doesn't that make sense yeah yeah unless they broadcast i mean look let's

[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:47.040]
face it we know that they got a bunch of crap because first of all we gave most of it in the

[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:50.960]
first place so we know that they got still a bunch of crap and especially chemical and biological

[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.440]
but we also know that they're not going to say hey here it is and hand it over to us so the

[01:49:55.440 --> 01:50:00.820]
decision we have to make is do they really represent an immediate threat to us and the answer to me is

[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:08.600]
no okay um do you think you think that they do i think that they probably um got rid of it they might

[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.020]
have but i'm not i'm not talking about do they have it i'm talking about this sottah

mousetain and the people of a wreck do they represent an immediate threat against this country now

[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:22.580]

[01:50:22.580 --> 01:50:27.480]
mousetain but we're not oh no that's a big mistake right there um love your show and i hope you

phenomena of mots

[01:53:01.100 --> 01:53:01.480]
communications

[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:01.480]

[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:01.480]

[01:53:01.480 --> 01:53:03.200]
And more haze pants.

[01:53:03.400 --> 01:53:03.860]
Oh, Jordan?

[01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:08.040]
That pipe smokeer ran on psychomsize cute women.

[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:11.780]
Engaging a fake a la d'ethe.

[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:16.680]
I'm a cranky homo foe.

[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:20.660]
Not that I mind it, but I'm way too old.

[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.740]
I fantasize about being in bed.

[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:28.040]
For him, in a twist with feedlers, my man friend.

[01:53:29.020 --> 01:53:31.580]
I'll kiss and make up with Ginger some day.

[01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:35.480]
And then ask him to rape my pun.

[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.200]
Oh, there ain't no over again.

[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:40.320]
I can't stop him.

[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.620]
So I would not feel the most fooling.

[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:45.000]
No!

[01:53:45.420 --> 01:53:52.340]
And I would not be ashamed about a ginger and more gay union.

[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:55.780]
Just bold and then stroken away.

[01:53:56.780 --> 01:53:58.800]
Jesus Christ, boy, wait.

[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:00.540]
Kill me, you're not my type.

[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:04.700]
You sound like a nine-year-old kid.

[01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:08.500]
Only a macho-menly guy.

[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:09.780]
You don't know him.

[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:12.420]
That makes me flip my wig.

[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.400]
And Ginger was a lover of mine.

[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:20.440]
I bury my boldest feigny nose.

[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:24.260]
Inside his pimply rear end.

[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:25.700]
Right, them.

[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:29.540]
No, I would not be a sport home.

[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:29.880]
Now!

[01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:32.920]
If I was not a closet of fame,

[01:54:33.620 --> 01:54:37.020]
That's why a ginger and more gay union

[01:54:37.020 --> 01:54:41.080]
would make me feel giddy at the day.

[01:54:41.940 --> 01:54:43.660]
Everybody follow my thousand balls.

[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.820]
Yeah, ginger and more gay union.

[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:50.260]
Would make my swirl pony hair spill-safes.

[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:51.480]
All right.

[01:54:51.480 --> 01:54:54.720]
If we had a ginger and more gay union,

[01:54:55.640 --> 01:54:58.200]
That he wouldn't have to get me raped.

[01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:00.660]
Number 31 at 560, WDQAM.

[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:03.000]
John Kerry undergoing prostate cancer surgery.

[01:55:03.540 --> 01:55:04.980]
Everything came out very nicely.

[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:05.880]
Okay, there you go.

[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:07.960]
Now, look, that was incredible.

[01:55:08.140 --> 01:55:08.680]
Can you believe that?

[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:09.500]
No.

[01:55:09.800 --> 01:55:12.120]
If I got the manager of touch, I haven't lost it, man.

[01:55:12.240 --> 01:55:12.640]
Amtrak.

[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:13.460]
Yeah, remember that one.

[01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:16.040]
I mean, I was just going to put him on for a minute

[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:17.480]
to make sure everything came out okay.

[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.680]
And he said it all, came out in the end.

[01:55:19.680 --> 01:55:20.540]
Or something like that.

[01:55:20.580 --> 01:55:21.820]
That was a miracle.

[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:22.800]
Let's go home.

[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:24.060]
Couldn't do that again in a million years.

[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:26.220]
I think that deserved the rest of the day off, if you asked me.

[01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:27.780]
That was phenomenal.

[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:29.400]
So I can go home and get my duct tape.

[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:32.300]
Yeah, what are those of us who have to work for living,

[01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:34.100]
even though my hours are fairly limited here,

[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:34.800]
but nevertheless,

[01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.740]
we're going to have to be in these long lines,

[01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:40.040]
and then go over to pubics and get those big jugs

[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.800]
of that nasty bottle of water.

[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.580]
That leeches all the chemicals from the plastic into the water.

[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.400]
Take a case of that.

[01:55:46.500 --> 01:55:47.540]
I like that thing you're out there.

[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.040]
I love what it says,

[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:50.180]
Drinking water.

[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:50.740]
I can't remember.

[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:51.620]
Oh my God.

[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:53.200]
That's in the confuse with flushing water.

[01:55:53.420 --> 01:55:56.100]
Drinking water is opposed to like cesspool water,

[01:55:56.560 --> 01:55:57.600]
septic tank water,

[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.280]
car washing water.

[01:55:59.440 --> 01:55:59.440]

[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.060]
Auto gets some real water.

[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:02.720]
Man.

[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:06.040]
Oh, oh, oh, thank God for South Alcony.

[01:56:06.160 --> 01:56:07.220]
Did we get him unplugged by the way?

[01:56:07.240 --> 01:56:07.740]
Not enough.

[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:09.040]
From smart club.

[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:09.580]
By the way, pasta.

[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:10.820]
And the henley.

[01:56:11.140 --> 01:56:12.900]
Oh, he brought your order a whole bunch of which I can't eat.

[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.960]
And you want to see somebody lose weight in a hurry?

[01:56:15.380 --> 01:56:15.600]
Yeah.

[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.040]
You just take a look at me now in a way

[01:56:17.040 --> 01:56:17.560]
a couple of months.

[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:18.160]
And I'm not joking.

[01:56:18.260 --> 01:56:19.300]
I've said that many times before.

[01:56:19.480 --> 01:56:21.440]
Because this was my last scared.

[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:21.860]
Guest?

[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:22.980]
No, I'm serious.

[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:23.360]
Good.

[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:24.700]
Even Dr. Abush.

[01:56:25.140 --> 01:56:25.980]
The Bush doctor.

[01:56:27.100 --> 01:56:29.100]
He said, look upon this as a good wake up call.

[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:31.920]
And I said, yeah, I've been lying here for three hours already.

[01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:32.940]
How are you going to wake me up?

[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:33.920]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:35.080]
It really is a little pondress.

[01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:36.340]
You lay there with that gown on.

[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.320]
Never been there.

[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:39.660]
You never been in that situation.

[01:56:40.180 --> 01:56:40.420]
You will.

[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.060]
I don't look forward to your drinking.

[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:42.440]
You're looking at me.

[01:56:42.540 --> 01:56:43.620]
Old and decrepit like me.

[01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:45.940]
When you get to be an old fart like me.

[01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:46.040]
Boy.

[01:56:46.500 --> 01:56:47.420]
Look at bringing my own gown.

[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:49.560]
And you're laying there and you feel so helpless, you know?

[01:56:49.940 --> 01:56:50.660]
And that's what they want.

[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.180]
That's the whole idea of the medical profession.

[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:55.840]
It's to make you feel helpless and humiliated with that gown.

[01:56:57.100 --> 01:56:58.120]
Like Dr. Mendelssohn.

[01:56:58.120 --> 01:56:59.100]
I have to say, Chris Duckey.

[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:00.080]
Chris Duckey Mendelssohn is still dead.

[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:01.800]
Anyway, thanks again to South balcony.

[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:03.420]
brought us in some great water the other day.

[01:57:03.720 --> 01:57:04.920]
Smart and final and Henry Lee.

[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:07.320]
Is the adjoin that he works for.

[01:57:07.580 --> 01:57:08.540]
Now, what was the La Romana?

[01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.300]
That's in water.

[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:10.220]
Which I'm drinking right now.

[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:10.940]
What am I looking over there?

[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:13.060]
It's from the ancient Roman spring.

[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:15.360]
And it is really good craft man.

[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:17.200]
I don't know what that pasta was.

[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:18.300]
It was not.

[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.980]
Not only in a rally corn gas.

[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:22.040]
This is corn gas.

[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:22.740]
See.

[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:24.000]
That's right. You don't like corn gas.

[01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:25.140]
It's alright.

[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:25.860]
You know, it's plain.

[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:26.500]
You like plain.

[01:57:26.680 --> 01:57:27.040]
It's kind of like you.

[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:27.860]
It fits in with your personality.

[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:29.520]
Like me on the other hand.

[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.320]
Lots of games.

[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:31.660]
We were out of the regular kind once.

[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.080]
And that's all that was in there.

[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:33.920]
Three-third group on me.

[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:34.520]
The Fesante.

[01:57:34.740 --> 01:57:34.740]

[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.140]
Fesante.

[01:57:35.380 --> 01:57:35.780]
Group on me.

[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:36.640]
Cassetta.

[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:39.420]
Five-six-seven-oh-five-six-dee.

[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.140]
Welcome to our multi-lingual show here.

[01:57:41.260 --> 01:57:42.900]
We're going to have Gilbert Adams against tomorrow.

[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:43.420]
Not.

[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.180]
Talks the hoist.

[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.600]
Here's Miami.

[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:45.940]
Hello.

[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:47.620]
Yes sir.

[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.160]
Hold on.

[01:57:48.900 --> 01:57:50.060]
Okay. Here's your guy that's saying.

[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:51.680]
I thought you were round to the bed maybe.

[01:57:52.100 --> 01:57:52.640]
Oh yeah.

[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:53.800]
Well, kind of man.

[01:57:53.820 --> 01:57:55.460]
I've been trying to reach you for about 40.

[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:57.140]
You're hiding in a cave like Osama.

[01:57:58.360 --> 01:57:59.200]
Osama your mama.

[01:57:59.380 --> 01:57:59.860]
Hey listen.

[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:01.640]
Let me tell you something man.

[01:58:01.640 --> 01:58:01.900]
Your mama.

[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:02.160]
Yeah.

[01:58:02.320 --> 01:58:06.620]
These people are all talking about.

[01:58:06.620 --> 01:58:08.700]
That bush and this and that.

[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:09.120]
Listen.

[01:58:09.340 --> 01:58:09.340]

[01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:11.420]
Well, wait a minute.

[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.200]
I can't remember what I was going to say.

[01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:17.520]
Hey.

[01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:19.080]
Don't be making a face in it.

[01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:20.100]
And he's under a lot of pressure.

[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:20.480]
Okay.

[01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:21.520]
Oh, God.

[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:24.080]
He's sealing up the house big time.

[01:58:26.220 --> 01:58:29.960]
He's going to go out and buy one of them little desks like we used to have in kindergarten.

[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:31.140]
So you can hide under it.

[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.140]
Well, if it works back then it gets a nuclear bomb.

[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.260]
It's yours how it works against a little radiation or something.

[01:58:35.260 --> 01:58:38.440]
A little suitcase bomb when a bomb about Pequina.

[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:39.480]
Right?

[01:58:40.140 --> 01:58:40.800]
You think?

[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:41.660]
Well, little one.

[01:58:42.600 --> 01:58:45.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the 8.

[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:47.320]
I mean, they got everybody so on edge now.

[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:51.440]
It's just it's a wonder that anybody in fact we had a thank the fact that we got any callers here today.

[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:56.500]
We congratulate the audience that having the balls to at least extend your hand as far as the phone.

[01:58:58.580 --> 01:58:59.200]
Here's Davy.

[01:58:59.300 --> 01:58:59.460]
Hello.

[01:59:00.200 --> 01:59:00.920]
I'm crazy.

[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:02.240]
He's still crazy.

[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.260]
Okay, mark it down George.

[01:59:03.260 --> 01:59:04.020]
Still crazy.

[01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:06.360]
Here's Miami Springs.

[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:06.780]
Hello.

[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:07.300]
Morning.

[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.500]
Morning to you.

[01:59:08.540 --> 01:59:09.480]
Yeah, I tell you.

[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:11.080]
You put my line when you talk about that.

[01:59:11.180 --> 01:59:12.100]
That's too an L on the way.

[01:59:12.260 --> 01:59:12.640]
Yeah.

[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:13.100]
Yeah.

[01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:14.340]
That's my mom's home town.

[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:16.840]
Well, how do you like that?

[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:17.180]
Yeah.

[01:59:17.500 --> 01:59:17.580]
Yeah.

[01:59:18.220 --> 01:59:18.720]
Anyway, anyway.

[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:19.300]
No wait a minute.

[01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.300]
I'm a Thune or my tune.

[01:59:20.300 --> 01:59:20.940]
That's a tune.

[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:21.900]
I mean, that's a tune.

[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:22.520]
That's a tune.

[01:59:23.100 --> 01:59:23.700]
I'll be damned.

[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:24.080]
Yeah.

[01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:28.560]
But anyway, yeah, my mom's home town and I mean, that's a she's been gone two and a half years now.

[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:31.420]
But she never told me about this.

[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:34.300]
I mean, when you said about that, that's just a little bit of a mind.

[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:35.660]
Well, maybe she didn't know about it.

[01:59:35.940 --> 01:59:36.380]
Yeah, maybe not.

[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:38.680]
Well, she was 20 at the time and I don't know.

[01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:41.200]
Maybe, you know, well, she might have been called to it.

[01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:41.940]
I'm not sure about it.

[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.120]
She might have been responsible for it so now we can feel safe.

[01:59:44.440 --> 01:59:44.940]
I'm sorry.

[01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:49.040]
I'm sorry for you that she's gone, but there's always a silver lining in every dark cloud and I can find it.

[01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.060]
Yeah, thanks, Neil.

[01:59:50.300 --> 01:59:51.040]
Hey, um, yes.

[01:59:52.220 --> 01:59:53.240]
Well, let me ask you this.

[01:59:53.320 --> 01:59:54.320]
Did she leave you any money?

[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:55.360]
A little bit.

[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:55.880]
Well, I'll see.

[01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:56.360]
There you go.

[01:59:57.440 --> 01:59:59.060]
So that was in the National Aquar.

[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:00.460]
Which one?

[02:00:00.920 --> 02:00:02.880]
Oh, I mean, the Matt Tumantunia.

[02:00:02.940 --> 02:00:02.980]
Yeah.

[02:00:03.020 --> 02:00:04.460]
It's in the February 18th.

[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:07.220]
The one with a big fat, huge picture of Rosie on the cover.

[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.420]
Yeah, I'm a fat.

[02:00:08.720 --> 02:00:09.880]
Yeah, huge, 310 pounds.

[02:00:10.140 --> 02:00:11.140]
Yeah, I'm going to go right out by that.

[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:13.780]
In fact, I'm sure that's my brother's in my sister's nephew.

[02:00:14.060 --> 02:00:14.420]
Blow their mind.

[02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:15.020]
Okay.

[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:15.880]
Okay, thanks, Neil.

[02:00:15.880 --> 02:00:16.960]
Good luck to you.

[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:18.140]
Now, why do you always make a face?

[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:19.340]
He just talks too fast.

[02:00:19.340 --> 02:00:20.060]
Oh, what a good guy.

[02:00:20.320 --> 02:00:20.980]
Yes, you do.

[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:21.780]
I was making a point.

[02:00:21.780 --> 02:00:22.380]
You make fun of this.

[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:23.140]
You make fun of this.

[02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:26.260]
The mystery of America's first bio-terrorist attack.

[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.560]
It's on page 8, by the way, sir.

[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:28.280]
And everybody else.

[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:33.460]
Pick it up at your public's while you're buying on your water when you're when you can't get your vis- uh, vis-queen there.

[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:36.740]
You got to go to your hardware store to get your vis-queen.

[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.300]
Home Depot hasn't.

[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:42.520]
That's what I just got to your stand.

[02:00:42.960 --> 02:00:43.560]
It's a hardware.

[02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:45.680]
Whatever the hell it is, you know what I'm talking about.

[02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:46.540]
Lensley lumber.

[02:00:47.020 --> 02:00:48.340]
It may not be open now.

[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:49.700]
One of these days they'll reopen it.

[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.660]
But they got some great specials.

[02:00:50.680 --> 02:00:52.280]
Just then they got some package deals.

[02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:56.700]
It happened 60 years ago during WW2 and it's still unsolved.

[02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:58.840]
The anesthetic prowler is on the loose.

[02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:00.600]
Well, it was on those in Matt Tune Illinois.

[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.160]
How do you like that?

[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:04.240]
Tough game for the Leafs last night.

[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.360]
Lost Edmonton 5-4.

[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:06.180]
Very exciting game.

[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:08.060]
Was three-nothing Edmonton and kept coming back.

[02:01:08.220 --> 02:01:08.720]
Felt short.

[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.620]
Michael Remberg almost tied it up late.

[02:01:10.660 --> 02:01:11.500]
Anybody care about that?

[02:01:11.500 --> 02:01:11.660]
No.

[02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.100]
I do.

[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:14.360]
Leafs have been sold new ownership now.

[02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:16.540]
Not sold actually, but whatever.

[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:18.220]
Nobody cares about these things here.

[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.440]
Just a vacuous place.

[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:21.160]
What do they care?

[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.000]
We keep asking that question day after day, week after week, year after year.

[02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:25.960]
What do they care about?

[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:26.700]
We don't know.

[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.260]
Even today.

[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:28.980]
Look how hard it was.

[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:29.900]
I mean, we got them going now.

[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:31.660]
But it was a battle.

[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:33.840]
Of course, George was on yesterday.

[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:35.540]
But George had a great show yesterday.

[02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:36.240]
Thanks to me.

[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:38.080]
Thanks to you.

[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.720]
I'm leaving on a great topic like that.

[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:41.660]
What was your favorite character from any movie?

[02:01:41.980 --> 02:01:43.600]
That was a damn good pull, if you asked me.

[02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:44.800]
I wish they'd love it to save that for today.

[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:46.060]
And I'd give it to a punk like you.

[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:47.280]
That was a great pull.

[02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:48.980]
I mean, a pull today is like, I don't know.

[02:01:49.200 --> 02:01:50.500]
I felt compelled to do it.

[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:51.040]
Right.

[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:54.540]
The one tomorrow, the one that ducked me for tomorrow, and will be even better, though.

[02:01:55.580 --> 02:01:55.860]
Yeah.

[02:01:56.140 --> 02:01:57.680]
Oh, you were supposed to tell me during the break, and you forgot.

[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:02.040]
Oh, well, the pull he suggests is, and I don't want to add on any suggestions today.

[02:02:02.180 --> 02:02:03.120]
Keep it in mind, okay?

[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:09.380]
What person would you rather die than have sex with?

[02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:09.820]
Ooh.

[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:12.480]
Good luck.

[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:15.480]
What person would you rather see?

[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:16.520]
He phrased it better than I did.

[02:02:16.660 --> 02:02:17.240]
I wrote it down.

[02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:18.760]
Write it down.

[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:20.060]
Come on, you silly old fart.

[02:02:20.240 --> 02:02:21.200]
We only got a four-hour show.

[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.320]
I'd rather hear it as, yeah, good wording, though.

[02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:27.120]
He'd said, I'd rather drop dead than have sex with blank.

[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:27.880]
Okay?

[02:02:28.700 --> 02:02:29.800]
I'm going to save that for tomorrow.

[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:30.740]
Don't be throwing it away.

[02:02:30.740 --> 02:02:32.980]
People coming in a Schmidt can't all my stuff here.

[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:34.760]
Because that's what the show is about.

[02:02:34.840 --> 02:02:35.400]
It's about Schmidt.

[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:37.180]
Is that really the name of the movie?

[02:02:37.740 --> 02:02:38.300]
About Schmidt.

[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:42.360]
I love it.

[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.920]
Isn't that what life is becoming all about?

[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:45.860]
It's about Schmidt lately.

[02:02:46.740 --> 02:02:47.720]
Here's Fort Lauderdale.

[02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:48.000]
Hello.

[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:49.880]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:50.300]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:50.860 --> 02:02:55.920]
Yeah, this is from probably unrequited sources, but it says,

[02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:59.920]
Bush and High Racking Officials in his administration are

[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.580]
a tech to big tech and big this queen.

[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:09.800]
Too many at a cheap phone, you know what?

[02:03:09.980 --> 02:03:11.260]
Maybe the president can get you a good one.

[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:14.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:17.260]
Also, anyway, they took out Bob Graham's very important.

[02:03:17.300 --> 02:03:18.280]
Put them on hold, whoever that is.

[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:19.020]
Very important point.

[02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:21.640]
Oh, that's all ecstatic because we're doing this pool tomorrow.

[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:23.400]
Very important point.

[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:28.880]
George, they took out John Kerry's prostate.

[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:29.380]
Right.

[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.540]
They took out Bob Graham's heart.

[02:03:34.820 --> 02:03:35.540]
Dick Gebhardt?

[02:03:35.540 --> 02:03:35.880]
Yeah.

[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.280]
What are they going to take out on him?

[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:38.160]
Anyway, don't answer.

[02:03:38.340 --> 02:03:39.180]
Just think about it.

[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:40.460]
Think about it.

[02:03:41.500 --> 02:03:41.920]
I'll find it.

[02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:43.900]
Oh, there's both of Brown with that nice fedora that he's got.

[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.980]
Oh, the chicken neck is really sticking out.

[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:47.400]
This is what they were doing to him in there.

[02:03:48.460 --> 02:03:49.340]
I can only imagine.

[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:50.280]
Look, they hook him up a lot.

[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.260]
It looks to me like they stretched it a little bit.

[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:52.940]
And the neck too.

[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:53.920]
Look at that.

[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:55.100]
Here's the strap in the door chair.

[02:03:55.220 --> 02:03:55.880]
Do you lose more weight?

[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:57.580]
Yeah, he did.

[02:03:57.800 --> 02:03:58.100]
Why?

[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:00.140]
What do you want to do?

[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:00.980]
Slip under the door?

[02:04:01.980 --> 02:04:03.820]
He looks like a pencil like Geek now, don't he?

[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:05.020]
You look bad.

[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:05.600]
He looks great.

[02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:07.240]
No, he does not look great.

[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:07.840]
He weighs about what?

[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:09.540]
85 pounds now soaking wet?

[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:10.880]
Look at that neck.

[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:12.300]
That's what happens.

[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:15.720]
You get a bit of a waddle going when you do a weight.

[02:04:15.720 --> 02:04:16.540]
He looks like now.

[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.960]
I think he's doing this to get it me now.

[02:04:18.220 --> 02:04:22.120]
He looks like a shorter, not quite so old version of my father with a head.

[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.260]
Oh, it's all by design.

[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:24.940]
And he's dead.

[02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:26.820]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:27.600]
Don't take it personal.

[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:28.400]
He's dead.

[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:31.020]
Of course, he did lift a 90, but he was still a prick.

[02:04:32.100 --> 02:04:34.940]
19 till noon at 5.60 WDQM for years.

[02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.140]
I've been telling you about the health benefits of olio-med.

[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:39.080]
And I keep telling you because this stuff works.

[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:39.680]
I don't even like that.

[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:42.640]
Olio-med soft gels contain pharmaceutical rate olive oil,

[02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:44.180]
not ordinary olive oil, but the best.

[02:04:44.220 --> 02:04:46.620]
It's super concentrated and loaded with health benefits.

[02:04:47.220 --> 02:04:49.300]
Olio-med, every day, can produce the risk of heart disease

[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:50.460]
and high cholesterol too.

[02:04:50.460 --> 02:04:53.540]
Plus, there are 14 different olio-med formulas to choose from.

[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:56.200]
Each one combines pharmaceutical rate olive oil with vitamins,

[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.380]
minerals, and herbals to support specific health needs

[02:04:58.380 --> 02:05:00.560]
from bones to blood pressure to the immune system.

[02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:02.720]
Just choose the formulas that are right for you.

[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.720]
And now there are three new olio-med formulas.

[02:05:05.140 --> 02:05:07.820]
Want to help your sleep, want to help you control your weight, and...

[02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:09.200]
Selk, what does that say?

[02:05:09.440 --> 02:05:09.960]
That's not right.

[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:10.860]
CoQ10.

[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:12.360]
Oh, who wrote this?

[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:13.120]
And it's from...

[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:14.060]
Oh, I'm so sad.

[02:05:14.260 --> 02:05:14.900]
I want to kill myself.

[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:17.580]
CoQ10, I should know, because I take it every day,

[02:05:17.580 --> 02:05:18.360]
and it's great for your heart.

[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:21.520]
Look, I got a good squeeze, my doctor told me yesterday, and we will too.

[02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:23.180]
You'll find olio-med all over town.

[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:24.780]
Pick some up today at public records, wall greens,

[02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.860]

[02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:46.060]
The radio's all yours now.

[02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:51.820]
Bang in the butt, honey.

[02:05:51.880 --> 02:05:55.060]
We'll have more of the stupid dependence of the...

[02:05:55.060 --> 02:05:55.880]
Oh, how would it be with you?

[02:05:56.240 --> 02:06:00.200]
That is so void from our friends at the memory-low center.

[02:06:01.980 --> 02:06:05.940]
Our friends at the memory-low center...

[02:06:05.940 --> 02:06:09.080]
Oh, my God.

[02:06:10.760 --> 02:06:11.740]
What the hell was I doing?

[02:06:12.220 --> 02:06:12.540]
Dad!

[02:06:14.420 --> 02:06:17.080]
You laugh at that tacky fat blimp.

[02:06:17.740 --> 02:06:21.440]
You who I am, how may you make fun of me?

[02:06:21.900 --> 02:06:24.980]
Why I'll have you know, I'm the...

[02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:27.480]
The door's open.

[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:29.480]
The door's open.

[02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.360]
Oh, your teeth are out.

[02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:33.600]
Your teeth are out.

[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:35.860]
Oh, the door's open.

[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:36.680]
The door's open.

[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:37.380]
Oh, my God.

[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:41.240]
The door's open.

[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:44.040]
All right, Jack, you're fired.

[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:44.960]
Get out.

[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:46.200]
Just get out, Dad.

[02:06:46.760 --> 02:06:47.820]
Never mind that.

[02:06:48.240 --> 02:06:48.940]
Get out!

[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:50.740]
You're fired!

[02:06:51.160 --> 02:06:52.800]
Get out!

[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:54.480]
Watch your teeth.

[02:06:54.960 --> 02:06:56.780]
Oh, my boy.

[02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:58.340]
That's it.

[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:00.680]
I'll show that old bastard.

[02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.240]
I think that I screwed rock.

[02:07:03.240 --> 02:07:07.400]
They should do this, drumbelly, and pull the mug with the arms.

[02:07:07.720 --> 02:07:08.940]
Got it, hit the screen.

[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:09.720]
You!

[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:11.640]
Get back in there, truckin' do what I say.

[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:12.240]
See?

[02:07:12.780 --> 02:07:13.760]
All right, now drive.

[02:07:14.340 --> 02:07:14.600]
See?

[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.740]
Just shut up and get drivein'.

[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:18.680]
Back and forth and front of the station.

[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:19.240]
See?

[02:07:20.300 --> 02:07:21.020]
Need I ask?

[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:22.000]
What you like to do?

[02:07:22.340 --> 02:07:23.240]
I'm changing the sign.

[02:07:23.740 --> 02:07:24.900]
I got R-11 somehow.

[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:26.780]
There.

[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:28.400]
Free mammal grams?

[02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:29.520]
Sure.

[02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:30.840]
Then all the broads gotta do.

[02:07:30.840 --> 02:07:32.920]
There's a lot of them babies right up here in the window.

[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:35.040]
And we perform a public service.

[02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:36.760]
We are being flagged down.

[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:37.640]
Oh, God.

[02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:39.740]
Hey, new kids.

[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:40.480]
Get outta here.

[02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.000]
They're saying a nice green truck no more.

[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.220]
I gon' get your mother.

[02:07:43.780 --> 02:07:45.820]
Uh-oh, that police are the coming.

[02:07:46.420 --> 02:07:46.720]
Hold up.

[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:47.500]
It's right, I forgot.

[02:07:48.100 --> 02:07:49.460]
This is its illegal.

[02:07:49.820 --> 02:07:50.980]
Quick drive back to the station.

[02:07:51.100 --> 02:07:52.460]
Most should be walking out right about now.

[02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:53.040]
See?

[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.760]
There it is.

[02:07:55.940 --> 02:07:56.580]
Come here, kiddo.

[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:57.920]
Hey, Mom.

[02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:57.920]

[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:58.960]
Hey, Mom.

[02:07:59.180 --> 02:08:00.020]
Hey, Mom.

[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:01.740]
Hey, Mom.

[02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:02.060]
How you doing?

[02:08:02.060 --> 02:08:02.340]
I'm getting ready.

[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.260]
I'm just gonna pop over there.

[02:08:03.420 --> 02:08:03.460]
I'm just gonna pop over there.

[02:08:03.460 --> 02:08:04.000]
You'll catch me.

[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.480]
You're not my son now.

[02:08:05.860 --> 02:08:07.220]
You'll blast it down.

[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:08.380]
Get out of my pants.

[02:08:09.220 --> 02:08:09.940]
Hey, Mom.

[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:11.940]
No, no, no, no.

[02:08:12.460 --> 02:08:13.520]
That's rape and mold.

[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.640]
No, no, no, no.

[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:19.360]
No, no, no, no, no.

[02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:20.940]
No, no, no, no.

[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:20.940]

[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:23.560]
Number 48 at 560 WQM.

[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:25.960]
Here's a hostile fax from Joy who was faxing yesterday

[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:29.960]
with the slightly changed hand ready. Bush keeps winning his way in spite of all

[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:34.420]
your bush basures. You never offer alternatives only skepticism, which is wrong.

[02:08:35.060 --> 02:08:38.700]
While Bush is doing something to spread democracy in the Middle East, you

[02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:42.360]
want to appease and then encourages the herbs to cut the one democracy in the

[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:48.460]
region Israel down to size. You following that? Sounds like a bunch of stuff in

[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:54.400]
nonsense. Exactly. All I can say to that is five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:59.700]
sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, how

[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:04.080]
you doing? Okay. I was going to hide out in Tarmina for until things cooled off.

[02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:12.720]
But maybe Costa Rica sounds better. I don't know why you go to Michigan. Ann Arbor has the

[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:18.740]
biggest mosque in the country. Don't forget about Detroit Dearborn. That's right. I'm not going

[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:23.140]
here. I don't know and I'm afraid that when we uncover some more things that

[02:09:23.140 --> 02:09:26.080]
are fingerprints from the French and the Germans are going to be all over

[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.380]
everything. I just don't think it's being pacifist. I think there's more to it. The

[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:35.000]
fingerprints of the French and the Germans. Yep. When they get done shredding

[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:39.960]
all that chemical warfare information that's written in French and German. Yeah. Maybe

[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.580]
the French and German will join us. Okay. Whatever you say. You follow what he was saying.

[02:09:44.700 --> 02:09:48.720]
I think he was in bed with joy. It was a fact in a minute. Okay. I think what

[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.580]
they both said was like that. Their fingerprints are all over it.

[02:09:53.640 --> 02:09:58.100]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT. See that's one good thing when you give

[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:02.380]
us something like this. Everybody's got all these wild cockamimi ideas and

[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:06.380]
everybody's an expert. Everybody's got some wild theory. We just kind of like

[02:10:06.380 --> 02:10:13.700]
sit back and watch it and weep. Here's Hi Aliya. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Hi. How are you?

[02:10:13.940 --> 02:10:20.240]
Okay. This poll of yours, uh, who'd you rather die then? Would you rather die? That's

[02:10:20.240 --> 02:10:25.640]
tomorrow's poll. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on EAT and TNT and Verizon. See I

[02:10:25.640 --> 02:10:29.480]
told you. Thank goodness we got that new to one company. But so we don't have to take any

[02:10:29.480 --> 02:10:32.540]
calls in that out because that means oh well for tomorrow's poll. No tomorrow do

[02:10:32.540 --> 02:10:36.460]
tomorrow's poll. See that's the way it works. Today we do today's poll tomorrow will work

[02:10:36.460 --> 02:10:41.420]
on tomorrow's poll. That's my philosophy. Each day try to work on a different

[02:10:41.420 --> 02:10:45.880]
poll. Grease it up and work on there you go. Well you grease it up. Get out of here.

[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:53.140]
Chris go like the guy said get out here of his queen. Get out your duct tape. Your

[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:57.420]
bottle of water. Lots and lots of bottle water. Little sternal would be good. And see I

[02:10:57.420 --> 02:11:00.720]
totally I know that I knew I mentioned B for only before. There's a reason for it.

[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.920]
Oh, got it. If you got a sterno stove, huh? Right. Because you electric my co-op. And

[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:13.860]
if you're sterno, jelky, you can just sniff the old sterno and snort it. Hmm. Smells

[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:19.240]
like crap. That's just a little B for only wouldn't be bad. No more B for only for you

[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:24.820]
mister. Not after all these problems you're having. All these fat attacks. This place

[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:28.140]
displaces a killer. McGlin of course, have warned for George forcing all that food on me

[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:32.940]
last five, six weeks. That's what it's all about. Carlos isn't here to stick up for me

[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:37.860]
because he was a witness. He saw it. All those meals that were forced down my throat

[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:43.320]
practically force fed. Not that the food wasn't good. We appreciate Wayne Arles very much

[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:50.520]
and pizza loft and who else who else brought in food. Flores. And the corkeys. Oh, now

[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.260]
that was a bad day. That was a bad new one. No, I was such a bad day because we they cut

[02:11:55.260 --> 02:11:59.660]
us off guard. Right. They sent low and guilty food in the morning, which we thought was

[02:11:59.660 --> 02:12:02.180]
the food that we had begged for and then they knew nothing about it. They were happy to

[02:12:02.180 --> 02:12:06.580]
eat it though. And so we ate a whole bunch of that and then they sent us our own food

[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:12.920]
later on. Man, oh man. Yeah, I consumed so much food that day. It was like a miracle.

[02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:20.300]
It was unbelievable. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line as we continue

[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:24.320]
lining up the cockamama theories about all the evil doers and evil things in the world

[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:30.280]
today. Here's Miramar. Hello. Hey, I'm going now. Okay. Hey, well, let me just preface

[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:34.800]
it. Preface is by saying that I'm not an expert, but I used to be in a military and I took

[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:40.440]
Kim War for the training and last time I checked, the only way you can really stop it is

[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:46.340]
if you have a like a filter for the kind of chemical agent that you're up against,

[02:12:46.340 --> 02:12:50.460]
but they really have no idea what you're going to get. Right. It can be and drafts to

[02:12:50.460 --> 02:12:55.260]
be anything. But also I'd had to really watch the news of the purge hunt on your show

[02:12:55.260 --> 02:13:00.340]
about how they're saying should I take the windows and events. But if you do that to prevent

[02:13:00.340 --> 02:13:05.620]
the agents from coming in, you'd have to prevent air exchange because that's how it's

[02:13:05.620 --> 02:13:09.020]
going to come in. Right. So if you prevent air exchange, how are you going to get oxygen

[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:14.040]
unless you got some kind of O2 generator or something? No, you're talking. It's not going

[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:19.840]
to do you any good. So if you ask me, it's kind of irresponsible on the part of whoever,

[02:13:20.020 --> 02:13:26.340]
you know, put that out there. It's ridiculous. I don't hear exactly what they said. How

[02:13:26.340 --> 02:13:30.920]
you should do it, but everything I learned, there's no way to stop it unless you know

[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:35.040]
exactly because like I said, they have to train you for a specific agent. Right. And

[02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:39.360]
there's no one filter going to stop everything. Hey, man. Okay. Thanks a lot. No problem.

[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:43.220]
That's his in oxygen tanks. Let's get a whole bunch of oxygen tanks. What do you say?

[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:48.540]
Whatever would be good. I'll be right down for it. All those scuba places. You can get

[02:13:48.540 --> 02:13:51.240]
all kinds of things. I mean, he made an excellent point. But I wish he wouldn't have put

[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:55.660]
that off there to the public because now that I'll be lined up in the oxygen joints. Yeah.

[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:00.500]
I heard Michael Jackson sleeps in an oxygen tent. Let's go steal his. Oh, or let's just

[02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:05.120]
set it on fire just for a little while. It's just a joke. Well, like I said, for a little

[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:09.720]
while a couple hours, five six seven, oh, five 60. I wonder if that nose would would melt,

[02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:15.980]
do you think? You know it would in the sun. They did a thing on ABC's Good Morning America

[02:14:15.980 --> 02:14:19.820]
this morning about Michael Jackson's plastic surgery. This in the middle of all these

[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:24.540]
other things going on. And they still can't get off of Michael Jackson, you know, in the

[02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:28.800]
nose. And then Joe Castella comes in and he carls his team up on us and they give us a

[02:14:28.800 --> 02:14:33.040]
big song and that's about he's not a pedophile and they feel sorry for him and he didn't

[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.120]
do this. He never saw a freight train. See, I think Carlos can relate to him because

[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:44.240]
he kind of like they're starting to look alike. Real bizarre, freaky, right? In one

[02:14:44.240 --> 02:14:48.500]
case, it's natural though. Never seen him together. Joe Castella on the other hand, I don't

[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:54.640]
know what Joe's story is. I don't know. I have no clue what his deal is. Joe is Joe. Right.

[02:14:54.640 --> 02:15:02.580]
And always will be what's your take on the latest Bin Laden tape 526 votes 162 say it changes

[02:15:02.580 --> 02:15:08.860]
nothing. Prove that Bush is playing it with his hands 143. All the more reason to attack

[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:15.640]
Iraq now 114. What me worry? 66. It's not him. He's really dead. 41. He's saying that.

[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.040]
Want to take another quick one before we do the bridge? Sure. Because it's Port St. Lucy. Hello.

[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:25.760]
Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. A couple of quick things that I find important nobody's talking about.

[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:32.060]
At a 10% of populations, why aren't there any gay porn channels on satellite? That's number one.

[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:36.960]
And if you can't find any viscuine, is it possible to take refuge inside an old queen?

[02:15:37.660 --> 02:15:44.380]
Something to think about. Not this one. Four minutes till noon. He better move to Europe,

[02:15:44.540 --> 02:15:49.200]
I guess he wants to get porn channels. Oh, yeah, they got porn channels over there up up the...

[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:55.180]
Well, anyway, up the satellite. They got whatever you want. Okay. All kinds of stuff.

[02:15:55.300 --> 02:15:58.800]
Because they're like light years ahead of us. They're not off-tied about this stuff. They're not

[02:15:58.800 --> 02:16:02.200]
all goody-touches. They're not being repressed by a bunch of religious fanatics who are running

[02:16:02.200 --> 02:16:08.600]
around screaming at the world is ending and stuff like that. I think we ought to be not letting

[02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:12.200]
Armageddon take us down this road. You know what I'm saying? I think we're getting laid down

[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:17.820]
a garden path. And we don't want to take this folk in the road at all. Four minutes till noon at

[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:21.920]
560 WQM. Hey guys, if you spent the entire year last year avoiding looking in the mirrors,

[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:25.540]
if you're walking around wearing a stupid looking hat because your bald spot is like chasing birds

[02:16:25.540 --> 02:16:32.140]
in the animals away. Look at that. Bokobron with a silly fedora. Oh my god. Even Tessu would be

[02:16:32.140 --> 02:16:37.220]
embarrassed. Get rid of that bald spot with my good buddy, Charles Elfieri. The natural

[02:16:37.220 --> 02:16:41.280]
hairline system is as natural as great as it looks unless it's your real hair. And people will

[02:16:41.280 --> 02:16:45.440]
think it is because the natural hairline system is called that because it looks like it's grown

[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:49.480]
right out of your scalp. As opposed to a barn or an animal died on your head, as opposed to

[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:52.980]
big holes drilled in your head, as opposed to those dangerous pills that don't do what they

[02:16:52.980 --> 02:16:57.000]
am thinking except take money out of your wallet. For over 25 years now, Charlie's been working

[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.100]
with the famous and the infamous and in between because even the outrish guys know that nobody can

[02:17:01.100 --> 02:17:04.080]
give him a better looking head of hair. So if you want to get laid once in a while, if you want

[02:17:04.080 --> 02:17:07.980]
to look better and younger than you have in a long time, call Chuck Elfieri. There's no obligation.

[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:11.580]
If you give your free consultation, sit your eyes down and show you just how much better he can

[02:17:11.580 --> 02:17:14.860]
make you look. And be sure and mention my name will save you 200 bucks off the regular price.

[02:17:14.860 --> 02:17:22.440]
Here's the toll free number 1-800-321-2413. 1-800-321-2413 before the big bomb start

[02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:26.160]
drop and call Charles Elfieri and at least go out looking your best or check them out of the

[02:17:26.160 --> 02:17:28.120]
web if you like it. Charles Elfieri.com.

[02:17:35.980 --> 02:17:41.840]
And Osama Bin Laden and whenever I am in Miami, I listen to neuro-rangers. Well, too, now.

[02:17:42.460 --> 02:17:48.680]
The most controversial movie of our time, Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ recently

[02:17:48.680 --> 02:17:53.120]
became available for whole viewing on cassette. Religious groups, mythed at the release of the

[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.720]
film Theathically, became outraged on the event of its home distribution. And so, for your

[02:17:57.720 --> 02:18:02.660]
spiritual edification and for those who don't have VCRs at a price of a movie ticket, we are proud

[02:18:02.660 --> 02:18:09.020]
to present Live, top one, the radio version of Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ.

[02:18:11.840 --> 02:18:13.800]
But, want to buy a hot stereo?

[02:18:14.740 --> 02:18:16.160]
Gee, I'd better not.

[02:18:16.580 --> 02:18:16.960]
Okay.

[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:21.440]
And say that controversy continues.

[02:18:21.840 --> 02:18:27.080]
Human tomorrow from Martin Scorsese's The Second Last Temptation of Christ. Good day.

[02:18:33.760 --> 02:18:36.640]
Oh, that has really please go away.

[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:44.560]
Find a new way to attack up a big old home and eat your whole homes.

[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:47.860]
Till you explode.

[02:18:49.300 --> 02:18:55.280]
Just like your fat fat churn and ladies have to bite your seats on a plane.

[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:00.940]
Spending your fingers that have yellow stain from tea toes.

[02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.000]
Can see your toes.

[02:19:04.380 --> 02:19:06.720]
After thinking who knows.

[02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:11.300]
I'm proud to be fat disgusting and tasty.

[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:12.220]
Oh,

[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:18.600]
you make the show of it when it's mild.

[02:19:19.420 --> 02:19:22.140]
They like a cow who's mad and sad.

[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:26.100]
Think smelly, fat, so repulsive and mild.

[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:30.140]
Your body cheese smells like a grappa.

[02:19:30.140 --> 02:19:33.480]
After it was occupied by head pass.

[02:19:33.620 --> 02:19:36.200]
Learned us you want to get into your car.

[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:38.420]
Sussure to that M.Y.

[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:46.860]
Onkin squeal, onkin squeal, onkin squeal fat lady.

[02:19:47.300 --> 02:19:49.380]
Living with your loverless mean.

[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:54.700]
Slowering and starting the tree between her mean.

[02:19:55.180 --> 02:19:56.820]
Ashmen's fatal yeast.

[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.180]
Smell fishy to me.

[02:20:01.640 --> 02:20:05.200]
That had a matured atmosphere and tasty taste.

[02:20:10.900 --> 02:20:16.700]
Hey, you won't play this live better.

[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:23.420]
I'm singing this song and I'm feeling kind of sad.

[02:20:23.980 --> 02:20:27.500]
I got my smile from home but my chest came from my bed.

[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:31.680]
I've got a body like a drive and range mat.

[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:35.500]
When it's cold outside use my nips to hang your hat.

[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:41.360]
I can blow in your ear give you a lap dance.

[02:20:42.040 --> 02:20:45.260]
But you won't notice me till I get some implants.

[02:20:46.040 --> 02:20:51.340]
I need a guy who ain't got issues like feeling up a chest

[02:20:51.900 --> 02:20:53.540]
and finding tissues.

[02:20:55.900 --> 02:20:59.640]
Guys say I'm cute, this am fruity.

[02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:03.640]
I'm not warm, we need your pity.

[02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:07.780]
I've got a nice ass and per like a kiss deep.

[02:21:08.140 --> 02:21:12.300]
But I can't get a man because I got no titties.

[02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:14.100]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:17.560]
The wonder brought is something I can't afford.

[02:21:18.080 --> 02:21:21.020]
When you lay on me you'll swear you're on a dive

[02:21:21.020 --> 02:21:21.720]
and board.

[02:21:22.180 --> 02:21:25.780]
When I turned 11 I started to get pused.

[02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:29.860]
Now I'm 24 and so waiting on my boobs.

[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:35.600]
Guys say I'm cute, this am fruity.

[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:39.580]
I'm not warm, we need your pity.

[02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:43.780]
I've got a nice ass and per like a kiss deep.

[02:21:44.160 --> 02:21:48.320]
But I can't get a man because I've got no titties.

[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:50.060]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:50.060 --> 02:21:52.360]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:53.820 --> 02:21:56.360]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:56.380 --> 02:21:58.060]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:58.560]
I've got no titties.

[02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:01.080]
No titties.

[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:03.860]
Sixth of a little brown.

[02:22:04.980 --> 02:22:06.900]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:22:07.640 --> 02:22:09.280]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:22:09.700 --> 02:22:12.740]
It's least of me to brag about your stuff with me down.

[02:22:13.200 --> 02:22:16.360]
I must tell you what my car and that's metallic brown.

[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:19.740]
It has a hole in the trunk and a dent in the door.

[02:22:20.500 --> 02:22:23.360]
And you can see the road through the hole in the floor.

[02:22:23.780 --> 02:22:25.200]
It's my little round two.

[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.780]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:30.340]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:22:30.580 --> 02:22:33.780]
It's an 82-curl and with one head light.

[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:37.400]
So when it gets started I get to use my flight.

[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.280]
With something breaks down.

[02:22:39.640 --> 02:22:40.960]
No it's not hard to fix.

[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:43.140]
Or stuff has been bailing while.

[02:22:43.140 --> 02:22:44.280]
That's the trick.

[02:22:44.760 --> 02:22:46.260]
It's my little round two.

[02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:48.800]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:22:49.720 --> 02:22:51.340]
It's so proud when I got.

[02:22:51.780 --> 02:22:54.700]
I never knew how to drive a car before.

[02:22:55.180 --> 02:22:58.380]
But they handed me the keys when I got too short.

[02:22:59.140 --> 02:23:01.900]
And if they didn't enough to make you nearly flick.

[02:23:02.380 --> 02:23:05.820]
There's one more thing I got no place on it.

[02:23:06.120 --> 02:23:09.040]
It feels up with water on the rainy day.

[02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:12.620]
When the tape and the windows seems to work okay.

[02:23:12.740 --> 02:23:16.060]
The front windows start to shake when I try to steer.

[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:19.340]
And I can't get it out of second's future.

[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:21.280]
It's my little round two.

[02:23:21.840 --> 02:23:23.920]
Oh I'm so proud when I got.

[02:23:24.780 --> 02:23:26.420]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:23:26.700 --> 02:23:28.300]
It's my little round two.

[02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:30.960]
I'm so proud when I got.

[02:23:33.440 --> 02:23:35.240]
It's my little round two.

[02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:39.940]
It's a little old lady from ILLIAAA.

[02:23:42.020 --> 02:23:45.240]
It's a little old lady from ILLIAAA.

[02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:47.880]
I'm ready slow, ready slow, ready slow.

[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:51.420]
With a baseball cap and a silk or d-na.

[02:23:51.580 --> 02:23:53.820]
I'm ready slow, ready slow, ready slow.

[02:23:54.520 --> 02:23:56.640]
Getting in a rickety one down.

[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:59.940]
Shack it down, I'm in conditions to stay at Casuala.

[02:24:06.140 --> 02:24:06.700]
I'm ready slow, ready slow, ready slow.

[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:06.700]

[02:24:06.700 --> 02:24:09.260]
You never see the little old lady from ILLIAAA.

[02:24:09.260 --> 02:24:10.560]
She crawled and she stole.

[02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:11.840]
She's a real boy.

[02:24:12.180 --> 02:24:14.920]
She's a terror of hell and there'll be full of all.

[02:24:15.200 --> 02:24:18.700]
She's a little old lady from ILLIAAA.

[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:24.160]
It's a little old lady from ILLIAA.

[02:24:24.680 --> 02:24:26.920]
I'm ready slow, ready slow, ready slow.

[02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.920]
You're cut your open acolyte.

[02:24:29.060 --> 02:24:30.620]
She never seen you.

[02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:32.940]
I'm ready slow, ready slow, ready slow.

[02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:35.860]
Don't try and blow your undo agitate.

[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:39.180]
Because she'll only keep sucking on a respirator.

[02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:48.100]
Now I can't think of no one who would make me meaner than that little old lady from ILLIAA.

[02:24:48.300 --> 02:24:49.600]
She crawled and she stole.

[02:24:49.760 --> 02:24:50.880]
She's a real old boy.

[02:24:51.100 --> 02:24:53.880]
She's a terror of hell and there'll be full of all.

[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:58.060]
She's a little old lady from ILLIAAA.

[02:25:00.100 --> 02:25:03.360]
She's a little old lady from ILLIAA.

[02:25:03.860 --> 02:25:09.200]
She's a little old lady from ILLIAA.

[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:15.320]
She's a little old lady from ILLIAA.

[02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:17.260]
Have you had any idea why I played that?

[02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:18.640]
I give up.

[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:19.420]
I don't know either.

[02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:20.160]
It's moment of weakness.

[02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:21.640]
Eight minutes fast though.

[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:22.520]
So here's a good fast though.

[02:25:22.620 --> 02:25:23.820]
It says how would you handle the Middle East?

[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:26.200]
It says we have one foot in with Israel.

[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:27.920]
So now we have to put both in or both out.

[02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:30.860]
You seem to think we should do the Hootsie Kuchi and just shake it all about.

[02:25:31.120 --> 02:25:32.340]
I think that's an excellent idea.

[02:25:33.240 --> 02:25:33.780]
You shake it.

[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:34.520]
JTS.

[02:25:34.700 --> 02:25:36.540]
It says do the Hootsie Kuchi and shake it all about.

[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:37.100]
I like that.

[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:46.360]
I think that's a lot better than whatever's going to go on, including all that poison gas and suitcase bombs and other stuff that we don't want.

[02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:48.540]
But it's just a thought.

[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:50.500]
Here's another thought.

[02:25:50.700 --> 02:25:52.140]
Valentine's Day is only two days away.

[02:25:52.380 --> 02:25:57.000]
And of course what women really want for you is that you put a little thought and creativity into your gift.

[02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:57.880]
That's what they want.

[02:25:58.140 --> 02:25:58.360]
Got it?

[02:25:58.720 --> 02:26:01.740]
This year express yourself in a fun and original way and say what the Vermont Teddy Bear.

[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:04.900]
Just call tool free 1-800-829 Bear.

[02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:11.900]
And a friendly bear, counsel will help you choose from over 100 bears hand-cryfted in Vermont and delivered in a colorful gift box with a free card and chocolate day.

[02:26:12.160 --> 02:26:17.380]
Tell her she lights your fire with a new burn in a love bear, dressed like a honky fireman, with a loved hat to one his arm.

[02:26:17.380 --> 02:26:22.560]
Or say I'm wild about you with a general love bear that even got bears for her hobby or occupation.

[02:26:23.060 --> 02:26:26.720]
Sending a Vermont Teddy Bear is creative and a personal alternative flowers which die in a matter of hours.

[02:26:27.140 --> 02:26:30.860]
And unlike those flowers, this will be around a long time after Valentine's Day.

[02:26:31.380 --> 02:26:35.700]
Send her a bear to the office or a coworker's can see just how thoughtful and romantic you're pretending to be.

[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:42.380]
Over night in a Valentine's Day, delivery guarantee, call tool free 1-800-829 Bear or shop online at VermontTeddyBear.com.

[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:51.660]
This year's saying what they Vermont Teddy Bear for Valentine's Day and be sure to tell them that old Neil told you to call 1-800-829-BEAR and then do the Hootsie Cootsie and shake it all about.

[02:26:53.020 --> 02:26:58.240]
I am old, this is sports radio bicycle QAM.

[02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:01.680]
The guy is falling.

[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:23.920]
The guy is falling.

[02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:35.920]
No both re-nation on the field of battle is open for delination from a feeding cattle.

[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:48.340]
No both won't see nobody fast or just get straight with glass and let the television gently spoon feed you.

[02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:55.580]
I'm telling you something that you won't be seeing on the news.

[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:02.200]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:09.240]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:22.120]
They have the reason for keeping us in the dark.

[02:28:22.820 --> 02:28:28.980]
A noble act of reason, we thought that's interest at heart.

[02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:32.360]
No need no civil rights.

[02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:41.140]
If you have nothing to hide, so just relax and work that as a watch the old food tool.

[02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:48.180]
Why do you concern long as you're no winning on a B-U?

[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:55.060]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:28:55.060 --> 02:28:58.620]
We're burning, we're burning, we're burning our troops.

[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:03.000]
Oi!

[02:29:05.460 --> 02:29:17.740]
Why do people think I'm gay?

[02:29:18.100 --> 02:29:21.680]
Why do people say such things?

[02:29:21.680 --> 02:29:26.660]
Assuming I like tingling, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:29:26.940 --> 02:29:27.560]
Why?

[02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:32.980]
They don't, but no one knows.

[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:37.840]
If I really get the hold, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:29:39.940 --> 02:29:44.640]
I'm a studly handsome guy, I'm drunk most afternoon.

[02:29:45.900 --> 02:29:48.500]
It's not of your business, why?

[02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:55.200]
I like your tunes, all the rumors make me sick.

[02:29:55.520 --> 02:30:00.040]
People think I drive a stink, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:06.180]
I know, help me pass the word on.

[02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:11.260]
This dude here's no Welton John, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:17.100]
Guys in the gym, they can't cope.

[02:30:17.840 --> 02:30:22.640]
They're afraid to drop the soap, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:29.780]
I ain't one bit family man, I'm a manly man.

[02:30:30.600 --> 02:30:32.980]
Last night checked in, ain't a sin.

[02:30:33.380 --> 02:30:37.680]
Could be a lie, some fell fell me wide.

[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:39.940]
Why?

[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:44.940]
Tell me why, why did they think I'm gay?

[02:30:48.120 --> 02:30:53.700]
Why do they think I'm gay?

[02:30:57.840 --> 02:30:59.000]
Nice butt.

[02:30:59.200 --> 02:30:59.640]
You're gay.

[02:30:59.840 --> 02:31:00.620]
Mr. Power.

[02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:02.740]
Thank you.

[02:31:03.160 --> 02:31:03.700]
Good morning.

[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:11.500]
I'm here to address the United Nations with incontrovertible evidence of Saddam Hussein's

[02:31:11.500 --> 02:31:14.160]
elusive weapons of mass destruction.

[02:31:14.900 --> 02:31:19.820]
Now ladies and gentlemen, if you'll just watch the screen in front of you, you will see our

[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:22.100]
renderings of Saddam's arsenal.

[02:31:26.620 --> 02:31:33.680]
Now this is more than just a cartoon, because we feel Wiley Coyote is an out of the

[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:34.580]
elegance to Saddam.

[02:31:37.800 --> 02:31:42.840]
As you can see, he hides quite an arsenal of weaponry in his gays.

[02:31:46.900 --> 02:31:53.980]
Now this seed here proves beyond any shadow of doubt that Saddam is indeed hiding his weapon.

[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:02.960]
You'll observe the Coyote holding his ears in anticipation of destroying his infinite

[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:08.080]
enemy, only to discover his own nuclear warhead pointing up his butt.

[02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:19.680]
Now here in the attempt to escape invading forces, he paints a picture on a rock, nor

[02:32:19.680 --> 02:32:23.940]
an ascended, thinking of course he can run through the picture he painted.

[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:33.160]
I hereby submit this as conclusive proof and look forward to your support.

[02:32:33.620 --> 02:32:34.720]
Thank you.

[02:32:50.400 --> 02:32:53.060]
Everyone in office did the same as me.

[02:32:53.360 --> 02:32:56.340]
The only difference was they were a little more discreet.

[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:59.460]
You elected me, your president, not your same.

[02:32:59.900 --> 02:33:02.840]
No matter who you put here, it'll always be the same.

[02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:07.520]
Promotion didn't push, they all had something on the side, but the press loved it was best

[02:33:07.520 --> 02:33:12.320]
to keep it quiet at the time, and helping back then, and it's never gone to stop.

[02:33:12.920 --> 02:33:18.800]
Every president has done the presidential law, when FDR was giving us a brand new deal.

[02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:25.160]
Hell in Orals, given chits a reason to spoil, As in Howard did it back in World War II.

[02:33:25.440 --> 02:33:28.200]
No misdriver, that he liked her and the exclusion to.

[02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:34.800]
Nicks and like interpreters that spoke Chinese and don't get me started on the Kennes' days.

[02:33:35.180 --> 02:33:38.000]
It happened back then, and it's never gone to stop.

[02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:41.200]
I'll never president has done the presidential law.

[02:33:41.680 --> 02:33:47.600]
I guess he could say I've been the minor lead, compared to what went on with the Kennes' days.

[02:33:47.600 --> 02:33:53.800]
The girls I had all is bad to make you limp, unless the cause I don't have Peter Lopper for Moppill.

[02:33:54.340 --> 02:34:00.520]
It wasn't a coincidence or just bad luck, that whoever is the name of the vacuum that sucks.

[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:03.680]
It happened back then, and it's never gone to stop.

[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:06.820]
Every president has done the presidential law.

[02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:10.320]
When you're the president, you have to ask yourself, why not?

[02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:16.560]
No matter what president has done the presidential law, can star making it's criminal, but I hope it's not.

[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:19.700]
The ever-president has done the presidential law.

[02:34:29.180 --> 02:34:32.440]
Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mohawana David Show.

[02:34:32.800 --> 02:34:34.320]
We have a full duck at today.

[02:34:35.060 --> 02:34:38.660]
Including the cavalcade of our articulate athlete of yours.

[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:41.020]
You know that Pike Smoke is still at it.

[02:34:41.200 --> 02:34:41.440]
What?

[02:34:41.640 --> 02:34:43.060]
What? What's singing to those songs?

[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:47.800]
They can funnily. They make funnily all the time, I don't know.

[02:34:48.200 --> 02:34:49.580]
Why they don't adore me?

[02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:52.060]
They're there, everything will be alright, Moppill.

[02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:53.880]
Get your hands off me, a fairy.

[02:34:54.160 --> 02:34:56.000]
You're queer, yet too chumper.

[02:34:56.320 --> 02:34:58.840]
Real men don't touch, only during the game.

[02:34:59.160 --> 02:34:59.880]
Yes, master.

[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.280]
They won't sing, and I'll give them singing.

[02:35:02.720 --> 02:35:04.180]
Get on a piano. Over there.

[02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:05.140]
Okay, Moppill.

[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:06.300]
Now, hit it.

[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:10.540]
Back in my day, men were straight.

[02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:14.060]
The end day is up today.

[02:35:15.340 --> 02:35:17.740]
That's why I can't tolerate.

[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:21.520]
Just gunsling days.

[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:25.340]
Spoils were in day by day.

[02:35:41.640 --> 02:35:43.540]
You're gonna start with your moron.

[02:35:43.660 --> 02:35:44.760]
What's the matter, Moppill?

[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:45.820]
My wig fell off again.

[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:48.340]
Okay. Alright, where were we?

[02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:50.880]
Spoils were in day by day.

[02:35:51.140 --> 02:35:52.240]
I'll take it from here.

[02:35:52.760 --> 02:35:55.320]
The guys that like the worship men.

[02:35:56.660 --> 02:35:59.380]
The thing we will see for the door.

[02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:01.340]
We'll live on the bottom again.

[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:06.080]
Didn't mean to soothbrush Dave.

[02:36:06.940 --> 02:36:10.900]
Or to tickle heri taint.

[02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:14.720]
Jesus Christ, I really hate.

[02:36:16.420 --> 02:36:19.820]
Just gunsling days.

[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:27.420]
Thank you for calling this as T-Toy, and I'm out here.

[02:36:27.740 --> 02:36:30.680]
I just picked up my 92-a-course from your life.

[02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:33.900]
And it is a huge turd in the back seat.

[02:36:33.900 --> 02:36:35.220]
A huge turd?

[02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:35.680]
Yes.

[02:36:36.760 --> 02:36:38.400]
And there's one in the back seat?

[02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:44.340]
A turd. A big ass human turd in the back seat of my car.

[02:36:44.660 --> 02:36:47.680]
I assure you, our guys did not take a dump in your car.

[02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.300]
If you want to bring that car back, we'll take a look at it.

[02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:52.200]
You want to take a look at it.

[02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:55.860]
My car is fine. It's that big ass turd in the back seat.

[02:36:55.940 --> 02:36:57.260]
Okay, what would you like me to do?

[02:36:57.600 --> 02:37:00.940]
I said, okay, how about I go to your house and pick a loaf on your couch?

[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:04.400]
What would you like me to do to fix the situation?

[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:09.100]
I want somebody to come over here, get this turd out my back seat.

[02:37:09.160 --> 02:37:10.320]
That's not going to happen.

[02:37:11.660 --> 02:37:14.260]
You can bring the car here and we can take a look at it.

[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.600]
I am. I'm going to bring it back there.

[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:16.520]
You know what I'm going to do?

[02:37:16.840 --> 02:37:20.280]
I'm going to take a dump in every last car you got there.

[02:37:20.700 --> 02:37:22.320]
I'm going to peel your counter.

[02:37:22.680 --> 02:37:23.820]
I'm going to do it all.

[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:24.480]
Okay.

[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:25.440]
You have a feel.

[02:37:25.980 --> 02:37:26.220]
Okay.

[02:37:26.220 --> 02:37:28.120]
And you know what you feel like a big girl in there?

[02:37:28.120 --> 02:37:29.580]
It probably came out your way.

[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:33.920]
Oh, yeah, I don't make it happen to go on the car.

[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:34.860]
How much do you weigh?

[02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:36.840]
About 400 pounds.

[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:37.820]
That's your turd.

[02:37:37.880 --> 02:37:38.840]
That's my turd.

[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:41.120]
That came from a 400 pound man.

[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:44.140]
That is a 400 pound man, either that or gorilla.

[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:44.700]
Okay.

[02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:50.020]
I'm driving this car right to my lawyer's office and I'm going to let the whole world see...

[02:37:50.020 --> 02:37:51.820]
You're going to be on the news this evening, buddy.

[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:54.120]
I'm going to get seven on my side.

[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:55.660]
What? You're going to be on the news.

[02:37:55.660 --> 02:37:59.620]
Can you describe the, the, the, the pieces? I mean, what does it look like?

You know what it is, it came out your ass!

[02:38:10.020 --> 02:38:14.260]
It smells like you sold your ass to the devil. I don't even know what it is, it's a hell.

[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:18.120]
Well, how many is it? How long is it? It's not as long as my arm!

[02:38:19.700 --> 02:38:26.140]
I don't think it's fun, why y'all this is not fun, I got a damn two-bar four in my back seat.

[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:30.340]
You know, I think this, I think this is a racial shit too. That's what this is.

[02:38:31.060 --> 02:38:35.120]
A little kid is running away from it.

[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:41.620]
I'm gonna go find this funny.

[02:38:42.480 --> 02:38:47.660]
I'm gonna go find this funny.

[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:51.300]
Alright, alright, alright. How long does it look like it's been sitting there?

[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:54.040]
Steve is coming off of it, okay?

[02:38:56.460 --> 02:38:58.920]
Steve, Steve is coming off of it?

[02:38:59.040 --> 02:38:59.340]

Oh my god, I'm getting scared.

[02:39:04.580 --> 02:39:05.240]
How long is it?

[02:39:05.640 --> 02:39:08.900]
I am taking this into fresh turd.

[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:10.960]
Okay, what you need to do?

[02:39:11.280 --> 02:39:13.580]
You need to bring that shirt back.

[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:20.000]
And we'll match it up, we have a lineup, we'll match it up with the other turds that we have.

[02:39:20.260 --> 02:39:23.200]
What you need to do is learn how to use a toilet.

[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:25.120]
We say you're not gonna bring the turd back to me?

[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:26.880]
No, you know what?

[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:27.760]
Is this the sample?

[02:39:28.180 --> 02:39:30.760]
No, I've started to like it.

[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:32.460]
You're gonna keep it as a fact?

[02:39:32.620 --> 02:39:37.400]
I'm gonna keep it, because it's a nice, you know what? It's a nice conversation piece.

[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:38.860]
Okay, cool.

We got the hockey stuff tonight, Rangers, Alexei Kovalov, any interest?

What's the big deal?

[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:27.160]
About my own war.

[02:41:28.900 --> 02:41:34.240]
I don't understand what all the protest is far.

[02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:37.880]
Don't you love?

[02:41:39.440 --> 02:41:41.560]

Or you admit, I made an error in judgment.

[02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:39.040]
We paid so am for the 15 million quid, and we sold, and it's a year.

Rumor has it that the rest of the band was so despondent, they ate each other.

I'm glad that you're called.

[02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:07.980]
We've got to take a stand against this dirty rhyme.

[02:45:07.980 --> 02:45:11.820]
Besides, it's really close to election time.

[02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:15.560]

He could crap a butt to show he had guts.

So most of the people said this guy is a pus.

[02:45:49.480 --> 02:45:52.720]
He rid the land of that noise pollution.

[02:45:53.420 --> 02:45:56.420]

This is Your Blame.

[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:08.040]
Any questions?

[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:19.920]
Will I take off?

[02:47:20.980 --> 02:47:22.740]
Will I choose today?

[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:30.340]
Watch and ring my gold chain

[02:47:30.340 --> 02:47:37.260]
To my surprise, going through it's way

[02:47:37.260 --> 02:47:44.460]
I heard sir, would you walk this way

[02:47:44.460 --> 02:47:47.320]
With arms wide open

[02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:51.000]
We spread your legs wide

[02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:58.680]
We must check every place before you get to your gate

[02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:01.100]
And keep your arms wide open

[02:48:06.000 --> 02:48:09.800]
Keep your arms wide open

I don't know if I'm ready

[02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:26.040]
For all this new security

[02:48:27.800 --> 02:48:34.320]
I look up while they stand my sights

[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:37.080]
I stand and all

[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:40.740]
There goes my flight

At 5.60 WQAM we actually catered to these individuals

[02:50:03.800 --> 02:50:07.660]
by force beating them sports 20 hours a day

[02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:09.220]
And why not?

[02:50:09.960 --> 02:50:11.900]

I got something that I had to confess

[02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:07.820]
He took his phone away and it jumped on my left

[02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:11.400]

It's blabbing ass or his big double chin

[02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:40.780]

I was standing there one day not thinking I would die, from being able to make it to the end.

[02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:27.840]
I should never keep thinking alone, a big back must be trapped inside my bowels.

[02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:34.400]
How can you die from infected thoughts?

[02:58:35.160 --> 02:58:39.940]
The little at least put your doctors in, now my heart stops.

[02:58:40.700 --> 02:58:44.780]
You schwarz at sign eyes for my intestine's hours.

[02:58:44.780 --> 02:58:51.160]
I guess I should have known what to expect living in my arms.

[02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:53.240]
Did you mong on a CDS day? I didn't know that.

[02:58:53.540 --> 02:58:54.620]

[02:58:54.640 --> 02:58:55.520]
Somebody mong on it.

[02:58:56.860 --> 02:58:59.460]
If it's right in my soul, I'll be the hell of a tough one, you know.

[02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:09.160]
Why can't you then need some forgiveness?

[02:59:10.660 --> 02:59:13.160]
Why can't you lose us? Get it right.

[02:59:13.760 --> 02:59:15.640]

If you cannot find us from a bomber rack, if the markets are a bomber rack,

[02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:48.060]
if the terrorists are President Pakistan is looking to be North Korea,

[02:59:48.060 --> 02:59:50.380]
it's too risky from a rack.

[02:59:51.060 --> 02:59:58.320]
If we have no allies with us from a rack, if we think that someone's sister from a rack,

[02:59:59.160 --> 03:00:03.360]
so to hell with the inspections, let's look up for the elections.

[03:00:03.600 --> 03:00:06.400]
Close your mind and take directions from a rack.

[03:00:07.260 --> 03:00:10.420]
Fall in line and follow orders from a rack.

[03:00:11.540 --> 03:00:14.440]
For a right, vaccines are orders from a rack.

[03:00:15.720 --> 03:00:19.360]
Disagree will call the trees and let's make order of the season,

[03:00:19.600 --> 03:00:22.360]
even if we have no reason from a rack.

[03:00:22.940 --> 03:00:24.940]
Yeah, it's kind of catch you want to sing that all day.

[03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:27.000]

[03:00:27.560 --> 03:00:29.280]

Proof that Bush is playing right into his hands 172.

[03:00:34.140 --> 03:00:37.260]
All the more reason to attack your rack right now, stick it to a 134.

[03:00:37.740 --> 03:00:38.680]
What me worry 74?

[03:00:39.220 --> 03:00:40.480]

Press around the night, 5 to 7, Bokobarans going to be there.

Would that silly hat?

[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:51.860]
You know something that's worth the press of a mission right there.

[03:00:52.620 --> 03:00:54.800]
To see what it now, which is going to be more exciting,

[03:00:54.940 --> 03:00:56.560]
but silly hat or the chicken that.

[03:00:56.640 --> 03:00:57.520]
Bye bye bye.
