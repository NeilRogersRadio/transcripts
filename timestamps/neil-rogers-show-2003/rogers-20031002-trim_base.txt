[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080]
Good morning, Neil. I got everybody mad today. You think limbaugh was inhaling maybe a little bit of rush

[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.880]
Yeah, a little rush rush baby a little crack maybe some oxy. Yeah, he is his housemate has

[00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.180]
You know she was wearing wire taps as she was selling him blues. He was patting her down

[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.180]
Padding her for wire taps

[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.880]
That's what some guy said new stories is some guy my shirt. They said he did some work at his house

[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:32.080]
I'm in Palm Beach and yet they made he made him wear surgical booties around his house says when his housekeeper quit

[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.660]
He became increasingly paranoid even patting her down for recording devices

[00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.580]
He told me he was going in the air for detox for a second time and she says after he returned

[00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.140]
I went to talk to him and he cried a little bit. He told me if it ever got out he would be ruined a row man

[00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.920]
Oh, right. I guess it is what's such a mean spirited vile vulgar tub of crap like him

[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.320]
It's just beautiful to see all is coming down on his end now

[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.080]
I got the entire half of the sales staff here mad at me good

[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:05.720]
And you know what I line their pockets with money, but they blame me when they're not making money and I say blame the management not me

[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.820]
You know what I mean Neil know what do you mean? I mean that I'm not gonna you know, it's simple

[00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.460]
How many people did I tell you today or after me?

[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360]
But for the man so I'm just gonna let you know my protectors protect me right?

[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.200]
I don't know if he protects me but I need the sales department there a bunch of belly acres and winers and excuse makers

[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.460]
I

[00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.960]
Look at this log today am I four hours now?

[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.840]
It's enough to make a grown man cry

[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.140]
Here's a guy said to me today one of the sales guys he goes you get your twenty five dollars every time you mention them

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.460]
And I go you get your twenty five thousand you prick and I don't care about your

[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.680]
I don't care about his family. I care about mine and if the sponsor isn't paying me juice

[00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.480]
Then I'm not there. I'm not their loyal frickin budding mouth

[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.040]
Yeah, I'm gonna be loyal to any sponsor until I get mine

[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.160]
How's that sales department is the sorry thought?

[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.600]
I think they got him out of a dumpster and Skippy was like a red on the bottom of the heat

[00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.880]
Yes, right there right now outside ready to

[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.000]
He stalks me father really yeah, well tell him he's doing one hell of a job in my accounts

[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.400]
Not that he's a piece of crap. Okay. I'm gonna get look a broughtsy and fat wrist

[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.100]
I'm sorry, Neil. I can't I can't talk about crap on my shelf. Oh, can you can you take a crap?

[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.700]
Your contract that you're allowed to take one crap a month. I would it every day when you come on me

[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.960]
Crossover from now on if you could please you know

[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.060]
Just fart and poop as much as possible because I know you're

[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.680]
I'm not allowed to be you

[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.700]
Not allowed to do what you do, but you are so do it on my show to help my ratings

[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.460]
In fact, I just farted for real now just

[00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.500]
For four hours about dumping in your pants so that you could like maybe just carry my that would make me I would go

[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.200]
Master, me now who's just a bat? Who's the interjecting there? I have no idea. I'm just excited about your pause then

[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.540]
Did you do what that was said for well? Oh, that was the beast

[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.900]
I'll see you in the next people that are in there trying to get me to hire today

[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.540]
Tubba crap. I got sales people that got a great cartoon. Do you see the sunset of this morning? No?

[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.040]
I don't read the paper ever good good move. Anyway, yeah, let me just tell you the good stuff

[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.940]
It's a cartoon from a P. P. Park and it shows somebody so called fans Marlins fans and

[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:21.800]
Here's the Huckster, you know the guy the salon a crap at a aisles and it says get your pre-tattered Marlins jerseys here

[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.760]
Look like you've been a fan all season and he's holding up a Florida Marlins jersey like all schmutzie

[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.400]
And it's got holes in it and here the fans with their money out there all whipped up and reaching out beautiful front running funny play

[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.600]
So I had your buddy Randy Molyron and men it ago

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.340]
But he's wait a minute see you have a long time to understand. He's the team clown. He's the team mascot

[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.260]
He's not my buddy. I'm a silly person. I asked him if jigs was dead and actually doing the broadcasts and the answer is oh

[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.260]
Yeah, he's been dead 10 years

[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.760]
You'll have to be a good to pull who's worse Dave Ann boring or jugs McDonald

[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.380]
That might be a good one that I on your cell and he's pot fan

[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.680]
You know, I hope that jigs gets like pneumonia this year and they actually asked me to call some games because if there's one thing

[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.040]
I can do I miss suck, but I can call hockey game. I just know that but anyway the interesting part of

[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.920]
There's a lot of stuff about it after paranoid now because he's had guilty for the last two years

[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.320]
Greed that down his ass his old grizzled ass wanting to panther play by play radio job

[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.380]
They can't do it either. He's a good guy's after his job. Gellie's boring. I heard him call a game is boring. It's boring

[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.120]
Every time the league's boring

[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.840]
There's no list. They only got I mean I can't even

[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.860]
I can't even name one of them that's entertaining you're not can Joe Bowen now again. I think he's boring

[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.360]
They're all that I know you blow Joe Bowen and no

[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.120]
That's where I always stop the covers. You could you part some more so that I get up set Greg

[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.040]
It's the deal's the right to show we can fart

[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.360]
It's not a way skippy's it get the on the else as you blow as the salesman you suck your words

[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.880]
Listen on your account. You're a crap skippy. That way you've let all my stuff just vanish

[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.900]
You go to a damn thing and get back there with your head up screw and

[00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.620]
Who the hell are you kid? Huh everybody in the sale for right that twirl like point

[00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.880]
You have the whole like chain smokey at home. Oh probably out there selling drugs on a street corner lives during

[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.240]
441 he is a body of axes from the housewife of rush

[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.060]
I can need to be a favor in the on and blow some farts and poop

[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.360]
See you

[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.960]
And

[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.920]
a specially alright

[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:02.200]
With

[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:16.740]
You may be

[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:46.720]
We have listened to the costumes of theолнeling women viert steel and관al

[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.400]
right here. Attention, though, that heavy karma was bound to get you some

[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.140]
time. Like all the millions that clear channels.

[00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:01.320]
Oh, hey, that's not the same. Maybe next you lose your eyesight. I don't

[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.720]
care. I love your balls for long.

[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.500]
Get lost, get lost, get lost.

[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.660]
Oh, hello, 7560. It's a great day, boys and girls.

[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.160]
Wow. Great day for the Irish and the Jews and the

[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.060]
others. Did you have any idea?

[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:21.600]
No, I didn't. When I rolled my fat ass out of bed this morning, I didn't even

[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.080]
realize that he had been forced to resign.

[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.460]
Shall we say we don't want to see who's can do it? No, because that that's just

[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.400]
isn't appropriate. Like, I'm sure they don't want to say oh we fired the

[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.040]
shoes, my sister, the brainstem. So he had ESPN films come to his home and they

[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.740]
filmed this whole thing and see I retired. I retired. Do you believe me? No.

[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.020]
Same thing with Rush. Retired my fat ass. No, they retired his fat ass.

[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.920]
Anyway, let's do yesterday's poll result here first before we get into this

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.100]
because we got some heavy duty. I talked about this at length yesterday before it

[00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.860]
became like really the thing to do is you're all over the country. And of course now,

[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:56.960]
what do I tell you?

[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.720]
A minimal response at our website yesterday. There's something really, really

[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.860]
amiss. Because they think it's a sports thing. It's not a sports thing. It's

[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:08.240]
partly ongoing political scenes. See, when I turn on like an entertainment show,

[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:12.020]
whether it's sports, whether it's a comedy show or sitcom, I don't want to be

[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:17.340]
indicted with politics. You know, we got to we're just drowning in a sea of

[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.620]
right wing propaganda in America. Who do I want that? So when you turn on a

[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:26.000]
pregame show for a sporting event or the game itself, the last thing anybody

[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.840]
in their right mind wants is some right wing or left wing asshole on there

[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:35.020]
making all kinds of socially irreparable statements in the bullcrap. And ESPN

[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:38.560]
took four weeks for him to get canned. I still wonder if this whole thing wasn't

[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.860]
just predetermined a big publicity stuff for the beginning. They probably didn't

[00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.700]
count on the New York Daily News putting on a front page of the story about

[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:50.580]
his pill probe. The old pill probe, pop each county by the way is investigating.

[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.280]
They're leading the investigation. But nevertheless, we'll get back to that.

[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.020]
Yesterday's pool. I don't I am with you. I don't know what this second category

[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:03.600]
would goose that up a little bit. Should Neil accept Mohawar Davids' overtures

[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.580]
of peace and love. Absolutely. Absolutely not. We hate Mohawar 366 32% nearly

[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.580]
a third of this audience said don't even think about it you idiot. Yes, we

[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:17.300]
harmony it Q.A. Now that's I don't know that just seems out of character for

[00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:22.260]
this crowd. 215 people said that 18.8%. Aren't you a little suspect? Maybe

[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:25.060]
there's a new eyebrows. Why should be asking you a question because then they

[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:28.740]
got it sent that anonymous facts in a mail will be upset like I'm talking to you

[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:37.120]
and I'm supposed to ignore you. Oh man. What a sour bunch of people. Anyway, yes,

[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.400]
we need harmony a Q.M. 215 only if Mo paints his vault spot 192 16.8% a lot of us

[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:49.740]
would pay to see that only if Neil has no self respect 191 16.7%. I have to

[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.820]
take that very seriously. Don't I? No. Huh? Yeah, whatever. Well, I mean, I'm the

[00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:56.760]
one who made up the question. So it was like an invitation for them to say don't

[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.720]
you dare every video. And who's Mohawar David and 177 people just to be wise as

[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.960]
is that 15 and a half percent said who's Mohawar David? Everybody knows Mo. Absolutely.

[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.100]
Right. Nobody don't know Mo. Not no. Mo. You think? No. Nobody know. Don't

[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:16.500]
no. Mo. No. No. That's right. That's what I'm thinking. So there you go. Over 1100 votes

[00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.060]
on yesterday's poll. But they weren't too crazy about it. They wanted to be. I don't

[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.020]
know what they wanted. And of course, they don't know what they want. So here go. Limbaugh

[00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:27.400]
resigns from NFL show. Does anybody really believe that he voluntarily resigned? No.

[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.860]
No. I mean, the Schmidt really hit the fan yesterday because the one thing you

[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.900]
don't do on national television is make any kind of a statement that's like racially

[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.660]
insensitive. You just don't do it because you know what happens if you do it, you get

[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.540]
your aspired. Hmm. You get canned. And I believe you mean he wasn't doing like a comedy

[00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:51.680]
thing. He isn't known for satire and comedy to say the very best. And you can see that

[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.720]
if you watch the tape that was listening to the audio was one thing but seeing the way

[00:10:55.720 --> 00:11:00.240]
he presented it, it was obvious it was like pre-plan. It was like scripted. He planted

[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:06.160]
it ahead of time. Here was the bomb. Oh, sorry, FRL. Here's the bomb. Who's going to drop

[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.040]
on the public? Oh, this is a lot of equipment. He's not really that good. The media has been

[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:14.200]
praying for a black quarterback. Where's that story? I got where's the thing about the op?

[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:20.880]
I hope I didn't Schmidt can it. Oh, no. Oh, I did. From the Atlanta, I'll have to get that again.

[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.660]
There were seven quarterbacks started in the NFL the other day and there were two other

[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.120]
regular black quarterbacks who didn't start because they were injured. So that's nine.

[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.680]
How do you like that? But the media has been looking to play up a black quarterback because

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:36.020]
it's a racial thing. And once again, you know, and then I hear Tucker with his bow tie,

[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.340]
I say, it'll pans you on CNN crossfire. Well, the liberal, you know, the liberals always

[00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:44.260]
with their affirmative action and their racial diversity. All of a sudden, what does that have to

[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:49.260]
do with it? It's a stupid ball game, you asshole. Pathetic. He's ripping a guy because,

[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.560]
well, he's black and he's not good enough. But the media wants to pretend he is because they want

[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.820]
a panty to the dark folks, the discharges. What kind of crap is that? So rush gets canned.

[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.920]
And that's only the beginning of his problems. We'll get to that pill story momentarily. Aren't you

[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.740]
excited? There is so much going on today. I'm squeezing myself and we got something else going

[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:12.080]
on at noon. Today, we got a big van hit with our best ideal merchandise and there's very

[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.340]
a marginally popular Mohawar David of Keychains for abandoned pet rescue. No until two was

[00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:23.360]
Joe Costello and the lovely Miguel, they'll be at Riva Yamaha 3671 North Dixie highway and

[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.480]
Pompato Beach. They'll be there together. I haven't been informed yet who's going to be on top.

[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.040]
And here's the deal. They have five pair of tickets to see Alice Cooper and concerted Pompato

[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:35.780]
Beach amphitheater and eight pair of tickets to the Panther Lightning Exhibitionist game at the

[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.580]
Yetha Center, this Saturday the 4th of October. So there you go for the first, I guess,

[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:46.440]
mix and match for the first 13 people to make a donation to abandon pet rescue and get some of our

[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.860]
nifty, nifty CDs and other merchandise. 1013 at 560 WQM if you don't have a good mattress,

[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:57.260]
you're not sleeping worth a crap. Man, your back will tell you, your back will be sore and you'll

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.540]
be sore about it. Don't get sucked into one of those sales from the betting and the furniture stores

[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:05.600]
now because they can't even come close. What they do is they double the price, then they cut it

[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.180]
in half and say, hey, look at what a big sale is. And the prices are still higher than your every

[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:15.700]
day, 365 the year prices of dial amacres. For a real discount, prices on dozens of great models from

[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.420]
the top names in the universe, this is the way to do it. Pick up the phone and call dial amacres.

[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.280]
They got them all. Seely, sir, the temperate, extremance, king, choral, stern, and foster,

[00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:28.100]
hew it. No nonsense, no bait and switch, no house brands, no false promises, no full

[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:31.920]
knee sales. Then they give you a service like your only dream about because when you call dial amacres

[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.360]
at 1-800-MACres, you really, honestly and legitimately, it sounds too good to be true, but they do.

[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.600]
Do you pick the day in time for delivery? Any two, I wonder what it's convenient for you when

[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.380]
you're asked is going to be home. Noon two, one to three, five to seven, whatever, eight in the

[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:48.200]
morning till 10 p.m. any day, seven days a week, you'll be sleeping like a child the very first

[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.860]
night. I've been sleeping on a mattress and dial amacres for years and look what a picture of

[00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.920]
health I am, you should be doing the same. With low prices, same day delivery, if you set up

[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.680]
in Louisville, it's easy to see why dial amacres is ranked the best in the world in customer

[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.920]
satisfaction. So look at Con, don't get sucked in by those mattress, show them or furniture

[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.760]
store ads. They can't come close to dial amacres every day deals. Pick up the phone, call them right

[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:16.300]
now, they'll be at your door in no time at all, 1-800-MACRUS. That's the number to call 1-800-MATTRES

[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.540]
or online it's mattress.com.

[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:24.640]
My name is Neil Moore, we're sports radio five season, UAM.

[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:32.080]
Oh, holy mackenon, this is Joe Boyle on the voice of the Toronto May Beliefs and you're listening

[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.060]
to the hockey authority, Neil.

[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:43.140]
This is Rush Wimbaugh, Servant of Humanity, Talk Show Host, Hemroyd Suffer. Folks with over 300

[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.140]
pounds, I know the agony of this kind of dilemma. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm here to tell you there's

[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:55.440]
help. With new Preparation Rush and my Rush to Excellence Suppositories, now you can end the

[00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.740]
pain and it's ring of Hemroyd will teach you just for my picture on the box of Suppositories

[00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:08.180]
and the applicator tube, another fine product from OIB, the obesity and broadcasting of the work.

[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:36.400]
Marlins in a playoffs and after a great season, what's your take? We've got five categories here,

[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.720]
now don't lie, okay, it's just anonymous pool, don't lie to try to make yourself feel better.

[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:46.240]
I mean just tell it like it is for once in your lives, okay? Be honest, I've been a real fan all

[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:52.140]
along. I'm a recent fan, I'm just jumping on the bandwagon, I don't give a crap about the

[00:15:52.140 --> 00:15:56.700]
Marlins or hey, Neil, I still don't give a shmit about sports. There's five excellent choices for

[00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.280]
you, touching all the game last night. Do you realize did you watch any of that? Yep.

[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.080]
First inning is when he lost the game and in my mind I said to myself, there were head too

[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.260]
nothing, they have the bases loaded and nobody out and they don't score any more runs, three straight

[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.760]
strikeouts, Eric Caros may have had the worst at bat in the history of baseball. Even some swishy

[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.360]
little picture could have had a better at bat than that. It was the worst at bat with a bases loaded,

[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.020]
they wound up not scoring anymore and I said to myself, they had a chance to put the game away

[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.820]
right there, they had a braves on the ropes, gasping for oxygen and when you let them off the

[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.800]
hook like that, you always lose the game 99 times out of 100. Is the harbinger of things to come?

[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:34.160]
It was bad. Very well put. They heard that, George. A harbinger of things to come. Pretty good

[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.160]
like that. It was rush. I think the ESPN thing with rush is the harbinger of things to come. He

[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:43.960]
must have heard somebody else say that. But yeah, well, it's just a sports cliche, but that's why he

[00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:49.520]
said it. Of course, he would know about sports cliches because you hate sports. Watch it,

[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:55.960]
which is probably why they hate you. Now what's going on here is they must be a vote non-there. Oh,

[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:02.100]
real fan all along. Eight. Okay. I don't give a crap about the Marlon six. He knew I still don't

[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.500]
don't give a Schmidt about sports six. I'm just jumping on a bad way in five and I'm a recent fan.

[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.780]
One. Well, that's five like that. Five people honest enough. That's what I voted. Although,

[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:14.200]
I'm not really that's the only category I could. I'm not really on the bandwagon. I'm not rooting

[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.080]
for them or against them. I just I think it's nice for the community. Something good and exciting

[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.880]
is happening now. Something for people to cling on to, all the clingons in South Florida,

[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.160]
where somebody bad and embarrassing and humiliating things happen with such great regularity,

[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:30.800]
like the Chad thing and the alien thing and just about anything else you can think of. Oh, man.

[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:36.380]
And all the illegal aliens floating up on sure every day. That kind of an antipote,

[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:42.680]
the aroma that's kind of lingers over a dead county anyway. And there's now seat. I thought

[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:47.180]
only a spat people used to see, but there's like seeping into brown and to pomb each. But even in

[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:52.140]
the store now, there's a whole bunch of mitochondries and cheese. There's those top of them. Limbo

[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:56.300]
resigns from NFL show. That's the I didn't even know about this. I'm sitting here this morning. I

[00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.640]
didn't know he'd can't they can't I mean, he resigned his fat ass. They can't. Can't ask. Yeah,

[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:07.020]
can't fat ass. Anybody want about 20 pounds in the wake of his controversial statements regarding

[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.900]
Eagles quarterback, Donovan McNabb. Rush Limbo has resigned from his position on ESPN Sunday NFL

[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.640]
countdown pregame show ESPN has accepted the resignation with Glee. I'm sure they're sure they

[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.360]
were dancing. They said, uh, resign now or else. And he wrote it out and signed it and they said,

[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.840]
okay, thank you. Limbo issued a statement late last night, which he wrote. My comments this past

[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.740]
Sunday were directed at the media were not racially motivated. Right. I offered an opinion. The opinion

[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:38.500]
has caused discomfort to the crew, which I regret. I love NFL Sunday countdown. Don't want to be

[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:43.180]
a distraction to the great work done by all who work on it. Therefore, I've decided to resign to

[00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.920]
which we say, all right. I appreciate the opportunity to be part of the show and wish all the best of

[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.440]
those who make it happen. End of quote. Greg Boad, Boddenheimer, president of ESPN ABC Sports issue

[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:58.580]
the following response. He said, thank God. No, he didn't say that. I bet you did though.

[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:05.160]
Under his breath. He said, we have sent his resignation and regret the circumstances surrounding

[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.800]
this. We believe that he took the appropriate action to resolve this matter expeditiously.

[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:15.400]
Oh, man. The comments referenced by Limbo. Okay, well, we already know about them.

[00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.640]
Negative ration didn't come immediately, but on Tuesday, McNad pulled a Philadelphia daily news.

[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:24.820]
It said that you've got to go to skin color. I thought we were through with that whole deal. I

[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:30.140]
thought that was like a old step in fetch it and anchorman. Mama stuff. From there, the fire

[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.580]
storm spread quickly. Democratic presidential candidates, Wesley Clark, that's general,

[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.320]
Wesley Clark to you. We've heard the dean. What? We tired. That's retired. General, Wesley Clark to you.

[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.900]
Former Vermont governor, not so retired. Howard Dean and Reverend Al Sharpton. He's got a title.

[00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:51.000]
Call for ESPN to fire Limbaugh. Others into both political and athletic circles also

[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.140]
lashed out at Limbaugh's comments. Who is that that said? Athletic. Who said that? I saw some

[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.400]
you say that actually right on camera this morning and I just about poop my pants. Oh, I can't say

[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:05.180]
that. Can't do it. I can't think about it. Oh, no, that's for all that can't do the poop thing.

[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:10.820]
I can do it. I can poop all I want. Let's see. Stutter McGill and Homestead already has a

[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:15.260]
commentary on here. He says the rush postman is just a self promoting you know, I think that

[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.480]
our whole audience at noon yesterday turned over to flush. I really believe that happened. Do you?

[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.880]
Yes. I'm serious. Remember it noon the phones like we're like all of a sudden died and then the

[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:27.000]
one to two hour. I enjoyed it. What do you are? I played a lot of good stuff. But the website

[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.060]
was like deadly. It says rush must be coming out with a new book or something. Get this knuckle

[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:38.560]
head in the white house where he belongs. That's excellent. Nice go on. Stutter.

[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:43.840]
McGill. Anyway, Kozand is saying the National Association of Black Euron List also called for ESPN

[00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:50.640]
to separate itself from Limbaugh from this right wing hateful racist piece of scum. ESPN's credit.

[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:54.960]
It just didn't make any. You know what this made about as much sense to put him on there as it

[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.880]
did for Dennis Miller to be on money that football, which also played a gigantic egg. Sure.

[00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.720]
This is the desperation that these sports networks are going to because they're looking for

[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:10.500]
another Howard Cozell and like I've told you a million times that they're ain't going to find

[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:20.620]
another Howard Cozell. There is no other Howard Cozell. You know, I mean Howard Cozell was a

[00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:24.480]
and quite to the contrary of making racist comments. He was good buddies with your

[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:30.140]
co-host personal friend, Muhammad al-Khalif-Lawar Ali. Shake it up. Yeah, he, well he is shaking it.

[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.200]
ESPN's credibility as a journalism entity is at stake in a BG,

[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:38.640]
National Association of Black Euron List president Herbert Lowe said in the news release.

[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:43.860]
He doesn't make a good TV that low TV is fabulous. It needs to send a clear signal that the

[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.080]
subject of race and equal opportunity are taking seriously at its news outlets.

[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.840]
McNabb also provided more reaction yesterday. It's somewhat shocking to hear that on

[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.640]
National TV from him. McNabb said it's not something that I consider and say it won't bother me.

[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.240]
Limbott turned down request to appear on Sports Center yesterday, but earlier in the day on

[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:05.100]
a syndicated radio talk show, he refused to back down because he's a pompous ass. He lies a lot.

[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.740]
He slanders everybody under the sun from the Clinton study buddy. You can name. We don't agree with

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:14.920]
his right wing views. He says all this has become the tempest that it is because I've been right

[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.840]
about something he said. If I wasn't right, there would be there wouldn't be this

[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:23.780]
cocafony of by the way the word mow is cocafony. There wouldn't be this cocafony. He was mispronouncing

[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.540]
it all. There wouldn't be this cocoa foamy of outrage that sprung up at the Sports Rider community.

[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.740]
He made it a wrong one. That's a movie. When's the night ESPN issued a statement that in part

[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.680]
where we've communicated to Mr Limbott those comments were insensitive and inappropriate. His

[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.640]
resignation was officially announced just before midnight last night towards everybody with a brain

[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:47.400]
says yeah all right you fact-tub-a-crap you jackass and it serves them right that it blow up

[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.660]
under the face in the first place because like I said it didn't make any sense. Anybody with a

[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.360]
child could have told you what do they want to put some right wing bombastic political commentator

[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:00.200]
some Nazi bastard on there to spout right wing hateful crap what the hell is that got to do with

[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.120]
football on the price of rights right yeah but don't confuse them with the facts and then of course

[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.100]
we got the pill popping that's the story from the Daily News which I'll get into a great length

[00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:14.940]
here momentarily because you know ordinarily anybody in the business you feel for it but in his case

[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:19.920]
because he's such a venomous hate mongering sack of crap and because he lies so much what's

[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:26.560]
that one of the book about the Rush Limbaugh as a big fat liar something like that huh you know

[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.840]
the one I mean I do but I don't know that like documents about 80,000 of his 30 million lies 1026

[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.820]
at 560 it's a great thing like that one email they got it to see it in there it says boy we got

[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:43.400]
Rush Limbaugh forced off ESPN and we got a Republican scandal at a White House so what more could

[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:47.300]
Democrats and liberals want to which we say yeah it's about time and nobody's getting no blow jobs

[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:54.800]
either that we know of yet yet yeah although to be honest with that whole thing on the pregame show

[00:23:55.720 --> 00:24:02.940]
on ESPN that was a two hour blow job yes see even mad dog knows about it 26 after 10 at 560 WQM if

[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:07.820]
you've got a gigantic ball spot on your head you can either do nothing about it like me because in my

[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:11.920]
case it's gonna make a difference not not really but in your case a lot of you guys out there who

[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.700]
under the age of 100 younger than me it probably can make a big difference for you so you have many

[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.120]
many choices because everybody's an expert now everybody's a prover and expert they've all got

[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.680]
some answer to your baldness problems they got pills they want to study and then of course you

[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.860]
keep taking them and taking you suffer the injuries side effects and then you find that nothing's

[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.040]
happening on top of your head to really propish you off and then you got those awful mousey looking

[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:36.120]
pieces like the one that mow wears that is the life and stock of the community in the sand Donaldson

[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.380]
piece and the Dennis Cousinage piece and the Aaron Brown thing it looks like it's gonna crawl down

[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:44.340]
the side of his head right there on camera if you want to look better and younger than you ever

[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.000]
dreamed you possibly could again if you want to say goodbye to your bald spot call my good buddy Charles

[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.980]
Alfie Erie because his natural hairline system is the most amazing available in the world at any price

[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:57.860]
and it's affordable too that's right if you mention the Arrige's when you call it you get next to

[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:02.020]
200 bucks off that already low price so when you got to lose beside a shiny ugly bald spot

today I'd like to read a letter that I'm writing to all white people today in the spirit of unity

[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:16.280]
and understanding dear white folk couple of things you ought to know when I'm born I'm black

[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:28.140]
when I grow up I'm black when I get sick I'm black when I go out in the sun I'm black

[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:41.660]
when I go out in the cold I'm black when I get scared I'm black and when I die I'm still black

[00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:51.560]
but you my white man when you're born you're pink when you grow up you're white

[00:26:52.520 --> 00:27:02.840]
when you get sick you are green when you go out in the sun you go red and when you get cold

[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:12.120]
you turn blue when you get scared you turn yellow and the happiest time of my life is when white

[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:19.660]
people die you turn purple and you've got the damn nerve to call me culling

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:25.300]
1032 at 560 wqm he sure got away with words that Louis Ferrican there's another one by the way

[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.520]
you ever see him and rush together no better take a couple of calls before we get into our

[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:36.040]
pill popping here's four lottery hello yes sir sorry about that bro how you doing man okay

I really haven't chance to listen to you I'm sure you're talking I just

[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:45.440]
last few minutes you've been talking about that rush deal but you know I despise that guy probably

[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:53.620]
more than a lot of people on this earth but I just can't understand the fear over what he said I

[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:55.100]
mean you could you could you could you could you could you could you could you could you could you

[00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.720]
you could you can't say anything you can't say nigga you can't say this you know you're talking

[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:05.740]
to people it's ridiculous even if you say so in other words if you went on a year and said

[00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:09.360]
Donovan McNabb was the lame nigger you to thought that would have been okay too well

[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:17.000]
honestly yeah yeah be good have a nice life 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 6 he doesn't understand

[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.060]
well right by the way they get the hood on straight the meeting tonight eight o'clock 5 6 7 0 5 60

[00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:28.020]
pound 5 60 on a AT&T in Ferrican wireless line he's the biggest is you believe anything that he

[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:34.720]
just said no he's a ditto head he's an idiot mm-hmm here's Miami hello hello

[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:42.560]
yes sir hey I've got clear eye for the NFL that's got to be on instead of rush

[00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.400]
well we're getting so see that can we get he standing here to hear the response from the audience

[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.880]
about this and since this is being talked about all over the world today this is the big story

[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:56.280]
and so far we're too to do we're batting a thousand too do do I'll make the call here's a Delray

[00:28:56.280 --> 00:29:02.860]
Beach hello yeah see if we can keep this week going yes sir good morning sir yeah I just had to

[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:10.660]
call you because I am deriving sexual excitement at his whole rush limbaugh thank sports work me too

[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:17.740]
if there was ever a person who deserve to who deserve it to be knocked down not one peg but

[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:26.580]
several it would have to be this guy I let do listen to his show occasionally and the same

[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:35.320]
life that this man spews it's unbelievable how he gets over 20 million listeners per day is

[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.640]
beyond me I don't forget Arnold is eight points ahead in California so that should give you a pretty

[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:47.040]
good clue right there yeah yeah yeah I've spoken to you tons of times and about how um Americans can

[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.460]
be and whatnot and of course in a rush of place when he starts spewing at that right wing hey keep

[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.000]
in mind one word redneck okay America like I keep trying to tell you is loaded with red

[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.400]
next millions and millions and millions of rednecks what I want to hear though is how he somehow

[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:10.360]
gonna tie his resignation from ESPN to the Clinton presidency because everything that happens with

[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:15.900]
this country at all according to him goes back to Bill Clinton so I'm trying to get Hillary to I

[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:21.660]
think Hillary made him do it yeah I'm just curious I'm actually gonna tune into that swell and

[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.980]
just to catch the spin that he's gonna place upon it but I like you I'm sitting here driving with a

[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:32.160]
chubby buddy okay I love you Neil squeeze it hard pal I have a great fight you gotta have a friend

[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:38.080]
what he said he's driving with a chubby buddy he's driving with his chubby buddy yeah maybe he likes

[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:44.600]
the queen sickle like Moe absolutely by the way Nadine says wow great more than expected from Clark

[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:48.560]
and small village that's where I hate to break the news to Nadine I forgot all about it I'd

[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:54.000]
you know out of sight out of my didn't see it George saw it it said Clark is hot and the show

[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.960]
didn't let me down I like the bad Clark and we can all agree on that Nadine what do you think are

[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.360]
we on the same page we're on the same page but I can't see it till Sunday when they do to repeat

[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.080]
they're on it though what do they call it uh easy view I don't know what you call it right there

[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:11.060]
in front of your face they say hey see this see how easy it was to view that says love the computer

[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.960]
because it brings me closer to you thank you Nadine and I'll check it out on Sunday because they

[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:20.860]
are only good things about it I hear it was a real eye popper oh there's that thing with

[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.580]
poppers again we'll be talking about rush I can't wait to get to this New York daily news column

[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:29.880]
but we got so many great calls on here you know it really makes you kind of like twist between a

[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.880]
heart is that the Pat Boone book twist 12 and 20 I think he touched it once when he's

[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:38.400]
sticking it over to it yeah he got no the name of that yeah yeah the book by Russell Imboys rushes

[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.500]
a big fat liar and other observations by our favorite Al Franken right see there you go I know it

[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:50.920]
and Toyota rushes a big fat lying divisive racist piece of crap who's out of a job on a SPM

[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:55.040]
but it's still making millions because he's on more than 650 radio stations all across the country

[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.100]
because there are lots and lots and lots and lots of rednecks and like I said yeah just like this

[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.340]
last guy hates him like poison but he's gonna be tuning in to hear what he says see that that's sad

[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:08.040]
that's pathetic and a lie you don't have to tune in to see what he says because he already said

[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:13.020]
yesterday he apologizes for nothing and uh he stands by what he said and he must have said something

[00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:17.820]
right to get everybody off his stuff because he don't make mistakes you know he's like Mr. Weaver

[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:28.680]
he don't make mistakes here's Miami Beach hello hello right yes sir uh hi yeah I was calling

[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.520]
a couple things I wanted to talk about number one I mean I don't like rush and I think he's uh

[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:37.560]
you know but I don't think he's a racist to be honest with you but I don't like his

[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:42.180]
format so I've never listened to him yeah and I do believe there's definitely a double standard

[00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:47.460]
in the way they uh cover this you know like for instance we had a couple things in the paper with

[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:53.120]
dusty bakers comments and going back a little further when Isaiah Thomas made the comment about Larry

[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:58.080]
Bird you know being he's getting all the attention because he's a white guy you know people don't

[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:03.680]
seem to be offended by something like that but on the other hand every time that there's any type

[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:09.820]
of black uh remark made you know right away you know people want them to be fired and I just thought

[00:33:09.820 --> 00:33:14.820]
the guy was expressing his opinion like he does on his radio show a lot of times people agree with

[00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:19.020]
it a lot of times they owe well let me let me say this to you okay if that really is his opinion

[00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.140]
then it goes to show you that he's totally unqualified to be on a pregame show on ESPN or any

[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:29.680]
other place because the the facts that he was studying are so ludicrous the idea that number one

[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.920]
Donovan McNabb isn't a good quarterback which is bullcrap number two that the media's desperate to

[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.300]
try to prop up a good black quarterback when there were seven starting quarterbacks on Sundays

[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:42.320]
games who were black and he NFL and two who would have been starting except they were injured I mean

[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:48.280]
it's just idiotic and I mean so so to go out of it see that's not his role that's not what they

[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:53.960]
put in there for uh so to go on that national TV and to make a obnoxious inaccurate comment like

[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.140]
that they're not gonna get they're not gonna they're not ready to take the fallout from that

[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:03.760]
he's based on the press he was making a reference to that the press wanted him more than the actual

[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:08.240]
look at the case so what are you doing now is repeating exactly what he said that was his quote you

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:13.860]
repeat exactly what he said about the world the body world they all there every time there's a

[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:19.100]
white challenger there's a big thing to do with the white the gray white hope the press has a

[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:24.940]
lot to do with it I believe that the press was looking for a star black quarterback oh so

[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:29.880]
get lost you're here crazy person you know what we're hearing from now but to ditto heads oh well

[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.540]
we don't like rusher we can't stand a button these starts repeating just like that one line to give

[00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:37.620]
me a minute ago about whatever the hell was it direct quote from what he said the other day

[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.740]
the press is looking for a great black quarter and and who are these people in the press I

[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:52.980]
wondered do we know who they are no that guy there yeah bill press god almighty I mean I hear

[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.980]
some desperation to try to like defend the indefensible effect is that the guys a big bag of

[00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:02.320]
wind he talks crap there was absolutely no truth whatsoever to the statement that he made a right

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.160]
there it's like saying hey I'm not qualified to be on here I'm like some kind of a schmuck who talks

[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:10.680]
politics all the time who happens to my football on Sundays like everybody else and that's it I

[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:14.740]
don't have any idea what I'm talking about so I'll make it into some kind of a racially divisive

[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:21.040]
thing and they said oh well goodbye because like I just said they're not going to take the heat from

[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:25.520]
that kind of crap which really it goes to show it they're the ones ABC and ESPN they're the ones

[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:28.320]
who blew it because they shouldn't have put them on in the first place which I just got through

[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:33.840]
saying 20 minutes ago because they shouldn't know that something like this was going to happen was

[00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:38.520]
there any doubt no it's just a matter of time the fact that it took four weeks is the only miracle

[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:45.600]
in all this from the blow it all up they know him for what he is and what he always has been and

[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:53.660]
whether he's gigantic and fat or there he is right now in any way diminishing of anybody it's

[00:35:53.660 --> 00:36:01.900]
just an opinion and to me being honest is what's called for the situation like anybody can you know

[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:08.220]
phony it up and offer platitudes and cliches and so forth and that's not me and I figured if I'm

[00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:12.360]
going to do this I'd better be who I am and that's what they wanted and they were vigorously defending

[00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:19.260]
but what happened was that some of my cast members began to be made to feel uncomfortable by

[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.720]
the press of others who couldn't believe that they had not responded to what I said so the

[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:32.100]
path of least resistance became for me to to resign right do we believe you resign no no

[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:37.580]
don't do rest under his dress to really what that was down to is that the other people on the

[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:41.480]
show didn't want to be sitting there with his fat ass with his obnoxious disgusting ass that's

[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.440]
what it was down to I mean the guy does have a legitimate point in one sense and that is that if

[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.900]
you make a racist comment against black people in America you're certainly going to get a separate

[00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:55.320]
standard then if you make a an anti white statement a statement that somehow us but but we already

[00:36:55.320 --> 00:37:00.960]
know that going in that's an established fact and has nothing to do with the fact that this guy's

[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.940]
a long long history of being a bigoted obnoxious right wing piece of turd okay who we should let

[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.660]
me say it again shouldn't have been on there in the first place he belong there like George

[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.720]

[00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:07.780]
Drudge back in Arnold Schwarzenegger is wife and my good friend Maria Shriver are giving her

[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:12.760]
first ever interviewed together in Arnold okay right not all the stories about womanizing

[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:18.740]
absolutely and yeah I think that's pretty fair to say I mean many times many days yeah that's

[00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:24.060]
true I would never done it if I wouldn't have had to support of Maria well you know she's a

[00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:30.720]
Kennedy woman and they always look the other way right I have been bred to look the other way yeah

[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.640]
and Maria has been the best you know I'm not going to stand in your way you have to do what you

[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:41.620]
need to do Arnold on the floor and while sexual experiences when we come back okay

[00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:47.680]
here's something to come back yeah he's got a don't promise they still gonna win that's the next

[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.320]
governor of California and other women are saying hey guess what he was a grab in our ass we got

[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:54.900]
that story a little later this fast that you just said he's really pretty good it says it well

[00:39:55.620 --> 00:39:59.600]
says I fasted before about my opinions toward Rush which I know you share he just spews his right

[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:03.420]
when conservative opinions based on falsehood that audience of lemmings follows blindly

[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:07.380]
nevertheless I'm not sure why he resigned or why Disney ESPN would want him to resign he

[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.020]
wears his opinions on his sleeve they knew what they were getting into when they hired him if they

[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:15.760]
truly wanted just a regular uh Joe viewpoint of football they could have hired anybody they brought

[00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:20.240]
him in for his followers to increase ratings to compete with Fox NFL pregame show he's built the

[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.580]
audience for the things he says case in point his liberal media vashing comments this past Sunday

[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.880]
if he doesn't make these comments ESPN loses the increased audience can you imagine what the ratings

[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:33.620]
would have been this Sunday if he were still on train wreck TV that's what the what will he say next

[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:37.660]
why would ESPN not the pinnacle of high-bar journalism want that type of attention why wouldn't

[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.200]
they it says it would be different of these comments came from a different personality but they

[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.460]
were from Rush what did the public Disney or ESPN expect and that's a good fact because like I just

[00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:49.520]
said I blame not him I blame them for hiring them and putting them around the first place

[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.360]
and you know what reminds me of what when you know what it's like QAM hiring Scott

[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:59.640]
for well and putting them on for 8% huh what a tie in based on anything I see I see a perfect

[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.640]
parallel there sure they they know exactly what he does these they know his track record they know

[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.500]
the kind of radio that he does they encourage him be yourself have a good time do your thing

[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:12.720]
and then every time somebody out there far they're oh well he can't play far it's on the air he

[00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:17.040]
can't say this he can't do that because uh one or two wingnuts out there to god damn audience

[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.960]
and right away to come down on his head if you put somebody on and you say hey do your thing

[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:26.220]
and we're behind you we're gonna go with you then then you're the only ones you can blame can't

[00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:30.980]
blame my him even though I am taking great personal delight in it plus the pill story

[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.860]
no I am because if anybody deserves you are the only thing about what comes around goes around

[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:42.820]
sure that's the case with him and it's so pathetic all these ditto heads all these lemmings

[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:52.580]
what is this thing oh I know a few deer rush how about a nice big cup of shot the F up I think

[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:58.300]
before you say something stupid love Donovan McNamara I think you could point out of ensure

[00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:04.200]
lighten up a little bit since yesterday didn't like them at night have a lovely head hard

love the eyes smell real good asshole just like your asshole and by the way thanks for listening

[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:36.620]
to the number one rated Neil Rogers show that beats rush air be damn book and has for years here's

[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:42.080]
pepper of pine hello hey Neil you're absolutely right on this rush thing but it's more than it's

[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:48.020]
more than just red next it's those red states going back to the 2011 right right that's what I was

[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:53.060]
talking about just look at the map the ideas and ideals of rush with those followers from those red

[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:58.320]
states that's how my uncle Sidney went to Germany his uncle Sidney and came out of the lampshade this

[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:06.860]
is the process it's disgusting yeah these guys ideals are you know rushes poison out there and

[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.300]
yes being I don't know what they were getting in through well like I said if they wanted to put

[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.820]
them on in the first place they should know that was going to hit the jackpot and other like you know

[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:20.120]
have on their pants and have a great day and say hi to uncle Sidney by the way when you turn the lights

[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:26.940]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 to see the thing of it is this business all the media was trying to

[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:31.920]
I mean any kind of a moron that would say that and they're just quoting him which all the right

[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:35.780]
wingers do by the way this quote whatever is in the latest pamphlet or latest the thing in the

[00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:40.340]
paper from the right wing hero they that's why they come ditto heads let me say it again Donna

[00:43:40.340 --> 00:43:45.160]
Bade McNeath was to three straight pro balls took consecutive NFC championship games he was

[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.960]
finalist for the NFL MVP award his first full season is a starting quarterback and yet that wow

[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:53.080]
no it's the media trying to make them look good because they want to their desperate to try to make

[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:58.080]
a black quarterback look good just on the face of it you've got to be a moron to make a statement

[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:04.440]
like that so obviously it was contrived and maybe maybe this is what he thought they wanted him to

[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:08.280]
do who the hell knows you know why else would they put them on there this is that they're be cast

[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:14.180]
or milked oh no so even though it may sound like I'm defending him which I find like I want to choke

[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.260]
on it trying to do that but the fact of the matter is I don't blame him I blame them for putting his

[00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.960]
ass on or it ludicrous everyone they were talking about it last year in fact they were going to

[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:28.060]
put him on instead of Dennis Miller on ABC remember that yes and then they decided not of course ABC

[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:34.140]
and the SPN are the same anyway just desperate for another Howard Coastel ain't gonna happen once in

[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:42.400]
a in a in a blue moon maybe once in history comes along guy like Howard Coastel don't tell Dave Johnson

[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.540]
okay here's Dante in focus is you probably were going to do it already but please read the

[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:51.280]
rush articles over the record music I love it oh okay well yeah when we get to the pill one

[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:57.040]
here's one that says Rush Limbaugh deserves to be publicly punished but I find totally unfairs

[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:01.380]
that he's held accountable for a sports commentary he's a total abomination but once again his

[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.300]
spew to his trivialize compared to what he's done in the past he needed to be publicly chastised

[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:09.440]
humiliated for his political propaganda as it took place in the political arena but America couldn't

[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.380]
seem to pay does this is a good point America couldn't seem to pay attention to his venom until

[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.040]
it appeared in the sports entertainment arena just this would have been much better served if he

[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.380]
had been taken down in the real world arena that's the American effin way that's a great facts thank

[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:28.120]
you good point excellent day man yeah and I'm not stupid guy not even during a ballgame on a

[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:35.540]
pre-game show on a cable network ESPN which is watched by a few million a good beer guzzling goofballs

[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:41.920]
like Scott 145 votes on this pool with the marlins in the playoffs and after a great season what's

[00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:47.300]
your take honest answers please I'm a recent fan nine pain you like still don't give a shmit

[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:52.760]
about sports 22 I'm just jumping on a bad wagon 31 thanks for your refreshing honesty it's a

[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:58.140]
breath of a stale air I don't give a crap about the marlins 32 and I've been a real fan all along

[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:07.320]
51 35.1% do we believe that no you believe that no 35% of this audience and because we've done

[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:12.820]
these polls before now where were the real fans then that 35.1% of this audience was really Marlon

[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.900]
fans does anybody with an IQ larger than their scroat believe that no no no it's more than the stadium

[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:23.220]
holds you're you're right that's right well they but yeah now you're assuming that they think being

[00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.720]
a real fan means they actually pay for it they can take this means that they watch it for free on

[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:32.860]
TV like in sarnia believes you know what I'm sure you're real fan not that you lend your tangles

[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:38.300]
to support let's see here's the one that says facts rush it's got it's spelled out the letters

[00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:45.460]
rush daddy for right wing you uber s Schmidt Schmidt head right wing uber Schmidt head that's

[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:52.400]
pretty good or should it be right wing a goober Schmidt head goober I like it our other poll after

[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.140]
we get the board with this one later it's going to be someone you think is an asshole but you

[00:46:57.140 --> 00:47:01.440]
enjoy their work now maybe rush will make that we'll have to wait to see if anybody nominates him

[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:06.440]
somebody you think is an asshole but you enjoy the work I made a short list of four and a new

[00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:15.300]
added one I did Clark Richard Dawson Neil Rogers Mohawar David and Billy Bob Thornton was yours

[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:19.920]
right so we'll get to that eventually as soon as we get tired of the Marlon thing as soon as

[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:26.880]
the quick line I mean we spun you that question here's a lady and Davie hello hi I cannot believe

[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:32.680]
how hypocritical you're being when you talk about convolisa rice like you do yeah I think that's

[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:38.200]
insane you sit there and say she's a she's a token higher she's a schwa the way you talk all the time

[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.680]
you think you could have been on that show and that's what I think I can't read you my hysterical

[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.220]
right wing friend and I have no idea why you listen to this radio show but let me say it anyway

[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:50.980]
no I listen to you because why I'm not a lot to listen to you no no I want but we obviously

[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:57.960]
make a choice why do you listen hey I was in the car no no no no we haven't talked about

[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:04.280]
I think I think it's extraordinary what do you listen to this show you think that you could

[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:11.320]
have done I win them it's a very simple question why do you choose why do you calm down and take

[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:17.260]
a breath you hysterical crazy person why do you choose to listen to this program I listen to it

[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:20.660]
because I listen to all points of you am I not allowed to do that well first of all the

[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:24.920]
convolisa thing isn't just a point of view it's a satire the song was a satire okay but there's

[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:30.080]
truth that you you swore to very easily you get all the time I only use I use a lot of words

[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:36.100]
because this is a part of the show is a comedy show and you are just because you know you're

[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.860]
you know you're I don't get that if you're if you were a lot and you just weren't if you said

[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:48.500]
that thing you would be a racist but it's comedy you know what lady you are hysterical take

[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.160]
to get to from rush okay give a couple of them pills pop it all we don't stand up because they

[00:48:53.160 --> 00:49:00.700]
have a habit of falling out god man oh man that makes me so happy to be a fag if you had any idea

[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:07.360]
shrill hysterical women just foaming at the mouth good god I think they're doing the

[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.360]
daisy chain thing is that what it is they're calling each other out they never listen oh I don't

[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.280]
know but no but she listens you know and I even mentioned the kind of leas of thing yesterday and

[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:21.900]
it's a classic example we get pressured like you wouldn't even believe to take that thing off the

[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.180]
ear and also that kiss and nigger good morning which was a parody based on that book on nigger which

[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:30.820]
was written by the prophet the Kennedy professor from Harvard who happened to be a black guy Randall

[00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:37.080]
Kennedy or whatever his name was wasn't that it yeah but oh no you're being racist the audience

[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:40.500]
I've been under here for almost 30 years in his town the audience knows why I use these words

[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:44.840]
and what the point is because the more you use the word I put you the submitted times you de-sensitize

[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:49.280]
it doesn't make it a weapon anymore if you hear a word over and over again words don't kill anybody okay

[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:57.600]
words don't kill anybody kikes do that was George words don't kill anybody's fix too

[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:04.780]
at any rate boy she is just out of control oh you're being so critical about it if she was

[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.920]
starting to get so sure I thought she was been like break the goddamn speakers and everybody's

[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:14.640]
radio just take two of them good pills like rush alone you some of them oxy-contains and calm down

[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.700]
okay it'll make the pain go away which we had something to pop right now make the pain of her

[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.780]
hysteria go away I'll just like hot it you have any idea how hypercudy means it I can't believe it

[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:37.660]

[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:35.420]
too you know right for some people maybe a lot of shocks for the oj master probably when he

[01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:40.060]
smelled scrure and two of that guilty and that must have been a shock wow we had one disagreement

[01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:43.520]
over the year about a book he did for money he said he explained it to me i understood that we put

[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.660]
it aside Simpson added bob was there when i needed him most when Simpson failed like

[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:55.460]
oh oh when Simpson failed to turn himself into authorities to face murder charges June 1794

[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:00.000]
it was Kardashian who went before tv cameras and read an emotional letter from his longtime friend

[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:04.620]
it read in part i've had a great life great friends please think of the real oj and not this

[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.600]
lost person is what he'd be saying i remember don't you remember that like you weirdly

[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.300]

[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:41.740]
slow-speed chase that ended at Simpson's Brentwood homework was taken into custody oh man kardashian

[01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:46.080]
stood alongside Simpson the rest of his attorneys when the not guilty verdicts were read October

[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:52.380]
3rd 95 to some observers kardashian appeared to have a look of disbelief on his face as if to say

[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:57.080]
oh man and in years later kardashian said he questioned whether Simpson was involved in the two

[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.920]
stabbing deaths when kardashian was headed to Simpson's defense team there was speculation

[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:05.060]
that it was so he would not be forced to testify against his friend something that would have

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.600]
violated the attorney client privilege and there was one other album sure there were many of these

[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:14.180]
stories but one of the stories i read said that in later years they like uh hated each other like

[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:18.240]
poison because kardashian wrote a book in which i read the book basically said the oj done it

[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:23.920]
oh man is what it was but oj says oh no i love bobby and yada yada all of a

[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.160]
it's the world according to oj just like the world according to rush and all the other right wing

[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:32.960]
ditto heads that bitch man i guarantee you this i like to hear all the few points he listens to

[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:38.520]
the show every single day she's listening right now and before this rush thing did she ever call

[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:45.620]

[01:02:45.620 --> 01:02:50.220]
sudden let's change the focus focus on the hypocrite because i'm talking about first of all anybody

[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:54.340]

[01:02:54.340 --> 01:03:00.200]
moron okay a moron absolutely right and she gets it she just don't want to get it she's just

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:04.400]

[01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:18.840]
would have liked him up a little bit few shades and i'll say it again as much as i'd be

[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:23.960]
testing despised him and the people of ditto heads who are the lemmings who follow his bullcrap

[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:34.980]
those who protest allowed us to have the most to hide need you are truly good when you coming to

[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:39.120]
north field park water cases waiting for you he's a case alright and i'm not feeling a

[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.680]
number two whoops it says please don't mention conspiracy theory must be coincidental that the

[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.520]
overused rush limbaugh is self-destructing with the assistance of a deep-throw drug source

[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:53.380]
it is on vitriolic ray errantings looks like the running scared regime doesn't need him no mo

[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:59.200]
the whole scenario looks very eerie just a case of vultures swooping in to pick the bones shades of

[01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:04.240]
gay Edgar Hoover get to dark secrets and save them until he did it says okay let's get the final

[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.940]
result on this poll then let's smith can it and get out of the important one about the someone

[01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:12.100]
you think is an asshole but you enjoy their work i like that poll yep i mean i like the other

[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.920]
one too because i think it's revealing 241 votes with marlin's in the playoffs after great

[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:20.880]
season what's your take they beat the giants nine five yesterday they need to win one out two

[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.900]
out there and they did kick their ass i've been a real fan all along eighty one thirty two point six

[01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.200]
percent right i'm just jumping on a bandwagon sixty one twenty four and a half percent okay

[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.720]
hop aboard i don't give a crap about the marlin's sixty twenty four point one percent

[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.240]
hey neal i still don't give a shmit about sports thirty one twelve and a half percent

[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.100]
and i'm a recent fan fifteen six percent of two forty eight okay let's get rid of that

[01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:49.480]
i think we get the message there right we had a lot of honest people we had the whole bunch that

[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:54.660]
i'm jumping out of bad wagon sixty one i wasn't second place even which is good why not how

[01:07:54.660 --> 01:08:03.540]
it's a soft floor to f and y why not here's a call from del re b hello oh my well long wait oh my

[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:08.280]
hey i tell you that chick man she was vibrating and that was something to listen to

[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:16.540]
me oh my oh my she was really hyped up yeah mom with that real frenzy i find this whole thing

[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:20.060]
so interesting you know it's like yeah with rush limbaugh now you know it's like in the

[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.000]
beta a guy out here basically i clean pool for living and i'm just looking for entertainment in

[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.500]
my headset yeah i'm glad you know if interesting me because at twelve noon i'm going to switch over

[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:33.100]
and listen to him and see what the hell he's got to say because it's gonna be you know interesting

[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.960]
and i do that a lot of times i think a lot of people or maybe not a lot of people when you look

[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:41.840]
at what happened to rush you know and this kind of extreme right wing stuff that he spews and

[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.400]
i listen to that and i listen to you you've got your same loot you know losers on your side too

[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.500]
you know what i mean i mean have i ever said anything positive about the call in audience what

[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:55.120]
have i ever said that no but i'm just saying it's an interesting thing but you know i look at it

[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.460]
from the center and i see both sides you know when i at the end of the day i hear something

[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:04.420]
with something you said i know that it's you know out of control and ridiculous to like like what

[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:10.240]
well just for my political view being in the middle some of the stuff on the left is so extreme

[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:15.380]
you say some of your anti bush bashing is a little heavy so do me an example i don't want to be

[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:20.560]
specific and same with what i don't want to be specific then what does it mean well i mean i

[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:24.800]
see let me tell you the biggest difference i don't just make things up out of thin air and then

[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:28.900]
put them on your like their fact no i know but your opinion of George bush is that he's a

[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:34.460]
raging moron and all those right i don't think that's my opinion i think that's a well-documented fact

[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:38.980]
and it's rush limbaugh's opinion what he said which is a lot of extreme crap it's on the

[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:42.920]
stitch it's on a different you know side of the coin you guys are like the clinton's murdering all

[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:47.540]
those people of instaustion and other people but that you don't see the difference uh

[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.920]
so i don't know no i was not at the end of the day i try to put everything together and have my

[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.840]
own point of view about it and laugh it was a fake i went on the year i if i knew your name and i

[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.800]
went on the year tomorrow i said that you killed your wife and five other people in cold blood

[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:04.520]
uh you you wouldn't have any problem with that i just made it up but i don't think that rush really

[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.600]
said that i mean when you listen to it yes he did say it yes he did say it many times

[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.260]
uh like i said that i don't know i don't believe that but he really said it the way that he was

[01:10:14.260 --> 01:10:17.960]
i was saying so again you call me a liar so i'm not i'm not interested in talking to you i'm not

[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.620]
to waste my time you're a ditto head you don't believe rush would say that see i know we have people

[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:27.840]
who turn over back and forth we have radio groupies we don't have like all loyal niles out there

[01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.280]
we'll listen to this program and it's smoothly to anything else and it's a free country listen to

[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.380]
whatever you want i don't care i mean i do care but it's nothing i can do about it but why anybody

[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:39.720]
to the length of a till of a hundred waste any time listening to his craft because it's so

[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:44.880]
predictable and so ponderous and so reprimandentious what's the point now like he said a lot of people

[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:49.580]
will turn over at noon today just like they did yesterday actually that this morning oh yeah well

[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:53.560]
you know so maybe maybe that was all contrived maybe this was part of the whole game plan

[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:57.380]
who the hell knows i guarantee the pill story wasn't part of the game plan

[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.900]
but i mean if he can't see the difference between going on here and accusing people of

[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.440]
being cold blooded and murderers and making up stuff that that whole thing about the

[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.200]
Arkansas business he was involved in that along with misfudge and all these other goddamn liars

[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:16.400]
just make up a whole bunch of stuff about the Clintons okay it's obsessive compulsive

[01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:21.400]
and as far as my talking about this president the bush being a dottering moron that's not an

[01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:28.920]
opinion some matter of fact just like it's a matter of fact that there aren't any weapons of

[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.600]
mass destruction just like it's a fact that Sodom had nothing to do with 9-11 just like it's

[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.320]
a fact that Alcada had nothing to do with Sodom and still doesn't and won't i mean you know but

[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.300]
don't confuse this guy with a fact i mean he just you know keep keep cleaning the pools man you're

[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:48.120]
in the right line of work because he's in the he listens to that radio assessment pool so he's

[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.240]
obviously it's right up his alley here's Maria from Syracuse where we're getting faxes from all

[01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:57.560]
over America today it's amazing you're looking at this wrong it only took ESPN one month to get

[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:03.680]
Russia off the year for good great job ESPN and it says love down a bit of internet nice go on Maria

[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:09.600]
good point no i don't i don't think you ought to be off here i think anybody's got a right to be

[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:12.820]
on here if they can get a gig going if they can make money because that's what it's all about we're

[01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:16.180]
a whore business and i'm the only guy that's going to be honest enough to tell you that we're a

[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:21.780]
whore business we're here to make money i'd here to save the world on a goddamn radio show

[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.520]
but just to make up a bunch of freaking lies and like we said the alfraykin book uh...

[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.160]
russian limbaugh is a big fat liar and and he documents it all right in there it's been out

[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:34.680]
for a long time so this last guy if he thinks that i'm a liar and i'm just making these things up

[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:38.000]
you're entitled that opinion but maybe do a little read he has somebody read it to you while you're

[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.100]
cleaning the pools where you got that squeegee going around about them and they have tapes on audio

[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:47.320]
you know that would be bright up his alley here's port saint lucy hello

[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:55.620]
hello russian ill right here especially i wanted to know that i wanted to say i

[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:00.560]
find which is common uh... you know racially insensitive but the question i wanted to ask you

[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:04.920]
no wait wait a minute they weren't just racially insensitive they were wrong like most of what he says

[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:08.640]
they're bull crap you don't think there's a possibility that it's true

[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.380]
that the media's tried to uh... to make a black quarterback look good but there's all a black

[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:17.200]
star quarterbacks that are in heaven and league no of course not

[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:23.400]
okay i think that there's a possibility that that's true that based on what

[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:29.560]
i think media have have a gender media had a genders with the uh... new york times

[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:34.900]
and uh... so i like i like you to give me one piece of media i would like you to give me one

[01:13:34.900 --> 01:13:39.760]
piece of evidence that suggests the media has some acstic rod on behalf of donovan mcnav

[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.740]
or any other black quarterback in the NFL

[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:47.500]
yeah i think that's a good thing sir are you a football fan

[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:53.800]
i think i'm football fan you're a white big time yeah and you think that donovan mcnav is not a good

[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:57.800]
quarterback i think that he is a average quarterback

[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.800]
yeah oh my but that wasn't what i wanted to ask you i wasn't my question now

[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:06.260]
thank god okay let's get to the real let's get to the meat

[01:14:06.260 --> 01:14:11.840]
not the meat of the question is um... if russian's held accountable uh... for this why aren't

[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:16.880]
people like dusty baker held accountable for their comments saying that white people can uh...

[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:21.720]
take the heat and black people black skin that's that's that's worse as far as racially

[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.180]
in says that in sense of the situation they should be they should be okay that's the only

[01:14:27.180 --> 01:14:29.280]
thing i have uh... what rush to know

[01:14:29.900 --> 01:14:33.440]
historically looking at it when he's coming to our uh...

[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.100]
are done

[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:37.640]
see let me take you against your all of it this crowd that were here getting

[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:40.600]
calling in the day you seem to resist one fact what he said was

[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:45.580]
flagrantly untrue there is a one shred of evidence that anybody in the media

[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:48.720]
is out to make donovan mcnav to build him up to make him into a great quarterback

[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.920]
because the media has this

[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:54.160]
come up see this is part of the same psychosis the same paranoia about the

[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.360]
liberal media and of course there is no liberal media anymore

[01:14:57.620 --> 01:15:00.300]
the same bull crap that they've been feeding your free years read the air

[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:03.340]
alternate book what live a liberal media there is no liberal media anymore

[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:07.620]
you got fox and you got the clear channel you got nothing but right wing

[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:11.100]
lunatics who want to control everything now with the help and uh... assistance of

[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.140]
their crony michael paul all the other right wingers are controlled the fcc

[01:15:14.140 --> 01:15:15.340]
in the goddamn government

[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:21.640]
uh... it's you know you can't you can have a discussion with people have a closed

[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.800]
mind with people who just believe any crap that somebody says

[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:30.700]
we like me going on here to answer in uh... well i think that the election is

[01:15:30.700 --> 01:15:34.120]
gonna be fixed next time and it no matter what you vote it's gonna come out the

[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.160]
in favor of uh... what whatever side i want to uh... say is going to do it

[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.720]
by the way you know what i think

[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:45.180]
the election might be fixed well i mean if they did the first time maybe that's a

[01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:48.700]
bad example twenty seven past eleven and five sixty year fixation

[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:49.360]
wc

[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:49.800]
uh...

[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.620]
five

[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:51.040]
you

[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:04.400]
she's more annoying than catholic it

[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.940]
but why someone hired her is downright absurd

[01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.740]
she has to be the focus constantly

[01:16:11.260 --> 01:16:12.700]
she's like a kid screaming

[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:17.840]
and i think

[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:20.400]
her eyes go through me like razor sharp needles

[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:23.040]
she thinks she's bigger than the freaking

[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:23.780]
he goes

[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:26.740]
pressing around like some whack jow on track

[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:30.040]
we should send a le went to i-rack

[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.820]
she's lost her mind just like that in the case fairer

[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:37.960]
like a cartoon from hanna and barfara

[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.360]
i feel so bad for her co-host jack fjord

[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.200]
сок's isn't like my

[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.280]
why

[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:52.360]
it

[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:06.080]
eleven thirteen one five six

[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:06.880]
fifty inside

[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:12.280]
So here we have the big thing today. We have the big van hit moon to two. It's a big thing.

[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:16.160]
Joe Costello is going to be there and Miguel will be there. They'll be at where?

[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:21.140]
At Riveonaha 3671 North-XI Highway in Pompeo Beach. Pompeo Beach with our best

[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:27.600]
in the LCDs and Mohawar David of Keychains and some Jim Mandage of Mad Dog Keychains left over,

[01:17:27.620 --> 01:17:32.060]
which we have. And here's the deal. Like I've got five parotickets to the Alice Cooper in concert at

[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:36.480]
Pompeo Beach Theatre, amphitheater, and eight parotickets to the Panther Lightning game at the

[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.560]
Yenthys Center Saturday the 4th to the first 13 folks who will make a donation to abandon

[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:46.600]
paroscutes. It's a great cause even if you hate me like poison, which I'm amused. I'm proud to

[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:49.920]
say I'm number one in the poll so far. I'm delighted. I'm noticing that. Well, no, I'm the

[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:55.080]
Apple myself honored and bother me. 21 votes. Someone you think is an asshole but enjoy their work.

[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:59.980]
Neil Rogers 8, Dick Clark 5, Billy Bob Thornton 4, Richard Dawson 2, Mohawar David 2.

[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.860]
See, because there's someone you think is an asshole but you enjoy their work. Say, right?

[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:10.440]
There might be other people on there that they think is an asshole. Absolutely. But they don't necessarily enjoy their work.

[01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.420]
So we can add a whole bunch of names to that or not as the case may be or we can continue hearing

[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.700]
from ditto heads until noon when the whole audience will turn over to. La, tada, tada, and you know,

[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.020]
hear all of that. Well, that's the call. Let me just read this again. I mean, for the umpteenth time,

[01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:27.580]
Donovan McNabb has been to three straight pro bowls. Two consecutive NFC championship games

[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:32.160]
was a fun list for NFL MVP award. This first full season is a starter in this last

[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:38.200]
Bozo. This last job only says, Oh, he's uh, what was the word fair? He's average. Yeah, it's just

[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:43.440]
average. And the media has some secret hidden agenda, the liberal media because he's black to make

[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:51.120]
him look like a superstar. Right. Here's Pember Pine. Hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Okay, sir. Hey,

[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:56.880]
listen, I talk on a very crystal clear to me now. Reason Russia still pissed off at Clinton is

[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:01.360]
why Clinton was getting a little action in the White House rushes in the closet pops in a

[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.140]
hot pop and offy cotton and can't get it up. So he's a get in the action for the last three years.

[01:19:06.460 --> 01:19:10.880]
Exactly. What a piece of crap. And we're all these ditto heads coming in from.

[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.240]
Where they'll come up from in the right coast. They're coming in from the right coast.

[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.640]
Well, goes around comes around man. I got I love it. I love it. I love it. Keep squeezing it man.

[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:25.760]
We'll do, baby. I'll ride me to. We'll do me to. Yeah, we're squeezing it. All those of us are

[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:29.840]
just so refreshing. What a breath of fresh air to see these people squirming and twisting.

[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.120]
And they listen to their lame, lame ass defensiveness. I mean, to try to turn it around again and say,

[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.220]
oh, well, you know, dusty bakers, of course, it's always been that way. It's not politically

[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:44.560]
correct in America for, you know, to attack black people for talking and knocking the crackers,

[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:49.480]
honkeys, whatever. There should be equal standard there, but there's not. But in the meantime,

[01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:54.360]
he's and I'll just repeating myself because I'm foaming at them out. That's worth repeating.

[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:59.540]
It would be like it. It would be like if NBC fired Tom Brokaw because he's like got a bad speech

[01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:03.280]
impediment. He's so in coherent. Nobody can understand what he's saying. And they put Aussie Osborne

[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:09.080]
on there to do the NBC nightly news. And and the very first night, he's out for like 30 seconds.

[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:14.700]
And so all of a sudden they call the headhunch was an NBC. Oh, can you believe Ozzy just said the

[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:21.340]
F word live right in the middle of the NBC. Yeah. What a surprise. Huh? What's all this shock

[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:27.600]
about? They put him on there and he excuse a bunch of right wing bull crap racist hate. And

[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:33.260]
there's a shot. We need to talk to. Yeah, get this all straightened up. Look at the bottom of it.

[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:40.720]
X priest sentenced to five to seven years in prison for raping girls in Worcester, Mass.

[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:46.920]
A former Leo Minster priest was sentenced yesterday to five to seven years in prison for

[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:52.680]
raping two young girls in the early 1980s. It was the second child molestation conviction in

[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.540]
prison sentence for Robert E. Kelly 61 of Worcester. Kelly who hasn't served as a priest since 85

[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:01.940]
admitted a decade ago to attempt to rape another young girl in the 80s. It was released from prison

[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:08.000]
on those charges in 97. Kelly pleaded guilty last month to six counts of child rape. He admitted

[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:14.580]
to abusing the girls who were between the eight oh between the ages of six and 10 between

[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:21.580]
1980 and 86. The abuse happened while Kelly was a priest at St. Cecilia's parish in Leo Minster and

[01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:25.740]
Sacred Heart Parish in Garden, according to Worcester District Attorney John Coney. Worcester

[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:30.700]
superior court judge John S. McCann also ordered Kelly to serve 20 years probation following his

[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:35.380]
prison sentence. He was banned from servings of prison 85 following allegations of child abuse

[01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:38.960]
according to Worcester Roman Catholic diocese. Our thoughts and prayers are first and foremost with

[01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:43.900]
the victims Bishop Daniel P. Riley said. He also asked for prayers for Kelly and for the Kelly

[01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:49.220]
families they watch him go to prison once again. With I. C.s. of Worcester will continue to make every

[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:53.480]
effort as an institution to provide safe environments to children our care the Bishop said. Anybody

[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:57.180]
believe him? No, no. We don't believe it. It's got a way to Pope A looking too good.

[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.120]
So well, looks good. They're going to start blowing smoke over there one of these days soon. You

[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.080]
ale minnes is an excuse for the pills. Of course the fact that this doesn't jive with his credo

[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:21.940]
of personal responsibility and his standing as medical bearer want to want to affect the morons

[01:22:21.940 --> 01:22:26.020]

Seat.

[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:21.820]
Bill and four Lauderdale says I have a 14-inch erection this morning when I heard the rush

[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:22.160]
news.

[01:30:23.020 --> 01:30:26.000]
It turned a bleak Thursday morning into a beautiful day, your right, Bill.

[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:29.640]
I'm very curious to hear what he has to say about the situation but I'm not sure he'll

[01:30:29.640 --> 01:30:33.000]
be live on the year today with the keynote speaker at NAB convention this morning, Phil

[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.480]
Fadalpia, which we just saw where he just mentioned as an aside something about the ESPN

[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.640]
matter, but he said absolutely nothing about the drugs as if it didn't even exist in

[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:40.140]
the news today.

[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:43.000]
So I don't know if he'd make it back to his studio to be live at noon.

[01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:47.820]
I'm just so thrilled that that fat pompous racist typical Nazi bastards been exposed

[01:30:47.820 --> 01:30:51.600]
as the same type of exact type of individual he continually persecutes.

[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:53.120]
PS for the pool.

[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.020]
I'm embarrassed to say it, but Michael Jackson had the good choice, Bill.

[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:56.640]
Yes, it is.

[01:30:56.640 --> 01:30:56.740]
Huh?

[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:01.620]
People who like Michael Jackson's music, but they think he's a pedophile and an asshole and

[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:05.560]
obnoxious and a baby jeopardizer hanging at a poor little baby.

[01:31:05.720 --> 01:31:05.920]
Huh?

[01:31:06.140 --> 01:31:06.960]
Baby jeopardizer.

[01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:07.540]
That's right.

[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.880]
So let's pull Michael Jackson and receive.

[01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:14.760]
He can give me some stiff competition because I'm way ahead of the field, biggest asshole,

[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:16.160]
even though they enjoy my work.

[01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.580]
I got 29 votes.

[01:31:17.820 --> 01:31:20.160]
Moe has got 11, Dick Clark 11, so I'm way ahead.

[01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:24.320]
Philly Bob Thorton 9, Richard Dawson 5, and Michael Jackson just went up.

[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:24.980]
He's got the big.

[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:26.820]
So far.

[01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.020]
Here's a call from Overtown.

[01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:30.280]

[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:31.540]
Yeah, God.

[01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.080]
Yes, sir.

[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:34.720]
Listen to you forgot on a 25 years.

[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.700]
I've called my father.

[01:31:35.700 --> 01:31:36.280]
Oh, man.

[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:39.820]
Now, here's the problem I have with this whole situation.

[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:40.480]
Go right ahead.

[01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:42.220]
I'm going to draw you a parallel.

[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:47.260]
The friend of mine is a police officer supervisor and he told me he's going to fight

[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.960]
sting, which of course we hate to hear that, but he's realist.

[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:50.960]
He's working a fight sting.

[01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:55.980]
And in the same day that he arrested his 10th grade math teacher, he arrested his

[01:31:55.980 --> 01:31:58.440]
test grade English teacher in the same fight sting.

[01:31:59.020 --> 01:31:59.340]
Yeah.

[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:04.980]
I have a problem with people that are supposed to be something.

[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:06.700]
Then they say there's something.

[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:10.520]
And then, you know, they put the excerpt way and be a certain way, but they're actually

[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:11.300]
some way out.

[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:16.160]
You can do almost anything you want in the world, but you just can't be out there trying

[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.240]
to make money, be in Hollywood about it.

[01:32:18.780 --> 01:32:19.680]
It's just not really.

[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:21.880]
These are the people who say don't do what I do.

[01:32:22.040 --> 01:32:22.820]
Do what I say.

[01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.100]
They talk a good game, but their own lives are nothing but a bunch of crap.

[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:30.320]
I just spent the whole morning in a training session to work in the elementary schools,

[01:32:30.580 --> 01:32:31.760]
business in the elementary schools.

[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:35.020]
And there's the background screening and this and that.

[01:32:35.780 --> 01:32:39.860]
And the bottom line is what everyone's saying, teachers, principals, government, even

[01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:43.040]
parents, is that they need more people involved in the schools.

[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.060]
They need more people involved in children's lives.

[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.120]
Meanwhile, Russia's involved in people's lives.

[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:49.320]
You're involved in people's lives.

[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:50.020]
Everyone is.

[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.080]
And to be something that you're not and to profit from it, you just need to find another

[01:32:54.080 --> 01:32:54.860]
way to make a living.

[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.200]
It's just not right to set that example.

[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:57.820]
Our children.

[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.560]
Well, now you're losing me.

[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:03.720]
What does Russia have to do with sending an example for our children?

[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.320]
What does that mean?

[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:05.800]
People's parents.

[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.100]
They're Russia's role model.

[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:08.360]
They follow them.

[01:33:08.820 --> 01:33:09.740]
They listen to him.

[01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:15.720]
They incorporate those things that they say that Russia speaks into their everyday activities.

[01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:21.020]
If they discriminate, if they feel this way about the poor, if they feel this way about

[01:33:21.020 --> 01:33:24.480]
the rich, there's a lot of different things that we all influence there.

[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:26.020]
I'm influenced by people somebody right now.

[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:29.980]
I think that the part that bothers me the most, just like Jeff Bush would have screwed

[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:35.340]
up family with his drug addicted daughter and all the other and his lying wife that smugglers

[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:37.220]
and stuff they would have to report it.

[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.940]
If you're going to be a holier than now, just like George W. Just like the president of

[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:44.780]
Born Again, Christian, he would never lie to us.

[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.380]
He's going to bring morality back to the White House.

[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:49.860]
In the meantime, all these kids are getting killed over the air every day for a war based

[01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:53.040]
on nothing but big money for Beth Helen Hallebert and all their guy, Dan Friends, and Big

[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:56.080]
Business, and they lied to us about the biggest things of all.

[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:57.500]
I mean, about people's lives.

[01:33:57.660 --> 01:33:58.520]
You tell us.

[01:33:58.940 --> 01:33:59.760]
And have a great day.

[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.480]
That's what it boils down to.

[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:06.080]
Don't be a guy that's more holier than now, better than everybody else.

[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:09.240]
And like me, I tell you I have an old pervert fag.

[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:10.060]
That's me, okay?

[01:34:10.340 --> 01:34:10.900]
Proud of it.

[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:12.140]
They go apologies for it.

[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:12.840]
I don't harm anybody.

[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:14.280]
I don't mess with little children.

[01:34:14.460 --> 01:34:14.880]
That's it.

[01:34:16.340 --> 01:34:18.400]
But this business of coming on air will on better.

[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:20.500]
It's like this whole Born Again Christian thing, man.

[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.520]
And it's so vulgar and so vile.

[01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:25.660]
And don't confuse these people with the facts.

[01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:27.960]
Well, we're just trying to spread the word and save your soul.

[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:28.960]
Yeah, save it.

[01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:30.720]
Save the bullcrap.

[01:34:30.900 --> 01:34:31.700]
Don't save my soul.

[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:32.940]
Save the bullcrap, okay?

[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:35.820]
Because once they save your ass on the ground, that's it.

[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.800]
That's finito bonito.

[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:38.300]
And by the way, they didn't hang him in Rome.

[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:39.920]
Nobody appeared there.

[01:34:40.660 --> 01:34:42.660]
He made a cameo there.

[01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:44.240]
That's how I remember it.

[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.380]
Yeah, in Rome.

[01:34:45.860 --> 01:34:48.980]
And this is a fax, this long fax from this fag, Zoli in North Miami.

[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:51.280]
Save it a fax paper, okay?

[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:52.220]
You're out of control.

[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:53.300]
He's got the hats for Scott.

[01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:55.800]
Well, got to be Scott in your type, okay?

[01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.940]
I just got Eric a figure.

[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:57.840]
What?

[01:34:58.060 --> 01:35:01.220]
I just put Eric a picture ought to be showing up on the website with what?

[01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:01.880]
Of Scott.

[01:35:03.300 --> 01:35:03.700]
Yeah.

[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.740]
Oh, Scott's like human looking.

[01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:07.100]
Okay.

[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:07.860]
What?

[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:08.740]
You don't think so?

[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:09.940]
He's like a Martian.

[01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:12.740]
You think Scott is looks like a Martian?

[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:14.960]
And then when he takes his glasses off, it's even worse.

[01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:15.920]
Hmm.

[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:18.120]
He's my favorite Martian.

[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.400]
Of course I don't.

[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:20.300]
I don't know any other.

[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.020]
No, I thought he looked almost human, considering what we got in a building.

[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:27.520]
I wouldn't say he's going to create it on the Zoli.

[01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:29.920]
Yeah, but at least only have the hats for anything that then moved.

[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:30.620]
It's got a penis.

[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.100]
Although we haven't checked that out yet.

[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:35.000]
Well, that's the for real worry about that poor for real man.

[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.960]
He's really under he's taking a lot of crap.

[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:37.960]
This is me off.

[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:38.700]
Can you believe that?

[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:41.380]
He's doing such a great job for us and everything is coming along.

[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:44.040]
See, this is the thing, if you and if things start going too well,

[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.880]
then they start crumbling at the scene, then they still can open out of shape.

[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.420]
Yeah.

[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:50.800]
Here's a call from Coral Gebels.

[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:51.100]
Hello.

[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:52.240]
Keep making excuses.

[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.140]
They make excuses for you being an asshole.

[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:56.000]
I won't do a no-mo.

[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:57.820]
I'm not making those excuses for your behavior, no-mo.

[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:58.720]
Okay, asshole.

[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:01.500]
Peep, peep, peep, peep, peep.

[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:02.400]
I'm airy day.

[01:36:02.540 --> 01:36:05.060]
Airy day, just like clockwork, just like that pixel they called me for.

[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.220]
Oh, I'd like to listen to all points of you.

[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:08.900]
You're a chronic listener, honey.

[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:10.460]
You've got to turn up so loud.

[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.140]
Maybe that's why she was getting them good vibrations.

[01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:14.080]
Good.

[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.100]
Golly Miss Molly.

[01:36:15.100 --> 01:36:18.200]
She was so hysterical, she sounded like Linda Lovelace and drag.

[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.400]
Maybe she's dragging it.

[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.660]
Little Playboy TV here fits in.

[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:28.580]
Don't say anything, honey.

[01:36:29.100 --> 01:36:30.420]
It's a wild bike scene.

[01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.420]
People say it looks like they're like, it looks like she's having lunch.

[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:36.040]
A game by game.

[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:37.740]
What?

[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:38.380]

[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:44.400]
Oh dear, those slurping sounds, she's having a slurpy for lunch.

[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:51.900]
Can I ask you a question?

[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:55.000]
Did I comment on this cartoon the first time that you sent it to me?

[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:56.260]
No, no, that's why they keep it.

[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:58.040]
Why are you sending me the fourth copy of it?

[01:36:58.340 --> 01:36:59.620]
I just put it in the comments.

[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.980]
I mean, don't have the name spell, even like maybe one or two letters right that belong

[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:04.140]
in the name of the limbaugh.

[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:06.560]
We put it on the door, stop sending it already.

[01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:07.560]
Oh, here you go.

[01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:09.520]
Here's a three-for-our-pool.

[01:37:10.540 --> 01:37:12.360]
Somebody you think is an asshole, but you enjoy their work.

[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.940]
James Cameron, George Lucas and Woody Allen.

[01:37:16.060 --> 01:37:16.940]
Let's get all of those on there.

[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:18.300]
We need some help on this one.

[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.480]
I thought it'd be easy, didn't you?

[01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:21.700]
No.

[01:37:22.980 --> 01:37:23.620]
Why not?

[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.520]
Bless you, because it's this crowd.

[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:28.580]
This crowd?

[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:29.940]
That one.

[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:33.080]
Let's see, here's the fact that this is, first of all, I hate Rush, can't stand him.

[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.240]
He's the epitome of an asshole.

[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.520]
He represents everything wrong with his country.

[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:40.300]
What he said on ESPN was stupid, ignorant, and I don't agree with him, but I don't think

[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:40.880]
it was racism.

[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:45.340]
I think that because his comments involved race and the fact that races like his comments

[01:37:45.340 --> 01:37:47.580]
are stupid and ignorant, they were labeled as racists.

[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:51.100]
The fact bastard might just be a racist, but I don't think his comments on Sunday work.

[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.980]
Racism is on, and I understand it as a belief that one's race is at all.

[01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.100]
It goes, uh, that said, I'm really quite ecstatic watching a sorry ass squirm.

[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:00.780]
You got to love it when bad things happen to bad people.

[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:01.160]
Yes.

[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.820]
And yes, I agree with you, ESPN never should have hired him.

[01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:06.940]
Clearly, anyone who can't recognize me that I've sound has no business on a football

[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:07.460]
broadcast.

[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:10.940]
Anyway, Jason, how many oxy-contains he showed down his push last night?

[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:12.880]
I would say at least.

[01:38:14.740 --> 01:38:16.240]
Oh, here's a good one for the pool.

[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:17.160]
I like this one.

[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:17.960]
This is good.

[01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:21.560]
Jerry Impady-Despings is one of our best factors, by the way.

[01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:22.140]
And that's going to you.

[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:26.400]
I'd like to suggest Russell Crowe for your, he's an asshole, but I love his work pool.

[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:29.900]
I think he's a great actor, but apparently he's a dick in real life.

[01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.200]
The breaking rush story is great.

[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:32.660]
I love it.

[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.180]
If I got up tomorrow on the headline, red Karl Rove was busted in the opium then.

[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.380]
Yeah, he was in there with Robert De Niro and the opium then.

[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:41.160]
It would make my whole week.

[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:41.620]
Right, Jerry.

[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:42.700]

Don't forget Joe and Miguel and the Gauntz and Mershpacher.

[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.920]
Or don't be saying that, that visual callback.

[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.500]
I am low.

[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:56.540]
This is 420 of Icedic Q&A M.

[01:38:58.080 --> 01:38:59.540]
This is Mark Morgan.

[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.680]
It's the 12 to 1 hour on Q8M.

[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:14.180]

Michael Jackson.

[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:36.860]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:37.300 --> 01:39:38.300]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:38.940]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:39.520]

[01:39:39.800 --> 01:39:40.560]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:42.820]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:44.240 --> 01:39:45.220]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.100]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:48.660 --> 01:39:48.940]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:49.020 --> 01:39:49.100]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.100]

[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:49.140]
Michael Jackson.

[01:39:49.860 --> 01:39:50.580]
That's right.

[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.700]
From the time his tune to the Jackson 5 to the classic solo work, Michael Jackson's

[01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:56.480]
benefit to her aims to please.

[01:39:56.640 --> 01:39:59.140]
The people that surround myself, we thought you'd be naive.

[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:02.820]
Some funny things, brothers, some are better files.

[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:04.860]
There's no one to defile.

[01:40:05.140 --> 01:40:08.440]
I just sit for a while and be defeated, be defeated.

[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:09.640]
I'm not a king of pop.

[01:40:10.140 --> 01:40:11.880]
I need be defeated, be defeated.

[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:13.200]
Michael Jackson.

[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:16.580]
Sometimes I'm so depressed that I just sit around.

[01:40:16.580 --> 01:40:20.680]
I'm so can't wait before the call, when my calling call again.

[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:25.040]
When I'm home and don't sit naked by the phone, I be defeated.

[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:32.780]
And be one of the five lucky boys to receive backstage passes to hang out in Michael Jackson's

[01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:33.300]
dressing room.

[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.940]
Michael Jackson's benefit.

[01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:37.640]
Hey, yeah, Michael.

[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:38.460]
Yes, Bobby.

[01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.860]
Is that your real skin color?

[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.300]
It's inside with cows.

[01:40:43.300 --> 01:40:46.320]
I know a game that we can play to find out.

[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:49.840]
And since you fly, you know it's time to free Willie.

[01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:55.300]
Say, say, say what you want, but you know who I do.

[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:04.240]
A faction of ladies don't know how to read, but little boys give me a reaction.

[01:41:04.420 --> 01:41:05.860]
And here the rousing finale.

[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.420]
Yes, Michael sings the song he wrote, but it's show another world.

[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:11.300]
With the Vienna boys choir backing him up.

[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.980]
I don't like girls.

[01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:17.980]
I like real children.

[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:22.980]
They are the ones who turn me on and hate.

[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:25.000]
I hope they win.

[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.460]
It's a choice of making.

[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:39.120]
I like to have their lives, but it's true they make the greatest thing.

[01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:44.420]
Here are other great Michael Jackson classics.

[01:41:44.900 --> 01:41:46.400]
White billies jeans.

[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:47.700]
You know how to tell time.

[01:41:47.980 --> 01:41:49.340]
And of course smooth criminal.

[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.020]
Jeff and Michael Jackson's tour.

[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:52.780]
To benefit the cargo class school.

[01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:54.900]
The wayward boys get your tickets now.

[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:57.140]
Boys under 10 is been free when a cup of wine.

[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:57.700]
No one.

[01:41:57.900 --> 01:41:59.020]
A new white.

[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.320]
A new white.

[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.100]
A new white.

[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:03.480]

[01:42:03.480 --> 01:42:03.620]
A new white.

[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:04.080]
A new white.

[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:04.360]
A new white.

[01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:11.560]
A new white.

[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:17.700]
A new white.

[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:20.380]
A new white.

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940]

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940]

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940]

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.940]

[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:20.960]
A new white.

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:20.960]

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:21.140]

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:21.140]

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:21.140]

[01:42:21.140 --> 01:42:21.520]
A new white.

[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:21.900]
A new white.

[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:22.360]
A new white.

[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:23.980]
A new white.

[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:27.500]
A new white.

[01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:29.800]
A new white.

[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:34.340]
A new white.

[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:42.960]
They say let's afford these radio.

[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.100]
They buy accessible Gleiche Boys.

[01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:46.120]
They can't afford you to buy English lessons.

[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:51.280]
отив body training and travel tips the words.

[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:51.480]
Once you've got pressure,

[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.720]
currents, a domain training and speed wings.

[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:55.020]
But in this particular case,

[01:42:55.020 --> 01:43:00.340]
they're so enamored with this show and obsessed with me.

[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:03.040]
They can't turn it off.

[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.980]
Just like that bitch that called earlier that sounded like she was going to give birth right there in a front seat

[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:07.740]
We're freaking car

[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:15.800]
Someone you think is an asshole, but you enjoy their work neo-rodgers 36 to which I say yeah

[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:17.740]
Dick Clark 14

[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.380]
That's what I voted for I still enjoy the old pyramid shows you know, but he's an idiot

[01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:27.520]
Moe Howard David at 13 Billy Bob Thornton 11 that was George's vote

[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.520]
Michael Jackson's moving up flatter fast eight that last bitch would help richard Dawson five

[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.500]
James Cameron to how about John Cameron and Swazie?

[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:42.440]
Hope he takes a look at but he keeps on ticking just like a poor Sheridan who keeps on drowning but she's his clowning and

[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:44.240]
McGill and Luis are frowning

[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:46.820]
But she's going down

[01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:52.300]
George Lucas and Woody Allen Russell Crote don't have any other first 89 votes on our second poll of the day

[01:43:52.300 --> 01:43:57.080]
First poll was about those marlins anybody care no come on. Let's have a little enthusiasm

[01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:01.520]
Women say Schwarzenegger grove and humiliated them. You ready for that?

[01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:06.480]
I'm ready to have the phones are all lit up again. Don't be a turn over to rush. Okay. He's got to say nothing

[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:11.900]
All he's gonna go is look at it like that. We'll get to the Schwarzenegger store, but let's take a hundred calls for it

[01:44:13.240 --> 01:44:18.480]
Here's a lot of nail lakes. Hello. Hey, how you doing pretty good question. I want to change the subject. Please

[01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:22.460]
This thing that's going on now with this CIA leap

[01:44:22.460 --> 01:44:25.080]
Huh, first of all, I want to know what you read on it

[01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.860]
And if it's gonna be covered up, but they do everything else

[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:35.540]
Sure, in fact on our website today there's a great story from the New York Times attorney general is closely linked to the inquiry figures and

[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:42.240]
Of fact that you know because they might have to stand all while the you know the Justice Department can handle this investigation

[01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:47.040]
We don't need a special prosecutor. We don't have a committee. Meanwhile attorney general a escrow

[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.380]
Is connected with Carl rove and as matter of fact

[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:56.680]
Carl rove was paid consultant to three of ash crops campaigns in Missouri twice for governor and for U.S.

[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.360]
Senator in the 80s and 90s and associated Mr. Rovesett on Wednesday

[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:02.580]
So it's like the Fox investigating the chicken coop or however the old saying goes

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:07.860]
Well, my curiosity is is just that are they gonna be able to sweep the something the table like this?

[01:45:07.860 --> 01:45:11.300]
Yes, yes, they will and no hatchet will fall

[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.980]
No, I don't think so well now that's fine to scapegoat somewhere. So I'll lesser lie you know underling

[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:22.540]
And that'll be it. I'm trying to rational how these things happen. You can't

[01:45:22.980 --> 01:45:27.640]
You can't because the American public is stupid. I mean if the public really was demanding an investigation here

[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:32.700]
I mean this is unbelievable, but the public is sitting back and they're worried about who's gonna win a ballgame Sunday

[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:36.780]
And this becomes working this page right

[01:45:37.620 --> 01:45:44.340]
Okay, sorry buddy. Don't bother it all have a great day counsel the press I could lied I

[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:49.240]
Could have said this will be the straw that breaks the candles back and bring the bush people down

[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:54.620]
It might be if the Democrats are really vigorously see I don't blame the Republicans and the right wingers

[01:45:54.620 --> 01:46:01.100]
I blame the the limperist the Democrats that the reason we won into a rack is because they sat back and they allowed the

[01:46:01.100 --> 01:46:06.640]
Iraq attack and this media business that goes on with Operation Iraqi freedom and all is glorious

[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:09.640]
So bulletin board here when he soldiers who are at least the ones who are still alive

[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.600]
You know and then and the Democrats were afraid to say boo including John Kerry and

[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:20.060]
Including Wesley Clark, you know a lot of people forget goddamn Wesley Clark was on CNN there

[01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:23.240]
He was one of the regular talking heads on there for a long time

[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:30.860]
He was a talking head all along in fact during Bosnia and Kosovo remember they kept trotting him out

[01:46:30.860 --> 01:46:34.420]
They have all these retired generals and the admirals that they got nothing else to do

[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.200]
right

[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:40.820]
So he was the role of God damn time yet every opportunity in the world to open up a big mouth did he do it?

[01:46:40.860 --> 01:46:42.940]
No, and then of course he started to walk them all over the place

[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.420]
That's why I'm so much of a Howard Dean fan because number one

[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:48.840]
I think he can win a number two. He's not a phony it doesn't change his opinion every five minutes

[01:46:50.080 --> 01:46:54.280]
Here's the fact that this is the shame rush couldn't be fired and he really had much like Al Campanus

[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:57.580]
Who I actually believe had no racist bones in his body and you mentioned yesterday

[01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:02.760]
Dave Halberstammer a good friend who's a great guy. Yes, he got screwed over by the heat a very similar thing a

[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.160]
Munch and I'll say it again

[01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:10.600]
Here's a super guy who doesn't have a bigoted bone in his body and here's the thing got taken out of context and

[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:14.160]
Halberstam got screwed over by the heat and I blame Pat Riley for it. You suck Pat

[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:19.720]
Okay, and by the way nice hair do he borrows his dip and he do from Reagan because Ron it keeps forgetting about it

[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.900]
To me the Greek was also fired and humiliated you're absolutely correct, Faxor this asshole rush will skate after a while

[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:31.900]
Well with a show intact because the vast majority of bush leakers are spinning images of them bush lookers

[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:37.380]
As far as an annoying person with great work. I vote for Sean Penn. What a talent. What a spark. That's a good one

[01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:43.340]
He is a tremendous actor and he's a real piece of crap and he's also a great activist. He's also a piece of crap

[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:48.280]
Closing I heard Dave the cop of dear field police calling for all in the morning. Oh no

[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:51.520]
I'm the real Dave the cop from the Miami PD. Oh, this is him Dave the cop

[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:56.800]
Here's the proof how about them say it was Cardinal. Oh, I like Dave the cop a lot better on the packs machine on the phone

[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.440]
Here's another one. I like this is an excellent suggestion speaking of the Clark from the same

[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:06.400]
Movie from bowling for Colin blind you son of a bitch Charlton Heston, right?

[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:10.620]
What I mentioned him this morning and you pooped me I

[01:48:11.540 --> 01:48:16.700]
Did better or I guess it was yesterday morning when we were building this and we put it on yeah

[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:18.440]

[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:13.320]
Scott, for your Bill O'Reilly.

[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:15.180]
Although he is an asshole, you're right about that.

[01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:17.000]
5670560.

[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.600]
Anyway, women say Schwarzenegger groped and humiliated them.

[01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:24.080]
The acts allegedly took place over three decades of campaign aid to

[01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:26.040]
organize the accusations of big story.

[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:27.960]
The LA Times and all are from coast to coast.

[01:58:28.040 --> 01:58:28.900]
Now I'm pillar to post.

[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:33.960]
Six women who came into contact with Honourable on movie sets in studio offices and other

[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:37.940]
settings over the last three decades say he touched them in the sexual manner without their consent.

[01:58:37.940 --> 01:58:38.440]
Oh my God.

[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:44.060]
In interviews with the LA Times three, the women described their surprise and discomfort when Schwarzenegger

[01:58:44.060 --> 01:58:45.480]
grabbed their breasts.

[01:58:46.680 --> 01:58:50.040]
A fourth city reached out her skirt and gripped her buttocks.

[01:58:50.580 --> 01:58:50.880]
Woo!

[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:56.660]
A fifth woman said Schwarzenegger groped here and tried to remove her bathing suit in a hotel elevator.

[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:03.260]
A sixth woman said Schwarzenegger pulled her out of his lap and asked whether a certain sexual act had ever been performed on her.

[01:59:03.280 --> 01:59:06.280]
It doesn't say.

[01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:15.720]
According to the women to count one of the incidents that occurred in the 70s, two in the 80s, two in the 90s, and one in 2000, only three years ago.

[01:59:16.340 --> 01:59:21.020]
Did he rape me? No, said one moment who described the 80s encounter which he said Schwarzenegger touched her breasts.

[01:59:21.380 --> 01:59:25.840]
Did he humiliate me? You bet he did. You bet your life. Even Groucho would agree.

[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.720]
Four to sit in the course of she's taken Groucho's advice and ducked.

[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:43.200]
Four to six women told their stories on condition that they not be named three-work in Hollywood and said they were worried that if they were identified, their careers would be in jeopardy for speaking out against Schwarzenegger, the one-time bodybuilding champion and box office star who's going to be governor of California.

[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:48.880]
Do you like his speech? Yes, he said he's not talking about running. He's talking about campaign.

[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:54.860]
No, he's not talking about campaigns, talking about being governor and here's what I'm going to do. He already like one. What does that mean?

[01:59:55.260 --> 01:59:57.660]
It means he's an arrogant prick and the fix is already in.

[01:59:59.240 --> 02:00:05.540]
In the four cases in which the women wouldn't let their name be published, friends of other said that the women had told him about the incidents long before his run for governor.

[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:14.320]
None of the six women gave their accounts to the LA Times for any legal action against him. Schwarzenegger's campaign spokesman Sean Walls said the candidate is not engaged in improper conduct or women.

[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:20.600]
He said such allegations are part of an escalating political attack on Schwarzenegger is the recall election approaches. Anybody believe that? No.

[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:34.620]
No. The Times didn't learn of any of the six women from his rivals in a recall race and none of the women opposed to newspaper on her own reporters contacted them in the course of a seven-week examination of his behavior toward women on and off the movie said.

[02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:43.620]
Schwarzenegger's attitudes about women have been an issue on a campaign trail where critics have accused him of being misogynistic based on past statements he's made to various publications.

[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:49.080]
In response, Arnold said he respects women and many of his comments were made in gesture simply meant to be provocative.

[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.740]
You know what's on that fifth that we play with Oprah Arnold and Maria? I'm with Oprah.

[02:00:53.480 --> 02:00:59.100]
And the one thing that is true in there was Maria says or Oprah says my good friend Maria Schriver.

[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:10.540]
See from that point forward you know that whatever else you might have been said in the real interview it's just a puff piece to give him free your time because one thing about rich people they like to a hobnob around together no matter what their political views they put that all aside.

[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:14.000]
Like the Kennedys and the Schwarzenegger clan.

[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:22.400]
You're disgusting. There's rush CNN say they are convinced that the voice is that of Rush Limbaugh.

[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.500]
Now on the turnee representing this one.

[02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:35.800]
She stands behind her story and a man who answered the telephone after home said the same thing.

[02:01:36.380 --> 02:01:44.800]
A spokesman for the Palm Beach County stated turnee's office told CNN I cannot confirm or deny the investigation into Rush Limbaugh.

[02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:45.960]
That's exactly the French and Candy.

[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:50.660]
However, Rush Limbaugh has put out the following statement provided to CNN.

[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:56.240]
I am unaware of any investigation by any authorities involving me.

[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:01.220]
No governmental representative has contacted me directly or indirectly.

[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:06.480]
If my assistance is required in the future, will of course cooperate fully.

[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:17.340]
Well, she's in the question that immediately comes to mind is why did we all find Kate Rush Limbaugh if indeed it was Rush Limbaugh on her answering machine?

[02:02:17.900 --> 02:02:21.960]
Well, that remains unclear. Obviously there are a lot of questions to be provided.

[02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:24.380]
What her motivation may have been.

[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:31.100]
But that of course is part of the investigation and is unclear whether she will be charged.

[02:02:31.100 --> 02:02:34.000]
Is it unclear whether Rush Limbaugh will be charged?

[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.420]
It is not known whether this woman, for example, is not turned in the house.

[02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:37.700]
There are only a few thousand pills.

[02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:39.540]
That's a big deal, right?

[02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:43.180]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:45.800]
How are we doing at the place there at Riveonaha?

[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:46.940]
No new reports.

[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:47.740]
No new report.

[02:02:47.900 --> 02:02:48.280]
No Joe.

[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:51.440]
No Joe is a no show and a mojo.

[02:02:51.600 --> 02:02:52.000]
Absolutely.

[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:55.620]
Here's a call from beautiful Miami.

[02:02:55.820 --> 02:02:55.980]
Hello.

[02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.500]
Okay, Miami's on hold.

[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.340]
The whole city.

[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:00.660]
Fort Lauderdale.

[02:03:00.660 --> 02:03:00.920]
Hello.

[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:02.240]
Hey, hey, don't.

[02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:02.620]
Pretty good.

[02:03:02.960 --> 02:03:08.440]
You notice when he did oh heads call you and you confront them and say, well, obviously he's a right winger.

[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.260]
And obviously he talked about the Clintons killing people.

[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:12.040]
They didn't die.

[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:13.160]
Oh no, he didn't.

[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:14.140]
You tell me what he said.

[02:03:14.180 --> 02:03:15.380]
We don't believe that, right?

[02:03:15.500 --> 02:03:18.320]
Just like with the six broads with Arnold, they deny right away.

[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:19.600]
Cup, cup all the things.

[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:24.960]
And also like he got on this morning and he was, this is Limbaugh when he was given the speech,

[02:03:25.120 --> 02:03:26.280]
the keynote speech, the convention.

[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:26.840]

[02:03:26.840 --> 02:03:31.680]
And he goes, well, nobody ever accused me of being a racist in high school and college and this and that.

[02:03:32.040 --> 02:03:36.120]
But meanwhile, doesn't he support every racist policy known to mankind?

[02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:36.500]
Yes.

[02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:41.600]
Like the like the redistricting, like minimum mandatory sentences and things like that.

[02:03:41.700 --> 02:03:41.700]

[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:48.640]
The thing is, you're missing the part of the story where it says, you know, he felt this brought up for wiretops.

[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:52.160]
And did you read that part of the story?

[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:52.640]
What I did.

[02:03:52.780 --> 02:03:53.900]
I read the whole daily news.

[02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:56.840]
And he was using Clinton of groping.

[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:00.320]
How many times you hear the word Kathleen Willie in eight years of Clinton?

[02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:06.340]
How many times you hear about this broad from from Arkansas when you heard about this?

[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:06.780]
Right.

[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:08.520]
And then who are you doing?

[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:09.140]
That's not true.

[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:12.240]
The whole trooper, the whole trooper history by the way, was totally falsified.

[02:04:12.380 --> 02:04:14.620]
They did it for money and the whole thing was bogus.

[02:04:14.780 --> 02:04:15.840]
He's doing the same thing.

[02:04:15.980 --> 02:04:17.220]
He's grabbing broads himself.

[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:17.920]
Yeah.

[02:04:18.440 --> 02:04:23.600]
And then the last thing that the only thing that you know,

[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:30.060]
when you absolutely get the truth is when you talked yesterday about when they got Jeff Bush on tape

[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:32.680]
and he's talking about his devious plans.

[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:34.040]
And it still doesn't make any difference.

[02:04:34.240 --> 02:04:37.780]
Well, yeah, it doesn't make it unbelievable because you know why it doesn't make any difference?

[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:42.540]
Because the common thread is that these people all have this good old time religion.

[02:04:43.140 --> 02:04:49.080]
And none of them, you can't, you can't have no conspiracy, but they all have this religious crap in them.

[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:50.400]
They're born again big.

[02:04:50.540 --> 02:04:51.320]
It's sort of like a pally.

[02:04:51.320 --> 02:04:55.380]
It's like you're like your bit where they think alike and they walk alike and they talk like well, right?

[02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:57.180]
They all think alike anyway.

[02:04:57.280 --> 02:04:58.540]
They don't have to be a conspiracy.

[02:04:58.800 --> 02:05:00.020]
They're like cookie cutter people.

[02:05:00.100 --> 02:05:00.760]
Have a great day, pal.

[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:06.320]
Anyway, yeah, he became my increasingly paranoid rush client said even patting her down for recording devices.

[02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:08.460]
That's what he was talking about.

[02:05:09.200 --> 02:05:09.960]
Patting her down.

[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.240]
Maybe she had some patting.

[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:16.220]
In June 2002, he told me he was going to New York for detox a second time after I returned.

[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:17.880]
I went to talk to him and he cried a little bit.

[02:05:17.880 --> 02:05:21.300]
He told me that if ever got out, he'd be ruined, which we say,

[02:05:21.380 --> 02:05:21.860]
Oh, yeah.

[02:05:22.260 --> 02:05:23.020]
Nice going rush.

[02:05:23.460 --> 02:05:24.400]
Pop a couple for us.

[02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:26.600]
Maybe it was over there with Sarah Goldfarb, you think?

[02:05:27.160 --> 02:05:27.980]
No, she's Jewish.

[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:29.860]
Well, that's right.

[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:30.940]
Probably don't like her.

[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:31.900]
Probably don't like her hood.

[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.580]
28 past no.

[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:35.860]
Of course, you'd have to take off that big pointy one to put that one on.

[02:05:36.760 --> 02:05:40.720]
Anyway, Brandy Shoes is doing a big time in Pompato Beach for over 25 years.

[02:05:40.820 --> 02:05:43.660]
Nobody can touch him with a stick because they got the best election.

[02:05:43.820 --> 02:05:47.700]
The best price is the best people working there who make sure you get a perfect fit on your feet.

[02:05:47.700 --> 02:05:48.300]
Every time.

[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:52.520]
And when I say the best brands, we're talking about rock ports, echo, mafisto, Timberland,

[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:56.260]
SAS, Floreshine, Clarks, all the big names in the shoe business.

[02:05:56.440 --> 02:05:58.560]
And no matter what your feet are, no matter what kind of shape they're in,

[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:03.080]
whether they're teeny and tiny and small, or gigantic like Tom Welling and his swelling feet,

[02:06:03.700 --> 02:06:04.400]
they can fit you.

[02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:09.680]
Men's size 6 to 15, women's 5 to 12, and widths from the very narrow to the very big fat and wide.

[02:06:10.080 --> 02:06:12.260]
And like I said, they give you a personal service of Brandy's.

[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:15.420]
They want to make sure you get a perfect fit and walk out of their happy camper every time,

[02:06:15.420 --> 02:06:18.180]
which is why they've lasted all this time while the others have come and gone.

[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:22.480]
Brandy's shoes you'll find about 12, 19 or a federal highway Pompato Beach open every day,

[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:26.740]
Monday through Saturday, 9 to 9, Sunday, 10 to 5, and all this week, see that cheese,

[02:06:26.840 --> 02:06:27.920]
how it's a clogged up my throat.

[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:33.420]
All this week, it's a red tank sale at Brandy's.

[02:06:33.420 --> 02:06:38.220]
Take 50% off on all famous brand names, shoes with a red tag, come into the store and save like crazy,

[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.360]
or check out their website, brandy's shoes.com.

[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:45.420]
And my, and loll, this is 42056,

[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:47.720]
QAAM.

[02:06:52.180 --> 02:06:53.360]
One moment please.

[02:06:54.100 --> 02:06:54.980]
What happened?

[02:06:55.320 --> 02:06:56.080]
What was that?

[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:57.640]
It just like pressed out of the middle.

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:58.560]

[02:06:58.560 --> 02:06:58.820]
Yeah.

[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:04.580]
And, and, hey press some buttons somewhere there's press.

[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:08.840]
It loves to watch boobs and butts and biking.

[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:15.240]
Happiness, peace, a sense of well-being, a sense of self-worth,

[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:20.300]
it comes from the inside out, it doesn't come from the outside.

[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.060]
Don't you feel a guy's free of all the walls?

[02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:31.740]
There's no substance there at all, Texas metal falls that's going to be a thing.

[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:40.340]
Dr. Phil, brain in when he walks, he's a mister, no it all.

[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:45.180]
Never want to see him wearing the jeep strings.

[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:46.920]
That, that's crazy.

[02:07:47.160 --> 02:07:48.760]
Dr. Phil, why?

[02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:53.280]
Do your eyes do that?

[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.160]
Dr. Phil, try.

[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:00.420]
Do some of your own fights.

[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:05.180]
What makes you think that you do have the right to judge him?

[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:08.680]
Forget it if you're apparently putting it to my point and do it, you hear that?

[02:08:08.940 --> 02:08:11.900]
Dr. Phil, give it folks side fights,

[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:19.900]
while he screams at far-house fights about eating more than any human should.

[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:25.020]
Dr. Phil, please just bang it down.

[02:08:25.620 --> 02:08:33.940]
You're a freaking surface clown, try to handle things like your friend or broo-woah.

[02:08:33.960 --> 02:08:34.960]
That's crazy.

[02:08:35.160 --> 02:08:36.720]
Dr. Phil, stop.

[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:41.620]
Oh, here's Arnold, he's apologizing.

[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:44.300]
I said, it's true he was out on a Rowdy movie set,

[02:08:44.500 --> 02:08:46.660]
and if he did things to offend people he apologized.

[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:50.140]
I hope that you'll give me the chance to prove that.

[02:08:52.780 --> 02:08:54.060]
I'll go for the show.

[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:56.680]
I'll go for the show.

[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:03.860]
Let me tell you, this is what this class 2 is all about.

[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:08.420]
Back to the future of California, everything is a movie title, everything is a, you know,

[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:09.980]
I still have Easter on, all this crap.

[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:15.340]
Man, oh man, I never thought America could get any demo than it used to be like about an hour ago, but it is.

[02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:15.800]
Surprise.

[02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:16.640]
Yes?

[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:17.600]
300.

[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:21.520]
There on the corner of Sample and Dixie for Rob, what it's worth, and Joe is on his way.

[02:09:22.620 --> 02:09:23.860]
Joe is on his way?

[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:25.040]
He's on his way.

[02:09:25.420 --> 02:09:27.640]
It's 1234 and he's on his way?

[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:30.740]
Yeah.

[02:09:32.300 --> 02:09:33.300]
Anyway, Miguel's there.

[02:09:33.420 --> 02:09:35.260]
Who the hell needs to see Joe anyways at a bad nose?

[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.540]
Riva Yamaha, on the corner of Dixie and Sample, 3671 North Dixie, how about Pompadabees?

[02:09:40.540 --> 02:09:41.360]
We got 300 already.

[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:43.300]
It's a good start for abandonment rescue.

[02:09:43.300 --> 02:09:48.100]
And let me say it again, five pair tickets to see Alice Cooper in concert at the Pompadabees Amphitheater, and eight

[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:53.140]
pair tickets to see the Panther Light and the Exhibition Game at the, um, the Enter Center, the Saturday the Fourth of Oct.

[02:09:53.880 --> 02:09:55.780]
So that's what Miguel's got waiting for, okay?

[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:00.460]
For it, and again, those, the tickets are for people that donate to abandonment rescue.

[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:01.740]
If you don't, don't be coming by.

[02:10:01.780 --> 02:10:03.660]
I'd like some of those free tickets because no.

[02:10:03.800 --> 02:10:03.960]
No.

[02:10:05.260 --> 02:10:06.940]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.080]
Schwarzenegger thought he was playful, but it was wrong.

[02:10:10.200 --> 02:10:10.660]
That's what he said.

[02:10:10.880 --> 02:10:11.440]
He was playful.

[02:10:11.620 --> 02:10:13.480]
In other words, when he stuck his hand up some broads asked.

[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:16.140]
He was just being playful when he was squeezing their boobies, you know?

[02:10:16.440 --> 02:10:17.700]
It was just a little play.

[02:10:19.520 --> 02:10:20.380]
As in four.

[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:21.300]
Play.

[02:10:21.840 --> 02:10:22.580]
Here's Delray.

[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:22.860]
Hello.

[02:10:23.540 --> 02:10:24.040]
Ah, yes.

[02:10:24.620 --> 02:10:31.240]
Um, I wanted to serve by saying that it's pretty sickening that every day a folder dies in Iraq and-

[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:31.420]
Yeah.

[02:10:31.740 --> 02:10:32.440]
Or two.

[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:32.980]
Yeah.

[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:36.740]
There's no fold provided to him by the government contracts that are given to them.

[02:10:36.880 --> 02:10:44.040]
But, Rushburn Ball has the nerve to go in the air and sail this racist crap, but he gets out of the army because he had a wart on his ass or something.

[02:10:44.160 --> 02:10:44.420]
A boil.

[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:45.100]
Yeah.

[02:10:45.240 --> 02:10:46.500]
He had a boil on his butt.

[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:47.400]
But you don't understand.

[02:10:48.020 --> 02:10:49.840]
He's got talent on loan from God.

[02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:51.100]
Right, I forgot about that.

[02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:58.640]
He's also the same person that says, take the bone out of your nose and call me back to a black collar when he was DJ out in Sacramento.

[02:10:59.160 --> 02:10:59.380]
Nice.

[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:01.720]
Now, what is that?

[02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:04.220]
Is anybody can I justify this at all?

[02:11:04.440 --> 02:11:06.100]
Well, they obviously are.

[02:11:06.300 --> 02:11:11.280]
And of course you hear a lot of these Yahoo's, these crackers who I had called early in the show.

[02:11:11.660 --> 02:11:16.460]
What they're really trying to say is, well, you know, when Dusty Baker said something or when black people say something,

[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:18.260]
then nobody wants to pick on them.

[02:11:18.260 --> 02:11:23.320]
But Argman Rush now just because he made an obviously inflammatory racial comment, even though we don't want to admit that it was.

[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:25.080]
He's getting it up the ass now.

[02:11:25.080 --> 02:11:27.200]
So that's what he's appealing to.

[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:29.020]
This whole thing appeals to his constituency.

[02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.780]
He's preaching to his choir, to his widow head.

[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:41.680]
The same people that Bush appealed to in South Carolina when he did the push polling to say that, oh, McCain had a black baby, a state's rights and all this crap.

[02:11:41.700 --> 02:11:41.800]
Right.

[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:48.000]
And Rush also says, well, all druggies are a drag down on society and they must be deported.

[02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:50.020]
Well, ask for a start with yourself.

[02:11:50.020 --> 02:11:51.720]
Look in the mirror.

[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:55.720]
Have you ever heard of a comedian by the name of Bill Hicks that died about 10 years ago?

[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:56.240]
Yeah.

[02:11:56.800 --> 02:12:03.800]
He had a great quote that said, anybody that is that far to the right is hiding a deep dark secret.

[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:05.280]
Hey, man, well said.

[02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:06.980]
Well said, and at the right wing closet.

[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.300]
Have a right-day pal and a enter.

[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:14.760]
And now I'll come here and not syndicate it because Rainy Rose just announced that she got syndicated once some other network out.

[02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:17.680]
Because my agent is an asshole, does that have your question, sir?

[02:12:17.740 --> 02:12:18.840]
Well, you need to fire him.

[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:19.500]
Exactly.

[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:20.540]
Come on.

[02:12:20.620 --> 02:12:21.060]
I mean, bro.

[02:12:21.120 --> 02:12:22.560]
Like I said, say goodbye and have a great day.

[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:23.880]
Have a great day in New York.

[02:12:24.200 --> 02:12:24.460]
I'm fine.

[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:25.440]
I rock.

[02:12:25.980 --> 02:12:26.780]
Do you say Iraq?

[02:12:27.540 --> 02:12:27.980]
Something like that.

[02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:31.880]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&TC.

[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:38.640]
If Rush would have been busy popping that boil on his ass, so we can go service country as opposed to like pop it all in pills.

[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:40.640]
Maybe he might have done something productive.

[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:44.280]
Rainy Rose?

[02:12:44.740 --> 02:12:47.240]
Is it going to be syndicated in any like that?

[02:12:47.240 --> 02:12:47.820]
Aren't you excited?

[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:48.820]
Oh, yeah, vibrating.

[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:49.560]
Woo!

[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:50.620]
Me too.

[02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:53.980]
Attorney General is closely linked to winch-or-re figures.

[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:56.220]
The guy they depressed guy to call about in half an hour ago.

[02:12:56.740 --> 02:12:56.980]
Hmm.

[02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.460]
I don't even know if I did put this to Rainy website.

[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:04.400]
We showed from New York Times today by Elizabeth Bumiller and Eric Lick-Blau.

[02:13:04.660 --> 02:13:04.740]
Eh?

[02:13:05.300 --> 02:13:05.300]

[02:13:06.260 --> 02:13:11.400]
The political ties between Tap White House Aids and Attorney General John Ashcroft have put him into a delicate position

[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:19.700]
as the Justice Department begins a full investigation of whether administration officials illegally disclose the name of an undercover CIA officer, Carl Rove.

[02:13:20.580 --> 02:13:35.520]
President Bush's top political advisor, whose possible role in the case has raised questions, was a paid consultant to three of Mr. Ashcroft's campaigns in Missouri twice for governor and for US Senator in the 1980s and 90s, and associate a Mr. Rove set on Wednesday.

[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:47.460]
Jack Oliver, the deputy finance chairman of Mr. Bush's 2004 reelection campaign, was the director of Mr. Ashcroft's 94 Senate campaign and later worked as Mr. Ashcroft deputy chief of staff.

[02:13:49.120 --> 02:14:03.040]
Those connections, like Democrats yesterday, to assert that Mr. Rove's connections to Mr. Ashcroft amounted to a clear conflict of interest and underbind the integrity of the investigation, the disclosures have also emboldened Democrats who have called for the appointment of an outside counsel, and they are...

[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:04.700]
Absolutely correct sir.

[02:14:04.700 --> 02:14:05.240]
Amen.

[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:26.480]
On Wednesday, the administration worked to ensure that no Republicans in Congress broke ranks and called for an independent inquiry, and it sought to portray the former diplomat of the center of the cases a partisan Democrat, as if to somehow excuse their behavior and above Novak's behavior, and all of the Southern crap which severed eyes not only her life and safety, but also the life of all of her contacts and a lot of people in the CIA.

[02:14:28.700 --> 02:14:39.500]
But, like I told that guy, they'll sweep it over the carpet because the public is sleeping, and it didn't involve any sexy juicy sex, even any dry juicy sex.

[02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:43.380]
And as a result, nobody gives a flying crap.

[02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:51.080]
Because the public continues being fed a bunch of propaganda, although Al Gore who invented the internet, good ol' Al Gore.

[02:14:52.640 --> 02:14:53.620]
He's on the case.

[02:14:54.900 --> 02:15:00.020]
Big article in the National Post here this morning, Gore eyes CBC launched cable company.

[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:12.660]
In his quest to set up a new liberal-leading broadcaster in the United States, former US Vice President Al Gore and a group of investors, could up and end up buying news world international cable company, originally started by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.

[02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.140]
Right now they CBC in 94.

[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:26.960]
Courtney was sourced posted in negotiations, Mr. Gore was his financial partners, up to refocus the channel, which was sold to USA Network's in 2000 and to a VVND Universal, as a left-leaning rival to Rupert Murdoch's Fox News.

[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:30.560]
Mr. Gore would become the company's fifth owner if the video goes through.

[02:15:31.060 --> 02:15:39.120]
Yes, the word talk said the source adding that they were put out holding mayor June, because most of the VND Universal's TV entertainment assets were put up for auction to reduce the company's debt.

[02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:52.380]
Talks may have warmed up now, now that it's in a electric New York based NBC has a deal above the VND Universal's US Entertainment Division for $3.8 billion in cash and 20% stake in a new entertainment company, better or more than 40 billion US.

[02:15:53.240 --> 02:15:58.500]
It's going to be considered, but I'd tell ideal is consummated, not to lay consummated through a fear.

[02:15:58.640 --> 02:16:00.180]
Here's the facts for Morgan and Vocus's.

[02:16:00.500 --> 02:16:03.620]
Here's a question of some of the subject more important than Rush LeBarr Carl Rowe.

[02:16:03.620 --> 02:16:07.280]
Did you see the season premiere of Smallville and Warren in Vocus, you'd have been listening, the answer is,

[02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:08.080]
forgot about it.

[02:16:08.140 --> 02:16:09.200]
George saw it, said it was great.

[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:10.900]
It said it was pretty good.

[02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:11.860]
It was all right.

[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.140]
It said it wasn't sensational, but it was okay.

[02:16:16.040 --> 02:16:19.320]
Need to know what you were doing on an easy view on the WB.

[02:16:19.520 --> 02:16:20.740]
Okay, so just calm down Warren.

[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.100]
All right.

[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:23.020]
How's Warren McElmory doing?

[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:23.560]
Seeing him lately?

[02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.380]
What's that nice trotter that Warren McElmory had, George?

[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:30.520]
19 to 1 at 560 WB.

[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:34.880]
It's been said that everything you do, the big things, the small things, even the everyday things,

[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:36.660]
can change the world in least some small way.

[02:16:37.320 --> 02:16:42.660]
The idea that everything you do has the ability to affect somebody else is something that people have from Montettingber company truly believe in.

[02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.000]
It's one of the many reasons they put so much attention and love and pride into every bear they make.

[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:49.760]
They want you to feel confident that when you said it from Montettingber,

[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:54.120]
you're sending a gift that will bring some love and fun to somebody's day and be cherished for a lifetime.

[02:17:24.740 --> 02:17:28.860]
My, and law, this is 4205 City.

[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.060]
Way to lay out.

[02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.700]
The drug connection.

[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:37.460]
Tell us, Marie, what did you do first?

[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:41.900]
Well first, he made me swallow 60 condoms filled with cocaine.

[02:17:42.980 --> 02:17:48.240]
But then, hi, yeah, you took me to the airport and sent me on a fun field vacation in New York.

[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.380]
I saw six Broadway shows.

[02:17:51.820 --> 02:17:54.320]
After I got over the laxatives and prunes, you, of course.

[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:00.360]
Share the fun and excitement of international drug trafficking tonight on the drug connection.

[02:18:01.700 --> 02:18:03.880]
1245-560, take a look, boys, at that phone.

[02:18:04.040 --> 02:18:06.620]
See how it's lighting out and it's set up all the time now because I love that,

[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:08.500]
yeah, all the little heads of gum where they belong.

[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:09.340]
You called it.

[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:10.940]
Here's a Russian vacation today.

[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:12.100]
Is he?

[02:18:12.500 --> 02:18:13.200]
I thought he was.

[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:14.460]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:15.760]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:15.760 --> 02:18:16.080]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:16.080 --> 02:18:16.280]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:16.800]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:17.500]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:17.500 --> 02:18:17.740]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:18.500]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:18.580 --> 02:18:20.280]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:20.800]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:21.160]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:22.360]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:22.580 --> 02:18:23.220]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:23.340 --> 02:18:24.660]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:26.480]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:26.480 --> 02:18:27.940]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:28.980]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:32.360]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.200]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:37.100]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:37.320 --> 02:18:42.120]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:43.180]
Does that mean he's on holiday?

[02:18:43.660 --> 02:18:44.620]
Do it right now.

[02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:45.540]
Do it right now.

[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:45.560]

[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:49.600]
Here's Mike in World Palm Beach who says I saw a small village.

[02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:51.380]
That the story right is must have been on drugs.

[02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:52.800]
Maybe they got him from rush.

[02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:53.140]
Yes.

[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:55.340]
When they wrote this one, a lot of weird schmit.

[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:57.460]
Maybe it was because Rucker Howard was in it.

[02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.180]
Was he in it?

[02:18:58.620 --> 02:18:58.780]
Yes.

[02:18:59.440 --> 02:18:59.680]
Oh.

[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:01.140]
That never told me that.

[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:02.000]
I love Rucker Howard.

[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.520]
I didn't know you like Rucker.

[02:19:03.920 --> 02:19:04.140]
Rucker.

[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:04.580]
Rutz Gar.

[02:19:05.540 --> 02:19:06.500]
He's fat and old now.

[02:19:06.920 --> 02:19:08.440]
I talk about him all the time.

[02:19:08.580 --> 02:19:09.740]
Why don't you talk about the hits?

[02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:10.720]
I think your food's right.

[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:13.440]
But I thought the WB channel in Palm Beach doesn't show a small village.

[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:15.780]
I don't know when they show it so I can catch it on satellite.

[02:19:16.180 --> 02:19:19.860]
I heard Stan Major on the light bulb the other day with Normani said on the air

[02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.080]
that you had a four-sale son on your house what an asshole he is.

[02:19:23.260 --> 02:19:25.380]
As a matter of fact, I didn't even know if it's still there.

[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.080]
I did have a four-sale because I was going to sell it and buy a different house.

[02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:28.800]
What the hell is that?

[02:19:28.860 --> 02:19:29.500]
I have to do with anything.

[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:31.660]
PS, you'll ever see your two grand.

[02:19:31.880 --> 02:19:32.180]
You're right, Mike.

[02:19:32.700 --> 02:19:32.800]
Huh.

[02:19:34.100 --> 02:19:35.380]
PS, well QA, I'm single.

[02:19:35.380 --> 02:19:35.980]
I ever get better.

[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:37.200]
Even in Broward, a single sucks.

[02:19:37.480 --> 02:19:38.860]
Nancy, your question, Mike, is no.

[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:39.500]

[02:19:40.940 --> 02:19:44.260]
Stan Major must have been driving over to my house to see if I could borrow one of my Corvette.

[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:45.980]
The answer is still no Stan.

[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:47.560]
You backstabbing piece of crap.

[02:19:49.260 --> 02:19:51.340]
Now here's the facts, the long facts.

[02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:51.840]
Wow.

[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:57.640]
It's one thing for people to call a question whether Russia's McNabb comments were racist.

[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:00.180]
It's altogether another thing to be oblivious to how stupid they were.

[02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:04.400]
Perhaps 25 years ago when Black Quartermaks like Doug Williams were first around to make the win the NFL,

[02:20:04.640 --> 02:20:07.700]
it would have been true that the press wanted to buy, but I said all this yesterday.

[02:20:07.700 --> 02:20:09.120]
Then I talk about Doug Williams.

[02:20:09.920 --> 02:20:10.240]
I don't remember.

[02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:10.980]
Yes.

[02:20:11.740 --> 02:20:17.380]
The underlying truth is, of course, that like most right wingers, Russia's made a fat career out of the racial paranoia of whites,

[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:19.180]
but that's a good way to put it.

[02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:23.600]
Such imaginary race-based explanation, they're just natural for somebody like him.

[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:28.040]
He's the photo negative of one of the people he despises most, the odious Jesse Jackson.

[02:20:28.620 --> 02:20:33.140]
Both are lying, deceptive scamsters who play to the racial fears of the respective audiences.

[02:20:33.140 --> 02:20:39.620]
But at least in the case of Jackson, you might understand how he got twisted into such a character growing up out of the Jim Crow laws in the South,

[02:20:40.020 --> 02:20:42.160]
seeing Martin Luther King assassinated in front of him, etc.

[02:20:42.600 --> 02:20:46.000]
Please note, I'm not excusing Jesse just offering a possible explanation for him.

[02:20:46.080 --> 02:20:50.720]
Russian, as you'll come the other hand, are just demagogues getting rich on these stupidity of the American people and you're very...

[02:20:50.720 --> 02:20:51.960]
I'm going to look correctly.

[02:20:52.220 --> 02:20:53.180]
You're right, thumb right on it.

[02:20:53.380 --> 02:20:54.240]
Best facts ever.

[02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:54.900]
Right.

[02:20:55.520 --> 02:20:58.200]
Popped the Salfus I got Norm Ken.

[02:21:01.060 --> 02:21:04.960]
5.670560, pound 5.60 on the AT&T line. Here's Lauderdale. Hello.

[02:21:05.140 --> 02:21:05.880]
Oh, Neil.

[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:06.800]
Yes?

[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:11.320]
He's got some fellow Nazi by the name of Tom Sullivan sitting in form today.

[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:12.700]
Oh, so he is on vacation.

[02:21:13.240 --> 02:21:16.020]
Well, I don't know if it was a planned vacation or it's a...

[02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:19.100]
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

[02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:19.760]

[02:21:21.140 --> 02:21:24.840]
Well, yeah, he was in Philly this morning and I don't know what he's doing now, but he's not in here.

[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:27.360]
Oh, he's probably on his way to get the refreshing supply.

[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:29.380]
Thank you to the good news, pal.

[02:21:29.580 --> 02:21:31.380]
How you like that?

[02:21:31.780 --> 02:21:32.820]
So, Russia's not...

[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:33.320]
Okay, it's safe.

[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:34.680]
Everybody can come back now, okay?

[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:35.660]
Russia ain't on today.

[02:21:36.220 --> 02:21:38.540]
He's busy popping a few condo whistle or something.

[02:21:39.440 --> 02:21:39.560]
What?

[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:41.280]
We should blow a horn or something.

[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:43.180]
The old blow something.

[02:21:43.500 --> 02:21:44.080]
I'll work on it.

[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:50.840]
Somebody you think is an asshole, but you enjoy their work is and we were starting to build a good list here and then all of a sudden they had just...

[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:51.980]
Peter it out.

[02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:53.200]
199 votes.

[02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:54.620]
I think it's a good poll.

[02:21:55.020 --> 02:21:55.660]
Think about it.

[02:21:56.680 --> 02:21:57.060]
I'm leading.

[02:21:57.220 --> 02:21:58.220]
Nobody's going to touch me.

[02:21:58.760 --> 02:21:59.480]
Unless I want them to.

[02:21:59.800 --> 02:22:00.760]
You arrived here, 73.

[02:22:01.360 --> 02:22:02.400]
Mohawar David at 19.

[02:22:02.660 --> 02:22:03.500]
Michael Jackson 18.

[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.420]
Dick Park 16.

[02:22:04.820 --> 02:22:05.600]
16 like Dick.

[02:22:06.700 --> 02:22:08.000]
Billy Bob Thornton 15.

[02:22:08.180 --> 02:22:09.020]
Russell Crow 13.

[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:09.760]
Woody Allen 11.

[02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:10.480]
The Humper.

[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:11.920]
Hank Goldberg has got 70s.

[02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:12.580]
Make a little move.

[02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:14.060]
Richard Dawson 6.

[02:22:14.300 --> 02:22:14.920]
Howard Stern 6.

[02:22:15.320 --> 02:22:16.140]
Bill O'Reilly 4.

[02:22:16.820 --> 02:22:17.700]
James Cameron 4.

[02:22:17.860 --> 02:22:18.560]
Chuck Heston 4.

[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:19.380]
Rick Riley 2.

[02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:24.040]
Chris Carter 1.

[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:26.200]
No votes for Pete Rose or George Lucas yet.

[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:27.720]
No votes for Pete Rose.

[02:22:29.020 --> 02:22:30.640]
Holy Toledo 4.

[02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:31.040]
60.

[02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:33.240]
We got $460 over there.

[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:34.760]
Rivey Yamaha's Joe Castell over there yet.

[02:22:35.540 --> 02:22:36.800]
Well nice gone job.

[02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:38.680]
Better late than never your little grease ball.

[02:22:39.320 --> 02:22:40.660]
What kind of crap is that?

[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:45.660]
Got a two hour appearance and he shows up an hour into it almost 50 minutes into it.

[02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:49.360]
But that's okay.

[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.040]
He'll get paid.

[02:22:50.140 --> 02:22:51.280]
He'll still get paid the full amount right?

[02:22:52.080 --> 02:22:53.200]
I don't think he gets paid at all.

[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:54.680]
This isn't a paid appearance.

[02:22:54.900 --> 02:22:55.660]
I don't think we're doing it.

[02:22:55.780 --> 02:22:56.360]
Rivey Yamaha.

[02:22:56.480 --> 02:22:59.400]
It's got to be some kind of a commercial sweet hard deal.

[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:00.160]
You know how it works.

[02:23:00.520 --> 02:23:01.680]
We got to be smearing somebody.

[02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:06.560]
Poor Scott Peroll and Casey Mr. Noose they're coming all over Scott's ass man.

[02:23:06.720 --> 02:23:07.760]
He's not too happy about it.

[02:23:08.040 --> 02:23:08.700]
I think it's pardoned.

[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:09.820]
I guess that wasn't a good way to put it.

[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:10.560]
Well they don't know what I mean.

[02:23:11.060 --> 02:23:12.540]
They say they're coming down on his ass.

[02:23:12.540 --> 02:23:13.380]
Oh, is that what I said?

[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:14.600]
Oh, okay.

[02:23:15.240 --> 02:23:18.260]
And boy he is really getting rubbed the wrong way.

[02:23:18.260 --> 02:23:18.900]
Not happy.

[02:23:20.300 --> 02:23:24.360]
If you put him on the ear just like I said with the SPN they put this fat tub of right wing

[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:32.340]
racist divisive crap on the ear like they expected him to say something unifying, something positive, something pleasant, something significant.

[02:23:34.100 --> 02:23:36.680]
You don't put a politician on it and be talking about football.

[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:37.720]
That's what it boils down to.

[02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.940]
See this is the new deal.

[02:23:39.760 --> 02:23:40.740]
They did it with Dennis Miller.

[02:23:41.160 --> 02:23:41.800]
That was a bomb.

[02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:45.260]
Now we're going to put this guy on there who tried to do it last year and they said we don't think so.

[02:23:45.360 --> 02:23:46.080]
We don't want the controversy.

[02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:47.920]
They put him on there this year and sure enough.

[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:49.520]
They blew up in their face.

[02:23:51.360 --> 02:23:55.480]
And of course let me remind you of one thing about the National Football League and those pre-game shows.

[02:23:56.120 --> 02:23:56.480]
Yeah.

[02:23:56.960 --> 02:24:01.220]
Who do you think a lot of the people are who watch the NFL and its associated pre-game shows?

[02:24:01.460 --> 02:24:01.900]
Of color.

[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:03.640]
What color do you think their skin is?

[02:24:03.780 --> 02:24:05.160]
A little on the dark side per act?

[02:24:05.260 --> 02:24:05.580]
Yes.

[02:24:05.740 --> 02:24:07.160]
They're probably not too happy about it.

[02:24:08.260 --> 02:24:16.060]
In addition to which any real football fan wouldn't have been happy about it because they didn't know that it was a totally erroneous comment that was just made to be divisive and sensational.

[02:24:16.060 --> 02:24:18.140]
And get everybody whipped up and we're frenzy.

[02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:19.040]
Nice going rush.

[02:24:19.100 --> 02:24:19.600]
You succeeded.

[02:24:21.100 --> 02:24:26.020]
Even when at the Billy Joe O Sullivan, whatever's name is they still turned over there a lot of IOD.

[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:27.020]
Well, screw you people.

[02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:27.360]
Okay.

[02:24:28.420 --> 02:24:29.880]
Whatever's there is I what is he on?

[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:30.320]
I.N.Z.

[02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:31.420]
The IOD.

[02:24:31.620 --> 02:24:31.960]
I.N.Z.

[02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:33.080]
I.N.Z.

[02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:33.680]
Rest in peace.

[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:34.360]
I'm so sorry.

[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:37.580]
I said that Fox Sports would have point O-O-O's.

[02:24:39.060 --> 02:24:40.160]
Here's a call from Naples.

[02:24:40.300 --> 02:24:40.480]
Hello.

[02:24:41.620 --> 02:24:42.440]
I don't know.

[02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:43.400]
I thought that I lost my junior.

[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:43.980]
I lost.

[02:24:43.980 --> 02:24:45.780]
I can't hear you man your phone's crap it out.

[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:47.660]
I think you said Robert Downey junior.

[02:24:48.340 --> 02:24:48.900]
Is what?

[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:49.620]
Oh, for the list.

[02:24:49.800 --> 02:24:49.940]
Okay.

[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:50.800]
That's a good one.

[02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:51.540]
I like that.

[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:52.040]
I love that one.

[02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:53.780]
Robert Downey junior.

[02:24:53.980 --> 02:24:54.260]
Very good.

[02:24:54.420 --> 02:24:56.500]
I played you could hear it because his phone was really weak.

[02:24:56.700 --> 02:24:57.200]
Well, he's in Naples.

[02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:57.980]
Well, he wanted to be easily.

[02:24:57.980 --> 02:24:58.940]
He's probably didn't pay the bill.

[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:01.440]
The measly beasley's man.

[02:25:01.580 --> 02:25:03.460]
You can see that they're just starting to panic now.

[02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:04.700]
They're all crawling around on that tree.

[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:07.160]
Each one passing them on to banjo pick.

[02:25:08.540 --> 02:25:08.860]
Boy.

[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.540]
What a sad, sad situation.

[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:13.160]
You know what it's starting to remind me of?

[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:14.160]
What?

[02:25:14.380 --> 02:25:16.800]
It's like those golden salad days that I would do.

[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:20.120]
When Rick and Suts were doing the mornings I was midday, Phil Henry the afternoon, Randy

[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:20.360]
and I.

[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:22.960]
We had a, we were kicking ass man.

[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:27.920]
We had one of the great lineups in broadcast history all day long.

[02:25:28.900 --> 02:25:31.000]
All day, freaking long.

[02:25:32.540 --> 02:25:34.780]
And they didn't know whether to eat or suck the banana.

[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:40.560]
And as a result they had one epsilon thing because they're, well, I want to go through the whole

[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:41.880]
history of it, but they just blew it.

[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:47.680]
And then they're dropping a couple of, oh, and then they're putting one or two of those.

[02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:50.120]
And then maybe a little and one or two far.

[02:25:50.180 --> 02:25:51.320]
It's cause now for all can't play.

[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:51.860]
Yeah.

[02:25:53.680 --> 02:26:00.320]
That, to me, is the most childish, the most embarrassing, the most humiliating and degrading

[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:00.600]
thing.

[02:26:00.940 --> 02:26:03.060]
The fact they took Scott's gas away from me.

[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:03.820]
That's unbelievable.

[02:26:05.340 --> 02:26:06.500]
Is that, is that astonishing?

[02:26:06.760 --> 02:26:08.340]
I'm, no, I can't believe it.

[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:15.200]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:18.200 --> 02:26:19.000]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:20.200]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:21.880 --> 02:26:22.460]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:22.460]

[02:26:22.460 --> 02:26:22.520]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.520]

[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:22.640]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:22.640]

[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:24.300]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:25.240]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:27.540]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:31.320 --> 02:26:35.560]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:37.280 --> 02:26:38.180]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:56.240 --> 02:26:56.620]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.620 --> 02:26:56.620]

[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:56.640]

[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:56.640]

[02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:56.640]

[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:57.080]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:57.080 --> 02:26:57.320]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:57.380 --> 02:26:58.320]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:26:59.140 --> 02:27:00.220]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:00.540 --> 02:27:01.200]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:02.340]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:02.840]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:03.120]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:04.460]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:04.460 --> 02:27:04.740]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:06.180 --> 02:27:06.760]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:08.080]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:09.080]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:16.140]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.140]

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.140]

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.140]

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.140]

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.140]

[02:27:16.140 --> 02:27:16.360]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.360]

[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.360]

[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.360]

[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.360]

[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:16.460]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:16.460 --> 02:27:17.500]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:19.120]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:19.120 --> 02:27:20.520]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:21.220]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:21.840 --> 02:27:23.240]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:26.440]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:28.340]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:33.220]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.420]
I'm not going to say that.

[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:39.140]
That's exactly what he said.

[02:27:39.420 --> 02:27:40.920]
He was clicking.

[02:27:41.900 --> 02:27:42.740]
He was clicking.

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:42.980]

[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:43.100]
He was clicking.

[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:43.120]
He was clicking.

[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.120]

[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.120]

[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.120]

[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.340]
He was clicking.

[02:27:43.340 --> 02:27:43.420]
He was clicking.

[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:43.420]

[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:43.860]
He was clicking.

[02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:44.140]
He was clicking.

[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:44.620]
He was clicking.

[02:27:44.720 --> 02:27:46.220]
He was clicking.

[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:48.120]
He was clicking.

[02:27:49.860 --> 02:27:51.180]
He was clicking.

[02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:55.580]
He was clicking.

[02:27:57.360 --> 02:27:58.400]
He was clicking.

[02:27:59.540 --> 02:28:00.000]
He was clicking.

[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:02.200]
He was clicking.

[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.900]
He was clicking.

[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:04.900]

[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:04.900]

[02:28:04.900 --> 02:28:05.880]
I'll tell you when on the blanks.

[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:06.140]
Okay.

[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:08.400]
It's the usual Oz tom provaka tours, you know.

[02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:10.140]
The other thing past said

[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:11.460]
would be that he didn't say

[02:28:11.460 --> 02:28:13.920]
any thing at all this is really insane.

[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:17.240]
But this is what he does with his Radio Shows

[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:18.020]
and everything else.

[02:28:18.160 --> 02:28:20.220]
He must scrap up spins craft.

[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:20.640]
His nice craft.

[02:28:20.640 --> 02:28:22.540]
And what he said was he didn't

[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:24.400]
say anything about McNàcies.

[02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.700]
He was talking about the media.

[02:28:26.860 --> 02:28:27.960]
Oh right sure.

[02:28:28.380 --> 02:28:30.740]
Sure, but I can tell you this.

[02:28:30.900 --> 02:28:32.160]
This was the designation was forced.

[02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:33.640]
You can't think anything about it.

[02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:34.880]
I can't...

[02:28:34.880 --> 02:28:35.280]
Yep.

[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:37.620]
Just kind of like a dumb shulah.

[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:38.040]
I'm sorry.

[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:42.960]
But at any rate, first of all, listen.

[02:28:43.320 --> 02:28:45.360]
I mean, I'm a football fan to a point.

[02:28:45.480 --> 02:28:46.660]
I like UR because it's your livelihood.

[02:28:47.220 --> 02:28:48.500]
I don't disagree with you.

[02:28:48.580 --> 02:28:49.820]
And you know, that's exactly what happened.

[02:28:50.180 --> 02:28:55.580]
Anybody who would say that Donovan McNabb is overrated in the media, have this desire

[02:28:55.580 --> 02:28:56.220]
to prop him up.

[02:28:56.460 --> 02:29:00.320]
Like I said, any article in the daily in whatever paper was this morning, seven starting

[02:29:00.320 --> 02:29:04.440]
quarterbacks Sunday were black, two others were injured or there would have been nine.

[02:29:04.440 --> 02:29:08.420]
And then the media got some kind of, it's an issue that died 10 years ago.

[02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:08.740]
Right.

[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:09.400]
Exactly.

[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:11.100]
Like Russia.

[02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:14.420]
I'll tell you what happened by the way, a little bit of insight, okay?

[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:21.020]
The first week he was on, the first show, he talked about the failed affirmative action

[02:29:21.020 --> 02:29:22.920]
policy in the NFL for coaches.

[02:29:23.680 --> 02:29:25.380]
And then he did a little thing about that.

[02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:30.880]
And they told him after that that they want him to spark controversy, but they want him

[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:32.240]
to stay away from the politics.

[02:29:32.820 --> 02:29:33.160]
Yeah.

[02:29:33.160 --> 02:29:33.600]
Okay.

[02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:35.680]
So what does he come back and do three weeks later?

[02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:36.960]
Exactly what they told him not to.

[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:37.080]
Yeah.

[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:37.940]
Well, it was a bad mistake.

[02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:42.160]
Like I said before, it would be like if NBC fired Tom Brokhan, put Ozzy Osborne on to

[02:29:42.160 --> 02:29:42.980]
do the nightly news.

[02:29:43.180 --> 02:29:47.360]
And when the first 30 seconds, he said drop the F bomb about six times and they got all

[02:29:47.360 --> 02:29:49.080]
then out of shape and act like they were surprised.

[02:29:49.300 --> 02:29:51.820]
You know, they got exactly what they should have known they were going to get.

[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:52.620]
And it's tourists.

[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:53.080]
Yep.

[02:29:53.960 --> 02:29:54.740]
Good to hear from you.

[02:29:54.760 --> 02:29:55.540]
Now, what are you doing in there?

[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:56.260]
You're not working today.

[02:29:56.500 --> 02:30:00.000]
I'm working on a project for somebody that requires some research.

[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:01.060]
So I'm in here working.

[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:02.320]
Some research.

[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:03.920]
Hey, listen, don't overdo it, man.

[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:04.860]
No, I won't.

[02:30:05.340 --> 02:30:06.340]
Don't worry about that.

[02:30:06.800 --> 02:30:07.960]
I like your schedule this week.

[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:09.120]
You're starting to make me jealous.

[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:10.140]
What's the schedule?

[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:11.040]
I don't have a schedule.

[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:11.480]
Exactly.

[02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:12.500]
That's what I'm talking about.

[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:13.140]
Take care of something.

[02:30:13.300 --> 02:30:14.140]
I'll be back Tuesday, Neil.

[02:30:14.140 --> 02:30:14.640]
See you then.

[02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.500]
More pay and less work.

[02:30:18.680 --> 02:30:20.160]
That's the QMF in a way.

[02:30:20.300 --> 02:30:23.400]
Hey, let me tell you were the one who told me a year ago.

[02:30:23.700 --> 02:30:23.820]
Okay.

[02:30:24.220 --> 02:30:29.420]
You said just ride this gravy train and don't worry about it.

[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:30.600]
Did you not tell me that?

[02:30:31.140 --> 02:30:31.460]
Absolutely.

[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:32.640]
Thank you.

[02:30:32.640 --> 02:30:33.100]
You bet.

[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:35.420]
And I'm congratulating you.

[02:30:35.640 --> 02:30:36.580]
You're doing a hell of a job.

[02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:37.440]
And the mad dog too.

[02:30:37.500 --> 02:30:38.620]
He works about two days a month.

[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.160]
It's not a bad deal all the time.

[02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:41.200]
Now, I'll take it.

[02:30:41.300 --> 02:30:42.640]
Anyway, we're like about five minutes behind.

[02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:45.540]
One o'clock at 5'60 WQM if you're looking for a really good place

[02:30:45.540 --> 02:30:45.960]
to eat.

[02:30:46.460 --> 02:30:46.900]
Vickon herbs.

[02:30:47.040 --> 02:30:49.580]
They were around in Rochester from 1934.

[02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:52.220]
Even us old Rochesterians, I'm not quite that old,

[02:30:52.240 --> 02:30:55.340]
but at any rate, love vickon herbs and a Rochester white hot

[02:30:55.340 --> 02:30:58.140]
and all the good stuff with that special hot sauce on them.

[02:30:58.480 --> 02:31:00.020]
And now the good news for you is that vickon herbs,

[02:31:00.020 --> 02:31:01.840]
not just in Rochester, but they're on federal highway

[02:31:01.840 --> 02:31:03.260]
just south of Broadway, Bolivar, and the tunnel,

[02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:05.080]
on the east side and for Lauderdale.

[02:31:05.460 --> 02:31:07.280]
Vickon herbs is like a flashback in time

[02:31:07.280 --> 02:31:09.520]
to what great stuff used to be before fast food junk.

[02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:13.080]
Going enjoy a burger or hot dog serve hot fresh and fast.

[02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:15.820]
Vickon herbs is being brought to buy the same folks

[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:17.140]
who feed you cheaper, or cheaper.

[02:31:17.460 --> 02:31:19.960]
They use the same fresh 100% ground stock meat as cheaper

[02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:22.740]
for cheaper and offer you an incredible quarter pound hot dog.

[02:31:23.080 --> 02:31:24.480]
What makes vickon herbs different for anybody?

[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:26.840]
Also, is that like I said, the burgers and dogs

[02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:29.340]
are served with a big signature meat sauce poured on top,

[02:31:29.340 --> 02:31:31.820]
giving you accommodation flavors that'll do a tap dance

[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:32.440]
in your push.

[02:31:32.960 --> 02:31:34.340]
And if you want to try something else really good,

[02:31:34.460 --> 02:31:35.680]
they've got lots of good dishes on the menu,

[02:31:35.680 --> 02:31:37.040]
including a great breakfast menu.

[02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:39.320]
On let's cook the order, French toast, pancakes,

[02:31:39.580 --> 02:31:40.120]
all your favorites.

[02:31:40.580 --> 02:31:41.920]
So go buy vickon herbs and you'll understand

[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:44.320]
what Rochesterians have been excited about for a coons age.

[02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:45.880]
Vickon herbs, they're on federal highway

[02:31:45.880 --> 02:31:46.600]
just south of the,

[02:31:46.760 --> 02:31:48.560]
Broward, Bolivar, and the tunnel on the east side.

[02:31:48.860 --> 02:31:50.560]
Be sure and tell them that old Rochesterian,

[02:31:50.760 --> 02:31:52.120]
neo-Rodges from Brighton, New York,

[02:31:52.280 --> 02:31:53.560]
sent you by to Vick and herbs.

[02:31:54.100 --> 02:31:56.940]
Buy the local, this is five cities.

[02:31:56.940 --> 02:31:58.840]
The rain is all yours now.

[02:31:59.700 --> 02:32:00.720]
Oh, you're here!

[02:32:02.620 --> 02:32:05.040]
But it's the one to two hour.

[02:32:06.420 --> 02:32:07.980]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:10.500]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

[02:32:11.380 --> 02:32:13.120]
I was mentioned out a little.

[02:32:13.740 --> 02:32:16.360]
The other night I went there and saw the pole.

[02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:18.060]
Now you look at what got the white.

[02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:21.520]
I put on a fresh dependent before I realized

[02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:25.240]
I get a tiny cake between my dot and the bow.

[02:32:25.300 --> 02:32:25.940]
Got a mask.

[02:32:26.780 --> 02:32:28.380]
I got a diaper ring.

[02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:29.380]
Got a mask.

[02:32:29.960 --> 02:32:32.080]
From all them scenes, it's in my eyes.

[02:32:32.120 --> 02:32:32.820]
Got a mask.

[02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:34.960]
I don't like fingers at best.

[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.180]
I don't like the mask.

[02:32:36.840 --> 02:32:38.340]
I got a diaper ring.

[02:32:38.740 --> 02:32:40.880]
I think pictures with some counters

[02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:41.900]
are quite a bit easy.

[02:32:42.580 --> 02:32:45.100]
I get so the bigger than I saw this kind of beast.

[02:32:45.640 --> 02:32:48.780]
I like my finger up there when I speak to get clogged.

[02:32:49.020 --> 02:32:51.800]
From all them have written in the super-asset.

[02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:53.000]
Got a mask.

[02:32:53.820 --> 02:32:55.300]
I got a diaper ring.

[02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:56.660]
Got a mask.

[02:32:56.980 --> 02:32:58.720]
That's why I wear baggy pants.

[02:32:59.220 --> 02:32:59.840]
Got a mask.

[02:33:00.420 --> 02:33:02.020]
I get the room for gold pants.

[02:33:02.260 --> 02:33:02.740]
Got a mask.

[02:33:03.980 --> 02:33:05.360]
I got some diaper ring.

[02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:08.120]
That might be fine, but when I lose control,

[02:33:08.840 --> 02:33:12.020]
you can hear the rust when I scratch my hole.

[02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:15.100]
I scratch on a little gold mine.

[02:33:16.400 --> 02:33:18.620]
A little flat for my screw, Kennedy.

[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:22.920]
Out from my baggy pants, I'm yours in dripsy.

[02:33:22.920 --> 02:33:25.380]
You'll be so my trouble to me, baby.

[02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:29.340]
Yeah, Bob, just put a rubber band around your paws like this.

[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:32.240]
Now, how dare you touch my paws so much?

[02:33:32.320 --> 02:33:33.040]
How can I get it?

[02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:36.180]
The pain was rubbing as my paws were soy-glue.

[02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:39.340]
You see, there was only one thing I couldn't do.

[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:42.960]
I asked Kennedy to kiss my poo-goo.

[02:33:43.300 --> 02:33:44.300]
And I got a resist.

[02:33:44.980 --> 02:33:46.400]
The kiss is too much.

[02:33:47.660 --> 02:33:49.320]
I get the diaper ring.

[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:50.480]
Hey, kiss this time.

[02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:52.780]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:33:52.780 --> 02:33:54.140]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[02:33:54.140 --> 02:33:56.140]
I put a pillow on the back.

[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:57.300]
Under his back.

[02:33:58.160 --> 02:33:59.600]
And now I feel so relaxed.

[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:01.220]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:01.840 --> 02:34:03.040]
You're my roommate.

[02:34:03.600 --> 02:34:04.260]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:06.840]
You like some of my showin' in there?

[02:34:07.340 --> 02:34:07.920]
Oh, yeah.

[02:34:14.040 --> 02:34:14.660]
Absolutely.

[02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:17.000]
106 at 560 WQM.

[02:34:17.100 --> 02:34:19.180]
Don't forget, Joe and, uh, Shoe.

[02:34:19.180 --> 02:34:20.000]
Oh, Joe and Miguel.

[02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.700]
And, yes, and Rivea Yamaha have raised $700.

[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:24.800]
All right.

[02:34:25.100 --> 02:34:26.540]
And it is pro bono for Joe.

[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:28.420]
Thanks, Joe.

[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:29.800]
But he still should have been there on time.

[02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:30.580]
Because he used to work there.

[02:34:31.140 --> 02:34:31.660]
He what?

[02:34:31.860 --> 02:34:32.960]
He used to work there, so it's not.

[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:33.300]
Oh, he did.

[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:34.260]
He used to work at Rivea Yamaha.

[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:35.640]
Well, listen, don't put your night job.

[02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:39.120]
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

[02:34:40.900 --> 02:34:42.760]
Anyway, 3671 North-XI Highway Pompano Beach.

[02:34:42.820 --> 02:34:44.140]
That's Dixie and Sample.

[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:46.620]
For those of you who need to come up as an aerodonap,

[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:47.420]
how much again?

[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:48.120]
700 and what?

[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:49.840]
700 and zero.

[02:34:50.480 --> 02:34:51.340]
700 and zero.

[02:34:51.460 --> 02:34:52.420]
But that's a good first hour.

[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:54.400]
Now, if we could do that again in the second hour,

[02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:56.540]
we could do like a 14, 15-number bucks today

[02:34:56.540 --> 02:34:57.860]
for band-of-pepperous youths about time.

[02:34:58.140 --> 02:34:59.120]
Get wet, folks, okay?

[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:00.480]
Spring was with a little cash.

[02:35:01.420 --> 02:35:01.620]
Right.

[02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:04.100]
For those poor little dogs at cats and, uh,

[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:05.940]
parrots and parakeets and cockatoo.

[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:07.360]
Let's get with it.

[02:35:08.300 --> 02:35:10.840]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, Pomp, 5, 60.

[02:35:10.980 --> 02:35:12.500]
So you heard it right from the horses mouth

[02:35:12.500 --> 02:35:13.480]
from the hump, or anisha note,

[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:15.140]
because he's about to be inside track, chest.

[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:16.480]
Harden that expression of the ESPN,

[02:35:16.480 --> 02:35:17.880]
and make no mistake about it,

[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:19.360]
because he happens to work there.

[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:21.440]
And so, like I'd put it in the beginning of the show,

[02:35:21.520 --> 02:35:22.340]
there was no resignation.

[02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:23.840]
They asked for his resignation.

[02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:25.360]
They said, about a way you're fired,

[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:26.640]
but if you want to make it look like you could,

[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:28.060]
uh, we'll do whatever you want.

[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:30.380]
Just like what happens all the time.

[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:31.420]
Who would have been too embarrassing,

[02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:33.200]
especially after only four weeks to say,

[02:35:33.500 --> 02:35:35.540]
you're fired to the, you know, that would have been bad.

[02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:38.860]
Here's Miami Beach.

[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:39.240]
Hello.

[02:35:39.760 --> 02:35:40.320]
Hi, Neil.

[02:35:40.800 --> 02:35:41.180]
Yes, sir.

[02:35:41.540 --> 02:35:43.620]
With all these skeletons flying out of the closet,

[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:46.440]
maybe Russia's celebrating Halloween early this year.

[02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:50.400]
And maybe he's head-spin on Ferell's,

[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:53.040]
you know, you're having such a problem with Mo and Greg

[02:35:53.040 --> 02:35:54.320]
and your, uh, your agent,

[02:35:54.500 --> 02:35:57.760]
maybe, uh, Russia was hedging in on their pill supply or something.

[02:35:59.140 --> 02:35:59.840]
Okay, great.

[02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:00.180]
Excellent.

[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.440]
I put on your thinking cap and we'll all sit down,

[02:36:02.440 --> 02:36:03.620]
like put our hand to our forehead

[02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:05.240]
and try to figure out what the hell he was talking about.

[02:36:05.460 --> 02:36:06.020]
Do you have any idea?

[02:36:06.100 --> 02:36:06.520]
No, no.

[02:36:07.940 --> 02:36:09.400]
Neil Rogers 83.

[02:36:09.720 --> 02:36:10.900]
I'm an asshole, man.

[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:14.040]
I might have to play Dennis Lurie before the end of the show today,

[02:36:14.060 --> 02:36:15.880]
even though this is a pull that'll go out for tomorrow.

[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:18.640]
Because I don't think anybody's going to even come close.

[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:19.040]
No.

[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.320]
Do you?

[02:36:20.940 --> 02:36:23.020]
Nobody has even in my league, man.

[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:27.940]
But that's four and a half minutes.

[02:36:28.060 --> 02:36:28.680]
I could just play.

[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:29.420]
Asshole.

[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:30.080]
Just play that.

[02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:32.660]
Anyway, I got 84 votes.

[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:34.740]
Somebody who think is an asshole, but you enjoy their work.

[02:36:34.880 --> 02:36:35.920]
I'm pleased as punch.

[02:36:36.440 --> 02:36:38.320]
Or speaking of assholes, there's Bob Novak.

[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:40.520]
Mohawar David in 22.

[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:41.860]
He's tag with Michael Jackson.

[02:36:42.060 --> 02:36:43.220]
I see a lot of similarities there.

[02:36:43.340 --> 02:36:43.740]
Absolutely.

[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:45.020]
22.

[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:45.960]
A piece.

[02:36:46.340 --> 02:36:47.060]
Woody Allen 18.

[02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:48.080]
Russell Crowe 18.

Dick Clark 17 for Dick.

[02:36:50.540 --> 02:36:52.080]
Billy Bob Thornton, that was your choice.

[02:36:52.260 --> 02:36:52.560]
15.

[02:36:52.900 --> 02:36:54.220]
Hank Oldberg 11 for the Humper.

[02:36:54.920 --> 02:36:55.700]
Chuck Heston 10.

Howard Spurms, God nine.

[02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:58.220]
Richard Dawson, only six.

[02:36:58.640 --> 02:36:59.460]
I don't understand that.

[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:01.420]
I guess they don't like his work because it's a time thing again.

[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:01.740]
Right.

[02:37:02.220 --> 02:37:04.200]
You have to be an old fart like me and Vokabrion to enjoy.

[02:37:04.500 --> 02:37:05.760]
The original family feud.

[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:07.940]
And also what you call it.

[02:37:07.940 --> 02:37:08.480]
Hogan Thieros.

[02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:09.640]
Hogan Thieros.

[02:37:09.680 --> 02:37:11.080]
And what about with Jean-Rabur, Mashgame?

[02:37:11.580 --> 02:37:11.740]
Okay.

[02:37:12.240 --> 02:37:13.600]
When his run go get a little bit to the three.

[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:14.120]
I'll show you all of it.

[02:37:14.440 --> 02:37:19.160]
Rick Riley 5, Bill O'Rally 5, James Cameron 5, PD Rose's got three.

[02:37:20.180 --> 02:37:21.380]
Chris Codd has got one.

[02:37:21.720 --> 02:37:23.300]
George Lucas won a Robert Downey Jr.

[02:37:23.540 --> 02:37:24.160]
Don't have any.

[02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:25.380]
None.

[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:27.840]
Which means there are probably a lot of people out there

[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:30.020]
think he's an asshole, but they don't enjoy his work yet.

[02:37:30.220 --> 02:37:31.260]
At least not enough to vote for him.

[02:37:31.500 --> 02:37:32.680]
Out of 252 votes.

[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:33.200]
We're getting there.

[02:37:34.220 --> 02:37:35.460]
Seven hundred bucks in the first hour.

[02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:36.180]
That's pretty damn good.

[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:37.020]
I'm going to have to get a review on the home of their

[02:37:37.020 --> 02:37:38.920]
Palm Pato Beach on the quarter of Dixie in Sanford Road.

[02:37:38.980 --> 02:37:39.500]
Let's get with it.

[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:39.920]
Let's go.

[02:37:40.340 --> 02:37:42.240]
Let's get this fundraiser on the.

[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:43.660]
Well now it's October.

[02:37:43.660 --> 02:37:47.260]
See, so I mean, because ordinarily every year we do October, November, December, right?

[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:47.600]
Right.

[02:37:48.540 --> 02:37:50.500]
And even though, of course, it is the Jew holidays.

[02:37:51.840 --> 02:37:52.920]
Here's West Palm Beach.

[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:53.160]
Hello.

[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:53.880]
Hi, Neil.

[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:54.620]
Yes, sir.

[02:37:55.200 --> 02:37:56.640]
Speaking of right wingers.

[02:37:57.080 --> 02:37:57.260]
Yes.

[02:37:58.060 --> 02:38:01.140]
Last night, Phil Hendry made the statement that I racked.

[02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:01.620]
Are you sure?

[02:38:01.940 --> 02:38:04.840]
I had been training and funding terrorists.

[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.920]
Now, you know, even the Bush administration has had to admit that there was no evidence of that.

[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.140]
Isn't it amazing how some of these people had this coincidental conversion these last few months?

[02:38:15.720 --> 02:38:18.680]
He's just like going off the deep end.

[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:19.140]
Yeah.

[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:21.420]
And I just make it a little statement.

[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:24.480]
You know, Iraq was a threat to this country.

[02:38:24.660 --> 02:38:27.520]
But he was serious when he was saying this because with Phil, you really have to know.

[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:28.920]
No, no, no, this was serious.

[02:38:29.160 --> 02:38:29.620]
Not stick.

[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:30.920]
It wasn't it wasn't a bit.

[02:38:30.920 --> 02:38:32.980]
It was when he was serious.

[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:37.320]
And just unreal, you know, it's.

[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:47.840]
The thing, you know, with this right wing talk radio, I mean, it's bad for the country because, you know, there's no other view.

[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:48.420]
Right.

[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:54.240]
And even though Gordon, I was talking about getting a whole of news world from CBC and making it into a.

[02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:55.480]
A slanted left.

[02:38:55.480 --> 02:38:59.560]
See, as far as I'm concerned, all the TV news shouldn't be left or right.

[02:38:59.620 --> 02:39:02.340]
It should be like, honest, tell us what's really going on like CBC.

[02:39:02.640 --> 02:39:04.060]
I know that's a revolutionary concept.

[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:08.180]
But as far as talk radio, which is based on people's opinions, you're right.

[02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:09.880]
You know, they've been talking for over a year now.

[02:39:09.980 --> 02:39:14.340]
Oh, we're going to have this liberal talk that where can I tell you was never going to happen.

[02:39:14.340 --> 02:39:15.660]
And I probably won't.

[02:39:15.700 --> 02:39:16.500]
I don't think it's going to happen.

[02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:22.020]
Well, you know, everything that the Bush administration made though about this war, every claim.

[02:39:22.820 --> 02:39:23.660]
Was I long?

[02:39:24.140 --> 02:39:25.020]
I went on Buzz Flash.

[02:39:25.660 --> 02:39:29.420]
I'd go on the same day and make you shoot the thing down completely.

[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:30.040]

[02:39:30.040 --> 02:39:35.560]
But you never saw it in the, you know, major media or on talk radio or anything, you know.

[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:42.060]
So like I say, it's become a real danger to the country, you know, it's censorship.

[02:39:42.940 --> 02:39:44.160]
Get that passport out, man.

[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:44.840]
I'll see you at the border.

[02:39:45.140 --> 02:39:45.440]
Okay.

[02:39:45.740 --> 02:39:46.340]
Okay. Good luck.

[02:39:47.360 --> 02:39:49.600]
560, 705, 60, pound 560.

[02:39:49.720 --> 02:39:52.340]
I'll be the one that the fat one rolled across Niagara Falls in a barrel.

[02:39:53.760 --> 02:39:55.880]
I'll extend a hand of friendship across the border.

[02:39:56.220 --> 02:39:57.840]
It's election day and Ontario today.

[02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:02.580]
We're going to say goodbye to the conservatives, which quite frankly, I know very little about Canadian politics.

[02:40:02.780 --> 02:40:06.500]
Under then, you know, it's also screwed up and there's a lot of losers like Ernie Eves.

[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:10.080]
But how the conservatives ever got a hold of Ontario of this sub-provence?

[02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:10.520]
I don't know.

[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.240]
Because tomorrow's got the overwhelming majority of the population in the province.

[02:40:14.240 --> 02:40:17.460]
And Toronto is so liberal, it's almost scary even to me, you know, progressive.

[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:18.000]
Yes.

[02:40:18.080 --> 02:40:18.780]
It's a good word, progressive.

[02:40:19.020 --> 02:40:20.060]
I want to say liberal, that's bad.

[02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:24.880]
Although they even call them the liberals, the party, the liberals in the Tories and the NDP.

[02:40:25.480 --> 02:40:28.660]
The new Democratic Party, which is a bunch of conservatives also, can't figure them out.

[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:30.840]
But they're saying goodbye to Ernie Eves today.

[02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:32.500]
He's like about 20 points behind in the polls.

[02:40:32.680 --> 02:40:33.840]
Bye-bye Ernie or a loser.

[02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:35.360]
And it's going to replace him.

[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:37.400]
Darren McGinnies got a personality like a food fly.

[02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:39.380]
He doesn't have one.

[02:40:39.740 --> 02:40:43.320]
Here's the fact that it says, Mr. Limbaugh, meet your new neighbor.

[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:47.420]
I love it, meet your new neighbor.

[02:40:48.080 --> 02:40:49.820]
Mrs. Goldfarb, hey, Sarah.

[02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:52.280]
Come on, Sarah, let's do a little dance for Rush.

[02:40:52.860 --> 02:40:53.560]
There we go.

[02:40:55.700 --> 02:40:57.900]
Oh, the dog, the big dog.

[02:40:58.480 --> 02:40:58.840]
The big dog.

[02:40:59.060 --> 02:40:59.760]
The big dog.

[02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:00.100]

[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:02.480]
All the ditto heads calling him with their whole eye.

[02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:04.720]
Don't like Rush but act is so lame.

[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:06.280]
It says, you people are pathetic.

[02:41:06.560 --> 02:41:09.020]
Rush could have been a huge steaming pile of crap from his rectum.

[02:41:09.300 --> 02:41:09.860]
And if he told you.

[02:41:11.060 --> 02:41:13.220]
This is the best facts of all time.

[02:41:13.460 --> 02:41:13.940]
Continue.

[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:17.460]
Rush could have made a huge steaming pile of crap from his rectum.

[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:19.840]
And if he told you it was cotton candy, you would lick it clean.

[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:22.260]
Oh, you are absolutely correct.

[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:26.300]
Newsflags from the obesity and broadcasting network all ditto heads.

[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:29.340]
Rush just announced that all good conservative Americans must discharge

[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:31.780]
a 45 caliber bullet to their skull immediately.

[02:41:32.020 --> 02:41:33.680]
It's the conservative thing to do.

[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:36.680]
If you don't, you're just a stinking American,

[02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:37.880]
you can hate American hating liberal.

[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:39.540]
I'm saving this facts.

[02:41:39.980 --> 02:41:41.260]
That is great.

[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:43.120]
I love it.

[02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:46.040]
He could have made a huge steaming pile.

[02:41:46.160 --> 02:41:48.520]
They probably be picking up for seeds but for like pills, you know.

[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:52.340]
Do you have to have like an acarpit business they call them remnants?

[02:41:57.800 --> 02:41:59.100]
Oh, look at that.

[02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:00.860]
That looks like an oxymoron pill over there.

[02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:02.520]
Undozole chunks.

[02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:03.220]
Grab it.

[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:06.280]
Yeah, if we only swallow that now, we can be just as smart as Rush.

[02:42:08.600 --> 02:42:12.820]
114 if five reminds me of this pickup truck driving guy.

[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:16.720]
I put it that's the right immobile station nearby at 595 in the Nub Hill or wherever.

[02:42:17.180 --> 02:42:17.540]
Flamingo.

[02:42:17.760 --> 02:42:18.120]
Flamingo.

[02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:22.760]
It's a few years ago when I was at the misfortune of being there all the time.

[02:42:23.500 --> 02:42:27.320]
And I pull in one day and it's like, I don't know, like 240, 230.

[02:42:28.700 --> 02:42:30.480]
And the guys, you know, he's outside.

[02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:31.860]
He's filling the gap. He's got the radio.

[02:42:31.940 --> 02:42:33.920]
Oh, I'm sorry, Neil. I'm listening to Rush.

[02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:42.220]
Even his doberman looking fierce back in the back of the pickup in the cab.

[02:42:43.140 --> 02:42:46.340]
Hey, if you're underpaid and overworked, if your paycheck isn't even enough to talk about,

See them on the sidewalk.

Oh, you're them shuffling feet.

That's 1-8,000 assholes doing assholes from the maze.

[02:44:40.980 --> 02:44:45.200]
Step aside good people as the assholes are afraid.

[02:44:54.440 --> 02:44:57.180]
You got the assholes for freedom.

[02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:13.660]
The assholes are all good.

[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:27.740]
We've got assholes making money, we're making all the rules,

[02:45:28.080 --> 02:45:32.660]
We're taking all our jobs, and they're filling us by schools.

[02:45:33.540 --> 02:45:37.220]
Assholes on the water, assholes on the skies,

[02:45:37.860 --> 02:45:42.040]
And the city of wanted only assholes made them fly.

[02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:55.980]
Oh teach you what you tell me, and I really made the grade.

[02:45:56.720 --> 02:46:03.120]
I have my class, or am I just another asshole on the grade?

[02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:33.920]
Assholes get the orders, and assholes grow to boat.

[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:38.720]
Assholes get elected, because assholes get some votes.

[02:46:39.320 --> 02:46:43.400]
I once heard it said, that all assholes never die,

[02:46:43.980 --> 02:46:48.060]
And they just lay in your bed, and you get a small piece of life.

[02:46:48.760 --> 02:46:50.440]
Assholes in the morning,

[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:57.500]
Assholes every night, assholes to land, and assholes to the grave.

[02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:02.080]
Assholes get the 40,000 assholes to land, assholes around the land.

[02:47:02.780 --> 02:47:06.900]
That's a side good people in the assholes on the rain.

[02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:19.040]
The 40,000 assholes are in the air, and they're in the air.

[02:47:21.220 --> 02:47:25.080]
The 40,000 assholes are in the air, and they're in the air.

[02:47:25.080 --> 02:47:26.440]
The 40,000 assholes are in the air, and they're in the air.

[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.860]
The 40,000 assholes are in the air, and they're in the air.

[02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:36.880]
The 40,000 assholes are in the air, and they're in the air.

[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:39.300]
And then you got five o'clock.

[02:47:39.620 --> 02:47:44.260]
It's Huracun's game day, because 730 is the Huracun's in the West Virginia Mountain Ears.

[02:47:44.720 --> 02:47:45.980]
Everybody whooped them about that game.

[02:47:46.180 --> 02:47:49.160]
And I don't know what's on after, or till 1130, so that's enough.

[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:54.360]
How we doing out there at the River Yamaha, thanks again to Joe Castella for probably help set that up,

[02:47:54.380 --> 02:47:58.320]
because he used to work there, and for helping us out, as opposed to ripping him and ass for being nearly an hour late.

[02:47:58.560 --> 02:47:58.740]
Yeah.

[02:47:59.720 --> 02:48:00.980]
And we got 700 and what?

[02:48:01.420 --> 02:48:02.440]
Oh, I don't know, no new report.

[02:48:02.840 --> 02:48:05.060]
Okay, so there must be lined up out there for the rest of the year.

[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:07.240]
I was out taking a pee, so they could have called.

[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:08.500]
He may have been trying to call desperately.

[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:12.660]
A high school student has the right to wear a t-shirt to school with a face of president Bush,

[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:15.940]
and the words international terrorist on the front of federal judges ruled.

[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:16.280]
Oh!

[02:48:17.580 --> 02:48:21.480]
There was no evidence that the t-shirt created any disturbance or disruption.

[02:48:21.620 --> 02:48:26.300]
US District Judge Pactral J. Duggan said in a ruling release yesterday by the ACLU of Michigan

[02:48:26.300 --> 02:48:29.940]
would sue the Dearborn School District on behalf of Bretton Barber.

[02:48:31.160 --> 02:48:36.000]
An assistant principal at ordered Barber to provide a concealing anti-Bush message or go home.

[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:39.740]
Dearborn High said a word about inflaming passions of the suburban Detroit School,

[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:42.000]
where majority of the students are Arab American.

[02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:48.420]
But the judge said the record doesn't reveal any basis for the assistant principal's fear aside from his belief

[02:48:48.420 --> 02:48:51.620]
that the t-shirt conveyed an unpopular political message.

[02:48:52.880 --> 02:48:55.100]
Attorneys for the school district declined to come out of the case.

[02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:57.920]
There was no answer at their office's Wednesday night at their office.

[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:05.100]
The court's decision reaffirms the principal that students don't give up their right to express opinions on matters of public importance once they enter school,

[02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:09.180]
carrying Ma's executive director of the state ACLU said in news release yesterday.

[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:14.840]
Barber was 16 when he wore the shirt on a day he was scheduled to present a comparing contrast essay in English class.

[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:19.580]
Barber had chosen to compare president Bush to former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.

[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:24.960]
At the time, Bretton said he wanted to express his anti-war position by wearing the shirt which he ordered on the Internet.

[02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:32.060]
International terrorist on the front and president Bush, I wonder where we get those on the Internet?

[02:49:32.740 --> 02:49:34.120]
Somewhere, okay, well we'll find out.

[02:49:34.900 --> 02:49:37.560]
We'll find out, we'll get the website for us so everybody can order one.

[02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:39.160]
They're finally starting to catch on.

[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:46.360]
56670560.560 on the AT&T. Michael Mayo had a good comedy, might actually read some of it about 10 words.

[02:49:47.020 --> 02:49:48.600]
Actually made some sense, nice going Mike.

[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:50.100]
Once a year he really comes through.

[02:49:50.840 --> 02:49:51.760]
Here's Miami, hello.

[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:53.280]
Hey, Neil.

[02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:54.040]
Yes sir.

[02:49:54.560 --> 02:49:55.160]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:49:55.540 --> 02:49:55.960]
Pretty good.

[02:49:56.500 --> 02:49:58.940]
Hey, I got a suggestion for you Paul.

[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:00.360]
Okay.

[02:50:00.920 --> 02:50:01.460]
Bob Costa.

[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:02.420]
Who?

[02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:05.320]
Bob Costa, whatever in the name of it.

[02:50:05.340 --> 02:50:07.440]
Bob Costa is Bob Costa's.

[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:09.260]
Yeah, little twerp, okay?

[02:50:09.700 --> 02:50:11.400]
Yeah, he's not a big ass, he's a little one.

[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:12.560]
He's a schmuck.

[02:50:13.080 --> 02:50:15.220]
Hey, you want to choose back?

[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:19.160]
For every soldier that dies, we send two Republicans over there.

[02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:23.940]
Okay, for every soldier that dies, we send two thousand Republicans out of the country.

[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:24.940]
Good idea.

[02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:25.520]
Good thing, man.

[02:50:25.620 --> 02:50:25.920]
Nice going.

[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:26.480]
Have a good day.

[02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:28.820]
Bob Costa, you got a little bobby under there.

[02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:30.180]
Let's dribble up, not a cord, huh?

[02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:33.120]
I could kind of like dribble down my chin when I think of Bob Costa.

[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:34.940]
She makes me feel like he has such a twerp.

[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:37.680]
Such a, oh, in fact, didn't we do a twerk pull?

[02:50:38.420 --> 02:50:39.700]
I'm not sure we did, we should.

[02:50:40.160 --> 02:50:40.700]
I never should.

[02:50:40.800 --> 02:50:42.800]
Because Geldy would have to be under the twerk pull.

[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:43.920]
I don't care what you say.

[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:44.960]
He's just a tall twerp.

[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:45.680]
Okay.

[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:47.740]
Bob Costa is a little, a widowed twerp.

[02:50:47.740 --> 02:50:48.400]
He's just like a widowed dwarf.

[02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:49.220]
He's a widowed twerp.

[02:50:50.440 --> 02:50:52.360]
Neo Rogers 93 votes, man.

[02:50:52.480 --> 02:50:54.120]
Am I an asshole or what?

[02:50:54.280 --> 02:50:54.820]
And proud of it.

[02:50:56.200 --> 02:50:58.100]
Somebody who thinks is an asshole that enjoys it.

[02:50:58.200 --> 02:50:59.540]
I've seen it in the beginning.

[02:50:59.540 --> 02:51:02.000]
I thought, well, that's very negative, but it's very positive.

[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:06.360]
Yes, because even though they think I'm the world's biggest asshole or at least I'm in the running,

[02:51:07.040 --> 02:51:08.500]
they love the show so much.

[02:51:08.700 --> 02:51:10.600]
They cannot bring themselves to say goodbye.

[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:13.300]
Like that fixed it, Carter, that was screaming in hyperventilating.

[02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:16.620]
If you missed that call, boys and girls, you missed one of the great calls of all time.

[02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:23.660]
Even a butchered calf, even Linda Lovelace never screamed like that, even when Harry reamed.

[02:51:25.860 --> 02:51:32.140]
Neo Rogers 93, Michael Jackson 23, Moa Howard David in 22, Woody Allen 22, Russell Crowe 20,

[02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:33.500]
asshole votes.

[02:51:34.220 --> 02:51:36.580]

Hank Goldberg 16 for the Humper, 13 for Howard Spurm, 11 for Chuck Heston,

[02:51:41.860 --> 02:51:46.240]
everybody else including the anxious Bill O'Reilly small potato single digits.

[02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:51.280]
This is Courts 20 on 5-6.

[02:51:52.120 --> 02:51:52.680]
QAM.

[02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:53.060]
All right.

[02:53:01.840 --> 02:53:02.340]
Oh.

[02:53:05.400 --> 02:53:05.900]
Oh.

[02:53:07.100 --> 02:53:07.600]
Oh.

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:07.600]

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:07.600]

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:07.600]

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:07.600]

[02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:07.620]
Oh.

[02:53:07.640 --> 02:53:07.660]
Oh.

[02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:07.700]
Oh.

[02:53:07.720 --> 02:53:07.740]
Oh.

[02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:07.760]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.060 --> 02:53:08.060]

[02:53:08.340 --> 02:53:08.780]
Oh.

[02:53:10.820 --> 02:53:11.040]
Oh.

[02:53:11.040 --> 02:53:11.260]
Oh.

[02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:18.380]
No.

[02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:33.340]
Venus has herself achieved her best in overjoy parking pony since I've seen her before on this public holiday.

[02:53:33.340 --> 02:53:35.640]
I've thought of ways to think of you, but that never did go too fast to think, so...

[02:53:35.640 --> 02:53:41.020]
In machst o' fight, she moves to hell.

[02:53:41.020 --> 02:53:44.640]

[02:53:44.640 --> 02:53:47.480]

[02:53:47.480 --> 02:53:51.380]
playing bush boss we got to get a thousand today also some incredible news from

[02:53:51.380 --> 02:53:55.500]
the Palm Beach post which I'm just checking online they're doing a pool today

[02:53:55.500 --> 02:53:58.660]
how do you feel about Rush Labos resignation following comments about Donovan

[02:53:58.660 --> 02:54:02.320]
McNabb there's eighteen hundred and twelve votes I keep in mind this is in very

[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:10.500]
very right-wingish Palm Beach okay okay 49% say he had to go voluntarily or

[02:54:10.500 --> 02:54:15.820]
otherwise 49% say no action by ESPN or limbaugh was needed and put a two

[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:19.040]
percent say he should have apologized to McNabb and have been reprimanded

[02:54:19.040 --> 02:54:25.580]
nothing more so it's about 50 50 how do you like that impressive as opposed

[02:54:25.580 --> 02:54:29.580]
to the usual overwhelming diddlehead the response you'd expect to get and the

[02:54:29.580 --> 02:54:33.700]
best news of all is and see I forgot about this and I probably could have

[02:54:33.700 --> 02:54:37.060]

[02:54:37.060 --> 02:54:40.600]

56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon

[03:06:37.000 --> 03:06:39.940]
Lyraless line here's Miami. Hello

[03:06:39.940 --> 03:06:42.140]
Hello, yes, sir

[03:06:42.140 --> 03:06:45.600]
I'd like to convey to you

[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:52.520]
Yeah, one is I think I have a solution for a 3000 year follow between the Muslims and the Jews

[03:06:53.420 --> 03:06:57.940]
And I think it would be if the children were me each other and they would have marriages and uh and have children

[03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:00.280]
There would be no more war right

[03:07:00.740 --> 03:07:03.980]
You know everybody in the world's got to enter married by the end of the week

[03:07:04.640 --> 03:07:05.020]
Or

[03:07:05.020 --> 03:07:07.620]
I think that uh sports and nigger

[03:07:09.240 --> 03:07:10.900]
See the way he said that just means

[03:07:10.900 --> 03:07:14.980]
No, I mean he said sports and nigger and I mean he but the way he said that leads me to wonder

[03:07:16.080 --> 03:07:16.840]
56705 60

[03:07:17.700 --> 03:07:21.360]
Plus it's almost two o'clock you know, I'm saying why at this point uh invite

[03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:27.600]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon he doesn't have good point though

[03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:32.220]
There's a lot of interracial marriage here in Toronto and as a result you have a lot of people like you can't really tell what they are

[03:07:32.220 --> 03:07:36.140]
You know, I mean and I really mean in every sense. I say which makes it pretty interesting

[03:07:36.140 --> 03:07:41.660]
You're like you know unwrapping the package exactly well. What is that and what the hell is that?

[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:42.660]
There's like that

[03:07:43.640 --> 03:07:51.080]
Here's Miami. What is this? Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I have a spire report and the question go ahead

[03:07:51.080 --> 03:07:54.520]
I was just down at the Marlins office in little Havana

[03:07:55.180 --> 03:07:59.080]
And the line is around the corner. Oh, all right

[03:07:59.760 --> 03:08:03.500]
I also wondered if I could go on hold for the free Marlins tickets

[03:08:07.280 --> 03:08:12.100]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[03:08:12.100 --> 03:08:16.380]
But we had a lot of people earlier admitted that their bandwagon jumpers did not real Marlin fans

[03:08:16.380 --> 03:08:18.740]
But it's something good. You know, if you come across something good

[03:08:18.740 --> 03:08:23.200]
You want to squeeze it and feel it and hold it and savor it and sniff it and lick it and things like that

[03:08:24.720 --> 03:08:27.820]
Just like that pilot rush left that all those little heads want to lick

[03:08:27.820 --> 03:08:29.980]
I'm saving this facts forever. I'm going to read it again

[03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:36.480]
Because it's so good. This could be one of the all-time greatest facts is not just on this show, but in a history of the human race

[03:08:37.880 --> 03:08:42.500]
All the ditto heads calling in with their whole. I don't like rush butt act is so lame

[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:47.360]
You people are pathetic rush could he made a huge steaming pile of crap from his rectum

[03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.240]
And if he told you was cotton candy you would lick it clean

[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:54.740]
Mr. Limbaugh meet your new neighbor Mrs. Goldfarb aka Sarah

[03:08:55.600 --> 03:09:04.080]
And it says newsflash from eib the obesity and broadcasting network all ditto heads rush just announced that all good conservative Americans must discharge a

[03:09:04.080 --> 03:09:10.100]
45 caliber bullets into their skull immediately. It's the conservative thing to do if you don't you're just thinking

[03:09:10.100 --> 03:09:13.620]
America hating liberal greatest facts ever from my

[03:09:13.620 --> 03:09:15.220]
rums squatten

[03:09:16.440 --> 03:09:20.380]
10 till two we got the mad dog at two no hopper today because he's been over work

[03:09:20.380 --> 03:09:22.880]
I didn't help him just come in and chat with us briefly

[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:27.520]
Told us that from his sources at ESPN. There was no question about a rush limbaugh did not resign

[03:09:27.520 --> 03:09:32.040]
He was told to resign he was canned they canned rushes ass

[03:09:32.560 --> 03:09:35.140]
And of course the ditto heads will be wanting to know where they can buy it

[03:09:35.940 --> 03:09:41.940]
They want that show afford over the hunker hurricane game day at six hercones at a West Virginia mountaineers another girl's school tonight

[03:09:41.940 --> 03:09:43.920]
Are they any good West Virginia? Scott?

[03:09:44.460 --> 03:09:50.320]
No, not really like I said the hercones pound out another girl's school right there in the orange bull 732 night

[03:09:53.840 --> 03:09:55.360]
Dante

[03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:05.500]
jumpin' wllop Committin'

[03:10:07.680 --> 03:10:07.680]

[03:10:15.360 --> 03:10:16.680]
Skinny

[03:10:16.680 --> 03:10:16.800]
Sweet

[03:10:16.800 --> 03:10:18.160]
David Sullenwater, the PV

[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:22.680]
Oh A black aque musicians

[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:23.340]
Incident적인

[03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:27.100]
Christian Supercells, we've finally been ordered

[03:10:27.100 --> 03:10:31.960]
While fondling their nuts, oh, I'd love to know, I'd love to know

[03:10:31.960 --> 03:10:38.540]
What Christian Supercells, most of why they take me from the factory gate

[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:43.300]
They're telling that to macaroni and cheese

[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:46.940]
Gun holes in the bitch, he just in case they reproduce

[03:10:48.080 --> 03:10:52.840]
That's just a battle they're allowed to do

[03:10:55.180 --> 03:10:59.200]
Why love to know, why love to know, why love to know

[03:10:59.200 --> 03:11:03.300]
Why love to know, why love to know, why love to know

[03:11:08.620 --> 03:11:13.120]
Do they get us rolling, huh? While meaning out their gun, whoa

[03:11:13.120 --> 03:11:17.660]
Why love to know, why love to know, what Christian Supercells

[03:11:17.660 --> 03:11:21.700]
Do they polish up the fish, on the tailgate of their truck

[03:11:21.700 --> 03:11:26.300]
Where do they get us? Why love to know, why love to know, why love to know, what Christian Supercells

[03:11:27.220 --> 03:11:30.900]
See that standing heat and sit back down, I can't get you

[03:11:31.540 --> 03:11:35.260]
They watch it all down with their twelfack of fruit

[03:11:35.900 --> 03:11:40.040]
Give a life aboard a puff of heaven you go

[03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:44.260]
Got only smile the fun, holding that song

[03:11:45.440 --> 03:11:48.080]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[03:11:48.080 --> 03:11:55.900]
I'd love to know, why love to know, why love to know, why love to know, why love to know, why love to know

[03:12:06.260 --> 03:12:07.340]
All right, back on air

[03:12:08.420 --> 03:12:08.780]
Good

[03:12:09.240 --> 03:12:11.880]
How's that pull coming on the Palm Beach post-blog away?

[03:12:15.160 --> 03:12:17.480]
Oh yes, see all the ditto heads are running out

[03:12:17.480 --> 03:12:19.660]
No action by ESPN or limbaugh was needed

[03:12:20.480 --> 03:12:25.360]
2150, well of course in the middle of when his fill in his on air, probably not a good idea to be looking at it

[03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:31.820]
51% like 47% but even 47% said he had to go one way or the other, had to go

[03:12:32.720 --> 03:12:36.320]
Anything to call from Palm Beach is a mighty important about that Palm Beach, hello?

[03:12:36.820 --> 03:12:37.980]
Good afternoon Neil

[03:12:37.980 --> 03:12:38.780]
Yes sir

[03:12:38.780 --> 03:12:44.320]
I'm like to talk about this controversy for Scott and the Nav for a second if I made it

[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:45.760]
Time's up

[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:46.700]
Hello

[03:12:46.700 --> 03:12:48.680]
Go ahead, he said for a second

[03:12:48.680 --> 03:12:55.880]
So I went, he's the only job he's been now is black man and let's look at them then by trying to make a joke of this

[03:12:56.600 --> 03:13:02.100]
And no, Corbin, he can pay two positions that black man can play opposition

[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:03.900]
You agree?

[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:09.940]
Yeah, sure black man can play opposition, is he going to do like prone positions that going to be next?

[03:13:10.420 --> 03:13:12.820]
Pull position, pull position, you know that one too

[03:13:12.820 --> 03:13:17.500]
Anyway, yeah bad fake voice, sweet heart arena deal, I'm so glad that it was a useless call

[03:13:17.500 --> 03:13:21.760]
The one said Palm Beach, I thought maybe for just a second and now wasn't

[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:25.440]
Michael Mayo, sweet heart arena deal, leave sour taste

[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:29.480]
And this is just a warning because of all the enthusiasm and the excitement about the Marlins

[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:32.760]
And they're having a big year and they want to game in a playoffs yesterday and they want one in series

[03:13:32.760 --> 03:13:35.640]
And who knows maybe even go to the World Series and win it again like 97

[03:13:35.640 --> 03:13:42.560]
But it says, do you remember about how all like the big business with the Panthers

[03:13:42.560 --> 03:13:47.560]
Was build as a win-win all around public private partnership when he built the Macarena

[03:13:48.240 --> 03:13:52.260]
Says five years after the National Hockey League franchise moved from Miami to its

[03:13:52.260 --> 03:13:58.680]
Pollatial Sunrise digs, here's how the scorecard reads, the Panthers take of the arena profits $53.7 million

[03:13:59.260 --> 03:14:03.620]
Rowered counties take out of that $331,000

[03:14:03.620 --> 03:14:08.320]
For those who prefer their eye popping figures and percentages, Michael Holda Mayo says

[03:14:08.320 --> 03:14:13.640]
That's 99.4% of the team and 6.10% of 1% to us suckers

[03:14:15.200 --> 03:14:19.260]
It's not meeting our expectations County Finance Director Phil Allen said yesterday

[03:14:19.260 --> 03:14:21.420]
And here's where a bad deal gets even worse

[03:14:22.520 --> 03:14:27.420]
All the rosy revenue projections about the arena, the ones that showed the ridiculously high threshold for

[03:14:27.420 --> 03:14:29.800]
Profituring finally kicking in are out the window

[03:14:30.320 --> 03:14:33.760]
They're out the window, all the money was supposed to be flowing into the County's general conference

[03:14:33.760 --> 03:14:37.960]
Might never even materialize the transit out positive Allen said under the 30 year agreement

[03:14:37.960 --> 03:14:43.300]
The team's allowed to keep the first 14 million annual arena profit after paying a cheer of debt to the Yadi Yadi

[03:14:43.300 --> 03:14:46.500]
And it's another worst make a long story short, it's another boom doggle

[03:14:47.200 --> 03:14:52.140]
County ain't making squat, the team sucks, it's already been sold once

[03:14:53.660 --> 03:14:57.180]
And who knows what evil lurch waiting for another non-playoff season

[03:14:57.180 --> 03:15:00.160]
And of course the lockout the following season, which is highly probable

[03:15:00.720 --> 03:15:01.920]
See what I'm saying George?

[03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:02.620]
No

[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:06.320]
So I'll get to you for it now what did our final total show up before?

[03:15:06.980 --> 03:15:07.640]
That was it?

[03:15:07.820 --> 03:15:08.220]
That was it

[03:15:08.220 --> 03:15:10.900]
Well we already had 1040 like that's all we had

[03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:14.460]
Are you sure?

[03:15:14.640 --> 03:15:18.620]
Okay well listen I'm not going to grumble about it I said we want to do a thousand once we got to 1040

[03:15:18.620 --> 03:15:22.180]
That was fine thanks to Joe thanks to the lovely Miguel and thanks for the memories

[03:15:22.180 --> 03:15:26.460]
Anyway we got mad dog coming up next who's going to be whipped up and pissed off and fired off

[03:15:26.460 --> 03:15:27.360]
Bye bye bye

[03:15:32.340 --> 03:15:33.580]
Get in the Hummer in the locker room
