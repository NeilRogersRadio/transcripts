[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680]
Oh

[00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.500]
I'm going there Thursday. I went to the night. I'm an uncle funny. He's in David

[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.660]
I think I could have been the first I think when he just got to the town

[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.580]
I opened the pot. That was really nice. Yeah, so that was Robert Gryper's not here today

[00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.340]
They're little sniveling asshole. He never he never works that why are you right about him, man?

[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.260]
What he's got a personality like a dead man?

[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.680]
Did you your boy? He is a fruit fly. You're going mo I just like Salvador Dali today. Yeah, I saw him on a way out

[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.260]
I said you mo

[00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.100]
Yeah, he looks pretty good

[00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.040]
Yeah, he might have worked in angle. I missed him

[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.100]
He said the rumor is he wants to have a meeting with me in private

[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.760]
But I think what he really said he'd like to squeeze my private. I think that's what I heard

[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.620]
Let me say this to you because you must have been psychic. I heard your crack this morning about my ass or whatever was my ass

[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.760]
Uh, my ass is so sore now that opens up all kinds of avenues for you right there

[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.040]
Now most people of less balls wouldn't say that to a guy like you who could just hop right in there in the opening

[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.800]
But the my ass is because of this irritable bowel. Oh if I didn't have 20 visits yet. Hey, ma. Guess what?

[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.900]
20 visits to the old magic room. We have

[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.360]
I woke up this morning and all the stuff I've had for weeks. It's all gone. So I think when it doubts it out

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.940]
There's nothing worse than a touchy-h. Oh, man. I got a achy

[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.260]
Recto

[00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.980]
Niki breaky

[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:11.320]
Recto

[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.340]
Should be a good game that I kneel. I think all weekend. There's some pretty good games on

[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.200]
I've heard lightning man and the up panthers and you want everyone to stay away from you. How do you think Dudley will do?

[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.920]
He's got to put the dud and Dudley. I that's what I thought but I mean what do you think long term of this?

[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.900]
He's a real asshole if you ask me. I think Alan Cohen really hasn't got any clue what he's doing

[00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.580]
You know anybody who's got some money can buy a sports franchise just like they got in Washington did that doesn't mean they know what the hell are doing

[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.780]
When the frit well if he did such a great job how they come they blew him out and how come after he left all of a sudden

[00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.600]
They got so good if he was doing such a great job

[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.080]
He got maybe he had something there. Look how about you. He will give him credit for that and

[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.840]
They've had your check. Would anybody could have gotten him because he's 80 years old and pretty Modine

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.260]
Which Elise you never got away. You know who the leash you never got rid of was Stevie Sullivan man

[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.880]
Is he a player or what don't you love him?

[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.100]
You know what the problem is in the NHL and that is they got all these size queens like Ryan Murray

[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.020]
Oh, it's too bad Stu Barnes the liberty big enough to be a good player. They don't like the little guys Ray Whitney and Stu Barnes and

[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.280]
All these little players are going rolling right it's Stevie a Sullivan. They're all great players

[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.740]
What's wrong with little guys who are tough and see Palfi right? Yeah, what's wrong with him who now wouldn't want his am?

[00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.220]
You're right about Whitney. There's a lot of little guys that remember Ray Ferrara had a long career

[00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.800]
He's got a hot the wife too by the way Bridget. Didn't you think Ray Ferrara was decent? Yeah, he was good

[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.100]
He played a little great train. What you think of you?

[00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.680]
Do you think Darren paying talks more than me see this is this is conspire. Oh nobody talks more than you

[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.980]
All right, even to these potfans don't talk more than you I'm gonna be watching you at the game

[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.200]
Then I watch it to see if you talk I bet your coach

[00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.960]
And coach Neil what does that mean? You'll be sitting there coaching him from the seat

[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.620]
No, I will not be coaching them. I'll be there watching again. I don't really have a like to eat at the game when the leaves come into town

[00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.840]
That's when I like to be like you know the game. I don't eat any of their crap. It's overpriced. It's garbage

[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.880]
Food in the macaroon. Have you ever bought what course you don't buy it anyway? You get freebies. I get everything given to me

[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.040]
Oh brother the food there is so freaking overpriced

[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.120]
I keep making a portion smaller and the price is higher every year

[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.240]
I think people do you think will have tonight for that game upwards of

[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.760]
4,000, you know, I think it because the lightning are in it

[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.140]
It's about three thousand. I think it's a it's a Tuesday night. Yeah, there be seven people from Tampa right next come over from Loots

[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.040]
Can you imagine try to lynch your ass after the game? I'm dumb

[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.800]
Do you got to be to drive all the way over here for that? I well when when Tampa had the team before we got one

[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.600]
I used to drive over there when the Leafs would play the lightning and just kick their ass

[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.720]
You remember the play you probably wouldn't you weren't done here?

[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.160]
They had a place like in a cow pasture that they made into a hot

[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.760]
I went there to the fire in a season ticket that year when they played at the state fairgrounds. What was that Brandon or Barstow whatever they did?

[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.080]
It smelled like a cow dunk. Yeah, it smelled like the dolphins performance on Sunday like the stench of Commodore

[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.260]
Yeah, but everybody around here. You know, I'm still taking sexual pleasure in that dolphin Tennessee game

[00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.460]
I I can't be getting to tell you how I'm squeezing myself over that game

[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.020]
It was so because you know that if they want oh, and let me also say this you know

[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.800]
Steve McNears not so good. It's just that he's black and the meaty wants to make him seem good because they desperate to have a good black

[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.680]
He can win if he was that's where Rush would tell you that's what Rush would say he'd win if he was purple

[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.060]
I was looking at bread five last night with his broken thumb. I didn't I only watched the first half and I went to bed

[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.220]
The other second half starts at 2 in the morning. Yeah, so it was a final score the Eagles won 17 4G

[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.080]
All right now that's that Randall and I Randall Cunningham got him in the McNambe again. He's black. Yeah, I'm not black

[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.100]
He's not too good because I want to start all

[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.680]
I'm like he won't bring the oxy cotton to him. So he sucks is what he said

[00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.520]
Everybody needs a little

[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.220]
A little restore that's right. Everybody needs a little

[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.780]

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.140]
107 at 560 Wtq. I am happy Tuesday to be up

[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.600]
So I guess for almost if we're gonna bring that check and you can bring me to check at the hockey game tonight

[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.140]
Scott just make it out to abandon pet rescue in fact make it blank off a little bit

[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:37.260]
Abandoned pet rescue got it for real. I see you forgot to remind me to tell him on the cross over this morning

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.920]
But bring it a check I was blinded by Clarence's presence with a check today. Hey clearance actually produced today and a check too

[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.160]
Maybe that's why my ass is so sore

[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.820]
Anywhere we asked asked yesterday which ethnic or racial group they hated this pole again

[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.320]
That's two in a row. I'll try to break that today. Although I got a really great thing

[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.360]
You're gonna take me some time to read. Oh, you're not gonna read stuff on here today

[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.260]
Are yet. Yeah after we take an important call online six I'm not there that we had to be him didn't it?

[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.760]
I thought it would be it had to be him

[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.360]
Who else would be calling me before we even sat down and got my ass warm in the seat my ass is killing me because too many

[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.340]
Em's you see there's a silver lining in the dark cloud mom even though matter how constipated you are at least

[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.220]
You're not gonna have bad roads. No, that's not true. Is it because if you're squeezing real hard

[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.780]
Then it's another reason why you get bad roads

[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.500]
So just don't ever take another B.M. That's my best suggestion everybody out there just explode

[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.080]
1185 votes that was our

[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.140]
Pod yesterday which ethnic or racial group is most protective or paranoid about about its own

[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.440]
Blacks and of course Miriam elephant must add something to do with this one would think

[00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:50.340]
Blacks 571 Miriam OJ anytime, you know black people commit any kind of a grotesque act or our incompetent or whatever or have a job

[00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.000]
Just because of the color of their skin right away. Oh, we got it

[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.980]
You know and the ministers they had how many people showed up for that about five

[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.820]
I was gonna say about 30 but not even close about 11. I thought

[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.040]
Even close corned the papers

[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.140]
Small handful is what showed up for that big meat few rally for all of that is the article in the Sun settle

[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:09.980]
How many is this they showed up? I think it's at 11 a

[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:17.420]
dozen dirty dozen showed up there and that's that speaks well for the black people of our county because what it says is that

[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:22.880]
Unlike the preachers out there of those snake roll salesmen most of the black folks in brown come to realize that

[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.940]
She isn't competent and if you want to win like an elections and have any chance to be pushed next year

[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.840]
Maybe let's get somebody in there who can count higher than her shoe size

[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:34.300]
You're done Miriam. Bye-bye sweetie. Good luck to you

[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:39.220]
Black's 571 Jews 329 votes use brave paranoid

[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.380]
Cubans 228 which should have been higher I would think

[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:48.280]
Muslim is 46 and of course who knows any Muslims and Italians 11 out of 1186

[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.960]
We're gonna put on the other groups too, but Eric was busy eating

[00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:55.180]
Well plus I didn't have you call him yesterday. I

[00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.940]
Can call today. I don't know. I don't want you to call. I don't want you to come

[00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.700]
He should be listening. He should be glued right to this show. I don't care what other business

[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.760]
He's got going on 10 to 2. That's where it's at

[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.440]
Right, he can handle it for a few days when we're little short-handed here

[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.740]
Here's our poll question today

[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.400]
sexually who are the hottest people in the world and I got a short list here. I got my favorite on top Colombians

[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:19.640]
Oh

[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:26.220]
Anyway, I get weak at the knees just thinking about Colombians man. Just amazing with that smooth silky skin

[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.520]
Irish although I always thought that Irish were pasty, but there's some people I know who aren't

[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:35.720]
Just aren't into that yet. Italians and Americans. We got Americans on there and of course

[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:42.120]
We probably need a category for some people out there. How would I know? I'm well, we'll get to that. We'll expand it in the poll too

[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:49.600]
FCC releases indecency enforcement against opian Anthony is a for all know about this yet. Yes, that's old news actually

[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.100]

Yeah, pali had this on like two weeks ago, right? What the hell is with you fat boy? You tub a crap

Jesus Christ you and Rick Jenner read at least he's got some talent anyway. What's your story?

[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.740]
Tubby just sucking around say here you go, pali see this

[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:20.820]
Yeah, and President Lincoln died to see if he brings your story that's old enough being this feeble and old design

[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.960]
You forget that we headed on the air already. So I was like giving him credit. Oh, thanks a lot fat boy

[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.060]
Now we you're asked out of here at hobble out and by the way the buildings on fire

[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.480]
Oh brother, it's all it's almost enough to make you wish that the building would burn down

[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.140]
You know what him being on here. I purposely don't ask him for a bed because by the time I get I'll probably need to

But thanks for the information about Todd wreck. I don't kill this day

[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.560]
I never knew that that he has his own agency and as a result

[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.100]
That's why we have no copy for his accounts and it's all bogus

[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.820]
It's all bogus. He's running his own agency just like Pete Lenny. He's running a business out of this business

[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.960]
Wow, yeah, how do you like that? That's he's another scam artist Todd wreck

That's why his clients never get service because he doesn't give a crap

[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.320]
He just writes a bunch of stuff on a piece of paper. Here you go. That's it

[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.620]
You know all the way haven't seen him because he hasn't given a dime to abandon pair rescue

Speaking of dollar mattress and of course, so for L is Jones and why does he want a dollar mattress because he knows

[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.180]
In fact, Boca Brown was here earlier. They came to his house like three different times

[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.960]
Three different times no extra charge because he was having a little trouble getting head

[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.040]
Well, he's got that little bald head

[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:52.260]
He was traveling trouble getting his head against the headboard or something ahead to be like adjusted and being picky and a pain in the ass

I'm a liar

[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:56.300]
I'm a liar

[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:57.040]
Are you done?

[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:57.940]
Oh, thank you

[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:03.200]
Speaking of a book of brands. So he tried to send me a couple of weeks ago. I one of his discs up in Toronto FedEx

[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.320]
And it was a little bit of a problem

[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:09.740]
He went to FedEx and I said oh we can't do that because he's been using the station account

[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.440]
Of course, which natural they should pay. It's part of the operating expense of doing business

[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.300]
Oh, we can't do that that comes been closed

[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:17.540]
What?

[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.560]
Because beastlies didn't pay the FedEx account. They cancel the account. They closed it

[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:26.880]
No, seriously, that's the nature of this company people think I'm making these things up

[00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.700]
That's a true story my hand to the sky

[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:32.800]
They closed our FedEx account and that's why you had to pay out of his own poor pocket

[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.220]
Little baldy there had a dig in their deep had to borrow the money from rumor

[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.480]
And I should give you a real good clue as to what this place is all about. They're raking it on the one side

[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:46.320]
But they don't want to send it out so fast on the other side except of course when it comes to me

[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.660]
Which I do thank them for that second paycheck for the same peer-prepared with anybody else

[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.860]
Anybody of less candor than me that they said oh thanks a lot Duff and shoved it right deep into their pocket

[00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:59.260]
They to put their hand deep in their pants and squeeze a little bit because when you get an extra paycheck

[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:02.420]
That you're not supposed to be getting. Don't you think most people would have just pocketed that?

[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.300]
And then try to see if well, maybe they'll catch it down the road, but maybe they won't

[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.660]
Maybe they're so dumb they won't catch it

[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.520]
Huh? I think most people would have been dishonest

[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.240]
If your boss anybody out there your boss gave you a second paycheck that you didn't have coming for the same period

[00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.600]
You already got paid for wouldn't you have taken it?

[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.660]
Stuffed in your pocket and got out and spending before they could ask for it back. You better sweet ass you would have

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:26.680]
Speaking to ass

[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:31.120]
Oh, yeah, Larry Flynn. I saw that this morning. The only difference being

[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:34.000]
Larry Flynn brought the purported nude photos of Jessica Lynch

[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.460]
But he says the reason that he bought him was that so never nobody would publish them

[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:39.680]
Yeah, he bought him up

[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.640]
They're not gonna put him in hustler. That's what he says Larry flit

[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.300]
He said we were gonna put him in a

[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:50.760]
Little paper as what he said he was snorting when he said it. Well, he's having a little tough time these days

[00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:54.160]
Why are you giving me a look like that? Aren't there other copies somewhere?

[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.960]
I don't know. He says he purchased them in order to keep them out of circulation not to publish them

[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.160]
Flint no friend of the Bush administration

[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.140]
Republicans said the president is using Lynch to justify the war in Iraq and he has usual is

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.580]
Absolutely correct sir. I say let's have Larry Flynn for president

[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:14.980]
We already had the FDR and we'll cheer why not right? We have one really great president got elected four freaking times

[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:17.160]
They might even undo that constitutional amendment

[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.240]
Let them stay in their hell at least to provide porn for everybody and then maybe he'll show us them pictures

[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.540]
All the who wants to see Jessica? Oh, I don't

[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:27.780]
She's got smaller hooters than what's your name under than uh solely dad

[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.680]
She's got like raisinets

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.980]
Soly dad a Brian is the anti-Christ make no mistake about that on a certainly not news network

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.320]
Here's Martin and Miami in regard to our pulses Argentinian women are on fire. They're flaming

[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.320]
That's what the martin says. You ought to know see so we'll get Argentinians on there

[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.420]
I'll facsia and I see Eric takes everything serious. I was just joking about that and right away he calls up Scott

[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.740]
Oh

[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:54.700]
I got work to do up here

[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.620]
I can't listen every middle of the show all four hours. You have to fact just relax Eric. Okay, well

[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.320]
I'll sit here. I'll make a list

[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.100]
I got Argentinians on air will make a little list here during the breaks

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:07.860]
I'll facs you additions on air just calm down put down your breakfast burritos and your lunch

[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:12.400]
Which you have on the other side and just calm down a little bit tone it down a few notches you asshole

[00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:17.640]
You fat tub of bull crap you okay? And by the way on the weekends will be nice to get the new bedtime stories under before like

[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.400]
340 afternoon

[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.120]
I mean you're doing a great job, but I just just a little word to suggestion

[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.300]
It would be nice to get the bedtime stories on around the weekend before like five six in the evening when everybody's going to bed

[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:32.820]
Since I facs them since I email them the Eric like in the wee hours and usually the night before he has them all by early in the morning

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.420]
But he's busy eating late into the night on the weekends has a lot of indigestion and once in a great while his

[00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:42.540]
Japanese his lovely wife allows him to service or I understand to the grapevine once in a great while

[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:46.480]
And if you saw what he looked like and how big he is you'd understand yourself is he a large man?

[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.660]
He's a gigantic. He's a giant in the internet industry. Make no mistake about it

[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.960]
So we don't want to bother Eric because we know you're very busy now with your breakfastes

[00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.040]
Well, I got a great article here this George Soros come on. Thank you whoever fax this to me because I didn't see it

[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.380]
Want to thank them profusely and usually we're bitching out people who send us like six page articles

[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.760]
I'm gonna read it about George Soros and a little bit

[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.360]
Oh, earth cups and it's dead. You know who heard over a cup and it was

[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:15.580]
No, you wouldn't because you know from Chicago

[00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.800]
Herb cups and very famous as Chicago comments who had cups calm in the Chicago sometimes

[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.620]
He also had a TV show in Chicago. He was a very famous kind of guy

[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:29.360]
Big celebrity in the Midwest especially in the Chicago area and for many years he competed with Walter

[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.840]
Windschild and maybe with Miss Drudge

[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.380]
Miss Drudge how you doing? Miss Drudge your little fagged your little flavor

[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.860]
She's probably putting on trying on some of Anne's clothing right now

[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.440]
See one thing if Anne and the Miss Drudge moving together they can wear the same wardrobe

[00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:45.360]
Oh, yeah, she wear the pants in that family. I'll guarantee you that right now

[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:50.380]
Miss Drudge he tried to send him little skirts, you know some little outfits probably brown panties to him as fudge

[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:51.700]
She's packing it

[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.540]
Here Anne's packing a big one. So anyway, earth cups and it's dead at 91

[00:19:56.540 --> 00:20:00.180]
91 is old enough when you say when most of us like to make it to 91

[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.840]
I'm hoping to make it to 61. Yeah, well

[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:10.020]
I did honey like that and look at me. Few rally for all of it. Let's hear that good news like I said before

[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:14.320]
That's really good news that the Schwarzenegger's out there aren't getting sucked in by these preachers out there

[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:19.020]
See one thing which most of you I'm sure are aware of is that most people in the black community

[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:24.400]
Don't you love those terms the black community most black folks in america who can't get like an honest job they become preachers

[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:32.360]
Right having you ever noticed that how many black churches there are Haitian churches and Jamaican churches and black churches

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.400]
Every three corners like at least a dozen

[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.940]
And that's because you've got to have a place for the preachers the self-appointed preachers to go

[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.320]
Here's Reverend Jackson and here's Reverend Al Sharpton

[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.600]
See one thing about Al Sharpton. I hate to say this, but it's the honest show

[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.700]
I hate to say it but out of all the

[00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.320]
Feel like democratic contenders

[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.940]
Al Sharpton is by far and away and don't get me wrong

[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:57.460]
I wouldn't vote for it well. I would vote for him. I vote for anybody against bush

[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.880]
But in the primary I wouldn't vote for him because he's a evil person and a racist

[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.260]
But he's by far in a way the most forceful speaker. He's got the best sense of humor

[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:10.660]
He puts everybody else in her place. I mean Sharpton runs circles around the other ones

[00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.840]
I saw a lot of them up in New York

[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.400]
A lot of what a lot of Al Sharpton

[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.320]
I just saw a lot of Al Sharpton's in New York. Are you making another racist comment?

[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.220]
Picking a page out of your buddy for all the songbook. Nice going Scott. You're fired

[00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.520]
Few rally for elephant

[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.780]
Task force expects to have ready a report ready for bush this week. That's Jeb bush. We got to keep our bushes straight

[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:39.640]
Broward County election supervisor Miriam elephant rallyed in private Monday. Look at that Irish have only two votes

[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.520]
On our poll those pasty Irishman

[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.700]
Generally speaking Irish people are not attractive. Of course there's some people

[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.560]
I know who aren't into attractive people which is good good for me

[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:53.800]
But they're not really as good, but Irish pasty Irishman with a bad complexion in those

[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.760]
What do you call those things in the like freckles?

[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.960]
Not just freckles. You know I'm talking about yeah deep red cheeks. Yeah, geez

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.920]
Like Prince Harry and you oh man. Are you grotesque anyway?

[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.420]
Broward County election supervisor Miriam elephant rallyed in

[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.320]
Private Monday with a handful of supported a small handful about a dozen

[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:17.640]
Although black ministers urged and see people think I'm making that up if they don't read the newspaper

[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.520]
Which most people don't and I don't blame them down here

[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.980]
Although black ministers urged their congregations over the weekend to turn out by the hundreds to stand behind the emphatiled

[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.580]
Miriam elephant

[00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.880]
Doesn't show it up at the government center. Oh yeah. We watch an email the governor

[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.600]
We want hundreds of people to show up. Uh, did it happen? No. Is it ever gonna have no? No, okay? They're on to work

[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.860]
Okay, and they're on to all you phony preachers to try to make a racial issue out of this

[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.260]
Which it isn't a racial issue

[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.280]
See here's another reason why there's so much racial hatred in this country is that people take somebody who's totally incompetent or somebody who's clearly a

[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.640]
Pieces crap like OJ and then they try to make it into a racial thing

[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:55.620]
And like the caller said on Friday, we had a very good point when you try to defend somebody when you hire a black person

[00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:58.860]
And they're incompetent and then you have all kinds of a source when you try to get rhythm

[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:05.240]
Other people aren't gonna be so anxious to hire a black person if they got equally qualified black and white people for the same job

[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.780]
They're gonna hire the white person because the white person's never gonna be able to say oh you can't fire me. I'm white

[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:13.780]
Nobody ever said you can't fire me because I'm white

[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.140]
But the other person like Miriam for example

[00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.300]
Oh, you can't fire me because I'm black and we'll get the NAVP and the all these others and the

[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:23.720]
Preachers and the organization and all of a sudden the crap will bring back Peter Royal

[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.120]
And we'll make a big stink about it and beat the crap out everybody if they don't go along with us

[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.000]
Yeah, we'll get big number eight to beat up on everybody

[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.800]
That's what we need is number eight back on the panthers. What do you say? No?

[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.040]
not

[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:34.760]
not

[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.500]
See that was a good move that they made Alan Cohen you know nothing about hockey. I'm embarrassed for the organization

[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.980]
That a guy like Mike Keenan who's got you know, Stanley Cup in New York to his credit

[00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.860]
Which almost nobody else in the history mankind at least in modern history's got can say that almost have one same loose

[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.620]
That's right. Daniel head one in San Lewis

[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.960]
Mike Keenan he's been around gets candle out of places just like your buddy for well

[00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:01.140]
He gets candid as me doesn't have any talent. He's just a hard ass. That's all he's difficult to handle

[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.680]
And the Panther organization being the Alan Cohen who knows nothing. How's Bernie Kossard doing by the way?

[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:07.840]
Seeing him lately

[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:13.340]
Oh silly you should have been here the day that they made the breathless announcement about buying the team and Bernie comes in here

[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:17.420]
And he opened the door. He was giggling like a little girl. Wasn't Bernie Kossard quarterback?

[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.780]
For yeah for the Browns and the dolphins. Yes. So what does that have to do with hockey?

[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:22.980]
Nothing but he's got a big nose

[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.600]
Axe and I saw my opponent

[00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.460]
Morton and his New York City bosses run over a monkey

[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:45.020]
My opponent Mary Ellen fish box has her period three out of four weeks a month

[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:48.760]
My opponent Morton got fired from the mall

[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.220]
For sexually harassing a mannequin

[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.500]
Well my opponent Mary Ellen fish box

[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.680]
Each leftover fruit from box glasses

[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.320]
Oh

[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.940]
My opponent Morton

[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.520]
Is it better?

[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.760]
My opponent Mary Ellen fish box never offered a reach around

[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:11.420]
Morton Morton is sterile

[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.640]
Your fridgey bitch

[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.760]
You can get laid in credits marriage if your spores was a cure for AIDS

[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.880]
By your alesbo

[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:25.420]
You're a piece of crap

[00:25:25.420 --> 00:25:27.920]
You're a no good skink

[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.640]
My dick's bigger

[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.600]

Eventually I know this Eric already got Argentinians on there nice going Eric. He must be in between feedings

[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.140]
sexually or the hottest people on the world in the world Americans 21

[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:51.220]
Well, it's probably because many of you have limited experience

[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:52.600]
Yeah, I should have figured that in the beginning

[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.460]
Because Americans tend to be very parochial people

[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.520]
Although we have all these other invaders here

[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.240]
That doesn't mean you have to do some of these other people on their turf

[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.220]
See what I'm saying

[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.400]
Like I never been to Columbia

[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.320]
But I have been well

[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:12.040]
Columbia in 16 Italians 14 Irish six and that's those pasty Irish and Argentinians four

[00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:16.780]

[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.460]
Russians Russian women especially really well

[00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:22.300]
Ha ha ha

[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:26.200]
Russian I would say Columbia and man especially I mean yeah, that just makes sense

[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:30.360]
You're gonna say Russian because I'm assuming you never had sex with a Russian guy not even Pavel Buray

[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.880]
Not lately or Sergei Fedorov who's she bearded for now? Oh, that's right. It's Enrique

[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.600]
That Anna Cornelhoid is not isn't that the new deal? Yeah last year was Lexi Yashin

[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:45.260]
Now have you ever noticed how she tends to be a beard for every closet? I mean, I love you Enrique

[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.960]
But let's face it man you ain't fooling nobody sweetheart and he already told me it's really really teeny and tiny

[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:57.800]
He is even the guys have to admit it's not not in public but behind closed doors that he is just hot super super hot

[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.280]
He's flaming

Here's a fact from that Denver fan again. Just don't get carried away. We kicked your ass last week

[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:07.880]
There's nothing better than a honey glazed Brazilian woman. Oh, yeah, but can you be sure that's really a woman?

[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:14.220]
That's the question brazil uh-huh, huh? Yeah, Russians and Brazilians Eric put them on there and don't play hard to get okay

[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.600]
I mean I can fact you to them, but what's the point he's listening

Let me say it again. Let me interrupt your hard work that you're doing Russians and Brazilians Eric you got it

[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.140]
Good get it Russians and frickin Brazilians the women

[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.460]
Well, we're not we're not specifying because we're assuming that since our audience is predominantly male

[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.040]
They're talking about man. I mean women

[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.460]
In this crowd who now knows they wanted to see endless summer over and over again

[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:44.340]
Endless loop they want to see that surfing flick with Bruce Brown any guy whose name is Bruce be very very worry

[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.480]

It says they're hormonal imbalance also makes nice a treat in the L sacco the Brazilian women

[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:56.060]
Trust me get one of those Brazilian honey's in the sac you'll find out the meaning of

[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.700]
Mui caliente in your case

[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.760]
I guess you need to think of a Brazilian guy with the masculine I can read the last line on here

[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.560]
See it's like that which is probably just as good probably the masculine sauce on is no something knows

[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:13.340]

[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.740]
A Titans are not the best when it comes to hygiene

[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.700]
Norton like in Milan. Of course, Milan is more like a new York. Milan is like more industrial

[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:14.880]
It's a lot not even like Italy. It's more like northern Europe

[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.360]
But the rest of Italy from South of Milan, oh man. It's a little on the game you said

I love the way these stories print out now see now they all when you when you click on them

[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.280]
They all have like the neo-roggers logo on top when you put them up

[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:42.100]
You can go to the origin link for to find out from what's it came

[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:45.380]
But it's a beautiful thing and eric did that all by himself. Isn't that great?

[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.740]
He's doing his job. He's doing it

[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.700]
By the way, if you got right he's got them on there already Russians and Brazilians

[00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.400]
He just caused a bitch. That's all he just is a bitch

[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:16.900]
Spoke John Paul the tooth yesterday denounced as morally contradictory and I bet you what's his name's pretty pissed off about a two

Don't don't tell me you're not eating any of it. You're a pig. You had like a sandwich in each hand and a strawberry milkshake

[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.280]
You were sucking the straw on the table

[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:51.760]
He was bending over and of course Terrence came in and had his eyes are rolling around like a pinball machine when he saw you hunched over like that

[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.640]
Look to me like he was I and your back dome ass

[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.740]
But in any way now see you're not listening to me now. He's pat pat pat would say he would no one listen

[00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.080]
You just it's a waste of time it's a waste of effort

[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:04.900]
You're gonna wind up just like Josh for you. They're gonna be stapling your stomach

[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:10.000]
You wind up like the beast who's already hit the beast is how will like about 26 28 something like that? How old is he?

[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.100]
About 30. No, seriously. He's liking his uh

[00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.080]
3rd man

[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.560]
Yeah, he's still running while I can overgrown trail that you and by the way nice game there beast

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.400]
But in any rate uh, he's already had like every goddamn procedure and you're gonna wind up with the same thing

[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:26.640]
He's not listening to a word that I'm saying he just wants to eat just shovel it in there

[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.400]
It's the Jewish way man. Just keep shoveling the food in there

[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:34.760]
Probably his parents keep force feeding and they sit in the corner and I they just oh here eat SS

[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.780]
It's good for you. Yes. Yeah

[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:40.240]
All that fatty stuff all those blinces man

[00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:45.960]
Mozza balls nothing but pure carbohydrates. Oh, by the way. I got a great new sponsor coming on

[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.580]
I am so ecstatic about these people

[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:52.080]
It's called inter-ex diabetic stuff. It's a drink

[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.560]
And doesn't have nearly as many carbs as uh slim fast some of those and it actually tastes good people nice guys

[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.760]
They were in here this morning and I drank a couple of those probably shouldn't have had a couple, but they're so damn good

[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:08.240]
But anyway, we'll be telling you about that as soon as they start paying for it in a speech to scientists

[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:14.080]
Yes, they have hopes that research in the stem cell technology has understandably grown and important in recent years because of the

[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.780]
Hope it offers and the cure of ill-saffecting many peoples

[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.940]
John Paul suffers from Parkinson's disease one of the ailments that might benefit from stem cell

[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.400]
However, he reiterated the Vatican position to show what a moron he is that stem cells for purposes of experimentation of treatment

[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.640]
Cannot come from human embryo tissue

[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:33.760]
Oh god loves those embryos baby

[00:34:34.740 --> 00:34:39.460]
Vatican teaching holds that life begins a conception not contraception God forbid a conception

[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.920]
Any treatment which claims to save human lives yet is based on human life in its embryotic state is logically and morally

[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.960]
Contradictuaries is any production of human embryos for the director indirect purpose of experimentation or eventual destruction

[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.400]
The pope told participants in a stone age meaning organized by the pontifical Academy of Sciences and advisory body in the

[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.640]
And the immediate continues going on about the holy father said this and the holy father and you idiots out there

[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:07.480]
You crazy people with your rosary beads and your virgin Mary's in your crucifixes and your wolf bane. What is wrong with you?

[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.900]
Man, oh man, oh man

[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.640]
If you could just set your brains free what a great place the world would be

[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:20.160]
And that a great saying what a great place the world would be if people could set their brains free and be more like me

[00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.660]
And the and go take a good pee

[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:28.200]
God what is wrong with this world, huh? So simple. There's nothing complicated about it. It's simple

[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:32.660]
And poor Christopher Reevaugh there was pissed off at the bush people now

[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.800]
He's probably really pissed off at the freaking pope too because the guy I know it. It's really asking a lot

[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:40.300]
But he'd like to walk in his lifetime. It'll be nice if somebody hundred years from now can do it

[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.120]
But he'd like to be able to do it himself in the pope still walk

[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.080]
Yeah excellent point

[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.480]
Stem cells baby sent him to the Vatican right now

[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:59.740]
I got the guy's neck

[00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:14.820]
My army has the marlins world champion based wealthy not long before the series no fans were ever seen

[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:20.880]
Now that their chance they have the fans surrounding them like rats who went the celebrating tour

[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.500]
One refunds for their husband's they're just

[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.160]
front running for me

[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:27.180]
front running for me

[00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.680]
Here's your dance of boredom just they won

[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:33.000]
Yeah, they're just front running for me

[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.020]
front running for me

[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.700]
Don't give a crap about the one

[00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:42.480]
Miami brad sound peeking about a mile square

[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.480]
Let all around the boring

[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.540]
No one really cares

[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.500]
Four holes that take an interest in supporting their own team will call up

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.840]
For radio to get their tickets

[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:56.600]
Because they're just front running for me

[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.060]
Oh

[00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.440]
Short on support unless they want

[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:04.300]
Now

[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:05.760]
Hello

[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:07.880]
We go home now

[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:14.440]
You never know with him I thought maybe there might be a little something there a takedon on the end

[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:20.580]
It's 1047 at 560 wqm the highly rated the highly touted gym editor from sureless day two today

[00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:24.060]
The Humberhank Goldberg at for this afternoon for three solid hours

[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:28.320]
Haven't seen Hank in months and months and months you think he's gonna come in early to say say hi

[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.780]
Give me a big low five

[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:35.380]
Rob Conrad our at five to six. So Hank really only has a two-hour show

[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:43.380]
You know give me and then you got panther preview at seven of panthers and they lightweight to seven light near for real

[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:46.400]
Maybe they got the most wins in the conference. I believe eight Michael right?

[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.840]
They haven't lost one game they lost one game. They played only 12 games and they're like eight one two and one

[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.440]
I believe let's see the nine well. Yeah

[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.380]
And they're like they're on fire. They're for real. They're a hell of a team

[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:01.280]
Yeah, they got real good real fast. Yeah

[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:06.120]
What happened here? They got real bad real fast and they stayed real bad real fast

[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.760]
They keep getting worse real fast real fast and Tampa Bay will make the playoffs this year

[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:13.220]
In fact, it looks like probably they're gonna win the division them in Atlanta one two

[00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.420]
I think the panther is gonna make the point. No, the panthers will not make the playoffs

[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:17.860]
I hate to break the news to you just like that thing

[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:21.000]
I just got through a planer that poke a brine but you see you have to be a realist

[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.280]
I like the panthers. I love hockey but the fact of the matter is Alan Cohen hasn't got any idea what he's doing in the first clue

[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.520]
Should have been when they said oh well, we're gonna keep Bill Torion because we like the way he wears them bow ties

[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:32.680]
We don't know nothing about it. He's the expert

[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.900]
Well as soon as they said that we knew they were full of crap

[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:39.380]
Because Bill Tor is expert he's kind of vanished once he left the honors about a hundred years ago

[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.260]
Long ancient past silly man playing too much comedy with them young girls. So at any rate

[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.940]
And that was the end of that and from there on we went downhill

[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.800]
Not that we want Pavel Burier Ray Windier Scott Melumbier Mike Solan Durant those guys because they were like too good

[00:38:55.260 --> 00:39:02.200]
You know what's all the calls we had yesterday on this is supposed to be the hockey maven here all the calls we had about my keening getting fired the big oh

[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.000]
none zero

[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:08.560]
Anyway, we got the game tonight for if you can't go you should be going lightning in the panthers 7 30 at the macarena

[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.240]
I really entertaining team the lightning

[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.560]
They're fast they're young they can stick the biscuit in the basket

[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.800]
They got Nikolai hobby bull and that John now. What's his name Graham is pretty damn good too?

[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.840]
He played unbelievable the other night in

[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.800]
against Carolina and at one one time he was phenomenal and

[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:28.740]
You got Eddie K after the hockey game and Joe and Mark in the dark two to five overnight who hate mole like poisoned

[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.020]
But they're too afraid to say it

[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:37.700]
Here's the facts from Marty who says I'll tell you what Saudi Arabian women are animals once you take off all that towel that they're mummified in

[00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:44.080]
Just say mummy mummy. They're so sexually deprived and they pray that when you get them they can be furious

[00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:45.340]
Furious

[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.920]
I think if you can get past the stench you'll have a nice time with them

[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:52.140]
You think Italian women don't shape it says now that we bombed all of their men

[00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.180]
They'll be heading our way. They'll be really extra horny. I guess

[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:59.320]
Says Marty Saudi Arabians. Let's get that on there. Okay. That's what Osama Yamama says

[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:04.300]
By the way, aren't you glad we're wasting 87 billion in Iraq with this war and killing all these people including all these American kids

[00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.580]
Big instead of fighting terrorism with all of that money

[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.220]
Because now all this crap ensued Dan and Saudi Arabian all over the world and of course here

[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.860]
We'll probably have some more crap again no doubt

[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:17.720]
And we're just not doing it if we got Osama yet and Sodom Hussein and

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.540]
Mula Pula Omar and all these other going on now we don't

[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.820]
But we sure talk a good game here's while I was away a

[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.140]
Birthday card from Rita

[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.820]
formerly of green acres

[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.420]
Las Vegas and now visiting on a bench in Del Rey

[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:37.440]
You're now sitting on a bench in Del Rey. She's here. Thank you Rita. You're the one. She's it plus the van lady left mine in my mailbox. That was it

[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.260]
I've been on the year a zillion years in this market a

[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:42.800]
million years

[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.660]
The two birthday cards in the audience

[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:52.060]
Does that tell you a lot about this time? I mean usually every year. It's like you know a nine eleven a dozen fifteen

[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:58.660]
What's something like that two count them? There's no well wishes on the air. Well, what what does that mean? Anybody who's calling?

[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.700]
I mean, that's for free

[00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:01.820]
Well wishes my ass

[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:07.520]
Oh, I don't wait. Oh, and here's another one. I take that back because I forgot about my buddy Pete from Michigan State. Thank you Pete

[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:14.380]
Pete runs a place called khakis. It's a Spartan-owned restaurant in Boka and by the way if Moe comes in there

[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:20.200]
Kick his ass out Pete if Moe comes in there looking for a freebie snoring around kick his disgusting slimy old ass up

[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.180]
The room around a building is and it's not just a rumor

[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:28.620]
He came and dressed up like a clown or something this morning and what was that all about yellow shoes big red nose backwards hat

[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:32.560]
Yeah, beard and what does that mean? I don't know

[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:40.560]
Was that his disguise maybe he put I still think he put his hairpiece on his chin. I don't think he has a mean chinball at Moe

[00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:43.280]
I don't think it was under the hat today

[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.080]
He wasn't wearing a hairpiece. Oh god, I missed that. I had a given anything to see that two days in a row

[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.520]
I miss my close personal buddy Moe

[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.640]
Man because one thing about him the Moe I see him the more absolutely despise him

[00:41:55.640 --> 00:42:01.880]
You know absolutely right anyway. Here's the happy 60th birthday plus it was 61 Pete get it right from the S.S.A.

[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:05.660]
Alumni of South Florida. Hope you like the shirt. I love the shirt if you don't say stick it up your ass

[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:11.800]
Kanky's a Spartan-owned restaurant in Boka asked for Pete go up there and say hi to Pete tell my nice and you buy he'll charge you double

[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.180]
And it's a beautiful thing. Look at that. Let me see Spartans got their ass kicked by Ohio State on Saturday

[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:21.220]
We don't care. It's all right. Everybody on campus is still getting laid four or five times a day

[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.220]
No problem. They're drinking at my stir brother

[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:28.900]
Nobody can drink like the Spartans. I'll tell you that right freaking now. That's pretty swell and so is the shirt

[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:34.380]
Yeah, it's swelling right now. I'm just thinking about it. Hey, I went to a couple of classes in two years maybe two or three

[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:37.680]
And they said oh, please don't come back and I said all right

[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:45.480]

[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.960]
Because with the Brazilians seriously from what I read and here and seen

[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.680]
You can't really be sure what you got to hold up

[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.900]
Kind of like Eddie Murphy and what's his name all over again? Yeah, that's why they invented that wax you grant

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:29.080]

Thanks to my good close friends the rimmers. I was like all set up to be doctrine again

[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:43.240]
I don't want to go run into doctors every time I'm here

[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.260]
But I've had this irritable bowel for like weeks and weeks and weeks. Oh man

[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.660]
And then I had that wonderful experience yesterday. I mean

[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:52.100]

[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:08.880]
I'm very I guess the voters didn't care that I made all those big mouthful cheese and sco-real

[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.960]
Ha ha ha ha ha

[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:16.480]
Well, if you're honest with your public and you tell them you have a final story

[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.100]
Trust me

[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:24.520]
They'll forgive you like it did me and elect you to the GOP

[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.300]
Is a key change in the song

[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.640]
Who's the man's a little fat man supamario brother never had a prayer

[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.540]

[00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:42.560]
Oh, it was in the tiny holes

[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:47.920]
I'm the victor I'm the winner and my hard-wired music cannot be

[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:55.820]
Ha ha ha and now I'm done to grow up on native of the California G-O-D

[00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:02.340]
I'm embarrassing a level 0 2 at 560 here's the facts that says verifying what I told you

[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:07.400]
See all these homophobes in lunatics and right wing bush lickers out there calling in they're just jealous too bad

[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:10.840]
And also really upset over the fact that I'm feeling so good today man

[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.700]
I feel like I just though was reborn too bad sounds like another 20 years of me on a year ripping your ass

[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.980]
Facts as I'm a little Jewish guy who happens to marry to a Colombian girl

[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:20.600]
Oy

[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:26.640]
And yes, you're right Colombians are the hottest I think so together. We just produced a bouncing baby, Jolombian

[00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.460]
It says ps check your spelling on a website. It's Colombian with an oh as in oh

[00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.240]
As in as opposed to you. That's okay. Eris busy. He's got a lot of other work to do

[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.820]
He can't be bothered worried about spell checking and stuff like that

[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:45.600]
So we're doing the best we can and in spite of his bad spelling presidians and Colombians are tied numero uno

[00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:51.480]
39 of peace merkins 31 see I mean americans is like you know generic that could be like people from Indiana

Hey, there's something wrong and there's a oh, I can't handle it. I'm leaving. I have to go to the doctor now

[00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:09.600]

[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:51.540]
I think it's only so we got everything fixed we got line one working again for the first time in months

[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.600]
We got the office phone in here working because we got a wheel engineer who cares

[00:49:55.600 --> 00:50:00.240]
Sends is very best as opposed to a bunch of excuse making goofballs who never show up all the time

[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:03.020]
Oh, well George got a bad leg and he's out of crutch. Yeah

What I was you calling my office phone now. How do I get rid of it?

[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:19.940]

Fix it. I like things better when they're broke. They don't make all that noise

[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:32.980]
Anyway, but resins 39 Columbians are 33 Americans 31 Italians 30 if they don't if they shower once in a great while

[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.740]
Maybe a little bath

[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:39.040]
Maybe like a sponge bath would be good Argentinians 15 the Irish have got 12

Freedom people

[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:53.540]
Well, we can't say the French no more. That's another example of a silly kind of mindless things that Americans do the dumb ones

[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:58.120]
You know, oh well the president says the French and the Germans are our enemies now. So let's call them freedom fries

[00:50:58.120 --> 00:51:01.880]
Oh, okay makes sense to me. Oh, yeah, sounds good roofage

[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.820]
Make me have the back to then freedom fries and hold the mail

[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:07.500]
It's it's a scary thing

[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:13.780]
But when you take take a look at the map everybody in the audience go get a map go on the internet and find a map of the U.S

[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:22.580]
And take a look at the states like look at Wyoming and Idaho and the Dakotas in Montana and Arizona and the Nebraska

[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:30.760]
And Indiana and Kentucky and Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Texas and Oklahoma and the Carolinas and Georgia

[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.380]
and Virginia

[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.200]
And you start saying to yourself this is a mugwump country

[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.220]
Yeah, a lot of mugwumps running around out there and loose

[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:45.340]
And then look at like it outside of South Florida. Look at the right while just look at this but look at the rest of Florida. There's two egg

[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:48.920]

In most of the rest outside of Dave Brown and Palm Beach there's a whole bunch of trailer park

[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:16.100]
It's true. I'm gonna read this whole article when I get time back to the break about George Soros. This is good news

[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.300]
Just to give you little tease missle get the right wingers all been out of shape

[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:24.160]

Democracy in the former Soviet block African-Asian now. He has a new project defeating George Bush

[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.180]
I saw George baby. I wish I would listen to him

[00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.860]
He was one of the first people who said back during the dot com crash

[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.420]
In the months before it happened he said all of this stuff most of these companies are going to go out of business in a few months

[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.800]
Most of this is a paper tiger. It's all built on a deck of cards. It's gonna come crashing down

[00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:50.540]
And I you know, I wish I would listen to him instead of

[00:52:50.540 --> 00:52:52.200]
You know what I'm saying

[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.400]
I wish I would listen to a bigger pardon I can 87 one of the other stocks crash

Primary practice with people with hearing loss right close me up

[00:54:19.440 --> 00:54:24.540]
Yes, that he says you wouldn't believe it. He goes I just had some for this and a priest come into see me today

[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.200]
So they take his medical history the guys on every hand side depressant under the sun

[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:32.600]
But when I asked him what your chief complaint

[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.600]
Refused hearing loss

[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.720]
God honest quote from the guy God honest

[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.560]
I can't hear the little boys

[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:46.320]
What does that mean? That's what my brother couldn't figure out

[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.780]
Even said to the priest what's what's your biggest problem as far as hearing goes because I can't hear the little boys

[00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:54.260]
There's no fact in the church

[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.700]
Okay, well thanks. Well, well, well, we'll ponder that for a little while

[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:02.160]
He's a I guess when the door opens. He just can't hear them coming squirt squirt what it means

[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.060]
All the probably in their case. They're too a little to be doing that yet anyway

[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.300]
5 6 7 0 5 60 you figure that out. You have any idea

[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:12.800]
I think we got a bunch of perverts on the phone here today if he asked me what show was that we were listening to

[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.920]
Residians 44 Columbians 38 Americans 34 Tatians 30 about 30 and that's it

[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.660]
After that it's small potatoes

[00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:27.800]
I'll grab these faxes man important. I see here's another chronic chronic chronic faxer

[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.240]
Just unbelievable

[00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:33.880]
Venice Waylands. Oh, let's get Venice Waylands on air the Latino people, huh

[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:34.960]

Venice Waylands especially the women are the most beautiful

[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.720]
Supple creatures on it just look at the number of misuniverse titles they own by the way

Did you find a curious that the US evacuated its people before the so-called al-Qaeda tech and Saudi Arabia that caught my little yeah

[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:50.960]
We had that article on the website just Saturday morning and then of course it happened later in Saturday

[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.380]
We had it on there just hours before it happened

[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:55.420]
So they were tipped off they knew something was coming

[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.320]
And then of course now in Sudan they're saying the same thing and plus more in Saudi Arabia

[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.920]
I all my I don't want to see anybody get injured

[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:07.320]
But you almost have to like have a little bit of glee over the fact that the Saudis are having us come up and bite him right back

[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.260]
And he asked they nurtured it even on the newscast even on the propaganda news in America

[00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:16.200]
All of it as dirt found not guilty of murder in neighbors dead. I haven't found that story Fred Dursd

[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:17.000]
I didn't know he killed anybody

[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:21.980]
But the Saudis have been nurturing it and funding it and supporting it like that cbc documentary

[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:27.000]
I played a couple of times with is on our website still and all of a sudden it bites bites him in the ass

[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.440]
Somebody drew a good analogy. They said it's just like if you raise a pet snake

[00:56:32.940 --> 00:56:36.080]
You raise a snake and all of a sudden one day when you least expect it

[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.460]
You know you feed it you help it grow and you encourage it and then one day

[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:44.820]
Just snares up its head and bites you right in the ass and that's what's happening in freaking Saudis

[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:47.300]
Maybe this will wake up and get them off their schmothas you know it

[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.060]
11 past 11 at 560 WQM if you need to get some help for your head if your head it looks like bokeh brine

[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:56.580]
But I tell you one thing he lost a lot of weight most of them is head

[00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:03.920]
He lost about 40 pounds of hair and you guys out there you can empathize because most of us have that male pattern baldness that the Lord likes to dispense

[00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.740]
Freely just hands it out to almost everybody

[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.940]
So Charles Alfier is the guy you ought to be talking to because you can go to a lot of people

[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:14.140]
There must be a thousand different ways that you can try to fill in that spot on your head now

[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:20.220]
And most of them in fact almost all of Marluiticus the holes in the head the magic pills that supposedly make you grow hair

[00:57:20.220 --> 00:57:24.140]
I love the guys that take the pills and like every day they're like in the in the bathroom

[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:29.360]
They're looking in the mirror. You know, oh, there's a follicle maybe well, I ain't gonna get the job then if you're living to be 500 of my work

[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:36.160]
For over 25 years Charles Alfier has been helping guys look their best to rich the not so rich in everybody in between because they know that no matter

[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.980]
How much money they spend they can't get a better looking head ear than that natural hair line system

[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:43.180]
In fact Moasov said with his piece he just didn't even worth this morning

[00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:47.880]
Now he just went and down he threw the old muskrat out and everybody gets Charlie's 38-A guarantee

[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.020]
So you have nothing to lose but that ugly glaring bald spot

[00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:55.780]
If you don't love the way after 30 days that looks and feels and smells if you're not getting late at least 15 20 30 times a week

[00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.240]
Just give Charlie the old hair and he'll give you your money back and right now if you mentioned the arrages when you make the call

[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:02.700]
You get an extra 200 bucks off the already low price

[00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:07.160]
Here's the toll free number to call to get your hair back and look better and younger than you ever dreamed you could again

[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:13.280]
1 800 3 2 1 24 13 that's 1 800 3 2 1 24 13 or

[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:16.340]
Look him up on a way about Charles Alfieri dot com

[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:18.100]
You know

[00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.200]
This is sports when you're fighting

[00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:22.900]
You way up

[00:58:25.460 --> 00:58:27.420]
From the producers of American Idol

[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:32.860]
From the heartwarming collection of favorites interpreted by America's sweetheart

[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:35.100]
Jerry Shiboh

[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:46.760]
You

[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:05.500]
Of course he loves to sing look how she smiling

[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:18.420]
finally

[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:35.900]
Daniel

[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:37.000]
you

[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.820]
And

[00:59:57.370 --> 01:00:05.510]
Yes, it's Terry Shethel, live from room 214 C, another exploitation available now from the supplicant breath.

[01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:16.310]
Every note is how much he sounds like Eric, especially on that last one we're sweating.

[01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:17.790]
Wooo! Like that.

[01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.050]
Okay? That's Eric.

[01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:29.070]
1118-560 W-D-Q-A-M anyway, George Bush's 3-day visit to London next week is prompting tension between US security agents and Ken Livingstone.

[01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:34.870]
American officials are demanding an exclusion zone round a president while the London mayor wants to keep the city as open as possible.

[01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:44.150]
Metropolitan police are planning a four, I don't know what that is, a security operation to cope with an estimated 100,000 anti-war protestors.

[01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:50.130]
Why see four million pounds? God almighty, that's like $66.4 million.

[01:00:51.450 --> 01:00:57.150]
Scotland yards is it'll facilitate lawful demonstrations but campaignists say pull weeks are trying to block them. Activist planning is stopped.

[01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:02.230]
Bush protests march through central London. November 20th, the police are planning to seal off large parts of central London.

[01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:07.410]
So you think you have problems in Miami just wait. And you do have problems in Miami on week after this next week.

[01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:12.850]
Meanwhile, Michael Moore calls out the British to shout down the Bush visit. Let's hear it from Mike Morrigan.

[01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.350]
All right!

[01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:22.050]
Michael Moore author filmmaker and satirical nemesis of George W. Bush urged Britain's to take to the streets by the tens of thousands to protest the president's visit to London.

[01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:29.750]
In London, it promoted his new book, Dude, where as my country more equipped he was the advanced man for next week's first ever full-of-address state visit to Britain by US president.

[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:34.330]
Bush has been using the British people now for the better half of a year as I covered essentially to say,

[01:01:34.330 --> 01:01:39.870]
they see it's not just us the Brits are with us in Iraq, Moore told reporters, at the offices of his British publisher Penguin.

[01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:46.670]
You need to expose the line by your presence and by showing the American people that in fact the British people don't support this argue the best selling writer.

[01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:57.730]
I think British citizens have a very important job helping us remove Bush from office next year. White House planners reported Monday to be pressing British authorities to virtually shut down most of central London which I just mentioned in the other article.

[01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:05.750]
I wonder if while they're there the president's going to have a little maybe cup of tea and some crumpets with Prince Charlie with Princess Charlie, you think?

[01:02:07.330 --> 01:02:09.750]
Poor Princess Charlie, man, in that is shame.

[01:02:11.610 --> 01:02:16.230]
There most definitely are several queens in Buckingham Palace make no mistake about it, okay?

[01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:23.630]
Much of silly Brits, I've been telling these people for years that they're all a bunch of pansies over there and oh no that kneel he thinks everybody's a fag right I've been telling you that.

[01:02:24.070 --> 01:02:32.650]
British men, fags, redundancy, 56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line.

[01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:41.630]
Brazilians are off to the races, baby 52, a Colombians are hot on a razz with 44, Americans 40, mix and match. Here's Delray Beach, hello.

[01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.870]
Delray Beach, the one and only, yes sir.

[01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:48.550]
What's that?

[01:02:49.890 --> 01:02:50.930]
Oh yeah, and she great.

[01:02:51.370 --> 01:02:54.210]
I have never heard of the, I almost wrecked my word truck.

[01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.710]
Terry sucks out the hits, baby.

[01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:59.790]
That was the greatest thing if anybody doesn't like it they can go screw their soul.

[01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:02.550]
They can kiss my ass right they can kiss both of my balls fun.

[01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.870]
They can kiss everybody's ass in mine.

[01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:06.750]
They can look my genitalia.

[01:03:06.830 --> 01:03:07.810]
They can kiss Terry's ass.

[01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.390]
Right.

[01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:11.070]
I don't want to say that was the best thing ever heard Neil.

[01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:13.230]
Excellent. Okay get back on the road. Thanks.

[01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:13.770]
Wonderful.

[01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.690]
Guy drove off the road there from Boca-Brown, he's a real hoot.

[01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:19.730]
She sounded awful out like Helen Keller you notice.

[01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:22.350]
566705, I can't believe we got line wide.

[01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:23.810]
I just want to hear the dial tone on line one.

[01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:25.510]
Oh, that great.

[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.330]
And that's cause of fix it. That's cause number one.

[01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:31.990]
I'm here for a while and number two fix it was here and I said hey this needs to be fixed.

[01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:34.850]
Okay, and he did it like magic in no time at all.

[01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.870]
Like in less than a half an hour the office phone back there now that works.

[01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:41.850]
See the rest of you fakers around here it's unfortunate for you.

[01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:43.950]
It's lucky for us but unfortunate for you.

[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:48.350]
That Jim Yelton came to work here at WQA and because he goes to show the rest of you

[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:51.330]
what a bunch of incompetent lungheads you are and I don't want to hear the excuse well.

[01:03:51.570 --> 01:03:54.210]
You know we got kiss and we got power 96 yeah kiss this.

[01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.950]
That's my response to that okay.

[01:03:57.170 --> 01:04:00.770]
All they do is make excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses.

[01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:01.890]
It can't be done.

[01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.310]
There's no way to fix it. We don't give a crap with that.

[01:04:04.410 --> 01:04:06.550]
That last one that's the only honest one. They don't give a crap.

[01:04:06.770 --> 01:04:07.310]
They don't care.

[01:04:07.770 --> 01:04:10.850]
Now you notice how you saw all of a sudden he just very businessman like he will

[01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:12.290]
disappear out of here for a half an hour.

[01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.170]
He came back in line one was already working.

[01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:15.470]
He handed us the phone. He hooked it up.

[01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:18.450]
He stuck his thing in the right place and by the bang there it was.

[01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:21.810]
That's the way you get things done around here.

[01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:22.550]
You go to fix it.

[01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:23.110]
Absolutely.

[01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.610]
You got it. And by the way Mo nice outfit.

[01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:28.870]
I am so sorry I missed it. Maybe he wore that just for me.

[01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.290]
Huh you think trying to impress you.

[01:04:32.450 --> 01:04:34.410]
Maybe he was trying to impress me with his garb is out there.

[01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:36.050]
Maybe he was trying to match my slavomeliness.

[01:04:36.610 --> 01:04:38.570]
Hey by the way Mo I'm still a Slav and proud of it.

[01:04:39.350 --> 01:04:40.730]
Here's Kendall. Hello.

[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.590]

[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:42.210]
Yes sir.

[01:04:42.550 --> 01:04:44.850]
How are you doing with listening to you for about a hundred years man?

[01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.030]
Yeah seems like it.

[01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.370]
Seems like it on this end I'll tell you that.

[01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:53.110]
Well thanks for turning me on to the Michael Moore book the other day I was driving around

[01:04:53.110 --> 01:04:55.510]

[01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:59.950]
So I went to the bookstore picked it up I'm about more than halfway through.

[01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:04.830]
I'm at the section there where he teaches you how to speak to your Republican brother.

[01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:05.230]
Right.

[01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:08.330]
By the way, you're at Venice Waylands get air of Venice Waylands on there.

[01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:14.830]
Well thanks a lot Neil.

[01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:15.990]

And down with Bush.

[01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:21.630]
Venice Waylands especially the women is this chronic faxist thing.

[01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:22.410]
He did read this already.

[01:05:22.410 --> 01:05:24.770]
No it says are the most beautiful supple creatures on earth.

[01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.190]
Just look at the number of his universe titles they own by the way did you find a curious

[01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.030]
the US evacuated.

[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:30.230]
Yeah, how we did read that.

[01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.190]
Well so long ago.

[01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:32.310]
Easy to forget.

[01:05:33.830 --> 01:05:35.950]
How we doing with that best of Neil stuff.

[01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:37.730]
We got an appearance yet lined up for this week.

[01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.890]
No.

[01:05:38.110 --> 01:05:38.530]
I don't know.

[01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:39.490]
I don't know what's going on.

[01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:40.570]
I saw him go briefly yesterday.

[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:41.270]
We just don't know.

[01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:44.070]
I did see some checks though come floating in here yesterday when I came back.

[01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:46.570]
All these people I want to like handed to me personally.

[01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:47.770]
Don't forget hockey game tonight.

[01:05:47.890 --> 01:05:48.830]
For else got to write that check.

[01:05:49.170 --> 01:05:51.710]
Bring your check book to the hockey game or just pull out a check.

[01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:52.730]
Just pull it out for real.

[01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:53.810]
Keep bastard.

[01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:54.250]
Let's go.

[01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:54.950]
Let's get with it.

[01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.890]
Abandoned pet rescue.

[01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:56.690]
No excuses.

[01:05:57.090 --> 01:05:58.750]
No more excuses from the people around here.

[01:06:00.570 --> 01:06:05.670]
I mean if Dave Hagen with his wife and everything could afford a nice check and Curtis who doesn't make like two nickels.

[01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:06.770]
If he could afford a check.

[01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:10.750]
And some of the other poor schleppers around here were really give a crap who tried to help out.

[01:06:10.810 --> 01:06:11.510]
Be a part of the thing.

[01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:13.850]
We just don't have enough team players on this radio station.

Shows up whenever he feels like it.

[01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:03.950]
Joa Costello hates him like poison wishes he would die a wicked death.

[01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:06.850]
Wish he was like a Mack truck would run over right out in the parking lot.

[01:07:07.570 --> 01:07:08.030]

[01:13:58.490 --> 01:13:59.470]
Okay, there's a radio engineer.

[01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.050]
Sometimes it's just amazing to me.

[01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:08.410]
The things that I read, the things that really count that I think I'm going to go response to.

[01:14:08.530 --> 01:14:09.910]
And there's, you know, nothing.

[01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:11.150]
And then something like that.

[01:14:11.170 --> 01:14:11.710]
But that was nice.

[01:14:11.850 --> 01:14:13.030]
You know, he, uh, that's a good point.

[01:14:13.710 --> 01:14:15.570]
Every job category, there's a few good people.

[01:14:15.570 --> 01:14:16.870]
And of course, there's some real assholes.

[01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.390]
It's like doctors, you know, anybody found a good doctor lately?

[01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:24.430]
Although I do want to thank my good close personal friend, Dr. Bush, for calling me early this morning.

[01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:27.070]
Maybe it was the trepidation of going over to the Cleveland Clinic again.

[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:28.070]
Oh, you wouldn't do that, would you?

[01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:32.610]
You know, while I was desperate, you know, maybe it was the fear of going back there again and letting them butcher me up again.

[01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:37.830]
That I, maybe psychologically in my sleep, my body healed itself at irritable bowel.

[01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:40.570]
I just shoved in a towel and healed it all up.

[01:14:41.830 --> 01:14:42.230]
Wow.

[01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:43.770]
And then sealed it with a trowel.

[01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:45.610]
Now, thanks a lot, Doc.

[01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:46.690]
I think I got peace of mind.

[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:48.850]
I got, I'm telling you, I don't know what it was like magic.

[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.490]
Ever have that?

[01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:54.190]
Something just annoy and aggravate and tear your guts out for days and weeks.

[01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:57.390]
And then all of a sudden you wake up on day and like, like magic.

[01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:58.030]
It's all gone.

[01:14:58.810 --> 01:14:59.470]
I think.

[01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:02.310]
Billionaire Soros takes on Bush.

[01:15:02.490 --> 01:15:03.470]
This is from Newsweek.

[01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:04.730]
You got it?

[01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:07.390]
Laura Blumfeld in a Washington Post writes?

[01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:11.910]
Well, actually, it's not from Newsweek, it's from MSNBC, which shares their website with Newsweek.

[01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:18.530]
George Soros, one of the world's richest men, is given away nearly $5 billion to promote democracy in the former Soviet block African Asia.

[01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:21.050]
Now, he has a new project, defeating President Bush.

[01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:24.510]
It is the central focus of my life, Soros.

[01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:26.530]
The first set is Blue Eyes settled on an unseen target.

[01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:30.990]
The 2004 presidential race he said in an interview is a matter of life and death.

[01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.410]
Absolutely correct.

[01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:38.250]
Soros, who has financed efforts to promote open societies in more than 50 countries around the world, is bringing the fight home, he said.

[01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:45.510]
On Monday, he and a partner committed up to $5 million to move on.org, a liberal activist group bringing to $15.5 million,

[01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:48.070]
the total of his personal contributions to Outst Bush.

[01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:49.470]
Nice going, George, baby.

[01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:53.950]
Overnight, Soros 74 has become the major financial player of the left.

[01:15:54.390 --> 01:16:00.670]
He's elicited cries of foul play from the right, and with a tight nod, he pledged, if necessary, I would give more money.

[01:16:01.150 --> 01:16:06.210]
America under Bush is a danger to the world, Soros said, then he smiled, and I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is.

[01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:10.170]
Soros believes they supremacist ideology guides this White House.

[01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:13.310]
He hears echoes of its rhetoric in his childhood and occupied Hungary.

[01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:17.430]
When I hear Bush say, you're either with us or against us, it reminds me of the Germans.

[01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:20.530]
It conjures up memories as said of the Nazi slogans on the walls.

[01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:22.770]
They're fine to admit the enemy is listening.

[01:16:23.250 --> 01:16:27.850]
My experiences under Nazi and Soviet rule have sensitized me, he said, in a soft Hungarian accent.

[01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:35.910]
Soros' contributions are filling a gap in Democratic Party finances that opened after they restrictions in the 2002 McCain-Fimgul law took effect.

[01:16:36.730 --> 01:16:44.530]
In the past political parties paid a large share of television and get out the vote cost with unregulated soft money contributions from corporations unions and rich individuals.

[01:16:44.530 --> 01:16:51.910]
The parties are now barred from accepting such money, but non-party groups in both camps are stepping in, accepting soft money and taking over voter mobilization.

[01:16:52.890 --> 01:17:00.590]
It's incredibly ironic that George Soros is trying to create a more open society by using an unregulated under-the-radar screen shadowy soft money group to do it.

[01:17:00.910 --> 01:17:06.550]
Republican National Committee spokeswoman Christine Iverson said, George Soros has purchased the Democratic Party, she said.

[01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:11.410]
In past cycle, election cycle, Soros contributed relatively modest sums.

[01:17:11.810 --> 01:17:15.830]
In 2008, it said he gave 122 grand mostly the Democratic causes and candidates.

[01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:23.370]
But recently, Soros is grown alarmed at the influence of neo-conservatives, who we call a bunch of extremist guided by a crude form of social Darwinism.

[01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:24.370]
Well said.

[01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:31.370]
Neo-conservatives Soros said are exploiting the terrorist attacks of 9-11 to promote a pre-existing agenda of preemptive war and world dominion.

[01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:39.050]
Bush feels that on 9-11 he was anointed by God, Soros said, he's leading the U.S. in the world through a vicious circle of escalating violence.

[01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:44.010]
Soros said he'd been waking at 3am, has thought shaking him like an alarm clock.

[01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:47.650]
Sitting in his robe, he wrote his ideas down, longhand on a stack of pads.

[01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:54.030]
In January, public affairs will publish them as a book, the bubble of Americans of supremacy and excerpt appears in December's Atlantic monthly.

[01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:58.870]
In the book, he argues for a collective approach to security, increased foreign aid and preventive action.

[01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:05.030]
It would be too immodest for a private person to set himself up against the president, he said, but it is in fact the Soros doctrine.

[01:18:05.790 --> 01:18:09.450]
His campaign began last summer with a help of Mort Halper, a liberal think tank veteran.

[01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:17.590]
Soros invited Democratic strategists to his house in Southampton, Long Island, including Clinton, Chief of Staff, John Podesta, Jeremy Rosner, Robert Burstein, and Carl Pope.

[01:18:18.370 --> 01:18:21.090]
They discussed the coming election, standing on their back deck.

[01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:28.330]
The evening sun angling into their eye, Soros took a side-stove Rosenthal, CEO of the Liberal activist group America coming together, and Ellen Malcolm is president.

[01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:31.730]
They were proposing to mobilize voters in 17 battleground states.

[01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:34.290]
Soros told them he would give act $10 million.

[01:18:35.130 --> 01:18:41.850]
As to about his moment in the Sun Rosenthal deadpan, we were disappointed, we thought a guy like George Soros could do more than he laughed, no kidding, it was thrilling.

[01:18:42.650 --> 01:18:46.570]
Malcolm was like getting his good housekeeping seal of approval, they were ready to kiss me, Soros quipped.

[01:18:46.570 --> 01:19:01.970]
Before cocking the next morning, his friend Peter Lewis, chairman of the Progressive Corporation, had pledged $10 million to act, Rob Lazier, founder of CEO and CEO of Real Networks, promised $2 million, Rob McKay, president McKay Family Foundation, gave $1 million, and benefactors Lewis and Dorothy Common, a half a million.

[01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:07.570]
Soros also promised up to $3 million to protest his new think tank, the Center for American Progress.

[01:19:08.610 --> 01:19:16.330]
Soros will continue to recruit wealthy donors for his campaign, having put a lot of money into the war of ideas around the world, he's learned that money buys talent you can advocate more effectively.

[01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:25.930]
At his home in Westchester, New York, he raised 115 grand for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean, he also supports Democratic presidential contenders John Kerry, Wesley Clark, and Dick Hebhart.

[01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:37.330]
In an effort to limit Soros influence, the RNC said letter to Dean Monday asking him to request the act, and similar organizations follow the McCain-Fine Gold restrictions, limiting individual contributions to two grand.

[01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:53.350]
The RNC is not the only group worked by Soros, Fred Worthheimer, president of democracy, 21, which promotes changes in campaign finances benefited from Soros' grants over the years, Soros' backed altering campaign finance, and they'd said donating close to $18 million over the past seven years.

[01:19:53.770 --> 01:20:03.570]
There's some irony giving the supporting role he played in helping to end the soft money program, Worthheimer said, I'm sorry that Mr. Soros is excited to put so much money into a political effort to defeat a candidate, we'll be watching him closely.

[01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:10.750]
And AIDS said Soros welcomes the scrutiny, Soros has become as rich as he has the AIDS said because he has a prenatural instinct for a good deal.

[01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:20.270]
Asked whether he would trade a $7 million fortune to one seat, Bush Soros opened his mouth and he closed it, the proposal hung in the air, would he become poor to beat Bush, he said, if someone guaranteed it.

[01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:25.890]
How do you like that? If someone guaranteed it, he'll give us the $7 million, guess what George, we'll take it.

[01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:29.010]
And then we'll just go and fix the damn machines.

[01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:34.350]
We'll talk to our friends at Die Bull, the fix will be in, and that'll be it.

[01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:40.610]
20 till a noon at 560 WQM, look at that, Brazilians and Colombians, they're Latinos man.

[01:20:40.610 --> 01:20:49.730]
Mm-mm, if they got it, that soft, supple skin, big ass, big gigantic bazumbas, and the women too.

[01:20:51.190 --> 01:21:10.410]

Okay, nice going Eric, get back to work. 5 out of 266 votes. 5 elective in a thweylands.

[01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:24.270]
19 till noon at 560 WQM, all of the diners now, in fact there was a piece on CNN I mentioned this yesterday, everybody in their brother now is on a low carb diet.

[01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:31.270]
Because they realize that all of the suggestions from the so-called nutritionist in America, the food pyramid, it's all a bunch of crap, that's why everybody's fat.

[01:21:32.290 --> 01:21:45.190]

There's both these words here, but I forgot because I spoke too much

[01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:41.350]
But I was allowed to lose and everybody out there was smoking by

[01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:49.350]
All right

[01:24:59.950 --> 01:25:00.410]
Oh

[01:25:08.630 --> 01:25:12.310]
Oh speaking of hallucinogenic there's our a-wall president on veterans day

[01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:17.830]
They died in distant lands to fight terror. Yeah, and not the ones you're sending their dying for nothing

[01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:23.150]
They're dying for your freaking war you idiot you grave robber you you lunatic five six seven oh five sixty

[01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:28.710]
Palm five sixty on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line and America sits back

[01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:30.950]
Just like that

[01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:33.490]
Women claim condom found in clam chowder

[01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:37.910]
For women suit. I wonder if it was like man hadn't or in the w England

[01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:39.870]

There's some great lines there, but I need the job for women suit and Irvine restaurant after one of them

[01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:48.690]
Says you found a condom in her clam chowder when they died there last year

[01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:50.510]
This is in California

[01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:55.330]
And I'm sure that the restaurant apologize, but it probably won't help because they're suing her ass

[01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:59.010]
Layla Sultans said she was eating at McCormick's and schmix

[01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:01.350]
Oh, what kind of a name is that

[01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:03.590]
SCH m-i-c-k

[01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:05.730]
McCormick and schmix seafood restaurant

[01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:09.270]
February 26, 2002 when she bit into something rubbery

[01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:11.330]
Maybe in just a clam

[01:26:12.170 --> 01:26:17.950]
We said of course you're chewing on a clam said Paula wild whatever dying in companions see when she spit it out

[01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:19.410]
When it doubt

[01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:22.550]
Paula opened wide and just spit it out

[01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:29.490]
She said she discovered it was unwrapped ruled up condom well. Thank God unwrapped

[01:26:30.130 --> 01:26:33.190]
She said she spent the next 15 minutes in a restroom vomiting

[01:26:36.810 --> 01:26:43.290]
And since seen a psychiatrist and taking medication for depression anxiety it was an unwrapped ruled up condom

[01:26:44.010 --> 01:26:46.470]
Unwrapped well, what's the big deal with that? Yeah, oh sounds

[01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:47.910]
Sounds bogus to me sweetheart

[01:26:48.990 --> 01:26:52.890]
Don't let me be the judge in that case when it out throw that bitch out. Oh, yeah

[01:26:52.890 --> 01:26:58.550]
She's taken medication for depression and anxiety because it was an unwrapped ruled up condom in the package in the package

Sultan wild sendy ham and an anamaria segala who were all having the chowder that they filed suit

[01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:11.070]
They all filed suit. I guess because they figured it wasn't the same pot

[01:27:11.850 --> 01:27:17.530]
Claiming negligence and intentional and flixing of emotional distress their cases scheduled for trial January 12

[01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:22.770]
Zined America baby. This is what your judges are spending wasting their time on cases like this crap

[01:27:23.590 --> 01:27:27.870]
A lawyer for the restaurants in McCormick and Schmicks has no idea how the condom got into the soup

[01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:32.330]
Maybe the maybe the chef was going to a party or something

[01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:36.890]
It's as big a mystery to us as it is to anybody else and attorney Patrick Stark

[01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:40.750]
We're gonna argue there's absolutely no evidence absolutely no evidence

[01:27:41.190 --> 01:27:43.410]
See in mind. It's like right there absolutely right

[01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:47.570]
To suggest the restaurant was the source of the condom rainy employer the restaurant

[01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:53.170]
McCormick and Schmicks a privately owned chain that owns 42 upscale restaurants in 19 states. I never heard of it

At a Saudi royal family they've been eating and abetting and educating and funding and all guess what like I said the serpent bit him in the ass too bad

[01:29:36.610 --> 01:29:42.050]
Here's higher Leah. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. I remember while I was back in high school

[01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:44.370]
There was an exchange to him from

[01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:50.530]
France and it was a girl and well that's good and it was weird because she we have

[01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:54.630]

[01:29:56.950 --> 01:30:03.210]
It was pretty though, but you know it's like but he's stunk right yeah, so I don't know it's true the story is that

[01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:08.470]
It is it is absolutely true there a lot of Europeans that number one don't shave out of the arms number two

[01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:11.630]
Don't use the other one number three. Haven't seen a bar of soap because they're afraid they're gonna drop it

[01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:17.210]
But that's true Prince Charles don't touch that soap man even with your hand. He's afraid he's gonna drop that and bend right over

[01:30:17.210 --> 01:30:18.650]
All right, you thank you

[01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:21.150]
Prince Charlie, baby. He's the queen of England

[01:30:21.530 --> 01:30:24.950]
What's wrong with that they want him to wear a crown so instead of being king you can be queen

[01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:27.270]
They're used to have it a queen long time now that Elizabeth bitch

He was by and married to die and he said with a sigh

[01:30:51.330 --> 01:30:57.350]
And opened his fly. Uh-oh, and that's beside the point. It's easy. He's a fag. That's all Prince Charlie's a fag anybody knows that

[01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:16.550]

[01:31:17.730 --> 01:31:19.530]

[01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:32.030]
Not just wait a minute. Oh, please don't tell me

[01:31:33.170 --> 01:31:37.770]

Hello hello, yes sir your phone is awful

[01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:48.410]

Yeah, okay, well listen your phone sucks hang it up right away. Please you're killing me

[01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:04.110]
Now see he wouldn't hang up. That's why that tone was still on there. I thought the line was screwed up

[01:32:04.110 --> 01:32:09.350]
So we don't want to talk to anybody over the age of 100. I hope you live to be 200 best of health. I'd like to you but go away

[01:32:10.570 --> 01:32:16.830]
Is it old times Chicago? See those are the hockey fans in South for it's like when Jeff DeForest used to work here old B-Fo D-Fo

[01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:22.270]
I used to talk about any Jackaman and arrangers from 100 years ago at Brad Park and the gunpoursly

[01:32:22.270 --> 01:32:26.710]
I mean that's all well and good but nobody here has any and nobody even knows who the players are today much less than

[01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:32.290]
Don't even know who Keenan is and then that no they wouldn't know Keenan my Keenan from Keenan when they haven't got any idea who we're talking about that

[01:32:32.290 --> 01:32:34.970]
That's correct. That is absolutely correct Neil. Thank you

[01:32:35.430 --> 01:32:38.290]
That's why we still haven't had one call about the Panthers fire my Keenan

[01:32:38.290 --> 01:32:42.170]
They don't have an opinion on it because they don't know who that light is. They don't have any freaking idea

[01:32:42.170 --> 01:32:43.590]
We loved up Panthers

[01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:47.590]
See that's why this whole Marlant thing that you people oh Neil you're so negative you're full of crap

[01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:51.530]
You know you're full of crap. I've been here too long for you to pull the wool over my ass

[01:32:51.930 --> 01:32:56.810]
I've seen it. I've seen the way to people responding this time when somebody's the teen gets hot

[01:32:56.810 --> 01:33:01.570]
They jump on that bandwagon man. They all of a sudden they find all the money in the world the price no matter

[01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.450]
How high they jack that price up they can find a cash no sweat

[01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:08.890]
We're going if it's $500 to park no problem no bitch in no moaning

[01:33:08.890 --> 01:33:12.210]
But all the rest of the time we don't care about that

[01:33:12.210 --> 01:33:17.510]
We don't care about the friggin Marlins baseball is boring. We don't care about the Panthers hockey is boring

[01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:18.270]
You know

[01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:21.310]
They got too many other fish to fry

[01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:26.870]
Like the fish that got fried during Tennessee on Sunday and it was a beautiful thing. Oh, right man

[01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:31.670]
I should have taped that game. I could sit home and just just watch that thing for hours

[01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:35.450]
I'd probably be squeezing it sitting there just watching that thing over and over again

[01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:40.410]
And let me say rush. Let me say this the esteemed McNair he's black, but he ain't so good. It's just the media wants to build him up

[01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:43.490]
What a jackass you are rush what an asshole

[01:33:44.190 --> 01:33:48.770]
And I think since he made the comment about Donna McNeb the Eagles will wonder every game since he said that

[01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:53.850]
Yeah, they have yeah, they want every game since he opened up his big fat mouth and then they inquire out of them with a zoxy cotton

[01:33:55.290 --> 01:34:00.310]
Yeah, and is his hearing problem that was caused by the drugs that he was popping by the thousands

[01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:03.650]
You hypocritical right-wing phony asshole. Yeah

[01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:06.770]
Where were you when Vince Foster died rush what were you doing?

[01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:09.890]
But that's right. He was with the made pop and pills. I forgot

[01:34:11.410 --> 01:34:16.330]
So take that and stick it in your pipe and smoke it and that teaches ABC and ESPN they they you know

[01:34:16.330 --> 01:34:20.610]
They they got exactly what they deserve they got what they deserve when I got Dennis Miller who's an asshole

[01:34:20.610 --> 01:34:25.090]
They got exactly what they should have respected and they got exactly what they expected with this right wing asshole

[01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:27.910]

[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:51.440]

Sure you do it we can we all believe that don't we? Right he's doing it

[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:05.800]
promo three at five sixty WQM now you'll never believe this somebody actually facts me this spotted dick rides again

[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:12.900]
This was once a very famous pudding, but now it's sadly forgotten except by a certain supermarket that has a problem with its name

[01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:17.880]
Just the thing to serve for Sunday lunch after a freezing cold wintery walk the ultimate comfort pudding

[01:38:17.880 --> 01:38:21.060]
There's no more nothing more comfortable and good spotted dick

[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:26.560]
First of all mixed the filling ingredients got the it's got the recipe here for these suet pastry and for the filling and

[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:28.560]
It's got the whole deal

[01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:36.620]
Putting ingredients in a bowl stick in your butt and here's a whole recipe for it serving the pudding in warm bowls

[01:38:36.620 --> 01:38:40.920]
Kind of thick slices with traditional English custard is an absolutely essential accompaniment

[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:42.120]
And it's a dessert dish

[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:45.000]
It's one of them awful nasty pasty British things

[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.620]
Which is what I got that pasty complexion beside the fact that it rains every day of the year

[01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.440]
But maybe four days a year it doesn't rain in England

[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:55.000]
So they all look like real pasty and of course when they go to Scotland they put on the kilts and high stockings

[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:00.640]
And then look like even so little unusual like Prince Charlie any guy that walks around like that with a dress on with him high stockings

[01:39:00.640 --> 01:39:02.380]
Why is it a big surprise that he's a fag?

[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.120]
Prince Charlie Princess Charlie

Yeah, that was real. It is for real. Why why would anybody dare to make that up?

[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:18.260]
See there there was a bus who know how to say real things on here and then there's some people are just well

Where would be be today if we had a federal investigation of the 2000 election?

[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:38.340]
Florida fights back resisting the stolen election

[01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:41.760]
tells you how a crime was committed against democracy in the year 2000

[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.140]
And how the politicians from both parties took the path of least resistance

[01:39:45.780 --> 01:39:48.940]
Through all of this you'll see the need to stand up speak up and take action

[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.580]
Well, it's about time. It's coming up this Saturday February 15. Where the hell is that thing?

[01:39:57.340 --> 01:39:59.820]
Not in here. Oh there it is. We need to take some

Soros or donating all kinds of money to help defeat president gunk. Yes

[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:33.520]

[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:02.920]

[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:04.000]
Just leave and fast

[01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.560]
Oh Iran don't have any nuclear weapons. What's that's what the U.N. says? That's always bad

[01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:13.040]
As soon as the U.N. says some company don't have nuclear weapons we go in there and bomb the crap out of them shock and awe

[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:19.200]
So now they say Iran we we checked we looked twice this used being naughty and I say it got nothing

[01:53:19.820 --> 01:53:24.520]
And in the meantime behind the scenes there's all those Nazis but I beep but I beep but I'm up and uh

[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:26.280]
Oh, and where's that fax I just got

[01:53:27.280 --> 01:53:28.300]
About Richard Pearl

[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:34.820]
He is one of the smuggest most obnoxious Nazi back to that I've ever seen in my life. He he smirks

[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:36.200]
Here it is

[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:41.960]
While we read the whole fax it starts out by saying I lived in and worked in Asia for three and a half years

[01:53:41.960 --> 01:53:47.040]
And the last year I lived in Prague but the hottest women live in Thailand. Let's put the ties on there Eric

[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.280]
How's he gonna spell ties?

[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:49.740]
THI-S

[01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.420]
Okay, I better spill it for him

[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:54.040]
THI-S ties

[01:53:56.240 --> 01:54:01.660]
He says by far and I tasted women from all parts of Asia and Prague the women were stunning but cold and unapproachable

[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:04.440]
But Thai women are my choice he says and he also says

[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:08.320]
Did you see Richard Holbrooke putting it to the most dangerous man on earth Richard Pearl this week?

[01:54:08.340 --> 01:54:12.260]
I didn't see that I wish I had it was great. Pearl was trying to hold a neo conservative line

[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:16.860]
It was going well all that horseman Holbrooke challenged him and he backed right off great. Love the show

[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:18.220]
Thank you sir whoever you are

[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:21.120]
He's in them Thai women so to speak

[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:25.140]
You'd like to tie one on oh, I love this speaking of women

[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:28.080]
This is from the guardian and the brits

[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:31.500]
It would take a brave heart to tell a scotsman his guilt looked a bit girly

[01:54:32.060 --> 01:54:38.000]
So I suggestion by EU officials that Scotland's national dress be labeled as a skirt has caused an upper and earthed the border

[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:39.960]
Is that what I just got through San only moments ago?

[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:46.740]
I think I just got too talking about the fact that they were a skirt absolutely sure and those high stockings the Celia high stockings

[01:54:48.020 --> 01:54:50.100]
The row centers on a survey from

[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:55.960]
Form sent out by used statistical agency eurostad which forces kilt makers to list their garments under women's apparel

[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.800]
The gaff was spotted by Peter McGwerdy director of caledonian highland dress manufacturers in Aberneth, England

[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:08.000]
Who queried that definition was totally could be find up to a thousand pounds if he didn't fill out the form correctly

[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:15.640]
Yesterday Scotland's first minister jack McConnell stepped into the breach and persuaded EU officials to relax the rules for the highland dress

[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.660]
Oh, it's not a skirt. Maybe now it's a dress. I'll ask for help

[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:23.240]
This was an nonsense. He said this was an nonsense. I'm reading that right

[01:55:23.240 --> 01:55:30.980]
But I'm delighted we have managed to change the forms Mr. McConnell said the design and production of kilt's is clearly important for Scotland's economy and for its celiac image

[01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:36.020]
Mr. McGwerdy a leading kilt maker said he was astounded the kilt didn't have a category of its own

[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:41.980]
Allison Ross of the Edinburgh kilt firm McPherson said she had come across a few people uncertain how to wear the kilt

[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:43.940]
But none who had mistaken it for a skirt

[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:49.660]
When you have a properly made kilt there is nothing sexier and nothing manlier she said oh yeah

[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:53.440]
There's nothing like a man in the dress just ask the Pope. He'll tell you

[01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:59.680]
God almighty a silly man in a silly ass outfit and Moe talks about the way that I dress

[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:00.120]
Oh

[01:56:00.740 --> 01:56:05.880]
And after what I heard about you this morning moe you're a good one to talk absolutely yeah you silly ass clown you

[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:10.720]

[01:56:12.380 --> 01:56:16.900]
I believe it. I think that that was just the last draw because everybody in town knows that he was the kiss of death

[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:21.740]
That when he brought that jets poison in from New York that when he came down here

[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:26.740]
He just he transferred that evil spell. He's the Trojan horse onto the whole dolphin organization

[01:56:28.980 --> 01:56:35.100]

[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.020]
And also about hockey it's a shame that they blew out keen in you know

[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:12.240]
I remember when he was when he was coaching the blues

[01:57:12.980 --> 01:57:20.320]
Do you think since you know since we're gonna have to go into the post-Keynan era the West Depository of hiring of Nolan no chance

[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:25.400]
You know he's a hell of a coach. He's sir. It's it's a it's a moot point. He's been blackball by the any

[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.240]
Nobody wants to talk about it

[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:28.600]
But he's not gonna get hired anywhere

[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:32.300]
Now every in fact in Toronto when at least started out real bad this year right off the bat

[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:37.460]
Oh, let's fire Pat Quinn and how about Ted Nolan if it's not gonna happen. I know and I really like Nolan star

[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:38.380]
He's a hell of a coach

[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:43.600]
Well, I got a better chance of making Owen roll at least any be more in this pay because he's hearing doing a plan one last thing

[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:49.580]
Yes, I can't say about Asians what what people say about all of them being hung like ants. Yeah, I know for a fact

[01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:54.360]
It's definitely not true. Why do two all right? There's a few exceptions believe me. I'm still checking

[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.040]
Thank you so and have a great day

[01:57:57.120 --> 01:58:01.740]
There you go Chinese baby Chinese nothing like a Chinese baby and what is it being of them

[01:58:02.500 --> 01:58:06.480]
Let's get the Chinese on a Eric. Okay. In fact Eric. Oh, we better put Japanese on there too

[01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:10.500]

Sometimes are and women Chinese women beautiful

[01:58:27.560 --> 01:58:31.020]
27 past of course the beauty is only skin deep. We're just talking theoretical

We don't want to like make anybody think that because that would be immoral and that would be bad

[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:41.840]

[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:11.720]
God

[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:16.420]
I don't know what do you think it's a good idea. I think plus with them won't have the people

[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:20.800]
Well, we don't care about sports. We always have them on there because uh too bad. I think that's a great idea

[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:26.940]
We could do just dolphin head coaches. No, no, no, that's not there haven't been that many dolphin head coaches

[02:04:26.940 --> 02:04:28.980]
Are you crazy? How many have been like about a half a dozen?

[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:29.600]
Yeah

[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:37.100]
How many have there been who was the first head coach with Shula the first? Sure. Okay. So since Shula how many we had Jimmy's Johnson

[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.740]
Dave wants that that's three

[02:04:40.660 --> 02:04:42.680]
Name me another dolphin head coach Scott

[02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.520]
I'll wait above greasy

[02:04:46.780 --> 02:04:47.540]
I'll wait

[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:51.340]
Now we understand my

[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:55.360]
Scott doesn't pick the poll questions. He may pick his nose, but he don't pick the poll

[02:04:56.460 --> 02:04:58.860]
And if you do pick the poll it takes a long time for it to heal

[02:04:59.900 --> 02:05:05.320]
Anyway, I'll work it out. Let me just to make dribble myself a little note here pull worst coach

[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:10.220]
In the sport. Well, we'll figure it out. Maybe we'll do it like nationwide. Who?

[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:12.400]
Dave Hagen says George Wilson

[02:05:13.240 --> 02:05:17.060]
George Wilson was the first coach in his son George Wilson Jr. was the quarterback right Dave

[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:18.760]
Am I right?

[02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:22.780]
Absolutely by the way, thanks for your check. Absolutely correct. So Dave Hagen

[02:05:23.360 --> 02:05:27.180]
How you like that? I forgot that that's 100 years ago at 1966. I do believe

[02:05:28.180 --> 02:05:32.460]
And also there was a guy from channel 10 was the first announcer for the Adolfins before Rick Weaver

[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:34.200]
What that was Joe Krogan was at it

[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:39.660]
Before Rick Weaver came along and said those memorable things like a fans beginning to blow the blow the

[02:05:40.700 --> 02:05:43.960]
Boothe waste election on guaranteed it was only one Rick Weaver

[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:48.760]
Howard David you couldn't lick Rick Weaver's a hairpiece. Okay, plus he didn't have one

[02:05:48.760 --> 02:05:51.460]
And he smelled so bad you wouldn't mind get close enough anyway

[02:05:51.960 --> 02:05:54.840]
You know I'm saying oh you wouldn't mind get close enough. Absolutely. Okay

[02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:59.240]
But he was great Rick Weaver he was he not not a very likeable guy, but what a great voice

[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:03.380]
So he was Mr. Dolphin, you know like what male Alan was to the Yankees and what

[02:06:03.900 --> 02:06:06.220]
Well, what's his name? Johnny most was to the Celtics

[02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:07.700]
That's what he was

[02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:09.180]
To the dolphins

[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:13.520]
And we had Bill Zimfer who was yeah, he's pretty good didn't have any personality

[02:06:13.520 --> 02:06:16.100]
But he was good. He was a good foil for a mad dog

[02:06:16.100 --> 02:06:18.080]
And now look what we got absolutely

[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:23.920]
Brazilians are running away with that pole today, man. Let's say find some what do you say? Let's have a party

[02:09:17.940 --> 02:09:22.760]
Ashton Kutcher was a model. I picked up the inquire when I was in the airport coming back on the weekend

[02:09:22.760 --> 02:09:27.120]
He was when he was 16 years old now. I should probably say when he was 18 year

He was 16. I'm gonna tell you. I mean, I have seldom seen anybody look like that. I mean he was

I like the we we 1248 at 560 wqm tell your friend to for all by the way to stop giving away pants or tickets

[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:08.040]
Because you see what he's done in South Florida. That's all I care about now. I'm driving into work this morning. I hear oh

[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.800]
Scott how many tickets you back? I have a couple of tickets

[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:14.720]
He wasn't even talking about giving away tickets. He didn't have any tickets to give away

[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:18.560]
But because on occasion he's done that and got sucked into giving away free tickets

[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.460]
Oh, and then we're like two or three in a row

[02:13:21.200 --> 02:13:24.400]
And I thought to myself the ass only on for two freaking hours for quite a lot

[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:28.600]
Why should we waste his valuable time with a bunch of free loading assholes? Oh, Scott

[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:31.400]
Hey listen now you're doing a hell of a job. I love you show

[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:32.980]
By the way, you got any tickets for nice game

[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:37.180]
He means well he wants people learn about hockey. Let me say it again

[02:13:37.180 --> 02:13:40.440]
Don't give away tickets. Okay. I've already been that route

[02:13:40.940 --> 02:13:47.700]
Once upon a time many years ago at iod I bought up a whole bunch of tickets for a Dallas Panther game at the old Miami arena

[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:50.780]
And I bought him up and I gave the

[02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:56.740]
Donations that people were given for him to a committee. I was the charity for our best of thing. Okay

[02:13:57.820 --> 02:13:59.140]
And low and behold

[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:03.160]
People people paid money, but for I don't know how the thing worked

[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:07.100]
But to make a long story short people got to tickets they either scalped them or they didn't show up

[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:11.580]
There was almost none of the people was like in one section almost none of the people got the tickets

[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:16.620]
Who actually showed up so they either sold them and made a profit on them or they didn't bother showing up at all

[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:20.560]
It was a total disaster in a waste of your time. Was that during the cup year?

[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.600]
No, it was the I who knows what year was what everything's gonna make no it was not during the cup year

[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.660]
Who I've been during the cup year they'd been I locked it and they're tearing the building down

[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:30.440]
No, it was not during the cup year was during like the

[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:32.100]
teacup year

[02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:38.820]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:40.460]
You won't believe this

[02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:44.400]
I don't want to get too hockey intensive, but the first year that they were in the Miami arena

[02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:47.020]
I and they let's see no in the in the arena

[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:53.360]
Right the gold lights at one end from most of the arena you couldn't see them when the gold was scored

[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.320]
You couldn't see the red light really and I kept I was screaming about it on the ear

[02:14:57.320 --> 02:15:01.860]
There wasn't one other person who complained and I alone and yours truly was responsible

[02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:06.200]
Because the guys from the organization came in before the next season and said oh well, Nia

[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:09.700]
We'll let you decide we'll let you pick which and they showed me the different models of gold lights

[02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:12.580]
They have and I picked them out the near-riders memorial gold lights

[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:18.820]
But that shows you how knowledgeable the people in South Florida that 80% of the people sitting in the stands of all

[02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:21.880]
3000 couldn't see the goddamn red light come on with a goal was scored

[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:25.860]
Well, how'd Andy go to a hockey game? I mean, well, what is that all a boot?

[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:28.820]
Huh in the public here? What a limit like that

[02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:37.020]
So don't don't delude yourself. It's never ever gonna change here. You're talking about hockey is like talking about playing Pinochle at the North Pole

[02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:39.860]
It's even though they got plenty of time to do it. They don't know from it

[02:15:41.280 --> 02:15:42.960]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello

[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:46.360]

[02:16:04.040 --> 02:16:09.500]
That's how the veterans get treated well in America not and especially under this present this a wall present

[02:16:09.500 --> 02:16:14.920]
Who's got some freaking nerve to be up there earlier making a speech on veterans day this man who was missing in action

[02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:19.900]
Missing he was a wall in the Marines what kind of a scumbag are you George W. How are you kidding?

[02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:22.220]
I would only too many people but but

[02:16:23.080 --> 02:16:26.340]
Not as many as before because now according to associated press

[02:16:27.140 --> 02:16:32.520]
Amid increasing attacks against us forces in Iraq a growing number of Americans including men and independent voters

[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:36.360]
Say the war in Iraq was not worth while according to a survey released yesterday

[02:16:37.140 --> 02:16:42.640]
Half of americans 49% say the war was not worth it compared to 48% who say it was

[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:46.340]
According to a survey conducted this month by the Annenberg Public Policy Center

[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:51.920]
That's a change from October when 52% of americans said the situation was worth going to war

[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:54.540]
43% said it was not follow the bouncing ball

[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:57.960]
5243 said it was worth it in October in November 49

[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.980]
48 say it was not worth it now

[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:05.260]
Leave a survey conducted in November 1 through 9 appeared when news of us holocaps is being shot down in Iraq

[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:11.180]
Nationwide attention and those numbers of growing dead continue escalating day after day after day

[02:17:12.220 --> 02:17:14.500]
Shifts in opinion were seen in most demographic groups

[02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.480]
But we're strongest among men independence and political moderates and people with incomes of less than

[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:22.920]
35,000 dollars a year people like scott who don't have three nickels to rub together

[02:17:25.140 --> 02:17:27.960]
How do you like that? So you can fool people for a while

[02:17:27.960 --> 02:17:31.360]
But when the bodies start coming home even if you don't let the public see the coffins

[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:34.580]
Uh, they uh, they start sniffing it and it don't smell too good

It's 1256 at 560 W. Kim see I had to adapt to more philosophical attitudes

[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:27.620]

[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:37.440]
Hey, I'll tell you place y'all to go eating that's vick and herbs in Fort Lauderdale and the reason I know vick and herbs so

[02:20:37.440 --> 02:20:41.880]
Well and so enthusiastically is because they started out in Rochester, New York, baby

[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:46.480]
Way back way back even before this old fart was born way back in 1934

[02:20:46.480 --> 02:20:51.880]
And the reason vick and herbs is so great is because the burgers and dogs are all served fresh hot and fast with

[02:20:51.880 --> 02:20:56.940]
Vick signature meat sauce poured on it. They jam on it and instead of that prefabricated fast food

[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:02.340]
Here's a chance to get something really fresh and delicious the carnivores is being brought to you by the same guy's feeding you

[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:06.020]
Cheeburger or Cheeburger. They use the same fresh 100% ground chuck meat as cheaper

[02:21:06.020 --> 02:21:10.260]
Gretcheburger on a menu you'll find a big fat one man an incredible quarter pound hot dog

[02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:15.420]
Went to the lips around that piece of sausage and what makes them different like I said is the incredible signature meat sauce

[02:21:15.420 --> 02:21:19.420]
That nobody else in town uses they got a fantastic menu for example breakfasts

[02:21:19.420 --> 02:21:23.400]
They got omelets cooked to order don't you love people who say breakfasts? I love them

[02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:26.440]
Omelets cooked to order French toast pancakes all your favorite side dishes

[02:21:26.440 --> 02:21:30.400]
So stop i vick and herbs and see what all the talk is about vick and herbs in south Florida

[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:35.260]
You'll find them right on federal highway south of barren boulevard in the tunnel where a norm can't use to hang out on the east side of the road

[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:39.380]
And be sure and tell that old neo from Rochester baby sends you by to vick and herbs

You're the ones that are keeping at the scam going

[02:27:46.300 --> 02:27:52.100]
Nothing with a gigantic scam is what it's all about and and they're multiplying like cockroaches everywhere you go

[02:27:52.100 --> 02:27:53.820]
Up by me out there in West Broward

[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:59.040]
Really oh sure when you then and what they really like to do is congregate like at the exits

[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:02.400]
And the emphasis to like the interstate like 595

[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:08.640]
And they're standing just like the a newspaper people like the sun sent people they do the same thing

[02:28:08.640 --> 02:28:13.220]
Because they have a captive audience you know people stopping at the lights and like right up here right up the corner there

[02:28:13.220 --> 02:28:16.420]
They're always there at the county line road in 441

[02:28:17.160 --> 02:28:20.060]
When you go to the uh turnpike the jersey turnpike

[02:28:21.460 --> 02:28:23.860]
Get those people off the streets man

[02:28:23.860 --> 02:28:25.260]
It's got nothing to do with first amendment

[02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:31.060]
It's got to do with a scam is what it is the one of the biggest scams and unfortunately this state can't get nothing done right nothing

[02:28:31.640 --> 02:28:32.440]
Zipity doda

[02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:37.160]
Can't just protect us in our cars and our homes all you know about up there in Tallahassee

[02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:38.820]
Esteele elections. That's pretty much it

[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:46.000]
And they also got the federal government under backs about their name uh about their child welfare program

[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:50.580]
You see that that's that's lovely so they can do whatever they want and most of the kids don't have anybody go to bad form

[02:28:50.580 --> 02:28:54.540]
But jab like that because now we won't find all those other little kids whatever happened to that little girl

[02:28:54.540 --> 02:28:55.780]

[02:29:41.120 --> 02:29:44.240]

5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line here's a couple of old sunrise. Hello

[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:32.460]
Hey Neil what's going on? How you doing sir? I'm doing fantastic listen. I got a couple things here um

[02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:35.940]
I don't know if you're talking about it yesterday or if it's on the website yet

[02:30:35.940 --> 02:30:42.060]
Check I just got around to it to it today. You're article that you posted with uh I think guys by thing with the mar being uh

[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:46.720]
Stuff there in the concentration cancer right inquiry can't

[02:30:47.240 --> 02:30:53.040]
Amazing story. I couldn't read it today. I'm not too happy about that. Hey couldn't read a single thing afterwards

[02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:58.600]
I am still in a four hours later that story needs to be on every newspaper in this country

[02:30:58.600 --> 02:31:02.040]
Yes, I can think about it. It's really sad

[02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:06.140]
The big thing about intelligence that always use the back bars maybe isn't that amazing

[02:31:06.140 --> 02:31:12.260]
But we can't figure out who's right who's wrong who's the bad guy who's the good guy whether it's an iraq or whether it's in our own country

[02:31:12.260 --> 02:31:15.080]
Or whether it's right across our own order like Vietnam all over again

[02:31:15.080 --> 02:31:16.780]
We can't even figure out who the bad guys are

[02:31:16.780 --> 02:31:21.860]
So let's just kill a whole bunch of people it's like over the weekend when the American troops are given orders now

[02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:25.460]
Now we're starting to get pissed off over those helicopters that got shut down all the deaths

[02:31:25.460 --> 02:31:29.700]
So now we're just dropping these big gigantic five hundred thousand pound bombs and we're like

[02:31:29.700 --> 02:31:34.560]
Just shooting at anybody we can just to kill a bunch of people to send a message, you know, just like Joey Zaza

[02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:35.760]
We're gonna send them a message

[02:31:36.900 --> 02:31:37.700]
It also

[02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:44.320]
Five minutes an age veterans day and like you said we got an a-wall person that wants to speak and if you speak outing at the American

[02:31:44.320 --> 02:31:51.020]
Go on a wave in American flags and their bumper stickers where they tie their little yellow little ribbons around trees

[02:31:51.520 --> 02:31:52.060]
You know

[02:31:52.780 --> 02:31:56.200]
Those ribbons and they want to be out there protesting man the other demand

[02:31:56.200 --> 02:31:59.860]
They know these kids be brought back here right now they can be brought by the weekend, okay?

[02:32:00.260 --> 02:32:01.720]
Flies don't what troops alive

[02:32:02.220 --> 02:32:03.980]
The slides over there don't give our

[02:32:04.840 --> 02:32:09.240]
Veterans their benefit for radiation point and as they got over there the truth just

[02:32:09.240 --> 02:32:13.780]
Not come out but slowly it's starting to kneel it's seeping man. It's seeping out

[02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:20.820]
Your work meal everybody appreciates it's the truth come out. Oh, yeah, just listen to the calls you can tell they really appreciate

[02:32:22.920 --> 02:32:23.240]

[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:34.040]
We're doing it. We're gonna change the world right here on the radio

[02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:38.680]
We're gonna put that rush limbo on his plan. No by the way we kicked his ass in last book even before he went into rehab

[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:43.860]
How do you like that? I wish I wish we had the copy of the book that was sitting here George was in here earlier

[02:32:44.320 --> 02:32:46.040]
And he said he left me a copy of the whole

[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:51.220]
Summer rating book there, but the only problem is somebody ran off with it like everything else in here

[02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:56.780]
If it's not nailed down because this is a playground in here. It's not a radio studio. It's a freaking playground is what it is

[02:32:56.780 --> 02:32:59.540]
Which is very sad and we keep telling off the same thing and stuff

[02:33:00.780 --> 02:33:02.320]
It's got's crying like a little baby, you know

[02:33:03.460 --> 02:33:06.180]
Then he runs back in the hallway and asked Greg to wipe his ass for him

[02:33:06.180 --> 02:33:09.440]
And then that's it then goes back and sits on his chair and listen to the show the rest of the day

[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:10.420]
That's it. That's what he does

[02:33:11.080 --> 02:33:11.680]

[02:36:26.440 --> 02:36:29.020]
Accurrent the fiasco that's going on and that's very sad

[02:36:29.020 --> 02:36:32.760]

[02:36:52.160 --> 02:36:53.660]
Except the course for paysox

[02:36:54.380 --> 02:37:02.280]
Here's an email from move on dot org dot whatever it is. Yeah move on dot org a great organization for those of us to the left of Hitler

[02:37:02.800 --> 02:37:08.480]
It says do you move on member? It's only been three weeks since we lost our ten million dollar grassroots fundraising campaign in that time

[02:37:08.480 --> 02:37:13.360]
Over 70,300 people have pitched into one adds that highlight president bushes failed policies

[02:37:13.360 --> 02:37:18.020]
If all the checks come in we've together we've given a whopping three point six million dollars

[02:37:18.020 --> 02:37:22.740]
That's why this campaign to expose president bushes attracted the attention to some heavy hitters today

[02:37:22.740 --> 02:37:27.720]
George Soros and Peter Lewis to the countries leading philanthropist have announced their strong support of our effort

[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:32.800]
They've pledged to match every dollar given by those of us in a grassroots with 50 cents of their own in other words

[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:34.800]
If we raise ten million they'll put up another five million

[02:37:35.900 --> 02:37:39.360]
Politicians pundits and all the press are watching this ever closely to see what happens

[02:37:39.360 --> 02:37:43.500]
President bushes raking in millions in two thousand dollar checks for the first time

[02:37:43.500 --> 02:37:48.580]
We're in a position to show that small donors working in partnership with the big ones can counter balance the influence of rich

[02:37:48.580 --> 02:37:51.760]
Republicans we can do it but we'll have to dig deep and bring in more people

[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:53.720]
Please help however you can

[02:37:53.720 --> 02:37:57.700]

5 6 7 0 5 60 and the PR Ralph

[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:02.600]
Puerto Rican Ralph says now that you're back in town

[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:07.700]
Don't forget to Ricky Tickey show daily NBC 6 at 4 p.m. It's a good nap taker. I'll pass El Paso Ralph

[02:39:08.220 --> 02:39:13.820]
Also any news on the Dave Wayne meeting? No, where's Wayne playing the godfather music in the background making him an offering can't refuse

[02:39:15.420 --> 02:39:19.880]
That's a good question Ralph and this of course being the sports station. You think we know something about that, you know

[02:39:21.280 --> 02:39:28.040]
But this being the sports station they don't pay any attention to the show so we don't know if we miss in I want to make them an offer down or not

[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:32.780]
5 6 7 0 5 60 we got a word on the meeting. No, no, that's supposed to be anything

[02:39:32.780 --> 02:39:36.680]
I said he's not gonna fire us ass. That's all he's not firing him so probably fire us ass

[02:39:36.680 --> 02:39:38.960]
If it was me I'd fire us ass

[02:39:39.480 --> 02:39:44.700]
Oh, I would too because if you saw the lack of effort forget about all these arguments about well the offensive line

[02:39:44.700 --> 02:39:46.620]
And Jason Taylor's got a big mouth, you know

[02:39:46.620 --> 02:39:51.900]
There was no effort that there weren't interested it weren't the least bit motivated interested it was like a joke

[02:39:52.460 --> 02:39:57.200]

Oh arrested Russian businessman is Carlisle group advisor. I meant to read this story early

[02:42:00.700 --> 02:42:02.940]
I'm glad I did right now though because we might have a few people listening

[02:42:03.500 --> 02:42:08.820]
The arrest of two of Russia's top businessman in recent months was more than a distant headline for Washington's well-connected

[02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:14.180]
Private equity firm the Carlisle group. How do you like that? Where have we heard that name before

[02:42:16.100 --> 02:42:22.700]
Carlisle known for the glittering roster of former statesman among its partners and advisors has ties to both Mikhail Katerovsky and

[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:25.200]
Platon Levative the jailed Russian tycoons

[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:32.900]
Katerovsky 40 where Russia's richest man and former chief executive of Eukos oil company serves as an advisor to Carlisle's energy group

[02:42:32.900 --> 02:42:40.640]
He's among 15 luminaries who have the firm sort through investment opportunities in energy industry along with former secretary state James Baker the third

[02:42:42.080 --> 02:42:44.100]
former british prime minister John major

[02:42:45.240 --> 02:42:49.120]
And he looks her prize-winning author Daniel Eurgen skip he doesn't realize he's not allowed in here

[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:50.840]
Because he didn't give a dime to abandon pair rescue

[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:55.040]
So he's not allowed in the building he can't read somebody read him the sign on the door. He's not allowed in the studio

[02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:57.260]
Katerovsky was arrested last month

[02:42:57.260 --> 02:42:59.600]
I Russian authorities for alleged fraud and tax evasion

[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:06.880]
Because the billionaire has seen his impossible political rival to present a Putin his arrest is unsettled the country's business community and worried for an investors

[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:16.780]
Carlisle spokesman Christopher W. Alman declined a comment on the matter sources close to the firm say Carlisle is taking a cautious look at the business climate in Russia

[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:22.420]
So far Carlisle has no investments in Russia and hasn't followed through on preliminary discussions about starting a boy

[02:43:22.420 --> 02:43:26.080]
Buyout fund with Russian investment company alpha group the sources said

[02:43:26.620 --> 02:43:29.380]
Neither man is playing a significant role for Carlisle sources said

[02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:32.760]
Carlisle does not disclose its compensation to advisors

[02:43:32.760 --> 02:43:37.960]
Meanwhile the firm has lost the services of its most prominent associate former president George H. W. Bush

[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:43.240]
Bush one who was senior advisor for Carlisle's Asia funds retired last month shortly after serving as the main drug

[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:46.460]
Adinner in Moscow to move investors to rake in the big bucks

Doesn't ring a bell who now is that?

[02:51:36.300 --> 02:51:41.340]
Does anybody have any idea who that lies here as hell don't I don't know what you're talking about that's the facts

[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:45.980]
Here's another fact. I think why I understand why you wouldn't say anything publicly supporting them

[02:51:45.980 --> 02:51:49.480]
Stranger against the trade agreement in Miami next week. I'm sure the power is to be

[02:51:50.020 --> 02:51:54.860]
Well, what the hell does that mean? I'm supposed to incite people to go out there and riot what an asshole another asshole

[02:51:55.700 --> 02:52:00.340]
PS may our borrow the QA and van that might make it easier to woman. Oh, I know who this is from this another chronic

[02:52:02.380 --> 02:52:06.320]
Brother, I'll even attempt to raise some cash for ban and pet rescue by selling your merchandise while I'm there

[02:52:06.320 --> 02:52:09.980]
Well great have a good time see this business of civil disobedience to a point of like

[02:52:10.340 --> 02:52:15.340]
Busted up people stores and they're causing millions and millions of dollars of damage and destroying people's livelihoods

[02:52:15.340 --> 02:52:17.760]
Don't get the job done doesn't work doesn't work

[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:21.820]
So if you think I'm gonna sit here and support a bunch of crazy people you're wrong

[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:29.800]
And I'll say it again why anybody why any city anywhere in this country would allow would allow that kind of a gathering to take place in their midst

[02:52:29.800 --> 02:52:31.200]
They they must need mental help

[02:52:33.480 --> 02:52:36.440]
56705 60 pound 560 on the 18t

[02:52:36.440 --> 02:52:39.280]
They aren't any other chronic facts. You says an honor of veterans day

[02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:41.380]
I'm working today, but it's okay

[02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:44.960]
I feel we should honor the veterans by giving all veterans the day off with paying the rest of it should work

[02:52:44.960 --> 02:52:46.040]
Not a bad idea Arnie

[02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:49.540]
Too many of us don't appreciate what the veterans have done for us in our country

[02:52:49.540 --> 02:52:53.860]
I thank them all and we echo that sentiment Arnie the only problem be in the ones who are now who are gonna be veterans

[02:52:53.860 --> 02:52:59.440]
We hope if they stay alive are fighting a they're fighting a cause that's unjust uncalled for and outrageous

[02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:03.840]
And they're being put in a harm's way by a bunch of lunatic Nazis who don't give a flying crap about them at all

[02:53:05.040 --> 02:53:05.880]
But at any rate

[02:53:07.560 --> 02:53:11.720]
56705 60 pound 560 on the 18t in Verizon wireless line

[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:15.320]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir

[02:53:15.320 --> 02:53:19.460]
I don't know anybody want to talk about it, but Caitlin Faber is a Kobe Bryant accuser

[02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:26.480]
They have a name and a picture plaster on that lovely. Yeah, but see that that's always the way it is when some athlete when some dumb

[02:53:26.480 --> 02:53:31.420]
Jack rapes somebody who's accused of it. Let's always blame the bitch the bitch did this and she had sex three times

[02:53:31.420 --> 02:53:34.920]
That I before in a day and she done this. Let's always blame the bitch and make her look bad

[02:53:34.920 --> 02:53:36.820]
You know just just like a Robert Blake thing

[02:53:36.820 --> 02:53:39.860]
Yeah, wait a gun. I mean not like putting yourself in a jackpot

[02:53:39.860 --> 02:53:44.440]
When you got all the money into the world you can you can hire whatever woman you want to go right exactly

[02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:51.120]
He's got a hot wife and get any damn hooker that he wants to wear exactly for like pocket chains to everybody else and he's busy

[02:53:51.120 --> 02:53:54.860]
Hitting on some bitch another freaking brain surgeon right hey

[02:53:54.860 --> 02:54:00.900]
As much as you and rightfully so I'll give guilty a hard time. He as bad as he is I'm hockeying anything else

[02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:06.980]
Well, you were away prior to the world series. Yeah, doing like Marlon's baseball talk and this guy

[02:54:06.980 --> 02:54:10.580]
No, I mean you might as well put on mad dog talking soccer for Christchurch or a mask

[02:54:10.580 --> 02:54:12.380]
This guy just cool it

[02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:15.600]
As horrible as he is when I keep but uh

[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:18.100]
No, at least he's consistent anyway

[02:54:18.660 --> 02:54:24.140]
I just don't like the way that he always I mean so predictable because no matter what no matter who the it is whether it's

[02:54:24.140 --> 02:54:26.380]
Built-tory or Brian Murray or uh

[02:54:26.960 --> 02:54:31.280]
The Terry Murray no matter who the people are he always sucks up to the organization

[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:34.440]
They're always doing the right thing and the players always have this they're always great

[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:36.740]
And then as soon as they get rid of somebody like brewery

[02:54:36.740 --> 02:54:41.580]
He always sings the company line. Oh, he was divisive in the room and he was this and which is a pile of bull crap

[02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:45.780]
They just they always made up some bad crap about everybody that they dumped out of here because they didn't want to pay

[02:54:45.780 --> 02:54:48.440]
And you remember the ten million dollars they were gonna say with brewery salary

[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:52.140]
Uh, they're still not spending it. They got a nineteen million dollar payroll, which is a joke

[02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:57.060]
Yeah, you know, you had one magical season here out of all right, and the rest of it's been crap

[02:54:57.960 --> 02:54:59.480]
Yeah, thanks for taking a call and you'll pay

[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:00.480]
Have a great day pal thanks

[02:55:01.120 --> 02:55:05.560]
I mean, you know, I don't expect a you know a fan you go whether they win or lose just like the lease

[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:07.160]
I've been a fan for 40 or five years

[02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:12.280]
But the fact that a matter is put something out there that people can appreciate put it on an honest product out there

[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:18.580]
Plus the quality the ice of that arena I have never ever seen anything so bad. It's like it's like trying to um

[02:55:19.320 --> 02:55:20.540]
I'm trying to think of a parallel

[02:55:21.040 --> 02:55:26.840]
Like trying to skate on sand on quick sand. Have you ever seen ice so bad when the LA game they played a few nights ago

[02:55:26.840 --> 02:55:30.220]
All you could see is guys falling down all the time. Yeah, everybody was on that

[02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:35.680]
Trip by the blue line if you part my expression everybody's falling out because the quality the ice is just brutal

[02:55:35.680 --> 02:55:38.360]
Now I haven't been there yet this season. I'll go tonight if I'm wrong

[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.480]
I'll be sure to say that tomorrow, but from what I've seen on TV. Uh, it still looks really really bad

[02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:45.060]
You're not wrong at all. Well, that's pathetic. I mean, what is that

[02:55:45.580 --> 02:55:47.840]
When they didn't have a goal. I think you could see the first year

[02:55:47.840 --> 02:55:51.480]
Let's get some people in that organization who know what the hell that they're doing

[02:55:52.520 --> 02:55:56.700]
Instead of some guy who wants to be you know a hobby Alan Cohen and Bernie kosher

[02:55:56.700 --> 02:55:59.920]
Well, you won't see Bernie no more unless he's up there in a box getting mine to dine

[02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:03.440]
Here's the facts from Pete the chronic board up

[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.840]
Belated birthday and thanks for the tickets uh, uh, lead the uh Kings game. Oh, there you go

[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:11.700]
He says it was like a morgue 100 the upper deck was 10% full of that

[02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:16.120]
Why I saw that TVP you don't have to worry about it. I got the hockey package up there, eh?

[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:19.360]
I saw a good part of that game and it was embarrassing

[02:56:20.700 --> 02:56:23.460]
And a Kings you notice how hot the Kings have been lately they got eight wins

[02:56:23.460 --> 02:56:25.080]
They're in first place in their division. They're on fire

[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:28.820]
But in the meantime they look like a bunch of little girls out there was a horrible game

[02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:34.280]
Because they couldn't skate they kept falling down. The ice is bad. It's oh there goes Neil complain

[02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:38.100]
And again, well, I'm just telling you the way it is see this is what kills me about a lot of people in this town

[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:41.900]
If you tell him the truth if you tell like the way it is instead of saying well

[02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:45.780]
Gee, at least we got somebody honest enough to like tell it like it isn't trying to do something about oh

[02:56:45.780 --> 02:56:48.400]
You do is wine and complain and stuff like that

[02:56:49.100 --> 02:56:50.120]
stuff like that

[02:56:51.300 --> 02:56:55.820]
And stuff like why don't you go back to Canada you do bastard. Oh, what a great idea

[02:56:56.780 --> 02:57:02.600]
20 till two at five sixty uh that guy had called little while ago with his thing about the Chinese okay. I'll tell you one thing

[02:57:04.460 --> 02:57:10.880]
Everybody in Toronto that I encounter they all do one amazing thing. No, not that they all speak English

[02:57:11.580 --> 02:57:12.060]
Wow

[02:57:12.060 --> 02:57:19.400]
I heard they have manners too even though we do have all these Chinese and Pakistanians and Indians a lot of them speak with an accent and

[02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:22.220]
You name it every ethnic group from all over the world

[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:26.480]
Don't hear too much esponial, but nevertheless everybody who's there speak at English

[02:57:27.440 --> 02:57:32.900]
You don't see any arguments and none of that frog stuff like in Montreal about the you know if you don't speak friends probably who up your ass

[02:57:32.900 --> 02:57:33.760]
not that

They get along generally speaking polite friendly courteous

[02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:42.840]

[02:57:43.340 --> 02:57:47.040]
Civilized not about your wild west cowboys like our president want to shoot up everybody

Like a guy damn Yahoo

[02:57:57.080 --> 02:58:01.620]
So far by the way are we getting the big snakes out of the big holes? No, not getting them nothing too well

[02:58:03.600 --> 02:58:07.880]

[03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:31.180]
It's probably on I can't look at it again. I don't have time

[03:02:31.620 --> 03:02:35.160]
I love the MoMo teeth, but will any of the merchandise come in the previous years pictures?

[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:38.900]
I'd love to have a coffee mug with a caricature of you on a cloud to go along with my t-shirt

[03:02:38.900 --> 03:02:41.740]
Well that's a good idea. We'll uh, when in doubt. We'll check it out

[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:46.840]
As a side note, Michelle says the other day we're talking about your mom's obsession about bowel movements

[03:02:46.840 --> 03:02:52.560]
You are so lucky that you're not a female because it's a common thing for women to have a whole discussion about menstrual cycles

[03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:57.180]
It's happened to me several times in restrooms elevators and just about anywhere that a group of women who don't know each other

[03:02:57.180 --> 03:02:59.900]
We'll start discussing how they had it right now and they're bleeding a river

[03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:06.020]
I never participated in that. I hated I'd rather talk about bowel movements and then she says have a good one

[03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:11.800]
Ha ha ha ha I'm not sure what she means when she says have a good one oh I did Michelle believe me last night

[03:03:11.800 --> 03:03:13.920]
20 30 40 good ones wow

[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:15.840]
Don't get so about it, but I did

[03:03:16.660 --> 03:03:21.560]
I think that's what did it. I think I got uh, man. I have been so filled up with gas. I mean

[03:03:21.560 --> 03:03:23.120]
Gas up the old ass

[03:03:24.060 --> 03:03:28.680]
I'm serious for two or three last two or three days. Maybe it was the beginning of getting all this out of my system

[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:35.360]
Because I have I had enough gas to run my corvette for a year that I've released from my body in the last three days

[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:38.480]
It's a good idea. You don't eat here especially when you're lying there embedded night

[03:03:38.480 --> 03:03:41.260]
You know all alone and you I don't want to get too graphic

[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:45.660]
But you reach over and you pull because you want no seriously you want to be sure that it's only gas

[03:03:45.660 --> 03:03:50.060]
You know you're something that I want to make a mess of bed and you pull one chicocyle a little bit and then you like

[03:03:50.780 --> 03:03:51.640]
There you go

[03:03:52.080 --> 03:03:56.180]
Now you know what I'm talking about you've done that everybody's done it nobody else talks about that's me

[03:03:56.180 --> 03:03:59.340]
Sure you pull a chicocyle you sneak a good one

[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:03.440]
Or a hundred good ones man. I was just loaded with gas

[03:04:04.220 --> 03:04:05.160]
loaded with gas

[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:10.460]
Maybe I'm getting ready for the shortage. I don't know but I wake up this morning. It is all gone

[03:04:10.460 --> 03:04:14.440]
All got thanks anyway to the rimmers my close personal friends even though George hates them like poison

[03:04:14.440 --> 03:04:17.820]
They've been very nice to me simply and I'm not going to no dinners. Okay

[03:04:18.540 --> 03:04:19.600]
Too late for that anyway

[03:04:21.160 --> 03:04:24.960]
Here's a Steve from Davies says thank you God a radio being a fan of long time love you man

[03:04:24.960 --> 03:04:27.900]
I'd like to add Puerto Ricans to the pool. Yeah, let's get Puerto Ricans on air

[03:04:27.900 --> 03:04:32.760]
That's my last request to you Eric because you've done a fabulous job today under difficult circumstances

[03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:37.760]
It says my girl is beautiful. She's Puerto Rican. I love her to death. What an ass on her

[03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:42.220]
Atta boy Steve he says JLo is hot in my eyes. She's Puerto Rican

[03:04:42.220 --> 03:04:42.560]
Well

[03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:45.120]
There must be a lot of people in Southfoot who agree with me

[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:50.220]
Well, let's put Puerto Ricans on air because the South Americans do like a big big fat lovely

[03:04:50.720 --> 03:04:50.960]
ass

[03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:55.780]
No Cubans like the big ass too believe me all they Julio's that's a that's a Julio thing

[03:04:55.780 --> 03:05:02.180]
They like a big ass. I'm not too sure about Peruvians or whatever, but most Latinos they like big ass

[03:05:03.280 --> 03:05:07.180]
5 6 7 0 5 16 fact maybe even fat boy can hook up with some of these people

[03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:09.580]
Because when it comes to fat ass

[03:05:10.120 --> 03:05:11.260]

Yeah, you know something if I was on the year in 50 states and we had the Richard Mellon scape money behind me

[03:05:47.500 --> 03:05:50.160]
You're right all this cut and paste. What about 80 million links?

[03:05:50.660 --> 03:05:56.660]

Now he's sold out to the right wing. You know, you do what you got to do you go step in line

[03:06:08.660 --> 03:06:10.180]
It's 152 at 560 QAM

[03:06:21.460 --> 03:06:23.100]
The Middle Eastern world

[03:06:24.060 --> 03:06:25.420]
