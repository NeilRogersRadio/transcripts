[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080]
Are they you prestige?

[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.000]
Oh my!

[00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.060]
Oh my!

[00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.580]
Alright!

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.340]
Well I had a wife for a 20 month

[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.160]
Don't know what was all the fuss

[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.700]
See our marriage was fine till she caught me

[00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.840]
Cruising toys are less

[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.080]
A girl is gone

[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.140]
Oh by the way, speaking of Ronnie of Gilbert

[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:31.300]
Ronnie of

[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.080]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.360]
The girl is gone

[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.680]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.440]
Since they're waiting all I've ever heard

[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.020]
From Lisa's smile

[00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.900]
My ex was weird I'd be as like a merry couple

[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.200]
Should have sex now she's gone

[00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.720]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.320]
Now she's gone

[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.340]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.380]
My way George, muffs is your bleak idea

[00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.940]
Yeah?

[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.020]
But she hated how I liked to stay

[00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.520]
As private as I can

[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180]
Said the only bond I ever showed her

[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.120]
belonged to the other man

[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.720]
The girl is gone

[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.900]
The probe

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.520]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.740]
Almost

[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.880]
Ronnie of Gilbert cuts a crap

[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.860]
You better hear it

[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.940]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.880]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.240]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.760]
The Pressley girl is gone

[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.800]
What's the documentary on Gilbert?

[00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.540]
903

[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.780]
That would be a weiner I'll tell you that

[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.880]
903 at 560 WQM a great Friday morning

[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.420]
Nice job there Gellie on a morning show

[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.300]
So old this morning

[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.520]
Didn't hear too much of it but really

[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.480]
So I talked about that big panther six

[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.940]
To the last night

[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.680]
In Pittsburgh about Mary O'Luzon

[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.360]
I didn't see that game I was just a track

[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.520]
Make a little contribution

[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.020]
Also didn't see the Michael Jackson

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.360]
No thing which I taped

[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.420]
But I'm sure George saw the Michael Jackson

[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.240]
Peace last night

[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.980]
And look it's funny commentary about that

[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.760]
I got to tell you right now I'm sick

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.660]
And tired of people like George

[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.820]
And Joe Costello and other

[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:30.620]
I mean people

[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.240]
Making excuses about how he was beaten

[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.020]
As a child and abused and that terrible

[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.860]
Uprany and he never had a chance

[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.120]
He's a pedophile right

[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.180]
He is a freaking pedophile

[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.700]
Hey Michael

[00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.280]
You're gay

[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.400]
And a pedophile

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.040]
And a whacked job

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.200]
Well I don't know if he's doing that

[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.880]
But whatever he's doing

[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.060]
I'm not sure

[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.700]
I'm not the sheets

[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.380]
But the fact of the matter is that

[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.220]
44 year old men don't sleep with little boys

[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.900]
Okay I know that

[00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.820]
All they come along with it

[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.160]
Great shock even if you were abused as a child

[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.340]
Even if you have like certain

[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.740]
Problems with your nose which only had operated on what twice

[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.120]
Only twice and I tell you what's getting this

[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.580]
Pretty damn good surgery to make it

[00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.040]
To make your face look like that

[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.460]
When you've only had two nose jobs

[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.520]
Right well the lit a vi go and you know

[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.280]
The ongoing changes that he's experiencing

[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.940]
And he's doing it like it's having all by itself

[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.840]
Yeah

[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.000]
The skin

[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.720]
But all you bleeding hearts out there

[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960]
And in the meantime he's making millions again

[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.320]
Because the record sales are up

[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.140]
He's getting a billion dollars worth of free publicity

[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.040]
From all of this crap

[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.920]
All the time between the fact that we're getting ready to go to war any day now

[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.780]
Forget about that

[00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:29.880]
Nobody cares about that

[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.380]
Nobody even cares about the

[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.500]
Columbia anymore

[00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.580]
Finally they had the last ceremony yesterday

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.320]
And NASA is making up stories

[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.840]
But nobody cares about those things

[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.900]
Anymore all they care about is

[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.680]
Michael Jackson's backing it

[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.480]
I'm gonna go by all his records again

[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.100]
I'm not

[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.660]
And I you know I'd be the first to admit there's some of his music that I liked

[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.320]
In the olden days

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.640]
A lot

[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.860]
But what is what does that have to do with that?

[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.760]
Maybe Ted Bundy sang pretty good too you know

[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.740]
He had a record

[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.320]
Possibly

[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.600]
Maybe he had a lot of records

[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.280]
Long as your arm

[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.300]
Charles Manson record

[00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.020]
Great musician

[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.360]
Oh well I think it's a Maryland Manson

[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.100]
He was a bit of a file

[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.500]
Whatever

[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.360]
Anyway how that pull come out yesterday

[00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.820]
Pretty interesting stuff

[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.860]
Which version of Neil showed you in joy most

[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.980]
943 votes which is staggering since we had 500 votes plus on the first pull

[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.440]
What was the first pull what were we doing?

[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.840]
Uh that long ago

[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.920]
Yeah no wonder I forgot it must have

[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.940]
It wasn't we stopped doing it

[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.160]
I don't remember what that was

[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.600]
Was it I think it was yeah

[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.960]
Oh yeah that's right what's your take

[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.060]
Well sir see that was like premature anyway before that a chance to watch

[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.420]
That great ABC show last night with your favorite

[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.260]
All she didn't do the interview of the sheer guy from

[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.880]
But she was uh impenetit

[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.520]
She was impenetit

[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.100]
She was there

[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.500]
She was she was impenet

[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.860]
Anyway well what which version of Neil showed you enjoy most

[00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.260]
I don't care I'll always listen

[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.280]
466 49.4 percent

[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.980]
These maniacs these uh great friends of ours

[00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.980]
Will always listen no matter what we do here

[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.720]
Even if we just do four hours of going

[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.240]
You're gay

[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.700]
In fact, I enjoy that a lot

[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.520]
Thanks Reverend Jones you're okay too

[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.940]
You're gay

[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.680]
Unlike Gilbert

[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.540]
It turns out as a real fruit cake in more ways than one

[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.900]
Come on Gilbert

[00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.420]
Quit with the

[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.500]
Quit all that crap

[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.200]
Although I find out what speaking of fruit

[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.700]
What kind of fruit he likes you like for asberries

[00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.740]
What I'm here right

[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.820]
Anyway, uh I don't care I'll always listen

[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:17.680]
49.4 percent some bed stories a few calls which I think is why you describe it now right

[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.840]
Right um three hundred and twenty two thirty four four one percent

[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.080]
No bedtime stories all colors 99 10.4 percent

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.980]
I think that's getting a little extreme

[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.720]
All colors and no bedtime stories a little bit much

[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.780]
Maybe the colors taking themselves a little bit too seriously

[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.260]
And all bedtime stories and no calls which I did on this show for seven

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.480]
Excruciating boring months uh 56 5.9 percent not even six percent

[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.560]
And here you wanted me to go back to doing that again

[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.180]
All bedtime stories they would encourage you me to do that crap

[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.020]
Hey listen, I mean you know they're making a difference because

[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.300]
What do you get to bonus or not you never collected anyway right

[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.960]
So it really is kind of a mood point whereas on my uh you know

[00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.120]
That way don't have to answer the phone

[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.120]
Out of that nine hundred and fifty five votes there you go

[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.240]
That's the way it turned out and you know as usual we'll do whatever the hell we want anyway

[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.100]
It was well they know that

[00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.460]
They're used to that they're used to give you but at least we let them give their opinion and feel like they have some serious input into the show

[00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.080]
Like the coast when they pretend to take requests right like all those stations that pretend to take requests like magic

[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.340]
Oh, yeah, well, uh, we're even though we're computerized. It's a great coincidence that your song happened to come up this year

[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.540]
Something like that

[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.980]
Do you know that one of the rejoins they were playing?

[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.400]
Was it yesterday or on Wednesday?

[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.960]
I think on a mad dog show build me a buttercup by the foundations

[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.500]
What asshole in this building is playing and why is that in there build me a buttercup?

[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.240]
I think just to piss me off sure Robert put that in there and why are they playing all this Motown

[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:46.120]
I love it myself. I guess the mad dogs wife likes it but and the Motown too because ever since last year this is

[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.660]
Motown

[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.620]
Oh, I never thought about that

[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.800]
Well, I'll be damned so get way off those checkered pants just calm down. Oh, just relax

[00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.760]
We got a great pool for you today

[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.200]
Speaking of that

[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.420]
Won't get to it but infomercials

[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:11.020]
However, I would say that the carlis is taking all the fun out today's pool by compiling it a list of about six thousand of them here a long list

[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.700]
Even put him in alphabetical order, but they'll be calling about that

[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.320]
Of course, they'll also be calling it about Michael Jackson if you saw the thing last night, which I didn't

[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.900]
But you didn't have to see it because we've had more clips already this morning as it in of them

[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:26.460]
And there's psychoanalyzing and jack caverny on CNN. He's you know, he's spout enough a bunch of crap

[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.180]
All of an is case he happens to be right

[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.920]
What's going on son? What is there to analyze? I and the clip that they show it at kid with his head on Michael's

[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.020]
Don't hurt that yeah, no that was hands. You missed it. You looked up there holding hands holding hands in the tunnel. Yeah

[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.840]
Nothing sexual you know no, there's nothing sexual going on

[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.220]
I think it's very normal. It's run to the mill for like 44-year-old guys to be having like 10 and 12 and 13 year old boys

[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.600]
Sleeping in their bed and let me ask you why is it always little boys or sleeping in Michael's bed?

[00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:00.680]
Oh, no, sometimes it's girl ever young. It is once every five or seven like that. Yeah, they were talking about that

[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.160]
If the little boy has a sister she can come along too and watch

[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:11.200]
Ha ha ha ha and referee right I see do the play by play right to blow by blow I see

[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.540]
Jackson files complaints over TV show all we got to do the break

[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:19.860]
How can we possibly be doing a break? I just sat down here. That's because guilty went like 10 seconds over

[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:24.900]
And then he blamed us for giving Zach the guilty song. He likes the guilty song. Okay. Oh, lots of

[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.380]
He's not uptight like certain other people around here. Yeah, you know, he can laugh at himself

[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:32.800]
And when he got a voice like that thank god, he can laugh at himself. You don't think because he sounds kind of gay. Yeah

[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.000]
Nine minutes after nine not as gay as George, but screni then some gay son squeaky

[00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:49.660]
Remember squeaky from right stand that's old bad up ring. That's right. Okay. David Berkowitz. Wasn't their fault bad upbringing John Wayne Gacy

[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.760]
Bad upbringing said Bundy bad bad upbringing. He didn't oh terrible. Uh the worst

[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.740]
Ted Bundy didn't even know who his real mother was wasn't I forget how that story went down remember?

[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:06.180]
He's them all right. It's one of them

[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.580]
In fact, it was kind of a scene from passions with John on passions

[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.140]
Who thinks that graces is real mother and coming to turn out we don't even have any idea who his mama is

You follow what I'm saying. No, well you better start watching that show you'd like share it and I'll tell you

[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.460]
If Sheridan whoever that actresses, I know what her name is on passions

[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.120]
blonde I'd say like 25 to 30ish and that

[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.180]
Beautiful she could be one of the most beautiful women and I'm Tony. Does she hang them out?

[00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:36.420]
They're there out there. They're out there. They're in there. They're out there. They're bouncing around

[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.680]
Now you told me that you'd like Sheridan a lot if you told me that a long time

[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.560]
I tried telling you that but you're so anti-passion just because

[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.860]
Of a reason they

[00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:51.960]
And I don't know that you're gay. I'm a late-high social. I just hate everybody 10 past nine at five 60 WQM

That makes five straight nights

[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:45.360]
I've been here to lay

Tamp inside to his back that says kick me

[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.340]

[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:31.020]
916 at 560 wk my love the way those in real abrupt LH in every one of those ends like real right quick like that

[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:37.480]
Can you show your toes maybe jacko files complaints over tv show and a lot of wacko jacko is filing complaints or

[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.000]
Trenting to anyway, but that's part of the course you know what i'm saying

[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.140]
Anyway, michael jackson filed complaints with two tv watchdogs. There's day over controversial documentary about his life

[00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.580]
During which the king of pop revealed he sometimes lets children sleep in his bed

[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:49.180]
Oi

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.340]
And before we get back to that

[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:59.100]
Somebody faxed me this. This is kind of cute. Washington Post publishes a yearly contest in which readers are asked to supply alternate meanings for various words

[00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.760]
And i'll talk about this later, but number 13 on the list is oyster

[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:03.760]
Oy

[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.440]
A person who sprinkles his conversation with you to his expressions and

[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.140]
Oy

[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:11.500]
That would be cute. Yeah, I guess i'm an oyster

[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:13.840]
And you know what meddits said

[00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:17.940]
Yeah

[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.960]
Well see if you're gonna do that you should have it ready. We don't have time for you

[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.980]
Jackson who said he felt be trained by the terrible documentary had his lawyers filed the complaints with Britain's independent

[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:33.220]
Television commission and the broadcasting standards commission saying he'd been unfairly treated by the program and let it at least

[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.620]
$5 billion more free publicity i guess

[00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:40.300]
Huh and that would be the upside about these that done his legal team also claimed that living with michael jackson

[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:45.000]
Which was broadcast in britain on monday was an infringement of his privacy the program of course was on last night on

[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.880]
20-20 on abc i'm sure somebody out there watch it. Let's see it look at all the calls coming in about that show last night

[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.300]
That they're on fire they are on fire all the people like they want our calls on his show

[00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.420]
I don't see any coming in yet on the screenless 9 to 10 hour about michael jackson on abc last night

[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:05.220]
I'm 20-20 which i didn't see and we certainly inquiring minds want to know what you'd be thinking

[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.120]
The complaint filed with the independent television commissioner leds the documentary contains the clear-in-you window

[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.520]
That mr. Jackson is guilty of inappropriate behavior with children. Yeah

[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:21.120]
It said that shows voiceovers questions and editing gave credence to allegations made against him in 1993 of a sexual offense against the child

[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:21.600]
Yeah

[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.000]
And the complaint filed with the broadcasting standards commissioner jackson said he was not given any prior warning of the

[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.520]
narrators intent to interview him about the 93 incident or the question they'd legality of his current relationships with children

[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:34.640]
WQ I am

[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.480]
Speaking

[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.480]
Forgettleson a bit ladden forget um saddam who saying okay

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.840]
Michael Jackson is definitely the scariest person in the world

[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.660]
I would say he's pubic enemy number one

[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:52.640]
He is that this guy is just so weird and and not that i want to give him any sympathy but

[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:57.760]
He's he never had a child. How is it with it? Listen please please don't do yourself a favor

[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:00.480]
Don't repeat stuff that other people planted in your brain

[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.320]
George was doing that this morning and this is the way the public operates you're like a bunch of sheep

[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.580]
That's a bunch of crap. Okay, so we grew up in an abusive family with him miserable father

[00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:15.020]
That's not an excuse for it the guys 44 was the guys 44 years old this business about he never had a child and he's doing it now

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:15.980]
I agree

[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.040]
He's been using that line ever since the Latoya whipped out that first canceled check

[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.880]
For two three million dollars from the difference

[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.660]
It's not an excuse but it had to have led to part of what is problem

[00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.840]
He is definitely one scary screwed up human beings

[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:37.780]
Amen all right, and have a great day. Now I just I'm more not on that crap. Well, I'm missing the point

[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.040]
I'm missing the point up. He's effed up. You know something so was hit

[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.980]
Bungie after I always David Berkowitz that's up socials massive see when people are effed up to the extent that they represent a threat

[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:52.100]
To other people we have to put them away. We have to write a psychiatric

[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:58.640]
Or somewhere we have to put them in on alcatraz. We have to separate see in an island if you really want to be honest about it

[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.200]
Pedophiles are sick people so instead of just throwing her asses in jail whether it's the priest or whether it's him or whoever it is

[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.780]
They have to be put in some kind of a

[00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:09.560]
Lockbox if you point those Island way on

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.960]
That makes someone not let out. There's no cure not let out because we haven't discovered a cure for it

[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.020]
They're as of yet a cure for insanity as of yet. We haven't discovered a cure for it. Lebotany

[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:23.600]
The singer also said his own children were improperly filmed

[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.040]
He wasn't allowed to see the documentary as promised before was broadcast the watchdogs have the power to censure offending broadcast

[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:29.740]
It was in England

[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.520]
Yoddy yoddy yoddy

[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.600]
I trusted Martin Bashir to come into my life and that of my family because I wanted the truth to be told

[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:41.460]
Jackson said in the statement released by his London representative Steven Locke see I told it was a lockbox

[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:46.960]
Today I feel more betrayed than perhaps ever before that someone to go to know my children my staff and me

[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:52.880]
Who my let into my heart and told the truth could then sacrifice the trust I placed in him and produced his terrible and unfair program

[00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.280]
He said

[00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.400]
It isn't tragic that now we find out that he really did sleep with McCulloch

[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.880]
Culkin and his brother

[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.280]
Now we want now we understand why McCulloch's sulking

[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:05.960]
You know

[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.600]
WQ I am

[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:13.340]
Yes, sir. I want to stop and think I guess it was some urban hands with low boy headers here on the shoulder

[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:16.940]
Yes, but that life and Paul Ike was saying you put your head on my shoulder

[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.080]
But um, uh, that's it

[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.760]
Okay

[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:31.600]
And you and they're buying they're buying his records. That's the thing that just shocks the hell out of me

[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.320]
We can download them for free. Maybe all the pedophiles are turned on by this now

[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.920]
Oh, now we're sure we were pretty sure before but now we're absolutely sure now

[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:41.480]
We can really go out there and listen to that now they have a spokesperson

[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.060]
Maybe we can bring Vincent Price back to narrate his next album someone to justify their

[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.960]
leanens WQ I am

[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.120]

[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:02.560]
Yes, sir

[00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:08.200]
We just talked to the borderline frightening. I mean I was just absolutely you know

[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.780]
I didn't even want to my wife actually

[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.600]
There's the when she got home

[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.820]
Okay, I'm just on the couch reading something and then all of a sudden if it goes on

[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:22.360]
I'm just I dropped the newspaper I start watching this thing to this like a I mean like watching a freak show

[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:23.120]
I mean it was like

[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.380]
Caroleifies the freak show if he was

[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:34.800]
It's frightening. I mean I just couldn't believe some of the stuff that this guy is saying and all the biggest

[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.400]
The biggest lap was about the plastic surgery, you know, oh, I've never had I've never had plastic. Oh no

[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.340]
I just just two nose jobs. That's it. I believe I'm really

[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.600]
I love the breed so he could sing better. Mm-hmm. Oh, absolutely, you know

[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.860]
Unbelievable. I mean you want to sue somebody out of the plastic surgeon because if that's his idea of a nose job

[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.300]
Good luck to us and I'll tell you what I like to wait. What's his name?

[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:57.740]
What's the guy's name Martin?

[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:02.800]
Bashir. Bashir. He did a great job. He was there was no stuck-up softball stuff

[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.620]
I mean he really

[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.380]
Pind him against the wall. Well, I got it on tape. I'm gonna watch it as soon as I go home this afternoon

[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:12.060]
You want to watch it? He did a good job. I mean it's sometimes it looked like it was a little bit of softball

[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.820]
Caught him but boy he and then the last interview down in Miami and he really

[00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.760]
Pind him against the wall on the on the children's stuff. I'm sorry the children's stuff

[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.600]
Very good. Did a great job. Okay. Thanks to the good areas. In fact, I'm gonna leave right now

[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.880]
I'm gonna go home and watch it. See you. Thanks. That can't I leave now kind of getting early pass all

[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:36.240]
We got to eat probably got to get some food in here. Zach didn't get any food. Don't do what? The food. Are you crazy?

[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.580]
I've been complaining all week about the amount of food coming in here. See when you want food in here

[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.140]
Then it's another story about I see

[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:45.560]
I see a lot of these and Carlos has nothing to do with it. Carlos is gonna hate you like poison. Oh, I know that. I went in the

[00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.120]
I mean take a leak this morning. He was in the sink and he would I could hear him.

[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:52.760]
George sucks. George sucks. I could hear a little voice coming out of the sink. George sucks. That's what he was saying

[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.520]
Maybe he's the result of that pull on Wednesday, but at any rate

[00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:02.340]
Now we'll get whatever the hell we want to get. I don't have to get permission from you. Who now? Are you like my grandpa grandma?

[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.660]
Yeah, 60 years. I've already got one mother who treats me around five years old

[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.180]
I don't need a surrogate mother. Okay, I already got one. You mean the one that's a fortunate egg

[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.300]
Nagging mother with a paprika and pepper. Yeah, Lardo right

[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.260]
Jackass

[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.300]
And by the way

[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:26.960]
Case everybody forgot George. You're gay. Some people wish. Oh, so anyway, we're gonna do the I don't know how we're gonna do that though

[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.020]
Well, when we get through with Michael Jackson will do the thing about the infomercials because on Friday

[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.360]
We don't have to feel rushed to get the new pull up there

[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.420]
Because they got all weekend to dittle with it and this one. I don't know

[00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:38.720]
That's just for fun. What's your favorite TV infomercial?

[00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.500]
And I realize it may sound like a freaky question

[00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:46.280]
But the fact of the matter is there are freaky people like me and Carlos in here who I actually find

[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.740]
Informersholes entertaining. Do you know that if it's really desperate like on a weekend?

[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:55.740]
And I see just less like when a godfather comes on and you can't turn it off and you watch it even though you've seen a hundred times

[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.520]
Same with it like the Rampo Peele Showtime the rotisserie oven

[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:07.240]
Right am I right? Can't turn it off. Okay, especially like the part where he takes the hammer and slanzer and they're oh

[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.120]
They all go like that now

[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.400]
Either those people are all getting paid off which is likely or they're all getting the free rotisserie oven

[00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:18.900]
Which is also likely or they're all on magic mushrooms which is most likely they get paid and lunch

[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:25.840]
Oh free lunch I knew a match can you imagine if Ron would start taping those infomercials down here like it cemetery village

[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.280]
Dick Feinberg at Pompa no Park could turn him out of how if he gave him a free spaghetti dinner

[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:33.380]
Those people would all get up and start. Ah it's the greatest invention. They even had an Edison movie proud

[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:38.320]
They'd be foaming at them off we're knocking each other down to get to the free food and make their statements

[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.860]
I'm sure there are more people like you and Carlos

[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:42.640]
Oh

[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:46.720]
Well if there weren't they wouldn't be putting those damn things on there and I confess I did buy the juicy man

[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:51.320]
See back in the days of early satellite TV when I had my first dish back 16 years ago

[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.660]
There used to be I mean the stuff on that doesn't come close to those things

[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.760]
There used to be really great

[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.640]
Infomercials that would go on forever

[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:06.680]
And I bought my first Vitamix blender was like a steel blender. I remember that yeah Vitamix through a thing to an

[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.920]
Infomercial it was it was okay. I used it for about a month or two and then I shmip candid

[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.160]
Actually, I never throw them out. They're all wide open the kitchen cupboards, you know

[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:22.380]
And then of course I bought the juicy man's juicer. Yeah broke the second time I used it

[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:26.380]
And then I started but I did start growing big bushy eyebrows after I used that

[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:31.840]
From the juicy man. What's his name? I can almost think of his name J J

[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.600]
Cordic cortic

[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.420]
I think the juicy man who's actually only 25 but looks 116 because he's been juicing it too much

[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:48.020]
It got to it doesn't I just told you what it is. It's say cordic cordic god damn Carlos quick picking on George

[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:50.240]
Although he can't do anything for you

[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:54.520]
In fact, I'd be honest with you. I think so where we get look for I don't think anybody can do anything

[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.840]
We're all that was difficult that was hey, I did my best your fault crap get some stuff from Tony's near

[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:06.580]
We haven't bugbed Brad in a long time although what time do they open they don't only

[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:11.200]
Call it until they do open now. We want that stuff in here early so we can eat all through the show today

[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.920]
We all didn't use that we ought to do a pull on that sometime

[00:23:15.140 --> 00:23:16.200]
What are you laughing about?

[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:20.800]
Well, if the audience doesn't like it if it's resounding enough we'll stop eating on here, won't we?

[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:25.700]
Plus when I'm not here I don't eat on the air anyway when I'm out of town somebody's well-makeup for last time while I'm here

[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.960]
Right nobody's gonna bring me food and Toronto then if they duck up if they did let me go

[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:35.200]

[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:04.560]
QAM

[00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:08.640]
Why are you bastards

[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:16.560]
20 single women looking for love travel to her remote chateau in France where they will meet him

[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:22.940]
They know he's handsome they know he's sophisticated and they know he's worth 80 million dollars

I'm 33

[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.340]
At 560 WQM. This is disturbing from the Brit paper the Guardian this morning somebody thanks this to me

[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.540]
Thank you so much UK word dossier sham say experts

[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.860]
British intelligence lifted from academic circles

[00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:13.920]
Articles rather down a street was last night punched in a cute international embarrassment after it emerged at large parts of the British government's latest

[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:20.480]
dossier on Iraq allegedly based on intelligence material were taken from published academic articles some of them several years old a

[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:27.540]
Amid charges of scandalous plagiarism on the night when Tony Blair attempted to rally support for the US live campaign against Sodom

[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:33.520]
Hussein Whitehall's dismay was compounded by the knowledge that the disputed document was singled out for praise by the West Secretary of State

[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:36.580]
Cole and Powell in his speech to the one security council on Wednesday

[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.620]
citing the British dossier entitled a rack its infrastructure concealment deception and intimidation in front of a worldwide

[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:49.100]
Autelpage not ins Mr. Powell said I would call my colleagues attention to find paper that the United Kingdom distributed which describes an

[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:56.340]
Exquisite detail Iraqi deception activities, but on Channel 4 news that Channel 4 in England last night was revealed that four of the reports

[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:02.440]
19 pages have been copied with only minor editing and a few insertions from the internet version of an article by Abraham

[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:06.460]
Almorashi which appeared in the Middle East Review of International Affairs last September

[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.040]
How do you like that? I'm not going to read the whole thing, but

[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.780]
In fact, we probably ought to put this on the website

[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.320]
And Carlos has hopped right on it, but it just so much crap going on, you know what?

[00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:20.980]
We'll get to our poll eventually, but there's a lot of crap for example speaking of pedophiles

[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:27.860]
A Georgia priest has been given 10 years in prison a 10 year prison sentence for a sexly abusing two-month gumbry county brothers in the early 1970s

[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:28.840]
This in Rockville, Maryland

[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.220]
Whalen Brown apologized to his victims during his sentencing yesterday saying he wished there was something to do to ease their pain

[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:39.640]
He had already pleaded guilty of abuse which took place while he was studying at a Washington seminary

[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.640]
Brown later became a priest in Savannah, but it hasn't worked in the church since 88

[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.660]
One of the brothers testified at Brown's hearing in Rockville yesterday that the abuse had ruined his life and made him consider suicide

[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:53.680]
An Oklahoma man testified that Brown also abused him during the 70s while he was a boy in Georgia

[00:27:53.680 --> 00:28:00.080]
The man said Brown took him to Walt Disney World and made sexual advances to him during the trip just another isolated incident

[00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.180]
What are so many of these things, you know, nuclear bomb hoax

[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.100]
From yellow times.com.org

[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:14.000]
In a speech in front of the UN Security Council February 5, 2003

[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.120]
Cole and Powell did not offer any viable new evidence concerning a rack's nuclear weapon capability

[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:22.740]
That Bush and his entourage continued to wave as a red flag in front of the eyes of the American people to incite them

[00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.660]
Shamedfully into one unjust war on the contrary

[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:30.660]
The few flimsies so-called pieces of evidence that were presented by Powell regarding a supposed continued Iraqi nuclear weapon program

[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:35.540]
Serve only to weaken the American British accusations and reveal their untenable attempt to cover with a fig leaf

[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:41.240]
Their threadbar arguments and misinformation campaign the false and untrue pieces of evidence follow when it goes on for example

[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:46.960]
Powell in a theoretical query asked why the Iraqi scientists were asked to sign declarations with the death penalty

[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.240]
If not adhered to not to reveal their secrets to the iAEA inspection teams exactly the opposite is true

[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:57.940]
The four or five is that recall such declarations which are written to tell held us to the penalty of death in the event that we did not

[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.000]
Hand in all the sensitive documents and reports that may still be in our possession

[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:04.300]
This is written by a former Iraqi nuclear scientist

[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:10.000]
Imhan Kaduri had Powell's intelligence services provided him with a copy of these declarations and not dependent on the

[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.280]
Fectors testimonies who are solely motivated by their self promotion in the eyes of their beholders and

[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.660]
Available to a good Arabic translation about these declarations exactly said he would not

[00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:24.240]
Had he had any sense been abiding by the truth mentioned this is evidence and it goes on we'll also put this one on there too

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.940]
Okay, I want to overwork your near Carlos

[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:29.500]
But there's some pretty damn good stuff and obviously I don't want to sit here and read the whole thing

[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.540]
Because the public's convinced out there anyway. They bought it lock stock and viral right

[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.260]
And the fact that the polls say yada yada whatever the polls say that's what it's all about

[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:41.460]
We're gonna go in here and kick some ass, baby. I would say this though

[00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:50.720]
This from MSNBC's website the state department warned americans have brought yesterday of the threat of new terrorists attacks using chemical or biological weapons

[00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:58.240]
The worldwide alert came as US security officials told NBC news that they were considering raising the assessment of the threat of terrorist attacks

[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.740]
Two are you ready for this?

[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:00.780]
Orange

[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:06.880]
It's second highest level setting intelligence indications for plans of a major attack as early as next week

[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:12.160]
The threat assessment has been at the third or five levels yellow were elevated since September 24

[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:19.660]
The assessment was last at orange or high for two weeks beginning September 10 that they before the first anniversary of 9-11 attacks in New York and Washington DC

[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:26.600]
US officials said at the time that two captured members of Osama bin Laden's El-Katatari network had told interrogators of specific plans to carry out new attacks

[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:33.620]
Homeland security department official told NBC newspeak Williams yesterday that the level of concern without its high sense the 9-11 attacks

[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:39.500]
administration officials said they were reassessing the threat level one day at a time as the US moved closer to taking military action against

[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.980]
Sodom who sandwiched critics contend would inflame US sentiment among Muslims worldwide

[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:51.780]
Defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld dismissed talk that new attacks could be tied specifically to action in Iraq

[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:56.920]
It doesn't take an attack on a rack to unleash an attack a terrorist attack on the US. They've already done it rumsfield said

[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.360]
What do you think 9-11 was but

[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:05.980]
But a senior Bush administration official told NBC news that US intelligence have been intercepting a steadily rising number of conversations

[00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:11.180]
Among suspected members and sympathizers of El-Katat the new intelligence some of which was described as very general

[00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:17.200]
Suggested that the possibility of attacks around the world was higher now another concern is the arrival next week of Hodge

[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.960]
H.A.J.J

[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:24.600]
The week long period each year when observant Muslims make a pilgrimage to the Holy City of Mech in Saudi Arabia

[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:30.740]
US officials said the official told NBC news that intelligence had picked up discussions of possible attacks around the Hodge

[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.500]
While other official said extremists could be motivated by renewed religious fervor to launch more attacks. I just mentioned that in passing

[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.160]
Because we're not going to change anybody's mind

[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:42.220]
And

[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:45.020]
Dustin Hoffman blast to a ministration over Iraq

[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.040]
What the hell does he know?

[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.180]
I don't know he's a very good driver

[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:52.640]
Excellent

[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.140]
to ask her when a double Oscar winner Dustin Hoffman accused US president George W. Bush administration

[00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:02.540]
manipulating the grief of the country post 9-11 to win backing for possible were the rack

[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:08.280]
Hoffman speaking as he picked up the lifetime achievement prize at the Empire of magazine film awards in central London

[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.700]
Added to the believed America's motives for going to war included power and oil

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.000]
Huh for me as an American the most painful aspect of this is that I believe the administration has taken the events of 9-11

[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.460]
And many related the grief of the country. I think that's reprehensible Hoffman said the act you read it

[00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:25.200]
I believe though I may be wrong because I'm no expert that this was about what most wars are about

[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.400]
H.A.J.M.E. power money and oil

Jane Fonda who we know has got a lot of credibility

[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:48.180]
But actor Tom Cruise was very very macho and definitely not gay who start alongside Hoffman and rainman has come out and support the US president

[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.100]
Which is a very it's the macho thing to do right?

[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.060]

Am I sorry about it not really here's a couple of factors from one of our chronic factors

[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:54.940]
It's said the one for the and where the hell did he go he's the infomercial queen. I mean expert

[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:01.560]
Where how the Carlos go maybe to smoke or pee no he he can't smoke during the show when he's in volume

[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.900]
I mean when he's not involved which is most of the time anything meaningful. That's okay

[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.580]
He can't smoke or pee

[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.740]
The one for the shirt folder the one where you place the shirt on a little cardboard or plastic folding thing in a flip it toward the middle and a

[00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:15.320]
Folded shirt perfectly. I've seen that all right. That's on

[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:19.160]
Okay, then the sure is listening. He can just stick it out there

[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:26.580]
What does he know also what says like the small handy 600 one vacuum cleaner picks up nuts and bolts and everything else are floating

[00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:30.060]
Bullying balls and dildos. I got one at brands mark mines called the shark

[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:36.840]
The shark vacuum I guess I don't know and of course he's he's not here. He's out sticking around somewhere

[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:41.980]
So we don't know since he since this is his one area of expertise that we finally found is TV infomercials

[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:43.800]
And he's out diddling around with his shark

[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:50.460]
He's squeezing it didn't say where he was going. He just up and left. What's your favorite TV infomercial we ask today?

Plus did you see Michael Jackson last night because I didn't and George didn't he said the oh he went to get the male

[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.780]
I say he went to get the very important male. Isn't our male important? No, no, no

[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:02.860]
We need you in here. We don't need you to slap it around getting the goddamn male, okay?

[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.000]
We need you in here to tell us about the shark a little vacuum whatever

[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.840]

Haven't you ever seen that one the space saver? This is very good the space saver

[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:31.380]
Where you take your huge big fluffy pillows and you put them in his plastic and a plastic

[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:08.300]
43 people say I hate all-in commercials. That's bad. How could you say that?

[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:14.700]
That's probably because they never saw a good one or because they don't have the patience to sit through and realize that a lot of those over

[00:48:14.700 --> 00:48:18.600]
You're entertaining even though you would never ever well you never know if you get hooked

[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.560]
Maybe that's what they're afraid of that they're gonna get hooked and they're gonna actually wind up making these

[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:25.780]
17 easy payments of only 49 99 each things like that

See of course when you watch the girls gone wild you can go pocket fishing at the same time

[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:54.200]
No question about that and maybe get hooked on it now. Let me ask you this

[00:48:55.060 --> 00:49:00.200]
The pocket fisherman is that also referred to as a machine. Oh, and guess what how could we forget?

[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.680]

Maybe they don't have cable that maybe they don't have a TV

[00:49:31.420 --> 00:49:35.940]
Look if they got a pop-up toaster that's all they need it. They're so frequent. They're all in a place

[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:39.400]
You're surrounded by them. You're living under the overrowning in a sea of infomercials

Michael Jackson the freak friend or foe that's our pull that's our honor question today

[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:54.600]
George says he was had a bad childhood a bad upbringing and so that's a good excuse for why he's molesting all these little boys

[00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.380]
Everything that's what you said and that's what Joe Castello called you and also said

[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:04.300]
Is that he called? No, he was talking about it on the air Carlos heard it. Oh, you're confused and he said what?

[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.000]
What did he say with reasons

[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:11.280]
But he feels sorry for him and I don't he's not a pedophile and uh, he's the wait wait

[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:14.080]
You know something I feel sorry for us

[00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:19.980]
Because Joe before he got married used to be a really good guy. He was our good friend now all I can say is

[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.740]
He's an asshole. He goes on the air is belly-hacking about my picking on old people

[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:28.600]
You can't do that because we're all gonna get old. He's become a goody too. She was no wonder the numbers are in the tank

[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.780]
No wonder Moe is bitching about having no leading

[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:31.800]

[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.180]
You think we got a badly now you'd like to follow that

[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.780]
To desperate guy. I mean Joe just got married. I guess it the thrill is long gone by now like Michael would say the thrill is gone

[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.960]
Huh, nobody would say

[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:48.020]
But I mean to be defending him and say he's not a pedophile

[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.800]
based on what

[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:51.260]
uh

[00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:54.060]

Talk about Monday what made him so goofy or sociopathic yeah

[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:16.860]
Uh, he was born to a girl that was you know barely pubes and and he was raised with the impression that his mother was actually a sister

[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.760]
Right, that's right

[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.500]
Five grand more right

[00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:22.220]
But uh in terms of

[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:26.680]
Infomercials could you play vagimatic at some point okay?

[00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.100]
You got it

[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:30.380]

Yeah, he don't like the articles. I guess he doesn't like the content

[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:52.080]
And the answer is no I'll read whatever the hell I want to read okay. What's he had what's he had nothing for us

[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.460]
He had stopped reading please he's got nothing to say look

[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.520]
If I thought I could sit here and take eight million phone calls all day whether they were good batter and different

[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.100]
It wouldn't be any problem. I never read anything

[00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:04.080]
But uh, it's the same old Neil begs for calls. That's what you want

[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:09.820]
Don't do me any fun to sit here and read and feel like I have to read a mile a minute because I don't want to put everybody into a coma

[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:15.740]
But there's some things that need to be read as opposed to just the usual spoon fed propaganda that the public sucks up

[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:21.000]
Oh, we'd like you so much when you're just doing fun and games because once you start with your liberal

[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:27.340]
Yeah, right with a few points that you don't want to be expressed on the airways of America. We don't understand that don't we? Yes. Yes, we do

[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.680]
Oh, and I didn't put you down and he said but you know what take that diary and stuff it up your ass. Okay pal

[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:39.020]
We don't pander to anybody on the show because if we did believe me the nature of this program would be a lot different

[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.740]
I'd become real heterosexual overnight guaranteed

[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.820]
I'd be talking about boobs and butts and boyking and whatever the hell a hot time up can said

[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:54.980]

Let me ask you something if he had that bad upbringing and bad childhood

[00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.860]
Which is the reason he's still living his childhood and don't understand that everything how come back then

Is that what it is? It was like on time delay. It was always after excuse maker. It was on time. I was making it

[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.320]

See, I have no shame. I mean, that's why I'm working here. I have no shame

[01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.880]
So I'm not embarrassed to tell you that I bought the Carlton Sheets thing a long time ago when I was a schlepper

Sheets on your bed sheets in the closet. What the uh don't look pretty

[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.700]
Money making. I never got that one yet. That's why he's living under the overpass

[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:45.240]
Oh, you mean Carlos yeah, he's still living under the overpass, but he does get his mailer and that's a good thing

[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.360]
Now it does get it does get blown away on a windy day. That's the unfortunate part of it

[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.460]
But he does get his mail it's called a mail drop

[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.040]
They just drop it like right next to his burlap sack

[01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:58.420]
5 6 7 0 5 60 here's a call from hi alia. Hello

[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:03.660]
The buying mail. Yes, sir. Oh, well, you know the showtime rotisserie girl has two versions

[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:08.340]
There's a cross-anating which is Judy right and then there's the girl from the loveboat

[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:12.660]
So there's two different versions that I one there's several different ones. There's the new slightly smaller one

[01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:17.580]
Have you seen that one? I've seen I want to when I was when I was only 18 payments of 129 99

[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:22.000]
Even if I'm even if I'm watching anything else and I see that I'll stop and watch it

[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.380]
But my favorite one. I don't know if you've seen it. It's the jack-la-lane juicer. Oh, yeah

[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.000]
He looks like he's 900 years old like why would I want to buy that juicer? So he can look just like him

[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.700]
And he's still wearing the same outfit from the 50s or the six exactly

[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.780]
What a trip. All right, Neil. Thank you very much. Okay, squeeze it hard

[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.660]
He's squeezing it on the jack-la-lane juicer

[01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:47.340]
I guess that's if you're gonna do one of those juicers the idea is to take these real old guys and look at this

[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.720]
I'm still alive because I'm the juicy man. I'm drinking all this juice

[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.620]
I'm I'm busy juicing all day long. I'm squeezing it

[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.480]
But the fact that a matter like he says is who would want to look like that?

[01:03:56.780 --> 01:04:03.400]
Who would want to look like most of the people in the infomercials like fat Tony like male like that red necky broad with her thunder stick

[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.100]
I don't even know where she's sticking that thing

[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.260]
I can only speculate. It's a cause thunder. I guess thunder

[01:04:11.220 --> 01:04:13.580]
That's it the um what you call it

[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:14.060]

For more than a minute second would you would anybody? I said won't allow that much hair to come on

[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:50.280]
Let's it blocks it out. There ought to be a chair

[01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:54.720]
So you've seen that and say penis extender and how to now that I think about it. How does that work?

[01:05:55.400 --> 01:06:01.560]
It's a medicine. Oh, it's a medicine. It's another damn pill. It's like vagra light or vagra intense or whatever

[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:07.100]
Ron Jeremy. Hey one day you can look just as good as Ron and maybe you can be double-jointed too, but I doubt it

[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.800]
You can be a human furball like Ron. Remember that day that he was in here?

[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:17.560]
I'm trying to and the way that some of the people in this building were carrying on I mean why I don't know why I don't know

[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.160]
I don't get it. I don't understand it. Maybe they don't understand if Peter North was in a building

[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:25.360]
Maybe a few years ago before he got to be 90 or if like Bambi Woods or one of those people was in a building

[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:27.620]
But Ron Jerry oh

[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:33.140]
And when I told him that right to his ugly pussy got he was actually legitimately offended. He was he was offended

[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.560]
I'm fat. Yeah, you're a fat and very

[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.620]
I don't understand like like Julio now. We like Julio engineer Julio a lot. He's a great guy

[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:41.320]
But he's a fat tub

[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:45.520]
He's not pleasingly pump. He's a fat tub. He's huge

[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:49.460]
This doesn't make him a bad guy, but he gets he's not that

[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:56.100]
Carly's leading on the door believe me. It'll take a lot more than you to keep him out of there and he's got the key

[01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:03.360]
So why is it that so many fat people like like oh? You don't say that I'm pleasantly pumped. No, you're not you're a big tub run

[01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:06.840]
Ron freaking Jeremy man good god

[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:12.960]
Put more and put your clothes back on the more you take off the more nauseous we get and what was bigger his gut or his ego

[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.080]
no contest

[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:16.500]
ego

[01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:18.460]
massive ego

[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.880]
But he's a close friend of a good buddy of yours 26 past 10 at 560 WDQ

[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:26.500]
I mean you can use both their apartments someday. Okay. Use the apartment

[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.880]
I'll tell you a great place who's also a good friend of others people is

[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]
Jeff Cohen

[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:35.820]
And then interesting how this I've pointed that over the years right sooner or later all the pieces of the puzzle

[01:07:35.820 --> 01:07:37.000]
They fit together, you know

[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:40.780]
And they are right here Jeff Cohen a really wild and woolly guy

[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:43.920]
He's got two fantastic restaurants in Broward County the pizza loft

[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.560]
There's the original Broward location. That's on university driving between Griffith and 595 right behind

[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:52.900]
Pier 1 imports and they big pizza loft plaza with about six million acres of free parking

[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:57.820]
Right kitty corn of the ermidocafe and then you got the brand new pizza loft in plantation

[01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.640]
And boy did we ever need something really good

[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:04.060]
Out there because it's really sparse for that kind of a restaurant anywhere in West Broward

[01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:09.960]
And they're on a corner of Navhilins Sunrise right behind Walgreens both restaurants featuring the same delicious Italian goodies

[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.120]
Everything is cooked fresh made to order nothing is pre-fat no crap

[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:16.660]
They got three different kinds of great pizza the best garlic rolls I guarantee you've ever had in your

[01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:21.860]
Our life and they got chicken and veal and seafood and they got calzone super subs and lots more too

[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.280]
Like I said prices are always very reasonable so you in a whole family can eat as often as you want

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.940]
If you want to take out our delivery or catering they do that too in

[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:37.740]
Davie call this number 954 916 888 954 916 888 and of course implantation 382

[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:43.260]
1999 954 382 1999 and whatever you do make it a resolution it's February already

[01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:48.400]
But not too late to make a resolution in order to make up for the fact that rumors gonna get to 400% discount now

[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:53.220]
We don't give you a look at how we damn well get the matter up

[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:55.120]
I'm making sure that you're not gonna get that free lunch

[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:59.940]
So order a compensate for the fact that the rumors are gonna be in there for free eat more often unusual like 10

[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:03.120]
20 30 times a week at the world famous pizza lot both locations

[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.860]
And look

[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.900]
Put the door

[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:27.480]
Oh

[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:28.780]
No more

[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:36.440]
I got enough I gotta think about on top of getting right there and I don't need a rating that's a minus eight

[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:43.660]
A russian guts to go

[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.440]
There's a lot of fat producers you know

[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:47.680]
You

[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:58.360]
Oh

[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:03.340]
Right all that blah blah I don't understand how you can eat from a trough while using both the

[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.520]
You just like clippin it's all your

[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.360]
Straight dip that ass out

[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:14.400]
That's right

[01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:32.380]
Oh

[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.240]
10 32 5 60 W and he held me to good show this morning

[01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:49.900]
Mo was out his dog I guess is sick or something and the guilty was on their loan did a pretty interesting show

[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.220]
All that beat had a very great ambiance here this morning

[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:56.000]
Ordus Clarence was near monitoring the show is pretty interesting

[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.480]
Uh paul says don't forget the flowbie haircutting system

[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.200]
Well, we didn't probably just mention it like about 10 seconds ago

[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:03.440]
He probably won't pay too much attention

[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:07.080]
They even vocus says how about the information running now for the pasta cooker

[01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:09.160]
Yeah, this is heavy duty now. It's all over the place

[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:13.880]
The pan with the holes in lid that you turn the lid and it locks in place

[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:15.540]
So you go pour the water out

[01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:19.280]
It says this one's funny because they have these retards pouring water from regular pans

[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.060]
And dumps spaghetti in the sink like idiots

[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:23.020]
They show all these clumsy assholes

[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.920]
splattering and burning and

[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.940]
poaching and oyster ring got forbid you should use a colander

[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:30.700]
Yeah, a colander

[01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:35.260]
They actually have such a thing and David Vocus says they're stupid

[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:39.680]
Yeah, is it really that hard to drain drain spaghetti? I don't think so

[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.420]
David Vocus at the end of his fax he says

[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:44.000]
Don't don't worry pretty said

[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.260]
Here's one that says is miscleo the psychic considering infomercial you bet

[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:55.260]
It sure was gotta get miscleo on there even though it may not the doesn't have to be one of son right now and another good one

[01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:01.860]
The blue blockers sunglasses with the fat wrapper the blue blockers the blue blockers

Now that's what is that oh yeah, that's the one where you like that would be perfect for me for my grilled cheese sandwiches

[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:17.180]
Oh, that's triangular

[01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:21.940]
Cook or thing that's right that's been a long time back. We have a good memory for that

[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.080]
And that was a pretty good thing it looked like

[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:29.560]
Yeah, what is the the grilled the grilled part of it was like a like a grill off a lion like a portable waffle iron

[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:36.080]
And you just it folded over so you can make like grilled cheese sandwiches on there or whatever is that the name of it snack master?

[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:40.600]
The snack master very good. Thank you so much also country western's 160 greatest hits

[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:47.000]
Well, can you imagine how much picking and guinea you could do 160 greatest hits you could pick until your brain bled

[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:49.360]
I

[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:54.560]
Mean you don't have to put these under necessarily the snack master probably does in addition which most of the people hate these all anyway

[01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:56.300]
Which is why we ought to be doing this

[01:12:57.260 --> 01:12:59.040]
We're asking today what's your favorite

[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:06.960]
TV uh, informational assuming now we could ask which one do you hate the most or is the most annoying but we don't want to be so negative

[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:13.660]
Do we always accuse me of being negative right? I try to be a little positive and I still think that a lot of them are very entertaining

[01:13:13.660 --> 01:13:19.460]
Especially compared to so much of the crap that's on round the clock crap turn on the cable crap

[01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:23.640]
You turn on satellite number one more crap satellite too. I mean you can smell it

[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.180]
Like yeah, you know like your TV set not to be sitting in a septic tank. It's surrounded by so much crap

[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:34.340]
So you get a good informational understanding this is a pretty interesting they could be playing along. I'm playing along

[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.560]
I don't watch these things

[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.620]

[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:03.560]

Yeah, and the other one that he does it that we can't share that we can't see on a year right figures

[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:33.700]
Figures that somebody like you with those stick glasses who just has no life whatsoever needs constant never ending attention

[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.780]
Would be the one. It's like constantly incestantly bugging a crap out of the people on the phone here

[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.980]
Yeah back to you like those dust by the way really

[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:45.260]
Round of clock. Well in the clock nine stop round the clock. Thank you

[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.040]

Oh, I love them eddy K everybody and that's your fault you do understand. Oh, yeah, because you won't put them on the ear

[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:58.240]
That's right even though you keep telling me to yeah, I want to talk to Gilbert come on Gilbert. Everything is okay

[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.000]
Wow

[01:14:59.000 --> 01:14:59.620]
Wow

[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:09.420]
Schmuck here's a lady in sunrise. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes, ma'am. I heard something that was disturbing from CNN news

[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:15.080]
Yeah, they want to have a portable creamatoriums for the military. Yeah, that's on our website. We put that

[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:20.940]
Sorry, that's okay. I have the pasta perfect and it works for all foods that you have to boil and hot water

[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:26.480]
It works excellent. I like it. So in other words a calendar doesn't get the job then all I guess there are other things

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:31.420]
You could boil it wouldn't be like working a calendar so good. Yeah, you get two sizes of small and medium

[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:35.220]
But it does work. I think it's probably over price though. How much was it?

[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:36.800]
Mine was like $29

[01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:38.460]
$29

[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.940]
I guarantee one of those plastic calendars which I have one at home. I have one in my apartment in Toronto

[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:46.580]
I have one even and I'm stood on uh, they probably cost like a what buck 98

[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:54.540]
Yeah, I have those too, but you got a cheese grater with it. Oh, well, if I knew that I'll get to thanks a lot. Okay, it sounds really great

[01:15:55.780 --> 01:16:02.380]
See, I mean look those things wouldn't be on there unless suckers like us were buying them hand over fist. Okay, they're on there because it's on television

[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:07.780]
And no matter how much we know we're getting con it slides like all these people with their newsletters

[01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:15.740]
The financial newsletter even Dr. Bob Arnet who is now no longer Dr. Bob and now an international expert on everything from aviation to world affairs

[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.560]
He had a newsletter on health. It was crap

[01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:26.800]
Not that these people would exploit the fact that they're on television for fun and profit to try to suck the blood money out of all of us suckers out there

[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.760]
But they do they do I wish I could think of that Steve Garvey one

[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.820]
Because that really fries my ass. Oh, and they're showing all these people shoveling. You know what it looked like?

[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.300]
What what the hell is that the REM song?

[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:45.320]
Give me hints. They're the most recent the big hit they hit last year that was playing all the time

[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:49.540]
Were they really religion? No, I don't lose. That was last year losing my

[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:52.000]
religion what is wrong with this man to this man again

[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.000]
But anyway, they're all sitting and they're any happy people

[01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:02.880]
But it reminds me and all these people are sitting around there and an outdoor barbecue and they shove it all this big thick juicy

[01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:09.520]
Cheeseburgers with big buns and fries greasy fries and you can eat all of these things and watch the pounds pour off your body

[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:15.240]
And there's Steve Garvey one of the most boring people on the face of the earth. It's not like the turbo cooker. Is it?

[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:17.820]
The air cooking thing

[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:21.540]
They're pills. What did I just say they're pills to lose weight

[01:17:21.540 --> 01:17:25.800]
What is the turbo cooker got to do with losing weight french fries you mentioned french fries now

[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.780]
No, the idea is that you can eat all these things and still lose weight by popping these pills

[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:34.460]
And then the other pill is the exercise in the bottle for those of you who are too lazy to exercise former

[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:39.520]
And that's it and former did somebody call with that or do you know he found it? The informer. Oh, yeah

[01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:43.260]
I want to inform you that those people are mostly in jail at this point

[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:48.820]
And then Tom Bosley was on one where he was peddling some crap, but I remember what it was and he

[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.740]
He there's like a ten minute disclaimer in the beginning but well

[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:56.400]
He's got to protect his reputation and you know him from happy days and

[01:17:56.820 --> 01:18:02.160]
You know how he wouldn't endorse anything unless it was really the emis and then he goes on to some scam

[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.280]
I don't know what it is some crap

[01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:09.640]

Are they telling us why uh? No anything specific no, they never do that

[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.320]
But it's high

[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.080]
I'll start getting more nerfs

[01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:58.980]
Here's the facts about Jeff rumor

[01:23:00.520 --> 01:23:04.380]
From George and Montreal who says listening online and Montreal go to Florida every winter

[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:10.100]

And it's very and I'm gonna save this as rumor about this next time we have free meals at the pizza lot

[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:21.800]
Remember was just as annoying in Montreal as he is in Florida. They says George from Montreal

[01:23:21.800 --> 01:23:26.920]
George is laughing real hard rumor. I wonder he hates you like for you. Oh, to send Peter card if it's free

[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:30.660]
It's me. No, maybe that's why I wonder if he was a freeloader in Montreal. Well

[01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:36.960]
Yeah, this is a new thing for silly thing to ask Steve Garvey discusses being sued for infomercial selling weight law system

[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.620]

This is about 85 pages that are not so good friend Dave Jeff Heiss neighbor sent me with a whole interview about to Steve Garvey

[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:46.540]

It's such a good day. Yeah

[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:57.620]
Well, he's probably guarding the place because we got that orange alert now

[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:01.380]
Don't anybody get nervous now. We've been on orange alert before and

[01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:07.220]
Work this still spinning around talk about how difficult was it going to be to come from orange back down to yellow

[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:10.220]
Yeah, how difficult is that gonna be you know how we're gonna survive with us

[01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:16.700]
What level of hysteria are we supposed to I wish they would tell us just how hysterical we need to be and how many hours per day

[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:20.280]
We have to hide under the bed. I think we should be hysterical enough to go home

[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:23.580]
Okay, well right after lunch. I was

[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:26.840]

[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.640]
What's your favorite TV infomercial we're asking today?

[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:40.160]
And I guess the Michael Jackson thing last night, although I'm sure many many people saw it

[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:41.900]
What is there to say besides Georgian?

[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:47.840]
Joe Castell defending him on the grounds that he was confused and abused and keep lying you said it

[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:49.880]
I wasn't defending him. What do you keep doing?

[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:55.620]
You rationalizing his ever-in-one self-discipline behavior. Okay, and I think they know every move that they're making from hanging it

[01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:56.700]
Kid over to balcony

[01:24:58.740 --> 01:25:04.200]
And just no just watching it look at the result CD and record sales are booming now

[01:25:04.660 --> 01:25:08.740]
Not just in Britain but around the world rationalize millions of dollars worth of free publicity

[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.840]
He's been doing it for years now for decades

[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:18.600]
Just like Madonna every slutty thing she does the media hops on it and the story too. Yeah, I don't think she's a crazy person

[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:28.100]
Well, he's a next boy. Do you know it's a good thing to do this thing about TV infomercials because television is the greatest conduit if I can say that for peddling crap

[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.660]
Bolshevik to the public take a look at what's going on with this a war war about to embark on huh?

[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:52.260]
And said ever and so on and now he's got everybody in the Democrats all ruled over like dominoes a domino park and that's the end of that we're going in

[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:54.960]
And I don't mind going in if

[01:25:55.540 --> 01:26:01.200]
If everything goes according to oil do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, that's the question that it would be really nice if we could eliminate him

[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.900]
Although be nice if we didn't have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to do it

[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:10.900]
That would be even nicer to eliminate one man in his immediate son and a few other. Yeah, yeah can't do it

[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:15.560]
I got news for you. Why don't we get some practice in the next couple of weeks?

[01:26:31.300 --> 01:26:37.320]
He hasn't imprisoned those people who are cared to dissent. He has to be an open election. That's right. Isn't that true?

[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:41.360]
I mean come on

[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:39.900]
Basically them they have a cookware called all tracks

[01:29:40.540 --> 01:29:45.440]
Which is a real heavy duty gourmet non-stick you can use stainless steel

[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:50.280]
Tools on it and I bought those things two years ago. You can't wear them out

[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.320]
Excellent. I tell you what sounds like you're a full-timer. I might

[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:58.720]
Might get a job on one of those things, you know, okay. Well, give us a cut

[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:01.900]
Take care. Thanks a lot. Uh, I mentioned the herbal life

[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:06.020]
He's still dead. What thought was his name the guy with a big head of hair herbal life?

[01:30:06.020 --> 01:30:09.860]
Steve something very good. He's still dead. Oh look at this. Muffinus came in now

[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:13.900]
He's not even going to lunch right now and probably won't have to go to lunch now that we got all this great free food in here

[01:30:13.900 --> 01:30:15.480]
He sure got a nose for lunch, don't he?

[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.300]
herbal life was one was the other one I mentioned during a break

[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.760]
Just looked on by there so damn many

[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:28.740]
Orange alert by the way, though. I don't want to get your nervous orange alert

[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:33.540]
High alert baby. I wouldn't be down to get orange alert. That's what I heard

[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:35.140]
I

[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:39.720]
Mean if it's good enough for power 96% everybody home just out of you know in morning, but we go to a

[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.240]
I think you am should send everybody home at 11 o'clock

[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:47.500]
We're willing to go through one more break and put a tape on and put a tape on and go home, though, because we're under orange alert

[01:30:47.500 --> 01:30:53.680]
I have to go put the shutter you're making a nervous now because he's got to fly this weekend

[01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:58.820]
Okay, and you're making him real nervous. You know what a pussy. He is anyway. Okay. You're making him in fact

[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.200]
I just saw four here is fallout

[01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:04.960]
420560

[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:06.540]
UAM

[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.220]
And the banana republic baby only in Miami

[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:27.360]
All of my stuff for another gets you warm or something holiday

[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:31.940]
You better get something or you'll be getting nothing especially when it's time to have a day

[01:31:31.940 --> 01:31:36.120]
She's a real lady. She was a real young look at what since put on a pound of two

[01:31:36.660 --> 01:31:41.140]
So I went to the store got a card for the horn if she don't laugh without the fruit do

[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.720]
No kids coming to the boys have a suit if you went away you want to stay

[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.040]
But down the whippies ever you can eat candy after they all you can eat for faith

[01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:03.800]
She's now

[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:08.340]
Hey

[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:10.340]
Hey, hey, this day.

[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.780]
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:14.940]
Hey, this day.

[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:18.080]
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

[01:32:18.100 --> 01:32:19.440]
Hey, this day.

[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.220]
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:23.620]
Hey, this day.

[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:23.820]

[01:32:23.820 --> 01:32:23.820]

[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:24.980]
I'm very pissed.

[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:27.000]
Love you to 1-5-60-W2M.

[01:32:27.140 --> 01:32:29.360]
So anyway, Tom Ridge and John Ascroft are going to be speaking

[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.020]
to 1 o'clock today.

[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.460]
Do you get everybody nervous for the weekend?

[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:32.140]
No.

[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.240]
Size thrilling in his hair club for men.

[01:32:34.320 --> 01:32:35.940]
I'm not only the president, I'm a former climber.

[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:36.640]
He says that.

[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:37.160]
Remember.

[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.020]
He's a member.

[01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:40.880]
Size thrilling is hair club for men.

[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.900]
That's what I was trying to think about.

[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.520]
Along with verbal life.

[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:45.960]
Guys dead.

[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.240]
Lot of drugs.

[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:48.140]
Young guy.

[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.560]
Multi-millionaire of scam.

[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.360]
Appearance scam.

[01:32:53.180 --> 01:32:53.540]
Yeah.

[01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:55.220]
Back in those days, there were a whole bunch of those.

[01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:56.440]
None of them come to mind at the moment.

[01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.540]
There were a whole bunch of those things.

[01:32:57.800 --> 01:32:58.080]
Amway.

[01:32:58.740 --> 01:32:59.460]
Amway, obviously.

[01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:00.500]
Shackley.

[01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:01.060]
Shackley.

[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.060]

[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:01.440]
Shackley.

[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:01.440]

[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:01.440]

[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:01.520]
Shackley.

[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.140]
Vitamins, right?

[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:03.120]
Vitamins.

[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:04.040]
Don't forget.

[01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:04.840]
It's the products.

[01:33:05.140 --> 01:33:05.460]
The products.

[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:07.160]
He had a certain way of saying that.

[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.100]
There was so glad they were knowing.

[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:09.540]
He wanted to smash him in the mouth.

[01:33:10.820 --> 01:33:11.160]
The product.

[01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:11.440]

[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:15.200]
That's exactly how he said it.

[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:15.480]
I can't believe it.

[01:33:15.740 --> 01:33:15.740]

[01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:18.380]
I can't believe it.

[01:33:18.840 --> 01:33:20.440]
124 people hate all infomercials.

[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:22.780]
They wouldn't watch it if you paint them by the second.

[01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:25.840]
Girls gone wild video, 61.

[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:28.680]
Juan Popeel Showtime, rotisserie, barbecue, 17.

[01:33:28.860 --> 01:33:29.080]
Hey!

[01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.120]
The pocket fisherman, 14 time, has to wait.

[01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:34.660]
But anyway, speaking of that, where's my F?

[01:33:34.820 --> 01:33:35.900]
I got so much stuff here.

[01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.680]
Wait till you hear this story, by the way, from Reuters.

[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:40.380]
Oh, I shouldn't be reading because I want to get upset.

[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:41.260]
I don't give a crap.

[01:33:42.860 --> 01:33:48.100]
An Italian court has ruled that taking 40 joints of hashish on a school trip is not a crime.

[01:33:49.460 --> 01:33:53.020]
The marijuana was for a personal use since the 17-year-old student plan is shared

[01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.300]
with two fellow students on a teacher.

[01:33:54.680 --> 01:33:55.960]
The appeals court showed said.

[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:56.920]
This is from Reuters.

[01:33:57.520 --> 01:33:59.060]
Under Italian law, selling money was not a crime.

[01:33:59.060 --> 01:34:02.000]
The marijuana is a crime, but possession for personal use is not.

[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:02.860]
Bye.

[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:06.160]
It could easily have been consumed during the many days of the trip.

[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.380]
Courier Adela Sada quoted the court ruling saying.

[01:34:08.720 --> 01:34:11.260]
Courier Adela Sada, the evening courier.

[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:12.900]
Ah, evening news.

[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.600]
Courier Adela Sada.

[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:16.940]
Bona Sada.

[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:17.760]
Bona Sada.

[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:19.420]
Love that Italian, baby.

[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:21.620]
I'm going back to Italy right now, where I'll be safe.

[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:22.500]
You know what I mean?

[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:23.660]
I'm going to go right now.

[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:27.160]
Get some personal protect and avoid to sitidia, to Palermo.

[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.140]
Where is that fact?

[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:29.720]
Oh, here it is from Matreci, who says.

[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.540]
I absolutely love my Ron Popeel Showtime rotisserie.

[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:35.480]
I got one as a wedding gift two years ago.

[01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.100]
It's very easy to use and cooks meat perfectly.

[01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:38.660]
It'll make your meat perfect.

[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.260]
You just said it and forget it like the infomercial says.

[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:43.860]
You just said it and forget it.

[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:44.120]
Yeah!

[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:44.440]
Yeah!

[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:44.920]
Yeah!

[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:45.860]
Like this.

[01:34:46.660 --> 01:34:49.140]
I love those crowds on those infomercials.

[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:50.320]
No, is it loud?

[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.600]
And you know, it's the age of most of the people in those audiences?

[01:34:54.340 --> 01:34:55.160]
Death plus ten.

[01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.140]
I'm Tonya Ron.

[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.800]
Halondale, Sunrise Lakes, Surfside.

[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:02.960]
Oi!

[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:06.360]
Come on down here and tape some infomercials here, Ron.

[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.660]
We'll have your perfect audience.

[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:09.300]
You mentioned they're going to get something for free.

[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:10.860]
They'll say any crap you want.

[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.580]
Joe said it and forget it like the infomercial says.

[01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:15.840]
Be being primarily vegetarian.

[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.780]
I knew nothing about cooking meat for my highly carnivorous family.

[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.980]
It has saved my ass many times, Tracy said.

[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:23.400]
And fact, she's probably even slucker-rassing in a couple of times.

[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:24.820]
Just to be damn sure.

[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:25.620]
Nice going, Tracy.

[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:27.240]
Here's an interesting facts, George.

[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:28.200]
From Chris.

[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:33.400]
How about the very Christian, Mr. Ego, erection injection?

[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:35.400]
He claims it will only work on heterosexuals.

[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:38.920]
Also, Gilbert sucks Steve's ass at least twice per week.

[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.920]
And all he can talk about on Steve's show is you.

[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:41.880]
Thanks, Chris.

[01:35:42.160 --> 01:35:43.740]
Well, I guess Chris is the one who's listening to that show.

[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.660]
The one who don't show up in the numbers at all.

[01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.760]
On a station that basically doesn't exist.

[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:51.720]
So, at least Gilbert has found a roosting place.

[01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:55.280]
Thank God for that other than in between on our station here.

[01:35:57.080 --> 01:35:59.080]
This is the amazing Gilbert.

[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:04.940]
We minding you not to drink and drive this holiday season.

[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.520]
Yeah, like on poor, you might drop your home in touch.

[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:09.880]
When he's poor, by the way, I always ask you that,

[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:10.740]
and you never have an answer.

[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.560]
That's because it's not on this calendar.

[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:13.500]
It's a Goyce calendar?

[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:15.980]
Oi!

[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:16.880]
Here should know them.

[01:36:17.620 --> 01:36:21.180]
Here's one that said Joe just cut my TV in half with my Gensu knives.

[01:36:21.180 --> 01:36:22.220]
But wait, there's more.

[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:22.820]
Haha!

[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.500]
What a great line, Joe.

[01:36:24.700 --> 01:36:25.300]
They always said it.

[01:36:25.420 --> 01:36:26.300]
But wait, there's more!

[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:29.400]
If that didn't get you to be a sucker and make the call.

[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:30.380]
But wait, there's more.

[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.720]
I also took all my house tiles that would my Gensu spatula.

[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:36.820]
I had my credit card ready, question mark, and lost my ass.

[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:37.560]
There's Joe.

[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.060]
Only 72 easy payments of $89.99.

[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.660]
Yeah, the new Ron Popeo Showtime is less than $100.

[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:48.940]
Only 4 easy payments.

[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:50.300]
Huh?

[01:36:50.300 --> 01:36:52.260]
Only 5 easy payments of $99.

[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.440]
So it's like $0.04 less, $0.05 less.

[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:55.300]
The $100.

[01:36:57.040 --> 01:36:59.420]
And he gives you the price.

[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:00.280]
Oh!

[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.400]
Like somebody just brought out a magic wand in the fountain of youth.

[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.080]
Oh!

[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:05.780]
Like that.

[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:06.660]
Yeah.

[01:37:07.340 --> 01:37:07.580]
Haha!

[01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:09.700]
Hi, Alia.

[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:10.000]
Hello.

[01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:12.040]
Hello, Neil.

[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:12.460]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.440]
Oh, hey.

[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:13.960]
How's it going?

[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:14.440]
Great.

[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:18.540]
I'm really, really, I'm beyond nervous now with the high alert.

[01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.020]
Anyway, I want you to be very nervous.

[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:22.840]
I am.

[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:23.620]
I am extremely.

[01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.440]
I don't know what to do this weekend.

[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.300]
Under the bed, man.

[01:37:26.420 --> 01:37:26.740]
Exactly.

[01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:28.420]
That's where I'm going to go right now.

[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.420]
Take somebody good with you.

[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:29.940]
And hi, Bernie.

[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:33.940]
Now that facts took my thunder, I was going to mention one of the original

[01:37:33.940 --> 01:37:35.500]
and commercials against the knives.

[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:41.600]
Remember, I love that when they cut the slice that the tomatoes and then they went ahead

[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.440]
and cut some sheet metal with the same knife.

[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.800]
That was incredible.

[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:47.180]
Oh, well, somebody took the thunder away.

[01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:48.940]
I think sheet was the operative word.

[01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:49.340]
Yeah.

[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.040]
Have a great weekend and I'll see you out of the bed.

[01:37:51.180 --> 01:37:51.660]
Under the bed.

[01:37:51.860 --> 01:37:51.900]
Yeah.

[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:52.040]
Okay.

[01:37:52.380 --> 01:37:53.160]
Bye, bye, bye.

[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.040]
Under the bed, folks.

[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.280]
Uh-oh.

[01:37:56.780 --> 01:37:59.200]
But for a wide range of important tasks.

[01:38:00.140 --> 01:38:04.140]
From minting, it's the Sherman, you'll squaring in a Treasury Secretary John Snow

[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.660]
to replace that polonio geek that they had to blow out of there.

[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.500]
It's the squaring in here.

[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:09.860]
What he said?

[01:38:10.260 --> 01:38:11.340]
Yeah, it's the squaring in.

[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.860]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:17.880]
On the 18t and Verizon wireless line.

[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:22.160]
And George made a good point during the break, which is very rare today since he's busy defending Michael Jackson.

[01:38:23.040 --> 01:38:32.240]
But the fact that the entire world now knows since we made it very, very clear that even Stevie Wonder and Ray Charles can see that we're going to go to war no matter what anybody says or what anybody thinks.

[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:37.540]
Maybe that just is a coincidence, but it could be since we're going to orange level alert today.

[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:38.580]
Huh?

[01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:41.180]
Could be just a coincidence.

[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:45.400]
We made it very clear that we are adamant and whatever.

[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:49.240]
So you're always reading things into it.

[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:51.060]
Here's Miramar.

[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:51.380]
Hello.

[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:53.460]
Miramar.

[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:54.240]
Neil.

[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:54.840]
Yes, sir.

[01:38:55.020 --> 01:38:57.320]
It's not a Billy Mays alert.

[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:58.360]
It's not the other one.

[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:01.480]
What is the orange alert?

[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:02.820]
It's a Billy Mays alert.

[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:03.280]
Oh.

[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:04.780]
Anyway, I got the show done.

[01:39:04.780 --> 01:39:05.640]
Oh, I'm a little slow.

[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:06.260]
Okay, I get you.

[01:39:06.380 --> 01:39:07.000]
Very good.

[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:07.680]
All right.

[01:39:07.680 --> 01:39:08.780]
Yeah, I got that.

[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.060]
In fact, you know something.

[01:39:11.420 --> 01:39:12.020]
Wouldn't that be great?

[01:39:12.140 --> 01:39:15.220]
Billy Mays comes on TV just before the press conference starts this afternoon.

[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.040]
And it's a Billy Mays alert.

[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:17.540]
And there he is.

[01:39:17.620 --> 01:39:19.780]
He could peddle with that loud hysterical voice of his.

[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:20.380]
Oh, right.

[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:21.600]
Get everybody panicky.

[01:39:21.740 --> 01:39:22.060]
Yeah, go ahead.

[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:23.740]
Anyway, I got that show time.

[01:39:24.140 --> 01:39:25.040]
That's the halver bot, man.

[01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:25.480]
Really?

[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.400]
Yes, I cooked at least six, seven prime ribs on there.

[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.320]
They come about four or five pounds.

[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.800]
And I'll tell you what, I'll never go to Ruth Chris again.

[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:33.220]
Really?

[01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:33.860]
Yes, sir.

[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:34.480]
I'll be damned.

[01:39:34.860 --> 01:39:35.360]
It's organic.

[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.700]
I think I'm going to get one.

[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:37.840]
It's where you guys make sure.

[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.400]
Okay, thanks.

[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:39.060]
Anyway, two more.

[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.500]
There's a quick and bright.

[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.200]
Do you ever hear that one?

[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:41.560]
Sure.

[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:42.920]
And the steam buggy.

[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:44.620]
The steam buggy.

[01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:45.220]
That sounds familiar.

[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:46.040]
What is that?

[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:47.680]
That's the kind you put the water in it.

[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:50.660]
And it takes the cleanser bathrooms, cleans this, cleans that.

[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.260]
You know, it takes all the scum out.

[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:52.820]
Oh, it's on our thing.

[01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:53.400]
We got it on there.

[01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.040]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[01:39:54.100 --> 01:39:57.640]
In other words, if you get the show time, make sure you get the one with a 15-pound turkey

[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.940]
because the small one ain't worth a crap.

[01:39:59.140 --> 01:39:59.960]
Okay, enjoy your meat.

[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:00.700]
Have a good weekend.

[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.060]
Thanks.

[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:01.460]
Me too.

[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:04.120]
The steam buggy.

[01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:05.420]
Mm-hmm.

[01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.120]
Mm-hmm.

[01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.000]
Well, this is a good lunch.

[01:40:08.140 --> 01:40:08.760]
Thanks a lot, Ira.

[01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:10.780]
Atlantic City subs were our next difference in Hollywood.

[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:11.760]
They're really great.

[01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:13.160]
And Scott did not come by.

[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.180]
Boy, do we appreciate that.

[01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.160]
Did he make any comment?

[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:16.480]
Is Scott not around?

[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.540]
That's the beautiful thing about Ira.

[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:19.620]
He just smiles.

[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.300]
He just smiles.

[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:20.500]

[01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.020]
He gives it a food.

[01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:21.920]
Nothing to say.

[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:22.600]
Nothing to say.

[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:22.700]
Nothing to say.

[01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:24.060]
Good guy.

[01:40:24.300 --> 01:40:25.060]
Not a troublemaker.

[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:26.040]
Not a Yenta.

[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.100]
And not a Capsule.

[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:28.080]
Not a Capsule.

[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:28.920]
Not any of that crap.

[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.220]
You know, that phony, you know, it wasn't asking for any free plugs.

[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:38.100]
So, he's got to need to come by because we already gave him the free plugs for the Super Bowl party of party planners.

[01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:38.820]
Right?

[01:40:39.540 --> 01:40:40.280]
Say that five times.

[01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:41.260]
I still can't believe that.

[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.880]
He turned around and came back in here that day.

[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.920]
Had the hootspaw to come back in.

[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:47.180]
And I gave him the plug.

[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.720]
I mean, I'm easy, you know, for free food.

[01:40:48.780 --> 01:40:50.900]
Boy, does he have a lot of hootspaw?

[01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:51.940]
Yeah, he sure does.

[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:57.100]
So, when you go into Atlantic City subs and Ira, he'll be the bald head of guy with a real big smile on his face.

[01:40:57.660 --> 01:40:59.420]
Boy, do you really work with that asshole, Scott?

[01:40:59.600 --> 01:40:59.760]
Boy.

[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.000]
And he'll just smile.

[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:03.000]
He's used to it.

[01:41:03.020 --> 01:41:04.020]
What else is he going to do, you know?

[01:41:04.860 --> 01:41:06.200]
He's got years of practice, I guess.

[01:41:06.980 --> 01:41:09.020]
10 past 11 at 5, 60 at WQM.

[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.400]
Here's something that will help you feel good.

[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:11.180]
That's Oliomed.

[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:17.580]
Oliomed's Mediterranean formulas are advanced combinations of pharmaceutical-grade olive oil combined with all good things for your health.

[01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.280]
Vitamin, minerals, herbals, other nutrients.

[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:24.420]
Scientifically, this is not to provide natural nutrition solutions to help you support specific health needs.

[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:26.340]
For example, they've got three new formulas.

[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.400]
One to help you sleep.

[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.820]
One to help you control your weight.

[01:41:29.220 --> 01:41:32.900]
And coq10, which I've been taking every day for years, and is so important for your heart.

[01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.880]
Oliomed's also got supplements for health in your circulatory system.

[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.200]
Your digestive, your endocrine system, your skin bones, even your mind.

[01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:42.540]
All using the benefits of the finest of purest olive oil you'll find anywhere.

[01:41:44.340 --> 01:41:46.320]
And Oliomed has the products for men and women too.

[01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.960]
Well, I don't want to gag on it in the rid of the middle of my Oliomed spot.

[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.600]
Maybe I should have popped one right there, huh?

[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:51.780]
Oh, look at that.

[01:41:52.580 --> 01:41:54.580]
Oliomed's a great new product that you can pick up all over town.

[01:41:54.580 --> 01:41:57.480]
I'm going to ask you forward at public's, Eckerd's Whole Food Markets and Walgreens.

[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.860]
If you want to get more information about each and every one of their products, they'll be delighted to answer all your questions.

[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:03.640]
Call 1-866 Oliomed.

[01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.580]
That's 1-866-6536-6333.

[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:10.700]
You can also order their products online, oriomedamerica.com.

[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:14.900]
And don't forget to visit their sampling program at sportstown every Sunday during dolphin season,

[01:42:14.900 --> 01:42:16.680]
which is only about 18-20 months away.

[01:42:16.980 --> 01:42:19.060]
Start feeling great today again with Oliomed.

[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.900]
This is sportsweighting devices.

[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:25.060]
QAM.

[01:42:27.140 --> 01:42:28.560]
That's not good. It's great.

[01:42:28.700 --> 01:42:29.460]
You love the band.

[01:42:29.700 --> 01:42:31.580]
Guns and roses a zillion years ago.

[01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:35.340]
Are you waiting for me to have a different dance from a walkoff stage?

[01:42:36.380 --> 01:42:37.440]
What's up guys?

[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:48.360]
No, but Mastermind behind the greatest career suicide in the history of mankind is not back on this 49th city non-comeback cluster.

[01:42:48.360 --> 01:42:51.340]
We love agile. We love agile.

[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.840]
It's the Esmeralos not showing up to her.

[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:06.060]
See, no where to be found that the Owinga in Cleveland.

[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:14.080]
How about this powerhouse not arrival at Madison Square Garden?

[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:24.460]
Or what about this hard driving incy appearance at the first union center in Philly?

[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:34.120]
If you're bored with performers who actually conduct themselves in a professional manner and show up at their scheduled appearances,

[01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:39.600]
then you'll probably want to miss the Esmeralos not showing up to her.

[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.520]
We know he will. Call ticket master for your front row.

[01:43:45.160 --> 01:43:48.400]
It's the Esmeralos not showing up to her.

[01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:51.900]
116-560-60.

[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:54.500]
I think we ought to start that on Tuesday on this show because Monday's payday.

[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.020]
That would be a good idea for a couple of weeks.

[01:43:56.580 --> 01:43:59.600]
Anyway, here's the fact that it says, here's a few more infomercials you may remember.

[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:04.300]
In the early 90s or late 80s, the two clowns were one with a sickling English accent in the door with a glass

[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:05.940]
and selling car wax products that sucked.

[01:44:06.420 --> 01:44:08.360]
The English accent thing is very, very big.

[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:09.860]
Or Australian.

[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:14.960]
Also in case you haven't mentioned the spray on here was a classic, yes we did.

[01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:17.240]
All my love Arnold PSF you George.

[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.580]
Oh he's thinking about you.

[01:44:22.860 --> 01:44:24.140]
566-705-60.

[01:44:24.300 --> 01:44:24.680]
Orange alert.

[01:44:25.040 --> 01:44:26.380]
I've just mentioned that in passing.

[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:28.500]
We're raising from the yellow up to orange.

[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:32.160]
Yeah.

[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:35.080]
I'm just thinking how I'm supposed to adjust myself to that.

[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.520]
I think we're supposed to go home right now.

[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:39.040]
Stuff didn't look too happy about that when you sent that.

[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.160]
He looked a little bit nervous.

[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:41.360]
We've got to secure the house.

[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:42.740]
Here's a lady in Hylia.

[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:42.980]
Hello.

[01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:44.760]
Hello Neil.

[01:44:44.900 --> 01:44:45.280]
Yes ma'am.

[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:47.000]
Hi it's a lady who I'm your caller.

[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:47.460]
All right.

[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.520]
I'll run around and I bet you don't get many of those.

[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.080]
Not too many.

[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.600]
Okay, I just wanted to make a comment about Michael Jackson.

[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.160]
Okay.

[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:57.740]
Okay, what I'm calling to say is basically it comes down to this.

[01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:01.360]
People with millions of dollars get away with anything they want.

[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:04.280]
Okay, you can get away with murder like old Jake.

[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.580]
You can keep with little boys.

[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:09.380]
You can hang children off your balcony, close doors and Vegas to shop.

[01:45:09.640 --> 01:45:13.040]
You can do whatever you want and on TV and your above the law.

[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.520]
You don't get arrested.

[01:45:15.300 --> 01:45:16.960]
It's the American F and way they're...

[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.380]
Here we got people like George making excuses for...

[01:45:19.380 --> 01:45:21.060]
You'll let them know how much you say to start going to make it true.

[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:24.820]
Yeah, but now a poor slipper like you and me, you know, we do this.

[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.040]
And we're in jail in two weeks.

[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.200]
Who's a poor slipper?

[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.020]
That mother.

[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:31.320]
No, I'm not in that category.

[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:33.640]
You're talking about people that are like multi-millionaires.

[01:45:33.640 --> 01:45:34.520]
Yeah, definitely wealthy.

[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:35.840]
Exactly, exactly.

[01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:36.960]
And I love you, Neil.

[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.380]
That's all I have to say for today.

[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:38.800]
Thanks.

[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:39.800]
Okay, take care.

[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.380]
See you on the bed.

[01:45:40.620 --> 01:45:41.040]
Okay, bye-bye.

[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:41.320]
Bye-bye.

[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:43.740]
Nice, Holy Old Lady in Highlyah.

[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:44.900]
Boy, that's rare on this show.

[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:46.740]
Even ladies in on this show are rare anymore.

[01:45:47.460 --> 01:45:48.980]
After George chased him all the way in the summertime.

[01:45:49.860 --> 01:45:51.060]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6.

[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.900]
That's why when people like Carlos and...

[01:45:52.900 --> 01:45:55.560]
Oh, George, he gets all these women calling and he's got so many more women.

[01:45:55.680 --> 01:45:56.660]
And then the book comes down.

[01:45:56.740 --> 01:45:57.760]
George said, have any women?

[01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:58.560]
Remember that?

[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:00.420]
They don't want to admit.

[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:02.580]
I mean, they're embarrassed enough admitting they listen to me.

[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:04.440]
And maybe you do have a lot more women as possible.

[01:46:04.440 --> 01:46:06.680]
But they sure don't want to be telling anybody about that.

[01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:07.840]
Right.

[01:46:08.420 --> 01:46:10.100]
I'm not so sure why, but it's just...

[01:46:10.100 --> 01:46:10.580]
It's not socially...

[01:46:11.180 --> 01:46:11.680]
Oh, look at that.

[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.040]
Oh, I just spit out a piece of sandwich right on the board.

[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:16.200]
And then he ate it.

[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.120]
I'm sure...

[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:17.120]

[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:22.340]
What's your favorite TV info, Marshall?

[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.740]
I hate all info, Marshall's 140.

[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:27.500]
Over 40% of the audience hates it.

[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:30.260]
Of course they hate almost anything anyway, so at least they're consistent, right?

[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.340]
I forgot about that.

[01:46:31.340 --> 01:46:31.620]
Right.

[01:46:31.940 --> 01:46:32.320]
They hate.

[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:33.960]
They just hate the hero.

[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.660]
Girls gone wild video, 72.

[01:46:37.020 --> 01:46:37.880]
They like those a lot.

[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:41.220]
Ron Popeo Showtime, Rattisserie Barbecue, 17.

[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:43.000]
That's kind of weak, Ron, you know what?

[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:46.800]
I mean, if we could goose up a few more votes, maybe Ron would send us each one of the ones.

[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.000]
Not the crappy little ones, one of the big ones, you know?

[01:46:49.220 --> 01:46:50.380]
Or we could vote the whole turkey in there?

[01:46:51.820 --> 01:46:53.900]
I can think of a few turkeys I'd like to roast in there.

[01:46:54.780 --> 01:46:55.680]
Some of them work here.

[01:46:56.620 --> 01:46:58.280]
Ron Popeo Pocket Fisherman, 14.

[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.400]
How about this stuff?

[01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:00.680]
Was it STP?

[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:03.200]
Was that just an historic one?

[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:03.960]
He is just a product.

[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.100]
But it was like that.

[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:06.620]
You know who would know Joe Castello would know?

[01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:07.540]
Because he's the car racing.

[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:11.080]
I think Mario and Dredi are one of those hot shots endorsed it.

[01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:12.860]
Yeah.

[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:13.640]
Oh, you know me.

[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:15.420]
I'm in the business of mine and I would never endorse it.

[01:47:15.500 --> 01:47:16.920]
I wasn't the him, but it was somebody like that.

[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:23.300]
And you're supposed to, you know, pour it in your crankcase and it's going to protect your engine for like the next 50 billion miles.

[01:47:23.660 --> 01:47:23.900]
You know?

[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.220]
Crack like that.

[01:47:26.680 --> 01:47:27.360]
It's familiar.

[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:29.220]
Those were old.

[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:30.300]
I mean, those were ancient.

[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:30.600]
Right.

[01:47:31.100 --> 01:47:35.080]
Also a lot of the British ones, with the British guy's owner, very ancient.

[01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:38.300]
In fact, there's that one pasty looking Brit.

[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:39.540]
I'm just, there's heost Dragon.

[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:41.220]
Because you said that.

[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:43.900]
Kind of like a round, this is your bag.

[01:47:44.060 --> 01:47:45.980]
Oh, you know the one I'm talking about.

[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.260]
He's on a lot of them even now.

[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:53.400]
Kind of short, round, British, real heavy accident.

[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.660]
Richie Petty is shirt round in British.

[01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:58.660]
Well, you should don't know your auto racing, Mr.

[01:47:58.780 --> 01:47:59.780]
And you better start learning about it.

[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:00.400]
What's wrong with you?

[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:02.860]
That was Miguel's response to the crankcase.

[01:48:02.860 --> 01:48:04.640]
I could have been to the crankcase.

[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.520]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:10.780]
Yeah, he's a crankcase, all right.

[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:13.160]
Yeah, maybe you can alope with Mr. Ego, Gilbert.

[01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:17.440]
Maybe if he, since he's so big and getting all these funny body ports, he can get you a new head and new brain.

[01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:19.020]
That would be good for starters.

[01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.460]
Or I should say a brain.

[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:22.340]
I don't want to say a new brain.

[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:25.320]
Here's a call from Davy.

[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:25.540]
Hello.

[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:28.200]
Davy?

[01:48:28.340 --> 01:48:29.320]
Oh, Neil, how's it going?

[01:48:29.480 --> 01:48:29.780]
Pretty good.

[01:48:30.380 --> 01:48:35.820]
Listen, I don't know if anybody called in, but the Steve Garvey product used to pitch was called Fat Trapper Plus.

[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:36.420]
Right.

[01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:37.400]
Oh, okay.

[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:38.420]
I was nervous.

[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:39.240]
Fat Trapper Plus.

[01:48:39.540 --> 01:48:40.900]
It's the thing with him, they trapped them.

[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:43.600]
Yeah, I was nervous because of the orange alert I had to run home.

[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:44.400]
Okay.

[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:46.440]
Anyway, my three all time favorites.

[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:52.440]
D-7, the Sova Calo Pillow, and the Tom Boo Financial Money Making Seminole.

[01:48:53.020 --> 01:48:53.820]
Oh, yeah, good one.

[01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:54.720]
Now what's the pillow one?

[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:55.340]
What do they call it?

[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:56.900]
The Sova Calo Pillow.

[01:48:57.020 --> 01:49:02.680]
It was this doctor who was on there, and this pillow was filled with great nut cereal.

[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:04.360]
For the buckwheat pillow.

[01:49:04.700 --> 01:49:07.440]
You were supposed to be with three bucks for like 80 hours straight.

[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:08.500]
Right.

[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:13.140]
And they'd have the people would lay on it and be like, oh, I slept for three days and then the audience.

[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:14.920]
Oh, fantastic.

[01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.580]
It was good stuff.

[01:49:16.700 --> 01:49:20.660]
I'm going to get one now so I can hang out on the bed with my grape nuts.

[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:21.340]
Absolutely.

[01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:22.020]
Thank you.

[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:23.380]
Is that how they do?

[01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:24.440]
Fantastic upside.

[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:25.380]
Okay, see you.

[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:25.780]
Bye.

[01:49:26.420 --> 01:49:27.820]
Matt Collin, fantastic upside.

[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:28.400]
Let's hear it.

[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:28.840]
They won again.

[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.680]
Everybody's back on a bad way again.

[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.100]
Six nothing lost to the Leafs on Wednesday.

[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.580]
By the way, how about those Leafs feet and tamping overtime last night?

[01:49:34.660 --> 01:49:35.000]
Three, two.

[01:49:35.380 --> 01:49:36.300]
They're on fire, baby.

[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:37.680]
Nick Andrew Paul.

[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:38.700]
I told her that kid was eligible.

[01:49:38.740 --> 01:49:39.860]
Played in I George, what do you know?

[01:49:40.860 --> 01:49:46.120]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on EAT and T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:49.440]
I just had another one.

[01:49:49.540 --> 01:49:50.360]
I forgot who the hell was.

[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:51.440]
There's so many of them.

[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:52.720]
So many.

[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:55.520]
We got the guy in line too.

[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.340]
Has that STP thing?

[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:57.840]
Oh, yeah.

[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:58.400]
Nation for us.

[01:49:59.000 --> 01:49:59.700]
Here's the Redlands.

[01:49:59.900 --> 01:50:00.920]
Hey, Neil, how you doing?

[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:01.340]
Pretty good.

[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.520]
There was Andy Green at Telly.

[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:03.840]
Right.

[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:04.840]
And he had a...

[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:06.480]
See, I knew I just had the wrong Italian guy.

[01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:07.800]
Yeah, he always worked French code.

[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.280]
What does that tell you?

[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:10.420]
Go figure.

[01:50:11.260 --> 01:50:12.560]
But it was STP already.

[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:13.440]
What was it?

[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.240]
Was STP?

[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:14.680]
Yeah.

[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:15.620]
Okay, thanks.

[01:50:15.860 --> 01:50:17.020]
See, I totally was STP.

[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.260]
Oh, no, that wasn't it, George.

[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:21.480]
And see, again, first he tells me Michael Jackson is not a pedophile.

[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:22.480]
He feels sorry for him.

[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.200]
It's his bad upbringing.

[01:50:23.580 --> 01:50:24.560]
Daddy was a prick.

[01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:26.140]
And then he tells me...

[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.000]
It's little Vigo.

[01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:29.380]
Then he tells me STP was like he bought in the store.

[01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:30.600]
But you just buy a...

[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:31.740]
It's a Disney product that you buy in the store.

[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:32.580]
I understand that.

[01:50:32.660 --> 01:50:34.400]
But it was also originally on TV.

[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.280]
The infomercials.

[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.700]
Well, so then what do you open it up?

[01:50:37.780 --> 01:50:38.340]
Big mouth for it.

[01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:40.480]
Let Carlos let tell her, well, of course he's busy eating.

[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:41.900]
I don't want to hear him.

[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:42.580]
Are you sure?

[01:50:43.620 --> 01:50:44.020]
What?

[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:45.600]
Are you sure you don't hear me?

[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.160]
Positive.

[01:50:46.580 --> 01:50:47.160]
But are you sure?

[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:47.840]
Are you sure?

[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:48.720]
Very sure.

[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:52.680]
You don't even know who the British guy is I'm talking about.

[01:50:52.740 --> 01:50:57.960]
He always wears the apron, the red apron, and he's like a shirt-round typical pasty Brit.

[01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:59.760]
With a real heavy accent.

[01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:03.900]
And he's always selling knives, a cookware crap, you know?

[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:07.440]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, slick 50.

[01:51:08.680 --> 01:51:09.780]
Slick 50, that was it.

[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:11.260]
That's the stuff you pour in your crankcase.

[01:51:12.140 --> 01:51:15.360]
And then your engine, it feels like a piece by piece it falls somewhere else.

[01:51:15.420 --> 01:51:16.980]
It was not STP, it was slick 50.

[01:51:17.360 --> 01:51:17.640]
Told you.

[01:51:18.580 --> 01:51:21.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:21.880]
What do you want?

[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.560]
You said it was Mario and Dready.

[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:24.780]
I said Michael Jackson.

[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.100]
You said it was Mario Lemieux.

[01:51:26.260 --> 01:51:27.600]
Hey Mario, calm down a little bit.

[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:28.520]
Okay, what about your exports?

[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:29.400]
I didn't see that game.

[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:30.680]
I was busy losing my money.

[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:32.700]
Hey Mickey, Mickey, Mickey, Mickey,

[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:34.540]
Mickey over there, Pombo-no-Park, my little Pies on.

[01:51:34.820 --> 01:51:36.100]
Got a message for you today Mickey.

[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:45.520]
Here's West Palm Beach, hello.

[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:46.720]
Hey Neil.

[01:51:47.020 --> 01:51:47.320]
Yes sir.

[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:48.900]
Maybe it was Duralood.

[01:51:49.300 --> 01:51:49.940]
Number Duralood.

[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:50.780]
That was another one.

[01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:52.340]
And CD, there's another one.

[01:51:52.460 --> 01:51:54.720]
I think Bobby or Alan, for was advertised on.

[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.480]
Right, that's right.

[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:57.380]
I never thought STP was on CDEO.

[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:01.720]
I have a, I have a, how about the blonde, butch, bitch.

[01:52:02.660 --> 01:52:03.380]
Susan powder.

[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.600]
Oh, Susan powder, that's right.

[01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:06.300]
That's the insanity.

[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:07.000]
Exactly.

[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:09.740]
And then you can picture on colors your ding master.

[01:52:11.360 --> 01:52:12.080]
Ding master.

[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.580]
Right, we got that one.

[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:14.880]
And then the video professor.

[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:15.420]
Professor?

[01:52:16.120 --> 01:52:17.460]
No, the video professor.

[01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:18.720]
You're going to learn how to speak Greek.

[01:52:18.820 --> 01:52:20.500]
You're going to be Greek in about three minutes, right?

[01:52:21.080 --> 01:52:23.960]
They have these, they have the dimfomercials and after them Toronto too.

[01:52:24.140 --> 01:52:24.540]
Oh sure.

[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.680]
Now you can be, they have them on overnight.

[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:28.980]
When you start flipping channels in Amsterdam late at night,

[01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:31.160]
you get one or two things either naked boobs,

[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:34.980]
either a porn movies, or you get the infomercials.

[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.800]
Hey, and let me tell you one other thing.

[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:41.780]
In the form of infomercials, they have the 800 numbers with the hot babes on it.

[01:52:41.900 --> 01:52:42.360]
And they're naked.

[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:44.000]
And they're on there and there's the 800 number.

[01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:44.860]
Hi, I'm Linda.

[01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:46.000]
And there they are.

[01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.920]
I know you don't, you probably don't speak, you don't speak real fluent Dutch.

[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.080]
Dutch?

[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:53.120]
Yeah, about four words.

[01:52:53.980 --> 01:52:58.380]
Is there, is there talk, chat shows or talk shows like yours in overseas

[01:52:58.380 --> 01:52:59.400]
and Amsterdam or something?

[01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:00.220]
No, you're kidding me.

[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.760]
They would love me there.

[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.600]
I'm serious, I'd be having a 90's share.

[01:53:05.160 --> 01:53:06.420]
Let me ask you one of the questions too.

[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.440]
Who decides if you cut the callers off when you're ready to get rid of me,

[01:53:09.520 --> 01:53:10.040]
you're going to cut me off.

[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:14.680]
What about like Mo or Mad Dog?

[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:17.300]
Did the producers do it or who does it?

[01:53:17.580 --> 01:53:19.720]
No, they, what do you mean the producers better not be doing it?

[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.780]
If the producer cuts somebody off, we blow their brains out.

[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:25.740]
It always seems like you're ready to have a rebuttal to the question.

[01:53:25.740 --> 01:53:26.200]
You're gone.

[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.720]
Yeah, just like that.

[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:31.160]
Fine, I, I, and I looked, that was done with love.

[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:32.600]
He knows that I was going to do that.

[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.400]
It was just for fun because he kept saying that, you know.

[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.680]
What was he talking about them?

[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.680]
I don't know what I don't care.

[01:53:37.780 --> 01:53:38.320]
It was just funny.

[01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:39.440]
He just meant, thank you sir.

[01:53:39.720 --> 01:53:40.200]
Excellent call.

[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:44.400]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, 20, 80, and T.

[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.660]
And Verizon Wireless Live.

[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:47.300]
Why should the audience have free speech?

[01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:48.140]
We don't have it anymore.

[01:53:49.100 --> 01:53:50.180]
Live and local.

[01:53:50.740 --> 01:53:54.280]
We're sports radio 560, S U A M.

[01:53:56.620 --> 01:53:59.220]
Today's show is brought to you by the makers of Tiger Kitty,

[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.780]
the cat food with the taste of real human flesh.

[01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:04.200]
Tiger Kitty, don't ask how we make it.

[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.020]
And now, back to our show.

[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.060]
Warning, we have mercilessly taken the following material out of context

[01:54:09.060 --> 01:54:10.740]
with out endorsement or permission from those depicted.

[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.880]
It is our ongoing mission to make everything that is good and decent

[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:14.020]
look as ridiculous as possible.

[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:16.260]
We hope we reach that goal, or at least major laugh.

[01:54:16.380 --> 01:54:17.620]
Girl gone wild.

[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:18.980]
Wild, wild, wild.

[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:20.400]
In South Central LA.

[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:24.740]
You've seen them in Cancun, Daytona Beach, and all over Spring Break.

[01:54:24.960 --> 01:54:25.400]
Excellent.

[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:29.740]
Now the Girl's Gone Wild, affirmative action team is taking it to the inner city.

[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:31.820]
It's Girl's Gone Wild.

[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:33.160]
Wild, wild, wild.

[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:34.560]
In South Central LA.

[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.220]
Girl's out there taking off their pants, taking off their shirts.

[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:38.180]
Taking off everything.

[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:40.120]
Having kids when they shouldn't be.

[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:41.340]
Smoking crack.

[01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:42.080]
Not reading.

[01:54:42.380 --> 01:54:44.180]
Acting a straight damn fool.

[01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:49.880]
We don't know why exactly, maybe it's the weather, maybe it's the high registry crime.

[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:50.440]
Traffic.

[01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:51.780]
Poverty.

[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:52.160]
Crack.

[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.660]
Either way, these kids have gone completely f**king bonkers in South Central LA.

[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:57.680]
Girl's Gone Wild.

[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.520]
Wild, wild, wild.

[01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:02.120]
What if they could have a one's new dogs and leaves behind the camera.

[01:55:02.420 --> 01:55:03.000]
Game day.

[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:04.860]
Did I mention they went wild, whole now?

[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:05.820]
They went wild.

[01:55:06.020 --> 01:55:07.400]
It's too bad Georgian Carlos didn't hear that.

[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.340]
1131 at 560.

[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:10.300]
Girl's Gone Wild.

[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.160]
Don't have heard it before.

[01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:13.740]
How did you hear that before?

[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.680]
Is that an old bit that they recycle this week?

[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:17.340]
Is it a new bit?

[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:24.900]
Anyway, here's a fact that says what about that Schmuck who sells the book where you can get money for free from the government to open various businesses.

[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:26.780]
The guy we're going to suit with the dollar sign is on.

[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:27.720]
What is his name?

[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.320]
Matthew Lesco.

[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:28.960]
There you go.

[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.080]
He's screaming and whining what that puss his name.

[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:31.840]
There you go Matthew.

[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:32.460]
Let's go.

[01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.000]
Let's go.

[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:35.260]
And we have a bit about him too.

[01:55:35.800 --> 01:55:35.980]
Called.

[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:38.160]
I don't know Matthew Lesco.

[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:39.200]
It is?

[01:55:39.480 --> 01:55:40.260]
I don't know.

[01:55:40.740 --> 01:55:42.780]
We got, we don't have that.

[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:43.740]
We got Maddie Lachem.

[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:44.320]
Lachem.

[01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:45.320]
Lachem.

[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:50.560]
146 people say they hate all infomercials who are trying to find your favorite.

[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:52.320]
Girls Gone Wild videos 77.

[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.160]
Oh!

[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.220]
Ron Popeel, short time with his rebarbecue 19.

[01:55:56.420 --> 01:55:58.220]
The Ron Popeel pocket fisherman 15.

[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.100]
I thought Ronco was named after Ron Popeel.

[01:56:01.300 --> 01:56:01.720]
So did I.

[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:03.100]
Maybe he's a junior who does.

[01:56:03.320 --> 01:56:03.540]
Nah.

[01:56:05.060 --> 01:56:07.720]
Five Masters Suzanne Summers, Blue Thigh Thing 10.

[01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:10.280]
George Foreman, Lean Mean, Grillin Machine 9.

[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:12.080]
Never saw one still seven.

[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:13.840]
I don't know.

[01:56:14.420 --> 01:56:16.340]
Out of 358, only seven.

[01:56:16.460 --> 01:56:17.380]
It's been stuck on seven.

[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:19.560]
I don't believe there's anybody never saw an infomercial.

[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:21.120]
Maybe they don't have TV.

[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.080]
I think even in the jungles of Caracas.

[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:24.180]
Maybe they're Amish.

[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:26.280]
I think even in the jungles of Bangladesh.

[01:56:26.840 --> 01:56:28.620]
They've seen infomercials.

[01:56:28.640 --> 01:56:30.860]
At least they've seen Janet Paul Crotch.

[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:35.740]
567-0560, Proud 560 on the AT&T line.

[01:56:35.740 --> 01:56:36.540]
A call from New York.

[01:56:36.660 --> 01:56:36.880]
Hello.

[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:38.800]
Yeah.

[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:39.440]
Yes sir.

[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:40.280]
Neil.

[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:40.740]
Yes.

[01:56:41.100 --> 01:56:43.720]
How about, um, uh, keyapat?

[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:45.180]
Keyapat's excellent.

[01:56:45.880 --> 01:56:46.760]
Is it an infomercial?

[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:47.360]
No.

[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:47.660]
There was never.

[01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:48.480]
No, I think you're right.

[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:49.360]
I think it was only a spot.

[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.560]
Well, okay.

[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.000]
Okay.

[01:56:53.380 --> 01:56:54.360]
Yeah, I guess so.

[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:54.760]
Okay.

[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:56.760]
Crushed.

[01:56:58.440 --> 01:57:02.740]
Well, I mentioned one before and then we said, was that really ever an infomercial?

[01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:03.540]
No, it's just a spot.

[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:04.040]
The clapper.

[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:05.100]
I didn't mention it.

[01:57:05.100 --> 01:57:06.220]
Somebody factored in the clapper.

[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:07.440]
Like that.

[01:57:09.140 --> 01:57:10.640]
Somebody's got the old clapper.

[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.700]
Oh, here's the New England Paul who always sends his phone.

[01:57:13.700 --> 01:57:14.280]
He's got his back in his back.

[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:17.540]
He's in the giveaway a sideway for some strange notice that.

[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.660]
Saw the show with Michael Jackson last night.

[01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:21.800]
He makes aliens look good.

[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:23.260]
You tell me this man is a man.

[01:57:23.660 --> 01:57:25.200]
And I think it's iffy at best.

[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:28.700]
The last question he answered was if there were no more children in the world, he would kill himself.

[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.420]
Yes, I heard that.

[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:31.060]
By the way, the show has never been better.

[01:57:31.180 --> 01:57:31.940]
Thank you, New England Paul.

[01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:32.680]
I always liked you a lot.

[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:32.980]
You're right.

[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.580]
The show has been, we really picked it up here.

[01:57:35.180 --> 01:57:37.300]
And Spider-Wat George is trying to do the sabotage of the show.

[01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:37.880]
What?

[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.860]
To give me to do all, uh, bedtime stories.

[01:57:40.180 --> 01:57:40.320]
Oh.

[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:43.200]
A really funny information was the one about master.

[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:44.980]
It's see it's high at sea.

[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:46.220]
TSI.

[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.840]
Self defense course pronounced sigh.

[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:50.500]
The host was Danny Boone and douchebag.

[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.620]
This martial arts expert would show you how to defend yourself against muggers and rapists.

[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.200]
The fighting part was when he demonstrated the ego claw hold on Danny.

[01:57:59.620 --> 01:58:01.140]
He flipped that douchebag like a pancake.

[01:58:02.660 --> 01:58:03.060]
Excellent.

[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:03.580]
You saw that?

[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:04.740]
He's seen them all.

[01:58:05.100 --> 01:58:06.040]
That's his thing.

[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:09.940]
He's got one of those little like you once gave me the little battery operated TV under the overpass.

[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:10.340]
That's right.

[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:11.740]
That's all he can do is watch information.

[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:13.720]
But we finally hit on it because you know he doesn't like chalk.

[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:14.700]
But I will say this.

[01:58:14.920 --> 01:58:17.480]
He's one of the few guys who lives under an overpass that's got the cable.

[01:58:19.620 --> 01:58:20.740]
Well, the rope wore out.

[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.200]
Here's Miami Beach.

[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:22.440]
Hello.

[01:58:23.060 --> 01:58:23.380]
Neil.

[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:23.980]
Yes, sir.

[01:58:24.340 --> 01:58:24.880]
How you doing, Neil?

[01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:25.220]
Okay.

[01:58:26.020 --> 01:58:28.960]
I saw the Michael Jackson interview last night.

[01:58:29.640 --> 01:58:32.680]
It was very disturbing that this man has kids.

[01:58:33.820 --> 01:58:35.360]
And uh, sorry.

[01:58:35.580 --> 01:58:38.280]
And then I kept watching after when the news came on.

[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:40.460]
I had some some psychiatrists.

[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:45.040]
Two of them that were watching the interview and they both said it was very disturbing.

[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:49.660]
One lady said that you know they got to remove the kid away from him now.

[01:58:49.880 --> 01:58:51.040]
Immediately about sooner.

[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:57.420]
But there's one thing that I saw during the interview that I kind of agree with him.

[01:58:57.620 --> 01:59:00.040]
It's when they were in the limousine.

[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:01.080]
I don't know if you saw it.

[01:59:01.180 --> 01:59:05.600]
They were in the limousine driving to Michael Jackson's store.

[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.060]
That was the one that he buys all that crap.

[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:09.000]
There's a lot of money in.

[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:15.920]
The guy in the picture that I was doing the interview asked him how much he worked.

[01:59:16.420 --> 01:59:17.760]
And he like kind of shied back.

[01:59:18.740 --> 01:59:22.100]
And he said, uh, I don't really want to talk about.

[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:22.840]
He called me first.

[01:59:24.380 --> 01:59:26.240]
He kind of said again, he goes, come on.

[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:27.580]
Tell me what you're worth.

[01:59:27.640 --> 01:59:29.100]
He goes a billion, right?

[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:32.100]
But then he, Michael Jackson fell very uncomfortable.

[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:33.780]
He changed the subject.

[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:34.840]
And he knows he asked him.

[01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:37.840]
He goes, don't you think Jayce Deedler is a sorry ass quarterback?

[01:59:41.160 --> 01:59:43.880]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60, pound five, 60.

[01:59:44.300 --> 01:59:45.880]
Now let me ask you this question.

[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:46.240]
Okay.

[01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:47.900]
Let me ask you this.

[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:52.180]
They've been putting this on there for like about the last 45 minutes or so.

[01:59:52.480 --> 01:59:54.840]
Terror threat to be raised to Orange today.

[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:58.240]
Now they're going to want to allow us to speak at 12.30.

[01:59:58.340 --> 02:00:00.180]
I thought it was like one o'clock first to speak at 12.30.

[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:01.740]
They were well, maybe listening on a little bit of that.

[02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:02.620]
They'll kill some good time.

[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:06.960]
But in other words, are we supposed to like have a good time now?

[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:08.480]
That's why we're having so much fun now.

[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:10.700]
Because starting at 12.30 or one whenever they tell us,

[02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:11.940]
that's when they're going to raise it.

[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:12.800]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:00:12.940 --> 02:00:12.940]

[02:00:12.980 --> 02:00:13.780]
Happened before then.

[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:15.620]
I'm getting a point.

[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:18.540]
There's no good, they're not going to be a terrorist attack before they raise the alert level.

[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:19.240]
That's what I'm saying.

[02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:19.660]
Right.

[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:24.200]
So in other words, until they officially tell us, they're just preparing us for it.

[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:24.400]
Okay.

[02:00:24.440 --> 02:00:25.560]
Are you getting us ready for it?

[02:00:25.580 --> 02:00:26.020]
Which is why?

[02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:28.340]
Then we can increase our alert level.

[02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:29.280]
We should use this time to get high.

[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.120]
Our PAL, our personal alert level.

[02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:33.180]
Are you sure our loved ones are not your pal?

[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.340]
Your personal alert level?

[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:35.560]
Palley?

[02:00:35.620 --> 02:00:36.340]
Personal as a...

[02:00:36.860 --> 02:00:36.960]
Level?

[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:38.800]
So there you go.

[02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:41.700]
They're going to be announcing terrorist threat level to be raised to Orange today.

[02:00:42.080 --> 02:00:43.100]
Little one, anybody getting nervous?

[02:00:43.340 --> 02:00:43.660]
We'll panic.

[02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:44.580]
We've been through this before.

[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:47.420]
And the fact that the rest of the world is getting a little bit nervous about us.

[02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:48.260]
And North Korea.

[02:00:48.820 --> 02:00:49.600]
Don't get all excited.

[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.640]
Okay, because it won't do any good.

[02:00:50.740 --> 02:00:52.120]
Just have a good time and hope for the best.

[02:00:53.040 --> 02:00:53.740]
And hope real hard.

[02:00:55.500 --> 02:00:56.040]
Here's Miami.

[02:00:56.220 --> 02:00:56.380]
Hello.

[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:57.840]
Neil.

[02:00:57.980 --> 02:00:58.420]
Yes, sir.

[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:01.080]
Neil, on Michael Jackson.

[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:05.320]
Do you think that he passed on that skin disease to those kids?

[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:08.380]
They're not his kids in the first place.

[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:12.140]
Well, because that was my question, really.

[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:15.060]
It's how many chromosomes of Michael Jackson to those kids have.

[02:01:15.500 --> 02:01:16.260]
I can't...

[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:16.800]
The big...

[02:01:16.800 --> 02:01:16.980]
Oh!

[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:23.620]
And the other thing I wanted to ask you, Neil, I want to try to get one of those t-shirts with a bush,

[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.120]
with the nose, with the clown nose.

[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.080]
Do you know where I can get one?

[02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:26.540]
No.

[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:28.660]
With the clown nose?

[02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:29.340]
Yeah.

[02:01:30.380 --> 02:01:31.220]
We'll find out.

[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:31.880]
Somebody will call.

[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:37.840]
That guy that talked show that whose name rhymes with feces was outraged that those things

[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.520]
even existed.

[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.340]
And when we brought him up, I wanted to see if I could locate one.

[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:43.060]
We'll find him for you.

[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.020]
And listen, finally.

[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:45.460]
Yes.

[02:01:46.300 --> 02:01:49.360]
Colin Powell convinced me that we need a regime change.

[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:51.060]
But he here in the States.

[02:01:51.940 --> 02:01:52.300]
Thank you.

[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:52.740]
Thank you.

[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:53.760]
Very good.

[02:01:53.880 --> 02:01:54.800]
Yeah, excellent line.

[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.020]
Gilbert just called, by the way, and said, really?

[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:00.540]
Did he really?

[02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:01.400]
He really did.

[02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:02.260]
I'll be damned.

[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:02.660]
Gilbert.

[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:04.440]
That's Gilbert's solid, by the way.

[02:02:06.760 --> 02:02:10.400]
5-670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon line.

[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:12.680]
And now we're talking about regime change.

[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:15.360]
No, we aren't talking about that anymore.

[02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:15.840]
I'm sorry.

[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:17.540]
We're talking about weapons of mass destruction.

[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.080]
See, they couldn't decide from one day to the next, which it was.

[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:21.560]
First, it was regime change.

[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:23.740]
And then it became weapons of mass destruction.

[02:02:23.880 --> 02:02:24.700]
Are you asking questions?

[02:02:24.940 --> 02:02:25.080]
No.

[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:25.960]
Not me.

[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:26.900]
Not anymore.

[02:02:27.280 --> 02:02:29.320]
Not since they're changing their threat level.

[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.120]
That was wrong with you, man.

[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:33.700]
Now, what are these T-shirts?

[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.580]
They got bush with the what-nose, the clown-nose?

[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.600]
I'd like the Alfred E. Newman one with the big ears myself.

[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:40.460]
Although, I guess we can just look at the screen and see that.

[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:43.160]
I'll let the Hitler version myself.

[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:44.360]
There you go.

[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.300]
See, there's George again.

[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:48.420]
Going, way, way, way off the deep end.

[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:50.460]
Just, I thought you went in a good mood today.

[02:02:50.460 --> 02:02:51.680]
I thought you were feeling good with Louis.

[02:02:51.800 --> 02:02:51.960]
I'm so fed you.

[02:02:52.140 --> 02:02:52.980]
We're so unhappy with you.

[02:02:53.080 --> 02:02:55.500]
You're just going too far with that, OK?

[02:02:55.640 --> 02:02:57.280]
Just because we do goost up a little bit near.

[02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:57.740]
He's dizzy.

[02:02:57.740 --> 02:02:59.560]
Just because you painted those pictures again.

[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:01.800]
There's George making all those comments, OK?

[02:03:03.420 --> 02:03:05.600]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8, 10, 0, 5.

[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:05.900]
I'm sorry.

[02:03:06.140 --> 02:03:08.460]
I'm trying to be Mr. Night Sky just get along with everybody.

[02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:10.840]
I just want to like pump them away through these last four years.

[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:12.000]
Get that big paycheck.

[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:12.820]
Put it in the bank.

[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:13.820]
That's all.

[02:03:14.220 --> 02:03:16.240]
Join my life as best I can until, like,

[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.440]
we're dropped La Bamba.

[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.320]
Here's a lady in four Myers. Hello.

[02:03:22.660 --> 02:03:23.460]
Hi, Haurine.

[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:23.880]
Great.

[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:27.020]
How that Billy Brink's a Thai bow guy.

[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:27.600]
Who?

[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.140]
You know the Thai bow in four Marshalls.

[02:03:30.220 --> 02:03:31.180]
Oh yeah, we got it.

[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.420]
Do I have that on there?

[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:32.780]
Okay.

[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:33.380]
That's okay.

[02:03:34.020 --> 02:03:35.400]
Well, Michael Jackson isn't wacko do.

[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:36.100]
Okay.

[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:40.280]
And if I, my parents say, well, I'm asked every day of my life, I'd probably grow up and

[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:41.540]
want to look just like Michael Jackson.

[02:03:41.740 --> 02:03:43.700]
Maybe they send him and the kids to Afghanistan.

[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:44.620]
Yeah.

[02:03:44.620 --> 02:03:46.980]
So you're seeing the same thing with kids that his dad did to him.

[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:48.420]
It's just that's waiting the abuse.

[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:49.280]
In fact, you know something.

[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.160]
Maybe when we invade the bag that we can drop him over.

[02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:54.040]
You know, I think that they deserve him.

[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:55.100]
He definitely sit in there.

[02:03:55.140 --> 02:03:56.000]
Nice to meet in Purgatory.

[02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:56.720]
Okay, thanks.

[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:57.360]
Thank you.

[02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:57.820]
Have a great day.

[02:03:58.820 --> 02:03:59.480]
Here you go.

[02:03:59.680 --> 02:04:00.040]
Here you go.

[02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:00.420]
Sodom.

[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:00.980]
Here's one for you.

[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:02.360]
It's Michael, Michael motorcycle.

[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:05.000]
I take one look at him.

[02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:06.560]
I think that would give him what for you.

[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:08.620]

[02:10:55.120 --> 02:11:05.700]
my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

[02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:15.760]
my, my, my my my my, my, my, my my, my my why losing you was kimchi, but we did not ask that you feel

[02:11:15.900 --> 02:11:27.300]
ка, and we did not question you but we did not ask that you feel like that you feel THAT Ain't'n'nати

[02:11:27.300 --> 02:11:31.560]
the best but I did it on your request. That your request is probably all I've ever put pictures

[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:35.680]
of in your past crops, a soortx of corn stolen cakes, throwing patterns, throwing patterns

[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:38.560]
alert as well about the possibility of assassination

[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:40.560]
attempts of kidnappings.

[02:11:41.080 --> 02:11:44.600]
And as to where there is no specific region,

[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:47.200]
they're told to be alert all around the world, Carol.

[02:11:47.580 --> 02:11:51.160]
They're told in particular to be vigilant in their places

[02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:55.660]
of worship, in schools, in clubs that they may attend,

[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:59.560]
and that if it all possible, they should try to congregate

[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:02.080]
where Americans don't usually go.

[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:03.820]
So it isn't very spreading.

[02:12:03.820 --> 02:12:06.540]
But obviously there isn't a lot of insular bar

[02:12:06.540 --> 02:12:09.980]
that the US government can offer Americans overseas

[02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:12.080]
other than to be on alert.

[02:12:12.540 --> 02:12:14.520]
And they do actually say that you should keep

[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:17.260]
your personal documents on hand.

[02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:21.240]
And by that they mean your US passport, bank records,

[02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:24.120]
your birth certificate, the marriage certificate

[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:28.440]
you should keep puppies as well, and just be prepared

[02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:32.160]
for the possibility of some sort of a terrorist attack.

[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:35.620]
And obviously, Carol, they're saying that this is not

[02:12:35.620 --> 02:12:40.360]
directly related to Iraq, but rather to different places

[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:40.900]
all around.

[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:41.020]
Right.

[02:12:41.140 --> 02:12:42.080]
No, that's just a coincidence.

[02:12:42.300 --> 02:12:43.940]
All this stuff this week.

[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:44.660]
It's just a coincidence.

[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:46.400]
Not directly related.

[02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:49.100]
In fact, it's kind of related to Iraq,

[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:51.420]
the same way that Saddam Hussein is related to Al-Qaeda.

[02:12:52.860 --> 02:12:53.540]
Very loosely.

[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:56.200]
OK, let's get back to fun and games.

[02:12:56.380 --> 02:12:58.260]
OK, 1230, we'll put that thing on with Tom Ridge

[02:12:58.260 --> 02:13:00.140]
and John Ascroft.

[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:01.800]
And then we'll all make a run for it.

[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:03.120]
Why do people listen to border, right?

[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:05.340]
Here's plantation.

[02:13:05.660 --> 02:13:05.840]
Hello.

[02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:06.800]
Hi, Neil.

[02:13:07.080 --> 02:13:07.440]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:07.880 --> 02:13:09.260]
I think you're covered most of them.

[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:10.600]
But you know, wasn't girls gone

[02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.480]
while just the spot, not a full-in commercial?

[02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.760]
No, a full-in commercial man.

[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:14.560]
You must have good stuff.

[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:16.420]
Well, remember, Leslie Ugams used

[02:13:16.420 --> 02:13:19.500]
to do that full-in commercial for the psychics before Miss Cleo.

[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:19.840]
Right.

[02:13:20.760 --> 02:13:22.960]
Also, Richard Simmons, no one said that.

[02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:23.500]
Sure we did.

[02:13:23.920 --> 02:13:24.540]
Oh, he did?

[02:13:24.740 --> 02:13:27.320]
We did deal a meal and the sweat into the oldies.

[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:29.560]
The grace card driver that does it now

[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:31.580]
is AJ Foight, the Z-Max.

[02:13:32.220 --> 02:13:33.320]
Z-Max, we got that.

[02:13:33.780 --> 02:13:36.620]
But what are your responses, Dr. Shapiro?

[02:13:36.920 --> 02:13:37.120]
Yeah.

[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:39.880]
He has the woman in the lingerie on the couch.

[02:13:40.160 --> 02:13:40.900]
Oh, he's on there, too?

[02:13:41.340 --> 02:13:43.260]
Yeah, saying, you know, if you have a full head of hair,

[02:13:43.900 --> 02:13:45.940]
and all he has someone over there with the lingerie.

[02:13:45.980 --> 02:13:47.540]
But the best information was last night.

[02:13:47.640 --> 02:13:48.560]
Really, it was Michael Jackson.

[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:49.080]
Yeah.

[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:50.660]
I mean, because I don't know what to do.

[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:52.600]
And it seems to be working real well, by the way.

[02:13:52.640 --> 02:13:54.980]
They're buying his albums like a Halava and Tel Aviv.

[02:13:55.340 --> 02:13:55.900]
I love your say.

[02:13:56.060 --> 02:13:57.580]
His record tells a way up.

[02:13:57.700 --> 02:13:58.200]
So we got it.

[02:13:58.540 --> 02:13:59.300]
There you go.

[02:13:59.300 --> 02:14:00.300]
Sock a born every minute.

[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.240]
Have a great week, Hanson.

[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:02.040]
Hide on the couch.

[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:03.280]
Behind the TV.

[02:14:03.900 --> 02:14:05.440]
Right next to your bonpo, P.O. Fegematic.

[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.680]
I mean, always what he was just babbling there

[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:11.340]
was like, keep your documents handy.

[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:14.560]
And, you know, make sure your insurance is paid up.

[02:14:14.620 --> 02:14:15.560]
Now, is that our birth certificate

[02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.980]
was supposed to keep our IDET certificate?

[02:14:17.180 --> 02:14:18.480]
I'm not really sure what voice done

[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:19.780]
in which he was babbling there.

[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:21.420]
Your dental records?

[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.280]
Good thing they don't want to get anybody hysterical.

[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:25.140]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:25.620]
That's good.

[02:14:25.720 --> 02:14:28.240]
I'm glad everybody to keep calm, cool, like we are.

[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:29.900]
Let's get out of here.

[02:14:30.640 --> 02:14:32.060]
Here is Pember Pine.

[02:14:32.380 --> 02:14:32.380]

[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:34.500]
Yeah, and you know, do you have the,

[02:14:34.540 --> 02:14:37.000]
I'll run a Hubbard infomercial?

[02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.860]
Oh, di-di-di-netics, di-di-bedded diuretics.

[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.080]
Yeah, I used to be, I remember watching that really late

[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:43.340]
at night.

[02:14:43.340 --> 02:14:44.580]
They would sell you this kid.

[02:14:44.700 --> 02:14:47.700]
It had his book and writings and all those other stuff.

[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:49.380]
Pieces of his body were in there, too, I think.

[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:52.820]
And do you have the Sharon Fomercial with the fat woman?

[02:14:53.880 --> 02:14:54.920]
Does anybody remember that?

[02:14:54.960 --> 02:14:57.000]
They used to sell cosmetics, Sharon.

[02:14:57.420 --> 02:14:57.880]
That's good.

[02:14:58.220 --> 02:14:58.540]
Really, no?

[02:14:59.240 --> 02:15:00.120]
Oh, it was fantastic.

[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:01.800]
And, Neil, what did I ever do to you?

[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.200]
I'm your only fan up here.

[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:06.240]
Who the hell was that?

[02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:08.540]
Who was that?

[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:10.020]
And he hanged some, I don't know,

[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:11.640]
man must be the chronic guy from New York.

[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:12.320]
Is that who that was?

[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:13.340]
No idea.

[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:14.280]
Have we ever got a clue?

[02:15:14.340 --> 02:15:15.000]
Nor do we care less.

[02:15:15.120 --> 02:15:16.360]
Why can't you just say your material

[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:17.920]
without going through some kind of paranoid

[02:15:17.920 --> 02:15:19.720]
and making yourself look like some kind of a schmuck

[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:21.400]
and the audience is saying, ah-ha!

[02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:23.140]
There's another one of those chronic's.

[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:25.920]
Last time he called, he said the same thing.

[02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:26.440]
Remember that?

[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:28.020]
And we still don't know who the hell you are,

[02:15:28.160 --> 02:15:29.020]
or what that's all about.

[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:30.180]
And I did not talk to him.

[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:31.600]
Didn't I listen to his crap?

[02:15:31.800 --> 02:15:33.400]
Then he had something almost worth a while to say.

[02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:34.440]
So what's the problem?

[02:15:34.980 --> 02:15:35.880]
What did I redo to you?

[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:38.220]
Puts.

[02:15:39.020 --> 02:15:42.660]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T

[02:15:42.660 --> 02:15:44.020]
and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:44.620]
Miami, hello.

[02:15:46.700 --> 02:15:47.620]
Miami, yes, sir.

[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:51.800]
Yeah, I was wanting to say something about Michael Jackson.

[02:15:52.880 --> 02:15:54.820]
That, you know, I watched a little bit of that show.

[02:15:54.820 --> 02:15:56.500]
Who could watch him for two hours, I don't know.

[02:15:56.540 --> 02:15:57.500]
It was on for two hours?

[02:15:57.840 --> 02:15:58.160]
Yeah.

[02:15:58.380 --> 02:15:59.120]
Oh my God.

[02:15:59.300 --> 02:16:01.460]
And listen, you know, I kept fucking back over

[02:16:01.460 --> 02:16:03.720]
to say here a little piece of the bits of it.

[02:16:04.060 --> 02:16:06.960]
That's the one thing I never heard anybody ask him.

[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:11.060]
Is, you know, he says that he's a biological father

[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:11.740]
of these kids.

[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:12.100]
Sure.

[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.780]
And, you know, I'm not racist right now,

[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.800]
but genetically, you know, it looks like that's

[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:19.680]
an impossibility if you look at the kids.

[02:16:20.140 --> 02:16:20.340]
Yeah.

[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:23.100]
So, you know, the problem is,

[02:16:23.100 --> 02:16:24.780]
did they actually show the faces of the kids?

[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.900]
No, but you see their, your skin.

[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:28.300]
They're gone there for a while.

[02:16:28.600 --> 02:16:30.360]
Well, maybe they're like half, half and half.

[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:32.460]
And no way, me, oh, that's not.

[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:34.000]
There's not a trace.

[02:16:34.340 --> 02:16:35.240]
No, I agree with that.

[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:35.840]
I don't think he's right.

[02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.560]
I think I like one chromosome now.

[02:16:37.660 --> 02:16:38.520]
But they ask.

[02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:40.720]
The point I'm trying to make is,

[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:41.140]
what is it?

[02:16:41.500 --> 02:16:44.660]
Is that, you know, people are talking about, you know,

[02:16:45.640 --> 02:16:47.580]
him being abused with the children.

[02:16:47.980 --> 02:16:49.840]
Like, I probably agree with him.

[02:16:49.880 --> 02:16:50.180]
Yes.

[02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:52.320]
Anybody, sweet, with little boys like that.

[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:56.580]
What the deal is, you know, are these kids adopted?

[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.080]
They're talking about, is that the game taking these kids away

[02:17:00.080 --> 02:17:00.880]
from them or whatever?

[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:04.040]
You know, are they legally adopted?

[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:05.560]
Or are they his biological?

[02:17:06.380 --> 02:17:08.540]
They're supposed to be his children.

[02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:10.120]
He supposedly was the sperm donor.

[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.920]
That's what he says, but we make authorities.

[02:17:13.260 --> 02:17:13.340]
No, no, no.

[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:14.900]
I think we need a DNA test, sir.

[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:15.760]
That's the next law idea.

[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:16.860]
Let's do it right now.

[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:18.880]
Let's get childlike homes on a case right now.

[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:19.580]
DNA test.

[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:20.140]
And lie.

[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:23.780]
And look, this is 430560.

[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.600]
You weigh a few, eh?

[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:31.320]
Yeah.

[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:38.660]
Fairlaw, it needed 12 to 1 hour on WQA.

[02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:44.320]
Ladies, are you tired of unwanted hands creeping into your panties?

[02:17:44.480 --> 02:17:47.280]
Unwanted hands creeping where they shouldn't be?

[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:47.940]
Uh-huh.

[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:50.040]
Then you need Vagilmatic.

[02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:51.020]
That's your pant.

[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:54.160]
It's the first feminine protection that really helps.

[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:55.800]
Oh, run.

[02:17:56.080 --> 02:17:57.340]
Yes, that feels good.

[02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:59.120]
Oh, baby, let's do it.

[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:00.920]
Yeah, work it sugar.

[02:18:01.200 --> 02:18:01.800]
No, wait.

[02:18:02.460 --> 02:18:03.040]
Come on, kitten.

[02:18:03.900 --> 02:18:04.280]
No.

[02:18:04.940 --> 02:18:06.020]
But what, you dinner?

[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.580]
Let me just, let me just,

[02:18:11.300 --> 02:18:14.200]
You see, Vagilmatic is fantastic.

[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:15.280]
It really works.

[02:18:15.500 --> 02:18:17.160]
It's good against muggers, rapists, drug husbands,

[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:20.120]
priests, horny uncles, and Martina never to loavers.

[02:18:20.980 --> 02:18:21.380]
No!

[02:18:22.520 --> 02:18:24.660]
Let me just get this on your feet.

[02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:25.960]
Oh, no!

[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:30.740]
Vagilmatic and coming soon for the fellas, it's cockatoo.

[02:18:31.620 --> 02:18:32.020]
Fantastic.

[02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:34.900]
Come at clock at 5'60, WQA.

[02:18:34.940 --> 02:18:36.240]
That's not even the one that I thought I was playing.

[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:37.400]
I thought was the Bob and Tom one.

[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.580]
Right, which isn't in there.

[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:40.020]
Well, it'll have to do.

[02:18:40.760 --> 02:18:43.140]
The best place to find anti-bush material on the internet

[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:46.300]
is www.smurkingchimp.com.

[02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:48.200]
The guy that called before.

[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:48.760]
It's a date.

[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:50.740]
What?

[02:18:51.320 --> 02:18:52.540]
Vagilmatic, the Bob and Tom one.

[02:18:53.420 --> 02:18:54.000]
Right, it is.

[02:18:55.420 --> 02:18:57.280]
But I bet it's called veg, uh,

[02:18:57.320 --> 02:18:58.000]
No, it's right under it.

[02:18:58.220 --> 02:18:59.260]
You just need to go down one more.

[02:18:59.300 --> 02:18:59.700]
It is.

[02:19:01.840 --> 02:19:02.740]
One moment, please.

[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:03.620]
This is important.

[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:05.940]
I found important at all, which I wish to have.

[02:19:05.940 --> 02:19:06.520]
Very important.

[02:19:06.580 --> 02:19:07.440]
Oh, there it is, Bob and Tom.

[02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:10.220]
Smurkingchimp.com.

[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:12.720]
I've ever t-shirted as the impeached bush and chiny to it.

[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:13.120]
OK.

[02:19:14.320 --> 02:19:15.820]
But here's the important stuff.

[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:18.200]
If we were to get back to all this hysteria

[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:19.480]
that some people are promulgating here.

[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:21.920]
As far as I know, this is the first time

[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:23.720]
the complete story of the Popeo Ronco products

[02:19:23.720 --> 02:19:25.920]
has been told somebody got me this from the internet.

[02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.440]
Says Tim Samuels, incurator of the upcoming.

[02:19:28.800 --> 02:19:30.840]
But wait, there's more exhibit at Napa's American Center

[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:31.940]
for wine, food, and arts.

[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:33.960]
author of the just released book of the same name.

[02:19:34.640 --> 02:19:36.520]
Basically it goes from a table out on the streets

[02:19:36.520 --> 02:19:37.440]
and national television.

[02:19:37.840 --> 02:19:39.620]
Most people don't realize the complexity of this story,

[02:19:39.620 --> 02:19:41.060]
how the product of people in the salesman

[02:19:41.060 --> 02:19:41.740]
are all tied together.

[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:44.680]
The Popeo family combined vaudevillian showmanship

[02:19:44.680 --> 02:19:47.580]
with ingenious product design beginning with modestyles

[02:19:47.580 --> 02:19:49.800]
such as the glass knife, it's always sharp.

[02:19:50.240 --> 02:19:52.580]
And leading up to Ronco's Showtime rotisserie in barbecue,

[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.660]
which you've very likely seen expert demonstrated

[02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:56.400]
by on QBCBus creator Ron Popeo.

[02:19:56.640 --> 02:19:58.900]
Ron Popeo is the Ron in Ronco.

[02:19:59.320 --> 02:20:00.620]
See, we're right about that.

[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:04.060]
But his father Samuel S.J. Popeo

[02:20:04.060 --> 02:20:06.360]
and his uncle Raymond Popeo were the old manic men

[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:07.440]
as in the Vedramatic.

[02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.880]
The family dynasty grew literally on the streets

[02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:12.420]
as Chicago says Samuel's in by people in the Popeo family

[02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:14.000]
selling goods and outdoor markets,

[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:16.600]
county fairs and auto shows, salesman manned the tables

[02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:18.640]
and through mesmerizing gestures and motions gathered

[02:20:18.640 --> 02:20:20.440]
people around them, they were all little products

[02:20:20.440 --> 02:20:22.060]
that were designed so a pitchman could take a suitcase

[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:24.160]
full of them, haul them to the side and sell them.

[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:26.600]
The products got larger and more complicated.

[02:20:26.820 --> 02:20:29.440]
They were more saleable on TV and given flashy names

[02:20:29.440 --> 02:20:30.940]
and the most famous being the Vegematic.

[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:32.940]
In the process their products and members

[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:35.980]
of the Popeo family became international popular culture heroes.

[02:20:36.800 --> 02:20:38.660]
Popeo family history is sensationalistic

[02:20:38.660 --> 02:20:41.140]
and preposterous enough to be the makings

[02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:44.840]
of an epic novel and on written missionary salesman.

[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:50.580]
This is really poor, Pauliward.

[02:20:51.160 --> 02:20:52.720]
Nathan Morris, well it's because you know

[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:53.700]
where the punctuation is.

[02:20:54.080 --> 02:20:55.420]
Nathan Morris, S.J. Zunkel,

[02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:58.320]
Soul Kitchen Gadgets on the Jersey Boardwalks in 1958,

[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:01.220]
S.J. Popeo sued him for patent infringement.

[02:21:01.620 --> 02:21:03.400]
Popeo believed that Morris's roto chop,

[02:21:03.580 --> 02:21:05.860]
oh I remember that, remember he used to turn

[02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:07.300]
and we had the little plunger on top,

[02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:09.140]
it was the last thing you put your statement with term.

[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:11.660]
The roto chop took place your remember zone chop,

[02:21:11.780 --> 02:21:13.100]
dramatic Morris was upset with his nephew,

[02:21:13.320 --> 02:21:15.780]
feeling he was ungrateful for the break in gadget sales

[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.900]
in a courtroom, Morris suffered a sudden heart attack

[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:19.840]
and a guilt riddled estate settled the case.

[02:21:20.120 --> 02:21:21.680]
Only to have his uncle miraculously recovered

[02:21:21.680 --> 02:21:22.500]
the very next day.

[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:26.620]
S.J. Popeo, likewise got his son Ron Popeo

[02:21:26.620 --> 02:21:29.220]
started in the business that cast him out of the family

[02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:30.500]
when Ron began Ronco.

[02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:34.140]
But it was Ron who came to outshine them all.

[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:35.560]
He's the one with the autobiography,

[02:21:35.560 --> 02:21:37.360]
the salesman of the century and you can buy it

[02:21:37.360 --> 02:21:38.460]
straight from Ronco if you like.

[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:42.480]
Ronco is television spots home to fast talking perfection,

[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:45.220]
adapted classic pitchman techniques such as the countdown

[02:21:45.800 --> 02:21:48.020]
which you can still witness in Ron Popeo's QBC spots

[02:21:48.020 --> 02:21:49.380]
talking in the showtime or at the history,

[02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:51.740]
you're not gonna pay $320 for this product,

[02:21:52.020 --> 02:21:53.400]
you're not even gonna pay $220 says,

[02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:55.960]
then counts down to four easy payments of $39.95.

[02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:58.080]
And of course there's always the bonus product,

[02:21:58.300 --> 02:21:59.260]
but wait there's more.

[02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.740]
The promotion on television seemed absolutely

[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:04.800]
resistible so Samuel and in case of the

[02:22:04.800 --> 02:22:06.320]
Vegematic 11 million of them were sold

[02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:08.380]
within 10 years of their introduction in 1951.

[02:22:08.740 --> 02:22:10.140]
I turn up examples of them all the time

[02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:11.020]
and they always still work.

[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:13.660]
I think the very nature of the fame of the Popeo family

[02:22:13.660 --> 02:22:15.180]
and their products is everybody or their parents

[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:17.660]
or relatives has some Popeo related product tucked away

[02:22:17.660 --> 02:22:18.360]
in their closet.

[02:22:18.700 --> 02:22:20.200]
That's the operative part, not using it,

[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:21.560]
but it's tucked away in a closet.

[02:22:22.960 --> 02:22:23.360]
Amen.

[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:25.460]
Getting pretty crowded in there.

[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:27.260]
Here's Miami, hello.

[02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:29.440]
Miami.

[02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:30.200]
Neil.

[02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:30.720]
Yes sir.

[02:22:31.080 --> 02:22:31.500]
How you doing?

[02:22:31.500 --> 02:22:31.960]
Okay.

[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:34.320]
You ever hear the product, Nads?

[02:22:35.000 --> 02:22:35.620]
What is it?

[02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:35.940]
Commercial?

[02:22:36.240 --> 02:22:36.560]
Nads.

[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:37.720]
We talked about it earlier.

[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:39.020]
Nads?

[02:22:39.420 --> 02:22:40.080]
Oh Nads yeah.

[02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:43.220]
Yeah, you know, the name is just too much.

[02:22:43.260 --> 02:22:44.420]
I don't know who came up with that one.

[02:22:44.500 --> 02:22:45.760]
You know, it's put a little nads on you.

[02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:46.240]
Nads.

[02:22:46.240 --> 02:22:47.340]
They can tightly hair off.

[02:22:47.600 --> 02:22:47.760]
Yeah.

[02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:49.680]
You know, on your copper lip, you know,

[02:22:49.760 --> 02:22:50.800]
the women is just crazy.

[02:22:51.960 --> 02:22:52.240]
That's about the most.

[02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:53.680]
Oh, trusty Nads.

[02:22:53.780 --> 02:22:54.220]
Okay, thanks.

[02:22:55.640 --> 02:22:57.720]
567-0560, pound 560, we're asking

[02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:59.060]
what's your favorite T-in for commercial?

[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.480]
175 people, almost 41%

[02:23:01.480 --> 02:23:03.540]
of this crowd hate all infomercials.

[02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.820]
They want a puke when they see one.

[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:06.060]
They want a vomit.

[02:23:07.500 --> 02:23:09.020]
Girls gone wild videos, 91.

[02:23:09.880 --> 02:23:12.000]
Ron Popeel Showtime with his Vibarvacue 23.

[02:23:12.380 --> 02:23:14.120]
The Ron Popeel Pocket Fisherman 15.

[02:23:14.980 --> 02:23:17.260]
A lot of guys reaching into pocket fishing for it right now.

[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:20.340]
The five masters, Susan Summers,

[02:23:20.520 --> 02:23:23.100]
blew a five thing 12, George Foreman,

[02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:25.200]
grilled the, a bleed mean grilling machine 11.

[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:28.280]
And nine people, never saw one.

[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:30.800]
And a single digits from down on there.

[02:23:30.800 --> 02:23:31.820]
Well, there's so many of them, you know,

[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.060]
from Homeland Security to the attorney general.

[02:23:36.620 --> 02:23:39.100]
And based on that information, we understand,

[02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:41.400]
recommendation was made to the president.

[02:23:41.440 --> 02:23:42.240]
He didn't disagree.

[02:23:42.520 --> 02:23:44.380]
So we do expect that announcement at 12.30.

[02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:47.160]
David, is it coincidental or not coincidental

[02:23:47.160 --> 02:23:50.000]
that this is happening perhaps on the eve

[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.080]
of the US war against Iraq?

[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.880]
You know, I talked to officials about a lot

[02:23:55.880 --> 02:23:58.140]
about whether they think there is the possibility

[02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:03.140]
of terrorism by, stimulated by the Mukbarat,

[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:05.440]
the Iraqi intelligence service,

[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:07.820]
whether the Iraqis, perhaps in Kahut's

[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:09.880]
with terrorist groups might organize something.

[02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:13.460]
The response I tend to get is, officials saying,

[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:17.440]
look, the Iraqi intelligence service is not all that terrific.

[02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:19.420]
It is fairly well watched.

[02:24:20.300 --> 02:24:23.040]
It's not something we worry a lot about.

[02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:26.380]
Sure, we watched them, but we're not really expecting

[02:24:26.380 --> 02:24:27.620]
it to come from that quarter.

[02:24:27.840 --> 02:24:30.340]
And frankly, a number of officials saying they believe

[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:34.660]
that al-Qaeda would attack the US anytime it could

[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:38.380]
without regard to any war in Iraq or frankly,

[02:24:38.500 --> 02:24:39.420]
many other factors.

[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:41.340]
But it sure does make a good excuse, don't it?

[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:43.340]
Well, here's Mike the old man,

[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:44.640]
who doesn't even look for a few plugged today,

[02:24:44.680 --> 02:24:45.020]
isn't that nice?

[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:47.360]
He says, I have the rotisserie,

[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:49.160]
machine works great and always comes out juicy.

[02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.960]
I have the original machine 175 bucks years ago.

[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.640]
I saw a little bit of Michael,

[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:55.300]
last night had to run to the cannon,

[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:57.900]
Schmidt and Pukh, that guy is a freak, kids aren't his.

[02:24:58.220 --> 02:24:58.780]
Okay, very good.

[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:00.540]
Mike, kids aren't his.

[02:25:03.420 --> 02:25:06.000]
5670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:07.160]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello.

[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:08.680]
Yeah, how about Tai Bo?

[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:09.840]
Got it.

[02:25:10.320 --> 02:25:11.880]
Okay, and I'm quite.

[02:25:12.020 --> 02:25:12.800]
How about Bo Griffin?

[02:25:17.220 --> 02:25:18.640]
Tell us something we don't know.

[02:25:19.100 --> 02:25:20.140]
Biloxi, Mrs. Cipi?

[02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:22.220]
Yeah, hey, Neil, good morning.

[02:25:22.220 --> 02:25:23.540]
Yes sir, good afternoon.

[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:25.540]
Yeah, I was down in the Cuban Republic,

[02:25:25.540 --> 02:25:27.140]
they come up and take care of my parents,

[02:25:27.260 --> 02:25:29.000]
they're both sick, so I'm up in the red neck.

[02:25:29.000 --> 02:25:29.740]
Sorry to hear that.

[02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:31.040]
Yeah, that's all right.

[02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:34.160]
I was talking to you, I went to New Orleans

[02:25:34.160 --> 02:25:36.400]
and they had the original Ruth Kristaikas,

[02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:37.080]
what a place.

[02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:38.760]
Yeah, the best food in the world.

[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:41.420]
Anyway, the infomercial you was talking about,

[02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:44.180]
the Gensus gotta be one of the best products ever, right?

[02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:44.340]
Right.

[02:25:44.940 --> 02:25:45.620]
That's what I think.

[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:47.420]
But anyways, I'm getting you on here

[02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:48.860]
and not keeping up about it.

[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:50.000]
Okay, and you two, thanks a lot.

[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:50.560]
Take care.

[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:52.140]
Hurry on back if you like or if not.

[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:55.260]
Five, six, seven, maybe don't want to come back down here.

[02:25:55.340 --> 02:25:56.440]
In fact, a lot of people right now

[02:25:56.440 --> 02:25:58.680]
are planning trips to like Geneva, New York,

[02:26:00.120 --> 02:26:02.840]
Rand Rapids, Michigan, under their bed,

[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:03.680]
Muskegon,

[02:26:06.020 --> 02:26:06.380]
Decalde,

[02:26:08.300 --> 02:26:09.020]
how Indiana,

[02:26:10.640 --> 02:26:11.480]
what's wrong with these?

[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:12.380]
Nothing.

[02:26:12.520 --> 02:26:14.000]
I'm talking about places at all, Burma,

[02:26:14.120 --> 02:26:14.680]
St. Tussitz,

[02:26:15.320 --> 02:26:16.760]
places where they're not gonna be like

[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:18.000]
in North Carolina.

[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:18.680]
That would be good.

[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:23.360]
In Yovic?

[02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:24.680]
In my what?

[02:26:25.160 --> 02:26:25.560]
In Yovic.

[02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:26.800]
It's like way up in Canada.

[02:26:26.940 --> 02:26:28.080]
I'm way up there.

[02:26:28.220 --> 02:26:28.460]
Mooster.

[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:29.440]
Mooster would be good.

[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:30.240]
That is a mess in it.

[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:31.160]
Iron City.

[02:26:33.540 --> 02:26:34.940]
All these things sound good.

[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:37.960]
Eight minutes after noon at 5.60 WQM,

[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:39.180]
if you're wondering if you tune in to mainstream,

[02:26:39.200 --> 02:26:40.020]
we don't want to get you nervous,

[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:42.520]
but, and either there's your government, of course,

[02:26:42.660 --> 02:26:43.660]
they don't want you to get all panicky.

[02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:44.720]
They don't want to ruin your weekend,

[02:26:44.720 --> 02:26:48.080]
but the terror threat will be raised to orange.

[02:26:48.420 --> 02:26:48.660]
So, you know,

[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:48.660]

[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:48.660]

[02:26:49.080 --> 02:26:50.480]
today, they've leveled a high.

[02:26:50.580 --> 02:26:52.080]
A lot of people are gonna be getting high today,

[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:53.320]
based on what they're saying.

[02:26:54.300 --> 02:26:55.920]
And Tom Ridge and John Ascrop,

[02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:58.200]
and who could have two better spokesmen than those two,

[02:26:58.340 --> 02:26:59.500]
will be coming out of 1230.

[02:26:59.580 --> 02:27:00.720]
We'll cure a little bit of it from CNN

[02:27:00.720 --> 02:27:02.260]
until we can't take it anymore, right?

[02:27:02.860 --> 02:27:03.920]
Or until we have to take a break.

[02:27:05.880 --> 02:27:07.060]
Isn't that what comes first?

[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:10.020]
We could do all the breaks in the first half hour,

[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:10.640]
then just leave.

[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:11.500]
Oh.

[02:27:12.100 --> 02:27:13.580]
See, there George goes again.

[02:27:13.680 --> 02:27:14.900]
Okay, his behavior today, I think,

[02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:17.180]
is probably reached in all time low and Carlos agrees.

[02:27:17.180 --> 02:27:19.620]
You have been just outrageous today,

[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:21.920]
starting out defending, I pedify,

[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:24.500]
and making excuses for him,

[02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:25.640]
and then calling the president,

[02:27:25.800 --> 02:27:27.160]
painting that little mustache on him,

[02:27:27.360 --> 02:27:30.020]
and now trying to get out of here early.

[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:32.280]
We've only got 50 minutes and 35 seconds,

[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:33.200]
he's going out, that I'm counting.

[02:27:33.460 --> 02:27:34.060]
50 minutes.

[02:27:34.440 --> 02:27:34.500]
I'm counting.

[02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:38.280]
You know, guys, what women really want at Valentine's Day

[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:40.320]
is for you to put a little fun creativity into your gift.

[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:43.420]
This year, express yourself in a fun and original way

[02:27:43.420 --> 02:27:44.520]
and say it with the Vermont Tenibir.

[02:27:44.760 --> 02:27:46.180]
Just call 1-800-829,

[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:47.480]
bear in a friendly bear counselor,

[02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.300]
we'll help you choose from over 100 bears.

[02:27:50.300 --> 02:27:51.720]
They're all handcrafted in Vermont,

[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:53.800]
and delivered in a colorful gift box

[02:27:53.800 --> 02:27:55.100]
with a free card in chocolate, too.

[02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:56.800]
That'd be another place to hide in Vermont,

[02:27:57.160 --> 02:27:58.660]
and you'd always get a lot of Ben and Jerry's there, too.

[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:01.260]
Tell her she lights your fire with a new burn-in love bear,

[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:03.760]
dress like a hunky fireman who'd love to have two on his arm,

[02:28:04.020 --> 02:28:06.000]
or say I'm wild about you with a younger love bear.

[02:28:06.400 --> 02:28:08.960]
They even have an officially licensed love meat tender Elvis Bear.

[02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:11.140]
Send a government teddy bear as a creative and personal

[02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:12.040]
alternative to flowers,

[02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:14.080]
and it'll be around long after Valentine's Day

[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:14.860]
to remind her of you.

[02:28:14.860 --> 02:28:16.180]
Send a bear to the office,

[02:28:16.320 --> 02:28:18.480]
where coworkers can see how thoughtful and romantic

[02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:19.500]
you're pretending to be.

[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.600]
Over night in Valentine's Day, delivery guaranteed,

[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:24.020]
so call 1-800-829-Bair,

[02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:26.260]
or shop online at VermontTeddyBair.com.

[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:27.220]
This year, do something different,

[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.680]
something creative, something she'll appreciate for a long time.

[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:32.360]
Shout out to all the Vermont Teddy Bear for Valentine's Day.

[02:28:32.460 --> 02:28:36.520]
Tell them that old Neal told you to call 1-800-829-BEAR.

[02:28:37.100 --> 02:28:38.180]
Five and a local,

[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:40.160]
this is five sixes.

[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:41.880]
The radio's on your side.

[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:43.860]
She's a huge fan.

[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:48.040]
Why the... you bastard?

[02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:51.900]
A new study by the Kinsey Institute

[02:28:51.900 --> 02:28:53.580]
claims that today's modern woman

[02:28:53.580 --> 02:28:55.240]
doesn't have time for sex.

[02:28:55.720 --> 02:28:57.660]
With a job, the kids end up shopping

[02:28:57.660 --> 02:28:59.720]
you're just too busy to get mosaic.

[02:29:00.760 --> 02:29:02.900]
But now, thanks to this amazing new offer,

[02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:05.040]
you can feel like you just got some anytime.

[02:29:05.580 --> 02:29:08.000]
Be open to shenanoses, sex on tape.

[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:09.580]
Now you can hear the same things

[02:29:09.580 --> 02:29:11.240]
you hear during Neal's sex anytime.

[02:29:11.240 --> 02:29:13.260]
Chapter 1, playful flirting.

[02:29:13.800 --> 02:29:16.100]
Hey, you can vacuum later, come here.

[02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:18.140]
Chapter 2, setting the moon.

[02:29:18.640 --> 02:29:20.580]
So, uh, you wanna do it?

[02:29:20.860 --> 02:29:22.180]
Chapter 3, war play.

[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.480]
Three up, half times almost over.

[02:29:24.900 --> 02:29:26.640]
And chapter 4, after glow.

[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:30.000]
Sex on tape.

[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:32.240]
It's just like sex without the orgasm.

[02:29:32.540 --> 02:29:33.840]
Just like being with a real man.

[02:29:34.580 --> 02:29:36.060]
Pick up sex on tape today.

[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:37.640]
From big love to sex.

[02:29:37.640 --> 02:29:39.180]
Other not sex.

[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:41.020]
I'm just calm down, Mo.

[02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:42.040]
I guess you got a little worked up too

[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:42.940]
about the orange alert.

[02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:46.320]
I think I guess you thought I had something

[02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:47.120]
to do with his hair piece.

[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:48.900]
Wouldn't have been something of fun

[02:29:48.900 --> 02:29:50.040]
if he came, that a great,

[02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:53.000]
based on the color that it is.

[02:29:53.140 --> 02:29:53.480]
Exactly.

[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:55.520]
Orange, I can see it now.

[02:29:55.880 --> 02:29:57.820]
Maybe he's out getting at the Citrus die maker

[02:29:57.820 --> 02:29:58.660]
having it done right now.

[02:29:59.540 --> 02:30:00.200]
1230, don't forget.

[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:02.340]
We got not only Tom Marginjana S. Crop,

[02:30:02.380 --> 02:30:04.940]
but Robert Mueller, the director of the FBI,

[02:30:05.080 --> 02:30:05.720]
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I,

[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:08.080]
of activation of National Guard

[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:11.740]
and reserve units by the Pentagon in recent weeks.

[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:13.180]
I think you know, she has a list I've never

[02:30:13.180 --> 02:30:13.960]
noticed that before.

[02:30:14.160 --> 02:30:16.980]
Whoever she is that does the CNN Pentagon reporting.

[02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:18.500]
Anyway, here's the thing somebody

[02:30:18.500 --> 02:30:22.700]
fast-me-1999 from the Crime Watch Consumer Fraud Watch Network

[02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:24.580]
in commercial guru William McCorkill

[02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:25.720]
and his wife, Reed Centenste and Orlando

[02:30:25.720 --> 02:30:28.200]
to 24 years, four months for a swindling real estate

[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:28.640]
customer.

[02:30:28.920 --> 02:30:29.820]
This is four years ago.

[02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:31.560]
McCorkill appeared stoic and wife,

[02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:34.020]
Shen Tell Quiet silently in response to US history

[02:30:34.020 --> 02:30:36.720]
judge Patricia Fossett, sentenced for scamming thousands

[02:30:36.720 --> 02:30:38.260]
of people out of $28 million.

[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:41.040]
Two of McCorkill's associates were sentenced

[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.600]
early on the day to five years each for fraud conspiracy.

[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:44.360]
How do you like that?

[02:30:44.660 --> 02:30:45.820]
Makes you wonder how all these other

[02:30:45.820 --> 02:30:47.020]
fakers get away with it on there?

[02:30:47.900 --> 02:30:48.700]
They're just slicker.

[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:49.500]
Is that it?

[02:30:49.820 --> 02:30:50.500]
Better common?

[02:30:51.580 --> 02:30:52.380]
Here's Pompato.

[02:30:52.480 --> 02:30:52.660]
Hello?

[02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:54.300]
Hello?

[02:30:54.520 --> 02:30:54.860]
Yes, sir?

[02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:57.880]
Did anybody mention the floaty?

[02:30:58.180 --> 02:30:58.360]
Yeah.

[02:30:59.120 --> 02:31:00.860]
Oh, because I need one.

[02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:01.680]
I need a haircut.

[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:03.380]
Well, get to.

[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:05.200]
We have this guy with Greg Read can use one too.

[02:31:07.020 --> 02:31:09.240]
5670560, he knows his hair is like fallen out in chunks.

[02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:10.400]
Clumps.

[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:12.400]
Yeah.

[02:31:12.920 --> 02:31:14.540]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:31:14.540 --> 02:31:15.460]
It just seems strange.

[02:31:15.480 --> 02:31:18.180]
Maybe it's just that he's reached that time of his life

[02:31:18.180 --> 02:31:19.600]
or who knows what it is.

[02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:23.280]
5670560, pound 560.

[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:24.620]
Of course, there are a lot of the people who

[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:25.940]
are owed money by this company.

[02:31:25.980 --> 02:31:27.140]
Their hair is probably fallen out too.

[02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.200]
And they can't afford to replace it.

[02:31:29.120 --> 02:31:30.300]
They'd like to get paid someday.

[02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:35.400]
5670560, pound 560 on a AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:31:35.520 --> 02:31:36.400]
I have a feeling now.

[02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.480]
We didn't tell you to go under the bed until at least 1230,

[02:31:38.660 --> 02:31:38.840]
OK?

[02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:41.020]
Because we're still on yellow alert as of now.

[02:31:41.820 --> 02:31:44.960]
But we know that in 13 minutes and 15 seconds,

[02:31:45.140 --> 02:31:47.120]
at that point will be placed on orange alerts.

[02:31:47.720 --> 02:31:48.020]
You got 13.

[02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:49.080]
Maybe that's what they're doing.

[02:31:50.040 --> 02:31:53.180]
They got 13 minutes left to have a good time between now

[02:31:53.180 --> 02:31:53.700]
and 1230.

[02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:54.800]
So they might be working on it.

[02:31:56.260 --> 02:31:56.980]
Here's Weston.

[02:31:57.040 --> 02:31:57.200]
Hello?

[02:31:58.000 --> 02:31:58.260]
Hello?

[02:31:58.580 --> 02:31:58.900]
Yes, sir?

[02:31:59.120 --> 02:31:59.780]
Hey, how you doing today?

[02:31:59.780 --> 02:32:00.120]
OK.

[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:03.860]
It just says, little people have gone on.

[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:05.520]
In fact, even though I came here last,

[02:32:05.860 --> 02:32:07.360]
do you miss what was going on?

[02:32:08.160 --> 02:32:11.020]
It gets a regular person now.

[02:32:11.160 --> 02:32:12.800]
If anybody wonders, if I was in charge,

[02:32:12.940 --> 02:32:13.780]
if you think it's so much different.

[02:32:14.900 --> 02:32:15.900]
Maybe we can bring them back.

[02:32:16.160 --> 02:32:16.700]
Oh, I hope so.

[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:17.560]
OK.

[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:18.760]
I'll take care.

[02:32:19.280 --> 02:32:20.520]
Yeah, let's play the Jackson's.

[02:32:20.540 --> 02:32:21.180]
I want you back.

[02:32:22.240 --> 02:32:23.300]
And I'm a blah blah.

[02:32:23.420 --> 02:32:25.260]
Well, I see there goes where I've clintoned stuff again,

[02:32:25.380 --> 02:32:25.960]
making this political.

[02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:28.060]
Now, I have a feeling.

[02:32:28.180 --> 02:32:28.600]
It could be wrong.

[02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:32.440]
If the Constitution didn't prohibit him from running for a third term,

[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:36.500]
I think if we had an election tomorrow between George W. Bush and Bill Clinton,

[02:32:36.940 --> 02:32:38.520]
Clinton would win hands down your pants.

[02:32:38.880 --> 02:32:39.800]
Hands down.

[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:40.660]
Look at the economy.

[02:32:41.020 --> 02:32:43.420]
You look at the state of the world as we are in it right at the moment.

[02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:45.780]
We got the terror level going up through the roof.

[02:32:45.960 --> 02:32:47.700]
We got all this spirit of saber rattling.

[02:32:48.220 --> 02:32:51.340]
We got North Korea saying, hey, if you start with any more this hanky,

[02:32:51.400 --> 02:32:52.600]
punky over here in fishing around,

[02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:54.660]
you're going to open up a nuclear holocaust.

[02:32:54.780 --> 02:32:56.260]
We've got a very unstable.

[02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:00.440]
When you start rattling the spear and calling everybody evil doers and all this other stuff,

[02:33:00.520 --> 02:33:04.360]
and not doing the things behind the scenes you need to keep a little bit of a sanity in the world,

[02:33:04.660 --> 02:33:06.800]
it makes for a very nervous place in which to live.

[02:33:07.960 --> 02:33:08.840]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:33:09.260 --> 02:33:09.680]
What are you saying?

[02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:10.360]
Let's go home.

[02:33:10.740 --> 02:33:10.900]
Yeah.

[02:33:11.480 --> 02:33:11.920]
We're leaving.

[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:16.900]
But first, a call from Miami Beach.

[02:33:17.080 --> 02:33:17.080]

[02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:19.540]
Nail, you forgot K-Tail.

[02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:21.560]
Presents Petty Klein, Things to Blue.

[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:24.480]
Oh, K-Tail, if it's K-Tail, it must smell right.

[02:33:24.480 --> 02:33:25.440]
You forgot.

[02:33:25.660 --> 02:33:29.420]
They were the beginning of the Info Martyrs in back in the 70s.

[02:33:29.540 --> 02:33:30.600]
Yeah, but there's so many of them.

[02:33:30.660 --> 02:33:33.120]
I guess we can just put K-Tail music or whatever.

[02:33:33.620 --> 02:33:37.160]
They also had the record cleaner that you stood right up and it got right inside.

[02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:37.900]
That was wrong thing.

[02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:40.380]
Oh, a rock-oh-gallered side.

[02:33:40.380 --> 02:33:41.020]
Record back.

[02:33:42.080 --> 02:33:43.460]
Oh, the record back.

[02:33:43.900 --> 02:33:45.520]
Record, then rock and roll.

[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:50.020]
It's a natural fairy, and now you can hear it for the first time ever.

[02:33:50.020 --> 02:33:53.020]
S-K-Tail presents Joplin Does Joplin.

[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:57.680]
Wow, baby, baby, baby.

[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:03.640]
A brilliant music of Scott Joplin as interpreted by 60 Superstar Janus Joplin.

[02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:08.300]
Available now on Joplin Does Joplin, recorded live in Joplin, Missouri.

[02:34:08.760 --> 02:34:11.220]
Wow, I'm going to die in this battle.

[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:12.480]
I'm joking, I'm out.

[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:13.900]
I'm out of here.

[02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:19.380]
Here's a favorite, slightly pineapple rag, the maple leaf rag, and I think I'm going to hurl in my sleep rag and more.

[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:20.680]
Joplin does Joplin.

[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:22.920]
Part of the Deadmaster's collection from K-Tail.

[02:34:23.140 --> 02:34:23.840]
You asshole.

[02:34:24.380 --> 02:34:26.360]
Ponged past noon at 560 WQ.

[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:28.300]
I just had to hear that once today, you know, from O.

[02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:31.100]
Well, I'm sure we'll be back tomorrow.

[02:34:31.240 --> 02:34:33.200]
I'm sure his dog one way to do that will be resolved.

[02:34:33.360 --> 02:34:33.800]
He'll be back tomorrow.

[02:34:33.960 --> 02:34:35.100]
Gelldy, nice job this morning.

[02:34:37.340 --> 02:34:38.460]
I'm Monday, like I said.

[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:41.900]
Well, I'm starting to move ahead of myself now because I don't think we have time for the weekends anymore.

[02:34:41.940 --> 02:34:42.140]
No.

[02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:46.760]
Because time could be running out based on some of the things that we're hearing right now.

[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:51.200]
And I have a feeling what they're going to tell us is they have no specificity.

[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.860]
They have nothing specific, not that they never, never have.

[02:34:55.440 --> 02:35:03.100]
So you'd have to wonder why they're bringing in all of these other things, you know, about biological and chemical attacks and all of these other things.

[02:35:04.100 --> 02:35:04.740]
Just cause.

[02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:07.140]
Just to raise that level of consciousness.

[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:08.940]
Just to make us a little bit more.

[02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:10.700]
Keep us on our toes, our leveled.

[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:15.880]
I mean, in other words, if they're going to drop nuclear weapons and we do hide under the desk like they've taught us back during the cold war.

[02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:18.220]
I don't think that'll probably do too much good, you know.

[02:35:18.660 --> 02:35:22.140]
All your kids out there when they start when you see the mushroom cloud, hide under your desk.

[02:35:22.900 --> 02:35:25.940]
Get your books and corner of the desk and we'll let you know when it's safe to come out.

[02:35:26.100 --> 02:35:28.660]
That was too late for that, but did they actually show those things in school?

[02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:30.620]
Because they showed them after the fact like on cable.

[02:35:30.700 --> 02:35:30.900]
Yeah.

[02:35:30.900 --> 02:35:31.680]
All those movies.

[02:35:31.800 --> 02:35:32.120]
Oh yeah.

[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:33.080]
Duck and cover.

[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:33.800]
Absolute.

[02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:34.500]
Sure.

[02:35:35.220 --> 02:35:36.240]
Climb out of the desk.

[02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:37.800]
Did you actually do the drills?

[02:35:38.060 --> 02:35:38.220]
No.

[02:35:38.460 --> 02:35:39.020]
Oh, alright.

[02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.140]
We did fire drills though.

[02:35:41.140 --> 02:35:41.700]
Oh yeah.

[02:35:42.240 --> 02:35:43.260]
Everybody did fire drills.

[02:35:43.580 --> 02:35:47.000]
And one time we had a gas main break in Brighton in Rochester.

[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:48.980]
I was in the high school in elementary school.

[02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:58.280]
And my mother came driving over to the school frantically hysterical as we all had kind of marched outside, dragging me out of the line, schlepping me to my aunt and Uncle's house.

[02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:00.040]
See how she loves you.

[02:36:00.040 --> 02:36:05.000]
In fact, the gas main of the thing was the house right behind us, the whole back of the house blew off in one piece.

[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:06.020]
Yeah.

[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:09.460]
The whole back of the house just blew right off.

[02:36:09.580 --> 02:36:11.040]
So you could see it was like it was like a...

[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:13.940]
When you put the food down, you fat tub of crap.

[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:15.060]
Look at Aiki.

[02:36:15.260 --> 02:36:17.100]
He's waddles in here and he picks up something with food.

[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:18.460]
What is in that box, by the way?

[02:36:19.020 --> 02:36:19.620]
Chicken strips.

[02:36:19.900 --> 02:36:20.700]
Oh, food.

[02:36:21.020 --> 02:36:22.060]
I thought it was cooking.

[02:36:22.860 --> 02:36:23.680]
Get out of here.

[02:36:24.340 --> 02:36:24.780]
Look at Aiki.

[02:36:25.060 --> 02:36:26.300]
He can't even get through the door this tub.

[02:36:26.620 --> 02:36:27.660]
Look how reddened the face he is.

[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:28.480]
Take a deep breath.

[02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:29.540]
Okay, it could be your last.

[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:31.900]
Man, fat boy.

[02:36:32.080 --> 02:36:32.260]
I'm sorry.

[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:33.680]
He is just... he is really...

[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:35.560]
In fact, that would be a contest which one explodes first.

[02:36:35.740 --> 02:36:36.220]
Him or the Humper.

[02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:39.180]
We're hoping it's him because we want to keep the Humper round.

[02:36:39.340 --> 02:36:40.000]
Fat boy, hopeless.

[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:42.440]
Humper not sounding too good there.

[02:36:42.660 --> 02:36:46.180]
And I'm telling you, I'm picking on him because I want him to lose that weight.

[02:36:46.200 --> 02:36:48.380]
We want to save his ass and the rest of him too.

[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:50.800]
But when I heard yesterday, I didn't...

[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:52.560]
I imagine when I heard that, I'm not making it up.

[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:54.260]
He started talking like...

[02:36:54.260 --> 02:36:56.060]
You know, I like that.

[02:36:57.200 --> 02:36:58.940]
And I thought, uh oh.

[02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:00.300]
Uh oh.

[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:04.440]
What a wicked price we pay when we get fat.

[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:09.620]
You got to pay the Piper, man.

[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:11.660]
Sooner or later, you got to pay the lemon Piper.

[02:37:12.220 --> 02:37:13.700]
Lemon sounds good as in lemon cookies.

[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:16.120]
Or lemon chiffon, lemon meringue pie.

[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:16.540]
Mmm.

[02:37:17.160 --> 02:37:17.940]
You like lemon meringue pie?

[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:18.220]

[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:19.860]
Haven't had that in a long time.

[02:37:20.100 --> 02:37:20.960]
Or a Keele empire.

[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:22.360]
Nah, Keele empire pie is okay.

[02:37:23.380 --> 02:37:26.060]
You know, there are two kinds of pie that are like sickeningly sweet.

[02:37:27.660 --> 02:37:29.300]
Keele empire and what's the other one?

[02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:32.600]
The real sweet southern Pican pie.

[02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:33.760]
Oh, oh, yeah.

[02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.360]
I do like it, but you can have like one little bite.

[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:38.760]
What are the little tiny forks that they have?

[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:40.220]
The little teeny tiny ones, you know?

[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:41.840]
You also have the shrimp forks.

[02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:42.780]
Like a shrimp forks.

[02:37:42.840 --> 02:37:45.380]
You've got to have a lot of those and eat like a little piece of Pican pie.

[02:37:45.580 --> 02:37:46.900]
And that's it because you eat more than that.

[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:47.720]
Definitely that medical one.

[02:37:47.720 --> 02:37:51.860]
You get some real homemade kind that's just got a little bit of glaze on it and a lot of Pican.

[02:37:51.860 --> 02:37:52.760]
That's a real pie.

[02:37:52.820 --> 02:37:54.240]
It's not way too sweet.

[02:37:54.300 --> 02:37:56.340]
The store bought is some whipped cream on it.

[02:37:56.340 --> 02:37:57.600]
It's a little bit syrup with a few pecans in it.

[02:37:57.660 --> 02:37:58.400]
With some whipped cream on it?

[02:37:58.500 --> 02:37:58.900]
Yeah.

[02:37:59.200 --> 02:37:59.800]
Or ice cream.

[02:37:59.980 --> 02:38:01.380]
But I do like a lemon meringue pie.

[02:38:01.780 --> 02:38:05.580]
I still say Denny's for all the fun that people make at Denny's and certainly deservedly.

[02:38:05.880 --> 02:38:08.900]
So the mother hump her pies, they're pre-named good.

[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:11.460]
You ever handled the German chocolate?

[02:38:11.620 --> 02:38:12.060]
Never handled it?

[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:12.180]
Oh, yeah.

[02:38:12.420 --> 02:38:13.320]
Mother hump her pies?

[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:17.420]
Not if I sometimes will just go and get the pie at Denny's without actually eating there.

[02:38:21.200 --> 02:38:23.160]
George is redeeming himself rapidly now.

[02:38:23.180 --> 02:38:25.020]
His family does not eat at Denny's.

[02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:27.220]
Now you're making a good comeback here.

[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:27.820]
What else I know?

[02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:28.780]
Well, come on.

[02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:29.980]
There are people who eat Lenny's.

[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:31.940]
I'm not sure I know anybody.

[02:38:32.180 --> 02:38:34.620]
I almost can't afford to eat at Denny's.

[02:38:34.640 --> 02:38:35.160]
Are you crazy?

[02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:36.060]
All the way.

[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:37.200]
He does like the dumpster out of back.

[02:38:37.420 --> 02:38:39.800]
He says he's got to see all the good crepties right now.

[02:38:40.060 --> 02:38:40.060]

[02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:43.440]
He says I love those crusts.

[02:38:43.540 --> 02:38:44.420]
Even the ones in the underwears.

[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:45.840]
Well, anyway, it's fine.

[02:38:47.360 --> 02:38:48.480]
I'm doing a food spot.

[02:38:48.580 --> 02:38:50.660]
You're talking about underwear and shirt tails in your...

[02:38:50.660 --> 02:38:51.060]
Backed home.

[02:38:51.180 --> 02:38:51.680]
Things like that.

[02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:52.040]
Uh-oh.

[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:54.400]
Firehead, Rhode Island, jewelry, plan, and yours 14.

[02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:57.300]
Final cast is what they use in the depth chambers.

[02:38:58.340 --> 02:38:59.780]
We don't think that's happened.

[02:39:00.480 --> 02:39:04.780]
The air quality I've just been told by the chief is better than what we expected.

[02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:06.620]
The hazard material team is still on site.

[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:09.140]
But the situation, the fog...

[02:39:09.140 --> 02:39:10.360]
No one like crazier there, see that?

[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:14.140]
And so things are moving to that conclude.

[02:39:14.140 --> 02:39:16.820]
So patients possibly exposed to potassium and cyanide.

[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:18.440]
Back your way to neighborhoods for a while.

[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:21.720]
And people are at our senior center now.

[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:24.660]
But over the next couple hours, I think we'll be bringing some of them back.

[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:27.060]
Although we don't want anybody in the immediate area still.

[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:27.520]
All right.

[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:31.720]
So how many people do you say are injured and how seriously injured are they?

[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:35.220]
16 people were in the...

[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:35.860]
Technic Inc.

[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:36.780]
In Rhode Island.

[02:39:36.780 --> 02:39:37.640]
Is the name of the company?

[02:39:38.180 --> 02:39:39.820]
But we think one is only...

[02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.060]
One is seriously injured.

[02:39:41.900 --> 02:39:46.020]
And so a bait, but nobody, thank God, is more seriously injured than that.

[02:39:46.060 --> 02:39:47.380]
And there's no death...

[02:39:47.380 --> 02:39:49.200]
5-8-53-51 for delivery.

[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:52.240]
That's 305-758-53-51.

[02:39:52.500 --> 02:39:55.480]
They'll deliver from 34th in Biscuit all the way to 135th in Biscuit.

[02:39:55.740 --> 02:39:57.920]
They'll go to Quasad, Cricket Club, the Jockey Club.

[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.360]
Flores even delivers as far west as 12th Avenue east of Collins in 71st.

[02:40:01.560 --> 02:40:01.980]
Give them a call.

[02:40:02.320 --> 02:40:05.120]
And if you're nice to little Judy, she'll tell you about the great pizza specials at Flores.

[02:40:05.320 --> 02:40:10.420]
Like 1399 for a large cheese pie, a liter of soda and six delicious chicken wings, all of these things.

[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:11.820]
Only 1395.

[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:15.360]
Call Flores now, 305-758-53-51.

[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:19.100]
And be sure and tell them their close personal pies on Old Neal, totally to call.

[02:40:21.600 --> 02:40:22.560]
Is him like a dirty look?

[02:40:22.680 --> 02:40:23.440]
He's gonna give him what for?

[02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:24.260]
And then hop off.

[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:26.240]
Okay, so what we're gonna do is...

[02:40:26.240 --> 02:40:27.580]
Now why aren't they there at the podium?

[02:40:27.580 --> 02:40:28.600]
Did they say 1230?

[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:29.640]
That's what they said.

[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:32.100]
I mean, if we're gonna have an end of the world, let's do it on time.

[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:33.780]
That's what they still have 30 seconds.

[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:34.520]
They do?

[02:40:35.020 --> 02:40:37.640]
Might be to say that our clock in here could be a little on the fast side?

[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:39.580]
I can't even imagine that.

[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:41.560]
Dude, they've been saying very important stuff.

[02:40:41.600 --> 02:40:42.360]
But this is more important.

[02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:43.640]
Facts just came in.

[02:40:43.740 --> 02:40:45.420]
I went to Denny's with my girlfriend about a year ago.

[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:49.860]
She was told by the waitress they just got rid of the mother butter pies and replaced them with pies by companies like Hershey,

[02:40:50.100 --> 02:40:53.460]
which by the way were awful compared to the mother butter pies by Edmoov Denny's.

[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:54.640]
Important stuff, wouldn't you think?

[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:55.480]
In fact, that's enough.

[02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:56.780]
And there ain't anybody really in her.

[02:40:56.820 --> 02:40:57.300]
I'm crushed.

[02:40:58.460 --> 02:40:58.820]
Yeah.

[02:40:59.380 --> 02:41:01.960]
So I can tell Carlos when he comes back in.

[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:03.340]
No more eating out of the dumpster at Denny's.

[02:41:03.340 --> 02:41:08.120]
The state law enforcement going and having explaining to their constituents what this means.

[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:10.540]
This is going to be a difficult period for them.

[02:41:10.900 --> 02:41:11.700]
Very difficult.

[02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:15.180]
I just spoke with the director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency.

[02:41:15.620 --> 02:41:19.400]
And they're Lieutenant Governor at 130 at the state house in Boston.

[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:20.840]
We'll also be giving a press conference.

[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:24.460]
And you will see this going on around the country, Wolf.

[02:41:24.620 --> 02:41:27.060]
And it will mean different things to different states.

[02:41:27.220 --> 02:41:33.900]
Depending on the different states, what kind of vulnerabilities they have, what kind of facilities that are located in each of the states.

[02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:37.100]
So I think it will have a different effect on different governors.

[02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.360]
And that'll trickle dawn down to the different to the cities and the mayors of the different cities.

[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:44.200]
And so it will have a profound effect most likely.

[02:41:44.340 --> 02:41:56.020]
For Michael Bloomberg and George Pataki, respectively the mayor and governor of New York, New York City and New York state, given the fact that that area has been hit on 9-11 indeed earlier as well.

[02:41:56.300 --> 02:41:58.080]
Presumably it has a greater impact.

[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:01.240]
Do you know what I'm thinking while he's two in his lips because they still aren't up there in a putting mic?

[02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:04.320]
We need the break, okay, because we don't want to miss one more than hanging.

[02:42:04.640 --> 02:42:06.080]
Everybody's hanging on the edge of their seats.

[02:42:07.480 --> 02:42:08.580]
I am low.

[02:42:09.280 --> 02:42:10.980]
This is between you and vice versa.

[02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:12.320]
You way, yeah.

[02:42:14.180 --> 02:42:16.120]
And making this dramatic announcement.

[02:42:16.400 --> 02:42:20.620]
Because once it goes to Orange, you know, once they, that thing could trip up to that red one, you know.

[02:42:20.760 --> 02:42:21.960]
So this is not a chopper.

[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:23.720]
Yeah, we're sitting there having traffic lights, haven't you?

[02:42:23.800 --> 02:42:23.960]
Right.

[02:42:23.960 --> 02:42:43.460]
So this is a level that's been in place for so long, a yellow level, which is called elevated to the orange level, which is a higher security meaning that law enforcement, some 17, 20,000 law enforcement authorities, local, state, federal around the United States have to deal with a much more serious potential threat out there.

[02:42:43.880 --> 02:42:51.360]
The reason being and we'll get some specific explanations from how credible this information is, but there were a few things that were in general.

[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:54.900]
There's got to ask Bob to come again, Robert Mueller, a three pack.

[02:42:55.600 --> 02:42:56.040]
You ready?

[02:42:56.400 --> 02:42:57.240]
Ready to self-strap in?

[02:42:59.300 --> 02:43:00.380]
Here we go.

[02:43:04.460 --> 02:43:05.540]
I'll catch you in.

[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:16.180]
The currently classified at elevated risk to increase that threat condition designation to the high risk category.

[02:43:17.180 --> 02:43:28.000]
This decision for an increased threat condition designation is based on specific intelligence received and analyzed by the full intelligence community.

[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:33.860]
This information has been corroborated by multiple intelligence sources.

[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:49.940]
Since September 11, the U.S. intelligence community has indicated that the Al Qaeda terrorist network is still determined to attack innocent Americans, both here and abroad.

[02:43:50.900 --> 02:44:02.860]
Recent reporting indicates an increased likelihood that Al Qaeda may attempt to attack Americans in the United States and or abroad in or around the end of the Hage,

[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:07.940]
a Muslim religious period ending mid-February 2003.

[02:44:09.460 --> 02:44:22.380]
Recent intelligence reports suggest that Al Qaeda leaders have emphasized planning for attacks on apartment buildings, hotels, and other soft or lightly secured targets in the United States.

[02:44:23.380 --> 02:44:44.300]
The recent bombings of a nightclub in Bali in Indonesia and of a resort hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, demonstrate the continued willingness of Al Qaeda to strike at peaceful innocent civilians and their ability to carry out attacks on such soft or lightly guarded targets.

[02:44:45.300 --> 02:44:55.760]
There are also indications bolstered by the recent arrests in London where chemical rice and was discovered.

[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:06.600]
These indications demonstrate Al Qaeda's interest in carrying out things that heightened awareness and readiness on our part deters terrorism.

[02:45:07.600 --> 02:45:21.780]
Since September 11, 2001, the United States has substantially improved its capacity to disrupt, deter, and prevent terrorist attacks against innocent Americans.

[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:32.700]
The active cooperation of the American people, your cooperation, has been instrumental in preventing major terrorist attacks.

[02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:54.680]
Since September 11, 2001, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has evaluated and investigated over 3,000 terrorist threats within the United States, issued 103 warnings to state and local law enforcement, and announced three, not including today's announcement, three major nationwide terrorist alerts.

[02:45:55.680 --> 02:46:08.100]
The threat-conditioned designation was last raised to high risk on September 10, 2002, and reduced to an elevated risk standing two weeks later.

[02:46:09.700 --> 02:46:23.780]
Today's change in the threat-conditioned designation from elevated risk to high risk will trigger a series of security precautions by the federal government as well as state and local governments and U.S. citizens

[02:46:23.780 --> 02:46:42.680]
to increase readiness to prevent terrorism. I have directed ends. As we have in the past, we ask that Americans continue their daily work and leisure activities with a heightened awareness of their environment and the activities occurring around them.

[02:46:43.640 --> 02:46:52.020]
As President Bush recounted in the State of the Union address, we have arrested or dealt with many al-Qaeda key commanders.

[02:46:53.000 --> 02:47:11.680]
3,000 suspected terrorists have been arrested worldwide. Other terrorists have met a different fate. We've uncovered and stopped terrorist conspiracies in the United States, in Yemen, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, the Straits of Hormuz, and Gibraltar.

[02:47:12.680 --> 02:47:22.580]
We've broken al-Qaeda cells around the world, and with the support of the American people, we will prevail in this war on terror.

[02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:30.860]
It's my pleasure not to introduce the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Secretary Tom Rich.

[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:57.220]
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This heightened threat level has been or is being communicated to local and state law enforcement officials, federal agencies, members of Congress, governors, state homeland security advisers, mayors,

[02:47:57.220 --> 02:48:06.360]
and those who share responsibility for the nation's private infrastructure. Information is also being provided to the nation's first responders.

[02:48:07.020 --> 02:48:11.400]
Are fire, emergency, health, environmental, and public safety personnel?

[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:27.200]
The nation's Homeland Security Advisory System provides a national framework to inform and to facilitate actions appropriate to different levels of government and to private citizens, either in their workplaces or in the United States.

[02:48:28.280 --> 02:48:37.540]
The system couples the threat level with protective measures. The shooter will be taken to reduce our country's vulnerabilities.

[02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:53.500]
As a result of the increase in the threat level, as a result of going from yellow to orange, elevated to high, specific protective measures will be taken by all federal agencies, both to reduce vulnerabilities.

[02:48:54.140 --> 02:49:04.060]
In many of them, actually, we will we believe serve as a deterrent in advance of any kind of emergency, whether it's a natural disaster or a terrorist attack.

[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:13.760]
It doesn't take a great deal of time. And I think it would make family members a lot more comfortable if they knew they were able to get in touch with one another and the events something happened.

[02:49:13.760 --> 02:49:27.160]
I think there are ways that parents and adults can certainly be better informed because as we've described to you, terrorist attacks really can potentially take many form.

[02:49:27.220 --> 02:49:34.280]
Families can be armed in advance with a kind of information that you might need and that will be critical to your health and your well-being.

[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:52.920]
And I would encourage Americans to log on to the department's website. You can log on to www.dhs.gov to learn more information to become better informed about steps that individuals can take simply to be better prepared.

[02:49:54.500 --> 02:50:11.780]
The call that we give today, which Americans have certainly heard before, is based on our knowledge and our conviction that heightened awareness and readiness deters terrorism.

[02:50:12.740 --> 02:50:19.560]
Each of us in our own ways can contribute to the security of our nation, our families, and our communities.

[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:35.260]
Today, we've got an alert public is our strongest asset. If you observe suspicious activity, I encourage you to contact your local FBI office or your local police and to report such activity.

[02:50:36.340 --> 02:50:38.340]
Thank you and let me turn it over to you, General.

[02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:43.600]
Thank you and God bless America. Okay, now this story is a little unsub-what we're still flying a Cuban flag defect.

[02:50:44.600 --> 02:50:52.760]
My impression is that it was a last-minute decision, Kenning, said they were patrolling, talking about living at the poverty line. They said, you know what, the United States is only 90 miles. The United States is only 90 miles.

[02:50:52.820 --> 02:51:01.460]
Oh, terminated communication with Cuba and headed straight here. Hey, free boat. Yeah. Edward said the man were taken in Monroe County, jail, where the return over the US of a great naturalization service.

[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:10.240]
And I and S. spokesman did immediately return a call that a Cuban who make it the US. It's that wet foot, dry foot, wet back. How ever that thing goes. Right. What is it, wet back? Well, Carlos is right here. He's the wet back.

[02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:16.720]
So there you go. So we got the undetected came up on shore park. They both walked up when they were loaded and went.

[02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:21.720]
Boy, our coast guard sure is doing it right on top of it, baby. Have no fear because the US government is here.

[02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:27.700]
My line and local, your sports video 560. See you in two way. Yeah.
