[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]
Don't forget to go on to the website and do your nominations for the dick of the year and the all dick team

Just nominate anybody want even if it's me be Zach whoever you can nominate anybody you want

[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.260]
I wonder who Neil Rogers would nominate it is his dick of the year. Let's ask him a meal

[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.340]
Who do you think this is?

[00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.180]
Who's the dick of the year?

[00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.540]
What was this happening? Was that the I bet it was Robert Creeper don't know always me. It was George done it

[00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.460]
I don't know who do you think's a dick?

[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.200]
You don't have time to hear all my suggestions. Okay. I got four hours. I listen every day

[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.200]
There's all kinds of dicks coming around you. I can especially in this building man. You don't have to leave the building

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.340]
I'm telling you dick is our middle name a QA

[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.720]
I bet you're gonna be happy to fly the hell out of here on Sunday

[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.580]
Now let me ask you this question

[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.380]
Because we've laid on your shoulder and you know see you haven't been here long enough

[00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.460]
You're catching on but you're just a little slow on this one. You said we told you I told you that you're a assignment

[00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.160]
When I leave is getting clearance laid. Yeah, and you saw that's easy. That's easy

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.760]
500 bucks. You'll owe me I'm telling a dinner and we're gonna go to the splendid blended in August when you come back

[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.140]
You owe me dinner and 500 bucks change in a subject. I'm telling you I fact I will pay 500 bucks to your charity

[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.320]
The charity of your choice if you get clearance laid between now when I come back I get listen to me

[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.000]
I will put money I can bet my op at a thousand oh I think for a thousand parents still couldn't get laid

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.900]
Not only I would also throw the beast in here, but I wouldn't want to wish

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.640]
I can't imagine the sight of that I can get the beast I can get the beast like pigs

[00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.020]
Graveling around in slump. I just can't imagine the thought of that. I can get the beast laid tonight

[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.160]
Oh, I can get the clearance laid. I will pick the day. I can do it in a life

[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.800]
24 hours is all I need and I will get them both laid in fact

[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.680]
I may get them both laid and they may end up doing each other

[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.620]
No, see we already got that going on our website. That's that's nothing new your website

[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.000]
Maybe the greatest visual thing I've ever it's better looking at 10 house all this now

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.220]
You didn't see the new picture we had the wedding picture. What's the date on it is July 11th?

[00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.560]
We're gonna turn it on right now. Let me look at it. No, it's not on the you gotta come in here. I know I really

[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.240]
Yeah, I'm sure you gotta come in here. It's not on there yet

[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.820]
Why isn't it on there because we just got a phone of our cyclist so I didn't know that your staff all had their cars

[00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.460]
Detailed downstairs by the drug dealers. Yeah, yeah

[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.680]
Hey, hey man out do they supply you anything? No

[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.860]
Girls should he drugs in car wash? No the gypsy ill pharmacy. I'll never forget that day

[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.020]
I saw the kid from Miami wearing the gypsy

[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.860]
So anyway, hey Neil have a great weekend and that it was it was really a pleasure meeting you this weekend

[00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.720]
Glad I got a chance to have you man. I'll tell you that well think welcoming with open arms and legs if I sent you

[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.480]
200 bucks a week would you send me some Toronto?

[00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.460]
Weather in the mail down here. Okay. Thanks. Yeah

[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.200]
It's Friday you

[00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.100]
I'm gonna give you an update of what took place just now off the air because I think it's important you hear this

[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.160]
Howard just called the radio station Howard David who I get along with great. I thought

[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.120]
He called me an asshole

[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:08.760]
Saying I was trying to stir it up. My point back to Howard is don't listen listen to 101.5. Let me see what age group 101.5 for Howard

[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.860]
Maybe 102.7

[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.480]
Some easily listening love music so you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids

[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:26.640]
Instead of listening and always calling the radio station. He's becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boca Howard from Boca

[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.160]
It's like you know it's okay

[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.840]
So anyway, he's he's listening so this one to get the message out and don't call my show too

[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.480]
Just for a record don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you

[00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.580]
And I don't want to hear you on the private line congratulations. You know the private line number

[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.460]
That's great, but don't call because you're not coming on this show

[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.240]
You've got you've got your three hours five to eight

[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.000]
Monday through Friday you can talk all you want but you're not coming on this show

[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.640]
And we'll leave it at that

[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.240]
All right, I got nothing against you you seem like a decent person

[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.700]
And I know you've been getting it taken a big hit on the radio station from everybody else

[00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.620]
But it's over me and you done

[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.700]
Okay, where does for all have this thing going on our website does he have his own website

[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.080]
die

[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.860]
Well shouldn't we fight out

[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.200]
From hey clearance all clear. It's a busy. I'm sure he's on qs getting busy the information in there. Okay. He's getting it all down

[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.640]
I'm serious that I'd like to vote for dick of the year on magas. I can do that anywhere I am

[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.380]
Venerable go out there and fight out by the way look what I held on to here

[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.160]
He doesn't nobody is well. I will

[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.900]
We'll tell you when he comes back in anyway George Oson apology a major apology before we start to show today

[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.620]
A big fat major apology to my good personal friends at city-length magazines

[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.900]
Can't believe what you said about that me. They

[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.360]
shameful

[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.900]
Yeah, you want to start apologizing now or until he comes back

[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.640]
I

[00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.860]
Didn't say anything about them except that I didn't read that had you didn't you said that they should only rot and hell and that they're a bunch of assholes

[00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:04.620]
I said they're promoting

[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.940]
Uh pirate radio and as much as stuff like that. I thought you said that I said that

[00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.620]
Anyway, so come to fight and see that it's not really anybody's fault except of course from inside this building. I mean it's so lame

[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.920]
So freaking lame if we had anybody paying attention to business and what's going on now?

[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.340]
They're all whipped up and excited about wow for us got that big piece next week, which is great. I love that

[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.320]
Get some good publicity for him and for the station in city-length although nobody reads it

[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.320]
But the issue last week and it's also the audience the negative audience

[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.900]
I'm always the one our nails so negative. I'm not negative you people are negative

[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.340]
Usually before the issue even comes out people are calling us up with what's in it and whatnot

[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.980]
So the only thing that I got was that page with the best a the best radio personality and that's the schfarzer from the

[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.520]
Pirate radio station whatever that was whoever was the Michael Michael motorcycle

[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.740]
And in the meantime here's a whole section hall of fame and I've asked for days now ever since I've been back

[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.580]
I've been asking every day would somebody please fax this thing from the city link and see what that's really all about because they said they did something very nice for you in there

[00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.020]
And then you'd have to apologize for George Riff and the man

[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.260]
I'm so sorry come to fight out that I went because nobody faxed it nobody mailed it to me no nothing

[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:19.840]
So muff had a good suggestion this morning and it's about time you know what I mean absolutely

[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.900]
And he said how about going on their website

[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:27.000]
Citylink magazine.com and sure enough I typed it in there and there was

[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.860]
And here's last week's issue hall of fame. Oh three is the section you'll find it in and it's and let me just read the thing up front

[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.660]
Because I want to like try to get back in there go graces even though I think you probably spoil it

[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.780]
It says when it became apparent a couple of years back that certain categories always produced the same winners in the annual this annual issue

[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:52.600]
We created the city link hall of fame to an eight to ennobal them on a more elite best of best of plane and open up the categories to new talents

[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.140]
You following that?

[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:01.620]
He distracts the hell out of me. I'll tell you. He's just a mean. And by the way Carlos got laid last night. Beena boy got laid

[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.940]
How many times?

[00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:07.980]
Get out of here. Yeah four times

[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.100]
Four times

[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:11.640]
Who was he?

[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.840]
Anyway, we created the city link hall of fame to ennobal them on a more elite best of plane and open up the categories to new talents the

[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:23.760]
Criterion was simple if unscientific be it a person placed within cocktail if it was a candidate

[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.100]
We couldn't imagine publishing the issue without

[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:32.720]
Here then are the inductees from two thousand more than two thousand and two you'll find this year's inductees at the fund of each section got it

[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.560]
Got it the hall of fame for example waitress Rosemary O'Neill at Creoleenas in four lotter day. I love Rosemary, don't you?

[00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.160]
Oh, yeah, he'd be the best

[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.920]
bakery grand four no

[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:52.460]
Fort Lauderdale and then a.m. Radio personality Neil Rogers a.m. 560 WQM. It says not not a whole lot about all of them are short

[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.180]
Commercial radio doesn't completely suck in South Florida as long as Uncle Neil is on the earth said

[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:03.360]
That's sweet. That's a really nice thing. I want to thank my friends at city link profusely even though nobody reads it

[00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.740]
Thank them a lot because they didn't shine me. They didn't ignore me like you were trying to say

[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.980]
They must stick it right in me and twist it huh?

[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:13.500]
I apologize in addition to which what they're basically saying is that you know

[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.600]
If they were going to do it honestly that there's certain categories here that would be number one every single year forever

[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.300]
That's not fair. They're pushing us out which means we're getting old is what it really means

[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:29.480]
Which is true, but that's a nice touch. Thank you city link and don't forget this coming next week's issue would have a big piece on for real

[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.840]
Now speaking of a big piece

[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.320]
Beener boy he's real excited because he got laid four times last night

[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.700]
But wait doesn't understand is he's not getting paid this week again

[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.060]
What do you look at me like that for?

[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.640]
What do you say why is that?

[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.180]
Because parents doesn't like you

[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:56.880]
Ha ha ha no special reason just parents don't like you. I can't do it to him. No, no, no, he give didn't he give you this stuff?

[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:58.900]
Oh, he didn't get

[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:02.000]
I could have played that for the whole four hours

[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.040]
You are so pathetic man. We're ecstatic that you got laid 40 times last night

[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.660]
But you're just you're tragic. You're tragic. You need to be led by the hand. You need to be

[00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:16.020]
Beener boy on a leash. You need to seriously on a leash

[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:22.160]
In fact, the freaky carless will take you around on a spike leash. Oh, it'd be a beautiful thing

[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.800]
Now seriously you need to be taken around leash. I got your stub right here and the paycheck stub two

[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.840]
And I'm looking in here. I'm thinking of myself here for all the belly aching

[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.600]
Dozens squeezing money out of you and me he's a duck doing that bad for a punk

[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.600]
You making a few bucks here

[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:42.400]
I heard that

[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:47.920]
Well, that comes out about 60 cents an hour and a bad

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.720]
No, seriously you're not doing that bad. I'm talking about for this place. Okay for this place

[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.060]
Which usually whoever sits in that chair

[00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.940]
You know, they what they get is like everybody's good wishes. That's what they get. I'm paying you

[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:00.420]
wishes

[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.180]
We get those they get everybody's dirty looks is what they get

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.880]
So just to count your blessings. Okay, plus you got laid four times last night. So here's your

[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.500]
I'm gonna hold out of it for a while because otherwise you'll lose it

[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.380]
Not necessarily don't give him anything that he'll lose a goddamn thing

[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.740]
Let me do oh this is great. This is fantastic. This is gonna be such a good day

[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.180]
This is probably the only call we'll get today because there's nobody here wqa.m

[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:25.820]
Neil yes, sir

[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:31.160]
All right, there. I know it. I knew I was gonna be the person to punch Neil please retire

[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.560]
No, that is still barking at the moon and it's still there

[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:39.760]
Thank you very much for being so loyal by the way and listening every single minute of every day to the world flaming the eruditor

[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:41.140]
My

[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.380]
But she's not

[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.100]
oh

[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.140]
It's very challenging.

[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:25.240]
I will choose to continue.

[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.300]
I didn't use the crime so I don't use the time

[00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.640]
You put me in a cell then you can go to hell

[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.880]
I'll make the best of my time and my jumpsuit

[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.400]
And see if the other girls had to make wax fruit

[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.240]
Miss, who's gonna cry?

[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.360]
Just say goodbye

[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.440]
Cause you will try

[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.420]
Let's look it down

[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.820]
They look like a thug

[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.520]
And put some pictures of her busy mug

[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.100]
Marthot's 10th house

[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:51.240]
For lying like a rug

[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.140]
Stop it gonna push her like a mug

[00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.700]
Marthot's 10th house

[00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.900]
And she can go to hell

[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.920]
Unless the victim lawyer's getting prevailed

[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.000]
Why does the theft go?

[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:00.600]
And she can go to hell

[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.440]
How about going out of business, hell?

[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:03.860]
What is it?

[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.680]
1215 already

[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.780]
God damn I totally this 10 to 2 thing goes fast

[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.320]
Here could be the silliest facts I've ever gotten in my life

[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.480]
And that covers a lot of territory

[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.340]
From Craig and downtown Miami

[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:13.640]
You got quite a sense of humor Craig

[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.400]
Hey Neil, please don't go back to Toronto

[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.540]
When you're down here in Miami

[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.300]
You're funnier than when you are in Toronto

[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.240]
When you're in Toronto you're all happy and shmit

[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.100]
And it's not the same

[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.780]
Here in Miami you're pissed off and you rip into people's asses

[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.980]
And you can see what Georgian Carlos are doing and stuff

[00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.140]
So please stay here in Miami

[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.380]
Please with a bunch of exclamation parts

[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.360]
Hey Marks Craig

[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.820]
No no no no chance

[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.860]
Please stay here and be as miserable as the rest

[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:36.760]
We need it

[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.380]
Well just like that first call right out of the box

[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.600]
You know this is this like I said yesterday is a new one

[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.080]
Please retire Neil retire

[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.020]
You know this is the new guy

[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:48.400]
Just one after another the passing parade of misfits

[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.940]
Of miscreants of assholes

[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.320]
Who do and believe me the day when I will retire

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.380]
And I wish it were like tomorrow

[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:55.600]
They want to know what to do with themselves

[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.080]
Oh no

[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.920]
And speaking of I can't see I can't I'm I'm down here

[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.160]
And I can't see what they're doing anyway

[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.340]
Because being a boy got only knows what he's doing now

[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.880]
Off playing a grab ass with Zach in the hallway

[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:06.260]
There's another one couldn't get laid

[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.060]
And he's married

[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.720]
Didn't he married?

[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:09.440]
I have no idea

[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.400]
Zach I don't know

[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.320]
I think he is

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.080]
Does he have a wife?

[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:12.780]
I don't know

[00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.660]
I really don't

[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:15.040]
I mean you can't picture it though can you

[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:15.380]
I know

[00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:15.920]
I don't want to

[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.540]
But anyways so they're running around playing grab ass in the hall

[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.660]
This kid is out here if you keep forgetting the leash

[00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:24.500]
You keep forgetting the goddamn leash

[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.120]
It's a shame

[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.160]
So Craig have a great life I'm glad that you enjoy my misery

[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.460]
But the answer is absolutely

[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:30.700]
No

[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:34.240]
It's hot it's humid it's boring it's suffocating

[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.600]
It's the swamp land

[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.280]
It's the end of the world

[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.760]
Kurt Norlando says

[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.120]
Neil Redd Netator yesterday on the year

[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.320]
The only one for the day have you been able to post it on the website

[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.480]
Please try to get on it was excellent as always great show

[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.720]
Well thank you Kurt Norlando

[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.800]
But it wasn't an editorial number one

[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.160]
Number two it's not on the website because being a boy is like

[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.320]
Seriously you're gonna have to bitch him out which I'm sure you'd enjoy doing

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.300]
I have

[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:57.460]
No I need you

[00:13:57.460 --> 00:14:00.120]
He's gotta get his ass on that chair

[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:01.460]
He will not listen to me

[00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.800]
And sit the hell down

[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.780]
Listen he will not listen to me he will not listen to anyone

[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.160]
Really?

[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.040]
Listen to reason

[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.340]
Well you know what?

[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:08.920]
Here's this paste tub

[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:10.200]
It's a stub it's already in this

[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.440]
I should have just not told him about it

[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.000]
I should have just not told him about it

[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.400]
Where did it come from?

[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.560]
The stub?

[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.600]
Yeah, Clarence

[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.440]
So Clarence just laid it down?

[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:20.960]
Yeah

[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.960]
And in other words were a beaner boy couldn't find it

[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.160]
Yeah blew it we've had a really good thing going there

[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.380]
Then I guarantee him that his ass would be in that chair

[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:32.320]
But anyway didn't I say we were gonna put that on there

[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:34.460]
And I kind of put it over here where the stuff is that I you know

[00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.880]
And he's oblivious he's too busy getting laid in crap

[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.860]
He's got his own agenda

[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.700]
He is exactly your right

[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.160]
He's got his own agenda like trying to hit the muff in the face with that yo-yo

[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.200]
Or whatever that was he was sticking in muff's face

[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:47.680]
It muffs puss

[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.040]
Yeah it was disgusting

[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.900]
So anyway we will put that on the website

[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.080]
It was the declaration for the future of America Challenge for George W. Bush

[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.800]
And it's sponsored by ARM in New York

[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.820]
Whatever the hell that means

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.800]
What does that mean?

[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.800]
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna like I'm gonna staple it

[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.800]
No no seriously I'm gonna staple it to his paste tub

[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.900]
Yeah and then to his head and then to his ass

[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.080]
And then maybe do his privates

[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.700]
And then maybe in the midst of all his exciting exploits

[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.700]
Maybe he'll find it but I doubt it

[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:15.040]
Where did he go?

[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.340]
Do you want my theory?

[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.200]
Yeah what's the theory? That came in here

[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.560]
Where the hell were you? What was that all about?

[00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.360]
I gave him the rope

[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.780]
I gave these people the Valet key

[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.160]
Which is supposed to only open like

[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.420]
It can turn on the car and it goes

[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.900]
Oh Jesus Christ you know

[00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.600]
This guy in downtown Miami I'm gonna we're gonna seek him out

[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.060]
There's a guy under the overpass named Craig in downtown Miami

[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.540]
One of your friends no doubt

[00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:41.240]
Who faxes me and says please don't leave here

[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.080]
Please stand Miami you're so much more pissed off and exciting when you're down here

[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.900]
I don't want to be here I can't handle your exploits okay

[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:48.800]
Now I don't want to hear about it

[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.680]
We don't want to know

[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.360]
Sit your ass down in a chair

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.840]
Take the microwave from a sit down in the chair and shut up

[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.260]
You're making me psychotic

[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.580]
You're making me crazy

[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.760]
So I stapled to your paste tub envelope

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.840]
Here I stapled the thing that I gave you yesterday

[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.460]
Which is what some other facts are wanting to know

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:09.560]
That declaration for George W. Bush that we were gonna put on our website

[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.400]
But of course you're too busy getting laid so I stapled it right there

[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.880]
There it is okay right on top of the monitor there

[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.800]
Keep that in mind I think you're gonna ever get it but it's just it's there

[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.460]
Oh my god

[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.840]
How do you how do you how do you say it's your like I said Dr. Frankenstein

[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.780]
It's your creation you invented it

[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.180]
Well it's out of my control

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.760]
Where the hell did you find it?

[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.940]
Here's yesterday's poor result

[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.520]
And believe you me I know what's going on this today

[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.700]
Every single day you can see the law of diminishing return in this town

[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:40.060]
All you people in retail by the way good luck to you

[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.540]
So I can say how do they do it you know I don't know

[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:47.120]
How do they do it because they always say in this town if you're in business

[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.260]
If you don't do the business in most businesses

[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.040]
January through like April

[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.500]
Right if you don't like really do heavy busy gigantic business during those months

[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.340]
You're screwed

[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:03.700]
So if you don't and then comes like May and June and like right now coming up into July

[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:10.240]
You have to go through that entire period praying and waiting somehow you can survive until the so-called season starts again

[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:14.880]
In this seasonal horse and buggy town because there's nobody here now

[00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:18.160]
I could have gone bowling on a highway coming to work this morning

[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:21.040]
And then I get to like Ivesdury Road

[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:23.480]
I get to the Estadium thing there on the corner

[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.980]
I get to Ivesdury Road and generally usually it's kind of that tough left turn

[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.920]
Where they try to give as many people killed as possible

[00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.760]
Right and you know usually have to kind of look around and wait a little bit

[00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:39.540]
And all week long it's been better than usual because it is you know holidays now and kids are out of school

[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:42.080]
Everybody's gone but today it was like the defining moment

[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.900]
There was nobody there was nobody to my left there was nobody to my right there was nobody to my behind

[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:49.500]
There was nobody in front of me on the other side of the dead end there there was nobody anywhere

[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.360]
Not even a pork or on his motorcycle

[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:53.960]
There was nobody

[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.780]
But even a mooney selling flowers

[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.680]
Not even that

[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:00.940]
I had to get all the way up here to the corner by the zuri in 441 till I got to my first homeless voice box

[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.440]
Not even a black Muslim with flowers at a motel

[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.760]
That's their corner although I guess they've leased it out alternate Fridays to the homeless voice people

[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.620]
They've come to an arrangement they have a lend lease deal

[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.620]
Yesterday's pool and wait a minute let's take another one on six maybe it's the same guy WQAM

[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:16.820]
Jamba!

[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.560]
Okay see what I'm saying?

[00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.220]
That's what we're gonna get today that's all we're gonna get

[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:26.080]
So that's two for two WQAM on line nine which is never real call hello

[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:26.980]
Yes it is real call

[00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:27.540]
Is it a real call?

[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.840]
Yes it is I can't believe you

[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.380]
This is not my favorite thing about me but this is cracking down to our family

[00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.380]
I'm not a stick like Carlos I mean they grew up but listen

[00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:37.180]
You ever used to watch the very standard show?

[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.680]
I hated that show was ridiculous I can't stand him

[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:44.420]
Because the reason why I said it because because pain equals funny

[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.680]
And I'm pretty sure George used to watching with his George like it

[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.700]
George hated it

[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.720]
What was wrong with it?

[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.480]
I just I got I saw it over a weekend on Memorial Day

[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:53.080]
That was all

[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.480]
I saw it over a Memorial Day one on Memorial Day and I thought it was great I got hooked on it right away

[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:02.580]
Well see there goes to show you that's another reason I'm not staying here is because of people with tastes like yours great

[00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:04.080]
I can't handle it it's an awful show

[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.400]
Okay well you know I mean when you're down here like I'm saying about the facts when you're down here it's great

[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.160]
I mean if you know

[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:13.480]
No no it's not great it's great for you because you have the feeling that I'm suffering

[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.220]
And I don't want to suffer just to make you happy

[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.680]
Okay great I'll see you at 10 number three

[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:22.060]
Okay okay I think I made him feel bad good good

[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.320]
No see I don't take instructions from the audience like retired no stay here no

[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.140]
It's a radio show it's free

[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:35.040]
Obviously you're loving it every one of you on there you wouldn't be listening right now even more

[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:40.060]
He's listening you think a guy like him with all the money he's making which is like a gift at this point at this stage of his life

[00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:44.100]
You think he'd be like you know out there on the course right now getting ready for a big weekend

[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:49.600]
I heard him say this morning he's going to be like playing golf tomorrow on golf on Sunday and maybe he'll think about coming in on Monday

[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.540]
You know don't don't bother me

[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:59.540]
I think somebody had a who was that suggested that about the car pulling because for all we're seeing he wants to get a limo to bring him from

[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.860]
Boka back and forth every day and somebody said hey just how about car pulling with mole right and boy you should have seen a look on his

[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:06.240]
Poison

[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:08.700]
He was just going nuts

[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.660]
Somehow he can't envision himself in that explorer

[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.660]
Shloping down from Boka that long our ride with mole

[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.260]
And then of course mole would have to record our way to rondel 10 every day they wouldn't have to drive the explorer

[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:27.080]
No, they could drive the Jaguar they could get a Hummer limo is a matter of fact for all could sit in the back seat and pretend that mole was his limo driver

[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:32.120]
Huh and get him a driver on a way out that would be good anyway

[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.920]
Here's the poll from yesterday. I know I get around with sooner later

[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.440]
Which of these statements is the most ridiculous

[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:45.500]
1637 votes pretty heavy duty for nobody being here George W. Bush is a great leader

[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:53.340]
787 found that most amusing the most ridiculous statement of them all pieces coming in the Middle East 276 of you said that's ridiculous

[00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.060]
George is a great fill in for Neil 208

[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.100]
Moe Howard David it does a great show 185 think his show is just absolutely pathetic

[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:11.140]
The marlins will be 91 games 85 clearance our program director will get laid this year 53 confidence is booming now for clearance

[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:18.460]
He's starting to move up a little bit and or is that no see that's not good is it he'd be better off if he were in last place

[00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:24.280]
And the forals got a pleasant voice 43 so for all once again it comes out smelling like a rose

[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:26.900]
Sounding like a razor blade but small and like a rose

[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:32.360]
Not a rose is lovely as boner boy in here who's like covered from head to toe with cashmere bouquet

[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.660]
And what's that baby baby baby kilo

[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.740]
Baby kilo see I'm going to cologne this summer probably he's going to baby cologne

[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.340]
It's right next door so for us got a pleasant voice in last place which is a positive for for all

[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.180]
They just love him they're obsessed with it and I think that's great it's about time

[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.740]
We're having a great time here Craig under the overpass chronic Craig so leave me alone

[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.040]
We got two polls today one early and then the other one for later in the show and through the weekend

[00:21:58.980 --> 00:22:03.020]
And then we got to talk about the hot couples contest we got 50 billion votes on air

[00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.160]
Inter like a 20 million votes absolutely last time I checked it say humongous response

[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:12.040]
Too bad it's not a close race although it's a very close it's tight for second

[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.560]
Right I mean it is nip and tuck you couldn't put a curly here in between those two couples

[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:21.200]
But anyway speaking of couples this is general in response to anything that we've had on there

[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.160]
And I probably forgot some which picture on our website you like best

[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:29.080]
Moe's grew his neal swinging Moe is what we call that okay

[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.200]
Moe's of the clown squirrely moe

[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.800]
Hairless toothless moe which was the preceded moe's of the clown

[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.140]
Muscle bound meal God that's the brand new one it's on there now

[00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.220]
Clarence and the beast although we have a new clearance in the beast

[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.860]
But that won't be up there in time for this poll but when you see that

[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:52.520]
Oh with the wedding date and the whole deal love it I think for all should have that wedding on the air on his show

[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:56.060]
Right that would be big forget about that Marlon game the other night

[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:01.520]
Clarence and the beast Moe and Geldie doing the tango that's a lovely thing very very tight

[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.500]
The titty picks on the hot couple contest and I hate them all

[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.880]
Because we always have to put some really on there just to keep a lot of you at Bastard's hand

[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.760]

and the missing t

[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.700]
sure but that was that was that's the only got one vote

[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:13.900]
well that's the first 113

[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:16.500]
okay that's we're off to the races till noon with that pool

[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:17.840]
and then we'll get to this other one

[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.200]
I think there's going to be a lot of people take issue with you on that

[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.880]
Harry Potter thing

[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:21.480]
I could be wrong

[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:25.260]
I think they're getting really pissed off and fired up about those comments you made

[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.120]
okay let me take a peek

[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.160]
and we don't have to dwell on this because you got until Monday morning at 10 o'clock

[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.780]
the hot couple's contest

[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.080]
Frank and Liz have varied the competition

[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:35.120]
they've got a shovel out

[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.120]
and they just dug a big hole

[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.660]
and they're in there with Sheridan and the rats and those bananas

[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.620]
Frank and Liz have got 858 votes

[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.140]
Greg and Stephanie have moved into second

[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.240]
it's very very tight for second place

[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.780]
which of course is important because the really two good prizes are one and two

[00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:50.860]
am I right?

[00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:51.500]
right right

[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.120]
Greg and Stephanie 392

[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.420]
and right on their ass

[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.400]
Brian and Natasha 388

[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.500]
so it's only a four vote spread

[00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.160]
speaking of spread Mary and Shane 274

[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.420]
it's a long ways

[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:03.940]
to them

[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.900]
Holly and Darin 271

[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.520]
Mike and Kristen 250

[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.660]
Ian and Jen 223

[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.420]
Danny and Michelle 175

[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.400]
Captain Singham is wife 131

[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.380]
Vicki and Mick 124

[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.220]
Dan and Sherry 65

[00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:23.500]
Rich and Cheryl 55

[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.080]
and Jody and Kevin

[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.700]
with that sepia tone

[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:29.740]
have only 27 bad photography

[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:30.680]
right right

[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.980]
or maybe they just don't like them

[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.340]
I don't know

[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.480]
but anyway they only got 27

[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.720]
out of 3233 votes

[00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.460]
pretty damn impressive since we were delayed a whole day

[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.880]
and as they get started to Tuesday morning

[00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.120]
right right

[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.220]
3233 so we've already surpassed last contest total

[00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.740]
and in that contest we had Amy and Erin

[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:49.820]
I just mentioned in passing

[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.160]
which was no small potatoes

[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.060]
and I'll say it again

[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.540]
I saw your lady on channel 7 again this morning

[00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:55.580]
she still looks like a monkey

[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.200]
she did not look good

[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.360]
she still got a monkey push

[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]
Jackie what's your name?

[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:01.360]
Johnson

[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.540]
Jackie's Johnson?

[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]
I don't know if she had one

[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.300]
I mean she's okay

[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.800]
I'm not saying she's the ugliest bitch ever seen in my life

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.640]
but she is not

[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.460]
you people out there

[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.660]
you guys are really desperate

[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.180]
aha, aha, I'm Tonya

[00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.180]
like George

[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.940]
and that's the reason that you're so forming

[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.240]
at the mouth about Jackie Johnson

[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.880]
you can go to the guy named Songgrass Mall right now

[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.220]
the Broward Mall, Dayland

[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:23.960]
oh yeah

[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.000]
and within two minutes you'll see

[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.160]
15 beautiful luscious babes

[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.800]
who make Jackie Johnson look like the bottom of Clarence's ass

[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:33.080]
I'm Tonya

[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.040]
she's just about that great

[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:36.500]
I'm not saying she might be a very very nice person

[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.320]
huh?

[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:38.020]
I don't know

[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:39.400]
or not she may be a bitch

[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:39.840]
I don't know

[00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.260]
and I'm not saying she's grotesque

[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.320]
but when you look

[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.100]
when you're gonna make a fuss about somebody like

[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.040]
I did to you about Brittany

[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.160]
when she was on a cover bowling stone like two years ago

[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:48.960]
and you didn't know her

[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.140]
from God named broccoli spirit

[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:50.480]
and you're like

[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.120]
and you're like

[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.960]
holy crap, you old man's right

[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.020]
look, take a look at that

[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.140]
take a look at those

[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.140]
yeah

[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.420]
that's right

[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.380]
fuss worthy

[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.000]
you've heard of Jeff Foxworthy

[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.020]
how about finding somebody who's fuss worthy

[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.160]
when I can make a fuss about Tom Brady for crying out loud

[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.100]
that's because he's worth fussing over and with

[00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:08.240]
I'd like to fuss with it

[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.120]
but uh...

[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:10.420]
huh?

[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.720]
don't think you need to make a fuss

[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.040]
no

[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:13.880]
and what about that

[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.000]
in Foke guy

[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.660]
or is that in Rike

[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:17.480]
now listen

[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.720]
here's an article

[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.680]
and I don't want to dwell on it because I don't know nobody cares

[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:21.180]
but it's just

[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.480]
and the mad dog today is doing a show out at the Hooters in Pepper Pines

[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:25.100]
two to four

[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:26.400]
Hank Ford is seven in the studio

[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.740]
in the Marlins of the Tampa Day

[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.580]
they've been deviled

[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:29.560]
oh my god

[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:30.900]
pretty inversing

[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:32.500]
two teams that have no business being in business

[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.000]
but the mad dog is got on his show

[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.520]
his guest

[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.720]
and he doesn't do guests

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:38.600]
right?

[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.500]
he hates guests

[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:39.840]
but

[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.460]
Dom Twel Willis

[00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.280]
and I apologize

[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.480]
I had no idea who that was

[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.620]
because I don't follow the Marlins

[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:45.720]
so the other day I said

[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.540]
who the hell is that?

[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:47.440]
a basketball guy

[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.740]
it sounds like a basketball name doesn't it?

[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.400]
Dom Twel

[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.440]
you don't have no baseball guys named Dom Twel

[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:52.960]
but you do now

[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.580]
he's the 21-year-old black kid

[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.100]
it's the great Marlins picture

[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:57.640]
the pizza one hit her Monday night against the mess

[00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:57.920]
okay

[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:58.980]
so here's the deal

[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:00.440]
mad dog is going to be talking with him I guess

[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.200]
but he won't be a guest

[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:02.160]
he'll just be schmoozen

[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:03.220]
I don't make it okay

[00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:04.100]
okay

[00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:04.560]
right

[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.420]
but there's an article in the

[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.820]
here old this morning in the sports section

[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.160]
it says

[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.000]
and I heard the mad dog saying yesterday

[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.820]
this is what inspired me to mention this

[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.380]
that now people have a reason to go out to the ballpark

[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:15.920]
in other words

[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.640]
and the suggesting once again

[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.320]
we've been down this road a million times you know

[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.260]
over and over and over

[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:23.440]
maybe not a million but

[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.540]
but third man

[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:24.720]
yeah

[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.160]
at times

[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.000]
first it was going to be Alex Fernandez

[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.860]
because of his Hispanic roots

[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.240]
and then it was going to be this one

[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:32.580]
and then it was going to be that one

[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.140]
and it was going

[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:34.260]
and never happened

[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:34.860]
never paying off

[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:36.140]
there were three extra people in there

[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.480]
so maybe Ferell was in there with a bunch of skeins that night

[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.440]
but it says

[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.300]
TV ratings are way up every time

[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.300]
Willis pitches

[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:43.760]
but

[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.580]
he hasn't had any impact on attendance

[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.140]
Monday when he pitched that one hit him against the met

[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.880]
Steve as you know

[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.660]
the attendance was 10,624

[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:52.620]
and again keep in mind

[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.640]
these numbers are bogus

[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.160]
they're over

[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:54.780]
they're inflated

[00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:57.200]
in his previous started pro player stadium

[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.360]
a two-nothing shutout of the Oakland A's he knew the smallest crowd in a six-game

[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:00.640]
stretch

[00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.420]
10,014

[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.860]
95-year-old manager Jack McKeehan says

[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.060]
he's getting some national attention

[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.420]
the TV ratings are starting to go up

[00:41:09.420 --> 00:41:11.420]
but he hasn't had a big crowd here

[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.040]
Saturday night by the way

[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.500]
he'll be pitching here against the devil raise

[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.280]
there's one good reason to go out there and see it

[00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.180]
but they won't

[00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.240]
I don't think

[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.040]
will they?

[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:20.700]
no

[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.460]
and he insures

[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.620]
that he would know what I'm talking about

[00:41:24.620 --> 00:41:25.560]
but he knows the answer

[00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:25.860]
see

[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.420]
you don't have to know the question

[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.040]
but if you know the right answer that's what counts

[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.820]
like on a quiz show

[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.780]
and the answer is

[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:32.680]
no

[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:33.900]
right that's the correct answer

[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:35.660]
so you know

[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:36.820]
all you people want to keep trying

[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.040]
oh that's going to be great

[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.140]
they're going to be coming out there

[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.100]
they're going to be standing online

[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:41.000]
it's going to be like the line

[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.100]
that Ferrell had here yesterday

[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.260]
or two days ago

[00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:43.960]
five

[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:46.260]
that McGillboy

[00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:47.180]
talk about an emotional

[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:47.960]
spickman

[00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.600]
comes rush

[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:49.460]
rushing into

[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.400]
well they're lining up

[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.360]
there's a line out here

[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.100]
and I envision I don't know about you

[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.340]
but I envision there's like a whole

[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.220]
you know

[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:58.060]
how many times have I been involved in these radio things

[00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.340]
where they invite people to come down

[00:41:59.340 --> 00:41:59.940]
like it

[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.700]
like it's Zeta

[00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.240]
you know actually it was before it was Zeta

[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:02.980]
it was I-95

[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.080]
and they got into a whole big scene

[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:05.700]
with that for help

[00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:06.140]
I would love that

[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.520]
because they invited kids to come down

[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.180]
in their underwear

[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.100]
and they were giving away tickets for concert

[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:11.960]
you know it was like

[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.180]
right

[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.420]
kids night time show

[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:14.300]
yeah teenagers

[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:14.780]
you know

[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.360]
no not little kids

[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.860]
not little kids

[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.420]
punks

[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.220]
punks

[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:20.140]
teenage kids

[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:21.180]
you know come down in your underwear

[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.120]
we got tickets for some

[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:23.040]
always concert

[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.740]
and they did

[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:25.280]
they showed up

[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:25.740]
and they were under

[00:42:25.740 --> 00:42:27.040]
and then of course somebody called the cops

[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.320]
and the cops came into the building

[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:29.380]
and it was like a whole big scene

[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.100]
in the song of the day

[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:30.720]
and it was great

[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.940]
and they got about $50 million

[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.180]
with the publicity from it

[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:35.540]
but there were

[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.280]
a number of people in the building

[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.080]
and it was unbelievable

[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:39.240]
because I was already

[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.480]
out of the building on I-n-Z

[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.460]
at that time doing nights

[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:43.960]
now did I go and take a peek?

[00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:44.900]
not not me

[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.000]
well of course not

[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:46.620]
periscope

[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:47.360]
yes it is

[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.180]
well I mean there were like a

[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.160]
zillion kids in there

[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.140]
okay there were a lot of people

[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.220]
but here there was like five people lined up

[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:53.820]
and Miguel act

[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:54.740]
they were like oh my god

[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:56.060]
you wouldn't believe it

[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:57.280]
oh we had to magnify

[00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.020]
yeah

[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.720]
all the results like the polls

[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.800]
kind of like most ratings

[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.240]
we have to multiply times three

[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.380]
and add a couple extra points

[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.580]
and then goose it up a little bit

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.000]
and then

[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.800]
check the hair piece

[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.900]
oh it's big enough hair piece

[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.660]
if you...

[00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:10.480]
you should have taped when

[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.180]
he wasn't looking you should

[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.160]
taped the beast this morning

[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.680]
talking about that bogus dream

[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.300]
he claimed

[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.540]
claiming he had a dream

[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.960]
he ran into Mo

[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.840]
out in the parking lot

[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.260]
had a big

[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:20.320]
verbal brawl with him

[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.900]
yanked the wig off his head

[00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:22.640]
ran over to Kentucky

[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:23.160]
fried

[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.060]
and Mo chased him over to Kentucky

[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.440]
fried

[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.580]
I mean what kind of crap

[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:27.880]
was he sucking on at the ball

[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.920]
game the other night to beast?

[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:29.360]
huh?

[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.620]
he must have been sucking on some

[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:32.660]
illegal jungle juice

[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:33.060]
or something

[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:34.100]
because he was just crazy

[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:34.760]
he's a bed bug

[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:35.600]
more so than usual

[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.340]
because I walked in the middle

[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:37.940]
of it and I thought what

[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.240]
what happened that I missed?

[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.180]
a dream

[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:42.800]
he had a dream

[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.940]
I think what got him emotional

[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:44.460]
is when we started

[00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.780]
showing those pictures

[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:46.720]
aiming clearance in that

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.660]
love in that lip lock

[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.220]
oh my god

[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.220]
and wait till you people see

[00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:50.760]
that new one

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.740]
now if you got this thing

[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:52.380]
go on or not

[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.080]
no

[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.280]
what is he saying?

[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.780]
half and half

[00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.820]
that means no

[00:43:59.080 --> 00:43:59.980]
see this is not a good

[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:00.980]
reason for me not to be here

[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:01.900]
I mean the fact that I have to

[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:02.500]
watch this

[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:03.700]
I have to be expected

[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:04.300]
to this

[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.420]
grotesque episode again

[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.200]
day after day after day

[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:10.360]
I lost my keys

[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.000]
my valley

[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.860]
he doesn't work

[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.520]
timmie

[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:13.520]
a stuck something in my

[00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.320]
slot

[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.560]
and now it's all screwed up

[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.940]
well just on

[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:17.480]
and on

[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.220]
and the best part

[00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:18.960]
but he doesn't care

[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.500]
because he got laid

[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:20.060]
last night

[00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:21.400]
and paid today

[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.200]
paid today

[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.040]
laid last night

[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:24.080]
a man who's got his priorities

[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:24.540]
in order

[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.680]
see you in my head

[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.000]
look

[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.340]
this is

[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:29.400]
20 or 26

[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.580]
you way

[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.480]
I just got

[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.060]
oh

[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.680]
you're never gonna pay

[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.920]
well we've searched so long with disease

[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.060]
if he's alive where is he?

[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:46.980]
it's driving us insane

[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:49.900]
where in Kema

[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:50.900]
Flush and Kaki

[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.480]
that's one

[00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:52.900]
Honda Ketchai Raki

[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.000]
where the hell's the domino's sane?

[00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:58.820]
is he on a major pendant?

[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:00.560]
or did he change his jambi?

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:00.560]

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:00.560]

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:00.560]

[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.800]
and a hospital's sane?

[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:07.800]
or maybe he didn't try to swamp his holes

[00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.840]
for a vagina

[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:12.500]
where the hell's the domino's sane?

[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.880]
where in Kema

[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:15.560]
I make my ship

[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.840]
and living right next door

[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:22.340]
what in that thought really

[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.900]
kind of make you sick?

[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:25.900]
sniffed off my wake

[00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:28.020]
I'm kind of sore

[00:45:28.020 --> 00:45:30.360]
he's a loose assign

[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.820]
the dictator keeps running

[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:35.020]
without his candy cane

[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.960]
he still looks hairy and burly

[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.000]
but his voice is kind of girly

[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.940]
where the hell's the domino's sane?

[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.120]
well I like the ending on that

[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.160]
that's a beautiful thing

[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.240]
this is disgusting

[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:51.400]
what would Ken think?

[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.400]
it says the mother of a 18

[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.940]
from Queens is suing the city

[00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:55.120]
saying the girl was humiliated

[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.380]
and harassed after wearing a

[00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.640]
Barbie is a lesbian

[00:45:57.640 --> 00:45:58.540]
t-shirt to school

[00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:00.980]
in the suit filed yesterday

[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.020]
in Manhattan federal court

[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.520]
Kathleen Hodges accused the city

[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.620]
of officials at middle school

[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:06.020]
210 in ozone park

[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.060]
of failing to protect her daughter

[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.060]
Natalie Young now 14

[00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.240]
the lawsuit would cease

[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.140]
unspecified damages

[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:11.060]
says that Natalie's right

[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:12.060]
to freeze speech was violated

[00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.420]
when she was sent home last year

[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.500]
and warned she'd be suspended

[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.380]
if she wore the t-shirt to school again

[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.460]
I was trying to be funny

[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.320]
she told the Daily News

[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.600]
I wore the shirt to many other places

[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.380]
and people always saw humor in it

[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.040]
but it was no joke to teach your

[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:23.780]
John Mason

[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.800]
who called the shirt

[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:25.740]
inappropriate ridicule

[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.760]
Natalie in front of her classmates

[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:27.880]
April 10th of last year

[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:28.460]
the lawsuit

[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:29.780]
Natalie was then escorted

[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:30.460]
out of class

[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.620]
brought to acting principal

[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.640]
John Calories office

[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.860]
where she was held for three hours

[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:34.900]
before being sent home

[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.740]
for the rest of the day

[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.080]
she was removed and detained

[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.500]
solely on the basis of an arbitrary

[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:40.220]
and bigoted view of a team of school administrators

[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.760]
said attorney Raul Kubey

[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.700]
who's representing Natalie

[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:44.080]
the lawsuit also charges

[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:45.240]
that Natalie was once ordered

[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.380]
to remove rainbow colored beads

[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:46.940]
from her hair

[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:49.420]
and was told by a school counselor

[00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:51.640]
it was not normal for her to ask girls out

[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:53.360]
like on dates

[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:55.680]
okay

[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.280]
but why not

[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:58.960]
if she's a guy

[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.720]
who she's supposed to ask out

[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:01.380]
like a monkey

[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:02.280]
the P teacher

[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:02.940]
oh

[00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:04.240]
probably

[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:04.920]
if we think so

[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:06.540]
if I probably just about any teacher

[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:07.940]
of the female persuasion

[00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.380]
okay we got a couple of problems

[00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:11.000]
Miguel is crawling around on the floor

[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.300]
and they're which I don't want to tell you the details

[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:12.940]
but there's some

[00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:13.500]
I mean

[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.440]
a beanabor

[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:14.840]
it's in different

[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.320]
different body

[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:17.940]
same mentality

[00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:18.460]
different body

[00:47:18.460 --> 00:47:19.960]
oh by the way Miguel I always liked him

[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:20.720]
guess what he told me

[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:21.480]
Jackie Johnson

[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.000]
he was recently

[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.280]
very very overrated

[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.040]
and here's another fact

[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:26.120]
see you you thought

[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:26.880]
and I thought

[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.980]
I thought I'd definitely even say that on the year

[00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:29.980]
because I thought I was going to say

[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.020]
there's that old bag again

[00:47:31.020 --> 00:47:31.480]
he don't know

[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.000]
here's another fact

[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.960]
it says you are absolutely correct

[00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:36.520]
about Jackie Johnson

[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.600]
she is out of proportion

[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:38.480]
average face

[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.140]
and she though

[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.100]
she likes

[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.740]
joe rose has the scoop on her ass Kim

[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:44.000]
I can't say dark meat on here

[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.560]
no I'll ask him

[00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:45.940]
no

[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:46.920]
ask joe rose

[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.320]
sure

[00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:48.780]
he'll tell you

[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:50.060]
absolutely

[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.360]
so there you go with all your Jackie Johnson fantasies

[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.000]
like I said

[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.920]
if you're going to get emotional about somebody

[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.780]
if somebody is fussable

[00:47:57.780 --> 00:47:59.060]
then they better look pretty damn good

[00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.300]
if you're going to make a fuss

[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:01.720]
I'm going to them all

[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.780]
you know what I'm saying is true

[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:06.000]
no absolutely

[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:07.520]
but nobody else

[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:08.780]
nobody at the mall is doing the winters

[00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:10.120]
in addition to which there's a

[00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:11.400]
she blind

[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.800]
because I don't watch the local lose that much

[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:13.440]
it's depressing

[00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.300]
oh and then that Jackie Ness brawl

[00:48:16.300 --> 00:48:16.960]
and like I said

[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:17.700]
lose some way Jackie

[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.780]
okay you're starting to really put some moves on her

[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:21.880]
some heavy duty moves

[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:23.240]
as in big fat ones

[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:24.840]
she's grotesque

[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.580]
Jackie Ness brawl

[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:27.400]
and she's one of your people

[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.900]
but there's a blind

[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.900]
the news anchor lady on one local channels

[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.800]
I can't think of what her name is

[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.820]
she looks like

[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.480]
Marilyn Monroe compared to Jackie Johnson

[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.660]
you know what I'm talking about?

[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:38.360]
what is her name?

[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:38.940]
is she on 6?

[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.440]
4 or 6

[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:42.080]
who's the half blinded

[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:44.120]
so does the news Miguel on Channel 4 or 6?

[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:46.500]
see he don't know

[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:47.040]
he don't watch that

[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.220]
he's watching Channel 53

[00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.040]
51

[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:49.480]
69

[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.880]
he's watching 69

[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.320]
oh he's watching Channel 7

[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:53.920]
yeah that figures

[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:56.620]
don't you know what I'm talking about?

[00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.680]
I mean really a knockout

[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.980]
she's beautiful and everybody

[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:00.940]
oh Jackie Johnson

[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:02.980]
it's like just like the Rascal House

[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:03.280]
okay

[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.140]
I'm embarrassed for you

[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:05.880]
by the way did the

[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.280]
the girl to give the guy the 10 bucks back

[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:09.100]
at the mobile place

[00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.120]
anybody know?

[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.960]
I would have never heard anything

[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:13.360]
I never heard anything

[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:14.080]
I never heard anything

[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:14.960]
how about she didn't do it?

[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.460]
you didn't do it

[00:49:16.460 --> 00:49:17.820]
you cheap little Jew bastard

[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:19.620]
you I can't believe that this guy

[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.160]
kinda some Porsche

[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:22.780]
some illegal alien up the street

[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:23.980]
they're out of 10 bucks at mobile

[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:26.000]
and he knew he would give him too much change

[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.700]
he probably just kind of let it ride

[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:28.880]
and they'll forget about it

[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.880]
although maybe he did do it early in the show

[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.580]
you think?

[00:49:32.060 --> 00:49:32.340]
no

[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.040]
no

[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:56.680]
and Toronto so much I'm a cruiser to much bigger market but I mean like professional news people

[00:58:56.680 --> 00:59:02.400]
you know like a real newscast as opposed to down here what's like you know grandmas I mean I'll

[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:06.480]
tell you I tried watching six because we do like to arose especially after last Saturday's

[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:12.560]

[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:23.220]
the whole town I did one time say something nice about that travel series she did on travel channel

[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:27.260]
when they were slapping her all through Italy that was a good series and then she sent me kind of

[00:59:27.260 --> 00:59:30.980]
like a very formal stiff you know thank you for the nice comments and stick it up your ass you

[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:37.560]
remember that she thinks her stuff don't think her end at Tony Cigaretto and of course could you

[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.740]
take him seriously it's like when they made Camberall remember our channel four which used to be six

[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:49.360]
they made Camberall Martian a news guy I mean is there anybody anybody would take him seriously

[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:54.240]
and much less I'm just talking to see human being much less than news Camberall am I a nice guy but

[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:59.100]
give me a break and that's the big thing in his town first you're a sports dude then you're a

[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:05.480]
news guy yeah Tony Cigaretto silly Tony and the problem is because these people shmuz with

[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.480]
everybody in the business and they have all of these you know like Hank and Mad Dog and Jimmy

[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:13.700]
Cifalist and all these guys in Cigaretto they're all of these football shows you know on four and

[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.860]
six and ten and they're like it's like a little fraternity so they doesn't say nothing negative about

[01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:24.720]
each other follow them saying but I have no ask the grandma where the other so I will just tell

[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:30.160]

[01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:35.460]

bit of hope send it panel and this will be on our website if Fabina is we got that straight out

[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:21.280]
as it going like full force now where I know menza menza it's going slowly slowly but surely we'll

[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.740]
get a monitor when he's good and ready unless he gets a chance to get laid again before noon like

[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:30.580]
maybe if clearance comes in here and drops him Senate panel passes build a overall FCC media

[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:35.460]
ownership rules a Senate panel voted yesterday to overturned decision by FCC that would loosen

[01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:40.000]
restrictions on US media ownership to Senate Commerce Committee decision now goes before the full

[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.300]
Senate but it is not clear if there are enough votes to pass the bill in either the Senate or the

[01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:49.460]
House however several Republicans have joined with Democrats and opposing the FCC rules which do not

[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:53.820]
need congressional approval can be effectively vetoed by Congress that's the good news we got

[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.860]
our fingers and legs crossed and they know the details it's on our website the whole story I just

[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:01.160]
thought I would mention that a little bit of good news a little bit of hope a little bit of hope maybe

[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.820]
that goddamn colon paul junior they're Michael paul the chairman of the FCC and all these other

[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:10.720]
two Republican Nazis aren't going to just hand a key to the kingdom over to Laura Mason and a

[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.720]
clear channel Greg Reed was just in here by the way first time I seen Greg in a long time and he

[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.620]
said yeah yeah mention something about you again now actually he seemed to be in a pretty good

[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:25.980]
mood he's real happy he loves for real man he's got blow up dollars got the whole deal he loves

[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:31.520]
for and rightfully so I mean you know you watch Greg stumble and fumble and bumble along and screw

[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.960]
up all sorts of things and then finally it's like my old axiom there if you throw enough crap up

[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:42.440]
any or so it'll come back and hit the ground it'll stick and I think this stuck so far and of course

[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:46.360]
it's sticky it is very sticky enough for us you know that's what they said of the ballpark too a lot

[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.340]
of uh rumors about that oh I should have mentioned that earlier all that hysteria that was going on

[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:54.780]
in here yesterday and beater boys starting all these rumors oh this better knock it on the air

[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.040]
there was there was no big deal there for all us throw on the first pitch out of the game on

[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:04.460]
Sunday the devil rig game they're not pissed off at him there were a couple of bimbos in there a

[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.160]
couple of those skanky broads which I better not say that because that's his sponsor but yeah a

[01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:12.860]
couple of them well he talked about it with the uh you know the banana of our bruise on her ass

[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:20.460]
but uh and I guess they were doing a few things a little bit over the line if you catch my grip

[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:26.440]
a little over the edge the baseline yeah over the baseline in fact that picture we're talking about

[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:29.820]
before I think maybe they were like kind of flashing that to the crowd and they say well there's a

[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:32.500]
whole bunch of kids in here and we don't want them to get the wrong impression of what that

[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:38.180]
thing's really like so we better not let them take a look at that no mole and they dragged their ass

[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:41.860]
out of there but other than that a great time was had by all of them even tough was in you know how

[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:47.920]
panicky she uh he gets I mean he's a nervous nelly literally but he went in after the show yesterday

[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.420]
he said now the marlins were not happy everybody's uh it's great it was a major happening there at

[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.500]
the ballpark I mean when a guy can bring in an extra two three hundred people and there's only 10

[01:04:56.500 --> 01:05:00.660]
thousand or eleven thousand ballpark keep in mind it was eleven thousand on wednesday but that's

[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.120]
inflated because it wasn't a tv game so there was bound to be extra people because it was not on tv

[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:09.560]
as opposed to if it's on tv you get it for free like no matter whose picture whether it's a don

[01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:15.880]
trail or whoever the hell it is chantel so the we just took a survey and we decided Jackie Johnson's

[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.640]
like a shadow of what everybody claims on his station all the sports nerds see I guess they feel

[01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:23.880]
compelled I'd like to find out off the air what they really think about Jackie's Johnson you know

[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:29.320]
okay I get no serious survey leave it to me because I have nothing losing that category I can go

[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.440]
on here and say hi I think she's marginal right and again I'm not talking personal sweetheart you

[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.040]
may be a very very nice lady you may be just a sweetheart I don't know and I really don't care

[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:43.060]
quite frankly but uh that's not what we're talking about the fact is she's been built up to be this

[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:48.680]
wow oh man really hot piece and I got news for you if I were in that persuasion I wouldn't be

[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:53.840]
all that excited about her okay there's there are bigger fish to uh oh there are

[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:00.600]

[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:36.140]
Alicia Lane who does the uh weekend anchoring for channel six yeah and she's very I think that's

[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:41.740]
her name and uh that he gets a lot of jocks coming in there and saying hey who the you know who

[01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:48.200]
the hell is she and she and he thought that she was a lot hotter than Jackie Johnson's line all right

[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:55.260]
let's hear her for Joe I always like you know it's producer didn't even seem to know I think I

[01:06:55.260 --> 01:07:00.960]
know he's starting about because right I watch channel six news but she's kind of new on the scene

[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:07.240]
and well let me ask you do you like Jennifer Veloppi um I'm not my under a little you don't

So Greta he's got a big heart on yeah okay well listen pal say how to Jackie's Johnson

[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:34.620]

[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.100]

[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:51.920]
there he goes there goes the old man but I'm so ecstatic the fact that I'm not the only one I'm maybe

[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.960]
you know you know how it is it's a sucker thought I say something the right away all the people

[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.240]

[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.640]
probably hanging out with sister Jean boy can you imagine where you imagine where they're sticking

[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:15.300]
other pool very important about Harry Potter sucks oh you know what else I think let's add one more

[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:22.160]
since uh yeah I think I got inspired from all the Jackie's Johnson talk which of these are you

[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:29.960]
most sick and tired of hearing about how hot Jackie Johnson is huh okay how hot Jackie Johnson

[01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:35.900]
and we'll put channels six and seven in parentheses channel seven how hot Jackie Johnson is

[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:43.080]
they'll get votes anyway here's a whole bunch of facts is you're not gonna like this one from

[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:50.020]
a rob Bob Rob whatever it means Neil and Bob says Rodriguez is a copycat can't come up with his

[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:55.280]
own material oh yeah in fact when he started ripping off my eating ass shows I really got upset yeah

[01:14:55.820 --> 01:14:59.940]
it says no need to worry about George this summer he's become your complete understudy one there

[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.840]
will be a pool every day like here's yeah there'll be a pool every day because it's part of

[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:07.200]
our show asshole I'm not supposed to did I get ripped for not doing it once uh two he

[01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:11.400]
hates his mother like you well guess what he hated her a lot before he even met me right three he's

[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.760]
perfected the silent response effect used between phrases so in other words even when you don't say

[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:20.920]
anything uh either not happy I say for right now he has a deep sigh exactly like yours make him stop

[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:30.980]
sighing stop sighing when he laughs here's a complete ripoff of your trading off moan by trading off

[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:38.900]
moan whoa oh that not that one oh tell us the truth really uh it's your son rest assured he copies

[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:43.340]
you to a tee I'll probably listen anyway since I have no life there you go what are your loyal listeners

[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:47.120]
right I'm sure they match that oh now this is a really good fact for me Vaughan this is something

[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:53.620]
constructive and useful although we all get to that here's one it says just like uh just like

[01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:58.740]
on most topics with exception of being some of your musical taste you are absolutely correct about

[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:04.300]
Jackie's Johnson being mediocre at best absolutely correct big boobs alone don't make you hot if that

[01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:09.240]
were true Ron Jeremy would be hot yeah he's got tutors like a cow George once again proves he's

[01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:14.400]

magnificent pieces of artwork ever and they just they just don't appreciate fine art no class

[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:51.140]
WQ I am well yes sir he'll yes I am great sensational

[01:30:51.920 --> 01:31:00.380]
Jackie Johnson is a dog okay they'll come out there's a lot of otter he would tell you

[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:05.660]
the blonde on channel six is Martha the Galsy she's hot okay I didn't know her name and I still

[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:11.000]
don't but if she's the one yes you're right she is hot she's very odd that's it okay thanks thanks

[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.980]
Pellie so there you go so far we've had a whole bunch of people saying that Jackie Johnson

[01:31:15.980 --> 01:31:21.200]
fuck third man it's so hot is what they're saying but then again the sports people on the station

[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.500]
they're trying to like build up that match of women today you know obviously have to say they're

[01:31:24.500 --> 01:31:30.320]
the politically correct thing absolutely right Jackie Johnson she's a fox yeah right maybe

[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.780]
they're saying she's on fox because you know seven is like Fox winner that might be it maybe

[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:39.720]
that's what they're saying maybe our hearing is just bad Jackie Johnson she's on Fox and of course

[01:31:39.860 --> 01:31:43.620]
even like Fox anyway she eats locks and what a box

[01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:52.440]
here but it was long as I didn't mean to impersonate it was pair long socks

[01:31:56.280 --> 01:32:02.280]
and brains like a box of rocks in fact maybe she'd like shot some Botox in her

[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:06.340]
voice maybe that's why her head is like she's rolling up like that maybe she got monkey

[01:32:06.340 --> 01:32:09.780]
pox that rhymes with that too because her face looks like like somebody said yes they were kind of

[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:13.940]
like school report on Botox they did on I don't know what are these news shows or something like that

[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:19.760]
Botox injections gone wrong yes I did see that you know what I think anybody who does that

[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:24.120]
deserves it I think you know if you do that you deserve what you get it's like people that are

[01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:27.980]
diabetic and eat a whole bunch of chocolate and candy and ice cream you know like me I want

[01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:31.700]
to forget I'll deserve because I've been like punishing myself with crap like that kid that got

[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:35.460]
eaten by the alligator did you hear about that deserved it right they said get out of the water there's

[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:39.700]
an alligator coming I screw you I know what I'm doing right that's right gop that's exactly right

[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:43.640]
just like just like when clearance came back from Omaha and the beast was down there on in a hallway

[01:32:43.640 --> 01:32:50.540]
on all fours I warned him I warned him I said you know clearance couldn't find squat in Omaha

[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:55.160]

[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:14.600]
macho image so oh oh he wants to come out on top of that relationship thanks for steering

[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:20.320]

much oh god regular listener and Miami says this morning Gully City went back to the gas station

[01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:39.440]
to return the ten bucks but when he told the guy that he made a mistake and gave Gully next

[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.380]
to ten dollars the guy said no I didn't so guess what Gully kept the ten bucks there you go

[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:55.240]
let me see this to you if somebody I mean if you have an IQ larger than your thumbnail

[01:36:56.380 --> 01:37:00.240]
and you have a transaction I'm not talking about thousands of dollars even hundreds of dollars

[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:06.360]
if you have a transaction of like under 20 bucks you know if somebody gave you ten dollars too much

[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:10.420]
change or even if it's very early in the morning you're a little groggy haven't had your

[01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:16.480]
a cup of coffee yet you know it's happened sure now that sounds really lame I don't want to pick on

[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:20.000]
Gully because he's you know got to cover his ass the way things are going on at you you think is

[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:28.720]
lying about what about that story I don't know all I do know is that at the moment the time that

[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:33.100]
it happened that's the time you say all patty made him a ticket give me ten bucks too much see it's

[01:37:33.500 --> 01:37:39.840]
and right there and then at that moment yeah the guy knows sure now maybe the guys maybe too

[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:44.740]
embarrassed to take the then bucks back maybe you heard about it on a radio or somebody heard about

[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:51.100]
it and went in told me like again embarrassed something like that but if somebody gives you ten

[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:56.320]
bucks too much change you know it sure and the honorable thing to do is not to go on here like

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:37:59.660]
some kind of a pipsqueak and squeaking around with you I should I what you think I should do what

she had any idea how much taxes we're paying now on the satellite down and I want to tell you this

[01:45:36.120 --> 01:45:42.240]
I hate direct TV okay despite a direct TV I really do I hate it and why why

[01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:47.420]
because it sucks because my digital cable in Toronto's got to beat hands down I got like 800

[01:45:47.420 --> 01:45:51.940]
real channels on my digital cable because my direct TV box you know the one with the recorder what do

[01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:58.600]
they call it the oh that's not tevo it's that's the same thing though ultimately that is the

[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:02.880]
biggest pain in the ass like this morning I get up and and if a bird forget about rain but if

[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:06.680]
a bird farts in the sky right away the thing goes out you got to unplug it and plug it back in

[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:10.580]
again reset it it's the biggest pain in the ass of any piece of equipment I've ever had in my

[01:46:10.580 --> 01:46:16.140]
life I despise direct TV I hate it well I got the ultimate TV receiver a couple of years ago

[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:20.840]
based on you talking about it yeah I'm sorry you're all right I am losing my picture a hell of a

[01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:26.140]
lot more yeah I don't have to reset it I'm sorry I did that to you if I would only know but anyway

[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.240]
your screen as it's just white satellite actors in California and basically the Florida

[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:52.620]
legislatures just like taxes from 6% to 13% the satellite and any other the expenses are gone through

[01:46:52.620 --> 01:46:56.280]
the friggin roof I would take the damn receiver and put it out in the bottom of the pool is what I

I know what I'm going to vote for because I was it was the motivator for the pool in the first

[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:28.360]
place thank you the new hairy in fact just only moments ago on CNN there again with the pictures

[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:32.500]
everybody's running out to buy the book and a little punky kids and yet the one thing I notice

[01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.960]
is that most of the kids that they're showing who are reading this book they all look like

[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:40.920]
Harry Potter they're like nerdy little kids with a silly glasses you know maybe that's why they

[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:45.440]
relate to Harry Potter nerdy little kids and other kids will talk to little nabs little nabs right

[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:52.340]
or little nips which of these are you most sick and tired of hearing my favorite picture is it really

[01:53:53.240 --> 01:53:57.500]
Scott and lacy Peterson I'm sorry I misspelled that there's an oh it says so when I'm sorry or if

[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.800]
you can correct it or not make no difference three people say that well just went up there Martha

[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:06.840]
Stewart's got a pair did you see her with the umbrella the other day that was that was something a

[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.680]
lot of other people that umbrella is most of them had him closed because it wasn't even raining

[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:13.560]
but that was like to shadow her face like we don't know how old she is in the first place I hope

[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:19.800]
they fry your ass Martha I'm serious I like them to fry her ass and make the rest of her watch

[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:24.600]
when you're worth a billion yeah to break the law over less than three hundred grain over

[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:28.460]
a chunk change what you have your purse right even even beena boy makes that much in a couple

[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:33.100]
weeks I saw it on his stub a little while ago he showed you his stub he showed me his stub it was not

[01:54:33.100 --> 01:54:38.440]
oh and that reminds me see how this works together here I was thinking about because I looked at

[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:43.100]
the counter again and we I made George right on their get clearance laid in big letters or somebody

[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:49.620]
wrote that who wrote that yeah and I'm just wondering the reason being there occurs because we know

[01:54:49.620 --> 01:54:55.740]
he's a sports guy so he's obviously a very viral macho kind of guy but I'm curious do you think

[01:54:55.740 --> 01:55:01.860]
that because he's so shy and so recalcitrant to like bond with these nice young ladies that want

[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:06.520]
to do him maybe there's something they're physically physically that we haven't like a war wound

[01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:12.340]
not on a war wound like maybe kind of like a deformed like a dwarf penis or something or like a

[01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:18.960]
like a nubbin uh well I have one of those and inversion like an intro version and you heard

[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:27.080]
of yeah navels that are in these in outies maybe he's got any penis any wini teeny tiny no it's just

[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:31.300]
they maybe he's got there's something a little out of the ordinary there I mean he is Jewish we

[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:34.940]
certainly know he's nice and clean and circumscribed oh maybe there was an accident not quite a war

[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:38.300]
was exactly I think I think now we're getting to the meat of the matter I think there might have

[01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:43.980]
been like a little little little or maybe it's one of those button hook jobs too too much off the top

[01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:52.080]
maybe it was cut on a bias he's not biased five six seven I said I want to pick on

[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.900]
clothes but I really am serious I think that we ought to get the guy laid just celebrate his 30th

[01:55:55.900 --> 01:56:01.000]
birthday and and even on his birthday bash it is how he didn't get laid you know I think I have

[01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:05.880]
a reason why okay I don't think anybody I don't think he cares about getting laid nearly as much

[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.100]
as the people around him do about getting him laid but what does what does he care about sports

[01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:22.200]
I mean that was easy yeah ball games right go to Omaha I mean when somebody tells me that they

[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:27.780]
did like Omaha because there's nothing going on there I mean even Beenerborg was telling me to

[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:31.080]
the day about how anybody can't get laid in Omaha is never going to get any and he's right

[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:36.780]
Omaha's not what you think it is oh it's the Bible bell yeah right right I don't think it's

[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:42.260]
I think it's just like Nashville you remember my famous month in Nashville right Nashville is also

[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:47.700]
the heart of the Bible belt and known for that but it's also the heart of like the Alda Hillbillies

[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:52.940]
and there's church on every corner and across the street there's a bar sure well usually with

[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:56.780]
some country sluts singing in there you know you gotta be able to stumble from one to the other

[01:56:56.780 --> 01:57:01.960]
exactly not necessarily that order by the way let me say it again sleepers great movie

[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:09.520]
with the father Robert oh the hero yeah what is he doing again now he's driving me absolutely

[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:18.040]
up the wall what is he doing Joe Castello will be calling on the hotline with a very good

[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:23.820]
proposal Joe Castello we just saw yesterday is back from our punishment yes sir I'm here on the

[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:28.500]
line I just happen to be hearing what you were talking about with clearance yeah and uh here's

[01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:32.600]
the man who wait wait wait a minute here is a man who's actually seeing clearance his penis okay I

[01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.380]
have not seen clearance oh I did see an email that came to me last night one of our mutual

[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:43.480]
listeners listen to you and George and I believe it or not he offered to have his wife

Really because they may just got lucky I guess it has to do with the the unit itself is just a lot of them are defective

[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:43.000]
They've had all kinds of problems. Well, you know, I will say that I did have to that

[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.200]
I would have an all kinds of delays changing channels

[02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.860]
recording right and I sent they actually said okay send the receiver back

[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:52.200]
Ah, you know the one now you understand

[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:55.920]
See probably what I need to do is the same thing a different receiver his mind is defective

[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.920]
Well, I was still as soon as they sent me the new receiver

[02:12:57.920 --> 02:13:01.460]
I was still having a problems when something was recording. I was always happy

[02:13:01.460 --> 02:13:06.580]
It was just take forever sometime to turn the channel right and then recently they just did a software upgrade

[02:13:06.580 --> 02:13:10.000]
I turned my TV on like three weeks ago and it's that upgrade complete and

[02:13:10.480 --> 02:13:16.980]
They just upgraded the my shows and everything else and everything just works back right now works perfectly now working for me

[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:20.240]
But of course I haven't changed my unit 15 times yet either

[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:25.540]
I've only once for me. Hey question for you the Godfather's been on a lot lately on the all over the dish

[02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:26.620]
I've been checking out of course

[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.920]
Every time I watch it always something always pops into my head

[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:33.940]
And I just a quick question for your opinion when they killed Hyman Roth at the airport

[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:37.900]
When the guy just shot him and he was pretending he was a newspaper reporter

[02:13:37.900 --> 02:13:42.320]
Right right how to hell would they have convinced him to do that? No, he was gonna get blown away

[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:46.660]
He didn't know that he thought he was gonna get away with it

[02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:49.260]
Yeah, I just just like just like the big

[02:13:50.200 --> 02:13:54.620]
Bell and Legosi looking guy that was trying to kill him by smothering with a pillow. He didn't think he was gonna get it

[02:13:55.180 --> 02:13:58.460]
Yeah, I was thinking maybe they just want to tell them no, don't worry. We'll have all our people there

[02:13:58.460 --> 02:14:01.820]
You'll be safe and sound and I'm just wondering why the hell would anybody do that?

[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:05.220]
He thought he was gonna get away with it, but unfortunately didn't work too well

[02:14:05.220 --> 02:14:06.320]
The party's over

[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:12.400]
Ever great day pal. Okay, so he said he had to change his unit. Maybe that's what turns out to try

[02:14:13.220 --> 02:14:16.840]

And you know if I had to do it again, I couldn't do it. I don't know how I did it

[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:11.780]
Impressive

[02:19:12.660 --> 02:19:16.800]
Because I had I guess installed the damn thing like fear for a different time. They had to uninstall

[02:19:17.360 --> 02:19:24.640]
Get out and then what you uninstall something yeah and reinstalled it right and did it the right way this time

[02:19:24.640 --> 02:19:27.020]
Though, which is why you got color on there now. Wow

[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:33.860]
Hey listen for me. That's a major accomplishment for an old farty farty farty-duty like me

[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:37.540]
Anyway, this story Toronto police ignore pot party in front of headquarters

[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:42.820]
dozens of green-wearing pot smoking revelers partied outside Toronto's downtown police headquarters yesterday

[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:47.540]
Smoking their joints, bongs and pipes without being harassed by a single police officer

[02:19:48.620 --> 02:19:53.420]
Streams of sweet smoke walked into the ears cannabis crusader mark emery of Vancouver resident

[02:19:53.420 --> 02:19:58.540]
Handed out joints to fellow potentuzists urged them to exercise their lawful right to possess marriage wini

[02:19:59.300 --> 02:20:02.880]
Merawanna is legal in Ontario to possess and it's permissible on a lot of smoke

[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:09.040]
Merawanna anywhere and that is permissible to smoke tobacco in Ontario emery said calling the province the freest jurisdiction

[02:20:09.040 --> 02:20:13.380]
In the western world with recent court challenges of pot laws and the acceptance of gay marriages

[02:20:14.220 --> 02:20:19.560]
Although the event was right on police property no uniformed officers were seen among the crowd inside headquarters

[02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:23.780]
Police seemed disinterested with the party and no officers made available to comment

[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:27.020]
I tried to if the police wanted to apprehend our pot they could have done so

[02:20:27.020 --> 02:20:29.080]
I'm your said-of-the-not-so-subtle challenge to police

[02:20:29.080 --> 02:20:34.040]
I thought the most provocative place to smoke marijuana with others would be right in front of the police chief's doorstep

[02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:40.440]
Police organizations in Ontario have said they will not lay charges for possession marijuana under 30 grams until the counties

[02:20:40.440 --> 02:20:48.040]
Countries muddled pot laws are clarified 30 grams now how many I thought it was like 20 joints is 30 grams of that you about right

[02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:49.760]
Let me go get my scale

[02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:56.000]
I beg your pardon how big how fat you roll the fat these were pretty fat. Let me show they were showed fat ones too

[02:20:58.260 --> 02:21:00.600]
We're not talking about it in the Toronto star newspaper

[02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:07.000]
30 grams is an ounce more or less yeah and how many joints can you roll out of an ounce

[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:12.680]
About 30 really about 30 man well there you go

[02:21:13.520 --> 02:21:18.640]
That should be enough for like a couple of hours right so there you go there you hours are American hours

[02:21:18.640 --> 02:21:21.400]
Canadian hours it's like really really 1.75

[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:26.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Verizon

[02:21:26.260 --> 02:21:28.200]
I don't forget the mad dog doing a show at

[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:32.920]
Hooters in Pembroke pines 2 to 4 the Humpro will be in the studio from 4 to 7 this afternoon

[02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:39.480]
And then you got your marlins on decades 7 o'clock 7 35 now. Why is that why I'm afraid that they play 7 35 is that correct?

[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:44.340]
Why why not the other games are all 7 0 5 aren't they?

[02:21:45.320 --> 02:21:47.040]
I guess they might make the Humpro work the extra

[02:21:48.180 --> 02:21:51.540]
You know nobody gets a free ride all week fat

[02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:53.520]
So so don't press the working extra half hour

[02:21:54.100 --> 02:21:58.200]
But the 7 30 is the game the devil raised into marlins boy that's gonna be really heavy duty

[02:21:58.200 --> 02:22:03.820]
And of course like I said don't tell willis is a starting picture tomorrow night supposedly and should be out with a mad dog this afternoon

[02:22:12.200 --> 02:22:14.600]
But heads it's the one to two hour

[02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.720]
Is it a guy?

[02:22:25.080 --> 02:22:25.560]
Okay

[02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:38.180]
This morning

[02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:43.100]
I

[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:57.000]
I smoke to joy, to time of dreams, and do it time of war.

[02:22:58.040 --> 02:23:02.920]
I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to war.

[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:09.540]
Oh my God, he wants to meet her. You see her looking at me.

[02:23:10.660 --> 02:23:15.320]
From my mind, he wants to meet her. You should leave as you can.

[02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:22.580]
Then one day, I'm at the end, to save from me and say, you've heard.

[02:23:23.140 --> 02:23:27.760]
I smoke to joy, and I'm a fine, but first take care of him.

[02:23:28.240 --> 02:23:33.860]
So now I smoke to joy, when I get up, in the sky I smoke to joy.

[02:23:34.960 --> 02:23:40.100]
I smoke to joy, when I'm the video game, and that's every 10,000 points.

[02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:44.260]
I smoke to joy. I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to joy.

[02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:52.640]
I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to war.

[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:24.940]
Oh my God, he wants to meet her. You see her looking at me.

[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:30.160]
From my mind, he wants to meet her. You should leave as you can.

[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:37.180]
Then one day, I'm at the end, to save from me and say, you've heard.

[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:42.740]
I smoke to joy, and then I smoke to fight, because take care of him.

[02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:46.120]
That's why I smoke to joy, in the morning.

[02:24:46.980 --> 02:24:52.460]
I smoke to joy, the night. I smoke to joy, in the afternoon.

[02:24:53.280 --> 02:24:59.380]
He makes me feel alright. I smoke to joy, this time of the day.

[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:05.120]
I do it, I'm a foe. I smoke to joy, before I smoke to joy.

[02:25:05.120 --> 02:25:10.380]
And then I smoke to most, those two joys. That's what I do.

[02:25:14.100 --> 02:25:15.720]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:19.180]
I smoke to joy, with me and in the morning.

[02:25:20.420 --> 02:25:21.960]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:25.760]
I smoke to joy, with me and in the afternoon.

[02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:28.140]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:28.260 --> 02:25:31.600]
And with your brother, you smoke to joy, so when you're with him, you're home.

[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:34.560]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.920]
I know you want to say that.

[02:25:38.880 --> 02:25:40.880]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:42.140 --> 02:25:45.080]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:45.900]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:45.900 --> 02:25:47.040]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:53.320]
Oh two joys.

[02:25:54.420 --> 02:25:54.420]

[02:25:55.440 --> 02:26:00.340]

[02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:28.840]
Not too shabby, man.

[02:26:28.840 --> 02:26:29.840]
Pretty heavy duty.

[02:26:30.020 --> 02:26:32.800]

That should keep going.

[02:27:05.720 --> 02:27:06.840]
I mean, get them out there, anything?

[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:09.020]
Can you see?

[02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:10.660]
Not anymore?

[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:15.320]

Clarence's penis.

[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.680]
Out of sight out of mind.

[02:27:22.040 --> 02:27:22.220]
You know what?

[02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:25.160]
He hasn't weird his ugly head in here one day since we started talking about this.

[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.220]
I think you're right.

[02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:28.100]
Where there's a will, there's a way.

[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.740]
And if you can't find a way, you might be gay.

[02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:37.340]
Now, come on, don't be saying those things.

[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:37.960]
That's terrible.

[02:27:38.700 --> 02:27:39.700]
You're going to blemish his image.

[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:40.960]
He's going to start...

[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:43.160]
We're getting along so great, Clarence and all the rest of us.

[02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:44.200]
Even the bonerboy.

[02:27:44.580 --> 02:27:45.020]
Got paid.

[02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:46.800]
But you're going to...

[02:27:46.800 --> 02:27:47.200]
You're going to...

[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:50.340]
Just like you through that big riff between me and the moe.

[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:50.520]
Right?

[02:27:50.780 --> 02:27:52.160]
Created a tremendous...

[02:27:52.160 --> 02:27:53.240]
The chasm.

[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:56.600]
And you're going to do the same thing all over again by suggesting that...

[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:57.440]
Gay thing.

[02:28:00.800 --> 02:28:01.320]
56670560,

[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.560]
pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon Line WDQIM.

[02:28:05.900 --> 02:28:08.160]
Well nice hearing your message to operator WDQIM.

[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:12.780]
Pound 560 on the AT&T Verizon Line WDQIM.

[02:28:13.200 --> 02:28:13.660]
Pull the radio.

[02:28:14.220 --> 02:28:14.680]
QIM.

[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:16.620]
Okay, nice talking to you.

[02:28:17.480 --> 02:28:18.000]
WDQIM.

[02:28:18.840 --> 02:28:20.480]
Hey Neal, I have a confession to make.

[02:28:20.480 --> 02:28:23.860]
And I hope this confession earns me a shameless request of hearing that moe.

[02:28:23.940 --> 02:28:26.420]
And Gerda Bid that goes, where's all the balls?

[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:29.840]
But the confession is that I am cracking down time maim

[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:31.280]
and I am Anthony from North Miami.

[02:28:32.140 --> 02:28:36.560]
Yeah, so you just sent this in and you're the chronic that calls them line nine all the time.

[02:28:36.600 --> 02:28:37.040]
I am, yeah.

[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:38.080]
Yeah, get out of here and idiot.

[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:40.220]
See, do I know him?

[02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:44.000]
That's what I thought it was way back in the beginning because what he called the first hand.

[02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:45.240]
That's also a second call of the day.

[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:47.600]
You're a chronic man.

[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:49.040]
We don't play that game on his show.

[02:28:49.040 --> 02:28:52.800]
And the one thing we got to butcher all of about a little bit, little bit, is,

[02:28:53.020 --> 02:28:58.360]
and we started doing that is just informing him, you know, giving me information,

[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:02.780]
giving me heads up and down and in and out about who these chronics are,

[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:07.540]
like the guy with the eyes, and that crowd, that crowd.

[02:29:08.720 --> 02:29:10.200]
Because he ain't going to put up with that crap.

[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:12.660]
All those chronic assholes.

[02:29:14.140 --> 02:29:17.480]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a 18.

[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:22.520]
Also, we'd like to find out who lets Gilbert and the O Station here in the afternoon or at night, overnight, sometimes.

[02:29:22.860 --> 02:29:23.000]
Right.

[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:25.020]
Should've asked Yolk Kostell about that before.

[02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:27.000]
I'm sure it's not him or them.

[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:28.660]
I didn't say it was.

[02:29:28.880 --> 02:29:32.300]
I should've just asked out of curiosity what the deal is.

[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:37.660]
I mean, this is the kind of place you would anticipate people just wandering around just that kind of a place.

[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:41.300]
McDonald's asked me to industry to cut the use of antibiotics.

[02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:46.520]
Responding to public health concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and farm animals,

[02:29:46.660 --> 02:29:50.500]
the McDonald's corporation said yesterday that it would ask its meat suppliers around the world

[02:29:50.500 --> 02:29:52.180]
to reduce their dependence on antibiotics.

[02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:58.340]
McDonald said it expected its suppliers to face out the use of some antibiotics that promote growth and healthy animals,

[02:29:58.700 --> 02:30:02.440]
and it's significantly reduced the use of other antibiotics to typically protect animals against disease.

[02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:12.320]
It said it's making the change because of growing evidence that the use of antibiotics and farm animals was creating antibiotic resistance in animals and in the bacteria that caused disease in humans.

[02:30:13.320 --> 02:30:23.440]
So in other words, if you had enough big max, you could pop like 50,000 penicillin tablets or tetracycline or whatever, erythrosin,

[02:30:24.120 --> 02:30:24.820]
amongst the cellin.

[02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:25.340]
Exactly.

[02:30:26.040 --> 02:30:26.780]
And went to you know good.

[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:33.240]
Industry official said the McDonald's decision would likely help out of the way animals are raised around the world because

[02:30:33.700 --> 02:30:40.960]
McDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain, one of the world's biggest purchases of meat and one of the biggest purveyors obviously up till this time of antibiotics

[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:43.000]
that you didn't know you were getting into the one in the first place.

[02:30:45.300 --> 02:30:53.300]
And speaking of Canada, Detroit, Americans visit border town to take advantage of a new game marriage law.

[02:30:53.300 --> 02:30:58.580]
Game American couples are bringing the head for the border city of Windsor, Ontario. How's my good buddy Marty Adler doing?

[02:30:59.860 --> 02:31:05.340]
To take advantage of Ontario's court ordered the legislation of same-sex marriages, by yesterday morning 13 gay couples,

[02:31:05.340 --> 02:31:07.860]
three of them American have a granted marriage licenses in Windsor.

[02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:15.080]
Suburban Detroit residents Jennifer Patty and Aaron James are among those playing the head to Windsor just across the river from Detroit to seek a marriage license.

[02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:20.060]
They just need to do some paperwork required in Canada certifying James divorced 15 years ago.

[02:31:20.480 --> 02:31:29.520]
We've waited this long, we can wait a little longer Patty told the Detroit news. How do you like that? They're pouring across the border, side by each, to tie the old knot.

[02:31:30.500 --> 02:31:36.500]
Wouldn't that be great? Let's have clearance and like I said the other day, let's have clearance and the beast tie them out in Toronto.

[02:31:36.880 --> 02:31:37.720]
You could take them up with you.

[02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:41.000]
And then we can take them to a hockey game, right?

[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:45.600]
Clarence can get his sports fill. They don't have to go anywhere for the honeymoon, they'll be right there.

[02:31:45.600 --> 02:31:50.100]
We'll give them the old hymen suite. That would be sweet.

[02:31:51.800 --> 02:31:52.280]
56670560.

[02:31:53.340 --> 02:32:01.860]
Oh, it's already going to pitch your pound 560 on the 18 and team horizon line. Our second poll of the day or Pula, which in these are you most second to how to hearing about?

[02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:10.340]
Reality TV show is 48. Scott Lacey Peterson 36, the Hillary book 30, the new Harry Potter book 26.

[02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:11.780]
She didn't agree with us, I don't think.

[02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:15.440]
Because it's, you know, you just don't knock Harry Potter.

[02:32:16.240 --> 02:32:21.080]
I'll knock him upside the head and shake a rolling. You know what she was doing before she started writing those books, right?

[02:32:21.260 --> 02:32:24.000]
Rest of, I don't know, rest of people. She was on the dole. You know what that means.

[02:32:24.740 --> 02:32:28.360]
She was on English welfare. She was just a bum chamber made.

[02:32:28.660 --> 02:32:31.300]
Right. A bum unemployed living on a welfare.

[02:32:32.440 --> 02:32:32.840]
I'll be there.

[02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:36.120]
This brilliant idea to write funny words. Sniffy snatch.

[02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:37.740]
Sniffy snatch.

[02:32:38.760 --> 02:32:39.200]
Kuselwitch.

[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:41.540]
It all kind of sounds the same.

[02:32:41.740 --> 02:32:41.860]
Yeah.

[02:32:42.600 --> 02:32:49.080]
The Middle East Roadmap 18, or most of the second-tier to hear about that, Niels's movie show is 17. That's only 7%.

[02:32:49.080 --> 02:32:54.880]
How hot Jackie Johnson channel some of this 15. We decided that Jackie's not so hot at all.

[02:32:55.520 --> 02:32:56.520]
Not even Luke Warm.

[02:32:56.900 --> 02:33:01.520]
Wuppens of mass destruction 13. Martha Stewart 13. Golf 6. The Florida Marlins 5.

[02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:04.160]
And Matrix only 2. Only a pair. They like Matrix.

[02:33:04.160 --> 02:33:06.520]
I guess it's old already.

[02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.580]
They're still a hucking about it.

[02:33:09.600 --> 02:33:14.560]
Oh. Matrix 2 and 3 and 4. Can't arreves did this and can't arreves did that one?

[02:33:14.820 --> 02:33:16.040]
Whoa. Did a whole bunch of guys.

[02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:17.160]
I know Kung Fu.

[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:19.700]
It's 11 after 1 at 5.60 W.Q.A.M.E.

[02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:22.200]

We've got an inside ball street 10.

[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:41.760]
And now she's gonna pay for it.

[02:34:42.760 --> 02:34:44.260]
Bromber says she lied.

[02:34:44.820 --> 02:34:47.040]
She soon being died in it.

[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:48.580]

And we're so excited to see her taken out and cuss.

Put her in for life.

[02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:09.240]
That would be a good thing for Martha.

And they'll send you away all of them.

[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:22.180]
When we're laughing so hard that we're shaking.

[02:35:23.440 --> 02:35:26.820]
But you're stuck with today all of them.

[02:35:27.540 --> 02:35:30.840]

Duff being the good sport that he heard us begging on clearance as we have.

[02:35:52.700 --> 02:35:54.000]
He said he's gonna get him laid this weekend.

[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:56.520]
He knows just where to take him.

[02:35:57.080 --> 02:36:00.000]
Anyway, Greg in West Bokas says, thanks for another great year Neil.

[02:36:00.180 --> 02:36:04.080]
It says, with Scott in front of you and the dog behind you, QA and his brother.

Brought back the good old days of bringing daytime radio to South Florida.

[02:36:08.740 --> 02:36:09.500]
How do you like that?

[02:36:09.680 --> 02:36:10.860]
Absolutely correct.

[02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:12.120]
Although he hates you George.

[02:36:12.460 --> 02:36:12.880]
That's all right.

[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.120]
He says, when you go on vacation, I have four hours to fill a while.

[02:36:15.120 --> 02:36:15.960]
I'm in my delivery truck.

[02:36:15.980 --> 02:36:16.460]
But what the hell?

[02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:17.460]
That's what the CD is for.

[02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.060]
Enjoy yourself.

[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:22.040]
It says Greg in West Bokas, which is a, you know, behind the back way of St. George blows.

[02:36:22.520 --> 02:36:23.560]
But that's where it goes.

[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:26.040]
5-6-7.

[02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:27.040]
Oh, 5-6-6-6.

[02:36:27.040 --> 02:36:27.760]
I'm sure Greg blows to.

[02:36:28.080 --> 02:36:28.940]
Pound by, he might.

[02:36:29.840 --> 02:36:30.940]
He likes me a lot, you know?

[02:36:31.340 --> 02:36:31.660]
Absolutely.

[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:34.820]
Reality TV shows, they can't stand it no more.

[02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:35.960]
They've had it up to their ears.

[02:36:36.160 --> 02:36:37.080]
But don't tell that out worse that.

[02:36:37.460 --> 02:36:38.200]
Don't tell a little tommy.

[02:36:38.300 --> 02:36:39.460]
Oh, hey, this is a great story.

[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:42.160]
New car warns of impending crash.

[02:36:42.320 --> 02:36:42.840]
Do you read about this?

[02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:43.180]
No.

[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:47.900]
Honda Motor Company has developed a new computerized radar system that warns drivers

[02:36:47.900 --> 02:36:51.820]
and impending crash with slight breaking and a tweaking of the seat belt.

[02:36:52.780 --> 02:36:53.180]
Ooh.

[02:36:53.900 --> 02:36:58.560]
The collision mitigation brake system will be offered on the most expensive model of the new Inspire sedan

[02:36:58.560 --> 02:37:03.960]
that goes on sale for $30,000 went on sale yesterday for $30,000 grand in Japan, Honda official set.

[02:37:04.320 --> 02:37:07.040]
There are no plans to export the feature or the Inspire so far.

[02:37:07.240 --> 02:37:12.400]
But Japan's number two automaker hopes the anti collision system will someday become standard and all Honda models.

[02:37:13.120 --> 02:37:16.420]
The system comes as part of a package of options is not priced separately.

[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:21.000]
Japan's biggest automaker, Toyota, recently came out with a similar crash warning system,

[02:37:21.340 --> 02:37:23.960]
which is offered as an option for a luxury model, solonial Japan.

[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:26.820]
Sales have been limited with less than 90 sold so far.

[02:37:26.820 --> 02:37:30.120]
The Toyota system, which breaks and tightens the seat belt ahead of a crash,

[02:37:30.340 --> 02:37:32.800]
doesn't go on until the driver first steps on the brakes.

[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:36.860]
Honda system is unique in working even before the driver responds.

[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:43.500]
A radar in the front of the car stashed behind the H logo detects vehicles with an arrange of about 300 feet ahead.

[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:46.880]
The system initially pulls on the seat belt and breaks slightly to warn the driver.

[02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:50.040]
A buzzer also goes off and a small light flashes on the dashboard.

[02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:53.260]
Just the subtle warning.

[02:37:55.880 --> 02:37:56.440]
My bad.

[02:37:56.720 --> 02:37:57.840]
Especially down here. Can't hurt.

[02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:03.280]
560.560 on the AT&T.

[02:38:03.900 --> 02:38:04.620]
And the rise of world of slides.

[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:05.940]
So we actually got everything going again.

[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.380]
We got the stories on it, a bedtime stories on our website.

[02:38:08.700 --> 02:38:08.960]
That's good.

[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:11.960]
And we're going to get the new pictures up there.

[02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:16.260]
The new bizarre sick and the grotesque stuff, including the one that's going to be now.

[02:38:16.300 --> 02:38:19.520]
Were they going to find that one of me and my newfound appendage?

[02:38:19.580 --> 02:38:20.680]
Where's that going to be in the gallery?

[02:38:21.980 --> 02:38:23.760]
There will be a link.

[02:38:24.920 --> 02:38:25.680]
It looks like there already is.

[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:30.040]
WDQIM.

[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:32.620]
Honda Lisa.

[02:38:33.060 --> 02:38:34.420]
It looks like there already is.

[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:38.200]
Fick, Fick, Honda Lisa.

[02:38:39.140 --> 02:38:40.400]
Fick, Fick, Fick.

[02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:40.680]
WDQIM.

[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:43.020]
My nail.

[02:38:43.180 --> 02:38:43.940]
Yes sir. Good afternoon.

[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:49.620]
I am kind my morning routine perfectly after fine tuning it all week long.

[02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:53.560]
And I now start my car exactly when Ferrell was coming on the air.

[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:54.200]
Oh right.

[02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:56.120]
I miss everything before that.

[02:38:56.320 --> 02:38:58.600]
And I stay on while I'm delivering the mail straight through.

[02:38:58.740 --> 02:38:59.360]
So you're done.

[02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:02.040]
I get a little bit of the mad dog and I'm a happy camper.

[02:39:02.300 --> 02:39:03.380]
Oh my god.

[02:39:04.060 --> 02:39:04.600]
I have a friend.

[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:05.960]
So I'm going to meet you two pal.

[02:39:05.960 --> 02:39:06.300]
Thanks.

[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:07.760]
See, there's a guy like everybody.

[02:39:07.780 --> 02:39:08.680]
He's a happy guy.

[02:39:09.220 --> 02:39:11.640]
I want to these sour and nasty miserable little hit.

[02:39:11.980 --> 02:39:12.300]
Yeah.

[02:39:12.740 --> 02:39:12.880]
Yeah.

[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:14.240]
And all those people were on to you.

[02:39:14.540 --> 02:39:15.320]
We know that you're pathetic.

[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:15.980]
You're tragic.

[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:16.680]
You're useless.

[02:39:17.780 --> 02:39:19.500]
But there are enough of people like this last guy.

[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:22.000]
I just enough to keep us going, you know, like my friend Rick the mailman.

[02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:23.640]
Oh, he already tuned out.

[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:24.880]
WDQIM.

[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:27.300]
Probably the movie shows.

[02:39:27.940 --> 02:39:28.600]
QAM. Hello.

[02:39:30.380 --> 02:39:30.740]
Hello.

[02:39:31.120 --> 02:39:31.480]
Too late.

[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:32.360]
WDQIM.

[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:33.200]
Yeah.

[02:39:33.340 --> 02:39:33.900]
What's up the mail?

[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:34.300]
Speaking.

[02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:35.180]
Yeah.

[02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:35.720]
Yes sir.

[02:39:36.120 --> 02:39:37.940]
Do you ever see that movie Big Trouble?

[02:39:39.060 --> 02:39:39.200]
No.

[02:39:39.860 --> 02:39:44.060]
It was like a black comedy with a bunch of hitman and bunch of actors.

[02:39:44.320 --> 02:39:45.320]
Never heard of it.

[02:39:45.380 --> 02:39:45.820]
Yes you have.

[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:46.960]
Big Trouble?

[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:48.200]
Million calls on it.

[02:39:48.780 --> 02:39:49.560]
Never heard of it.

[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:51.840]
Yeah, but the funniest part is it's done in Miami.

[02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:52.440]
Yeah.

[02:39:52.640 --> 02:39:59.460]
And if you only see the two scenes where the hitmen are waiting in the car and what radio station

[02:39:59.460 --> 02:40:04.340]
they have on and the babbling sports nerds that are talking back and forth both sides.

[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:06.780]
Oh yeah, I remember hearing about this, but I still haven't seen it.

[02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:07.900]
It's bus stop.

[02:40:09.060 --> 02:40:09.440]
Bus stop.

[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:10.060]
Okay.

[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:11.380]
Just like I let you know about that.

[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:12.080]
Thanks paly.

[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:13.180]
It is a cute scene.

[02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:13.640]
Is it?

[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:14.020]
Yeah.

[02:40:14.260 --> 02:40:17.380]
Well a cute scene is one thing, but is it worth watching a whole movie for a cute scene?

[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:18.880]
No.

[02:40:19.260 --> 02:40:21.520]
I can tell by the look the answer is obviously no.

[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:24.480]
5 6 7 0 5 60 sleepers.

[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:25.720]
Don't forget I recommend it highly.

[02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:29.560]
We're going to put that on my list since you resist on my list and I'm pissed.

[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:31.880]
How about Carilla's in the mist?

[02:40:32.060 --> 02:40:33.480]
Now I haven't seen that in a long time.

[02:40:34.500 --> 02:40:35.240]
But if you Q.A.M.

[02:40:36.220 --> 02:40:37.560]
I'm going to hit him with my fist.

[02:40:37.900 --> 02:40:38.380]
Q.A.M.

[02:40:39.560 --> 02:40:40.280]
I think he got the kill.

[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:40.560]
I knew.

[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:41.480]
Yes sir.

[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:45.480]
Jackie Johnson has cow eyes.

[02:40:45.900 --> 02:40:46.680]
Cow eyes?

[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:47.440]
Cow eyes.

[02:40:47.580 --> 02:40:48.020]
What cow pie?

[02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:48.600]
Brown eyes.

[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:49.700]
You know what I'm talking about.

[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:50.980]
She got the old brown eye.

[02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:53.640]
5 6 7 0 5 60.

[02:40:53.780 --> 02:40:55.360]
Jackie Johnson's got a brown eye.

[02:40:55.480 --> 02:40:57.000]
Bullock and get it on channel 7 immediately.

[02:40:57.300 --> 02:40:57.380]
Okay.

[02:40:57.780 --> 02:40:59.060]
Break into that regular programming.

[02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:00.100]
Whatever they're doing.

[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:00.800]
What do they do?

[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:01.760]
You said the Fox shows.

[02:41:02.220 --> 02:41:02.360]
What?

[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:03.540]
Deco drive.

[02:41:04.100 --> 02:41:04.960]
What do you mean like now?

[02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:06.960]
What would they be having on right now?

[02:41:07.140 --> 02:41:07.720]
What is it on?

[02:41:07.720 --> 02:41:09.420]
Like 42 on our...

[02:41:10.100 --> 02:41:11.400]
It sure is not on 7.

[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:12.520]
Oh, me no matter what?

[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:12.920]
Huh?

[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:13.600]
Oh 5.

[02:41:13.720 --> 02:41:14.300]
It's on 0 5?

[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:14.780]
Yeah.

[02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:15.900]
Well that makes sense to me.

[02:41:15.980 --> 02:41:16.100]
Sure.

[02:41:16.300 --> 02:41:16.500]
Why not?

[02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:21.000]
What's this little fucking band?

[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:23.100]
This series is nothing.

[02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:25.080]
But I don't know.

[02:41:25.340 --> 02:41:27.200]
I don't see no Carilla or Connor.

[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:33.520]
Yeah, jibble.

[02:41:34.540 --> 02:41:36.220]
It is in the middle of the wall.

[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:37.040]
That's cool.

[02:41:40.760 --> 02:41:41.300]
Okay, great.

[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:43.800]
So like I said, whatever you do, do not turn on channel 7.

[02:41:46.080 --> 02:41:46.760]
WDQA am, hello.

[02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:48.060]
Good morning.

[02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:48.960]
Yes sir, good evening.

[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:49.800]
How are you?

[02:41:50.080 --> 02:41:50.340]
Good.

[02:41:50.980 --> 02:41:52.440]
I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.

[02:41:52.580 --> 02:41:54.000]
Are you like, I'm a speaker phone?

[02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:55.040]
It's a recording.

[02:41:55.660 --> 02:41:55.980]
It's what?

[02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:56.740]
It's a recording.

[02:41:56.880 --> 02:41:57.240]
It's a joke.

[02:41:58.560 --> 02:41:59.480]
Oh, it's a recording.

[02:41:59.680 --> 02:42:00.020]
It's Arnold.

[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:01.420]
It's a crank call.

[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:04.420]
They've got the sample things like the thing that we loaded in the DCS there

[02:42:04.420 --> 02:42:06.040]
with the Glen Gary Glen Ross.

[02:42:06.160 --> 02:42:06.320]
Right.

[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:06.680]

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:10.360]
Like having a conversation with just drops like you do often.

[02:42:11.980 --> 02:42:12.780]
Are you sure?

[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:13.120]
Yes.

[02:42:13.940 --> 02:42:14.600]
WDQA am.

[02:42:14.620 --> 02:42:15.840]
I think about this innovative program.

[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:17.900]
WDQA am.

[02:42:18.480 --> 02:42:18.720]
Yeah.

[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:19.280]
Yes sir.

[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:21.440]
Fuck is already got a dick.

[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:25.940]
567-0560 is possible.

[02:42:26.140 --> 02:42:29.420]
pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:42:29.460 --> 02:42:31.000]
I get shfilkeys when I hear about bilkeys.

[02:42:31.420 --> 02:42:33.780]
I mean, seriously, that shows you how silly those people are channel 7.

[02:42:33.780 --> 02:42:35.100]
I've asked that for years.

[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:35.920]
Nobody's got an answer.

[02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:37.000]
What kind of a name is that?

[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:37.640]
Belkies.

[02:42:38.320 --> 02:42:39.580]
Especially for somebody on TV.

[02:42:39.920 --> 02:42:41.020]
Oh, hi, I'm Belkies.

[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:41.540]
I'm shfilkeys.

[02:42:41.960 --> 02:42:42.900]
I mean, what is that?

[02:42:43.380 --> 02:42:43.820]
You got name.

[02:42:44.160 --> 02:42:45.020]
Belkies, what is that?

[02:42:45.700 --> 02:42:46.540]
That would be better.

[02:42:46.980 --> 02:42:47.340]
Boy.

[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:48.600]
Come up with a name.

[02:42:48.780 --> 02:42:50.380]
I mean, most of us have fake names anyway.

[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:52.540]
You can do a little bit better than shfilkeys, no array.

[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:54.040]
I think that might be a real name.

[02:42:54.700 --> 02:42:55.300]
WDQA am.

[02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:56.480]
Neil and Bunny Sado.

[02:42:57.380 --> 02:42:58.140]
I bring you a hundred.

[02:42:58.560 --> 02:42:59.040]
What do you say?

[02:42:59.340 --> 02:43:00.200]
Neil and Bunny Sado.

[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:01.880]
It means breaded.

[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:03.200]
And?

[02:43:04.420 --> 02:43:05.340]
I don't know.

[02:43:05.540 --> 02:43:06.700]
He wants you breaded.

[02:43:07.180 --> 02:43:07.800]
WQA am.

[02:43:08.220 --> 02:43:08.560]
Neil.

[02:43:08.820 --> 02:43:09.140]
Yes, sir.

[02:43:09.780 --> 02:43:11.680]
Is for a really Harvey Firestein.

[02:43:12.100 --> 02:43:12.280]
Yes.

[02:43:13.140 --> 02:43:13.540]
Okay.

[02:43:13.800 --> 02:43:14.260]
Have a good one.

[02:43:14.660 --> 02:43:14.820]
Yeah.

[02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:17.640]
Boy, they really have run out this arm, man.

[02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:21.460]
Just this last hour when I was looking to leave here on such a high note.

[02:43:21.940 --> 02:43:23.420]
On such a note of enthusiasm.

[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:24.240]
In fact, look at this.

[02:43:24.720 --> 02:43:25.620]
There it all goes.

[02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:26.880]
Right down there.

[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:28.060]
Through these in here, too.

[02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:29.740]
Oh, you want me to say the Mike Mayo thing, though.

[02:43:29.800 --> 02:43:30.340]
Please, would you?

[02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:32.080]
That's the only thing I'll leave here.

[02:43:32.080 --> 02:43:33.240]
I want to clean up my mess.

[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:36.200]
I don't want to leave a whole bunch of crap here.

[02:43:36.440 --> 02:43:37.180]
Not that I'm not.

[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:38.060]
I mean, it's only 125.

[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:40.520]
Not that I'm like, you know, planning ahead or anything like that.

[02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:41.680]
I'm like, oh, I am.

[02:43:42.500 --> 02:43:46.420]
Well, I mean, based on these calls here, it certainly seems like a good idea at the time.

[02:43:47.660 --> 02:43:48.120]
WQA am.

[02:43:49.780 --> 02:43:50.380]
See what I mean?

[02:43:51.740 --> 02:43:52.180]
QA am.

[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:52.400]
Hello.

[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:54.920]
WQA am.

[02:43:56.160 --> 02:43:57.240]
Yeah, my thick meal plate.

[02:43:57.340 --> 02:43:57.660]
Speaking.

[02:43:58.300 --> 02:44:00.480]
Look at that little Tommy Dunham bird.

[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:06.940]
You realize where you are, where you're stuck.

[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:08.100]
Oh, very well.

[02:44:08.220 --> 02:44:09.080]
I don't want you to get depressed.

[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:09.540]
I am.

[02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:11.360]
But you do understand where you are stuck.

[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:11.880]
Too late.

[02:44:12.240 --> 02:44:13.200]
Oh, wow.

[02:44:14.220 --> 02:44:17.260]
I mean, these are really special now.

[02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:21.220]
These are the cream of the crap crop.

[02:44:22.500 --> 02:44:23.140]
WQA am.

[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:25.080]
I've really tried.

[02:44:25.080 --> 02:44:27.260]
I've really tried it like Howard David.

[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:28.800]
I can't stand the guy.

[02:44:29.020 --> 02:44:30.700]
I get for all six detective eyes.

[02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:31.600]
Sounds good to me.

[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:32.360]
Absolutely.

[02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:36.720]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T.

[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:37.860]
See what we have now.

[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:39.420]
These are not people who want to talk to me.

[02:44:39.740 --> 02:44:41.560]
These are people with announcements to make.

[02:44:42.580 --> 02:44:43.380]
You see what I'm saying?

[02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:43.700]
Yeah.

[02:44:43.900 --> 02:44:45.780]
In other words, there's no conversation that's going to take place.

[02:44:46.120 --> 02:44:49.320]
These are people who want to make statements, announcements, and that's it.

[02:44:49.480 --> 02:44:50.440]
That's no conversation.

[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:51.960]
You know, all that's something.

[02:44:52.740 --> 02:44:53.220]
Oh, I listen.

[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:55.280]
I'll take it for another half hour.

[02:44:55.960 --> 02:44:56.580]
WQA am.

[02:44:58.600 --> 02:44:59.260]
WQA am.

[02:45:00.260 --> 02:45:01.400]
Yeah, this is for all.

[02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:02.080]
Give me some more.

[02:45:02.300 --> 02:45:03.060]
Okay, for all.

[02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.420]
Have a great weekend, sweetheart.

[02:45:05.880 --> 02:45:06.500]
WQA am.

[02:45:07.020 --> 02:45:08.100]
Yeah, oh, let it go.

[02:45:09.180 --> 02:45:09.780]
WQA am.

[02:45:12.480 --> 02:45:13.220]
QA am.

[02:45:14.700 --> 02:45:15.380]
Great call.

[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:18.540]
Oh, that was good.

[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:19.860]
WQA am.

[02:45:20.480 --> 02:45:21.060]
Hi, guys.

[02:45:21.260 --> 02:45:21.600]
You're the best.

[02:45:21.740 --> 02:45:22.120]
How are you?

[02:45:22.320 --> 02:45:22.520]
Great.

[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:24.240]
Listen, check it out.

[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:24.860]
I don't know.

[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:25.260]
I'm fine.

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:25.260]

[02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:44.200]
I'm fine.

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:45.820]

[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:46.080]
I'm fine.

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.080]

[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:46.200]
I'm fine.

[02:45:46.620 --> 02:45:47.040]
I'm fine.

[02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:47.140]
I'm fine.

[02:45:47.180 --> 02:45:47.700]
I'm fine.

[02:45:47.700 --> 02:45:47.700]

[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:49.040]
I'm fine.

[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:49.720]
I'm fine.

[02:45:49.920 --> 02:45:50.860]
I'm fine.

[02:45:51.860 --> 02:45:52.600]
I'm fine.

[02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:52.960]
I'm fine.

[02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:55.240]
I'm fine.

[02:45:55.240 --> 02:45:56.800]
So maybe she is a scum, K.

[02:45:56.900 --> 02:45:57.280]
But I don't know.

[02:45:57.440 --> 02:45:58.180]
I don't know.

[02:46:00.440 --> 02:46:03.980]
When he finds out like what he did, like I said, we're not going to have a conversation.

[02:46:04.240 --> 02:46:05.900]
He's, he's sticking out loud.

[02:46:06.020 --> 02:46:07.820]
I thought that was a spectacular call.

[02:46:08.220 --> 02:46:08.600]
Hi, everyone.

[02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:09.120]
Welcome.

[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:10.900]
This is five cities.

[02:46:11.420 --> 02:46:12.740]
We're here all yours now.

[02:46:14.100 --> 02:46:14.940]
QA am.

[02:46:19.120 --> 02:46:19.540]
WQA.

[02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:19.840]
WQA.

[02:46:22.280 --> 02:46:23.120]
Yeah, listen.

[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:34.000]
Oh yeah, we're searching for love for those weapons of destruction every day.

[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:42.340]
We're gonna be searching for the most urgent atmosphere.

[02:46:43.740 --> 02:46:47.940]
Searching for the new decade away.

[02:46:47.940 --> 02:46:54.180]
But I don't think we'll ever find out.

[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:57.940]
There were in there in the perfect.

[02:47:00.920 --> 02:47:01.960]
Overfiring.

[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:10.780]
Yeah, high and low from house to house and under every roof.

[02:47:10.780 --> 02:47:17.640]
New validate the spin of all those white house love.

[02:47:17.940 --> 02:47:22.360]
If you still need convention to me.

[02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:31.560]
I'll go see an ad for the other doors, a lion from the old man from there.

[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:33.340]
But we'll keep on searching.

[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:37.100]
You know what I'm saying.

[02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:43.560]
Keep looking for proof of all the new decade away.

[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:50.480]
But you know that hey, hey, you're gonna find this.

[02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:54.320]
Ain't never had them in the way.

[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:59.580]
Okay, speaking of searching, we got a real problem on our hands now.

[02:47:59.580 --> 02:48:00.760]
I don't even know what it's called.

[02:48:01.500 --> 02:48:02.300]
Here's a nice fact.

[02:48:02.480 --> 02:48:07.400]
This is my first day listening to the entire show.

[02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:12.240]
There's one big you do when some guy goes to a gate club and gets raped.

[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:14.760]
I was on the beach when I heard last time.

[02:48:14.820 --> 02:48:15.320]
I had the volume.

[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:19.040]
Please play that bit for me.

[02:48:22.580 --> 02:48:24.120]
We got Christina from the beach.

[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:25.940]
She was a high school student, which we love, of course.

[02:48:27.140 --> 02:48:28.660]
And we know what the bit is.

[02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:30.060]
Brian, who made the bit?

[02:48:30.340 --> 02:48:31.100]
He don't know what it is.

[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:32.960]
What is it called?

[02:48:34.100 --> 02:48:35.060]
Something QAM dating.

[02:48:35.780 --> 02:48:37.180]
Something something dating.

[02:48:39.580 --> 02:48:41.020]
Well, what the hell does that mean?

[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.560]
I got some discs in here.

[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:44.220]
I don't see it on the screen.

[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:46.800]
I just Christina, what are you doing to us?

[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.100]
I'm sure you must have heard it.

[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:50.100]
Maybe she dreamed she heard it.

[02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:54.160]
Maybe it was just one of the dozen or five hundred other ones where Mo gets raped at it.

[02:48:54.420 --> 02:48:55.140]
I don't know.

[02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:56.080]
But we're looking.

[02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:57.620]
We're searching for Christina.

[02:48:57.660 --> 02:48:58.520]
Thanks for the nice facts.

[02:48:59.340 --> 02:49:00.100]
And we are the best you write.

[02:49:01.700 --> 02:49:02.060]
56670560.

[02:49:02.940 --> 02:49:04.220]
So what we're going to do is,

[02:49:04.320 --> 02:49:06.260]
George and I will look through this while being a boy.

[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:09.880]
He regulates and keeps the audience.

[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:12.480]
Aren't you supposed to be filling in the breach here?

[02:49:12.620 --> 02:49:13.740]
Well, look, this is important stuff.

[02:49:14.660 --> 02:49:16.800]
This is a new, a relatively new listener.

[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:20.180]
And she's going to spread it through the whole high school.

[02:49:20.280 --> 02:49:21.340]
What about the sport whole mind?

[02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:22.160]
I guess that's not it.

[02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:22.940]
That's the wrong hole.

[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:24.840]
Mo in the beast.

[02:49:26.500 --> 02:49:27.600]
No, Howard gets raped.

[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:29.140]
Now that's just your ordinary pedestrian.

[02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:30.120]
I mean, that could be anyone.

[02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:31.240]
That was the first one I think.

[02:49:31.400 --> 02:49:33.480]
Fagidor and ginger, Gellie's balls.

[02:49:34.980 --> 02:49:35.060]
Huh?

[02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:39.040]
Here's one that's got an effinit.

[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:39.460]
Look at that.

[02:49:40.180 --> 02:49:40.500]
What?

[02:49:40.500 --> 02:49:40.760]
What?

[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:41.100]
What?

[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.400]
Effin something.

[02:49:43.600 --> 02:49:45.640]
I don't really, I don't think it doesn't really get any bells.

[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:46.120]
Oh, what is it?

[02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:46.520]
What it is?

[02:49:46.560 --> 02:49:46.820]
You do?

[02:49:47.060 --> 02:49:47.680]
I can hear it.

[02:49:47.960 --> 02:49:48.860]
You can hear it?

[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:49.240]
Yeah.

[02:49:49.380 --> 02:49:50.060]
In my head.

[02:49:50.500 --> 02:49:50.980]
Sing a song.

[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:52.560]
Starts.

[02:49:53.780 --> 02:49:54.340]
Oh, yeah.

[02:49:54.520 --> 02:49:57.060]
I know what you're talking about, too, but what's all that I call?

[02:49:57.380 --> 02:49:58.460]
Well, he's got to know what it is.

[02:49:58.580 --> 02:49:59.120]
He's done it.

[02:49:59.220 --> 02:50:00.240]
I sang it to him.

[02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:01.180]
How do I know that one?

[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:02.880]
His book of Brian, too, it turned into.

[02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:03.220]
Huh?

[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:04.160]
That's all I got that it's got the word,

[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:04.720]
Seamy.

[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:05.600]
He became a real chicken.

[02:50:05.740 --> 02:50:07.260]
He just ate the same as he used to be.

[02:50:07.680 --> 02:50:08.520]
Sport whole mind.

[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:09.820]
Not any of it.

[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:10.980]
Cheese.

[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:14.240]
We got a, this could be number one with four bullets.

[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:15.720]
Requiem for mode, that's not it.

[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:17.860]
That's the one where Geltie's dancing on his grave, I think.

[02:50:18.700 --> 02:50:21.200]
Moe and Ferral, Ginger and Moe gave a union.

[02:50:22.220 --> 02:50:23.280]
Raypeg, Rick and Suss.

[02:50:24.760 --> 02:50:25.720]
Don't find it yet.

[02:50:25.880 --> 02:50:26.440]
I ain't got it.

[02:50:26.460 --> 02:50:27.500]
We're a surgeon, Kristina.

[02:50:27.620 --> 02:50:28.140]
Have no fear.

[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:29.960]
We're working fibrously for you.

[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:31.420]
Can't find it, huh?

[02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:33.680]
No, the fit, either.

[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:36.420]
WQIM.

[02:50:38.080 --> 02:50:39.160]
Wacko line, QAM.

[02:50:40.840 --> 02:50:41.480]
Yes, sir.

[02:50:42.120 --> 02:50:42.240]
Okay.

[02:50:43.220 --> 02:50:45.000]
Jackie Johnson is a state of mind.

[02:50:45.360 --> 02:50:46.160]
Right, that's what I said.

[02:50:46.620 --> 02:50:46.900]
Exactly.

[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:51.280]
He is to TV news and do, uh, to feminine the,

[02:50:51.300 --> 02:50:52.680]
what the Rascal House is to food.

[02:50:53.240 --> 02:50:53.500]
Exactly.

[02:50:54.260 --> 02:50:57.520]
Joe, Joe, uh, Rose said there was another girl on Channel 6

[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:58.500]
that's even better looking.

[02:50:58.620 --> 02:50:58.960]
He's right.

[02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:00.380]
She is hot.

[02:51:01.040 --> 02:51:03.220]
I think even Tony Cigretto's hotter than she is.

[02:51:03.400 --> 02:51:04.040]
Oh, he's, though.

[02:51:04.040 --> 02:51:05.000]
And I would, he's gross.

[02:51:05.220 --> 02:51:05.420]
You're right.

[02:51:05.460 --> 02:51:06.180]
Oh, that face.

[02:51:06.680 --> 02:51:09.840]
Oh, I know we all been around a long time,

[02:51:09.920 --> 02:51:11.300]
but Tony's getting really long in the tooth.

[02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:12.360]
He sure is.

[02:51:12.580 --> 02:51:16.120]
And that Jackie Johnson, I think he's right on her push there.

[02:51:16.340 --> 02:51:16.360]
Right?

[02:51:16.580 --> 02:51:17.800]
I think you're seeing it.

[02:51:17.800 --> 02:51:18.420]
Oh, my goodness.

[02:51:18.520 --> 02:51:19.080]
Good luck, you pal.

[02:51:19.160 --> 02:51:20.040]
Thanks for agreeing with me.

[02:51:20.240 --> 02:51:20.400]
Yes.

[02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:21.120]
Moe in the beast.

[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:22.520]
That's it.

[02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:23.100]
Moe in the beast.

[02:51:23.260 --> 02:51:24.740]
So you had it in your hand just a second.

[02:51:24.740 --> 02:51:26.720]
I had it in my hand and you tell me it's about,

[02:51:26.860 --> 02:51:27.840]
what was he saying?

[02:51:27.980 --> 02:51:29.260]
It was QAMD.

[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:31.620]
Yeah, that sounds a lot like that, doesn't it?

[02:51:32.080 --> 02:51:35.620]
Moe in the beast and QAMD, it sounds like exactly the same bit to me, don't it?

[02:51:35.720 --> 02:51:36.300]
Moe in the lawn.

[02:51:37.940 --> 02:51:38.740]
Moe in the lawn.

[02:51:40.020 --> 02:51:43.040]
Did I actually read that one in my list when I was going through these?

[02:51:43.420 --> 02:51:44.140]
Moe in the beast, yeah.

[02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.920]
Oh, she done, you know what's going to happen now.

[02:51:47.480 --> 02:51:50.180]
Now I'll go through this whole stack and I won't find it again.

[02:51:50.620 --> 02:51:53.220]
Like I said, Christine or whatever your name was, we like you a lot,

[02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:54.760]
but I could scroll in my show.

[02:51:55.140 --> 02:51:55.600]
We'll find it.

[02:51:56.840 --> 02:51:57.460]
What is it?

[02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:58.680]
Moe in the beast.

[02:51:58.880 --> 02:52:00.080]
Moe with Thakador and Enginger.

[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:02.060]
There's Moe hit by a truck.

[02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:04.080]
Oh, how it gets raped.

[02:52:05.320 --> 02:52:06.280]
Did it?

[02:52:07.020 --> 02:52:07.680]
Uh oh.

[02:52:08.020 --> 02:52:09.380]
Hold on, hold on tight.

[02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:11.940]
Everybody on the beat starts squeezing their real tight.

[02:52:12.100 --> 02:52:13.040]
Squeeze your cheeks together.

[02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.520]
Because I think I had it on this damn well better be the one.

[02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:18.860]
Now, both of you see.

[02:52:19.180 --> 02:52:19.960]
Brian, tour to that?

[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:20.620]
Yes.

[02:52:21.340 --> 02:52:22.380]
One moment please.

[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:23.520]
Yes.

[02:52:23.740 --> 02:52:27.880]
I'm for the W-U-A-M beauty in the beast contest.

[02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:29.740]
Let's meet our beast judge.

[02:52:30.200 --> 02:52:32.820]
Start it with the illustrious great read.

[02:52:33.620 --> 02:52:35.440]
Thank you, thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:52:36.040 --> 02:52:39.020]
Now our next judge needs no introduction.

[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:43.240]
I'm sure you're all aware of our wonderful morning tour.

[02:52:43.560 --> 02:52:45.780]
Right out of my way to the Dapetan.

[02:52:46.080 --> 02:52:48.740]
Well, without any of the foie d'A-R-Dou-Dou-Dou.

[02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:52.820]
I'll announce the award hunt of the beauty in the beast contest

[02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:54.340]
so I can get out of here and go home.

[02:52:54.840 --> 02:52:56.020]
All right, give me the goddamn envelope.

[02:52:56.020 --> 02:52:58.640]
Here you are, M-O-T-A-R-D!

[02:52:58.640 --> 02:53:01.660]
End of the winner is match lorette number one.

[02:53:02.100 --> 02:53:02.660]
Okay, beast.

[02:53:02.880 --> 02:53:03.780]
I am the beast.

[02:53:04.140 --> 02:53:05.480]
You're a path little toyed.

[02:53:05.660 --> 02:53:06.780]
Behind that curtain is your date.

[02:53:07.140 --> 02:53:08.620]
Is it going to be match lorette number one?

[02:53:09.880 --> 02:53:11.800]
Let me say number one.

[02:53:11.960 --> 02:53:14.300]
I think as you can't think we're all the fat me ahead.

[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:15.040]
Oh, wait a minute.

[02:53:15.120 --> 02:53:16.120]
Oh, you don't even harder to me.

[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:17.200]
Give me a minute here.

[02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:19.040]
I can't think I...

[02:53:19.040 --> 02:53:20.120]
Number one.

[02:53:20.260 --> 02:53:21.120]
Take up your mind.

[02:53:21.340 --> 02:53:22.340]
Who you think you're...

[02:53:22.340 --> 02:53:23.920]
We do not want to be proud of you.

[02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:25.460]
All right, beast.

[02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:27.000]
Meet your mystery date.

[02:53:27.320 --> 02:53:29.240]
Sport hole radio program director.

[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:30.440]
Clarence.

[02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:33.440]
I was hoping you'd pick me.

[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:35.380]
I always thought you were trying to cute.

[02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:37.460]
Maybe later we can talk about sports.

[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:38.900]
You said sports.

[02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:41.380]
Stop it, Clarence.

[02:53:41.500 --> 02:53:43.440]
I am the beast in your body, my arm.

[02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:45.160]
All right, you two mother heads.

[02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:45.800]
Knock it off.

[02:53:45.980 --> 02:53:46.860]
Get in the back of your head.

[02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:47.440]
What formal?

[02:53:47.880 --> 02:53:48.920]
Grasjeu, one ya moron.

[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:49.840]
No.

[02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:53.040]
Now I got to escort you on a date to the crazy horsey source

[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:53.560]
and a striptured.

[02:53:54.120 --> 02:53:54.880]
Here we are, kids.

[02:53:55.540 --> 02:53:56.320]
Go have a good time.

[02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:57.840]
Hey, it's all the brood.

[02:53:58.000 --> 02:53:59.120]
It's a gay club, Mom.

[02:53:59.360 --> 02:54:01.080]
And the mother, it looks like our audience indeed.

[02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:02.340]
It's a gay club, Mom.

[02:54:02.460 --> 02:54:03.840]
Ah, that's that backstab.

[02:54:03.980 --> 02:54:04.840]
It's high-smokin'.

[02:54:04.840 --> 02:54:05.220]
What the?

[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:05.740]
Sports.

[02:54:06.380 --> 02:54:07.840]
I can't hear your music to that.

[02:54:08.020 --> 02:54:08.380]
What was that?

[02:54:08.840 --> 02:54:09.060]
Sports.

[02:54:09.600 --> 02:54:09.720]
What?

[02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:11.280]
I said sports.

[02:54:12.040 --> 02:54:12.400]
Sports.

[02:54:13.180 --> 02:54:13.580]
Ah!

[02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:15.740]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:16.320]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:18.380 --> 02:54:19.500]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:20.200]
Sports.

[02:54:21.440 --> 02:54:22.400]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:23.300]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:24.700]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:24.700 --> 02:54:25.400]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:27.100 --> 02:54:27.560]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:27.620 --> 02:54:29.840]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:31.020]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:31.160 --> 02:54:32.320]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:32.680]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:32.680 --> 02:54:33.280]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:33.320]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:33.320 --> 02:54:34.200]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:34.200]

[02:54:34.200 --> 02:54:35.500]
Oh, my God.

[02:54:35.500 --> 02:54:35.940]
I love it.

[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:37.980]
That was well worth looking for, wasn't it?

[02:54:38.060 --> 02:54:39.120]
We probably never would have played the game.

[02:54:39.240 --> 02:54:39.360]
What?

[02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:40.380]
For her, yeah.

[02:54:40.560 --> 02:54:40.780]
Excellent.

[02:54:40.900 --> 02:54:41.860]
Well, she's ecstatic.

[02:54:42.140 --> 02:54:45.560]
I mean, it wasn't one of my all-time favorites, but keep in mind, gang rape is funny.

[02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:48.260]
We're in the middle of the world.

[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:50.340]
We're supporting you five sixty.

[02:54:50.880 --> 02:54:52.060]
You A.M.

[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:54.380]
Your wife.

[02:54:57.240 --> 02:54:57.720]
Hello?

[02:54:58.660 --> 02:54:59.140]
Eisner?

[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:01.040]
Uh, uh, yes?

[02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:01.900]
Mouse.

[02:55:02.740 --> 02:55:04.440]
Oh, Mr. Mouse, good morning.

[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:05.220]
How are you, sir?

[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:06.860]
I'm not good, Eisner.

[02:55:07.240 --> 02:55:08.560]
Oh, you're not feeling well, sir?

[02:55:08.820 --> 02:55:10.140]
I'm watching the television.

[02:55:10.660 --> 02:55:13.480]
The ABC 50-year reunion special?

[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:15.640]
Oh, what an amazing special.

[02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:16.960]
What a night to remember.

[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:18.680]
Yeah, a night to remember for you.

[02:55:19.100 --> 02:55:20.320]
How many times were you in the middle of the world?

[02:55:28.480 --> 02:55:33.500]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.000]

[02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:56.160]

[02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:56.160]

[02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:56.160]

[02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:56.180]

[02:57:56.180 --> 02:57:56.240]
I was in the middle of the world.

I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:37.860]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.860]

[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:37.940]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:38.200]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:38.200]

[02:58:38.200 --> 02:58:40.740]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:40.740 --> 02:58:42.440]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:49.340]
I was in the middle of the world.

[02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:57.240]
His name was George I was George West.

[02:58:57.240 --> 02:58:57.740]
Go on to find the wall.

[02:58:57.740 --> 02:58:57.740]

[02:58:57.740 --> 02:58:59.620]
I don't send it.

[02:59:01.920 --> 02:59:02.260]
His Mother Fox.

[02:59:02.540 --> 02:59:02.620]
I don't send it.

[02:59:02.620 --> 02:59:03.760]
And we need a portrait of a Green Brook,

[02:59:03.760 --> 02:59:19.300]
这样 of fire and fire and fire and fire and fire and fire and fire with fire and fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire and fire with fire and fire with fire and fire and fire with fire and fire with 24技.

[02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:19.300]

[02:59:19.300 --> 02:59:20.900]
cost of drugs in this country.

[02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:26.760]
The 62-28 boat attached to the measure pending Medicare Prescription Drug Bill moving through

[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:29.940]
Congress, where approval in the House in Senate was expected by the end of next week,

[02:59:30.340 --> 02:59:33.820]
lawmakers, especially those living in states' border in Canada, have been pressing for

[02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:37.840]
the change for years, spurred especially by senior citizens in their states who board

[02:59:37.840 --> 02:59:42.600]
buses across the border and by cheaper drugs in Canada, but the provision includes a measure

[02:59:42.600 --> 02:59:44.360]
that could prevent it from ever becoming law.

[02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:49.220]
It requires the Secretary of HHS to help the human services to certify that the

[02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:50.480]
re-importation can be done safely.

[02:59:50.840 --> 02:59:55.420]
Congress passed a similar law once before, but HHS Secretary of the Umshis Donna, excuse

[02:59:55.420 --> 02:59:58.860]
me for being at the U of M, Chalela, would not certify that it could be done without

[02:59:58.860 --> 02:59:59.720]
risk to her patients.

[03:00:00.300 --> 03:00:03.320]
Her successor, Tommy Cheezhead Thompson, said the same.

[03:00:03.880 --> 03:00:05.340]
That didn't stop the Senate from acting.

[03:00:05.520 --> 03:00:10.220]
Senator Byron Dorgon, Democrat of North Dakota, successfully argued that Canada's safety

[03:00:10.220 --> 03:00:14.060]
controls were just as reliable as those in the U.S. and U.S. consumers have nothing to fear

[03:00:14.060 --> 03:00:16.000]
from drugs, law from Canadian pharmacies.

[03:00:16.260 --> 03:00:19.040]
So what about the boroughs Donna would get is a bunch of repressive assholes trying to

[03:00:19.040 --> 03:00:21.860]
like prevent people from saving money and getting ripped off by the drug companies here?

[03:00:22.220 --> 03:00:23.800]
How can they galag you if you save money?

[03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:28.040]
That's what I'm just saying.

[03:00:28.140 --> 03:00:28.220]
Right.

[03:00:29.220 --> 03:00:30.880]
They're trying to prevent you from saving money.

[03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:33.720]
And the Republicans should not want to do that to them.

[03:00:33.800 --> 03:00:33.940]
No.

[03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:36.960]
No, they want you to like, they want you to empty out your pockets and give it all to

[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:38.320]
them and their buddies is what about boroughs now.

[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:41.220]
Just empty your pockets, empty your bracket out and leave it to us.

[03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:41.960]
Trust us with it.

[03:00:41.980 --> 03:00:42.560]
We'll take care of it.

[03:00:42.560 --> 03:00:43.800]
We'll hold it for you.

[03:00:43.840 --> 03:00:44.320]
Right.

[03:00:44.460 --> 03:00:45.080]
We'll invest it.

[03:00:45.160 --> 03:00:47.980]
We'll call up Mitch Hirsch.

[03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:49.700]
Somebody that we can trust.

[03:00:50.040 --> 03:00:51.420]
Somebody with a great track record.

[03:00:54.680 --> 03:00:56.220]
5670560, pound 560.

[03:00:56.340 --> 03:00:56.740]
Absolutely.

[03:00:57.060 --> 03:01:00.700]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Lone, which of these are you most sick and tired of

[03:01:00.700 --> 03:01:03.140]
hearing about reality TV shows 74.

[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:06.000]
Scott Lacey Peterson, 48.

[03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:06.480]
Scrum.

[03:01:07.160 --> 03:01:09.340]
Who the hell needs to hear about those assholes anymore?

[03:01:09.340 --> 03:01:12.000]
What about she's, you know, she ain't feeling good.

[03:01:12.400 --> 03:01:12.600]
No.

[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:13.400]
How's the baby doing?

[03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:18.100]
The Hillary book 43, the new Harry Potter book 29, enough with Harry Potter already.

[03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:19.100]
Okay, enough of that.

[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:20.260]
It was nerdy little kids.

[03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:23.320]
Oh, they look like him.

[03:01:23.440 --> 03:01:24.440]
They smell like him.

[03:01:24.560 --> 03:01:25.520]
They talk like him.

[03:01:25.740 --> 03:01:28.880]
They're not like a little bunch of torpy nerds.

[03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:30.340]
I'm the sniffety snitch.

[03:01:30.460 --> 03:01:31.380]
Yes, sniff this.

[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:33.140]
Was old in the whiffer witch.

[03:01:33.320 --> 03:01:34.980]
The Middle East Roadmap 27.

[03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:36.740]
Neel's movie show is 26.

[03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:38.060]
Too bad.

[03:01:38.580 --> 03:01:40.160]
Weapons of mass destruction 25.

[03:01:41.020 --> 03:01:43.340]
How hot Jackie's Johnson is 22.

[03:01:44.320 --> 03:01:48.960]
Martha Stewart 17, golf 12, the Florida Marlins 8, and the Matrix you write only three.

[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:50.240]
So I guess that's old news.

[03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:51.520]
Right.

[03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:53.620]
Old news, ancient history.

[03:01:55.560 --> 03:01:56.080]
WQAM.

[03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:57.200]
Hi, Neil.

[03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:57.780]
Yes, sir.

[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:03.200]
Remember that guy that was talking about the Godfather with the guy who killed Hyman Rock?

[03:02:03.520 --> 03:02:03.980]
Absolutely.

[03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:10.740]
And it wasn't covered in the movie, but in the book, when the Godfather wanted to get

[03:02:10.740 --> 03:02:14.860]
Michael Holmes safely and get him cleared of the murder charge, they would get somebody

[03:02:14.860 --> 03:02:16.680]
who was terminally ill to confess.

[03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:22.260]
I always thought the implication was that this guy had to know this was a suicide mission

[03:02:22.260 --> 03:02:23.020]
to go kill Rock.

[03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:28.680]
And they took care of their families and perpetually.

[03:02:29.100 --> 03:02:31.340]
Well, no, that was Frankie Pentangely.

[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:32.160]
That was his deal.

[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:33.480]
Right.

[03:02:33.480 --> 03:02:35.920]
He's got in the bathtub and open up his wrists.

[03:02:36.480 --> 03:02:36.800]
Right.

[03:02:36.980 --> 03:02:38.860]
The his family would be taking care of that.

[03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:39.000]

[03:02:39.380 --> 03:02:41.200]
And we don't really ever know.

[03:02:41.940 --> 03:02:42.420]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:46.000]
In other words, you can assume that if you want, but I just got the feeling that, well,

[03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:47.980]
you're probably right, because how the hell was he going to get out of there?

[03:02:48.660 --> 03:02:48.820]
Right.

[03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:49.200]
Right.

[03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:52.520]
That's why I always thought, you know, he just opened his arms up and let him blow him

[03:02:52.520 --> 03:02:52.880]
all the way down.

[03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:54.100]
You could be right.

[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:55.960]
I thought he was ruddy.

[03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:57.600]
Nah, not too fast, though.

[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.420]
He was thinking, go to the front of the back.

[03:03:00.420 --> 03:03:02.080]
I think the answer is not fast enough.

[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:04.140]
Thanks a lot, Polly.

[03:03:04.180 --> 03:03:04.900]
Have a good summer.

[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:06.400]
George does just fine.

[03:03:06.500 --> 03:03:07.180]
Don't worry about him.

[03:03:07.180 --> 03:03:07.800]
Don't worry about him.

[03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:09.640]
He'll be fine, but he'll be okay.

[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:11.720]
I will, because it'll be the summer.

[03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:12.380]
He's a good.

[03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:14.420]
Take the canola.

[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:16.380]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, boy.

[03:03:16.460 --> 03:03:16.920]
Do you like them?

[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:17.880]
Chocolate cover canola.

[03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:19.680]
Doris market has got, oh boy.

[03:03:20.380 --> 03:03:21.280]
Woo, we ever had those?

[03:03:22.040 --> 03:03:22.360]
No.

[03:03:22.980 --> 03:03:23.620]
Oh, don't.

[03:03:23.940 --> 03:03:24.700]
Chocolate cover canola.

[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:26.340]
Now see, he wouldn't like it because he didn't like chocolate.

[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:28.060]
Plus, he likes crap, bland crap.

[03:03:28.060 --> 03:03:29.340]
Never have linser troubles.

[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:30.860]
The wife's been buying those lately.

[03:03:31.520 --> 03:03:31.880]
Linser?

[03:03:32.140 --> 03:03:32.900]
Linser truffles.

[03:03:32.900 --> 03:03:33.660]
They got us.

[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:36.240]
I had linser pilates for breakfast.

[03:03:38.580 --> 03:03:39.860]
Linser, is that screw-in?

[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:40.500]
That's doing that.

[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:42.820]
I thought maybe Dorine was doing it.

[03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:44.200]
She's the one with a big fat ass.

[03:03:45.700 --> 03:03:46.740]
Screw-in is doing it.

[03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:47.700]
It won't help that, Pichy.

[03:03:47.780 --> 03:03:48.200]
You kid me.

[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:49.200]
She won't smell any better.

[03:03:50.280 --> 03:03:51.300]
Screw-in is doing it.

[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:52.460]
What's he got the bellows out?

[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:53.160]
Is that what she's doing?

[03:03:53.620 --> 03:03:55.320]
Yeah, she's doing the bellow thing with her legs.

[03:03:55.780 --> 03:03:56.280]
The buck monster.

[03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.040]
Yeah, the buck monster.

[03:03:58.040 --> 03:03:58.480]
You're not a buck monster.

[03:03:58.600 --> 03:03:59.300]
Poor screw-in.

[03:03:59.560 --> 03:04:01.780]
And look, you could stand on your head.

[03:04:01.900 --> 03:04:02.960]
You could twist it into a pretzel.

[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:04.380]
You're still going to smell the same, honey.

[03:04:05.320 --> 03:04:09.700]
You're still going to be the same infection riddled piece of turd that you've always been.

[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:10.160]
What?

[03:04:10.900 --> 03:04:13.260]
Can you imagine what's crawling around inside of that body?

[03:04:13.520 --> 03:04:13.700]
Wow.

[03:04:14.520 --> 03:04:15.500]
You know who can tell you?

[03:04:15.620 --> 03:04:15.940]
Roy!

[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:18.800]
He's got the road, man.

[03:04:20.460 --> 03:04:21.140]
To a piece.

[03:04:21.800 --> 03:04:22.260]
I got it.

[03:04:22.840 --> 03:04:23.640]
I got it.

[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:23.780]
I got it.

[03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:26.200]
This is sports radio bicycle.

[03:04:26.200 --> 03:04:27.760]
You way, yeah.

[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:30.720]
You fudge back him?

[03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:31.880]
Coming up tonight.

[03:04:32.320 --> 03:04:36.340]
I'm inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story.

[03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:40.660]
They got us chanting along to their hit, poor some sugar on me.

[03:04:41.320 --> 03:04:43.580]
But could the song have been about sex?

[03:04:44.340 --> 03:04:46.500]
We'll find out from Death Lever.

[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:54.420]
What ever gave you the idea it was about sex.

[03:04:54.420 --> 03:04:56.340]
Sex, that is rich.

[03:04:56.540 --> 03:05:02.040]
Death Lever vocalist Joe Elliott spoke to inside the behind along with his manager Slavvy Gold.

[03:05:02.460 --> 03:05:04.200]
That song is not about sex.

[03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:05.360]
Right, definitely not.

[03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:08.580]
I specifically told the boys write a song about sugar.

[03:05:08.800 --> 03:05:11.940]
About how much you love sugar and you want it poured all over you.

[03:05:12.040 --> 03:05:18.360]
In fact, if you had the choose between getting sugar poured on you or the luscious love nectar of some hot paid poured on you,

[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:25.420]
you would definitely not go with a sweet sticky, glistening moisture dripping from the nuts.

[03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:26.880]
It's about sex.

[03:05:26.980 --> 03:05:28.740]
Yeah, it's totes about sex.

[03:05:28.960 --> 03:05:29.700]
I mean, well, you got it.

[03:05:29.860 --> 03:05:30.620]
Of course.

[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:35.280]
So why asks inside the behind, did they feel the need to lie?

[03:05:35.680 --> 03:05:38.480]
Listen, things ain't been too good for Death Lever since the 80s.

[03:05:38.620 --> 03:05:40.400]
We've been looking for ways to make some dough.

[03:05:40.620 --> 03:05:43.180]
So we're, we're doing a children's album.

[03:05:43.380 --> 03:05:46.640]
Yeah, we thought we could put some distance between us and love juices.

[03:05:46.640 --> 03:05:48.560]
But the bands are going to love this record too.

[03:05:48.680 --> 03:05:50.180]
Don't you worry, the boys ain't going to compromise.

[03:05:50.420 --> 03:05:51.940]
No way, we're going to rock you.

[03:05:52.320 --> 03:05:55.340]
You know, with songs like, my best friend is neat.

[03:05:55.700 --> 03:05:58.100]
And across the street with care today.

[03:05:58.300 --> 03:05:58.440]
Right.

[03:05:58.740 --> 03:06:01.900]
And they must do what mommy and daddy tell me.

[03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:04.520]
Oh my god.

[03:06:04.900 --> 03:06:05.320]
Oh my god.

[03:06:05.520 --> 03:06:06.540]
There they go.

[03:06:06.820 --> 03:06:07.260]
Come on.

[03:06:07.680 --> 03:06:10.680]
They're going to be, I want to take drugs and barbie.

[03:06:11.180 --> 03:06:12.900]
No, no, no, we all got to eat.

[03:06:13.900 --> 03:06:14.540]
Death Levered.

[03:06:15.040 --> 03:06:17.240]
A band's got to do what a band's got to do.

[03:06:17.720 --> 03:06:21.440]
But we'll all sure miss those references to female secretions.

[03:06:21.980 --> 03:06:27.640]
It's a big, juicy, shopping-want-look-it-show business tonight, on inside the behind.

[03:06:31.740 --> 03:06:37.920]
The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to Dhamma people killed.

[03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:44.420]
With the gas that we sold him, first time aggressor nation and the only one that's going.

[03:06:44.800 --> 03:06:48.780]
Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing.

[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:55.080]
Forget about Korea and the notes they're totem at the right wing.

[03:06:55.700 --> 03:07:00.240]
He's drilling it over and over into our head.

[03:07:00.240 --> 03:07:06.600]
Her daddy rag has some, famines of mass destruction.

[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:19.680]
3000 people killed.

[03:07:20.620 --> 03:07:23.380]
I'm not forgotten, let's exploit them instead.

[03:07:23.380 --> 03:07:25.940]
Hey, there's oil to be counted.

[03:07:26.240 --> 03:07:28.160]
Going after Saddam too.

[03:07:28.640 --> 03:07:30.020]
Plankato Samma.

[03:07:30.380 --> 03:07:34.020]
There's no longer mention of the name it lauded.

[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:36.500]
But no one seems concerned all.

[03:07:36.820 --> 03:07:38.500]
Come be in complacence.

[03:07:38.800 --> 03:07:42.120]
Believe in every word of this cartel administration.

[03:07:42.860 --> 03:07:48.380]
That controls us by fear through media manipulation and the right wing.

[03:07:48.380 --> 03:07:53.700]
He's drilling it over and over into our heads.

[03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:56.600]
That I rag mess up.

[03:07:57.300 --> 03:07:59.920]
Weapons of mass destruction.

[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:14.820]
The loss of civil rights is the price that we're paying.

[03:08:14.820 --> 03:08:18.800]
We're all suspects now, not the ash crop is saying.

[03:08:19.380 --> 03:08:20.760]
I have nothing to hide.

[03:08:21.200 --> 03:08:22.980]
Tables, bonkers, all are saying.

[03:08:23.400 --> 03:08:26.880]
Blind obedient cattle don't have any reservations.

[03:08:27.540 --> 03:08:30.820]
Bout a provoked battle and world annihilation.

[03:08:31.740 --> 03:08:35.060]
Old regimes must fall and have a virgin installed.

[03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:37.320]
With no objection at all.

[03:08:37.720 --> 03:08:41.440]
Timber crack don't have the balls and the right wing.

[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:47.540]
He's drilling it over and over into our parade watchtap.

[03:08:47.840 --> 03:08:49.560]
I rag pass up.

[03:08:50.320 --> 03:08:52.740]
Weapons of mass destruction.

[03:08:53.880 --> 03:08:54.900]
All we're buying.

[03:08:55.240 --> 03:08:57.660]
Only I rag pass up.

[03:08:58.420 --> 03:09:01.060]
Weapons of mass destruction.

[03:09:05.420 --> 03:09:07.700]
Bye bye bye.

[03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:15.140]
If I had the ability to do I take you out here right now.

[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:16.700]
I'm taking your goddamn teeth in.

[03:09:17.060 --> 03:09:17.060]
