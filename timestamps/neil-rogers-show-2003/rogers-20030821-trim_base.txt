[00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.880]
You know the replacement for Jimmy Smith who got busted for Coke and Jacksonville, allegedly,

[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.640]
and he's going to be out for games, substance abuse.

[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.620]
JJ Stokes gets the start for Jacksonville.

[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.000]
His first time in 11 starting in a battle.

[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.400]
Nolan Ryan, last week, remember him, obviously, the strikeout king last Saturday at his

[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.420]
double-a ballpark in Round Rock, Texas, had a promotion where he pitched 10 lucky winners

[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.280]
of a contest.

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:11.740]
The first guy up Kevin Semansky, his dream was just a dream come true to have to face Nolan Ryan on the mountain.

[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.580]
So in 56 year old, Nolan Ryan said before taking the mountain's goal, it's not that he didn't hit anybody.

[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.400]
The very first pitch, 90 miles an hour right in the guys back.

[00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:21.780]
All right.

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.060]
That's great.

[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.600]
That is...

[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.160]
I saw Nolan.

[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.800]
Wheat.

[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.940]
I love it.

[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.160]
And the guy said quote afterwards, it's the coolest thing that's ever happened to me.

[00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.820]
I can't wait to tell my kids I got drilled by Nolan Ryan.

[00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.240]
What is his ailment, Nolan?

[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.220]
They have like Van Arthritis or some kind of like...

[00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.340]
I think it takes Ad Mill.

[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.260]
He's got Crotch Rod or something.

[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.480]
No, you see him on the top.

[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.660]
That's...

[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.480]
That's Mo that has that.

[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.300]
Did you like that shirt?

[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.260]
He wore today to work.

[00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:46.860]
Yeah, but what does it say people on there?

[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.220]
It says I'm not an F and people person, but what does it say if people?

[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.340]
I just...

[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.840]
You just say I'm not an F and person.

[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.460]
It's what it's like.

[00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.680]
All right.

[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.400]
Hey, yeah.

[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.400]
Look at the beast piling on there.

[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.880]
The beast...

[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.960]
I love Howard.

[00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.360]
The new Heimler, Peter Howard.

[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.520]
Why don't you say something honest for once in your life, a little fat tub of crap?

[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.460]
Why don't you just admit you hate him like poison?

[00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.740]
Yeah.

[00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.160]
And you wish he would die.

[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.540]
Yeah.

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.420]
Come on.

[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.320]
I think you should so blow now because the...

[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.540]
Why not?

[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.520]
I want you to say it.

[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.460]
I want you to say it.

[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.400]
I don't want to put any words in your mouth or anything else.

[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.320]
But I want you to say it.

[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.120]
I hate him like poison and I wish Mo would die.

[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.120]
I don't wish he would...

[00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.040]
I don't wish anyone would die.

[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.320]

[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.420]
I hate him like poison.

[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.080]
That's a good story.

[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.400]
Okay.

[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.260]
And I wish his crotch route would accelerate at a very reasonable rate.

[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.360]
No, because then he would pick it more.

[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.100]
And I don't want to see that.

[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.440]
Come on.

[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.760]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.380]
Anyway, so he picks it just because you turn him into a meatful.

[00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.200]
After the meeting yesterday, I believe that that is harassment and I can sue.

[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.820]
Yeah.

[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.980]
Some lady at the meeting, I swear to God.

[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.280]
Some little girl in the meeting went like this.

[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.660]
At the very end of the meeting with like no time left in the meeting.

[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.980]
Yeah.

[00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.340]
This little nimrod it raises her hand and she says.

[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:57.420]
I like to know if there is any way that Neil Rogers show falls into the category of indecent and the same with femurals.

[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.920]
Yeah.

[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.280]
And I went shut up bitch.

[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.740]
Yeah.

[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:02.760]
God almighty.

[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.540]
What do I got to listen to you complaining?

[00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.680]
The kicker in the groin.

[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.060]
She's back in the business office.

[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.600]
You don't get the cheque straight honey.

[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.160]
Go home.

[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.140]
It's a big day for you today, my friend.

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.660]
Why?

[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.640]
See, we got a, I got a cop out because George was on in July.

[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.820]
See, most of the time except Tuesdays and Thursdays.

[00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.780]
Can't you get my buddy out of my day?

[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.220]
I know I'm gonna get him a job or something.

[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.580]
We've had in this trend.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.240]
I mean, it would probably be okay, George.

[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.660]
But when it's a little on the downside and then we can always blame George.

[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.160]
But the morning better go away up now because he got no excuses.

[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.200]
You got a full, uh...

[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.360]
Yeah, one thing somebody taught me once is there and you taught me because you know more than me.

[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.640]
I said, the first trend is usually good.

[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.040]
If the second trend goes down, then the book is good.

[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.420]
If the boat trends are up, it's a bad book.

[00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.840]
You're not even warm, man.

[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.720]
You're not even lukewarm.

[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.680]
But I don't know anything.

[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.340]
I don't care about these things.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.300]
The first trend goes down because whatever the previous format is is disappearing,

[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.020]
whether it's music or whatever.

[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.660]
Personnel.

[00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.700]
This is the one most of what he's going down.

[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.460]
Absolutely.

[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.920]
Oh, yeah.

[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.560]
I don't sell.

[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.520]
Yeah, oh, brother.

[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.380]
Yeah, he's double-jointed.

[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.980]
He's going to be the next round German.

[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.380]
So what are you doing double-jointed?

[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.840]
Hey, now.

[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.100]
So what's the next step?

[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.580]
If he's on mode to go F himself, he just might give it a shot.

[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.660]
What's the next step?

[00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.640]
I don't go F yourself.

[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.660]
You've pathetical juice.

[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.960]
So what is it?

[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.780]
It comes out at 11.30 or something.

[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.340]
We have a 30-minute.

[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.440]
We have those results that this is the rating show, Buster.

[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.820]
This is the one where we give it a shot.

[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.740]
So what time are you going to do?

[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.300]
Hey, I heard that I know you're not anywhere near British Columbia.

[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.920]
I took five, two questions, three questions for you.

[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.240]
And real quickly, real quickly.

[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.660]
Hey, there's a new, there's a new SARS outbreak in Vancouver.

[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.960]
Headed your way.

[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.640]
141 people are dead.

[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.660]
And your way.

[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.800]
The second question is.

[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.680]
Is your opinion of Bill?

[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.180]
By the way, the SARS is going to go out again.

[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.480]
Here.

[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.000]
Neil.

[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.520]
Neil.

[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.000]
Hello.

[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.640]
Neil.

[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.080]
Tell me about Todd.

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.100]
Before the show, Todd Gill is going to team up with Tim Horton on the Panther Defense.

[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.440]
They're bringing back all the dead people.

[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.140]
They're going to bring back, we're going to sign up Bobby.

[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.640]
Or we're going to try to rehab his knees.

[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.080]
I'm going to joke.

[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.540]
Tell me what an insult to the fans.

[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.320]
Todd Gill.

[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.140]
Who do you think is going to win the Battle of the Biacryphal?

[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.840]
The Brazilian music.

[00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.140]
Plus, you see, Kujo's got a broken ankle now.

[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.200]
Nice calling, Kujo.

[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.740]
Oh, no.

[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.580]
They hear it, Toronto.

[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.480]
We can't stand you.

[00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.060]
You turn cold.

[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.820]
Yeah, you push it.

[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.100]
You dig it and outy push it.

[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.240]
How do you try to stuck with him?

[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.580]
Yeah.

[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.020]
Everyone's right on the verge of taking him.

[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.960]
They've made it in the exam.

[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.140]
Come to find out he was covering up a broken ankle.

[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.480]
Don't the lips told me that Kujo's having surgery too?

[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]
The little lips told you that?

[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.500]
Yeah.

[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.040]
Can you get him a job and get him out of my life?

[00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.960]
Who the hell is that?

[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.740]
That's Sharpie.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.980]
That's the kids sitting in for the OD victim.

[00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.340]
Oh, God.

[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.240]
I'm plenty handed job.

[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.180]
No, he just unpaid intern on leave from the Nova Scotia hospital that started the virus.

[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.460]
Oh, I feel like I really like unpaid a lot.

[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.360]
Now, what's the other questions?

[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.380]
Can you give it to him and do you believe that there's a new competition between impotence pills,

[00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.900]
between the Viagra Blue Pill and a new men's pill and then the chick pill that you want to share in this morning?

[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.100]
The pressure is on Scott Ferell, man.

[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.400]
You better have double digits.

[00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.420]
And you do know what's going to happen.

[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.140]
If we get a big spike in the morning show in this train, you know who's going to be taking credit for it?

[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.460]
Absolutely.

[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.480]
You know what you mean?

[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.280]
You can't break down in the trains.

[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.540]
You can't break down the R by our Chilahoe book himself.

[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:13.000]
So he's got two months where if you have a big number eight to ten, he can be saying,

[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.060]
well, you see, I told you if they just would put a sports show on, he's going to be a second-hand.

[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.180]
That's a great read to have.

[00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.240]
I said, good luck to you, sir.

[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.380]
And he said, what's that supposed to mean?

[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.320]
I just kept walking.

[00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.020]

[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.820]
He's a little slow.

[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.760]
Have a great day, Scott.

[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.720]
Good luck in her ratings.

[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.580]
You'll lead us, we don't.

[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.400]
Thanks, you, Hooratman.

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.620]
Hooratman.

[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.440]
Hooratman, a lot to me.

[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:41.840]
I was somewhere rolls around, there's nothing I like more than sitting on the front porch with a nice cold glass of country moment lemonade.

[00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.560]
The only thing they could make it better would be a pretty little girl sitting next to me.

[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.860]
Now, I'll wait a second.

[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.420]
A pretty little naked girl.

[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.780]
Yeah, that's what I meant.

[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.800]
No, no, wait.

[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.700]
A pretty little naked girl that puts her hand on my thigh and starts rubbing real gentle like it.

[00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.860]
No, no, no, I got it.

[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.500]
A pretty little naked girl rubbing my thigh, talking dirty in my air, throwing me on the porch and has her way with me.

[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.460]
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.800]
She just starts pounding me, man, riding the hog screaming, do me, baby, do me.

[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.980]
Give it to mama.

[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.580]
Yeah.

[00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.440]
Oh, forget the damn lemonade, man.

[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.400]
Just give me a naked girl.

[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.760]
Come on.

[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.900]
I need a little idea.

[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.880]
He said, 1006, that grandpa sure is a sneaky old cool lady.

[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.000]
A good, good.

[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:26.440]
Speaking of old coots, no, that's the reason I used that word.

[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.300]
Speaking of old coots, you've had a great new pitcher.

[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.280]
Two new pitchers.

[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.400]
Of the moment, on our website, so go to nirrachis.com and take a puke at that.

[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.660]
In fact, you know, who really likes it a lot?

[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.300]
Is that aegriita que va caminando?

[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.900]
Yeah, yeah.

[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.320]
Yeah, he morphs into a cereal back and forth.

[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:46.400]
And she shares how it had a lot better teeth than that toothless picture, toothless mole that we got on there.

[00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.300]
And then we got the one that was taken by Zach.

[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.160]
Thanks a lot, Zach.

[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.520]
And watch your back and your crack.

[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.820]
Because he ought to watch his crack.

[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.700]
We ought to have a bit that says, watch your crack, Zach, because most are going to stick it to him.

[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.120]
First chance he gets.

[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.580]
Don't you think?

[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.600]
He's going to have to blame somebody when a summer book comes out, which is still a couple of months away.

[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.020]
But when a whole book comes out and he's got like, uh, those points, like a whole bunch of points.

[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.420]
But third man, he's going to have some explaining to do.

[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:13.880]
What do they blame Robert for a change?

[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.440]
Uh, he's got naked pictures of some person.

[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.160]
Apparently, the reason he could still be there, he's a loser that kid.

[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.300]
He really is.

[00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:26.220]
Anyway, it's 10-07 already at 5-60 WQM and unbeknownst to me, clearance came in this morning.

[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.340]
Fresh from his latest orgy with the beast.

[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.120]
All refreshed, said there were scratches and other balls.

[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:31.900]
What did he say?

[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.420]
Something about balls.

[00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.180]
Yeah.

[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.580]
I love your nuts.

[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.980]
I think it was something like, uh, he wish he had some clearance, but at any rate.

[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.220]
And he announced probably that we had this trend coming out.

[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.260]
Now, those of you who get, you know, bored by the ratings and all of that, too bad.

[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.720]
Because it's our life blood baby.

[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.020]
It's what it's all about, right?

[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.660]
That's where we're, uh, good or bad.

[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.800]
We got to live with it.

[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.480]
And of course, there's pressure on George too.

[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.800]
I don't want to mention that, huh?

[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.840]
I don't know.

[00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.100]
Well, when you'll do better this summer than last summer, because last summer, and I want to announce,

[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.900]
although I don't want to come by chickens before 2 o'clock, but you do notice that it's the last Thursday of my Tuesdays and Thursdays.

[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.160]
Right.

[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.380]
By the way, Norm Kent is an idiot.

[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.680]
I called me yesterdays an idiot.

[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.740]
And now I want to do this bobble head doll and go, just go away, Norma, just leave me alone.

[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.240]
Go away.

[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.640]
But, uh, this is the last Thursday and I did I miss one Tuesday or Thursday this summer?

[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.200]
No, no, no, no, no, did not.

[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:23.820]
What do you mean you don't think so?

[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:27.160]
I haven't had a situation in February when I had that little upholumentary embolism.

[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.360]
See, I don't know whether they really classify that as a stroke or not, you know what I mean?

[00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:32.400]
Let's count it.

[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:33.740]
Sounds more impressive.

[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:34.940]
I see.

[00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.860]
Three strokes in your outvalued.

[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:37.440]
I got to them.

[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.140]
No, seriously, I don't know what they really call that.

[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.000]
Other than like, uh, cuts off the oxygen flow to your brain, which is why it's a lot of strength.

[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:44.120]
Right.

[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.740]
But in any rate, so when this trend comes out today, you're going to be a lot of pressure on, uh,

[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.740]
Farell that morning number of Heather, better start spiking, better start going up somewhere.

[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.760]
Because it's, uh, it was embarrassing.

[00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.540]
Am I right?

[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.060]
Absolutely.

[00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.340]
And then of course, midday, we'll see if George is, uh, trading the market.

[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.780]
Because we had, oh no, because we're dropping off a very, uh, pretty decent April.

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.800]
And, uh, you know, we're keeping a really good June.

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:12.180]
And this is May, June and July is what these three months of the arbitrains are going to be for all you ratings experts out there.

[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.260]
All you losers in the radio business and I feel sorry for you.

[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:23.860]
George's pool yesterday was a good pool for a change, but the problem is the responses absolutely sucked.

[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.160]
You'll notice that, huh?

[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.840]
Yes, I did notice that.

[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.600]
I'm looking at it right now.

[00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:30.140]
I'm going to print it out so I can read the result because it's a long list.

[00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:31.320]
It'll kill some time.

[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.420]
Then we got that long paragraph from the Hillary book.

[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.780]
Yes.

[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.360]
I got this down to a science.

[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.480]
And then we got the trans commited 1130.

[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.060]
And then of course, we got the big one to two hour.

[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:39.840]
We got this lit.

[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.180]
And then we say bye-bye.

[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.960]
And then of course, it all comes crashing down next week when we go back to our regular schedule.

[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.340]
Norm, you're an idiot, man.

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.700]
Give him way too much back.

[00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.800]
Do we have, do I still have a studio in Amsterdam?

[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.140]
Oh.

[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:52.980]
I don't even have an apartment in Amsterdam anymore.

[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.660]
So, uh, so, you know, what's the big deal?

[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:55.780]
Given too much back.

[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.000]
How many weeks of vacation did I give him back?

[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.020]
About 30, man.

[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:01.320]
Who got a damn many?

[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.880]
How come I'm here like a little echo today?

[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.140]
Although it does sound good.

[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.100]
Sounds like we're doing a reverb.

[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.640]
Uh, maybe just my overheads up.

[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:06.920]
Huh?

[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:08.440]
No, no, keep it that it sounds good.

[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.140]
Sounds like WABC in the good old days.

[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.260]
But radio was radio and there was a reason to have one.

[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:13.820]
And that's it.

[00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:15.800]
Yeah, let's crack it up real loud.

[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.100]
How's that?

[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:21.540]
So anyway, Georgia's pool yesterday, which movie do you wish they'd make a sequel to?

[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:23.020]
Good question.

[00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.580]
And of course, that was my, see, I, that was my first mistake.

[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.960]
I gave you the guy's name question.

[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:28.840]
The day before when you screwed up that other pool.

[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:29.560]
I inspired him.

[00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:31.600]
But at any rate, no, it was a good, good question.

[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.920]
But the responses were embarrassing.

[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.940]
The history of the world part one was tied with pulp fiction for number one with 91 votes of peace.

[00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.120]
Or with 92 now, peace.

[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:43.040]
Well, I'm not going to have to.

[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.180]
Blade Runner 51.

[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.920]
Close encounters of the third kind.

[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.280]
You turn 50.

[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.840]
I mean, what a piece of crap.

[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:52.140]
Yeah.

[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.160]
That was the movie that made me despise Richard Dreyfus.

[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.660]
He gives me the Willie's man.

[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.680]
He's a walking ant-parenty-semitism.

[00:11:59.460 --> 00:11:59.700]
He chose.

[00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:03.020]
No, he just acts like it.

[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.020]
A clockwork orange 49.

[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.360]
Now, see, what do we need a sequel for?

[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.080]
I guess we've had heard.

[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.380]
So now he's going to go get revenge on George and Dan.

[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.920]
Yeah, no, that's a possibility.

[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.420]
Independence Day 34, big trouble, little China 32.

[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.620]
Some of these movies and every minute.

[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.880]
Boogie nights 29.

[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.540]
I mean, once, once you saw that package, what would you need to see?

[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:27.080]
I thought, I thought that ended just perfect.

[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.300]
Once we saw the package, the big D, the big rack in the sand.

[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.140]
And then, you can go find it.

[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.240]
And his crack.

[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.400]
Slinglay 29.

[00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.620]
Did I say, Rimo Williams also 29?

[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.220]
Usual Suspect 27.

[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.860]
The thing 25.

[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.500]
See, these punks who vote on his poll, the thing, the original movie,

[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.040]
the thing was maybe before they were born.

[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:48.360]

[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:49.540]
We're talking about it.

[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.240]
I better do the break, and then we can kill some more time with the rest of this poll.

[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.960]
Nice job, by the way, there's a whole bunch more to read.

[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.400]
That's good.

[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.180]
Anything to kill time in the summertime, because we're well aware that there's nobody there.

[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:05.860]
Then I hear a Mark Morgan, my good friend this morning, saying that every, every highway is like just a wreck all over town today.

[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.220]
I, 75, was jammed up.

[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.600]
How can that be when there's nobody there?

[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:09.240]
How many people?

[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:11.220]
How many people were actually there for the month of august?

[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.120]
Factor, the man.

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.400]
And there's still, I still can't drive for crap, for Schmidt.

[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.080]
No.

[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.040]
What is wrong with you people?

[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:17.780]
Get off the road.

[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.040]
Oh, there's Ernie Eves.

[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.740]
What a loser he is.

[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:24.700]
Great, over 28 to 29,000 megawatts of power in any one given day.

[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.440]
The highest we've ever used.

[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:30.280]
Oh, the good news is we haven't had any brown outs, no black outs, no brown eyes.

[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.720]
Everything is coming along just fine.

[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.020]
Now, what's going to be pretty scorchingly?

[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.520]
It's going to be 32 or 33, are you running your AC?

[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.460]
You know, when the time comes to have your car, listen, I've done damn well, man.

[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.360]
I keep my AC off as much as possible.

[00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.120]
I turn the lights off when I walk out of here.

[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.640]
I get everything in the off position.

[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:47.340]
I get off as much as I can.

[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.240]
And what, you know, I'm doing my part.

[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.500]
I'm doing my duty.

[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.420]
In fact, you heard it this morning.

[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.720]
I did my duty twice.

[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.340]
When the time comes to have your car, it's clean.

[00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.120]
There's only one company ought to be talking to.

[00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.560]
And that's my good friends of dry concepts.

[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.720]
I've used them in my house for over 20 years for a lot longer than anybody could imagine.

[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.020]
Anybody would be around in town.

[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.440]
But the fact is they're the best in the world.

[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.620]
So why use anybody else?

[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:12.940]
They're the only company that really dry cleans your car, it's an exclusive patented method.

[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.180]
Dry cleaning your car, it sucks out the deep down crap.

[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.440]
That's why you're entering the fibres of your car, it makes them look and smell just like brand new, lemony fresh.

[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.080]
And they last a lot longer too.

[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.680]
And right now our friends at dry concepts offer you an opportunity to say 15% on your next car for cleaning.

[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.240]
They know it's the dog days of summer.

[00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.140]
That's why they do a little extra incentive for you to do it right now, which is a good time anyway.

[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:34.500]
Before the kids go back to school.

[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.520]
Whether the kids go back to school next week, Monday and Rower.

[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.100]
Just in time for me to be back in town so I can drive through all the extra traffic.

[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:42.420]

[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.320]
5-1-Local, this is 5-6-6.

[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.860]
The radio's all yours now.

[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.080]
Q-A-N.

[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.980]
Only in the Banana Republic, baby. Only in Miami.

[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:39.760]
Chelsea Victoria Clinton arrived three weeks early on February 27th, 1980, at 11-24pm.

[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:48.140]
While I was recovering, Bill would put his foot on my throat, yank me by my hair and say, woman, don't spoil her.

[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:50.240]
I said okay.

[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.920]
Chelsea was sold by her opium-addicted father when she was eight years old.

[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.960]
Chelsea looked at him and said bad things about her daddy. That sealed the decision for Bill.

[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.940]
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:12.920]
But even more frightening, at the age of 15, Chelsea had come back to haunt us.

[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.540]
She escaped and returned home, only to be sold again to a whorehouse.

[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.460]
Who would want to do that to kids who had never done anything to them?

[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.560]
Me, Hillary, Rotem, Clinton.

[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.260]
Chelsea said, come on mom, don't do it.

[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.240]
Oh yeah, right I said.

[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:41.360]
Looking like a dazed boxer who had just been pummeled in the ring, she leaned toward me and whispered in my ear, you bitch.

[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.560]
Yeah, isn't that better than my wasting time reading from that stupid book?

[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.960]
Oh, but better.

[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.300]
I'm not doing that anymore.

[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:48.900]
Promise?

[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.200]
Aren't you happy? Aren't you bad?

[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.440]
It's just a bad book.

[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:57.240]
I mean, if there was something interesting in the hero be something really revealing, you know, great.

[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.000]
Something juicy.

[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:04.080]
There's nothing revealing. There's nothing juicy. There's nothing exciting. There's nothing, uh, anything. It's crap.

[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.580]
It's a pile of crap.

[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.700]
So I'd rather play those Hillary little drop in, which are done very well, by the way.

[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.100]
Because that's really her.

[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:12.560]
Right.

[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.180]
But I mean, boy, they digitally put together. It's a beautiful thing.

[00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:21.720]
Oh, now, you think this is the, uh, can we hear the George tapes or this is the retire? Which one is this?

[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:22.340]
Neither one.

[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.960]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:25.580]
You look good morning. How are you?

[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:26.380]
A real call?

[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.440]
Yes, actually, but unfortunately I have some bad news.

[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:30.100]
Yes.

[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.080]
Yesterday evening at 8.30, I had a radio accident on 6.10.

[00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.260]
Phil Henry had Anne Colter in the studio doing an interview.

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.500]
Are you sure?

[00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:44.160]
I'm unfortunate.

[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.380]
You have to be joking, man.

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.580]
I actually listened just long enough to make sure that he wasn't doing a voice.

[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.420]
Because that was my first time.

[00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:53.020]
I thought that he could not be, I mean, I mean, he can't really be doing it.

[00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.800]
And he was sucking up to her.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.460]
I mean, he was, he was the most.

[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.500]
He was sucking.

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:57.780]

[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.640]
And Colter's smelly, not he asked.

[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.640]
Oh, my God. The sucking up is the most, you know, um,

[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.080]
puts it under statement.

[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.540]
He was, he was kissing big time.

[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:09.240]
Here's a message for Anne Colter.

[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.140]
We know you're listening because she lives in Miami now.

[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.400]
You're big, you slut, you whore.

[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:13.700]
Yeah.

[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:14.480]
Yeah.

[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.520]
Oh, it was, it was a big, so he's done, he's done the total metamorphosis

[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.640]
from being Mr. Radical and Mr. Off the Wall, Mr. Humor,

[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.000]
into being just the right-winged Schill as all he is now.

[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.000]
It's really sad.

[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:25.660]
Okay.

[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.420]
Yeah. Thanks for the bad news.

[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:27.820]
Thank you.

[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:28.600]
Well, there you go.

[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.060]
At least he didn't go halfway.

[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:31.740]
He made the a full turn in Ormysand.

[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:31.920]
Yeah.

[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.520]
Wow.

[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.000]
He must have drank some of that Dr. Jica and Mr. Dave Hyde potion,

[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.400]
you know what?

[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.220]
I think it's that wife.

[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.640]
Is that it?

[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.040]
Yeah.

[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.280]
I don't think that's got anything to do with it.

[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.940]
I think he, uh, he ran dry with the other rack.

[00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.520]
I think everybody in the world was onto it.

[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:47.960]
And I think he ran on a material and got to be a bitter,

[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.840]
a rotten, a right-wing, nasty old man.

[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.520]
How do you like that?

[00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.180]
Ain't by like it?

[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:51.340]
No.

[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:51.620]

[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.080]
Traject.

[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:54.100]
Anyway, getting back to your, uh, survey.

[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.400]
The thing 25, contract, these, I don't understand it.

[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.280]
Oh, and don't let me forget to talk at great length

[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.460]
about bowling for Columbine.

[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:02.760]
Okay.

[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.020]
No, seriously, everybody in this audience, just speaking of a clockwork orange,

[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.240]
everybody ought to be forced.

[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.100]
They ought to be tied into a chair.

[00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.360]
Eyes propped open with toothpicks and forced to watch bowling for Columbine.

[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.180]
That's how good it is.

[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.020]
And then of course there'd be those right-wingers out there.

[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:20.300]
Well, just more of that anti-USA propaganda ride.

[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:22.240]
More than Canadian propaganda, eh?

[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:27.100]
But if he doesn't do a great slice job on Charlton Heston and Dick Clark.

[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.220]
I never realized Dick Clark was such an asshole.

[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:29.720]
I had no idea.

[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.580]
I mean, how much do we do?

[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:30.820]
Huh?

[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:31.300]
Nothing.

[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:31.940]
We don't know anything.

[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.440]
Do you son of a bitch?

[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.180]
Oh, the interview with Charlton Heston is just, it's scintillating.

[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:37.040]
And he got ripped.

[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.180]
He was very clever in a way he worked his way in there.

[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.760]
He told, he told, he was a card-carrying member of the NRA and, you know,

[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.360]
Heston told him, well, come back tomorrow morning.

[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.220]
I think I can fit you in.

[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.540]
And he first hits now with him and he whips it out.

[00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:51.060]
And his card, too, is NRA card.

[00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:51.500]
Yeah.

[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.740]
Wow, and he passed him on, you know, Heston passed him on the arm out.

[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.420]
Good, good boy.

[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.100]
Good boy, you know.

[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:56.520]
But.

[00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.340]
And then he starts grilling him and then when he brings the picture of that little grill

[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.420]
like I shot in Michigan, in Flint.

[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.820]
And he just keeps walking away.

[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.280]
It's just a beautiful thing.

[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.580]
And the thing you haven't seen yet is the Dick Clark segment where he's sitting in the van

[00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.000]
with all his cronies, with all of his buddies.

[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.280]
And he's got the picture and he's telling about the Dick Clark forward.

[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.880]
They hire all the welfare women.

[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.600]
They call it welfare working or something like that.

[00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:24.760]
They have some kind of a special program which doesn't work at all.

[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:29.560]
And here's the, this is the woman who's the mother of the kid that took the gun to school

[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.600]
and shot that little six-year-old girl we're talking about.

[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:36.680]
And the reason that the kid found the gun is because the mother was evicted from her home.

[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920]
She's working two jobs.

[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.000]
She has to get on a bus and go 60 miles to work every goddamn day.

[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:41.540]
They live in Flint.

[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:43.380]
She works in Detroit, two jobs.

[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:44.920]
It's some flood place.

[00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:47.580]
And then also with the Dick Clark place.

[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.400]
One of those oldies, the restaurant, so it's fully below any places.

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.100]
Don't subsidize Dick Clark.

[00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:53.600]
Does he still have that place at base side?

[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.860]
I don't know.

[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.640]
Don't anybody go there?

[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.420]
Okay, Dick Clark is an asshole.

[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.900]
Don't any, and see I always like Dick Clark.

[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:01.820]
I would love to pyramid.

[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.640]
We all grew up with bandstands.

[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.220]
He grew up on it.

[00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:06.340]
New Year's Eve.

[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.360]
He's like a legend.

[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.620]
And the good news is he's starting to look his age now, you know.

[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.740]
When he was 60, he looked.

[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.940]
But now he looks about 90s making up for it.

[00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:17.620]
There's no escape.

[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.920]
But wait till you see that.

[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:22.240]
Say, I am bringing my copy home for you because I know you're cheap and you're underpaid.

[00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.300]
No, I am.

[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.000]
I'm bringing it home.

[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:24.480]
Thank you.

[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:32.080]
But when he has him cornered in that van and he tells him who he is and Dick Clark already

[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:32.480]
is nervous.

[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:38.180]
Well, how come you hire these people and the little girl I got murdered by and Shut the door.

[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:38.780]
Shut the door.

[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:44.500]
And for some reason his assistance there seemed to be a little bit slow in shutting the door.

[00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.140]
They seem to be almost interested in whatever Michael Moore is talking about.

[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.080]
Shut the door.

[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.120]
There's a very angry pissed off Dick Clark.

[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:51.860]
They're fired.

[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:53.800]
Oh yeah, he won't see that no more.

[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.140]
Am I right?

[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:55.740]
Absolutely.

[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.520]
Okay, getting back to this thing.

[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.040]
I don't know why.

[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.640]
Well, look at that.

[00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.280]
Now this must be one of those people.

[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.240]
It's got to be a little cruel springs to the sun too.

[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:04.500]
Hello.

[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.360]
Coral springs.

[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:07.980]
Hey, yes sir.

[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.640]
Good morning.

[00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:09.060]
How you doing?

[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.720]
I'm good.

[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:09.900]
Great.

[00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.620]
I heard that interview last night on Phil Hendry and that previous caller, man.

[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:19.380]
You know, she wrote some kind of book about McCarthy from what I read.

[00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:19.460]
Right.

[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.840]
A ridiculous book where she said Joe McCarthy had never stole a freight train.

[00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:23.080]
Right.

[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:29.040]
And he's given her a rash of crap about saying, you know, he was such an evil person in McCarthy

[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.360]
and how could she come out and write a book in his behalf?

[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.620]
I mean, I was in the car and I almost stood up and gave him a salute because...

[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:36.800]
So, in other words, he ripped that colder.

[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:37.640]
He ripped her.

[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.240]
Yeah.

[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.000]
He said she said in her book or she said...

[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:40.440]
Are you sure?

[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.180]
Yeah, I'm positive.

[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.220]
I'm speaking up for you.

[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:51.260]
She said on an interview or in her book that liberal traders and Phil Hendry says, I'm a liberal

[00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.120]
and I'm a Democrat.

[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.200]
And I think he came out with some kind of statement.

[00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.060]
Well, how do you like that?

[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.920]
So, in other words, we got your call and the other call, which are diametrically opposed, which goes to show you that

[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.320]
who knows what those going on?

[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.700]
Who killed Doc Robin, you know what I'm saying?

[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.100]
It's Suds on the phone.

[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.600]
Last time he heard, he called in, I think, with a spy report on him.

[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:07.820]
Right.

[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.260]
When Phil was ripping me an ass, right?

[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:09.840]
Right.

[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:10.860]
And that was true.

[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.040]
I didn't hear that as well.

[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.180]
He's just bitter in jealous and that's the way it goes.

[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.880]
Plus, he's lost all his hair.

[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.100]
Okay, thanks for straightening it out.

[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:22.160]
One other thing that Dick Clark restaurant long gone out of business.

[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:23.740]
Oh, that's the best news.

[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.240]
Oh, right.

[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:24.500]
You're right.

[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:24.620]
You're right.

[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.320]
Thank you.

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.020]
You made my day.

[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.720]
He should only croak that Dick Clark.

[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.640]
We don't wish too many people to die, especially a nasty, smelly, wicked death, you know, like in a fiery car crash.

[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.560]
But in Dick Clark's case, we'll make an exception.

[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.420]
We'll get to your uphol results in a minute.

[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.080]
Hey, don't rush.

[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:41.940]
And then we got my pool, which I like, which ain't much, but you like my pool, huh?

[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.740]
Well, that's what the audience keeps saying.

[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.060]
1026 at 560 WQM, if you need to set your home fast, I know somebody needs to sell a home.

[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.020]
Oh, I got a message.

[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.280]
I don't like doing inside stuff.

[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.260]
But I have a message for my close personal friend, Boca Brian.

[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.420]
Don't buy a house.

[00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.280]
Not just a joke.

[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:57.720]
Don't get it.

[00:23:57.740 --> 00:23:58.880]
He gets so paranoid, you know.

[00:23:59.100 --> 00:23:59.540]
Hey, Brian.

[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.720]
Don't buy a house.

[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:06.120]
You need to set your home fast, fast cash home buyers, buyers houses, fast, hassle free.

[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.600]

We are supporting O560, U-A-S.

[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.380]
Yes.

[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.180]
No.

[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.620]
And I spread my thighs.

[00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:20.440]
And tore myself under toilet bowl.

[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.380]
I feel my bowels lose control of the toilet.

[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.180]
And there's a smell that makes you cry.

[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:40.900]
So bad I can barely see my knees as I make my screen and fingers squealing on the toilet.

[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.820]
It's not hard to hold the stand in a diabetic big hazmat.

[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.380]
It gets you there once a flipping on the sea.

[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.280]
It's okay to bear a sink.

[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.100]
Every mother's making fun of me.

[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.020]
An engine with a fancy gate.

[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.280]
Never thought to install a bedding.

[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:10.300]
Ain't too persal that night.

[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.460]
When you do jand inside my hole,

[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:19.360]
it's found in a broken wall.

[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.360]
Now maybe it's only me.

[00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:32.240]
Maybe I'm the only a fat diabetic person who's sat on the throne at times in my life.

[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.060]
I'm more than once.

[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.560]
And had a really difficult VM.

[00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:41.400]
You know, straining, squeezing, exerting, and I've thought of Elvis.

[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.280]
Now you never done that because you're not fat.

[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.900]
No, but still I've had a difficult VM.

[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.400]
You still had a really kind of like a concentrated VM.

[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.620]
You start thinking of Elvis.

[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.940]
It flashes in front of your face.

[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.500]
And you start thinking, oh, I don't want to die here on a crapper.

[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.800]
That would be a very happy way.

[00:26:58.880 --> 00:26:59.480]
That would be the goal.

[00:26:59.480 --> 00:26:59.900]
It would be.

[00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.860]
Oh my god.

[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.040]
Although I guess it doesn't really make any difference when you come right down to it.

[00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.400]
I guarantee that some of these calls that came out of nowhere here are probably more of this fill-hand reconversed.

[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:12.040]
Thank you, Phil.

[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.680]
Are you sure?

[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.560]
Here's a four-letter deal.

[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:14.740]
Hello.

[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.040]
Neil, good morning.

[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:16.480]
Yes, sir.

[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.060]
When is this?

[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:19.080]
You're just right.

[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.700]
Can I mention an encolter story?

[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:22.220]
Anything you like?

[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.640]
Okay.

[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.920]
She said one of the stupidest things I've ever heard last Friday.

[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:26.700]
How unusual.

[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:33.540]
She said that George W. Bush, when he was deploying the planes for the National Guard, he was exploring experimental planes.

[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:38.260]
He was more in danger in Texas than how Gore was in Vietnam because he had a bodyguard.

[00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:39.040]
Right.

[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.740]
I mean, could you believe that in Vietnam where there's landmines and there's guerrilla attacks and he's more in danger?

[00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.720]
Was this on the days that the W. was AWOL and nobody could find him?

[00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.420]
I think it's when he was in his drinking days.

[00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:51.160]
I see.

[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.160]
Is this when he kind of vanished and took a powder if I can use that expression?

[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:58.380]
That bitch lives in Miami, huh?

[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:58.980]
Yeah.

[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.560]
She's best buddies with Miss Fudge, Miss Amat Drudge.

[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.420]
Yeah, she was really brought out of the closet and that blinded by the right.

[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.740]
Yeah, it was great.

[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:08.500]
Party girl.

[00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.640]
I was thinking of where to live.

[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.660]
Amat Drudge is David Brock without the balls.

[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:12.760]
That's the only difference there.

[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.800]
You know, he's just David Brock with no balls.

[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:15.260]
You bet.

[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.480]
Thanks, Neil.

[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.460]
Thanks to the good news.

[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.100]
And Colter sucks we hate you and like poison, don't we?

[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.140]
I hate the world.

[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:21.960]
Anybody with a brain.

[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.040]
Okay, get back to your list.

[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.160]
Here's a bokeh.

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.380]
Hello.

[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.380]
Good morning, Neil.

[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:26.800]
How are you?

[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:27.920]
Pretty damn good.

[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:32.200]
I was actually on social last night, but you produced your said that his show was off the air.

[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:32.860]
It wasn't.

[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:34.880]
I heard my from the radio.

[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:36.540]
Wait a minute.

[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:36.960]
Wait a minute.

[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.560]
What do you mean my producer said his show was off the air?

[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:38.880]
I was on a call.

[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:43.140]
A few minutes ago he said that he heard that last night's share was off the air in Miami.

[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:45.400]
As we told me, it was a bike before I got on the phone with you.

[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:46.640]
You better ask him.

[00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:48.380]
Scott, you told us car there?

[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.260]
Open up the microphone, did.

[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.700]
Open a mic, Jack asked.

[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.260]
And talk.

[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:53.880]
Good morning.

[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.140]
Yes, good morning.

[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:55.440]
Speak.

[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.620]
You told him that the show was off the air last night?

[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.580]
Somebody had come into the control room and said that six times off the air.

[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.740]
Not for the whole night, but it was off for a little bit last night.

[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.480]
Well, I don't believe anything, Jose.

[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.220]
When they come in, they just kick their ass out.

[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.020]
Okay, go ahead, sir.

[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.420]
Anyway, so I said, I heard you're turning a little bit right wing.

[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.780]
And he said, you know, you're changing your spot.

[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:23.760]
And when you and Miami, you were very left and democratic.

[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.880]
I said, what happened to you?

[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.140]
He says, well, you've been listening to the Orojas for too long.

[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:29.100]
Are you serious?

[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.120]
I feel it.

[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.400]
It's worth a goodness.

[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.440]
Are you sure?

[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:34.740]
You said, have you listened to the Orojas for too long?

[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:35.700]
It's wearing off on me.

[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.540]
I see.

[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:38.220]
Okay, well, don't stop.

[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:39.660]
Don't worry.

[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:40.740]
That was like Daniel.

[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.700]
You too, Pally.

[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.460]
Thanks for the good news.

[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.200]
We had a little Phil controversy here to kill this first hour and a half

[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.220]
to where those ratings come out.

[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:46.600]
That's good.

[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:47.920]
Now, getting back to your pool.

[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.240]
Well, I'm doing a good job at Dragon Assault today.

[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.180]
No, I do.

[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.740]
Because this is like, I mean, it's not really all that significant other than it's a very sad day

[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.800]
because it's my last Thursday of these Tuesdays and Thursdays deals.

[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.400]
It's the last day of the summer's scan that I have going.

[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.460]
And then on Monday, it's like back to a five days week.

[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.680]
And I'm not too happy about that.

[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.400]
Back to the grind.

[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:10.740]
I'm thinking more like, maybe two weeks in November would be good for like five days a week.

[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.700]
And the rest of the year, Tuesday and Thursday suits me great.

[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.440]
And with the thing in contact, each had 25.

[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.220]
I have no idea what contact is.

[00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:18.700]
That's the Jody Foster movie about that.

[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.340]
Space aliens.

[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.180]
They built them in the...

[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.300]
I don't know from it.

[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.620]
And I can't stand Jody Foster.

[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.020]
Don't watch too much for me.

[00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:25.400]
Who friend drives your rabbit 24?

[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:28.460]
The Big Lewinsky and the Ocean's 11, each had 22.

[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:31.040]
Ocean's 11 needs to be a sequel.

[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.500]
I don't know. Never saw it.

[00:30:32.860 --> 00:30:33.960]
Oh my God.

[00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:39.200]
And the fact that they made that remake was primarily all belong in prison and Matt Damon probably have a good time.

[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:48.080]
Unbreakable 21, Starship Trooper 20, Logan's run 18, Tron 16, Buckaroo Bonzai and Memento 14.

[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:49.520]
Memento doesn't need a sequel.

[00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.400]
We'd all be in a rubber room.

[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:51.840]
Good.

[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:54.880]
Magnolia, which is obviously the correct...

[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.040]
The definitive answer, head only 12.

[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.160]
We're close to showing how mediocre well we don't have too many people in town.

[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.720]
Head only 12 votes for Magnolia.

[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:03.440]
That's the answer out of over 800.

[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.600]
Goonies 11, Starman 11, V, Head 8.

[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:09.340]
What the hell is V, vagina?

[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.520]
No, seriously. What is V?

[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.740]
V for visitors and alien invasion.

[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.160]
See, I see the gratuitous filth that comes out of this man's pus.

[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.260]
You know, just said vagina.

[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:23.340]
I just so it could say vagina, penis, vagina, valuelina, vagina.

[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.960]
What is that?

[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.560]
Labia?

[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.260]
Bracum.

[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:28.600]
Stuff like that.

[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.240]
Flask Gordon 7, minority report 7.

[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.520]
Island of Dr. Monroe 7.

[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:35.700]
Dr. Monroe?

[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.840]
That's what the caller said and we just played along the whole thing.

[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:39.500]
Oh, Dr. Monroe.

[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:40.780]
Six.

[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.560]
Rocketeer 4 and the Cat people too.

[00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.740]
That's a good pull question and really schmitty answers, man.

[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.900]
That's really embarrassing.

[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.140]
And probably again because there's nobody in town.

[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:55.000]
Anybody who's got more than 50 cents or got a brain is already out of that swamp.

[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.220]
I understand through the graphine it's raining cats and dogs there every day.

[00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:58.740]
It's really nasty.

[00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:59.120]
Yes.

[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.600]
Sonny here, but we have a smog alert.

[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:05.400]
It's going to be in the 32, 33, which is like, I don't know, about 90.

[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:08.540]
Maybe 90 or maybe a little more than 90.

[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.700]
And so we're really conserving.

[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:11.300]
We're cutting back.

[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.140]
This is D day.

[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:17.820]
This is the last day that we have to like really be on our best and keep the lights out and talk real low and, you know, stuff like that.

[00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.560]
So that we have no brownouts and blood.

[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:26.680]
See the power demanded 9 a.m. 17,350 megawatts up from 16, 690 on Wednesday at the same time.

[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:28.480]
But we got 21,000 for it to available.

[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.080]
This is the new hobby we all have in Toronto.

[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.160]
No, certainly we count the megawatts.

[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.480]
What?

[00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:32.960]
Watching.

[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:33.300]
Yeah.

[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.840]
Also, who's saying cousin chemical Ali has been caught in Iraq.

[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.160]
Now how many times he's been caught?

[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.160]
About 30, man.

[00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:44.840]
I mean, they told the, yeah, they first they killed him and then they caught him and then another caught him again.

[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:55.600]
Ali has son, Al Majid, a feared cousin of Saddam Hussein, nicknamed chemical Ali for his use of poison gas in a tax has been captured by US forces in Iraq again.

[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.500]
See it and said that I can't stand a freaking lies man.

[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.800]
Lie or lie or your thing is on fire.

[00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:06.120]
So maybe we'll actually get a definitive a tie breaking call on the Phil Henry situation.

[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:11.120]
We got the first guy and, and you know, I, I don't choose to believe either one of me.

[00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:11.500]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:13.020]
In other words, the one because I don't listen.

[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:19.500]
Even if I were there, I wouldn't listen because if number one, I don't listen to the radio other than when I'm at work and number or in the car and number two.

[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.060]
I don't listen to Phil anymore.

[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.120]
Are you sure I have a listen to him in years ages.

[00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.500]
So what, what, what, what I know.

[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.160]
So don't give me this crap about why you wanted to believe that first guy.

[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.140]
You know, somebody's going to say that I don't know.

[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:38.060]
We had two complete, they listened to the same show and they've got two completely different versions of the same damn show.

[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.060]
Here's for a lot of deal.

[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.300]
Hello.

[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:45.780]
I.O.D. was off the air for, for transmitter maintenance last night.

[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:46.160]
Yeah.

[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.000]
They made an announcement about six fucking evening that they would be off the air.

[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:51.380]
But they said something interesting.

[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:57.180]
They said that the screen, the wedge screen would be up if you wanted to listen to the regular programming on the web only.

[00:33:57.580 --> 00:33:59.840]
Well, how long did they, how long did they stand off for?

[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.140]
I believe like maybe from 10 to 6.

[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.240]
I'm not sure the exact hours, but they definitely said they were going to be off the air.

[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.240]
And they specifically fit transmitter maintenance.

[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.260]
Yeah, but it isn't full on like from seven to 10.

[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.680]
Right. So I mean, I mean, the maintenance was after 10.

[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.260]
In other words, overnight maintenance.

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.120]
I see.

[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.420]
So in other words, he was on it.

[00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:16.140]
Definitely.

[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:16.900]
Okay.

[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:18.520]
Thanks, pal.

[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.020]
Thanks.

[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:20.320]
Are you sure?

[00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:24.760]
No, he got, he got panicky because he wanted to run back to the radio.

[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.620]
And here's for us.

[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:27.620]
No, don't be knocking at guy.

[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.440]
He was a good guy.

[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:28.760]
He was a good guy.

[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.160]
He was a good person.

[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:30.700]
Gee, you are.

[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.900]
You really are a prick, man.

[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:32.840]
Yeah, it's bad.

[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.260]
I'm the one who gets all the bad.

[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.480]
Oh, that near Rogers, man.

[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.280]
He's a real bastard.

[00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:40.160]
You can put a tape into your boom box and record the whole thing.

[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.180]
What does that mean for the people that want to hear their own voice?

[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.060]
No, but they want to hear it like now.

[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:45.860]
No, I see.

[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:46.780]
They want to hear it live.

[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.200]
They want to hear it like right after the lay.

[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:50.400]
It's exciting for these people.

[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.720]
You know, what else are they going to do down here on August 21st, huh?

[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:55.980]
Besides blow their brains out.

[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:56.220]
Right.

[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:58.520]
Look, what is it?

[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.180]
No one already?

[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.540]
We got boy, this is exciting.

[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:02.420]
A lot of pressure on certain people in that building.

[00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.300]
And none of it on me.

[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:04.280]
That's, that's very good.

[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:04.840]
I like that.

[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.580]
No, I see.

[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:07.320]
I got a story no matter what it comes out.

[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:11.000]
Because if it comes out good in midday, I can say, see, I was on every Tuesday and Thursday

[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:11.820]
in July and August.

[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:12.740]
I made them all this year.

[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.200]
I wasn't sick for my, uh, for my disease department in Amsterdam because I'm not there.

[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.320]
What, that was brutal last year.

[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.840]
You remember all the, I'm sure you did.

[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.740]
Yeah, they were hacking and got the, uh, date.

[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:27.060]
I would go into coughing spells from that dank basement there from the mold and the mild

[00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:28.160]
you and all that other crap.

[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.080]
Uh, I mean, I thought it was going to die.

[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:33.100]
And then you see what that did?

[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:34.860]
It was a trigger that bad science infection.

[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.400]
So when I would come back there and I accused it of being like an unsafe workplace, which

[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.020]
it is, but I would do the same hacking and coughing because I had the allergies and everything

[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:42.520]
in my system.

[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.440]
And thanks to my good friend, Dr. Amp.

[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.940]
Thank God for her.

[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.860]
Thanks to your close friend, Rimmer for her.

[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.180]
See, he's not all bad, just mostly, but not all bad.

[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:53.000]
Do you think she counter-balances, Mitch, her?

[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:53.360]
No.

[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.940]
Oh, maybe about like a few hundred thousand off.

[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:04.620]
1041 at 560 WQM announcing a 2003 Neil Deal blowout sale that's going on right now as I speak

[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:08.840]

Hurry in now because inventory is limited.

[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.960]
And Halif, you can still test drive any vehicle on the lot for 24 hours.

[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.480]
I'm sure glad somebody we know didn't test drive one of their cars.

[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.700]
I don't want to mention, I mentioned no names.

[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:03.580]
You can take it home, take it to work, take it to, well, I'm not going to say what I was just going to say.

Halif's also got a great selection of certified pre-owned car trucks as you veeze dependable ones as always.

[00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:13.100]
And as I always tell you, if you're one of those ex-radio people, maybe like a radio sales hole,

[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:17.160]
or you knew somebody in a radio business in your credit's cut, all kinds of blemishes on it,

[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.180]

At the Canada you do bastard.

[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:05.380]
Here we come and don't fit there, but who upon the same patisee.

[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.100]
A great dip for the heyy-wishhal across the USA.

[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.260]
What big order would this just say here?

[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:11.640]
Describe and valley who?

[00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.880]
Let the bunch of queers again this year, who say that Irish food?

[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.240]
Oh God, loves the ae-wish, and lest it cost your gay.

[00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:21.400]
If you are, you won't be marching upon same patisee.

[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:27.200]
You can be your bum, a bucket of stums, sure, and that's okay, but you can't be a Irish-ish-y gay.

[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.800]
Now the order of hypernians, both eminence is great.

[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.240]
Have delimit this pronouncement upon the blessed day.

[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:43.160]
Sure a little bit have haven't fallen nestled in the sea.

[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:47.520]
But you're gone straight to help a homosexuality.

[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:50.760]
Oh, come, loves the ae-wish, as long as men are men.

[00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:51.240]
Are you?

[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.960]
It's a perhaps for leprechauns, we've never been sure of them.

[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.040]
You can be stinking drunk and hurling, and chunks will laugh it all away.

[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.740]
But you can't be a Irish-ish-y gay.

[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.320]
No!

[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.380]
Don't even try a b-n-a-wish-y gay.

[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.000]
1048-560 WQM.

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:12.360]
God loves the Irish, and of course there are a lot of people who do, I guess.

[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.780]
Anyway, here's the thing you just said, not for air.

[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.360]
No, I will ask you that information that you requested.

[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.000]
And also, with the bottom, it says 4,239 bucks for the best of meals so far.

[00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:26.300]
That's okay, it's slow start.

[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:27.320]
It's slow start.

[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.300]
We usually start when people are in town, and it's not for air.

[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.380]
I was just going to say that.

[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.800]
See, the best part of it is we usually do this like October through December.

[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.080]
But this year we got like a head start.

[00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.820]
We got like an early start, which is good.

[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.300]
Because even though there's nobody in town, we got 4,200 bucks already.

[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.760]
The best of meal, 2,000 and 2,2003 CDs are available on our website, meal-riders.com.

[00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:47.740]
Also, the Mohawar David and Keychains.

[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:48.260]
Absolutely.

[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:50.560]
And some other crap.

[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.300]
T-shirts, cuffs, mugs, co-says.

[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.340]
Whatever you do, whatever you can pet a little bit.

[00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:57.560]

[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.060]
And the best part of it is all the profits go to a really great charity.

[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.680]
Abandoned pet rescue being the animal lovers that we are.

[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:10.100]
And, you know, there are probably some people in the organization who also went to pussy cats.

[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.140]
Things like that.

[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:12.260]
Not for this kid.

[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.680]
But, you know, they do a great job of abandoning pet rescue.

[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.300]
You can read all the bottom on our website when you click onto that thing.

[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:19.520]
Just click it on and get it, god damn it.

[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.920]
We want to raise 100 grand this year.

[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:21.260]
Yeah.

[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:25.680]
Well, seriously, last year was, uh, well, we didn't even do it last year.

[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.640]
So, we got to make up for last year or two last year.

[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:28.660]
Everybody was busy being lazy.

[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:31.560]
Well, they don't want to do it too much work.

[00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:32.020]
Yeah.

[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.920]
That was that damn McGill, you know what?

[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:34.320]
That's right.

[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:38.220]
He's out of town. He's on his honeymoon.

[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.000]
Is that it? Yeah.

[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.020]
Where did they go, like, to a Guadalajara?

[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:42.200]
I don't know.

[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:45.560]
Or maybe, maybe it wasn't Guadalajara.

[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.020]
Maybe it sounds like Guadalajara.

[00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:47.660]
Guadalajara.

[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.200]
Maybe that's where they went, you think?

[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.360]
Is that a grita que va caminando?

[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.780]
Oh, she never looked better than me.

[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.660]
She does now is morphing mo.

[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:01.820]
Morphing mo and say, you cruise, I'm telling you right now, go on our website and take a puke at that.

[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.580]
Plus that picture, is that good a great job?

[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.820]
Well, I picture him with a T-shirt.

[00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:07.540]
Was that on his way out to the car?

[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.160]
Yeah, he says that he was way out to the T-shirt.

[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:10.120]
And his way out to the T-shirt.

[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.280]
The blurriness is because he was shaky because he's off the dope.

[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.160]
I beg your pardon?

[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.880]
He's off of the drugs and he's shaky now.

[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.040]
He's off of what drugs?

[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:20.400]
Of course it is.

[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.740]
Who knows what the hell he was on?

[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:22.820]
Zach?

[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.140]
Obviously not cocaine.

[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:28.260]
Well, what are you talking about?

[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.500]
He's off the drugs.

[00:41:29.600 --> 00:41:30.320]
That's what he said.

[00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.420]
I don't know what he's on.

[00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:34.120]
By the way, I have very good news today.

[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.460]
It's my fourth sugar free day consecutive.

[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:39.240]
I had headaches for a couple of days.

[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.360]
It always happens when you do atkins or when atkins like thing.

[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.940]
We should take a moment to applaud you.

[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.160]
Oh, seriously, I'm down to just hair over 190.

[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:52.320]
And when I come back to town next week, I'll be under 190 for the first time in a long time.

[00:41:52.820 --> 00:41:55.420]
For a while, then you'll be pork up because you'll be sitting at home doing nothing.

[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.020]
No, I will not be porking up.

[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.840]
I will not be porking up at all.

[00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.560]
I'll be on the treadmill.

[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.800]
This is it.

[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:01.780]
Last chance.

[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:05.620]
Here's our poll question for today.

[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:06.940]
I know we get around it with sooner or later.

[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.320]
We're just killing time to 11.

[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.360]
What is it?

[00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.240]
About 30 men.

[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.620]
When a train comes out for June, May, June and Julio.

[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.580]
That is going to be pressure packed.

[00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:19.760]
Now, what was for well?

[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.820]
He's trying to deflect the, well, the afternoons did find in a book.

[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:23.420]
They did okay.

[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:28.620]
Mad Dog helped tank a lot with a three to four hour hopper had a big five to six hour.

[00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:29.880]
Right?

[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.380]
I see hoppers on vacation again this week.

[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.120]
He's got a better scan than I do, I think.

[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.180]
He never works.

[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:37.480]
How many days a year does Hank Goldberg work?

[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.420]
About 30 men.

[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:42.900]
Because we got today, we got the, oh, the big, oh!

[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:43.980]
From four to seven.

[00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.500]
And they complained about you?

[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.620]
About you filling in when I'm not there?

[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:48.860]
Yeah.

[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:50.980]
I mean, it's not personal.

[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.340]
I like Orlando Alzaquiri.

[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.840]
He's a good, uh, spick, never stole a freight train.

[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.240]
But man, he is so bad on the air.

[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.180]
You're forgetting something.

[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:00.900]
What's that? He talks about sports.

[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:02.000]
Oh, that's right.

[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.620]
The big four to seven.

[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.100]
Mad Dog will be back today.

[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.480]
It says here now. It's mad dog definitely back or not.

[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.480]
As far as we know.

[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:09.840]
As far as we know, no, no.

[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.300]
Two to four of the signs point to Ann Arbor, old number 88.

[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.740]
I'm going backwards on here.

[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.940]
Perk who in hotline at seven o'clock tonight from Tony Romas and the Gables.

[00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.040]
830.

[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:23.800]
Probably, yeah, I haven't been to Tony Romas in a long time.

[00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.460]
Which is better?

[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.200]
Tony Romas or Bobby Rubino's?

[00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.200]
I used to prefer Bobby Rubino's.

[00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:31.400]
I haven't been to either one.

[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:33.320]
See, and now you're starting to talk about food again.

[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:33.940]
Would you stop?

[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:35.640]
They're both, uh, weak.

[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:37.980]
Although ribs are okay like on the atkins.

[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:40.080]
I was, you know, I was thinking about Dr. Bala.

[00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.220]
I don't think I did him justice.

[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.280]
I feel bad about that.

[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.180]
I don't feel bad about too many things that said are done.

[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.560]
But I feel bad about that.

[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.080]
Why?

[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.420]
I mean, he didn't know.

[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.880]
He wasn't a very personable guy to say the best.

[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:51.880]
Okay, you know what I'm saying?

[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.640]
But, but, well, don't, I don't compare him with Mo.

[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.100]
He did a lot of good for a lot of people, uh, Dr. Bob.

[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.720]
There are a lot of people. He saved their lives.

[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:04.400]
And he took all of that crap for over 30 years.

[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.780]
He did all of that crap from the establishment.

[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.100]
About 30, man.

[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:10.840]
Actually, when did the first atkins start with the 70s?

[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.680]
70 to the 70s.

[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.060]
I think 72 or three.

[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.080]
So about 30 years, he took all of that crap.

[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.120]
And now that he's dead, he had that bad slip and fall air in New York.

[00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:19.280]
I went in a coma and died.

[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:20.260]
I mean, ice.

[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.040]
But now he's dead.

[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.900]
Oh, you know what? He wasn't so bad after all.

[00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.460]
And every, every week, I still see somebody saying,

[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.720]
oh, uh, new reports is the atkins is bad for it.

[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:30.380]
Bull crap.

[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.500]
Bull crap. I mean, if you do it for too long and too extreme,

[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:36.780]
and you're in ketosis for like,

[00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:39.400]
everyone you start getting like, I'll add uric acid build up and gout,

[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.000]
and your toes is as big as Vermont.

[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.400]
Yeah, then it's a problem.

[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.480]
But he did a lot of good for a lot of people.

[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.380]
So I feel bad that we didn't like to do a, I mean,

[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.620]
look at the assholes that the urologers like Bob Hope.

[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.840]
Okay, screw Bob Hope.

[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.120]
Who the hell needs him?

[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:54.220]
You know, you're right. Let's have a three hour moment of silence.

[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:58.300]
Or at least a 37 minutes to 1130.

[00:44:59.100 --> 00:44:59.720]
Anyway, let's see.

[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.000]
We got Marlins on Decade.

[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:02.540]
30 Marlins would like to get out of Denver.

[00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:04.420]
I'll tell you that they got Wamp, two nights in a row.

[00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.000]
They're going to try to break that streak tonight at the Iraqis.

[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:09.640]
905. And Joe and Mark overnight, midnight to 5,

[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.540]
and then we have, well, Eddie Kay is on vacation.

[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.540]
Did I hear for else at Eddie Kay, or was it the guilty?

[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.460]
The, the Eddie Kay is in Rome and he went to the dog track.

[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:23.680]
Somebody ought to tell Eddie Kay that they have a harness racing in Rome

[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.780]
and all over Italy too.

[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:27.300]
He can go bet on Enrico Belai.

[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.500]
And who's the driver of Veren of that great,

[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.200]
the Trader Veren? Who, what's that guy's name?

[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:33.580]
A lot of them.

[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:34.680]
Come on, come on.

[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.120]
America of a Sputia, isn't that his name?

[00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:40.500]
Well, his name is Gino, it'll come to me because you know me

[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:41.520]
and those obscure names.

[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.760]
Enrico Belai, do you think there's anybody in the United States

[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.900]
anywhere at several listen to this show who knows who Enrico Belai is?

[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.360]
No. He's a great driver.

[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.040]
I mean, he ain't no Donald Brainerd, but okay, here's the poll question.

[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.960]
Which of these American political or entertainment figures do you admire the most?

[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:59.340]
I'm trying to think, oh, and you know what inspired me for this?

[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:00.060]
It's pretty obvious.

[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:03.980]
Yeah, that's the first name on the list watching that movie.

[00:46:03.980 --> 00:46:05.560]
It's pretty obvious to any morning, bowling for Columbi.

[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.000]
Michael Moore.

[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.240]
I think Michael Moore should be the president.

[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:13.120]
And you know what? Again, I don't want to get the off track here,

[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:14.560]
but it's heartbreaking.

[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:18.760]
And this is the case, whether it was Lenny Bruce or anybody,

[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.800]
somebody comes along and challenges the establishment,

[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:25.800]
has the balls to say things that are just politically incorrect,

[00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:28.340]
that really, really tell it like it is,

[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.140]
and right away they have to like it, disson.

[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:32.940]
You don't have to like tear them down and try to discredit them.

[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.020]
Just like that crap at the Oscars, when he won for the best documentary,

[00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:36.920]
bowling for Columbi.

[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:37.380]
Right.

[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:40.260]
And he stood up there and had the balls to tell it exactly the way it was.

[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:41.980]
Ah, boom! There we go.

[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.680]
Half of the crowd is booing and air.

[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:47.720]
You know, and then all the crap that we got in the media,

[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:50.920]
then the establishment, the suck up establishment, media,

[00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.780]
and then no balls media in the USA.

[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.520]
God, it's embarrassing.

[00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.080]
And you know, one of the points that they made in the movie bowling for Columbi

[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.500]
is that they are trying to find about the difference between like the crime stats

[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:03.560]
in Canada and how much more civilized the people are here,

[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.500]
and all the murders in the US, as they showed where the difference

[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.200]
and where the news comes from.

[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.440]
What people are fed daily, the Canadians are wild,

[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.480]
they show the CBC, and how civilized and how intelligent

[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.480]
and how like objective they are presenting the news,

[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.860]
as opposed to the if it bleeds it leads a hysterical bull crap.

[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:23.940]
And they showed all these news teams from the different channels showing up,

[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.100]
you know, at the scene of a shooting or a murder or whatever,

[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.400]
because that's American F and away.

[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:32.480]
But if for no other reason, just in the sea, Dick Clark and Sheryl and Heston,

[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.220]
who really even embarrassed you much what's bowling for Columbi,

[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:38.140]
and it's a must see, not just the best documentary,

[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.740]
the best film I would say of all time.

[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.320]
You'll agree, okay?

[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:44.260]
Two hours, it's 159.

[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:46.900]
Michael Moore, that's my offer.

[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.020]
Which of these American political entertainment figures do you admire the most?

[00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.440]
Michael Moore, George W. Bush, we had to put him on air,

[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.660]
it's kind of the gag of the day.

[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:55.100]
I gag when I hear his name.

[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:59.580]
Arnold Schwarzenegger, a man who really stands for nothing,

[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.120]
and Ralph Nader, that was George's choice.

[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.580]
I made a short list of the people.

[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.280]
I'm not going to vote for Ralph Nader, I just thought he should.

[00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:07.600]
No, we're voting for Michael Moore, I'll think of that right now.

[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.400]
Yeah, why not? He's phenomenal.

[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.260]
Because he's a fat guy, so I like him.

[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.780]
And he's from Michigan, so what's not to like?

[00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:15.380]
10-50.

[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.680]
And they showed some interesting stuff here in Toronto,

[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:21.080]
too, he did actually go around to some homes and open the door,

[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:22.860]
and apologized to each other.

[00:48:22.860 --> 00:48:25.220]
He said, I just want to see if there are a lot of people that don't lock their door

[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.460]
and sure enough every door that he tried, they were unlocked.

[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.720]
How do you like that?

[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:30.460]
They?

[00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:30.920]
Yep.

[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.540]
10-56 at 5-60, WQM were only a little more than a half hour away

[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.180]
from those gigantic Arbat trends, the big rating.

[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.520]
This is the one where a faralka goes through the roof.

[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.080]
And who, and George could have like a big...

[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.320]
...some underpaid, overworked, underappreciated?

[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:47.840]
Yes.

[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.040]

[00:50:58.840 --> 00:50:59.880]
you want to strangle her.

[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:01.780]
Fontificating who she's hating.

[00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:06.000]
Political pundit, pontificating, Trump on the plot and masturbating.

[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.100]
A Republican's Yankee home.

[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.140]
She's a federalist, and mo.

[00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:10.600]
Are you?

[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:12.640]
Laking liberal is dirty word, you know?

[00:51:12.640 --> 00:51:15.700]
In a mini-starcho and camel toe.

[00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.660]
Antelope to nose, one gate can be.

[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.720]
In a mini skirt that spells fishy.

[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.180]
She's a tall drink of water on the side of a large order

[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.180]
with a back alley hook.

[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.300]
If you like your broads collar, if you got the money,

[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.360]
she'll spread those legs with a cigarette and a shark's name.

[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.800]
Antelope to her, and cull their political pundits.

[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.700]
The angel of the right, energy's elated.

[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:36.020]
1103 at 560 WQM.

[00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:38.560]
Here's a lady of all people in the plantation.

[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.060]
Hello?

[00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:41.900]
Lady in plantation?

[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:42.700]
Hello.

[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.020]
Yes, ma'am.

[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:44.880]
Hi, Neil. How are you doing?

[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:45.780]
Good. How are you?

[00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.440]
Great. I didn't even deliver this.

[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.940]
And then what the hope for how the homeless animals.

[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:52.580]
And you know about the Florida plates for pods.

[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.300]
They're trying to rate 89,000.

[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.060]
And 1500 email addresses to make those plates.

[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:06.900]
Which I think is cool to help stop the overpopulation in Florida.

[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:10.000]
I'm not familiar with it. What is it called a place for what?

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.920]
It's called the Florida plates for pods.

[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:18.380]
They're trying to make plates to help stop the overpopulation of animals

[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:19.160]
and the utilization.

[00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.900]
And just help keep the population down.

[00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:26.260]
Because these poor animals are born to die.

[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.760]
So how do you get one of those plates?

[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.840]
What you got to do is what they're trying to do is raise funds.

[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.220]
And there's 1500 email addresses that they need.

[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:42.060]
And $89,000. And if they raise all this, I think it's just December.

[00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:43.540]
There's like 101 days to go.

[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.980]
I don't understand what that means. There's 1500 email addresses they need.

[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.280]
I want to survey. And you go on the website.

[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:50.200]
Oh, okay.

[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:51.880]
And you go and take the survey.

[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:53.100]
Well, what's the website?

[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:59.060]
It's www.sortaplatesforpods.com.

[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:00.800]
Platesforpods.ca.

[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.120]
And you know how you have a nice and plate towards the Florida.

[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:06.800]
What will happen if there's enough money to raise?

[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:08.560]
They'll make these plates.

[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.140]
Yeah, they need to raise the money to make the plates.

[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.500]
And people can buy the plates.

[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.800]
And support the spade and neutering organizations.

[00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:22.840]
And then we can keep the population down.

[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:27.840]
And these poor animals won't have to be multiplying and dying.

[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:28.720]
And yes, right.

[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.060]
Okay. I'm going to check out the website myself.

[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.420]
And I'm sure other people will too.

[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.200]
There's a lot of good organizations out there that rescue these pets.

[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.940]
And after the plates are made, then everything is left over.

[00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:44.820]
We'll go to these organizations to help them.

[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.180]
Great. Okay. Thanks, Elizabeth.

[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:46.860]
Appreciate it.

[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.220]
Well, thank you, Helen. You have a good day.

[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:48.740]
You too.

[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.000]
www.flortaplatesforpods.ca.com. That's cute.

[00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:58.260]
And I can also bring in Bob Barker, right? Have you a pet spade neutered?

[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.160]
In fact, I think most of the people that have the unwanted dollars animals procreating,

[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.180]
they ought to be spade neutered too.

[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:05.560]
Sure.

[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.840]
Now, here's this hostile facts from Bill and Davy.

[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.720]
Well, Bill, you're just out of control.

[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.940]
But he's got a point in joy.

[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.100]
And you were wrong because George did fax it to me immediately.

[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.500]
It says, Neil, George will probably not forward this to you, but I will vent anyway.

[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.400]
Why is it necessary to have George to have to hear George speak when you're on the air?

[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.800]
Maybe we could get like a filter, you know?

[00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.720]
I'll just turn the mic off.

[00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.080]
No, but no, it's just that we could get a filter for those people who want to filter your voice out.

[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:34.980]
Oh, I see.

[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.420]
And we could know we could raise money for the event of Paris.

[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.780]
We would do it on our best and Neil thing.

[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:44.860]
Anyways, as I thought this was the Neil Rogers show, not the George Rodriguez show featuring Neil Rogers.

[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:49.960]
It's bad enough they have to tune out when he's under in the summer, but I don't want to hear him when I tune back in on Tuesday and Thursday.

[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:54.200]
Tell George to get off your co-tails. Get off my co-tails, bad demit, you little speck.

[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:54.580]
Okay.

[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:59.000]
Remember what happened to the bird when he learned not to shut up?

[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:02.740]
That isn't the bird. That's not why the bird got canned.

[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.560]
The bird got canned because he just was out of control every no matter what I talked about.

[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.740]
It wasn't up his alley, it wasn't up to his standards.

[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:17.220]
And he would start like, you know, signing and going to a little temper tantrum and put his head down on the table and start like a little child, you know?

[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:19.180]
Don't bother the studio. Stop out of there.

[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:23.360]
Especially, and that was back in the days when I was a big hairy carry and cubs fan and that stuff.

[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.360]
And he just had a nervous breakdown about that.

[00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:27.160]
Well, screw you, birdie, on that's right, he's dead.

[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:31.720]
Take this pool, he says, his bill and baby, who's hates you like poison.

[00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:31.920]
Yeah.

[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:37.640]
And then, you know, something I want to say to this, this is not a bad pool to take, not that today, but someday.

[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:40.040]
Right? Sure. Let me vote.

[00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.980]
And of course, we'll add a lot more names to this pool, but I don't need any more names.

[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:46.120]
I'm voting for Michael Moore. He's my favorite person.

[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.780]
My favorite political personality.

[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:53.580]
I admire his fat ass. Well, not his ass.

[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.340]
It says, take this pool. How many current neo-Rodgers listeners will tune out if George ever takes over your show?

[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:00.320]
I'll be the first to vote, says bill.

[00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.560]
But it's interesting, though.

[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:09.040]
It says it's bad enough that I, oh, I see, that I have to tune out when he's under in the summer. I see.

[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.460]
I thought maybe I caught him there like a little duplicitous thing, but I did not.

[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:15.580]
At least he's consistent. He does hate you like poison, but he's consistent.

[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:18.220]
Did you get my facts with that stuff by the way? Yes, he hasn't. Good.

[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:24.940]
Be sure and tell the appropriate party that that's wonderful. Give him a big kiss on the cheeks on his rosy cheeks.

[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.500]
Look at that. Michael Moore's got five of the first seven votes.

[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:33.160]
Of course, two more hours. He's got six of the first eight votes, like I said.

[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:37.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Let's add some names to this list so we can really make it in prison.

[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:42.700]
There must be somebody you admire, which of these American political entertainers you admire the most.

[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.840]
Should we put Jeanine Grafilo on her? No, what?

[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.740]
No, why is that so? Why did you give me that like Mr. Ed's sound effect there?

[00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:53.800]
I think Bill and David may have a point.

[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:55.920]
Is that that ridiculous? Yes.

[00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:59.740]
How about what's his name? Oh, yeah, like that.

[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:03.700]
What's his name from the West Wing East Wing? Martin Sheen.

[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.800]
Sheen from the Sheenie Alps.

[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:07.540]
Martin Sheen would be good.

[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:10.460]
What's the name Tim Robbins?

[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.200]
Tim Robbins would be excellent. You ever saw that movie? I did.

[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:14.760]
Which one?

[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.440]
The one that I told you that I saw. The candidate, the not the candidate, but the...

[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:20.260]
Whatever it was called.

[00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:20.700]

[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:28.100]
That was a damn good movie where he got elected based on a totally bogus.

[00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.460]
And then he got the sympathy vote with the phony shooting and all that.

[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.380]
It was great. What's the name of that?

[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:35.660]
I'll go in the other room and look during the break.

[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.660]
It's sitting there and I'm not bringing it home.

[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:41.260]
I don't want to have a whole sack full of tapes.

[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:45.600]
I will bring bowling for Columbine. I have it sitting on top of my little sack in there just so I don't forget.

[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.400]
We got Michael Moore, George W. Bush.

[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.620]
Does Bush have any votes yet in our poll? He's got two. He's got a period.

[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:55.180]
Out of 21, he's got two. Michael Moore's got 15, 8 or 3.

[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.740]
Bush to Ardell Swarthnegg has got one. He's got a big one.

[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.480]
So that's all of so far.

[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:03.300]
A native Martin Sheen in Tim Robbins.

[00:58:03.860 --> 00:58:08.820]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line. North Miami Beach. Hello.

[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:09.480]
Anya.

[00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:10.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.360]
You mentioned Tony Rome is ribbed the other day.

[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:12.940]
Yeah.

[00:58:13.220 --> 00:58:15.020]
I go every Monday for the O.E. can eat ribs.

[00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:17.060]
I missed that.

[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:20.420]
Yeah, it's good. Yeah. I'm also the guy that ate nine dozen oysters.

[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:21.180]
Remember, I told you?

[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:21.840]
Yeah.

[00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.720]
Anyways, I'm a about for real.

[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:27.100]
Yeah. Did you know he was a he's on page seven of City Link?

[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:28.600]
Again.

[00:58:28.940 --> 00:58:31.580]
Yeah, he's you want me to love him over there. They're obsessed.

[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.540]
Yeah, you want me to read the little snippet they got about it?

[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.080]
Sure. Go ahead.

[00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:36.140]
Okay, Scott for real. It says his resume.

[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:39.580]
Sports radio.

[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:45.720]
Sports radio host at WQAM always wants to do the hottest girl in the room.

[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:46.820]
He lives in Boka.

[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:51.220]
He lives in Boka Rattenkinda with 80-year-old neighbors and lives on popsicles and blunts.

[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:52.940]
Oh, I love it.

[00:58:53.260 --> 00:58:54.000]
Nice rack.

[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.420]
You guys got to see the picture over there.

[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:00.760]
What is this under?

[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.720]
This is a listing of different people, personalities.

[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.300]
It's got a bunch of different people.

[00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:06.700]
It's got Steve O from Jackass.

[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.020]
It's got Rosie O'Donnell.

[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.820]
It's got Don King, Jimmy Buffett, Lenny Kravitz.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:12.000]
I have no idea what they're doing.

[00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:15.020]
They put Ferrell on there with Roseanne?

[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.680]
Yeah, no, Rosie O'Donnell.

[00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:17.980]
Oh, they're even worse.

[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.120]
I'd sue their ass Scott.

[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.100]
Tell everybody about it.

[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.500]
You got to see the picture of him, though.

[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.060]
It's classic.

[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.820]
Okay, I'll check it out.

[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:24.860]
Check it out.

[00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:25.600]
Okay.

[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.400]
I've built in this list of them in the hour.

[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.960]
But that's okay, because let them tell you we got those trends to fall back on.

[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.180]
Then we got that big gigantic oozing 1-2 hour.

[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:36.140]
It's a piece of cake today, the way I look at it, from where I'm sitting.

[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.160]
Here's the Oakland Park.

[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:39.520]
Hello.

[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:41.360]
Hey, congratulations on your diet.

[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:42.380]
Thanks.

[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:43.740]
I mean, it's four days is not.

[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.380]
But, you know, at least I'm trying.

[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:49.020]
What's your theory on the Georgia's concert hate now, lately?

[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:50.360]
What do you mean?

[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.680]
I mean, just spewing out here constantly.

[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:54.920]
Is it Reverend Jones?

[00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:55.460]

[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:59.200]
Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, we're not getting any names for our list.

[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:02.100]
And of course, I knew it wouldn't be easy, because there aren't a lot of people we admire.

[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:05.640]
Most of them are a bunch of fakers and ripoff artists, etc.

[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:10.120]
They're going to be somebody, somebody out there somewhere, like maybe Santa Claus,

[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:16.800]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, the pound, 5, 6, the only AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.900]
I thought this would be, like I said, not that easy, but generally a little piece of cake, a little sliver.

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:22.100]
Cake?

[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.320]
Here's Miami.

[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:24.640]
Hello.

[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:25.500]
Hello.

[01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:26.380]
Yes, sir.

[01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:29.700]
Yes, I've been in here two days.

[01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:30.480]
I lived here.

[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:31.680]
I listened to your show.

[01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:32.440]
Yes?

[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.100]
I'll tell you.

[01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:37.940]
There have been a third that I've fallen out of my butt into the toilet that are more tactful than you.

[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.280]
You're on top of that.

[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.440]
I'm delighted that you're continuing to listen, though.

[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.120]
Thank you very much, you Jack, as you've phoned.

[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.800]
And that was a phony, you're called with a phony accent.

[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.740]
That's all we got left, because there's nobody with a life who's in town.

[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.320]
Now, like I said, this ain't going to be easy, but we only got 18 minutes to those numbers.

[01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:50.900]
They're coming out.

[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:51.520]
Excellent.

[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.600]
That was Greg Reed doing a voice.

[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:57.120]
12 minutes after 11 at 5, 60 WQM.

[01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.780]
Brand these shoes and pompato beaches go on bigger and stronger than ever.

[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.980]
25 years in business in the same great location, with the same fantastic deals.

[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.740]
In fact, the deals keep getting better all the time.

[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.260]
That's why people keep going back.

[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:11.560]
They got the top names in the shoe business, so they take good carrier tutsies.

[01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:16.100]
They got rock ports, echoes, mafisto, timbulin, clarks, SAS, floor shim, and lots more.

[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:18.460]
And no matter what size you're looking for, they got it.

[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.380]
Men's 6 to 15, women's 5 to 12, and wits from the very, very narrow to the very, very wide.

[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:29.080]
And don't forget their professional sales staff will take the time to make sure that you walk out of there with a perfect fit every time.

[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:38.020]
With over 40,000 pairs in stock and their 8,000 square foot megastore, you can bet Phil Henry's life on it that exactly what you're looking for is in stock right now for you to walk out in.

[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:38.520]
Are you sure?

[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:42.980]
Brand these shoes, you'll find them at 12, 19, or Federal Highway in pompato beach, open daily, 9 to 9,

[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:55.200]
Wavy Quiet leavy Quiet leavy Quiet leavy Quiet, the�y grow one

[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.420]
the tabre fly pattern

[01:02:57.420 --> 01:02:57.580]
the tabre fly pattern

[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:58.440]
Look at 18 to 5.

[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:58.980]
That's alright.

[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:02.480]
60 WDQ amp, we got the greatest drop in in history.

[01:03:08.420 --> 01:03:10.180]
What the hell more could you want than that, you know?

[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.900]
That's one of my favorite rights of all time.

[01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:19.220]
Did I say 11-18?

[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.040]
I think I just said that.

[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.520]
We can't say it too often because it means we're only 12 minutes away from those big

[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:23.960]
trends, coming up at 11-30?

[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:24.620]
Yeah.

[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.780]
Of course, I'm making a big deal out of it.

[01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:28.100]
It's only a trend that's number one.

[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:32.060]
And number two, you know, maybe we'll have a computer glitch or something there.

[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:32.520]
Right.

[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.340]
The parents are coming with a sad look on his pussy.

[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:36.780]
Well, gee, that could have be something like that.

[01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:40.140]
That's what they specialize in, a QM excuses.

[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:41.600]
Here's Miami.

[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:41.960]
Hello?

[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:43.480]
Hello?

[01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:44.280]
Yes, sir.

[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:44.940]
Yes.

[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:45.980]
Neil.

[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:47.020]
Speak to me.

[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.480]
These guys that they're catching this, like they're chemical all-eat, they got this morning.

[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:52.940]
Yeah.

[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.900]
What do you want to do with those guys?

[01:03:58.760 --> 01:03:59.980]
They're going to interrogate them.

[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.640]
They're going to tie them up and they're going to pull out their fingernails.

[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:04.360]
Stuff like that.

[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:08.900]
Yeah, I don't think we're going to get any more names for this list, you know?

[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.500]
I'm going to sound facts in you one.

[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:11.520]
We got one of the facts.

[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:12.860]
Thank God for that.

[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:18.000]
And what I think what this perhaps shows is that there's a dearth of people.

[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.560]
Now, when you see, that's why I didn't just say political.

[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.040]
I said, well, isn't he American political or entertainment figures?

[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.340]
You admire the most, okay?

[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:28.720]
Okay.

[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:29.740]
43 votes.

[01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:37.060]
Michael Moore 26, Ralph Nader 8, George W. Seven, and Arnold Schwarzenegger 2.

[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.060]
And I realized it's not a very impressive list.

[01:04:39.060 --> 01:04:41.200]
There's only four names on there so far.

[01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:45.740]
Oh, and we also added Martin Sheen and Tim Robbins, but we don't have those on there yet.

[01:04:47.260 --> 01:04:48.500]
Here's a call from Davey.

[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:48.720]
Hello?

[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:49.840]
Hello?

[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:50.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.880]
Hey, Neil, you know that guy that called about Pharrell?

[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:54.600]
Yeah.

[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.220]
That's a problem with South Florida.

[01:04:56.700 --> 01:05:00.620]
The article is about it's comparing us to California.

[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:07.000]
We had the local people in the entertainment industry running for government who put up

[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:07.580]
there to rise.

[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:08.040]
I see.

[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:08.340]
Yeah.

[01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:09.340]
That butthole.

[01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.960]
Another thing is George, he used to be all right.

[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.000]
But man, now he's so vindictive and he sounds like he's trying to be controversial on

[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.120]
it.

[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:19.480]
He's hateful.

[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.260]
Yeah, he's a hateful little aspect.

[01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.860]
And my last thing is don't be tired.

[01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.320]
OK, that's what you think, Pally.

[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:28.480]
Here's Ed from Florida.

[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.360]
How about Bill Marr for your poll?

[01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:31.560]
Oh, she is.

[01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:34.240]
I'll put it on there because you know, I'm asking the question.

[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:40.680]
Bill Marr, who's absolutely politically entertainmently incorrect.

[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.240]
He sucks.

[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:45.140]
But I'll put him on there just to make Ed and Florida Dale happy.

[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:45.780]
Thank you, Ed.

[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.300]
Hey, at least Ed offered a name.

[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:47.920]
Sure.

[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.160]
There must be somebody out there you admire.

[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.320]
And maybe this is one of the problems with America, eh?

[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:54.640]
Is that mean I have nobody to look up to?

[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.240]
The kids have no way.

[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.780]
How about the Kobe Bryant?

[01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:57.480]
Oh, sorry.

[01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.860]
Well, maybe a few weeks ago, maybe.

[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:01.000]
What do you mean maybe?

[01:06:01.280 --> 01:06:04.940]
You haven't heard the programming when this was going down on this station anyway.

[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.140]
Good.

[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:07.720]
That's why I'm in such a good mood because I don't hear the programming.

[01:06:07.940 --> 01:06:09.080]
I don't hear the sports nerds.

[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.020]
I don't hear that crap.

[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.620]
I hear a little bit in the morning when I get up and I drag my ass in here about 730.

[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.620]
And I hear a little bit of Mo and guilty.

[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:20.020]
And then of course I hear a little bit of ferala here, a little bit of crossover.

[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.440]
What's not to like, you know?

[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.000]
I think that the morning number is going to go way up in this trend.

[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.480]
I think ferala is going to like pop it.

[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:28.000]
And it's the trend.

[01:06:28.260 --> 01:06:28.900]
That's my prediction.

[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.040]
Here's homestead.

[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:30.280]
Hello.

[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:31.920]
Yeah.

[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:32.740]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:33.620]
How you doing, sir?

[01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:34.000]
Good.

[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.340]
I just watched that Boeing for calling by the other night and I just wanted to jump on the

[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.240]
Michael Moore bandwagon and saying that was a great flick.

[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:43.760]
And I just proved a lot of good points.

[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.300]
And I think it needs to be instituted into our educational system and using everyday

[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:54.200]
life to just prove a point that we are nation into decline.

[01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:56.560]
And it's not getting much better out there.

[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.000]
And with your point, I think you read into a dead ink.

[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.340]
Like you said, there is nobody to look up to anymore.

[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:05.360]
So good luck with you and have a great day.

[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:06.100]
Thanks, pal.

[01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.240]
Michael Moore from President, baby, that's what I said.

[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:09.360]
He's leading the way.

[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.600]
We're starting to get some votes on here.

[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.420]
They're a little bit slow today, but why the hell not?

[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:14.940]
57 votes.

[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.080]
Which of these American political entertainers do it my or most?

[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.160]
Michael Moore, 33.

[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:22.920]
George W. Bush, 12, Ralph, Nader, 10, R to the fourth, Nager, two.

[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.360]
We still don't have Tim Robbins-Martin, Sheener, Bill Maher, on her yet.

[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.780]
I don't want to push Eric, but I'm just mentioning that.

[01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:29.940]
Does anybody passing these along?

[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:33.600]
Do we want to build a, well, we only got eight minutes till those trends start coming

[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:33.720]
in?

[01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:38.180]
And I'm positive that once they start coming off that machine that clearance is going

[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:42.220]
to be in there faster than you can say the beast has got his butt open for him.

[01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:42.920]
Huh?

[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:43.940]
I'm not going to say that.

[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:46.260]
No, I'm not really sure which you're not.

[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.720]
And either is the beast.

[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:48.880]
The beast said he's cut him off.

[01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:49.680]
He said he's had enough.

[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.660]
He said clearance, don't even know.

[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.700]
He doesn't know what top from bottom, from inside, from outside.

[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.480]
And of course, it's kind of difficult when you have to strap that thing on.

[01:08:00.140 --> 01:08:01.480]
Here's Miami Gardens, hello.

[01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:02.620]
Good morning, Neil.

[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.260]
Yes, sir.

[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:07.860]
When was the, uh, saying that the ribs that Tony Romans or whatever is like saying the

[01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:13.560]
best thing is that I'll take out the best ribs in South Florida.

[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.900]
Well, I've never eaten this one again.

[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:15.480]
So I would worry.

[01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.920]
Maybe you can get some ribs there when they do that.

[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:18.400]
That sounds good.

[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:19.200]
I can do that on the edge.

[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:24.400]
They're really, they got some really, really good dolphin, good tuna and great ribs.

[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:25.380]
Very good reputation.

[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:26.360]
Excellent.

[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.180]
I like it.

[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:27.980]
Thanks, pal.

[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.620]
See everything but what the pull is about?

[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:31.160]
Which is fine.

[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:31.660]
That's good.

[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:32.260]
That's excellent.

[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.100]
That means that we actually have people a little bit of material.

[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:34.980]
Let's talk about ribs.

[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.220]
Let's go to a Holland and the field of ribs, which isn't difficult because it's all

[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:39.940]
they got by that.

[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.220]
What is that all about?

[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.520]
Of course, you've ever been there.

[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.220]
So you don't know what I'm talking about, but you've heard me mention it many, many times

[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:48.160]
that the men in Amsterdam are like, he's maciated.

[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.420]
Didn't you say the food was crappy?

[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.520]
It's got to be a food thing.

[01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:54.840]
It's got to be a nutritional thing.

[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:58.000]
Yeah, a lot of the young people, a lot of really beautiful faces.

[01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:02.520]
Nice looking young people, but you look at their bodies and it's like nothing but a bag

[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.060]
of ribs.

[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.660]
Maybe they were just at flanagans, I don't know.

[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.400]
In fact, they've probably got to start eating ribs instead of those goddamn fritas, those

[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.320]
of lobster fritas.

[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.560]
But what can you explain that to me?

[01:09:14.460 --> 01:09:17.500]
I don't want to get sidetracked here and get off on a food tangent, but I don't have

[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.040]
to work because it's not something I really like.

[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:23.280]
I've never, I'm not saying I've never eaten them because we've all eaten for French fries

[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:27.560]
because it's like, you know, it's just American-is-apple pie in diarrhea.

[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:28.080]
Right.

[01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.720]
But what's the big deal with them?

[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.060]
It's not like they have a lot of taste.

[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:33.580]
If they're right, they do.

[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.500]
They hit out of here.

[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:39.080]
First of all, they're salty as hell with raisin badminton.

[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:44.100]
They're deep fried and they're crap that's been frying for hours and days with lard.

[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.400]
Lard-ass.

[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:47.820]
And you wonder why people are looking like that.

[01:09:48.060 --> 01:09:51.320]
But you see, again, you would think there's no logic in that.

[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:55.900]
You would think that the dutch with all the crap that they eat like pea soup, which

[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.280]
is a high carb thing and fries.

[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.200]
You think that they'd be fat.

[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:04.120]
Now, they're not saying that they're on some fat-old, of course, anybody over 40 in

[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.420]
Holland is like a Nazi anyway.

[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.400]
You do know that.

[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.360]
I do know.

[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.640]
Yeah, when you get to be over 40 on your passport instead of dutch, it's his dutch.

[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.240]
They just put an extra E as in Nazi.

[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.820]
Now, they're not nice.

[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:21.460]
They're not nice.

[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:22.660]
They're older Dutch people.

[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.580]
They're just very, very nasty and rude.

[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:29.360]
But anyway, don't give me side-track French fries and then like the Italians, which you

[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:32.700]
see almost no fat Italians except, of course, outside of Italy.

[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.760]
But in Italy, I mean, once in a while, you'll see like a really poorly restaurant tour

[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:37.660]
in some trotteria.

[01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.320]
You know, I'm thinking of one in particular, who's a place that we've been going for years

[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:41.800]
in Rome.

[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.600]
But generally speaking, you don't see very many fat people.

[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.900]
They are healthy with that Mediterranean diet.

[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:48.820]
But what do they eat?

[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:49.540]
Tons of pasta.

[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:50.680]
Every kind of pasta invented.

[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:52.040]
Carbohydrate.

[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:55.380]
If you're diabetic like me and you love pasta, your frustrated, you can't eat pasta.

[01:10:55.380 --> 01:11:00.260]
It sends your blood sugar skyrocketing like crazy, terrifying.

[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.460]
So how can you explain that to me, Dr?

[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.220]
Nobody says lazy as we are.

[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:05.920]
That must be it.

[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:09.480]
Here's an excellent choice for our poor Maureen Dowd.

[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.540]
I love Maureen Dowd.

[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.060]
She's great.

[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.740]
I'm putting her on her and you know who else I'm putting on there?

[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:14.960]
Molly Ivans.

[01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:15.520]
All right.

[01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.540]
I'm going to think of those in tandem because I can't separate the two.

[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:20.960]
Although Maureen uses bigger words.

[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.180]
That's because she's in New York and she has to sound a little bit pseudo intellectual.

[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.100]
But I love Maureen Dowd and Molly Ivans.

[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:26.960]
We're putting them both on there.

[01:11:27.060 --> 01:11:27.580]
Two great journalists.

[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.420]
26 past 11.

[01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:33.560]
Now let's take another quick call or two because we want to get some names on it list.

[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.740]
Here's plantation.

[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:35.160]
Hello.

[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.080]
Feel good morning.

[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:37.580]
How are you?

[01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:38.740]
I'm doing great, sir.

[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:47.360]
I'm talking about Tony Roma was watching the two last night and I caught a Tony Roma and

[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:51.720]
Jill St. John movie, which was an only but goodie.

[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:58.020]
And Richard Conti was there playing a cop and he was playing lieutenant David Santini.

[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.560]
Oh, I'm glad you did.

[01:12:01.740 --> 01:12:02.660]
Whatever you get a chance.

[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.180]
Just watch.

[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.360]
Richard Coddy who of course was Barzini and the godfather.

[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.040]
Exactly.

[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.460]
We'll see him no more.

[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.280]
He played lieutenant David Santini.

[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.880]
That was one of my favorite scenes in that movie.

[01:12:14.020 --> 01:12:17.880]
Of course there's so many but when he was going up the stairs, you know, when he shot the

[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.860]
bodyguard and then he started turning and went back up the stairs and got a right about

[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.080]
a bane right in the back.

[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:22.660]
It was beautiful.

[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.740]
Yeah, that whole movie was shot by Emmy Beach by the way.

[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:25.680]
Which one?

[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.040]
What movie?

[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.060]
Tony Roma.

[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:27.860]
Oh, really?

[01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:29.860]
Yeah, I saw that about a hundred years ago.

[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.400]
It was Jill St. John.

[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.080]
What a beauty.

[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:32.980]
Yeah, exactly.

[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.120]
I do I do her in a dark.

[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:39.520]
Or anybody that was close back suddenly.

[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:40.540]
Okay, thanks, Balli.

[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:41.520]
With George Washington.

[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.980]
He said with you watching, I thought he was going to say with George Washington.

[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:50.300]
That's what I thought he said.

[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.180]
Well, George Washington had those wooden teeth so be careful.

[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.520]
27 past 11 at 560 WQA and do you have kids going back to college the next couple of weeks?

[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:03.360]

[01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:27.100]
My life and look all this is for 205-60.

[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:02.140]
It's gonna be a wild time at my home in New York, because to me, German cheats like a sport,

[01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:07.160]
I'm zip my flats all good, coming over honey now, blow on my trumpet.

[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.420]
A little bit of mama got in my glass, a little bit of mama got without my wife.

[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:18.060]
Now a little bit of mama got what I see, when she's far away that's Hillary Rhee.

[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:23.440]
A little bit of mama got what I need, a little bit of mama got in that more lease,

[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:29.240]
a little bit of mama got here, I am, a little bit of you, I'm a happy man.

[01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:40.340]
11-34-26 till noon, any minute now we're gonna start getting those numbers pumping in,

[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.360]
we think. Am I right? I guess.

[01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:45.420]
Anyway, how could we have forgotten, and that's the reason I played it,

[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:48.140]
somebody thanks Bill Clinton, how could we have left Bubba off there, right?

[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:49.160]
How'd it slide out of mind?

[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:52.840]
Now wasn't it Bubba who said from my cold dead hands, oh no, he didn't say that.

[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.580]
You'll love that in the movie, in the boy from Coliboy.

[01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:57.640]
You son of a bitch.

[01:15:57.900 --> 01:16:00.940]
Yeah, Chuck Kestin, and the best part of his when you see him kinda like,

[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:04.880]
when he's running away, you know, when he ends the interview, he's waddling away,

[01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:08.520]
when I say running, that would be an exaggeration, he's waddling away,

[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:14.580]
shuffling to the shuffling board court, and then of course you realize that now he's got the Alzheimer's thing,

[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.420]
and you say, well maybe there is a guy, after all.

[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.920]
So we might as well put Hillary on there too, right?

[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:24.100]
Come on, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, let's add those to as well.

[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:29.680]
Which of these American political entertainment figures do admire the most?

[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.260]
Michael Moore 61, an acting watch bloating for Coliboy to be a 6 million.

[01:16:34.580 --> 01:16:40.040]
I'm telling you, George W. Bush 18, Ralph Nader 14, Arnold Schwarzenegger 9,

[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:41.660]
Phil Mar 1.

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:44.780]
What just happened to my, hold on a minute.

[01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:59.040]
At a paper jam there, it sounded like the world was coming to it, I never had that before,

[01:16:59.160 --> 01:16:59.900]
but I fixed it.

[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.540]
Phil Mar 1, Martin Sheen 1, Tim Robbins 1, and we don't have the other names on her yet.

[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.180]
And that thing is still stuck.

[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.140]
Bill Clinton, your hot hole.

[01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.360]
Paper jam.

[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:32.560]
Paper jam, it gets my ass up, Bill.

[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:38.880]
It gets my ass up, Bill.

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.960]
What do they call this thing?

[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.640]
What thing are you talking about?

[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:52.680]
I don't know what you call it.

[01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:54.300]
I call mine Mr. Charlie.

[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.100]
What a mess.

[01:17:59.100 --> 01:17:59.980]
Holy crap.

[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.540]
One moment, please.

[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.840]
Oh, the bad never had that happen before, the paper was actually stuck in the drum.

[01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.460]
You know what I mean?

[01:18:14.980 --> 01:18:15.780]
No, what do you mean?

[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:19.000]
Well, that's because you don't know from your facts, machines, and proteins, what I do.

[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:20.200]
What?

[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:20.800]
Nothing.

[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:21.700]
The drum.

[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:26.160]
Here's the fact that says I thought these were numbers coming over.

[01:18:26.260 --> 01:18:26.920]
Now what does it say?

[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.740]
Oh, this is just another copy of the same thing.

[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.080]
Warren Beatty is a person to look up to.

[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:31.780]
He has it all.

[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.260]
Brains, looks, and broads.

[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:34.780]
Okay, let's go and a large penis too.

[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.120]
That's the rumor.

[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:38.680]
Next to Milton Burrell.

[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.920]
Hey, here we go, the person to numbers.

[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:41.900]
Okay, well, wait a minute.

[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:43.280]
Have you ever seen the movie Bullworth?

[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.580]
Yes, it was excellent, by the way, produced and written by Warren Beatty.

[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:46.460]
That's an outstanding movie.

[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.200]
I watched it a lot.

[01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.280]
I'm just basking you the stack.

[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:48.960]
I'm not sorting these out.

[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:49.780]
Love Johnny.

[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:50.380]
Thank you, Johnny.

[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:51.480]
Put Warren Beatty on here.

[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:51.880]
You got it?

[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:54.600]
This didn't Warren Beatty say for my cold dead hands.

[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:55.680]
Okay.

[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:57.560]
Oh, I love this story about the Vasectomy.

[01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.360]
We got to get that on.

[01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:00.080]
Okay, sorry.

[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.000]
Are you faxing me numbers?

[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:03.320]
Yes, and I'm not sorting them.

[01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.620]
I'm just putting the stack that they hand me in the machine.

[01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.280]
You just sort of stick them in there.

[01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:07.940]
Boy, it's a good thing.

[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:10.220]
I got that thing thickest before all these numbers came in.

[01:19:10.340 --> 01:19:10.480]
You know what?

[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:11.820]
Wouldn't that have been a mess?

[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:13.260]
Holy Toledo.

[01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:14.240]
And they were smiling.

[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:15.500]
Who's smiling?

[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.180]
Josh was smiling when he brought the numbers in.

[01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:17.860]
Clarence?

[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.660]
You said Josh?

[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:19.300]
Josh.

[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.220]
We have Josh Cordis and we have Clarence, uh, they're all right.

[01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:22.820]
Clarence.

[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.260]
Don't be calling him Josh.

[01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:24.600]
I'm not trying to be a liar.

[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:26.280]
He's the program director now.

[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.320]
You call him Clarence.

[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.740]
I mean, uh, you know who it was that named in Clarence?

[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:30.300]
Hey, stuff.

[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:30.900]
It's a Humper.

[01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:31.520]
Remember those days?

[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:32.300]
I'm a Homo.

[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:35.540]
Why do you, why do you, you don't like that, Josh?

[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:35.780]

[01:19:35.780 --> 01:19:36.160]
It's funny.

[01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:36.880]
He doesn't.

[01:19:37.740 --> 01:19:38.980]
He's on vacation anyway.

[01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:39.680]
We love Hank.

[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.020]
Of course we love Hank.

[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:41.820]
And he loves us.

[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.500]
Well, thank God for that.

[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.860]
See, we get along with everybody except one.

[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.260]
Absolutely.

[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:47.900]
I know this thing.

[01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.220]
Is this thing going to start printing?

[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.420]
Are you sending me anything or not?

[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.340]
It's, uh, it's spueling.

[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.840]
I don't hear nothing.

[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:55.460]
I'm gonna hear like a noise or screaming on my machine.

[01:19:55.600 --> 01:19:56.400]
But here, listen.

[01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:57.840]
Yeah.

[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.080]
Yeah, well, back at you.

[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:04.420]
Okay, folks, this is going to be, now what are we going to get for his 12-plot?

[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:10.080]
Oh, oh, oh.

[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:12.660]
I hear the machine getting ready to print.

[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:13.520]
I hear that sound.

[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:14.960]
I hear that noise.

[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:16.340]
I hear the door.

[01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.620]
Here's the first page.

[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:22.080]
Can it, Molly?

[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:22.820]
That's the first page.

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:22.820]

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:22.820]

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:22.820]

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:22.820]

[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:23.620]
Kill him.

[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.180]
Sixth and the midnight persons 12-plus.

[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:27.400]
Well, this ain't going to tell us too much.

[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.280]
Well, it might tell us a little.

[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:30.600]
We'll get ahead.

[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.300]
Number one, WLYF slush life.

[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:36.180]
Number one overall.

[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:37.040]
That's pretty sad.

[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.340]
Wrapping from number one to number two.

[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.640]
But they actually went up and shared from a 5'6 to a 5'7.

[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.420]
Power 96.

[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:42.700]
Oh, let's hear it.

[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:47.400]
Greg will be walking around a hallway to make a smile on his face with his finger and his deep inside where his brain used to be.

[01:20:49.540 --> 01:20:51.680]
WEDRFM from a 5.0 to a 5.3.

[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:52.640]
I'm not going to read all these numbers.

[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.200]
It's boring.

[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:57.060]
CMQ hot lot of disposal and shfos here in this book.

[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:58.600]
AMR, Radio Amor.

[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:00.220]
MIB, Men in Black.

[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:01.700]
When zooming up to a 3.9.

[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.660]
Love 94 up to a 3.7.

[01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:04.800]
That's the first page.

[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.620]
This is 12-plus keep in mind overall.

[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:07.440]
Wow.

[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.500]
WIOD, a little bit of a drop there.

[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:11.680]
I see a Radio Romance.

[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.520]
He has 9th.

[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:13.500]
Kisses 10th.

[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.100]
They went up again.

[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:16.840]
Must be a lot of trailer trash movement in the town.

[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:17.220]
You know what?

[01:21:19.060 --> 01:21:19.420]
Yeah.

[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:20.500]
All in kiss people.

[01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:21.860]
A lot of them most pickers.

[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.420]
Hey, we're up.

[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.080]
Just rely.

[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:24.560]
We are.

[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.620]
A little bit.

[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.320]
Wacky 3.4.

[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.260]
Well, it's only a 1 month.

[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:28.920]
It's just a trend.

[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.920]
IOD 3.4 to a 3.2.

[01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.380]
We'll slide there 12-plus.

[01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.080]
WXDJ.

[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:33.660]
What is that?

[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.180]
3.1.

[01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:35.120]
That's ethnic.

[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:35.760]
Right?

[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:36.620]
I guess.

[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:38.700]
Y100 about the same.

[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:39.080]
Big.

[01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:40.340]
2.8 to a 2.5.

[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:40.920]
PY.

[01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:42.000]
We're not on a second page.

[01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:42.740]
Party Radio.

[01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:45.300]
Well, this is 12-plus again.

[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.760]
This is meaningless, but it'll kill some excellent time.

[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:49.420]
I'm delighted that we're doing it this way.

[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.000]
Aren't you?

[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:50.440]
Yeah.

[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:53.760]
But it looks to me like the party's over at party.

[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:54.600]
That's my opinion.

[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:55.360]
I'm like this.

[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:56.460]
Yeah, I'd like to keep saying that.

[01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.060]
I just so I can play that drop-in.

[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.060]
QAM 2.1 to a 2.4.

[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.660]
That must be the for-all factor.

[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.760]
Oh, he's gone, Scott.

[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:03.680]
Don't you think?

[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.320]
I mean, it's the George factor here.

[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:06.900]
Or maybe it's the factor factor.

[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.680]
Or, and speak of that.

[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:14.460]
You know what the local media, and I remember I asked Kissing Bill O'Reilly column, not too many

[01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:17.460]
by Glenn Garvin, not too long ago, about how big he is on Fox.

[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:22.700]
And they don't mention the fact that his radio show has yet to even register in the market.

[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:23.460]
Not a blip.

[01:22:24.420 --> 01:22:27.000]
Lordass must be laughing up his fat sleeve, you know what?

[01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.260]
Because he doesn't show anything.

[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:30.720]
Not a fraction.

[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.080]
He's got a 0.0.

[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:36.100]
How do you like that?

[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.120]
I like it a lot.

[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:42.840]
Of course, Lordass, when you remember when he tried TV, it was kind of like my TV experience, although he had better production.

[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.200]
Man, was that a disaster, a big fat disaster.

[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.400]
Lordass, some people are cut out for radio, some people are cut out for TV.

[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:54.160]
And then like Bill O'Reilly, some people ought to just be cut it out.

[01:22:55.500 --> 01:23:00.700]
Oh, boy, he's, I want to make sure I don't run out of paper back there, but a lot of pressure now with his fax machine.

[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:02.920]
Thank God for my heavy duty equipment.

[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.420]
Okay, 12 plus in the morning.

[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.380]
Oh, let me do the break, because now we're starting to get some tape parts.

[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:08.720]
Here's like a little inkling.

[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.080]
You know who I bet is listening right now?

[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:10.660]
Absolutely.

[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.300]
I'm listening.

[01:23:12.860 --> 01:23:13.680]
We hate you, Mo.

[01:23:14.100 --> 01:23:16.480]
Like poison, and it's not stick, it's the truth.

[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.540]
And when I'm there in town next week, don't come anywhere.

[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.640]
I don't want to see you.

[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:21.500]
I don't want to smell you or your nasty bag.

[01:23:21.900 --> 01:23:24.260]
I don't want to see that mousey looking piece, that muskrat.

[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:28.720]
That was great when Zactiq that picture him doing the muskrat ramble.

[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.080]
I was way to the parking lot this morning.

[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:34.220]
With that t-shirt that says, do you think I'm an FN person?

[01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:35.720]
And of course, everybody's saying no.

[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:36.280]

[01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:42.320]
1141 at 560 WQM, if you're underpaid, overworked and unappreciated, like so many, how would

[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:44.420]
you like to have a new high-paying career before years end?

[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:44.780]
Uh-huh.

[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.380]

[01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:09.660]
day Todd Direct might tell us where the other two are.

[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.480]
Fast Train offers financial assistance for those who qualify.

[01:24:12.940 --> 01:24:16.340]

[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.080]
866 Fast Train.

[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.620]
A Hard or a Liver?

[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:42.900]
560 WQAM is relieved to present the Forerel and Guldi Show.

[01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:45.240]
Valorant.

[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:45.620]
Stop!

[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.960]
Boy, it's your slow-firing here now that it's all time!

[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:52.140]
Yeah, I don't have to bring a towel in the life of the chair off no more.

[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:52.760]
Yeah!

[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:54.560]
Yeah!

[01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:55.840]
Yeah!

[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:56.860]
Yeah!

[01:24:56.860 --> 01:24:57.280]
Yeah!

[01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:57.280]

[01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:58.580]
Yeah!

[01:24:59.000 --> 01:24:59.160]
Yeah!

[01:25:00.140 --> 01:25:02.180]
I didn't stay with that voice all day!

[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:03.180]
Look how it's talking!

[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.900]
I don't know if he sounded like that.

[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:06.660]
No, this isn't my voice.

[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:08.120]
I'm not putting you on it.

[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:10.060]
Every day I wake up sound in the same way.

[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.480]
Hey, if your voice is...

[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.240]
I was...

[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.720]
Oh, yeah!

[01:25:16.020 --> 01:25:16.500]
Oh, yeah!

[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.540]
Yeah, I was saying.

[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.640]
You want to change your voice?

[01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:23.280]
Yeah!

[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.660]
I want to grab you when I do!

[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.300]
How long you got to do is grab your balls like this!

[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.400]
Oh, that voice!

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:34.380]
Oh, I got my balls!

[01:25:34.580 --> 01:25:36.020]
I'm wearing these in a fine towel!

[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.940]
I'm wearing your balls!

[01:25:39.460 --> 01:25:44.300]
Oh, I thought you were going to come for grip!

[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.300]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:49.540]
Yeah!

[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.080]
Yeah, you got your voice changing!

[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:51.780]
Yeah!

[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:52.200]
Quick!

[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:53.320]
Yeah!

[01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:55.140]
Yeah!

[01:25:55.140 --> 01:25:55.200]
Yeah!

[01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:55.900]
Yeah!

[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:56.720]
Yeah!

[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:56.740]
Yeah!

[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:58.080]
Yeah!

[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:58.540]
Yeah!

[01:25:58.980 --> 01:25:58.980]

[01:25:59.180 --> 01:25:59.360]
Yeah!

[01:25:59.360 --> 01:25:59.400]
Yeah!

[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:00.940]
Yeah!

[01:26:02.140 --> 01:26:02.740]
Yeah!

[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.400]
Exactly, I'm 46.

[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.220]
Could you please add Bob Grandelus's Luendelle Westdale Ray?

[01:26:12.220 --> 01:26:14.060]
Okay, we got Bob Grandelus on there.

[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:16.260]
How's it coming so far?

[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.080]
137.

[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.140]
What's in these American political or entertainment figures

[01:26:19.140 --> 01:26:19.840]
you admire most?

[01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:22.900]
Michael Morissette, George W. 21, Ralph Nader 15,

[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.300]
Arnold Schwarzenegger 14.

[01:26:24.440 --> 01:26:25.000]
That's pretty sad.

[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.040]
Bubba, we just put him on, he's already up to 8.

[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:27.840]
He's going to smoke.

[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:29.520]
Martin Sheen's three.

[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:30.420]
He did smoke.

[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:30.760]
Come on down now.

[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:31.160]
Thank you, Greg.

[01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.060]
Bill, for what?

[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.720]
We're number one, David!

[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:36.540]
And so, Jake.

[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:38.320]
And what?

[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.300]
Open his mic up.

[01:26:39.900 --> 01:26:40.860]
So we can all hear him.

[01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.520]
Open whose mic up?

[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.000]
Great, isn't it?

[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:44.260]
Hey, Greg.

[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:45.160]
Hi, Johnny.

[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:48.880]
Looks like your number one, many team plus for the month,

[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:49.400]
Hank was the one.

[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:50.060]
What was it?

[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.560]
Mornings was even number two.

[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:53.100]
And nights was number two.

[01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.140]
Mornings was number two.

[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.420]
Number two, extrapolated for the month of July.

[01:26:59.140 --> 01:27:00.720]
Well, you know what that's all about, don't you?

[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:03.960]
Absolutely.

[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:06.300]
I don't want to put any pressure on you to say it,

[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:07.360]
but you know that's all about.

[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.720]
Great, we're on our way, baby.

[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:11.000]
You called it two months ago.

[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:11.760]
You said we're on the way.

[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.080]
Now, it totally would be this trend, didn't I tell you?

[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:14.660]
Yes, you did.

[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.960]
See you next week, Greg.

[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.160]
I'll be there right in the flesh.

[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:17.940]
Okay.

[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:20.180]
You can shake my hand and put your, you know,

[01:27:21.300 --> 01:27:22.540]
pat my bald spot.

[01:27:22.700 --> 01:27:23.220]
Okay, look at that.

[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:23.960]
We're really kicking ass.

[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:26.360]
And the best part of it is Georgia ain't getting any credit.

[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:27.340]
Did he say nice going?

[01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:29.100]
No, I don't know.

[01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:30.940]
Well, no, because the month is mostly you.

[01:27:31.060 --> 01:27:33.380]
I'm only on Tuesdays and Thursdays and most of you lie.

[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.980]
Except the first couple of days.

[01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.200]
It's a lot of you.

[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.360]
Of course, keep in mind in the past summers.

[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.160]
In the beginning, Georgia is pretty well known.

[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:44.520]
As the summer goes on, they start getting really tired of your ass, you know.

[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:46.220]
No, but this is great.

[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:48.460]
And the reason being that now, number one,

[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:51.840]
we got our timed slot back, 10 to 2.

[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.560]
Oh, and we got to leave it.

[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:53.940]
Oh!

[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:56.760]
For the first time in a, I'm trying to think of when.

[01:27:56.980 --> 01:27:58.340]
When's the last time I had a real lead in?

[01:28:00.020 --> 01:28:00.380]
Never.

[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.660]
Now, I see Sus is going to be upset about that.

[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:04.440]
No, he won't.

[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:05.740]
He won't?

[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:05.960]
No.

[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.100]
He hates Rick too.

[01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:09.500]
Okay, so anyway, here's the men numbers.

[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:10.760]
Many tell this is good.

[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.400]
Because actually now I'm got these organized.

[01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.720]
Humper did well, Humper in even 12 plus one from a 2-3 up to a 2-8.

[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:18.640]
If you people out there are bored by these numbers, I understand that.

[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:20.680]
But everybody in a business gets psychotic about this.

[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.160]
They turn to old Neil.

[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:22.600]
They do.

[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:25.840]
Every time there's a trend or a rating book or whatever, just to get an idea

[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.580]
whether they still have a job or not, whether they should go home and blow their brains out.

[01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.640]
That was very nice and great to come in.

[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.880]
There was, he must be in a good mood, huh?

[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:32.600]
He has no.

[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:33.660]
Well, that's good.

[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:34.920]
Nice, he powered it well.

[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:35.760]
We're doing well.

[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:37.060]
We're kicking ass and off for well.

[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:38.360]
What did I tell you?

[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:40.520]
I told you about that goddamn pervert, didn't I?

[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:41.600]
Yeah.

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:43.740]
I told you he was going to kick some big smelly ass.

[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:44.960]
And I bet he's listening right now.

[01:28:45.020 --> 01:28:45.880]
Nice going, Scott.

[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:48.520]
I had my thumb on it.

[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:49.560]
I knew right off the bat.

[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:50.000]

[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:50.740]
Ah!

[01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:52.700]
Ah!

[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:53.100]
Ah!

[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.700]
And of course, like I told you before, you know who's going to be taking credit for two months.

[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.240]
Absolutely.

[01:28:58.460 --> 01:29:01.840]
Till the whole book comes out and we can scrap or rate the hour by hour.

[01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:06.060]
Now let's see, 6 to 10 a.m. and many team plus.

[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:09.280]
Oh, I see they extrapolated the months already.

[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.640]
Boy, they're really on top of it, huh?

[01:29:12.220 --> 01:29:12.820]
I bet you're right.

[01:29:12.820 --> 01:29:12.820]

[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:15.740]
He's in there with clearance and they're like feverishly working on it.

[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:18.420]
I have the 2554 persons obviously.

[01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:21.000]
And the persons 18 to 3040 want both these stacks?

[01:29:21.660 --> 01:29:22.060]
No.

[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:22.480]
Okay.

[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.440]
I don't want to either one of those stacks.

[01:29:25.020 --> 01:29:28.760]
I mean, maybe later on, but right now give me, you cut me some slack, Jack.

[01:29:29.300 --> 01:29:30.440]
As Barbara Williamsly would say.

[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:35.700]
6 to 10 a.m. and big Howard Spurms, 7 to 7 with 6 to 2.

[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:37.660]
You see the IOD factor is dropping down.

[01:29:37.940 --> 01:29:39.000]
And why is it dropping down?

[01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:42.660]
We know why because the war is supposedly over, even though we got our people dying every day.

[01:29:42.700 --> 01:29:43.620]
And a lot of other people too.

[01:29:44.040 --> 01:29:46.980]
But they had the big spike there because it's the all-new station.

[01:29:47.300 --> 01:29:49.240]
And of course the right wingers would learn to ask,

[01:29:49.460 --> 01:29:51.780]
Elish Mittmeister, who also I see went down some.

[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:56.320]
Men, big, 6 to 2 that's Howard Spurms in the morning, but about a point and a half drop there, Howard.

[01:29:57.100 --> 01:29:58.320]
Wacky, a radio mum B.

[01:29:58.580 --> 01:29:59.900]
Isn't that a radio mum B is Wacky?

[01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:00.380]
I don't know.

[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:01.820]
They are Wacky.

[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.240]
They went from a 5-2 to a 5-0, just in number 2.

[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:06.560]
Hot four, they went up a little bit there, 4.8.

[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.720]
W-I-O-D, like I said, they went up in men in the morning, I would leave it.

[01:30:09.720 --> 01:30:12.560]
But that's the news thing, 4-0 to a 4-6, does that make any sense to you?

[01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:12.900]
Nope.

[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.260]
I don't get it.

[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:15.960]
Now what about in midday?

[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:16.960]
Did they go up in midday?

[01:30:18.380 --> 01:30:19.480]
Let's see, look at that.

[01:30:19.820 --> 01:30:21.140]
That is outstanding.

[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:24.060]
I can't believe it.

[01:30:24.140 --> 01:30:26.480]
And I've been, do you people that want to rip Georgian ass?

[01:30:26.740 --> 01:30:29.520]
Let me say it again, not that I would stand up for him because it's far from me to do it.

[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.660]
We're number one, David!

[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:37.140]
C-I-O-D-662, not a big drop, but in the individual month, I bet you they, uh, I didn't

[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.060]
Greg just say in the individual month, we were number one.

[01:30:39.220 --> 01:30:39.640]
That's what he said.

[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.980]
So you put that in your pipe and smoke it all you George Bashers out there.

[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:45.660]
How do you like that?

[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:46.480]
Bill and Davey.

[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:48.120]
Yeah, Bill and Davey.

[01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.100]
Oh, I like Bill and Davey, he likes me.

[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:54.940]
Oh, that's, I mean, you know, look, you've got people who listen when you're on, who hate me like poison.

[01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:59.420]
But, you know, every, every time I mention that you go, like that.

[01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.020]
Well, there's a few, there's a lot.

[01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:06.000]
I'm just a, I'm just a dotting old Jew, okay?

[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:06.420]
I'm on the way.

[01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.320]
I'm living legend.

[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:08.160]
Yeah, right.

[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.980]
And trenched into the community there.

[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.460]
Will you say something about trench violence?

[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:15.060]
Well, if you've been around like I have, you might have trench violence too.

[01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:17.760]
Although, at least it's better having crotch rot like Mo.

[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:18.300]
Absolutely.

[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.260]
This is great.

[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:22.620]
Well, hallelujah, man.

[01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:23.460]
We're in a good mood.

[01:31:23.460 --> 01:31:24.720]
Let's have a freaking party.

[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.420]
Get some food in there, okay?

[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:28.340]
Alrighty, how is, thank you very much, how is.

[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.700]
What do you mean by that?

[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.020]
How is brought food in in the morning?

[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:31.780]
We got our sandwiches.

[01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:34.780]
We love how is and how is can still bring the bacon in when I'm there.

[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:36.040]
I'm still doing my bacon.

[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:39.820]
I know it's not really great for you, but temporarily it's something.

[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.100]
So anyway, what did I say about, oh, uh, many team plus?

[01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.740]
What am I doing here?

[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:51.200]
Where's, oh, I see three seven or three nine in the morning, but that, but in the individual month we were number two.

[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:53.340]
See what I'm saying?

[01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:53.740]
Mm-hmm.

[01:31:53.980 --> 01:32:00.480]
So to see the for real fact, do you have to break it down monthly because this still includes May and June, which in the morning we're very, very weak.

[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:02.660]
And then July when they had to spike upward.

[01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:06.200]
Nice going Scott because we're number one.

[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:07.500]
Give me.

[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:08.280]
You'll see.

[01:32:09.100 --> 01:32:09.780]
You'll see.

[01:32:09.980 --> 01:32:13.080]
Finally, Greg, after diddling around and screwing up the station like crazy.

[01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:14.520]
I should have mentioned this when he was in there.

[01:32:15.380 --> 01:32:20.320]
Finally, gets the pieces put back together and at least most of the pieces, because I would say from eight in the morning till

[01:32:21.660 --> 01:32:22.960]
midnight, we're kicking ass.

[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:23.860]
Wouldn't you?

[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:24.620]
Sure.

[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.740]
Even the marlins are going to go up because their TV numbers are way up because now there's some interest in it.

[01:32:28.860 --> 01:32:33.280]
Don Trell is a pitching like hell and they're like half a game out of the wild card.

[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:33.780]
They're in it.

[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.760]
Even you're excited about aren't you?

[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:38.440]
Oh, I'm vibrating about it.

[01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:43.480]
So we're looking at big radio mom B hot I.O.D. Zeta.

[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.120]
Let's see, we don't want to leave them out.

[01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:49.520]
Your close personal friend Paul and old Ron for two up to a four five is the number five and men in the morning.

[01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:50.960]
A life.

[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:54.920]
Look at his life went up again 3.7 to a four point.

[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.360]
Life is number six and many team plus must be the war.

[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:00.360]
What is that mean?

[01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.280]
It must be the war.

[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.520]
Must be the war people want to listen to slush.

[01:33:06.740 --> 01:33:09.040]
Q.A.M. like I said actually went up.

[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:11.100]
It's the for Ralph factor, baby.

[01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:15.540]
EDR 3.0 to a 3.9 and of course Mo is thinking of himself.

[01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:19.940]
You just wait until those whole book comes out in the hour by hour and comes to find out that I'm the one that went up.

[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:22.540]
And while we could say yeah, you should live so long you silly old.

[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:23.460]
Hey, it might happen.

[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:25.500]
How much you want to bet?

[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.180]
I'll bet you grace life right now on I'll bet you that.

[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.000]
What do you give me?

[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.000]
It's about 40 cent.

[01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:31.880]
Give me 100 to one odds.

[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:32.820]
Maybe not 40.

[01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:33.780]
About 30 man.

[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.260]
10 to 3 Q.A.M. sitting right there back on top.

[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:38.860]
We're number one.

[01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:41.820]
Because now 10 to 2 is 10 to 2.

[01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:43.000]
And that's 10 to 3.

[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:45.440]
So I bet you the mad dog did good to let's see about the Humper.

[01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:46.400]
Huh?

[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:52.220]
Are they going to fax me the individual monthly extrapolations or is he just going to come in there and like you know?

[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:54.400]
I don't think they actually have that like printed out yet.

[01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:58.560]
No, no, he just got through saying were you paying any attention to what he was saying?

[01:33:58.700 --> 01:34:00.500]
Was he too busy with their hair's hand on your ass?

[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:03.560]
But that means that they might have had a phone call from a consultant or something.

[01:34:03.660 --> 01:34:04.620]
No, no, no.

[01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.820]
I would be six six to what six to their number two.

[01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:09.020]
They're dropping like a rock CMQ.

[01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:10.180]
What is CMQ?

[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:11.080]
I know it's a speech station.

[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.140]
What do they do?

[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:12.700]
What do they play?

[01:34:12.780 --> 01:34:13.260]
What do they say?

[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:14.160]
I wouldn't know.

[01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:16.820]
WCMQFM does anybody know?

[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:18.900]
Life.

[01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.860]
Life is a fourth and midday in man.

[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:23.680]
They keep going up and up love.

[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:24.840]
Oh look at that.

[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.580]
I love 9435 to a four five.

[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:27.280]
That's bogus.

[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.080]
Power.

[01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:30.660]
And there's no sensory knowledge.

[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:31.020]
Okay.

[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:31.740]
How about in the afternoon?

[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:32.600]
Look at that.

[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:34.400]
Look at that.

[01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:36.800]
Or you add man.

[01:34:37.100 --> 01:34:40.280]
I'm on three to seven PM many team plus this.

[01:34:40.360 --> 01:34:41.200]
Oh wow.

[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.380]
This is too bad that Hank is on vacation this week.

[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.560]
Because the mad dog being in their three to four is helping.

[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.640]
Of course, and Hank is making a big comeback.

[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:49.860]
Look at that.

[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:56.160]
4.9 in the spring to a 5.9, which means we had a hellacious, a humongous July.

[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:00.560]
And in the afternoon, how mad dog and a hupper can say.

[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:02.320]
We're number one.

[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:03.000]
Dammit.

[01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:03.820]
And it's not even close.

[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.860]
5.9 because the IOD in the Schmidt mice to drop from a 5.7 to a 5.5.

[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.880]
So it's like about a half a point and pulling away in the stretch.

[01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.720]
Power is a third in many team plus.

[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:16.720]
I don't understand that.

[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:17.560]
EDR CMQ.

[01:35:18.180 --> 01:35:19.560]
This was a heavy ethnic book too.

[01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:21.460]
MIB men in black 4.2.

[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:23.840]
So there you go.

[01:35:23.940 --> 01:35:26.320]
Should we take a look and see if the Marlins actually made an impact here?

[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:26.760]
Sure.

[01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:27.160]
Probably not.

[01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:30.780]
Someone called and said that CMQ is classic oldies Spanish.

[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.440]
You know what that means, don't you?

[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.180]
Is that a little dog going to walk?

[01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:35.280]
You mean like that?

[01:35:35.420 --> 01:35:35.540]
Yeah.

[01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.960]
Oh, look at that.

[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.280]
They're number one in men in the night.

[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.540]
CMQ FM classical.

[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:41.840]
Do they want to play the with Miguel?

[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:44.900]
Maybe six three.

[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:46.320]
They went from a four six to a six three.

[01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:48.120]
This was a heavy, spow-in-chvo book band.

[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:48.480]
A trend.

[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.720]
And we still did great.

[01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:52.020]
Power number two.

[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.840]
MIB all the way up to number three from seventh in the trend.

[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:55.380]
EDR.

[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:57.600]
IOD 532-544.

[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.880]
That's Phil's number and...

[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.300]

[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.100]

[01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:05.740]
Norey.

[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.200]

[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:08.880]
Norey.

[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:09.520]
Norey.

[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:10.360]
Norey, that's the guy.

[01:36:11.180 --> 01:36:11.880]
Is he good?

[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:12.760]
No.

[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:16.940]
10, 11, 56, is 5, 60, where we're having a party because...

[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:19.200]
We're number one, dammit!

[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:23.480]

[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.420]
You know, this is the time of year all the sportsbooks are claiming that they're the biggest

[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.520]
or the best to make all kinds of misleading offers.

[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:42.240]
But did you know that 99% of these bookies are located in the jungles of Costa Rica?

[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:42.600]
No.

[01:36:43.060 --> 01:36:45.620]
In fact, when you call there, you know what you hear in the background?

[01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:47.060]
When you're online, I'm on hold.

[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:48.900]

I am Frao Iliana, Roseladen and I like scrubbing my smelly grilla as with soap made from juice.

[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.760]
And listening to the new Roque, communist hour.

[01:37:57.100 --> 01:37:57.440]
Take care!

[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.020]
We're on a earth governor's all we hear.

[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:24.800]
If he's loaded in, they'll be a big change.

[01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.900]
You're gonna feel the burn, you'll feel the pain.

[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:39.840]
The glossy plants too pass include ones to pump you up like guppaloo.

[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:49.760]
I tell me, California, I hear you curse.

[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:55.100]
You'll I'll be a mister universe, see the kids will get their training.

[01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:58.140]
The lunch boxes will I'll be waiting.

[01:38:58.660 --> 01:39:01.880]
Tell me, that the vote for the movie star.

[01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:04.660]
We're in sex with the happy bars.

[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:10.860]
I hope you're ready for our governor's watch, hang around here.

[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:17.200]
303-560-WQAM, happy Thursday.

[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.840]
It's a great moment to stay at QAM.

[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:21.460]
You have a big party yet?

[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:22.600]
In my pants.

[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:23.900]
Okay, me too.

[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:24.700]
Squirt, Squirt.

[01:39:26.300 --> 01:39:26.920]
Party's over.

[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.100]
Here's those monthly's that we're looking for.

[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.620]
Look at this, this is spectacular if I say so myself.

[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.340]
In July, overall the station went from a 4.2 in June to a 5.8.

[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:41.880]
I don't know these numbers don't mean much to the average.

[01:39:42.180 --> 01:39:47.420]
Wait till you hear this 6 to 10 AM, what a number.

[01:39:47.740 --> 01:39:48.140]
Absolutely.

[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.020]
Because the moment was dying in there.

[01:39:51.180 --> 01:39:56.520]
I mean, 4.4 in April, 3.9 in May, a 2.8 in June, a number from hell.

[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.760]
And now in July, a 5.0.

[01:39:58.760 --> 01:39:58.900]
Oh!

[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:01.740]
So if we had a 5.0, you know what that means don't you?

[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:02.820]
You multiply times 2.

[01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.680]
Okay, see what I'm saying?

[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:05.000]
Right?

[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:06.700]
Because there's two segments.

[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:08.300]
There's two two hour segments, two two.

[01:40:09.100 --> 01:40:13.760]
So if you got 10 points there between 6 and 10, see what I'm saying?

[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:14.220]
Right?

[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.340]
That means that Pharrell had an 8 and Mo had a 2.

[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:20.520]
Or maybe.

[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.360]
Or maybe you had a 9.5 and...

[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.520]
Come on, you're brutal.

[01:40:26.400 --> 01:40:27.920]
He held the door for me this morning.

[01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:28.700]
We're best friends now.

[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:29.240]
The moment?

[01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.780]
Or the crap you could unwrap.

[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:32.940]
Okay, that's the way you'd like to give you.

[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.160]
So a 5.0 in July NOW!

[01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:36.200]
Ho ho!

[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:40.080]
When you hear the midday 10 to 3, look at that in June.

[01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:44.760]
We had a 7.1 share in men in July, which is mostly George a 7.0.

[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:46.200]
That is sensational, George.

[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:47.240]

[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:48.380]
Nice going, George.

[01:40:49.220 --> 01:40:50.700]
Just to piss off, what?

[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:51.700]
Yeah, drop my ass.

[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.480]
Oh, no, start playing, Mr. Humble now.

[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.880]
Don't start with that's bad.

[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:57.640]
That's in very, not a good...

[01:40:57.640 --> 01:40:58.480]
Technique, okay?

[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.460]
Now he's supposed to take the assertive position.

[01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:03.020]
Say, see, I told you we're kicking ass.

[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:03.920]
4.8.

[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.980]
Yeah, that little guava 11-spick.

[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.460]
He sure is how beaten the crap out of you.

[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.260]
See, that is what really gets me.

[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:11.760]
That's what really gets me.

[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:15.440]
Here's this disgusting smelly old koot who comes into town.

[01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:16.360]
This is everybody off.

[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:17.640]
Try to get your ass fired.

[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:20.960]
And you're sitting there with a 7-share while he's a suckin' wind, man.

[01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:23.880]
Suckin' whatever he can get his false teeth on.

[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:24.560]
Breaking wind.

[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:26.240]
Man, he is breaking wind.

[01:41:26.880 --> 01:41:27.960]
That's why we've versed it.

[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:31.960]
And I said back at you right on his grave on the cover on our CD.

[01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:34.680]
Don't forget to best annealed by the way on our website.

[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:36.880]
And then look at the afternoon.

[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:38.400]
Here is the story, man.

[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:39.120]
All right.

[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.600]
The mad dog and the humber.

[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:42.420]
4.7.

[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:43.280]
April and men.

[01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.720]
5.0 and may.

[01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.140]
5.1 and June.

[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.240]
And a 7.6 in July.

[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:50.540]
The highest number on the station.

[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.980]
The mad dog and the humber.

[01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:55.420]
So we get our midday's back.

[01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:58.000]
And with all due respect to you, can you imagine?

[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:00.920]
What's going to happen starting on Monday?

[01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.540]
No, what?

[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:04.000]
When we get back to our full schedule.

[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:04.660]
Oh, got it.

[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.940]
We're taking all prisoners, baby.

[01:42:06.080 --> 01:42:06.860]
We're leaving them all behind.

[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:08.320]
We're leaving everybody else in our wake.

[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:10.740]
And just to show you that, remember I said about the Marlins?

[01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:11.800]
Right?

[01:42:12.060 --> 01:42:14.860]
And men went from a 2.4 to a 4.0 point.

[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:16.760]
And in the individual month of July,

[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.000]
7 am in that we had a 6.6.

[01:42:19.100 --> 01:42:20.440]
So we had a gigantic July.

[01:42:20.860 --> 01:42:23.160]
Thank you all so very much for sucking our ass.

[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:23.760]
We love it.

[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:24.660]
Isn't that great?

[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:25.820]
Let's fuck back.

[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:26.700]
Man, that was great.

[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.700]
No, we don't suck.

[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:30.000]
Well, it was a wee.

[01:42:30.300 --> 01:42:31.520]
Got a total of pending.

[01:42:32.080 --> 01:42:32.480]
All the pending.

[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:34.280]
So we got all this other stuff here too.

[01:42:34.660 --> 01:42:35.740]
But nobody cares about it.

[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:36.360]
Like the weekends.

[01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.660]
Nobody cares about the weekends.

[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.880]
It's time to go home and shut off the switch and get some rest.

[01:42:41.320 --> 01:42:41.820]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:45.280]
So there goes Scott.

[01:42:45.500 --> 01:42:46.260]
Nice going for Ralph.

[01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.080]
Just like I predicted.

[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.880]
And I tell him this morning he's getting all paranoid.

[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.020]
I told him the first month and the first trend.

[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:53.100]
Nothing after the format change.

[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.980]
And then the second month through the roof.

[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.360]
I mean, look at that.

[01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:59.560]
A 5.0 and men from a 2.8.

[01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:01.520]
And you know it's all 8 to 10.

[01:43:01.660 --> 01:43:02.880]
Is there any question about that?

[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.080]
No.

[01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:03.480]
No.

[01:43:03.860 --> 01:43:04.880]
Even Moe agrees.

[01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:05.500]
Absolutely.

[01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:06.940]
He knows it's all a for real.

[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:10.200]
No, but seriously, but for real can keep him alive now.

[01:43:10.380 --> 01:43:11.960]
He can maintain it a morning thing.

[01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:12.840]
No, no, seriously.

[01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:13.360]
That's for real.

[01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:16.140]
He's like for real is life support for the daughtering of who.

[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.760]
He's got experience keeping people alive.

[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:18.440]
Wow.

[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.840]
Are you going to start with that beater boy stuff again?

[01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:23.440]
Not me.

[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:24.260]
God.

[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:26.120]
What do you think Moe is saying about this?

[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:27.380]
Probably.

[01:43:28.580 --> 01:43:29.920]
I'm taking all the credit for it.

[01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:30.120]
Okay.

[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:31.680]
They can't tell who it is.

[01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:32.300]
And it's all me.

[01:43:32.420 --> 01:43:33.040]
And it's all guilty.

[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.460]
And mostly me and a little bit of guilty.

[01:43:35.980 --> 01:43:37.440]
From my cool dead hands, Moe.

[01:43:39.220 --> 01:43:39.860]
5.6705.

[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:40.180]
Oh, wait.

[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.620]
We've got to get this circumcision of the vasectomy story on.

[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.040]
This is good.

[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.600]
From Rio de Janeiro, a 10th world country.

[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:46.500]
Brazil.

[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:50.620]
A Brazilian man who went to a clinic to have an aching ear check.

[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:52.560]
All this stuff kind of stuff happened in the US all the time.

[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.340]
Many were sore here.

[01:43:53.520 --> 01:43:54.340]
And here in Soflo.

[01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:59.380]
A Brazilian man who went to a clinic to have an aching ear check ended up having a vasectomy

[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:01.980]
after mistakenly believing the doctor had called his name.

[01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:07.720]
A manager at the doctor Jose Carlos de Espirito Santo Clinic in the town of Montes Clados in

[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.180]
Southeast and Minas de Raias State.

[01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:12.020]
Well, that's just rolling off my tongue this morning.

[01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.180]
Told Reuters on Wednesday.

[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:17.220]
Valde Mar Lopez de Marais 39 enter the vasectomy room.

[01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:17.820]
Alde Mar.

[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:19.820]
Aparecido with Rodriguez.

[01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.660]
The name was called Mr. Rodriguez.

[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.180]
And now you see, isn't that interesting?

[01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:26.380]
You only wish you would have been well.

[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.040]
I don't want to say that.

[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.460]
He was called by the full name and he thought it was him.

[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.980]
But the strangest thing is that he asked no questions when the doctors started preparations in the

[01:44:33.980 --> 01:44:35.640]
era which had so little to do with his ear.

[01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:37.080]
Vanessa Grimade said.

[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:38.080]
Yeah, I would have piped up.

[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.400]
No, not him.

[01:44:39.460 --> 01:44:40.060]
This is in Brazil.

[01:44:40.060 --> 01:44:40.640]
Don't forget.

[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.420]
He thought it was a bonus.

[01:44:43.020 --> 01:44:45.680]
Yeah, he thought it was just getting a little friendly attention.

[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:50.420]
He later explained that he thought it was an ear inflammation that got down to his testicle.

[01:44:50.500 --> 01:44:50.860]
She added.

[01:44:51.420 --> 01:44:52.080]
Oh, yeah.

[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:53.560]
Well, your ear is near your ear.

[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.860]
Dr. Marais, a farmer who has two children and now want to reverse the operation, performed last week and showed

[01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:02.660]
off for an ear exam on Wednesday at the same clinic.

[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:03.680]
He came back from Moe.

[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:07.880]
A local newspaper said he's going to sue us but did not tell us anything about any claims.

[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.500]
Grimade said he ain't suing nobody.

[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.100]
He likes it.

[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.840]
Maybe he wants to be a guy named Sue or something like that.

[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:13.960]
So that's kind of a cute story.

[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:14.980]
Here's the facts.

[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:15.400]
Let's see.

[01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:16.700]
We already added on our thing.

[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:19.540]
Well, I'll warn Vady and Bob Graham.

[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:20.360]
Right?

[01:45:20.580 --> 01:45:20.980]
Are they on there?

[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:21.900]
Yes.

[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:23.200]
They are.

[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:24.660]
Well, they're supposed to be.

[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:27.680]
Oh, and Gervidol and Catrine Evandent Hovel.

[01:45:28.260 --> 01:45:28.660]
Hoop.

[01:45:29.040 --> 01:45:30.160]
Because there's a fact she said.

[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:31.620]
I'd like to nominate Gervidol.

[01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.340]
But Catrine Evandent Hovel editor of the nation is my favorite woman.

[01:45:34.660 --> 01:45:36.100]
She's brilliant, pretty angry looking too.

[01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:39.400]
Proof that beauty and brains in the back conflict says this fact is from somewhere.

[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:41.520]
So we're building less pretty good.

[01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:45.780]
We got a few votes on Air 187, which is not overwhelming, but, you know, what do you expect?

[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:50.360]
Which of these American political or entertainment figures do you admire the most?

[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.620]
Michael Moore 81.

[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:52.560]
Are you nobody close?

[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.360]
Don't forget you must go out and rent or buy bowling for Columbiner's steal it and watch it today.

[01:45:57.900 --> 01:45:58.780]
It's mandatory.

[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:01.060]
George W. Bush 28.

[01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:02.900]
Bill Clinton's already had it.

[01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:04.360]
It was a very late edition 27.

[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.040]
He'll pass W. Like he's standing still.

[01:46:06.780 --> 01:46:07.660]
Arnold 17.

[01:46:09.020 --> 01:46:11.060]
There's only one question I'd like to ask about that.

[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:11.680]
Why?

[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:13.480]
Yeah, based on what?

[01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:14.920]
Ralph Nader 16.

[01:46:15.380 --> 01:46:16.820]
Maybe it's because he saw articulate.

[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.360]
Molly Ivens 5.

[01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:19.180]
Bill Mara 4.

[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.160]
Martin Sheen 3.

[01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.320]
From the Sheenie Alps.

[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:23.420]
Marine Douds got a pair.

[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:24.420]
Tim Robbins 2.

[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:25.840]
Bobby Graham's got one.

[01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:26.720]
Gervid Al's got one.

[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:28.440]
And none yet for Katrina Vandent Hovel.

[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.280]
Once this fact gets to their PC.

[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.700]
As long as they don't have the big warm.

[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.860]
You notice the new worm?

[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.340]
No, I haven't noticed.

[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:37.460]
The so big F.

[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.380]
So big.

[01:46:38.660 --> 01:46:40.060]
The worm that's so big.

[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.540]
It's so damn big.

[01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.780]
It's a worm that's like a runaway trouser snake.

[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:44.520]
It's so big.

[01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.760]
Maybe just because I installed all that though.

[01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:49.520]
The updated window stuff.

[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:52.700]
I'm just not kind of what I don't want to give myself a career.

[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:53.820]
I have had no problem with that.

[01:46:53.820 --> 01:46:54.700]
Were we having any of these there?

[01:46:55.420 --> 01:46:56.180]
They're worm free.

[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:58.200]
Damn it.

[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.900]
Here's a call from Margate.

[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:01.180]
Hello?

[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.020]
Hello, Neil.

[01:47:03.500 --> 01:47:03.900]
Yes, sir.

[01:47:04.980 --> 01:47:07.740]
What do you think about the Balagotian, your poll?

[01:47:10.280 --> 01:47:11.740]
They admire him the most.

[01:47:12.260 --> 01:47:13.100]
Yes, I do.

[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:14.200]
He's dead.

[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.660]
I like George Washington.

[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:17.320]
Thomas.

[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:18.200]
Yeah, okay, great.

[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:18.920]
Call before.

[01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:20.740]
Call before for what?

[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.340]
That was the same call as before.

[01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:24.320]
The same asset as before.

[01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:26.400]
56670560.

[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:27.160]
Just an asset.

[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:27.740]
That's okay.

[01:47:27.740 --> 01:47:29.900]
It doesn't cost anything to show your ass to the world on this show.

[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:30.120]
Correct.

[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:30.800]
No problem.

[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:31.840]
Moron.

[01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:33.940]
56670560.

[01:47:35.780 --> 01:47:39.380]
We're talking about living people, asshole obviously, which don't include you.

[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:41.480]
Just like that T-shirt that Moe is wearing on our website.

[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:42.020]
You love that.

[01:47:43.660 --> 01:47:45.180]
What makes you think that I'm still alive?

[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.040]
Now, it says homestead on 9, but you know it's not.

[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:47.920]
Here's homestead.

[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:48.140]
Hello?

[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.520]
Hey, where's the Henry's?

[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:50.000]
That's him.

[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.320]
Show it up.

[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:54.160]
Here's the call from Miami.

[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:54.440]
Hello?

[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:55.500]
Hey, Neil.

[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:58.480]
How did George Rill do on Saturday morning with a 299 bouquet?

[01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:01.760]
Oh.

[01:48:02.540 --> 01:48:03.740]
I hear you had a big number.

[01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.860]
That's the room around the building.

[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:09.400]
Boy, I'm Tonya.

[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:11.520]
I think we got it down to a science now.

[01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:12.720]
We've really got it made in the shade.

[01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:15.900]
Don't you feel like we got it rolling?

[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:17.080]
I feel something.

[01:48:18.300 --> 01:48:20.320]
I'll probably die rea coming on.

[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:21.980]
So Michael Morris kicking it up.

[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:22.360]
See that.

[01:48:22.620 --> 01:48:24.140]
Bummers already tied with Bush now.

[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:24.800]
28 of peace.

[01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.340]
They'll go by.

[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.480]
They'll go by no sweat.

[01:48:28.300 --> 01:48:30.960]
12 minutes past noon at 560WQM.

[01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:32.220]
Now you've been hearing about laminets.

[01:48:32.300 --> 01:48:34.240]
And now laminated wood flooring from laminets.

[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:37.280]
The easy, the smart, the low maintenance alternative

[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:38.440]
to natural wood flooring.

[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:39.040]
Am I right?

[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:39.400]
Yes.

[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.520]
Laminets are the best place to find laminated wood flooring from

[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.180]
Peridot, Perador, Pergo, Wilson R, Unifloor, and Quick Step 2.

[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:49.320]
They got all the top names all installed by Pergo, certified in stars.

[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:51.960]
Here's another reason why I'd be calling laminets a rust right now.

[01:48:52.040 --> 01:48:54.180]
The prices will positively floore you.

[01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.360]
Right now you can get there some are special for just $1995.

[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:58.180]
That's correct.

[01:48:58.180 --> 01:49:03.820]
Just $1995 gets you up to 380 square feet of beautiful laminated wood flooring.

[01:49:04.600 --> 01:49:05.040]
Unbelievable.

[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.260]
And laminets are rustable mats.

[01:49:06.440 --> 01:49:07.820]

[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:46.360]

[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:50.900]
The Rogers R Sports Hole Radio WQAN.

[01:49:55.060 --> 01:50:00.360]
What light presents real American heroes?

[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:03.000]
We are American heroes.

[01:50:03.700 --> 01:50:07.860]
Today we salute you, Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.300]
Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.260]
It's a filthy job.

[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:15.460]
And no one wants to do it except you.

[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.780]
And you're not afraid to get your hands dirty.

[01:50:20.580 --> 01:50:23.920]
You Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:25.780]
Drive a big brown truck.

[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:28.480]
But you're not delivering anything.

[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.240]
You were taking it away.

[01:50:31.580 --> 01:50:35.680]
Because when the septic system starts to back up.

[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:40.020]
You back up your truck.

[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:42.520]
You whip out that big old hose.

[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.960]
Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:49.180]
And suck, suck, suck that malodorous gravy.

[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.380]
But you're not done yet.

[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:55.900]
It's time to grab that long handled shovel scraper thingy.

[01:50:56.260 --> 01:50:59.140]
And make sure nothing gets lefty high.

[01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:00.560]
Scream that pool.

[01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:04.920]
Thank you, Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:51:05.220 --> 01:51:12.780]
For changing that giant 1200 gallon diaper that's buried six inches below the lawn in the backyard.

[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:14.820]
It's a crappy job.

[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:22.100]
So crack a cold butt like and pinch of toes to Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.100]
A real American hero.

[01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.580]
Mr. Septic Tank Sucker Otter.

[01:51:28.900 --> 01:51:31.640]
And Heiser Flush, St. Paul's Missouri.

[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:35.780]
From 17 to 560 WQM, the highly rated QAM, as we're back.

[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:36.400]
We're back.

[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.520]
We were dying over here and you know who's responsible.

[01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.140]
Absolutely.

[01:51:40.140 --> 01:51:43.240]
But nonetheless, so we got Farrahl, put his back on the mat.

[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:46.500]
And George, here's a fact from Matt who said,

[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:48.320]
and what does this call from Baltimore, Maryland?

[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:49.380]
Can that be for real? Hello?

[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:50.560]
And Neil.

[01:51:50.960 --> 01:51:51.340]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:51.960 --> 01:51:53.840]
How about John McCain on your pole?

[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.380]
How about him?

[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.040]
Vietnam prisoner of law.

[01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:58.700]
Shouldn't he be up there?

[01:51:59.040 --> 01:51:59.800]
Sounds good to me.

[01:51:59.940 --> 01:52:01.300]
Nope. No sweaties on there right now.

[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:02.080]
I just wrote it down.

[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.900]
All right. I got one more for you.

[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.040]
Jeff Rimmer.

[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.280]
Oh, you were doing so well.

[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:09.660]
He's from Baltimore.

[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:10.720]
Rimmer used to work in Baltimore.

[01:52:10.820 --> 01:52:11.560]
Where does somebody like him?

[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:16.300]
Uh, anyway, hey, Neil saw bowling for Columbine last night.

[01:52:16.300 --> 01:52:17.380]
Says Matt and loved it.

[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:19.720]
Chuck Heston looked about his young as Mohawar Davided.

[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.920]
Do you son of a bitch?

[01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:24.440]
The way Heston's scampered away after the mood looked like pulling his gun

[01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:27.700]
from his cold dead hands won't be in the distant future.

[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:28.880]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:29.720]
Also a request.

[01:52:29.900 --> 01:52:32.260]
I loved it a bit with a Humper interviewing a baseball player, Jack Clark,

[01:52:32.260 --> 01:52:34.820]
and he thinks that somebody else, the player keeps having me correct him.

[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.020]
Oh, that's bad, Matt.

[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:37.440]
That's bad.

[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:39.180]
We don't want to be piling on today, do we?

[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.020]
No. No. No. No.

[01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:43.580]
Not when Hank had a big book or tram, whatever it is.

[01:52:43.720 --> 01:52:45.740]
Here's one that says I saw bowling when it first came out

[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:49.680]
and I'm ecstatic that it's gotten and still getting all the great recognition.

[01:52:49.900 --> 01:52:53.160]
However, as much as I like Michael Moore, I had to vote for Gorf Adal.

[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.320]
Well, I sure have no problem with that.

[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:56.320]
Don't forget we got John McKing going on there.

[01:52:56.460 --> 01:52:56.920]
Not Jeff Rimmer.

[01:52:58.180 --> 01:53:03.020]
The man who wrote live from Galgata and Bird deserves his own memorial on the Mall in DC.

[01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:04.640]
Not to forget my rebrechenrage.

[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:08.740]
PS, what's the address that the plates for pause website?

[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.340]
Did you write it down?

[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:11.980]
I did. I hope I got it right.

[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:13.640]
It was easy.

[01:53:14.540 --> 01:53:15.460]
I see you!

[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:16.560]
Yeah.

[01:53:20.380 --> 01:53:20.840]

[01:53:23.820 --> 01:53:24.260]

Okay. So let's see.

[01:53:26.060 --> 01:53:28.180]
We got the...how's the...Gorvid Al doing?

[01:53:28.380 --> 01:53:30.560]
Michael Moore, 69.89.

[01:53:31.140 --> 01:53:31.840]
Excuse me.

[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:34.040]
Bill Clinton, like I predicted, 36.

[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.900]
He's edge-to-head, but now a bush has got 35.

[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.760]
That's where the battle lawns are drawn.

[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:42.360]
Arnold Schwarzenegger's got 17, and we still don't know why.

[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.500]
You son of a bitch.

[01:53:43.740 --> 01:53:44.720]
Ralph Nader 16.

[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.000]
Molly Ivan's 6.

[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:47.080]
Bill Marr 5.

[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:48.700]
And I still will never know why.

[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:49.880]
What a piece of crap.

[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:51.100]
Martin Sheen 4.

[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:52.100]
Marine Dow 3.

[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:53.140]
Bobby Graham 3.

[01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:54.320]
Tim Robbins appear.

[01:53:55.560 --> 01:53:56.360]
Gorf Adal appear.

[01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:57.180]
Warren Vadey 1.

[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.520]
And Katrina Vanden Hovel don't have none yet.

[01:53:59.860 --> 01:54:00.820]
Out of 219 votes.

[01:54:02.600 --> 01:54:03.600]
So that's where we are.

[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.680]
What an amazing day, don't you think?

[01:54:07.260 --> 01:54:07.900]
That's a good day.

[01:54:08.160 --> 01:54:09.460]
I mean, I predicted it was going to be good.

[01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.340]
Did I tell you before the show today that I thought that Ferels...

[01:54:12.340 --> 01:54:14.380]
His impact would start kicking in with this trend.

[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:15.040]
Did I say that?

[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.340]
I had my thumb right on it and show enough.

[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:19.720]
Now if we could just show up at 5 to 8 a.m.

[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:21.040]
Can you even begin to imagine?

[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:21.800]
Oh, hello.

[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.360]
We could be like number one half.

[01:54:23.860 --> 01:54:24.600]
Be like the old days.

[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.080]
But that would be like showing off, you know.

[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:27.560]
Here's for Lauderdale.

[01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:27.840]
Hello.

[01:54:28.660 --> 01:54:29.360]
Yeah, hello Neil.

[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.120]
Yes, sir.

[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:31.400]
Yeah, ma'am.

[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.420]
Yes, ma'am.

[01:54:32.700 --> 01:54:36.860]
You were talking about Lauderdale being on TV a few years ago.

[01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:37.320]
Right.

[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:37.900]
And it was like failure.

[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:41.620]
Well, you know, he's going to be back on again this football season.

[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.640]
Like Dennis Miller was on Monday night football.

[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:45.280]
Right.

[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:48.780]
He's going to be doing like the pregame show I think on his team.

[01:54:48.780 --> 01:54:49.460]
And he has parents, right.

[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.600]
And I'm sure he'll be just as successful as Dennis Miller.

[01:54:52.060 --> 01:54:52.820]
Yeah, I'm sure.

[01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:57.080]
And then he'll be doing those TV commercials for the satellite dish next year.

[01:54:57.840 --> 01:54:58.040]
Right.

[01:54:58.220 --> 01:54:58.880]
Dennis Miller's doing it.

[01:54:58.880 --> 01:54:59.200]
Exactly.

[01:54:59.200 --> 01:54:59.620]
Right.

[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:03.160]
I mean, I didn't be saying paper or plastic the year after that.

[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.400]
Well, I just didn't know if you knew that.

[01:55:05.540 --> 01:55:09.120]
I mean, I'm going to every Sunday when I turn on the football, I'll have to turn it off whenever

[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:09.340]
you come.

[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:13.460]
My team, my TV is already programmed to tune that out automatic.

[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:14.540]
Oh, okay.

[01:55:14.620 --> 01:55:15.700]
I'll figure out how to do that.

[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:16.500]
Okay.

[01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:16.900]
Okay.

[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:17.240]
Bye.

[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:17.580]
Thanks.

[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.280]
Yeah, Lauren asked me.

[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:22.220]
Of course, I was referring to like, you know, having your own show of things like that.

[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.080]
But that's a good point.

[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.380]
He is making a comeback on TV.

[01:55:24.740 --> 01:55:25.940]
It'll blow up on your face.

[01:55:26.340 --> 01:55:29.860]
Because anybody to the left of a till of the hunt, that'll be a good excuse not to watch that.

[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.920]
Because it's not the game.

[01:55:30.940 --> 01:55:34.460]
It's just, you know, we have a choice of several pregame, all these other shows that are on.

[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:34.960]
Right, George?

[01:55:35.340 --> 01:55:36.060]
Oh, yeah.

[01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:40.100]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the eighth.

[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.440]
Oh, I don't want to forget this story.

[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:44.500]
I feel like we're under such pressure today, you know.

[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:45.000]
Oh, relax.

[01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:46.260]
Kick back.

[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:47.140]
Okay.

[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:49.840]
How much has fall right out of the chair?

[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:50.960]
I'll kick back so far.

[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:53.700]
Midnight came and went, but the rock did not rule.

[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:55.300]
It says in the New York Times.

[01:55:56.040 --> 01:56:05.980]
By 12 a.m. this morning, Chief Justice Roy Moore of Alabama was to have removed the 5,280 pound monument of the 10 commandments that he secretly had installed one night in the lobby of the

[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:07.840]
Alabama State Supreme Court.

[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:13.840]
A federal judge ruled that the granite block known as Roy's Rock, violated the separation of church and state.

[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:15.560]
But Justice Moore didn't budge.

[01:56:16.340 --> 01:56:17.960]
And he had a lot of pimple right behind him.

[01:56:17.980 --> 01:56:22.720]
His monument has been like a magnet for Christian advocates, and his tonight were on his power seem to increase.

[01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:29.680]
As the clock struck 12, the crowd assembled in front of the courthouse burst into God bless America.

[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:46.140]
The muggy plaza was clogged with dozens of little girls wearing Jesus t-shirts, bearded men with thick arms and Confederate flags on her backs, black people, white people, young old in between a man who walked from Texas dressed in a monk's frock, another who drove from San Diego when a red truck with a sign that said, shame on America.

[01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:52.240]
They were here to make sure that when the deadline elapsed, no federal officer stormed the courthouse and wheeled away that monument.

[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:58.700]
Some earlier on Wednesday, it even been arrested, including 66 year old Karen Kennedy was handcuffed in her wheelchair.

[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:03.200]
Oh! My midnight Mrs. Ken Miss Kennedy was back in a hero.

[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:07.200]
Let's hear it for this woman, Yelder-Reveren Pat Mahoney, director of the Christian Defense Coalition.

[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.020]
That's where I had Miss Kennedy said from the courthouse, I was cuffed for God.

[01:57:11.220 --> 01:57:11.900]
Ew, God.

[01:57:12.060 --> 01:57:15.940]
If that isn't one of the greatest lines in the history of mankind, I was cuffed for God.

[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.260]
Justice Moore was nowhere to be seen on Wednesday. He had said if they want to get the commandments, they're going to have to get me first.

[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:25.960]
Supporters are now calling him the Moses of Alabama.

[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:34.280]
But there may not be any apocalyptic finish federal officials decided that finds and not force are the best way to deal with the monument.

[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:46.940]
On Wednesday, Justice Moore lost a last appeal to the Supreme Court, hurdling him head on into a conflict with a federal judge who was threatened to make him pay $5,000 for every day that the 10 commandments remain in public view.

[01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:57.300]
The tractors say the whole thing smells like Alabama's obstinacy of yesterday of the lost battles for states rights and the 60s, aka being a bunch of racist assholes.

[01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:00.380]
How do you like that? Assholes.

[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:08.640]
And of course, Chuck Heston and that interview with the Michael Moore shows his true color as in lily white man, what an ass.

[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:15.980]
Michael Moore keeps pressing him on the issue of why there's so much more violence in America than saying Canada, they're right next to each other.

[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:19.660]
And Chuck Heston comes out, well, America's got a long history of violence.

[01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:26.680]
And of course, we have this racially diverse and ethnically diverse rights, pixel spooks, that's what I think they do.

[01:58:26.680 --> 01:58:30.680]
Right, that's right. Spixion spooks, they're doing all the shootings, all the killings, everyone's you can't trust.

[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:32.200]
Hopefully he's trying to say.

[01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:39.180]
And of course, can you imagine any place more diverse than where my ass is sent right now than Toronto?

[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:41.360]
No, I can't. We got them all.

[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:43.520]
And we got swimming in a sea of violence.

[02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:17.260]
Bubba is almost 20 votes ahead of W right now.

[02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:18.220]
60 to 41.

[02:10:18.800 --> 02:10:20.640]
And he was unlike a very ass-ing.

[02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:22.760]
You know, just minutes ago.

[02:10:24.420 --> 02:10:26.000]
No more contenderate W.

[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:27.220]
I'm telling you right now.

[02:10:27.340 --> 02:10:28.000]
You can take this to the table.

[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:28.400]
You can take this to the bank.

[02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:30.300]
Whoever the Democrats run.

[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.380]
Unless it's, and the good news is,

[02:10:32.480 --> 02:10:34.540]
Julie, who has been falling off the face of the mat.

[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:38.640]
The only reason he was getting any support before in the polls

[02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:42.260]
was because most people are so stupid that most Americans didn't,

[02:10:42.420 --> 02:10:45.320]
it was the only name that they knew because he ran for a VP with Gore.

[02:10:45.820 --> 02:10:46.540]
So they knew the name.

[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:47.600]
Right.

[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.300]
In fact, in bowling for a collarbiner,

[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:52.040]
shown clips where he's going out about Maryland,

[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.100]
Manson, and about the video gave off.

[02:10:54.100 --> 02:10:57.180]
This man, he is a disaster.

[02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:58.280]
I think you're wrong.

[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.380]
He makes me want to put on my foreskin again.

[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.340]
That's how embarrassed I am about him.

[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.080]
Why me and Wimpy and right wing and pop-pantificating

[02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:10.300]
and a worse sucking piece of crap, Jew Lieberman.

[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:11.020]
Hoi!

[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.100]
Hats a hoist, Joe.

[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:13.320]
You jackass.

[02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.120]
But anyway, that's a good news.

[02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.140]
He's falling off the face.

[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:17.240]
And he has no chance.

[02:11:17.740 --> 02:11:18.180]
No chance.

[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:21.180]
He couldn't win a fixed election if he was the only candidate.

[02:11:23.100 --> 02:11:23.900]
Twenty to one.

[02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:25.360]
We got that gigantic one or two hour.

[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:26.340]
Not any time to since.

[02:11:26.420 --> 02:11:28.680]
Now that I know the kids are going back to school on next week.

[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:29.320]
Mm-hmm.

[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:30.000]
Inbroward.

[02:11:30.140 --> 02:11:32.720]
See, that's a good, I mean, now is like the last gasp.

[02:11:32.720 --> 02:11:34.020]
So there's nobody there, right?

[02:11:34.420 --> 02:11:34.420]

[02:11:35.080 --> 02:11:36.780]
They'll become, they'll be crawling back in on a week.

[02:11:36.900 --> 02:11:38.540]
They don't have a choice, but to come back.

[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:39.180]
Exactly.

[02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.760]
Hey, the top Asian buffet in the universe.

[02:11:41.960 --> 02:11:43.820]
It's the air-milk coast three locations for it.

[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:44.400]
They're in sunrise.

[02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:45.420]
They're in North Miami Beach.

[02:11:45.420 --> 02:11:47.120]
And now a new one in Pembert Pines.

[02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:48.360]
You start out there.

[02:11:48.540 --> 02:11:49.800]
Or if you prefer, I mean, you can,

[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:51.680]
how do you attack the buffet at the animal coast?

[02:11:52.160 --> 02:11:52.580]
AARGH!

[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.980]
Do you have any idea how loud that one?

[02:11:57.120 --> 02:11:57.780]
No, not really.

[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:02.880]
Have you got any clue how screeching?

[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:06.020]
Almost put me right off the goddamn chair.

[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:07.260]
AARGH!

[02:12:07.460 --> 02:12:08.480]
Like that, just like that.

[02:12:09.860 --> 02:12:11.680]
Start your mouth auto eating your experience.

[02:12:11.940 --> 02:12:13.620]
Whatever it is, what's six different kinds of soups?

[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.660]
In fact, you ought to be gargling with wonton right now.

[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.500]
You want an idiot.

[02:12:17.760 --> 02:12:19.720]
Like I said, hot and sour and wonton.

[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.560]
And egg drop and all kinds of good stuff.

[02:12:21.900 --> 02:12:24.660]
And then they got zillions of succulent entrees.

[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:25.560]
BOT THIRD MAN!

[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.680]
A buffet, the likes of which you won't find anywhere.

[02:12:27.820 --> 02:12:29.620]
I mean, there's a lot of a phaser about, but nothing like this.

[02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:30.860]
It's humongous.

[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:31.500]
It's gigantic.

[02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:33.720]
Be sure to make a pit stop at the gourmet center

[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.980]
with the sizzling Asian grill featuring New York strip made of your order.

[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.180]
They got grilled shrimp scampi style.

[02:12:39.580 --> 02:12:42.180]
Jumbo scallops wrapped in bacon and the new seafood saying Jacques.

[02:12:42.780 --> 02:12:44.860]
They've got dunginess crab and ginger and scallions.

[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:47.520]
Hand-carb-prime rib again cooked to order the way you like it.

[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:48.620]
Oriental chicken salad.

[02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:50.520]
And you'll never walk out of the ammo coast with the headache

[02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:52.200]
because they don't use any crap.

[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:53.620]
No MSG, no cornstarch.

[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:56.980]
And they cook all their fine stuff only with cholesterol for your oils too.

[02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:00.440]
There were faith features of full salad bar, a sushi bar, a fresh room cocktail.

[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:04.080]
And if you have that crow bar to make a little room in your pants at the end of the meal,

[02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:06.240]
there's a dessert bar that'll knock your pants off.

[02:13:06.420 --> 02:13:11.180]
Featuring pies, cakes, pastries, ice cream with all your favorite toppings and fresh fruit as well.

[02:13:11.660 --> 02:13:13.880]
You'll find them in sunrise on Pine Island or Forty-fourth Street.

[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:16.560]
Collins Avenue just north of 163rd North Miami Beach.

[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:20.580]
And also Emerald Coast is at the intersection of flamingo and pembera groves in Pembera Pines.

[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:23.220]
Take the whole family, book your next business luncheon right now.

[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:24.680]
All-size parties be welcome.

[02:13:25.060 --> 02:13:26.960]
Let them do the cooking for you at Emerald Coast buffet.

[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:29.140]
Takeout and delivery always available too.

[02:13:29.280 --> 02:13:31.880]
Call 9-5-4-572-3822.

[02:13:33.200 --> 02:13:37.320]
9-5-4-572-3822 for a real pig out your love.

[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:39.060]
It's the Emerald Coast Chinese buffet.

Take a breath before you say it.

[02:36:38.460 --> 02:36:40.320]

[02:36:40.900 --> 02:36:44.140]

You call that music?

[02:36:48.300 --> 02:36:49.660]
Is that a great idea that came in?

[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:01.260]
The Cuban board cruise died last month from a brain tumor.

[02:37:01.620 --> 02:37:03.060]
She was 77.

[02:37:03.660 --> 02:37:05.220]
But we sure remember her on this show.

[02:37:07.040 --> 02:37:07.840]
As in...

[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:09.560]
Quanta n'amera...

[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:11.400]
Could she sing?

[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:12.340]
No. Or what?

[02:37:12.980 --> 02:37:13.800]
Was she hot looking?

[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:14.100]
No.

[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:15.520]
Or what? For a guy, I guess.

[02:37:16.220 --> 02:37:17.000]
For a drag queen.

[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.060]
Club minutes after one.

[02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:19.380]
Don't be picking on Celia Cruz anymore.

[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:22.140]
You'll piss off all those all your good friends, all your pizons.

[02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:25.860]

Five and a local,

this is five-city.

[02:38:48.840 --> 02:38:50.180]
The radio's on yours now.

[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:52.140]
A few in.

[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:03.400]
Back in the day when someone done a strong

[02:39:04.200 --> 02:39:06.960]
we didn't take their crap.

[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:10.780]
In Pearl Harbor, when the jabs dropped their bombs,

[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:13.560]
we bombed them bad.

[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:17.260]
And now the Saudis, they hit us hard.

[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:20.380]
And on our cards are little flags waving.

[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:27.320]
As that Saudi love and retard voice of bombers the wrong way.

[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:34.140]
And oven barrows to be in America

[02:39:34.140 --> 02:39:37.760]
where they follow books like cheese.

[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:41.080]
The United States of arrogance

[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:43.480]
and by push and its family

[02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:45.400]
breathing of this country.

[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:50.920]
Up, have the length or through darkest days in our history.

[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:54.980]
I don't want to be a tax America.

[02:39:57.300 --> 02:39:59.360]
In the goddamn USA.

[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:08.080]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:10.840]
Stop living in the past.

[02:40:11.600 --> 02:40:15.140]
If you want that SUV to drive,

[02:40:15.840 --> 02:40:17.720]
you're gonna need more gas.

[02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:22.200]
If slug racists come to read in the world,

[02:40:22.660 --> 02:40:24.300]
they train us to believe.

[02:40:25.420 --> 02:40:28.480]
And anyone who says that obviously

[02:40:29.500 --> 02:40:32.660]
is a force to be.

[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:38.520]
And oven barrows to be in America

[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:41.400]
where we date triologically.

[02:40:42.480 --> 02:40:45.740]
We've a flag in one hand with our head in the sand

[02:40:45.740 --> 02:40:49.640]
and blindly follow the powers that we have authentic.

[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:55.680]
Up, washing state produce on a 65 inch screen.

[02:40:55.680 --> 02:40:59.800]
Scratch your balls and fight everything's okay.

[02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.780]
In the goddamn USA.

[02:41:05.420 --> 02:41:06.640]
Don't let's mark them.

[02:41:18.820 --> 02:41:21.980]
You have sex and do not care.

[02:41:22.980 --> 02:41:25.900]
All our disease down there.

[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:29.260]
Ooh, it makes you wanna cry.

[02:41:30.820 --> 02:41:33.740]
Don't know from who it came.

[02:41:34.300 --> 02:41:37.280]
This itching drive, you insane.

[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:41.260]
Ooh, it makes you wanna die.

[02:41:43.980 --> 02:41:46.920]
Ooh, should have used the condom.

[02:41:49.420 --> 02:41:53.920]
Cause now you've got this problem.

[02:41:54.740 --> 02:42:00.600]
Gonna read your weapon I get you.

[02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:05.760]
Go insane, you're out of your mind.

[02:42:06.660 --> 02:42:11.220]
Ooh, what a cheater of my real.

[02:42:13.300 --> 02:42:18.500]
Too many want a nice dance.

[02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:29.980]
Yeah, we're having trouble with some terrorists

[02:42:29.980 --> 02:42:33.440]
that come into our land.

[02:42:33.940 --> 02:42:37.240]
They got a bomb with a brand new twist.

[02:42:38.240 --> 02:42:40.180]
And so we got a plan.

[02:42:41.100 --> 02:42:44.440]
Pick up the phone, the FBI's home.

[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:46.480]
A call to CIA.

[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:50.120]
Just wait, not one one.

[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:51.640]
Get it done.

[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:54.360]
Put these gum back away.

[02:42:56.020 --> 02:42:58.800]
Dirted bones made by grapes.

[02:42:59.560 --> 02:43:02.080]
Dirted bones made dirty.

[02:43:02.800 --> 02:43:06.020]
Dirted bones find these grapes.

[02:43:06.020 --> 02:43:10.000]
Dirted bones and the made by creeps.

[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:14.020]
Dirted bones made by dirty creeps.

[02:43:14.020 --> 02:43:18.920]
Gas chamber, lethal injection, firing squad.

[02:43:19.160 --> 02:43:24.020]
Get these grapes and strap them in electric chair.

[02:43:24.680 --> 02:43:27.380]
I know, kids, get these grapes.

[02:43:27.620 --> 02:43:30.680]
Their songs provided the soundtrack for a whole generation.

[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:34.040]
And now they're finding a whole new audience with a CD

[02:43:34.040 --> 02:43:38.200]
that doesn't sound a whole lot like anything they've ever done before.

[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:42.740]
It's the best of crossbees, stills, and cash.

[02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:45.660]
Oh, and you know we're riding.

[02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:50.000]
On the America's express.

[02:43:50.540 --> 02:43:52.220]
Experience, a javu.

[02:43:52.520 --> 02:43:55.900]
All over again, when crossbees, stills, and cash

[02:43:55.900 --> 02:43:59.020]
unveil a whole different take on this classic tune.

[02:43:59.220 --> 02:44:02.280]
All houses are very, very, very fun house.

[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:06.680]
With two caps in the yard.

[02:44:07.080 --> 02:44:12.020]
It's a CD jam packed with all the songs you want to teach your children.

[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:15.900]
Mike, I am yours.

[02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:20.560]
You are mine.

[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:25.600]
Yo, I'm Johnny Cash, because we stills and cash.

[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:29.500]
You know we used to sing like a couple of boys named Sue.

[02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:35.360]
But now the cash registers winging, because we're singing in a whole new register.

[02:44:35.980 --> 02:44:37.720]
You are what you are.

[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:40.160]
As you make it hard.

[02:44:40.740 --> 02:44:43.540]
The best of crossbees, stills, and cash.

[02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:48.040]
Walk the line, straight to your local record store, and pick up a copy today.

[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:56.260]
Tonight on Fox, it's Cox, America and I believe in you.

[02:44:56.260 --> 02:44:58.440]
I'm Officer Simon Carl.

[02:44:59.020 --> 02:45:01.520]
Right now we're responding to the sort of better call.

[02:45:02.060 --> 02:45:04.180]
We're looking for a suspect named Corey Carl.

[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:05.560]
There he is.

[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:08.460]
Corey Carl, hold it right there.

[02:45:08.860 --> 02:45:13.240]
You're under arrest for hitting your sister, and for hitting a few sour notes.

[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:15.600]
You have the right to remain silent.

[02:45:15.980 --> 02:45:19.600]
Based on your last performance, I only wish you'd exercise that one more often.

[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:20.780]
It was awful.

[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:25.300]
You have the right to consult an attorney or in your case, a vocal coach.

[02:45:25.300 --> 02:45:27.000]
But I can't afford a lawyer.

[02:45:27.460 --> 02:45:29.660]
Well then, an attorney will be appointed for you.

[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:32.900]
Perhaps Jared Andrews or Trinese could recommend someone.

[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:36.420]
It's Cox, American Idol Edition.

[02:45:36.820 --> 02:45:37.820]
Join us next week.

[02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:42.200]
When Officer Carl gets a new partner, Officer Randy Jackson.

[02:45:42.680 --> 02:45:45.260]
Could you possibly hit more down that wall?

[02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:46.180]
Oh, no.

[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:47.580]
Good, no.

[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:48.860]
I won't broke.

[02:45:49.180 --> 02:45:49.700]
Disgusting.

[02:45:50.380 --> 02:45:50.980]
Absolutely.

[02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:52.280]
Disgusting.

[02:45:55.520 --> 02:45:56.640]
Barry Manolo.

[02:45:57.060 --> 02:45:58.380]
He's had a ton of hits.

[02:45:58.820 --> 02:46:02.940]
But none as painful as the one he took when he walked into a wall and broke his nose.

[02:46:03.460 --> 02:46:03.820]
Ow!

[02:46:04.280 --> 02:46:07.440]
And now, Barry's saying about it in his brand new CD.

[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:09.240]
Can't smell without you.

[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:12.940]
With fractured versions of Barry's hits like Ko-Fa-Kavanaugh.

[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:15.360]
I broke my, broke my banana.

[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:19.780]
And now it's the size of her banana.

[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:23.360]
As well as a re-nastred and really nasally version of Mandy.

[02:46:23.360 --> 02:46:25.280]
Recorded at the moment of impact.

[02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:26.880]
Oh, damn it.

[02:46:27.580 --> 02:46:30.720]
My nose hit the wall now and taking.

[02:46:31.260 --> 02:46:32.200]
But that's not all.

[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:34.700]
Barry Manolo's can't smell without you.

[02:46:34.920 --> 02:46:36.120]
Is swollen with hits.

[02:46:36.280 --> 02:46:37.880]
You nose and love.

[02:46:38.300 --> 02:46:40.020]
Like, I break the schnauz.

[02:46:40.380 --> 02:46:41.640]
I made it through the pain.

[02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.360]
Looks like I broke it.

[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.300]
And a title track with Barry's trademark hook.

[02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:51.060]
You know, I can't smell without you.

[02:46:51.060 --> 02:46:55.520]
I can't breathe without you.

[02:46:55.780 --> 02:46:57.440]
I can't sniff.

[02:46:58.040 --> 02:46:59.640]
And I can't think.

[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:01.980]
It looks like my face.

[02:47:02.500 --> 02:47:03.800]
Was hit with a prick.

[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:06.260]
Barry Manolo's can't smell without you.

[02:47:06.720 --> 02:47:08.100]
Walk into a wall mark.

[02:47:08.520 --> 02:47:09.000]
Ow!

[02:47:09.760 --> 02:47:11.040]
And pick up a copy today.

[02:47:11.700 --> 02:47:12.180]
No thanks.

[02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:14.060]
126 at 560 WQM.

[02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:16.420]
Who, uh, which, uh, who's?

[02:47:17.160 --> 02:47:20.520]
Which of these American political or entertainment figures do you admire the most?

[02:47:20.520 --> 02:47:23.540]
Michael Moore, 111, but Mike's got a battle on his hands now.

[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:23.980]
You see this?

[02:47:28.020 --> 02:47:28.860]
You see this?

[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:29.860]
See that?

[02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:31.600]
Bill Clinton, 102.

[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:33.740]
I think Bubba's going to win it.

[02:47:34.460 --> 02:47:34.760]
That's open.

[02:47:35.360 --> 02:47:38.560]
George W. 48, Arnold Schwarzenegger, 28.

[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:39.680]
Oh my goodness.

[02:47:40.280 --> 02:47:40.900]
How embarrassing.

[02:47:41.220 --> 02:47:41.800]
And humiliating.

[02:47:42.340 --> 02:47:43.720]
Uh, Ralph Nader, 19.

[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:45.100]
None of the above 14.

[02:47:45.100 --> 02:47:46.520]
See, I told you that's going to go big.

[02:47:46.940 --> 02:47:47.760]
John McCain, 11.

[02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:48.780]
Groove it all, 9.

[02:47:49.080 --> 02:47:49.800]
Bob Graham, 8.

[02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:51.080]
Bill Meyer, 8.

[02:47:52.100 --> 02:47:53.740]
Molly Ivans, uh, which he got.

[02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:54.220]
8.

[02:47:55.940 --> 02:47:57.360]
Uh, what's her name?

[02:47:57.540 --> 02:47:59.180]
Katrina Van Den Hovels, God's 7.

[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:01.320]
And by the way, George didn't say he never heard of the nation.

[02:48:01.320 --> 02:48:02.440]
He said he never heard of Katrina.

[02:48:02.800 --> 02:48:05.000]
Whoever factored the nation here, I just don't read the credits.

[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:08.520]
Maureen Dowd, 6th, Martin Sheen 5th.

[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:09.640]
Swilory's got only 3.

[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:10.200]
Tim Robinson.

[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:13.380]
And Warren Baties got 1, but it's a big, healthy one.

[02:48:14.800 --> 02:48:16.520]
127 at 560 WQM.

[02:48:16.580 --> 02:48:17.860]
If you want to see the best and horse race,

[02:48:17.860 --> 02:48:18.340]
I'm all casting.

[02:48:18.420 --> 02:48:19.500]
Here's the place to do it.

[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:20.200]
Pump it up.

[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:21.020]
Park, harness track.

[02:48:21.540 --> 02:48:21.920]
Pump it up.

[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.540]
Park is open every day of your life.

[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:26.340]
Seven days and nights a week featuring the best in harness,

[02:48:26.580 --> 02:48:29.540]
Thoroughbred and Highlight action from all across North America for you to watch.

[02:48:29.580 --> 02:48:32.800]
And of course, plunge your gut sign and general parking and admission in

full-course dinner package for only 5.95.

or get yourself a private box seat with your own TV monitor for just 2.5 bucks.

[02:48:48.780 --> 02:48:51.120]
And it's all done in a smoke-free environment too.

[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:54.060]
Pompidopark, where the action is waiting for, even though we don't have any

[02:48:54.060 --> 02:48:56.740]
live racing going on during the summer months, this year we got lots of

[02:48:56.740 --> 02:48:58.620]
cymbal casting every single day.

[02:48:59.020 --> 02:49:01.720]
Pompidopark is a block south of Atlantic Boulevard on Powerline Road.

[02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:07.980]
For daily cymbal casting race schedule, call 954-972-2000 or go on the

[02:49:07.980 --> 02:49:10.320]
web and check them out at Pompidopark.com.

[02:49:10.680 --> 02:49:16.340]
My name is Neil Lauer, a near-sports radio five-seater, UAM.

[02:49:21.180 --> 02:49:24.120]
Welcome back to the glittering pageantry of the Mohawada Navy

[02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:24.500]
the show.

[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:26.000]
We have a full duck today.

[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:30.700]
Including the cavalcade of our articulate, ethalete of views.

[02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:33.040]
You know that pipe smoke is still at it.

[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:33.440]
Why?

[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:36.340]
Why, why, singing those songs? Make it fun on me.

[02:49:36.780 --> 02:49:38.460]
They make fun on me all the time.

[02:49:38.780 --> 02:49:41.820]
I don't know why they don't adore me.

[02:49:41.900 --> 02:49:43.740]
They're there, everything will be alright, no?

[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:45.900]
Get your hands off me, a fairy.

[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:48.000]
You're queer, yet tome jumper.

[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:50.860]
Real men don't touch, only during the game.

[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:51.880]
Yes, master.

[02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:54.280]
They won't sing, and I'll give them singing.

[02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:55.380]
Get on a piano.

[02:49:55.860 --> 02:49:56.200]
Over there.

[02:49:56.480 --> 02:49:56.960]
Okay, Mell.

[02:49:57.180 --> 02:49:58.360]
Now, hit it.

[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:03.220]
Back in my day, men was straight.

[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:06.320]
The end day is too day.

[02:50:07.360 --> 02:50:09.720]
That's why I can't tolerate.

[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:13.500]
This goes with days.

[02:50:14.480 --> 02:50:16.980]
Spoiled, learned day, back day.

[02:50:34.220 --> 02:50:35.560]
Stop it, you moron.

[02:50:35.720 --> 02:50:36.480]
What's the matter, Mell?

[02:50:36.760 --> 02:50:37.800]
My wings fell off again.

[02:50:38.460 --> 02:50:38.980]
Okay.

[02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:40.360]
Alright, where were we?

[02:50:40.860 --> 02:50:42.840]
Sporthole, Laurence, and Adder.

[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:44.240]
I'll take it from here.

[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:47.400]
The guys that like to worship men.

[02:50:48.680 --> 02:50:51.720]
Good thing we won't see Paul in your way,

[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:53.240]
in the battle again.

[02:50:55.420 --> 02:50:57.900]
Didn't mean to soothbrush stayed.

[02:50:57.900 --> 02:51:02.920]
Or did it go hairy, Taint?

[02:51:03.380 --> 02:51:06.720]
Jesus Christ, I really hate.

[02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:13.600]
Jesus, God, when God is.

[02:51:17.540 --> 02:51:19.760]
Spreading like crazy.

[02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:24.000]
Spreading their charms.

[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:28.080]
Soon they'll be buried.

[02:51:29.940 --> 02:51:32.420]
And eaten by worms.

[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.660]
People don't come together.

[02:51:38.600 --> 02:51:41.060]
People they stay apart.

[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:45.600]
Nothing can stop it now.

[02:51:47.360 --> 02:51:49.940]
Because we are all scared of stars.

[02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:53.340]
Don't go to Asia.

[02:51:55.440 --> 02:51:57.280]
Don't go to Hong Kong.

[02:51:57.780 --> 02:51:58.180]
No!

[02:51:59.780 --> 02:52:01.600]
Still clear of Toronto.

[02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:06.000]
If you want to live long.

[02:52:08.300 --> 02:52:10.180]
People don't live forever.

[02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:14.260]
People must all depart.

[02:52:14.260 --> 02:52:19.400]
But no one wants it to happen now.

[02:52:20.760 --> 02:52:23.480]
That's why we are scared of stars.

[02:52:25.160 --> 02:52:27.000]
People don't come together.

[02:52:28.320 --> 02:52:28.900]
Sporthole?

[02:52:29.500 --> 02:52:31.360]
People they stay apart.

[02:52:34.260 --> 02:52:35.740]
Nothing can stop it now.

[02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:37.580]
First there was X-Men.

[02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:39.480]
Then X-Men 2.

[02:52:40.100 --> 02:52:42.420]
Now there's a new team of superheroes

[02:52:42.420 --> 02:52:45.000]
who are shouting out against evildoers.

[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:46.520]
Tourettesmen.

[02:52:46.660 --> 02:52:47.520]
Hold it right there.

[02:52:50.120 --> 02:52:52.320]
Tourettesmen, starring Patrick Stewart

[02:52:52.320 --> 02:52:53.780]
as their telepathic leader.

[02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:55.240]
I am Professor.

[02:52:55.660 --> 02:52:59.020]
And I can read your page.

[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:02.780]
I'm Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.

[02:53:03.040 --> 02:53:04.800]
I have retractable weapons.

[02:53:05.300 --> 02:53:07.560]
And a metal foot-in-no skeleton.

[02:53:08.160 --> 02:53:10.640]
And Halli Mary as Stutter.

[02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:13.060]
Stop it and this is your time of the law.

[02:53:14.060 --> 02:53:17.280]
Tourettesmen, they're fearsome, they're powerful.

[02:53:17.960 --> 02:53:20.060]
They're kind of embarrassing to be around.

[02:53:20.180 --> 02:53:23.120]
Thank you, Tourettesmen, for saving my life.

[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:23.760]
You're welcome.

[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:29.320]
Tourettesmen rated PG for...

[02:53:29.320 --> 02:53:31.960]
I filled my tank up.

[02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:34.600]
I was either now I'd be helping finance 9-11

[02:53:34.600 --> 02:53:37.640]
by giving money to Unicaul or Abacol and the Carlyle.

[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:39.020]
That's in my life, son.

[02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:42.440]
How's that an hour's paying James Baker's green things?

[02:53:42.740 --> 02:53:43.880]
I made two through today.

[02:53:44.300 --> 02:53:47.160]
How was I to know I was providing bathwater to the Middle East?

[02:53:47.600 --> 02:53:49.360]
Well, nothing's gonna happen again.

[02:53:49.740 --> 02:53:51.680]
Every time you light a marijuana cigarette,

[02:53:52.240 --> 02:53:54.240]
you're helping to finance running overloids.

[02:53:54.480 --> 02:53:57.620]
And breaking the law based on the old movie Refer madness.

[02:53:58.020 --> 02:53:59.800]
Better children are up.

[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.200]
Is the schedule of old man kind?

[02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:05.680]
I just spent every word joint.

[02:54:06.160 --> 02:54:08.420]
Now I'm white man, you know.

[02:54:08.800 --> 02:54:11.820]
For now I'm just out this window.

[02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:15.400]
This was a pay for by the community

[02:54:15.400 --> 02:54:17.180]
to keep a manor fit in the dark ages.

[02:54:19.880 --> 02:54:21.780]
You know, on CBS,

[02:54:22.480 --> 02:54:24.720]
Survivor, calmed out last season.

[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:26.700]
So when it continues, we never do safe

[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:28.860]
on production cost-proof reality show.

[02:54:28.860 --> 02:54:34.220]
CBS bring you Palestinian acidity with his e-cissom.

[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:38.700]
The rivalry in tune between Ahmed and Abadabadou.

[02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:44.340]
Oh, I cannot take this sand.

[02:54:45.080 --> 02:54:48.120]
If you win, you all can buy me sits best.

[02:54:48.700 --> 02:54:50.040]
And countdown continues.

[02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:53.440]
Ahmed is up for $500 in the standing timegown.

[02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:56.860]
Now, if we can beat the current record,

[02:54:56.860 --> 02:54:59.060]
he gets the grand prize.

[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:00.460]
Still not about it, can he?

[02:55:00.720 --> 02:55:02.220]
Excellent way to get your paradise.

[02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:06.500]
Were you staying permanently at Allah's paradise hotel?

[02:55:07.080 --> 02:55:10.400]
Now with table TV and impressed 17 pistol versions

[02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.960]

courtesy of the Saudi royal family,

[02:55:15.540 --> 02:55:17.620]
America's most trusted and valued friend.

[02:55:18.020 --> 02:55:18.840]
Back to you, baby.

[02:55:19.460 --> 02:55:20.780]
Don't stop now, Ahmed.

[02:55:21.100 --> 02:55:22.800]
You only have three minutes left.

[02:55:23.380 --> 02:55:25.400]
Don't taste like your medicine, can you?

[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:29.720]
How long will Ahmed rule Abadabadou find out tonight?

[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:33.560]
On Palestinian acidity only on CBS.

[02:55:34.840 --> 02:55:37.780]
When you're into a romantic mood with your guy

[02:55:37.780 --> 02:55:40.140]
and he wants to tap that alternate input,

[02:55:40.420 --> 02:55:41.280]
are you put off?

[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:43.560]
Do you find the thought of that kind of thing

[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:46.060]
just too uncomfortable to even consider?

[02:55:46.500 --> 02:55:48.720]
Well, now there's a solution to that dilemma.

[02:55:49.020 --> 02:55:50.680]
Famous Anus expansion cream.

[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:53.860]
Just put a dab of Famous Anus around your puckert.

[02:55:55.560 --> 02:55:57.080]
An injustice humanist,

[02:55:57.180 --> 02:55:59.920]
your third input will extend a full four inches

[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:01.480]
making anal a breeze.

[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:03.780]
So don't disappoint him.

[02:56:04.060 --> 02:56:05.540]
Get it to the Famous Anus.

[02:56:05.980 --> 02:56:07.540]

Oh, right.

[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:15.480]
Mad dog in the Humper, I'll really doing it.

[02:56:15.660 --> 02:56:17.440]
In his last trend, they just went ballistic.

[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.160]
Mad dog 2-4, we got the big one.

[02:56:20.160 --> 02:56:20.380]
Oh!

[02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:22.760]
From four to seven, the Humper's on vacation again.

[02:56:22.760 --> 02:56:24.220]

[02:56:24.260 --> 02:56:25.140]
About third, man.

[02:56:25.400 --> 02:56:26.200]

Neil Rogers.

[02:58:31.440 --> 02:58:33.120]
Oh, what's the problem officer?

[02:58:33.440 --> 02:58:34.240]
Deploy from the vehicle.

[02:58:34.620 --> 02:58:36.000]
What's the problem, it's...

[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:39.320]
If you're God-drying without a seatbelt,

[02:58:39.320 --> 02:58:41.940]
you will be removed from your car and shot.

[02:58:42.520 --> 02:58:45.860]
The police now have the authority to enforce seatbelt safety

[02:58:45.860 --> 02:58:47.400]
under the new Patriot Act 2.

[02:58:47.800 --> 02:58:49.340]
The new laws in effect now.

[02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:51.460]
So, click it or be shot.

[02:58:52.220 --> 02:58:53.740]
Officers don't like doing this.

[02:58:54.020 --> 02:58:55.540]
They are only following orders.

[02:58:55.880 --> 02:58:58.320]
It's for your own protection in the never-ending fight

[02:58:58.320 --> 02:58:59.540]
against terrorism.

[02:59:00.100 --> 02:59:01.900]
Terrorists act such as mouth noise.

[02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:03.640]
Perfume.

[02:59:04.160 --> 02:59:05.060]
And fighting.

[02:59:05.560 --> 02:59:06.940]
Could be annoying to others.

[02:59:06.940 --> 02:59:08.580]
So under Patriot Act 2,

[02:59:08.880 --> 02:59:11.140]
eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants.

[02:59:11.680 --> 02:59:14.100]
Anyone eating outside the designated eating area

[02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:15.960]
will also be shot.

[02:59:16.940 --> 02:59:18.280]
It's the law.

[02:59:19.160 --> 02:59:20.800]
We like saying that.

[02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:21.520]
The law.

[02:59:22.060 --> 02:59:23.120]
The law.

[02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:25.720]
The law.

[02:59:26.140 --> 02:59:27.180]
The law.

[02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:40.940]
Don't make mistakes when you bust rubber plate.

[02:59:41.840 --> 02:59:43.440]
No, no.

[02:59:43.540 --> 02:59:44.240]
Don't know it.

[02:59:44.440 --> 02:59:45.420]
Don't know it.

[02:59:46.580 --> 02:59:50.640]
Unlike OJ, this guy won't get away.

[02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:52.120]
No.

[02:59:52.880 --> 02:59:53.600]
Condition.

[02:59:55.340 --> 02:59:56.980]
And say goodbye.

[03:00:00.620 --> 03:00:01.600]
To the red.

[03:00:01.600 --> 03:00:01.640]
To the red.

[03:00:05.600 --> 03:00:11.320]
Because the LAPD knows better.

[03:00:15.420 --> 03:00:17.680]
Please, please, please, please, please, please.

[03:00:17.820 --> 03:00:19.380]
And I'm mean.

[03:00:20.600 --> 03:00:24.160]
Just wait and see when it's on court TV.

[03:00:25.240 --> 03:00:25.880]
Yeah.

[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:52.760]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye.

[03:00:55.880 --> 03:01:22.040]

[03:01:37.600 --> 03:01:51.000]
All the world loved Harry Potter in the Sorcerer's Stone and now he's back in theaters and this time he's traded in his one for a 44 megs journey Harry Potter go ahead

[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:51.700]

30 Harry Potter

[03:01:55.640 --> 03:01:59.480]
nothing is as enchanting as a trigger happy sociopath

[03:01:59.480 --> 03:02:04.900]
bumping off the bad guys with tough guy catchphrases and a little touch of wizardry

[03:02:04.900 --> 03:02:07.140]

[03:02:07.140 --> 03:02:09.120]
30 Harry Potter

[03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:12.820]
he's making his own rules and cleaning up Hogwarts Academy

[03:02:12.820 --> 03:02:15.000]
one creep in a time

[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:16.760]
I know what you're thinking

[03:02:16.760 --> 03:02:20.320]
did he cast six spells or only five?

[03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:25.580]
when I tell you the truth in all this excitement I kind of lost track myself

[03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:34.040]
but being this is a 44 Magnum the most magical handgun in the world and would blow your head clean off

[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:38.620]
you gotta ask yourself one question do I feel lucky?

[03:02:39.200 --> 03:02:40.020]
