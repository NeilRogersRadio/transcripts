[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900]
Then, while I'll have you know, I got connections in New York.

[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.740]
Send them in.

[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.640]
You'll see you now.

[00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.240]
Thanks.

[00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.800]
Godfather, what do you know? What do you say?

[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.000]
No, my most weak-out-so-quince friends.

[00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.400]
What can I do for you on the day of my father's abortion?

[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.760]
I am here to demand that you grant me a favor.

[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.460]
I want to sink in a head on new rushes.

[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.140]
What have I done to be treated with such disrespect?

[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.440]
Oh, Godfather, I'm at the end of my rope.

[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.840]
Every day they got me raped and did it.

[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.100]
Using my name in vain, and just making fun of my veins.

[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.060]
I should marry to you and weaken I'm old.

[00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.640]
You can act like a man.

[00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.040]
You know who I am.

[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.240]
You're a man who deserves respect for here's a ticket to Vegas.

[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.820]
Who needs Vegas?

[00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.740]
I already live in paradise.

[00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.380]
You don't talk to a man like Moha with like that.

[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.360]
I want you to take care of our friend Mr. Mo over here.

[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.820]
Sure, Pop.

[00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.700]
Okay, take your pants off, fella. Let me show you a good time.

[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.540]
Could you hands off me a big dummy?

[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.500]
I ain't dumb.

[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:12.920]
Goddum your stupidity.

[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.040]
Yeah, but not like they say.

[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.000]
Give me a hand here where you look up today.

[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.200]
I'm on a man's break.

[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.400]
Trevor Cowlin is about to keep him quiet, okay?

[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.640]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.460]
Hello?

[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.860]

[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.500]
He got up and takes a jenko plunge.

[00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.500]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.160]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.900]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.920]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.500]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.220]

[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.720]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.360]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.760]

[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.500]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.260]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.900]
Woo-hoo!

[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.000]
Hey, I ain't here!

[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.080]
Like I said, nice years, J903 at 560 WQM Happy Thursday.

[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.840]
What a beautiful day, man.

[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.180]
All I heard most in was ringing in sheets down there.

[00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.360]
It was?

[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.200]
That's what he said when he left for work.

[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.840]
Of course, he lives like in the animal cell.

[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.720]
He's like, oh, wait out there and burke with all the other old people.

[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.100]
And by the way, this business is about 50s, Mo.

[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.420]
Who now?

[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.300]
Is he kidding anybody?

[00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.460]
No.

[00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.380]
Give me a break.

[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.000]
Maybe he's talking about 20 years ago when he was in his 50s.

[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.920]
I heard that line this morning.

[00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.180]
I just about hit the floor.

[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.260]
A tremendous response on the podiums today.

[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.280]
Who would be the happiest if Neil croaked?

[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.040]
The bad news is for those people that I'm feeling like about 98%.

[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.520]
All that fogginess, all that culliness in my head is gone.

[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.940]
1160 votes.

[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.820]
How do you like that, George?

[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.200]
Oh!

[00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.020]
To be the happiest if Neil croaked, died, went for that long dirt nap,

[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.440]
and Mo, how a David had wins hands down your pants.

[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.900]
With Dancer, Neil's grave, it says here, 645, 56.6%.

[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440]
Or 55.6%, whatever the hell it is.

[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.800]
A lot.

[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.860]
George, your second?

[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.460]
Yes.

[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.920]
Because he thinks he'd get the show 196.16.8%.

[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.940]
Dennis the chronic, who called Mo this morning, by the way,

[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.680]
had nothing to say other than the fact,

[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.640]
I usually call in the Ripney O'Rodgers,

[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.740]
so why don't we have anything to say?

[00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.180]
Yeah, we know that asshole, even Mo knew that.

[00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.040]
What a, that's his claim to fame,

[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.620]
who calls the Mo Howard Show to Ripney O'Rodgers.

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.980]
Wow, that's here for Dennis.

[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.400]
Oh!

[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.240]
Asshole with no life.

[00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.680]
Closet case.

[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.300]
Dennis the chronic professional Catholic homophobo, 111 votes.

[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.140]
A very strong third.

[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.480]
By showing, Dennis, they hate you like poison.

[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.920]
Reverend D. James Kennedy, who was the late entry,

[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.800]
has 78th finished a very strong fourth.

[00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.320]
You see that?

[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.820]
Yeah.

[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.600]
Past some of the others like they were standing

[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.020]
like they were in the prone position.

[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.580]
Greg Reed, a real evil dwarf,

[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.140]
if there ever was 152.

[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.960]
The man who turned that big egg into Humpty Dumpty.

[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.060]
Fox News, Heather, that bitch, 41.

[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.500]
Geldie just out of spite, 18.

[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.840]
Eric, no more long pull, 16.

[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.660]
And John Gibson, a Fox News, I told you we shouldn't put him on her.

[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.820]
It only three, small potatoes.

[00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.460]
Didn't I beg you don't put him on her?

[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.560]
Yeah, I know, but I never listened.

[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.360]
I know.

[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.780]
What the hell do you have to do with it?

[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.200]
It was Carlos that put him on the roof.

[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.880]
What did you put him on there for, John Gibson?

[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.020]
They even know who that one is.

[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.880]
Some goofy, gov with glasses that keeps bouncing around from Marna,

[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.040]
like Keith Urban, another goofy, gov with glasses.

[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.200]
Bouncing around from one talking head network to another one.

[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.160]
But John Gibson's finally right one, though, okay?

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.680]
Way over there on the right end of your TV dial.

[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.880]
This story, speaking of that, just frost my fat ass big time.

[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.160]
Anti-bush t-shirt band at Michigan School.

[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.240]
I think we could probably use a few sound effects in the back of this one.

[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.660]
Dear Warren Michigan, school officials heard of a 60-year-old student

[00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.880]
who made a take off of t-shirt emblazoned with awards international terrorist

[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.020]
and picture president Bush, or Go Home saying they worried it would inflame passions

[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.700]
at a school where a majority of the students are Arab-American.

[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.540]
The student, Brett and Barbara chose to go home.

[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.000]
Swalye kids out there, if you wanted to, they are from school.

[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.080]
Go to school with a t-shirt on it,

[00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.860]
it's his international terrorist and a president picture on there.

[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.680]
He said he wore the shirt Monday to express his anti-war position

[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.040]
and for a class assignment in which he wrote a compare contrast as they

[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.080]
on Bush and Iraqi president, God-Am-Satim Hussein.

[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.160]
School spokesman Dave Mustonen said students have the right to freedom of expression,

[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.500]
but educators are sensitive to tensions caused by the conflict with Iraq.

[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.860]
Another excuse for censorship in America, just one more excuse.

[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.600]
They're sensitive to, was there a fight over it?

[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.940]
No.

[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.700]
Anybody a bitch in the screen about it?

[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.900]
No.

[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.700]
Not that we know of.

[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.180]
It was felt that emotions are running very high, Mustonen said.

[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.360]
Dear Warren is the center of an Arab-American community of about 300,000 South Eastern Michigan,

[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.580]
about 55% of the district, 17,600 students are Arab-American.

[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.500]
And you know what I think?

[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.300]
Probably most of them agreed with a t-shirt, right?

[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.720]
So what's the problem?

[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:36.500]
Was there a problem?

[00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.740]
No.

[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.860]
No, it was a problem that they don't want to give you, let you express yourself.

[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.180]
We've had a song that says, express yourself, but that's an old song.

[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.760]
And it used to be, back when we had a few freedoms left, that was BB before Bush.

[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.700]
What a pile, what a pile of crock is somebody I know would say?

[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.500]
Mo wants to dance on my grave, says the audience, how do you like that?

[00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.960]
Even yesterday, I didn't, remember I mentioned that the show, his show sounded a little bit better,

[00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.160]
not a lot, but a little bit better.

[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.460]
Right.

[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.980]
Since Ding Dong School was going on, they're holding his hand every morning,

[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.740]
and they come up with some cockamamae, a pole every day, you know, like we do.

[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.040]
Only more can tribe.

[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.340]
Like the thing this morning about, the 10 things that, what the hell was that?

[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.880]
Let's be able to do Carlos.

[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.920]
Yeah, must be asking you.

[00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.280]
Well anyway, it was a pretty weak.

[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.260]
And not one person called in the show yesterday to say, you know what, you're right.

[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:25.720]
You know, let your voice sound a little bit better.

[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:26.640]
We're actually listening now.

[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.420]
Not one.

[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.300]
Do you remember any, such call?

[00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.660]
No.

[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.100]
Maybe this is the call right now from Pompano wanting to say that Mo shows a little bit better.

[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.540]
Pompano.

[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.340]
Yes, good morning, Neil.

[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.060]
The show is a whole lot better.

[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.120]
So you listen all morning long, and the show is a whole lot better.

[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.980]
Well, you all, Duff and Clarence, are, are, are credit for that?

[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:57.800]
Well, anyway, I just want to tell you what I wanted to say was, I was surfing last night,

[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.860]
and I caught God bless her.

[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.000]
She's getting real old, but still a little fight to your woman.

[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.560]
Helen Thomas was on Phil Downey.

[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.280]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.580]
And she was talking about, Helen Thomas was on.

[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.300]
I must have been toward the end because he spent the whole rest of the show talking about Lacey Peterson that nobody cares about.

[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.700]
Yeah, no, it was towards the end, but she was talking about Bush and now he's the worst.

[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.980]
And somebody said something that they shouldn't, when she said that, and she had, as like, stepped back a little and say,

[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.540]
well, he has room for improvement, but she gave the best analogy of him whatsoever.

[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:35.000]
He's like Captain A half going after the white whale, and it's been this way since he first started in the presidency.

[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.700]
And there was just one other thing that I was holding on all the way for this week.

[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.300]
I was holding it, and it was the Daily Mail Sunday from London.

[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.220]
Yeah.

[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:50.980]
And they were talking about the rallies and the marches.

[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.800]
The marches.

[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.100]
The protests.

[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:52.480]

[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.800]
Here's what the guy wrote about Bush.

[00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:06.280]
There was no hatred and just universal contempt for someone who has perceived to be an inarticulous cowboy with delusions of competence, a toddler holding a hand grenade.

[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:07.160]
Hmm.

[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.760]
And that's exactly what it is.

[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:17.240]
And you know, it's just like, I don't know, I'm just ready to go to hell on the hand basket and me while I listen to you.

[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.640]
So all the way around.

[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.720]
I'm ready to go to Canada.

[00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.260]
Okay.

[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.440]
Have a good one, Neil.

[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:22.160]
See you at the border.

[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:23.880]
Oh, that's right. I already did go to Canada.

[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.660]
Here's our poll question today before we talk about poor Johnny Paycheck.

[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:32.160]
There's a guy that we can all respect, in spite of all his drugs and booze and smoking.

[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.880]
And there should be a message for you, Carlos, and everybody else I know who smokes.

[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.800]
I'm going to become a militant anti-smoker.

[00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.500]
And by the way, this business that asked me what else is named Jack?

[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.720]
Whatever his name is.

[00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.580]
He's going on this morning about these people that are suing McDonald's.

[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.640]
There's a new suit about the contents of the ingredient.

[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:51.900]
Yeah.

[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.500]
And I agree with him, but how come it is that they make a big stink about that?

[00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.700]
But when it comes to cigarettes, oh, it's okay for it to be legal to be sold.

[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.320]
And I don't understand that.

[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.360]
I don't understand that they wore these multi-billion, these ridiculous, 100 billion, 300 billion dollar lawsuit.

[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.200]
These awards.

[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:13.000]
As if people don't can't read the guy that morning on a package.

[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.420]
As if nobody knows that number one that continues addictive.

[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.160]
Number two, that smoking cigarettes is going to kill you and cause emphysema and lung cancer and all these things.

[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.140]
Same with the food.

[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.360]
I don't see any difference at all.

[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.200]
Maybe the food tastes better, but that's not the point.

[00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:31.900]
So it's ludicrous for them to be suing McDonald's and all these other peddlers of crap that are killing people.

[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:32.980]
But it's okay.

[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.480]
I'm the only one I guess who sees that it's crazy.

[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.880]
It's okay to be suing the tobacco companies.

[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.080]
It's crazy.

[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:40.420]
I see.

[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.180]
Paula Crab.

[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.420]
What I want most of the near-righteous show is this is our poll today and I think everyone is required to vote on this poll, Arctic.

[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.360]
It's mandatory.

[00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:51.580]
It is mandatory.

[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.920]
This isn't one of those that you can vote on if you feel like it.

[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.160]
If you find the time, this is mandatory today.

[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.820]
And by the way, a lot of great bedtime stories on our website today in yourriders.com.

[00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:01.380]
Some more which I'm actually going to get into.

[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.220]
And then we'll get back to poor Johnny Paycheck.

[00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.000]
He's dead.

[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.540]
Can you believe that?

[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:06.080]
Yeah.

[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.740]
Emphysema and what was the other thing?

[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.720]
Asma.

[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.620]
You died?

[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:11.240]
Yes.

[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.780]
Of course he also did a lot of drugs and a lot of booze and stuff like that.

[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.840]
He was a real hard-drinking, licking, whatever he was.

[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.400]
What I want most of the near-righteous show is Neil ripping the asshole callers, entertainment in a few laughs,

[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.400]
a few laughs and a few bedtime stories,

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.100]
Neil's liberal and anti-religion rantings, mostly pulls with a long list of choices,

[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.860]
or I'll listen regardless I'm a groupie.

[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.820]
I'll put that one under for Lynn.

[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.600]
Do you want to say?

[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:45.900]
Yeah.

[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.760]
What I want most of the near-righteous show is Neil ripping the asshole callers,

[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.620]
entertainment in a few laughs, a few laughs and a few bedtime stories,

[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.720]
Neil's liberal and anti-religion rantings, mostly pulls with a long list of choices,

[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.720]
or I'll listen regardless I'm a groupie.

[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.140]
What are you struggling about?

[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.600]
That mostly pulls.

[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.820]
Well, what do you mean what's wrong with that?

[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.240]
I know they like it.

[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.780]
Look at Monday and Tuesday, Mr.

[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.380]
I know.

[00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:14.720]
Put on your thinking cap if you can't find that far since it already is Thursday

[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:18.360]
and think back to Monday and Tuesday and the unbelievable response on that phone

[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.440]
they were ringing off the hook.

[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.560]
There's no denying it.

[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.960]
They were smoking, man.

[00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:25.220]

[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.200]
Like bubble gum

[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.140]
See you next time you need a story

[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:22.800]
Done, since it takes

[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.460]
And then for all you make you come

[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.140]
Box News Hella

[00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.960]
We really like to f**k you

[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.000]
Oh yeah

[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.080]
Box News Hella

[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.820]
We really like to f**k you

[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:39.140]
My 19th year did pretty well on that point yesterday

[00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:40.600]
Considering she's small potatoes

[00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.720]
She had, uh, what

[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.720]
52 votes, something like that?

[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.480]
41, whatever the hell she did head

[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.420]
Beautiful day, man, like I started to say before I interrupted myself

[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:51.700]
Sonny is going to be all the way up to 40 today, boy

[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:52.000]
Oh!

[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.400]
Man, it is just gorgeous

[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.360]
You know what it looks like when you just sit inside the window looking out

[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:56.920]
Sure do

[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.840]
Looks like one of those days in Vegas

[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.960]
You know what I call the blue blue sky

[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:03.060]
Yeah, that's what we got now, a big blue sky

[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.920]
And it's going to be smaller in man

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.900]
40 today, maybe 41 tomorrow

[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:07.280]
Oh!

[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.560]
Colon Miss sparks Pennsylvania airport pro

[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.520]
Wait did you see the first the votes on a pool today?

[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.240]
Very revealing

[00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.680]
Very revealing, in fact maybe we ought to stop it right now

[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.880]
A Saudi Arabian traveler

[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.720]
Said the city's anti-terrorism machine

[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.740]
In a pool year when he sprayed three

[00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.900]
Airport guards with Colon while trying to demonstrate

[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.960]
The liquid wasn't dangerous

[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.940]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:29.700]
This is a great story

[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.140]
I love it

[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.640]
The security screeners were rushed to methodist hospital

[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.500]
After being spritzed Wednesday is the student passed through a checkpoint

[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.520]
At Philadelphia International Airport

[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.740]
Unsure whether they had a biological attack on their hands

[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.700]
Hospital officials ordered a full quarantine

[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.600]
Ambulances inbounded emergency room were diverted to other hospitals

[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.840]
Patients and staff who had contact with the guards were quarantined for nearly three hours

[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.820]
We didn't know what the substance was at hospital spokesman Nann Myers

[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.300]
FBI spokeswoman Linda Visi said the 22-year-old student whose name was withheld by authorities

[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:06.460]
Was detained in question and released hours later after chemical tests confirmed that the vapors were harmless

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.480]
He was here legally all his papers were in order his flight plans were in order no federal law was violated

[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.000]
He was released, he said but he missed his flight to Europe

[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.540]
That'll lead to it

[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.120]
Initially even the screeners themselves didn't consider the incident where through reporting Visi said that they had second thoughts

[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.980]
About the sweet smelling spray

[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.020]
And called police

[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:28.040]
Flights weren't disrupted nobody was evacuated from the terminal center for spokesman Mark Pesci

[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.800]
I like that sounds fishy to me

[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.800]
I think they have a call from Indianapolis I don't believe it hello

[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.980]
Neil did you really have a stroke?

[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:37.180]
Yes

[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:38.660]
I can't believe it

[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:39.340]
Why not?

[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.440]
That's terrible

[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.820]
That's my second one the first one was a lot worse this was a little one

[00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.200]
Yeah I mean I thought you just had you or you had the flu or something

[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:47.760]
Yeah

[00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:50.500]
What are we going to do if something happens to you

[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.540]
I don't know looks like you already beat me to the punch you already moved out of town

[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.580]
Yeah but Neil what have I ever do to you?

[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.660]
I'm the only guy that's listening

[00:16:59.120 --> 00:16:59.520]
Oh

[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.920]
Oh it's that idiot again what did I ever do to you guy

[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.560]
Everybody now we have everybody that calls the show has got a name you know

[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.360]
We got the crazy guy but what did I ever do to you guy?

[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:11.320]
Oh what is he wrong from you?

[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.100]
I have no idea

[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:16.680]
Probably try and give me have another stroke

[00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.800]
Look at that pole so far maybe this is pretty pretty interesting

[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.700]
This is the kind of pull where we learn a little bit of something not too much

[00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.680]
We got 39 votes on there already

[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.640]
What I want most from the near Roger show is

[00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.840]
I'll listen regardless I'm a groupy 15

[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.980]
A few laughs and a few bed times through e7

[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.100]
Neil's liberal and anti-religious rantings 7

[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.200]
Entertainment in a few laughs 6

[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.460]
Neil ripping the asshole colors 4

[00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:47.460]
And mostly pulls with long list of choices

[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.040]
Oh!

[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:48.480]
None!

[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:49.660]
None!

[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.900]
Now Monday and Tuesday we had those movie pulls with long list of choices right?

[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.060]
From Mendis response on the phone

[00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.220]
Couldn't buy an open line

[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.680]
Couldn't buy an open line you could get through for love money or whatever

[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.860]
Or a crispy cream doughnuts

[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.280]
And look at look at right now is that a color of the board sing?

[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.300]
Do you understand? Because we had a list that's all I can respond to

[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.500]
We get this asshole to what did I ever do to you guy that just calls

[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.160]
Faining concern about my stroke which would be my worst problem by the way

[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.780]
It was a little tiny one not fun

[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.400]
I found out that my heart I got a good squeeze

[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.720]
I got a good heart that's what Dr. Bush said I got a good heart

[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.300]
He's the only Bush that will tell you that

[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.120]
Oh Hank needs to see badly he needs to see Dr. Hamft

[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.140]
Dr. Kendall Hamft my great ENT lady that really told me what will happen with me

[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.480]
But he won't do it I would I would even give the information out

[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:43.440]
But I know he won't go there because Hank's got a bad strep throat or something like that

[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.200]
He's got a strep the cockle infection something like that

[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.540]
In the consoles of his strep the cock and you know who I blame

[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.400]
Because I heard him yesterday the beginning of the show

[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.900]
I came in here especially three o'clock

[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.160]
I missed the first few seconds of passions just so I could hear the hopper

[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.600]
And see if he sounded any better

[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:58.780]
Did he sound any better? No

[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:00.920]
Sounded awful like death on wheels

[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:03.620]
Like death on two fat legs

[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:06.820]
So you know who I blame? Clarence

[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.020]
Clarence and Duff that's who I blame

[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.120]
Because I said to him up before to show this morning

[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.200]
He came in for his usual 30 second yuck yuck yuck

[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.280]
And I said how come he's still working

[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.580]
I don't know like that

[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.680]
And walked out

[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:25.860]
I mean you can't put somebody on here especially when your vocal cords are your stock and trade

[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:26.680]
You see what I'm saying

[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:29.200]
It's like taking away a violinist strativarius

[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.560]
You don't do that when you're in the business when you're in a radio business

[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.720]
And Muff should know this with his Morph Lewis voice

[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.680]
Your vocal cords that's your stock and trade that's your thing

[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.060]
Right?

[00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.940]
It would be like taking away the harmonica from Jerry Mured

[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:43.660]
Who?

[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.580]
From the harmonica that's long before your time

[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:47.380]
Whatever

[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.220]
From Stevie Wonder is that more like it? Sure

[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.060]
You just can't mess with somebody's a stock and trade

[00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.920]
It would be like taking away Victor Borges piano

[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:58.720]
Things like that

[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.100]
And this man's got a rake and barely squeak out a few words

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.960]
The thing you do is you call a guy and say

[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.300]
Hey today's Thursday take a couple of days off

[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.140]
Take your medication

[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.360]
Whatever and rest up your throat

[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.420]
Don't talk to anybody on this connect the phone

[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.560]
And just rest your vocal cords until Monday

[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.460]
That's what I would do

[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.420]
But no not these grave rub it just like me

[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:23.900]
Just like me I have a stroke I come into work the next day

[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:25.940]
I did not tell you what I was on a year

[00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:26.940]
Right?

[00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.820]
I was slurring and I was like incoherent and all of these things

[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:31.000]
Did anybody come in and say

[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.300]
Gee you really ought to go home? No

[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.040]
No, of course not

[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.620]
They don't give a flying crap they put on a good act

[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:38.400]
They do

[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.960]
Like I said they don't even put on a good act

[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.700]
Okay, they don't even do that

[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:45.040]
You're right now that I think about it

[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:48.240]
Greg sticks his head in the door there on Wednesday

[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.460]
Whatever the hell the day was

[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.020]
Yeah is he okay?

[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:52.020]
You know

[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.940]
What is the fingers crossed behind his back

[00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.440]
Like he's feigning concern you know

[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.420]
What else he can

[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.260]
He's part of the reason I was in a hospital in the first place

[00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:02.720]
He's a big part of it

[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.960]
You know what especially is

[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.820]
In fact he's a lot like Clark Kent you want to know why?

[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.780]
Why? Cause they only two people I know strong enough to throw everybody under the bus

[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.320]
That's his specialty throwing people under the bus

[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.700]
Just to avoid taking the heat himself

[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.660]
Scrooze everything up, dittles around

[00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:22.200]
Makes all kinds of problems and then looks for scapegoats to throw under the bus

[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.660]
Eyes go on Greg and by the way painorm is money

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:25.840]
Will you? You jackass

[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.640]
You silly person you

[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:29.940]
You Ojon Prabhakatur

[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.800]
20 seconds I get my message across probably not

[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:34.900]
Probably not

[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.040]
So they don't give a crap about people but send the hump or a home

[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.280]
Don't let him destroy his throat cause I'll tell you one thing

[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.400]
You know when you have a sore throat

[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.120]
Or a raw throat like from strep throat or just a sore throat

[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.720]
The more you talk you the worse you make it

[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.180]
Oh yeah

[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:51.360]
You're injuring your tender vocal cords

[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.820]
And I'm just telling you I don't want to keep going on

[00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.000]
Because you know he's in denial anyway about the fat part

[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.340]
So what's the point I just give up as far as he's concerned

[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.820]
Came in here yesterday and gave you a big son dance about how he's got strep throat

[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:07.080]
Well believe you me one of the reasons you got strep throat is the diabetes which is a immune system deficiency

[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.440]
It's a disease in the immune system most people are realized that take it from me

I still be in their last Monday none zero

[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.800]
But when you're working this

[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:43.120]
Inespecial for a bunch of grave robbers like we work for you're really reluctant to call in sick because right away they're thinking

[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.080]
I know he's screwing off or he's not coming in because we haven't paid his agent yet or some you know they got such costs some kind of

[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.860]
Cockamaine thing in the back of their mind even though you're bleeding that thread under doorstep you know

[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.240]
right so you're really reluctant not to come in with no matter how sick you

[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.340]
might be so I know how the hoppers feeling like crap don't do it hang call

[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.500]
and sick and then of course they find that they put clearance in the beast on

[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:11.000]
on what they was it Tuesday right I guess I'm Tuesday afternoon because he was

[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.420]
only on about an hour hour and a half something like that and they put them on

[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:16.100]
it how would you feel would you want to be on it I'd rather hear the gank

[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:21.080]
my any day of the week even as coma inducing as he is then clearance in the

[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:26.900]
beast with all the respect to them who do you follow what I'm saying no no

[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:30.360]
seriously my parents in the beast are as like bad high school radio I mean when

[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.400]
Zagaki's not just like bad you know commercial radio but good golly miss

[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.720]
Molly let's stop putting all these children on your muff and clearance let's

[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.900]
stop oh that's right clearance is one of them put a bunch of punky little kids

[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.540]
on here it does it sounds like junior high school radio like a bunch of

[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.800]
kids with a with a crystal set in their basement it's hard to have a basement

[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:56.780]
floor to what you're forgetting something what's that sports sports that that's

[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:00.600]
the point who knows more about sports Joe Zagaki or the beast and clearance

[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.340]
huh oh my oh my in fact they could put you know something they don't even have to

[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:08.640]
pay Zagaki to fill in for Hank all they have to do for four hours is play that

[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.380]
oh my oh my you know 50-year easy you know what people are over-tounding you

[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.000]
here here I am what's going on there today oh my oh my in fact just to prove the

[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.300]
point I think we're gonna do it today let me say oh my oh my why should we let

[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:27.200]
the Humper Steeler good idea right oh that'll loop you know I thought it'll

[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:36.340]
loop on right oh my oh my oh my oh my oh my yeah loop the loops Joe I know he was

[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.380]
exciting it's just the way your present and it's what makes him interesting old

[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.820]
Joe he's just all these years he's never presented in his most flattering life

[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:47.600]
oh my yeah oh my that's a lot more exciting than what I'm here most of the time

[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.460]
like in the morning oh no he's really I'm over the long mo you know you see we'd

[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:56.080]
like to see him move along right out the door down to her she highway and most of

[00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:59.680]
the audience agrees anyway it's too late by the way clearance and up too late

[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.580]
to salvage that turkey what I want most from the near-roger show is we got 91 votes

[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:09.360]
already that's like in about 15 minutes I told you everybody needed to vote to

[00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.060]
they and they're they're coming through you see this they may not come through on

[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.360]
a phone because most sane people don't call talk shows like I've always told you

[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.620]
well look at look at that guy from Indianapolis for a second there he really had a

[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:22.840]
sort like we had a real collar from what have I done to you yeah whatever wherever

[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:28.040]
he is and whatever he is besides a misfit and no matter what calling from Indianapolis

[00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:34.300]
to do that yes I know that I understand but that's the point and you know who I

[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.140]
think that is I think that's the New York guy right don't you the abueling the

[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.740]
abueling guy yeah and you're an asshole is who you are whether you're that guy

[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.640]
or not you're just an asshole is what you are you're an idiot can't you have a

[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.100]
conversation without a concluding what did I what what does that mean didn't I

[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:53.780]

book it's just idle chatter okay you know how the FBI Center here and all of

[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:18.300]
this chatter probably most of it is coming from the QAM programming orifices

[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.920]
that's where it here and all the idle chatter from and believe me you you

[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.060]
should be concerned when you start here in your idle chatter yeah I say

[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:31.100]
red alert for that like that bit we just played yeah that one I love that it

[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:37.100]
starts out slow but then it really it makes its point if it's red panic oh

[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.700]
it's red now but now seriously that's all this crap about well work and it's

[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:46.440]

the job for us okay and I just had a stroke am I gonna get all bent out of

[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.540]
shape about it of course not of course not so they'll just continue capitalizing

[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:01.440]
and exploiting into whatever the only one and we'll just continue a sucking

[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.780]
Is that like a little play on words?

[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:51.780]
Yeah

[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.560]
Terry Alexander's behind bars this morning

[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:58.380]
The DEA claims Alexander picture, look in your speaker you'll see his picture

[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.240]
Oh look at him

[00:37:59.240 --> 00:37:59.700]
Oh look at him

[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.200]
Try to sell two out of cover agents, 500 tablets of ecstasy two years ago

[00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:05.180]
Since then they've been building their case

[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:08.500]
Make sure take this sweet time, don't they?

[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:14.400]
On Tuesday the arrested Alexander and Edwin Waterfall who they say is Alexander Supplier

[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.660]
DEA agent Jake Joe Kilmer said Alexander's noteworthy

[00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:21.120]
And ledge dealings with drugs, not strike him as an odd combination

[00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:25.280]
It's so typical of South Florida nothing surprises you anymore in terms of who were arresting

[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.820]
And the different people from the different walks of life

[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.800]
Celebrities, important people, influential people that come up in the midst of the drug game

[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.380]
Kilmer said like George Rodriguez produced the New Rogers show

[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.140]
Both Alexander and Waterfall are charged with trafficking and conspiring to traffic ecstasy

[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.600]
The radio station is not commenting on the arrest

[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:44.600]
They did say they're jammed up and jelly tight or whatever that song was

[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.560]
What is that Florida sex history law looks to be set to be dumped? What is that?

[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.060]
Well whatever that is that's from much later on

[00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:55.940]
Got too much important stuff here including a call from Caldwell

[00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.580]
Where the hell is Caldwell California?

[00:38:58.700 --> 00:38:59.500]
I don't know

[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.720]
I'm asking Carlos he's want to put it on there, where the hell is that?

[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:05.280]
Caldwell, New Jersey? Hello?

[00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:06.980]
Yes sir

[00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.980]
So even when I don't call it you have this problem?

[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.540]
That's a guy again

[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.440]
I'm going to tell you what that was

[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.820]
This show is the most astonishing program in the history of the human race

[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.800]
All I had to do was mention his name and see it's a different chronic

[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:29.000]
It's not the abueling guy which is who we both thought it was

[00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.540]
That's a different guy because this guy's got a better voice

[00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.160]
But I still don't want to talk to him because he's got nothing to say

[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.140]
Seriously, can't we've been begging you for two years now?

[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:42.340]
Get yourself a life calling me from Caldwell, New Jersey

[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.400]
Just to let us know that it wasn't him who calls and says

[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.620]
What did I ever do to you who's the other guy? The other chronic committee inapolis

[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.420]
Who probably got kicked off the Bob and Tom's show

[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.280]
God, wouldn't Bob and Tommy great on the station in the morning?

[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.320]
Oh wait, man, would you love to follow them?

[00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:00.800]
Look what the pop head Bob and Tom look what we got

[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:06.440]
Orioles pitcher rushed off for a lot of day of field following diabetic episode

[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.720]
What is going on with those Orioles carlos?

[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:10.540]
They suck

[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:13.420]
Oh seriously, I think there's some kind of a curse

[00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:15.820]
Follow the model there

[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.560]
Follow the more Orioles right handed

[00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:27.900]
Jason Johnson was rushed off a practice field

[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:29.860]
Yes, today if you're a diabetic episode

[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.380]
See what I'm saying Hank?

[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.240]
You fatso?

[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.300]
Get with it, take some time off, relax, get your health back together again

[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.120]
Get your throat, though, your vocal cords straightened out

[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.160]
Quit coming under and squeaking, you're going to kill yourself for these bastards

[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:45.500]
It's not worth it Hank, don't do it

[00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:48.620]
They wouldn't give you the sweat off their ass, what are you doing you maniac?

[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.140]
Johnson wears an insulin pump to maintain a sugar level

[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:54.300]
Was treated outside the clubhouse on the back of a cart

[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:59.420]
By the Orioles medical staff and paramedics from the Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue unit about 10 minutes later

[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:02.160]
Johnson walked to the trainers room with minimal assistance

[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:06.440]
And of course we know that Orioles pitching prospects to the Becker died Monday of heat stroke

[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:07.280]
And etc.

[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:08.320]
So how do you like that?

[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.240]
The Orioles are having some real problems baby

[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.980]
What is going on with them?

[00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:14.280]
And then we got the poor Terry Alexander, he's in a jam

[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:16.040]
Little ecstasy

[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.960]
Maybe Otter called his good, I don't know if he knows OJ

[00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.600]
You know maybe we can look the two of them up together

[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.980]
You think?

[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:24.660]
I'll make the call

[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.900]
What I want most from the Nearodger show is how many votes we got on this turkey?

[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.320]
All 157 already in about 40 minutes

[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]
Less than that

[00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:33.940]
Shocking

[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:38.060]
I'll listen regardless of a groupie 54 or 34.3%

[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:42.380]
Neal's liberal in anti-religious randings 33-21%

[00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:46.640]

Entertainment and a few labs 27

[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.740]
A few labs and a few bedtime stories 20

[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.160]
I got some bedtime stories today by the way Cervil, thank God

[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:56.960]
Cause look at that phone

[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.560]
Oh boy, weak. And you want to know why?

[00:41:59.720 --> 00:41:59.860]
Why?

[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.280]
No, no, no, no

[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.140]
Losing rate

[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.320]
I'm building a list

[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.320]
Neal ripping the asshole callers only 15

[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.380]
Now isn't that interesting?

[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.380]
What percent is that?

[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:09.720]
Eight point nine percent

[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:12.200]
Neal ripping the asshole callers

[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.260]
They must have heard the show yesterday

[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.100]
They must have heard what a classic waste of my time and effort it was

[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.220]
was trying to do a radio show with those people on the phone because we didn't have another

[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:21.280]
list for the third day in a row.

[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.400]
And even when I did put out a good thing there, what do we get?

[00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.640]
Or we got corn dogs.

[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:29.460]
Oh no, seriously, I thought that was a fun thing to talk about being stranded on island

[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.720]
and being obsessed with one kind of food, whatever the hell it might be, whether it would

[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:34.780]
be Venn and Jerry's fish food, or whatever it might be.

[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:38.120]
Those rogers, I'm in the riddle bars I'm talking about?

[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.620]
Nothing.

[00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.720]
Neal ripping the callers, asshole callers 15, and mostly pulls with long list of choices.

[00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:45.940]
Oh man.

[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.480]
Only nine.

[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:49.180]
Thank you Robert.

[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:50.880]
Okay, stupid ass.

[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.480]
Right, nine.

[00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:58.100]
Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T and horizon line.

[00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:01.020]
Singer Johnny Paycheck is dead at the age of 64.

[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:02.660]
Take this job and shove it.

[00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:03.380]
That was his big hit.

[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.100]
That was the working man's anthem in 1977.

[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.980]
Paycheck have been bedridden and nursing home with, I wonder if he was in there with Mrs.

[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:11.920]
Wallace from passions.

[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.760]
She's going to be a nursing home if she don't watch it.

[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:16.360]
Unless Beth gets her with that needle first.

[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.340]
Paycheck have been bedridden and nursing home with emphysema and asthma.

[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.780]
He died to all, by the way, I don't want to spoil passions for you today, but Grace makes

[00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:28.660]
a comeback thanks to a K and the Tabitha who reached in at Big Boala water and they pull

[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:33.340]
her spirit right back from the, because the evil forces, the demons don't want the IV

[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:33.580]
yet.

[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.320]
You know Poison Ivy?

[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:36.220]
Yeah.

[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:38.260]
You have no idea what I'm talking about.

[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:38.660]
That's good.

[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.980]
Paycheck have been bedridden and nursing home with emphysema and asthma.

[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.480]
He died Tuesday, specializing in earthy, plain spoken songs.

[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.240]
Paycheck recorded 70 albums and had more than two dozen hit singles.

[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.780]
His biggest hit take this job and shove it inspired by a movie of that name.

[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:54.040]
How?

[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.540]
How come we didn't have that movie on our list?

[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:59.420]
In a title album that sold two million copies.

[00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:02.020]
His other hits included, so you didn't have it, but I got him right here.

[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:03.440]
Don't take her.

[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:08.200]
She's all I got, which was revived 25 years later in 1996 by Tracy Bird.

[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.820]
I'm the only hell mama ever raised.

[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.860]
Slide off your satin sheets, old violin and you can have her.

[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.120]
Sounds like that Larry Lujek bit, right?

[00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:23.320]
But those comedy song titles, slide off your satin sheets and I'm the only hell mama ever

[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:23.820]
raised.

[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:28.720]
My music's always been about life and situation, situation, comedy's situation like he said

[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.380]
1977.

[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.600]
And now the situation is he's dead.

[00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.280]
He and another ex convict.

[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:35.320]
Oh, I see, look at this.

[00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:37.480]
His career was interrupted in 1981.

[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.160]
We served two years in prison for shooting a man in the head in Ohio Bar in 1985.

[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.180]
He shot up in a haid.

[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:43.820]
Huh?

[00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:47.480]
He and another ex convict, country star Merle Haggard, performed at the Chilaconthic

[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.280]
Correctional in student Ohio while paycheck was imprisoned there.

[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.400]
I heard from fans constantly throughout the entire two years he said after his release.

[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:57.260]
The letters never stopped from throughout the world.

[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.680]
I look forward to mail call every day.

[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.660]
Ohio Governor Richard Celeste continued our commuted paycheck seven and nine years since

[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.180]
fragmented assault and a singer returned to his career.

[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:09.120]
He was court martialed in prison for two years in the 50s for slugging a naval officer.

[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.140]
He had a little bit of a temper.

[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.220]
He was like a real man.

[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.280]
He was a man's man.

[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:12.900]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:14.260]
He wasn't the other one.

[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.720]
He's pussy's, you know, like tab hunter.

[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.040]
He was a real man.

[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:20.620]
Ever tab hunter that did young love stole that song from Sonny James?

[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:21.340]
No.

[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:22.160]
I'm cap of a record.

[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:23.560]
Tab hunter on dot.

[00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:27.120]
In fact, when Tony Perkins met him, he said, hey, tab, what's dot?

[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.600]
Any showroom?

[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:29.600]
Any liked it?

[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.480]
North Miami Beach.

[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:31.760]
Hello?

[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:32.680]
Yeah.

[00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:34.040]
Do you think that guy's ecstatic?

[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.300]
What is it?

[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.100]
I'm Johnny Pitchett.

[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.000]
Johnny's other head was back on sheep up.

[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:40.520]
I know me.

[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.140]
I'll wait right here.

[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.080]
That's Woody.

[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.800]
I didn't realize it was chronic Thursday.

[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:46.120]
Did you?

[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:47.540]
No, I didn't get the middle of it.

[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:48.520]
It's not even 10 o'clock yet.

[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.320]
We've already heard from 400 or 500 chronic.

[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.180]
All right, and look all.

[00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.980]
This is sports waiting for my city to be here.

[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:56.760]
You way, yeah.

[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.420]
Now I pick the bad date of putt sniff and glue.

[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:05.720]
Yo, the learning channel and MTV have hooked up to bring you the freshest new decorating

[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:07.200]
show, Trading Cribs.

[00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:11.400]
This week, Snoop Dogg and Celine Dion redecorate each other's bedrooms.

[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.660]
Okay, Celine.

[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.680]
The first thing we're going to do is we're going to take down Snoop's horrible ceiling

[00:46:16.680 --> 00:46:17.160]
fan.

[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:23.120]
Oh, no, the Mr. Dogg he said to me, touch my ceiling fan and I will pop a cat on you.

[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:24.200]
Trading Cribs.

[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.300]
Watch music's biggest stars shine and Sam and paint.

[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:31.680]
So Snoop, what should we do with Celine's bedroom?

[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.200]
Yo, check it out.

[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.520]
I think we need to paint over that big old picture that faddle bow cracker with the white

[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:38.960]
beard.

[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.360]
Yeah, but that's the mural of her husband, René.

[00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:43.780]
Say what?

[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.680]
Damn, I know.

[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:51.560]
Trading Cribs will snoop dogby by wow by what Celine's done to his beloved bedroom.

[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.980]
Okay, Mr. Snoop, I hope you like what I have done.

[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:55.380]
Yes?

[00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.680]
Okay, you are opening your eyes now.

[00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:00.980]
Wait, hold up, hold up.

[00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.240]
Where my, where my dance ceiling fan is?

[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:04.220]
Get over here.

[00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:06.260]
Come here, you're a big dog.

[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:06.940]
Get me down.

[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.080]
Don't miss trading Cribs right after TRL.

[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.960]
Total redecorate life.

[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.060]
101560 W.Q.

[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.740]
So I think we left the choice off the pool today.

[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:16.340]
What?

[00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:18.980]
We could add four hours of Neil playing.

[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.060]
Oh, my, oh, my.

[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:22.060]
That might have been interesting.

[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.520]
Anyway, it might have got some votes too.

[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.700]
Tonight on PBS, somebody faces us and we thank them.

[00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.740]
Frontline, the War Behind Closed Doors.

[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:34.040]
The War Behind Closed Doors explores the 10-year gestation of a producer Michael Kirk calls

[00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:38.560]
the Bush administration's Dr. Neur preemption informed policy, focusing on official on the

[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:40.280]
officials most significantly associated with it.

[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:44.560]
Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Roosevelt in their top aides

[00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.960]
Louis Libby and Paul Wolfowitz respectively.

[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.500]
The policy in North Chia is that the U.S. has a responsibility to dominate the world's

[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.980]
hotspots as Kirk and that Iraq is a demonstration project of it.

[00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.060]
Interviewees include Weekly Standard Editor Bill Crystal.

[00:47:58.280 --> 00:47:59.000]
Oh, my God.

[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.460]
I can hear the boot stomping now.

[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:05.700]
Pentagon advisor Richard Puril and Kenneth Pollock are as that Pollock, a Clinton administration

[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.580]
national security advisor and author of the threatening storm the case for invading

[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:11.200]
Iraq will lie in narrowest.

[00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.240]
I don't think I want to see that.

[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.540]
No, no, you mentioned it.

[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.200]
With that, with that bunch, with Bill Crystal and Richard Puril.

[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.720]
Who now wants to see that?

[00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:18.920]
Oh, fat.

[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:19.820]
Thanks anyway.

[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:24.720]
Like I said, I'll be watching a Leafs playing out of the caps and the Panthers playing

[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.760]
the Senators in Ottawa.

[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.080]
Here's Linda who faxes.

[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:28.740]
Is this kind of cute?

[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:29.280]
Did you read this?

[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:30.860]
Yes, I did.

[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:31.380]
I read them up.

[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.320]
But let's take a very important call and keep us going because we're taking part in

[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:35.040]
one in time today.

[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.440]
Apparently.

[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:36.620]
What do you mean by that?

[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.000]
Well, we haven't given them a poll list though to get involved with yet.

[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:41.660]
Don't you understand?

[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.280]
Yeah, we're not building a poll.

[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:44.860]
You should know.

[00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:45.680]
Here's keep us going.

[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.020]
Hello.

[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:48.140]
Oh, okay.

[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.720]
See, I told you they're all out today.

[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:50.420]
I mean, one of them.

[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.100]
In fact, we'll have to start making a list to see which ones haven't called in yet.

[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:55.280]
Oh, making a list.

[00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.640]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60.

[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:02.380]
On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Live, it's ScreenListers day.

[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:03.540]
I'm going to be a Roger Show Carlos.

[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:06.580]
Got it?

[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:07.820]
He won't.

[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:09.320]
He's blinking like he doesn't believe it.

[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:09.980]
What do you mean by that?

[00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.520]
I don't understand.

[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:13.400]
Well, how can you handle all these call that are pouring in here?

[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.360]
The mighty Cone guy?

[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:18.040]
That the Goof-Flaw, the Abuelian guy called from Jersey?

[00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:18.700]
Oh, yeah.

[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.760]
That Ashley from the Minneapolis.

[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.060]
Look what you've done.

[00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:22.440]
What do you mean by that?

[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:23.160]
No, no, no.

[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:23.840]
You just relax.

[00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:24.840]
Don't worry about it.

[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.080]
Okay.

[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:26.520]
Sit there and worry about it.

[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:27.720]
Did you get that book on it?

[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.940]
Did you have Eric get that book cover on our website?

[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:32.960]
I got the Amazon information form and the picture and everything.

[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:33.540]
Excellent.

[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.040]
Very good.

[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.140]
Let's get on it right away.

[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.740]
Eric Alterman, what liberal media?

[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.400]
That's our new book recommended reading for the people out there for the 2% of the audience.

[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.740]
So actually read a book or have somebody read it to them.

[00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.220]
Linda says got a couple ideas for polls.

[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.760]
What as a listener would like to do with Neil before he croaks?

[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:53.880]
Better hurry.

[00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:54.600]
Strokes?

[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:58.340]
One, spend a day in Amsterdam visiting hot gay places together.

[00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:02.700]
Two, spend a day showing him the era of his ways concerning his politics.

[00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:06.040]
Three, spend a day preaching to him about God so he might find redemption.

[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:07.460]
Oh God.

[00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.340]
Four, spend a day getting baked on various drugs.

[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:11.760]
She says that's her choice.

[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:13.500]
I think it would be right to get stone with me.

[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:18.380]
Then things that Sheridan can do with Antonio, speaking of passions.

[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:19.740]
And you're right, Linda.

[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.960]
Passion is going great again.

[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.400]
Now it was really stuck in a rut there for a while.

[00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:29.380]
You'll be excited to see that IV makes you come back back into a body today and Sam is all guilty and excited.

[00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.240]
Wouldn't be nice to have like a big bowl of water in the kitchen.

[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:36.580]
You can just reach in there and make all kinds of things happen.

[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:37.680]
Well, that's what they do on passions.

[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:40.700]
Anyway, things that Sheridan can do with Antonio.

[00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:43.560]
One, use him as a serving table of Teresa's next talker party.

[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.560]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.700]
Two, take him to Letterman show for stupid Antonio tricks.

[00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.740]
I can't believe that Dr. Phil actually got a big number on Letterman show.

[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:56.000]
You told me to go to show that that is that's terrifying to me.

[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.880]
Three, making a meaning Antonio stand him up and use him as a room divider.

[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.020]
Yeah, but I think some of us might keep bumping into him and four read him out for gay parties.

[00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.060]
Excellent job, Linda.

[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.160]
Thank you so much.

[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:07.400]
You're right.

[00:51:07.560 --> 00:51:08.500]
Passion's rules, sweetheart.

[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.560]
Make no mistake about it.

[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:11.920]
I see Carlos.

[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.260]
We got him smoking here a little bit.

[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.380]
I'm not not like full heavy duty like it should be.

[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.060]
But considering WQ I am.

[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:20.520]
Hey, what's up, chief?

[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.440]
Let's talk about this carry out event or incident.

[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:24.920]
Yeah, the EDR DJ.

[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:25.520]

[00:51:25.620 --> 00:51:26.220]
I will be up the exercise.

[00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.780]
So the first time this has happened, if you recall a couple of years ago, Paul Cascerin

[00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.660]
Ovo had gotten arrested for smuggling bones.

[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:32.660]
Yeah.

[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.540]
That's it, that's it.

[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:36.860]
And that's it.

[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.200]
That was good.

[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:45.060]
I told you, do screenless, you get the good stuff in there.

[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:46.680]
Okay, that was probably Paul's boyfriend calling.

[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.420]
Maybe that was a young Ryan's boyfriend.

[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:49.080]
Which one do you think?

[00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.380]
I think it was PD.

[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:52.440]
WQ I am.

[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:56.440]
No, that's what he again was probably PD Lenny.

[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:57.820]
It was calling.

[00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:01.140]
So I'm just going to do my bedtime stories because I was even guy.

[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:01.880]
I'm sorry.

[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.500]
I mean, we got no calls.

[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.780]
We have what we have on the phone today.

[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.560]
Sick of better anything.

[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.860]
We have no real colors on his show today.

[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.500]
It's very sad.

[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.460]
Did we have one?

[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:13.380]
Well, the first guy we started on, he was pretty good.

[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.720]
He had something who's riff and bush and ass.

[00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:17.800]
He actually had something to say about something going on in the world.

[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.760]
And then the rest of them have been just the usual misfits.

[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.200]
Woody, your quote is up today.

[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.480]
Woody, okay, go away.

[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.260]
Don't go away, mad.

[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:25.060]
Just go away and don't ever come back.

[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.660]
Everybody in America hates you like poison.

[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.620]
WQ I am.

[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.440]
Go away.

[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:34.660]
Go away.

[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.500]
Go away.

[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:41.500]
Go away.

[00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:47.780]
Go away.

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.780]

[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:47.920]
Go away.

[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:52.500]
Go away.

[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.080]
Go away.

[00:52:54.420 --> 00:52:55.000]
Go away.

[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.000]

[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:55.200]
Go away.

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.200]

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.200]

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.200]

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.200]

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.200]

[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.300]
Go away.

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.300]

[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:55.360]
Go away.

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:55.360]

[00:52:55.360 --> 00:52:55.600]
Go away.

[00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:56.640]
Go away.

[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.020]
Go away.

[00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:00.220]
Go away.

[00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:00.440]
Go away.

[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:01.480]
Go away.

[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:03.300]
Go away.

[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:04.860]
Go away.

[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.160]
Go away.

[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.560]
Go away.

[00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:08.240]
Go away.

[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:12.920]
Go away.

[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:15.780]
Go away.

[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:19.140]
Go away.

[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.600]
Go away.

[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:29.140]
Go away.

[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:29.660]
Go away.

[00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:29.780]
Go away.

[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:29.820]
Go away.

[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:29.820]

[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:29.820]

[00:53:29.820 --> 00:53:30.320]
Go away.

[00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.200]

[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:32.100]
Go away.

[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:36.820]
Go away.

[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.220]
Go away.

[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:37.860]
Go away.

[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:38.600]

[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:39.240]
Go away.

[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:39.660]

[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:39.920]
Go away.

[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:41.260]
Go away.

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:41.880]

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:41.880]

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:41.880]

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:41.880]

[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:41.880]

[00:53:42.620 --> 00:53:42.620]

[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:45.140]

[00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:45.540]
Go away.

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:45.560]

[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:46.060]
Yes.

[00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:49.180]
Send me your password.

[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:49.240]
Send me your password.

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:49.240]

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:49.240]

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:49.240]

[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.060]
Send me your password.

[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:50.860]
Send me your password.

[00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:51.620]

[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:53.940]

Send me your password.

[00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:14.980]
I have how many нед 전에.

[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:15.540]
You got so manysemers on else's

[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:15.540]

[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:15.540]

[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:15.540]

[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:23.040]
and then lived to pay for a big time. W-D-Q-I-M. W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.160]
It has all ratings, baby.

[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.100]
Yeah, sure it does. Three-shear. W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.360]
And Neil.

[00:54:29.820 --> 00:54:30.180]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:32.020]
I got a lot of my family members down by the way.

[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:32.900]
That's not a big idea.

[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:33.940]
What is it?

[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.180]
Johnny Page-Jex.

[00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:35.800]
Yeah.

[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.160]
Is everything a lot like Vixie?

[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:39.940]
I don't want to go.

[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:43.320]
W-D-Q-I-M.

[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:44.420]
Yes, Neil.

[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:45.220]
Yes, sir.

[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:46.180]
How are you doing today?

[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.520]
Okay, I'm doing great.

[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.180]
Good.

[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.680]
Johnny Shine has a beautiful day and T.O. man.

[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:51.260]
It's beautiful.

[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:52.860]
I know it's gorgeous in Miami.

[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.440]
I'm telling you.

[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.020]
Five minutes after one, I'm going to be on my way to a nice lunch today.

[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.220]
I'm going to have my newspaper sit and relax for my feet up on the table in the restaurant.

[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:00.460]
Get kicked out. It'll be great.

[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.180]
Why don't you bring me a lot, please?

[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:03.000]
No thanks.

[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.800]
Okay, Neil, the reason I'm calling, you know, I don't know if you have a...

[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.960]
He had a chance yesterday last night to look at...

[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:09.800]
to watch some TV.

[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:15.740]
And Helen Thomas was on TV with actually your friend on here?

[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:16.980]
Yeah, we had a call about that.

[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:17.920]
Our first call about that.

[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:18.460]
I'm sorry, I just...

[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:18.920]
That's okay.

[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.080]
I just...

[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.920]
I turned him off because when I turned it on, he was talking about that stupid bra that disappeared Lacey or whatever.

[00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.580]
That's why I let the people from our side.

[00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:32.260]
I'm telling you, I never knew that Helen Thomas really had so much good things to say.

[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:32.760]
Yeah.

[00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.860]
About your friend George Bush.

[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:37.160]
About the Boso Maisteria.

[00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:40.160]
I'm telling you, she said it was the worst present she ever saw.

[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:41.340]
Mm-hmm.

[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.360]
That makes me very happy.

[00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:43.820]
And also, in quiz matches, they...

[00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.120]
Well, I make you very happy that she said it, but that doesn't mean he had to present anymore.

[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.080]
See, that's the only problem.

[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:49.500]
I know, I understand.

[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:50.200]
But, you know what?

[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.080]
At least I know that I'm not by myself.

[00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.920]
And I know that there are some people just wearing my ideas too.

[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.180]
And in quiz matches, they have a Boso.

[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.300]
And I tell you, the guy...

[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:01.940]
I never knew he had some sense of humor.

[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.080]
I'm telling you, that was...

[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.120]
Well, you know, any guy that would do limp penis spots,

[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:08.280]
he must have a little bit of a sense of humor, you know?

[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:09.280]
That's right, that's right.

[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.280]
Okay, and he'll listen, take me out of class with you, okay?

[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:12.260]
Okay, good luck to you.

[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:15.360]
What happened to that thing?

[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.360]
I must have misplaced it.

[00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.380]
Where's that thing about the t-shirts that you've faxed me?

[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:19.020]
That's very important.

[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.600]
I'll talk to the guy, and I saved it as well.

[00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:21.940]
No, no, I got to hear somewhere.

[00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:22.860]
What the hell did I do with that?

[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:23.480]
I didn't put...

[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:24.620]
I didn't shmit can that, did I?

[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.420]
Well, that would be really bad.

[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.100]
I remember this is the t-shirt...

[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:29.940]
Everyday just relax, condom.

[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.060]
International terrorist t-shirts.

[00:56:33.060 --> 00:56:34.740]
This was the first story we did this morning.

[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:39.700]
About the kid in Dearborn, one of the suburbs of Detroit.

[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.900]
Got sent home from school because he was wearing a t-shirt that had bushes picked around it

[00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.500]
and said, International Terrorist.

[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.840]
What are the typical stories of what goes on in America where freedom of speech is just a figment of somebody's imagination?

[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.820]
And if you don't, Evan believe me, you can f*** yourself, okay?

[00:56:57.460 --> 00:57:00.120]
Because you can't say f*** squat in America anymore.

[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:01.720]
It's just amazing.

[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:05.280]
We've taken all these gigantic steps back into the dark ages.

[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:06.440]
We keep talking about Afghanistan.

[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:07.960]
We bombed them into the dark ages.

[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:09.240]
They are already wearing the dark ages.

[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:10.540]
Now we're trying to join them, I think.

[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.940]
Take any enormous strides backward.

[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.400]
International terrorist t-shirts, you can actually get one.

[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:22.500]
Just go to www.internationalterrorist.com.

[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.260]
I like the black one myself.

[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.740]
I'm going to go to me one right now.

[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.020]
In fact, yes, do you see what they're made?

[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:30.000]
Canada.

[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.360]
Made in Canada, eh?

[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.900]
Children's large and small to triple XL adult.

[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:39.000]
I think we got one enough, even big enough for the Humper.

[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:43.160]
Well, and then they also make them in white.

[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.040]
So you can order the www.internationalterrorist.com

[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.320]
and be a proud wearer of that.

[00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:49.400]
Of course, down there, I don't know.

[00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.100]
I think it'd be a good idea to be walking around in South Florida, one of those on.

[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.980]
Up here, it'd be a big hit at the end of the day.

[00:57:54.980 --> 00:57:56.820]
Believe you, you have no idea.

[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:02.560]
You can only begin to imagine what they have to say about the USA and about our president up here in North of the border.

[00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.260]
You can only begin to imagine, except in the right wing reactionary rags, but other than that.

[00:58:08.260 --> 00:58:08.920]
I thought I was saying?

[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:09.880]
No, what?

[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:11.420]
They don't like him.

[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:18.100]
Well, you remember a couple of months ago, remember the broad crutch-ins assistant who had a finely resigned?

[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:18.800]
Right.

[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:19.780]
Because she said he would...

[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:20.380]
You remember the comment?

[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:27.420]
She had a quitter job this poor lady, because she had the balls to call it like it was, because she called him a M-O-R-O-N.

[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:27.680]
Yeah.

[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.680]
Exactly. That was her word.

[00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:32.300]
250 votes on a pool, and less than an hour.

[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.400]
We're well on our way to breaking all records today. Can you see that?

[00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.420]
What I want most from the Thea Roger show is, I'll listen regardless.

[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:45.640]
I'm a groupie, 83.33.2, a full third of this audience.

[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.020]
Our groupies, now listen to what if we do an OMI, OMI with Joseph Gacchi all day.

[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:50.200]
Let's give it a shot. Come on.

[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.540]
What about tomorrow?

[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:56.120]
Entertainment in a few last, 55. That's 22%.

[00:58:57.460 --> 00:58:59.420]
Don't you think Hank ought to go see Dr. Hamft?

[00:58:59.820 --> 00:58:59.920]
Yeah.

[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.280]
But he won't.

[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:01.440]
No.

[00:59:02.240 --> 00:59:02.820]
She's great.

[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.300]
She would straighten his ass out in the rest of the tool I can buy in one day.

[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.240]
I'm telling you.

[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:08.660]
She could go to that strip throw.

[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.180]
He's got...

[00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:12.800]
He keeps slept on over there in Dave County, Demonstinon, all of his chronic doctors.

[00:59:13.220 --> 00:59:14.340]
You know, if...

[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.600]
What am I getting excited about?

[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:17.480]
You know, you can lead an elephant to water.

[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:19.840]
But you can't make him go to a good doctor.

[00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.460]
Niels liberal and anti-religious writings, 45 people want to hear that.

[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.620]
That's what they want most.

[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.460]
17.7%.

[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.580]
A few laughs and a few bedtime stories, 35.

[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:32.020]
Niel ripping the asshole callers, 22.

[00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:33.480]
Only 8.6%.

[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.780]
Want to hear WQIM?

[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.520]
I'm guessing this is the Niel Lager show, right?

[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:43.020]
You're guessing?

[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:44.060]
Yeah.

[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.840]
Well, I got the number from WQIM, so it must be.

[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.060]
It is.

[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.080]
This is Niel Lager show at WQIM.

[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:50.380]
Hi, thanks.

[00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:51.960]
Who's this?

[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:53.780]
Who are you calling?

[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.840]
Well, I can talk to George or...

[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:57.900]
Okay.

[00:59:58.800 --> 00:59:59.540]
Is this George?

[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:00.100]
Yeah.

[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:01.040]
Great.

[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:05.280]
That doesn't sound like you, because I was sitting on the radio.

[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:05.920]
You sound different.

[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:09.440]
So the reason I'm calling, I get right to the point because I know you're busy in there.

[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:09.580]
Great.

[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.580]
I am busy.

[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:14.820]
I know you guys don't do jokes, but I...

[01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.960]
I picked up a joke off of the internet.

[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:17.180]
Okay.

[01:00:18.300 --> 01:00:21.460]
Anyway, that was that Niel ripping asshole callers, 22.

[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.820]
Or mostly pulls with long listed choices, 10.

[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.600]
I'm telling you, boy, between...

[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.540]
What was the one where I potted up the thing the other day and it was like right there?

[01:00:28.780 --> 01:00:28.880]
Right.

[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.860]
And then we had the anthrax thing last year.

[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.120]
I'm telling you, I haven't lost it.

[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:32.200]
Oh!

[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.180]
It's fight of the stroke.

[01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.240]
I'm still stroking it, man, but I'm in spite of it.

[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.180]
Still haven't lost the magic touch.

[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:42.500]
Thank you very much, sir, by the way, for your very funny yuck.

[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:44.480]
Yuck.

[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:47.720]
I got my finger all the way up to my eyebrow, inside.

[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:53.040]
10, 14 at 560 WQM, Tom Laman and Joe Paredo of Halopodiac GMC.

[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:54.120]
They're not yoken around here.

[01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:57.440]
They're proud of what ounce three great Niel Rogers, Niel Diel's no kidding.

[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.900]
So listen very, very closely.

[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.680]

0% on all 1500 series pickups at Halop right this moment.

[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:11.200]
Niel Diel number two.

[01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:15.680]
At least a GMC on board for just $299 a month plus tax for 48 months.

[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:20.120]
That's correct only $299 a month plus tax for a great GMC on board.

[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.980]
Niel Diel number three, by a potty act five for just $199 a month.

[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:25.860]
That's correct.

[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.100]
Only $199 a month gets you a potty act five.

[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.720]
Halop's also got great Niel Diel's on use cars, trucks and SUVs as well.

[01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.880]
And as far as credit is concerned, even if you're a deadbeat, even if he wants new Greg Reed,

[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:39.560]
no problem, he'll still cut you deal somehow, some way, and Halopodiac.

[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:44.340]
It's the great Niel Diel triple letter going on right now at Halop 134-1 South Dixie highway.

[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.620]
That's you almost want across from the falls open every day, seven days a week.

[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.980]
You know that, Moll mentioned again this morning that if a Tom loses Major League Baseball,

[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.360]
you're really ill-feel it.

[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.040]
You'll really be sorry.

[01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:53.740]
Won't you be sorry?

[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:00.280]
For more information called the Niel Diel hotline tool free at 1-885-344-4211.

[01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:02.820]
That's 1-885-344-4211.

[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.080]
Don't forget all Niel Diel's are subject credit to Provell C-Dieler for details.

[01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:10.820]
Halopodiac GMC is make no mistake about a professional grade and proud of it.

[01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:17.080]
My mind and local, we're sports radio five-sixys, you ain't, you ain't.

[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.780]
You fudge back in?

[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.720]
And now, things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:28.440]
Hey, Pam, what do you say we'd take a couple of classes over there at the community college?

[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.060]
Things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.540]
I've run out of things that rhyme with bitch.

[01:02:33.540 --> 01:02:36.280]
Things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.760]
My wing looks so big between your hooters.

[01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.660]
Things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.700]
Let's go out, Pam.

[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.580]
The only thing on TV is wrestling and tractor fools.

[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.300]
Things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.040]
Man, be an A Rockstar sucks.

[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:56.220]
I want to work on an auto assembly line like my deadbeat dad and his deadbeat dad before him.

[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.920]
Things you'll never hear Kid Rock say.

[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.820]
It's a 1018 at 560.

[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:03.060]
I was just to read over this fact.

[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.420]
You just sent to me.

[01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:04.740]
Yep.

[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:09.720]
Editorial observer, Brent Staples writes in the op-ed, uh, page of New York Times today,

[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:15.120]
The trouble with corporate radio, the day the protest music died, consolidated ownership has changed what we hear on the year.

[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:15.580]
No, Schmidt.

[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:19.340]
And whoever faxed this is, today's New York Times read this on the year.

[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.120]
It'll kill out of time.

[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.800]
Pop music played a crucial role in that.

[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:39.880]
I'm not going to read the whole thing in the national debate over the Vietnam more by the late 1960s radio stations across the country were crackling with blatantly political songs that became mainstream hits after the National Guard killed four anti-war demonstrators of Kent State in Ohio in the spring of 1970.

[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:46.920]
Crosby Stills National recorded a song simply titled Ohio about the horror of the event criticizing President Richard Nixon by name.

[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:52.900]
The song was rushed onto the year while sentiment was still high and became both an anti-war anthem and a huge money maker.

[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:57.780]
A comparable song about George W. Bush's rush to war in Iraq would have no chance at all today.

[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:10.920]
There were plenty of angry people many would prime music buying demographics but independent radio stations that once would have played edgy political music have been gauved up by corporations who control hundreds of stations and have no wish to rock the boat.

[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:16.640]
Corporate ownership is change what gets played and who plays it.

[01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:24.700]
With a few exceptions that is stockies who once existed to discover for for a pocket of new music have long since put them been put out the pasture.

[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:31.560]
The new generation operates from playlist dictated by corporate central list that some DJs describe as wallpaper music.

[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:32.120]
Oh!

[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:40.900]
Recording artist were seen as hysterics when they complained during the 1990s that radio was killing popular music by playlists.

[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:47.520]
Playing too little of it popular music but musicians have turned out to be the canaries in the cool mind.

[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:57.660]
The first group to be affected by a 1996 federal law that allowed corporations to gobble up hundreds of stations limiting expression over the airwaves that merely licensed to broadcasts but owned by the American public.

[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:06.040]
When a media giant swallows a station it typically fires the staff and pipes in music along with something that resembles news via satellite.

[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:13.820]
To make the local public think things have remained the same the voice track system sometimes includes references to local matters sprinkled into the broadcast.

[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:33.660]
But my rock and roll colleague William Sapphire describes as the re-unation of independent radio started with a corporate tiesay, a corporateizing in the 1980s but took automatically when the telecommunications act of 1996 increased the number of stations that one entity could own in the single market and permitted companies to buy up as many stations nationally as their deep pockets would allow.

[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:42.220]
The new rules were built as an effort to increase radio diversity but they appeared who had the opposite effect and you are absolutely correct sir.

[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:51.700]
Under the old rules the top two owners had 115 stations between them today the top two own more than 1400 stations.

[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:58.540]
In many major markets a few corporations control 80% of the listenership or more like soft Florida.

[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:05.780]
Liberal Democrats are horrified by the Legion and conservative talk show host to dominate the airwaves but the problem stretches across party lines.

[01:06:06.380 --> 01:06:17.360]
National Journal reported last month that representative Mark Foley Republican of Florida was finding it difficult to reach his constituents over the year since national radio companies moved into his district, reducing the number of local stations from five to one.

[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:28.600]
Senator Byron Dhruggen, Democrat of North Dakota had a potential disaster in his district when a freight train carrying an anhygrist ammonia derailed, releasing a deadly cloud over the city of Minot.

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:39.340]
When the emergency alert system failed a police called the town radio stations, six of which are owned by corporate giant Clear Channel, according to news accounts no one answered the phone at the station for more than an hour and a half.

[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:45.200]
300 people were hospitalized some partially blinded by the ammonia pets and livestock were killed.

[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.700]
How do you like that? Nobody answered the phones there for more than an hour and a half probably because there wasn't anybody there.

[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:56.440]
Gee, you think? Yeah. Because their whole life is on automation at Cheap Channel.

[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:07.500]
The perils of consolidation can be seen clearly in the music world, different stations play formats labeled adult contemporary, active rock, contemporary hit radio and so on.

[01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:17.920]
But studies show that the formats are often different in name only and that as many as 50% of the sauce played in one format can be found in other formats as well, like building a buttercup by the foundations.

[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:25.660]
The point of these sterile playlists is to continually repeat songs that challenge nothing and no one blending in large blotzer commercials.

[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:36.020]
Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin has introduced a bill that would require close scrutiny of mergers that could potentially put the majority of the country's radio stations in a single corporation's hands.

[01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:44.560]
Lawmakers who missed last month's Senate hearings on this issue should get hold of the testimony offered by singer and songwriter Don Henley best known as member of the Eagles, the rock band.

[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:53.180]
Mr. Henley said a testimony we call the congressional pay-ola hearings of 1959 and 60, which showed the public how disc jockeys were accepting grabs to spin records on the air.

[01:07:54.120 --> 01:08:00.980]
Now Mr. Henley said record companies must pay large sums to independent promoters who intercede with radio conglomerates to get songs on the air.

[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:06.260]
Those fees Mr. Henley said in a recent telephone interview sometimes reach $400,000.

[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:11.580]
Which brings us back to the hypothetical pop song attacking George Bush.

[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:18.520]
The odds against such a song reaching the air are steep from the outset given a conservative corporate structure that controls thousands of stations.

[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.180]
Record executives who know the lay of the land take the path of least resistance when deciding where to spend their promotional money.

[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:31.340]
This flight to sameness and superficiality is narrowing the range of what Americans hear on the radio and killing popular music.

[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:33.840]
Rights Brent Staples today is New York time.

[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.740]
Nice going Brent.

[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:39.040]
And you are absolutely effing correct Mr. Attila right now.

[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.800]
Who the hell in their right mind is going to have the balls to play a song ripping out presidently?

[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:43.300]
You know what I'm saying?

[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:46.960]
Nobody I know.

[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:47.980]
Oh right.

[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:49.000]
Don't lie.

[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.080]
Oh the heartburn.

[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:57.180]
Don't every time I see.

[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.560]
That free card it dimwits.

[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.420]
Don't don't fall.

[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:08.840]
I see these.

[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:17.220]
These presidents of the fuck are repubbing it muscle-in and in archingular idiots.

[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:23.500]
I don't know why they won't want to stop a night here.

[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:29.180]
The first person ever for years with president of the fuck.

[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:43.180]
Oh what I did to got both ones fall and get to be your voted for.

[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.360]
Oh why?

[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.480]
If you want this.

[01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:54.180]
Don't talk about this drumming stupidly.

[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:59.480]
Don't talk about this drum and rich kid.
