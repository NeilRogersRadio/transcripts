[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]
Oh my, oh my!

[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.720]
No!

[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.880]
Pull up and Georgie!

[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.300]
No!

[00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.360]
Well, why don't we try to get old-summer?

[00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.480]
Why don't we get new life on our own?

[00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.740]
Well, we gonna tell the world they say

[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.460]
No more, whoa, we gonna win Georgie!

[00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.980]
No!

[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.200]
Pull up and Georgie!

[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140]
Well, we know Saddam is really a big threat

[00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.300]
But no one wants to see World War III yet

[00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.260]
With up, we'll Georgie!

[00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.460]
Chill out, we'll Georgie!

[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.720]
We oughta stay home!

[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.200]
We'll Georgie, wait up!

[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.580]
Chill out, we'll Georgie!

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.560]
Chill out!

[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.560]
Before you send our men

[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.200]
Be sure to count to ten

[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.340]
Before you blow the crap out of your rack

[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.700]
Please listen to the you and wait up and Georgie!

[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.120]
No!

[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.420]
Pull up and Georgie!

[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.920]
Wait up and Georgie!

[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.060]
Okay, so speaking of Georgie, Georgie's doing the show again today.

[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.040]
I'm just sitting in.

[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.900]
Well, I mean not really, but...

[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.660]
I'm getting my voice back, but I got like a little post-nasal drip.

[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.560]
You know what I mean?

[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.700]
Yeah, I know you like that.

[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.840]
No, a nightmare-ish.

[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.100]
Now, I didn't notice on the schedule yesterday

[00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.980]
Not only is it Jo and Mark filling in for Hank this afternoon

[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.260]
Is on his way to Vegas for the Reverend Jones fight.

[00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.460]
But Anthony and Vlad are doing their show tonight.

[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.560]
Right.

[00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.300]
I mean, what are we talking about?

[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.240]
Huh?

[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.420]
And I noticed Mo giving him a big plug here this morning

[00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.240]
Jo and Mark is good close personal friends.

[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.320]
Another one of those Tony plugs.

[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.120]
You know, these are the guys that he has to follow

[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.540]
and has to get sandwiched in between these two non-sport shows

[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.800]
and cursing them just up and down behind closed doors, of course.

[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.220]
Oh, speaking of that, what a great segue, Neil.

[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.700]
Thank you.

[00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.400]
The war behind closed doors will be on

[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.880]
WNED in Buffalo, my public television at midnight tonight.

[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.660]
I'll be right up there.

[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.300]
I'm gonna tape it and then watch it early tomorrow before I go on here.

[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.840]
Oh, real early.

[00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.240]
But as far as funny, I don't think it's on there.

[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.960]
I need to WPBT or WFCL.

[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.400]
I've tried everything with standing on my head on the WPBT website

[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.320]
to get their schedules.

[00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.480]
And it's just they don't want to tell you.

[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.000]
No, no, seriously, for whatever reason they don't want to tell you.

[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.480]
Just like the mass media doesn't want to tell you that today is

[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.540]
virtual, whatever they're calling it today.

[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.440]
The virtual march.

[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.200]
Virtual march on Washington Day.

[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.960]
If you really want to get the information now, there's a link on our website,

[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.340]
which is very colorful and nifty.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.960]
But if you click that on, you really aren't going to find out very much.

[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.200]
If you really want to find out what's going on and how you can participate,

[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.920]
go to moveon.org.

[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.800]
Yes.

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.980]
M-o-v-e-o-n.org, which is the site that James Cromwell gave on,

[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.720]
whatever it was, entertainment tonight last night.

[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.460]
Yeah, wasn't that nice?

[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.140]
That entertainment tonight gave a plug to this.

[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.060]
There are like, zillions of people participating.

[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.860]
And of course, we have millions of people all over the world again marching here today.

[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.500]
But the media is, and in fact, CNN is like the cheerleaders.

[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.160]
I don't know about Fox, because I don't watch them.

[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.320]
I'm sure that they're really cheerleading.

[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.400]
They have, they got pom-poms.

[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.680]
They borrowed from Trent Lot.

[00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.440]
When it was respectable to be a friend of Trent Lot.

[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.840]
But nevertheless, CNN is just cheerleading, showed on Iraq.

[00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.540]
How many months have they had this thing on it?

[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.640]

[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.000]
The Iraq attack and the orangutans, all this other crap they've had on there.

[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.120]
Although I will say now, they finally embarrassed MSNBC

[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.180]
into dropping the high alert orange logo from the bottom of the screen.

[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.080]
That went on for weeks and it was kind of like a pissing contest,

[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.700]
like a, like a, like a duel, you know.

[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.720]
And then finally CNN dropped it.

[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.640]
So MSNBC waiting a couple of days just in case to make sure they didn't bring it back.

[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.680]
And then they said, okay, we'll drop that fast and we can drop Phil Donahue.

[00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.640]
Although, he's right on their heels.

[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.040]
Tomorrow night last Phil Donahue show, I mean a Friday night.

[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.460]
MSNBC fired Phil Donahue on Tuesday, abruptly ending the veteran talk show host Returned TV

[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.160]
after six months of poor ratings.

[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.740]
Donahue's final show will be Friday night.

[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.600]
The news show that precedes him on the air.

[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.460]
Count on Iraq temporarily will be expended a two hour to replace him.

[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.680]
And last night I flipped out of there to see what they were doing because, you know,

[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.980]
your figure if he's getting canned and this story came out yesterday afternoon,

[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.400]
that they would do something or say something.

[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.600]
When you think so, you'd think.

[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.660]
No, instead they showed an old rerun from about three weeks ago with Peter Jennings as the guest.

[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.300]
In fact, even in the story it says Donahue's office referred calls to his agent on Thursday

[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.520]
and he did not immediately return the call for comment.

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.180]
And what's he to say?

[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.520]
It says in the story Donahue's chances weren't helped by MSNBC's impatience.

[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.800]
They're very quick to cancel shows.

[00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.760]
Whoever this guy is.

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.200]
Head of ADT research.

[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.800]
Another one of those research shirts.

[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.360]
How fits the other ass well.

[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.720]
Right from the start they haven't settled on a format and let it grow so people can find it.

[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.460]
If it's not working in a few months they cancel it and move on to something else.

[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.580]
It wasn't going to work.

[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.360]
No.

[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.660]
Because first of all Phil is how old is he 67?

[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.640]
Yeah, he's 67.

[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.660]
What are you laughing about? That's how old he is.

[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.980]
You know what he doesn't look a day older than when I used to watch him when I was a child.

[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.420]
Right. He looks about the same guy.

[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.300]
I think there's a way here.

[00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:53.900]
He certainly don't look as old as Mo.

[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.740]
Well, who does?

[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.380]
And at least he's got his own hair, his own teeth.

[00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.080]
And doesn't have a philosophy bag or a vericose veins from what that Marlowe says.

[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.720]
That's Mo.

[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.740]
That's Mo's own hair. He bought it.

[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.300]
It says Marlowe says he's got his own and hair too.

[00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.700]
But anyway, it was the ratings disaster.

[00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.300]
Like everything on MSNBC.

[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.740]
He's just too old and funny, Dutty, too, you know.

[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.360]
And of course all those people who were libbles back in the 60s and 70s when he was on the air, when he was the, you know.

[00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.820]
He was the originator of the format basically.

[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.220]
At least I'm talking on a big scale.

[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.620]
I'm not talking about people like Alan Burke and who is the guy with the Joe Pine.

[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.440]
But in terms of network talk TV, he was really one of the originators.

[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.600]
And all those people are either dead or they're like, you know, they're in nursing homes now.

[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.540]
Like me.

[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.160]
Now seriously, no, you're right.

[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.640]
Now how can we ever call from Fort Myers?

[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.860]
I haven't even said hello yet.

[00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.180]
Now you know this isn't going to be good.

[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.980]
You know that, right?

[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.160]
Fort Myers, hello.

[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:47.740]
Hello.

[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.040]
See what I tell you.

[00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.740]
Hello. Hello.

[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.160]
Yes, sir.

[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.340]
Hello.

[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.880]
Speak to me, sir. This is, this is, it's called a telephone.

[00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.820]
This is Alan.

[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:56.840]
Yeah.

[00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:57.740]
Fort Myers.

[00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.700]
Yes, Alan.

[00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.760]
Love the show.

[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.500]
Uh-huh.

[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.360]
What a day I'll tell you.

[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.920]
Neil's back in the air.

[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.780]
Yeah.

[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:07.820]
It's just, it's also the other four ladies in general.

[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.180]
Is this a phoney voice or is this like one last gas before you put your foot in a grave?

[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.500]
Oh boy, Neil. I've been listening to you too long for that.

[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.420]
Yeah.

[00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.200]
Are you there?

[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.420]
Yeah.

[00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.400]
Oh, that was good.

[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.180]
That was really great.

[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.320]
I think I'll put that, yeah, I hung up on him.

[00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.140]
Oh, you had another call coming in on his, on his pacemaker.

[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.020]
Maybe you'll fall back.

[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.340]
Yeah.

[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.560]
You had a call coming in on his pacemaker, Alan.

[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.660]
Have a nice day, Alan.

[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.940]
Okay, you will conquer you.

[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.600]
That was beautiful.

[00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:35.580]
That was hysterical.

[00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.360]
Have him back on.

[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.320]
That was probably filled on to you doing a voice.

[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.120]
Either that was a fake voice or yet his grandson called informed.

[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.260]
Come on. That was a fake voice.

[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.540]
What's wrong with you, man?

[00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.320]
That's our Florida for you.

[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.260]
Even on Sunday other coast.

[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.820]
It's Florida.

[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.260]
Out to our funeral party, land of the walking dead.

[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:53.800]
Have a nice day, Alan.

[00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.800]
It could be your last from the son of it.

[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.160]
He said he's been listening too long for me to ripen like that.

[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.200]
Sorry, are we sorry?

[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:00.760]
Do we want to apologize to him?

[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:00.920]
No.

[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.280]
No.

[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.920]
Anyway, this, all this dog and pony show, there's Robert Blake on there.

[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.940]
He's the owner's OJ.

[00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:07.760]
Look at his CNN.

[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:08.780]
Certainly not news.

[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.620]
Certainly not news, but they're sure getting everybody primed up for the Abush War now.

[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.660]
Oh, I better do the uphols, huh?

[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:18.120]
Yesterday's poll because it's basically your show.

[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.440]
I'm just here filling in the gas.

[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.360]
Oh, like yesterday about 95% filling in the gas 30, 147 votes.

[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.880]
Pretty good.

[00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.740]
I'd rather croak.

[00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:29.340]
That's going to be our regular poll like once a week or every couple of weeks.

[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.280]
I'd rather croak then and then we'll have different choices.

[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.900]
Yesterday winning hands down.

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.640]
I'd rather croak than vote for George W. Bush 623 50%.

[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.520]
Just a hair.

[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.140]
Just a curly little hair less than 50%.

[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.520]
49.9.

[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:50.400]
I'd rather croak than vote for Hillary 267 21.4%.

[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.860]
So she got battered pretty good too, but not even in the same league with Georgie.

[00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.800]
He's not starting any wars yet.

[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.700]
Rather croak than listen to Mohawar David at Boah.

[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.700]
He is really taken a tumble, you know what?

[00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:04.300]
149 votes less than 12%.

[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.640]
149 votes out of 1247.

[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:08.880]
Back in his glory day.

[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.140]
Yeah.

[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.200]
Back when he was wearing that puse hair piece.

[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.480]
Back in those days, all he had to do was put him on any pole.

[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.480]
And he immediately liked cream with rise to the top.

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:19.860]
Right?

[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.140]
He immediately cream like sour cream.

[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.160]
I'd rather croak than buy a Michael Jackson CD 121.

[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.380]
Then watch another Mike Tyson fight 49.

[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.000]
And I'd rather croak than drive a Mustang and I'm proud to say even though it came in distant last place with only 39 votes.

[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:37.840]
That was my vote.

[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.780]
And I'm proud of it.

[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.000]
OK, make no apologies for that.

[00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:46.500]
Here's today's poll and like I've been telling you for weeks now, it's not a question of if it's a question of when.

[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.000]
And I'll tell you between March, I'll give you dates.

[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.000]
March 10th to the 20th.

[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.480]
Circle those dates on the counter.

[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.180]
I'd even be more specific but I better not do it.

[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.660]
March 10th to the 20th.

[00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.940]
That'll be when the war started.

[00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.800]
Want me to change your previous prediction?

[00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:01.960]
What was it?

[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:02.860]
First week of March.

[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.620]
Oh yeah, no, we got to put it off a little bit more than that.

[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.920]
All right.

[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:08.660]
Just a few days.

[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:14.140]
All the way possible because the you know the seventh it could be as early as the seventh, but I don't think so.

[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.220]
Because we're ready.

[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.780]
See, we have all those troops in position now.

[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.400]
We got Tommy.

[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.320]
What's his name?

[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.240]
Tommy Frank's.

[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.920]
I get confused between Tommy Thompson and Tommy Frank's and Tommy for error.

[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.560]
And Tommy Frank's is over there now.

[00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:33.400]
He's getting ready to like lead the very quick war going to go in there do it very anesthetically.

[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:42.580]
And then he's going to be like temporary is going to be the commander in chief very briefly because we don't want to piss off the Iraqis and all those factions over there.

[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.360]
And then we'll set up some democracy.

[00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.580]
And then it's going to spread from country to country like a domino effect like a fat stomino effect.

[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:51.660]
And we're going to have democracy in the Arab world.

[00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.780]
Boys and girls whether they wanted or not, you don't understand that.

[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.000]
Of course, they're going to have our form of government.

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.380]
They're going to be involved with all of our oil companies even more than they already are.

[00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.720]
It's going to be a wonderful thing.

[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:09.000]
You wavin the mercen-flag over Baghdad.

[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.360]
Basically, I think what it comes down to is we're going to make them an offer that can't refuse.

[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.620]
So here's our poll question today.

[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.160]
What's your take on the Iraq attack?

[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.520]
Five choices.

[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.020]
And I realize that maybe there's a little overlap here, but you'll have to pick your own.

[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.420]
It's kind of just like your nose.

[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.760]
It's not good to do with somebody else's.

[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:29.000]
Huh?

[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.280]
No, you have to pick your own.

[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.380]
I can't even imagine somebody picking somebody else's nose.

[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.680]
That could be the most disgusting thought that had been in my mind.

[00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:36.940]
Sure.

[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:37.460]
It goes on.

[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.940]
Oh, get out of here.

[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.520]
It goes on.

[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.240]
I'm sure it does.

[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.480]
Oh, anything you can think of, I'm sure somebody's doing it right now.

[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.820]
Yeah, in your crowd, I'm sure.

[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.520]
My crowd?

[00:11:45.620 --> 00:11:46.640]
The crowd that you hang out in.

[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.260]
I'm always a swingers and purr.

[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.980]
Oh, those, that crowd, yeah.

[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.460]
What's your take on the Iraq attack?

[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.580]
Here's your five choices.

[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.760]
It's coming, but I'm against it.

[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.020]
It's coming.

[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:56.780]
I'm all for it.

[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.480]
It's still can be avoided.

[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.740]
I have no clue, or it's mostly about oil.

[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.840]
Don't let me forget that the facts you sent me.

[00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.800]
Don't fear that great facts before we do the break.

[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.160]
A sensational fact.

[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:13.480]
Very short right to the point.

[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.980]
It says, whatever happened to the good old days,

[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.380]
when all we had to worry about was who was having sex with the president in the White House.

[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.940]
My mind and look all around.

[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.840]
Here's sports radio five sixties.

[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.640]
You ain't, you A.M.

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.800]
From the past few weeks, you've heard us talk about Flora's.

[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.720]
I tell you all kinds of things have happened in the years that they've been in business there,

[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.700]
about seven, eight hundred years, even before Columbus hit our shore.

[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.160]
And they're still going strong.

[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.280]
Stronger than ever, Flora's.

[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.060]
All the other businesses in the area long since gone waste sight.

[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.720]
And Flora's delivered because people love it.

[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.180]
Nothing in Flora's comes out of the can.

[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.080]
It's so fresh, it almost slaps you in the pus.

[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.720]
You can tell by that just made fresh taste from the sauce

[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.200]
to the freshly made pizza dough and fresh baked garlic rolls

[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.420]
that everything is made right there fresh at Flora's.

[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.380]
The portions are gigantic, and they use more cheese and meats on their pies

[00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.260]
than anybody in town you'll be walking out of there with a smile in your face

[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.960]
like a walking piece of melted-using cheese.

[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.540]
George Miguel loves it too, and I like the price here as well.

[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.220]
You'll be fighting for that last slice of pizza if it's from Flora's.

[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:06.400]
Don't take my word for it.

[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:07.540]
Find out right there for yourself.

[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.280]
731 Northe 79 Sweet-O-Piscained Boulevard.

[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.380]
Our call Flora's at 305-758-5351 for delivery.

[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.480]
That's 305-758-5351.

[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.700]
They'll deliver from 34th in Biscuit all the way to 135th in Biscuit.

[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.140]
They'll go to Quasad, Cricket Club, the Jockey Club.

[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.620]
Flora's even delivers as far west as 12th Avenue east of Collins and 71st.

[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.240]
Give them a call.

[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.420]
And if you're nice to little jutee, she'll tell you about the great pizza specials at Flora's

[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:36.940]
like 1399 for a large cheese pie, a liter of soda, and six delicious chicken wings, all of these things, only 1395.

[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:44.340]
Call Flora's now 305-758-5351, and be sure in town their close-personal pies on, old Neal told you to call.

[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.620]
We're support radio 560-2AM.

[00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:54.260]
Lick it and stick it.

[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.420]
I got the factory bag and anthrax, snoops and kitties backpats.

[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:29.940]
There's no way you'll make me dead.

[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:31.540]
Hey, call it foul.

[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.760]
You should've looked under the towel on my head.

[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.100]
Come on, people, sing along with me because this is unbelievable, huh?

[00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.400]
I've got the United States going crazy trying to convince people to attack me.

[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.180]
Except for Sean Pan, of course, who's on my side.

[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.620]
He loves me like crazy.

[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.260]
Funny little cook.

[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.640]
All get used to alive a hard knock.

[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:02.280]
When I give you the smallpox, you should've loved a little harder.

[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.520]
Silly boss, kiss the toys of this murderer.

[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.480]
Thank you very much.

[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.120]
Please, keep your way, there's no way you're safe.

[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:13.740]
Good night, Warren.

[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.380]
I guess our talk back isn't working.

[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:15.880]
Is it Carlos?

[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:20.000]
He is on the phone.

[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:23.320]
In other words, when I was screaming and yelling at him about,

[00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:24.780]
do we have a pomp and a spot?

[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.740]
I just got the copy from both of you and Steve Wolf.

[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:29.520]
I noticed he wasn't responding.

[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.140]
So either he had something to turn down.

[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:32.120]
He's out of the room voluntarily.

[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.080]
He's here now, but he was out of the room voluntarily.

[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:37.960]
Doing what?

[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:39.940]
Stuff.

[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:41.840]
During the break?

[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.780]
During the break.

[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:46.560]
Is the talk back not working?

[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.320]
Is that what you're telling me?

[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:47.820]
We don't know.

[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.700]
Anyway, do we have a, would you look on the log and see?

[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:52.440]
We have to conduct business on the year here.

[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:54.660]
And our usual typical QAM amateur hour away.

[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.480]
Because it's an amateur hour radio station.

[00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.300]
Do we have a pomp and a part spot live?

[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:00.540]
Because if we do, I'll have to do it.

[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.620]
It would be nice if you let me know.

[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.200]
There is.

[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.740]
Okay, what time would it be?

[00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:03.940]
11.

[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:04.040]
11.

[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.020]
11.

[00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:05.340]

[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:06.760]
Okay, thank you so much.

[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.960]
So I'm sitting here screaming and yelling.

[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.820]
And he's not even in there.

[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:11.380]
He's out there, too, around.

[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.500]
Probably smoking a faggot in the tea room or something.

[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.220]
That's a waste.

[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.940]
So the pool is up.

[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.620]
Yeah, you wish you were with a faggot in the tea room.

[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:20.740]
And believe me, it had building.

[00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:21.900]
Wouldn't be hard to find one.

[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.820]
15 votes on the pool.

[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:25.240]
Just one.

[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:25.900]
Now, what's your take?

[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.100]
Now, where did this extraneous stuff come from on here?

[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.540]
I'm starting to get a little testy this morning.

[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:29.940]
You know what?

[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.300]
What extraneous stuff?

[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.960]
I don't know what it is, but it's moving on.

[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.700]
I have no clue.

[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:35.560]
Is that an Eric trying to be cute?

[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.180]
I didn't write anything on there.

[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:37.820]
How about Carlos?

[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.040]
He didn't put that on there, did he?

[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:39.980]
I have no control.

[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.880]
It sounds like Eric trying to be cute to me.

[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.700]
I've got news for Eric.

[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.560]
I've seen you and you are not cute.

[00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.020]
Okay?

[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.860]
Believe me by any stretch of anyone's imagination, you are not cute.

[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:50.940]
Speak it up, Eric.

[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.700]
He wanted to know whether we should put the freak message on the pool.

[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.840]
I thought he had a very busy agenda, Eric.

[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.960]
Tell him just to get the crap up there, which he already has.

[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:01.860]
He doesn't go on with his life.

[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.680]
Go about his business.

[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.640]
It would be a real good idea.

[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:04.500]
Thanks very much, Eric.

[00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:05.460]
But get lost.

[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:06.040]
Okay?

[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:06.540]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:07.940]
Over-involved.

[00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.200]
This is why we have these problems.

[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.180]
We have too many people.

[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.960]
What's that old saying about too many cooks for the broth?

[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.420]
Too many chiefs and not enough Indians.

[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:16.800]
They say that too.

[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.260]
We haven't had one call yet about our QA and billboards yet.

[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.600]
Now, I realize it was a buggy this morning.

[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.580]
Probably good, because there's so...

[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:30.020]
Now, Duff has emailed me copies of both mine, which I don't know if they're up yet.

[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:33.500]
And also the generic one, which is on 441 North of Sheridan Street.

[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:34.280]
Okay.

[00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.380]
By where they have insurance, do you know what I used to be in a card either ship or I could use your coons forward or whatever that was?

[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.760]
You know what I'm talking about?

[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.480]
Yeah, I know exactly.

[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.240]
Coen and Coen used to be there, or so.

[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:46.720]
Anyway, not one call.

[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:48.520]
Anyway, see, Henry Souther's QA and billboards.

[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.240]
They really look neat.

[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:49.920]
They're very impressive.

[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.220]
We finally got billboards.

[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.620]
They'll put that goddamn default to shame on it.

[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.700]
Anch-knit.

[00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.060]
Fifteen votes.

[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.680]
It's mostly about oil six.

[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:00.520]
It's coming.

[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.140]
I'm all for it for, meaning the war.

[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:02.980]
It's coming.

[00:18:03.100 --> 00:18:03.980]
I'm against it three.

[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.160]
I have no clue.

[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:06.960]
Two.

[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.000]
And then last and certainly least.

[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.120]
That's changing again.

[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:10.920]
Oh, 40 votes.

[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.060]
It still can be avoided one.

[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:13.880]
Well, I hit the right to the hostias.

[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.900]
Still can be avoided voter.

[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:24.400]
But in meetings Monday with senior officials in Moscow, under Secretary of State John Bolton told the Russian government that we're going ahead whether they security council agrees or not.

[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.020]
Yeah.

[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.860]
A senior administration official said the council's unity is at stake here.

[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.340]
In other words, we're going to go do it whether you like it or not.

[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.500]
Well, it's a done deal.

[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.320]
The decisions are even made a long time ago.

[00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:41.100]
A senior diplomat from another council member said his government had heard a similar message and was told not to anguish over whether to vote for war.

[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.460]
You're not going to decide whether there's war in Iraq or not that diplomat said US officials told him.

[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.120]
The decision is ours and we've already made it.

[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.520]
It's already final.

[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.360]
The only question now is whether the council will go along with it.

[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.240]
And you want to know why he went back to the security council for a second vote?

[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:55.920]
I give up.

[00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:57.980]
As a favor to Tony Blair.

[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.840]
Who's getting grilled by parliament today as we speak, I should point out.

[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.660]
And he did that as a favor to me because he's in political hot water.

[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:05.640]
He's up to his earlobes.

[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.460]
The British public are overwhelming against this.

[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:18.340]
And so to try to save his buddy Tony Blair's political ass, he agreed as a favor to go back because like this says very clearly whether they security council agrees or not.

[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.700]
We don't give a crap.

[00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:29.040]
It's just a question of whether they're going to convince the world that they are meaningful, which means they agree with us or that they've rendered themselves impotent and useless.

[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.440]
So this continues more of the saying.

[00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.380]
Either you were this or you're an evil doer and you're against this and we're going to go ahead and do whatever we want anyway.

[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.020]
All this other stuff has been a dog and pony show.

[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.000]
All the inspections have been a dog and pony show.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:42.280]
Right.

[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.060]
Whether they have something, whether they have nothing, whether they got a lot, whether they got a little it makes no difference.

[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]
The die has been cast.

[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.020]
If you catch my drift.

[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.640]
I just mentioned that in past.

[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:56.760]
Yeah, we knew that though.

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.620]
I know that but I'm just using it again in response to that.

[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:06.520]
I put it on there because I'm sure that we have some naive people out there including this one well meaning person says work can still be avoided.

[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.700]
And that's why all these people are doing this virtual marketing today.

[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.420]
People will say, hey, let's cut the crap.

[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.180]
We don't know what's going to happen.

[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.060]
We do know that Robert Blake is going to be in court today.

[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.020]
Yeah, he didn't do nothing.

[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.000]
He's also going to be on with your friend Barbara.

[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.420]
Why?

[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.000]
He even was a trying to crazy about it.

[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:31.540]
The attorney was on last night and he said, I don't have any idea what he said or what he's going to say because I'll have to watch it on TV.

[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:36.880]
He wouldn't allow me to watch it to be privy to it.

[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.320]
Oh, you're good, buddy.

[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.460]
I know why you don't look at all the calls coming in about those two.

[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:44.860]
Oh, I know.

[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.320]
Or is there anything in general as a matter of fact, I beg your pardon?

[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:48.440]
Anything about anything.

[00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:51.080]
Well, we had that Alan from four miles from work.

[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:52.220]
I mean, you want that was a good start.

[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.900]
I thought let's have him on for an hour.

[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:56.180]
And then we're going to have Lynn Samuels is going to call in today.

[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:57.900]
In fact, Lynn could probably do the whole show today.

[00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.580]
My throat's a little bit on the raw side still.

[00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:03.040]
I feel a lot better, but I still have, you know, cold doesn't go away in two or three days.

[00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:06.500]
You know, muff keeps acting like, I don't know what his story is.

[00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:07.600]
I already have one mother.

[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.120]
Okay, muff.

[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:09.400]
I already got one.

[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:11.160]
You know, you have a cold.

[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.460]
He said, well, so a little testy.

[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.080]
I'm not testy.

[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.840]
I'm just, you know, every day cold gets a little bit better.

[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.780]
It's a cool, I had cold.

[00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:17.900]
That's all a little head.

[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.980]
He should know something about that.

[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:20.660]
Right?

[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:21.980]
No, come on.

[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.660]
No, but seriously, acting just like my mother or something.

[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.300]
I already got one nagging.

[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.220]
Oh, bitch.

[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.020]
And I see you said that.

[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:32.360]
That's terrible, but I certainly would echo that.

[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:35.780]
WQA, too.

[00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:36.720]
Anybody on there?

[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.860]
We're going to do a quick screen listen.

[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:38.660]
Put them on right away.

[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:39.800]
Not even anybody on there.

[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.460]
So, but only I don't think those billboards are really up.

[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.400]
I think this is just another one of those kind of games that they're going to have.

[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.480]
They're the little captured photographs that you got.

[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.260]
No, they're not captured photographs.

[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.120]
They just did like a bumper sticker.

[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.740]
Like they had one, a couple of made, you know?

[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:52.180]
Yeah.

[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.780]
And he took a picture of it and put it on an email.

[00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.520]
Oh, here, look at this.

[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.840]
I saw myself was really great.

[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:59.600]
And then he told me he forgot to see what the mine was up on I-95.

[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.000]
On I-95 and what?

[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.020]
I don't know.

[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.380]
He wasn't that specific.

[00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.040]
I see.

[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:07.420]
Then there's a great column here.

[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.940]
I don't think I sent this to you, did I?

[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.240]
Why?

[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:11.620]
Because we got so many bedtime stories.

[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.780]
We probably don't have room for this.

[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:13.920]
Oh, yeah, I did send it.

[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.920]
Liberal talk radio.

[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.060]
It'll fly like a dodo.

[00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:17.860]
Yeah, you said it.

[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.440]
It's going to be on Nichols in the Madison Capitol times.

[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:21.920]
Exactly what I've been telling you.

[00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:23.000]
There's no market for it.

[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:23.720]
Look at Donahue.

[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.920]
He couldn't get an audience with a butterfly net.

[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.480]
If he had a group of people going out there and capturing him and forcing him like in clockwork

[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:36.660]
orange, prop it or eyelids open with toothpicks and forcing them to watch in a kneel-set home.

[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.140]
He still couldn't get an audience.

[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:39.860]
There's no market for it.

[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:42.500]
I think I might read this a little bit later if my voice holds up.

[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.600]
And then in case Dennis is listening, which I have my doubts, no, great.

[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.280]
But just in case, we don't want to let him down.

[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.080]
Former New Hampshire priest charged with molesting two boys.

[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.880]
Another one of those goddamn stories.

[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:57.600]
Are you turning a microscope onto the Catholic church again because you know that we're keeping it on.

[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.240]
Yes, because you've been calling it a pull a couple of days ago of all the things that they're tired of hearing about

[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.380]
that was way down near the bottom.

[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.900]
They want to hear a lot more about that.

[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.180]
They want it all screaming and kicking dragged out of the closet.

[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:09.940]
Whether Dennis likes it or not.

[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:14.620]
Because of course he can't handle it being an emotional cripple, having been so brainwashed as a, as a child.

[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:16.500]
My life and love.

[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.900]
This is 4.305.60.

[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.380]
Tom Laman and Joe Prieto of Halette Potty Act GMC are proud to announce three great Neil Rogers,

[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:25.920]
Neil Deal.

[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.000]
So much info your ear right to the radio, especially on this station, and might crack a little bit.

[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.920]
Neil Deal number one, get 0% financing and all GMC 1500 series pickups.

[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.980]
You heard me write 0% and all 1500 series pickups.

[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:43.500]
Neil Deal number two, Lisa GMC on Voyfer just $299 bucks a month plus tax for 48 months.

[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.140]
That's correct. You heard the numbers right.

[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.900]
Only $299 a month plus tax.

[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.360]
And Neil Deal number three, by you a Pontiac vibe for just $199 bucks a month.

[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.500]
That's right only $199 a month for a great Pontiac vibe.

[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.840]
Halette's also got great Neil deals on use car trucks and SUVs.

[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.280]
And if your credit rating is one of the worst in the history of mankind, have no fear because Halette will get you deals some way somehow,

[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:04.960]
even if George has to make the payments.

[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:06.660]
Might as well make somebody's.

[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.780]
It's a great Neil Deal triple letter going on right now in Halette 134-1 South Fixie Highway.

[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:16.760]
That's US one across from the falls open every day, seven days a week for more info called the Neil Deal Hotline Tool Free.

[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.700]
1-885-3-4-4-4-2-11.

[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.180]
That's 1-885-3-4-4-4-2-11.

[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.180]
Don't forget all Neil deals.

[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.520]
Our subject to credit approval see dealer for details.

[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.400]
Halette Pontiac GMC who shot from the rooftops.

[00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.200]
We are professional grade.

[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.140]
My life and law.

[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.520]
This is 4-3-0-5-60.

[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.660]
You weigh in.

[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:41.660]
You Q&A! Go fuck yourself!

[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:44.120]
Meet Joe.

[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.420]
He's rich.

[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:46.800]
He's handsome.

[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.200]
He has great taste in furniture.

[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.960]
And he has 20 beautiful women interested in him.

[00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:54.900]
But there's a twist.

[00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.300]
He's not interested in them.

[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:00.360]
It's Joe Homo Sexual.

[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.900]
Fox's newest reality romance show.

[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.760]
See what happens when he's lovely and he's trying to get Joe's switch teams.

[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:09.100]
But he didn't want to talk to me at all.

[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.100]
He just wanted to say more pictures of my brother.

[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.200]
Don't miss Joe Homo Sexual.

[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.620]
We were supposed to have her romantic dinner together alone.

[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:21.920]
But I didn't know he was also bringing Cliff his friend.

[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.340]
And be sure to catch the final episode of Joe Homo Sexual when Joe pops the big question.

[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.100]
Sandra?

[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.380]
Yes, Joe.

[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.920]
Would you...

[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:34.420]
Leave me a clip alone for a few minutes.

[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.180]
Whatever.

[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.400]
Joe Homo Sexual.

[00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.380]
Right after Boston Public Bad House.

[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.640]
Only on Fox.

[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.260]
9-31-560-W-Q-A-M.

[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.240]
We apologize for Neil having a cold and a bad throat, so I'm filling in.

[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:45.940]
And George too.

[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.600]
And thank God Lynn called like right off the bat early in the show so we don't have to sit around and holding our breath.

[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.140]
Well, I heard my name.

[00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:55.760]
Yeah.

[00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.480]
So I responded.

[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.980]
You're in Florida. I can't believe it.

[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:01.320]
I love Florida.

[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:02.640]
Yeah, you're the one.

[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.020]
I'm the one... well, you know I'm old.

[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.280]
Yeah.

[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.480]
And I live in New York, you know.

[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:10.380]
I don't want it.

[00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.800]
It's not as it's called. It's sour, but I never get to go out.

[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.680]
It's sunny here, sweetheart.

[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:18.620]
It's 20 below zero Celsius. It's minus four Fahrenheit.

[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.060]
It's colder than a witch's behind.

[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.700]
And you don't mind. See, it's wherever you live.

[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:23.640]
Yeah.

[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.220]
Yeah, I hate wherever you live.

[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.240]
Is that what it is?

[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.360]
I think that's what it is.

[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:28.620]
I sure hate it there. I'll say that.

[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.960]
I think it's a crib.

[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.760]
I tell you hate it if I live here.

[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:37.160]
Now you didn't see. I know you didn't because I already emailed you on this.

[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.260]
You didn't see Gourphidella on the crossfire last night.

[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.260]
No, I didn't.

[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:46.800]
You know they replay every other show on CNN later on except not crossfire.

[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.440]
Thank goodness.

[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.680]
Because you probably wouldn't be among the living right now.

[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.640]
You had to probably blown your brains out if you saw that.

[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:56.460]
Why does somebody with his brilliance, with his intellect,

[00:26:56.700 --> 00:26:58.900]
although he is looking very, very old and fidgety and nervous?

[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.100]
But why does somebody with his brilliance, the mean himself by going on there?

[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.620]
Because all they do on that show now is use people as props.

[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.580]
And Carve last night, the veins in his forehead were popping out.

[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:13.820]
He and Carlson said they're in scream and scream and a holler

[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:15.640]
in a desperate attempt to get some audience.

[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:18.380]
And all they did was use Gourphidella as a prop.

[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:20.180]
And he just sat there like, what happened to me?

[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.660]
It was very sad.

[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.000]
See, because Carve was supposed to be on the left,

[00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:26.440]
but he's the tool of the establishment too.

[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:31.880]
Yeah, but he's the tool of the entertainment establishment.

[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.200]
And that's all that that show is all about.

[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.900]
It's got nothing to do with politics or with personal convictions.

[00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.560]
It's only got to do it like, let's put on a big show and get crazy

[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:41.060]
and see if we can get some numbers here.

[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.540]
But they have no ratings.

[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:44.080]
CNN?

[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:47.720]
The crossfire, CNN has ratings for us.

[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.700]
Fire has no ratings.

[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.820]
Nobody launches it.

[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.640]
They don't do too bad.

[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:54.240]
Well, they're too better than Donna Hughes.

[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.560]
They still have a job.

[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.360]
Yeah.

[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:58.780]
Poor Phil, did you see Rosie?

[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.000]
No.

[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:02.840]
You know, like Rosie anyway.

[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:03.600]
No, I don't.

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.120]
She's a disgusting pig, a cow.

[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.340]
But she was so great with Donna Hughes.

[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.140]
She was so great against the war.

[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:11.440]
She was one to die.

[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:12.580]
Look, look, look, look.

[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:15.060]
Because I agree with her about guns and award doesn't mean

[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:15.740]
that I like her.

[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.380]
And there are a lot of people that may have that opinion.

[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:18.220]
Does mean I like them.

[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:18.920]
She's disgusting.

[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.080]
She's nauseating.

[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.500]
And she's leaving Florida.

[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:23.100]
Oh, thank God.

[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.020]
There's the best news I've heard in years.

[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.060]
Leave it to Len Sandwell to give us a good piece of news.

[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.780]
Rosie O'Donnell, next if you can tell us that OG is leaving,

[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.480]
we'll have a party.

[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]
We'll have a parade in the streets.

[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.420]
Well, she's leaving as she's trying to sell the mansion.

[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.420]
You know, it's so hard these days to sell those mansions.

[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.020]
Yeah, I know.

[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:40.220]
Well, times are tough now that she's no more magazine,

[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.240]
no more TV show.

[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:42.960]
But she's leaving.

[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:45.700]
She doesn't want to bring up her children in a state

[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:47.720]
with the thumbs of Wild Gay adoption.

[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.060]
Why didn't she adopt like that?

[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.520]
Well, she's going to be a good idea.

[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:54.740]
And because I think her girlfriend doesn't want anymore.

[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.400]
Yeah.

[00:28:56.060 --> 00:28:58.340]
I think her girlfriend thinks that they have enough.

[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.000]
What do they have for?

[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:01.580]
I don't know.

[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.720]
I have stopped counting.

[00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:03.900]
I really don't know and I don't care.

[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.140]
I really feel sorry for them, be honest with him.

[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.280]
Well, they have a mansion in upstate New York.

[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.920]
She's selling her fancy New York apartment too.

[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.040]
Yeah.

[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.140]
She's just going to stay in NYAC.

[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.880]
And you know, she'd go on Hell in Hays' old house.

[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:21.300]
Now, did you inherit like millions of dollars

[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.400]
sometime along the way because, you know,

[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.840]
WABC screwed you over in Canter-S.

[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.880]
And now you're doing that weekend thing on that Long Island station,

[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.140]
WLE, that nobody, is that the name of the station?

[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:31.500]
Yes.

[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.380]
That's the Long Island Expressway, not the Lai.

[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.160]
Yeah.

[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:37.740]
Oh, is that what that stands for?

[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.760]
That is the big lie.

[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.840]
We sort of meant Lai, but we don't have to.

[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.920]
That's what we're going to change in a QA Amul's

[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.640]
Steeler Collarers.

[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.140]
WLE, we lie a lot.

[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:47.080]
That would be good for us.

[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:47.680]
That's what it works.

[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.220]
We want to change their quality.

[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.140]
So, how many people actually get to hear you on that station?

[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.080]
Not many.

[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.380]
They're only 1,100 Watts, but you know,

[00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:01.360]
Alan Cone's new radio shows on that station too.

[00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:01.980]
Yeah.

[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:02.760]
Have you met him?

[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.080]
Oh, Alan, I know Alan for years.

[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.740]
There he is.

[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:06.740]

[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.760]
I'll tell you what they need.

[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.280]
The other one.

[00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.640]
You know, I like him.

[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:13.200]
He's a nice guy, but he's supposed to be a liberal.

[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:15.200]
And he's just such a wimp in a woods.

[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.240]
Wimp in a woods.

[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:16.880]
That's right.

[00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.360]
Who was that old guy that used to be on Crossfire?

[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.640]
That the old guy with a white hair that looked like he was

[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.480]
who had one foot in the grave.

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.740]
He looked like Alan, our first caller this morning from 4 am.

[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.240]
Oh, I forgot when it was really the beginning of Crossfire.

[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:33.080]
Yeah, they had Michael Kinzley on for a while who was really wimpy and torpy.

[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.060]
And then they had this old guy who was supposed to be liberal.

[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.960]
And he used to like snooze in the middle of the show.

[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.180]
He'd fall asleep on camera.

[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.260]
I forget who it was.

[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.620]
I didn't have cable TV.

[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.580]
So anyway, you love this article.

[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.600]
A liberal talk radio.

[00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.700]
It'll fly like a dodo by John Nichols in the Madison Capitol Times.

[00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:48.940]
It's on a common dream's website.

[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.800]
And he's right on target.

[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:51.900]
There's no market for it.

[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.520]
I mean, I know you'd like for a market because you'd get onto it.

[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.040]
Which would be great, but there isn't any market.

[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.500]
I'd get on to it.

[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.620]
What are they looking for?

[00:30:58.900 --> 00:30:59.820]
They want to house mine.

[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.960]
And they don't want anybody who actually knows how to do radio.

[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:03.740]
Yeah.

[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.400]
They're not looking for you.

[00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:07.620]
They're not looking for me.

[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.440]
They're looking for stars.

[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.140]
And you know what else I think?

[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.920]
I'm sure you figured this out.

[00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.420]
Did they want somebody who's going to just give the Democrat party wine?

[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:17.980]
Right.

[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:21.340]
You know, they want somebody to repeat whatever, you know,

[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.360]
Tom Daschel is thinking that day.

[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.440]
Well, I wouldn't do that.

[00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.780]
And neither would I.

[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.600]
So, you know, we don't, you know, we don't fit in.

[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:35.300]
We like to miss it.

[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.320]
Yeah, you're right.

[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:37.960]
Two missfits.

[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.820]
That's why we email back in 420-30 times today because nobody else will speak to either one of us.

[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.440]
That's why we don't know.

[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:44.360]
I never go out.

[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:45.120]
Yeah.

[00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:48.480]
I mean, here when I'm here, yeah, I go away on the beach.

[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:50.360]
But in New York, I also want to go out.

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.160]
I've got to keep your eyes open, honey.

[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.900]
If you're going to lay on the beach and mine me beach.

[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:55.260]
Listen, Adam.

[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.800]
We want to keep you alive.

[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.040]
They might run your ass over.

[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.740]
In fact, it might be some of those right wingers.

[00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.480]
They say, oops, that was at Lynn Sandwell's beach.

[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:02.300]
We just ran over.

[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.100]
Yeah, well, I'm not as easy to run over as those girls.

[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.100]
You know, they were pretty like slapped to the beach.

[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:08.640]
Yeah.

[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.100]
You know, well, maybe, you know, I'm still on the beach.

[00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:12.820]
I'm kind of chubby.

[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:14.120]
They were French, too.

[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:14.580]
Don't forget.

[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.640]
Yes, they're probably going.

[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.080]
How do you say stop in French?

[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:20.720]
You know, I'm hoping it was only an accident.

[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.400]
But I do keep in mind that they were French.

[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.820]
Now, the new deal is that up in Palm Beach County,

[00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:27.360]
did you see this story in the Sun Sentinel?

[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:29.080]
Or you wouldn't see the Sun Sentinel where you are?

[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.140]
French fries are feet in the heat in Palm Beach County.

[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.680]
County Commissioner Bert Erinzen wants to go after a French fries.

[00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.460]
He says he won't even mention the name.

[00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:42.480]
He wants to change the name to Freedom Fries or American Fries.

[00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.500]
I mean, with all the other things that are going on in the world,

[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.740]
this is the kind of silly asses we have running the government in South Florida.

[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.240]
Now, it's very important.

[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:52.840]
That's nearly as important as the Lover Blake interview tonight.

[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.520]
Yeah, I'll call it pretty close.

[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.400]
I think Freedom Fries didn't stop when I had the story on my website.

[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.140]
I think it started in North Carolina.

[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.940]
And now they just all copying.

[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:04.300]
Yeah, filtered down.

[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:07.320]
Now they're just getting on the Freedom Fries bandwagon.

[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.440]
And it's when McDonald's does it that we know we're in big trouble.

[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.980]
McDonald's got their own crosses to bear.

[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.840]
Well, why?

[00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:18.820]
Just because you go in there, I don't know about down here, but New York.

[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.360]
You go in and you say like a double cheeseburger.

[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.640]
And they say, oh, you'll have to wait.

[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.880]
They never have anything cooked.

[00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.560]
And you go, well, this is supposed to be like fast food.

[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.240]
Because it isn't good.

[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.080]
So you're not supposed to have to stand there for five minutes while they cook the flies.

[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:40.980]
Cook the hamburger.

[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.980]
Well, and then that's what Burger King thought that they were going to get them on.

[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:46.480]
That whole business about having it your way.

[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.960]
And all this business about whole the pickles, whole the lettuce, special orders,

[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:50.860]
don't have a sauce for the dinner.

[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.160]

[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.620]
And then they come to find out that it was okay that you get whatever you want.

[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.300]
But it tasted like rubber.

[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.040]
Like they were slicing up good-year tires.

[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.620]
Well, they won't taste like it.

[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:01.900]
But the whole point of that food is just for the fat.

[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.500]
That's what tastes good, the fat.

[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:07.620]
They want to just like sell the fat.

[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.700]
Fat on a bun sounds good.

[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.440]
That said, it sounds good to me.

[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:14.300]
I'll make an alcohol steamer like that when you're through the oven.

[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.720]
Every time I sit down, I say, there's fat on a bun.

[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:25.020]
Doesn't it sound like she's looking like she's auditioning to fill in for the next summer?

[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:25.560]
Sure.

[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:27.200]
Come on down.

[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.200]
I'm not that gorgeous, John.

[00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:32.240]
I'm not a very uncompetitive person.

[00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:33.600]
That's the problem.

[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.760]
And I don't, well, being a woman doesn't help either.

[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.840]
You know, not that I want to get into that feminist.

[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.460]
I don't understand why you didn't fire.

[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.260]
Maybe you did.

[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:41.620]
I don't know.

[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:43.400]
File a big lawsuit against WABC.

[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:45.980]
I'm thinking of it.

[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.560]
But you can't prove anything.

[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:48.520]
Okay, hold on.

[00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:49.380]
Let me do the break.

[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.540]
When we come back, I want to encourage you to sue their ass.

[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.380]
Then I'll get, I'll take my share, okay?

[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.000]
Okay.

[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:54.800]
Hold on.

[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.940]
Yeah, let's keep laying on it for a while, okay?

[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.560]
But what about all these other calls?

[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.240]
That's my point.

[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:02.800]
That's my point.

[00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.440]
This is Portrait of I-60.

[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.620]
You ain't way, damn.

[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.380]
And beat that Gator me.

[00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:13.840]
In this fast-paced, hurry up world.

[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.160]
You need all the energy you can get.

[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:16.840]
That's why there's new triple-caf coffee.

[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.180]
Triple-caf has three times the caffeine of regular coffee

[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:20.740]
to give you a real boost when you need it.

[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.860]
So if you're a doctor, Triple-caf really helps me focus.

[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:23.460]
Scuffle.

[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:24.360]
I said, Cabo Dammit.

[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:24.800]
A teacher.

[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:28.440]
Johnny, run to the teacher's lounge and get me another mug of Triple-caf.

[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.460]
Just bring the whole pot and the rest of you.

[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.160]
Shut up!

[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:31.900]
Or airline pilot.

[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.920]
Get the stamp, play going fast fast.

[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.340]
Swish to new Triple-caf coffee.

[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.040]
It's Triple-good.

[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.640]
In fact, I'm going to have some more right now.

[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.940]
Where's my fucking mug?

[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.920]
946 at 560 WQM Lynn Samuels is on with us on the phone for a little bit

[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.960]
because she's in about a beach.

[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:47.100]
Getting ready to go out and bake in the sun.

[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:47.860]
And fry.

[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.920]
Fry like a beached whale.

[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.200]
Yes, that's perfect.

[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.180]
Oh, you've seen me.

[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.480]
You know, we could all lose 40 or 50 pounds.

[00:35:58.660 --> 00:35:58.900]
Good morning.

[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.060]
You bet you.

[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:00.800]
We certainly could.

[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.140]
I don't want to say that I had some less lethal ice cream in the video.

[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:03.560]
You'll get worse.

[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:07.140]
I don't look for that all over New York.

[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.960]
And I know I'm never going to find it.

[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:09.540]
Sorry.

[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.320]
Best thing that ever happened is not finding it.

[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:14.300]
And we ask them to.

[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.860]
Is it like hands and caramel and everything?

[00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:19.200]
Getting back to WABC.

[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.540]
I don't want to talk about food.

[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.880]
I don't want to do that because then you go out and you'll go on a binge and you'll blame me for it.

[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:27.040]
Now, what actually happened there on WABC?

[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.140]
Can we talk about this?

[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.400]
Well, yes.

[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.360]
They've paid me that extra 13 weeks, the six weeks they had to pay me.

[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.420]
I can say anything.

[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.240]
Okay.

[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:43.300]
They just called me up and said, we're canceling your show because we can't afford you.

[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:46.880]
It's budget cuts.

[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:47.680]
Yeah.

[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.460]
And I said excuse me.

[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:51.680]
I worked one day a week.

[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.380]
You know, I made like $25,000.

[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:56.820]
This is Disney.

[00:36:57.220 --> 00:36:57.460]
Right.

[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:02.380]
And I said, but I have higher ratings than, well, I don't want to mention.

[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.160]
You know, she should have talked to you, Jordan.

[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.260]
I said, yeah.

[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.840]
You know, I have higher ratings than certain other people.

[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.020]
Yeah, why can't you say who you're talking about?

[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.820]
Why don't you be a word?

[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.280]
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.300]
Oh, I guess he did.

[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.400]
Mark C. Moan.

[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.740]
You know, Mark C. Moan?

[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.560]
We don't even have any idea who that was.

[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.160]
Well, he does.

[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:27.460]
So, somebody says, well, I have higher ratings than him.

[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:33.720]
I have higher ratings than the guy Steve's weekend show.

[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.240]
I have really great ratings for the weekend.

[00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:37.900]
Right.

[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:45.260]
And he just, you know, my boy, Mr. Boyce, just kept saying, well, we can't afford it.

[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:47.380]
It's just budget cuts, budget cuts.

[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:49.060]
And that was it.

[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.600]
And so how do you know the real reason why they can't you?

[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.000]
Well, I don't.

[00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.020]
That's why I probably can't sue them.

[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:59.260]
Because they gave one reason.

[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.740]
Now, I think, bashing Bush and, you know, reminding everybody,

[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.280]
the weekend, the week he wasn't even elected, leading us into war,

[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:13.240]
taking the economy down the clapper, you know, looking back nostalgicly,

[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.720]
you know, with Monica and, you know, everything going on, you know,

[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.840]
goes for the glory days, weren't they?

[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:20.340]
Make sure work compared to this.

[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.120]
You better believe it.

[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.960]
We were happy everybody had money.

[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.520]
If we had no war, you know, Clinton was trying to make peace.

[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.280]
You know, whatever holiday he is, that one.

[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:35.540]
So, I think that, and, you know, I'm not Georgia, I'm just you won't.

[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:37.880]
I'm not like the biggest fan of Israel.

[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.880]
So, I think all those things, you know, kind of,

[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.560]
kind of, I wouldn't like it.

[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.660]
I mean, Georgia would like that, and I wouldn't like it.

[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.660]
I ripped them in ashes today right here on the show.

[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:50.220]
I gave a good one, as a matter of fact.

[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.260]
You're damn right, and then.

[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.740]
I don't think I'm more like even further than you.

[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.620]
I should have more like with Georgia.

[00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.720]
So, in other words, you're becoming an anti-Semitic Jew in your old ages,

[00:38:58.740 --> 00:38:59.220]
is that what you're saying?

[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:00.480]
Well, you know, they've been...

[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.860]
Anti-right wing religious phenomena.

[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:02.700]
I'll tell you one thing.

[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.880]
If you do move this out, Florida, you'll become anti-Semitic in about a week and a half.

[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:06.620]
I guarantee you that.

[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:11.220]
Oh, every time I go into publics, what is with them running into you with their shopping cart?

[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.160]
What is with that?

[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.140]
It's the demolition, Derby.

[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.200]
She hasn't heard about the ankle paramedics in publics yet, right?

[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.860]
They're standing by to help you out.

[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:23.220]
It's like amazing, because that's something it doesn't happen in New York.

[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:23.700]
Oh, you're...

[00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.560]
There's one thing that's happened in New York, but you can go into a supermarket

[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.220]
without having the people just bashing you with those cars.

[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.260]
So, that's why that.

[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.960]
I mean, you know, so they said they fired me for budget reasons,

[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:43.360]
but it's interesting that they fired glory or red or a KABC around the same time.

[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:49.840]
And they fired the Washington DC station, WMAL, the ABC station.

[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.960]
They had a liberal woman named Victoria Jones and they fired her.

[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:58.580]
So it did look like a purge of liberal women.

[00:39:59.040 --> 00:39:59.240]
Hmm.

[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:02.420]
Just another series of coincidences.

[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.740]
Yeah, probably.

[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.240]
You know, it was just, you know, happened by accident.

[00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:10.720]
You know, when people I call the couple of lawyers and you know what they all say?

[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:13.540]
You should never sue for sex discrimination.

[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.660]
Because I'm just going to sue, you know, because I'm a woman.

[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.620]
They all say it's better to do it for age.

[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:22.180]
How about both?

[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.480]
How about being an old woman?

[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:25.100]
Yeah, well, that's good, you know.

[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:25.940]
How about being an old woman?

[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.060]
I've seen in that category.

[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:29.320]
And old Jewish woman and old Babitsky.

[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:29.860]
How about that?

[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:30.760]
That would be an original lawsuit.

[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.480]
Yeah, they have Jews on ABC.

[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:35.900]
They have put their up to their behind in Jews.

[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.020]
Don't let Disney out.

[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.260]
Guarantee of Disney were still alive.

[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:39.420]
He'd be rolling in his grave.

[00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:42.020]
But they're a little white wing Jews.

[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:42.580]
Yeah.

[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.540]
I think that doesn't mean far enough to the right.

[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.340]
If you get further to the right, it whites out your Jewishness.

[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.220]
You go?

[00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:51.620]
Yeah, that could be it, like Richard Pearl.

[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.560]
Ah, Pearl, well, for what I guess.

[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.040]
All of those guys.

[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.620]
Ah, so I don't know.

[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.200]
Plus, you know, people keep saying,

[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.700]
my wife's there, radio station.

[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.580]
How can you sue them?

[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.940]
And they can do anything they want.

[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.500]
I'd love it if I could sue them and get money.

[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.500]
I'd move down here.

[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:12.660]
You were one of the few people that really enjoyed last year,

[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.040]
unless you were just making it up.

[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:17.220]
About when I was reading on the ear for four hours every day

[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.100]
doing those bed times through.

[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.820]
Is you about one of the, what of a handful?

[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:20.580]
I know.

[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:22.760]
He'd charge and enjoy it because it meant he didn't have to do anything.

[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:23.000]

[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:25.000]
I know, I just like it.

[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.340]
But it's not, you know, I never, I hardly ever read

[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.500]
articles on the air.

[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.180]
Yeah, the audience hated it.

[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.520]
I know, that's why I hardly ever do it.

[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.940]
And when I do it, I insert my own comments about every three words.

[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:37.660]
Yeah.

[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.380]
That article I have up today, that Robert's fifth thing about CNN,

[00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:43.780]
how CNN is going to censor the warn news.

[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:44.840]
Yeah, I got that.

[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:46.080]
Yeah, it's a great article.

[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.020]
It's like I got a community.

[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.800]
The whole audience, you know, would be in a coma in five minutes.

[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.580]
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.280]
Yeah, I have to trust them that they're going to read it themselves.

[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.660]
But they're not, they're not going to read it.

[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.680]
Are you, my audience, you've heard the calls that I get.

[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.900]
Now you tell me you get intellectual cars in New York.

[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:02.580]
What did you do?

[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.700]
I used to.

[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:12.120]
I did, at ABC, WABC was like not such a stupid station when I went there, you know, like 14 years ago.

[00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.600]
And even, you know, maybe eight or nine years ago.

[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:20.840]
But the more they put on, like just white wing propaganda, the more any audience

[00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.680]
with a brain stops listening.

[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:27.900]
You know, so I did use to get pretty smart calls, but not toward the end.

[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.280]
You know, then you jidow, how can you insult Bush?

[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:33.540]
Why don't you forget that he wasn't elected?

[00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:40.080]
You know, forget this is the only president ever put in office by the Supreme Court.

[00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:43.360]
Pretend that happened all the time.

[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.860]
Yeah, that's why they dated Brock Booker so good because it's got a whole background

[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.220]
of the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas story and what really happened.

[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:53.820]
Well, there's so much in that book that's not true, Neil, that I don't know what I can trust.

[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:54.960]
Well, such as what?

[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.480]
Well, I don't know such as comments about a friend of mine.

[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.980]
It couldn't be mad drudge, could it?

[00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:04.740]
Well, it could be.

[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.320]
Yeah.

[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.320]
Well, so none of that is true.

[00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:11.740]
So it really did, you know, kind of makes me distrust the brunt.

[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.700]
So in other words, he made all those stories up?

[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.540]
I would think so.

[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.480]
Yeah, well then why doesn't Matt Suom if he made that stuff up?

[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:23.160]
Because when you're a public figure, you know how haunted is to sue somebody.

[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:24.060]
Yeah.

[00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:25.580]
So why bother?

[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:30.300]
So proof that it, now Tom Cruise got millions of dollars for it.

[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.320]
Yeah, but you know, nobody read the book anyway.

[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.280]
Well, it's at the David Brock Book.

[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.720]
Yeah, I mean, it didn't do that well.

[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.340]
It was what on the best soloist for like a couple of weeks.

[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:46.520]
So in other words, you don't believe the stories about how they used him to destroy Anita Hill and the...

[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:51.520]
You know, you just, I don't know, obviously they used him, you know,

[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.980]
because they would use anybody.

[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:59.300]
But you know, there it is just because when you know some of the people somebody's writing about it,

[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:05.340]
and you know that he's lying, the political stuff I believe most of once in the book,

[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.600]
you know, the political, even that story, who is the Dora Ingram, supposedly drunk,

[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.740]
crawling on the floor?

[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:12.260]
Right.

[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:15.900]
Yeah, well see that kind of stuff I just go, all right David.

[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:26.880]
And you know, he was an immense institution, Raleigh was writing it as something which kind of takes away from his credibility.

[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.840]
I think it adds to it.

[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:29.620]
Oh, you do?

[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.780]
Well, he probably won't say it.

[00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.500]
I don't.

[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.940]
Kacer Ross-Sarrar, you know, I guess we'll just pick and choose whatever it sounds good, you know, we'll believe that in the book.

[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.120]
No, I believe so, but you know what the best book is?

[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.360]
Did you read the hunting of the president?

[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.080]
No.

[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.080]
Oh my God.

[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:51.040]
Oh, you've got to, I mean it's old, I don't even know if you could even still get it.

[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.560]
It's Joe Connison and Gene Lyons.

[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.160]
Yeah.

[00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:05.580]
And it's the history from way back in Arkansas how they went after Bill Clinton, you know, like only maniacs like you and me could even get to read that book.

[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:16.160]
But it's got everything going back, you know, to the, when Clinton was governor and it just shows, you know, how they made it all up.

[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:19.420]
They were out to get it's horrifying to read that book.

[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:21.860]
You would love it.

[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.160]
The hunting of the president.

[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:25.540]
Yeah, Joe Connison and Gene Lyons.

[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.120]
I'll find it.

[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:26.200]
I'll find it.

[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.000]
And then we can see it into a documentary movie.

[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.000]
Here in Toronto we have a place called the world's biggest, largest bookstores, something like that.

[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:32.480]
And it is.

[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.320]
It's humongous like three floors.

[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:36.540]
We've got every book that's ever been invented.

[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:37.400]
I'll find it.

[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.460]
Well, plus you can also, you're like me one instinct gratification because you can probably get it from Amazon as well.

[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.340]
No, I can't wait that long.

[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.540]
Yeah, I can't either.

[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:47.480]
Isn't that terrible?

[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:48.320]
Yeah.

[00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:51.460]
And you work practically as no bookstores anymore.

[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.420]
That's another interesting thing.

[00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.880]
There are no bookstores in Florida.

[00:45:55.780 --> 00:45:58.220]
There are no bookstores practically anymore in New York.

[00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:03.160]
Because everybody has to watch Joe Millionaire, who has time to read a book.

[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.020]
There you go.

[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.160]
Okay, I'll let you go.

[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:05.940]
Have a good time.

[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.680]
Don't fry too much on the beach and keep your eyes open, Lynn.

[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.000]
And watch your throat.

[00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:11.820]
Okay.

[00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:12.200]
Watch your throat.

[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.000]
He was the woman in hunting, darling.

[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:15.120]
I'm drinking it right now.

[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:15.840]
Okay.

[00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:16.660]
Thanks.

[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.240]
I'll e-mail you later.

[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:18.740]
Okay.

[00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:19.260]
Bye-bye.

[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:20.900]
Watch your throat.

[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.520]
I wonder what exactly what you meant.

[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.200]
I'm trying to look all these cities, five cities.

[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:27.700]
The radio's all yours.

[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.240]
How many?

[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:28.880]
How many?

[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:29.980]
You am.

[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.320]
Holy macken on.

[00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.980]
This is Joe Ball and the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

[00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.900]
And you're listening to the Hockey Authority Neal God.

[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.060]
They just increased us to higher alert status.

[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.300]
But no one blows up my brand new Dutch status.

[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.340]
I've been a Rex's big gave us the news.

[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.820]
Hopping value with a big glass of booze.

[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.760]
I keep a desk mask in my club compartment.

[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:03.340]
I call ringbacks for a bomb roof apartment.

[00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:07.020]
Reinforce my front door with center plots.

[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:10.440]
Wonder if that will keep up the small pots.

[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:15.060]
Checking my mail for that deadly white powder.

[00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:18.280]
Stalking my covers with Campbell's clam chowder.

[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.300]
Living on orange alert, you're ain't no fun.

[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:24.860]
I think the terror is already won't work.

[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.400]
I think it's take it.

[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.000]
I won't make it.

[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:30.280]
If it goes to red.

[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:33.940]
I'll pull the covers up over my head.

[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.460]
And she'll stay in bed.

[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.040]
He's dead.

[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:41.580]
10-1 at 560 W to QM.

[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:42.240]
See, I'm no dummy.

[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:42.840]
No way.

[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.940]
Got a very little voice.

[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:45.840]
Although it's coming back.

[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:47.260]
But it's still lumpy here.

[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:48.020]
I want you side.

[00:47:48.940 --> 00:47:49.460]
It's just a cold.

[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:51.040]
OK, just calm down.

[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.720]
I just get through with a stroke two and a half weeks ago.

[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.520]
I got a little head cold.

[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.060]
It's 100 below zero.

[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:00.540]
You think people would just leave me to hell alone.

[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:00.900]
Don't.

[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.100]
Just leave me to hell alone.

[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:04.980]
Let me just come in here and do the best I can.

[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:07.240]
I'm getting my voice.

[00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.300]
I was drinking some herb tea like Lynn was saying.

[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.200]
I had my tea there.

[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:13.080]
I just made a pit stop in the tea room.

[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.120]
What more could you want?

[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:35.700]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.700]

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.700]

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.700]

[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:35.720]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:35.720]

[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:35.920]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:35.920]

[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.280]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:36.520]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:36.520]

[00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:36.980]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:37.080]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.080]

[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.540]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:38.020]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.240]

I'm going to go to bed.

[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.960]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:06.960]

[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:07.340]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:07.640]
I'm going to go to bed.

[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:07.820]

I don't know.

[01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:44.760]
I thought it was a march.

[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:46.460]
26th of February.

[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.740]
I'm thinking it's like in February.

[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.300]
In fact, maybe that's where we're going to launch the attack on Iraq.

[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:50.920]
It's on the wall.

[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.860]
We're going to drop a bunch of humontosh on the Iraqis.

[01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:54.980]
Huh?

[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.340]
And what we're going to do, we're not going to drop the ones with the poppy seeds.

[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.740]
We're going to drop the prune daily.

[01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:02.480]
Oh no.

[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.720]
The prune humontosh and we're dropping on the Iraqis on the poor.

[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:07.420]
There you go.

[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:08.260]
That will teach you, huh?

[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.920]
And we're not giving them any toilet paper.

[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.000]
So by the way, Sodom.

[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:13.900]
At the prom.

[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:14.780]
There you go.

[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:16.280]
No.

[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.280]
Oh my god.

[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:20.780]
I think we missed it.

[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.740]
Let's try to find that Jew calendar in there somewhere.

[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.760]
Here's a call from Miami.

[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.300]
Buenos dias.

[01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:26.060]
Good morning.

[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:26.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.880]
I'm not really interested whether you're right or left.

[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:34.000]
I'm more concerned about the fact that you start your day off with a poll every morning.

[01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:35.800]
How stupid and predictable.

[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:38.120]
Oh, him again.

[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:38.920]
Speaking of predictable.

[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:40.020]
Yeah, speaking of predictable.

[01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.140]
That's all he can talk about.

[01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.840]
That's part of the show.

[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.980]
I told him, of course, you listen to every goddamn day.

[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.860]
And then again, that's an example of the kind of calls we get on the show.

[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.380]
Lynn, that's what we get.

[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.960]
We got the same misfits out there.

[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.380]
The sports shows they got the same 50 or 70 misfits.

[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.520]
They call all the sports shows every day all day.

[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.960]
And we get the same dozen idiots.

[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.740]
Who have nothing to say.

[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:00.940]
Fresh and original too.

[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:01.620]
Right.

[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.920]
And so he says the same thing.

[01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:04.020]
We even put up on a poll.

[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:05.100]
How predictable on the poll.

[01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:05.880]
Just for him.

[01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:07.320]
Just in his honor.

[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:11.960]
And if you don't like anything about the show, buy-by.

[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.000]
But he wouldn't turn it off.

[01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:14.400]
I don't have to give the rest of it.

[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:16.860]
There isn't a guy in the, and would Nessa, you're trying to be better.

[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:17.340]
Oh.

[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:17.340]

[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:17.540]
Oh.

[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.180]
Just another South Florida misfit.

[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.760]
He's unhappy because even with my head cold, I sound a lot happier than he is.

[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:25.560]
I'm sure that I am.

[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.620]
See, because one thing I don't do is there's a program on TV.

[01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:30.240]
I know it's a very revolutionary concept.

[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.440]
If a program comes on a movie, whatever.

[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:33.200]
And I don't like it.

[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.160]
I change the channel.

[01:07:34.700 --> 01:07:38.220]
If I'm in a car and listening to the radio, something comes on a song, a show, I don't like it.

[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.200]
I change the channel.

[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.800]
I don't sit there and make the effort to call up and wait on hold and say, oh yeah, you know, and just mute it like that.

[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:46.240]
You know, like a dog barking at the moon.

[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360]
That's what a lot of you people are.

[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:48.580]
You're like a bunch of assholes.

[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.160]
And I hate to put you in the category with a dog because the dog most dogs are noble creatures.

[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.840]
And Sean and Hollywood says being a dog lover myself, said in here that Tony's gone to the big microwave in the sky.

[01:07:58.880 --> 01:07:59.600]
My deepest sympathies.

[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:00.160]
Thank you, Sean.

[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.200]
I'll always remember the day you brought him into the studio.

[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:05.120]
That's the day that Andy Cal, had a license, stepped in tiny.

[01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:06.560]
I remember that.

[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:07.040]
Drought away.

[01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:08.880]
That was funny.

[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:11.460]
And also the near doggy drowning story had me.

[01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.500]
I was soiling my BVD's with laughter.

[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:14.620]
That's a true story.

[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.940]
That's the reason tiny lasted as long as he did.

[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:20.300]
Was he took that little dump that I discovered on my way to the front room?

[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.440]
Just mention that in passing.

[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:25.200]
Otherwise, he'd have fallen in my pool.

[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:26.460]
George.

[01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:29.260]
You know my pool.

[01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:30.120]
I know your pool.

[01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:30.460]
Yeah.

[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:31.220]
Don't press that.

[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.620]
I'm going to take it back there.

[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:34.380]
I'm going to like start waxing his ball spot.

[01:08:34.620 --> 01:08:34.720]
Okay.

[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.740]
He really bugs the gap out of that guy.

[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.440]
He's a good guy.

[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:38.800]
No, he's out of control.

[01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:39.560]
He doesn't get it.

[01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:40.880]
He just doesn't get it.

[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:46.160]
Seems that a lot of him's just less like the thing with the balance for life.

[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:48.080]
Do you remember that business we had with the Beast?

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:48.220]

[01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.260]
And then it was the fat boy.

[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:53.260]
And it was, you know, you can't tell me these people anything because they're the experts.

[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.140]
All our sales holes, they're the experts.

[01:08:55.340 --> 01:08:55.540]
Okay.

[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.540]
When it comes to being an assholes, our sales department, that's their specialty.

[01:08:59.980 --> 01:09:01.980]
Am I supposed to be doing a break now or what?

[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:03.240]
Whatever you want.

[01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.300]
Well, see I have to get the next one.

[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.620]
Carlos, what is it?

[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:06.080]
The next one?

[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:06.560]
Yeah.

[01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:09.520]
You got me doing so many goddamn live spots.

[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.040]
If I knew, now probably I have to play comedy bits a whole lot.

[01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.700]
I am law.

[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.060]
This is which way do you'll face it?

[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:18.480]
You way, yeah.

[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:19.940]
Everybody's got a different lifestyle.

[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.880]
We all need different things to help us be healthy.

[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.720]
That's why you ought to check out Oliomed Mediterranean Formas

[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.040]
because they got advanced combinations of pharmaceutical,

[01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:29.420]
super great olive oil with vitamins, minerals, herbals, other nutrients.

[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.100]
And there's something you need to find in the spot.

[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:31.820]
And that's the last one.

[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:33.820]
Helps you to help me.

[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:34.360]
Helps me.

[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.200]
It's all get it off.

[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.260]
Stop it.

[01:09:36.980 --> 01:09:40.500]
They're playing spots for my stroke day and I'm I'm birthed for it.

[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:45.140]
I sound like I'm in a mental institution.

[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.020]
What?

[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:47.360]
I listened to that one this morning.

[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:49.100]
I didn't think there was anything wrong with it.

[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:52.380]
You didn't think there was anything wrong with it?

[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:53.200]
No.

[01:09:53.660 --> 01:09:56.440]
Like that Monday when I came in the day after I had my stroke and I'm trying to explain

[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.620]
I had a stroke and I'm slowing my words and oh it sounds okay to us.

[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.360]
Like you always are slowing your words.

[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.780]
Let me do the spot live, okay?

[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:03.760]
Sure.

[01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:04.060]
Sorry.

[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.480]
I mean, we're nice enough to send me all that Oliomed.

[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.840]
I might as well do them a real sponsor.

[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.180]
Just playing some crap just so you can put it on the log that it ran, you know.

[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:12.900]
So we can charge these nice people for it.

[01:10:13.740 --> 01:10:14.660]
I don't like that crap.

[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:16.200]
I don't like that whole QA mentality.

[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:18.620]
Just give us the F&M money, you know, that kind of thing.

[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.500]
Anyway, for years I've been telling you about the health benefits of Oliomed.

[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:24.280]
And I keep telling you because the stuff really works.

[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.520]
I'm taking it now from I cold.

[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:31.060]
Oliomed soft yells contain pharmaceutical grade olive oil, not ordinary plain pedestrian olive oil,

[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:33.720]
but super concentrated and loaded with health benefits.

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.600]
Oliomed everyday can up reduce the risk of heart disease and high cholesterol too.

[01:10:38.020 --> 01:10:43.080]
Plus there are 14 different Oliomed formulas to choose from and they sent me a sample pack of each one, by the way.

[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.440]
Each one combines pharmaceutical grade olive oil with vitamins, minerals and herbals to support specific health needs,

[01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.840]
from bones to blood pressure to your immune system.

[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.400]
Just choose the formulas that are right for you and what you need.

[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:59.340]
And now they've got three exciting new Oliomed formulas, one to help you sleep, one to help you control your weight and co-Q10 for your heart.

[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.980]
Pick it up, it's all over town now.

[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.720]
More and more people are popping Oliomed everyday.

[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:05.680]
Pick some up today at Publix, watch out for the ankle paramedics,

[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:11.700]
and Eckerds, Walgreens, Whole Foods, markets, Navarro and Sadanos, or order it online at oliomedamerica.com.

[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:18.900]
For information column toll free, 1-866 Oliomed, that's 1-866-6536333,

[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:21.960]

[01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:28.180]
My, my and local, we're sports radio 560, she waves you a-m.

[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.440]
So, will you two wake up?

[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:37.440]
Is she really trying to help you in big weight?

[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.680]
Well, there she is, let's ask her.

[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:41.540]
Betty, is that the doms right now wearing?

[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.880]
Gee, let's be great in eating with you.

[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:46.240]
Is he picking you up after a boss today?

[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.240]
By the way, where's your meal?

[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:55.980]
We met in a refundery, he turned around and smiled at me,

[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:56.940]
get the picture.

[01:11:57.180 --> 01:12:02.340]
Yes, we see, that's when I fell for the leader of a wreck.

[01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:10.620]
He loves to let those gods come it down.

[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.740]
They came from the wrong side of town.

[01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:20.920]
They came from the wrong side of town.

[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:26.680]
They told me he was thou will never shake the shower,

[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:33.380]
a change to the tower, that's why I fell for the leader of a wreck.

[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:41.560]
One day my dad said, find someone new.

[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:49.720]
I had to tell my son, damn, with what you mean to him.

[01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.740]
Would you better go find somebody new?

[01:12:53.140 --> 01:12:59.560]
I told him my couldn't wait for him to go ahead and bump away.

[01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.900]
That's when he shot me.

[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.500]
The leader of a wreck.

[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.680]
There's no time to answer that.

[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.380]
You're mine.

[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.160]
I'm pretty scared of 560 WQ.

[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.380]
I'm sorry to ask you a question, George.

[01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:20.720]
Did you agree with the entire platform of the Democratic Party?

[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:23.320]
Oh, every last splinter of it.

[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:23.820]
Good.

[01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:25.720]
Because otherwise, yeah.

[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:30.180]
560, 560, £560 on the AT&T in Verizon.

[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:31.300]
Aireless line.

[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:31.660]
Yes.

[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:32.840]
Never had an original opinion.

[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.320]
I only agree or disagree with other people.

[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:35.900]
Good.

[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.860]
That's the way to do it.

[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:41.780]
Kind of like Bert Erinzen, the county commissioner wants to do the thing with the French rise.

[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:48.080]
Admitted he got the idea, he read that Covey's restaurant in Beaufort, North Carolina switched from serving French to Freedom Fries.

[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:53.760]
So in Palm Beach County, he wants to be as much of a Yahoo who is some redneck from Beaufort, North Carolina.

[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:58.640]
And I mean, it's tragic.

[01:13:59.020 --> 01:13:59.380]
It's pathetic.

[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:01.220]
It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.

[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.020]
It is sad.

[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:06.360]
In fact, they're quoting in his story some of the people that they talked to in the diners in various other places.

[01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.360]
And they said, it's silly.

[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:09.460]
It's ludicrous.

[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.180]
It's ridiculous.

[01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:12.420]
You jackass.

[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.340]
So one thing we discovered about Broward County, the power of Palm, excuse me.

[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.020]
Broward's got enough of its own problems.

[01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:23.020]
Palm Beach County commissioner Bert Erinzen, we discovered he's an asshole.

[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:24.120]
Make no mistake about it.

[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:24.440]
Okay.

[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.260]
All the answers, that's the people that run South Florida.

[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:36.480]
It reminds me of the days in Hellendale when Sunny Rosenberg and his gang wanted to pass a resolution making it illegal in Hellendale for people who listen to the New York Roger show.

[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:38.680]
They lost.

[01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:43.980]
And I used to joke on the year about they were going to put up a big tower to block the signal WNZ.

[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.000]
They're going to block the signal in Hellendale only.

[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:48.280]
Is there a way to do that?

[01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:48.580]
No.

[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.300]
No, but it's here.

[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.640]
They think they would like to do it.

[01:14:51.460 --> 01:14:52.340]
They're working on it.

[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.800]
They're borrowing some of Fidel's equipment.

[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:56.500]
Right. They're going to get the woodpecker going up there.

[01:14:57.360 --> 01:14:59.360]
Hey, Sunny, better to have one of those than nothing at all.

[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:01.360]
Here's the lady in Kendall.

[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:01.660]
Hello.

[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:02.720]
Hi, Neil.

[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:03.500]
Yes?

[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.520]
My condolences about your little dog are really sorry.

[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:06.720]

[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:09.500]
Listen, I know you find it hard to believe, or maybe you don't.

[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:14.980]
But there's a huge audience out here that wants to hear about what's going on in the world.

[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.980]
And there's really nobody in the dial, but you...

[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:22.620]
Oh, this is the same woman that called and gave you that song in an answer a few weeks ago.

[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:23.100]
No, no.

[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.260]
I don't give up.

[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.800]
So, somebody you're trying to tell you?

[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:29.340]
In other words, you're trying to tell me how to do the show?

[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:30.740]
Yeah, if this is suggesting.

[01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.120]
The suggestion over doing what?

[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:38.000]
Well, you're the only one besides, you know, George.

[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.120]
You know, am I offending anybody by saying...

[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:46.140]
This is the same thing that called you and ripped me an ass thinking that I was out of town.

[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:47.740]
Oh, I thought you were listening.

[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:48.900]
Oh, is it easy?

[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:49.340]
Is it lazy?

[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.540]
Is it a cop-out?

[01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.380]
I know you were listening.

[01:15:52.940 --> 01:15:53.180]
Yeah.

[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:58.200]
But I'm just trying to shake you up because I know you got...

[01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:01.920]
What is it that I'm supposed to be doing to please you that I'm not doing?

[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:02.960]
How about...

[01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:08.020]
How about just 30% of the time to talk about what's going on in the world?

[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.560]
We'll meet her at...

[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:14.000]
In other words, we're supposed to be measuring the minutes as it was supposed to have like an egg timer.

[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.020]
I have a time calculator.

[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.920]
Are you making me feel really guilty that I'm calling about this?

[01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.600]
Hey, I mean, look at the calls we're getting here today.

[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.760]
The ass-holdy buddy boy guy.

[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.180]
And then we get the guy who always calls about taking a poll.

[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:27.480]
And then we've got a call today.

[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.680]
I am not wasting my time, lady.

[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.020]
I'm not wasting my time.

[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.620]
If I felt better, I'd put up with it.

[01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:33.400]
I don't feel like great.

[01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:36.120]
I've got a little high-cooled and I'm not going to sit here and put up with your crap again.

[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:40.100]
She already said it the first time and I'd be rated her what?

[01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:41.400]
About 20 times since then?

[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:44.260]
And she's got the husband of call back and she's coming.

[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:49.440]
30% of the time do this and 20% of the time do that and the other 50% wife with your left hand.

[01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.900]
Stick it up your ass, lady.

[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:51.320]
Okay?

[01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:53.100]
I'm doing pretty damn well.

[01:16:53.220 --> 01:16:54.640]
I know how to do a goddamn talk show.

[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.240]
I don't need help from some bitch down there at Kendall who's a professional agitator.

[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.600]
Oh, you injurge, is the other one?

[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.400]
Georgia's a...

[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.620]
Is a filling on this show.

[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.860]
Okay, Georgia's a lackey.

[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.900]
Small potatoes, lady.

[01:17:06.040 --> 01:17:06.320]
Okay?

[01:17:07.940 --> 01:17:08.760]
But George does.

[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:11.540]
In fact, once you just do the rest of the show and I'll just sit back and chuckle.

[01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:11.980]
No thanks.

[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.660]
I'll sit back and cackle.

[01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:16.460]
Like I'm not talking about what's going on.

[01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.600]
What's the live we've been talking about on this show?

[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:20.300]
And you hear the response?

[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:21.960]
Yeah.

[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:23.980]
But yeah, I'm too lazy for that.

[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:24.780]
That's a cop-out.

[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.560]
It's too much work.

[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.980]
That's why we got eight million bedtime stories on it.

[01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:31.620]
That's why we're the one show that's trying to get people involved with this virtual march on Washington today,

[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:35.240]
which the mainstream media aren't interested in because the two busy guy that I'll present on there,

[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:39.020]
how can a china go with a bunch of Julios, with a bunch of illegal aliens probably?

[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:40.220]
Yeah.

[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.240]
There are small businesses.

[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:43.640]
Are so deprived of here.

[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:45.020]
Oh my god.

[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420]
Lost my appetite for lunch.

[01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:48.620]
39.6 minutes, by the way.

[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:50.020]
Are we counting now?

[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:51.620]
Is what 30% of the show would be?

[01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.100]
39.6 minutes, I'm gonna...

[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.660]
And she still didn't say to talk about what?

[01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:57.180]
Well, you know what I'm saying.

[01:17:57.180 --> 01:17:58.240]
You would join the only...

[01:17:58.760 --> 01:17:59.140]
Yeah, right.

[01:17:59.340 --> 01:18:00.260]
We're the only ones that do it.

[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:00.500]
Sure.

[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:04.800]
And nobody wants to hear goddamn topical talk shows anymore, lady.

[01:18:04.800 --> 01:18:07.680]
I'm not gonna sell out my goddamn livelihood to make you happy.

[01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.300]
Get your own personal tapes.

[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.300]
Put a bunch of crap on tape.

[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:13.800]
In fact, just sit there and talk to yourself.

[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.100]
Listen to the Saudi-Rone voice.

[01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:16.960]
What did I tell you?

[01:18:16.980 --> 01:18:17.700]
I knew that was her.

[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.360]
As soon as you started with that crap.

[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:24.720]
In a town where nobody's got a goddamn thing to say about anything, which is South Florida.

[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.640]
I'm gonna make a difference there.

[01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:30.680]
In God's waiting room, I'm gonna make a difference.

[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.340]
But you defeated the penny sales tax.

[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.540]
Yeah, well, what we do.

[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.560]
The hell I did.

[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.540]
That was just...

[01:18:36.540 --> 01:18:39.480]
That was just Richard Friedman and Dave Watts' name and a traffic guy.

[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:41.080]
Just, you know, thumping their chest.

[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:42.320]
Oh, we'll need a look at Neil Dude.

[01:18:42.460 --> 01:18:43.820]
You know, I mean, they're good guys.

[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.340]
They mean well, but who the hell are they kidding?

[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.620]
And a major guy that I'm sorry with this show with that Fox News Network stuff.

[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.740]
Was there one word written about that in the local media?

[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:53.240]
No.

[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.620]
We held this mob business going on for months.

[01:18:56.740 --> 01:18:58.400]
The whole station's been in chaos and uproar.

[01:18:58.540 --> 01:18:59.540]
Is there one word written about it?

[01:18:59.560 --> 01:18:59.920]
No.

[01:19:00.340 --> 01:19:00.680]
No.

[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.580]
This week end, 27 year anniversary on here.

[01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:07.300]
And of course, that's not a very even sexy number 25.

[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:07.740]
No.

[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:09.060]
Well, there we one word written about that.

[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:09.300]
No.

[01:19:09.460 --> 01:19:10.220]
Absolutely not.

[01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:12.220]
The numbers came out.

[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.260]
The ratings from the fall book.

[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.300]
Weach and weach and weach and weach ago.

[01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:17.280]
Anything written about that.

[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:17.460]
No.

[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.120]
We're not gonna make a difference in that town.

[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:19.880]
Who the hell are you kidding?

[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.360]
Who are you kidding?

[01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:26.140]
I divested myself with that idea a long time ago.

[01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:28.120]
I'm there to get that paycheck every two weeks later.

[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.260]
And try to be as entertaining and amusing and whatever else is possible.

[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.220]
And throw in in a few tidbits as well.

[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:37.360]
So people who do give a crap which isn't too many can find out what those really going on in the world.

[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:42.640]
And the people that really care beyond that can go on our website and read all the stuff that's on there.

[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:47.460]
With the links to Lin's website and all the other evening and other websites we got links to on there.

[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:53.340]
So, you know, though those people if they really care enough, instead of calling me and badgering me and telling me how to do that to the God damn show.

[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:55.300]
He's got a long way to say what I should talk about.

[01:19:55.500 --> 01:19:55.980]
This bitch.

[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:56.940]
Maybe she'll fax it.

[01:19:56.940 --> 01:19:58.400]
This evil miserable bitch.

[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.660]
Now you encourage by the way.

[01:19:59.880 --> 01:19:59.980]
Huh?

[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:04.100]
You're a good post person.

[01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:04.380]
Right.

[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.480]
We're going to lunch later.

[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:06.480]
Yeah.

[01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:07.860]
Well Linda want to go to the lunch.

[01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.860]
We'll go with somebody.

[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:09.200]
Right.

[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.180]
Maybe she'll buy.

[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.380]
Maybe Rimmer will buy that lunch.

[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:12.440]
Oh, yeah.

[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:15.040]
The Grimmer Rimmer.

[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:16.440]
That's okay.

[01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:18.680]
By the way, he's coming here on a weekend.

[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.080]
Is he?

[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:24.340]
Oh yeah, the Panthers are playing the Leafs Monday night at the Air Canada Center.

[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.620]
And he's going to take you out to dinner?

[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:29.240]
Who do you think is going to be buying the meals when he's here on Sunday and Monday?

[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:30.260]
How many guests do I get?

[01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:30.880]
Hmm.

[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:35.440]
Have two words for Rimmer, okay?

[01:20:36.900 --> 01:20:37.260]
Yeah.

[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:38.900]
Mitch Hirsch.

[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.580]
19-11 at 5.60 WQM.

[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.780]
All you homeowners out there is there anything worse than venturing out on the backyard for a swimming.

[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:48.780]
Looking into a pool that used to be beautiful and then looking at it and saying,

[01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:50.380]
what the hell happened to this thing?

[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.300]
It's stained.

[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:51.900]
It's schmozy.

[01:20:52.020 --> 01:20:53.300]
Maybe it's cracking, falling on the part.

[01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:54.900]
Don't look at an ugly mess anymore.

[01:20:54.900 --> 01:20:57.320]
Call our good friends at Atlantic Marcyte.

[01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:58.520]
No more ugly pool, man.

[01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:02.620]
These guys aren't just pool guys who run a cleaning service like some people use out of a truck.

[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:07.220]
The real construction company uses full-time employees, not subcontractors.

[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:10.820]
In other words, this is their business, not just a sidelight that they try to petal you on the side.

[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:15.720]
Atlantic Marcyte specializes in the most incredible innovation at the pool business, Diamond Brighton.

[01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:18.820]
Like I said yesterday, my pool is diamond-righted and it looks fantastic.

[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.420]
Atlantic Marcyte's been pouring it on for 12 years.

[01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:25.460]
They're licensed, they're insured professionals, they even train other companies internationally how to

[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:26.640]
diamond-righting and do it right.

[01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:31.780]
And you'll get the same price that they give to the contractors, which means you'll save a lot of money and get a stupidness job.

[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:34.840]
They'd browd or palm-beach counties call Atlantic Marcyte.

[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:37.740]
They're the biggest installers of Diamond Bright anywhere in South Florida.

[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:39.380]
They'll come right to you and give you a free estimate.

[01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:43.880]
They also perform pool and deck renovations, custom lighting, pool heating, and exotic water features too.

[01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:50.260]
For the very best work called Atlantic Marcyte, unbeatable deal as well, at 1-800-558-8833.

[01:21:50.260 --> 01:21:54.580]
That's toll free 1-800-558-8833.

[01:21:55.060 --> 01:21:58.540]
Diamond Bright is the best, so do it right because Diamond Bright is a pool's best friend.

[01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:02.740]
This is my life and local. This is Fort Real 560.

[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:04.540]
You way and way.

[01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:08.240]
This is the Neal Roger Show.

[01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.040]
This is your play.

[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.040]
Any questions?

[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.740]
My foot is burning me.

[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:32.660]
My foot has a big red ring.

[01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:39.260]
Really is watered inside.

[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.960]
Close my ass. Feels like it's all fired.

[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:51.080]
It feels like my ass is on fire.

[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.880]
I'll have to get in one of those inflatable tires.

[01:22:56.500 --> 01:22:58.400]
Because it burns, burns, burns.

[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.860]
Like my ass is on fire.

[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:03.380]
My ass is on fire.

[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:08.060]
One thing that I break again too.

[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:14.520]
Is squirking through the old food queue.

[01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:21.580]
Burning from which it though was games.

[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:28.700]
As it troops from out of your hands.

[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:34.400]
It feels like my ass is on fire.

[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:39.080]
I'll have to get in one of those inflatable tires.

[01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:41.980]
Because it burns, burns, burns.

[01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.100]
Like my ass is on fire.

[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.560]
My ass is on fire.

[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:52.380]
It feels like my ass is on fire.

[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:57.020]
I'll have to get in one of those inflatable tires.

[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.160]
Because it burns, burns, burns.

[01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:02.120]
Like my ass is on fire.

[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:02.720]
Welcome.

[01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:04.580]
My ass is on fire.

[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.920]
My ass is on fire.

[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.400]
My ass is on fire.

[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:13.100]
February 7 at 560 WQM.

[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:15.220]
I would rather light my ass on fire.

[01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:17.080]
Rather fart and light it with a match.

[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.180]
And have it sing all the hair on my ass in both cheeks.

[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:21.420]
And talk to that bitch again.

[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.540]
If I ever complain about no women callers again.

[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:28.640]
Stop me, cut it off right, nip it at the bud.

[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:29.380]
That's right.

[01:24:31.020 --> 01:24:32.320]
Don't ever let me do that again.

[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.620]
Because women callers 99% of nothing there are that many.

[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:36.620]
But they're just like her.

[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:40.080]
They're like I guess most women in South Florida, their nags.

[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:44.180]
They want to tell you what to do, when to do it, how much of it to do it, etc. and so on.

[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:45.580]
She had nothing to say.

[01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:46.680]
Are you sure you're gay?

[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.260]
She had nothing to offer.

[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.960]
Yet absolutely nothing.

[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:56.520]
All she did was repeat, almost verbatim, the same crap that I heard her babbling to you weeks ago.

[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.120]
The same thing.

[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.940]
So she's no different than the guy with the pool guy.

[01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.440]
Well, I'm upset because you know, Sterevity with a pool.

[01:25:04.380 --> 01:25:05.220]
That's what you got.

[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:10.000]
You got about 20 minutes and people wonder why I went for like seven months without taking a phone call?

[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.720]
I don't.

[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.160]
Good, golly miss Molly.

[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.180]
When we came to WQM, I want to tell you, I was thinking about this yesterday to show you how sick I am.

[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:20.520]
Because usually I don't think about that place.

[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.580]
When we came to that station, it was like a death knell on the phone, it was like a curse.

[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:24.960]
Right.

[01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:28.100]
Because when we came to QMM, that's where the little Julio's all started.

[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:28.540]
Remember that?

[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:28.780]
Right.

[01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:33.040]
They decided that they were going to, oh, they discovered a new play toy and this was their show.

[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.480]
And then we're going to go, I have an obligation for my friend.

[01:25:35.880 --> 01:25:36.780]
Remember that crap?

[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:40.440]
It wasn't a great while on IoT where something like that happened.

[01:25:40.740 --> 01:25:41.520]
Not like very seldom.

[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:41.960]
Right.

[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.120]
Very seldom.

[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:46.800]
So either it's QAM or like Lynn said, maybe it's, maybe it's the times.

[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.180]
You know, maybe they're just, they don't exist anymore.

[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.840]
What is this, what is this thing you just fact me about Jewish American groups who bravely oppose the United States?

[01:25:59.240 --> 01:25:59.240]

[01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.000]
I just point out stuck in it.

[01:26:01.700 --> 01:26:02.680]
Oh my gosh.

[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:05.260]
Jewish this and Jewish that in English that I'm tired of it.

[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.560]
Okay, I'm real tired of it.

[01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.280]
If it sounds like I've lost my patient's role as crap I have.

[01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:12.040]
The Jews and this and the Arabs are that.

[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.420]
It's all insanity.

[01:26:13.840 --> 01:26:15.020]
It's all religious crazy people.

[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:19.220]
And James Cromwell mentioned that yesterday when he was doing his little thing on entertainment tonight.

[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:24.360]
He said we need to stop terrorism and that's caused by extremism, which is the real enemy and that's what needs to be stamped out.

[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:24.640]
Right.

[01:26:26.060 --> 01:26:28.560]
Extremism, aka religious fundamentalism, right.

[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:38.500]
And last night when the news talking about the Shiites this and the of the the Kurds that and the, oh, I'm thinking of myself, you know, just just leave everybody alone.

[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:41.420]
Okay, just if you want to kill each other have a good time but leave us out.

[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:43.480]
I want to do it the Kurdish way.

[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.080]
You want to have your Kurds in way?

[01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:48.140]
I need them too.

[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.880]
Is rolling paper legal somebody facts me?

[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:52.200]
I'm sure I'm, this is cute.

[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:55.680]
I don't want to be caught smoking my stash or nothing illegal. Please advice.

[01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:58.980]
Well, my advice is don't do it, pal.

[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.800]
You don't do it. You're young man. You have your whole life left ahead of you.

[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.540]
What a great actor. You know underrated William Holden.

[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:13.140]
Yeah, I mean, I'm sure that Damien was not exactly one of his all-time great movies but great actor underrated.

[01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.740]
Yep. William Holden.

[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:20.780]
And that's why when I saw those Gregory Peck and William Holden and those Omen movies and I'm thinking to myself, I don't care what anybody says.

[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.040]
You can come in old Fuddy Dutty.

[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:22.860]
It wouldn't be the first time.

[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:23.560]
You're an old Fuddy Dutty.

[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.980]
But they just don't have actors and actresses now like they did in the golden days of Hollywood.

[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.300]
Man, they're nothing even close.

[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:32.100]
Just Gregory Peck's voice.

[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:32.920]
Yeah.

[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:35.940]
The heads and shoulders above what anybody else has going on right now.

[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:38.020]
He used head and shoulders, you know, they didn't know I had no idea.

[01:27:38.520 --> 01:27:42.780]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 as we can, then you're looking for anybody other than Chronix.

[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:46.640]
We started out with that old Alan Ford, the peer, for my own only one.

[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:47.220]
Anybody but Chronix.

[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:48.220]
Oh my.

[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:49.420]
You must be ill.

[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:52.260]
You be ill and he must be over the age of 100.

[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.080]
And from there it's just gone straight downhill.

[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:58.440]
Did we have one call of about the half hour we spent with Lynn Samuels?

[01:27:58.480 --> 01:27:58.580]
No.

[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.220]
Did we have anybody about our bumper stickers?

[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:02.560]
Anybody, I mean our billboards, anybody see one?

[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:02.680]
No.

[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.700]
They might as well be bumper stickers nobody's seen any.

[01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:05.380]
Nothing.

[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.520]
It's the same letdown you always get.

[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:09.440]
I mean the sun is shining.

[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:10.480]
Our grant is cooled out there.

[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:12.740]
But it's a beautiful day from the inside.

[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:19.960]
And once again the among the negativity, the hostility, the lack of anything.

[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:21.940]
It just rubs off on you.

[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.540]
I can smell it.

[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.520]
Seeping right through my window.

[01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:28.240]
Here's Oakland Park.

[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:28.560]
Hello.

[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.580]
Yeah, I just left the drive-through from McDonald's and they don't have any freaking freedom prize.

[01:28:34.680 --> 01:28:35.060]
No.

[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.200]
Let's see.

[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.160]
French fries my ass.

[01:28:43.280 --> 01:28:46.260]
What about French toast, Belgian waffles and Frank Ferders' big Arnie?

[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:49.220]
And don't even mention Canadian bacon English muffins.

[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:50.940]
Are these people mentally deficient or what?

[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:51.940]
Please help us from these idiots.

[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.000]
Yes they are big Arnie.

[01:28:53.140 --> 01:28:53.960]
They're mentally deficient.

[01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:59.000]
They're idiots like Bert Aaronson, Palm Beach County Commissioner, who wants to start calling them other names.

[01:28:59.260 --> 01:28:59.440]
Like that.

[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:01.160]
Let's start with the name calling thing.

[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.300]
You damn frogs.

[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:04.240]
You damn crouts.

[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:09.460]
And let me tell you right now, nobody is going to mess with my bratwurst.

[01:29:10.240 --> 01:29:11.920]
Now why do you have line six on hold there?

[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:13.320]
Oops.

[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.500]
Is there any special?

[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:16.300]
He hit the wrong button.

[01:29:16.700 --> 01:29:17.900]
Is there any special reason for that?

[01:29:18.820 --> 01:29:20.440]
He's having an off day today, Carlos.

[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:21.980]
He's having himself a really bad day.

[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.580]
Those faggots must be affecting your brain man.

[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.620]
Too many faggots.

[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:28.400]
Here's Miami.

[01:29:28.560 --> 01:29:28.720]
Hello.

[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:30.200]
Neil.

[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.080]
Yes sir.

[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:31.980]
How you doing?

[01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.780]
I just wanted to let you know.

[01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:41.460]
I logged on to the public broadcasting site and watched that front line show this morning.

[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:42.800]
Early this morning.

[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:49.100]
And if anybody doesn't realize how dangerous our administration is, they're going to watch this.

[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:51.080]
It's not a midnight to not appear.

[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:54.840]
It's not a midnight up here on the Buffalo WNED.

[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.100]
I mean, we are going to become the evil empire.

[01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:01.040]
That's what is administration that you're going to do.

[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.060]
He's going to isolate us from the rest of the world.

[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:03.880]
And let me ask you this.

[01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:05.940]
How come the mainstream media isn't talking about that?

[01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.640]
How come the mainstream media isn't talking about the virtual march on Washington that's going on today and the millions of people protesting?

[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.540]
And the meantime CNN's got a freedom.

[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.860]
You don't want the public to have a time and place it on your own.

[01:30:15.260 --> 01:30:16.540]
You want the right winged fanatics.

[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:17.120]
Yeah.

[01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.880]
You know, that's the only thing I can think of with that.

[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:21.620]
The public doesn't care.

[01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:25.520]
The public cares about Joe Medinare, the vacularite and a bunch of other cock-on.

[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.560]
That's what 99% of the American public care about.

[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.680]
They don't give a flying crap.

[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:29.440]
You're right.

[01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.700]
You're absolutely right.

[01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:32.920]
And my passport is renewed.

[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.560]
Okay. Good luck.

[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.240]
I'll see you at the border.

[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:35.820]
Yep.

[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:36.500]
Okay.

[01:30:37.640 --> 01:30:39.540]
And that's a great, a great show, evidently.

[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:41.520]
We're going to hold it.

[01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:42.280]
I'll write that down.

[01:30:42.700 --> 01:30:43.060]
I don't know.

[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:43.940]
Somewhere.

[01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:44.640]
Toilet paper.

[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:45.860]
Probably.

[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:46.560]
On your hand.

[01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.340]
It's on tonight again, midnight.

[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:52.740]
And again, nobody is called to check this schedule to see if it's on on WPBT or WXC element.

[01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:56.940]
And I because the, um, the PBS stations vary the schedules around the country.

[01:30:57.260 --> 01:30:59.500]
I did a two week search.

[01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:00.200]
Yeah.

[01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:01.200]
And it was an on.

[01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.080]
Yeah, but he said he watched it again this morning.

[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:03.580]
I don't know.

[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:04.040]
On the site.

[01:31:04.220 --> 01:31:05.060]
He saw it on the site.

[01:31:06.340 --> 01:31:06.900]
Oh, I see.

[01:31:06.980 --> 01:31:07.700]
He saw it off the way up.

[01:31:07.860 --> 01:31:10.060]
I'm saying it is on the PBS website.

[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:14.080]
If you click on the front line, you can watch it online.

[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:15.880]
I'm not interested in watching it online.

[01:31:16.140 --> 01:31:16.680]
I mean, yeah, I could.

[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:17.540]
Yeah.

[01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:18.580]
The pain in the ass.

[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:19.900]
So I'm going to tape it at midnight tonight.

[01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:21.040]
And I know I'll get up extra early tomorrow.

[01:31:21.100 --> 01:31:21.480]
I'll watch it.

[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:22.160]
It's an hour thing.

[01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:22.880]
I'll watch it tomorrow.

[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:23.520]
We full the show.

[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:24.860]
It'll be fresh in my mind.

[01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:27.460]
And then we can make that lady happy.

[01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:32.180]
We can sit here and save the world from itself by pontificating for the whole show tomorrow just to make her happy.

[01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.160]
Or you could just play the audio from it.

[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:34.860]
That's a possibility.

[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:36.620]
And I'm not going to happen though.

[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.240]
You could do the trends in between.

[01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:43.020]
In fact, what, uh, let's see, I'm trying to think of what channel that is here.

[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:44.840]
Not that you'd have any idea.

[01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:45.140]
Right.

[01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.440]
Oh, it's the Buffalo Public Television Channel.

[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:47.920]
It's crazy.

[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:49.400]
Shoes are one.

[01:31:49.480 --> 01:31:49.860]
That ain't it.

[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:50.280]
47.

[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:51.040]
Internet.

[01:31:51.300 --> 01:31:52.000]
No, not there.

[01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:52.280]
Wow.

[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:53.100]
47.

[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.420]
Yes, that's my psychic.

[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.640]
No, it's in the phone.

[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:58.680]
I think that's it.

[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.060]
They got a lot of cartoons on there.

[01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:01.780]
PBS.

[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:02.740]
They put it on there for kids.

[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.740]
They figure somebody might as well watch nobody else does.

[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:06.520]
Which is very sad.

[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:08.200]
Don't forget move on dot org.

[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:11.560]
Anybody wants to be in that virtual march on Washington against the war?

[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:14.620]
You can go to our website and click that thing on.

[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:16.240]
But that'll just jerk you around all over the place.

[01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:18.900]
In fact, why don't we just put on there move on dot org, Carlos.

[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.260]
It would be a lot better than that fancy.

[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:21.700]
I mean, already, uh, already.

[01:32:21.700 --> 01:32:26.640]
I think it's a link if they click on the link that I have there.

[01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.380]
It'll take them to move on that org.

[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:29.380]
Move on dot org.

[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:31.640]
And you can find out what that's all about.

[01:32:31.740 --> 01:32:34.360]
Also, I'm going to try to find that book, The Hunting of the President by Joe Connison,

[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.400]
that Lynn talked about.

[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:39.400]
I guess nobody in our audience has any idea who Lynn Samuels is or cares,

[01:32:39.780 --> 01:32:42.280]
because we didn't get any response to that or about anything.

[01:32:42.620 --> 01:32:44.700]
You know, same old stuff.

[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.040]
Another day in Parade Dice.

[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:48.420]
Now, am I doing a spot here or what?

[01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:50.240]
Because you know, you didn't buy the facts of me a lot.

[01:32:50.240 --> 01:32:52.900]
If I knew, I was going to be doing like eight million live spots.

[01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:56.140]
Well, we didn't know that at the beginning, but then Troy, let's look at it.

[01:32:56.420 --> 01:32:58.740]
You know, you do that this spot.

[01:32:58.820 --> 01:33:00.700]
The next spot is, uh, is Pompa, no parts.

[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:01.880]
So we can talk about it on here.

[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:04.120]
I mean, Pompa, no parts, but I would be for 150 years.

[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:04.760]
They understand.

[01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.500]
Plus they like my mentioning Pompa, no part.

[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:08.040]
You know, it's sublimable, you know?

[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.480]
And that's the way it's supposed to do it.

[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:10.640]
So when they raise their head.

[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:13.600]
As we deal with this channel,

[01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:19.100]
like you know, you need to know that the value of freedom and liberty

[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:25.100]
will be at the forefront of a policy designed to make the world more peaceful.

[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:25.500]
Oh, yeah.

[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.440]
I remember those things freedom and I remember that.

[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:27.940]
You do?

[01:33:28.600 --> 01:33:31.100]
And look all this is 430560.

[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:33.220]
Way to go.

[01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:35.040]
Now, the year is coming gone.

[01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.120]
It's early in the new year.

[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:37.960]
And if you want your house looking brand spank and new,

[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:41.620]
during this year, make yourself even not too late to make another new year's resolution.

[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:45.840]
And that is that you're going to keep your house looking great with the help of my good friends at Drag Concepts.

[01:33:45.840 --> 01:33:49.400]
Over 20 years now, well over 20 years, they've been cleaning the carpets in my home.

[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:53.760]
And they'll do the same for you and they'll do an unbeatable job, the likes of which you can't even imagine.

[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:57.040]
If you never had Drag Concepts, you don't know what carpark cleaning is really all about.

[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.700]
They dry clean your carpets.

[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.540]
And their exclusive patented Drag Cleaning Method sucks out even the deepest dirt and the fibers of the carpet,

[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.920]
leaving them looking exactly like brand new.

[01:34:05.980 --> 01:34:08.520]
Nobody would even know that they didn't have brand new late on your floor.

[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:12.040]
And of course, they also do a stupendous job of cleaning your upholstery, leather furniture,

[01:34:12.420 --> 01:34:14.740]
and all your other good stuff too, your drapery, whatever you need.

[01:34:14.740 --> 01:34:19.600]
And if you've got pet odors and milder odors caused by water damage, they'll make that all a go away like a miracle on your floor.

[01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:28.260]
And as far as prices concerned, don't have to have any fear when you call these folks because Drag Concepts always gives you a written guaranteed price before they start doing anything at all.

[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:31.660]
So do yourself a favor this year and always use Drag Concepts.

[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:34.440]
You'll thank me for turning on of these people. They're the best in the universe.

[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:44.220]
Call them toll free from anywhere, 1-800-248-5071, 1-800-248-5071, or log onto their website to get more info about the fantastic work they'll do for you.

[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.660]
And that's why I think the Jettel have a chip-beanship season.

[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:10.360]
And when did I tell you? You don't talk to Lysheu can talk. This is the beast. I said shut up, fatso.

[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:13.640]
But you're like a father to me. You don't talk to Lomb d'Anne talking.

[01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:14.200]
What other than that?

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.200]

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.200]

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.200]

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.200]

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:14.200]

[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:15.660]
Shut up, dumb talk and then you talk.

[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:16.440]
Okay, I'll...

[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:20.520]
Hey, beast, come here. Come here. I want you to be the friend of mine. Mr. Gump Club.

[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.680]
Why are you on a...

[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:25.340]
I'm gonna show you the business interest thing. Come here.

[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:33.140]
Lysheu court sentences you to 20 years in Oz.

[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:35.680]
Would you info?

[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:37.860]
I don't a tear off my mattress.

[01:35:38.380 --> 01:35:39.940]
Look like we'll be your bunk mates.

[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:41.660]
The name's Mohal Adabit.

[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.680]
Star is stage screen and Theradite.

[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:44.500]
What's yours?

[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.080]
Nick Old, me Coffey.

[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:48.180]
You got so pan.

[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:49.140]
Thank you.

[01:35:49.780 --> 01:35:51.300]
Hey, you gonna...

[01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:53.140]
So powerful, drill, right?

[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:54.580]
I'm gonna make you my woman.

[01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:55.560]
Hey, nobody's gonna do something.

[01:35:56.480 --> 01:35:58.180]
God, God, who's doing this?

[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.000]
God, you little pinky.

[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:02.200]
I'm sure, Tar. We got 10 minutes.

[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:03.760]
What else to be safe and easy?

[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:07.720]
Yo, both of us.

[01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.800]
Hey, co-with Britain.

[01:36:09.260 --> 01:36:09.660]
Okay.

[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:11.360]
Come on, it bothers me like that.

[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:12.480]
You know who I am?

[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.360]
No, can't then. Then don't pick it up now.

[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:15.440]
I'll be a flood of shit.

[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:16.240]
All right.

[01:36:16.580 --> 01:36:18.220]
But I expect a Britain apology.

[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:20.600]
I might just put that broom in and go touch it.

[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.620]
Hey, Lord, I'm a broom man.

[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.540]
I'll pick the broom.

[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:24.300]
Hey, bro, get to me.

[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.700]
The warden will see you now.

[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.120]
Thanks.

[01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:32.380]
Well, Mr. David.

[01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:33.260]
Hello, Warden.

[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:34.400]
To Jack.

[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.360]
Jack Warden.

[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:36.360]
How can I help you?

[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:37.120]
You see, Warden?

[01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:37.620]
Yeah.

[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:38.700]
I keep getting raped.

[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:39.340]
To Jack.

[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:41.140]
You know, he's a vat of shit.

[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.120]
I'll look into it right away.

[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:43.800]
Thanks, Warden.

[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:44.600]
It's about time.

[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:45.200]
Somebody...

[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.540]
It'll drop your pack.

[01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:48.540]
I said drop your pack.

[01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:49.520]
This was odds.

[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:51.720]
Oh, favors don't come to you.

[01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:53.600]
Yo, yo, yo.

[01:36:54.080 --> 01:36:55.220]
Let's rape, oh.

[01:36:55.940 --> 01:36:57.780]
Radio big shot.

[01:36:58.500 --> 01:37:01.280]
That's how we pass the time away.

[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:02.860]
In the K.O.J.

[01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.340]
Love it all 3 at 560 WQM.

[01:37:06.420 --> 01:37:07.460]
Here's a pick report in Hollywood.

[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:08.000]
Hello.

[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:09.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:09.880]
Yes, sir.

[01:37:09.940 --> 01:37:11.100]
Yeah, the pick report for you.

[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.360]
441 bridge.

[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.380]
And then finally, it's my bridge at 441.

[01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:16.420]
They're going to come shoot and rape us.

[01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.480]
It's a bag of a pick up stuff.

[01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:19.540]
You get a black bag of street.

[01:37:19.660 --> 01:37:21.520]
My time, you see, I was through eight, the whole gang.

[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:22.600]
I'm dead again.

[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:25.120]
Okay, thanks.

[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.360]
Do you have any idea what he just said?

[01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:29.720]
441 and 595 overpass.

[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:30.580]
Yeah.

[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:31.720]
Shooting radar.

[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:34.980]
Here's the fact from Aaron and Perrinos.

[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.720]
Freedom Fry doesn't sound like the ancient W.W.1 anti-jerman propaganda.

[01:37:39.740 --> 01:37:43.200]
When they told people not to use words like kindergarten and sour crowd.

[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.600]
Also, according to Brewer's quotations, Joseph Stalin was quoted as saying,

[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.920]
he who is not with us is against us.

[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:52.420]
It's good to know that George W. is a Stalin fan.

[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.280]
My condolences regarding Tiny, all about.

[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:55.240]
Thank you, Aaron and Perrin.

[01:37:56.500 --> 01:37:57.440]
It's gone in, taxes.

[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:59.120]
I guess we'll just do the show by facts today.

[01:37:59.120 --> 01:37:59.380]
Okay.

[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:01.120]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:01.440]

[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.400]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.720]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:04.820]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:05.160]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.320]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.660]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:08.180]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.260]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.780]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:14.440]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:14.820]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.320]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:16.000]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:16.720]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.020]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:18.020 --> 01:38:21.240]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:24.680]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.360]
I don't know what we can do.

[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.860]
You get in the line of the liberal talk radio to the point of having her listeners phone the new network and tell her how great she is.

[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.360]
Oh, it says her tirades are so old and her collar is what a bunch of drooling lap dogs.

[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.060]
Old yetis is what you're talking about.

[01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:49.060]
Like I said before that radio went out 15 years ago with white bucks 25 or 30 years ago.

[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:50.820]
40 years ago.

[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.960]
Two, check out the pictures on your website.

[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:55.120]
Be nice to know who everybody is.

[01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:57.340]
Well, you'll find out who they are if you click on the picture.

[01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:57.860]
See?

[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:01.220]
See most people don't know that car.

[01:39:01.300 --> 01:39:01.580]
Right.

[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.060]
I thought you've explained it.

[01:39:04.060 --> 01:39:07.900]
Well, I mean, not everybody's listening every minute of every day except the guy that they don't like the polls.

[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.300]
I'm going to see what I can do to make the poor.

[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.620]
How awesome may have to go along with the pictures.

[01:39:11.620 --> 01:39:13.020]
I did figure out who Moe is.

[01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.620]
Isn't either one with the rodent on his head.

[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.160]
Yeah, that's him.

[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.860]
And three, keep the beds coming especially the Moe bits.

[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.240]
He sucks.

[01:39:19.340 --> 01:39:20.680]
Why we just had one for you there, sir.

[01:39:21.520 --> 01:39:22.740]
You ask and you got it.

[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:27.340]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a AT&T line.

[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:30.620]
What's your take on the Iraq attack we asked on our poll today?

[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:32.800]
359 votes.

[01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.620]
It's mostly about oil, 126.

[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:39.100]
35% say it's mostly about OIL.

[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:43.980]
30.9% say it's coming, but I'm against it 111.

[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:45.100]
It's coming.

[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:45.880]
I'm all for it.

[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:48.040]
78, 21.7%.

[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:48.720]
Pretty weak.

[01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:49.660]
Yeah.

[01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:52.660]
Less than 22% are all for this escapade.

[01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:54.440]
Well, that's your crowd, you know.

[01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:57.620]
It can still be avoided 26, 7.2%.

[01:39:57.620 --> 01:39:58.000]
Uh-uh.

[01:39:58.380 --> 01:39:59.760]
And I have no clue 18.

[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:01.880]
18 are going like that.

[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:04.900]
On a day from Hell, man.

[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:06.120]
And I thought you were doing the show here today.

[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.900]
That's what I thought was, you know.

[01:40:08.180 --> 01:40:08.880]
Let's blame it on Lynn.

[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:09.920]
Sure.

[01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:15.720]
What's her show start, by the way, since she's only screened and calls once in a while.

[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:17.260]
I figure, pardon?

[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.120]
Is she going to get on that liberal network?

[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:20.940]
Oh, that's right.

[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:22.140]
She doesn't tell anyone.

[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:22.920]
She doesn't want any part of that.

[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.800]
She doesn't want to be a parrot for the Democratic Party party line.

[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.640]
I don't think she ever answered my question when I asked her.

[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.580]
She and her a lot of money years ago because she knows she didn't answer that question.

[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:34.180]
She's got a place in New York.

[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:36.660]
She comes down here when she feels like it.

[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:38.860]
She saunters around with Miss Grudge.

[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:39.400]
Yeah.

[01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:40.340]
She must be loaded.

[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.320]
Plus, she only had that job one day a week anyway.

[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:43.720]
Right.

[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:47.160]
You know, who now makes 25 grand a year and can afford to live in New York?

[01:40:47.480 --> 01:40:47.880]
That's a good thing.

[01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:52.020]
You can't even afford to live on the subway in New York for 25 grand a year on a subway car.

[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.440]
So she must have some cash stored away somewhere.

[01:40:55.740 --> 01:40:55.920]
Okay.

[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:59.180]
I don't want to get personal in, but share the wealth.

[01:40:59.600 --> 01:40:59.900]
Sure the wealth.

[01:41:02.120 --> 01:41:03.220]
Here's a call from the Gables.

[01:41:03.380 --> 01:41:03.520]
Hello.

[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:04.820]
Hi, Neil.

[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:05.460]
How are you doing today?

[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:05.940]
Okay, sir.

[01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:07.580]
I'm sorry to hear about your little dog.

[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:08.500]
Thank you.

[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:13.420]
You know, I'd like to, if you don't mind, I'd like to respond a bit to this new American

[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.820]
Century, Richard Pearl thing that's going on.

[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:16.380]
Yeah.

[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:21.520]
And I went back to the website and you can listen to the audio of that show.

[01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:26.320]
You don't really need to see the video of that show because it's just two faces being interviewed.

[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:32.920]
But part of the P-NAC, the people, the policy for the New American Century,

[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:35.700]
that's wolf wits and pearls and jet bushes group there.

[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.080]
And they've got their new world.

[01:41:38.580 --> 01:41:41.420]
If you go to their website, it's called New American Century.org.

[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:43.700]
I really recommend you go there, Neil.

[01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:46.080]
It's frightening to read their policy.

[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:52.780]
But essentially, their policy is to create a new sort of political military domination of the Middle East.

[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:53.880]
The Muslim States.

[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:57.320]
Oil is part of it, but not the entirety of it.

[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:01.160]
But in order to make this militarism acceptable to the American public,

[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:09.980]
Richard Pearl writes quite eloquently that Americans will need a trigger event to justify this type of invasion.

[01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:13.060]
And that leads me to a thing that's in the mail.

[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:13.900]
Mine like 9-11?

[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:14.960]
Well, yes.

[01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.980]
This leads me to a thing that's in the Miami Herald today, page 14A.

[01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.280]
Three senators criticize FBI's application of surveillance law.

[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:26.700]
And if you don't mind, if I could read just two paragraphs from this,

[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.560]
I think that it's very illuminating, Neil.

[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:29.200]
Okay.

[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:36.260]
And please consider this, why does an employer, why does a boss give people raises and bonuses?

[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:37.660]
And then I'll read this.

[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:44.280]
FBI agents in Minnesota sought a pre-September 11th piece of warrant to search Zachariah Muthawi's laptop computer.

[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:49.220]
But were denied by headquarters in Washington because they lacked probable cause.

[01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:53.600]
A reasonable ground to suspect that he had committed a crime.

[01:42:53.860 --> 01:42:59.900]
The report said two FBI supervisors who handled the case misunderstood crucial elements of the piece of law.

[01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:05.940]
A senior FBI attorney could not provide the proper legal definition of probable cause needed to obtain the warrant

[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:09.680]
was unaware of a president setting Supreme Court ruling on the issue.

[01:43:10.220 --> 01:43:11.120]
Now here's the kicker.

[01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:18.480]
Grassley identified that lawyer Tuesday as Marion Bowman, the head of the FBI's National Security Law Unit.

[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:23.420]
Bowman, now this is the man who thwarted the Phoenix memo.

[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:24.320]
You understand this?

[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:34.800]
Bowman has since received a presidential citation and a hefty cash award for his service on the recommendation of FBI director Robert Mueller.

[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:42.140]
Now I ask why do employers and why do bosses give people bonuses and raises?

[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:45.220]
They do it because of a job well done.

[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.180]
I mean, you're bouncing all over the place.

[01:43:47.380 --> 01:43:52.300]
I mean, you're really, you know, I mean, what you're trying to say is the Bush administration was responsible for 9-11?

[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:53.460]
No, I'm just saying that.

[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.840]
Well, no, just hear me out.

[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:59.220]
I'm saying that the new admit, we know that Bush Jr. was the figurehead.

[01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:04.320]
He's a plug-in prop man, as you were saying yesterday, for this new American century.

[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.360]
After Poppy wasn't reelected, they needed a new face.

[01:44:07.740 --> 01:44:12.880]
A new man who would accept such a ridiculous and as-and-i-policy and just go for it.

[01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:15.060]
But I ask you a question.

[01:44:18.520 --> 01:44:20.420]
I'll get to your question here.

[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:21.820]
Well, when?

[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:23.300]
I mean, it's only a four hour show.

[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:24.500]
When are we going to get to the answer?

[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.200]
Well, I'm saying is that Bush is part of the new American federal law.

[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:29.580]
And we just got to say that.

[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:30.740]
Sure, have a nice day.

[01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:31.680]
Good.

[01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:32.640]
God, you know?

[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:34.760]
Yeah.

[01:44:35.320 --> 01:44:36.420]
I mean, it's ridiculous.

[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.480]
How many times you have to ask the same question before a guy will respond to you.

[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:43.420]
If he wants to say that he believes that they're responsible for it, he's entitled to say it.

[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:44.060]
I don't believe it.

[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.100]
He's entitled to say it.

[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:45.880]
He doesn't want to say it.

[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:47.600]
Even he finds it so unpalatable.

[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:48.940]
He doesn't want to put the words.

[01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:50.200]
He doesn't want to articulate that.

[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:54.660]
I understand how dangerous these people are and where they're coming from and what it's all about.

[01:44:54.660 --> 01:45:00.640]
I read that new foreign policy statement that they drafted a few months ago on the year.

[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.880]
And at that point, people should have been crappin' in their pants.

[01:45:03.020 --> 01:45:06.520]
This imperialistic Teddy Roosevelt kind of policy that they came up with and the people were,

[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:08.140]
little, little, little times drove me an era.

[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:09.100]
Little, little, little like that.

[01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:13.440]
And as him dignified as this guy is, I'm trying to have a conversation with him.

[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:14.640]
And he doesn't want to be sponny.

[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:16.100]
He just keeps us saying the same thing.

[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:18.780]
Over and over and over again.

[01:45:22.380 --> 01:45:24.340]
I'm going to start singing O Canada here pretty soon.

[01:45:24.340 --> 01:45:24.800]
You know what?

[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.780]
What's some accompaniment?

[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:27.280]
Musical?

[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.000]
Guitar monica.

[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:29.980]
All right.

[01:45:30.220 --> 01:45:30.960]
I'll get my comb and paper.

[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:32.160]
12 minutes after 11.

[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.100]
Oh, that's a good idea.

[01:45:34.540 --> 01:45:35.820]
I forgot about that.

[01:45:36.500 --> 01:45:40.560]
I forgot that George was a musician in his own, on his own set.

[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:41.320]
That no idea.

[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:45.420]
I mean, what more could you want than that?

[01:45:45.820 --> 01:45:46.360]
That's all I need.

[01:45:46.500 --> 01:45:47.500]
That number one with four bullets.

[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:51.300]
12 passed 11 at 560 WQM.

[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.260]
And see, here's another piece of copy.

[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.440]
You know, Steve, well, if you're a great guy, you and dick are good friends.

[01:45:55.620 --> 01:45:59.660]
But this is, it says it doesn't matter if I'm in Toronto, Amsterdam or South Florida.

[01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:05.140]
I'll be at Pompato Park, Arnaz Track this Monday night, March 3rd, because it's free spaghetti dinner night.

[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.640]
Well, I'd be at Pompato Park this, uh, no.

[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:08.140]
Oh, sure.

[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:08.580]
I'll be there.

[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.160]
Just pretend I'm fat rich.

[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:10.720]
He'll be there.

[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:13.440]
There's nobody to deal on on the South Florida.

[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:16.500]
All you have to do is buy a Pompato Park program this Monday, March 3rd.

[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:20.440]
And you'll get a coupon good for a free spaghetti dinner on the four floor players lounge.

[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:22.060]
Do you include rules and butter?

[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:24.180]
Sound like a heaping plate of pasta and marinara sauce.

[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:25.320]
That can't be beat.

[01:46:25.420 --> 01:46:26.480]
You can't beat it with a stick.

[01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:31.300]
Don't forget this coming Monday night, March 3rd, free spaghetti dinner night at Pompato Park again.

[01:46:32.260 --> 01:46:33.320]
All you snores out there.

[01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:39.600]
Coming up on Friday, March 7th, Pompato Park presents the only horse racing firework stunt show in the entire world.

[01:46:40.140 --> 01:46:43.140]
As Australian Vince Silvestro, the power technique wonder from down under.

[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.100]
This is amazing.

[01:46:44.220 --> 01:46:45.700]
Hot to trot firework stunt show.

[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:46.280]
Don't worry.

[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:46.880]
It's outside.

[01:46:47.140 --> 01:46:47.360]
Okay.

[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:48.240]
Won't be in the grand center.

[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:49.300]
I'm gonna come out suddenly outside.

[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:52.740]
Watch this crazy Aussie stands on the shafts of his race bike.

[01:46:53.060 --> 01:46:57.460]
Holds his reins in his teeth while his super horse hand me silver races around the track.

[01:46:57.820 --> 01:47:01.640]
And Vince shoots off more than 2,000 rounds of fireworks that's a show you must see to believe.

[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.240]
It's coming up next Friday, March 7th.

[01:47:03.980 --> 01:47:06.980]
Pompato Park offers free general parking, free admission every afternoon evening.

[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:08.520]
And we got great live racing.

[01:47:09.540 --> 01:47:10.460]
Five nights a week.

[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:12.760]
Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:15.020]
Pompato Park on Powerline Road, a block south of Atlantic Boulevard.

[01:47:15.340 --> 01:47:17.580]
Don't forget free spaghetti on your snores.

[01:47:17.580 --> 01:47:18.960]
Get everybody at Pomm Air.

[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.120]
All those other ant is out there.

[01:47:20.600 --> 01:47:21.140]
Put the word out.

[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:21.380]
Okay.

[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:22.060]
Put up a billboard.

[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:22.980]
Maybe somebody else see it.

[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.180]
This coming Monday, March 3rd at Pompato Park.

[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:27.700]
Friday, the local.

[01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:29.520]
This is 560.

[01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:31.740]
The radio's on your snows.

[01:47:32.140 --> 01:47:33.300]
Thank you, Ian.

[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:36.880]
Billions house for Neil Rogers.

[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:37.980]
He's in the his house.

[01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:42.620]
And now it's time for Leavitt to Aussie.

[01:47:43.220 --> 01:47:45.500]
Starring Barbara Billingsley as June Cleaver.

[01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.680]
Cute Beaumont as Ward Cleaver.

[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:51.920]
And the irrepressible Aussie Osborne as the Oz.

[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:55.000]
Oh, good morning, Aussie.

[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:56.740]
Oh, f*** you, mama.

[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.080]
Oh dear.

[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:02.520]
I can see someone woke up on the wrong side of the van.

[01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:04.120]
Oh, come on, buddy.

[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.800]
I can't believe it.

[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.060]
I must be ahead of her.

[01:48:07.460 --> 01:48:08.900]
What the f*** is Sharon?

[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:10.280]
Sharon!

[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:11.780]
Who's Sharon?

[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:14.340]
Is that one of your friends from school, dear?

[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.540]
Good morning, Aussie.

[01:48:17.680 --> 01:48:19.000]
What f*** you, dad?

[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.160]
Get out of my face.

[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:23.560]
Now, Aussie, that's no way to talk to your father.

[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:27.000]
Say, son, what have you got planned for today?

[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.160]
We're going to be planning for today.

[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:30.600]
I don't know.

[01:48:30.780 --> 01:48:34.480]
Since when's the Prince of Darkness have to hand out a f***ing Chennai?

[01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:39.160]
I'm going to go fight the head over the boss of Eddie Hosko.

[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:39.660]
I was there.

[01:48:40.320 --> 01:48:41.580]
You have fun now?

[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:42.540]
Okay, Aussie.

[01:48:42.540 --> 01:48:43.720]
Yeah, yeah, sure.

[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:44.380]
One more.

[01:48:44.420 --> 01:48:45.340]
Go f*** yourself.

[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:49.500]
We hope you enjoyed this episode of We The Two Aussies.

[01:48:50.060 --> 01:48:53.780]
tune in next week when you hear Aussie say f***ing obvious.

[01:48:55.220 --> 01:48:56.160]
f***ing f***ing f***ing.

[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:57.760]
1118 at 560 W.

[01:48:57.860 --> 01:48:59.200]
Kim, that's my favorite new TV spot.

[01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:00.180]
Is that that Pepsi spot?

[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.540]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:03.860]
With Donnie and Marie and Florence Henderson.

[01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:06.080]
Okay, well, I'm going to let you take all these calls now.

[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.500]
Are we going to have any?

[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.500]
Not one.

[01:49:09.700 --> 01:49:11.560]
This could be the worst day in the history of this show.

[01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:12.680]
Maybe a little call back.

[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:13.120]
Huh?

[01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:14.240]
Maybe a little call back.

[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.060]
I don't think so.

[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:17.060]
This could be the worst day in the history of this program.

[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.360]
I wonder about the worst.

[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:23.480]
Although I think of those days when I'm talking about coming to QA, am I started that and then

[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:24.740]
somehow getting into it?

[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:24.760]

[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:27.200]
There's little Julios.

[01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:31.880]
And I remember the big hoopla, the first couple of weeks remember that in fact it didn't even

[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:32.640]
last two weeks.

[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:41.540]
But the first 10 days, seven months off the year, you know, all this free publicity, about

[01:49:41.540 --> 01:49:41.540]

[01:49:42.540 --> 01:49:45.840]
And then like after the first 10 days, it was like, okay, well, what do we do now?

[01:49:46.400 --> 01:49:49.620]
I know they were on the second floor and half the time the phone was broken anyway.

[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:49.960]
Right.

[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:52.380]
And then we got that whammy thing going on, which was a nightmare.

[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:52.880]
Sure.

[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.720]
And I got distracted, which I'll take the blame for that because I got distracted by talking

[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:00.100]
about that because they were in our face the whole time that the show was going on.

[01:50:00.100 --> 01:50:00.920]
That's an understatement.

[01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:05.940]
And then they kept picking out the phone calls putting on here, which believe me, there aren't any

[01:50:05.940 --> 01:50:09.680]
phone calls on this show that you want to put on here on a TV show and put that abortion on

[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:09.860]
there.

[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.440]
And then it pretty much hasn't changed since.

[01:50:13.240 --> 01:50:13.440]
Right.

[01:50:13.680 --> 01:50:17.120]
And we've discussed this before, but another phenomenon since we came here is people don't

[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:20.300]
wait on hold like through the break like they used to over at IOD for some reason.

[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:20.880]
I don't know why.

[01:50:20.900 --> 01:50:22.740]
Well, these people got to go get their bookie on the phone.

[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.060]
I got to put sports pets to make sure you better get with it.

[01:50:25.240 --> 01:50:26.340]
Sports, you know, that's it.

[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:29.720]
In fact, let's try answering the phone.

[01:50:29.820 --> 01:50:30.880]
I wait, here's Miami Sports.

[01:50:31.500 --> 01:50:31.960]
Here's Miami.

[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:31.960]

[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:32.780]
Uh-huh.

[01:50:33.780 --> 01:50:34.140]
Here's Miami Lake.

[01:50:36.100 --> 01:50:36.880]
Here's Miami Lake.

[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:37.220]
Hello.

[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:38.920]
You've lost touch with the audience.

[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:40.780]
Yeah, I lose touch with this ass.

[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:42.060]
So let's the pole guy again.

[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:42.840]
Oh.

[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.200]
Miami Shore is hello.

[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.080]
MONEY CURROWS!

[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:47.560]
Uh-huh.

[01:50:48.060 --> 01:50:50.000]
One after another after another after another.

[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:54.240]
Oh, but Neil, you know, you've got to educate the audience out there.

[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:55.580]
This audience doesn't need education.

[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.920]
They need to be in reform school.

[01:50:57.880 --> 01:50:59.880]
They need to be institutionalized.

[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:02.860]
Here's Voka.

[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:03.160]
Hello.

[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:04.600]
Hello.

[01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:05.560]
Yes, sir.

[01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:06.820]
Hey, Uncle Neil, how are you?

[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:07.400]
Okay.

[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:08.500]
Question for you.

[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:11.620]
And actually that chews about three calls that go sort of, uh, brought up as well.

[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:14.620]
That thing would sense that, that, that tag, you know, your gay.

[01:51:15.140 --> 01:51:17.860]
Let me guide, that guy called up and asked you to stop playing it.

[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:20.140]
Now, what's like the legal ramifications there?

[01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:22.160]
If he says something on the radio, you can use it all you want, right?

[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:44.320]
He did say ramifications, though.

[01:51:44.820 --> 01:51:45.480]
Yeah, ram this.

[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.060]
But I even dignified that with a response.

[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:55.600]
Huh?

[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.920]
You know, a lot of people just really don't know.

[01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.060]
Your gay.

[01:51:59.380 --> 01:51:59.560]
Yeah.

[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.480]
No, nobody could be that stupid.

[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:05.460]
Not to know that that was a joke that called Reverend Jones and the whole thing.

[01:52:05.460 --> 01:52:07.040]
No, but nobody could be that dumb.

[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:07.460]
Guess what?

[01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:08.380]
And that's what I forgot.

[01:52:08.500 --> 01:52:09.020]
I'm talking to some.

[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:10.340]
I forgot.

[01:52:10.540 --> 01:52:10.760]
Sorry.

[01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:12.040]
Yeah.

[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:14.880]
Yeah, we're getting sued for playing it.

[01:52:16.900 --> 01:52:17.620]
5.670560.

[01:52:17.820 --> 01:52:18.120]
Come on.

[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:18.840]
Listen, I'm curious.

[01:52:19.040 --> 01:52:22.500]
I mean, we've got another 30, uh, nine minutes to go here till noon and thank God it's Wednesday.

[01:52:23.480 --> 01:52:23.840]
Yes.

[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:26.640]
We have the comedy with our all four hours a day every day.

[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:27.580]
Oh.

[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.980]
Now, you have a standing ovation in these studios.

[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:31.760]
Well, there you go.

[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:33.080]
I mean, these calls today.

[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:34.420]
I wouldn't wish this on Heinrich Himmler.

[01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:37.940]
It's basically, and thanks for killing a half hour horse, Linda.

[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.700]
Believe me, it's like it's like you were never there.

[01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:40.760]
Don't take it personal.

[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:42.320]
That's just this audience, okay?

[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:44.240]
It's like you were never there.

[01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:49.120]
Nobody knows who she is, who she was, what she did, uh, where she worked, ever heard of her show.

[01:52:49.440 --> 01:52:50.660]
Nobody knows from our billboards.

[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:51.700]
Nobody knows nothing.

[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:55.540]
Except the same dozen people saying the same stupid crap.

[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:56.600]
You're gay.

[01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:57.720]
Yeah, like that.

[01:52:58.160 --> 01:52:59.060]
Are you getting sued again, George?

[01:52:59.240 --> 01:52:59.340]
Uh.

[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:00.720]
George played it that time.

[01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:01.140]
Not me.

[01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:02.400]
I haven't gotten a letter yet.

[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:03.020]
Believe me out.

[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:05.000]
I thought I left you a copy.

[01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:07.220]
I'll fix it to you.

[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:08.240]
Here's for a water deal.

[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:08.520]
Hello.

[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:11.700]
Same old, obsolete, liberal crap.

[01:53:12.120 --> 01:53:15.420]
Same old, obsolete, liberal crap that this guy's listening to every day.

[01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:16.960]
Same old, liberal crap.

[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.240]
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

[01:53:18.460 --> 01:53:18.940]
Don't worry.

[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:20.460]
Rush will be on a known, okay, pal?

[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:22.320]
Keep your hand on it till noon.

[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:23.480]
Don't squeeze too tight.

[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:26.580]
Here's plantation.

[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:27.040]
Hello.

[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:30.280]
Plantation.

[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:32.420]
Yeah, yeah.

[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:34.800]
Yeah, you know what I'm thinking of.

[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:36.680]
What are you thinking, sir?

[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:38.040]
What do you think of?

[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:39.320]
I thought I'm thinking of this.

[01:53:39.620 --> 01:53:41.760]
Is the fire weapons going to push us in the coming?

[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:44.540]
What is it?

[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:49.440]
You think I thought I'm going to destroy the fire weapons going to come in?

[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:50.220]
Sir, I can't understand.

[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:53.320]
If you get the horse crap out of your mouth, maybe I can understand what you were saying,

[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:53.600]
okay?

[01:53:53.860 --> 01:53:55.860]
Didn't it tell you about ten pounds of horse crap in his mouth?

[01:53:56.320 --> 01:53:56.640]
Or something?

[01:53:57.100 --> 01:53:58.240]
He had something in his voice.

[01:53:58.240 --> 01:53:59.140]
It didn't matter.

[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:01.960]
I understood what he was saying, and it's just as well you didn't.

[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:02.320]
Oh, good.

[01:54:02.620 --> 01:54:05.340]
I couldn't make out something about the burning bush.

[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:08.360]
Yeah, that's what he was talking about, the burning bush.

[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.980]
Here's the four-letter mail.

[01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.360]
Hello.

[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:13.680]
Two doves.

[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:18.100]
You know, Neil, since, uh, no...

[01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:18.520]
Kudos on what?

[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:19.440]
Pardon me?

[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:21.260]
Do you say kudos?

[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.540]
No, I said kudos.

[01:54:23.440 --> 01:54:23.840]
Tudos.

[01:54:24.580 --> 01:54:24.800]
Tudos.

[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:25.700]
Tudos.

[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.060]
Maybe my hearing is gone.

[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:27.980]
Maybe I'm suffering from...

[01:54:27.980 --> 01:54:28.880]
He orders his bottles.

[01:54:30.780 --> 01:54:31.260]
Tudils.

[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:38.440]
Uh, you know what I've noticed is that you've found a lot more like, uh, mo-haward since

[01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:39.240]
you came around.

[01:54:40.020 --> 01:54:40.260]
Uh-huh.

[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.080]
Yeah.

[01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:43.580]
The... the G-man says, hey.

[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:45.020]
Oh, no.

[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:49.940]
Here's Delray Beach.

[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.200]
Hello.

[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:55.480]
Hey, Neil, the guy earlier who was saying that bush might be responsible for a 9-11?

[01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:56.980]
No, but he didn't say that.

[01:54:56.980 --> 01:54:58.480]
Well, he wouldn't say that.

[01:54:58.640 --> 01:54:59.360]
He infiniated.

[01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.840]
However, if you think about it, his dad was a pilot in the war, correct?

[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.280]
So, what does that mean?

[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:09.380]
Might have taught him how to fly that plane, and I think he parachute it out right before

[01:55:09.380 --> 01:55:10.140]
he crashed in the middle of the...

[01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:10.700]
Yeah, there you go.

[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:11.540]
Well, think about it.

[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.600]
We'll take a poll on it tomorrow.

[01:55:13.980 --> 01:55:16.920]
Might have hopped out just before, and maybe that's where he was when he's supposed to be

[01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:17.760]
doing his disservice.

[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.180]
He was jumping out.

[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:24.340]
5-6-7-0-5-60, pound 5-60.

[01:55:24.340 --> 01:55:27.120]
You attract all the crazies, man, on these days when you do the show.

[01:55:27.220 --> 01:55:27.520]
I know.

[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:28.080]
I'm sorry.

[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:28.700]
I know all the crazy people.

[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:31.540]
All they want to do is show we get all those intellectuals.

[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:33.160]
Here's for it.

[01:55:33.220 --> 01:55:33.660]
Here's how.

[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:38.360]
Hi, I just wanted to get an opinion from you.

[01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:42.200]
Is it me or everyone in South Florida has got something weird about them?

[01:55:42.380 --> 01:55:43.040]
It seems...

[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.140]
If you're from the mid-war...

[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:44.920]
You notice, huh?

[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:50.420]
If you're from, you know, different states other than South Florida, it seems you're normal.

[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.140]
It's a mind-boggling.

[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:56.420]
These people in South Florida, these crank collars, these...

[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.120]
It's just amazing to me.

[01:55:59.800 --> 01:56:00.440]
There you go.

[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:01.920]
I think you got your thumb right on it, sir.

[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:02.460]
Thank you.

[01:56:02.780 --> 01:56:03.640]
And have a great day.

[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.760]
He said to people in South Florida, a bunch of morons is what he said.

[01:56:06.860 --> 01:56:07.920]
I think I might have to agree with him.

[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:09.260]
No, there is a phenomenon there.

[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:11.060]
There's certainly a something there, man.

[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:11.740]
It's a possibility.

[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:12.780]
You can smell it.

[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:14.680]
You're hemorrhoids.

[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.080]
It's a spectrum.

[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:17.240]
It's there.

[01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:21.200]
Well, maybe all the intellectuals are out there on moveon.org today.

[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:21.960]
Maybe they're getting involved.

[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:22.720]
That's right.

[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:23.320]
They're going to be involved in the main...

[01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:27.900]
Virtual March on Washington today, which is invisible based on the rest of the major mainstream media.

[01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.300]
I keep flipping back and forth.

[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:29.800]
Nothing.

[01:56:30.620 --> 01:56:31.340]
Absolutely nothing.

[01:56:31.400 --> 01:56:31.880]
No, it works.

[01:56:32.140 --> 01:56:33.340]
It's just like the protest.

[01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:34.240]
Remember when the protest started?

[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:35.100]

[01:56:35.100 --> 01:56:38.180]
Not just the most recent ones that they got embarrassed in having the show because there were so many millions.

[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:40.280]
But in the beginning, when they started doing all the protests.

[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:44.680]
And maybe you might get like two seconds on it, and that's it, mate.

[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:46.600]
Because the mass media forget about them.

[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:48.440]
They got them in their hip pockets.

[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:53.900]
So if you think you're going to get the truth from CNN, MSNBC, and Fox Fascist News,

[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:57.920]
if you think you're going to get any news from them, you're in a freaking dream world.

[01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:06.600]
A lot of people keep trying the same diets over and over again.

[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:11.100]
And what I found is a lot of times something will work for you once, and your brain kind of outsmarts itself.

[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:13.240]
And you can never go back and do it again.

[01:57:13.240 --> 01:57:16.200]
And if you haven't tried balance for life, you have nothing to lose but all of that weight.

[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:20.160]
There's no cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries, just great results.

[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:22.260]
Like the beast is getting his lost over 50 pounds.

[01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:24.120]
I guarantee you we've saved that punk's life.

[01:57:25.060 --> 01:57:28.260]
And once his head starts drinking a normal size, you know, we're really doing a good job for him.

[01:57:28.540 --> 01:57:33.000]
They deliver your little black sack to your door by 6 a.m., no matter where you are every morning, whether you're at work,

[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:36.240]
whether you're at home, whether you're at the massage parlor, three gourmet meals,

[01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:38.200]
and two delicious snacks are right in your black sack.

[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.260]
It's all prepared for you.

[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:40.720]
It's all fresh and delicious.

[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:46.500]
There are chicken dishes and beef and turkey and all kinds of good stuff, omelets and frittadas and you name it.

[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:51.920]
Nothing prefabricated, nothing frozen, and they let you pick between two choices for each one of the meals every day that you're in a program.

[01:57:52.220 --> 01:57:53.620]
That's the only choice you'll have to make.

[01:57:53.720 --> 01:57:55.600]
They do all the figuring for you based on the zone diet.

[01:57:56.160 --> 01:57:58.320]
So like I said, the food for the entire day is in there.

[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:01.820]
You don't have to worry about buying anything else, and the weight just pours off your body.

[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:08.060]
So let balance for life help you lose the weight, the real delicious way, called 954-568-3229.

[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:09.040]
And they'll give you all the details.

[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.580]
954-568-3229 or check them out on the web at balanceforlife.com.

[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.280]
In no time at all, you can look better than the lovely beast.

[01:58:17.540 --> 01:58:19.280]
Live and local.

[01:58:19.880 --> 01:58:21.580]
This is Fort Real Phi City.

[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.380]
You weigh a few weigh.

[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:26.000]
X.

[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.380]
Where it worked?

[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.720]
Where it worked?

[01:58:33.140 --> 01:58:34.580]
So let me got one email by the way.

[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:35.960]
What?

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:36.180]

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:36.180]

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:36.180]

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:36.180]

[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:38.580]
The way it worked.

[01:58:38.580 --> 01:58:38.880]
What?

[01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:39.720]
The way it worked.

[01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:42.960]
The way it worked.

[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:45.720]
The way it worked.

[01:58:45.720 --> 01:58:46.980]
The way it worked.

[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:46.980]

[01:58:46.980 --> 01:58:47.160]
The way it worked.

[01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:48.160]
The way it worked.

[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:49.600]
The way it worked.

[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:49.600]

[01:58:49.600 --> 01:58:51.360]
The way it worked.

[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:53.640]
The way it worked.

[01:58:53.640 --> 01:58:54.240]
The way it worked.

[01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.380]
The way it worked.

[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:55.380]

[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:55.680]
The way it worked.

[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:58.220]
The way it worked.

[01:58:58.220 --> 01:58:59.360]
The way it worked.

[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.420]
The way it worked.

[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:03.820]
The way it worked.

[01:59:03.920 --> 01:59:04.560]
The way it worked.

[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:04.560]

[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:04.560]

[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:06.620]
The way it worked.

[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:06.840]
The way it worked.

[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:06.840]

[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:06.840]

[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:06.840]

[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:07.160]

[01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:11.020]
Sorry Steamboat Rendi.

[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:13.260]
Little bit with gutes.

[01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:18.780]
Coastline control.

[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.200]
Coastline control.

[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:21.200]

[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:21.200]

[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.560]
That carrier was uncomplored,

[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:26.680]
Coastline control.

[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:26.780]
Yes.

[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:34.540]
All wounds in this type of air...

[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:34.540]

[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:38.000]
In the clouds

[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:40.660]
Where it works?

[01:59:41.700 --> 01:59:44.240]
That bloodshotted wasted

[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:46.780]
Talking trash

[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.440]
With a smile

[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:52.840]
You heads up your ass

[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:55.480]
And ain't been out

[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:58.500]
In a while

[01:59:58.500 --> 01:59:59.520]
Rackdom

[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:02.980]
Did ain't been out

[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.800]
That's so isn't correct

[02:00:07.800 --> 02:00:09.640]
Love 32 to 560 WQM

[02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:12.020]
But I tell you, she's in a dream world, that broad

[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:13.300]
In a dream world

[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:16.360]
But anyway, I'll come on, she'd be perfect

[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:18.220]
That's so then got an email from one of her listeners

[02:00:18.220 --> 02:00:19.100]
Her heard her out with me

[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.160]
So that makes it worth hating

[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.680]
Love, love here and it

[02:00:21.680 --> 02:00:22.640]
Can we get any response?

[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:23.420]
No

[02:00:23.420 --> 02:00:23.700]
No

[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.540]
That's okay, we can't respond to anything anyway

[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:26.060]
We're used to it

[02:00:26.060 --> 02:00:27.000]
We don't really care, you know

[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:27.260]
Right

[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:29.500]
Put on a good act like we're all bent out of shape

[02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:30.460]
Don't really care anymore

[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:32.460]
Just get the checks in the mail and that's it

[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:33.460]
Killed good time though

[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:34.440]
I killed some good time

[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:34.840]
Killed some good time of shape

[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:37.220]
Right, I'm not going to go to lunch till one o'clock anyway

[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:37.920]
So what do I care?

[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:38.240]
Right

[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:40.820]
Here's the fact that I called you about a month ago

[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:42.260]
And told you about the Joe Connison book

[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:44.980]
It's very detailed, not as fast reading as David Brock's book

[02:00:44.980 --> 02:00:47.340]
And I don't care what Lynn says about David Brock's book

[02:00:47.340 --> 02:00:48.400]
You should read it, okay?

[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:50.340]
She's just sticking up for Miss Grudge

[02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:53.260]
But he's shocking about what likes people

[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:54.940]
Go to for their own point of view

[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:56.000]
Even if it destroys people

[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.340]
And uses cheating and lying lots of money to do so

[02:00:58.340 --> 02:01:02.040]
Many of the liars in the book now have cushy jobs in the administration

[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:04.440]
Can star in Ted Olson should be impeached

[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:04.900]
That's right

[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:07.080]
And there really was a vast right wing conspiracy

[02:01:07.080 --> 02:01:08.940]
And you are absolutely correct

[02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:11.060]
Right on it, no question about it

[02:01:11.060 --> 02:01:13.840]
That's why I begged people to read that David Brock book

[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:15.880]
Well let's you know attack his credibility

[02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.420]
Because he attacked Miss Grudge

[02:01:17.420 --> 02:01:22.280]
So you know I can't live my life on that kind of a pity level

[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:22.840]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:01:22.840 --> 02:01:23.700]
No, what are you saying?

[02:01:25.340 --> 02:01:28.560]
I'm saying who cares about those kind of like you know

[02:01:29.480 --> 02:01:30.180]
But anyway

[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:34.420]
No, I'm serious, anyway the book is called The Honey of the President by Joe Connison

[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:37.460]
And we've I read some of his articles on here from the New York Observer

[02:01:38.520 --> 02:01:39.200]
Good writer

[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:42.980]
So on the right side of the tracks, I'm on the left side of the tracks

[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:47.580]
Don't forget Noona won

[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.960]
Our big Noona won our today

[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.560]
One o'clock the mad dog three o'clock he got you in mark

[02:01:53.940 --> 02:01:57.660]
Seven o'clock shittacle panther peep who panthers in a mighty duck Savannah high

[02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.620]
Seven three tonight Brian Murray in gang Paul Carrier

[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:03.840]
Is it North Korea or South Korea?

[02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:09.620]
After the hockey game is Eddie K from GA and Anthony and Vlad are doing the overnight

[02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:13.600]
So it goes to show the lengths to which we'll go to fill up four hours

[02:02:13.600 --> 02:02:15.060]
We'll put anything on here

[02:02:16.540 --> 02:02:17.680]
Here's for a lot of day, hello

[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:19.100]
Hey, Neal, how you doing?

[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:19.720]
Okay

[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:23.780]
I was wondering how long has it been since she had the lightning round?

[02:02:25.120 --> 02:02:25.920]
Meaning what?

[02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.080]
Not long enough

[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.340]
Yeah, not long enough

[02:02:28.340 --> 02:02:31.420]
No, I mean how many years ago did it that you stopped running it?

[02:02:31.740 --> 02:02:34.960]
I have no idea. Well, we've done it periodically once in a while. Why do you ask?

[02:02:35.900 --> 02:02:37.520]
Oh, I missed it

[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:39.220]
But I just was curious

[02:02:39.220 --> 02:02:42.800]
So Son, in other words, you're not hearing enough knitwoods on the ear already. You want us to do that?

[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:48.420]
For five minutes or whatever at the end of the show it was kind of funny, but...

[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.380]
Yeah, okay, thanks

[02:02:51.440 --> 02:02:55.020]
Another guy with a great commentary there, another one of those thoughtful soft-thord of people

[02:02:55.700 --> 02:02:58.600]
Those of you who go through life there and wonder why is it like this here?

[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:01.400]
Why is it like this show demonstrates and for free?

[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:06.280]
For free, this show demonstrates you exactly why it is like that and why I'm here

[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:10.260]
I don't give a crap how cold it is and it is colder than anything right now

[02:03:10.260 --> 02:03:13.040]
It's minus 19 Celsius, freezing

[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:14.680]
I don't care

[02:03:15.480 --> 02:03:17.140]
See, I think you're asking for the wrong thing

[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:18.260]
And what is that?

[02:03:18.340 --> 02:03:19.960]
Original material, something to say

[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.540]
See, why don't you just play along with what they want? Like, you be PD and we can do that for a day

[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:27.460]
And everybody can go to a program and make sure to call me for that nasty bitch

[02:03:27.460 --> 02:03:28.220]
Well, about everybody

[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:28.660]
About everybody

[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:30.640]
And about 40% of that

[02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:32.380]
About 20% my...

[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:35.000]
Reckoning the next color can now they can program the radio

[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:37.420]
Well, let's press our lock

[02:03:37.420 --> 02:03:39.120]
Here's another lady in Miami, hello

[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:40.440]
Hello, Neil

[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:41.400]
Yes, ma'am

[02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:45.120]
Hi, I just want to say I really like your show, Hi George, how are you?

[02:03:45.360 --> 02:03:45.460]
Hi

[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.320]
I just wanted to go ahead and talk to you about the full terrorism thing

[02:03:49.980 --> 02:03:53.320]
I see on the news all the time, you know, Ben Laden tapes

[02:03:53.320 --> 02:03:56.120]
You know, we have another message from Ben Laden and whatnot

[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:57.280]
What happens to him?

[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.720]
There's no focus on the rack and said I'm who's saying what are they doing as far as some of Ben Laden?

[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:06.540]
Well, we don't know where he is and Sodom has got a home address so we know where to find him generally

[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.240]
That would be great, I wish that he did have his home address so that we can't find him because it's scary to me

[02:04:12.240 --> 02:04:17.140]
But all these messages are being shown on the radio and then on the TV

[02:04:17.140 --> 02:04:21.440]
And we're not focusing really on him, he's really the madman behind it

[02:04:21.440 --> 02:04:25.520]
And somehow he's managing to get these tapes, these video and audio cassettes

[02:04:25.520 --> 02:04:26.440]
Yeah, how?

[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:27.600]
You know?

[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.540]
He's managing to get them on the air

[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:34.620]
But with all the resources that we've got we're unable to trace them back to where they're coming from and who's delivering them

[02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:39.740]
My point exactly, I mean we get the tape but where is he?

[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:40.980]
Why can't we trace him back?

[02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:45.100]
You know, that makes me very scared to be here in this country

[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:50.560]
Because we're incompetent and what better way to cloud all of that and cover it up by invading a rack which is a small potatoes

[02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:52.880]
I totally agree with that

[02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:55.580]
That's basically the point I wanted to make

[02:04:55.580 --> 02:04:57.880]
And I think we're just very sexy

[02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:01.720]
And I enjoy listening to you so I think you're great

[02:05:01.720 --> 02:05:02.400]
Thanks

[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:03.500]
All right, you have a good one

[02:05:03.500 --> 02:05:06.120]
She was doing good till she got to that part about George

[02:05:06.120 --> 02:05:07.480]
Oh, I thought she was talking about you?

[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:08.380]
No

[02:05:08.940 --> 02:05:10.820]
I thought she said I think George is very sexy

[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:12.660]
Oh, I thought she said, George is very sexy

[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.680]
Does it make a difference?

[02:05:15.860 --> 02:05:18.020]
Oh, there's a president, Karzai of Afghanistan

[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:20.140]
Thank God we got that thing all straightened up

[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.240]
That's right

[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:22.900]
Oh, I was trying to...

[02:05:22.900 --> 02:05:23.560]
He's been carmised

[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:24.800]
Carmised?

[02:05:25.100 --> 02:05:26.000]
Oh, ah!

[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:26.460]
Ah, ah!

[02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:26.780]

[02:05:26.940 --> 02:05:28.420]
And a girl, you go girl

[02:05:29.980 --> 02:05:31.800]
Certainly not news, baby, CNN

[02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.580]
New people are a freaking disgrace

[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.840]
You were a disgrace to the human race

[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:39.160]
All you are in here, the whole thing is show down in Iraq

[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:42.020]
And here's another general is on here again with the grim look on his face

[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:42.980]
And he's got the diagram

[02:05:42.980 --> 02:05:46.540]
And they got rich scientists squatting over the map on MSNBC again

[02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:48.520]
With another retired general

[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:53.460]
A whole lot of retired generals hanging around, you know what?

[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:54.500]
Yeah

[02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:57.460]
They got to do something

[02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:00.880]
56670560

[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:05.180]
Town 5, what was the line in network?

[02:06:06.300 --> 02:06:06.660]
In network?

[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:07.460]
About the erasers

[02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:10.600]
Oh, I can't remember

[02:06:10.600 --> 02:06:13.160]
Where she was talking about obviously Patty Hearst

[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.600]
Oh yeah, a lot of angry, a lot of kidnapped erasers out there

[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:17.420]
That's it

[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:21.140]
With a lot of angry terrorist groups at any rate

[02:06:22.020 --> 02:06:22.960]
566, look at that!

[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:25.020]
Actually got a bunch of calls on here and after we shift through

[02:06:25.020 --> 02:06:26.360]
These might get a real one, what do you think?

[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:27.380]
Well, give it a shot

[02:06:27.380 --> 02:06:28.980]
It's through these a few times

[02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.120]
Here's Miami, hello

[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.220]
Hello, now!

[02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:31.860]
Yeah

[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.920]
Yeah, so usually there's something that follows usually, right?

[02:06:37.060 --> 02:06:38.860]
Even with that call, but he has no material

[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:41.120]
Here's Hollywood, hello

[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:42.180]
Okeny El

[02:06:42.180 --> 02:06:42.940]
Yes sir

[02:06:42.940 --> 02:06:45.620]
Ricky Tiki's here, because it's right over those maps

[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:49.780]
Here's the coconut crere, hello

[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.220]
Hey, what's going on, Neil?

[02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:51.900]
Yes sir

[02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:53.220]
A couple things that touched with you

[02:06:53.220 --> 02:06:54.520]
You were talking about Amsterdam yesterday

[02:06:54.520 --> 02:06:57.080]
You weren't digging down too much anymore, what happened?

[02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:01.440]
21-till noon at 560 WQAM

[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:03.940]
Oh my, hello

[02:07:04.660 --> 02:07:06.360]
This is 20-year-old feisty

[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:07.860]
You way up

[02:07:07.860 --> 02:07:10.280]
If you look in the mirror and you wonder where the hell did that hair go?

[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.280]
Remember that song by the Supremes? Where did my hair go?

[02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:13.580]
God, I love that thing

[02:07:13.580 --> 02:07:16.940]
Anyway, almost all men sooner or later start singing that song

[02:07:16.940 --> 02:07:17.820]
Where the hell did it go?

[02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:20.020]
It's vanishing, it's doing a disappearing act

[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:22.740]
Charles Alfie always there to help rescue your head

[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:25.840]
Because for over 25 years now, slippers and millionaires

[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.400]
And everybody in between have been going to Charlie

[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.060]
If you get a great looking head here because they know even the rich guys

[02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.580]
That even if they spend all the money in the world

[02:07:31.580 --> 02:07:34.880]
They can't get a better, more natural looking hair than the natural hair line system

[02:07:34.880 --> 02:07:38.800]
It's 100% undetectable, it's the best in the business to make a long story short

[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:41.780]
So if you're like under the age of 100, see with me it doesn't make any difference

[02:07:41.780 --> 02:07:43.440]
I'm not vain, you know what I mean?

[02:07:43.800 --> 02:07:45.660]
I don't need some phony here on my head

[02:07:45.660 --> 02:07:48.120]
But if you're one of those younger guys who wants to look better

[02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:50.080]
Maybe get a head in life or just get some head

[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:53.040]
Call Charles Alfie or imagine the emergency take advantage of that special

You have nothing to lose but that big grotesque shiny bald spot

[02:08:04.160 --> 02:08:06.760]
Because everybody gets Charlie's 30 day guarantee

[02:08:06.760 --> 02:08:09.040]
If you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells

[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:10.420]
Charlie will give you a full refund

[02:08:10.420 --> 02:08:12.360]

[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:13.400]
He'll give you your money back

[02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:14.940]
So make the call that they ain't get you some hair

[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:17.260]
1-800-321-2413

[02:08:17.260 --> 02:08:20.560]
The choice is here is a silly looking mousey piece or a great looking head of hair

[02:08:20.560 --> 02:08:24.220]
1-800-321-2413 or log out of the website

Charles Alfie Erie.com

[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:28.020]
My name is Michael and local

[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:30.360]
This is 43560

[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.100]
You ain't too way

[02:08:32.100 --> 02:08:36.260]
A young is too young

[02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:42.300]
If you cannot find a song of bomb or rag

[02:08:42.300 --> 02:08:46.300]
If the markets are a drama bomb or rag

[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:49.260]
If the terrorists are crispy

[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:54.260]
Pakistan is looking chimney North Korea is too risky bomb or rag

[02:08:54.260 --> 02:08:58.280]
If we have no allies with a drama rag

[02:08:58.280 --> 02:08:59.220]
Roy! Roy!

[02:08:59.620 --> 02:09:02.180]
If we think that someone's business bomb or rag

[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:03.220]
Roy! Roy!

[02:09:03.380 --> 02:09:05.220]
So to hell with the inspections

[02:09:05.220 --> 02:09:07.160]
Let's look up for the elections

[02:09:07.160 --> 02:09:10.260]
Close your mind and take directions bomb or rag

[02:09:10.260 --> 02:09:11.280]
All right!

[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:14.200]
Fall in line and fall aboard is bomb or rag

[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:18.420]
Four or five exceeds are borders bomb or rag

[02:09:19.120 --> 02:09:21.140]
Whence agree will call the trees

[02:09:21.140 --> 02:09:23.200]
And let's make more than hope this season

[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:26.280]
Even if we have no reasons bomb or rag

[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:27.600]
OOOH OOOH

[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:28.400]
Number 45

[02:09:28.400 --> 02:09:30.420]
Eh, at 560 WQM

[02:09:30.420 --> 02:09:31.840]
George is doing a show today

[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:33.180]
I'm just hanging around

[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:34.500]
560-560

[02:09:34.500 --> 02:09:35.600]
You're letting him go for a second call

[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:36.020]
You're letting him go for 15 minutes

[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:36.580]
Shut up

[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:39.080]
466 votes on the poll

[02:09:39.080 --> 02:09:41.020]
What's your take on the Iraq attack?

[02:09:41.320 --> 02:09:43.340]
It's coming but I'm against it 153

[02:09:44.160 --> 02:09:46.460]
It's mostly about oil 148

[02:09:46.460 --> 02:09:50.040]
It's coming I'm all for it 110 23.6%

[02:09:51.220 --> 02:09:54.260]
Which means 76.4% are not for it

[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:57.800]
It can still be avoided 35, 7.5%

[02:09:57.800 --> 02:09:59.340]
Very naive people out there don't get it

[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:01.740]
And I have no clue 20

[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:03.320]
And you know what?

[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:05.220]
Those must be the 20 people we talk to today

[02:10:05.220 --> 02:10:05.960]
Yeah!

[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:12.880]
Did you read that lame facts, the lame response from the guy that was carrying on about Richard Pearl ought stuff before?

[02:10:13.140 --> 02:10:13.300]
Yes

[02:10:13.300 --> 02:10:14.680]
I don't know if he would answer the question

[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.300]
Yes, he said this a fact about well

[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:19.060]
He was nervous because people recognize his voice

[02:10:19.060 --> 02:10:23.060]
Well if you're too nervous to express what you want then you shouldn't be calling radio talk shows

[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:23.620]
Okay sir

[02:10:25.100 --> 02:10:26.060]
Is that right?

[02:10:26.200 --> 02:10:26.880]
Yeah well yeah

[02:10:29.500 --> 02:10:32.560]
Like anybody that knows him doesn't know what his opinion is about it anyway

[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:33.740]
Hey well maybe not

[02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:34.740]
Who now knows?

[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.120]
Maybe he's in the sensitive job

[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:36.380]
Right

[02:10:36.380 --> 02:10:37.440]
He's leading a double life

[02:10:39.740 --> 02:10:41.820]
See there you go again make in comments

[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:42.300]
Huh?

[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:45.520]
Making all these comments again just because I mentioned Miss Grud

[02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.240]
Oh and Lins after I repeat with the transistor radio when they made that tie in

[02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:50.040]
Made what?

[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:50.400]
Huh?

[02:10:51.460 --> 02:10:52.820]
You're not fooling me

[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:57.520]
Here's how Chris says last Sunday I had the unfortunate displeasure of dining it

[02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:58.500]
Oh look at that

[02:10:58.500 --> 02:10:58.920]
Yeah

[02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:00.960]
Oh Houston's

[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:01.780]
Yeah no it was okay

[02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:03.260]
Well what?

[02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:04.160]

[02:11:04.180 --> 02:11:04.960]
The SPACS

[02:11:06.060 --> 02:11:06.700]
Is what?

[02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.460]
It's worthy it's not about Houston's

[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:09.380]
Well you just relax

[02:11:11.740 --> 02:11:15.180]
Don't give me wrong the food was good but see the info table behind us was the mega celebrity

[02:11:15.180 --> 02:11:18.760]
podcast in over from the fiery highly rated young Paul and Ron show

[02:11:19.180 --> 02:11:24.260]
I've ever seen Fat Paul before when he approached our table and asked us what radio station we listen to

[02:11:24.260 --> 02:11:28.280]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:31.700]
responded with, I only listened to Neil, the rest of the table all stated that they

[02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:36.100]
listened to CDs. That's when Paul announced himself as a staple of South Florida

[02:11:36.100 --> 02:11:40.320]
rock radio or Uncle Paulie. He gave the table tickets to some

[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:43.460]
Bolshevik concert and then just before he said goodbye, I asked him if it was true

[02:11:43.460 --> 02:11:46.560]
that he was trying to get Moe's show. He then went on to tell me, first of all,

[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:50.060]
he doesn't do the kind of show that would work on QAIM and secondly, I wouldn't

[02:11:50.060 --> 02:11:53.900]
work with a bunch of old fat sports announcers. You're a liar, Paul, as usual.

[02:11:53.900 --> 02:11:58.720]
You are a freaking liar, desperately trying to get that show. Desperately, I

[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:01.780]
responded with you can't say that your two-day show was Neil's Monday show.

[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:04.820]
That's when he freaked, asked for the tickets back and went back to his table.

[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:09.940]
Have a Hectic Day, Paul. Feel better, Chris. Thank you, Chris. How do you like that?

[02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.500]
He freaked out and took his tickets back. You can take your ticket and...

[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:15.440]
Right. He probably made it into a...

[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:21.460]
Lions sack a crap. You freaking liar. And this wasn't the first time he was sucking

[02:12:21.460 --> 02:12:24.260]
around for a job there. I remember years ago, like in a second year or the

[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:29.000]
so we were there, calling up Duff and everybody else in the building, sucking

[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:32.720]
around heavy duty, trying to get in there. And now that his contract, I guess, was

[02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:37.500]
coming to win a heaven PD Lenny be the pimp not once but twice. Twice calling me to

[02:12:37.500 --> 02:12:44.160]
go suck around trying to get him on a morning show. No chance, Paulie, okay?

[02:12:45.260 --> 02:12:49.880]
Even Moe's material to tent time as bad as it is, is lame as it is. And at least

[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:53.880]
he's fodder for you know what I'm saying? That's what Greg said. I said, how

[02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:56.980]
come we got him? And he said, for your fodder, for your fodder. This is better.

[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:02.760]
Then sex. See? There you go. At least he's some good fodder. But as far as

[02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:06.320]
Castor Nova is concerned, but that's still a little bull crap of his. Man.

[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:17.080]
Here's a call from Davy. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I'm here. Sorry, I wanted to get you off the speaker there.

[02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:20.740]
Thank you. I just want to let you know that I'm definitely listening and I'm not

[02:13:20.740 --> 02:13:25.160]
calling to ask any stupid questions about answer dam or tell you that I'm Eddie or

[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:29.260]
anything like that. Oh, it's my question. I have a couple questions for you.

[02:13:29.380 --> 02:13:33.000]
Well, why does everybody have questions? Don't you have anything to assert on your

[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.500]
own like to say? Yeah. Why does everybody say I got a couple of questions? Well,

[02:13:36.940 --> 02:13:40.580]
the real reason I can't find the answer. That's why I'm asking you. But yeah, well,

[02:13:40.640 --> 02:13:43.040]
my thing is this. First of all, I mean, I don't want to think I'm pretty

[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.200]
used to the choir, but again, definitely you're hitting home here. And whenever I talk to

[02:13:47.200 --> 02:13:50.600]
people about what we're about to do this country and I say, we're the ones that

[02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.360]
are being betrayed as the terrorists here. This is not about terrorism. This is about

[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:58.220]
oil. This is about our finances. And everybody, you know, I used to think that people

[02:13:58.220 --> 02:14:01.900]
will actually rationally mind it, but it's coming to a point now where most people

[02:14:01.900 --> 02:14:05.540]
are starting to say, well, I'm the one that's crazy. I'm buying into these, you

[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:11.860]
know, quote unquote, conspiracy theories. And and I'm curious. It's, you know, sometimes

[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:16.960]
people will say, oh, well, we are descendants of an air dentist, snipe, foot off, we say.

[02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:20.420]
And then some people say, well, constitutionally, we're not allowed to do that. And my

[02:14:20.420 --> 02:14:23.520]
question for you is that you might know this is I definitely don't know this answer.

[02:14:23.640 --> 02:14:27.940]
The order is already been put out. It's the directive has already been put out for

[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:33.060]
a foreign assassination. Yes. It's that constitutionally loud. It was not. It doesn't

[02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:36.720]
matter. I mean, obviously this regime that we have in an office doesn't care. But I was

[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:39.920]
just curious. I mean, why do we stop the centripetent if that's been done?

[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:45.880]
I don't want to suggest that you sound a little bit naive. I know. I know. I know. I

[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:49.620]
know. Our government has had their finger in the assassination of many world figures.

[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:53.500]
Yeah. I know that that's why I figured I just, you know, what I have friends in the

[02:14:53.500 --> 02:14:58.400]
military is it's interesting that the military is equally divided amongst its members, if

[02:14:58.400 --> 02:15:02.800]
you will. It's like I say to some of them. The attempt at assassination of Castor by

[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:08.820]
the CIA is legendary. President, DM, Selveter, I end there. There's a long list. Yeah. I

[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:13.580]
agree. I just, I just, we're going to lose so many people here. So many of our young men

[02:15:13.580 --> 02:15:18.940]
and women. Not to mention whatever we're going to stir up. It's going to be the excuse for

[02:15:18.940 --> 02:15:22.420]
all of the history that's going to start. Plus they keep talking every night on the news

[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:25.820]
now about all the out kind of recruits that we're going to create for them now with all

[02:15:25.820 --> 02:15:30.500]
this hostility. That's the huge point. We're all in a situation worse by not eliminating

[02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:34.520]
the ultimate problem and I know the fact that we've been, they keep including Tony Blair

[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:38.060]
screaming about all 12 years. We've been waiting for them to eliminate his weapons of

[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:42.580]
destruction. Yeah, whatever thing. During the 12 years, we've been able to contain him.

[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:47.080]
He hasn't invaded any other countries. He has stolen a freight train. And as far as gassing

[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.500]
his own people, he did that fact when he was our guy and we thought it was a good guy.

[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:54.360]
That's exactly right. But if I try to tell people that they think I'm crazy and the other

[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:57.660]
thing I have to say is, just remember one thing sir. Most American people are as stupid

[02:15:57.660 --> 02:16:01.760]
as sawdust. I don't ever forget it. I, you know, I'm blown away because then I read

[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.460]
about, you know, North Korea. They're the ultimate threat. This man has gone ahead and said,

[02:16:05.460 --> 02:16:09.440]
we can hit California. Well, they're not that true. I don't know. But that statement is out

[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:13.200]
there. But the news is not even touching Korea. Right now. Here's, here's Colin Powell

[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:18.300]
in South Korea yesterday and CNN shows him and they put on the crawl. I mentioned this yesterday

[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:22.280]
about our close ties with Japan and South Korea. And then if you watch some of the other

[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:26.920]
shows, the more obscure shows, and then they're quoting again, the newly elected President

[02:16:26.920 --> 02:16:30.360]
of South Korea saying, we ought to get the hell out of there and about the, we ought to

[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:35.140]
stop trying to use our bully tactics. He'd like to see us get our 38,000 troops out of

[02:16:35.140 --> 02:16:38.440]
there. So, you know, again, if you're paying the attention to what you see on the major

[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:42.560]
networks, you're never going to find out what's going to go on. I only go news insider. I

[02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:46.820]
just just, all they are our peddlers of propaganda. They're, they're obedient servants to

[02:16:46.820 --> 02:16:52.280]
whoever happens to be in power. We're the one to, who know, this is, this is so sad. I

[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:55.500]
feel like my wheels are spinning and I'm trying to tell people, but what can I do? It's,

[02:16:55.500 --> 02:16:59.420]
it's unreal. And that's my last question for you with this, this move, with a move on

[02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:06.560]
to Washington.org. Move on or dot org. Move on, move on.org. And this is a virtual protest.

[02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:10.300]
Virtual march on Washington's going on all day today. They're sending letters to the

[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:13.640]
senators to the White House. They're lighting up the switchboards. They want to get over

[02:17:13.640 --> 02:17:17.520]
a hundred calls an hour to each of the senators. All right. I'm on it right now. Okay. Thank

[02:17:17.520 --> 02:17:21.720]
you. Thanks so much. Okay. Oh, there's one. Oh, but I'm almost three hours. We've got

[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:26.320]
the comedy bits starting. I know we've got one guy. Almost makes it worth it, huh? I

[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.840]
don't know. I mean, maybe there are other people out there don't have to call us to get

[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:35.180]
involved in an amateur. We got other people, right? Says if all goes as planned today, the

[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:39.660]
throngs of anti-war protestors from all over America will virtually take over the US Senate.

[02:17:41.060 --> 02:17:44.800]
On the heels of the recent worldwide demonstration for peace and which activists used email to

[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:49.160]
call demonstrators to national capitals around the globe, advocates for a peaceful resolution

[02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:55.160]
of the conflict with Iraq are touting a national cyber march on Washington. Mindful that people

[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:58.880]
now live in an era where computer dating and internet shopping are common. They're promoting

[02:17:58.880 --> 02:18:03.280]
electronic dissent as an alternative to the kind of massive anti-war demonstrations of

[02:18:03.280 --> 02:18:08.020]
a generation ago armed with new forms of communication, opponents of the Bush administration's

[02:18:08.020 --> 02:18:12.240]
military build up in the Middle East, plan to light up Senate switchboards today, overwhelm

[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:16.460]
the capital with the sound of ringing telephones and deliver a simultaneous crush of email

[02:18:16.460 --> 02:18:20.820]
and faxes. Organizers say each of the nation's hundred senators and the White House will be

[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:26.280]
deluge with hundreds of calls from constituents with the same message, no war. They'll hear

[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:30.440]
loud and clear from their constituents, regular Americans in Florida and nationwide urging

[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:35.340]
them to let the inspections work said Peter Sherman, executive officer of moveon.org.

[02:18:35.920 --> 02:18:40.000]
The campaign was launched from the website's West Coast headquarters on February 20th since

[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.740]
then more than 80,000 people nationwide have volunteered to call their senators and

[02:18:43.740 --> 02:18:48.700]
another 65,000 logged out of their computers to send faxes organizers said on Monday. Less

[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:53.480]
than 24 hours after the campaign got underway, so many Florida protesters had signed on that

[02:18:53.480 --> 02:18:56.920]
senators Bob Graham and Bill Nelson each can expect more than a hundred calls an hour,

[02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:02.300]
human said. It's just one more way to do it said Cara Campbell who co-chairs the Broward

[02:19:02.300 --> 02:19:07.540]
County Green Party. It's just a gradual grinding against the war machine. Representatives

[02:19:07.540 --> 02:19:10.780]
of Graham and Nelson learned of the virtual protest last weekend of directed staffers

[02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:18.320]
who to be prepared said press secretaries in both our offices. No sense of reading

[02:19:18.320 --> 02:19:22.420]
all the rest of this, but if you want to find out more about it, you can click on to moveon.org

[02:19:22.420 --> 02:19:25.820]
or you can also go out and just go to our website if you want to your writers.com and we

[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:32.540]

representative of our thinking.

[02:22:10.080 --> 02:22:10.540]
Oh,

First you get down on your knees, fiddle with your rosaries.

[02:24:11.500 --> 02:24:18.560]
Bow your head with great respect and change your flex, change your flex, change your flex.

[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:25.400]
So whatever steps you want if you have cleared them with the ponds and everybody say it's on

[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.860]
Keri, O'Leah's on doing the bans and again ride.

[02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:47.440]

[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:58.980]
take the wine and chew the wafer till four six days. I'll climb to friend's substantiates.

[02:24:58.980 --> 02:25:07.460]
So get down upon your knees, fiddle with your rosaries. Bow your head with great respect and change your flex, change your flex, change your flex.

[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:12.660]
Make a cross on your abdomen when in Rome, do like a Roman, our Bain Maria.

[02:25:13.100 --> 02:25:17.740]
She's good to see you. Get an exiled again, start a dramatic and a dude in the bain and a ride.

[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:36.780]
Roger Mary, Roger Mary, now the post depends on you and the powers you possess.

[02:25:37.680 --> 02:25:43.640]
Six years' age is life, with your flight scissors, life, he's got a job where you'll get to.

[02:25:48.500 --> 02:25:57.220]
Roger Mary, Roger Mary, you have a brand new style too.

[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:05.580]
We love the way you want your doom, with the make me and your chest and full bruise,

[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:09.320]
and I guess, they'll make those who are afraid.

[02:26:19.840 --> 02:26:26.440]
Who's with the speed of a gazelle, send the bad guy straight to hell,

[02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:34.560]
when the killings gar隻 low with no units, then we know, you're thrashing crows with both my knee�� smooth.

[02:26:42.020 --> 02:26:43.320]
Where's the running,

[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:11.120]
There is a girl in extra-wide jeans, a girl who's head weighs a ton, and she's

[02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:21.060]
in with the women and the funny plate's eyes in the house of the ladies' deans.

[02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:33.160]
When she was young at a restaurant with a boy, he didn't know that she was gay.

[02:27:33.160 --> 02:27:45.020]
Until he noticed each time they went out, she went for the seafood buffet.

[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:53.040]
Just look at all those inside sisters now.

[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:57.700]
Just look what they have done.

[02:27:57.700 --> 02:28:09.900]
The minute she comes home from work through that door, well off her panties come.

[02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:22.760]
She laid it down to stop publishing the rosy mag, left a laid off staff not paid.

[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:34.760]
And Rose is girlfriend who's pregnant right now, I guess she just only got laid.

[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:46.700]
There is a girl with extra-wide jeans, entertainer, she's become.

[02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:59.640]
And she goes by the name of Rosie O'Dee in the house of the ladies' deans.

[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:10.820]
I'm not gonna retire, I'm in a governor's face to run this state.

[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:15.380]
I'm throwing my hat in her ring, as soon as I get done shaking this thing.

[02:29:15.380 --> 02:29:21.960]
I'm falling apart by braiding too much, I'm not that enough of these shades, or maybe it's something I ate.

[02:29:32.100 --> 02:29:38.120]
I've been laying around here since the new administration's been in place, just growing some

[02:29:38.120 --> 02:29:41.740]
air in my pits, picking the scats off my legs.

[02:29:42.120 --> 02:29:46.780]
So I'm on a run and can see other younger brothers that came out dumb.

[02:29:47.380 --> 02:29:50.740]
I'm gonna sit on the crappies done, do far it off.

[02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:56.840]
A wife should it matter, if a lesbian decides to run.

[02:29:58.000 --> 02:29:59.540]
Has anybody seen this wife?

[02:30:00.340 --> 02:30:03.020]
Do not wait, wait, what do I say?

[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:03.900]
There are two.

[02:30:04.140 --> 02:30:05.880]
This house is America, a lesbian.

[02:30:08.260 --> 02:30:10.620]
I like the footage, she keeps.

[02:30:12.340 --> 02:30:14.140]
My gosh, it's all that's hot.

[02:30:16.600 --> 02:30:19.160]
Far we have pretty much the same music.

[02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:21.840]
But this is just a sticker.

[02:30:23.360 --> 02:30:24.940]
It loves it, go on.

[02:30:31.080 --> 02:30:34.380]
Turn this shingle lock machine off and down.

[02:30:34.720 --> 02:30:36.160]
It's a exciting opera room.

[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:40.380]
It's the last final episode of Captain Kangaroo.

[02:30:41.180 --> 02:30:48.220]
Hi boys and girls, your old friend of the captain doesn't feel so good today because he was out late with Mr. Jean's last night.

[02:30:48.220 --> 02:30:50.160]
Hi captain, shut up, moose to my head.

[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:51.500]
What's the matter captain?

[02:30:51.640 --> 02:30:55.760]
I've been wearing this stinking uniform for 30 years and this is the thanks I get.

[02:30:56.280 --> 02:30:56.720]
Canceled.

[02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.880]
What am I supposed to be, anyway, a conductor?

[02:30:59.260 --> 02:31:00.700]
Conductor Kangaroo, huh?

[02:31:00.940 --> 02:31:02.000]
You're scaring me captain.

[02:31:02.200 --> 02:31:04.480]
Oh, can't be a moosey-moosey, I'm a good guy.

[02:31:04.880 --> 02:31:06.340]
I never even touched anybody.

[02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:11.100]
Now like that, Mr. Green Jeans, you know how many bunny rabbit puppets we've been through on this show?

[02:31:11.240 --> 02:31:11.640]
No.

[02:31:11.880 --> 02:31:14.500]
35, everyone to what happened to all those bunny rabbits?

[02:31:14.500 --> 02:31:15.660]
Oh, god, captain.

[02:31:15.980 --> 02:31:19.560]
You're a moosey-moosey, community little friend, Mr. Electric Well-Dead.

[02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:25.120]
The last final episode of Captain Kangaroo entitled The Captain Has a Bad Day.

[02:31:25.340 --> 02:31:28.240]
It can be yours for just 1995 in local video stores.

[02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:30.860]
Video treasure chest. We've got rooms of this crap.

[02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:37.720]
Music

[02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:47.180]
Dear Alanis, I don't know if you remember me,

[02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:51.840]
But I was the guy whose house you've said I'm fire last year.

[02:31:53.100 --> 02:31:58.140]
God, I miss you, even though you blew up my car.

[02:31:58.580 --> 02:32:02.120]
Cut all my hair off, I miss you girl.

[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.640]
But one quick question, do you think you could let me know

[02:32:08.640 --> 02:32:12.420]
When you might let me out of this pit?

[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:15.840]
No one's fed me for weeks, but I'm not complaining.

[02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:19.880]
Don't misunderstand me, because I love you with all my heart.

[02:32:19.880 --> 02:32:25.540]
But if you happen to see my mother, please let it know I'm not dead yet.

[02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:34.540]
Dear Alanis, I want to tell you that the guy you saw with your best friend that wasn't me.

[02:32:35.120 --> 02:32:40.960]
He might have looked and talked just like me, but that's surely purely coincidental.

[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:43.540]
I was nowhere near that place.

[02:32:43.960 --> 02:32:46.800]
I love you too much to look at anyone else.

[02:32:46.800 --> 02:32:52.160]
Dear Alanis, I had a dentist appointment that day.

[02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:56.400]
I was nowhere near the shared metal lips hotel.

[02:32:57.020 --> 02:33:01.200]
I would never cheat on somebody who treats me so good,

[02:33:01.460 --> 02:33:05.000]
And wins all those rannies as all that money.

[02:33:05.600 --> 02:33:06.940]
Make him out, let me out of the pit.

[02:33:07.840 --> 02:33:10.180]
So speaking of the virtual march on Washington,

[02:33:10.400 --> 02:33:13.540]
You don't think the Freepers would just let that go and run its course?

[02:33:13.780 --> 02:33:14.440]
Of course not.

[02:33:14.440 --> 02:33:18.560]

Smoke it in the bathroom making out in the hall or hit in a fat kid with a speeding dodgeball.

Some scenes may be disturbing for younger viewers.

[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:22.820]
I was having a pretty good date with Reefus.

[02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:27.500]
The real tall guy with the one tooth in the beer belly and the spank my monkey tank top.

[02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:30.200]
When all the sudden, she just died.

[02:37:30.500 --> 02:37:33.620]
Bachelorette in Arkansas. This fall on Fox.

[02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:43.220]
I thought Kristy and he was very pale.

[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:48.300]
This religious thing was not for me.

[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:52.760]
They held a big convention.

[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.780]

[02:37:56.800 --> 02:38:00.860]
I don't idea what I was about to see.

[02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.320]
They were speaking in tongues.

[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:06.400]
That made me a believer.

[02:38:10.140 --> 02:38:10.620]
Okay.

[02:38:12.380 --> 02:38:13.260]
That was interesting.

[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:15.940]
Alright, we have no idea what just happened.

[02:38:16.100 --> 02:38:16.900]
Here's an idea, Carlos.

[02:38:17.020 --> 02:38:19.840]
Why don't you go into the control room and make sure that somebody in there didn't do anything.

[02:38:21.000 --> 02:38:22.760]
I'll just thank goodness I'm here.

[02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:24.900]
Normally I'm walking around enjoying the bits.

[02:38:24.900 --> 02:38:27.280]
Maybe cleaning up in the studio.

[02:38:27.540 --> 02:38:28.620]
Spraying some windex on stuff.

[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:28.940]
Are you there?

[02:38:29.100 --> 02:38:30.120]
Are you back?

[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:33.240]
There you are.

[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.740]
The night will now embrace me.

[02:38:39.460 --> 02:38:41.440]
I bet my tongue to the beat.

[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:45.840]
I'll tell you what ever I do, ill forgive me.

[02:38:46.820 --> 02:38:47.460]
Oh!

[02:38:47.780 --> 02:38:48.860]
That's now I speak in tongues.

[02:38:49.860 --> 02:38:52.240]
But that makes me a believer.

[02:38:53.780 --> 02:38:55.060]
And I'm having fun.

[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:58.420]
Playing round with my mouth.

[02:38:58.820 --> 02:38:59.680]
I'm over there.

[02:38:59.860 --> 02:39:01.200]
I speak in tongues.

[02:39:01.680 --> 02:39:03.080]
I'm over there.

[02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:06.140]

I'm over there.

[02:39:08.940 --> 02:39:11.700]
We play a cat in mouse game with the police.

[02:39:11.700 --> 02:39:14.180]
Sniper man, sniper man.

[02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:16.740]
I'm friendly neighborhood sniper man.

[02:39:17.140 --> 02:39:19.160]
When we get Jim, he will fall.

[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:22.400]
Hang him up by the hair of his balls on the lookout.

[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:25.120]
For that sniper man.

[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:29.260]
Sniper man, sniper man.

[02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:31.780]
Gonna get just sniper man.

[02:39:32.160 --> 02:39:33.700]
On your ass, Charlie Moose.

[02:39:34.500 --> 02:39:36.540]
You'll have your testicles in a newspaper.

[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:39.700]
There is the sniper man.

[02:39:39.700 --> 02:39:42.860]
She boosted a person who left us a message.

[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:44.620]
You gave us a telephone number.

[02:39:44.940 --> 02:39:46.300]
We do want to talk to you.

[02:39:46.480 --> 02:39:48.200]
Call us at the number you provide.

[02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:50.100]
Public dialogue continued.

[02:39:50.480 --> 02:39:53.260]
The person you call, but not here everything that you say.

[02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.800]
Call us back so that we can clearly understand.

[02:39:56.080 --> 02:39:57.080]
We want to get it right.

[02:39:57.200 --> 02:39:57.980]
Is he sneaky?

[02:39:58.380 --> 02:39:59.100]
Listen bud.

[02:39:59.440 --> 02:40:01.600]
He's only out for the spill of blood.

[02:40:02.020 --> 02:40:04.220]
When the case is finally cracked.

[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:06.560]
We'll put up my son his crotal sack.

[02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:07.260]
Look out.

[02:40:07.680 --> 02:40:10.480]
Where is the sniper man now?

[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:12.920]
Look everywhere we can now.

[02:40:13.380 --> 02:40:16.620]
Where is the sniper man now?

[02:40:24.540 --> 02:40:28.380]
Oh, I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:40:29.220 --> 02:40:32.980]

[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:37.340]

Ever since this presidential race began.

[02:40:51.340 --> 02:40:54.180]
I've been wondered who was going to win.

[02:40:55.360 --> 02:40:59.080]
Some of each people went to do their voting show.

[02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:04.080]
So count up all the ballots and find out who's gotten more.

[02:41:06.440 --> 02:41:10.220]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[02:41:10.780 --> 02:41:13.600]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes too.

[02:41:13.960 --> 02:41:16.340]
Patrick, you can end.

[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.320]
So I'd like to know who won the election.

[02:41:23.320 --> 02:41:26.820]

[02:41:40.680 --> 02:41:44.260]
The final tabulation started coming in.

[02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:48.300]
Then I saw a new splash on Channel 10.

[02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:53.120]
Some angry people all together in a bunch.

[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:58.160]
They said they were confused and didn't know which hold a punch.

[02:42:00.460 --> 02:42:04.260]
Those old folks seem to have one thing in common.

[02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:07.640]
Looks like lots of them just keep their votes too.

[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:09.780]

[02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:16.360]

Council vote, council vote, maybe council vote.

[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:40.560]

[02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:48.140]
Council vote, are there any more?

[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:50.640]
Council vote, did they step to the end in half?

[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:52.520]
Yeah, lots of comments about one more time when you say.

[02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:54.100]

It's probably out there wildest expectations.

[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:09.640]
The senators are all saying this is the largest cyber space response of any kind that's ever happened.

[02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:14.240]
How is the reaction you're getting? How is it going? So we're putting these pieces together

[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:18.420]
We won't know ultimately the exact how it's probably at the end of the day

[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:21.080]
But we have a pretty good idea that there are hundreds well

[02:43:21.080 --> 02:43:25.080]
We know that there are hundreds and hundreds of thousands coming in I would expect it'll top a million by the end of the day

[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:29.840]

[02:53:09.260 --> 02:53:11.740]
To give him to me and say you heard

[02:53:11.740 --> 02:53:12.580]
Oh where's Brian?

[02:53:13.160 --> 02:53:15.400]
Hard work good and hard work fine

[02:53:15.400 --> 02:53:17.620]
But first take care of him

[02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:21.100]
That's why I hope to join in the morning

[02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:23.660]
I hope to join tonight

[02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:27.480]
I hope to join in the afternoon

[02:53:27.480 --> 02:53:29.900]
He makes me feel alright

[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:34.100]
I hope to join this time of week

[02:53:34.100 --> 02:53:36.400]
And doing time of war

[02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:40.240]
I hope to join before I hope to join

[02:53:40.240 --> 02:53:42.400]
And then I hope to more

[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:45.360]
Oh to join that's what I do

[02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:50.580]
Oh to join

[02:53:50.580 --> 02:53:54.780]
I hope to join with me every morning

[02:53:54.780 --> 02:53:56.880]
Oh to join

[02:53:56.880 --> 02:54:00.780]
I hope to join with me every afternoon

[02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:01.200]
Yeah

[02:54:01.200 --> 02:54:03.140]
Oh to join

[02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:04.960]
Hey, would you rather hope to join

[02:54:04.960 --> 02:54:07.180]
Someone's father, you're home, aren't you?

[02:54:07.780 --> 02:54:09.380]
Oh to join

[02:54:09.380 --> 02:54:10.820]
I know you want to say that

[02:54:10.820 --> 02:54:15.660]
Oh to join

[02:54:20.580 --> 02:54:21.820]
I know you want to do

[02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:28.520]
I know you want to do

[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:30.280]
21 to 1 to 560 WDQ

[02:54:30.280 --> 02:54:32.860]
I'm 575 votes on a poll not too shabby

[02:54:32.860 --> 02:54:34.920]
What was going on before with the audio?

[02:54:35.220 --> 02:54:35.900]
Was that on the audio?

[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:37.900]
Yeah, well you told me

[02:54:38.520 --> 02:54:42.060]
Who was in the before room running some wires and tripping over several

[02:54:42.060 --> 02:54:43.180]
I see

[02:54:43.180 --> 02:54:45.100]
Well maybe if he lost an answer too

[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:46.980]
He'd get around a little bit better

[02:54:48.660 --> 02:54:49.840]
575 votes on a poll

[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:51.440]
What's your take on the Iraq attack?

[02:54:51.440 --> 02:54:52.880]
It's coming but I'm against it

[02:54:53.540 --> 02:54:54.960]
234.7%

[02:54:54.960 --> 02:54:58.000]
It's mostly about oil, OIL 168

[02:54:58.680 --> 02:55:00.200]
It's coming them all for it

[02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:02.360]
141.24.5%

[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:04.700]
It can still be avoided

[02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:06.460]
44.7.5%

[02:55:06.460 --> 02:55:07.280]
And I have no clue

[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:10.600]
No clue, 22 with no clue

[02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.180]
5 and the local

[02:55:12.180 --> 02:55:14.000]
This is 560

[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:15.920]
The radio is on your side

[02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:16.620]
AHHHHH!

[02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:17.820]
QAM

[02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:21.320]
5.7.5% I only had one eye

[02:55:25.620 --> 02:55:27.660]
You made me cry

[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:34.440]
What a song the news is hard to believe

[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:39.060]
Michael Jackson just married Melissa Marie's a weirdo

[02:55:40.060 --> 02:55:41.360]
He's a weirdo

[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:44.500]
And baby that's no lie

[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:49.460]
Because of their one thing

[02:55:49.460 --> 02:55:50.840]
That she don't need

[02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:52.900]
It's a more tabloid publicity

[02:55:52.900 --> 02:55:54.680]
With a weirdo

[02:55:55.980 --> 02:55:57.620]
He's a weirdo

[02:55:57.620 --> 02:56:00.220]
I guess that I don't understand

[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:04.020]
Though she want a man in there

[02:56:04.020 --> 02:56:07.660]
And the sky ain't a lot of not underway

[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:11.340]
The guy ain't like you and me

[02:56:12.060 --> 02:56:14.360]
He ain't got no jinky

[02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:18.000]
But I just cannot turn my head

[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:20.480]
I really think he's gay

[02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:23.060]
Well my stomach turns

[02:56:26.700 --> 02:56:29.820]
He's a girl in men with a plastic nose

[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:32.620]
Probably pants his round in a pantyhose

[02:56:32.620 --> 02:56:34.000]
He's a weirdo

[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:36.580]
He's a weirdo

[02:56:37.580 --> 02:56:40.740]
Well now being dead ain't so bad

[02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:44.260]
Cause he won't ever get to call me dead

[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:48.500]
He's a weirdo

[02:56:48.500 --> 02:56:51.660]
I'm kinda glad I died

[02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:54.580]
He's a weirdo

[02:57:04.940 --> 02:57:05.780]
Oh

[02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:06.700]
Oh no like

[02:57:07.860 --> 02:57:09.620]
All the Harper

[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:15.360]
Don't know, don't know every time I see

[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:17.960]
Don't know, don't know

[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:20.960]
That retard it didn't win

[02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.780]
Don't know, don't know

[02:57:23.780 --> 02:57:26.000]
My TV

[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:29.200]
He's president of the

[02:57:29.200 --> 02:57:29.420]
S***

[02:57:29.960 --> 02:57:32.600]
Rap publicant bustled in

[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:35.100]
And in our takin' lit idiots

[02:57:35.100 --> 02:57:37.100]
I don't know why

[02:57:37.100 --> 02:57:39.080]
They want his watches

[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:41.180]
Yeah but no he's here

[02:57:41.180 --> 02:57:44.260]
First through the neck for years

[02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:45.960]
With president of the S***

[02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:48.940]
Oh what the f***

[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:53.500]
Oh what I get to

[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:55.780]
No vote for sport

[02:57:56.400 --> 02:58:00.800]
And get to win your voted vote

[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:03.020]
Why?

[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.100]
If you want this

[02:58:06.100 --> 02:58:11.400]
Don't know the lips drumming stupidly

[02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:15.060]
Don't know the whole mind

[02:58:15.060 --> 02:58:17.660]
This drum can reach fit

[02:58:17.660 --> 02:58:19.680]
Don't know the whole mind

[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:20.440]
He's even

[02:58:21.060 --> 02:58:22.480]
Number than me

[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:25.480]
He's president of the S***

[02:58:26.060 --> 02:58:28.480]
Yeah don't care what it's all

[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:31.400]
You got a man by hook or cross

[02:58:31.400 --> 02:58:32.320]
The Christian

[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.460]
Oh, it's all what best of you and I

[02:58:35.460 --> 02:58:37.140]
But have no fear

[02:58:38.060 --> 02:58:39.780]
We've got a great leader here

[02:58:39.780 --> 02:58:42.300]
With president of the S***

[02:58:46.220 --> 02:58:47.840]
Where's the name of the S***

[02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:50.940]
Where's the name of the S***

[02:58:50.940 --> 02:58:52.520]
Oh, come on

[02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:56.880]
Look out, Saturn

[02:58:56.880 --> 02:58:58.640]
Say, look out, Saturn

[02:58:58.640 --> 02:59:00.780]
You see George Bush has got your name

[02:59:00.780 --> 02:59:01.880]
Look out, Saturn

[02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:04.280]
Say, he says we know

[02:59:05.060 --> 02:59:07.280]
We know just what you're doing

[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:08.600]
Look out, Saturn

[02:59:08.600 --> 02:59:10.500]
Say, you've been a very 94

[02:59:11.060 --> 02:59:12.240]
A very 94

[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:14.480]
Oh, try to build upon your use

[02:59:15.320 --> 02:59:17.640]
Oh, Saturn, he'll get you

[02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:19.560]
He'll get you

[02:59:20.240 --> 02:59:22.640]
He's got some misses pointed at you

[02:59:23.240 --> 02:59:25.700]
And he'd love to bomb and rock

[02:59:27.520 --> 02:59:30.860]
Back into the middle ages he'd love to

[02:59:31.980 --> 02:59:34.300]
He'd love to, love to, love to, love to

[02:59:35.300 --> 02:59:37.100]
George W is the president

[02:59:37.100 --> 02:59:38.860]
He is the president

[02:59:38.860 --> 02:59:40.820]
And Congress wants him to explain

[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:44.920]
They say what to do

[02:59:44.920 --> 02:59:47.200]
What do you think you're doing?

[02:59:47.600 --> 02:59:48.920]
What do you think you're doing?

[02:59:49.120 --> 02:59:50.680]
He says we're gonna take him out

[02:59:50.680 --> 02:59:52.440]
Go on and take him out

[02:59:52.440 --> 02:59:54.420]
I'll get this news

[02:59:54.420 --> 02:59:56.920]
Same bomb, side of me

[02:59:56.920 --> 02:59:57.580]
Loved you

[02:59:57.580 --> 02:59:59.640]
He loved you

[02:59:59.640 --> 03:00:02.740]
Shoot about your missiles at you

[03:00:02.740 --> 03:00:05.720]
Yeah, he'd love to bomb and rock

[03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:09.960]
Back into the middle ages

[03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:10.820]
He'd love to

[03:00:10.820 --> 03:00:14.280]
He loved you, loved you, loved you, loved you

[03:00:14.280 --> 03:00:16.960]
He loved you, loved you, loved you

[03:00:17.480 --> 03:00:20.500]
Let's turn this mother out

[03:00:20.500 --> 03:00:25.720]
Pop the magic wrapper is on my TV

[03:00:25.720 --> 03:00:29.120]
No one heard of him before

[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:31.400]
Oh, his name is PuffTetti

[03:00:31.400 --> 03:00:33.140]
I said that's Puff

[03:00:33.140 --> 03:00:37.780]
The magic wrapper won't be here then long

[03:00:37.780 --> 03:00:44.540]
Not unless he learns to sing on the right of the friggin song, I said,

[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:54.300]
Pop the magic rapper is all over empty me, only because someone shot no glorious

[03:00:54.300 --> 03:01:01.620]
FBI G. Matt guy maybe someone should tell him making it his way is wrong

[03:01:02.600 --> 03:01:07.840]
Taking at your dead best friends to King, flesh and ball,

[03:01:08.480 --> 03:01:11.580]
Snoop Doggy Doggy Doggy Doggy on the ball track.

[03:01:11.700 --> 03:01:13.560]
That's a one and five, 60 we got the mad doggy one,

[03:01:13.640 --> 03:01:15.880]
and we got the Jill and Mark for Hank this afternoon.

[03:01:16.320 --> 03:01:16.840]
Alright.

[03:01:17.340 --> 03:01:19.380]
This fact from Todd and Hollywood is somewhat disturbing,

[03:01:19.440 --> 03:01:21.400]
but you know, it's part of the course of QIM.

[03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:25.800]
Says you'll be glad to know I can hear Neil talking during the spots,

[03:01:25.860 --> 03:01:29.120]
I'm wearing headphones at work, his voice isn't particularly loud.

[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:29.920]
Thank God.

[03:01:30.580 --> 03:01:32.640]
And it cuts it in out, but it's there nonetheless.

[03:01:34.060 --> 03:01:36.960]
WQM just can't go global, can they, more like globules.

[03:01:37.860 --> 03:01:39.880]
Love your show, please play Elvis, he's weirdo.

[03:01:39.960 --> 03:01:40.720]
I think I just did it tonight.

[03:01:40.940 --> 03:01:41.040]
Yes.

[03:01:41.860 --> 03:01:42.400]
Todd and Hollywood.

[03:01:42.600 --> 03:01:43.680]
Thank you, chronic Todd and Hollywood.

[03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:44.380]
Thanks for the warning.

[03:01:44.820 --> 03:01:47.360]
So what I've been saying, mother, all these other things ever said.

[03:01:47.560 --> 03:01:48.360]
Well, it's an extra treat.

[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:49.100]
Yeah.

[03:01:50.280 --> 03:01:52.500]
So, other than that, maybe the programming geniuses

[03:01:52.500 --> 03:01:53.500]
are taking the day off today,

[03:01:54.880 --> 03:01:57.180]
because I've had an awful lot more than usual,

[03:01:57.340 --> 03:01:58.440]
usually there's not much of any.

[03:01:58.840 --> 03:01:59.700]
A lot of chatter today.

[03:02:00.060 --> 03:02:01.040]
A lot of chatter going on.

[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.800]
In fact, maybe that's the reason we got this a racquetek coming

[03:02:03.800 --> 03:02:04.460]
too much chatter.

[03:02:07.080 --> 03:02:09.280]
Because most of the time I was especially early in the show

[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:10.400]
and I was trying to get a hold of Carlos.

[03:02:10.780 --> 03:02:12.360]
He was on the hallway with some faggot.

[03:02:14.540 --> 03:02:15.360]
Shall we list them?

[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:16.100]
No.

[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:17.260]
Not yet.

[03:02:17.720 --> 03:02:19.640]
12.51 at 5.60 W.D.Q.

[03:02:19.680 --> 03:02:22.660]
I can't believe that, let's see, my 27th anniversary on Saturday.

[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:25.820]
And right now, the 25th anniversary for Brandy's shoes.

[03:02:25.980 --> 03:02:27.520]
They've been around almost as long as me and town.

[03:02:28.020 --> 03:02:30.040]
Any independent family shoester that's been around here

[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:32.960]
the quarter of a century has got to be doing many, many things right.

[03:02:33.320 --> 03:02:36.880]
