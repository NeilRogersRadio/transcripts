[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420]
Her girl told police he had sexually abused her for nine years beginning when she was six.

[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.980]
According to a police report, the girl said,

[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.120]
Edwan Jean Jean

[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.920]
abused her hundreds of times, sometimes at his office before and after school.

[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.860]
He abused her in the office.

[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.420]
The abuse ended in 2001 after the girl's mother confronted him.

[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.720]
Jean Jean, GEAN, J, 48 Reson Saturday, his pastor of Emmanuel Lutheran Church,

[00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.960]
was arrested the next day.

[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.580]
He was being held on,

[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.380]
bail on 50 counts of capital sexual battery, 50 counts of sexual battery,

[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.160]
and 100 counts of performing a lute act on a child under 16.

[00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.080]
Police said their investigation began after a church official called the

[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.020]
state abuse outline.

[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.040]
Lutheran Church officials have been investigating allegations about Jean,

[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.580]
on and off for months at the Reverend Gerard C. Michael Jr.

[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.640]
President of the Florida Georgia District of the Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod.

[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.380]
And it goes on and on.

[00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.160]
The usual crap, you know, is an awful lot of this crap going on, man.

[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.480]
An awful lot of this crap going on, and we had about a month or two of her

[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.840]
buddy whipped up about the travel listing priest, and now we move on to something else.

[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.980]
Let's move on to Sammy Socent, his cork bat.

[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.520]
What do you say?

[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.180]
Come on, let's do the whole show on that.

[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.100]
Nobody cares which of these do you care about most?

[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.040]
We're asking the audience.

[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.480]
We got 199 votes.

[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.960]
In fact, I'll refraub it.

[00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.900]
So one more, we get 200.

[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.400]
What do you think?

[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.240]
Go ahead.

[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.480]
You think one more, we get 200?

[00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.560]
I just refreshed it.

[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.600]
Let's see if we got 200 yet.

[00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.600]
Probably not with my luck.

[00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.360]
I'd take it one thing.

[00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.320]
We're getting a lot of action on this website, you can tell.

[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.080]
Tommy, let's solve it.

[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.800]
I want to see that picture.

[00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.700]
202 votes like I told you, George.

[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.840]
Where are those weapons of mass destruction?

[00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.120]
God damn it, we want to know.

[00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.780]
You find them yet?

[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.980]
Okay, keep looking.

[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.460]
94.

[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.640]
When is Moe getting canned?

[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.980]
50.

[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.740]
A lot of people are very concerned about that, including him, I'm sure.

[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.020]
Is George gay 20?

[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.420]
We'll be telling you between one and two this afternoon.

[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.380]
Will there really be Middle East peace 18?

[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.800]
Is that for RL's real voice 10?

[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.560]
I heard that one guy, the punk called him this morning.

[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.920]
Do you hear that?

[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.900]
Yeah, I did.

[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.740]
He's getting a little bit impatient with those stupid ass crimes.

[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400]
Three time I've heard you.

[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.040]
It's always my voice, and I'm sick of answering that question.

[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.200]
It's just, it gets so gay after a while for Christ's sake.

[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.960]
Exactly.

[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.600]
Anyway, but 10 people are concerned, is that really his voice?

[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.200]
Martha Stewart gets indicted.

[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.660]
8 people care most about that.

[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.080]
And so far we still have one who cares most about Sammy Sosa uses a corked bat, and it's

[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.860]
on the front page of the frickin' newspaper.

[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.860]
It's on all the goddamn news catch.

[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.320]
If you go and put two slices of bread in your pop-up toaster, when they pop up one of them,

[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.040]
I have a picture of Sammy with a bat on it.

[00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:38.140]
You think so?

[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.560]
I know so.

[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.460]
Here, indeed.

[00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.400]
I'm telling you, if you open a bottle of wine when the cork comes out, that's probably

[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.840]
part of the cork that was in Sammy's bat.

[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.920]
As the media once again tries to force feed the public, this is what you should be concerned

[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.780]
about, as the American media once again, although I did see it, and you even had a little

[00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.260]
piece there from CNN this morning.

[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.620]
Yeah, on the CBSC Evening News last night, they're finally under enormous pressure, start

[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.300]
ask some of these very same questions, like Papu Cana was asking them that article I just

[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.180]
read only moments ago.

[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.320]
Where is it?

[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.440]
Where's the beef, man?

[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.560]
Where's the beef?

[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.960]
Where's the meat?

[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.980]
And meanwhile, here's Wolfowitz running around, Sam just right on the open.

[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.280]
Well, last week he's talking about, well, we just came up with this, it was politically

[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.080]
convenient at the time to use that excuse to go in there, weapon-domestic destruction.

[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.740]
And now he's saying, oh, it's all about oil.

[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.220]
North Korea don't have any oil, that's why we're not in there.

[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.440]
But what was the expression he used?

[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.360]
It's a sea of oil.

[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.660]
Iraq swims on a sea of oil.

[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.000]
It's swimming on a sea of oil.

[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.000]
Why, I sure hope I kept that story.

[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.620]
Oh, I did.

[00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.640]
I know I did.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.440]
Well, it's on the site.

[00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.300]
Forget about this site, I'm never going to get on that website.

[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.860]
You're obviously going to picture a mole.

[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.700]
I can't get on there.

[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.280]
Oh, I do like this horse meat found in Salami in London.

[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.000]
Do you see that?

[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.420]
Uh-huh.

[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.180]
Well, there are about you animals anyway.

[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.940]
Let them eat their horse.

[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.140]
Note to self.

[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.100]
Yeah.

[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.640]
Watch out what you put in your mouth.

[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.900]
I can't find it.

[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.720]
I can't find that damn story.

[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.320]
And I know I saved it because I wanted to read it again.

[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.480]
The Wolfowitz story.

[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.940]
I got all this stuff here about frogs.

[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:10.900]
It's raining frogs.

[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.740]
It's raining men.

[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.100]
And I can't find a guy named Paul Wolfowitz thing.

[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.640]
I'll find it.

[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.120]
Maybe I threw it in the Schmidt can with some of that Todd Wreck copy.

[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.240]
That was good yesterday.

[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.780]
I like that.

[00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.780]
I threw it away.

[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.740]
Maybe if I took a purple pill right now, it could help, right?

[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.980]
Uh-huh.

[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.380]
I can't hurt.

[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.800]
Well, I can't hurt.

[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.460]
I think I've smitten candid.

[00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.200]
So I'll have to during the break.

[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.680]
I'll have to.

[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.800]
Oh, here it is.

[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:36.420]
I knew it.

[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.680]
See?

[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.600]
You have little faith.

[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.500]
I saw Gaslight.

[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.520]
Don't say what that movie talking in, please.

[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.000]
Wolfowitz, Iraq war is about oil.

[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.260]
I'm going to read it again in a couple of minutes.

[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.060]
Also speak in a Hillary, which I just played that bit.

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.520]
The publisher of Hillary Clinton's memoir wanted people guessing about her revelations

[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.260]
before publication.

[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.280]
But those plans were spoiled yesterday.

[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.520]
Some of the most colorful details were splashed around the U.S. media.

[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.260]
How do you like that?

[00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.940]
Simon and Schuster paid $8 million for Clinton's insight.

[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.100]
Look at $8,000 to Maltz's White House years and planned a media blitz next money for

[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.500]
its release.

[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.760]
But that sounds good for lunch today.

[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.700]
You know, blinces with blueberry.

[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.120]
Oh, that's how good it does.

[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.200]
It's better than bacon.

[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.580]
Bacon's getting, I mean, I like bacon, but it's getting ponderous, you know, like those

[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.940]
movie shows, Evan Ponderous.

[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.340]
Anyway, it says it gave no advanced media copy, Simon and Schuster, because they wanted

[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.640]
her like, you know, hold the thing back.

[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.900]
But late Tuesday, those plans went awry.

[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.980]
Or is that Don Auree who used to play for the Bruins?

[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.340]
I think he spelled it the same way.

[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.500]
Remember Don Auree?

[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.040]
No.

[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.060]
Good looking guy.

[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.660]
Uh, Tuesday, those plans went awry when the AP ran a story that quoted living history

[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.020]
extensively, winning play across the country, all across the country.

[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.740]
Hillary's agony, she reveals, bills be trialled in your post-front page, radio yesterday,

[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.640]
referring to the former president's affair with intern Monica Lewinsky.

[00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.960]
The AP's story, quote, celery is saying in the book that the former president lied to

[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.980]
about his affair for months, finally admitting his dalliance days before was to testify before

[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.560]
a grand jury after his nose grew an extra three inches long.

[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.360]
And it goes on about how wanted to ring his neck in Yadoyani.

[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.380]
And well, where's the, where's the beef in a story, huh?

[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.540]
Where they're going to get ready to sue?

[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:13.720]
They're getting ready to sue.

[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.380]
Here we go.

[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.020]
The leak of the book is sparked a potential legal battle.

[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.820]
Sources post of these situations that Simon and Schuster were, by the way, the one thing

[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.760]
in that movie, I mean, you know, the game show host, he was a character that you, you

[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.320]
felt bad for him, you know, because he was dying, right?

[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.560]
And it was obviously been on for far too many years, like Bob Barker.

[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.040]
But ladies and germs, yeah, like the little kid said, that's not even funny.

[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.560]
Anyway, sources close to the situation said Simon and Schuster were seeking damages

[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.440]
from the associated press and that time, which brought magazine excerpts rights, may pull

[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.160]
out of its deal.

[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.800]
AP spokesman, Jack Stoets said the agency hadn't broken the law and obtained the book through

[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.800]
a good old fashioned reporting.

[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.220]
A source of time magazine said we're still examining our options.

[00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.080]
In other words, time may back off because now there's no revelations anywhere.

[00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.260]
There's no big smoking thing, see?

[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.580]
Simon and Schuster declined comment on the potential loss that would not confirm contents

[00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.140]
of the story.

[00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.940]
The book will be published on Monday and there are no copies being made available before

[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.700]
then spokeswoman Victoria Myers said.

[00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.080]
Maybe this is all more part of a publicity thing, you know, because when they paid $8

[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.880]
million for it, you know, damn well, they got to sell a Zidium copies.

[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.280]
And they will, they will.

[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.760]
I'll buy it.

[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.260]
Peter Boy is going to buy one on credit.

[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.040]
Here's Miami.

[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:28.360]
Hello.

[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.160]
Neil.

[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.920]
Yes, sir.

[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.480]
You know that guardian article with the swimming on the Sea of Oil?

[00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.720]
I have it right here, yes.

[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.340]
They took it down off their website.

[00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:37.680]
Why is that?

[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.280]
Because you know, they're subject to lawsuit over in England.

[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.880]
They don't have like a first amendment for care.

[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.760]
I know that, right?

[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.080]
Yeah.

[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.800]
And so they took that down.

[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.980]
They were a little bit worried that whether the source of that quote was 100% correct.

[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.640]
So I bookmarked that so I could print that and send that to you.

[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.500]
And I clicked on my bookmark this morning and it says that they removed the page.

[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.160]
Well, it's very fortuitous.

[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.320]
It must have been my second powers against, very lucky that I kept it because I have it

[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.700]
in my hand right now in the story too.

[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.980]
Well, for the people who are looking for the original, there's a website called

[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.660]
information clearinghouse.org and they've got an archive version of it.

[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.380]
That's a great website, Neil, for these websites.

[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.100]
Have a don't we have that on our website from yesterday, Boehner?

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.700]
Yeah, but we don't repeat the whole story.

[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.940]
We have the link on there, but if the page down, I'll find an information clearinghouse

[00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.620]
and I'll relink it.

[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:22.820]
Yeah.

[00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.680]
Well, I see what you're saying.

[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.600]
So we only have a link to the guardian story.

[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.800]
So if they took it down, it won't be there.

[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.100]
You're right.

[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.960]
Well, just so you might want to keep this website in mind, information clearinghouse, archives,

[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.340]
a lot of these articles from CNN that get redacted and removed.

[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:37.060]
Right.

[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.140]
Go back to look for them.

[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:46.260]
Like the CNN transcripts of Hans Blix and Al Baraday's testimony had some 850 words,

[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.480]
X-sized out of them.

[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.920]
You didn't know that, don't you?

[00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:54.600]
You were reading some of those stories about how CNN edited their transcripts several months

[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:54.880]
ago.

[00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.580]
Well, information clearinghouse is a great place to find.

[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:59.100]
Yeah, I checked that often.

[00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.840]
Yeah, okay.

[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.140]
Well, I just wanted to let you know that.

[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:01.940]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.300]
Appreciate it.

[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.740]
Take care.

[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:03.640]
And good news.

[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.540]
See, I still have it here.

[00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.220]
I got my copy.

[00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:06.700]
And this may be worth something, somebody.

[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:07.140]
You think so?

[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.380]
No.

[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.340]
I got I'm going to frame it.

[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:11.720]
Well, what are you laughing about?

[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.900]
Oh, it's my mic on.

[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.360]
I have no doubts.

[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.500]
I have no doubts that the story is the true.

[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.620]
And of course, the right way.

[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.540]
You want to believe that because he's been shooting off his mouth the last couple of weeks,

[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.460]
not very brazenly.

[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.360]
The neocons become very brazen.

[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:26.720]
I mean, no, they stole the election.

[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:27.520]
It brought daylight.

[00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.860]
It brought daylight right there in front of your post.

[00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.720]
We want in.

[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.500]
Let us in.

[00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.320]
You know that whole routine.

[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.900]
Oh, and speaking of that, I never got to it yesterday.

[00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.900]
And it was on a website.

[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.540]
And I know this one is still on it because it was on the Sunscent.

[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.520]
Well, they're too stupid to change anything on their website.

[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.760]
Too slow and too stupid.

[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.400]
About the 2004 elections.

[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.220]
Remember that story?

[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:45.980]
Vote a boy.

[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.440]
Huh?

[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.060]
Yeah.

[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:50.340]
About the respecting problems.

[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.400]
They're expecting problems.

[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.540]
What a surprise.

[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.380]
What a novelty.

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.580]
Here it is.

[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:00.320]
Election supervisors won a vote problems in 2004.

[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.620]
Sarasota Florida's election supervisors are warning that next year's elections could

[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:08.340]
be played with problems just like in 2000 and last year.

[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.700]
If they're forced into a tight schedule with new touchscreen voting machines.

[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:12.280]
Wow.

[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.200]
Holding elections in September, October, November is much more difficult with touchscreen voting

[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.220]
machines than with the punch cards that were used before.

[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:23.600]
Sarasota County supervisor, elections Kathy Dets said this week is the supervisors gathered

[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.880]
for their summer conference.

[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.640]
Dets said her employees would have to program 1500 touchscreen machines individually for

[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.620]
each election and will need more time to produce absentee ballots.

[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.520]
These same tasks will be even more difficult in the state's largest counties.

[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.680]
They'd and.

[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.560]
One holding three elections.

[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.820]
The primary the primary runoff in the general election in such a tight time frame lead

[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.460]
to another election.

[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:50.740]
Fiasco said, Ion Sancho, the Leon County's election supervisor in his front is a close

[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.000]
associate Pancho Gonzalez.

[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.060]
What was the Cisco kid?

[00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.260]
What was his sidekick Pancho?

[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.760]
I guess.

[00:10:58.420 --> 00:10:59.460]
Come on.

[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.540]
Sancho Pansa.

[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:00.920]
It was.

[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.340]
It was it was Ion Sancho, wouldn't it?

[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.560]
The supervisors said they hope state legislators will consider the issue in two weeks when they

[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.260]
hold a special session to deal with medical malpractice insurance rates.

[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:14.300]
The House and Senate couldn't agree on election changes during the regular session.

[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.920]
And it goes on and on.

[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.940]
This was in the sunset on yesterday as a matter of fact and it's very disturbing and depressing

[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:24.720]
and very expected expected way to do.

[00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:56.300]
I'm going on down.

[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:56.540]
I'm going on down.

[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.140]
I'm stuck in the middle.

[00:11:58.820 --> 00:11:59.520]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:00.780]
I'm going to get out.

[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.600]
I'm a fair thing.

[00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.340]
Days are over.

[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.000]
I'm fine.

[00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:04.540]
I'll spend the thing that I've found.

[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.200]
I'm the one who made the free.

[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.480]
I think I'm not gonna break down.

[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:12.340]
Someone's busy trying to stop my group from crying.

[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.220]
No, I ain't just fine.

[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.480]
I'm saying that's what she is really looking for.

[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.340]
Is it a one of the heavens something?

[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.120]
Don't want to be left with nothing.

[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.260]
Is it a one of the heavens something?

[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.300]
It's a one of the heavens something.

[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.300]

[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.340]

[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.340]

[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:24.700]
It's a one of the heavens something.

[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.560]
I'm going on down.

[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.580]
I'm stuck in the middle.

[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.900]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:32.620]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:33.140]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:33.360]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.360]

[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.780]
I'm a lawyer.

[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.300]
Three to four to staff.

[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.400]
No, Miguel will be standing out in the corner of 441 and I was there a road taking collections

[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.140]
for Michael Jackson.

[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.640]
In fact, they'll be out there in a speedo and you can just stick your donations in

[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.620]
it with the tights.

[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.620]
Can you see that?

[00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:49.340]
No.

[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:50.900]
Why not?

[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.380]
I guarantee you raise a lot of cash.

[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:55.440]
What's the name of the Wilton manners?

[00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:56.000]
What do you say?

[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.560]
Raise thousands, millions maybe.

[00:12:58.980 --> 00:12:59.880]
I have that picture.

[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:01.620]
I have that picture of Mo.

[00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:05.620]
I'm telling you right now that is momentous speaking of that.

[00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:06.320]
Yes?

[00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.220]
You're a new and improved email.

[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.000]
I just sent you something.

[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:10.800]
Okay.

[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:12.420]
Well, let me see if it's who's going to work it out.

[00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:13.520]
I have to do an attachment.

[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:14.120]
Huh?

[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.860]
Big test.

[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:15.760]
Okay.

[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:17.520]
I just clicked it.

[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.400]
It says, did you Yahoo?

[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.600]
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.340]
All right.

[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.720]
Ha ha ha ha.

[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.420]
I like that.

[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:26.040]
The bookend.

[00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:27.620]
We could reverse that and put it on the other side.

[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.500]
Ha ha ha ha ha.

[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.200]
Oh.

[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.620]
We got the same body and the same lampshade but now it's got my push.

[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:35.560]
Yeah, good.

[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.580]
Instead of moes, it's kind of like interchangeable.

[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.160]
They could have at least given you different panties.

[00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.640]
We could have a whole line up of these in there.

[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:45.040]
In fact, that's a slimest mypupik has looked in a long time.

[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:45.940]
It doesn't matter if fact.

[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.740]
I'm saving that.

[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.080]
I'm not deleting that baby.

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.920]
56670560.

[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.720]
I'm 560 on the 18th.

[00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:56.860]
See, we oughta stick that on there too.

[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.140]
Okay.

[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.680]
Then Moe won't be able to pick it on me.

[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:01.020]
See, I'm laughing at it because I think it's hysterical.

[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.260]
Now, he might be.

[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.780]
He might have all the way down it.

[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.440]
You know, he's still a hard ass.

[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.740]
At least they looked his teeth in.

[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:10.060]
We can do something on that.

[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.600]
Go buy me.

[00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:13.740]
I can gum with the rest of them.

[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.060]
287 votes out of full.

[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:17.300]
Which of these do you care about most?

[00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.120]
Where are the weapons of mass destruction?

[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.680]
135.

[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:21.620]
When is Moe getting canned?

[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.280]
64.

[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:23.780]
Is George K.

[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.420]
30?

[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.380]
Will there really be Middle East peace?

[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.060]
27.

[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.960]
Is that for Rels' real voice?

[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.560]
13.

[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.460]
Martha Stewart gets indicted.

[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:31.840]
10.

[00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.820]
And Sandy Sosa uses a cork bat as making some real progress.

[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:35.460]
Only six.

[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:36.940]
Only six bozos out there.

[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:37.960]
Really ever crap about that.

[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.240]
So I would not need a media must be losing at least a little bit

[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:42.540]
in full.

[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.840]
At least over this audience because I've tried to teach them ways.

[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.560]
Way back starting with Ilyon.

[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.060]
The media will just bombard you with a bunch of crap.

[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.060]
Just like the Stacey and Scott Peterson crap.

[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.220]
Or Lacey, whatever her name was.

[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:54.440]

[00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:54.900]
Stacey Lacey.

[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.580]
That was double worshippers, you know.

[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.160]
Yeah, right.

[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.380]
That's when I thought all the time.

[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.140]
In fact, that movie, Your Ravenous or whatever.

[00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.220]
What's the name of that movie?

[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:04.220]
Ravenous.

[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.720]
Yeah, like I said, Grivenous.

[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.800]
That's what that's all about.

[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.600]
It's a bunch of savage cannibal.

[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:12.580]
They made a chicken on top of the door.

[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.620]
He did it.

[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.960]
Yeah, how much are you having?

[00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.560]
You had a whole bunch of cash in a passport and diamonds here.

[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.380]
But he was just going off for a little, a little side-grid on his way to much.

[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.700]
Just like OJ who had his passport and 10 grand in cash in the Ford Bronco.

[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:26.820]
But he didn't do it.

[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.680]
Did you do it, OJ?

[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.480]
Did you do it, OJ?

[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.960]
It was a chlorinated pool that made his hair so blonde.

[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.220]
Is that what it was?

[00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:34.100]
Yeah, a twitty said.

[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:34.860]
Uh-huh.

[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.320]
Thomas.

[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.140]
Here's a call from Pembroke Park.

[00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:38.460]
Hello.

[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:40.020]
Hey, Mr. Rodgers, how are you today?

[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.140]
Pretty good, Mr. Collar.

[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:41.420]
How are you?

[00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:41.940]
Good, good.

[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:43.340]
Two questions.

[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:49.640]
One, with all that, not finding these maps, reference maps to draw, to draw something and everything.

[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.340]
Does it make you think that there may have been more to the September 11th thing that the government knew about?

[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.260]
Oh, well, I'm positive there's more than 9.11 than we are there like none.

[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:02.960]
And we still aren't getting any more information about what it was either you'll notice.

[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.460]
Yeah, like that report that they're holding up or whatever.

[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.240]
Right.

[00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.880]
The 800 page report.

[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.260]
Yeah.

[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:08.300]
Yeah.

[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:12.120]
And on a second note, I'd ask you up a thing about a rocking chair.

[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.440]
Is that something you're interested in?

[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.520]
About a rocking chair?

[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:16.960]
Right.

[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.180]
Why do I sound that old?

[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:26.460]
No, no, no, no, I'd send you a, uh, a fact or I, I'd thank something over to, to QAM, uh, to relate to you.

[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.060]
About a rocking chair?

[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.560]
Right.

[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:32.600]
Saying what?

[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.320]
I mean, between you and George, I mean, keep me in suspense.

[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.140]
What was it about?

[00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:40.120]
Well, I, I'm the one that made you that chair or that that that.

[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.080]
Oh, oh, well, listen, have a great day and thanks again for that.

[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:43.660]
That was very nice.

[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.600]
Why didn't you alert me?

[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.200]
I was trying.

[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.100]
No, listen, listen, you see, I don't want to say I was in such a good mood until that.

[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:53.620]
This guy made me a very nice thing.

[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.660]
Now, he's, you know, and he called me a couple of times.

[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:57.900]
They made me a nicer thing for my house.

[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.060]
Very beautifully finished in the whole deal.

[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.320]
What would you call it?

[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.140]
Like a cabinet.

[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:04.400]
A chest.

[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.400]
A chest.

[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:09.340]
In fact, you can look on it the website and you'll be able to see my big fat chest.

[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.780]
Now, seriously, I am with it with the, you open it up from the top and it's got all kinds of stuff inside.

[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.760]
It's a beautiful thing.

[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.400]
And I thanked him for numerous times.

[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.800]
And he's called on the year several times, increasingly over the years.

[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.180]
To, uh, remind me that he's the guy who made that nice thing.

[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:23.980]
You see what I'm saying?

[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.020]
And finally, it reaches the point, sir, where I really, I don't want you to take this the wrong way.

[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.140]
But I wish you wouldn't have made me the thing in the first place.

[00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:35.160]
Because now, now he wants me to do something else to help him raise, to do what?

[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.760]
There's something to me to sponsor him for a seminar that teaches you.

[00:17:38.760 --> 00:18:08.740]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:16.880]
No, song written upon the

[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:16.900]
during

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:16.900]

[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:28.580]
do anything nice for you, and then

[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:38.380]
no, I get all this

[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:38.720]
love and

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:38.720]

[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.420]
My favorite. Can you get me off?

[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:48.620]
That's my favorite. I just go on, Boehner boy. Why don't I mean nobody's perfect?

[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:54.460]
Okay, he's working with crappy equipment. So again, the answer is no. Why did you just leave me hanging there? That was bad.

[00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.480]
I would be going. Wasn't that bad? I just part the way he left me hanging there. Should have seen. I was squirming. We were looking at each other.

[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:06.100]
Like we both need to look at it. I don't want to because he's a nice guy. I'll be. He's a nice guy, but he's putting me in a bad position.

[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:11.740]
I don't like being in a bad like Moe in that picture there. He's in a bad position both of you. He's in a vulnerable position.

[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.140]
Reckon exactly. I noticed his his is a little higher in the year than mine.

[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:27.660]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 I just you just ruined my day with that guy. He just told me. Yeah, you you both of you. You put him on. You killed me with that guy.

[00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:34.420]
I don't know when we said that. If you would have just jumped right in you would have said this is the guy that made you that thing and he, you know, then I wouldn't.

[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:42.060]
How was I supposed to know what he's talking about a rocking chair? In addition to what you never sent me that facts because you told me about it. I said forget about it.

[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:50.860]
Never sent me the facts. Did you talk about it? I got it. And what did I say? No. Right. That's exactly what I said. No. Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[00:19:51.320 --> 00:20:03.100]
Good morning. Neil. Are you? Yes, sir. I just recuperating from a little bit of surgery here. So it's given me the opportunity to dispense with the irrelevant things in life.

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:09.700]
Such as work and concentrate on the important things such as your show. Right. Now you're talking now you get your party straightened out.

[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:20.660]
Well, speaking of priorities, I wanted to also discuss something that I could never discuss anywhere on your quote unquote sports station, except for this location. Specifically hockey.

[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.120]
Right. By the way, or he was a W R U I. Yeah, I know. Anyway.

[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:36.220]
Wouldn't it be nice in a way to see I know I'm just pull through this entire. Yes, it would, especially in light of the fact that the devil's make me sick and my stomach.

[00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:43.780]
And like I said, the other day, John Madden number 11 for the devil's right real pussy who didn't want to come here for the NHL awards in Toronto because he's afraid of SARS.

[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:50.400]
Anybody's that much of a pussy. Don't deserve to win anything. Oh, really? He doesn't deserve is he doesn't deserve to have his name on a Stanley cup.

[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:59.220]
Well, I'd also like to see Stumpy kind of. Yeah, Stumpy Thomas. You do understand the least could have had Stumpy Thomas back for a song for the third go round would leave.

[00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:07.020]
But they now we don't want him. Let's bring back Doug Gilmore. Let him play about five minutes. I think just about anybody could have had him this year after the Hawks let him go.

[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:15.620]
But you know, I'd like to see him kind of analogous to this year's Ray Bork. In other words, all those years of trying and toiling and finally.

[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:23.520]
I see a lot of difference. So because I mean, Ray Bork went to a real contending team to specifically for the purpose of winning a Stanley Cup, which he did.

[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:31.800]
Right. Well, as opposed to Stumpy Thomas, who was just trying to catch on somewhere after it was to turn loose. And who the hell would have believed other than Kaplan?

[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.460]
I guess that the Anna, I'm at a chance to win a Stanley Cup. So we just out of the blue nice going stumpy.

[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:42.160]
Well, all the more reason, all the more reason I'd like to see him get it because it was considered an afterthought.

[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.920]
I'm sure when he was sent to Anna, I'm as opposed to a contender. Right. So that would be wonderful.

[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:56.240]
I'm squeezing hard for the next tonight. I think what yep me too. And I think one of the things that's most satisfying as you mentioned, the Devils play that.

[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:03.720]
Stulking style and they're getting it thrown back in their face now. Right. Because they're meeting a team that's equally patient.

[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:11.140]
To their own style of place. Right. I'll be keeping my fingers crossed and whatever else it takes.

[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:17.720]
OK, my friend. I'm pulling for you. I'll be checking in with you from time to time. OK, thanks. Take care.

[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.900]
Run 40 to 18 till noon at 560. You're rocking to your station QAM.

[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.320]
As rocks. See is the ball.

[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.420]
All I'm going to say.

[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:43.280]
I'm follow a great. The different one that they shall be stand up. Come and go on to the TV show called a cave.

[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:51.480]
I am the president of the Honduras Miller Brighton tobacco company serving the universe with stuggies and who she since 1998.

[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:57.900]
I thought it might be a good time to come on here and let you know some of the do's and don'ts of our company.

[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:07.280]
I mean, the cigar and the pretty much speech for itself. You know, your federal rules and regulations applied not a bride side of the business is a little more sticky man.

[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:12.480]
Apparently one of our customers had some troubleshooting issues with a purchase he made a few years ago.

[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:20.340]
Although the 90 day money back guarantee period at long past, we would have worked with him on a trade in had he not decided to chop her up.

[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.100]
I thought, hey, this might be a good time to go over some of the rules of the mail order.

[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.920]
Brighting all number one and this had always been an unwritten rule.

[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:31.400]
But obviously now we have to write it down. Don't chop a mop man.

[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:34.880]
If something goes wrong with your wife by mail, contact the factory.

[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.960]
One of our train service technicians will attempt to remedy the problem.

[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:45.220]
If we fail to correct the problem, you know, IE she screams that you'll not stop in Spanish or she's angles your neighbor or each of a life hot pocket.

[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.180]
We'll take her back man. You just be shipping and handling.

[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:54.680]
Rule number two. Well, actually there's no other rules man. You can pretty much do what you want. Just eat, stay on the chopping.

[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.140]
I don't like to get into rules man, but I guess that's how I get into trouble in the first place, eh?

[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.200]
You know, any loser that has to pay for a white shoe to mail is kind of a skinny person anyway.

[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:09.320]
But love Anthony and Dorian Brighton tobacco company. Where our girls are all smoking. Come and shop. But don't shop.

[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:14.780]
We'll chamblin rate me. Okay good. 1147 you keep a crawl around on the floor like that and somebody's gonna get you.

[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:18.540]
See, if you look at the two pictures, the one you got of me there. Yeah.

[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.700]
And then one was hit. You'll notice that his pasty complexion matches the rest of that body much better than mine. Right.

[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:28.380]
They should have blended better. Yeah. Well, we'll work on it. Anyway, we got the correction.

[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.520]
Thank you profusely. The guy called the three or four calls back about the guardian and the correction.

[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.340]
Because here it is. I got it off today's newspaper off the website correction Paul Wolfowitz.

[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:43.120]
A report was posted on our website on June 4th under the heading Wolfowitz Iraq war was about oil.

[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.920]
Misconstrued remarks made by the US deputy defense secretary Paul Wolfowitz making it appear that he had said that oil was the main reason for going to war in Iraq.

[00:24:51.220 --> 00:25:01.040]
He did not say that. He said the most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically we just had no choice in Iraq that the country swims on a sea of oil.

[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:26.620]
So you can interpret that however you want. You know how I interpreted don't you know how I'm a hard ass.

[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.020]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 8.

[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:36.340]
TNT and Verizon line the O Rogers dot com where you can see that nifty picture of Mo waiting for his next attacker.

[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:48.620]
Which of these do you care about most we've got a bunch of nifty choices for 360 votes already where are the weapons of mass destruction 166 of you people want to know where the F are they?

[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:58.260]
When is Mo getting can 82 inquiry minds want to know about Mo will there really be Middle East pace 39 is George gay 37.

[00:25:58.260 --> 00:26:14.740]
Is that for all's real voice 16 Martha Stewart gets indicted 11 I guess it was kind of anticlimactic we knew it was coming we knew that was coming bitch and Sammy Sosa uses a cork bat only seven only seven of you really care most about that heavy heavy duty.

[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.220]
Kind like a number of people at last night's Marlon's a's game about seven.

[00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:34.360]
All but it was 10,000. You're right. Here's Miami online seven hello any idea sir it's pretty funny but it might be sad at the same time you let's put the cabins of the radio to a lot of people.

[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:46.360]
If you really think about it yeah it's pretty funny because I could see people with the song in their head and listening to you and that's doing the things they're doing you know taking the triple pills and all that.

[00:26:46.360 --> 00:27:06.500]
Yeah well listen to I would say most of our corners are popping lot of pills. Yeah you get all chronic me no people are for sure. It's up the tab in the radio it's great and another thing I wanted to add another topic to your poll there is the piece on top of most had civic cat or another species what is it.

[00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:16.600]
Okay thanks so much you want another topic to our poll five six seven got a lot of open lines here all of a sudden you want to know why don't you because we don't have a list of movies and movie stuff right or nothing to add to.

[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:28.220]
Right no no see in this like this guy he's adding to our poll we're not we're not taking any more suggestions for today's poll I think we covered a fine wide gamut can we say that gamut no damn it.

[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:43.120]
Of topics there for you to peruse and choose and lose and maybe like for all booze a little bit see one thing I like about him is he doesn't be us anybody he's he's a booze hound who talks about it on a lot heroin chewing gum.

[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:56.080]
And probably a lot of diet cocturing to show of course I drink a lot of diet cocturing to show to diet focus for people in recovery I'm thinking cheese blinks is a sac cano don't do it why you're too young it's better

[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:05.440]
to eat nice green yeah well I'm going to tell you what I did yesterday you get really you'd be real psychotic to oh Jesus you'd be foaming at the mouth.

[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:17.620]
See you know what I do this is a bad thing no no listen to me and I think about it all the time but I never change my pattern of behavior I'll think about the show is over I've eaten

[00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:47.600]
virtue other than a little bacon before the show which is good for my blood sugar I discovered but other than that I eat nothing and then I'm thinking about going to lunch in fact right now it's just coming up on noon and my body is thinking about lunch so I'll go and get lunch and then I'm the way to lunch I'll think well you know maybe instead of going and actually having a meal I'll just get some crap and eat that because even after I have lunch I'm going to eat crap anyway see what I'm saying yeah but I go to have lunch anyway thinking no well this will fill me up and then I won't eat crap and I go and I have a nice lunch I'll do an act in his lunch like I did yesterday is to do it.

[00:28:47.600 --> 00:29:01.280]
I had some nice soup I had a Canadian cheddar burger with no of the need to bun the need to fries even though I told her Caesar salad that bitch but she brought me a whole bunch of fries didn't touch one good and I should have been full well don't say good that's the beginning of the story.

[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:31.060]
I'm about 20 minutes later because I have like a routine I go and get the newspapers I get the sun and the star and I like to go with my lunch it's great I enjoy it life is sweet until after lunch because then I go to my convenience store to you know stock up on my caffeine free diet soda right and while I'm in there they have that freezer case you can't get to the soda without walking by the ice cream case you can't get poor in fact there are three ice cream cases and you have to waltz between them

[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:37.580]
I should probably put blinders on right that's not actually and I'm even mentioning yesterday about the briars score ice cream

[00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:55.440]
and the fact that it only comes in half gallons actually it's worse than that because it only comes in two liter which a leader is a little more than a court right so I have so I have a gas well we would consider a half a gallon of two liter is more than a half a gallon right right right that's all it comes in it doesn't come in pints it doesn't come in court it's like an elephant

[00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:25.240]
so I buy it briars score ice cream I can't tell you how good it is and the bad and the bad part of it is is that it's available I'm sure nearby you it's not like that Nestle's turtle like I told you it sits around and so what I do is I put it in the microwave for about 58 seconds melt it up nice get my spoon and then of course you start eating around the edges of the container on the inside of the the edges

[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:46.960]
because that's where it melts first when you pop it in the microwave oh yeah I know that huh same routine I have to stick it in the microwave to how about the ice cream yeah and that's where the good stuff is around the edges there on the inside I know you have a I know all the outside you score seven so I ate and I'm thinking to myself what I'm going to do is I'm going to eat about maybe a third of it

[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:56.240]
and then I'll rush into the kitchen and put it under how water and Schmidt can it because once you put water on it you're not going to eat unless you're an idiot I a little more than a third

[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:11.780]
no I didn't eat all of it I could have though I could have seen I'm one of the few I'm talking about for well being honest enough to talk about how he's into booze and pills and crap I'm into sugar man and I could have eaten a whole two leader two leader container

[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:24.840]
not much of it is a lot of people who are you couldn't nobody could do that surprise watching so I would say that there I was down like about a pint and a half before I finally just reign of the kitchen just because I realized that I was going to eat the whole thing

[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:36.540]
I mean while you're eating it it's not like it's not that filling you know there's certain kinds of food like if you have a steak if you go to Ruth Christian you have a big steak a big steak is really filling you know right

[00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:43.920]
and you have a bunch of side with it you know like all the good stuff like the broccoli with cheese all that good stuff and you have a bowl of soup before the meal or the

[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:51.360]
Friday the barbecue trim so you've eaten a big meal when you've eaten like that but ice cream isn't filling

[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:58.020]
you're sitting there just happier than a pig and slap I'm watching my TV whatever now I'm watching I'm just a happy camper

[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:06.180]
you're following this yeah it's depressing well I'm just telling you I don't have to tell you I don't know

[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:18.380]
what do you mean it's depressing so the plan trying to make you is why even bother with the lunch you see what I'm saying yeah just to take a vitamin and a bowl of ice cream

[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:27.200]
that sounds excellent oh that's the new knee arrachers diet a vitamin bill and a bowl of ice cream

[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.620]
sure at least you're getting all your essential you know vitamins and minerals and you're you know your coq 10 or whatever

[00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:37.620]
take an olio mat oh man and wash it down with a pint of bryars yeah

[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.900]

repayment for the bench i made

[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.160]
you the bench i made for you

[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.320]
was a gift without any

[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.380]
conditions attached

[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:40.380]
i've used sponsored in the

[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.920]
plans for my wood working

[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.140]
studies by giving them the

[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.180]
project i made in the course

[00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:45.780]
again my intentions were not

[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.720]
meant to imply i was asking

[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:48.160]
for this in return for the

[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:48.620]
bench

[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.040]
signed

[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:51.860]
what

[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.080]
that was carless and sensitive

[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:55.420]
prick

[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.720]
not being sensitive

[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.920]
what who wrote this

[00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:01.780]
i think he just made the whole thing up

[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.500]
that was probably him doing a voice

[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.460]
i got a great little pull within a show

[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.420]
remember that guy you're doing a show

[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:12.100]
within a show that that old fart i

[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.100]
loved that kind of panic probably dead now

[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.020]
we can only hope

[00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:17.620]
we're doing a show within a show

[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.340]
yeah what does that mean

[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:19.700]
i don't know but you're doing a show

[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.740]
within it's aggravating

[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.880]

[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:23.880]

[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:28.760]
nil yes i am how you doing great okay i want to talk to you about uh

[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:31.380]
well first of all i was actually shocked that

[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.700]
turned on the uh your station you actually got a

[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.060]
hockey pole uh i mean we're uh uh

[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:42.360]
just about to uh crown a Stanley Cup

[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:45.060]
champion and you have a hockey authority done here no one's

[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.320]
calling you about hockey well what what do you mean by that

[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:49.740]
nobody calls me about hockey ever anyway even if the

[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.560]
panthers are playing so why should that be there's no

[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:53.500]
interest don't you understand and unlike the other

[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:55.820]
people on the station who i don't try to push

[00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:57.760]
something that nobody cares about in other words nobody cares

[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.620]
about the marlins so i'm not going to say they're

[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:02.480]
talking about baseball all day and the same thing with hockey

[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.220]
there's all there's very little interest in

[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.200]
soft food i've discovered a hard way over these

[00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:08.000]
last ten eleven years since we had a franchise

[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.800]
yeah and you know the interesting thing about it is

[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.740]
i was in addition in addition to which this series is so

[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.960]
coma-inducing that whatever interest there wasn't a first place you

[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.580]
to subtract about 80 percent but but i think even you might

[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:25.440]
admit that the the last game you know it's nothing

[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.040]
nothing too great goalie is going in the third

[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:31.380]
you know that's not my kind of game now not my kind of game

[00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.300]
well i you know i don't want to the one i want to

[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.980]
soccer scoreless games i'm not into that right i think most people

[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.960]
don't want to see a game they want to see action they want to see five to four

[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.080]
six to five they want to see a lot of great goals they want to see i mean

[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:46.300]
you know if there are a lot of shots and there's great

[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:49.080]
gold tending to an average right right yeah oh like

[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.560]
like a the first two games in jersey anaheim at

[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.020]
all that we shot in each game yeah i mean they

[00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:58.320]
they're lucky to be even be in this series exactly i mean but

[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:01.160]
but i i still say that greasy gold brodure left

[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.800]
in there when he lost his stick to sandwich

[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.580]
osalins i think that was the turning point i want to talk to you about

[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.080]
saying it's always going to get him to second but um the but i mean if we get

[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.500]
as boring as it might be if we get a seventh game that goes to overtime and it's

[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.880]
one one or nothing nothing that's pretty exciting it is the next goal is

[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.560]
going to win the cup going pretty exciting for head capon because his whole

[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:25.940]
allow it is all few no seriously one last time we had a seventh game

[00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:30.880]
go to overtime because the buffalo um yeah buffalo and balls

[00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.720]
close to toward i think was game six that wasn't game seven ever what about

[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.800]
what about buffalo and Dallas and that greasy gold by

[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.620]
bread hull right i think that that was game six oh

[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.540]
that was whatever it's been a long time but uh you know you but you're right

[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.820]
but you know something you're trying you try to

[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.180]
dress it up and the fact of the matter is you can't uh

[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.160]
you know you can't put any lipstick on this pig it's just that it's gross

[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.100]
it's just bad hockey because when hockey i came down here i really thought

[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:56.040]
people go to the games and really just

[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.120]
but call not just panther fans but hockey fans

[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.360]
they're not they're not they're not by far they don't they sport but they're not

[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.660]
they don't care no they don't okay i was watching the NBA finals live

[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:11.600]
you can't compare that to hockey that it's just it's nothing it's freakball it's about

[00:44:11.600 --> 00:44:16.360]
just seven foot tall free slam agenda into the basket isn't there no uh there's no skill in that

[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:23.180]
exactly now sand this osalinch uh uh uh been following him since the Minnesota series he

[00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:28.300]
is an offensive threat he got the game winner against Dallas yeah he's been he got of course he

[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:31.480]
got the fortune to go which which may go down in history is the most famous uh

[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:37.360]
big goal but he does not even make an effort to get back on defense

[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.100]
they're in the Minnesota series you're one game i think they had four breakaways and uh

[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.500]
like or or four i'll tell you one thing i'll take him over fill housely on leafs will

[00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:50.200]
ever wear open leaf uniform again okay there's plenty of other old stiffs around so all

[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:55.080]
osalinch is uh pretty uh i mean he comes in he doesn't even pretend to get and then when he goes

[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.880]
back i mean you know it's not his bag you know it's just not his bag yeah not playing defense okay

[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.460]
well listen the audience is uh notting off but the go ducks go yeah the other thing just wanted to let

[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:10.880]
you know uh i uh Georgia proud be interested in this uh there was a movie called uh wake up George

[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:21.200]

give me to do like a three-minute free spot for some Jackass account of his that had nothing to do

[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:07.960]

[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:59.980]
distressed about what it was no distressing oh I see the movie was distressing yes because of

[00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:06.120]
what happened to everybody and tell me what do you think happened to Sarah in the end see I told

[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:25.440]
way for any of you after the in the movie oh that was bad that was bad that was bad near the

[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:30.780]
thing of it it did you see how in different the psychiatrist life to her well and that's just how

[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:35.600]
about how about the diet doctor he never even looked at her exactly he he looked at the chart and

[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:39.080]
she's talking he never even looked at her and they just kept scribbling out the prescriptions for

[00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:46.300]
these damn pills it was sick it was sick but it was very true there it was real life meal yeah okay now

[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:54.340]
here's the other thing meal um do you think the shrub our president the cut stole the election do you

[00:56:54.340 --> 00:57:00.500]
think that that moron can bring peace to the Middle East by yeah but I wouldn't want to

[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:04.880]
single him out for that for first of all keep in mind when his crew of nazis first came into office

[00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:08.640]
they said oh well we're not going to make the mistake Clinton got me made work not going to get

[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.780]
involved in the Middle East we're going to like put that way down on the burner you know on the

[00:57:11.780 --> 00:57:16.560]
back burner and then of course after 9.11 all of a sudden he's the big peacemaker uh you know when

[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.680]
I watch him and the awkward uh you know I remember watching Jimmy Carter with big and in this

[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:27.960]
a dot and you saw Clinton in there with the yes or air I'm a fart and uh robin and now you watch

[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:32.540]
this and you say oh this is uh I don't know I mean I hope so because I'm sick and tired of the whole

[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:37.740]
thing you know me too but but this has shit for brains okay and have a great day

[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:45.200]
that I hit it did you we all did okay I'm running into the other way he was going so well I mean

[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.280]
he's right she said the president's got Schmidt for brains okay in fact in as far as I'm concerned

[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:53.200]
where I'm sitting I think I'll be in improvement uh now see just when we're talking about the

[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.940]
rocking chair guy and now you send me this facts about people using me and using this show well

[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:04.800]
I'm working on a theme yeah now I'm making me a mid-years resolution since it is June right in the

[00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:08.620]
middle of the year I'm making a mid-years resolution I'm I'm tired of being used you know when you

[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:12.820]
get to be an old fart like me uh there just isn't that much to use anymore I thought it was so

[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:19.600]
appropriate when that facts came across oh brother I mean cut the crap already where did Dave

[00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:25.480]
Slater cut the crap this is a guy doesn't want to get the message he ran once before and he

[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.820]
wouldn't even put his name on the paper they didn't acknowledge his existence and he sends me

[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:34.520]
this fact like I'm gonna like put him over the top stop using me okay I was delighted to help out

[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.640]
against that penny sales tax a couple of years ago I was really ecstatic they were able to help

[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:43.060]
accomplish something that was the one time and like Howard Beal said I don't think well like

[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.560]
the way remember he was talking about sending the telegrams to the White House to stop the Saudi deal

[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:52.500]
he said but I don't think it's ever gonna happen again and that's exactly how I feel uh the idea

[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:56.200]
that this show is gonna make a difference or somebody on a radio is gonna change the world

[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:00.060]
forget about it okay I'd much rather have people going out watching these great movies getting

[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:03.340]
a little entertainment we've been talking about as opposed to thinking I'm gonna sit here in a

yes I forgot I put it on my head and you know who I'm talking about yeah yeah and then he started

[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.300]
calling the show I mean we appreciate all the nice sign it was greater what he did but he was the

[01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.620]
worst car in the history of the human race he made the guy with the eyes sound like Alfred Hitchcock

[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:44.260]
I mean like Walter Cranker who was bad and he was also in person even worse than he was on the phone

[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:47.520]
he's like I'm not saying he's a bad guy because he was a nice guy he did a lot of nice stuff for us

[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.380]
but it's just I don't know I don't know how to describe it it's this kind of a cling on thing

[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:57.980]
that happens in life you know what I mean touch the flush to where the flesh I don't want to

[01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:01.860]
with the fly I don't want him touching my flesh believe me there are plenty of people I'd like

[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:07.100]
touch in my flesh he and want him hey Aaron what's going on sweetheart how the hanging I'm not

[01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:11.760]
looking to that picture anymore I got a show to do here we got the mad dog at two Hank Goldberg

[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:17.140]
from New York where the bell mods coming up Saturday how many horses are in that race later we got

[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:22.500]
about fear for a horse and no seriously like fearful left whoops they keep scratching horses out

[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.780]
which is great I want to see funny side when the triple crown I want to see him just kick ass

[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:32.040]
Marlins on deck at 630 because we have a contract and we're required to carry those games

[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.940]
705 the A's in a Marlins again in front of their usual six or seven thousand people

[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.640]
any K who's reading how come we don't have the hockey game on or that's right we're contracted

[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.260]
for the Marlins any K follows the baseball game you can be danger he's going to be glued to the

[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:49.740]
screen for the adults and the devil's game five from Jersey and Joe and Mark overnight two to five

[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:55.400]
in the morning see stop and think about this with Mo with his new schedule of his the fact

[01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:59.780]
done wait he has to get a three o'clock in the morning or thereabouts what are the chances that

[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.280]
anytime in the near future he's going to be watching like an NBA playoff game at night

[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.680]
or a baseball game at night or any sporting event that's on in the evening oh see what I'm saying

[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:16.320]
right the chances are none I mean he might watch a little bit of it but generally speaking the big

[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.980]
oh nothing maybe he'll take a nap and then maybe he'll get maybe you get the message

[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:26.400]
haven't had any more reasons why we hate Mo called it it's you know this is the audience it's

[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:31.420]
it's so depressing to me it's the one thing if we could just if we just have a transplant on the

[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:37.800]
callers but that that's a story that goes back a long long time and they could have changed five six

[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.940]
seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a 18 T and four eyes on Marvellous line don't forget

[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:49.720]

[01:03:54.880 --> 01:04:04.320]
sometime what are you laughing about well no we don't do that on this show I to me that the

[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:08.400]
purpose of this show number one I'm way above anything else entertainment that's what we're

[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:11.800]
getting paid to do we're not going to change the world we're not going to save the world we're

[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.100]
not going to change the human nature are you gonna make self-floor to paradise this is an

[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.860]
entertainment program and as somebody who's done this for about five hundred years to me there

[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:28.600]
is nothing worse and I mean nothing that a guy who sits behind a microphone and talks to the same

[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:36.160]
ponderous people day after day it's boring it is boring and in all fairness to Moe I'll say this

[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:42.200]
that his predecessors in the morning they did the same thing they did exactly the same thing the

[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:49.700]
worst team Joe and Gildi and and yeah Chamiacola are a DFO they did the same thing in fact they were

[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:55.580]
the guys who invented Richie from Boer's head and Mark the Jets fan well what's the point what's

[01:04:55.580 --> 01:05:03.020]
he used it's the lazy way out the lazy and it's very terminal believe you me but I'm excited now

[01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:06.660]
that we got a new show we got two new shows we got for well on a radio and we have the Moe Gildi

[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.000]
and Dennis show now every morning so Dennis can tell you about how he has nothing against homosexuals

[01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.840]
but they can't see slip in the same place like how about in the dormitories yeah maybe we

[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:21.300]
got to have a heterosexual dormitory and a homosexual dormitory make sure that homo guys aren't

[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:27.620]
sleeping with heterogies and the dikes with the head row ladies right with the ladies as long as

[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.460]
you're in in camp and keep in mind these are the calls on a sports show where you got all these guys

[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:38.300]
taking showers together I just mentioned that in passing five six seven oh five sixty pound five

[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:46.220]
sixty on a AT&T line here's for Lauderdale huh yes Neil yes sir first time caller all right listen

[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:52.260]
I want to make comment on Sosa's little problem with that court it looked at me it was just like

[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:59.080]
an athlete coming out of IR trying to gain a little support and little bat speed and that's all I see

[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:04.100]
in it I don't think it was his home run what do you mean what do you mean by that's a if you're

[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:10.660]
saying that he didn't intentionally yeah I mean you can make an excuse for that no there is no excuse

[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:16.220]
I mean it's like Bobby Valentine said he got caught you know but I think you're ready to say

[01:06:16.220 --> 01:06:20.940]
when you're sure what you're suggesting is ludicrous because if that's the case what if he breaks

[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:26.980]
that bat which is it turns out he did and he's got 76 other bats that aren't court so well

[01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:33.820]
what was the benefit you think it was an accident that that time we didn't know that court was there

[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:41.340]
I mean he has to sure let me say it again he's got 76 other bats none of them were court how is

[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:48.560]
that possible no it's not well so there you go he's he's he looked at me like an athlete uh

[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:53.460]
uh struggling let me ask you this sir seriously since nobody else cares about it who really

[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:59.540]
gives a crap when you come right down to it who cares I'd write you do why do you care I love

[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:07.420]
baseball oh okay well call call us Portio I don't know I'm just in it no use for it it's a waste of

[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:11.820]
time they've destroyed it they butchered it once upon a time was a lot of fun I was big into it it's

[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:17.140]
it's over the party's over he loves baseball so therefore he's concerned he's one of those 10 people

[01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:24.100]
is most concerned about the sandy sources bat out of uh 551 1.8% join the other less than 2%

[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:29.480]
of the human racer who cares most about sandy sozin is court bad to be the fucking game exactly

[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:35.560]
most people care about where those weapons have matched destruction 241 they care about like the

[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:39.400]
future of the god damn human race in the world and now we're gonna keep spinning it around and

[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:42.880]
we're gonna let a bunch of nazi steal the election again next year that's what most people care

[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:50.180]
about when is mogan can now we're talking about something heavy duty 126 is George gay 68 maybe a

[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.380]
lot of guys out there are concerned maybe they'd like a date will there ever really be middle east p 62

[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:59.740]

[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:11.820]
gets indicted 16 people are most concerned about that not too many and only 10 care most about

[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:17.460]
sarah sandy using the court path oh the and the I mean you can send the the idea that people want

[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.800]
to sit and conjecture about that back and forth and on and on that even it makes my teeth ache it

[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:28.180]
makes me weak makes me weak at the knees burn them at the stake a court stake of course so let me ask

[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:34.400]
you think the Yankees are win the pennant next year not this year next year same kind of crap man

[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.520]
same I think I'm you know I'm gonna do what speaking of being a crusader I'm gonna change

[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.960]
something I'm gonna make sports talk illegal you know the FCC just did this thing they keep making

[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.680]
all these changes and broadcast regulations right I think what we need to do is make sports talk illegal

[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:56.040]
yeah I think it's detrimental to the mental health of America I and I don't think it is I know it is

[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:04.360]

[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:47.880]
you

[01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:22.100]
Hope the Chandra, hope the Chandra, hope the Chandra, hope the Chandra, hope the Chandra,

[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.400]
yeah, and a blight of a boy.

[01:11:24.820 --> 01:11:26.040]
Our Chandra is doing, by the way.

[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:28.460]
1247 at 560 WQAM.

[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:32.620]
So I just look on our website and the Bina boys put all kinds of new stuff on there

[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.780]
and not even telling me about it. It's something really sensational.

[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:41.120]
We replaced the Troy Stratford living hair piece, the one I kept hopping up and down,

[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:44.460]
with something even better and more exciting and that is dancing W.

[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.920]
Have you seen that?

[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:48.340]

[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.460]
Oh, that is sensational.

[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.280]
Man, he has tapped, answered up a storm.

[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.700]
Sammy Davis would be proud.

[01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.400]
And then a quote underneath W.

[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.120]
It says, Mark Twain, it's better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you were full,

[01:12:02.420 --> 01:12:03.980]
then to open it and remove all doubt.

[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:07.600]
And Mark Twain, as usual, was absolutely correct.

[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.320]
That's a beautiful thing right above the whole list of bushisms that we have there.

[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:11.740]
Second.

[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:17.060]
And above the new cartoons and above those grotesque pictures of the Butchered Children in Iraq.

[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.400]
And then of course our bedtime stories.

[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:21.360]
567-0560.

[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.120]
Plenty of open lines because I'm sure we don't want to talk to the same half-thousand people every day

[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.160]
because it's ponderous.

[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:29.200]
And if it means we've got to go back to begging for calls again, that's okay.

[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.000]
I don't care. I've got many, many years of practice doing that.

[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.280]
But what? The guy from Dallas calls me the second day in a row.

[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.120]
Are you ready for that? Like he's moving?

[01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.760]
That's a guy that was going to go to Amsterdam, remember? Right?

[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.400]
Have a good time, pal.

[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.500]
Here's Volker. Hello.

[01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:46.560]
What up, Doc? Hey, Neil. How you doing?

[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:47.200]
All right.

[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:49.160]
Hey, long time no talk to you.

[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.060]
Listen, I just wanted to talk to you about this.

[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.040]
First of all, let me get this out of the way.

[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.360]
Let me get this out of my chest.

[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.900]
Who gives the damn about Sammy Soesay before the cork and if he's hitting the damn,

[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.120]
but I'm not a melon. I don't care.

[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.460]
I hope he should stick a cork in his ass if he asks me.

[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.960]
I mean, who cares, man?

[01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:08.240]
Nobody.

[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.240]
Give me a break.

[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.920]
Anyways, I always hear you talking on the show about losing weight and all that stuff.

[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.960]
One thing you're gonna talk about when somebody hacking, how can I gain weight, Neil?

[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:22.140]
I'm trying to gain a damn pound and I'm spending a month eating and eating it.

[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.700]
I can't gain a damn thing, Neil.

[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:24.460]
I'm keeping it.

[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:24.780]
What can I do?

[01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:25.980]
Keep chewing on it.

[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:28.900]
I have no time for people like that. Just like vulnerable.

[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.060]
You know, eat some chocolate, man. It'll do it.

[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:32.760]
Eat a bunch of chocolate and bacon.

[01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.020]
Make you a hell of a brunch.

[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.700]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.060]
That was one of them, by the way.

[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.280]
We got, in case you didn't know, 580 votes.

[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.540]
Which of these do you care about most?

[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.040]
And Sammy Soesay uses the cork bats only got 10.

[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:54.760]
1.7%.

[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.280]
Nobody cares.

[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:57.420]
The media cares.

[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.840]
They're hyperventilating.

[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.740]
See, somebody forgot to tell him that baseball is no longer America's a past, the national pastime.

[01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:06.160]
It's kind of like life has passed them by.

[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:08.760]
Nobody cares.

[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:10.120]
I mean, they're a small handful of people.

[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.160]
It's like neurotic repetition.

[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:13.240]
You know, they just keep going and just keep watching.

[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:14.740]
Although most of them don't go to the games.

[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.100]
They just watch it if it's free on TV.

[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.560]
Or they just call in talk shows like sports talk shows.

[01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.320]
And talk about it because that's for free.

[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:23.100]
Because, you know, opinions are like assholes.

[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:23.960]
Everybody's got one.

[01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:26.280]
Oh, I think Sammy knew all about it.

[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.740]
I think he probably hit the other 500 bats with a cork.

[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:29.980]
Who gives a flying crap?

[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:35.900]
Like I said before, you got a little league game now with all these Phantom teams.

[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:37.520]
And they're keeping the same statistics.

[01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:42.280]
Every statistic after expansion started in every sport should have a big asterisk.

[01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:45.760]
You know, like they put the asterisk after Roger Maris broke Bay Brutes record.

[01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.880]
Because it wasn't 154 games.

[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:48.720]
It was 162.

[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.280]
So they put the asterisk next to it.

[01:14:51.140 --> 01:14:55.520]
But what they should do now is every record since expansion should have a big asterisk in a record book.

[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:58.020]
As if anybody cares because it's all Phantom crap.

[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.580]
It's all it's all little league.

[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:03.820]
You got guys that hit like 175 to Major League baseball players 220.

[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:04.860]
Forget about it.

[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.020]
Here's Miami.

[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:08.360]
Hello.

[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:09.940]
Hey, video.

[01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:10.720]
Yes, sir.

[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.860]
How are you today, sir?

[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:12.540]
I'm great.

[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.720]
I just thinking about what we're talking about getting up at three o'clock in the morning.

[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.580]
I've been doing that for about 10 years.

[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.200]
And I think it's really the best shift.

[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.560]
It's because a lot of advantages.

[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:22.380]
Yeah.

[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:25.040]
I'm not if you're 68 years old.

[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.360]
It's not well.

[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.560]
I'm 62.

[01:15:28.060 --> 01:15:28.620]
Not too bad.

[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:29.660]
I'll be dead.

[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.840]
You know, the traffic you beat the traffic.

[01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:34.560]
You get off my way home now.

[01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:35.880]
You take a little nap in the afternoon.

[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.100]
I don't go to bed before 10, 10, 30 a night.

[01:15:38.860 --> 01:15:39.720]
Get up at three.

[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:40.440]
Not bad.

[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:41.300]
Wow.

[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.180]
So in other words, you sleep split split shift.

[01:15:45.260 --> 01:15:48.420]
Actually, I think all you know, you need about four or five hours sleep anyway.

[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:49.400]
No way.

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.220]
Are you kidding me?

[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.200]
I'm serious.

[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.620]
Four or five hours sleep.

[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.360]
I think so.

[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:57.340]
You must be one of a rare breed, man.

[01:15:57.420 --> 01:15:58.600]
I don't know anybody can handle four.

[01:15:58.700 --> 01:15:59.860]
But not especially that age.

[01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:00.520]
I don't know.

[01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.420]
On the weekends, if I sleep eight or nine hours, then I feel like hell.

[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.180]
Really?

[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:04.900]
Yeah.

[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.640]
Okay, I'll give it a try.

[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.960]
And I'll stay out till about three in the morning.

[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:07.180]
Okay.

[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.620]
Thanks, pal.

[01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.160]
By the way, bad news.

[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.860]
Canadian dollars up to 74.60 cents.

[01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:17.380]
My, the American dollar is dropping at the point like water through a sieve like frogs from the sky.

[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.020]
And the euro is one 18 and a half.

[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:25.780]
Oh, that American dollar can't complain about its value anymore because generally speaking, don't have any.

[01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:31.560]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 pound, 5, 60 on the 18 and T in Verizon wireless line.

[01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:37.880]
I just get that nervous feeling in a pit of my stomach that the audience is on the verge of running out of material about everything on the verge.

[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:38.820]
On the verge.

[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:41.720]
No, I mean, like really, you know, the ultimate.

[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:45.800]
They've been, they've been hovering for quite a while for years now.

[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.820]
But I think they're right on the edge of going over that precipice.

[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.440]
I think if they hold off to like about the 4th of July, it would be a real good.

[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:54.440]
You know, that would be excellent.

[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:58.780]
I thought I'd want to leave you holding the bag, but of course, what would be wrong with leaving you holding the bag?

[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.540]
Here's a call from Coral Springs.

[01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:01.880]
Hello.

[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:03.680]
Yeah, I mean, how are you doing today?

[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:04.340]
Okay, sir.

[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:11.420]
Well, the reason I'm calling this, my name here on the news yesterday was the guy in California who was authorized to grow pot for the state.

[01:17:11.820 --> 01:17:14.380]
Oh, you know something I looked for that story on the Internet.

[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.420]
I'm glad you mentioned that that the judge gave him one day in jail and let him out.

[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:18.500]
Good.

[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.360]
Well, still should never happen to begin with.

[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.700]
Exactly. This is the guy that the jury was prevented from hearing.

[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:31.640]
We had the story on months ago that the guy was growing pot for medical use legally under the law passed in California.

[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.960]
It wasn't breaking any law.

[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:35.520]
And they came in there and they raided the joint.

[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:36.280]
They arrested this guy.

[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.200]
They could have gotten 60 years in jail because of the damn DEA, the federal of the feds.

[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.160]
And the judge said this is ridiculous.

[01:17:43.440 --> 01:17:46.420]
And he gave him the one day in jail already served in the turn and loose.

[01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:48.020]
True.

[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.380]
Does everybody around the world complain about our government locking on them?

[01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:53.440]
They do the same thing here.

[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:57.040]
It's just, you know, people don't open their eyes to just one more.

[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:58.480]
Exactly. Okay, thanks for reminding me.

[01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.100]
I forgot all about.

[01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.600]
Thank you.

[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.300]
Because we had talked about that story when it happened in the incredible outrage.

[01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:07.560]
Medical marijuana is legal under the Florida law and the feds.

[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:09.240]
The NARCs come in there.

[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:14.320]
You're growing them marijuana and you're going to end up trying to put them away for 60 years.

[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.120]
Traject pathetic.

[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.000]
Does anybody care?

[01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:19.260]
No.

[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:21.900]
No, the media has all whipped up about Sammy Soeson is cork bad.

[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:24.000]
I think they had a stuff of cork in it, don't you?

[01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:26.200]
That's what I think.

[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:32.300]
Much of fascist, crazy, maniacal, manipulative bastards.

[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:39.360]
I guess if they keep most people tied up trying to stay out of jail and everything and trying to keep from all this other crap,

[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.000]
then they don't have time to like worry about ask questions about where's the weapons of mass destruction.

[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:47.100]
And let's see that vote count again from 2000 and all these other things, you know.

[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:51.440]
And how come all the veterans are losing their benefits and how come the poor people and the kids with little,

[01:18:51.620 --> 01:18:54.160]
the families with little children can't get any tax relief?

[01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:03.300]
Those are the questions that people want to know, but in the meantime we're worried about some guy that's going pot legally from medical purposes out there in California.

[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:09.840]
Let's go through a whole big, so-and-a-dance and waste a lot of taxpayer money to try to put that guy's ass away because he's dangerous.

[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.480]
He's a threat.

[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.800]
Here's a call from Poppano. Hello.

[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:21.820]
Hi Neil. I have two different things. One, I have something for your list on reasons we hate Mo.

[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:25.520]
Oh good. That went over like a pregnant pool of water.

[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:30.020]
He thinks he's really hot being the voice of the dolphins, but we all know he's really a jet fan.

[01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:32.860]
Okay, he's a jet fan. It's number six, okay.

[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.900]
And the other thing I was going to tell you when you were saying you didn't feel satisfied when you were eating the ice cream,

[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:43.560]
when you kept eating hard carbs don't stay in your stomach and send a signal to your brain to tell you you're full,

[01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:46.780]
but proteins do. That's why the steak makes you feel full.

[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:51.460]
There you go. That's why you KD-2-1 Pringles and you might have eaten the whole damn container full.

[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.700]
Right, because carbs pass straight through to your intestine. They don't stay in the stomach.

[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.740]
I think we find carbohydrates ought to be outlawed.

[01:19:58.900 --> 01:19:59.800]
I agree.

[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:01.260]
Starting after I croak.

[01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:07.060]
But the protein state is I just in your stomach, which tells your brain you're satisfied and full,

[01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:08.580]
so you're better off eating the proteins.

[01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:09.440]
Okay.

[01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.680]
All right, I just want to give you a big shout.

[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.780]
Sounds real easy to me.

[01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:17.220]
Thanks.

[01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:17.880]
Bye.

[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:18.820]
Bye-bye.

[01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:20.000]
He's a cake.

[01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:20.980]
Oh, I shouldn't say that.

[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:23.280]
When you're in town next.

[01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:24.840]
It's as easy as pie.

[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:25.900]
Oh, see?

[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.660]
I'm going to bring my camcorder in.

[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:28.960]
For what?

[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:35.780]
And I'm going to tape you like preparing and then eating a bowl of ice cream and then edit it into one of those montages,

[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:37.340]
like you see in Requiem for a dream.

[01:20:37.940 --> 01:20:39.920]
The prepping of the no ice cream one on there.

[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:40.500]
Oh, good.

[01:20:40.900 --> 01:20:41.640]
I don't think.

[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:42.960]
Then we can put it on the website.

[01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:44.960]
Why?

[01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:48.020]
Because you want to embarrass and humiliate and degrade me on my own website?

[01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:48.380]
Yeah.

[01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:48.760]
Yeah.

[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.780]
Let's continue embarrassing and humiliating and degrading Mo on our website.

[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:52.220]
Not me.

[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.420]
What's wrong with that?

[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.300]
It's too easy.

[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.320]
Yeah, you're right.

[01:20:57.440 --> 01:20:58.160]
I don't take much.

[01:20:58.240 --> 01:20:58.480]
You're right.

[01:20:59.060 --> 01:21:00.440]
Like I said, piece of cake.

[01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:01.900]
This is better.

[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:02.060]
Cake.

[01:21:02.340 --> 01:21:02.760]
That's sex.

[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:03.580]
Cake.

[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.680]
Find a way, Mo.

[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:06.660]
We're going to take another picture.

[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:07.760]
Take off those checkered papers.

[01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.720]
Yeah, people are talking again.

[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.360]
The ones that are like lime green and the...

[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:19.060]
The doctor that performed the surgery on Jake Viedler's thumb didn't need the same doctor that performed the procedure on your two pay.

[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.160]
I would have played the whole thing though.

[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:23.940]
It's so cruel.

[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.820]
And especially where guilty is like shmerkling in the background.

[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.480]
That's better.

[01:21:28.540 --> 01:21:29.240]
Just like that.

[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:33.920]
1257 at 560 WQM just minutes away from our gigantic one to two hours.

[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.140]
Oh!

[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:34.800]
World famous.

[01:21:35.620 --> 01:21:37.700]
Well, I tell you, 10 to 2 sure is how beats 9 to 1.

[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:39.160]
Why do they do that to us for all those months?

[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:39.960]
You bastards.

[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.540]
You lunatics, Greg.

[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.880]
Whoever else was responsible for that insinant madness.

[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:52.480]
Let me tell you right now, easy piece of shopping to do that doesn't require you to leave your house just reach over and lift the thing off the receiver.

[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:55.300]
Lift up your phone and call our good buddies at the Alamacris.

[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.240]
They're ranked number one in the world of customer satisfaction.

[01:21:57.500 --> 01:22:01.340]
And when you buy a mattress from these folks and you finish with a whole deal, you understand why.

[01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.600]
Just one easy call to 1-800 mattress.

[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:10.740]
And you won't believe how easy it is to pick out the perfect bed for you depending on your back and how you like to sleep, like upside down, vertical, horizontal, whatever.

[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:15.480]
The expert bedding consultants will guide you through the whole process because they really know bedding inside and out.

[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:20.260]
Unlike when you go to a showroom and talk to some shmerkle who stares you toward the house brand because they told them to do it.

[01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:23.220]
Or maybe a discontinued setter, some mismatch or some crap like that.

[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.420]
Alamacris doesn't have time for crap.

[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:28.140]
They carry only the best the top quality mattresses in the world.

[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:33.580]
They got CLE, SIRTA Simmons, Tempor PEDIC, no sales gimmicks, no false promises, no phony ads.

[01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:40.120]
They've got the high-end beds too, like CLE's crown jewel line and the top models from every brand growing all at low prices every day.

[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:45.120]
And when you talk to the people at Alamacris at 1-800 mattress, ask about their exchange policy.

[01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.620]
If you're not completely satisfied, then exchange it free and no questions as plus.

[01:22:50.020 --> 01:22:53.280]
Alamacris gives you a free set up, pre-removally, and you get to choose the date and time for delivery.

[01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:56.140]
That fits your schedule any to our window that's convenient for you.

[01:22:56.740 --> 01:22:57.880]
Nobody else does that.

[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:09.340]
Alamacris, the easy and smart way to get you a great night's sleep for months and years to come with one simple call to 1-800-MACRIS-1-800-MAT-T-R-E-S, or visit them on the web, macchris.com.

[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:15.360]
We're sports radio 516, QAAM.

[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.020]
Not just the 1-2 hour, it's a phenomenon!

[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:24.060]
You love Shakira's top 10 hits underneath your clothes.

[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:29.040]
I'm a mid-door claw, that's an endless story.

[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:32.140]
Listen, that's wrong.

[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:36.280]
And now you'll love her new album. Shakira's in other people's heads.

[01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:45.660]
She already made music history by recording her first English language album.

[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.680]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level.

[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:53.680]
By re-recording songs that were already hits in English, only this time they're in English again.

[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.500]
I'm so glad to have you here.

[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.960]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:09.080]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:12.120]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:20.900]
If you really, really like Shakira's CD, laundry service, then you'll really, really, really like her new CD.

[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.340]
Shakira sings other people's hits.

[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.520]
No den aimers in it, but you'll win in those moments.

[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.820]
Muchis Grasius, 103 hits are gigantic 1-2 hour boy.

[01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.260]
It's so much better being back on Tinditoo, you know what?

[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.360]
And also following something that's got a real show.

[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:35.340]
I hope your car gets stolen.

[01:24:35.440 --> 01:24:36.040]
Okay, thanks.

[01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:38.600]
Anyway, here's the story.

[01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.060]
I just printed it out from the LA Times.

[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.000]
The guru of Ganges gets a day in jail.

[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:43.480]
We're getting to that.

[01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:47.240]
Now the fact you just sent me, see, it wasn't bad enough that the...

[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:50.780]
And the guy was a good guy, but he wanted to talk about hockey for half an hour and chase away the whole audience.

[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:53.540]
You notice how the fall... the fall is called.

[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:53.720]
Yeah.

[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:55.660]
And the calls fall right after that.

[01:24:56.800 --> 01:25:01.480]
I mean, you just... you cannot go on a radio and talk about things that you are interested in,

[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:03.960]
that nobody else cares about and expect to have anybody listening.

[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:08.240]
Learned that a long time ago, but not soon enough.

[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:13.220]
Because here's this thing from the Cleveland Plain dealer, a harness racing story.

[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.000]
The Northfield Park's Battle of Lake Erie, Saturday said,

[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.880]
you should come down for this. I have a seat for you in my box.

[01:25:20.980 --> 01:25:21.760]
You're number one fan of Cleveland.

[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:24.480]
Well, thank you very much, Pally, but no, I don't go to Cleveland.

[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.740]
And especially if I want to see races, I can go to Woodbine, I can go to Mohawk, I can go to Hell, like whatever.

[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:33.580]
You know, I go to Batavia, I can go to Hamburg, to Buffalo Raceway.

[01:25:33.700 --> 01:25:34.360]
Oh, don't say Hamburg.

[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.360]
You get those crazy people crazy again.

[01:25:38.620 --> 01:25:39.100]
They'll get them nuts.

[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.420]
But don't let me forget about the horse meat in Salami.

[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:42.360]
Okay, hey.

[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.060]
But anyway, now, well, before that, this is more important.

[01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.240]
And I'm glad that that color reminded me of this.

[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.960]
I mean, all this other crap is cockarrived that they're worried about that bitch Martha Stewart and Sammy Stink and Sosa.

[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.880]
This is about freedom, man.

[01:25:57.020 --> 01:25:59.160]
This is about the kind of country you people live in.

[01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:01.840]
And it seems to me that most people look, you have a flying fig.

[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:02.860]
That's the sad part.

[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.980]
The guru of Gondje gets a day in jail, a judge-freez activist who's become assembled

[01:26:07.980 --> 01:26:11.880]
in a clash with the federal government over California's medical merogelini laws.

[01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:17.520]
Ed Rosenthal has the look of a high school biology teacher in the resume of a stoner.

[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.200]
For years he's written passionately about marijuana for High Times magazine,

[01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:25.920]
authored books about pot and served as a high priest of the medical marijuana movement on Wednesday,

[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.920]
meaning yesterday, he had a new chapter.

[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:34.240]
The 59-year-old pot activist entered federal court in San Francisco, facing years behind bars

[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:40.180]
for cultivating more than 100 marijuana plants for a very medical pot dispensary he walked out of free man.

[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.000]
U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer, who makes a hell of an ice cream by the way,

[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.840]
first decided to plead from prosecutors for a six and a half year sentence declaring that Rosenthal should spend just one day in jail.

[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:56.860]
He then waived the sentence for time already served after Rosenthal's arrest last year by drug agents

[01:26:56.860 --> 01:27:00.240]
from the notorious the Uxius DEA.

[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:06.200]
Breyer cited the extraordinary circumstances of the case, including eight jurors who said after the trial

[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:11.020]
that they would have acquitted Rosenthal, had he been allowed to present evidence that his pot plants were intended for medical use.

[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:15.740]
They didn't let them tell the jury that his pot plants were for medical use.

[01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:21.860]
And you remember the stories back when this thing was going on, that the jurors were foaming at the mouth they were matter than a wet hen,

[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:29.900]
and that they would have reversed the conviction if they had known that the pot was intended for medical use since it was legal under state law at the time.

[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:35.720]
The judge's decision was met by wild cheering and applause in the courtroom.

[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:36.820]
Oh, oh, oh, right.

[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:39.700]
I take responsibility for my actions that bring me here today.

[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.480]
I took these actions because my conscience led me to help people who are suffering Rosenthal said these laws are doomed.

[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.720]
It brought an end to a topsy-turvy legal case that Thrust Rosenthal and the National Spotlight,

[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.980]
he became a symbol of the ongoing clash over California's medical marijuana laws,

[01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:00.240]
and the uncompromising prohibitions of the Federal Freaking God-Damn Fascist Government.

[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:05.400]
That's what it is. The Federal Freaking Fascist God-Damn Government. That's what it is.

[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.380]
What that will ever happen to states rights? What that will ever happen to individual freedoms, huh?

[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:17.760]
Oh, no, the DEA, man. Just say the drugs took that wicked and just like the thing that Canada's having with the US,

[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:21.060]
which they wanted to really decriminalize the marijuana laws here,

[01:28:21.060 --> 01:28:26.980]
and now they had to water it down and try to pacify it as fascist in Washington because let's face it.

[01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.840]
They're flexing their muscle now, man. Number one under block the USA.

[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.460]
You're going to do it our way. Our way or the highway, the Hershey Highway, as Duff would say.

[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:40.900]
Right. Right away. Thanks again, Duff called me during the break.

[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.600]
I said, be sure and thank Beenerboy for doing that prep work.

[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:47.560]
You said it saved me a lot of time and a lot of aggravation. No.

[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:51.720]
A lot of that high-colonic crap. Don't know what you're talking about.

[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.380]
Oh, yeah. How about you suck an ass?

[01:28:54.320 --> 01:29:00.960]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:05.460]
If you haven't seen the Mo picture on all fours on our website, please. It'll give you a chuckle, okay?

[01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:09.620]
Yeah, just one. It'll give you several chuckles.

[01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:10.920]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.520]
Hello.

[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.220]
Miami. Hello. Yes, sir.

[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.980]
I have a question for you.

[01:29:22.780 --> 01:29:25.480]
A president can only run for two years.

[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.840]
But for two years, two years, two terms.

[01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:34.540]
Yeah. After he served the two, if another president takes over, can he run again?

[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.600]
No. 5, 6, 7, 0, you know, this bubbled the other day.

[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:42.340]
I think it was talking about that about he thinks that law should be changed not for him, although I think that would be great.

[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:44.580]
But not for him, but just in general, I think he's right.

[01:29:44.980 --> 01:29:48.380]
Yeah. Although let's make sure we don't change it retroactive for W.

[01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:49.300]
Oh.

[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:55.300]
Can you even imagine? Look at all the open lines in that board, baby. Wow.

[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:59.360]
They're really impressed about the Ed Rosenthal thing in the medical mirror one.

[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:03.440]
All the other stuff we're talking about. No, they don't care about that. They want to know about Sammy Sosa's bad.

[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:10.380]
I'll guarantee you that on the sports shows yesterday, there were more zillions of phone calls.

[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.540]
They'll look at the whole hour here right now. Oh, yeah.

[01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:19.380]
Guaranteed about Sammy and the decorquit that he stick it that he suck it that he lick it that he eat it.

[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:24.980]
And we sit here like begging and pleading and like just prostating ourselves.

[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.460]
And I got prostrating. What's the word prostating?

[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:28.960]
It is not.

[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.440]
Here's Boker. Hello.

[01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:34.760]
Let's open a joint for you to the back.

[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.220]
Oh, God.

[01:30:37.660 --> 01:30:39.380]
Here's a call from Jacksonville. Hello.

[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:45.660]
My any hello.

[01:30:47.180 --> 01:30:49.640]
Okay, now we're doing it. Now we know it's the one to two hour.

[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.440]
Okay. Now we know it's back.

[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:55.740]
We don't have anybody on the line. It's got the IQ larger than their thumbnail.

[01:30:55.740 --> 01:31:00.400]
Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 6 the I'm going back to bedtime stories. I think I'll be God.

[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:01.660]
No, I'm serious.

[01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:07.460]
This this business is sitting down wondering are they are they going to be in the mood to call unless it's a list.

[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.180]
I told you this many months ago.

[01:31:09.640 --> 01:31:14.200]
This is what's happening. It's either got to be a list or one of those stupid sports things about Sammy's bad.

[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:14.740]
That's it.

[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.780]
And I'll say it again. If I'm on a year talking sports in South Florida, I'm talking Brian Greasy and J. Feedler.

[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.700]
Not about that Sammy had croaked his bed.

[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.640]
Last time I checked Sammy don't play for any South Florida team.

[01:31:25.660 --> 01:31:28.320]
Does he play for South Florida team? Who gives a crap? Okay.

[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.220]
Sammy's thinking so sir.

[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:34.960]
Oh, I love you. I love you. I love you. I'll let crap. You know, just like leave on Miami. I love you.

[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.700]
All that baloney. I don't love him anymore. So I have an idea.

[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.500]
Yeah, for a new list.

[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.080]
Yes. Wait.

[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:44.440]
And you notice how many responses we got on that too that one ice lady.

[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:48.060]
Moza Jets fan that was number six. The top five slots. We haven't even filled yet.

[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:51.320]
Yes. Which.

[01:31:53.380 --> 01:31:54.880]

If I didn't know I haven't decided yet. I'm still mulling it over. I think the answer will be oh

[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:49.100]
We're still for the hot couples contest

[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:51.860]
We got the Darren and what's your name?

[01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:52.640]
Darren and Holly

[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:53.680]
Yes

[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.380]
Two pictures for the price of one

[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:58.440]
You'll pick whichever one you want to stick on there

[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:01.640]
I know which one you want to stick

[01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:03.400]
But that's great

[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:05.200]
So we're starting to make a little bit of progress

[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.900]
You know it's going to take a while

[01:48:06.900 --> 01:48:08.160]
What's going to take about two, three years?

[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:11.160]
Right, to get back to the away we were, the attend to

[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.300]
Let's have the way we were, let's sing that

[01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:15.420]
Barbara Streisand, the way we were

[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:18.540]
His stand that cross-eyed bitch with her big nose

[01:48:18.540 --> 01:48:20.240]
With her crappy attitude

[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:25.560]
The only vision James Brolin is doing her now is because he's old and

[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:27.440]
He's skanky looking like you

[01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.620]
You think when he was younger he never would have touched her

[01:48:30.620 --> 01:48:33.080]
Yeah, James Brolin, he was a pretty good looking guy

[01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:34.440]
What was he in?

[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:35.720]
Movies

[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.680]
No but seriously, what TV show was he in James Brolin?

[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:39.940]
I forgot

[01:48:39.940 --> 01:48:41.920]
Come on, are you serious?

[01:48:42.220 --> 01:48:43.040]
I do a lot of drugs

[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:44.360]
Haha

[01:48:45.180 --> 01:48:46.360]
What time was that on?

[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.120]
Here's Miami, hello

[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:49.800]
Hello

[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.720]
Yes sir

[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:51.500]
How you doing Neil?

[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:51.840]
Great

[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:56.140]
Yeah, I just call him to say I don't think Jorge is gay there

[01:48:56.140 --> 01:48:58.740]
You know, I think he's just a bisexual

[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:00.900]
He likes to try it?

[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:02.300]
Yeah, he likes to try it all

[01:49:02.300 --> 01:49:03.620]
Try anything, you know

[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:03.620]

[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.040]
Oh and also remember Neil?

[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:08.600]
Remember this always remember

[01:49:08.600 --> 01:49:09.960]
We rate Mo

[01:49:11.780 --> 01:49:12.200]
Okay

[01:49:13.100 --> 01:49:13.820]
Mm-hmm

[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:15.880]
Well he was doing good after the first part there, you know

[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:19.400]
And then he tried to like go a little bit too far

[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:20.640]
He's got a big heart on

[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:21.580]
Maybe that's the problem

[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:23.760]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10

[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.700]
Here's the poll today which of these do you care about most?

[01:49:26.220 --> 01:49:29.020]
Got a lot of votes, somebody must be out there, 694 votes

[01:49:29.020 --> 01:49:31.100]
And this is the second poll keep in mind

[01:49:31.100 --> 01:49:31.880]
Remember the first one?

[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:32.120]
Uh-huh

[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.680]
That which of these broads do you like?

[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:34.000]
I mean

[01:49:34.700 --> 01:49:35.540]
Something like that

[01:49:36.420 --> 01:49:37.880]
Which of these do you care about the most?

[01:49:37.980 --> 01:49:38.700]
We'll go from the bottom

[01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:41.060]
Sammy Sosa uses a cork bat 13

[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:42.160]
1.8%

[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:44.760]
A very miniscule number of people care about that

[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:47.560]
Martha Stewart gets indicted only 20

[01:49:47.560 --> 01:49:49.940]
We know it was coming and screw the bitch anyway we hate her

[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:51.400]
Is that for Rosario voice?

[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.080]
33

[01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:53.860]
So now we're starting to get to the more important stuff

[01:49:54.620 --> 01:49:56.700]
Well there really be Middle East piece 81

[01:49:56.700 --> 01:49:58.400]
Is George Gay 90

[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.940]
When is Mo getting canned 151

[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:02.740]
Well I'll tell you something he really

[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.600]
He can hold his own, you know

[01:50:05.700 --> 01:50:08.000]
And where are the weapons of mass destruction?

[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:09.520]
304

[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.060]
44% of this audience wants to know

[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.280]
Where the F are those weapons of mass effing destruction

[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.060]
Where are they?

[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:16.580]
Anybody know?

[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:17.440]
No

[01:50:17.440 --> 01:50:18.680]
We're working on them

[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:20.880]
Here's Jupiter hello

[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.020]
Can only eel

[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:23.000]
Yeah

[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.440]
Hey I think we should send that North Carolina

[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.240]
cops that found Rudolph

[01:50:28.980 --> 01:50:30.160]
Over to the middies

[01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:31.720]
Help us find Saddam

[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:33.300]
Send him over to Iraq to look for some weapons

[01:50:33.300 --> 01:50:33.640]
Yeah

[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:35.040]
Well the weapons troops

[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:36.360]
Well maybe send him over to

[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:36.700]
Israel

[01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.620]
He can find Ariel and other Salami sandwich

[01:50:38.620 --> 01:50:41.100]
Or maybe Dick Cheney to find Dick Cheney

[01:50:41.100 --> 01:50:42.440]
Maybe he can find Dick yeah

[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:44.440]
And I think the fix is in

[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.300]
I think since ABC is broadcast in the cops

[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:49.320]
The season

[01:50:49.320 --> 01:50:49.980]
Yeah

[01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:50.520]
The final

[01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:52.200]
And the sound

[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:53.640]
It's kind of strange that

[01:50:54.860 --> 01:50:56.980]
That we've got the ducks in the final two aren't

[01:50:56.980 --> 01:50:58.100]
The owned by the same company

[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.880]
Well I don't want to drop any names

[01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:02.340]
Because there's nothing worse than the name dropper

[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.120]
But I was going to say

[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:03.860]
Oh I schner

[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:04.240]
Yeah

[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.460]
I think I saw some

[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:06.080]
We'll all know

[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:07.020]
I'll have a second by the way

[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.300]
They've been trying to unload the ducks

[01:51:08.300 --> 01:51:10.260]
For a couple of years now at ABC and Disney

[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.360]
And now all of a sudden

[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:12.640]
Is there's opening up a big mouth

[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:13.640]
They're going to win in six

[01:51:13.640 --> 01:51:14.360]
Oh I schner

[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:14.640]
Yeah

[01:51:14.640 --> 01:51:15.060]
Yeah

[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:16.160]
He's a very hot guy

[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:16.440]
Even

[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:17.460]
He's got a knee

[01:51:17.460 --> 01:51:18.360]
I think he's going to need seven

[01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:19.040]
I think I'll win it

[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:19.480]
But uh

[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:21.700]
I think it seems a little strange

[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:22.500]
That uh

[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:23.400]
The season

[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.320]
The ducks make the unbelievable run

[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:25.780]
The end

[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:28.100]
They happen to be owned by the same company

[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:29.060]
Here we go

[01:51:29.060 --> 01:51:30.000]
Well we'll check it out

[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:30.360]
We'll put

[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.600]
We'll put Chilock on the case

[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:32.020]
Thanks

[01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:33.000]
Thanks Pally

[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:33.460]
By the way

[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:34.840]
We ever get an answer from Fatboy

[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:35.900]
About that question we had

[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:36.200]
No

[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.260]
He's on it though

[01:51:37.260 --> 01:51:37.660]
The map

[01:51:37.660 --> 01:51:38.220]
He's on it

[01:51:38.220 --> 01:51:38.800]
Yeah he's on it

[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:39.180]
I bet he

[01:51:39.180 --> 01:51:40.640]
Oh yeah

[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.680]
You find a mattress

[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:43.020]
Fatboy is sprawled on it

[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:45.920]
Probably with a god damn sandwich in each hand

[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.080]
He makes my ice cream story

[01:51:47.080 --> 01:51:48.060]
Pailing to win significance

[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:48.400]
Hi!

[01:51:48.820 --> 01:51:50.620]
He could probably polish her off

[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:52.020]
Two half gallons in one sitting

[01:51:53.620 --> 01:51:54.400]
See I should

[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.620]
I should feel honored to be

[01:51:55.620 --> 01:51:58.420]
reminded by so many gigantic blobs of fat

[01:51:59.140 --> 01:52:00.980]
Because as many sugar problems

[01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.320]
As much of an addition as I've got

[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:04.620]
At least that only like 600 pounds

[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:05.000]
Okay

[01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:06.740]
At least I don't have to be taken out of the building

[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:07.300]
With a crane

[01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:09.500]
God

[01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:11.220]
So what's the story with him

[01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:12.420]
He's working out of the house

[01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:13.340]
Right

[01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.740]
Which means what

[01:52:15.320 --> 01:52:16.540]
It's his dream come true

[01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:17.540]
He gets to stay in bed

[01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:18.600]
With a phone on his lap

[01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:19.760]
And his little organizer

[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:20.400]
And the

[01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:22.700]
And have food brought to him

[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:23.540]
And the fat family

[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.360]
He's bringing him food

[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:25.580]
Like the guy that was on her out of

[01:52:25.580 --> 01:52:26.900]
Who they literally had to remove

[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:27.940]
With a crane

[01:52:27.940 --> 01:52:28.940]
Through the roof

[01:52:28.940 --> 01:52:29.760]
From his house

[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:30.900]
The 600 pound guy

[01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:33.400]
They're gonna put a webcam in there

[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:34.240]
So he can attend the

[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:35.780]
Conference meetings over here

[01:52:35.780 --> 01:52:37.180]
The QIM sales meetings

[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:38.920]
And he's just

[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:40.360]
Keep it up, Pally

[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:41.380]
Keep it up, Pally

[01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.660]
How'd you like that lame excuse that

[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:45.840]
SCRUAN had for the fact that the log is all screwed up

[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:46.680]
And they don't know what's going on

[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.720]
What it was Jeff Heistfall

[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:49.660]
Although I don't blame the SCRUAN so much

[01:52:49.660 --> 01:52:51.920]
Because they always like to spring this crap on her

[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.200]
You know

[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.560]
Nobody ever tells her stuff

[01:52:53.560 --> 01:52:55.480]
That's probably because nobody wants to go back

[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:56.860]
There is a smell of her, you know

[01:52:57.940 --> 01:52:58.640]
Here's Miramar

[01:52:58.640 --> 01:52:58.980]
Hello

[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.660]
Take it out with email to her

[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:02.120]
Miramar

[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:03.140]
Yes sir

[01:53:03.800 --> 01:53:04.640]
Question for you

[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:05.700]
I think it was on Tuesday

[01:53:05.700 --> 01:53:08.200]
You were talking about Paul Wolfwood

[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:10.600]
And I guess it was with a German newspaper

[01:53:11.640 --> 01:53:12.040]
Right

[01:53:12.040 --> 01:53:13.220]
I just read the

[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.000]
It's correction on that from the Guardian

[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.880]
Yes they said that they misinterpreted his comment

[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:18.940]
And they ran a correction

[01:53:19.860 --> 01:53:22.260]
Okay that's why I never heard any more about it

[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:25.520]
I mean on the news

[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.660]
Well yeah because the garden

[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.680]
Well you wouldn't have heard it on the news anyway

[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:29.980]
You mean on the American news

[01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:31.920]
Forget about that

[01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:34.000]
You had to be kidding me

[01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.020]
All right because I'm waiting for the impeachment hearing

[01:53:36.020 --> 01:53:36.560]
So it began

[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.920]
Oh you know something sure

[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:39.840]
This is the best fall I've had in a long time

[01:53:39.840 --> 01:53:40.820]
I mean seriously

[01:53:41.380 --> 01:53:42.240]
And not too

[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:42.640]
Right

[01:53:42.640 --> 01:53:44.660]
To the fact Bob Graham said today

[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:46.920]
His comment was that if it come to find out that they

[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.880]
That they fudged it all about this weapons of mass destruction crap

[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:51.780]
That Bush is going to have to answer for it

[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.980]
Which is kind of code for if you like the last impeachment hearing

[01:53:54.980 --> 01:53:55.900]
Wait to do this one

[01:53:55.900 --> 01:53:57.420]
Well I think we should have a poll

[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:58.620]
Sometime maybe next week

[01:53:58.620 --> 01:54:00.860]
As to who's going to lose their job first

[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:03.760]
Tony Blair or our illustrious president

[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:07.440]
Tony Blair George W Bush or Mo Howard David it I like that

[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:08.860]
Well that would be pretty good

[01:54:08.860 --> 01:54:09.740]
I was right away

[01:54:09.740 --> 01:54:11.300]
My wife from Mississauga

[01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:13.140]
I'm living in Dianne by the leaves

[01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:15.240]
Well mostly Dianne lately

[01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:16.340]
You got it

[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.400]
And if they tried to talk Spayla

[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.800]
They're going to come back out of every time

[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.340]
It again for next year come back one more year

[01:54:21.340 --> 01:54:22.480]
And he said no way

[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:24.760]
Yeah I think we should bring back Kim Horton

[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.600]
What do you think?

[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.460]
I think Tim Horton and Carl Brewer be great

[01:54:27.460 --> 01:54:28.380]
You got it

[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:29.720]
King in their pound of goaliefs though

[01:54:29.720 --> 01:54:30.220]
Thank you

[01:54:30.220 --> 01:54:31.880]
See it the AACC

[01:54:32.860 --> 01:54:35.380]
See right up here which is hockey central Toronto

[01:54:35.380 --> 01:54:36.720]
And the world is some of you know

[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.180]
I'm sure

[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:40.080]
They're telling you that this is the worst crap they've ever seen

[01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:41.560]
What the the game is turning into now

[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:43.320]
In fact some of the comms are saying they should go to

[01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:44.820]
For on for hockey all the time

[01:54:44.820 --> 01:54:46.300]
I just over time and I say

[01:54:46.300 --> 01:54:48.820]
Yes that sounds great open up the iceman

[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:50.120]
Quit the clutching and the grabbing

[01:54:50.120 --> 01:54:50.840]
Make it exciting

[01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.500]
Let's have some 7 to 6 games

[01:54:52.500 --> 01:54:53.740]
Let's have some scoring

[01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:56.220]
Even George you don't care about hockey or sports

[01:54:56.220 --> 01:54:58.360]
Even he likes to score once every couple of years

[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.060]
Hi, how are you?

[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:02.980]
Oh

[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:08.340]
I don't know I guess he's comic relief you know he really is

[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.420]
When you got that sales department photo

[01:55:10.420 --> 01:55:12.140]
The people we've had back there over the years

[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:13.600]
He's he's comic relief

[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.340]
Well in fact great hard to the QAM curve

[01:55:15.860 --> 01:55:18.380]
It's hard to dislike him for a long period of time

[01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.100]
Well he won't let you

[01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:22.060]
Yeah that's right in fact he's like one of the like a cat

[01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:23.220]
You throw it against the wall

[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:25.120]
You shove it out the door and it keeps coming back

[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.860]
Like that some I told you that story

[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:28.300]
Right I don't want to say it again

[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.860]
Because they'll get the pita people after me

[01:55:29.860 --> 01:55:32.120]
That's a true story though I was in summer school in Michigan state

[01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:34.620]
And I'm in Abbott Hall which was a girl's dorm

[01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.480]
I think they knew something

[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.380]
But in the summertime they turned into a guy's dorm

[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:40.080]
And anyway so this little cat keeps showing up at my dorm

[01:55:40.080 --> 01:55:42.500]
And I made the bad mistake the first day I fed it something

[01:55:42.500 --> 01:55:43.100]
I don't know

[01:55:43.520 --> 01:55:45.220]
And of course it keeps coming back

[01:55:46.100 --> 01:55:48.660]
And I would pick that thing up and I can't say it

[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:50.340]
Because I've said it before but it's bad

[01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:51.740]
I like heave it against the wall

[01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:53.500]
Just get out of here and try to take a nap

[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.380]
And it just it didn't phase it in the least

[01:55:57.380 --> 01:55:59.740]
It would keep coming back and just it loved me

[01:55:59.860 --> 01:56:04.220]
I think I guess that's my only pussy story at a pass along

[01:56:04.220 --> 01:56:05.000]
You know pita

[01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.660]
Oh yeah they'll be knocking on the door anytime

[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:08.480]
No those pita people

[01:56:08.480 --> 01:56:10.760]
You did work through a cat while shame on you

[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:11.940]
We're gonna show you a thing or two

[01:56:11.940 --> 01:56:15.100]

Well, no, no, I don't know what you're talking about

You just took a place to a pointful pill

[01:58:08.920 --> 01:58:10.520]
Different prescription, you moron

[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:10.960]

[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:19.480]
Oh, my god, this place is a mess

[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.760]
And my underwear smells like hot polo-y

[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.160]
Now get out of here, my favorite show is on

Anyway, thank you

I am blind, but you're three-five-hundreds

[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.160]
I feel like running on the street

[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.400]
I can't look

[01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:05.200]
I'm a naked man, you want to make me pal-hast

[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:06.140]
No, am I

[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:08.660]
Look, you want to make me pal-hast

Hey, come here, you want to make me pal-hast

[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:10.760]
I'm a naked man, I'm a naked man

Hey, you're a naked man

[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:18.060]
I'm a naked man

[01:59:18.060 --> 01:59:20.520]

[01:59:21.100 --> 01:59:23.480]
Hey, you see, I'm a naked man

[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:24.900]

[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:33.640]
I was on the radio

[01:59:34.380 --> 01:59:37.100]
Just so gunned, told that you won't feel that thing

[01:59:45.880 --> 01:59:47.840]

[02:00:09.680 --> 02:00:11.920]
148 and 560, WQA

[02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:13.660]
And I wonder which it was Greg and Duffair

[02:00:13.660 --> 02:00:14.680]
when to which one was crying

[02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:22.260]
Horse Meat Found in Salami. Food Standards, this is in London. Food Standards officers say they'll test

[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:28.100]
salamis after discovering consumers were unwittingly eating horse meat. The Food Standards Agency,

[02:00:28.100 --> 02:00:32.800]
an independent food safety watchdog said it would test more than 100 salamis and other processed

[02:00:32.800 --> 02:00:38.540]
meats, active and informal survey earlier this year, found out three of 24 products tested

[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:44.100]
contained horse meat was enough and declared as an ingredient. Of the three products found to

[02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:50.720]
contain horse meat, two came from Belgium and a third from Italy. We don't know the, I wonder if

[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:54.560]
Enrico Belied drove that horse in the fourth race, the one from Italy? You know Enrico Belied?

[02:00:54.760 --> 02:00:57.960]
Huh? What? We don't know yet the scale of the problem we want to find out so the

[02:00:57.960 --> 02:01:02.140]
agency's had a food labeling Rosemary Hignet. Some people may prefer not to eat these products,

[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:05.840]
even though food safety is not the issue when they are often traditional recipes.

[02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:11.100]
Food Standards officers said they would also conduct test to find out if any products contained

[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:17.440]
donkey meat. Oh God. Hignet said local councils across Britain would collect samples of meats

[02:01:17.440 --> 02:01:21.560]
including pastrami and chorizo from supermarkets and over the next few months. Oh Chalizo,

[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:26.200]
you know that's that Argentinian sausage right? It's just Spanish for sausage. Oh I love that. I

[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:30.600]
had the seminar that was one of the few good things I had in Amsterdam, one of the few good sausages.

[02:01:31.740 --> 02:01:36.880]
Chalizo, I never had that before, you ever had it? Oh yeah. Pretty good. Yeah. Pretty tasty,

[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:40.640]
pretty spicy. Only they give you like little, I don't know, maybe because it's those

[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:46.260]
spices that little tiny portions. There's different, different kinds. Like a little small weiner.

[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:50.540]
They said, here you go. Here's something you can relate to. We have a weiner. I said,

[02:01:50.540 --> 02:01:55.340]
guess what? I'm not coming back. You assholes. How's the belief? Stick it. The guy who called

[02:01:55.340 --> 02:02:00.320]
me before he gave me the pull for it tomorrow. We haven't finished it yet, but who should lose

[02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:05.100]
his job first? I've got four choices already. George W. Bush, Tony Blair, Donald Rumsfeld,

[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:10.180]
or Mohawar Davida, and we'll add some more on there. Isn't that great? Excellent. I think

[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:14.560]
that's a good pull. Something we had never done before. And speaking of be full, don't forget to go

[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:18.360]
on our website today. Not only vote on the pull, but also take a look at that award-winning picture

[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:24.720]
of Moe and all foes. It's a beautiful thing. What I tell you Moe, practice makes perfect.

[02:02:25.540 --> 02:02:34.320]
Here's Volca. Hello. Volca. Hello. Yes sir. Oh I'm on 95. I'll start to hear you. First of all,

[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:39.180]
the market's well-being. That's what the James Brolam was on. He was about 30 years ago. That was

[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:45.940]
a TV show. I called about there. You're investing the plant thing in San Francisco. I just finished

[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:53.180]
the book by a guy named Schlosser. Eric Schlosser. It's about Black Underground Economy. Did you read

[02:02:53.180 --> 02:03:01.780]
that? It's about three sections. One section, the first section is about the pot laws and Ed Rosenthal,

[02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:07.040]
the blog is mentioned in there several times. It's a very current book. One of the cool things

[02:03:07.040 --> 02:03:13.420]
about it is that many of the men that tried to put Bobo away a couple of years ago, they were

[02:03:13.420 --> 02:03:20.400]
trying to pander for the stiff pot laws. After their kids got busted, they mentioned things. Some

[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:24.540]
people are like Bob Barber and not Bob Barber, but another one that's similar to him. But his

[02:03:24.540 --> 02:03:29.280]
kid got busted after saying we have to put these people who peddled poison to our children in jail

[02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:36.940]
forever. One of the kids got busted tearing 40 pounds of pot across the country. This guy shows up.

[02:03:37.120 --> 02:03:43.960]
His progress was important. The kid admits that he had taken a part of taking 3,000 pounds across.

[02:03:45.220 --> 02:03:48.900]
They ended up giving him only two years. They said they wouldn't give them that much. But the

[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:56.700]
violators bailed three times by doing cocaine. The congressman said, cleaning before the judge

[02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:02.200]
in tears saying he's such a good boy. He said he has a good part. He didn't really meet it. Could

[02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.540]
you please give them a break? He never smells for each drink. Well, that's exactly. It shows the

[02:04:06.920 --> 02:04:11.980]
hypocrisy of the whole BS as well. The other thing I wanted to mention, the other book that

[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:19.120]
these are both on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list right now. It's the guy that

[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:24.680]
writes for the Guardian that, oh man, I forget his name, starts with a P. He says, he's about

[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:31.820]
number 6% on the list. He writes about the Bush senior and after Bush senior got out of

[02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:40.300]
office, like the Goldbine in Colorado, the biggest one in the world, how they gave George

[02:04:40.300 --> 02:04:45.680]
Senior all the money to help push the Canadian to the school of fine. They put up a 10 cents

[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:51.540]
an acre and it shows all the payoffs that the Bush family has gotten over the years. This guy is a

[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:56.080]
I think it's already under the observer. He's even my driver's fist, do you?

[02:04:56.520 --> 02:05:02.480]
No, no, his name is like plot or something like that. He's looking at the top 10 this week in the

[02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:07.920]
book review you'll see it's, I think they really have one on drive and slips on my mind. I get some

[02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:12.580]
too old. If I can remember Marcus 12, there you go. We're in a time warp like Boca-Bride.

[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:19.300]
Okay, I'll look it up. Thanks. I love these shoes. Bye. Thanks. 153 at 560 WQAN.

[02:05:21.540 --> 02:05:25.340]
This is 430560 WQAN.

[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:35.880]
From the producers of the iMac war, all Wolfowitz and Karl Role presents Bush 911,

[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:42.400]
our fearless hero starring Robert DuValle as Karl Role. They hit the towers at

[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:48.840]
an hour and a clock this morning and Mel Gibson as our glorious and fearless leader for life.

[02:05:49.580 --> 02:05:54.040]
Those bastards to the kids I'll read you a minute another time. I paint my face blue.

[02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:57.460]
Three or three times for me to leap into action.

[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:08.280]
Stop right there, you bulldoers. You're too late, O'Glorious, Nanny. The buildings are down.

[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:12.620]
They're not old. Jump for our wage war until those rifles do is a grotesque justice.

[02:06:18.580 --> 02:06:27.620]
All the facts in every detail, carefully calculated to keep you amused. Bush 911, our fearless hero,

[02:06:28.160 --> 02:06:34.500]
only on showtime. 157 at 560 WQAN. Meddog 2 to 4. Here's a lady in sunrise. Hello.

[02:06:34.500 --> 02:06:39.100]
Neil. Yes, me. I have a good Philip Seymour Hoffman film for you.

[02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:42.440]
Okay. It's called Love Liza. Have you seen that one? No.

[02:06:43.260 --> 02:06:48.960]
Oh, this is it's very intense. He becomes a huffer. He starts sniffing gasoline after his wife passed

[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:52.420]
her away. And it's just one of those. Is there any Huffington in it?

[02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:57.360]
It's just despair. It's like Requiem in that way. Oh brother.

[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:07.560]
Yeah. But check it. Did you see Magnolia? Yeah, I did. I liked it. I liked it. George

[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:12.660]
despised it. He said he said he said there were too many loose ends. No, no, I like the ending.

[02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:18.220]
Because that's why life is. Yeah, it was just the message of the movie is that a bunch of weird

[02:07:18.220 --> 02:07:22.140]
crap happens. That's all there. Exactly. I mean, what's the point of going to each one of the

[02:07:22.140 --> 02:07:26.760]
nine different storylines and like having a wrap them all up? We get the message.

[02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:30.440]
And there's really nothing redeeming about it except, you know, sometimes life sucks.

[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:35.280]
Right. Exactly. And sometimes frogs fall out of the sky. Thanks. Okay.

[02:07:35.360 --> 02:07:39.980]
Yeah. Have a great day. Anyway, the poll today, this was a pretty interesting show. We were

[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:42.680]
like all over the place. I enjoyed this today immensely. Didn't you?

[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:47.360]
It was okay. It was a little spastic. I knew it was okay. It was four hours.

[02:07:48.180 --> 02:07:52.100]
It was four hours. Give or take. Give or take a couple of minutes. I thought it was just fine.

[02:07:52.620 --> 02:07:56.260]
I read the Brian Greacy story out of the hero. I reread it, which I don't want to talk about it,

[02:07:56.260 --> 02:08:00.320]
because it's a sports thing. But money is the issue, which is very sad. The compensation package.

[02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:05.000]
You see that boner, boy? Well, not this story, but I know that was the boner of

[02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:08.680]
contention was the, hey, just nauseating. You know, a kid that could all that money who's

[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:12.240]
got marginal talent at best, get another chance right there in his, uh,

[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:16.680]
a screw, a screw, a Brian 750 votes on a pool. Which of these do you care about most?

[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:22.400]
Where are the weapons of mass destruction? 330, 44% where the hell are they? We want to know,

[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:28.360]
Mo. Oh, speaking of that one is Mo getting canned. 156, 1 to 0. Is George gay, 96,

[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:34.400]
where there, uh, will there really be Middle East peace? 93. Is that Perrell's real voice? 37.

[02:08:35.140 --> 02:08:39.980]
Martha Stewart gets indicted. 22. And it pleases me more than I can begin to tell you.

[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:46.880]
In the last place, the least amount of interest by far, 14 people, 1.8% of a flying crap

[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:50.520]
about whether Sammy used the cork bat or not. Bye, bye, bye.

[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:57.620]
560, 2A-M, Miami for Leonardo. He prefers the company of men.
