[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]
That these are your props, so beautiful.

[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.540]
I'm so glad for the fact that I got

[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:56.560]
a

[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.260]
And I'm embarrassed to be an American

[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.500]
Where we take triadically

[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.780]
Way the flag it would have

[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.480]
With our head in the sand

[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:12.920]
And blindly follow the powers that

[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.660]
Beep, have a sad tick

[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:15.480]
Pfft!

[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.460]
Up, washing state brand new

[00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.300]
Is on a 65 inch screen

[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.620]
Scratch your balls and pie

[00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:24.460]
Everything's okay

[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.620]
In the goddamn USA

[00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.060]
God bless America

[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.300]
You'll come back now you hear

[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.460]
916-560-WQA

[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:36.900]
I'm a section of Tampa International Airport

[00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:38.440]
Was evacuated yesterday

[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.920]
After the airport baggage screening system

[00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.820]
Detected a mouse trap and a piece of luggage

[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.860]
A mouse trap

[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.580]
Oh my god

[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.040]
The airport's ticketing area was evacuated

[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.840]
For about 45 minutes but the Tampa police

[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.560]
Bomb Squad found no explosives in the bag

[00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:55.320]
It did retrieve a mouse trap from inside a coffee can

[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.340]
Said Chris Radigan, a spokesman for the

[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.460]
TWAA, T Transportation Security Administration

[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.980]
When you look at the monitor it had all these wires

[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.020]
And looked very, very suspicious she said

[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.600]
Airport spokeswoman Brenda Gegehagen

[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.320]
Said the bag's owner was talking with the police airport

[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.520]
And TSA officials the owner was not in charge

[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.340]
She said she said a few planes from five airlines had 20 to 30 minute delays

[00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:18.760]
But didn't have an exact number

[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.480]
Mouse trap

[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.260]
First of all why would you carry a mouse trap in your luggage

[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.680]
Maybe you need it where you're going

[00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:26.380]
See Christine Aguilar

[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:31.680]
Huh what's wrong with that

[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.720]
Got to carry a build a better mouse trap

[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.620]
So we've also had some more additions to our survey

[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.960]
Although I noticed like George says nobody's on a phone now

[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.440]
Because they all ate me and people called in shouting names out

[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.060]
That's not the way we do it on this show

[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.480]
We nice to have a little verbal intercourse with some of you

[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.780]
Have some ideas about some of these people as opposed to

[00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.660]
Just calling up like a hit and run artist

[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.740]
Like what was the one that I didn't put that mother?

[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.080]
Several I'm not putting down the ones I am putting down

[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.440]
Buddy Holly Frank Sinatra Freddie Mercury

[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.360]
Another queen

[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.920]
Jerry Garcia and Rick Nelson

[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.200]
How could we have forgotten Rick Nelson? Love Rick Nelson

[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.080]
Love Hosea and Harriet they're both dead

[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.120]
Boy a lot of dead people you know man

[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.500]
And more every day

[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:18.880]
5 6 7 0 5 6 8 8 8 and 10

[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.860]
And Verizon one of the slots are really great news

[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.580]
It's Tuesday it's the 14th of January which means

[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.620]
Smallville the night new episode

[00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:27.900]
Now is it really a two hour special thing or was it

[00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.040]
Did somebody just make that up?

[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.100]
Oh no I don't know I'll check

[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:31.280]
Well let's check that out

[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.820]
When it out let's check it out come on

[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.200]
A two hour special smallville man can you imagine

[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.240]
Get out the extra big box of Kleenex

[00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.300]
Man oh man

[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.620]
So Michael Mayo steals a column right out of the show yesterday

[00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:45.880]
Wow in today's this unsentinel

[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.160]
It's on our website by the way or will be momentarily as soon as Carlos gets through a showering and douching in there

[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.000]
Now going to take a leak at about 8 25 this morning in the ati room

[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.080]
And there's Carlos in there in the sink

[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.580]
This whole body is in the sink he's got the water running full blast

[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.080]
He's showering in the sink shaving and douching at the same time

[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.240]
Kind of like an all in one deal

[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:12.480]
I mean maybe they can develop a deal like that where you like it like a chamber

[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:18.280]
Like a gigantic toilet like thing and what you do is you just get in it and the water like it does everything

[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.200]
Like a shower brush your teeth you shower take a dump and

[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:24.720]
Douch all at the same time

[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:27.140]
I think it's an invitation station wow

[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:30.540]
This is wqa your sanitation station oh

[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.860]
We're trying to clean up our act aren't we no no

[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.220]
So Michael Mayo writes

[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.980]
Don't tell me their faxes coming in on this stuff because you ought to see some of the names coming in like frank zappa

[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.860]
Frank zappa was not oh get out of here

[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:52.760]
Frank zappa wasn't a recording artist like in the sense of recording artist he was a

[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.060]
Comedian he'll do well

[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.820]
Oh no virgin Mary seen on picture window in Canada

[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.640]
Oi hey do you see this? I didn't see that

[00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.840]
I think that it's an omen man. I think that the second coming is coming. Oh, let's get rid of that call from highly okay

[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.900]
Hi, Alia. Hello. Hey

[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.560]
Yeah, okay Jim Krochi did time in a bottle too

[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.740]
And Karen Carpenter I think is one that you go. Oh Karen Carpenter excellent choice. Love you. Thank you

[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.240]
I told him to be good call from highly they're always great

[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:29.420]
Karen Carpenter Eric. I'm sorry about this, but we did you know just a

[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:32.720]
We're not sorry. He missed a whole bunch of names anyway, so we'll just uh

[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.580]
I'm gonna call him during the break. You're gonna one. I will call him during the break

[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.640]
To catch him up. What do you mean? He was all taking a dump or something

[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.440]
That's a good job. I can't imagine Eric doing something discussing like that

[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.940]
I can imagine Carlos doing that with the virgin Mary stories on the site

[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.700]
Okay, we're just just relax a little bit. Okay, just take it easy

[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:57.460]
Slow down a little bit. We got four long excruciating hours to butcher here today

[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.880]
So just just take it easy

[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.660]
This is an exactly like yesterday show where we can fill in with all that music although

[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.480]
Although an appropriate thing to do it certainly would be appropriate to remember give us some memories all

[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:14.480]
I don't have any music here like all my doors stuff is up in Toronto. Do we have any doors music here now

[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.820]
Mike back there back in it, huh?

[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.400]
We might have some uh

[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:23.080]
Like I got compilation discs greatest hits of this and that we might have some of them

[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.300]
I'm talking about playing the doors for four hours today although

[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:36.060]
I mean who we got on their Elvis. We certainly have an Elvis. I saw one disk back there. It's somebody didn't steal yet

[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.020]
John Lennon, we got every Beatles song that was ever invented, I imagine.

[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:45.040]
George Harrison? Do we have any George Harrison? Oh yeah, we did. Back there.

[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:48.060]
Remember after he died we had that thing back. Of course I'm not assuming that

[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.680]
they're all still here. Roy Orbison, must play Roy Orbison today for hours.

[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.760]
Jim Morrison, like I said, Jimmy Hendrix, we don't have no Jimmy Hendrix.

[00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.080]
We got Purple Hayes. I don't know what I got.

[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.060]
I got Judy Garland. Judy Garland would be good. He did a lot of drugs.

[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:06.760]
He had a lot of BOOs. But he had never done any drugs that we know of.

[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.880]
But he had a lot of BOOs. He was kind of like clean cut, Yahoo, all American red

[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:16.080]
necky with him nasty glasses and he's dead. Jim Krochi, we don't have that here.

[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:21.240]
I got it home. Maybe tomorrow we'll do that. Sounds like a plan to make.

[00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:25.040]
Frank Sinatra, we certainly don't have no Frank Sinatra music here. Sorry.

[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.740]
We got some Frank Sinatra operatives. What do you got there? Not Frank Sinatra.

[00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:32.760]
So, Bing Crosby. Bing Crosby is even better. And he's also dead.

[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.040]
Let's put him on there. Just a joke. So here are the names that I added on there,

[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.720]
which you shouldn't have to Buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, Freddie Mercury,

[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:49.440]
Jerry Garcia, Rick Nelson and Karen Carpenter. Please, Karen, maybe a little salad would be good.

[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:52.820]
Maybe the one that's Gloria would eat on all in the family.

[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.280]
The one that Archie keeps screaming. How about a little salad?

[00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.460]
Come on, Gloria. Boy, she a pig or what? Sally Struthers.

[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:04.260]
Yeah, I used to like Sally Struthers when she was on that show. And as soon as that show went off here,

[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.300]
I turned a despiser. And that as soon as the show went off,

[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.420]
is also when she blimped up to balloon size or ballooned up to balloon size,

[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.260]
however you want to look at it. A cow. A lot of fat braids on TV, you know that?

[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.280]
Rosie O'Donnell, Roseanne, Oprah, Sally Struthers,

[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.940]
starred Jones on the view. Oh my God. She's not fat. She's in another category.

[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.860]
Fat. Have you seen her shoe commercials for Payloss?

[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:41.020]
Well, how she find her shoes? I guarantee she don't tie no shoes. You notice women don't tie shoes anyway.

[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.980]
Oh, you know what I've got to wear now? I went to my podiatrist yesterday.

[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.880]
They might have thanked her a lot when we were the best, baby.

[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:48.180]
Remember, even though the Panthers are just getting annihilated,

[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:51.440]
we can't pick on remember for that. He had planned all those pretty soon. They might sign them up.

[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:56.480]
But his doctors are the best. Went to my podiatrist yesterday. I've got a bone spur.

[00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.940]
Heels spur? Not a big deal.

[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.060]
But I got a pilot. Saw it. I got a pilot off for the nail file.

[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.600]
But so you know, one of the many things he did. By the way, thanks again.

[00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.980]
Doc, you're great. One of the many things that he recommended.

[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.180]
Shoes with high heels. He said he recommended boots.

[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.480]
I'm not going to be wearing no cowboy boots. Can you imagine me wearing cowboy boots?

[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.120]
Yeah, Carl said, oh, yeah, yeah.

[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.480]
But I'm thinking like maybe high heels like pumps are pumps, right?

[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:33.100]
Pumps would be good. See, I mean cowboy boots. It clashes with my image.

[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:37.260]
But I'm thinking more like well, you know, they have this school marm shoes.

[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.600]
They're nice and square toad. Oh, yeah.

[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.080]
What the heels on them? Maybe I can borrow some of those from my mouth.

[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:48.000]
I've got a size three foot. I've just squeezed them on. You know, just get the old shoehorn and shove it in there.

[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:54.900]
Sightings of images of the virgin Mary on windows and walls in the northern reaches of the Canadian province of Saskatchewan

[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:58.660]
have produced a minor tourism miracle for the remote villages involved.

[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:00.860]
Exactly. Exactly. My thoughts precisely.

[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.800]
Since September, mysterious images of Mary, mother of Christ,

[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.920]
have been reported in four villages, three of which are accessible only by airplane.

[00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:14.960]
Well, you know, she, I don't need a plane to get where she's going, sparing hundreds of people to visit.

[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.300]
How do you like that? The virgin Mary in Saskatchewan, she finds the most bizarre places.

[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.800]
Jesus Christ! The latest images appeared yesterday on two homes in Bolville, Saskatchewan,

[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.340]
which has fewer than a thousand residents. See, she don't want to be like an in-time square.

[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.660]
She don't want to be like in some place. She wants to go into the, uh, boondocks, like in clear water on a side of that bank building.

[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:39.880]
The images appeared to glow at night and have been captured on video, said,

[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.080]
Bertha de Rocher, who owns one of the homes. No relation to Leo, I'm sure.

[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:46.840]
De Rocher said she didn't want to tell others about the image on her picture window at first.

[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:50.160]
I told my mom and she said, oh, you're probably seeing your own shadow,

[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:57.400]
so I thought people wouldn't believe me. De Rocher told Reuters. Since then, more than 300 people have come from hundreds of miles around to view her window.

[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:04.740]
It was just glowing so beautifully. I had tears in my eyes, De Rocher said, adding she believes the sightings are some kind of divine message.

[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:05.960]
Maybe they're from...

[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:06.680]
Oh, God!

[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:13.100]
The Roman Catholic Archbishop of the Keywiton Diocese, home to the four communities, was a way on retreat and unable to comment.

[00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.700]
A spokesman at his office said that Ices has not received any official reports of the sightings.

[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.660]
Sightings of the images of Christ Mary and Saints are not uncommon around the world,

[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.460]
and it had been witnessed in media's diverses glass, water, a burrito, and a Camero muscle car.

[00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.480]
Oh, yeah!

[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.560]
I would have thought he would have showed up in a Corvette.

[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.600]
By the way, mad dog, that was my Corvette. You were talking about it. It's not white, it's silver.

[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:36.020]
Did you know mad dog is colorblind?

[00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.760]
No. He was asking me yesterday, who's the white Corvette?

[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:44.660]
That's a snappy car. I said, mine is silver. Well, there's a white one down there. There wasn't any white one. It was mine.

[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.020]
Huh? He's colorblind.

[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:51.580]
Everything he sees has got like either aqua and orange, or it's that Admissigan blue.

[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.060]
Everything?

[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.120]
Everything he be the color guy.

[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:03.600]
Possibly the most recent famous Canadian sighting was a Christ-like image on the brick wall of a Tim Horton's donut shop at Brasda Or on Canada's Atlanta coast of 1998.

[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.200]
Oh, man, I bet you he was there with Tim getting signatures for Doug McLean.

[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.780]
Or is it the other way around?

[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.220]
You think? Let's call up what's her name in Washington and find out what's almost her name, that hockey writer?

[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:17.200]
That broad? Rachel Alexander.

[00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.020]
Very good. Oh my God. Let's hear it for George.

[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.800]
She had really large breasts.

[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:29.780]
Rachel Alexander, who had a gigantic pair of hooters, which is why George members are very vividly, but wouldn't know a hockey puck if you stuffed a whole bunch of men between her breasts.

[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.180]
Rachel Alexander, Bauwau Pikao-Kick.

[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.060]
Rachel, Bauwau Pikao-Kick.

[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:39.020]
And she got promoted.

[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.820]
And what do we got? We got Mike Russo and David J. Neill.

[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.480]
Of course she got promoted. Did I mention?

[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.080]
Big breasts.

[00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:47.400]
Well, that seems to work a lot of places.

[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:54.220]
27 after 9 at 560 WQM Snow and Miami unbelievable Tom Limon and Joe Prieto are buried.

[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.800]
Not necessarily in snow, they buried in cars.

[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.160]
The fact that we have sent Hal at Pontiac so many cars, there's no place to park them.

[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:04.980]
Even Tom Limon had to park cars in his driveway and probably won't bring them back, so they need to place one in yours.

[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:11.120]
Hal at his blowing out all the new vehicles, regardless of profit, that's what they're saying now, when in doubt we're blown it out.

[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:17.800]
Including the Pontiac vibes starting at only $13,998 and up to 5 grand off on every GMC envoy in stock.

[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:20.980]
Plus get 0% financing or up to a $3,000 rebate.

[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:25.560]
Of course Hal at's also got as always a dependable selection of pre-owned cars, production SUVs.

[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.860]
If credit is a problem for you, if everybody in the town just laughs at you when you come on a lot, don't worry about that.

[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.580]
Just go to Hal at they won't laugh, they'll take your money, they'll cut you deal at Hal at Pontiac no matter how much of a deadbeat you are, even if you know Carlos.

[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:44.400]
It's a winter blizzard emergency clearance, Hal is going on right now at Hal at Pontiac GMC, 13401 Soptix, Ohio.

[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.780]
That's US1 across from the falls where they've been doing it right by people for over 35 years, they're open every day, seven days a week.

[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:59.460]
As always you'll save even more if you tell them you heard about this thing on the Near Rogers Show called the Near Rogers Neal Deal Hotline at Hal at right now at 203 at 1-88-534-421.

[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.400]
That's 1-88-534-421, where Hal at Pontiac GMC proudly says we be professional grade.

[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:12.860]
My, my and local, we're sports radio 560s, you ain't, you ain't, I ain't.

[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:27.460]
Hey there, people on Bobbibrow, the sea on the queue is boy and sound, my car is fast, my teeth is shining, I tell all the girls they can kiss my hiding.

[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:55.760]
Welcome here I am, I'm at a famous school, I'm present sharp and I'm acting cool, I got a cheerleader here once they help with my fate, but better do all the work and maybe later I'll bring the roll, God I am the American prince, I do not think out too extreme, I love my handsome son of a bitch, but I'm gonna get a good job and be real rich.

[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:25.740]
Women's Liberation, we've gained, we've been all across the nation, I'll tell you people, I was not rich, I caught this guy by the name of pressure, a lady, a little bitch then, all she tried to make you say when, she had a fault in a vice, but she left the bitch, I guess I'm still above, but I'm not.

[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:41.720]
Now it's just a bit, oh God I am the American prince, but now I smell like gasoline, and I'm a miserable son of a bitch, and by a lawyer a lady, I don't know who is.

[00:27:41.720 --> 00:28:10.980]
I want the one, the one, the one, the one, so we'll win out and bought me a leisure suit, I jingle my chains, but I'm still kind of cute, got a job doing radio promo, and none of the jacks can even tell I'm a home dog, if they've slid me in a friend, sort of dripped it along, and say, yes and then, I can take about an hour on the tower, a hour, along as I guess,

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:36.300]
a little bull, the chow, oh God I am the American dream, with a spindle, I've got till it makes me scream, and I'll do anything together again, I'll lay away nights and sing a thank you friend, oh God oh God I'm so fantastic, thanks to Freddie, I'm a sexual spastic, and my name is Bob and Brown,

[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:54.260]
what's me now, a fool down, and my name is Bob and Brown, what's me now, a fool down, and my name is Bob and Brown, what's me now, a fool down,

[00:28:54.260 --> 00:29:24.240]
so here's a fact of Paul, who says, Frank Zappa with the most prolific songwriter composer in American music history, do you know that? I had no idea, well that's what Paul says, he has written composed over 400 original songs, he spoke out against bad government, campaign for prostate cancer research, he conducted voters registrations at all his concerts, and generally spoke his mind through music about the entire human condition, please add him to your list, thank you for your consideration, well I mean that's so polite, thank you for your consideration, how can we refuse, how can we refuse, and not only do we put him on the list,

[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:53.500]
but we also played Bobby Brown, he'd be going down, so the list is growing like crazy, now I knew it, let's see we've added Buddy Holly, Frank Sinatra, I'm just adding the ones that I had fast Eric, a lot of hope it's on there already, John Lennon's got 17, Frank Sinatra's got 17, Jimmy Hendrix 16, Elvis 10, see what I mean about Elvis everybody else in single digits, pulls up, but we're adding to it, it's not done yet, Freddie Mercury, get these Eric, Jerry Garcia,

[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:23.480]
Rick Nelson he won't do that well but he should, well he's got a lot of competition, not to slide it, here in Carpenter we could play some Carpenter's today what are you, no, thank you, and here's some other one Kurt Cobain, how can we have left them off here, Kurt Cobain, little insane, and a lot of pain, not no Mo, and Frank Zappa, we just put him on there, so there's the list it's expanding, even as I sit here I'm on a really, I was, I'm not sure if I can get in, I don't know if I can get in, I'm not sure if I can get in, I'm just, I just can't look at him, I shouldn't need to do this, I shouldn't need to do this, I'm not sure, I can't, I can't do this, I can't do this, I'm just about here, I can't do this, I can't do this, I can't do

[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.600]
my fat ass. So one out of a hundred here on this fact isn't too bad it says I can't

[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:31.340]
believe you left Kurt Cobain off list. Well he's on there now okay just calm down. What

[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:36.960]
about the what about the guy from Millie Vanille who killed himself? The guy from

[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:43.700]
recording artist not lip-sinkers recording artists. And then it says what about David Lee

[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:48.500]
Roth he may not be dead but his career is. That's cute. That's a whole other category.

[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:54.140]
Okay so like I said one out of five thousand ain't that bad. Did I finish my story about

[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:57.760]
the Virgin Mary on the picture window and says, guys I want to not sure I finished that. Yes I did.

[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:03.920]
Oh yeah the Tim Horton donut shop. I'm Canada's Atlanta coast of 1998. He sure gets around

[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:10.000]
at Virgin Mary and I might have to play that momentarily. Well Virgin Mary. And the best part

[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.200]
of the whole deal is that they actually assholes out there who believe this stuff. That's the most

[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.120]
frightening part of it okay. Oh my goodness it's the Virgin Mary on the side of our bank building.

[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:24.220]
It's the Virgin Mary on top of a Toteino's pizza. It's the Virgin Mary inside of a double burrito

[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:34.300]
supreme with extra beans from Taco Bell. How do you like that? I wonder and then today is the

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:38.400]
14th we missed the yesterday. Is it only on Friday the 13th or the 13th of every month? We don't

[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.640]
hear about it no more so must be out of business. 13th of every month supposedly that

[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:48.660]
Rosa Lopez is house in Hollywood. She's got a date every 13th of every month. Lucky 13.

[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.560]
Lucky for Rosa although I guess not lucky anymore because she used to have all the whole block

[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.420]
blocked off with people parking there to come and watch wait for the Virgin Mary on the 13th of

[00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:02.220]
each month that Rosa Lopez in Hollywood. But I guess she's small potatoes now. Now that Virgin Mary

[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:06.620]
is making the tour up there in Canada. Probably heard that I hang out there every now and then.

[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.500]
Probably looking for me right here Mary right over here bitch. Oh that was bad.

[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.820]
You can't call the Virgin Mary a bitch can you just did? I just did.

[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:25.800]
So Michael Mayo writes a column totally cold from this show playing hooky to remember a forgotten

[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.960]
voice about my cranberry. Better late than never Mike. It's about time he wrote something

[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:34.560]
not though it's still a pretty crappy column. Back to the sports page Mike you know tell

[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.840]
those people over there to sunset and they'll pull me back right below and I know a little bit

[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:42.080]
about sports not too much but certainly writing these kind of like human interests or whatever

[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:47.800]
this is I don't know what you call it. Anybody have any idea what we call this column that

[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:53.340]
Mike Mayo writes in the sunset every day. But anyway well I guess I better do the break first

[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:57.380]
then we'll get to that. It's not all that long it's Mike deserves it. Any points out who's actually

[00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:03.320]
what I've been saying about how they only give him like a just a cursory acknowledgement to his death

[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.200]
and I guess he wasn't no more more as give which is what Mike Mayo points out and then what I just

[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:11.120]
said the other day yes. Nice going Neil thank you very much. The check better be in the male Mike

[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.480]
stealing columns off of the show he does mention me and Hank in there briefly that we were at IOD

[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.000]
that's the only coverage we get on the Uranus in the newsmeet anymore is the fact that you know

[00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:28.220]
we used to be an IOD not that we're here now or anything to do with our shows now or anything

[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.360]
about our lives now or anything at all but just well they used to be at IOD back when they were good

[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:41.220]
back when we liked them now they're on QAM so automatically we despised them you know what I

[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:45.360]
think they started despising us I think back in about March of last year you know what happened

[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:54.360]
here in March of last year no what well let me give you a clue okay a short clue to what happened

[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:59.360]
here last the gate yeah he came here last March and that's when the whole world seemed to like

[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:06.140]
turn on us all of us even a mad dog I heard a call on his show they they hear that guy who called

[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.940]

[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.640]

[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:19.640]
mad dog what's not to like okay just because he went to Michigan just because he's a Homer which

[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:26.580]
we like how Homer a Homer's huh we love the mad dog and this guy see even somebody as innocuous

[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.180]

you can't get much higher than that to be like right under the king I don't think Janice

[00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:13.170]
would want to be under the king but nevertheless not in his present condition or hers

[00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:17.030]

[00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:45.530]
smile a chuckle even on adverse times like when we're listening to monitoring mo look at what we

[00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:51.670]

maybe when we play a middly of all the dead people's greatest hits

[00:43:56.290 --> 00:44:00.910]
when you come right down to it i don't want to say that the dead recording artists are better

[00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:04.730]
than the ones who are still alive but when you really think of it and you look at this list huh

[00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.330]

[00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.330]

[00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:05.410]
who that was right

[00:46:07.330 --> 00:46:09.750]
probably Ray van jiric

[00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.550]
never Ray van jiric sure that's an intellectual asshole

[00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:17.790]
from the beginning of the way in fact i saw a piece on uh maybe it was on the biography channel

[00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:23.090]
they were doing a gym Morrison thing and they had the thing about uh down here when he got he

[00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:26.930]
never exposed himself here by the way he never actually whipped it out he threatened to

[00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.630]
and the cops still busted him Jim Morrison because they heard that it was so big it would have

[00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:34.750]
been like a runaway alligator or something but anyway so Ray van jiric is telling the whole story

[00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.210]
what a sued he is remember we had that clip from him back in ios i used to play

[00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:44.350]
but it could be any clip he always has to hold yeah real a real pontificating uh self-aggrandizing

[00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:47.510]
so there's a little Jim croche for you now let's see who else can we have uh

[00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:52.090]
when the fork got in there huh how about some queen how about some Freddie Mercury

[00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:56.790]
i got some of the computer i think

[00:46:56.790 --> 00:47:01.370]
stuff said he knows some queen how about Roy Orbison that's what we want

[00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:04.670]
isn't that a shame that we have to like put him to the test and

[00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:08.170]
well why don't we have this and once upon a time we did i got plenty of

[00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.410]
Orbison up in Toronto my studio is up there i may have to go up there and play music

[00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:14.690]
if you scour some of those things there might be some Roy Orbison in there

[00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:21.250]
some of these discs that you have back there buried you mean like only the lonely something like that

[00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:26.490]

in spite of what you're saying see Carlos again there's no contest there you're saying that

[00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:13.010]
Paul McCartney is better than George Harrison Paul McCartney created more so much more music you know

what so did a grateful dead no no great music you don't even let me face the sentence more good songs

[00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:27.810]

[00:58:26.230 --> 00:58:30.770]
well that's not it i already took that out that's on there should he be on there oh i found something

[00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:37.650]
though by the way okay decal the clown they call us and it's right the boy tip those tomorrow

[00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:44.170]
every night you didn't like this one no i like it a lot and now i mean you can play a little

[00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:50.370]
but there's a right the boy ladies

[00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:59.190]
what is a lesser song or what they know probably

[00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:06.890]
we got to get uh what was that oh you got it

[00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:13.610]
which was like hurry lateness for literally but he still looked the same i'd say

[00:59:13.610 --> 00:59:18.030]
kill it that's uh that's so depressing it's even more i mean at least the reason we played all

[00:59:18.030 --> 00:59:21.930]
the depressing bg stuff yesterday's because moris just died over the weekend so we were able to

[00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:27.990]
tolerate some of the earlier bg's the real prediscode depressing days but that's really morbid

[00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:31.850]
but right the boy you'd have to give us one of these strangers not just ugliest he was ugly

[00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:35.130]
but one of these strangest looking dudes whoever recorded a song would you agree

[00:59:35.130 --> 00:59:40.070]
absolutely that'd be a good poll to take some time the strangest uh recording artist huh

[00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:46.410]
huh how about love is strange by mcci and sylvia who i know how about strange brew by

[01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:06.110]
remember that day that we lost touch with the audience right you lost touch with the audience we

[01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:10.910]
lost touch with the audience so here's the list so far has the pool coming a lot of votes John

[01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:19.570]
London 41 muffs that he voted for John Lennon took the easy way out frank sanatra 29 jim morison 26

[01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:52.190]
this is not a big Elvis crowds are mind me again on the 80th anniversary of his death remind me don't

[01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:57.110]
play no Elvis stuff because it alienates and i mean the bg stuff yesterday they tolerated well they

[01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:02.150]
took it they took it with good in good spirit i mean like if Elvis dies again we could like have an

[01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:06.350]
Elvis a little beat us over the head with the bg plus i probably chased chased a lot of the

[01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:10.410]
others people away by tacitizing the men out there who've been uh schlepping to grace land

[01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:15.370]

Kering Carpenter, Kurt Cobain, Frank Zappa, Bob Marley,

[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:04.470]
Bobby Deren, somewhere beyond the sea.

[01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.990]
Is that what it's called?

[01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.370]
I could have looked it up in the bookmark.

[01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:08.170]
Don't play Butch Boss.

[01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:11.450]
Sam Cook, Patsy Klein, Otis Redding and...

[01:20:12.330 --> 01:20:13.490]
And what I find.

[01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.890]
I found it.

[01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:17.230]
I've been needing for what you're saying.

[01:20:17.410 --> 01:20:20.350]
When you say you know I'm stating it, no one but you know it's for me.

[01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.370]
I've been needing for what you're saying.

[01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:23.670]
When you say you don't care.

[01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:25.570]
Nobody else but me.

[01:20:26.750 --> 01:20:28.150]
I sure liked him, Otis.

[01:20:28.230 --> 01:20:29.330]
I liked him a lot.

[01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:29.790]
Rick Nelson.

[01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:32.050]
So how's that vote coming so far?

[01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:33.350]
We got 75 million votes.

[01:20:34.090 --> 01:20:34.890]
316 already?

[01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:36.990]
Holy moly man.

[01:20:37.690 --> 01:20:38.790]
Otis Redding don't have none yet.

[01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.710]
Well he just went on there.

[01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:40.630]
Huh?

[01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.190]
He doesn't have any Otis.

[01:20:43.390 --> 01:20:44.570]
Patsy Klein's got one.

[01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:44.930]
See?

[01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.750]
There you go.

[01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:47.010]
Probably the guy who facts me that.

[01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:49.670]
Rick Nelson's got two votes.

[01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:50.810]
Are you people out of your mind?

[01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:51.730]
He's only got two votes.

[01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:53.710]
Jesus Christ.

[01:20:55.570 --> 01:20:57.350]
Call out Virgin Mary and get her on the case.

[01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:58.130]
We only got two votes.

[01:20:58.570 --> 01:20:58.750]
Yeah.

[01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.770]
Mary.

[01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:01.510]
Oh, don't be forget about Mike Mayow's call.

[01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:02.890]
Good by heart.

[01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:04.110]
Sweet Mary.

[01:21:04.590 --> 01:21:06.470]
I'm so in love with you.

[01:21:06.970 --> 01:21:07.310]
I don't know.

[01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:08.150]
And don't Jerry Garcia.

[01:21:09.190 --> 01:21:09.630]
Mary.

[01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:12.550]
We never part.

[01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:14.510]
So long Mary.

[01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.370]
So good by heart.

[01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.530]
Take a look at that.

[01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:20.750]
Jerry Garcia's got seven votes and Rick Nelson's got a pair.

[01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:22.330]
A small pair.

[01:21:24.450 --> 01:21:26.650]
Does that tell you what this town knows about music?

[01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:28.530]
Does that tell you what America's all about?

[01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:29.890]
Jerry Garcia and the great.

[01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:30.890]
Well then I will say this.

[01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.930]
If it wouldn't have been for them,

[01:21:32.010 --> 01:21:34.650]
we wouldn't have been in juries having so many great ice cream flavors.

[01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.310]
We wouldn't have had no fish food because there wouldn't have been no fish.

[01:21:37.670 --> 01:21:37.950]
Right?

[01:21:38.090 --> 01:21:39.270]
Well they might have named it something else.

[01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:41.310]
We wouldn't have had no cherry.

[01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:42.450]
We wouldn't have had no cherry.

[01:21:42.690 --> 01:21:43.050]
We wouldn't have had no cherry Garcia.

[01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:44.430]
Who wants beetle food?

[01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:44.770]
Ooh.

[01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:46.130]
Just the sounds of that.

[01:21:47.910 --> 01:21:48.570]
Beetle food?

[01:21:49.090 --> 01:21:49.950]
Or something else?

[01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.870]
Like sawdust, you mean?

[01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:53.290]
Two votes.

[01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.550]
I could play all of these songs.

[01:21:55.670 --> 01:21:57.390]
You still won't get them any votes, but I mean...

[01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:59.630]
It's wrong with you people.

[01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:04.950]
Well I've been waiting ever since it.

[01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:07.870]
Guess my face has gotten undisturbed.

[01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:09.510]
Broken heart.

[01:22:09.730 --> 01:22:10.930]
I will say this much though.

[01:22:11.130 --> 01:22:14.130]
See because you'll recall that Ozzy and also being the genius that he wasn't

[01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.470]
doesn't get as much credit now that he's dead.

[01:22:15.670 --> 01:22:16.430]
Anymore when he was alive.

[01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:21.710]
And did the first TV music video, which was Traveling Man with Rick Nelson.

[01:22:22.510 --> 01:22:23.410]
But when it really...

[01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:24.670]
At the end of the show, Rick...

[01:22:24.670 --> 01:22:27.110]
Once he started his musical career at the end of Ozzy and Harry Day,

[01:22:27.170 --> 01:22:28.230]
we'd Rick with Sing a Song.

[01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.030]
He'd be there with a little band and he'd sing the song, whatever his current hit was.

[01:22:31.290 --> 01:22:33.570]
When he really pissed me off was when he did this song.

[01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:39.590]
Because I'm fast-sominal with my favorite then, and it's still one of my favorites today.

[01:22:39.690 --> 01:22:40.910]
And it's just frosted my ass.

[01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:41.410]
Big time.

[01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:43.710]
Give me an arm and love again.

[01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:44.710]
I mean who you kidding man?

[01:22:45.130 --> 01:22:45.810]
No one here is dead.

[01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:49.070]
I mean, I'm not ready.

[01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:52.930]
Not thinking about that.

[01:22:54.450 --> 01:22:54.850]
Well...

[01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.170]
I mean, that's just...

[01:22:59.170 --> 01:23:00.710]
You ain't no fat stomino sweetheart.

[01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:02.010]
You look really good.

[01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:03.150]
You look pretty damn good.

[01:23:03.690 --> 01:23:04.690]
Let's take a look at it.

[01:23:04.990 --> 01:23:07.650]
But I mean, as far as fat stomino, he don't look good at all.

[01:23:08.170 --> 01:23:10.570]
I mean, he is pretty chubby.

[01:23:10.930 --> 01:23:11.450]
Chubby boy.

[01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:13.230]
But what a great singer, huh?

[01:23:13.890 --> 01:23:15.490]
He's still alive so he isn't on our list.

[01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:19.930]
And as a matter of fact, wait till that day when fat stomino meets his Marvin Maker, huh?

[01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:22.030]
And then we'll put him on list and do this poll again.

[01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:26.730]
And if he doesn't get like a whole lot of votes, I'm gonna be really indignant and pissed off that day, more so than usual.

[01:23:27.330 --> 01:23:30.090]
I'm gonna have my ass frosted and put him in Macy's window.

[01:23:31.130 --> 01:23:34.730]
When you be pissed off, fat stomino, in fact when we did the greatest...

[01:23:34.730 --> 01:23:36.890]
Which one we've done so many of these, I can't keep track.

[01:23:37.410 --> 01:23:37.950]
How did he do?

[01:23:38.690 --> 01:23:39.250]
Don't recall.

[01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:43.530]
Erick can look it up in between sandwiches and in between adding more names on list.

[01:23:43.530 --> 01:23:46.650]
Hey, listen, we want to keep Erick busy up there. He's always talking about how busy he is.

[01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:50.530]
Let's put him to the test. He's not too busy to put these names on here and believe you me.

[01:23:51.170 --> 01:23:52.010]
He shouldn't be.

[01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:56.490]
Playing hooky, do remember if you've forgotten voice, Royce Michael Mayo, in his morning's commentary in the Sun Sentinel.

[01:23:57.450 --> 01:24:03.190]
He says, the barflies were sitting around, Danny's last call on Monday, remembering a friend when someone brought up an old joke.

[01:24:03.750 --> 01:24:07.130]
The first thing I do is read the old bits of my names, not there, means I've got to get up.

[01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:10.750]
Getting up never used to be a problem for my cranberry.

[01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:16.590]
When he ruled morning radio in South Florida, he'd set the alarm clock for 3am, springing out of bed before the backup went off at 3.30.

[01:24:16.830 --> 01:24:20.490]
Then he'd be off to the WIOD studios where he'd make waking up easier for the rest of us.

[01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:26.710]
The old bits didn't do him justice. He died January 3rd at age 60, a forgotten voice relegated to the fringes.

[01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:30.810]
The Harold gave him 229 words, the Sun Sentinel 300.

[01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:38.330]
Even the newspaper in Cleveland where he had his first big success, did better with 462 words, too bad the plain dealer couldn't spell his name right.

[01:24:39.150 --> 01:24:42.490]
A great guy, a generous guy, said Barron or Dan Chichester.

[01:24:43.230 --> 01:24:44.330]
Remember he used to talk about him?

[01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:45.870]
No, I do.

[01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.550]
Anything anybody asked, he was there. He was a very funny guy, but not ha-ha funny.

[01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:53.370]
A sumer was a sarcastic, dry, subtle kind, and he wasn't afraid to have a cocktail.

[01:24:54.670 --> 01:24:59.190]
A Minerie's last stop at WJNA launched a crusade to create a summer holiday called Hookie Day.

[01:24:59.910 --> 01:25:04.510]
His listeners met him at Captain Jack's Ocean Frontiki Bar and Pulp at a beach, and they drank the morning away.

[01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:12.530]
We're doing this because August doesn't have any holidays when he explained in 2000, I figured two or three years Maxwell had this declared legal holiday, and everybody will get the day off.

[01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:19.650]
Winnerie wasn't an international pop star like Morris Gibbs who was death-din-rate front page coverage, even in the region where he worked for 27 years.

[01:25:20.150 --> 01:25:25.730]
He was just a solid guy who did a lot for the community, he raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for local boys and girls clubs.

[01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:32.770]
In Cleveland he organized Winnerie's Raiders volunteers who cleaned up public parks, and he co-founded shoes for kids which collect sneakers for poor kids.

[01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:39.350]
Winnerie spent 17 years at WIOD, the station at Launchler at Kings Career, and was a former home to Neil Rogers and Hagelberg.

[01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:46.090]
The station rewarded him by firing him in 1993, said he wasn't attracting enough young listeners, wouldn't even allow him a farewell show.

[01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:52.890]
Even as Winnerie bounced around the soft-loaded dial, leasing his own time over the past decade, he maintained the loyal core of listeners.

[01:25:53.370 --> 01:26:01.130]
The Chichester was one of them. Their friendship was born 25 years ago when Chichester owned several restaurants and sent Winnerie a case of Smurna vodka for his 35th birthday.

[01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:07.290]
Winnerie repaid the favor a few years later by showing up on Chichester's law at 6am, with the Croll Springs High School Marching Band.

[01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:17.090]
It was my 40th birthday, Chichester, said I knew something was up when I heard the dog making funny noises. I opened the door and there's a 100-piece band playing the Star Spangled Banner, and there's Mike with his headphones on, broadcasting.

[01:26:17.690 --> 01:26:20.730]
He said Danny, we put four cases of champagne and I so we can make a party of it.

[01:26:21.330 --> 01:26:33.370]
Now Chichester is tining a party and fundraiser in his old friend's memory. It'll be February 20th from 5 to 10pm at his new bar in Fort Lauderdale, 33-55 Northeast, 33rd Street, a $20 check to the Boys and Girls Club gets you all the chicken and ribs you can eat.

[01:26:33.930 --> 01:26:38.010]
He knew Winnerie hadn't been well for the past year, figured it was serious when Winnerie gave up the booze.

[01:26:38.450 --> 01:26:46.250]
Winnerie was a less frequent part of the Breakfast Club friends who would eat and drink after Winnerie's show. Winnerie stopped by Chichester's new bar in early December. There was something wrong with his throat.

[01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:53.750]
He said something about a tumor a few weeks later he was gone dead after surgery. Every day at somebody else at Chichester you can hardly walk because of neuropathy.

[01:26:54.090 --> 01:26:58.890]
I just wanted to do something for him to try to raise a few more grand for the Boys and Girls Club. I think he would have liked that he had a heart of gold.

[01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:03.790]
Nice going there Mike Mayo, at least you made an attempt. People as it was, at least you made an attempt.

[01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:16.230]
And the main point in there was here is a guy who did a lot for the community, raised a lot of money, was a fixture for almost 30 years and he gets 300 words in a goddamn sun sentinel and 229 in a herald and is buried back on the obits page.

[01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:28.450]
Tom Jic of course being too busy. He's out there in Hollywood again for the 500th time this year already in so they January being wind and dying to write those puff pieces about the stupid ass network shows and a bunch of crap.

[01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:34.310]
He's one of the evil doers terrible Tommy. He used to be a good guy but he's turned into an evil doer.

[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:40.730]
Tragic. I wonder if Tom Jic will write anything when he gets back to town when he excuse me then George.

[01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:52.690]
Will the old news you think is that going to be the excuse? Sure that sounds good. Yeah. We hate you Tom. Don't take it personal but we hate you like poison just like Hank hates Mo.

[01:27:55.030 --> 01:28:03.990]
20 to 11 at 560 WQAM. Yay. Ever been presented with an opportunity when you should have or what had done something but you just passed on it and do the right thing.

[01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:12.690]

I'll tell you the guy was scary. Hold those eyes. He looked like he could suck the urine out of your bladder with the power of his mind alone.

[01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:50.650]
Bobby Lardman was a roadie for Gary Newman during his heyday. After every show he thought she's it's too weird. He like unzipped his skin and there was this spindly-ass glowing alien from like close encounters. I sh**t my pants. I'm not ashamed to say it.

[01:29:50.650 --> 01:30:01.890]
In 1980, BBC rock critic Edward Upper Glass was sent to interview Gary Newman. He has never returned but an audio tape was mysteriously delivered to BBC headquarters in London days later.

[01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:29.350]
Gary, who are your musical influences? Are you bleeding? Kidding me? No!

[01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:43.110]
Gary Newman, think about it. You never see him and a being from outer space in the same photograph together. It's a big juicy, stopping wet look at show business tonight on inside of a hind.

[01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:57.650]
Maybe he was a really an actor. It's 10-47 at 5-60 W.Q.A.M. So Eric faxes me a pool that we did back on sometime. I don't know when he'll us was. But anyway, we did a pool we asked which of these songs you liked the best we had. 1894 votes.

[01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:11.770]
Man, it must have been a weekend pool. I'm assuming. And I was American Pie wanted. Why did he fax me this? Because I asked how fat stomino did. Right, he faxed you the two categories that he was in on poles that you did.

[01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:40.290]
Aha! Okay. Well, here's Harry Reem's biography. Anybody interested? No. Get him a body cut. American Pie won 243 Lila. Own over Lonely Heart by Yes. Are you kidding me? Own over Lonely Heart? It was okay. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, Stevie Ray Vaughan, no. Some of these facts that I'm a far less today. No. Also, Joe Strummer. No. The answer is no.

[01:31:40.750 --> 01:32:10.270]
But thanks for the suggestions. Anyway, fat stomino is on here was a blueberry hill was 29th. Had 21 votes. I mean, owner of a lonely heart pizza of great balls of fire. Dear God by STC. Why did we put that on there even? I don't think I was here for that. I mean, we like it. But why did we put that you weren't here for that? Higher and higher by Jackie Wilson. Don't even it's over crowded house. Oh, I see. I see. I don't see. I don't see.

[01:32:11.490 --> 01:32:40.250]
Oh, and then there was the other one the best male recording artist. Here we go. Roy Orbison 147 Ellis had 141. Isn't that pleasing to you? That's pleasing to me. Steve Tyler only 37. Freddie Mercury had 110. J Black 14. Where's fat stomino? I had only seven. He's in such a different genre. You know, he's just such a whole different thing. There's your thing he's got like a different thing. I ain't seen it. And I really don't want to. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10,

[01:32:40.250 --> 01:33:10.030]
o, m 5, 6, p, o, m E, h e, e, t, t, and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes ma'am you know you took the 40, not the number of words that theI obituary's lists for names, and I'm not sure that the cause of it. Everybody's aware of it-, the newapers charge you for those words. The families. Your- I had no idea. 다음 content biliary. No, no, wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait.

[01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:16.410]
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but the fact is this was not a regular obituaries like a news story on the old bit page

[01:33:17.470 --> 01:33:24.070]
Well, it yeah, but you know, they take every opportunity to make money anyway. They can that's outrageous

[01:33:25.870 --> 01:33:27.290]
They charge me

[01:33:27.290 --> 01:33:29.650]
$800 for an obituary for my son

[01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:35.130]
Oh my gosh, and and then they used it in the Spanish paper as

[01:33:35.670 --> 01:33:37.130]
information it was a

[01:33:37.130 --> 01:33:39.030]
Suicide and

[01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.850]
They took every opportunity to sell papers and

[01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:49.410]
They're still filling me for that. I mean it's ridiculous. I can't believe that they touched that amount of money

[01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:57.950]
800 bucks to publish an obituary and the other five I would send it back to him and say good luck to you

[01:33:57.950 --> 01:34:00.030]
Fighting it good for you

[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:05.770]
Yeah, anyway, I just want to let you know. Okay, thanks. I'm sorry. Okay

[01:34:06.210 --> 01:34:08.730]
5 6 7 depressing 5 6 7 0 5 6

[01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:12.430]
10 5 6 the only 18 T and T and for eyes were as well. You give me a look like that

[01:34:13.170 --> 01:34:17.070]
Now see the stories that Mike Mayo was referencing weren't you know the regular

[01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:22.850]
Bitter is what he's talking about the like these were all of this these were printed as news stories because he was a celebrity

[01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:28.450]
But the point that Mike was making was then and accurately so because he's ripping it off from what I said is that

[01:34:28.450 --> 01:34:31.050]
Here's I'm not gonna go through it again. If that's the case

[01:34:31.050 --> 01:34:33.170]
Why would anybody have an obituary printed?

[01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:39.410]
The people that need to know are gonna know well, I'll tell you one thing my father's obituary was like very very short just a few words

[01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:42.210]
Just a handful of words

[01:34:43.930 --> 01:34:48.310]
In fact, there were only two words that I saw in a story that I satisfied me

[01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:52.930]
Yeah, that was enough for me. I don't have to read the obit page anymore 5 6

[01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:56.730]
You I told you that before and I was a truth both newspapers

[01:34:56.730 --> 01:35:00.990]
That was the first thing I looked at every single day for years and then finally I'm up and through honor

[01:35:00.990 --> 01:35:05.210]
I get a phone call. I guess what your father died and I said oh right now. Okay, I don't have to read the obits

[01:35:05.210 --> 01:35:10.650]
And I never understood the issue before then I heard him call a talk show once really. Yeah, did you really yeah?

[01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:13.010]
Exactly

[01:35:13.930 --> 01:35:18.110]
Here's for a lot of deal hello Neil. Yes, sir. Okay on Sunday

[01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:23.190]
Mad listening to magic and they said they were gonna play a bunch of songs for the bg's for Maurice Gibbs

[01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:24.770]
Right, I didn't even get to hear them

[01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:26.510]
But I went and said 11 came back outside

[01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:28.590]
Magic again. What was the first song that's laid?

[01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:29.970]
Building a butter oh

[01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:37.590]
You see I wasn't exaggerating I'm not be somebody over there must have a fetish on that song

[01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:40.190]
How about two names Frankie Lyman and Mama Cass?

[01:35:40.730 --> 01:35:42.410]
Well, those are the marginal ones

[01:35:43.810 --> 01:35:44.530]
Okay, thanks

[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:50.590]
What about Mama Cass Frankie Lyman is not gonna go under bokeh Brian would vote for right?

[01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:54.230]
I mean Frankie Lyman was okay. In fact, I have that many disc. It's got all the stuff on here

[01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:56.710]
Of course we can't play because we don't got no many display in here anymore

[01:35:58.370 --> 01:36:02.570]
It's being it's being thickest. Yeah, as soon as I leave it'll be you know, it'll be back

[01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:06.030]
But mama Cass, what do you think? No?

[01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:08.310]
Well, you got so many people that have died

[01:36:10.190 --> 01:36:11.230]
Hard to rate

[01:36:14.570 --> 01:36:17.330]
Right I mean she was all right. She was fat

[01:36:18.670 --> 01:36:23.590]
Loved her now what she choked on a sandwich or something. I think they just made that sort of like Muriel Lonza

[01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:28.290]
Choked on the sandwich. She grabbed on it. She choked on her fat very good the way to put it

[01:36:28.290 --> 01:36:33.230]
She was big and fat. We don't have a lot of sympathy on the show for big fat people of croque over their own fat

[01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:37.570]
Now if I was skinny, I mean then I would have no credibility, but I'm fat myself

[01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:42.930]
Does that make any sense? No, no again graded on the QA curve

[01:36:43.370 --> 01:36:46.790]
Although I do have great circulation in my feet my good podifers told me that yesterday

[01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:49.890]
Thanks to remember my podifers friend said I have great circulation

[01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:54.090]
In fact, I checked the herald circulation. I got a bigger one than they got

[01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:59.910]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. Oh, we hate you with the hero by the way. Can't stand you

[01:36:59.910 --> 01:37:02.930]
pound 5 60 on the 18 T and T and Verizon wireless line

[01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:05.850]
We do like Mike Mayo personally. He's not a bad guy, but his columns

[01:37:06.530 --> 01:37:10.950]
Generally blow all of the winery won. Thank you Mike. Thank you for at least being one voice

[01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:12.950]
Even though it was very very very lame

[01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:17.730]
But at least being one voice to make the point of this guy after all he did and raised the money was a pretty good guy

[01:37:18.190 --> 01:37:24.290]
Deserved a little bit better, but this time like I've told you it's unyielding man. They give you nothing back nothing back

[01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:30.330]
Just like just like a couple of months ago when there were a bunch of assholes trying to like drum me off the ear and get all whipped up

[01:37:30.330 --> 01:37:35.370]
The Fox News thing anybody in this town even write about it. Did they even recognize it? No? No?

[01:37:35.650 --> 01:37:37.450]

Oh, I sure hope it doesn't sound like the last show he did at the AAA arena remember that sound like he was talking through a through a tin horn

[01:43:38.590 --> 01:43:39.890]
Then we got the big

[01:43:40.770 --> 01:43:44.350]
He's doing a show at the senior bowl at seven o'clock, which we didn't even know there was a senior

[01:43:44.350 --> 01:43:44.930]
I guess I did

[01:43:45.410 --> 01:43:48.070]
And then a tent at 80k from GA with all that gambling stuff

[01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:49.470]
Joe and Mark overnight to talk about

[01:43:49.470 --> 01:43:51.850]
Pompano Park and how they can't talk about it

[01:43:51.850 --> 01:43:53.710]
Do we ever find out what that was all about?

[01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:56.110]
It was better fact. This Joanne denial as he denied man

[01:43:56.110 --> 01:44:01.390]
And we like Joe a lot Joe Castello, but he's lately. I think since that wedding a little strange, you know

[01:44:01.390 --> 01:44:03.750]
A little bit on the strain side

[01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:08.670]
Here is Greg's facts for today yesterday's facts was so good. I don't think he can outdo it

[01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:13.330]
He's really moved up in our estimation light years. Hasn't it even you are saying you know? Sure

[01:44:14.570 --> 01:44:15.230]
No, you're not

[01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:17.410]
Well, it doesn't bug me like he bugs you

[01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:20.650]
No, because he doesn't have a fetish for you. He's got to write anyway

[01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:25.470]
It says I don't care what the final results of his pull are the best thing you ever did alive is Jim Morrison

[01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:29.170]
See now he's sucking up to me just like Moe is trying hey, we're monitoring you Moe

[01:44:29.770 --> 01:44:32.550]
I hear all that sucking around. I'll always stop doing that for a few days

[01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:36.070]
Since I told him to blow it out his old ass

[01:44:36.630 --> 01:44:39.450]
It says the doors are a group that were way before their time

[01:44:39.450 --> 01:44:43.350]
If the same group had come out today they would have dominated even more than they did in the 60s

[01:44:43.350 --> 01:44:48.330]
Also, I'm not sure you agree, but I happen to think the doors the movie is absolutely incredible

[01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:52.410]
Val Kilmer did a dead-on Jim who could have done better

[01:44:53.290 --> 01:44:57.090]
Except maybe what's his name does the news and I would be my former producer that nitwit

[01:44:57.650 --> 01:45:00.670]
John Leavitt who used to travel with the doors

[01:45:01.650 --> 01:45:03.950]
And then he used to slam doors in his face is what I'm hearing

[01:45:04.530 --> 01:45:05.250]
John Leavitt

[01:45:05.250 --> 01:45:10.850]
I heard him also when I was listening to that spooky guy that guy with a ghost on iod last night. What's his name?

[01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:13.870]
I don't know you told you told me before

[01:45:13.870 --> 01:45:18.170]
Carlos that came from him, but anyway, uh, and I heard the newscast there was John

[01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:23.810]
Leavitt my friends in the Jewish community and my friends in the light and community. Oh get out of here John

[01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.450]
man

[01:45:25.930 --> 01:45:30.530]
Anyway, it says I've seen that movie hundreds of times and guard that DVD with my life's Greg

[01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:35.570]
He's seen the movie hundreds of time even the godfather and network as many times I've seen those movies

[01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:37.890]
I certainly couldn't say I've seen them hundreds of times

[01:45:37.890 --> 01:45:44.210]
I would say that anybody who has seen any movie except maybe Debbie does Dallas a hundreds of times has some kind of neurotic problem

[01:45:44.210 --> 01:45:45.430]
I'm sorry Greg

[01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:50.650]
It says they're the only music from the 60s that I love see well. There's more problems see what I'm saying

[01:45:51.730 --> 01:45:57.050]
You probably don't remember what I sang a song parody on your show spelled P-I-P-A-R-I-T-Y

[01:45:57.050 --> 01:46:03.610]
See parody is what we have in the national football league all mediocre teams parody is P-A-R-O-D-Y

[01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:07.450]
See you learned something already dig Greg not parody, but parody if you got it

[01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:12.450]
Oh, I sang a song parody on your show about seven or eight years ago using light my firetattled Shula time to retire

[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:14.570]
Remember that? Yeah, no no

[01:46:15.230 --> 01:46:19.470]
P.S. it would make my day if you could do it your Ross Perot impression, please no

[01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:25.190]
Today's Greg and uh, you know like I told you I knew one of these good as yesterday because yesterday's was his close to perfection

[01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:29.150]
And was good timing to run on the hills of Morris Gibb passing away

[01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:33.730]
So today naturally you don't want to do too good because then I have to live up to that every single day

[01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:41.630]
56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Here's a call from Davy hello

[01:46:43.650 --> 01:46:44.050]
Davy

[01:46:45.170 --> 01:46:48.110]
Is gone. Okay, so that leaves us with one call on the board

[01:46:48.910 --> 01:46:51.810]
What a nasty kettle of fish we got here now, you know what?

[01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.410]
You

[01:46:54.410 --> 01:46:59.670]
Last call is from Miami. Hello. Hello. Neil. Yes. What about Kurt Cobain? He's on there

[01:46:59.670 --> 01:47:03.350]
What do you know there? Well, wait a minute. Maybe now let me check see on his

[01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:04.530]
I'm gonna put him on

[01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:08.870]
Let's say Kurt Cobain. There he has got eight votes. Hey votes

[01:47:10.110 --> 01:47:14.030]
Okay, also about the bg's. I mean, I'm not a big fan of the bg's

[01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:18.650]
I mean, it just bothers me the way the guy sings like a like a white woman with that high pitch voice, right?

[01:47:19.330 --> 01:47:20.630]
I mean, I have a falsetto

[01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:27.730]
Is that a woman? Yeah, and after Dennis Schraublin. Yeah, I mean, I can take her lever

[01:47:27.730 --> 01:47:32.250]
But for the most part, I don't think it's about her voice. I mean if you want to listen to somebody just for the voice

[01:47:32.250 --> 01:47:37.490]
Very polished. I mean, you might as well listen to Julianne Drew's. It's about what you know the the rawness

[01:47:37.490 --> 01:47:42.270]
You know the rawness. Yeah, the rawness edging is a lack of production

[01:47:42.270 --> 01:47:46.610]
I mean sometimes you can have like an open source somewhere in your body and it's really raw

[01:47:46.610 --> 01:47:48.610]
But you don't enjoy the rawness. I mean, like you

[01:47:49.050 --> 01:47:51.390]
Unless you're doing that even as far as the doorboard goes

[01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:58.530]
I mean most of the artists on the doorboard are probably you know crappy over polished pop stars like you know the boy bands and all that crap right and

[01:47:58.530 --> 01:48:00.510]
I like like O-town. Oh

[01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:05.490]
Exactly, and I mean, I think George knows a most of the good music out there doesn't even make it to the top

[01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:10.370]
Of the charge at all. Yeah, so you know, that's like so so what are you trying to say that?

[01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:15.010]
Janice Schraublin was great because she was like yeah like that. Yeah, I mean, I don't I don't need to listen to them

[01:48:15.010 --> 01:48:20.390]
Like I think you have to be really strong. They're really drunk to really listen to her now. You're getting warmer. Okay. Now. Yeah

[01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:24.970]
You got your thumb right on it. I'll admit it, but I mean as far as I mean, I think she's a lot better than that

[01:48:24.970 --> 01:48:32.370]
You know, Brittany bitch or you know, well now you're talking last time power, you know, mm-hmm. All right, Neil. Love you. Thank you

[01:48:32.990 --> 01:48:36.050]
There you go. He made a couple of good points there. I'm already not sure what they were but

[01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:42.190]
He said Janice Schraublin was great and if she came door to door selling as the A-bond lady he'd open it wide in the door too

[01:48:42.670 --> 01:48:45.690]
And then kick her ass out. Well, yeah, maybe he never saw her

[01:48:46.110 --> 01:48:48.930]
You seen her. Oh, yeah, man

[01:48:49.410 --> 01:48:50.710]
He made Doreen look good

[01:48:51.650 --> 01:48:58.910]
5 6 7 0 5 well 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the 18 just a joke Doreen just relax back there

[01:48:58.910 --> 01:49:01.750]
Where would I have you are in a building? I have no idea where anybody isn't a building now

[01:49:01.750 --> 01:49:04.190]
You know what just as well probably just as well

[01:49:04.190 --> 01:49:08.670]
I know where the sales holes are way back there that way everything is that and for PD Lenny's saying to me this morning

[01:49:08.670 --> 01:49:12.350]
Have you met the new sales guy yet boy waiting to meet this fruit cake, you know that stuff

[01:49:12.810 --> 01:49:15.190]
He's talking about other sales people PD Lenny

[01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:21.450]
Boy, do you see that routine he went through getting on a scale here? Do you see that routine? No

[01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:23.850]
Took off his jacket took out his

[01:49:23.850 --> 01:49:28.810]
Keys took out his wallet laid it on the table over there weight about 45 pounds the wallet

[01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:32.950]
Then he goes over there. I'm doing great. I'm doing great way. I 82 pounds soaking wet

[01:49:33.750 --> 01:49:34.870]
He's red rough and sore

[01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:36.530]
I

[01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:38.730]
Get red rough and sore just seeing him waddle in there in the morning

[01:49:38.730 --> 01:49:42.930]
He just that's one of the things about not being here. That's the best that is the best

[01:49:42.930 --> 01:49:47.530]
Not having to lay my eyes on PD Lenny. It just makes me feel like a real human being

[01:49:48.670 --> 01:49:51.690]
So he doesn't like to be Jesus because they're muted well. I mentioned that yesterday

[01:49:52.590 --> 01:49:55.930]
That it wasn't exactly what you called your macho group, but in spite of that sir

[01:49:55.930 --> 01:50:00.530]
I will say this in our poll which we got a pretty good bunch of macho guys out there at least for your forum

[01:50:00.990 --> 01:50:02.030]
They did very well

[01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:03.790]
Didn't you didn't you think they did better than

[01:50:04.450 --> 01:50:05.990]
expected better than expected right

[01:50:06.470 --> 01:50:10.630]
Especially with the sour ass hateful audience we got a people or and didn't that guy say that it was very

[01:50:10.630 --> 01:50:14.590]
Negatory that phony shrink the quality of the day right starting up his crap again

[01:50:16.290 --> 01:50:21.290]
It's negative when we want to feed negative when we want to feed positive like about the bg's it was mostly positive

[01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:24.130]
So there you go. It's the in and the yang that's the way life really is sir

[01:50:24.130 --> 01:50:29.930]
This isn't one of those like hearts and flowers shows where we try to like smooth everything over like you know like Jonathan Edward

[01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:32.170]
Paula crap

[01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:38.770]
Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, what's up there chief. Yes, sir. How about DJ Jam master J

[01:50:39.490 --> 01:50:40.390]
Oh, yeah

[01:50:41.650 --> 01:50:43.250]
No no chance

[01:50:43.930 --> 01:50:48.710]
He didn't collaborate with our Smith and rekindle their uh their uh

[01:50:48.710 --> 01:50:49.310]
uh career

[01:50:49.930 --> 01:50:51.670]
He regained rekindled their career

[01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:58.050]
No, no, he did not rekindle their career

[01:50:58.410 --> 01:51:03.910]
I think so I think that he rekindled did you hear that he rekindled aro smith's career

[01:51:04.690 --> 01:51:07.510]
I think this guy's maybe a little jaded in his view, don't you

[01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:13.010]
Aerospace has been hot again. What was the movie that they did the theme from and that's I mean, it's just one

[01:51:13.470 --> 01:51:17.790]
I just mentioned that in passing the uh Apollo the astronaut movie. I would uh Apollo

[01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:21.390]
Whatever the hell was they know what are they are we getting something like that

[01:51:22.290 --> 01:51:22.830]
I'm again

[01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:27.250]
Rekindle aro smith's career sure I've heard a lot of

[01:51:27.250 --> 01:51:31.410]
He's talking about the run DMC thing but that came from steve tyler himself

[01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.750]
Yeah

[01:51:34.410 --> 01:51:39.850]
That they were basically done until uh that phone call came in yeah

[01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:42.410]
Well, I told him they rekindled his career

[01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:47.850]
steve tyler but was was that the guy that died does he even have the right guy?

[01:51:48.010 --> 01:51:51.950]
I had yeah, that's the one that just died here a couple of weeks ago he died

[01:51:52.630 --> 01:51:52.990]
Exactly

[01:51:53.670 --> 01:51:55.430]
I mean in fact it was like a couple of months ago

[01:51:55.430 --> 01:52:00.850]
I'm sorry. Do you know if you remember people calling him we're correcting us on which uh, I can't keep track of all these rappers man

[01:52:00.850 --> 01:52:05.830]
I can't keep track of the rappers. It's like having 600 various candy bars assorted in your on the floor

[01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:09.730]
And then you try to like keep track of the rappers. You just can't do it

[01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:13.290]
Although I do like a Clark bar being on them. They still make those I think so

[01:52:13.690 --> 01:52:15.690]
He ever had a Clark bar sure. Oh

[01:52:16.270 --> 01:52:20.210]
I don't know what it is about a Clark bar, but I sure do like a Clark bar still like the heat bars better

[01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:24.810]
Yeah, and the escort. Oh everybody likes to score

[01:52:26.230 --> 01:52:28.170]
Man and what's really the difference

[01:52:28.990 --> 01:52:33.010]
Let's get 50 of men here tomorrow and uh, I'll eat 20 of each and you'll eat like huh

[01:52:33.530 --> 01:52:36.910]
And then they'll carry me out of here right we'll have the end we can take the poll

[01:52:36.910 --> 01:52:39.830]
The best dead of the torture who could just die today on here

[01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:45.490]
Man, I do like a good heat bar and a score bar and they're the real thin and there's not much to them

[01:52:45.490 --> 01:52:50.150]
So even though they're just pure sugar. It's like it would be like taking and injecting liquid sugar into your veins

[01:52:51.090 --> 01:52:55.250]
They're so pure sugar, but they don't satisfy you because they're so small

[01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.970]
Right

[01:52:58.470 --> 01:53:01.630]
Now somebody brought home the obey from Doris market a chocolate canole

[01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:09.230]
That was just sitting there on a counter like again like like the cheese in the trap eight didn't eat it didn't I I looked at it

[01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:11.570]
I looked at it and I said oh

[01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:13.890]
Man didn't touch it though

[01:53:14.450 --> 01:53:18.430]
Good well. No, I take that back. I did like Connie didn't and godfather three

[01:53:18.890 --> 01:53:22.670]
Remember the light wall a little light. Oh you have some you're so skinny and I

[01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:26.530]
Permanent little and you know something just that little tiny bit

[01:53:27.090 --> 01:53:29.330]
I could tell that it was 400% sugar sure

[01:53:29.890 --> 01:53:33.090]
If I were to eat that whole thing my blood sugar would have been 45,000

[01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:39.590]
12 minutes after 11 at 560 wq a lot of dead recording artists out there a lot of people dying lately

[01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:43.570]
And then of course we got the president who wants to see a lot more people dying as soon as possible

[01:53:44.110 --> 01:53:46.070]
Anyway, if you're dying because you're too fat

[01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:51.050]
There's a place called the Lice of West Boca that's dedicated to help you stay on your diet whatever it might be

[01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:11.770]
See and we didn't ask who the best ah

[01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:15.010]
We didn't ask for the best I purposely did that

[01:57:15.970 --> 01:57:20.210]
We asked who's your favorite which doesn't mean that they're necessarily the best for example

[01:57:20.210 --> 01:57:22.390]
Like I think that the Jim uh Marvin gay

[01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:27.670]
Was better than some of these other ones above him but not necessarily somebody's favorite

[01:57:28.210 --> 01:57:30.590]
Thought I'm saying does that make any sense maybe a little bit

[01:57:31.590 --> 01:57:32.490]
There's a difference

[01:57:33.690 --> 01:57:38.010]
Uh, it's not like food if you were to say what's what's your favorite flavor of ice cream

[01:57:38.710 --> 01:57:40.810]
Then that would be the one you think is the best

[01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:43.490]

This is great. Oh, he's one of many people who wants to have a conversation with me off the air now

[02:02:26.230 --> 02:02:30.410]
We advise you George having a conversation with anybody on here. I immediately throw rocks through the window

[02:02:30.410 --> 02:02:33.490]
Explain that on the air a lot. This is a talk show of hand

[02:02:33.490 --> 02:02:37.110]
The only people supposed to crawl in are either rumour or people who have something to say to me

[02:02:37.110 --> 02:02:40.870]
He's the guy that calls up and says I don't really want to go on the air but and that's not

[02:02:41.730 --> 02:02:43.810]

[02:03:02.270 --> 02:03:06.690]
But but still that wasn't that album. I had nothing to do with the song that I keep thinking in which I'll play in a minute

[02:03:06.690 --> 02:03:12.090]
It's live at the rocks here something. I you know, I'm sure that song is like a takeoff. I don't know

[02:03:12.670 --> 02:03:15.750]
Maybe I could be wrong but nobody it's a parody on something

[02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:22.490]
PS George I dedicate the song who are you by the who to you because you're so phony with your split personality

[02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:28.230]
Take care Arnold. I guess I guess he's saying take care to me because it says you're on the top. It doesn't mean you take care

[02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:34.030]
He's thinking in your case take a good. See I already did this morning is what the report was and it was great

Just like our good friend Sonny from the market used to say we're here not for a long time, but for a good time

[02:03:56.150 --> 02:03:58.670]
And that's what we're having today a wonderful time

[02:05:12.470 --> 02:05:16.390]
Not a lot of people like Martha my dear. Why not? I don't know. It's what's wrong with Martha my dear

[02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:23.290]
Well, you know something tough crap. I think if you don't like Martha my dear. You're probably a communist infiltrator. We're gonna deport you immediately

[02:05:24.590 --> 02:05:28.830]
In fact on the next census what they're gonna do is put a little question on the bottom. They're gonna a little trap

[02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:34.690]
How much do you like Martha my dear by the Beatles and if it isn't like at least a nine on a scale of ten

[02:05:34.690 --> 02:05:39.250]
They're gonna come and take your ass and put you on a rubber raft and get your ass out of here and I say more power to them

[02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:43.010]
Because that's the kind of government we're dealing with now. Yes, you bet

Hey, another year is coming gone. It's the new year and if you want a new you and a new house new looking house

[02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:56.090]
It's a drive concepts. I've been using them in my house for over 20 years

[02:05:56.090 --> 02:06:01.530]
So it's the voice of experience telling you especially. I've seen the job they've done in my mother's house and all over the place

[02:06:01.530 --> 02:06:04.950]
Not just in my place that when they finish cleaning your carpets

[02:06:04.950 --> 02:06:09.230]
It'll look just like you had brand new late in the floor all your friends and family they'll think boy

And now another additional

[02:07:20.130 --> 02:07:21.490]
What is

[02:07:22.630 --> 02:07:27.430]
Today what if Janice Joplin were an Ava and the lady

[02:07:30.630 --> 02:07:33.150]
Yes, may I help you

[02:07:47.750 --> 02:07:53.770]
Julian next time to find out what would happen is Nancy Reagan lost weight

[02:07:53.770 --> 02:07:59.910]
This bulletin just and it appears that the first lady has disappeared. We're next we ask

[02:07:59.910 --> 02:08:00.730]
What

[02:08:02.270 --> 02:08:06.110]
A perfect cross-brings didn't happen with your decision on mama caz

[02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:12.850]
He says what about the sandwich eating mama caz and also steve you steve you rave on they won't let steve you rave on alone

[02:08:12.850 --> 02:08:14.490]
I didn't I tended at

[02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:19.770]
Erosmith's career was revitalized by run DMC. I thought it was steve you rave on the steve you rave on

[02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:23.630]
Revitalized mama caz's career by yankin at sandwich out of her throat

[02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:27.730]
Yeah, he reached right in there and yanked it out and the sandwich too

[02:08:27.730 --> 02:08:30.510]
So there you go. Okay. Oh, yeah

[02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:35.430]
What am I gonna tell you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18t

[02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:40.410]
We got an alert by the way for phony votes alert on Jimmy Hendrix after we had a little thing

[02:08:40.410 --> 02:08:44.010]
And I looked it up in the book we had a Jimmy Hendrix uh flurry there at experience

[02:08:44.010 --> 02:08:49.930]
Yeah, Jimmy Hendrix experience and I think Jimmy Hendrix is getting a big big buzzer in the skies what he's getting from us

[02:08:50.590 --> 02:08:55.950]
Because John Lennon's got 83 and Jimmy Hendrix all of a sudden out of nowhere's got 70 anybody buying that no way

[02:08:57.450 --> 02:09:01.310]
That's all the people out there still do an magic mushrooms that they had shipped in from Amsterdam

[02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:07.690]
Jackie Wilson's on a pool. I don't have any yet. He'll get some five hundred and twelve votes already and most of them seem to be real

[02:09:08.130 --> 02:09:12.310]
Couple of odysreading a pair patty Klein for Janice Chaplin

[02:09:12.770 --> 02:09:17.390]
Rick Nelson and buddy Holly five see that that's just do you realize how ridiculous that is

[02:09:18.230 --> 02:09:21.090]
That Janice Japlin is tied with Rick Nelson and buddy Holly

[02:09:22.090 --> 02:09:23.730]
I mean, it's just outrageous

[02:09:23.730 --> 02:09:27.110]
buddy Holly who wasn't around that long because he died in that plane crash

[02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:29.210]
But he was considered to be one of the early

[02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:32.990]
Pioneers indeed kind of like they be crockered Daniel Boone

[02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:37.790]
Think he came from the same town, but I'm sure you must have had many an argument

[02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:41.370]
And I'd like to point out by the way Elvis Presley's not from Tennessee is from Tuplo, Mississippi

[02:09:41.370 --> 02:09:47.370]
I just mentioned that for the idiots there on the VH1. Oh, anyway, I had arguments about what Janice Chaplin

[02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:52.750]
People argue that point with you all the time. What point you mean the one that the guy said up and then they say oh no

[02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:53.690]
She was great no

[02:09:55.030 --> 02:10:03.990]
All the time really oh she was great great what a great singer a great performer on the same people say that who said the Bruce Springsteen is a singer

[02:10:04.770 --> 02:10:08.110]
Not just a great the fact that they say he's a singer at all. I find very amusing

[02:10:09.090 --> 02:10:10.610]
Couldn't sing as well of a paper sack

[02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:17.390]
And to watch him exploit the tragedy of 9-11 the way he's done and waving the American flag and go through this whole dog and pony show

[02:10:17.390 --> 02:10:22.090]
To try to revive a flagging career if I can use that word just really pisses me off

[02:10:22.090 --> 02:10:23.930]
Bruce Freak and Springsteen

[02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:28.010]
I think he's been blinded by his blight if you ask me

[02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:35.210]
He couldn't lick manford man's ass Irish spring asses. I was just thinking about. Oh Irish Springstees that on here

[02:10:35.210 --> 02:10:37.650]
I think it's ACN. Oh, oh, it's in the thing

[02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:39.070]
It's in your thing

[02:10:39.590 --> 02:10:45.190]
Anyway, the fact that Rick Nelson and the buddy holly have to be saddled with Janice Joplin who's going door to door trying to sell

[02:10:45.190 --> 02:10:49.350]
personal care products to Carlos so we can do sh in the shower in the abat

[02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:54.530]
Seriously, you should see when I want to take a leak a 25 I'll never forget it

[02:10:55.010 --> 02:11:01.730]
And he's got like all these all style the stuff around like he's in home some people bathe before they leave in the morning

[02:11:01.730 --> 02:11:03.250]
Yeah, that's really a good idea at moment

[02:11:03.250 --> 02:11:04.490]
He doesn't have a tub at the house

[02:11:04.490 --> 02:11:09.610]
What is he doing water? We know if he lives like in a place in his car. I think does he live in his car?

[02:11:10.090 --> 02:11:12.430]
Does he have a car he has a car?

[02:11:12.490 --> 02:11:14.170]
Oh, what kind of car does he have?

[02:11:15.610 --> 02:11:16.310]
Little one

[02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:21.150]
Uh, he has a little over at Nelson just moved ahead of Janice Joplin. Thank you whoever did that

[02:11:21.150 --> 02:11:23.850]
Thank you very much if I had a prize to send you. I do we have nothing

[02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:28.530]
Harry Chapin eight George Harrison's out only nine George Harrison's got only nine

[02:11:28.530 --> 02:11:30.890]
What's wrong with you people he died not that long ago

[02:11:31.430 --> 02:11:34.650]
Even if we only wanted to vote on like my sweet lord and uh

[02:11:35.410 --> 02:11:36.790]
What's the other one they would I love?

[02:11:39.130 --> 02:11:46.210]
George Harrison saw the George Martin thing got my mindset on you. Okay, very good. Oh, very good

[02:11:46.650 --> 02:11:50.230]
And there are a lot of people. Oh, that's commercial crap. That's it like that the George Martin

[02:11:50.230 --> 02:11:56.510]
Neo was all that same crap. How was it great? It was great. I played that on Zeta was coming out of my ears at Zeta

[02:11:57.110 --> 02:11:58.130]
Because I loved it

[02:11:58.130 --> 02:12:03.790]
Better than that crap pd uh, bolder one just to play you idiot you assassin you grave robber

[02:12:04.370 --> 02:12:10.390]
Kurt Cobain 10 Morris give 11 Bob Marley's got 11 months he Bob Marley's on air. What do you what you people be talking about

[02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:15.070]

[02:12:17.290 --> 02:12:18.970]
Jerry Garcia's got 16

[02:12:20.110 --> 02:12:25.570]
Roy Orbison 19 Frank's app of 22 I guarantee you will be doing better if we have some good stuff like you got it

[02:12:26.550 --> 02:12:29.530]

Little Robert for the Jim Krochi stuff

[02:12:39.390 --> 02:12:43.410]
He would never gotten that many votes and you want to know what really put him over got him that many votes

[02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.790]
What

[02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:48.570]
Big badly broly were a brown. Oh, yeah

[02:12:49.410 --> 02:12:52.910]
Well, this is the kind of place where that would be a most of america is the kind of a place

[02:12:53.690 --> 02:12:59.230]
Oh, yeah, it's great, but it's a little on the red that he said oh my set is in the door again. Don't slam it

[02:13:00.930 --> 02:13:05.510]
It's actually turned the city. I beg your pardon he already told me that I gave him credit

[02:13:13.450 --> 02:13:15.790]
That was a talk-up that will live for the 80s

[02:13:17.970 --> 02:13:20.670]
It was one of those contrived 40 talk-ups Ricky Tiki

[02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:23.850]
five six four

[02:13:24.910 --> 02:13:29.050]
All the time that's that puking thing we got important to read in the magic city that thing

[02:13:36.130 --> 02:13:41.750]
What is that under that thing I were spring thing no no the the the talk-up thing

[02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:47.810]
I think it's under Ricky Tiki. No, it's because that's not Ricky Tiki. You're you're losing it

[02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:51.730]
Just before I really thought you were like making a comeback. That's not under Ricky Tiki

[02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:57.870]
The the cart that it was on had just a question mark on the front liquor remember the label right a question mark on it

[02:13:57.870 --> 02:14:01.710]
Isn't that amazing that we can remember with our brilliant minds all of this unimportant crap

[02:14:01.710 --> 02:14:04.130]
It's almost like remembering Harold Snodgrass

[02:14:05.090 --> 02:14:07.410]
at Hazel Park and

[02:14:07.410 --> 02:14:09.310]
Joe Lighthill and Jack Ackerman and

[02:14:10.690 --> 02:14:12.250]
Jimmy Arthur but at any rate

[02:14:12.850 --> 02:14:17.750]
Here comes Atlanta, Georgia on the outside and here on the far outside is candid Rodney just mowing him down

[02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:22.050]
Remember candid Rodney of course not so real candid one that did that talk up if it wasn't Ricky Tiki

[02:14:22.050 --> 02:14:26.230]
It wasn't him wasn't it was a phone it was a it was a contrile for our benefit

[02:14:26.850 --> 02:14:29.130]
It was somebody at the the coast

[02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:35.330]
Inside the i.o. D. Building. Don't you remember that of course that wasn't right. It wasn't a real thing

[02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:40.470]
And then the burden I were like laughing our oh wasn't it on the phone

[02:14:41.570 --> 02:14:44.750]
It had to be on the phone because that's when we cracked up when he hit the post

[02:14:46.110 --> 02:14:51.210]
Even even the Panthers haven't hit the posters off of course when you only got 12 shots how many times you're gonna hit the post anyway

[02:14:52.050 --> 02:14:57.430]
But hitting the post don't count as a shot. I know that don't call it. It's stuck in me information. Okay. I know my hockey crap

[02:14:58.070 --> 02:15:01.850]
And believe me crap is the word they've been playing a call from Kansas City. Hello

[02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:06.410]
Hey, Neil how you doing pretty good. How about Wilbur Harrison in Kansas City? You bad

[02:15:06.410 --> 02:15:10.610]
I used to live in South Florida listen to you now you get you on the net right hey

[02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:14.670]
Took a little bit of my thunder earlier. I was gonna nominate Carl Wilson

[02:15:14.670 --> 02:15:20.730]
But uh never when you left out really major artists with Sam Cook. Not air just to put him on there

[02:15:21.230 --> 02:15:26.270]
Oh, you did add him on and shame on us. No, that's because somebody faxed him in to remind one of you know there's so many of them you can't

[02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:33.390]
Can't have your thumb on every one now. I'll leave you with one more. I think we did nominate Keith Richards. I mean he's daddy just doesn't know it. Okay

[02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:34.750]
Have a good one. Thanks

[02:15:35.530 --> 02:15:42.510]

Jackie Wilson we just added on there the list keeps it keeps getting bigger and bigger

[02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:53.590]
That's why we like it. It keeps expanding like like a wild out of control of thing

[02:15:54.730 --> 02:15:56.050]
Where's that thing where um

[02:15:57.230 --> 02:15:58.550]
Yeah, where the hell is that

[02:15:59.270 --> 02:16:03.710]
We're Jennifer says it just keeps getting bigger. Yeah, what's going on with Jennifer by the way

[02:16:03.710 --> 02:16:08.990]
Do we know how they heard from her at a while? I would have thought she would have called after my we heard from Terry Griffin after I might die

[02:16:10.090 --> 02:16:10.810]
And we heard from

[02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:13.050]
Ricky Tiki, which you're knocking now

[02:16:13.690 --> 02:16:16.990]
No, that thing is in there. I just don't know what it's under which is kind of hard to know though

[02:16:17.550 --> 02:16:20.530]
You don't know what it's under. I thought it was Ricky Tiki

[02:16:21.650 --> 02:16:25.530]
All in these years you thought that was Ricky Tiki was a real real Ricky Tiki

[02:16:25.530 --> 02:16:29.350]
But that's what I thought they were making fun of and that's what I thought it was labeled as

[02:16:30.890 --> 02:16:31.290]
No

[02:16:32.690 --> 02:16:37.590]
It had a question mark on the front remember question mark on a mysterious. Oh, I had a feeling he's probably still alive

[02:16:37.590 --> 02:16:40.030]
I'll tell you again. He was from Saginaw, Michigan

[02:16:41.590 --> 02:16:44.930]
Remember we had looked that up because there were others who were questioning my uh

[02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:45.830]
knowledge

[02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:49.550]
My question mark knowledge. I know my question marks. Okay

[02:16:59.310 --> 02:17:01.730]
Well, that was on the road now that they're home they can lose again. You think

[02:17:02.250 --> 02:17:02.570]

[02:17:03.310 --> 02:17:06.530]

[02:18:28.130 --> 02:18:30.050]
The lumpy him also the gravel

[02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:36.070]
That's right fair. Hey 75 degrees in the magic city

[02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:40.530]
Hey, we're broadcasting live hold on a second. Let me let me stuff out of over

[02:18:41.230 --> 02:18:44.850]
75 degrees in the magic city hills and all the great songs

[02:18:44.850 --> 02:18:50.550]
All we already will now come on now with it. We're gonna get down tonight. We're gonna grab you

[02:18:50.550 --> 02:18:51.750]
It's the right time

[02:18:54.430 --> 02:19:01.030]
Okay, so anyway that was uh somebody called to say it was Johnny dark

[02:19:01.570 --> 02:19:03.970]
Oh my god. Are you people out of your minds or what?

[02:19:04.350 --> 02:19:05.570]
Was not Johnny dark?

[02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:08.810]
Here's a fact that says you cannot tell me Keith Richards is actually alive

[02:19:08.810 --> 02:19:10.930]
He should count it also John cannot fly Denver

[02:19:10.930 --> 02:19:15.150]
Scott and Titusville just can't control himself put it back in your pants Scott calm down

[02:19:15.890 --> 02:19:17.550]
Let's see top 21 hit wonders

[02:19:19.410 --> 02:19:21.250]
Now that's the wrong pole okay

[02:19:22.470 --> 02:19:26.110]
I've got the a top 8 million one hit wonders from VH1 so forget about that

[02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:29.150]
Wayland Jennings what do you say no no how about Peter Jennings

[02:19:30.050 --> 02:19:35.010]
He's still alive, but it's hard to tell the way he just kind of like uh, I don't like I don't like ABC news

[02:19:35.730 --> 02:19:38.950]
It's the George Will Network and I won't watch it

[02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:41.490]
Oh, and here's one I guess Bill Cabrine must have called somebody and

[02:19:41.490 --> 02:19:42.890]
Bribed him to the fact that in

[02:19:43.330 --> 02:19:44.650]
So we put around there and on

[02:19:46.350 --> 02:19:47.870]
Dusty Springfield oh

[02:19:48.850 --> 02:19:50.030]
I don't know

[02:19:50.030 --> 02:19:54.390]
I mean that how could how seriously stop a stop and think about the nature of this pool

[02:19:55.350 --> 02:19:58.810]
Here's the question again and a lot of times I'll ask a poll and

[02:19:59.210 --> 02:20:02.150]
I you know we appreciate we get a lot of votes and some of them are even real ones

[02:20:02.770 --> 02:20:09.030]
It's just that you don't look at the question carefully enough stop and think about it take two or three seconds before you hop right in there

[02:20:09.030 --> 02:20:15.170]
And do something stupid like duff talking about the ball of the john yoko, which he apologized for he said he never wants to hear it again as long as he lives

[02:20:16.850 --> 02:20:22.530]
Who who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist dead

[02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:30.890]
Now I get it who would say that dusty springfield that would be like saying

[02:20:30.890 --> 02:20:35.530]
If she dies someday, which he might saline Dion you know

[02:20:37.390 --> 02:20:41.590]
You find some frogs some frog you know we don't frogs aren't allowed to vote in our pool

[02:20:42.390 --> 02:20:46.890]
Okay, we have a frog filter they can croak if they want to but I sure can't vote on our pool

[02:20:47.530 --> 02:20:50.870]
Who is your all-time favorite dead recording artist Elvis

[02:20:51.790 --> 02:20:55.270]
Janice Joplin John Lennon how about the Lennon sisters

[02:20:56.970 --> 02:21:03.750]
How about Lawrence or well, huh Lawrence about what what's that thing we got in there? Oh, I know what we got you know, I never play it

[02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:11.930]
Oh, don't tell me it's not in here. What is that under G dead is it under G dead? Oh, we're let's sir. I

[02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:12.910]
Don't I don't see it

[02:21:13.890 --> 02:21:18.230]
How come it's in my DCS in Toronto when it's not in the one here? Oh

[02:21:18.230 --> 02:21:21.350]
Because it's the guy's name who said that

[02:21:23.850 --> 02:21:26.730]
No, it's not a Florence Welk. No, it's not

[02:21:27.710 --> 02:21:32.690]
It's not in here. It's in there, but it's not Lawrence Welk who said that. Oh, it's a Stan freeberg. There it is

[02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:36.710]
It's still I see what you saying. It could be possibly be understand freeberg

[02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:39.850]
So you always do that to it's not maybe it's under freeberg

[02:21:40.430 --> 02:21:46.010]
I don't think it's in here and you're just making up all kinds of stories. It's not in there you lied George lied

[02:21:47.950 --> 02:21:54.490]
Anyway, can I get back what what what that was I doing Jimmy Hendrix by the way overlook some of those votes under because I I catch that in a heartbeat

[02:21:54.490 --> 02:21:56.750]
You're not a fool in this old queen. I'll take it out right now

[02:21:57.390 --> 02:21:59.470]
That's what the Freddie Mercury would say if he could

[02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:07.410]
Elvis Janice jobling John Lennon. I want to keep saying the Lennon sisters. I don't know why it's just the way he used to say it now the Lennon's

[02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:07.690]
sister

[02:22:08.970 --> 02:22:13.730]
That's the crowd from winmore that comes over there to pompino park especially went on the Monday nights when we have the free spaghetti dinner

[02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:17.790]
They come from winmore and from what's the other place up there that cemetery village

[02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:22.030]
What's the other geriatric uh hotbed

[02:22:23.170 --> 02:22:30.230]
winmore and there's one other one well there are two cemetery villages no no there's in pop it or there's another one another one

[02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:35.250]
Somebody will call George Harrison Roy Orbison Jim Morrison Jimmy Hendrix Mori Morris Gibb

[02:22:35.250 --> 02:22:37.890]
Stop calling him a Reese already, okay? Mo Gibb

[02:22:39.070 --> 02:22:42.350]
Marvin Gaye Jim Croci oh Jim Croci

[02:22:44.270 --> 02:22:46.310]
Better than a walking car

[02:22:47.330 --> 02:22:48.910]
Me know that your car

[02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:56.890]
How do you roll your camera? I think if they want to have a true test of a patriotism that everybody should stand up

[02:22:56.890 --> 02:23:01.850]
And anybody who raises their hand and says they don't like Jim Croci immediately deported that would satisfy papu can

[02:23:01.850 --> 02:23:05.990]
And I think he's a little bit unhappy the love you folks came in Georgian Carlos

[02:23:06.670 --> 02:23:08.310]
Jim Croci buddy Holly

[02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:13.210]
You like buddy Holly sure why not we like buddy. He's a little overrated. I would say though

[02:23:13.210 --> 02:23:15.730]
How many hits did buddy Holly have before he died

[02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:21.810]
Peggy Sue that'll be the day that was buddy Holly in the crickets what else

[02:23:22.330 --> 02:23:24.870]
Let me look it up in a book just because we don't want to be scientific

[02:23:25.970 --> 02:23:29.750]
What else I mean he did die in a very young age and it was gonna be bigger than life itself

[02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:33.810]
I guess he was extraordinarily ugly like Roy Orbison I think that helps

[02:23:34.510 --> 02:23:37.350]
I think that helps a lot oh look at all them uh hits on here

[02:23:37.970 --> 02:23:39.310]
But not big ones see

[02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:42.750]
Peggy Sue that oh boy that's right oh boy

[02:23:43.210 --> 02:23:44.370]
Maybe baby

[02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:50.090]
Raven oh yeah think it over pools paradise early in the morning real wild

[02:23:50.990 --> 02:23:57.090]
Heartbeat it doesn't matter anymore rating in my heart and someday when I'm gone from you oh Bobby V in the crickets

[02:23:57.090 --> 02:23:58.650]
That must be after that plane crash

[02:23:58.650 --> 02:24:02.870]
Bobby V remember Phil Henry hated Bobby V remember that I got very upset that day

[02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:08.150]
And I admitted he was right and Bobby V sucked but at any rate no I like Bobby V's one song not remember

[02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:10.390]
We're not uh not remember what was the one song yet

[02:24:11.570 --> 02:24:15.230]
The night has a thousand eyes is the one I like but the other one other one it was horrible

[02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:19.970]
Remember ball was the circle which we just got through here and on they want to okay on there

[02:24:20.630 --> 02:24:21.930]
Oh I better cue that up again

[02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:24.790]
Because you know next time we go to play that huh

[02:24:25.330 --> 02:24:28.490]
And you see you asked me if it was on a card couldn't you tell by how money it sounded

[02:24:29.350 --> 02:24:35.710]
Because it's gonna sound muddy we have a we have a we have a contest going on between the cart and the cart machine rubber ball

[02:24:36.210 --> 02:24:38.730]
Rubber we see I had my balls confused

[02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:43.530]
Yeah, I had my balls all screwed up there rubber ball

[02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:48.310]
By Bobby V and red rubber ball was by the circle jerk. It's wrong with you

[02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:53.150]
5 6 7 on ton you the music stuff that we do I just get blown away in fact

[02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:54.810]
I think we're changing format to all music

[02:24:54.810 --> 02:24:56.510]
Starting right now okay

[02:24:59.750 --> 02:25:06.110]
I mean if it was good enough for Q and back in the old days not guarantee our signals probably a lot better now than it was then because our crack engineering department

[02:25:07.250 --> 02:25:08.090]
Aren't there on crack

[02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:16.730]
I said your hoodie was got a big crack. I'm sure that cuz he's basically like a lot. I don't want to I don't want to think about when who you'll bend over

[02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:23.550]
Especially if you're like downwind can you imagine can you imagine when the fact people in this building cut oh cut loose

[02:25:24.750 --> 02:25:28.370]
Man oh man. Oh man. Can you imagine being downwind from fat boy?

[02:25:28.570 --> 02:25:30.850]
Whoo talk about heavy duty

[02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:35.410]
Good golly miss Molly. How about little Richard he's still alive. He's still preaching it

[02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:43.110]
5 6 7 0 5 6 the pound 5 6 the pain no attention to those Jimmy Hendrix folks under he's gonna get de-cued

[02:25:43.110 --> 02:25:46.750]
He's gonna get back for a lacton break at the wire and get knocked down a couple of notches

[02:25:46.750 --> 02:25:51.350]
And by the way anybody speaking at lacton break at the wire who tells me that Randy Waples ain't a great driver

[02:25:51.350 --> 02:25:53.510]
And that's the drivers in the Ontario

[02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:57.010]
Whatever they call it the Ontario D. O. J. C. Circuit

[02:25:58.230 --> 02:26:01.630]
Aren't great. I know it's just having fun with me like Dick Feinberg was doing last night

[02:26:01.630 --> 02:26:05.830]
Dick Feinberg by the way will share with you some of the acid that they dropped in his coffee last night at the track

[02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:07.590]
He was talking all kinds of stuff

[02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:14.270]
When he started telling me about what a great driver Dave Ingram was at that point. I didn't know what it'll laugh for cry

[02:26:15.170 --> 02:26:20.150]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:23.270]
Here's a call online one that don't have nothing next to it George. Hello

[02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:27.550]
Where's this from? I don't know. Here's a call from somewhere

[02:26:28.210 --> 02:26:31.230]
Is that me? That's you. Where are you calling from sir?

[02:26:31.950 --> 02:26:33.990]
All right, well I wouldn't tell anybody either

[02:26:33.990 --> 02:26:40.470]
Okay, well I know some of the details about that uh the aerospace misresurrection and run DMC go right ahead the actual

[02:26:40.470 --> 02:26:42.190]
They put him back on a map is what I'm hearing

[02:26:42.970 --> 02:26:47.770]
Well sort of the actual resurrection happened long before the Armageddon soundtrack in 1989

[02:26:48.330 --> 02:26:54.530]
With songs like ragdoll and jane he's got a gun right great right before that though before we saw

[02:26:55.070 --> 02:27:00.750]
Uh the band again on mpv run DMC read it that song and had aerospace myths are in it

[02:27:01.750 --> 02:27:03.730]
So they didn't really have anything to do with it

[02:27:03.730 --> 02:27:10.270]
They just kind of showed us Steven Tyler right before David Gesson resurrected aerospace with the jane you've got a gun and everything there you go

[02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:14.810]
Uh can I ramble a quick conspiracy before I hang up it's only two seconds sure go right ahead

[02:27:14.810 --> 02:27:21.950]
Okay, the term british invasion actually originated from the CIA to represent British artists whose lyric some of their lyrics

[02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:26.070]
We're originally intended to work on the minds of a few assassins living in the United States

[02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:31.270]
But that all ended when the CIA used their own assassins marked David Chapman to kill John Lennon

[02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:35.590]
Who didn't know the origin of some of the people's lyrics and was super enough to stay living here

[02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:39.030]
All right, okay

[02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:44.930]
Did you know that the CIA killed John Lennon off until the small but I never knew that

[02:27:53.610 --> 02:27:54.490]
Roger Whitaker

[02:27:54.490 --> 02:27:55.050]
So

[02:27:58.810 --> 02:27:59.670]
He belongs out there

[02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:04.090]
The box he just let him right oh

[02:28:04.930 --> 02:28:07.050]
Com air here's the vacuum com air is the place

[02:28:13.610 --> 02:28:15.090]
Didn't he do garrantone

[02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:27.310]
The factions are getting better by the minute folks

[02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:33.730]
Anybody that picks on Steve Tyler's gonna have a call over my big fat smelly body. I'll tell you that right now

[02:28:33.730 --> 02:28:36.110]
Okay, Steve Tyler is god right next to

[02:28:36.610 --> 02:28:37.170]
That's right

[02:28:37.950 --> 02:28:42.450]
Great I still don't understand anybody doesn't like their music. What what is there to knock about their music?

[02:28:42.930 --> 02:28:46.470]
Huh, I mean, I realized not everybody likes fish food or rocky road ice cream

[02:28:46.470 --> 02:28:53.250]
But how could you not like hero Smith explain that to me in addition to which I discovered and I found this out the hard way over the years every time

[02:28:53.250 --> 02:28:58.770]
We talk about music that the people who dislike them dislike them intensely. It's not like just a hate them

[02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:04.690]
I don't I don't know maybe they figured like they're competing with somebody that they like I don't have any idea

[02:29:04.690 --> 02:29:07.710]
Just that the people who don't like hero Smith hate them

[02:29:08.170 --> 02:29:09.030]
Both of them

[02:29:09.550 --> 02:29:15.070]
Now here I was trying to thank thank goodness for duff here because this is his one area of expertise is this corny old music

[02:29:15.070 --> 02:29:18.930]
Him and Bokeh Bryant, but somebody faxes blew on blue by Bobby Vinton

[02:29:19.610 --> 02:29:25.830]
Ha, which isn't exactly Bobby V. He's got Bobby Vinton the Polish prince confused with Bobby V

[02:29:26.470 --> 02:29:30.550]
What do you laugh at about that's what he's known as the Polish Prince? I know all about okay, sure

[02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:34.330]
It's almost enough to inspire me to pray the god the godfather polka

[02:29:35.410 --> 02:29:39.190]
Don't you think and on a body event who's still alive by

[02:29:54.810 --> 02:29:55.170]
Oh

[02:30:11.950 --> 02:30:18.610]
It's four minutes till noon by I love that I just absolutely excuse me in a right mood, you know it and by the way that having been said the godfather polka

[02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:22.250]
I just want to mention a conjunction with that a mole were monitoring you here on the show

[02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:30.310]
Here's the facts from Phil and Coral Springs who says the other geriatric joy this pomegranate thank you just got it and how about Casselius they insist on mama Cass

[02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:32.270]
Huh?

[02:30:32.390 --> 02:30:36.090]
I mean it's free to put her out here there she might get what how about her sister

[02:30:36.930 --> 02:30:38.890]
If we got job rule how about jamama

[02:30:39.830 --> 02:30:44.970]
What do you say mama? Okay, let's put her on there see what happens put big fat mama Cass on there Eric don't listen to these guys

[02:30:44.970 --> 02:30:46.910]
Okay, you're just doing a out of prejudice

[02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:48.130]
That

[02:30:49.950 --> 02:30:55.870]
Well, that's right Carlos just reminded me the Papa John just croaked sure long ago Papa John from the pizza place

[02:30:57.550 --> 02:31:04.530]
I know he died. I know he loved John Sebastian. Let's put him on there. All right, well he he belongs on there more than mama Cass

[02:31:05.730 --> 02:31:11.810]
He wasn't some fat old slob that ate too many slommy sandwiches and choked on John Sebastian was pretty good musician

[02:31:11.810 --> 02:31:12.350]
Sure

[02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:16.930]
Let's put John Sebastian on there. What do you say and then maybe we'll put Joel Sebastian on there later

That's what I call him, but through my time here at the BRC

[02:34:35.470 --> 02:34:41.310]

[02:35:02.870 --> 02:35:06.990]

He agrees with everything you say

[02:36:15.890 --> 02:36:20.410]

But John Phillips is dead from the mamas and if I guess I got another one I found here

[02:36:42.730 --> 02:36:48.750]
Hey, it goes to show you that we could probably cure this pull on for about six months and just might do it

[02:36:49.290 --> 02:36:52.390]
Because there are so many dead recording artists and so little time

He's dead

[02:38:50.210 --> 02:38:54.030]
Why why would somebody from Danny in the junior? I guess because at the hop was their only hidden

[02:38:54.730 --> 02:38:56.410]
I mean they might have had something else marginal

[02:38:56.410 --> 02:38:59.670]
I guess I could look it up just you know because you're a pain in the ass giving me that look

[02:39:00.370 --> 02:39:06.190]
That look like you're about Danny in the gym. Yeah, why not? What do you got against them now? They ever do anything to you?

Vocal group form while the high school filled off in 1955 is the juvenaires

Danny rap was the lead singer David white first tenor frank mafe

[02:39:34.010 --> 02:39:40.110]

Do the do in the kind that'll walk in ula la limbo. Oh that reached number 99

[02:40:44.190 --> 02:40:46.650]
And I think that was the that was the end for them

[02:40:46.650 --> 02:40:50.310]
But was that before oh yeah, that was long no wonder we committed suicide

[02:40:50.310 --> 02:40:55.850]
Now that their last hit was in 63 and I say hit very loosely and this kid committed suicide in

[02:40:56.890 --> 02:41:01.910]
83 so 20 years after they hit and I hit on the charts. He finally said well. That's it. We're done

[02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:07.530]
Sorry about that Danny. In juniors, you were okay by me. They were kind of like you know they reminded me a little bit of

[02:41:08.210 --> 02:41:10.630]
They were like the four runner of the new kids on a block

[02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:17.950]
Is that what when you laughing about like that's a joke? That's very serious analization of my musical

Pier one imports with tons of free parking with delicious great food unbelievably big portions teeny tiny prices

[02:44:18.690 --> 02:44:24.590]
Everything is cooked to order fresh and delicious and when I say to order boy that's important because you don't want soggy pasta

[02:44:24.590 --> 02:44:30.130]
You don't want overcooked stuff you want to cook fresh and believe me you'll taste the difference and they've got the best garlic rolls in the world

[02:44:30.130 --> 02:44:33.830]
Three different kinds of great pizza every pasta dish under the sun. They do a great job of catering

[02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:38.730]
They have take out they have delivery for any of that stuff called 954 916 888

In westbrow out there by me the good news is they got a brand new pizza loft in plantation

3a 299 is that number for take out delivery and catering in westbroward 954 3a 299

[02:45:06.090 --> 02:45:09.750]

[02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:14.730]
Several times a week at the world famous pizza loft now with two spectacitor-broward locations

Anybody have a heart or a liver

[02:45:37.610 --> 02:45:45.750]
I was standing there one day not thinking I would die from being able to make

[02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:46.950]
Ditto to do

[02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:55.870]
I should ever eat McDonald's a big back mostly trapped inside my bowels

[02:45:59.250 --> 02:46:02.590]
How can you die from impacted thoughts

[02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:06.270]
You're let these moody doctors in

[02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:12.710]
Now my heart stops you schwarz at sign I for my intestines

[02:46:15.310 --> 02:46:23.730]
I guess I should have known what to expect living in Miami with the kind of service you can get in this town

[02:46:24.350 --> 02:46:27.770]
I would act to be too far wrong

[02:46:27.770 --> 02:46:31.530]
If I need to eat that wrap I swallow

[02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:42.070]
Why can't you let me so you can ask why can't you lose us get it right

[02:46:42.810 --> 02:46:49.290]
My bowels were blocked inside my hiding can make my church go out

[02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:03.250]
It's

[02:47:03.250 --> 02:47:03.790]
Now we're talking

[02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:14.410]
A dream lover will come my way

[02:47:15.430 --> 02:47:15.930]
Girl

He's so wrapped up with is that he's just his obsessed with this he can't handle it

[02:47:44.090 --> 02:47:48.370]
How about this how can we have left this out talking about Bobby Derm shame on you George

[02:47:50.530 --> 02:47:54.010]
Huh shame on you miss it. No, he didn't you did

Splash

[02:48:40.650 --> 02:48:46.790]
Now let me ask you did we actually put Bobby Dermon on there or not because if we didn't I'm really ashamed of you

[02:48:47.190 --> 02:48:48.870]
I think you talk me out of it

[02:48:51.270 --> 02:48:55.550]
That's seriously did we put him on there or not I think not

[02:48:56.090 --> 02:49:03.050]
Oh, you know what happened? Voka Brankham in here in the middle and all these spots all of these spots all of my copies in here like all bald up

[02:49:05.290 --> 02:49:08.430]
But it was well worth it. It had to price where the hell is my list George

[02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:12.110]
Did we ever put Bobby Dermon Bobby Dermon is on there

[02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:14.390]
What

[02:49:15.430 --> 02:49:16.710]
What what is he saying?

[02:49:16.890 --> 02:49:20.070]
Nothing that was just this whole big thing going on in here. I thought we might want to share it. Oh yeah

[02:49:20.070 --> 02:49:22.130]
What we are over we even dropped a little bit on that

[02:49:23.070 --> 02:49:27.250]
But I was busy looking for Bobby Dermon. He's on her. How's he doing on our polls matter fact? Come on Bobby

[02:49:27.250 --> 02:49:31.850]
Why are he's good Bobby Dermon he ain't doing too good now, but he's let's see

[02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:35.310]
Huh he probably can sing better than uh

[02:49:35.310 --> 02:49:36.650]
Stevie Ray Vaughan

[02:49:37.650 --> 02:49:42.650]
Let's see I don't I don't see no Bobby Dermon. I am getting a little bit suspicious of what happened here, you know

[02:49:43.310 --> 02:49:49.750]
I'm looking I'm looking maybe this is one that Eric missed. Oh, I don't see Bobby Dermon on there Eric. Uh-oh

[02:49:49.750 --> 02:49:55.290]
Do you see it? I don't see it more as Gibb Kurt Cobain George Joharison

[02:49:56.130 --> 02:49:57.010]
Roy Orbison

[02:49:58.170 --> 02:50:00.230]
John Lennon who was murdered by the CIA

[02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:06.830]
Uh, I don't see no Bobby Dermon. I've got it written right down here. It's right under Bob Marley

[02:50:07.430 --> 02:50:12.450]
So if you're looking for Bobby Dermon just lift up Bob Marley and you'll find his ass to right out of the dreadlocks

[02:50:13.570 --> 02:50:18.450]
Right he was great Bobby Dermon. We better get that on the right way Eric before people start laughing at us

[02:50:18.850 --> 02:50:21.530]
Just during our credibility what little we have left working on this day

[02:50:22.510 --> 02:50:27.830]
Guys, did we talk about this one? Yes, I don't like it's up for us. This is corny. I don't like corny but

[02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:30.050]
Where the fuck

[02:50:30.830 --> 02:50:33.710]
Oh, this is the one that must be in front of the right

[02:50:33.710 --> 02:50:36.650]
We have one on the side but this one on the other hand

[02:50:37.890 --> 02:50:38.250]
Great

[02:50:42.650 --> 02:50:44.390]
You can talk about you

[02:50:45.290 --> 02:50:47.090]
This is great. You remember this?

[02:50:47.410 --> 02:50:50.290]
How far is this?

[02:50:58.690 --> 02:51:00.210]
You hear that love by Queen

[02:51:02.010 --> 02:51:03.350]
I got some pretty good ideas

[02:51:05.350 --> 02:51:05.990]
Gay

[02:51:13.970 --> 02:51:14.330]
Oh

[02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:16.990]
Thanks to welcome Brian for bringing in Bobby Dermon and what's left of them anyway

[02:51:16.990 --> 02:51:20.630]
Yeah, let's get that on there right away. It's a good thing. I double checked on that one

[02:51:20.630 --> 02:51:23.210]
As if in an idiotic taking that pull without Bobby Dermon

[02:51:24.110 --> 02:51:26.690]
Indeed, what do you think about Del Shannon to be on Adam on there

[02:51:27.530 --> 02:51:30.490]
He's not on there. No all those hits

[02:51:31.550 --> 02:51:35.630]
He had three or four good it. He certainly had as many hits as some of the other stiffs we got on here

[02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:38.110]
Oh, he belonged under one of these other people like mama Cass

[02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:41.970]
Did we actually put mama Cass? I don't know. I better check out okay

[02:51:41.970 --> 02:51:42.790]
Mama La Cass

[02:51:44.410 --> 02:51:47.550]
She ain't on there. I think Eric went out to lunches

[02:51:48.330 --> 02:51:53.210]
Check he wasn't doing heavily. I don't see no mama Cass. I don't see no Bobby Dermon. I don't see no

[02:51:54.050 --> 02:51:56.090]
Who is it?

[02:51:56.110 --> 02:51:58.390]
Del Shannon Tommy Shannon

[02:51:59.150 --> 02:52:05.750]
You know from Tommy Shannon he used to be on WKVW with Joey Reynolds and Buffalo and then he went to WSYZ and CKLW and Detroit

[02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:06.590]
Tommy Shannon

[02:52:07.470 --> 02:52:12.390]
In fact Joey Reynolds and Tommy Shannon were the managers of most of the group

[02:52:12.870 --> 02:52:15.150]
That they ripped off the rock and rebel the rock and rope

[02:52:16.330 --> 02:52:20.710]
Look at Brian. What is happening with him? Oh broke up Brian. Yeah, wow. We can't I got a ringer in while we can

[02:52:21.190 --> 02:52:25.730]
In fact, we used to have that on a cart. It wouldn't surprise me at all if it was in the uh, not in there

[02:52:26.270 --> 02:52:31.410]
I'll be damned while well. I had a card on that. That was a good song too while it was on swan records remember that

[02:52:32.070 --> 02:52:36.570]
Wild Wikin by the rock and rebels and Joey and Tommy somehow they never got they never got one penny

[02:52:36.590 --> 02:52:38.770]
That song was released out a how many times in fact

[02:52:40.270 --> 02:52:41.470]

Prove it. Nobody's perfect even though you've come up with some amazing. I mean, oh you didn't get branded

You don't know your rock and rebels in Buffalo radio mister. He would talk about it all the time Joey

What I had to do those and what what he says what what he's saying. I don't know. I had to tune down

[02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:37.210]
Joey would talk about the rock and rebels all the time and pretend that maybe those guys actually really got paid

[02:55:37.210 --> 02:55:40.070]
He was a pain in the ass is what I heard. I am that him right. Yeah

[02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:46.490]
He would talk about that rats up your ass or whatever that's rats in my room. Yeah, that was him and Tommy Shannon rats in my room

That was a real song believe it or not

[02:55:50.190 --> 02:55:53.930]
And of course every time he and Bill Marshall were in the studio George was thinking rats in our room

[02:55:54.550 --> 02:56:00.290]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon line got 100 open lines now again

I didn't like his corny stuff. I liked his uh upbeat stuff like that

[02:56:32.910 --> 02:56:37.630]
Dream lover. Well dream lover was not beat but it was great. That was a good song. I was his best song. Is there any argument about that? No

[02:56:38.990 --> 02:56:43.330]
See it's always a good way to win an argument is like to close the debate before anybody else has a chance at like

[02:56:44.290 --> 02:56:45.230]
Sorry times up

[02:56:47.110 --> 02:56:52.910]

He'll tour

[02:59:51.810 --> 02:59:52.530]

Here's the facts that says

[03:04:51.370 --> 03:04:57.530]
Please don't forget about Mary Wells with their many hit records and Laura Nero a brilliant songwriter singer for example

[03:04:57.530 --> 03:05:00.810]
It's gonna take a miracle. Well, guess what Greg this is a different Greg

[03:05:00.810 --> 03:05:05.750]
It's gonna take a miracle for us to put Laura Nero on there when you say I'd rather put Peter Nero on there

[03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:11.550]
Remember Peter Nero? No, I bet you Bokeh Brian does used to tinkle on a piano and RCA records

[03:05:12.450 --> 03:05:18.070]
Bokeh Brian said he was a pianist he was a pianist how about Roger Williams and Jane Morgan, huh and two different worlds

Plus don't forget the stuff she did with Marvin's gay

[03:05:38.130 --> 03:05:41.510]
Right and as long as you're talking about Marvin Gaye we could have put Tammy Torella on there

[03:05:41.510 --> 03:05:47.170]
But I don't think so you want to know why because Tammy Torella I don't think I'd erode and she have any hits on a rone Tammy Torella

[03:05:47.890 --> 03:05:52.530]
Not that we know of I could look it up in the book, but if so marginal at best we like Tammy Torella a lot

Like today, you know like the punks today with their rap music was the same thing
