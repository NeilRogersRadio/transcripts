and Andy Dick as Ryzen Duff Lindsay.

[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.880]
What's your problem, Lindsay?

[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.020]
I can't get my hemlifestraid!

[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.580]
What?

[00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.600]
Get out there on the grind!

[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.580]
Okay!

[00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.340]
What?

[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.980]
I mean, yes sir!

[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.620]
Stepnimbley on those heel-sister!

[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.040]
S-A-D-U-O-D-I!

[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.840]
100!

[00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.640]
S-A-D-U-O-D-I!

[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.420]
100!

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.600]
Hey, buddy, look at our hard tip on the poor-

[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.840]
We love D-Fo!

[00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.240]
I heard that private D-Fo!

[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.840]
Oh, I guess I...

[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.480]
We've got the Colonel Reeze office on the double!

[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:58.840]
Why, yes, certainly.

[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.160]
Reporting as audit, Colonel Reed.

[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.060]
Well, that is private.

[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.900]
Thanks, sir.

[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.900]
And now look it.

[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.480]
There's a mole in the company, is it?

[00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.200]
Yes, and I'd like to know who that might be.

[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.780]
Well, I, uh...

[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.140]
I think it's you, sir.

[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.880]
Oh no!

[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.840]
No, no!

[00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.460]
Because they'll never know it's me!

[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.660]
Oh, run away!

[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.180]
Come away!

[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:21.120]
Come away!

[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.220]
You can't find me!

[00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.700]
You can't find me!

[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:26.540]
I don't know what I've been told!

[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.440]
I don't know what I've been told!

[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.200]
Big, big, little woman ain't got no soul!

[00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.020]
Big, big, little woman ain't got no soul!

[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.920]
Jack-o!

[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.780]
Jack-o!

[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.780]
Jack-o!

[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.620]
Jack-o!

[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.500]
Jack-o!

[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.320]
For all, Jack-o!

[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.220]
Jack-o!

[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.540]
Ah!

[00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.120]
Ali!

[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.200]
Gal-D!

[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.380]
Ah-ha!

[00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.020]
Put your clothes at squeaky-boys!

[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.760]
You filthy!

[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.080]
Now drop and give me twenty push-ups!

[00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.220]
Yes, right now!

[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.180]
I'm too squeaky!

[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.040]
Too squeaky!

[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.900]
No, not that way!

[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.320]
No!

[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.400]
On top of Carol!

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.160]
Ah!

[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:57.140]
Yeah!

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.080]
No!

[00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.300]

[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.840]
Anybody want to meet us?

[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.900]
This is a barracks and selling to do twins!

[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.020]
Wow, Carol, three-all week long, this clock had been a minute fast,

[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.380]
and they must think of the other room that I'm real anxious to get out of here,

[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.960]
which they're right about that, but...

[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.000]
All week long, it's been a minute fast.

[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.080]
Now we got the right time!

[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.440]
Oh!

[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.340]
And that's really good.

[00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.560]
That last old fart that called up on boat campers there...

[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.960]
What about the O'Rideges?

[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.220]
You're listening right now, you silly old banger.

[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.180]
Okay, go empty out the bag before you go call any radio talk shows.

[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.380]
We can smell it right over the phone.

[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.000]
God!

[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.180]
So what's going on?

[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.380]
Happy Thursday to you.

[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.080]
Let's see, we got a big fan appearance.

[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.060]
They were only 8-790 bucks short of 40 grand.

[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.800]
That's not too bad.

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.980]
We're starting to make a little progress.

[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.500]
Now that's November 13th.

[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.600]
From noon to two today, the QM fan will be at Marine Max Boats

[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.660]
at 700 South Federal Highway in Poppano Beach.

[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.120]
The lovely Miguel will be there.

[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.160]
He'll be peddling his wares.

[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.820]
Criticy of the real yellow pages from Bel South.

[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.080]
The first 15 people that donate to a band and pay a rescue

[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.620]
and pick up some of our merchandise will get a movie pranks good

[00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.500]
for two people with special showing of timeline on the 25th day of the Embré.

[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.480]
So that's the noon to two today at Marine Max Boats.

[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.600]
700 South Federal Highway in Poppano Beach.

[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.820]
790 bucks.

[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.020]
We ought to be able to raise that and hear before noon,

[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.520]
especially now that I'm here in the flesh.

[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480]
Those checks, that door ought to be open and people ought to be just pouring the checks in here,

[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.020]
who haven't given the dime so far.

[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.000]
So there are two articles in the news papers this morning needless to say.

[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.140]
I see your first check just came in right now.

[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.260]
Needless to say, Scott Forellan here no more.

[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.800]
And for the old fart I called again, I heard a couple of those this morning one coming in.

[00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.200]
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:37.800]
What about the Arigis?

[00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.420]
Yeah, let's clean it all up.

[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.640]
Let's just talk sports 28 hours a day.

[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.640]
Let's talk about that great quarterback that used to play for Florida A&M 100 years ago.

[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.780]
All your old cockers out there, man, it's really sad.

[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.800]
You're the ones who destroyed this area and make it a place that nobody with a brain,

[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.600]
nobody with more than 50 sent in their pocket really wants to stay in them,

[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.320]
no matter what they tell you.

[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.340]
Don't believe anybody.

[00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.840]
At any rate.

[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.240]
Forellan's gone and I guess, you know, we're going to talk about it.

[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.060]
In fact, I got a great poll question, which would include that,

[00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.380]
but a lot of other things as well.

[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.500]
I guess I'll read the first, the two articles first before I address it myself,

[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.960]
because I have a lot to say about it.

[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.740]
Let me just say this.

[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:23.740]
When you're a little kid growing up and you go in the kitchen and the electric stove is on,

[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.620]
and Mommy says, hey, Johnny, don't put your hand on the stove.

[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.640]
You're going to burn yourself.

[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.560]
And Johnny sure enough puts his hand on the stove and oh geez!

[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.820]
And burns his ass.

[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:34.320]
You know what I mean?

[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.740]
Just burns the hell out of himself and it's not good.

[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:37.500]
It hurts like hell.

[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.000]
And about a day or two later, Johnny comes waddling into the kitchen and the burner is on,

[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.880]
and Johnny just sticks his hand right back on that stove over and over again.

[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.120]
See, I like Scott, well, we got along fine.

[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.000]
I thought it was a good guy.

[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.500]
I think he is a pretty good guy, but he's his own worst enemy.

[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.700]
In fact, I think he's got a death wish.

[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.880]
I really do.

[00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.780]
He has a death wish.

[00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.800]
How many times can you, it's like neurotic repetition?

[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.500]
How many times can you keep getting fired for doing the same thing over and over again?

[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.460]
It's like telling Johnny, quit putting your hand on the stove and Johnny says,

[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.420]
ah, la, la, la, la, you're not going to tell me that's going to put my hand on the stove.

[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:13.020]
I mean, and Johnny keeps going back in there and puts his hand on the stove and sure enough,

[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.440]
Johnny keeps getting burned.

[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.780]
Now, you can build up a very impressive resume of working to about 600 radio stations,

[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.000]
or about three, four months of peace.

[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.180]
I mean, it's impressive from the stamp, which there's a lot of names on it.

[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.680]
But it doesn't really create what you call job security.

[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.120]
And how many times did I tell him off and on the air for the people who listen on the air,

[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.300]
take the money to the bank, laugh all the way to the bank, do whatever they want you to do,

[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.800]
and just go to the bank.

[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.960]
Couldn't do it.

[00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.880]
He just couldn't do it.

[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.480]
It would be like if I opened the show this morning by playing the unexplicated version of Condoleezza.

[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.740]
That would, you know, like having a death wish.

[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.820]
When you work for people and they say, you can't do this.

[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.480]
You mustn't do this.

[00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.280]
You know what it means?

[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.620]
You can't do it.

[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.060]
You just can't make it up as you go along.

[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.620]
And you can't use it as a tool.

[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.000]
Well, you know, Neil, that's nice.

[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.840]
And this one does that.

[00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.660]
No, no, we don't.

[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.460]
We don't do it because the rest of us who are still here and going to be here,

[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.620]
we know where to draw the line.

[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.780]
Some people know where some people don't have any line.

[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.200]
That's the problem.

[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.200]
Are all over the place.

[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.340]
It's that AOR radio format all over the road.

[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.100]
So I feel bad about that from his stamp, but it certainly comes as no shock.

[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.760]
Only shock to me is that it took this long.

[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.680]
I got to be honest, this is a very strange guy.

[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.200]
I like him, but I've worked in this business for a long, long time.

[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.540]
I've never encountered anybody.

[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.140]
You can't have a conversation with.

[00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.280]
You can't talk to the man because it's always...

[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.500]
Ah, you can say that.

[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.640]
You don't mind.

[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:49.820]
And on the way up the door with a mouthful of food,

[00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.580]
there's no such thing as sitting down or really having a conversation.

[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:53.480]
It doesn't exist.

[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.400]
Nothing penetrates.

[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:57.440]
You can try.

[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.800]
You can say, hey, just just laugh to the bank.

[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.440]
Take the money.

[00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:02.200]
Have a good time.

[00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.140]
Just cut out the excessive crap.

[00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.960]
Don't have a compulsive need like you got the turret syndrome or something.

[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:08.720]
Or a paracendrome.

[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.120]
Can't do it.

[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.260]
I mean, I hope for his sake,

[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.500]
someday that he like, you know,

[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.700]
reigns himself in and is able to realize that he's just going to have the same thing.

[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.060]
You know, you can have 85 job offers, Scott.

[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.560]
But you know, we're going to 84 other radio stations for a couple of months of peace.

[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.760]
What is that going to accomplish?

[00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.340]
Other than like in the first line in jikas column there,

[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.540]
he says controversial sports tacos,

[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.200]
Scott for religion,

[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.480]
a familiar position over the line and out of work.

[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.220]
There you go.

[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.120]
Johnny's got a burn hand because he keeps his hand on the stove.

[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.200]
And especially when you know when you work in a market where we have certain professional agitators out there

[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.620]
who just thrive on being the moral censors of the community,

[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.180]
while they're sitting out there, you know, stroking themselves,

[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.260]
I mean, what the hell is there?

[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.260]
What's it to say?

[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.860]
What is there to say when you know that upfront?

[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.300]
Giving other people ammunition to try to destroy you.

[00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.880]
So I don't, I really don't have a lot of sympathy.

[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.740]
I feel bad about the whole situation and really what it comes back to to be very honest with him,

[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.300]
is that Humpty Dumpty is continuing to try to put the pieces back together

[00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:15.100]
of the big egg that he broke about two years ago.

[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:17.760]
It's almost exactly two years ago,

[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]
a little bit more than two years.

[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.920]
When Greg read decided,

[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.740]
WAAA, WAAA, WAAA, he didn't like the way the first thing.

[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.040]
WAAA, they missed some sports stories.

[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.120]
See, when you had that much hands on,

[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.720]
when you're a little bit too over-involved,

[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.920]
and you start micromanaging every sports story with a sports nerds

[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.940]
and they missed this story.

[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.220]
Who the hell cares?

[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.320]
It's a business.

[00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.320]
The whole sports thing about this radio station

[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.520]
can give you any of the creeps anyway.

[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.680]
This whole thing about people who think that it's really so important

[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.840]
about who won a ball game or who's going to start an outside linebacker

[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.540]
who is going to be the defensive back or is Brian Greasy really as bad as he seems to be.

[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.620]
Yeah, I mean, it's okay for a little bit of fun.

[00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.740]
You'll notice that WAAA in New York is driven by one show on a radio station

[00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.400]
in terms of billing and in terms of ratings.

[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.300]
I know it's amazing because the guy's a dead man,

[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:06.880]
but it's been driven for years by Don I'mus.

[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.440]
He's got the biggest ratings on a station

[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.660]
and he's got the biggest revenue coming on that station.

[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.960]
The sports shows don't drive WAAA in,

[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.860]
which is the most popular sports station in America.

[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.000]
It's the non-sports show and the same is true here at WQIM.

[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.980]
The non-sports show the only one on a radio station

[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.620]
is the highest rated and the highest billing.

[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:28.900]
Makes the money so that they can play the ball games the rest of the day.

[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.680]
Give me the ball, give me the ball.

[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.380]
So that whole thing just gives me the creeps.

[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.460]
But the fact of the matter is we were going along pretty well

[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.960]
to say I've seen this happen in this business over and over again.

[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:43.980]
Managemith who just can't leave well and over,

[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.580]
they always have to be tinkering.

[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.520]
They're fine tuning.

[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.700]
Oh, oh gee, I just dropped the watch and I grabbed it,

[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.460]
just broke my Rolex.

[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.760]
I'm fine tuning it too much.

[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.280]
And that's what they do.

[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.780]
I'll say it again, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.620]
Don't dick with it.

[00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.520]
And it can't stop doing it.

[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.000]
And from that day forward, this station is never recovered.

[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.340]
Then we went through the Moe business.

[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.440]
Do we have to say any Moe about that?

[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.140]
I don't think so.

[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.400]
We all know what that did to this point.

[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:08.980]
Yeah, absolutely.

[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:09.420]
Right.

[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.280]
It more ways than one.

[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.520]
And then we went to the Ferrell business.

[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.400]
And now here we are today.

[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.120]
Do we have any idea who's going to be on tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock?

[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.260]
No.

[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:18.800]
I don't.

[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:22.920]
Everything was going along much too well.

[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.960]
So the guys missed a sports story.

[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.040]
Big stinking deal.

[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.360]
There wasn't one person in the radio audience

[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.480]
who was going to tune out WQA and my first team

[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.560]
or anybody else on the station

[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.140]
because the worst team guys missed a sports story.

[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.180]
Oh gee.

[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.100]
Just leave it alone Greg.

[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:39.940]
Quick tinkering.

[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.860]
It's like when he stuck me back at 9 to 1.

[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.400]
That's why I went seven months without taking a phone call.

[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.440]
Reading bedtime stories

[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.340]
because the format didn't work.

[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.780]
This show is no show works 9 to 1.

[00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.060]
Eight million years I did 10 to 2 and will continue to

[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:54.960]
intend to 2 by the way.

[00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:55.380]
Thank you.

[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.860]
That's when this show is on.

[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.480]
And all of a sudden I'm going to make magic.

[00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.780]
And why did that happen?

[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:03.440]
Because we brought a daughtering Moe Oman

[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.240]
and here who couldn't do four hours God forbid.

[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:09.120]
And so the show had to start at 9.

[00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:10.020]
That didn't work either.

[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.060]
So we've gone through like two years of absolute psychosis here

[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.480]
because of too much tinkering, too much dicking around.

[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.880]
Provinets after 10 at 5.60 WQAM.

[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.060]
You want to lose some weight?

[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.880]
All the fat people are desperate to lose weight.

[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.940]
Trust me when I tell you.

[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.540]
Just a content and never ends.

[00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:28.600]
It's an ever ending battle.

[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.820]
That's why it's so easy when you call my friends

[00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.780]
at balance for a lot because they make it simple for you.

[00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:33.940]
They do all the work.

[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.040]
All the calorie counting or the carb counting.

[00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.320]
You don't have to do anything other than pick up your little sack.

[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.220]
Just reach for your sack six o'clock in the morning outside your dough.

[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.480]
No cooking, no shopping, no cleaning, no worries.

[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.040]
Like I said, no carb or calorie counting.

[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.160]
They bring you a little black sack every day.

[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.480]
They deliver to you by 6 in the a.m. and right outside your door.

[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.460]
Three delicious gourmet meals.

[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:53.740]
And I really do mulee of a meenat.

[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.600]
Three gourmet meals and two delicious snacks right to your doorstep.

[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.580]
The food is all fresh and delicious made with the best ingredients

[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:00.400]
on the face of the earth.

[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.260]
And you'll start seeing that weight drop off on the scale

[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.500]
in just a matter of days.

[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.160]
And don't forget, balance for life is the only company in the universe

[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.920]
that lets you choose between two choices for every meal and snack

[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:09.560]
when you're on a program.

[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.620]
You fill out a menu once a week.

[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:12.740]
You get to choose what you like, what sounds best to you,

[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.580]
and believe me, you'll love it.

[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:16.180]
And there's plenty of food near to keep you full and satisfied all day long.

[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.200]
So if you're really tired, if you're frustrated with all that extra weight,

[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.140]
if you're out of shape, you have no energy, I can relate.

[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.680]
If you're diabetic or on a verge of it, here might be the answer you've been searching for.

[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:25.300]
Give it a try.

[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:26.400]
Balance for life.

[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:29.900]
Call them at 9-5-4-5-6-8-30-2-29.

[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.140]
Or visit them on a wicked web at balanceforlife.com.

[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.180]
We're sports radio 560, QAM.

[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.740]
And beat that gator me.

[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:53.220]
As I spread my thighs.

[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.060]
And blow myself on the toilet bowl.

[00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.980]
I feel my bowels lose control of the toilet.

[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.720]
And there's a smell of makes you cry.

[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:18.180]
So bad I can barely see my knees as I make my straightened spincter squeal.

[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.540]
It's all that's for it.

[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:28.420]
It's not a heart of all the strength in a diabetic faith, bad man.

[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.760]
If you're truly a whine's of blimping on the sea.

[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.780]
It's all God they made, bad or sick.

[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.580]
Every butter's making fun of me.

[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.560]
A patient with a fancy gaze.

[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.700]
Ever thought through a stall of a day.

[00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.680]
Ain't too presumbed at night.

[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.640]
When you do jandest sack my oldest pound.

[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.020]
The king of rock and roll on the toilet.

[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:01.340]
That's home with Yanuki.

[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:04.720]
And 18-5-60-WQAM.

[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.460]
So the rumor is that for else got another job already.

[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:09.560]
He'll be back on your Monday morning on another station in the market.

[00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:12.330]
That's just the rumor I heard in the building around.

[00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.530]
It's flying around under walls.

[00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.110]
See Scott I hate to break the news to you man.

[00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:17.650]
But you can have a different job every week.

[00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.230]
You can have 52 jobs a year or one week a piece.

[00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:23.570]
I guess if you like to travel around a lot.

[00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:25.350]
Get to know a lot of different people that way.

[00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:28.330]
Get to catch a lot of different colored paychecks.

[00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.690]
I don't get it.

[00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:31.870]
Alright let me give the poll result from yesterday and we'll get back in.

[00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.610]
By the way thanks to my close friend Rick Shaw.

[00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.050]
I am really touched by this.

[00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.050]
You are the best Rickie.

[00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.350]
See a lot of people think that Rick is just an old fart.

[00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:40.450]
What that silly hat.

[00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:40.990]
But you know what?

[00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.150]
It's a life I am not.

[00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.150]
That's right.

[00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:44.230]
He's a good guy.

[00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:46.170]
And he sends over to me.

[00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.070]
It says happy belated birthday from Rick Shaw.

[00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.850]
And it's the DVDs of the CBS 75th anniversary special from a couple of Sundays ago that I missed.

[00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.050]
I saw only last part of it.

[00:14:55.090 --> 00:14:55.850]
I mentioned that on the year.

[00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.490]
And sure enough there it is on DVD.

[00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:57.990]
No less.

[00:14:58.130 --> 00:14:58.510]
Thank you Rick.

[00:14:58.670 --> 00:14:59.490]
I really appreciate that.

[00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:01.350]
I'm going to watch it over and over again.

[00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:03.510]
What a good guy.

[00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.030]
Anyway here's the poll result.

[00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.390]
We asked yesterday what pro or college coach or manager was the absolute worst of all time.

[00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.570]
I still don't care about sports.

[00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:13.050]
Schmuck.

[00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:13.810]
309.

[00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:14.690]
That's a message to me.

[00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:15.810]
They don't give a crap about sports.

[00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:16.290]
Okay.

[00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:23.090]
26.7% of this audience don't give a flying crap about sports and they want to make sure that I and all the rest of you understand that.

[00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:23.690]
Okay good.

[00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:25.570]
Dave wants that 199.

[00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.790]
Not doing too good Dave.

[00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:28.970]

Speaking of the Tigers.

[00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:47.950]
I mean the Alliance same difference.

[00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:50.230]
They blow both teams think Wayne finds 30.

[00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:51.310]

Ocee Had the Big.

[00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.150]
You didn't have any.

[00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:31.810]
See, I always wonder about that.

[00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.870]
Why do people call and vote?

[00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.810]
Maybe they don't have a computer.

[00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.510]
They nominate somebody for the poll and they never vote for them.

[00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.050]
All right, here's the two articles about Pharrell getting canned.

[00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:44.750]
Barry Jackass writes in the, of course, Barry's got his head up Greg's a butt.

[00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.090]
Barry writes.

[00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:48.410]
WQM gives Pharrell the boot.

[00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.410]
WQM on Wednesday fired a morning host Scott Pharrell after he repeatedly crossed the line

[00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.750]
with offensive commentary, station general manager Greg Reed said.

[00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.450]
We tried to convey to him things he couldn't say on a radio, such as things that are sexually offensive

[00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:01.970]
Reed said.

[00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:07.830]
We had him sign a document late September early October and he violated an unlimited number of times, including Wednesday.

[00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:11.770]
I don't know if he worked at a level of FCC violations, but we were uncomfortable with it.

[00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:17.050]
We tried to lead him into doing a funny sports oriented show and he kept going places we didn't want him to go.

[00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.070]
We got tired of banging our heads against the wall.

[00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.790]
I feel like I failed that I couldn't get through to the guy.

[00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:23.550]
We were number one in the summer ratings books.

[00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.410]
I feel terrible about doing this Greg says, but to live by the integrity of the agreement we had to do this.

[00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.190]
Do you really believe he feels terrible about doing it?

[00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:30.370]
No.

[00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:35.650]
Pharrell who joined WQM on May 22nd said he was very disappointed about being fired.

[00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.630]
No one will ever get a five, six year in Edmark in the first ratings book like I did.

[00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.150]
He said, I love the fans in my job. It's a bummer for me.

[00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:44.870]
He said it was very disappointed.

[00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.270]
Now was he actually surprised?

[00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.390]
Because he's your best, the close personal buddy.

[00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.030]
Was he surprised?

[00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.810]
I don't think so.

[00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:51.210]
Oh.

[00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.870]
No, well disappointed and surprised aren't the same.

[00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:58.770]
Reed said more than a dozen advertisers transferred ads from Pharrell showed other programs on the station,

[00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:00.550]
but said that wasn't a fact when his dismissal.

[00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:06.250]
Reed said he might again pursue NBC anchor and former WQM morning host Joe Rose for the 8th to 10 AM slot.

[00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.890]
Previously held by Pharrell.

[00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.890]
He also stated considered WQM's Orlando El Zagiri.

[00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.370]
No, no, no, no, no.

[00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.890]
And candidates outside the station.

[00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.950]
Did he actually say the big, he just was just joking when he said that very.

[00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.150]
No.

[00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:20.390]
He was a nice, a smart, nice, when he said that.

[00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:25.110]
Reed ruled out returning how were David and Steve Goldstein to the 6 to 10 AM slot.

[00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:29.550]
They were moved to 5 to 8 AM when Pharrell was hired and they're staying right there.

[00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.730]
Deep in the morning hours where there can't be too dangerous.

[00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:36.870]
And the article by Tom Jikyll actually wrote an article about radio.

[00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:37.730]
Nice going, Tom A.

[00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:40.470]
Even though it appeared in the sports section in the Sun Sentinel.

[00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.030]
Tom finally decided he would let his hair down.

[00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.230]
Well, WQM fires Pharrell for off-color remarks.

[00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:48.990]
It says by Tom Jikyll.

[00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:54.250]
Controversial sports host Scott Pharrell is in a familiar position over the line and out of work.

[00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.270]
WQM fired Pharrell on Wednesday after repeated warnings to tone down the sexual, to tone done.

[00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:01.750]
It says, on your done, Tom.

[00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:07.630]
To tone done, the sexual content of his program, which heirs from 8 to 10 AM while aired in the past.

[00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.410]
So I think you aired, Tom.

[00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.450]
Pharrell made frequent disparaging remarks on the air about restraints he had been placed under.

[00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:18.950]
Nevertheless, he continued the spices show with risque remarks, which pushed the station's patience to the limit.

[00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.990]
Wednesday, the patience ran out.

[00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:26.930]
Pharrell boasted that he lost another job as play by play, unanswered the Atlanta thrashes for an off-color remark during a game.

[00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:33.530]
Ironically, the Boca resident lost his last job at New York's W&EWFM because of sexual antics he had nothing to do with.

[00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.750]
A stunt by Shock Jock's Opian Anthony had a couple making love in St. Patrick's Cathedral.

[00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.650]
The public opera was so strong that the station abandoned its top form at blowing out the entire staff.

[00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:49.830]
Pharrell known for his gravelly voice and nothing is sacred style, joined WQM in May as a fill-in.

[00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:55.170]
His brash, irreverent style connected with the audience, so the station changed its line up to carve out a tour block form.

[00:19:55.530 --> 00:20:00.790]
Now see, Tom, you're absolutely, well, I mean, I can't debate that because we have no evidence to indicate that's true or not.

[00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.590]
It probably is true, but it's just you're surmising that. That isn't the reason he was put on there.

[00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:08.510]
The reason he was put on there, eight to ten, is because Greg Reed was obsessed with Pharrell.

[00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.690]
Oh, he's the greatest thing. That's what I'm hearing.

[00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:11.290]
Okay?

[00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:18.730]
So the idea that, you know, being on tour three shows on a weekend and all of a sudden the audience is obsessed is a little bit over the top, Tom.

[00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:20.370]
But then again, you write a lot of crap anyway.

[00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:27.190]
Anyway, going back to Tom's article, he says, this is one of the most amusing things I've ever read in my life.

[00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:36.310]
There was an ominous portent the morning his program was to debut lightning hit the station's transmitter and knocked WQM off the air delay his official debut by a day.

[00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.090]
See, I never thought about it. I remember that day very well.

[00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:45.430]
And I remember wondering, are we ever going to get to think back on the air again and his entire show?

[00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:51.310]
So we did a little crossover with him. In fact, we did a show on the internet together that day during which we could say whatever the hell we want and we did.

[00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:56.910]
And we did it everywhere that's ever been invented because luckily, unfortunately, so far the FCC don't regulate what's on the internet.

[00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.890]
And certain OJAMPRAVACATURES out there can't control what is on the internet. Maybe I'll just do a show on the internet.

[00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.470]
WQM is not announced how it will fill the slot. Jim Mandage who hosted 2 to 4 p.m. program.

[00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:10.070]
Oh, right!

[00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:14.810]
And Joe Rose formerly one of the morning hosts have been approached but neither has said to be enthused about the early morning shift.

[00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:19.130]
I'm weren't enthused. Come on, guys. Mix and match. How about every other day?

[00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:26.070]
Rose works until almost midnight at Channel 6 and Mandage has his own construction company which he breaks from in mid-day to his program.

[00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:38.890]
So it just makes sense to me that rather than breaking the middle of the continuity of his show, his work during the day time, start out 8 to 10 here and then go off to the office, take care of a couple of construction jobs, fill out a few forums, sign a checks, and then go home and screw off all afternoon.

[00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:43.350]
Other solutions would be to extend Howard David till 10 a.m.

[00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:50.030]
Or restore the pre-for-real lineup with David from 6 to 9 a.m. when the O'Rodgers would take over.

[00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:58.850]
However, Rogers, these stations biggest ratings and revenue generator, prefers a 10 a.m. start. And you know what time, finally...

[00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.170]
Absolutely correct.

[00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.110]
...find a got one right. This show is staying right where it is, right where it belongs 10 to 2.

[00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:11.390]
That's the Neo-Rodgers show, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. what happens around it behind it in front of it. That's their story. That's up to them.

[00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:14.890]
Although I will say that the big ain't doin' 8 to 10.

[00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:20.270]
Good guy, like I said, and then there are a lot of good guys, like the thing with Farahela, like him a lot. He's a good guy.

[00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.650]
But he's his own worst enemy. And so he's got another job starting on Monday and then maybe a couple weeks after that he'll have another one.

[00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:28.170]
You've got to start listening, baby. You just can't...

[00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:34.670]
When you continue convincing yourself that the rest of the world is all crazy and you're the one that's saying, then there's a problem there somewhere, you know?

[00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:40.090]
Sooner or later you have to like put the ego aside and say, okay, we can't do this. We can't play Condoleza.

[00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:47.010]
We can't say this on the air, whatever. And we want to get to paycheck. You know? What's more important, the ego, or getting to paycheck and having a livelihood?

[00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:55.030]
And when you get to a certain point in life, hopefully for most of us we say, well, you know, when you're younger you like fight the good fight and you're always...

[00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.930]
But you reach your point where like survival becomes the most important thing.

[00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:01.450]
Stickin' at checkin' the bank, the biscuit and the basket.

[00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:10.370]
27 after 10 at 5, 60 WQM if you're trying to stick some hair on your head like maybe paste a little on a little pages glue which it looks like a lot of guys have done.

[00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:15.330]
I'll tell you if that's good, since it's ain't using like crazy glue then my name is Mohawar David.

[00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:23.810]
And speaking of bad hair pieces, there's another example. If you want to look good, if you want to look younger and better than you ever really thought you could again, you ought to talk to my buddy Charles Alfieri.

[00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:34.870]
That's what he's been on the show for a zillion years. In fact, for over 25 years he's been working with a famous and not so famous, with a rich and not so rich and the even sluppers like you guys because it's an affordable hair system.

[00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:41.130]
The natural hairline system. It looks real like it's real hair growing out of your scalp as opposed to all the other stuff which I don't have to tell you what it looks like.

[00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:47.810]
It looks like straw, it looks like muskrat died on your head, it looks like hell is what it looks like. So if you want to look good and younger like it's the real thing.

[00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:54.430]
And I have people laugh at your ass, call Charles Alfieri, you have nothing to lose but the ball spot because everybody gets Charlie's 30-day guarantee.

[00:23:54.710 --> 00:24:00.330]
If after a month you don't love the way it looks and feels and smells, if you're not getting all the action you can handle in and some, return it for a full refund.

[00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:06.790]
Be sure to mention the Arigis when you call me is an extra $200 discount. Call toll free 1-800-321-2413.

[00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:12.530]
1-800-321-2413 or log onto that website, Charles Alfieri.com.

[00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.550]
This is 20-0-560.

[00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:18.890]
You way up.

[00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:21.430]
It's a bitch.

[00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.510]
Yeah.

[00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.750]
There's a spread my thighs.

[00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:32.490]
Yeah I did. I did.

[00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:38.270]
But you know something, that's another reason I prefer not being here is because there's too much crap going on. There are too many people in and out of here.

[00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:42.330]
This is a freaking circus. This ain't a radio station, boys and girls. This is a circus.

[00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:49.030]
I haven't got time to wipe my ass much less like Elvis. I just got through. I did that yesterday too. I do that maybe once a year.

[00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:51.730]
Once every two years. I've done it twice in two days now.

[00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:58.630]
Don't come in here unless you have a check for abandoned pet rescue. Do not come in through that door.

[00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.670]
Don't come in here.

[00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.890]
Okay. What?

[00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.230]
Don't eat in here either.

[00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:09.230]
And okay. This is not the guy named cafeteria in here. We got a cafeteria down the hallway a little bit.

[00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:13.570]
Don't come in here to sit and fill your fat faces and believe me, I do mean fat. Let's hear that again.

[00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:15.510]
I still feel the toilet pool.

[00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.950]
I can't believe it.

[00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.330]
So, anyway, here's... and you know something?

[00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:24.750]
I'm motivated for a second pool later in the day, which I don't think Eric's going to be too happy about.

[00:25:24.810 --> 00:25:26.630]
But that's the way it goes there. It'll be short and sweet.

[00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:32.110]
First pool for this morning in the wake of all this crap going on.

[00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:37.330]
What's the biggest screw up that WQM has made in the last two years? That's our first pool. Oh, it's already on there.

[00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:46.390]
Hiring for well, firing for well, blowing out the first team, hiring Mohawar Davided, putting the Ilan 9-1 or letting the crow get away.

[00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:47.630]
Huh?

[00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:51.290]
Lending the crow get away. That was some heavy duty stuff.

[00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:55.070]
5-6-7. Oh, 8-5-60.

[00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.470]
Oh, we sure missed that. He'd put us over the top, baby. The crow.

[00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:03.610]
See, that's another classic example of Greg Reed at work. I really believe that this guy belongs on the air.

[00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.270]
Even to say hello to Crow. Although, we sure smell pretty.

[00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.710]
So, you see some warm trot bar problems? Right.

[00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:13.490]
Okay, I'm going to cast my vote on here. Let's see. I think that one.

[00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:19.130]
So, you can cast your vote. Then the second pool I'm going to do later is, who would you like? Don't you think it makes sense?

[00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.010]
Who would you like to have do 8-10?

[00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.030]
It's a valid question.

[00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:30.510]
No, seriously, I think that makes sense to me. Pull number two. But at least Eric, you won't have to add too much to any of these.

[00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.210]
I don't think. They'll be like straight up straight down.

[00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:38.470]
Who would you like to see? Do. And then of course, there'll be the crowd. We don't care. We won't listen. I'll put that one together.

[00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:39.790]
We don't give a crap.

[00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.010]
5-6-7. And I also want to say this to you. I have never, well, I won't say never.

[00:26:45.010 --> 00:26:48.430]
But it's so typical of South Florida. So, I actually have heard it many times.

[00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:54.150]
God gets canned. And I'm driving in this morning. I didn't hear more than goodness because I understand that he let a lot of people rip an ass.

[00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:58.210]
Which, if you want to, that's fine. But I mean, it's just a nature of the beast.

[00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.690]
Not the beast per se. Not our beast, but just in general, the generic beast.

[00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:08.830]
Somebody gets canned. Oh, gee, when you're so great, bow, and you know, you're a real moral person.

[00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:13.570]
And we've got to get that immorality off the air. And all this other crap. Just ripping a guy when he gets his ass canned.

[00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:18.530]
It's so frickin' typical, man. And that's one, another reason why this town sucks the way it does.

[00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.410]
It's just, it's just so many nasty, hateful, brutal, miserable people.

[00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:25.890]
Mean, mean-spirited, hateful, angry, nasty, rotten.

[00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:32.050]
5-6-7.0560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[00:27:32.290 --> 00:27:36.310]
That check coming yet for $790 to give us to 40 grand for abandoned pet rescue to come in yet.

[00:27:36.370 --> 00:27:42.850]
No, no, I haven't seen it. I haven't seen it. Don't open that dough unless you got more money for abandoned pet rescue.

[00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.110]
You hear what I'm saying? I got your crow-bottocks right here, homeboy. Good, good man.

[00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:50.250]
And by the way, go home and take a bath at the Talcum Powder starting to really stink.

[00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.450]
Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello.

[00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.450]
69. I'll be able to buy $1150 and I'm going to go back to the Fort House. All of the best, take care.

[00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.410]
Did we interrupt this guy on another call?

[00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.010]
Hello. Was that a hot call that we interrupted there?

[00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:06.590]
Hello? Yeah.

[00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:09.970]
Yes, sir. Oh, I just wanted to call them, sir. I'm sorry.

[00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.070]
Were you on the other line?

[00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.730]
Yes, I'm sorry. I was very apologize. I was walking back from my car with the phone.

[00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:16.470]
That's okay.

[00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:22.050]
My question is, I support everything you say. They do a big proponent of free speech.

[00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:29.630]
Yeah. And you would have made your pretty outrageous. But what could it for Ella said that's more anything more outrageous that you do on your show, which I support?

[00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.770]
Not even close. Not even close.

[00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.030]
Right. That's the hypocrisy with that station.

[00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:37.990]
No, no, no, you don't understand. You're not listening. You didn't get the answer.

[00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.810]
His stuff was so far over the line and I try to, we all try to explain to them.

[00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:45.250]
There's a way to do things where you know where the line is when you do this for a living.

[00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:48.790]
You know where, where you can go and how far you can go. He has no line.

[00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:54.670]
So think, but didn't you beat your censor that I knew or cut off and said?

[00:28:55.070 --> 00:29:00.630]
In fact, that's another thing is that they were sitting on the dump button and they're like crazy for a long time from once now.

[00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.230]
And evidently, there were sometimes that it didn't get believed.

[00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:07.610]
In fact, I'm wondering how come the person who didn't believe it yesterday morning when he did the crossover with Moe,

[00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:10.550]
how come that person didn't get fired? Who must have naked pictures here, Robert?

[00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.970]
Because there was something he did yesterday, which I think was the straw to broke a camel's back,

[00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.170]
that should have been dumped and shouldn't have gotten on the ear and maybe he'd still be here.

[00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:22.130]
But you know, there are some people here who have evidently have, I don't know what the deal is.

[00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.210]
They're here forever. They have a lifetime contract.

[00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:26.430]
It's because he's walking in your studio, isn't he?

[00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.430]
Exactly. Have a great day and don't do that again on the other line.

[00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:33.950]
Now, so you don't try to make a comparison because that's what Scott was always trying to do.

[00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.650]
Wow, you can't buy me. No, I don't.

[00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:43.710]
No, I don't. And if you listen, I mean, there's a way you can do things and be clever about it and be creative and be funny and did not go way over that line.

[00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.990]
And I mean way over that line and then there are other stuff, just blurred it out. When it doubt, blurred it out.

[00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:54.030]
And it's not necessary. That's the saddest part. It isn't necessary.

[00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.190]
There wasn't one more person listening to that show between 8 and 10 because of the fact that he went over the line.

[00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:06.310]
If he would have just done, you know, he'd been a crazy guy and done a sports thing and been funny without going way over that line, it had been just fine.

[00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:08.570]
But I don't know if he's capable of doing it.

[00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:13.890]
How many firings is this now? Do you have a keeping track? Do you have like a diary that you guys keep?

[00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.190]
You can't count that high.

[00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:17.090]
About 30.

[00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:24.230]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5. Look at that. 77 votes on it. We just put the poll up.

[00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:29.390]
What's the biggest screw up that WQM has made in the last two years? Take a look at that.

[00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:31.950]
We're going to get a lot of votes on this baby. I'll tell you.

[00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:35.050]
Moe hiring Moe Howard David is leading with 33 votes.

[00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.550]
Absolutely.

[00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:42.650]
Firing for L-26, blowing out the first team 15, letting the Crogate away 10.

[00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:49.210]
Oh, putting the L-9 to 1-9 and hiring for L-2 out of 95 votes now.

[00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:50.930]
Boy, they're pouring in on this baby.

[00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.110]
You might set a record.

[00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:56.430]
Well, we might just set a record. I might have to leave this up the whole...

[00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.170]
No, I don't think so, though, because I want to get the other one.

[00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.710]
And maybe one o'clock we'll put the other one on there. Who would you like 8-10?

[00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.310]
Now we do it tomorrow instead.

[00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.730]
Like I said, it's a great idea for tomorrow.

[00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.510]
Well, we'll see. We'll see how the other thing flies.

[00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.410]
Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:10.770]
Neil.

[00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:11.330]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:14.650]
Hey, I've been out of town. Is this me and the George has gone to?

[00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:15.170]
No.

[00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:19.790]
What's George got to do with Ferella? Is this just the chronic George basher? Is that what you are?

[00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:22.710]
No, actually, I'm not. But I couldn't be if you'd like me to be here.

[00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:26.110]
Well, what does that have to do with what we're talking about? Do you understand how stupid that is?

[00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:31.490]
No, it was just just one of my lame comments.

[00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.450]
A lame is right. You're right.

[00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:34.450]
You finally got something right. It was lame.

[00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.610]
5-6-7-0-5-6-0. I get blown out of here.

[00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:41.450]
And what is this guy want to do? Start picking on George who's on vacation this week.

[00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.030]
I mean, George don't care. Neither do I.

[00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:44.630]
We don't give a crap.

[00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:47.630]
But it's just stupid is what it is, pal. It's really stupid, ain't it?

[00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.530]
Absolutely. Sure.

[00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.790]
5-6-7-0-5-6-0. It's like everything else.

[00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:54.930]
They can't follow the bouncing balls here in this town. It's just so amazingly.

[00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:00.430]
I got to write that book. I really do. But nobody would believe it.

[00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:04.710]
Just about doing talk radio in this town for nearly about 30 years.

[00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:09.110]
And the stuff that comes in on the other end of the phone and the people...

[00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:11.970]
Oh, you're awful. And the people out of fax machine that hate you like poison.

[00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:14.890]
They're every minute of every day they thrive.

[00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:18.690]
The day that I hang up this microphone, they're not going to know whether to scream or peel or banana.

[00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:19.770]
They're not going to know what they'll do.

[00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:22.270]
They don't have any clue what they're going to be doing.

[00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.850]
They're already planning trying to figure out what it's going to be.

[00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.790]
They're going to be filling up their desperate lives with.

[00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:32.850]
You think the numbers on this show are good. Can you imagine if we get credit for all the closet listeners?

[00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:38.850]
You know, once upon a time they talked about having those sensors where they could dragsly...

[00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:41.650]
Of course, ash croffle were like that. They could drive up and down neighborhoods.

[00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:45.990]
And they could detect what stations, what frequency radios were tuned to.

[00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:47.530]
Scary. Yeah, right.

[00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.090]
Like I said, ash croffle would love it.

[00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:54.590]
But I mean, that was one of the ideas they come up with to try to figure out as opposed to the current rating system.

[00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.750]
So that people who love, for example, hate me like poison, but we'll never write it down.

[00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:00.850]
Listen every day. We can actually add them in there.

[00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:02.490]
Get double digits every rating book.

[00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.010]
Am I right about that?

[00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.550]
Absolutely.

[00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:11.310]
And I'll say this, even though it pains me to say it, I guarantee a mole would probably get some extra...

[00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:12.470]
...dye reason there too.

[00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.250]
No, you know it, because there are people who hate him like poison, like me, and although I don't listen to him.

[00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:23.450]
The only time I ever hear the Sunday's voice is the first minute when I'm in Toronto when I open up the pot,

[00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.750]
and then you'll notice I immediately open up City Post 24 audio so I can't hear him, and you'll know that I'm there.

[00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:30.130]
Then I'm, you know, taking a shower and whatever else begins with SH.

[00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:32.150]
And that's it.

[00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.170]
And then coming to work here in the morning, which this morning I heard that terminally ponderous interview with the assistant UM football coach.

[00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.710]
Oh man, was that bad? That was so weak mo.

[00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.590]
It's 20 before 11 at 560.

[00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.390]
Mo is leading the way. I think we've all watched.

[00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.030]
It's close. Firing referrals got 33.

[00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.570]
And hiring Mo has got 36.

[00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:53.910]
Blowing out the first team, 26.

[00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.810]
But see, that was the straw that broke the whole place's back.

[00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:58.250]
That opened up this whole can of worms.

[00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.090]
We never would be where we are today if Greg wouldn't have like overreacted and gotten carried away.

[00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:06.950]
I mean, it's really something when you're fire guy who already told he is leaving.

[00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:09.090]
Oh, well, guess what? If you're leaving, you're fired.

[00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.250]
Like a pectulent little child.

[00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.710]
Did Greg come in with $790 check yet for a band of pet rescue?

[00:34:15.810 --> 00:34:15.910]
No.

[00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.150]
I mean, he's in the building. He don't come anywhere near here, man.

[00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:20.110]
This is the fourth day I've been here this week.

[00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:21.550]
Hasn't come anywhere near yours truly.

[00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:22.870]
And you want to know why?

[00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.590]
Because he knows that I know.

[00:34:25.630 --> 00:34:28.210]
I know. You're not fooling me, Greg.

[00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:36.230]

GELDI. GELDI.

[00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.450]
Talking on a sports show.

[00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:04.230]
Trying to be my show.

[00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:10.230]
Your voice sounds just like a sad, thin, year old girl.

[00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.010]
A little sports whole show.

[00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:18.910]

Why can't you understand?

[00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:30.110]
You don't sound like a man.

[00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:34.330]
Remove the rubber bands that choke.

[00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.170]
Your stroke comes GELDI.

[00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:43.270]

[00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:48.890]
GELDI.

[00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:52.910]
You don't belong there on the air.

[00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:54.610]
And GELDI.

[00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:58.350]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks.

[00:36:58.870 --> 00:37:03.850]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job.

[00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:09.490]
And they should only take you back when both your babies drop.

[00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.590]
GELDI. GELDI.

[00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.830]

You'll make us want to grow up.

[00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.690]
You'll feel these squeaky pooh.

[00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:27.930]
Boys, thank you.

[00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.530]
Sound like a hug.

[00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.690]
A rascal.

[00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:33.430]
You're a hug.

[00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.270]
You're a hug.

[00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.590]
Can there be anything about that?

[00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:41.930]
14 before, level 5, 60 WQM.

[00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.690]
Now what do we got today?

[00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.690]
Two o'clock, the Amad Dog is still in Arizona schedule.

[00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:46.170]
Thank the Lord for that.

[00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:49.090]
Four o'clock, you got to hump her at these Seminole Indians.

[00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.410]
Good luck to you out there, Hank.

Boy, they are the Devils.

[00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:02.310]
They are the Devils.

[00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.070]
They're the Antichrist of the Hockey World.

[00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.150]
The style that they play.

[00:38:06.290 --> 00:38:07.530]
Put you into a total coma.

[00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:09.530]
739, Eddie Camp of the Hockey Game.

[00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.270]
Jo and Mark, they're still around 2 to 5 in the morning.

[00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:13.030]
And then of course, we know who follows that.

[00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:13.930]
You know, they got to what?

[00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:14.670]
Yeah, look.

[00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.370]
Yeah, 188 in, by the way, nice job ripping your good close personal friendmo.

[00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:19.750]
For three hours.

[00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:24.870]
188 votes, what's the biggest screw up QA was made in the past two years?

[00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.230]
Hiring Mo-Hower, Davided.

[00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:29.330]
57 votes is in first place.

[00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:30.370]
How do you like that?

[00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:31.130]
Absolutely.

[00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:33.530]
Firing for L53, Rod on Moses.

[00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.070]
Blowing out the first team, 35.

[00:38:36.610 --> 00:38:38.110]
Letting the Crow get away, 19.

[00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.690]
Putting Neal on 9 to 1.

[00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.150]

[00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:43.770]
And firing for L9 out of 188 so far.

[00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.990]
Or hiring.

[00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:46.190]
What did I say that I read it wrong?

[00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:47.170]
Hiring for L9.

[00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:49.430]
So that's what you got.

[00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:51.210]
Later on, we'll do the pull between 1 and 2 o'clock.

[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.930]
We'll stick it on there.

[00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.230]
Who would you like to have between 8 and 10?

[00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:56.750]
I think the mad dog is a perfect fit in there.

[00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.350]
I don't want to let campaign on the air for it.

[00:38:58.930 --> 00:38:59.470]
You know what I'm saying?

[00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:00.050]
Oh, right.

[00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:01.050]
I think it's a perfect fit.

[00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:02.330]
Then Hank goes back to 2 to 6.

[00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:03.230]
And that makes sense to you.

[00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:07.210]
I mean, you don't have to get up that early to do 8 to 10.

[00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:07.690]
You know?

[00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.550]
630, crawling here about 740, 735, right?

[00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:14.610]
Yeah, I guess he doesn't look too far away.

[00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:14.850]
Does he?

[00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:16.190]
Yeah, it gets out of your 10 o'clock.

[00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:17.570]
Goes over to construction company.

[00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:19.990]
Like I said, signs the paychecks, writes the signs of you.

[00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.050]
Go deals, contracts.

[00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.470]
Stuff's about to cash in his wallet.

[00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:27.430]
Heads over to the golf course for a few green lizards.

[00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.010]
And then goes home and consorts with the lady for the rest of the day.

[00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:32.110]
And maybe his wife too.

[00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.630]
So there you go.

[00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:35.230]
There's a little, just my suggestion.

[00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.510]
Mo and Geldie, they seem to have found their niche.

[00:39:37.530 --> 00:39:39.870]
You know, like really buried, I mean, 5-8 in the morning.

[00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:42.070]
When it's real dark outside.

[00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.810]
And then 8 to 10 to mad dog, yours truly 10 to 2.

[00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:47.810]
2 to 4 we got, I mean, 2 to 6 Hank, which is what he always did anyway.

[00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.810]
4 hours better, buck up a little bit.

[00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.450]
And what I'm hearing, you bucked up pretty good already.

[00:39:54.010 --> 00:39:56.330]
And then say they can throw anything in 6 to 7.

[00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.510]
It's 8 10 hour in his business, especially in this market.

[00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:59.490]
6 to 7.

[00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:03.290]
We can have like rotating sports nerds in there, clearance one night, the beast the next night,

[00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.870]
even like anybody, you know?

[00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:07.650]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.930]
Hello.

[00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:09.410]
Any else?

[00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:09.910]
Yes, sir.

[00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:14.170]
Yes, firing your buddy there.

[00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:18.630]
And if you don't like it, you want to go back to Canadian fact Toronto country.

[00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.030]
What does that have to do with anything?

[00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:23.690]
Because you don't like it here.

[00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:24.710]
Yeah, I don't.

[00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:25.430]
I am going back.

[00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:28.050]
I'll be back very soon, asshole, to my fact Canadian country.

[00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:28.290]
What?

[00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:30.010]
Again, what does that have to do with anything?

[00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.490]
This is your own material, man.

[00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:33.730]
Listen to yourselves.

[00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:34.970]
Listen to what you got.

[00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:35.550]
You know what it is?

[00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:37.550]
That's why I'm getting out of here again very soon.

[00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.090]
To my fag country.

[00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:40.850]
Thank God there's no fags down here.

[00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:41.510]
Right.

[00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.450]
Except for what it's just called.

[00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.230]
He's probably got a handle on the soap so we don't drop it.

[00:40:47.250 --> 00:40:51.710]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, pound 5, 6, just like I said, a lot of angry.

[00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:57.270]
You're a part of the reason, sir, that a lot of people hated here is because there's so many people just like you.

[00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:03.850]
Misurable, nasty, rotten, disgusting, and hateful people, assholes like you.

[00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:05.010]
And have a great day.

[00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.850]
Here's Miami.

[00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:07.230]
Hello.

[00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:09.850]
That's why Moffit's in here so good.

[00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.190]
It's a place for miserable old cockers like him and he loves it.

[00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:12.670]
It's paradise.

[00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:13.330]
Yes, sir.

[00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:14.490]
How are you, Anthony?

[00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:14.890]
Pretty good?

[00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.610]
I just wanted to weigh in on the for all thing.

[00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:18.150]
Go right ahead.

[00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.850]
Way away.

[00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.790]
I'm a Cuban Julio.

[00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:29.250]
And I think a lot of the audience that doesn't listen, not that I could say listen to it, but my wife listens a little bit to the Latin radio.

[00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:30.090]
Oh, God.

[00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:31.650]
Let me tell you something.

[00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:38.830]
Yeah, some of the things these guys say on the morning shows make Forell look like Disney Landle.

[00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.050]
Yeah.

[00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:41.390]
So this is bullcrap.

[00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.050]
I mean, these are disturbing trend patterns.

[00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:46.610]
First, the kind of a Lisa crap.

[00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:49.450]
And now it's like you told a great read months ago.

[00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.730]
If you're going to put, I mean, why did you bring him here?

[00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:52.890]
If you knew what he was about.

[00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.670]
Well, that's right.

[00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:55.330]
And I'm glad you reminded me of that.

[00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:59.250]
Why did he put him on the ear when he already knows what his act is and even can't afford to meet another place?

[00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:03.770]
Why would you put him on when you know what he does and when you know we've got professional agitators in this town,

[00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:06.250]
or just sitting out there waiting to pounce on this?

[00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:08.550]
It's a Greg read another error, man.

[00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:09.430]
Big time.

[00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:16.210]
And what I liked about him is that he actually knew sports when he wanted to talk about sports, but he would talk about other things and say crazy stuff.

[00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:16.570]
Yeah.

[00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.250]
But it was really refreshing.

[00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.750]
I mean, I mean, I'm in the hours of straight sports.

[00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.630]
I mean, I'm a sports hole, but I mean, give me a break.

[00:42:23.730 --> 00:42:24.830]
Yeah, so much straight sports.

[00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:25.610]
Yeah.

[00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:29.430]
So I could have I was surprised by it.

[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:34.270]
I thought he was not going to I thought he was going to make the year, but not here.

[00:42:35.610 --> 00:42:36.370]
Good luck to you, pal.

[00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.970]
I had a great day.

[00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:37.230]
Okay.

[00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.330]
Here's the fact that says I have to fight a life of eight to ten now.

[00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:41.830]
Don't get me wrong.

[00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.630]
I'm not a sport hole.

[00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.210]
I find sports ready to be extremely boring.

[00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:47.350]
In the case of WQM, two narrow and variety of sports discussed.

[00:42:48.330 --> 00:42:50.230]
Scott was the anti-Christive sports talk host.

[00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:52.870]
I listen to him daily in spite of the beast because he told it the way it is.

[00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.350]
I really hope another local station hires him and schedules him from five till eight.

[00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:59.970]
I don't think he wants to get up at four in the morning or three if they're out thing wants to do that.

[00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:01.630]
Where is he going to be on?

[00:43:04.530 --> 00:43:05.730]
In his shower, I guess.

[00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:06.710]
No, no, where is he?

[00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.870]
You already know you got to know what Stacy's going to be on other station on Monday.

[00:43:11.090 --> 00:43:12.350]
Supposedly he's got another gig in town.

[00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:12.950]
Where's it going to be?

[00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.570]
You can tell us.

[00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:14.770]
I have no idea.

[00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.810]
Yes, you know, that's now why would you say that?

[00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:18.070]
You know that that's not true.

[00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.910]
The two of you guys take showers together in the morning.

[00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:21.390]
I mean, let's face it.

[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:28.470]
My soap has the handle is I'm sure that and when you're showering with him, I understand why five six seven oh five sixty.

[00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:37.550]
Pound five sixty on the eight TNT and Verizon wireless line as we've got you know something we got as keep as this company is we got a whole outfit in here of people.

[00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:42.270]
We have to get dry concepts and do to clean the carpets because the stain on the carpets in this place are unbelievable.

[00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.930]
Those ugly brown stains they're all over the building.

[00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:48.310]
You know what I mean?

[00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.950]
Absolutely.

[00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:50.450]
230 votes.

[00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:59.030]
What's the biggest screw up QMS made last two years hiring for well only twelve putting Neil on nine to one eighteen so you're not that nine to one didn't work it was a death mill.

[00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:01.250]
Letting the crow get away twenty eight.

[00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:06.370]
At least they still have kept their sense of human. That's a good sign.

[00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:11.350]
Letting the crow get away that was the point at which we just lost it.

[00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.910]
I like that.

[00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:21.870]
I'm blowing at the first team thirty seven firing for well sixty five and hiring Mo Howard David it seems to be I don't know I thought that far ahead but it's un-catchable with seventy votes so far.

[00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:28.070]
And local see I'm just I'm losing it this week I'm coming on glue from being in this place can't handle it.

[00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:30.350]
I have to go back to Canada with all them fags.

[00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:33.190]
Here's a call from for Lauderdale hello.

[00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.490]

You want to go back on hold?

[00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:40.870]
No.

[00:44:41.810 --> 00:44:42.810]
It could be arranged.

[00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.690]

[00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:57.150]

Well on the stick it on zip it.

That's enough okay you're not going to pond off all your guy then promos and you know all that crap you got going on this show enough of that.

[00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:44.050]
Yeah I bet there's more all the crap that we're going to pedal on for real show now that bringing in here because they know Kimber had no audience.

[00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:47.090]
I'm sorry Kim good guy but oh here's the curl spring.

[00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:54.070]
Hello. Hey don't know pretty good sir what's up. I'm up from New York to listen to whenever I'm down here but I got the perfect replacement for for real.

[00:46:54.170 --> 00:47:05.190]
Yeah. Ron Feds. Ron Feds. Yeah you have to be kidding me. I love those guys. Yeah. Ron and Feds. Ron and Feds. No chance. Come on.

[00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:11.450]
No way Jose. You could do it. Let me say give me your one word answer. No. 5 6 7 0 5 60.

[00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:17.730]
This is a sports station. Mr. you better get your priorities straight now. It's a sports station. We take showers together here.

[00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:25.410]
We wear jog straps to bed at night here. Ron and Feds wouldn't even get a bed that early. Ron and Feds my fat ass okay but thank you so much.

[00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:32.530]
And go back to New York. 5 6 7 0 5 60. We got to that. Look if you see any response like this. That's in a half an hour.

[00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:39.770]
This pulled in go under to like about 10 25. I think we should keep it up for the day. Okay. And the pull two.

[00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:47.550]
257 votes. What's the biggest screw up WQM is man. Let's see. Well after the break I got to do the break.

[00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:53.130]
But I want to elaborate on these people who think that there are experts on broadcasting because it's not all one side.

[00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:59.630]
And like I said if the guy would have toned it down for a while and helped us to you know get to a certain point here we could have we could have made this thing work.

[00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:07.570]
I'm sure that. But he wouldn't do it. So you can talk about well how this one does this and that one says that but the bottom line is it doesn't work that way.

[00:48:07.570 --> 00:48:15.570]
This station's license is up for renewal and when you got professional agitators out there trying to like you know devious a crap which they've done to me and other people in the past.

[00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:27.950]
You just have to total line for a while. And when somebody refuses to do that and puts your license in jeopardy nobody including me or a Howard Stern anybody else is that good that people are to say all well and hell with it nobody.

[00:48:31.250 --> 00:48:46.450]
257 the biggest screw up that WQM has made in these last two years the worst F up hiring Mo Howard David 78 votes absolutely firing for all 71 blowing out the first team 41 letting the Crogue it away 32.

[00:48:48.190 --> 00:49:00.110]
Putting Neal on 9 to 1 12 and hiring for only 13. They liked him Greg they liked him and believe me I'm not I'm not coming down on the side of for all I miss because he was he was an untenable position.

[00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:05.130]
You tell somebody don't do it and you know what you don't do it. It's as simple as that.

[00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:13.390]
10.57 at 5.60 WQM if you want to replace that tired old nasty carpeting in your home here's an idea call our friends at laminets are us.

[00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:23.290]
They're the easy low maintenance alternative to natural wood flooring which looks great but what is it cost a lot of cash laminets are us is the best place to find laminated wood flooring from the top names in the universe they got.

[00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:33.630]
Peridore and per go and Wilson our unit floor quick step and all of laminets are us flooring installed by per go certified installers to here's another reason why ought to be caught in their prices are so low you'll probably say.

[00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:51.390]
In the way you will say that for example right now get the floor fall special for just 1495 bucks just 1495 dollars gets you up to 295 square feet of beautiful laminated wood flooring like I said it's unreal and laminets are us will match any legitimate written offer so for free and home estimate call laminets are us tool free.

[00:49:51.390 --> 00:50:09.110]

[00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:13.370]
My life is lost this is for 205.60.

[00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:15.170]
You're way away.

[00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:18.770]
You dredge packers.

[00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:24.110]
What light presents real American heroes.

[00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.490]
Real American hero.

[00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:33.950]
Today we salute you Mr. Highway Department's flag man.

[00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:49.210]
You're interested with the awesome responsibility of kind of definitely almost telling us it's our turn to head down the only open lane on a two way street in rush hour.

[00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:51.630]
It's always the other side's turn.

[00:50:51.630 --> 00:51:05.210]
User take that orange flag and with the dexterity of a tree's lock make a gesture that says go or is that stop or are you trying to scare away a bee.

[00:51:05.330 --> 00:51:06.810]
We'll never know.

[00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:13.870]
Yes Mr. Highway Department flag man you were too partly to fit down a manhole.

[00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:24.830]
You don't have the expertise to operate a shovel so they gave you are reflective best and entrusted you with our very lives.

[00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:26.730]
Just keep the gas and the brakes.

[00:51:26.830 --> 00:51:38.090]
So the next time you see a man at work sign track up at life to someone who's not even working and who on closer inspection might not even be a man.

[00:51:38.090 --> 00:51:41.570]
Mr. Highway Department flag man.

[00:51:41.770 --> 00:51:44.170]
A real American hero.

[00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:48.350]
Mr. Highway Department flag man.

[00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:49.650]
Let me give you a hand gesture.

[00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.230]
St. Loser Missouri at 560 WQM.

[00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:54.150]
Here's a fact that says a whole bunch of factors.

[00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:59.270]
I love for a lot because it was the best thing for South Florida radio since Phil Henry it says are you sure.

[00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:04.690]
However if he thinks that it's going to be better working for rat think and bolder who's being naive now Scott.

[00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:10.790]
Well you understand it's not going to be any different because no matter where he goes he's going to have the same wackos on his ass.

[00:52:11.570 --> 00:52:16.550]
And he's going to be under the same and if you think cheap channel if that's where he's going he might be going to that a 50 thing.

[00:52:16.810 --> 00:52:18.670]
Is that owned by clear channel I have no idea.

[00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.390]
I don't know anything about that station plus it's in Palm Beach.

[00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:28.850]
But a few things that cheap channels going to let him run fast and lose they've got so many problems with ledge fix contest and everything else under the sun.

[00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:31.630]
That'll be a cool day in hell so it's just going to be an ongoing thing.

[00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:39.350]
It says I've had it with both Mo and Greg I think it's time for the Mussolini treatment on them both hang their corpses on a flagpole and throw rotten tomatoes at him.

[00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.130]
Even that's too good for both of them it says well you may have a point there.

[00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:52.850]
Jay and Davy says speaking of a wacky Jackie Jay and Dave says the best call this morning was an old fart who called Mo and said it's great to be able to use the first amendment to give it of those who abuse it.

[00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:55.630]
Yeah that was wacky Jackie tied in here myself but evidently.

[00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:58.910]
And why he was on the year I have no idea.

[00:52:59.570 --> 00:53:07.470]
See I am going to say it again Robert Grieper how he gets off the hook on that thing yesterday and the thing this morning and beats the crap out of me except the course for the fact that he's clearance is boyfriend.

[00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:16.490]
And this place basically what it's boiled down to now is that it's out of duff sands and out of Greg's hand and it's clearance and his little boyfriends is playmates and that's what we got here.

[00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.830]
It says I was indifferent about Scotchio but I thought most sounded a little gibby this morning.

[00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:27.390]
Oh sure see Mo when you're as insecure as he is everybody else who gets fired that means they need him that much Mo.

[00:53:28.170 --> 00:53:33.310]
So that's a good thing for him because everybody in fact if it was up to Mo everybody else to be fired on a radio station even guilty.

[00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:39.030]
Because then he could just be on all the time they could they could hook his colostomy to up to the goddamn transmitter.

[00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:42.010]
He could be on 24 hours a day.

[00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:47.030]
Here's one from Alexus I vote for a hiring Mo Howard David what an asshole.

[00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:49.810]
One from Little Havana weekday mornings eight to 10 a.m.

[00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:54.250]
Yeah might as well give him his own show he's already got kind of one every day anyway.

[00:53:54.250 --> 00:54:01.290]
What across over it says Mo and one Mo got to go is what it says in other words I think what Alexus try to say is no.

[00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.910]
Yeah.

[00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:04.750]
So what you trying to say Alex no.

[00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:12.210]
Here's another fact that says how about moving managed to eight to 10 and having spik and suds follow you.

[00:54:12.250 --> 00:54:17.770]
Now spik and suds ain't going to be on a radio station but it managed eight to 10 and hang two to six sounds outstanding.

[00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:18.270]
All right.

[00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:23.990]
If it was me I'd be announcing that right now I'd be putting billboards up on that right now.

[00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.910]
Can't you see the billboard here's the QM the new QM lineup five to eight a.m. you don't want to know.

[00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:36.490]
Right that's what I would put on there you don't want to know eight to 10 the mad dog.

[00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:37.430]
All right.

[00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.390]
No good.

[00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:39.790]
Tended to the Humper.

[00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:40.450]
Hey stupid.

[00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.410]
Two to six and after that no he's listening anyway.

[00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:44.030]
Right?

[00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:48.330]
That's what my billboard would say and if Donna Shalela don't like it that's for you honey.

[00:54:50.110 --> 00:54:52.410]
See this is what I don't want to go into it.

[00:54:52.510 --> 00:55:08.090]
I just I don't want to go through the whole thing very frustrating but again let you know and those of you people say well we listen to so and so when he does it that's not the point when you're working for somebody else and when you've done this over and over and over and over again and you've been fired more times than we can count here.

[00:55:08.930 --> 00:55:20.130]
You finally say to yourself I guess I better clean up my ass a little bit because I think it'll work here at least not right now but like kind of lay low for a while till the ear clears and the man just apparently can't do it.

[00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:30.590]
And I want to repeat what I said before I like the guy but I've never encountered anybody because what you people don't understand you think that all of us who are on the air not like me this is a radio show.

[00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:47.890]
I'm not like this off the air I'm a very low key quiet guy off the air people meet me like oh gee well how come Neil so quiet because that's me screaming and carrying on for four hours a day here like this this is a radio show but with for real off the air there is absolutely no difference none.

[00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:50.290]
It's exactly the same.

[00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:52.630]
He never stops.

[00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:55.030]
Which he ought to stop.

[00:55:55.570 --> 00:55:56.710]
He ought to lighten up a little bit.

[00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:58.650]
Listen to what other people have to tell him.

[00:55:59.970 --> 00:56:16.490]
And here's another J who says I like for a lot we must be the dumbest S O B in history of dumb S O B's trust me there been many anyone who finds employment in an industry that demands your own creativity to succeed must establish a breaking point but when for all establish that point if you did as a starting line and not a ceiling that's a good way to describe it.

[00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:22.530]
In other words we all draw a line and that's where we end at that line he starts at that line and then goes on from there.

[00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:42.230]
A bigger mistake than for else only or would be QA and giving to their precious drive time hours to the big no I like that the big which he means the big I don't want to go for the line but he maybe worse off the lead in and the moment for maybe not that bad and J also says no more moments what he said that's what he says to no more.

[00:56:43.230 --> 00:56:59.730]
The vote it's only 1107 and we have 319 votes even alien I think peeled into in significance compared to this what's the biggest screw up WQM is made in the last two years hiring Mohauer David 95

[00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:29.450]
firing for L 85 almost pulling away a little bit Scott blow out the first team 50 and of course that's the thing that started this whole deal it's I realized it's two years later and a lot of people weren't here then or they forget but that's what I started the unraveling of the whole deal it's kind of like when you have like a sweater and there's like a piece of material it's like hang and I need start pulling it and then the whole thing starts unraveling the whole damn stinkin thing unravels right in your push blow out the first team 50

[00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:59.370]
letting the crow get away 42 putting Neil on 9 to 127 and hiring for all only 20 out of 319 votes but he'll be on here somewhere and then he'll get candy again unfortunately I mean I'm not wishing him anything bad but it just you know I'm right don't you I've seen it before no that wasn't the question you know that I'm right it will have it again can't get fired in the shower you know that I'm right see I want to say it because you know you don't want to keep all the soap to himself 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a 8 whatever

[00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:12.030]
it is here's Port St. Lucie hello okay I have a great day pali that was Scott now we can't put you on here actually I guess we could put him on here but I probably had a good idea because he'd take crap or something here's a Miami hello

[00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:22.630]
hello all right Rick and Suds looking for that 2 to 6 gig pretty weak here's Miami hello Daniel yes sir

[00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:57.910]
I realize you're under a lot of pressure which is to relax take a deep breath quit being quite so spastic if that's possible but I doubt it

[00:58:58.710 --> 00:59:05.490]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T line here's plantation hello how you doing sir

[00:59:05.490 --> 00:59:15.090]
by the way I think that 8 50 AM is owned by the Sun Sentinel I'm not sure though the Sun Sentinel I had heard something about that you have to be kidding me I believe so check into I'm not that I'm not sure

[00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:26.050]
doing a show pretty soon I know they don't get it and I got a couple more things what's the difference and I mean I'm not in the industry and I don't really know

[00:59:26.050 --> 00:59:34.170]
and you know what consider yourself lucky what's the difference between some of the stuff that George talks about about the drugs and the eating ass what's the difference between that and some of the stuff for

[00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:40.750]
all of the other is we out of fire George too I'll be honest no no no but wait a minute I think you may be onto something because quite frankly the

[00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:44.790]
one feeling right now I think we had a fire like a whole lot of people you know what I like to see who's that

[00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:52.430]
D.F. and Goldie 6 to 10 get rid of them all now you're talking man all right thank you so we said fire George and the D.F. and

[00:59:52.910 --> 01:00:00.990]
Gildi from 6 to 10 everything was fine everything was so pleasant here people would walk around in a hallway and

[01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:06.510]
yuck it up and have a great time back in the days of the first team everybody was high five and a low five and we had just as much food

[01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:12.530]
coming in with you wanted it or not back in M days and then we went through that mo business it seems to me I

[01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.010]
could be wrong that Moe is really the trigger in a wood pie

[01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:24.810]
in the church

[01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:30.490]

[01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:35.130]
really well he's busy you know he's got under a lot of stress plus he's embarrassed and he knows that I'm

[01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:39.730]
on to him he knows that I know anyway the reason I played the rush but even though we played all the time is

[01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.210]
because rush will be back on the air on Monday

[01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:49.270]
what the not that not all you little heads out there dancer Kuzansky okay kick kick up your heels together if you can do it with a big hip boots on

[01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:57.050]
because rush returns on Monday with a lot of excuses and stories and bull crap about how what really happened and about how the

[01:01:57.050 --> 01:02:02.710]
inquire and inquire saved his life absolutely he probably be a dead man there's my close person where now you can come in

[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:11.290]
because I just farted real bad there's Greg read the man our own Humpty Dumpty's in the hallway now trying to put the pieces together again

[01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:22.210]

[01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:28.670]
pay him write him a blank check that said bigger the greatest line up in radio history will salvage your ass no matter what you

[01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:36.410]
whether you like it or not he says I get out of here go away go away

[01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:47.850]
oh I got an idea if he can do material like that Greg 8 to 10 oh I think I just had a brainstorm asked the manager

[01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:56.410]
back at member at iod Jeff member when we used to have asked the program director when Steve Nichol used to do those things

[01:02:56.410 --> 01:03:03.490]
on here remember that yeah ask the program director right of course he was in coherent I don't don't start please you know

[01:03:03.490 --> 01:03:09.550]
I mean absolutely right but that's an idea ask the manager we can have Greg weed on every day for me to 10 I'll

[01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:16.750]
give the audience some questions asked by the way haha haha some inside inflammation three that make his

[01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:20.610]
hair stand on and what a least got but he could be in Rome right now than all of this business going on

[01:03:20.610 --> 01:03:26.010]
but he can't be there I hope the power 96 people have a really good time in Rome I think what I asked

[01:03:26.010 --> 01:03:30.570]
me out of quote told him about some great tractor ears to hit oh boy I know the good spots

[01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:37.310]
359 votes what's the biggest screw up QI was made in the past two years by the way I noticed Greg didn't

[01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:41.290]
bring me his check for for all four and seventy bucks I didn't see a check in his hand no I saw

[01:03:41.290 --> 01:03:48.270]
something else in his hand the biggest mistake hiring Mohawar David has got 110 votes absolutely

[01:03:48.270 --> 01:03:57.510]
firing for real 94 that's correct blowing out the first team 59 for the first team holy ice cream

[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:02.550]
to make it we have to sit on like a tub of ice cream letting the crow get away 44 and by the way

[01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:10.090]
putting nila 9 to 132 and guess what we want again hiring for real 20 only 20 say hiring for

[01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:18.250]

[01:06:09.490 --> 01:06:16.730]
bring us out sports top radio stations there's something like a diamond dozen yeah maybe if you

[01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:22.430]

[01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:27.250]
hear about other the single ponders and all that yeah yeah you're right I know what you're

[01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:31.470]
talking about the sports talk on this station is just a board of in my hear about y'all all

[01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:36.870]
this analytical talk about the left guard and the right tackle and this one with his hamstring

[01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:41.310]
that is how anybody could listen to that thing mental help well I mean it just is there

side of your voice it won't be long five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T

[01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:17.650]
Jeff Cohen by the way there's another guy wouldn't listen to me you're like for real you won't listen

[01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:22.490]
anybody now and nobody will listen to me I mean the audience listens to me whether they pay

[01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:26.650]
attention not that's another story but at least they they reach over in a crank it and the dial too

[01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:33.110]
but anybody else I try to tell them something bad about they they just stare on experts

[01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.410]
and I have ear witnesses out there this audience heard me advise that guy a mezzillion time and

[01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:42.990]
you always was saying well you're my mentor and you're the one that told me I do everything you

[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:47.150]
but you don't do anything I told you Scott that's the problem didn't do any of the stuff I told you

[01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:50.410]
just take the bank the you know check in fact he didn't even have to go to the bank it was direct

[01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:55.650]
deposit with him just take a look at your bank account the smile and look in the mirror and then go

[01:07:55.650 --> 01:08:00.030]
out and get laid into whatever you want and have a good time and uh have a few free beers at the

[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:05.670]
ball game and that's it have a great life life is sweet I know speaking for the rest of us here

[01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:09.970]
on this radio station mad dogs always say it in a Humper and yours truly what's not to like and

[01:08:09.970 --> 01:08:14.310]
even mow is happy he's an old fart and bokeh I mean plays golf every day we're happy bunch here

[01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:19.430]
we realize that even though we're working for a bunch of red necks over there on a west coast with

[01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:25.310]
their finger deep inside their nose and each others uh right we realize that it ain't so bad

[01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:31.810]
get about 75 weeks a year vacation right I'm making some very serious bucks they don't like it

[01:08:31.810 --> 01:08:36.050]
I tell them to stick it where the moon don't shine nothing they can do about it by the way we got

[01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:42.270]
a trend coming out November 18 what day is that uh Tuesday 3 p.m. Tuesday will be the next

[01:08:42.270 --> 01:08:48.110]
arbitrarily the beginning of the fall book what would be something if a rail has gigantic number

[01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:54.630]
well see your laughing but the problem is is every month in the trends in the summer book his

[01:08:54.630 --> 01:09:02.910]
number kept going down and got him and mow down they did well what do you look see I'm glad that

[01:09:02.910 --> 01:09:06.710]
you're a witness okay how I deal with this for four hours every day I have no idea I a little

[01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:12.710]
I sure picked the right week to come back the expressions on your face are not of human origin okay

[01:09:12.710 --> 01:09:17.050]
that's all I can tell you Scott the the the facial expressions have nothing to do with being a human

[01:09:17.050 --> 01:09:21.470]
being there's something uh all I'd like to know is where are they hiding the ship you've seen small

[01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:25.610]
veil you know how they have that he has it down in the basement you've never seen it he's got

[01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:29.370]
the spaceship in the basement evidently in the balls of the qm building there must be something

[01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:34.970]
similar to that one Elmer says is it completely out of the question to put George and suds on

[01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:41.310]
for me to tell is it out of the question yes it is out of the question it says why not

[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.750]
they obviously have great chemistry with each other that would give you a natural lead in I would

[01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:49.690]
venture to say that these two would go on a more ratings than whomever else outs out of mad dog maybe

[01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:53.890]
measly we would put it in a time slot that's for five to eighty m who really cares anyway says Elmer

[01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:57.350]
and that's right Elmer that's why we stuffed those guys in here five day because nobody really cares

[01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:04.390]
now you're catching on you know what I mean and he got the job done five six seven oh five sixty

[01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:09.570]
pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon and I guess the diary is better though wireless line

[01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:15.750]
388 votes what's the biggest screw up that wqm has made in the past two years hiring mohauer

[01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:27.330]
david a hundred and eighteen how do you like that that's correct firing for well 104 blowing out

[01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:31.450]
of comedians out there putting nila nine to one thirty three so that should have more votes in

[01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:37.110]
that but again it didn't affect they don't they don't get it and hiring for well only 24 out of

[01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:42.630]
three eighty we'll have over four hundred votes by the bottom of the yard this is phenomenal

[01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:49.890]
in an hour in an hour which means that people are leaving work kids are racing out of school right

[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:53.010]
now running there or they're going to the nearest PC wherever the hell they got them in school

[01:10:53.010 --> 01:10:55.790]
they're going to go down the street and steal one out of a best buy

[01:10:58.370 --> 01:11:02.010]
which might not be a bad idea because if you really want to go to best buy and stand online you'll

[01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:08.570]
never get weighted on anyway and now here's some more more clowns with more a phony line ups very sad

[01:11:09.090 --> 01:11:14.290]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

coming in in chunks chunks the biggest screw up QM's made in the last two years hiring Mo 133 firing

[01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:54.550]
for well 120 blowing out the first team 71 letting the crow get away 47 putting me on 9 to 136

[01:17:54.550 --> 01:18:03.290]
hiring for alone in 26 let's see oh Mike says a 50 AM is now WFT alone by the James crystal

[01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:09.430]
radio group whoo I was in four Myers life tweaking her signal was really strong Diva was on 4 to 7

[01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:15.630]
daily in the show is really great oh Mike man you got a real sense of humor sweetheart

[01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:22.690]
his show is really great I like D foe but let's let's not get carried away okay his show is really great

[01:18:22.690 --> 01:18:29.730]
right you know what I think you know they got the what yeah look exactly here's Miami Beach hello

[01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:36.150]
hey how are you Neil I'm okay hey I've been on hold since the 1972 before Jesus was a baby

[01:18:36.150 --> 01:18:40.210]
and look at keeping out of trouble I love your show and I've been listening to it since the very

[01:18:40.210 --> 01:18:46.250]
beginning today where your analogy of the kid the burning his hand right I think you really are a

[01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:53.110]
pretty good friend of bros because you seem to be all around what for else real life problem is

[01:18:53.670 --> 01:19:00.090]
when you're a 37 year old and you can't handle authority and you flip flop from job to job right

[01:19:00.090 --> 01:19:04.750]
and nobody can tell you what you can do right I think the word you're looking at is maturity

[01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:11.510]
right that's that's that's pretty good analization and if if I think the best thing for all

[01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:16.570]
friends and family can do a sit down with him and say yes son you know you're 37 you're really

[01:19:16.570 --> 01:19:21.450]
gonna have to grow up have you ever met him yes I have have you ever tried to have a rational

[01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:32.110]
conversation with him yes yes and he's a very young 37 really and I know that yeah well of course

[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:38.990]
and you know him on a friendly basis and you know he's a young man he's a perky upbeat sharp young

[01:19:38.990 --> 01:19:43.990]
man but you know when you can't deal with authority you can't deal with the bosses and as you said

[01:19:43.990 --> 01:19:49.970]
earlier today you can't play the game the way it's supposed to be played right well thought

[01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:53.550]
question of playing the game is a question of doing what they expected to do and doing it the way

[01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:57.810]
they want you to and that's it so simple as that people draw the parameters and either you do it

[01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:02.030]
or you don't do it that's all and I'll say it again when you keep getting can't over and over

[01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:05.970]
and over again the rest of the world can't be wrong and you'd be right it doesn't work that way

[01:20:05.970 --> 01:20:10.650]
it's not like the whole world is not a lot of step and he's in line and you have to admit that

[01:20:10.650 --> 01:20:15.130]
that goes to a man's maturity it goes to his maturity man the maturity may be part of it but I've

[01:20:15.130 --> 01:20:20.770]
also maybe just common sense yeah and also maybe some people just aren't all that bright if I

[01:20:20.770 --> 01:20:26.010]
I don't I hate to say that but some people just aren't that smart and and and you know what he did

[01:20:26.010 --> 01:20:31.930]
use you Neil as a parameter for his performance and well well I'm only a serious why is that what

[01:20:31.930 --> 01:20:36.830]
the other why I have to do with him well you're yeah and quite frankly I'm really I really got

[01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:41.090]
a little bit very tired that's been well you know Neil does it and the fact that matter

[01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:45.330]
in Neil doesn't do the things that he said that I do maybe maybe the words are used but not in

[01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:49.230]
the way that he uses them and that's where he doesn't understand the difference exactly because

[01:20:49.230 --> 01:20:55.210]
your experience level are you there I'm here I'm listening okay because you have to look my assets

[01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:59.850]
you know it's already a little sore from there but bacon no no but your experience level shows you

[01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:06.030]
how far you can go where where you can go and where you know I'll give the best example again we

[01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.710]
had the problem last year with that condolence a bit and we had some complaints from some outside

[01:21:09.710 --> 01:21:14.470]
agitators who are trying to get me canned and you know it came down to they told me don't play it

[01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:18.230]
again or we're going to have to fire you you know it'll be caused for firing your ass and so we

[01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:23.250]
don't play it anymore that's all do I have a need to play that no of course not you know and have a

[01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:29.890]
great day thanks and that's all that you don't do this okay fine do I agree with it no of course

[01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.830]
I don't agree with it but it's not my radio station like I tried to explain to some of those little

[01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:38.950]
uh Julio agitators during your circle jerk last week it's not my radio station they call they call

[01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:43.710]
the shots and quite frankly they give me enough latitude am I going to complain about it no of course

[01:21:43.710 --> 01:21:49.050]
not not like every week they're coming in here saying oh gee you did this and and then must tell

[01:21:49.050 --> 01:21:52.870]
you something okay that should have told for ral something they're not coming in here every week

[01:21:52.870 --> 01:22:00.170]
and saying oh gee when you did this because I don't in addition to which I have a buffer

[01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:05.690]
and the buffer being is that I have a guarantee in writing that the same agitator who was

[01:22:05.690 --> 01:22:09.910]
agitating against for well can't agitate against me a thing that he signed voluntarily years ago

[01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:15.630]
after the man took two years out of my life at w i o d and it's eight and uh i and z and I'm sure he's

[01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:20.650]
listening right now even though he's not supposed to be better turn it off jack turn it off right now

[01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:28.190]
get your toothbrush ready five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T and it's

[01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:32.730]
really very very sad that we all live under this cloud it just like that one guy who went after

[01:22:32.730 --> 01:22:37.730]
Howard Stern remember that guy he was he was actually moving his residence from one market to

[01:22:37.730 --> 01:22:42.050]
another just so we could claim to live in a certain place and legitimately a file a complaint

[01:22:42.050 --> 01:22:46.690]
against Howard's certainly FCC and infinity one paying hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars

[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.130]
because of one person let me say it again and I realize my saying it isn't going to make it so

[01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:58.870]
community standards aren't determined by one wacko anywhere but one person likes or doesn't like

[01:22:58.870 --> 01:23:03.750]
or finds tasteful or distasteful should never determine community standards especially in New

[01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:10.470]
York or Miami or Los Angeles where there are millions and millions of people and one person

[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:14.030]
decides that something is offensive and therefore they're going to say wow we're going to find your

[01:23:14.770 --> 01:23:20.330]
it's just again part of the whole thing that's happening in this country the chilling of free speech

[01:23:23.310 --> 01:23:29.250]
456 votes Moe was leading for L by 10 hard to catch the moment I'll tell you that when he's off

[01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:36.270]
to a big Lee like that very far see this very far see that hard just come down here's a call from

[01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:43.010]
Miami hello hello Neil yes sir I do with a old for such a long time well it's okay you're not going

[01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:48.490]
anywhere usually a first amendment champion yeah and I feel bad that for all got camping I really

[01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:52.590]
enjoy what does that mean and what did I just get you saying well you yeah you're talking about

[01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:58.330]
community standards and before what did I say before that about the kind of leaser bit they said

[01:23:58.990 --> 01:24:05.910]
don't play it or we fire you and you decided that the paycheck I decided that I need the job

[01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:10.190]
okay if I had enough money to retire I tell them stuff it goodbye that's I play a one last time

[01:24:10.190 --> 01:24:14.850]
and I'd say goodbye that's it well it's got nothing to do with the first amendment it's got to do with

[01:24:14.850 --> 01:24:19.050]
the common sense it's got to do with protecting your job protecting your livelihood that's what we're

[01:24:19.050 --> 01:24:23.810]
talking about here not the freaking first amendment well I think for real at the end of the day he's

[01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:29.370]
brought a large audience or whatever else they're going to put back on his time slot over there

[01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:34.850]
larger audience and the mad dog well I don't know okay I've been listening to you guys for a while and

[01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:40.010]
he was drawing a good book I think or even don't know how to book this he was having a bad

[01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:47.370]
trend but the David thing is just putrid I mean the David thing or the Howard David thing I'd

[01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:51.790]
never heard him again by calling that it's really it's David thing David Howard I mean it's

[01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:56.470]
pure crap unless they want to write off the whole thing that Howard turned in the morning

[01:24:56.470 --> 01:25:02.050]
that there's nothing to do I hope for a lands back on his feet maybe gets on the 940

[01:25:02.050 --> 01:25:09.730]
940 would be good actually he enough to croak and do it have a great day power all right by

that hates George like poison.

[01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:54.470]
When you lay off George for a little bit,

[01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:56.250]
Jesus, what is wrong with you people, man?

[01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:57.510]
There are a lot of people who hate me.

[01:29:57.650 --> 01:29:58.090]
They hate George.

[01:29:58.290 --> 01:29:59.270]
That's fine. You're entitled.

[01:29:59.810 --> 01:30:00.550]
But what about...

[01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:37.190]
stuck I mean I like him I think he's cool but he's pretty much getting stale to

[01:45:37.190 --> 01:45:42.010]
me he talks about the same stuff yes up against people who drink shardonnay and

[01:45:42.010 --> 01:45:47.310]
hey yes sir and green lizard is getting stale you know I I trust his opinion on

[01:45:47.310 --> 01:45:54.470]
football but nothing else here a little dog man he likes the little dog this guy

[01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:57.530]
he's tickling his own fancy there plus the longer thing if we put Joe on there we

[01:45:57.530 --> 01:46:01.490]
know he talk about for two hours hour from bokeh yeah which I wouldn't mind

[01:46:01.490 --> 01:46:05.330]
following that I voted for the mad dog loved Joe Rose I have no problem with that

[01:46:06.130 --> 01:46:09.710]
I'd have no problem with there's only well I'd have a lot of problem with a lot

[01:46:09.710 --> 01:46:17.150]
of them but that having been said let me also say this I'm just reaching for

[01:46:17.150 --> 01:46:22.050]
faxes let me just also say this I don't really care that much we do tend to two

[01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:29.010]
well now what is this you put Rick and Sides put Warren Cromarty no I'm not I'm

[01:46:29.010 --> 01:46:31.730]
not don't don't be directing the show okay now we're getting a factory with

[01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:36.050]
direct in the show it's got to be inside job here's one that said oh this Alice I'm

[01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:39.190]
I you want to send like 50 faxes every day I'm not gonna read them okay just

[01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:42.350]
like callers once a king always a king but once a queen's enough that's once

[01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:47.150]
print up Prince Charlie says Prince is Charlie over across the pond she's under

[01:46:47.150 --> 01:46:52.790]
a lot of stress you know under her dress here's Hollywood hello yes sir how

[01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:57.350]
you done okay the big problem what is the big problem sir okay the big problem is

[01:46:57.350 --> 01:47:03.530]
but right now our David he's polarized the entire staff at the station he's

[01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:07.430]
made the list and is not want to listen and you need a lead in I mean the

[01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:11.930]
station they need to get a true six to ten morning show absolutely just like

[01:47:11.930 --> 01:47:15.270]
when there was a first thing was on whether you like Joe the Farge you like go

[01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:19.170]
the a little bit you like Joe Rose yeah we didn't have no major problem in

[01:47:19.170 --> 01:47:22.230]
those days everything was going along to that's why that's why they screwed around

[01:47:22.230 --> 01:47:25.870]
it absolutely and and and that's absolutely that's a really

[01:47:25.870 --> 01:47:29.530]
connected show from you know five to nine and nine to eight and

[01:47:30.190 --> 01:47:35.350]
that's such a thing nobody see that I think that's a radio for 50 years and it

[01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:39.930]
was traditionally morning drive to get a radio for 200 years and I never

[01:47:39.930 --> 01:47:42.610]
heard of such a thing that they got these chopped up little blocks and the

[01:47:42.610 --> 01:47:44.750]
only reason that they're backed into record of doing that was another Greg

[01:47:44.750 --> 01:47:47.990]
mistake because he screwed up moving the deal and he had to withstand Howard's

[01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:51.590]
contract because he screwed the thing went over his his hand on the contract

[01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:54.870]
deal so now he stuck with the guy that he doesn't want so they jammed him back

[01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:57.910]
there in the wee hours in the morning here for next 80 years to eat croaks

[01:47:57.910 --> 01:48:00.990]
well and if they are the problem I don't know if you've listened to top and

[01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:04.270]
broadcast on the radio in the afternoon no I never listen to the games by

[01:48:04.270 --> 01:48:09.150]
hearing he's making a lot of mistakes he has all but nooted the mad dog really

[01:48:09.150 --> 01:48:13.950]
he might not even be on anymore oh that's right he likes to do his broadcast he

[01:48:13.950 --> 01:48:18.570]
likes to do his color comments and then like mad dog is now left to be making

[01:48:18.570 --> 01:48:23.130]
these in any comments with before he and Zimper were a good team right and so

[01:48:23.130 --> 01:48:26.790]
you know it's just he's he's ruined the football broadcast in the afternoon

[01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:30.730]
and he's or whenever they play and he's ruined the morning and he's polarized

[01:48:30.730 --> 01:48:34.110]
and has everybody I mean Joe Rose never said who about anybody and that one

[01:48:34.110 --> 01:48:38.130]
Saturday he had that that that would you play it a hundred times that that

[01:48:38.130 --> 01:48:41.990]
while the conversation he had with Howard David he ripped him apart that's

[01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:47.550]
correct so he's just you know he's polarized station and I think that they should

[01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:51.290]
somehow get rid of him pay him his money let him do his top and broadcast and put

[01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:54.610]
somebody up and there you know I think I have two words that I think are going to

[01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:58.470]
solve the problem nursing home yes have a great day pali

[01:48:58.470 --> 01:49:01.430]
maybe they can send him to the same nursing home that Edna Wallace on

[01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:04.490]
passion is going to go to they can compare notes although Edna is a lot

[01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:11.430]
funnier 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a AT&T and Verizon wireless line as we

[01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:14.810]
continue like like I told you years ago it's a soap opera baby that's what's

[01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:21.030]
all about but I also want to tell you this it's all about two things entertainment

[01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:26.050]
that's number two that's way down the list and number one it's about money

[01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:29.790]
that's what we're here for that's what commercial radio is all about it's

[01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:34.590]
about making money now I want to draw parallels and somebody was a fax me before

[01:49:34.590 --> 01:49:36.970]
about for all the best things since Phil Henry to come to the market I'll draw

[01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:41.950]
your parallel now for well also did the thing yesterday which I don't think this

[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:46.650]
is the reason he got can but was like frosting on a cake he did a spot for one

[01:49:46.650 --> 01:49:52.150]
of our sponsors and yes he does crazy you off the wall spots that's fine but

[01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:55.290]
it would and he complained about the copy which I agree with him I do that all

[01:49:55.290 --> 01:49:58.390]
the time too but he did a spot that was so unacceptable that if I were to

[01:49:58.390 --> 01:50:01.490]
client-paying like a couple hundred bucks for the spot I'd be outraged he

[01:50:01.490 --> 01:50:06.610]
never even gave the phone number yeah just pick up your dress and give me the

[01:50:06.610 --> 01:50:10.750]
money it's one thing to be funny but in other words when the sponsors are

[01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:13.630]
flying away because they're not going to pay money for just stick and a

[01:50:13.630 --> 01:50:17.390]
sandwich through with Phil Phil had good ratings a great talent but he had no

[01:50:17.390 --> 01:50:21.270]
credibility every time he did something people thought I wish stick which is

[01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:24.370]
why he had almost no spots because sponsors didn't believe that he had

[01:50:24.370 --> 01:50:29.790]
an incredible ability to back up his endorsing their accounts their business so

[01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:34.310]
there is a similarity there but it's not a good one because no matter what you

[01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:37.730]
talk about no matter how entertaining you are if you can't bring in a bus bye bye

[01:50:38.770 --> 01:50:45.390]
see ya it's 11 past noon at 560 WQM I hope you see it vicarner's in for

[01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:49.270]
Lauderdale what a great place years ago there used to be everywhere you went

[01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:52.030]
when yeah I don't want to sound like an old funny daddy although I certainly am

[01:50:52.710 --> 01:50:55.790]
but in the old days used to have all these hometown restaurants that were so

[01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:58.330]
good and everything was fresh and everything was made to order right on a grill

[01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:02.090]
or front of your post as opposed to the prefabricated the crack that you get

[01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:05.330]
nowadays well vicarner's was some of those great places in fact they were

[01:51:05.330 --> 01:51:08.970]
Rochester going all the way back to 1934 and the goodness for us is now they're

[01:51:08.970 --> 01:51:11.870]
in for Lauderdale they're on federal highway just south of Barrett

[01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:15.130]
port about in the tunnel on the east side vicarner's is a real flashback in

[01:51:15.130 --> 01:51:18.690]
town of those good old days so stop into vicarner's enjoy burger or hot dogs

[01:51:18.690 --> 01:51:22.430]
or fresh fast and delicious vicarner's is being brought to you in town by

[01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:25.850]
the same people who could feed you cheaper but cheaper using the same fresh

[01:51:25.850 --> 01:51:30.870]
100% ground chuck meat as cheaper cheaper on a menu you'll find a big fat one

[01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:34.290]
an incredible quarter pound hot dog you'll have a tough time giving your lips

[01:51:34.290 --> 01:51:37.530]
around and of course they put that signature meat sauce on top of all the burgers

[01:51:37.530 --> 01:51:40.270]
and dogs which is what sets them apart from everybody else that's why it's

[01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:43.070]
so outstanding they've also got a great breakfast menu all kinds of goodies

[01:51:43.070 --> 01:51:46.470]
under menu for example they got omelettes cooked to order french toast pancakes

[01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:49.810]
on your favorite side dishes so stop by vicarner's whether you're from Rochester

[01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:23.510]

[01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:28.210]
it up my point back to Howard is don't listen listen to one on one point five

[01:52:28.210 --> 01:52:32.670]
let me see what age group one on one point five for Howard maybe one oh two point

[01:52:32.670 --> 01:52:38.470]
seven some easily listening love music so you could focus on your wife and your

[01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:43.710]
family and the grandkids instead of listening and always calling the radio

[01:52:43.710 --> 01:52:48.870]
station he's becoming Howard the caller like Howard from Boka Howard from Boka

[01:52:50.110 --> 01:52:56.130]
it's like you know it's okay so anyway he's he's listening so just wanted to

[01:52:56.130 --> 01:52:59.890]
get the message out and don't call my show too just for a record don't call

[01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:04.090]

[01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:53.770]
line because for once in his life he's being honest more realizes that he has

[01:56:41.170 --> 01:56:46.610]
nothing is that predictable or what absolutely God I'd be humiliated he just

[01:56:46.610 --> 01:56:51.210]
he just refuses he doesn't care see in a way actually he's got to write out

[01:56:51.210 --> 01:56:54.550]
it to he doesn't care he's just continuing to take the money and keep you

[01:56:54.550 --> 01:56:59.850]
know refreshing his colostomy bag and that's it buy more checkered pants it says

[01:56:59.850 --> 01:57:10.270]
let's see like oh no I'm so distressed from this fact that I just want to fall on

[01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:13.490]
the floor I'm I this this thing yeah I'll go all the way down to the floor on the

[01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:17.650]
mic boom I might have to lie on the floor and do the rest of the show it says

[01:57:17.650 --> 01:57:22.630]
hey in the last night Joe and Mark were lobbying big time for the eight to 10 a.m.

[01:57:22.750 --> 01:57:28.350]
slot so they probably should be on your list no he says I think the

[01:57:28.350 --> 01:57:31.250]
managed idea is best as there's with the Humper to the sisters you suggest

[01:57:31.250 --> 01:57:35.190]
then you can put on the big as a reward for his good service I have no

[01:57:35.190 --> 01:57:39.030]
problem with that I mean if he has to be on which is sad to begin with but

[01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:42.470]
that's okay it said that slot irrelevant most of the time anyway nobody would

[01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:45.390]
life lessons then which makes it perfect for sports nerds and half the

[01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:48.890]
nights it'll get cut short for panties marlin's canziyah deyadi right excellent

[01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:53.850]
job there I'll mark regular facts but that first part there Joe and Mark were

[01:57:53.850 --> 01:58:01.050]
lobbying for the eight to 10 a.m. slot that is unbelievable on a separate while

[01:58:01.050 --> 01:58:05.070]
Joe Costello is a good friend but the answer is positively not ready for

[01:58:05.070 --> 01:58:15.450]
prime time give me a break that is just mind blowing 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60

[01:58:15.450 --> 01:58:21.430]
on a 18 t and for rise and wireless line here's a call from Davy hello hey

[01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:25.570]
me how you doing pretty good all right that's great I got the perfect the

[01:58:25.570 --> 01:58:29.030]
perfect reason you might say it's a fill in the actually take over the

[01:58:29.030 --> 01:58:33.270]
button what do you call it what do you call it the second first team that with

[01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:37.650]
Moe the second team right I got the what you call one from little

[01:58:37.650 --> 01:58:42.010]
Atlanta mocked the jet span and I'll reach you from boys and I don't forget Paul

[01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:46.090]
the Paul the Patriots fan has not become another usual like I forgot about

[01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:50.990]
him and also David jet span or he went right hopefully far okay we'll think

[01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:56.690]
about it they'll work cheap anyway get a New England Paul and I I told you

[01:58:56.690 --> 01:59:02.290]
what an asshole he was so he quit the faxes because nobody are reading

[01:59:02.290 --> 01:59:05.030]
him anymore so now he's become a chronic car it's just amazing these

[01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:08.490]
chronic if we shuffle them away from this show or anybody else to show they'll

[01:59:08.490 --> 01:59:11.330]
always find someplace to land on a show that doesn't discriminate doesn't

[01:59:11.330 --> 01:59:15.690]
discern that'll put anybody on over and over say and again I blame I blame

[01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:18.370]
the people in programming in this radio station for letting that go on I

[01:59:19.190 --> 01:59:21.710]
mean they're so concerned about the language for Elvis used none here and all

[01:59:21.710 --> 01:59:24.190]
the heat they were getting for and I can understand that but how come they're

[01:59:24.190 --> 01:59:27.130]
not concerned about the chronic regulars who've taken over that early early

[01:59:27.130 --> 01:59:32.570]
morning part and it just made it unlisteningable I'm sorry that it's just

[01:59:33.210 --> 01:59:36.770]
it's just basic common knowledge when you talk radio of any kind sports

[01:59:36.770 --> 01:59:39.610]
rating else when you're gonna have the same chronic regulars on it's the kiss

[01:59:39.610 --> 01:59:44.810]
of death nobody and I mean even his family don't want to hear one from a

[01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:51.530]
little Havana Tucker who's also very chronic faxer says I think you and will miss

[01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:54.830]
for a while not because the show is so great but because it was something new

[01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:58.530]
and it's at least was different I love the mad dog but in the two to four slot

[02:00:00.870 --> 02:00:06.110]
why the something you mentioned the list you mentioned the must be desired

[02:00:06.110 --> 02:00:10.330]
much like the old man in his pipsqueak between 5 and 8 a.m. for that reason I say

[02:00:10.330 --> 02:00:14.050]
give the five to six a.m. hour back to Joe and Mark blow out Mo and Gellie

[02:00:14.050 --> 02:00:18.730]
bring in John Ren Shaw six to 10 a.m. he's a sports nerd but anyone they

[02:00:18.730 --> 02:00:22.110]
stick in there is going to be a sports nerd at the very least he's new and

[02:00:22.110 --> 02:00:26.150]
different John Ren Shaw does anybody have any idea you ever heard him oh yeah

[02:00:26.150 --> 02:00:31.710]

those other twenty six years before we ever came around we find somebody else

anybody fired I'm not one of those people who takes joy in getting a

[02:08:06.670 --> 02:08:10.190]
people getting fired like mode does I don't take joy in that it just it just

[02:08:10.190 --> 02:08:13.570]

that guy seems to be there I don't know if you look at the cotton in the studio there but he's on all

[02:11:55.270 --> 02:12:00.950]
the time yeah and I tell you when Moe came on I used to listen to the morning show all the time with

[02:12:00.950 --> 02:12:06.090]
Jeff de Forest and Joe Rose at a little bit of a personality a little bit Moe and Geldie on that

[02:12:06.090 --> 02:12:12.050]
I just stopped watching it and I love for all leading into you but you know I don't know what it is

[02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:18.070]
with Moe I don't know his pictures of Greg Reed or what he's the worst one to listen to I just

[02:12:18.070 --> 02:12:23.170]
cannot turn it I like the guys before him I was up one that at five in the morning I

[02:12:23.170 --> 02:12:28.090]
don't know what about you on market to ten that sounds like no elusive to me no chance I would take

[02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:33.730]
them over Moe yeah well we're we're not talking about Moe yeah okay that's my that's my two cents

[02:12:33.730 --> 02:12:38.090]
okay thanks paling okay well you have a great thing well a lot of people have some ideas on this

[02:12:38.090 --> 02:12:42.090]
because we got a real crisis here we thought I thought everything was going along great of course

[02:12:42.090 --> 02:12:47.530]
I wasn't here I was up in Toronto safely away from all the insanity going on here and then do I

[02:12:47.530 --> 02:12:51.810]
pick the week to come down here yeah what see somebody else like oh let's go as Neil came down

[02:12:51.810 --> 02:12:58.090]
they fired him right that had a whole lot to do with it I just I'm just lucky I just know how to

[02:12:58.090 --> 02:13:03.390]
pick him say I don't know how to pick him just stay away up there until you can try to find where

[02:13:03.390 --> 02:13:11.430]
your brain used to be before he came here and anyway this so this will overcome I was going to say

[02:13:11.430 --> 02:13:15.010]
maybe you can talk some sense in him but nobody I'm going to talk no sense in the for real he's just

[02:13:15.550 --> 02:13:23.350]
like that like that he's gonna kiss me like that so no matter where he goes he'll be doing that same

[02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:27.910]
thing and of course if it's in this market he's going to be followed by the same shadows I'm afraid

[02:13:29.090 --> 02:13:33.390]
anyway Rick and Susie got 77 I don't care I won't listen anyway no matter what you put on 8 to

[02:31:50.990 --> 02:31:53.830]
money in this building there's some real serious money they're always talking about the

[02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:57.570]
number one building station in the market and they are but in the meantime a lot of that money is

[02:31:57.570 --> 02:32:02.150]
going to these people who work here and it's almost sad that the people who make the least money

[02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:06.670]
are the ones who for the most part are donating the most that is really and i really i'm serious i

[02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:11.270]
appreciate them because without them it would be really embarrassing the rest of the people they

[02:32:11.270 --> 02:32:15.990]
just don't care guilty he ever come up and i am so tired here about this one's golf tournament

[02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:25.610]

[02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:58.730]
a little bit anyway Rick and says have a hundred and twelve maybe they could come through with a check

[02:32:58.730 --> 02:33:03.570]

[02:33:28.570 --> 02:33:31.770]
josegaaki was in the building he's a good guy he'd write out a check for fifty or a hundred bucks

[02:33:31.770 --> 02:33:37.650]
guaranteed he's not in the building though so we need another three thirty five and i want to

[02:33:37.650 --> 02:33:41.730]

total down what you we haven't gotten a call you know they got the what uh yeah look

[02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:56.010]
it'll happen here's the fact it says i found this at an old closed hammer it sent me this the other

[02:33:56.010 --> 02:33:59.690]
day and i still can't make it out some kind of old q amp bumper sticker or something and it's so

[02:33:59.690 --> 02:34:04.370]
black and dark on your facts i can't make the damn thing out all i can say he is a have a good time

[02:34:04.370 --> 02:34:11.550]
with it and that too five six seven oh five sixty we got a real traumatic day here at qam in case

[02:34:11.550 --> 02:34:16.630]
you tune in late if you've been sleeping in scot farrell got canned there's been an ongoing thing

[02:34:16.630 --> 02:34:20.930]
of course one thing the audience doesn't realize because both of these articles are very very weak

[02:34:20.930 --> 02:34:25.110]
the jica column and a very jackass column that this stuff it's not like it just happened like it

[02:34:25.110 --> 02:34:30.290]
was like over one thing that for else said or uh this has been going on for a very very long time

[02:34:30.290 --> 02:34:33.610]
to the point where the middle and upper level management people in this building have been

[02:34:33.610 --> 02:34:38.350]
climbing on the ceilings trying somehow to like restrain and bring them out of control and save

[02:34:38.350 --> 02:34:41.850]
the situation it's i mean they could have blown them out a long time ago if they wanted to but

[02:34:41.850 --> 02:34:46.330]
they didn't really want to they tried to salvage what we thought was a good line up here in a good

[02:34:46.330 --> 02:34:54.910]
combination but the problem was like that that was the problem i'm not expecting to say anything

[02:34:54.910 --> 02:34:58.290]
you know it's on the microphone there i'm not expecting you to say word in fact i'm praying

[02:34:58.290 --> 02:35:03.690]

[02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:49.170]
i sure as hell supported him a hundred percent and uh i still do wherever he goes but i mean it's

[02:35:49.170 --> 02:35:54.570]

[02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:38.430]
us over forty grand you see and people say wow you better cut that out you know you're begging

[02:36:38.430 --> 02:36:42.330]
that's okay that's all right i know we got some people around here we're really caring i know

[02:36:42.330 --> 02:36:45.930]
that Hank if he just got wind of it you know i'm sorry you better not come in here because if he

[02:36:45.930 --> 02:36:50.830]
hits wind of this studio well i've had that bacon you know oh god wasn't that bad just before

[02:36:50.830 --> 02:36:55.390]
seriously just before Jeff Cohen came in my good close personal friend from pizza loft i just

[02:36:55.390 --> 02:36:59.450]
cut the worst cheese in here in the history of the human race even the french even the french

[02:36:59.450 --> 02:37:03.310]
without awful breed would have been embarrassed i said please though because you don't want somebody

[02:37:03.310 --> 02:37:10.790]
else coming in here like oh jeez did you hear that i just did it again i'm just a big fat tub of gas

[02:37:10.790 --> 02:37:15.750]
these days but by the time Hank gets here it will hopefully dissipate and if not i'm sure he's used

[02:37:15.750 --> 02:37:23.610]
to it it's a ten past one at five at five sixty wqm home of insanity baby one thing about this

[02:37:23.610 --> 02:37:28.050]
place at least it's very rarely boring okay so maybe five days in the morning but other than that

[02:37:28.050 --> 02:37:33.050]

[02:37:33.050 --> 02:37:36.850]

[02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:45.310]
with Robert and they're playing with each other Robert in the beast i mean i like clearance a lot

[02:37:45.310 --> 02:37:48.770]
he's a good guy but but he's he's got to understand if he's going to be in a position of authority

[02:37:48.770 --> 02:37:53.090]
he has to like i still say Robert Gryper should get canned if he was running the board yesterday

[02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:57.850]
morning when that the final straw and the camels ass happened Robert's got to be canned because he

[02:37:57.970 --> 02:38:03.290]
didn't dump it i heard it and everybody else heard it and in fact if that wouldn't happen maybe

[02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:07.650]
for Robert still be here right now and if i had to choose between can and for real or Robert

[02:38:07.650 --> 02:38:12.030]
Gryper would that be a tough choice no way i mean of course it's still would have been just a matter

[02:38:12.030 --> 02:38:16.030]
of a time with the other one because he can't control himself but i mean Gryper i don't know what his

[02:38:16.030 --> 02:38:21.310]
deal is here now i still think that he and clearance are doing something okay i'll draw your picture

They sure are sweet on each other aren't they?

[02:41:25.850 --> 02:41:27.990]
That's my son! I saw him somewhere!

[02:41:29.270 --> 02:41:29.990]
Oh, doctor!

[02:41:31.210 --> 02:41:31.890]
Oh, doctor!

[02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:33.150]
He's all a coward!

[02:41:34.210 --> 02:41:34.510]
Yeah!

[02:41:38.050 --> 02:41:39.970]
I got to go down!

[02:41:40.530 --> 02:41:41.830]
I know he's trying to get stuck!

[02:41:43.330 --> 02:41:45.330]
He's not being able to get anywhere!

[02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:45.910]
Oh, no!

[02:41:46.810 --> 02:41:49.830]
He's going to go to the hospital!

[02:41:52.090 --> 02:41:55.270]
Oh, National Security Advisor Paul Bremer just gave it update on Iraq.

[02:41:55.270 --> 02:41:56.530]
He said, OI!

[02:41:57.550 --> 02:42:00.050]
117 at 560 WDQM, that's what he said.

[02:42:00.270 --> 02:42:01.470]
I think it sums out pretty well.

[02:42:01.930 --> 02:42:03.110]
John and Forladerdale says,

[02:42:03.270 --> 02:42:05.550]
I think the only thing worse than waking up and reading Tom Jicca

[02:42:05.550 --> 02:42:07.630]
is the two minutes of Moe while listening to this morning

[02:42:07.630 --> 02:42:09.630]
with every Yahoo piece of crap sympathizer

[02:42:09.630 --> 02:42:11.970]
chiming in how great it was that Forlgot fired

[02:42:11.970 --> 02:42:14.110]
all to the undertones of Moe

[02:42:14.110 --> 02:42:15.710]
whacking and under the desk an excitement.

[02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:18.230]
You know, I took my grandfather to the hospital

[02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:20.030]
to have his gallbladder removed about five years ago

[02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:21.390]
but the doctor told me it was no problem

[02:42:21.390 --> 02:42:23.450]
because the gallbladder was a useless organ

[02:42:23.450 --> 02:42:24.970]
and the human body didn't need it to function.

[02:42:25.270 --> 02:42:28.130]
Apparently, the same can be said for Greg Reed's balls, says John.

[02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:30.390]
Perhaps they can move...

[02:42:30.390 --> 02:42:31.770]
I won't read the rest of this.

[02:42:32.010 --> 02:42:33.870]
It's just too outrageous, John, but it's great!

[02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.450]
Good entertainment!

[02:42:35.350 --> 02:42:36.790]
He says, God bless Forl!

[02:42:36.890 --> 02:42:38.450]
and may live on in South Florida forever!

[02:42:39.150 --> 02:42:41.650]
Other facts from our chronic jury in Penedida Spring, says,

[02:42:42.030 --> 02:42:45.610]
I too think Jim Maddige would do a good job any time in any slot.

[02:42:45.730 --> 02:42:46.150]
Oh right!

[02:42:46.310 --> 02:42:48.930]
Jim Maddige, I do think he'd be better with his present too

[02:42:48.930 --> 02:42:50.890]
to for though, even though he isn't technically an evening drive.

[02:42:50.990 --> 02:42:53.010]
A lot of people are listening as they're driving home from work.

[02:42:53.370 --> 02:42:54.490]
Maddog is a beer drinker.

[02:42:54.590 --> 02:42:55.890]
A lot of his listeners are beer drinkers.

[02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:57.910]
He talks a lot about restaurants and bars and the area.

[02:42:58.010 --> 02:42:59.690]
I think his listeners are more in two with him in the afternoon.

[02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:01.750]
That may be why he isn't doing so well in your pool.

[02:43:02.250 --> 02:43:04.490]
How is the Maddog going to do live remote from Shoolers to

[02:43:04.490 --> 02:43:05.750]
and Hooters at 8 o'clock in the morning?

[02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:08.050]
I'd love to see Rick and Suds on from 8 to 10, says,

[02:43:08.050 --> 02:43:09.070]
Jerry, I know what ain't gonna happen.

[02:43:09.390 --> 02:43:10.370]
And you know what Jerry you are?

[02:43:10.550 --> 02:43:11.790]
Absolutely correct!

[02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:15.390]
First of all, they don't have to go to sport show number two.

[02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:16.330]
They're gonna want a lot of cash.

[02:43:17.290 --> 02:43:20.090]
Rick and Suds 128, like I said, ain't gonna happen.

[02:43:20.810 --> 02:43:22.270]
Don't care, Wallace, in any way, 68.

[02:43:22.730 --> 02:43:24.410]
Jeff the fourth for 8 to 10, 49.

[02:43:25.090 --> 02:43:28.630]
The Maddog, the angry puppy, the hostile hound, Jim Maddid's 36.

[02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:31.730]
Joe Rose 34, Joe Sneakin' Up on the Maddog.

[02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:35.570]
The big 19, which is pretty embarrassing.

[02:43:35.570 --> 02:43:37.650]
I bet you've owed at least 15 times.

[02:43:38.050 --> 02:43:38.450]
The big O.

[02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:42.850]
Moe and Geldy, 6 to 10 AM, expanded 12, a dozen,

[02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:46.150]
Dirty dozen, Kimbobo, Campar 8, and poor Joseph Gackie again,

[02:43:46.330 --> 02:43:49.590]
the second-winged last place, with only 5 out of 359 votes.

[02:43:50.310 --> 02:43:51.630]
Well, I tell you they're pretty heavy-doodle.

[02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:56.610]
Here's the whole story on Judge Moore to make some of you folks out there just to squeeze it in the light.

[02:43:57.810 --> 02:44:02.590]
Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore was ordered to remove from office today after a state ethics board ruled unanimously

[02:44:02.590 --> 02:44:09.330]
that he violated judicial ethics rules by defying a federal judge's order to move a stone-tentic amendments monument from the state's judicial building.

[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:12.050]
And while those commandments says, don't mess around with a federal judge's.

[02:44:12.090 --> 02:44:13.030]
I guess he didn't read that one.

[02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:18.350]
At a hearing yesterday, Moore said his state oath of office required him to defy the order.

[02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:22.050]
I would do everything I've done again, more told the Alabama Court of Judiciality,

[02:44:22.050 --> 02:44:23.450]
just here I stand by what I've done.

[02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:25.310]
That's what he said, just like that.

[02:44:26.390 --> 02:44:30.290]
The nine-member court, which includes judges, lawyers and non-lawers, could have reprimanded Moore,

[02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:32.490]
continued his suspension or cleared him.

[02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:37.730]
Alabama Attorney General Bill Prior at following the ethics charges against Moore after the Chief Justice refused,

[02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:40.710]
U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson's ordered to remove the monument.

[02:44:41.130 --> 02:44:45.770]
Thompson ruled the monument was an unconstitutional promotion of religion by government in violation of the First Amendment.

[02:44:47.070 --> 02:44:50.990]
Prosecutors rescued, arrested and rescued their case after just 25 minutes,

[02:44:51.370 --> 02:44:56.810]
presenting the panel with documents and video tapes they say proved that Moore defied a lawful court order in violation of his oath of office.

[02:44:58.710 --> 02:45:00.570]
And that goes on and on.

[02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:02.510]
But the bottom line is he's ever moved from office.

[02:45:02.750 --> 02:45:04.890]
He's out, OUT out, out, out.

[02:45:05.010 --> 02:45:05.770]
Bye-bye-bye.

[02:45:06.130 --> 02:45:06.530]
And-

[02:45:06.990 --> 02:45:07.750]
I beg your pardon?

[02:45:07.950 --> 02:45:08.630]
Oath of office?

[02:45:09.130 --> 02:45:09.410]
Oath of-

[02:45:09.410 --> 02:45:11.230]
Isn't that taken over a Bible?

[02:45:11.410 --> 02:45:12.190]
Oath of orifice.

[02:45:12.570 --> 02:45:15.190]
And when people are sworn in, isn't that taken over a Bible?

[02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.910]
And that's unfortunate.

[02:45:16.050 --> 02:45:17.490]
Yeah, but the Bible, the pages blank.

[02:45:17.710 --> 02:45:17.890]
Right.

[02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:19.830]
Moore's case has become a magnet.

[02:45:20.070 --> 02:45:20.850]
Maybe it's the Korean.

[02:45:21.010 --> 02:45:22.030]
You don't know. You better check it out.

[02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:24.790]
This is interesting, though.

[02:45:25.490 --> 02:45:26.530]
Republicans drop support.

[02:45:27.150 --> 02:45:28.130]
That's pretty interesting.

[02:45:32.110 --> 02:45:32.790]
It's boring, though.

[02:45:33.130 --> 02:45:34.350]
Like I said, it's not pretty interesting.

[02:45:34.430 --> 02:45:35.710]
I was debating whether to read the rest of that.

[02:45:35.750 --> 02:45:36.150]
But it's boring.

[02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:38.050]
We don't want to bore you, because that's bad news.

[02:45:38.270 --> 02:45:38.990]
If you're boring, you're out.

[02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:39.470]
You're off.

[02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:40.450]
You know what I'm saying, Mo?

[02:45:41.330 --> 02:45:41.510]
Mo?

[02:45:42.030 --> 02:45:42.330]
Absolutely.

[02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:44.270]
Okay, just may want to make sure you're paying attention.

[02:45:44.770 --> 02:45:47.030]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 7, 6, 8, we got 100 bucks out there.

[02:45:47.130 --> 02:45:47.690]
Miguel's appearance.

[02:45:47.850 --> 02:45:49.350]
But the Humper is going to put us over the top.

[02:45:49.350 --> 02:45:51.910]
So with the Humper's check and what we got there, which is 100,

[02:45:52.210 --> 02:45:56.190]
40,000, 205, 40205 for a band of pepper skit.

[02:45:56.190 --> 02:45:56.770]
We'll get there.

[02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.990]
We'll get to a million bucks.

[02:45:59.170 --> 02:46:02.030]
You know, I see some of these people, some of these celebrities

[02:46:02.030 --> 02:46:04.370]
that go out to these celebrity golf tournaments

[02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:05.850]
and some of these other charitable things.

[02:46:06.010 --> 02:46:08.890]
And in a couple of hours, they raise like 500 grand.

[02:46:10.030 --> 02:46:13.090]
And I realize this is only one show on this horseball radio station.

[02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:17.010]
But boy, we really have to work hard to raise just 50 to 100 grand every year.

[02:46:17.010 --> 02:46:20.090]
I mean, we have to just bust our balls and embarrass people into it.

[02:46:20.270 --> 02:46:22.430]
And of course, once the first few CDs get out there,

[02:46:22.470 --> 02:46:24.070]
they start like, you know, making copies.

[02:46:24.070 --> 02:46:26.130]
And because they like that price a lot better.

[02:46:27.530 --> 02:46:28.550]
But we'll get there.

[02:46:29.670 --> 02:46:30.850]
Here's a call from Cutler Ridge.

[02:46:30.970 --> 02:46:31.130]
Hello.

[02:46:31.890 --> 02:46:33.490]
Good afternoon, Mr. Neal.

[02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.970]
Yes, sir.

[02:46:34.330 --> 02:46:35.330]
This is a young lady.

[02:46:35.530 --> 02:46:36.310]
Are you a yes man?

[02:46:36.610 --> 02:46:37.450]
Yes, ma'am.

[02:46:37.970 --> 02:46:38.670]
Mr. Neal.

[02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:43.010]
I listen to, as a matter of fact, I talk to you the day that for real started.

[02:46:43.670 --> 02:46:45.470]
And I'm just like this.

[02:46:45.470 --> 02:46:50.970]
Maybe you should take the medium of, say, Joe, Joe, and Big Dog

[02:46:50.970 --> 02:46:52.730]
and put them on them back on the morning show.

[02:46:52.970 --> 02:46:53.670]
I agree with you.

[02:46:53.790 --> 02:46:55.130]
For some of the works, don't fix it.

[02:46:55.690 --> 02:46:58.130]
And instead of looking at for real at the corporate,

[02:46:58.270 --> 02:47:00.670]
it's like the ESPN move at Rush Limbaugh.

[02:47:01.410 --> 02:47:02.450]
Great re-bought this man.

[02:47:02.630 --> 02:47:03.850]
And you know where he was.

[02:47:04.070 --> 02:47:04.290]
Right.

[02:47:04.490 --> 02:47:05.590]
I said that before.

[02:47:05.710 --> 02:47:06.530]
He knew what he was going to get.

[02:47:06.650 --> 02:47:06.990]
That's right.

[02:47:07.210 --> 02:47:08.690]
So it's not like on for real.

[02:47:08.910 --> 02:47:11.070]
You know, I look at the corporate as Greg Reed.

[02:47:11.270 --> 02:47:12.710]
And in his studies, like you said,

[02:47:12.850 --> 02:47:14.010]
but that's not the morning show.

[02:47:14.010 --> 02:47:15.990]
When you go to the store and buy butter pecan ice cream,

[02:47:16.050 --> 02:47:17.850]
and you take it home and take the first spoonful and say,

[02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:19.650]
this tastes like crap because I don't like butter pecan.

[02:47:19.910 --> 02:47:20.830]
What the hell'd you buy it for?

[02:47:21.570 --> 02:47:21.950]
Big bag.

[02:47:22.090 --> 02:47:22.230]
Right?

[02:47:22.530 --> 02:47:23.330]
You know what to expect.

[02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:24.450]
That's exactly correct.

[02:47:24.450 --> 02:47:27.210]
That's what he is getting, what he does on cause.

[02:47:27.810 --> 02:47:31.110]
At the same time, why did he mess up the morning show?

[02:47:31.730 --> 02:47:33.390]
I mean, why don't bring back D-fold?

[02:47:34.210 --> 02:47:36.950]
Isn't it interesting, though, to see here we are two years later,

[02:47:37.310 --> 02:47:39.990]
and he's still suffering from having messed around with success,

[02:47:40.230 --> 02:47:40.810]
from messing with everyone?

[02:47:41.130 --> 02:47:41.970]
I've seen this happen.

[02:47:41.970 --> 02:47:44.210]
So many stations, they never recover once they start

[02:47:44.210 --> 02:47:45.510]
Diddling Around with that morning show.

[02:47:45.610 --> 02:47:46.850]
It was a great setup.

[02:47:46.850 --> 02:47:48.130]
It was a great combination.

[02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:49.570]
The chemistry worked very well.

[02:47:49.730 --> 02:47:52.010]
Things were going on a little bit too well for Greg.

[02:47:52.010 --> 02:47:53.950]
You know, he just doesn't know how to handle success.

[02:47:54.130 --> 02:47:55.270]
Well, let me ask you something else.

[02:47:55.330 --> 02:47:57.610]
I've sitting here on my kitty cat that's whether or not this counts.

[02:47:58.010 --> 02:48:00.310]
I'm sitting here on my kitty cat from a doctor pet.

[02:48:00.450 --> 02:48:02.270]
But my son and I got it a year ago.

[02:48:02.370 --> 02:48:02.530]
Yeah.

[02:48:02.850 --> 02:48:03.370]
Is this count?

[02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:04.930]
We pay $50 for it.

[02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.550]
Oh, that counts.

[02:48:05.710 --> 02:48:06.630]
That counts.

[02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:07.970]
Okay, one more thing, Neil.

[02:48:08.090 --> 02:48:08.350]
And let's go.

[02:48:08.390 --> 02:48:10.090]
I have like 100 million questions for you.

[02:48:10.090 --> 02:48:14.530]
But I really don't want to let that all over the lab for like 35 minutes.

[02:48:14.530 --> 02:48:14.890]
Right.

[02:48:15.550 --> 02:48:16.950]
But I want to ask you this.

[02:48:17.690 --> 02:48:18.710]
The water rock.

[02:48:19.930 --> 02:48:21.990]
Now George was calling in the escalation.

[02:48:22.130 --> 02:48:23.150]
Is this going to be like his bed?

[02:48:23.310 --> 02:48:24.830]
Because it doesn't look like it's complete to me.

[02:48:25.050 --> 02:48:25.390]
The water?

[02:48:25.630 --> 02:48:26.530]
Then it's going to complete the job.

[02:48:26.650 --> 02:48:27.950]
And now it looks like he didn't complete the job.

[02:48:28.090 --> 02:48:30.550]
Because he's man stood up these people again and stood them back in.

[02:48:30.990 --> 02:48:31.690]
What's going on?

[02:48:31.890 --> 02:48:33.310]
Every morning is 26.25.

[02:48:33.430 --> 02:48:35.530]
This is more than when we were in actual combat.

[02:48:35.790 --> 02:48:35.990]
Right.

[02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:38.270]
What's happening, Neil?

[02:48:38.270 --> 02:48:39.790]
What's happening is the disasters.

[02:48:39.930 --> 02:48:40.610]
What's happening?

[02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:42.190]
I mean, it's beyond it.

[02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.730]
I mean, it's beyond it.

[02:48:42.750 --> 02:48:46.130]
I'd be sentenced like the middle of November and we're only less than a year now away from the election.

[02:48:46.130 --> 02:48:48.990]
I'd be planning right now to vote at least 15, 20 times next year.

[02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:50.610]
But how does, I mean, even you get a Democrat.

[02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:52.330]
How do you correct something like this?

[02:48:52.450 --> 02:48:53.510]
It's like, it's no way.

[02:48:53.530 --> 02:48:56.030]
How do you correct them like this is you get all the Americans out of there.

[02:48:56.110 --> 02:48:57.410]
Let all the other goody too.

[02:48:57.430 --> 02:48:58.830]
She's let the Brits do it on their own.

[02:48:59.170 --> 02:49:00.350]
Let Tony Blair fight it out.

[02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:01.730]
I guess she got a point.

[02:49:01.950 --> 02:49:02.450]
Let him do it.

[02:49:02.450 --> 02:49:03.950]
Let him send Princess Charlie over there.

[02:49:04.030 --> 02:49:04.750]
He'll take care of him.

[02:49:04.750 --> 02:49:05.990]
You know what this also is?

[02:49:06.550 --> 02:49:08.350]
Every system all is one to world series.

[02:49:08.570 --> 02:49:12.070]
It's all for zealot ones, the hurricane zealot ones, and for rail gets fired.

[02:49:12.310 --> 02:49:13.130]
The person tomorrow is back.

[02:49:13.330 --> 02:49:14.390]
And my keening got fired.

[02:49:14.550 --> 02:49:15.230]
You can.

[02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:16.050]
Oh boy.

[02:49:16.230 --> 02:49:16.870]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:18.070]
I'll see you at the border.

[02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:19.650]
Vote early and often, honey.

[02:49:20.170 --> 02:49:21.150]
Let's people are evil.

[02:49:21.850 --> 02:49:23.390]
Five, six, seven, oh five, 60.

[02:49:24.070 --> 02:49:28.070]
Pound five, 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:30.090]
Here's beautiful West Palm Beach.

[02:49:30.090 --> 02:49:30.350]
Hello.

[02:49:31.130 --> 02:49:32.030]
Hi, Neil.

[02:49:32.270 --> 02:49:32.590]
Yes, sir.

[02:49:32.590 --> 02:49:34.650]
So glad to have you back where you belong.

[02:49:34.810 --> 02:49:35.310]
Oh, sure.

[02:49:35.450 --> 02:49:36.070]
That's what you think.

[02:49:36.490 --> 02:49:37.410]
Just take a good look.

[02:49:37.410 --> 02:49:38.270]
You won't see me long.

[02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:39.070]
Hello, Dolly.

[02:49:39.330 --> 02:49:39.430]
Yeah.

[02:49:39.950 --> 02:49:43.190]
Listen, that guy, that guy, that guy, that guy, that fired there.

[02:49:43.830 --> 02:49:45.870]
He got, he didn't really belong there.

[02:49:46.570 --> 02:49:47.450]
What does that mean?

[02:49:47.910 --> 02:49:50.110]
Well, I mean, with that rusty voice, you know, and all of that,

[02:49:50.270 --> 02:49:51.250]
person and everything else.

[02:49:51.310 --> 02:49:51.490]
Yeah.

[02:49:51.930 --> 02:49:52.550]
I didn't like that.

[02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:57.990]
You know, the other thing is, there's mad dogs to be there on your list.

[02:49:58.570 --> 02:49:59.290]
He is on the list.

[02:49:59.470 --> 02:49:59.610]
Yeah.

[02:49:59.990 --> 02:50:01.270]
And one more thing.

[02:50:01.270 --> 02:50:05.590]
You know that, when you, you, Mark Arnold saying, California.

[02:50:06.010 --> 02:50:06.290]
California.

[02:50:06.670 --> 02:50:07.590]
You got to say what California?

[02:50:07.870 --> 02:50:10.250]
That's an Indian word, meaning gold.

[02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:11.990]
Do you want some?

[02:50:12.290 --> 02:50:12.970]
I see.

[02:50:13.170 --> 02:50:14.890]
That's what Callie, for you means.

[02:50:15.130 --> 02:50:15.290]
Gold.

[02:50:15.650 --> 02:50:17.630]
Callie is gold and from the Indians.

[02:50:17.770 --> 02:50:19.750]
And the answer is absolutely.

[02:50:20.270 --> 02:50:20.970]
And I'm proud.

[02:50:21.610 --> 02:50:21.630]
And I'm proud.

[02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:26.890]
And I'm proud to be something for the war on this vice president of ours.

[02:50:27.110 --> 02:50:29.110]
I'm going to fact you some on that so you can read it.

[02:50:29.110 --> 02:50:30.330]
So I'm very interesting.

[02:50:31.410 --> 02:50:33.350]
Besides the oil bullshit that they've been.

[02:50:34.370 --> 02:50:35.490]
Okay, well, he was going along.

[02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:36.410]
I just had this feeling.

[02:50:36.550 --> 02:50:37.150]
I don't know what it was.

[02:50:37.310 --> 02:50:38.490]
I had this feeling in the pit of my stomach.

[02:50:38.490 --> 02:50:39.350]
He was going to burn out.

[02:50:39.490 --> 02:50:40.250]
Okay, send it along, pal.

[02:50:40.250 --> 02:50:41.290]
But watch out the bushman.

[02:50:41.970 --> 02:50:42.850]
I can't believe it.

[02:50:42.890 --> 02:50:44.130]
Mo was actually saying bushman.

[02:50:44.250 --> 02:50:44.870]
Isn't that incredible?

[02:50:45.230 --> 02:50:45.750]
Mo and Gildi.

[02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:46.690]
His people are evil.

[02:50:48.690 --> 02:50:49.890]
137 for Rick and Spud.

[02:50:49.950 --> 02:50:50.810]
I sure want them on here.

[02:50:50.930 --> 02:50:52.230]
They don't do a sports show.

[02:50:52.230 --> 02:50:52.990]
Don't you people understand?

[02:50:53.110 --> 02:50:54.630]
It's my fault for putting them on in the first place.

[02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:55.330]
It's just a tease.

[02:50:56.430 --> 02:50:56.730]
383.

[02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.650]
383 votes.

[02:50:57.650 --> 02:50:59.030]
And this is our second poll of the day.

[02:51:00.370 --> 02:51:00.910]
Don't care.

[02:51:01.090 --> 02:51:02.710]
I won't listen to matter what you put on 8 to 10.

[02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:03.250]
72.

[02:51:03.770 --> 02:51:05.090]
Jeff the 4 is 51.

[02:51:05.490 --> 02:51:06.210]
Mad Dog 39.

[02:51:06.570 --> 02:51:07.930]
Defoe is kicking some ass in there.

[02:51:08.010 --> 02:51:08.490]
You notice that?

[02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:09.670]
That's pretty amazing.

[02:51:10.570 --> 02:51:11.430]
Joe Rose 38.

[02:51:11.910 --> 02:51:12.510]
The big.

[02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:13.070]
Oh.

[02:51:13.470 --> 02:51:13.650]
20.

[02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:15.110]
That's.

[02:51:15.490 --> 02:51:15.850]
That's.

[02:51:16.710 --> 02:51:18.030]
I call for an investigation.

[02:51:19.350 --> 02:51:20.010]
Mo and Gildi.

[02:51:20.050 --> 02:51:20.710]
All four hours.

[02:51:20.850 --> 02:51:21.490]
6 to 10 a.m.

[02:51:21.610 --> 02:51:22.070]
Only a dozen.

[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:23.890]
Same doesn't have been under for like a half an hour.

[02:51:24.190 --> 02:51:25.650]
Kimba Bo camper 9 and Joseph Gackie.

[02:51:25.650 --> 02:51:26.950]
He poor Joe's only got five.

[02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:28.910]
Even though he crushed it.

[02:51:29.270 --> 02:51:30.010]
He's got five.

[02:51:30.590 --> 02:51:31.950]
26 past one at five.

[02:51:32.030 --> 02:51:32.790]
60 WQM.

[02:51:32.810 --> 02:51:34.750]
We got the mad dog coming along at two.

[02:51:34.830 --> 02:51:36.290]
I guarantee he has a finger to say.

[02:51:36.970 --> 02:51:38.270]
He knows what this place is all about.

[02:51:38.430 --> 02:51:39.790]
He's been around a block a few times.

[02:51:40.130 --> 02:51:42.790]
The Humper at four was racing rushing on in here with that check.

[02:51:42.930 --> 02:51:43.550]
Thanks again, Hank.

[02:51:44.170 --> 02:51:45.590]
500 bucks for abandonment, pay rescue.

[02:51:45.830 --> 02:51:46.590]
A man who really cares.

[02:51:46.870 --> 02:51:48.170]
Here's enough to set his very best.

[02:51:49.870 --> 02:51:51.370]
Probably cashed a good bet last night.

[02:51:51.790 --> 02:51:52.970]
Wish I would have hit Pompano Park.

[02:51:53.250 --> 02:51:54.270]
I was at Track last night.

[02:51:54.270 --> 02:51:55.670]
Some Bozo comes down.

[02:51:55.870 --> 02:51:58.170]
Now, Fratbridge and I are sitting there with a farting contest.

[02:51:58.890 --> 02:52:00.710]
And some Bozo comes down and like,

[02:52:00.930 --> 02:52:02.530]
Oh, Neil, good to see you.

[02:52:02.670 --> 02:52:03.430]
What do you know?

[02:52:03.670 --> 02:52:04.990]
61, you don't look so bad.

[02:52:05.230 --> 02:52:06.130]
And what do you bet?

[02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:07.010]
To effect it is, you know.

[02:52:07.450 --> 02:52:09.090]
This guy, I fell like a SME.

[02:52:09.090 --> 02:52:11.170]
Are you writing a book or something you asshole get out of here?

[02:52:11.670 --> 02:52:13.970]
An old like a goofball retarget guy.

[02:52:14.110 --> 02:52:15.190]
Don't come near my table again.

[02:52:15.330 --> 02:52:16.250]
You would have to have him kicked out.

[02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:17.890]
The good news is,

[02:52:17.950 --> 02:52:20.950]
though sitting to my left down in the just below our table in the track.

[02:52:21.610 --> 02:52:22.890]
There was a young couple there.

[02:52:22.890 --> 02:52:24.710]
I would say like maybe 22 or 23.

[02:52:25.390 --> 02:52:27.150]
And I'm going to tell you whatever you like.

[02:52:27.150 --> 02:52:28.250]
It was all in that table.

[02:52:28.450 --> 02:52:29.930]
I shouldn't say that because I'll be back.

[02:52:30.530 --> 02:52:30.890]
Woo!

[02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.510]
Man.

[02:52:32.750 --> 02:52:33.470]
She had...

[02:52:33.470 --> 02:52:34.270]
Talk about a wreck.

[02:52:34.650 --> 02:52:35.730]
And he was...

[02:52:35.730 --> 02:52:36.950]
He was prettier than she was.

[02:52:37.130 --> 02:52:37.390]
Blonde.

[02:52:38.170 --> 02:52:38.430]
Hmm.

[02:52:39.090 --> 02:52:39.390]
Anyway.

[02:52:40.430 --> 02:52:42.490]
Well, I then left after the third or fourth race.

[02:52:42.490 --> 02:52:43.590]
And I kind of like a gut distracted.

[02:52:43.930 --> 02:52:45.290]
I thought, well, maybe I've won where they're going.

[02:52:45.370 --> 02:52:45.970]
What they're going to be doing.

[02:52:46.930 --> 02:52:48.170]
Hey, speaking of mattresses.

[02:52:48.510 --> 02:52:50.290]
I'm actually that's where they were headed out to a great mattress.

[02:52:50.470 --> 02:52:51.710]
And God only knows what they were doing on it.

[02:52:51.750 --> 02:52:52.330]
I'm like, you sure imagine.

[02:52:52.330 --> 02:52:54.470]
I can conjure a few things up in my mind.

[02:52:54.970 --> 02:52:57.250]
Anyway, if you'd like to have a great dial amatress for doing that,

[02:52:57.350 --> 02:52:59.190]

[02:52:59.630 --> 02:53:00.210]
Dial amatress.

[02:53:00.430 --> 02:53:01.730]

When it's convenient for you, when your ass is going to be home.

[02:53:31.470 --> 02:53:33.050]
I've been sleeping on a dial amatress for years.

[02:53:33.050 --> 02:53:34.470]

you a.m.

[02:54:11.910 --> 02:54:14.430]
Maybe you melt my jockey shorts.

[02:54:15.850 --> 02:54:17.130]
That's Jessica's.

[02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:20.750]
Jessica, I'm home.

[02:54:21.150 --> 02:54:21.810]
My beginner.

[02:54:22.030 --> 02:54:23.210]
Oh, hi, Homer.

[02:54:23.590 --> 02:54:24.650]
We're having chicken.

[02:54:24.930 --> 02:54:25.370]
Woo-hoo!

[02:54:25.890 --> 02:54:27.030]
Or is it tuna?

[02:54:27.350 --> 02:54:27.650]
No.

[02:54:28.410 --> 02:54:29.790]
I don't get it.

[02:54:29.970 --> 02:54:31.650]
I even can't sense chicken.

[02:54:31.810 --> 02:54:33.790]
But it tastes like tuna.

[02:54:34.110 --> 02:54:34.290]
No!

[02:54:34.390 --> 02:54:38.910]
The Jessica Simpsons, it's TV's first animated reality show

[02:54:38.910 --> 02:54:42.150]
with two dimensional Homer and one dimensional Jessica.

[02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:43.270]
Oh, forget it.

[02:54:43.450 --> 02:54:44.950]
Let's just order some buffalo wings.

[02:54:45.390 --> 02:54:46.670]
Ew, Homer.

[02:54:47.290 --> 02:54:48.210]
I don't eat buffalo.

[02:54:48.970 --> 02:54:50.110]
Don't be silly, Jessica.

[02:54:50.610 --> 02:54:52.930]
Everybody knows buffalo wings are made from chicken.

[02:54:53.550 --> 02:54:55.810]
Oh, the chicken of the sea?

[02:54:56.330 --> 02:54:58.490]
No, the Jessica Simpsons.

[02:54:58.830 --> 02:55:02.150]
Because people this dumb could only be in cartoons.

[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.550]
Right?

[02:55:03.950 --> 02:55:06.990]
Right, 132-Sold, Joe Castellan just came in as very wounded.

[02:55:07.130 --> 02:55:08.150]
We're going to put him on right away.

[02:55:08.530 --> 02:55:09.870]
Maybe you think you have to call Eric or not.

[02:55:11.730 --> 02:55:14.150]
Or maybe you'll just send him a fast real quick.

[02:55:15.930 --> 02:55:17.430]
Joe and Mark need to be on the list.

[02:55:17.550 --> 02:55:18.550]
And Joe had a good point.

[02:55:18.690 --> 02:55:19.970]
I mean, if we got the big O on there,

[02:55:19.970 --> 02:55:21.970]
and we got, you know, putting Mo and Gelty together

[02:55:21.970 --> 02:55:23.110]
all four hours, six to ten,

[02:55:23.270 --> 02:55:25.230]
and we got like Joe's a gacky on there in Kimba,

[02:55:25.410 --> 02:55:26.850]
we certainly got to put Joe and Mark on there,

[02:55:27.050 --> 02:55:28.770]
just to make Joe happy and calm down a little bit.

[02:55:28.790 --> 02:55:29.570]
He was hyperventilating.

[02:55:30.350 --> 02:55:33.390]
So we got 40,265 as a right this moment

[02:55:33.390 --> 02:55:34.310]
for a band of pet rescue.

[02:55:34.470 --> 02:55:34.870]
Not too bad.

[02:55:36.490 --> 02:55:38.010]
Not too great, but not too bad either.

[02:55:38.910 --> 02:55:39.850]
153 for Rick and Spirits.

[02:55:40.530 --> 02:55:41.750]
74, don't give a crap.

[02:55:41.850 --> 02:55:43.850]
They will listen for eight to ten if we put a gun to their head.

[02:55:44.210 --> 02:55:47.490]
Jeff to 461, Joe rose 43, Matt Doggy 41.

[02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:48.210]
Look at that.

[02:55:48.310 --> 02:55:48.770]
That's amazing.

[02:55:48.890 --> 02:55:49.950]
They like Matt Dog 2 to 4.

[02:55:50.250 --> 02:55:52.750]
The big O-20, Mo and Gelty 6 to 10, Am 12,

[02:55:53.130 --> 02:55:55.890]
Kimba 10 and Joe's a gacky still out of 419 votes

[02:55:55.890 --> 02:55:56.770]
still stuck with five.

[02:55:57.150 --> 02:55:58.750]
Please put Joe and Mark on there, Eric,

[02:55:58.870 --> 02:56:00.490]
and put down a goddamn sandwiches, would you?

[02:56:00.730 --> 02:56:02.090]
Please, I'm begging you.

[02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:04.110]
If you don't get on there in a couple of minutes,

[02:56:04.670 --> 02:56:05.910]
I'll eat. I'll fax him.

[02:56:07.150 --> 02:56:08.730]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[02:56:08.730 --> 02:56:08.990]
Hello.

[02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:10.770]
Hey, how you doing, Joe?

[02:56:10.770 --> 02:56:11.290]
Pretty good, sir.

[02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:14.530]
The owner of my company, and my young two company,

[02:56:14.770 --> 02:56:17.670]
is well, donate $2,500 for a band of pet rescue.

[02:56:18.030 --> 02:56:18.410]
Oh, right.

[02:56:18.850 --> 02:56:19.450]
Excellent. Outstanding.

[02:56:20.250 --> 02:56:21.850]
Just need to know where we bring the check.

[02:56:22.130 --> 02:56:22.930]
Okay, hang on a second.

[02:56:23.050 --> 02:56:24.070]
I appreciate it.

[02:56:24.070 --> 02:56:24.290]
Okay.

[02:56:24.650 --> 02:56:26.810]
Line 2, take care of that fine gentleman there.

[02:56:26.810 --> 02:56:28.510]
Our great close personal friends, Scott.

[02:56:30.110 --> 02:56:31.650]
Facts is coming in and they say,

[02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:35.530]
Taiwan arrest trainers at Jigalo School.

[02:56:36.110 --> 02:56:39.290]
Police raided the Jigalo training center in northern Taiwan,

[02:56:39.730 --> 02:56:41.150]
and arrested nine of the school's operators

[02:56:41.150 --> 02:56:43.010]
for overcharging students' officials, say, today.

[02:56:43.690 --> 02:56:45.730]
The operators allegedly inflated tuition bills

[02:56:45.730 --> 02:56:48.070]
by adding inexpensive clothing and mobile phones.

[02:56:48.470 --> 02:56:51.390]
Police officer Lou Tai-Soon said they were accused

[02:56:51.390 --> 02:56:53.170]
of having links to organized crimes.

[02:56:53.250 --> 02:56:53.650]
Oi!

[02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.630]
What do you like that?

[02:56:54.970 --> 02:56:55.530]
Not too exciting.

[02:56:56.670 --> 02:57:01.510]
$5,670, $560, $560 on a AT&T in Verizon wireless line.

[02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:03.850]
One thing that predominates during all of this polling today

[02:57:03.850 --> 02:57:06.710]
is the unbelievable unpopularity of a certain individual

[02:57:06.710 --> 02:57:07.350]
in this building.

[02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:08.110]
Absolutely.

[02:57:08.410 --> 02:57:09.390]
Not to mention no names.

[02:57:10.530 --> 02:57:12.030]
Okay, I don't see a Joe and Mark on there,

[02:57:12.050 --> 02:57:13.930]
but I'm sure the Eric is probably tapping it out right now.

[02:57:13.930 --> 02:57:14.770]
He's tapping on it now.

[02:57:15.090 --> 02:57:16.650]
I bet it'll pop up there in no time at all.

[02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:18.870]
Here's Cutler Ridge. Hello.

[02:57:20.090 --> 02:57:20.950]
Hello, the color Ridge.

[02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.690]
Yes sir, speaking.

[02:57:21.810 --> 02:57:22.430]
Hi Neil, how are you?

[02:57:22.570 --> 02:57:22.850]
Pretty good.

[02:57:23.050 --> 02:57:24.470]
Great, hello, Delhi.

[02:57:24.810 --> 02:57:26.030]
This is Neil and George.

[02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:29.970]
Delhi, would you please send over a nice corn beef on rye?

[02:57:30.290 --> 02:57:31.530]
A box of ritz.

[02:57:31.530 --> 02:57:33.590]
Delhi and some slits.

[02:57:33.630 --> 02:57:37.230]
Delhi, some chopped liver and a sliver of your apple pie.

[02:57:37.350 --> 02:57:38.090]
Oh, legs.

[02:57:38.910 --> 02:57:40.410]
Delhi, hard boiled eggs.

[02:57:40.650 --> 02:57:43.930]
Delhi, with tomatoes and potatoes, you French fry.

[02:57:44.550 --> 02:57:46.790]
So please don't be late, Delhi,

[02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:48.130]
because we cannot wait.

[02:57:48.490 --> 02:57:51.370]
Delhi, without our free food, we will die.

[02:57:51.990 --> 02:57:52.430]
Oh right.

[02:57:52.710 --> 02:57:53.350]
That was the best.

[02:57:53.470 --> 02:57:53.890]
Thank you amigo.

[02:57:54.150 --> 02:57:54.750]
Okay brother.

[02:57:55.010 --> 02:57:55.270]
Have a nice day.

[02:57:55.270 --> 02:57:55.950]
I want to have a good day.

[02:57:56.110 --> 02:57:56.230]
I want to have a good day.

[02:57:56.230 --> 02:57:58.730]
I want to have a good day.

[02:57:58.730 --> 02:57:59.210]
Thank you.

[02:57:59.210 --> 02:57:59.690]
I love you.

[02:57:59.710 --> 02:57:59.970]
I love you.

[02:58:00.090 --> 02:58:00.190]
I love you.

[02:58:00.270 --> 02:58:00.410]
I love you.

[02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.410]

[02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.410]

[02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.410]

[02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.510]
Bye bye.

[02:58:00.810 --> 02:58:01.370]
That was beautiful.

[02:58:01.510 --> 02:58:02.190]
Mad Dog's in there.

[02:58:02.210 --> 02:58:03.110]
Looks like he's got a check.

[02:58:04.370 --> 02:58:05.630]
Mad Dog's got a big fat one in there.

[02:58:05.670 --> 02:58:06.070]
What's he got?

[02:58:06.310 --> 02:58:06.750]
What's he got?

[02:58:06.750 --> 02:58:07.150]
Wait a minute.

[02:58:07.330 --> 02:58:08.550]
Before you walk out that door,

[02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:10.090]
when you start 8 to 10?

[02:58:12.530 --> 02:58:13.550]
No, don't do that.

[02:58:13.670 --> 02:58:14.210]
Don't say that.

[02:58:14.470 --> 02:58:14.970]
Are you serious?

[02:58:16.050 --> 02:58:16.370]
Finito?

[02:58:16.950 --> 02:58:17.270]
Pasadena.

[02:58:17.430 --> 02:58:18.450]
Is that the final word?

[02:58:19.090 --> 02:58:19.330]
No.

[02:58:19.850 --> 02:58:19.930]
No.

[02:58:22.050 --> 02:58:23.150]
Pasadena is the big buzzer.

[02:58:23.270 --> 02:58:23.690]
What he means.

[02:58:25.330 --> 02:58:26.690]
The Mad Dog has...

[02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:27.770]
Yes.

[02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:32.130]
A check will be here tomorrow in the amount of...

[02:58:32.130 --> 02:58:32.350]
Yes.

[02:58:32.790 --> 02:58:33.350]
500 dollars.

[02:58:33.350 --> 02:58:33.830]
All right.

[02:58:34.490 --> 02:58:35.050]
See, there you go.

[02:58:35.190 --> 02:58:36.270]
I'm burstin' of my good buddies.

[02:58:36.530 --> 02:58:38.530]
You people out there think that I don't have the power no more.

[02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:39.890]
Okay, we got power right down the hall.

[02:58:40.210 --> 02:58:40.790]
I got them licked.

[02:58:41.350 --> 02:58:43.990]
Can you embarrass them in to give them me a check?

[02:58:44.290 --> 02:58:44.430]
No.

[02:58:44.850 --> 02:58:45.630]
They don't care about you.

[02:58:45.770 --> 02:58:46.690]
40,765.

[02:58:47.590 --> 02:58:48.710]
They like little dougs and cats.

[02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:49.930]
Not the...you...

[02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:52.870]
Whatever creature you might be.

[02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:53.930]
Whatever category you might be.

[02:58:54.010 --> 02:58:55.150]
And we still haven't figured that out yet.

[02:58:56.750 --> 02:58:59.630]
That story wasn't too interesting about that Taiwan with the jiggleos.

[02:58:59.750 --> 02:59:02.970]
But the fact that you're sending it again is rather distressing whoever's sending it out there.

[02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:04.150]
Stop sending it, you idiot.

[02:59:05.810 --> 02:59:06.130]
5667.

[02:59:07.330 --> 02:59:07.650]
0560.

[02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:09.390]
So, Hank and the Mad Dog come through big time.

[02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.910]
I told you.

[02:59:10.250 --> 02:59:11.530]
All it takes is like a little prod.

[02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:12.790]
Embrace him a little bit.

[02:59:13.070 --> 02:59:14.310]
Because they got the big bucks.

[02:59:14.770 --> 02:59:18.530]
So the interesting part about that performance from a man ditch in a doorway there was that...

[02:59:18.530 --> 02:59:20.350]
He's giving me an opacity, not an 8 to 10.

[02:59:20.430 --> 02:59:21.430]
I says, that's the final word?

[02:59:21.630 --> 02:59:21.770]
No.

[02:59:22.990 --> 02:59:25.030]
So if they sweeten the pot just enough.

[02:59:25.190 --> 02:59:27.110]
If they sweeten it, they pick the seeds out of it for him.

[02:59:27.170 --> 02:59:28.770]
He might just say, uh...

[02:59:29.370 --> 02:59:29.430]
Alright.

[02:59:29.950 --> 02:59:29.950]

[02:59:30.310 --> 02:59:31.030]
Let's go for it.

[02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:32.710]
I think that's the cat's meow.

[02:59:32.990 --> 02:59:35.450]
Either there's only two options that I'm seeing.

[02:59:36.170 --> 02:59:37.330]
With all the respect to Joe and Mark.

[02:59:37.470 --> 02:59:38.510]
Did he put Joe and Mark on her yet?

[02:59:38.650 --> 02:59:39.690]
He could cast that off my ass.

[02:59:39.810 --> 02:59:40.530]
Yeah, nice going.

[02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:41.050]
Thank you, Eric.

[02:59:41.650 --> 02:59:42.770]
Eric's been on the ball this week.

[02:59:42.770 --> 02:59:43.890]
He must be, uh, I don't know.

[02:59:44.470 --> 02:59:45.970]
Maybe his wife's cooperating this week.

[02:59:46.350 --> 02:59:47.290]
Joe and Mark don't have any yet.

[02:59:47.370 --> 02:59:48.050]
But you're on there, Joe.

[02:59:48.290 --> 02:59:49.270]
We're giving it our best for you.

[02:59:49.510 --> 02:59:50.610]
If we're my, uh, brothers.

[02:59:50.610 --> 02:59:53.490]
I think Mad Dog, uh, and a lot of you have a good point.

[02:59:53.970 --> 02:59:54.790]
It's a good point.

[02:59:56.030 --> 02:59:57.630]
That is that he is an afternoon guy.

[02:59:57.750 --> 02:59:59.170]
And he and Hank have got a great chemistry there

[02:59:59.170 --> 02:59:59.970]
between two and seven.

[02:59:59.970 --> 03:00:00.870]
The ratings have been gigantic.

[03:00:01.270 --> 03:00:05.170]
But I still say 8 to 10 would be good

[03:00:05.170 --> 03:00:06.350]
in a Hank back to two to six.

[03:00:06.510 --> 03:00:08.650]
Or, shy of that.

[03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:11.050]
Joe Rose, little, uh, little dog back in there.

[03:00:11.110 --> 03:00:11.510]
8 to 10.

[03:00:11.990 --> 03:00:12.850]
Can you see?

[03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.410]
Can you?

[03:00:15.130 --> 03:00:18.370]
Can you even begin to imagine this and have even dawned on me

[03:00:18.370 --> 03:00:19.890]
to show how slow I am?

[03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:23.430]
Can you see that combo between five and eight?

[03:00:23.550 --> 03:00:25.410]
You got more in guilty than eight to 10.

[03:00:26.210 --> 03:00:27.430]
Following hour from Boka.

[03:00:27.750 --> 03:00:28.530]
We'll be the little dog.

[03:00:28.650 --> 03:00:30.670]
They probably have to have like a bodyguard at the doorway there

[03:00:30.670 --> 03:00:32.130]
to protect Mo on the way out every morning.

[03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:34.470]
Talk about a crossover for the crossdresser.

[03:00:35.290 --> 03:00:35.530]
Man.

[03:00:36.570 --> 03:00:40.630]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon line.

[03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:41.770]
Here's a lady in beautiful.

[03:00:41.770 --> 03:00:42.370]
Coconut Creek.

[03:00:42.490 --> 03:00:42.890]
Hello.

[03:00:43.110 --> 03:00:43.750]
Hi, Neil.

[03:00:43.850 --> 03:00:44.290]
How you doing?

[03:00:44.390 --> 03:00:44.650]
Pretty good.

[03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:45.110]
How you being?

[03:00:45.510 --> 03:00:45.770]
Good.

[03:00:45.910 --> 03:00:48.050]
Welcome back to the lovely South Florida.

[03:00:48.210 --> 03:00:48.690]
Oh, sure.

[03:00:50.370 --> 03:00:53.510]
I have suggested I know it's not going to happen in a million years.

[03:00:53.870 --> 03:00:54.530]
But, give it a try.

[03:00:54.930 --> 03:00:56.610]
8 to 2 Neil Rogers.

[03:00:56.970 --> 03:00:57.490]
Yeah, right.

[03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.130]
Right.

[03:00:58.970 --> 03:01:00.830]
That's the only good show I can think of.

[03:01:00.830 --> 03:01:01.850]
I like one to do myself.

[03:01:03.030 --> 03:01:05.290]
Well, my one was absolutely the worst.

[03:01:05.370 --> 03:01:07.050]
That was a pit say just about killed me.

[03:01:07.110 --> 03:01:07.730]
I'll tell you that.

[03:01:07.730 --> 03:01:10.090]
So longer we can have you as a better.

[03:01:10.290 --> 03:01:11.550]
That's all I have to say.

[03:01:12.250 --> 03:01:17.350]
But I missed, I couldn't get in earlier when you were talking about the biggest mistake

[03:01:17.350 --> 03:01:19.670]
at QAMs made the last couple of years.

[03:01:20.710 --> 03:01:23.970]
The one main thing I could think of was putting George on the air.

[03:01:24.290 --> 03:01:29.090]
But I couldn't get into do that.

[03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:32.610]
But I do have for low-car people.

[03:01:32.990 --> 03:01:36.450]
I found a new product that some people might be interested in.

[03:01:36.830 --> 03:01:36.830]

[03:01:41.510 --> 03:01:42.490]
This product was great.

[03:01:42.490 --> 03:01:42.490]

[03:01:42.490 --> 03:01:43.750]
We have it much angrier now.

[03:01:43.750 --> 03:01:43.890]
B induct at this time is rising, No.

[03:01:44.610 --> 03:01:47.090]
The setup is to gain the power and not get the power.

[03:01:47.150 --> 03:01:48.870]
Cause the result

[03:01:48.870 --> 03:02:06.110]
Baby still wounds right in the back of 151 miles

[03:02:06.110 --> 03:02:08.590]
No, half cup, half cup and it's not bad.

[03:02:08.650 --> 03:02:11.290]
Maybe you have a cup of ice cream, is, do you realize what that is?

[03:02:12.010 --> 03:02:13.450]
No, seriously, that's not even a scoop.

[03:02:14.970 --> 03:02:17.290]
That's not even enough to make a poop, much less a scoop.

[03:02:19.110 --> 03:02:20.450]
Well, I know it's not.

[03:02:20.750 --> 03:02:25.610]
I mean, it isn't a pathetic that they can't make all of these things carb-free.

[03:02:25.810 --> 03:02:29.690]
Well, I'm surprised Ben and Jerry's really hasn't come up with something.

[03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:32.570]
Because I really think if they did it, they could make it really...

[03:02:32.570 --> 03:02:33.870]
Why did you say Ben and Jerry's?

[03:02:33.890 --> 03:02:34.590]
Why did you do that?

[03:02:35.790 --> 03:02:36.910]
Coffee, he's barcrunched.

[03:02:36.910 --> 03:02:37.950]
Oh, don't say it.

[03:02:38.010 --> 03:02:38.510]
Don't say it.

[03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:40.270]
Coffee, coffee crunch.

[03:02:41.070 --> 03:02:43.430]
I won't say coffee, he's barcrunched.

[03:02:43.530 --> 03:02:49.190]
But I will say, I have a question for you and it might be a stupid question, but...

[03:02:51.930 --> 03:02:56.570]
When you leave Florida and then you go to Toronto or wherever you go,

[03:02:56.570 --> 03:03:01.490]
is there anything at all you miss about South Florida when you leave?

[03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:03.490]
I miss some of my friends, I miss going to the track.

[03:03:04.490 --> 03:03:05.170]
That's about it.

[03:03:05.290 --> 03:03:08.810]
I sure almost been in this place and almost the humidity and I'm not really loud.

[03:03:09.370 --> 03:03:12.250]
I miss some of my friends and I miss going to the track with a fat man and dirt,

[03:03:12.470 --> 03:03:13.470]
but other than that, not nothing.

[03:03:14.090 --> 03:03:16.410]
I was always wondering if that would make a good poll,

[03:03:16.410 --> 03:03:20.570]
if you were forced to leave Florida tomorrow, if there was one thing you would...

[03:03:20.570 --> 03:03:22.130]
Nobody has to force me, I'll tell you that.

[03:03:22.510 --> 03:03:23.370]
Yeah, you used to be a slut.

[03:03:23.550 --> 03:03:24.730]
You're the lucky one, so I'm sure.

[03:03:24.730 --> 03:03:29.570]
I used to miss my dogs, but you know, I used to miss that and I felt really bad about that.

[03:03:29.710 --> 03:03:30.290]
I'm sorry about that.

[03:03:30.290 --> 03:03:32.150]
I did for a while too, but...

[03:03:32.150 --> 03:03:37.350]
You know, I just wanted to say, I thought you were going to say you missed your Corvette's the most.

[03:03:38.630 --> 03:03:39.030]
But...

[03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:40.830]
I want to tell you something about that.

[03:03:41.150 --> 03:03:46.130]
Someday morning, I got in my Corvette, we really went to public centers and there's not no traffic at 830 in the morning,

[03:03:47.070 --> 03:03:48.590]
and I enjoyed my car...

[03:03:48.590 --> 03:03:51.610]
Because I love my Corvette's, I enjoyed my car, and not that I went all that fast,

[03:03:51.770 --> 03:03:55.510]
but there was nobody on the road and it just felt so beautiful and so cool in that car.

[03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:58.170]
But the rest of the time when I'm driving on all these assholes out there,

[03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:59.530]
it would make any difference what you're driving.

[03:03:59.770 --> 03:04:02.550]
I have no car in Toronto and I don't miss driving at all.

[03:04:02.770 --> 03:04:02.870]
None.

[03:04:03.430 --> 03:04:06.030]
Oh, I know, when you're in a good city, I lived in Boston for a while.

[03:04:06.190 --> 03:04:07.150]
You didn't need a car.

[03:04:07.150 --> 03:04:07.850]
You don't need a car.

[03:04:08.250 --> 03:04:11.530]
You just walked everywhere you went, and you know, you felt a lot better.

[03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:15.790]
But I was just curious to that if there was anything most...

[03:04:15.790 --> 03:04:16.230]
Not much.

[03:04:16.250 --> 03:04:18.250]
I mean, I know you missed your friends and stuff like that.

[03:04:18.250 --> 03:04:18.990]
And that's about it.

[03:04:19.050 --> 03:04:19.790]
Have a great day, sweetheart.

[03:04:20.250 --> 03:04:20.710]
Thanks a lot.

[03:04:20.910 --> 03:04:23.090]
Take care, and the only thing I can't catch is Toronto.

[03:04:23.230 --> 03:04:23.550]
See you.

[03:04:24.650 --> 03:04:27.510]
141 at 560 WQM, speaking of the low-carb ice cream,

[03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:30.450]
in fact, they got that low carb carbolite ice cream at Delights,

[03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:33.270]
and they've got over a thousand other low-carb products in stock.

[03:04:33.730 --> 03:04:36.330]
You know, that's the thing for diners on the Atkins or other low-carb diets.

[03:04:36.330 --> 03:04:38.590]
It's so easy to get the steak and the cheese and the seafood,

[03:04:38.910 --> 03:04:40.250]
but after that, what do you do?

[03:04:40.370 --> 03:04:41.450]
It's easy to get that good meat.

[03:04:42.030 --> 03:04:44.310]
But once you got the good meat, you've got to have something else with some taste.

[03:04:44.310 --> 03:04:47.030]
Everybody knows that, because all of us fat folks, we got a sweet tooth.

[03:04:47.350 --> 03:04:51.350]
We want something with some taste in it like walnut brownies by Contrulcarb.

[03:04:51.670 --> 03:04:52.950]
Southern light chocolate chip cookies,

[03:04:53.370 --> 03:04:57.130]
carbolite candy coated chocolate covered peanuts, apple cinnamon granola by Carbsense,

the way you are.

[03:06:12.730 --> 03:06:14.930]
Don't go breaking apart.

[03:06:16.450 --> 03:06:18.950]
Stop breaking my balls.

[03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:22.670]
We drove the window.

[03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:26.550]
Come on, stop breaking my balls.

[03:06:29.530 --> 03:06:34.250]
You're a group that's a hunt in the road, huh?

[03:06:36.190 --> 03:06:38.370]
I let one speak out.

[03:06:38.370 --> 03:06:40.050]
I see a blue cloud.

[03:06:40.730 --> 03:06:42.250]
I limped it my lane.

[03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:43.830]
It's not like a day.

[03:06:46.370 --> 03:06:48.910]
You're a group that's a hunter.

[03:06:52.070 --> 03:06:54.050]
Try to hold in your fog.

[03:06:55.630 --> 03:06:58.050]
I'll try but that's not a hard.

[03:06:58.330 --> 03:06:59.750]
Don't go breaking the fog.

[03:07:01.230 --> 03:07:03.430]
Then don't buy those hot pots.

[03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:05.030]
Don't go breaking up.

[03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:06.990]
Don't go breaking up.

[03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:08.770]
Don't go breaking up.

[03:07:13.010 --> 03:07:14.390]
Don't go breaking up.

[03:07:15.610 --> 03:07:16.110]
Don't go breaking up.

[03:07:18.070 --> 03:07:20.750]
Okay, same as concerned, Operation Iron A Hammer.

[03:07:21.310 --> 03:07:23.010]
We're dropping some more bombas over there.

[03:07:23.150 --> 03:07:26.150]
We're continuing like very discreetly, very selectively.

[03:07:26.510 --> 03:07:29.710]
And if there's any collateral damage and a few people die who weren't supposed to, too bad.

[03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:32.150]
Operation Iron A Hammer is continuing.

[03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.790]
Hey, hammer!

[03:07:33.050 --> 03:07:33.970]
How you doing, hammer?

[03:07:35.210 --> 03:07:38.270]
Here's a faction mallet who's just out of control says I have a suggestion.

[03:07:38.550 --> 03:07:40.710]
Bring back Bill Zinfra to call the dolphin games of the mad dog.

[03:07:40.710 --> 03:07:43.790]
You're rid of Howard David and give the 6 to 10 AM showed a goldie alone.

[03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:44.650]
Oh no.

[03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:49.490]
See, that's what goldie was actually saying because Norma Kent advised him.

[03:07:50.610 --> 03:07:51.630]
Remember that in the Godfather?

[03:07:52.030 --> 03:07:52.870]
I advised Michael.

[03:07:53.810 --> 03:07:54.810]
Norma Kent advised Gully.

[03:07:54.890 --> 03:07:58.930]
It said, oh, you ought to do the show alone and everybody else said, hey Norma, go back to your, uh, a factory.

[03:07:59.030 --> 03:07:59.890]
Okay, get lost.

[03:08:00.050 --> 03:08:00.770]
You're a crazy person.

[03:08:00.910 --> 03:08:01.590]
And they were right.

[03:08:03.130 --> 03:08:04.190]
Gully, it's a miracle.

[03:08:04.410 --> 03:08:07.470]
Here's a guy that keeps, uh, he's one of those people just like Robert Creeper.

[03:08:07.530 --> 03:08:11.370]
He keeps hanging on and hanging on and no matter what's going on around him, he's still hanging on.

[03:08:11.790 --> 03:08:15.350]
And then you go to the macaroon of the hockey game and there's that push up there on the screen.

[03:08:15.470 --> 03:08:16.390]
Man, man, man.

[03:08:16.470 --> 03:08:17.830]
You know, that's real voice.

[03:08:18.210 --> 03:08:19.210]
That piercing sound.

[03:08:19.410 --> 03:08:21.270]
Man, tonight in the NHL, man.

[03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:25.190]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello.

[03:08:25.650 --> 03:08:29.510]
Uh, I think it's pretty sad, you know, uh, he was the only, you know,

[03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:33.670]
the only sports show I would listen to me because he had humor, you know, he was funny.

[03:08:33.870 --> 03:08:34.570]
He was entertaining.

[03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:35.710]
You know, entertaining.

[03:08:35.850 --> 03:08:36.530]
He was a panic.

[03:08:36.830 --> 03:08:39.510]
You know, I had friends who come out of town and they were like, who's this guy?

[03:08:39.670 --> 03:08:40.810]
You know, I don't have a ride.

[03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:41.130]
Right.

[03:08:41.750 --> 03:08:46.010]
You know, I mean, whatever, just don't put Howard in Gully because that's just, I mean,

[03:08:46.170 --> 03:08:46.170]

[03:08:46.170 --> 03:08:47.250]
Sure, I want to tell you something.

[03:08:47.390 --> 03:08:51.430]
There's about as much chance of Moe doing eight to ten as the risk of you going in the backyard right now

[03:08:51.430 --> 03:08:53.670]
and finding $80 million in small bills.

[03:08:55.010 --> 03:08:58.810]
Well, I guess I'll have to listen Howard's sperm now and then, uh, I don't know.

[03:08:58.810 --> 03:08:59.890]
I think it's sad.

[03:09:00.030 --> 03:09:02.770]
And by the way, if you're $80 million, don't forget about me.

[03:09:02.950 --> 03:09:03.490]
I won.

[03:09:03.590 --> 03:09:04.350]
Okay, thanks a lot.

[03:09:04.950 --> 03:09:05.910]
Thanks a lot, pal.

[03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.330]
Later.

[03:09:07.950 --> 03:09:08.390]
$5670560.

[03:09:08.990 --> 03:09:15.230]
Is there any chance that Moe and Gully are going to be in fact, it's interesting because both in the very jackass and the, um,

[03:09:15.770 --> 03:09:19.870]
Tom Jerkho columns, it's made pretty clear that it ain't could have happened.

[03:09:20.090 --> 03:09:21.870]
In fact, where's that one thing?

[03:09:23.510 --> 03:09:24.510]
Read ruled out.

[03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:25.710]
Read ruled out.

[03:09:25.790 --> 03:09:28.490]
Returning Howard, David and Steve Goldstein to the six to tenium slot.

[03:09:28.830 --> 03:09:29.770]
And of course, he would love.

[03:09:29.890 --> 03:09:33.990]
He would, he would rub his hind legs together if he could find a way to get Moe to hell out of here.

[03:09:34.090 --> 03:09:35.110]
Greg, I mean, that's the truth.

[03:09:35.270 --> 03:09:38.390]
I'm not saying that he told me that, but, uh, I just, I can feel it.

[03:09:38.610 --> 03:09:39.010]
You know what I'm saying?

[03:09:39.310 --> 03:09:40.070]
You know, they got the what?

[03:09:40.390 --> 03:09:40.810]
Yeah, look.

[03:09:42.330 --> 03:09:46.310]
He would love to see you for the last time Moe make no mistake about that.

[03:09:46.750 --> 03:09:48.670]
In fact, I heard him in a hallway singing.

[03:09:49.050 --> 03:09:50.810]
Did you hear a Greg this morning singing a hallway?

[03:09:50.810 --> 03:09:51.730]
He was going.

[03:09:51.950 --> 03:09:53.590]
No, no, no, no, no.

[03:09:53.590 --> 03:09:55.130]
Yeah, he was singing it over and over again.

[03:09:55.350 --> 03:09:56.810]
No, no, no, no, no.

[03:09:56.810 --> 03:09:58.190]
I was picking seeds out of his butt.

[03:09:59.190 --> 03:10:00.870]
It's a 10-till-two at QA.

[03:10:00.870 --> 03:10:04.630]
And we got the Mad Dog standing by who donated to very generous 500 bucks to a band of pet rescue.

[03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:05.610]
As did the Humper.

[03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:06.770]
So there's a grand right there.

[03:10:07.210 --> 03:10:09.510]
See, you saw the power of Neal in action today, Scott.

[03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.430]
Amazing.

[03:10:10.690 --> 03:10:16.490]
Is I squeezed and carried on like a child and begged and pleaded and prodded and poked?

[03:10:16.850 --> 03:10:18.470]
And Joe Kustel and did the same thing.

[03:10:18.470 --> 03:10:19.550]
And he was prodding and poking.

[03:10:20.110 --> 03:10:20.990]
I said, don't stop.

[03:10:21.130 --> 03:10:21.830]
It feels pretty good.

[03:10:22.270 --> 03:10:22.970]
But you're on the list.

[03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:25.090]
You don't have any votes yet, but you're on the list.

[03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:26.150]
No, you've got a four.

[03:10:27.010 --> 03:10:28.090]
You've been under only a few minutes.

[03:10:28.090 --> 03:10:28.710]
You already got four.

[03:10:28.850 --> 03:10:32.350]
In fact, you're going to pass Joe Zagaki like he's standing still, which isn't saying much.

[03:10:32.590 --> 03:10:33.410]
But you're going to pass Joe.

[03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:34.110]
He's a Gaki.

[03:10:35.490 --> 03:10:36.230]
And I'll say it again.

[03:10:36.410 --> 03:10:39.730]
Zagaki's a really good guy, but there's just something lacking there.

[03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:41.430]
I think it's called personality.

[03:10:42.390 --> 03:10:45.690]
Joe and Mark for Joe Zagaki five will go from the bottom up at Moe and Geldie.

[03:10:45.730 --> 03:10:48.510]
You'll pass them pretty soon to six to ten all four hours, thirteen.

[03:10:48.990 --> 03:10:50.050]
Kimbobo camp or thirteen.

[03:10:50.510 --> 03:10:51.270]
What's that all about?

[03:10:51.910 --> 03:10:53.410]
The big 21.

[03:10:54.350 --> 03:10:54.670]
That's...

[03:10:54.670 --> 03:10:56.870]
We need to get Congress convened real fast.

[03:10:57.090 --> 03:10:59.510]
And at least the legislature here in Florida have an investigation of that.

[03:10:59.630 --> 03:11:03.090]
Does anybody believe that there are 21 people who want the big between eight and ten?

[03:11:03.190 --> 03:11:03.990]
I guarantee I'll leave.

[03:11:04.310 --> 03:11:05.750]
I mean, I like your Orlando.

[03:11:05.750 --> 03:11:07.110]
You're a good guy, but I'll just leave.

[03:11:07.770 --> 03:11:08.750]
No, I won't come back.

[03:11:09.330 --> 03:11:10.830]
In fact, what I will do if they do that.

[03:11:10.990 --> 03:11:14.310]
I know that I'm going to quit because I need the cash, but I'll never come back to mind me.

[03:11:14.390 --> 03:11:15.910]
What I'll do is I'll go take my passport.

[03:11:16.550 --> 03:11:17.490]
I'll rent a car in Toronto.

[03:11:17.490 --> 03:11:19.650]
Drive across the bridge there in Niagara Falls.

[03:11:19.850 --> 03:11:21.370]
And I'll stay like a weekend.

[03:11:21.570 --> 03:11:23.350]
And I'll have to step my passport and then go by.

[03:11:23.390 --> 03:11:24.350]
That's all you really have to do.

[03:11:25.090 --> 03:11:25.950]
You do understand that.

[03:11:26.110 --> 03:11:27.370]
You can step to 180 days straight.

[03:11:27.870 --> 03:11:29.630]
And then you just don't see me no more.

[03:11:29.850 --> 03:11:30.150]
You know what I mean?

[03:11:30.510 --> 03:11:31.030]
That's right.

[03:11:32.650 --> 03:11:34.170]
Kimba 13 to big O21.

[03:11:34.330 --> 03:11:35.490]
I mean, that's just...

[03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.950]
It's insulting.

[03:11:37.590 --> 03:11:41.550]
Mad Dog 47, Joe Rose 53, the forest 73 for a depot.

[03:11:41.770 --> 03:11:42.750]
Now, doesn't that surprise you?

[03:11:43.690 --> 03:11:46.910]
That little sniveling depot here with all of them Indian shenanigans going on.

[03:11:46.910 --> 03:11:48.370]
He's kind of a popular guy.

[03:11:48.370 --> 03:11:49.350]
Could have fooled a hell of a me.

[03:11:49.950 --> 03:11:50.230]
Don't care.

[03:11:50.370 --> 03:11:51.930]
I won't listen to matter what the hell you put on.

[03:11:51.930 --> 03:11:52.910]
We got 80 saying that.

[03:11:53.150 --> 03:11:56.210]
And Ricken saw the 161.

[03:11:56.450 --> 03:11:56.910]
34.1%.

[03:11:57.710 --> 03:11:58.670]
They're Jones and four.

[03:11:58.770 --> 03:11:59.470]
Baby, they want it.

[03:11:59.770 --> 03:12:00.230]
Is it going to happen?

[03:12:00.890 --> 03:12:01.290]
No.

[03:12:01.690 --> 03:12:02.270]
No change.

[03:12:02.570 --> 03:12:04.390]
My life and look all.

[03:12:04.750 --> 03:12:05.910]
This is sports radio 560.

[03:12:07.050 --> 03:12:08.290]
You weigh 2A.

[03:12:18.250 --> 03:12:21.710]
You cut me off.

[03:12:22.390 --> 03:12:23.830]
Life's for sure.

[03:12:24.910 --> 03:12:28.990]
Then you go real slow.

[03:12:29.790 --> 03:12:30.110]
Yes.

[03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:32.370]
The walking light.

[03:12:33.070 --> 03:12:34.710]
You hit my door.

[03:12:36.490 --> 03:12:39.530]
No one but about to go.

[03:12:40.690 --> 03:12:43.450]
I can't handle my old rage.

[03:12:43.450 --> 03:12:52.170]
But I stay out of my face.

[03:12:52.410 --> 03:12:55.790]
Lift you the burden then I drive away.

[03:12:56.090 --> 03:12:56.570]
How right?

[03:12:57.210 --> 03:12:59.450]
You're holding this whole list.

[03:12:59.850 --> 03:13:01.890]
You're someone who gets me pissed.

[03:13:02.170 --> 03:13:03.370]
Your face is next to definition.

[03:13:04.030 --> 03:13:06.610]
Lift you the burden then I drive away.

[03:13:07.650 --> 03:13:09.510]
Cause it's you come out window.

[03:13:10.530 --> 03:13:12.330]
Be that you so that you know.

[03:13:12.330 --> 03:13:14.290]
I'm the one that didn't let you go.

[03:13:14.530 --> 03:13:16.890]
Lift you the burden then I drive away.

[03:13:16.890 --> 03:13:17.330]
Cut up Scott.

[03:13:17.450 --> 03:13:18.630]
Don't start talking about ice cream.

[03:13:18.770 --> 03:13:20.010]
Scott's going on ice cream.

[03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.370]
You're right.

[03:13:20.510 --> 03:13:21.290]
He was a bad influence.

[03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:23.350]
Coffee, coffee, crunch, Ben and juries.

[03:13:23.810 --> 03:13:27.070]
The fish will just kind of pass say at this point after discovering Nestle's turtle.

[03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:28.310]
And then what was the other one?

[03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:29.550]
The briars of score.

[03:13:29.830 --> 03:13:30.190]
Oh.

[03:13:31.490 --> 03:13:31.850]
Oh.

[03:13:32.250 --> 03:13:32.510]
Wow.

[03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:33.850]
Now why can't they make those?

[03:13:34.030 --> 03:13:34.890]
I think there ought to be a law.

[03:13:35.730 --> 03:13:37.850]
For us fat diabetic dying people.

[03:13:37.850 --> 03:13:42.470]
They have to make those like you know the little tiny cups of ice cream like you get like in school when you were a kid.

[03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:43.450]
A table spoon.

[03:13:43.630 --> 03:13:45.050]
Well not about whatever it is.

[03:13:45.190 --> 03:13:47.150]
But you know I'm talking about the little dixie cup kind of thing.

[03:13:47.270 --> 03:13:47.270]

[03:13:47.310 --> 03:13:49.810]
Why can't they make the good stuff in like small containers.

[03:13:49.930 --> 03:13:52.350]
And they're really good stuff like the briars score.

[03:13:53.450 --> 03:13:53.830]
Oh.

[03:13:54.110 --> 03:13:55.530]
With a chumse of score bars in them.

[03:13:56.030 --> 03:13:58.290]
Speaking of they only have only found it like a half gallons.

[03:13:58.650 --> 03:14:01.790]
Speaking of the good stuff Miguel is leaving and he has $200.

[03:14:02.430 --> 03:14:04.410]
And what do you have before 140 or is it a hundred?

[03:14:04.730 --> 03:14:05.570]
140 I think.

[03:14:05.570 --> 03:14:06.590]
So it's like 60 more.

[03:14:06.750 --> 03:14:07.670]
So it's 825.

[03:14:07.970 --> 03:14:08.570]
40,825.

[03:14:09.470 --> 03:14:11.090]
Not a bad day of very productive day here.

[03:14:11.170 --> 03:14:11.650]
Let's hear it for.

[03:14:11.870 --> 03:14:15.910]
Thank you Miguel and thank you Neil for a great job and thank you Hank and thank you Mad Dog and everybody else.

[03:14:16.290 --> 03:14:16.690]
That was good.

[03:14:17.690 --> 03:14:19.410]
400 E-6 vote speaking of good.

[03:14:19.570 --> 03:14:21.930]
That's a health and what would he have to call from Tampa?

[03:14:22.430 --> 03:14:23.350]
What are they budding into this?

[03:14:23.450 --> 03:14:23.830]
Here's Tampa.

[03:14:23.990 --> 03:14:24.230]
Hello.

[03:14:24.730 --> 03:14:25.490]
Hey Uncle Neil.

[03:14:25.650 --> 03:14:26.130]
Yes sir.

[03:14:26.510 --> 03:14:27.770]
Listen to you on the internet.

[03:14:27.990 --> 03:14:28.290]
I'm right.

[03:14:28.530 --> 03:14:32.010]
Watch out for those those pickers over there man in Loots and Temple Terrace.

[03:14:32.530 --> 03:14:33.170]
Hey they're picking.

[03:14:33.490 --> 03:14:33.910]
They're picking.

[03:14:33.910 --> 03:14:34.630]
How about the lightning?

[03:14:34.630 --> 03:14:36.030]
The lightning are good.

[03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:38.370]
All of we kicked their ass the other night but lightning were off to a great start.

[03:14:38.370 --> 03:14:39.230]
They got a good team.

[03:14:39.850 --> 03:14:41.910]
Any chance of you getting on XM?

[03:14:42.370 --> 03:14:42.670]
That light.

[03:14:42.870 --> 03:14:43.030]
No.

[03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:43.750]
I wish.

[03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:45.670]
I should be.

[03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:48.710]
In fact for Ellen I should be on her back to back just to let them all hang out.

[03:14:48.850 --> 03:14:50.950]
No restrictions, no censorship.

[03:14:51.410 --> 03:14:52.230]
Just talking crap.

[03:14:52.450 --> 03:14:52.590]
You know.

[03:14:53.070 --> 03:14:53.570]
When that be great.

[03:14:53.970 --> 03:14:56.670]
I would listen to you but I had a vote for the morning show.

[03:14:56.890 --> 03:14:57.150]
Okay.

[03:14:57.550 --> 03:14:58.490]
How about Bob Rasser?

[03:14:59.550 --> 03:14:59.910]
Oh.

[03:15:01.670 --> 03:15:02.390]
Love you Neil.

[03:15:02.390 --> 03:15:02.510]
No.

[03:15:03.370 --> 03:15:03.710]
No.

[03:15:04.270 --> 03:15:04.610]
No.

[03:15:05.010 --> 03:15:05.690]
See you Pali.

[03:15:06.250 --> 03:15:06.810]
Hey Lassiter.

[03:15:06.990 --> 03:15:07.130]
No.

[03:15:07.290 --> 03:15:08.570]
Yeah I wonder what ever happened to him.

[03:15:08.710 --> 03:15:09.810]
Probably back in the corner hole.

[03:15:09.930 --> 03:15:10.850]
I mean cornfield in Iowa.

[03:15:11.610 --> 03:15:12.810]
Big old depressing Bob.

[03:15:12.910 --> 03:15:13.150]
Blah blah.

[03:15:13.330 --> 03:15:13.670]
Lassiter.

[03:15:14.890 --> 03:15:16.790]
Anyway here's the final total so far.

[03:15:16.930 --> 03:15:18.150]
Chris this will be up till tomorrow morning.

[03:15:18.850 --> 03:15:21.510]
Who would you like to see be placed for L from 8 to 10 to morning?

[03:15:21.650 --> 03:15:22.690]
Scott Farrell got canned.

[03:15:23.230 --> 03:15:25.090]
Yesterday afternoon here at the QAM.

[03:15:25.930 --> 03:15:27.090]
He'll show up somewhere else.

[03:15:27.090 --> 03:15:29.270]
He's already got another gig and Scott won't tell us where but he knows.

[03:15:30.630 --> 03:15:31.330]
489 votes.

[03:15:31.390 --> 03:15:33.770]
See in the deal as he didn't have a contract so he had no non-compete.

[03:15:33.850 --> 03:15:34.730]
So he'll pop up some places.

[03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:36.790]
I just hope he will listen like you know.

[03:15:37.190 --> 03:15:37.690]
Because he won't.

[03:15:37.850 --> 03:15:38.590]
I know he won't.

[03:15:39.610 --> 03:15:39.970]
489.

[03:15:40.770 --> 03:15:42.250]
Ricken says 166.

[03:15:42.250 --> 03:15:43.030]
They love you Ricken.

[03:15:43.130 --> 03:15:45.290]
SUDds and they be having to send you money if they had some but they don't.

[03:15:46.070 --> 03:15:47.310]
34% want Ricken.

[03:15:47.430 --> 03:15:48.010]
SUDds 8 to 10.

[03:15:48.850 --> 03:15:49.370]
Don't care.

[03:15:49.530 --> 03:15:50.450]
I won't listen no matter what.

[03:15:50.670 --> 03:15:51.710]
17% 84.

[03:15:52.450 --> 03:15:54.210]
Jeff the Forest really is shocker here.

[03:15:54.270 --> 03:15:55.030]
They love you DeFo.

[03:15:55.290 --> 03:15:55.890]
They're obsessed.

[03:15:56.850 --> 03:15:57.210]
75.

[03:15:58.170 --> 03:15:58.530]
15%.

[03:15:58.530 --> 03:15:59.530]
Joe Rose 55.

[03:15:59.990 --> 03:16:00.490]
Mad Dog 50.

[03:16:00.970 --> 03:16:01.910]
50 for the Mad Dog.

[03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:02.710]
And then after that.

[03:16:03.390 --> 03:16:03.950]
The Big O.

[03:16:04.110 --> 03:16:04.930]
The Big O.

[03:16:05.290 --> 03:16:05.670]
22.

[03:16:06.010 --> 03:16:07.410]
I'm still you could knock me over with a feather.

[03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:08.390]
See in that.

[03:16:08.970 --> 03:16:09.950]
Kim Bo camper 13.

[03:16:10.270 --> 03:16:12.550]
Moe and Geltie 6 to 10 the whole four hours 13.

[03:16:13.070 --> 03:16:16.450]
Joe and Mark just passed Joe Zagaki like he was hanging it out on a railroad track.

[03:16:17.110 --> 03:16:20.350]
Joe and Mark 6 and Joe Zagaki only 5 out of 489.

[03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:23.730]
What a wicked web we weave.

[03:16:23.990 --> 03:16:25.510]
When we practice to DC.

[03:16:25.710 --> 03:16:26.690]
I have no idea why I sent it.

[03:16:27.390 --> 03:16:28.890]
I just sounded good at the moment.

[03:16:29.750 --> 03:16:33.470]
To make a long story short, the first part of the deal was that the audience hates Moe.

[03:16:33.510 --> 03:16:35.230]
Even more than ever Moe, they can't stand you.

[03:16:35.290 --> 03:16:38.890]
They find you disgusting, unacceptable and obnoxious and a back stabbing foamy too.

[03:16:39.310 --> 03:16:43.410]
A guy comes on the ear and talks about what a great friend he is.

[03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:44.630]
He's known for all these years.

[03:16:45.590 --> 03:16:48.690]
And then he just turns around and revels in the fact that the guy just got blown out of here.

[03:16:49.010 --> 03:16:52.310]
And lets all these other people pile on and call in and rip him an ass.

[03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:54.370]
So it's not only Joe Rose.

[03:16:54.370 --> 03:16:55.870]
It's not only the Humper.

[03:16:56.110 --> 03:16:57.070]
It's not only me.

[03:16:57.510 --> 03:17:00.390]
It's not only the Mad Dog who's lips are zipped because he has to work with the guy.

[03:17:00.730 --> 03:17:03.430]
Everybody in this building Moe, we want to send you a message.

[03:17:03.530 --> 03:17:04.390]
Remember Joey Zagaki?

[03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:05.650]
We want to send you a message.

[03:17:05.650 --> 03:17:07.990]
Ok Moe, we hate you like poison baby.

[03:17:08.110 --> 03:17:08.990]
Bye bye bye!

[03:17:09.710 --> 03:17:10.630]
You're not your show.

[03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:11.410]
I'm five six.

[03:17:11.650 --> 03:17:12.310]
You're in QA.

[03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:13.710]
I'm in Fort Laudano.

[03:17:14.090 --> 03:17:15.870]
Who was your friend before you came here?

[03:17:16.250 --> 03:17:16.350]
Me.

[03:17:16.790 --> 03:17:16.990]
You.

[03:17:17.270 --> 03:17:19.070]
Who has been your biggest promoter since you've been here?

[03:17:19.310 --> 03:17:19.510]
Me.

[03:17:20.070 --> 03:17:20.190]
Right.

[03:17:21.190 --> 03:17:22.110]
You've been here.
