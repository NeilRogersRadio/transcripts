[00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.780]
It's Friday, you bastards!

[00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.560]
This is your attorney general in Prevea Redecency and Sensible Shoes, John Ashcroft.

[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.780]
Legalization of marijuana is on the rise around the world, like England and Canada, but those are just the partners.

[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.320]
We can't let that happen here, and the greatest priest in most arrogant country in the world.

[00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.420]
While legalization of marijuana would cause unemployment to rise by this mantlin of the DEA task force,

[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.660]
it would take food from the mouths of beauty-filed dishes.

[00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.340]
So stick with alcohol. That's fine.

[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.700]
And cover up the naked statues, will you? I have a mother complex, and that bothers me.

[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.120]
And get your feet off my nice clean floor.

[00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.300]
This message paid for by citizens against violent America.

[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.000]
He is a mother-magnum mistake about that.

[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.020]
So, would he like George Jets Raiders, would he like?

[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.080]
What? What about Rich Garcia's feet?

[00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.880]
Anyway, we took this poll yesterday, which kind of surprised me.

[00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.160]
A thousand and twenty-three votes, not two shabby, man.

[00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.600]
Not two shabby, boy. Are we in a good mood today or what? At least I am. You already got your stub.

[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.040]
Yeah, I'm playing with it now.

[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.060]
George, already got his stub.

[00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.620]
Now, what about Carlos? Are they paying you like with a paper checker? Are you like direct deposit?

[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.920]
Paper check! All right, let's hear it!

[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.380]
Two out of three of us getting a paper check today, so we're waiting eagerly to see our close best personal friend, Clarence.

[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.500]
Not that we don't ordinarily like Clarence. He's okay for a guy that can't get laid and has a penis like a butterfly, but nevertheless.

[00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.460]
We're waiting for those paper checks today. We saw a moth stick his head in the door, which is always nice to see him, but you know, he don't give the checks out anymore.

[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.180]
So, as much as we like seeing him, it's he's small potatoes.

[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.560]
Thousand and twenty-three votes on a poor yesterday. Over the years, who's been the worst chronic on Neil's show.

[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.460]
Oh, look at this. Well, let's... I can't see it.

[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.500]
But once I print it out, I don't want to look at it again, because it keeps changing.

[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.060]
The Madi Konga, you know, that's Spic Madi Kong. That guy who calls about 40, 50 times a week.

[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.880]
He, a beat everybody else out, came from behind, 171 votes.

[00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.940]
I'm really shocked and pleased, but shocked that Dennis, the professional Catholic, came in second with 150 votes.

[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.240]
You're right. Their audience is out of use, we'd art. Okay. And that just us.

[00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.020]
And by the way, Dennis, how come he won't speak to anybody who disagrees with you?

[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.240]
Greg from Port Saint-Lucy, now there are many of these votes were phony, but as well deserved.

[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.640]
I think I did the right thing by him, don't you?

[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.600]
Absolutely.

[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.480]
I extended the olive branch, your friendship. I said, if you just want to fax today, your faxes are excellent.

[00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:36.040]
Your call sucks and seeing you makes me want to throw up. But a fax today keeps the angry, angryness away.

[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.700]
How's that go? So yesterday he sent us an excellent fax to start. And he wasn't doing all that well on the pool.

[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.500]
I think he did it on purpose, don't you?

[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.420]
Because he's in denial, but the fact that he moved all the way up to third with 137 votes, I think he's squeezing it right now if he could find it.

[00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.440]
His wife said, you know, she can't find it. He has a wife?

[00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.520]
Yeah, he has a wife.

[00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.940]
You know, he, well, he said in that one fax, he said, Greg, he said, Andy and I are married.

[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.140]
Now I didn't realize it was who it's to each other. We're happily married and we're doing just fine.

[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.180]
Who's the man?

[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.760]
Gilbert?

[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.960]
Well, that's not the answer to your question, because that certainly is not a brother. Do you think Gilbert has a penis?

[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.280]
I really doubt it. Maybe just like a nub.

[00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:30.960]
Anyway, Gilbert has got 130. He's in fourth place. See, the interesting thing about the pool is that the more recent chronics are obviously getting a lot more votes, like the Monikauln, because he never stops.

[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:39.380]
He's always there. And Dennis, who's just covering the universe with a blanket with his professional homophobia and Catholicism.

[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.460]
Greg from Port St. Lucie was like small potatoes until he faxed three times yesterday and moved way up on the list and well deserved three times in one day, Greg.

[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.820]
Get with it. This is absolutely, especially after I played the voice man yesterday and he's still only got 130.

[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.660]
He's going way back to IOD by the way, not that a lot of these other people don't.

[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.080]
And he does? Sure. He was calling Rick and Suds first.

[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.020]
Oh, no.

[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:09.640]
Yeah. We don't want no leftovers from Rick and Suds except that Paul Harvey Jr. 48. He was a late edition, but these small potatoes Andy from Hollywood only had 39.

[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.520]
I'll tell you one thing Andy, you can't even lick Greg's ass.

[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.400]
You're not in the same category. Greg 137 Andy from Hollywood only 39. Talk about small potatoes.

[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.240]
Man, I pretend a wannabe chronic. Whatty 28 now there's a guy voted for what he should have a lot more votes. Yes.

[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.400]
And that talk about going back to IOD. I think he goes all the way back to before I came to town. A staple.

[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.820]
Oh, and then they had packs and that he actually drove up. I was driving out out of that service road there.

[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.420]
What have I done? How long thing is? And income's a car. He stops.

[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.380]
No, no. I rolled on my window. It's whatty.

[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.260]
Now see if that time if I would have been prepared.

[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.960]
The guy with the eyes has got 26 pretty good since Ken. We haven't heard from Ken in a long time.

[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.140]
Since he got that Greg from Portse, Lucy blow up doll.

[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.640]
Mitch from the video store video waves 24 and that goes back five years once we finally got rid of him, which wasn't easy.

[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.240]
He just vanished. Thank the Lord. And he was also part of that whole little circle.

[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:18.740]
See, one thing he needs to know when it comes to these chronics is that they actually had like a little fraternity you could call it.

[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.360]
A little circle trick. And they were like hanging out together. I know if I ever told you.

[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.460]
Please, but Mr. G once upon a time. Yeah.

[00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.920]
Invited me to go to Denny's with him and Gilbert and the guy with the eye. Now who's going to buy?

[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.860]
Gilbert, I guess he's loaded. He is. But I just I was hysterical to me.

[00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.340]
Mitch from video waves 24 blind Michael. He's 17. My, my, my. That's a pretty weak number for a, but we haven't heard from Mike Lanson a long time.

[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.020]
Don't call him blind. Mike by the way, George. It's Mike Lansson.

[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.900]
He doesn't like it. It's sightless. Wasn't a Walter Lansson. He did what he would. What he would picker. Ted.

[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:59.980]
Gil Segal from WK 18. A command was how seven votes. Todd with shoe Steve would seven. And Mr. G in last place would six. How appropriate is that?

[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:10.680]
He's going to be real upset about that up in Wisconsin. Is he up in Wisconsin? But I'm sure he's listening on the internet right now, Mr. G in between having a rip snorting good time. Yeah. He's got a cold.

[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.580]
He's got a little cool. Kind of like, Hans got a cold. Boy, that thing. Did you hear any of that yesterday from the Bahamas?

[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:23.080]
Now I get in my car to go to the pizza loft to meet Rimmer. And let me tell you again, you're not getting that free lunch from Rimmer because what a cost him to buy that new house.

[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:31.500]
He can't afford to buy you lunch. Seriously, you ought to see that house. And guess who lives in the same complex? Chris Chambers lives in there.

[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:41.920]
Eddie Jones from the dolphins lives. We are as we were driving out toward the pizza loft. He's giving me the. Oh, this one lives over here. And that's why that's why they got that big expensive house because important people live in there.

[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:50.840]
Not that they need that for people who can do in the old people only day 75,000 square foot house, but because all these other important people live in there, that's why he's there.

[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:56.120]
I reminded him that his neighbor in Coral Springs used to be Mischurch. So what does that tell you?

[00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:03.860]
So don't assume that your life is going to get a lot better because you got important neighbors, Rimmer. Okay. He could do starts wars in the old season. What do you mean could?

[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.660]
That was the first one yesterday. Was I impressed? No. Nice house though. Good luck to you, Rimmer. You'll need it.

[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:18.440]
Here's our pool today. Who is the luckiest person on the face of the earth? Most success, least talent. I like this pool.

[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:27.920]
Oh, and wait until you hear this thing that I found thanks to CNN of all people. CNN is usually pretty dry, right? Where the hell is it? If I can find it, where the hell is it?

[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:36.300]
Like I said, wait until you hear it. It might not be today. I'll find it here somewhere. Say a website called am I aggravating am I something?

[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:43.760]
I can't find it. Like I said, you'll hear it one of these days on a show. Well, I have so much crap here. You know, that's the way it is.

[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:54.480]
I sure I'm sure I must have it here somewhere. Don't I Carlos? So think it's all the website. No, I got it here. So here it is. The website is am I annoying.com? Am I annoying?

[00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:06.800]
But I'm not I'm small potatoes. And it's a web server. They have they specialize in people bitching about annoying people, which is not the same as our other pool today, but I just mentioned this in passing.

[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:16.860]
Oh, by the way, you'll also be pleased to know that we have a great show today because there are no spots. The whole station is void of spots today, which is probably why the sales department is in that seminar in Hollywood, where the railions were.

[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:26.640]
I think it's appropriate also that the railions were in that building first and our sales department is there, especially PD Lenny. And didn't I say to you this morning before you told me about the seminar?

[00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:33.920]
Did I say that PD Lenny is definitely a railion that he's out of this world? Yes, you did. He is definitely not of this planet. There is no question about that.

[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:46.320]
Old leather poise. Is it the sun? Is that what makes people like that? How can he not have skin cancer then? Maybe he does. No, seriously, how can you how can you have like leather skin?

[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:59.120]
Whether it's from the heat from the sun and the heat and the all of the other all these things and not to still be alive. I don't understand it. It works for Ron Diaz, the cigar store Indian. He was an Indian. That was natural.

[00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:10.840]
Don't be picking on them and be like putting a hand of grenade in your mouth and pulling the pins. I've never seen a man. Most and least annoying of 2002. Let me just give you a clue. Now a lot of these people when we get to this eventually, since we have no spots, we got a lot of time to do stuff.

[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:21.100]
We'll take a caller to here in there if we ever get any. See, I have a whole new attitude about that. I'm doing what I want to do and I'll have some stuff mostly, you know, our own, our stuff.

[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:34.500]
And then if we get some calls fine, if not, who cares? You know, because they suck anyway. It's part of my delusional thing. It has to do with my being here again. I come back here and I think, hey, something has changed. Nothing has changed.

[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:41.780]
The people here for the last 27 years never had anything to say. Have they got anything to say now? No, of course not. I've got to have anything to say about anything.

[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:50.320]
Other than JET, JET, but I'm glad to hear that Mo and Geldie both like Rich Garcia's feed. I'm very excited about that.

[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:59.940]
Because those people with the food fetish watch out for them. So guess who's number one on the most annoying list on this website? Mironoing.com. Martha Stewart.

[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:07.620]
And that's how I'm promising. Oh, yeah, at least annoying. They also have the hundred least annoying. And I have no idea who she is.

[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:15.800]
Misha or if it's even a she, I'm sure it is. Misha Barton. Who? Who is that? Now I could go back to the website and find out, but I'm not going to do that.

[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:22.820]
In fact, I don't know who any of these, you will. Here's our poll today. Let's get right to it, baby. Let's not waste any time.

[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:32.600]
Who's the luckiest person on the face of the earth? Most success. Least talent. Here's the list. Oprah. Larry King.

[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:46.480]
Tommy 50. Bill Gates. I know who you're voting for. Regis Filben. Jerry Springer. George W. Bush. Slice the loan. Merv Griffin. Tom Broca.

[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:54.380]
Barbara Walters. Madonna. M&M. Bruce Springsteen. I think that's a sense. And those are all mine.

[00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:02.820]
Tom Bilti was your choice. Although that Barbara Walters and Oprah are contenders. Yeah. I thought you vote for Bill Gates. That was your choice.

[00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:14.120]
Yeah, until you got to Barbara Walter. Oh, and what about what about Merv Griffin? He doesn't have a speech defect. But do you have any idea how much money he's doing? He's a multi-billionaire. I understand that.

[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:26.060]
I mean, he did. He did concoct some of those quiz shows. Indeed. Like that. Jeopardy is a matter of fact. Jeopardy. Squeal a fortune. Right. So at least he had some ideas and he doesn't have a speech defect.

[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:43.360]
Okay. So in other words, you're not going to be voting for Merv Griffin. No. Well, we'll see how the audience does with that. I think it's a magnificent poll. Oh, we got a call coming in. WQ I am. Are you crazy? It's you. F nerd. Is got no talent. He can't. What are you talking about? He was the first innovator with that kind of a skin magazine.

[00:11:43.360 --> 00:12:12.240]
He was a genius. Well, I don't know about his talent. He may have had good business men that. And I guarantee you got legal. I was successful. Thank you. I heard you can't get laid at all. Much less a lot. Just giving my check. Nice going. In fact, I know something. I think we ought to get current slave this weekend. Call up a hooker or something. Get your connections and treasure around because friends just handed me my check. What about Carlos's check? Look at he sitting there like this with his hands out like a little puppy. Look at that. Come on. Let's get Carlos a couple of bucks. What do you say?

[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:42.220]
He said you're not getting paid this week. The company can't afford it. They brought me my checkers. I'm important. But he said you're really small potatoes. That's what he said. And I think he had an excellent point. Did that guy say Hugh Hefner? I mean, if there are legitimate suggestions that I left off of there, but I thought as usual, I put together a damn neat poll. I'll be talented. But he was a freaking genius to come up with a concept that the sea that's talent. Just because he doesn't play the piano or the skin flute or something like that.

[00:12:45.060 --> 00:13:12.200]
I mean, that's how Goldstein. But anyway, in fact, maybe he should have been on the list. No, he was an innovator. He had some big ball before he came totally blacked out. Anyway, I think it's a good list. If you got some additions, that's fine. We'll consider them. Eric would be delighted to put them on there because he's got nothing but time these days. He's got all the time in the world up there. What would you laugh at about? He's got plenty of time on his hands. Listen, if he was talking about reconfiguring whatever he was talking about, then he's got time to do.

[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:42.180]
He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this. He's got a little

[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:11.640]
bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do the little bit of time to do this. He's got a little bit of time to do this The Hustle.

[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.320]
sure but see we could put the queen on there too they're

[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:19.880]
Pikers because they're bored into it no they're not Pikers well princess

[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:23.000]
Diamond she had all that money and everything yeah well how about the

[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.640]
Queen you don't think she's got a couple of bucks yeah do you think that when

[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.580]
she went to meet the now see she did go remember it was the last year of the

[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.700]
year before she was like trying to reach out to the people this is like after

[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.020]
the first scandals were blown out and she was making the tour and she went into

[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.880]
McDonald's but the one thing they made sure we found out was that she did not

[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.160]
eat there which is probably why she's still alive probably why she's still

[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.920]
alive the bitchy old queen they should probably go to burger king I thought the

[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.980]
best part of kitty Kelly's book the roles with the fact that Prince Philip

[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.120]
couldn't get her ass out of his beds because they have separate rooms you do

[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.820]
understand but she kept showing up at his bed because she like getting late she

[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.040]
liked that wicked worm man the queen now somehow and the queen mum oh can you

[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.860]
imagine anybody oh please don't she's dead she's dead she's safe in fact maybe

[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.700]
maybe we can this weekend we can pick clearance up with the queen mum huh I

[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:15.020]
wasn't gonna do and Bishop but somebody have scotted I think Sandy took off

[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:20.800]
with their body she was afraid the Dwight would keep looking at nasty crack but

[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:25.340]
at any rate yeah maybe we can get clearance because you got to start out slow

[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.140]
yeah the concept that we're gonna get him laid with somebody alive I think is

[00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:33.900]
getting a little bit carried away don't you but like somebody who can't run away

[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.660]
huh he could come down to the next treasurer island appearance I'll make some

[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:43.120]
introductions yeah no introductions isn't gonna get the job done just do your

[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.120]
usual thing and bring a lot of drugs and booze and get somebody really get

[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.240]
get her plastered out of her skull and then maybe maybe there might be a chance

[00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.540]
if he doesn't bite her I understand that why is he why can't he get laid he's

[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.460]
not he's not the worst looking guy I've ever seen he's not a good looking guy

[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.100]
that's for damn sure but he's not the worst looking guy in his building bad luck

[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.740]

[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.140]
true story and the rumor was that she was a knockout that she was really hot

[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:24.280]
right and he was like like the right neuron elbow or something I don't know well

[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.700]
maybe he thought it was something else you know he hasn't had a lot of

[00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:33.200]
experience so maybe he thought that that was the spot the good spot as in the

[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.000]
G spot well we'll get him straight now thanks again for the check clearance

[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.700]

[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.840]
as the frogs fart.

[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.100]
I was going to say clearance, but I don't want to pick on them since I got my check.

[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.820]
Poor clearance. What are we going to do about that? See, actually Carlos was going to get paid today,

[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.080]
but then they looked at the program log today here at Beasley.

[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.220]
And he said, well, anybody that we can kind of like hold back on, probably a good idea.

[00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.200]
They know they can't hold back on my check because they've diddled with my money for too long.

[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.820]
Too many different times. This probably wouldn't be a good week to do it.

[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:03.500]
So they didn't do it.

[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.180]
But in Carlos's case, what's he going to say?

[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.860]
I'm walking out. Oh, okay. Well, see you.

[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.200]
Have a nice life. Thanks for all your magnificent efforts. That's what they would say.

[00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:19.660]
5, 6, 7, 05, 60, 05, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Line.

[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.800]
I must have done a really good job on that because when the first call that I punched up said,

[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.740]
you have no. I mean, that wasn't even close.

[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.040]
That wasn't even in the same category.

[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.960]
This is a guy who invented one of the most successful magazines and concepts.

[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.280]
Not just a magazine. Look at all the imitators.

[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.980]
You got hustler and pen house and 8 million other ones.

[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.800]
But Playboy was the first and also the combining not just the pictures, the nudity,

[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:45.440]
but also the articles and the intellectual stuff that's appeared in there over the years.

[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.820]
That was a genius to do that.

[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:47.740]
The facade of credibility.

[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:51.220]
Right. That's right. That was a freaking genius. Who did that?

[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.380]
I think. Here's Hollywood. Hello.

[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.240]
I'm on hold. It's ripping me.

[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:04.260]
Hello.

[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.640]
We're ripping who? Which asshole is this?

[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:12.700]
Hello?

[00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:14.340]
Which asshole are we talking to?

[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.740]
How are you?

[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.200]
Who is it?

[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.060]
Andy?

[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.800]
Oh, Andy. It's Andy. I'm a whole.

[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.080]
So like I said, they're all sitting there having a little circle jerk.

[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.120]
I don't even want to tell you who just called online.

[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.900]
Nine, obviously, from out of town.

[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.180]
Let me guess. Mr. G.

[00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:28.960]
No. Better than that.

[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.080]
He was very disheartened that he wasn't on the pole.

[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.580]
Oh, he wasn't on the pole and he called from out of town.

[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.540]
Let's see. How many guesses do I get?

[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.240]
Give me a clue.

[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.080]
The abullion guy.

[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.400]
Oh, no.

[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.480]
The abullion guy are only long distance.

[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:48.020]
At least Mr. G used to live here.

[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.800]
But the abullion guy who lives in New York.

[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:52.240]
See, I want to tell you very seriously.

[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.540]
Now, whether you like New York or you hate it, the fact of the matter is it's a very vibrant,

[00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.740]
exciting place. There's lots of stuff going on.

[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.280]
Just you can go out on like 42nd Street and buy a slice of pizza.

[00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.360]
You know, I mean, if Rudy Giuliani didn't get rid of that before he left office,

[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.840]
he'd ban just about all that street-vending stuff, which was another reason he was a real prick.

[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:16.600]
But the guy's coming in New York and his whole life revolves around listening to this show

[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:21.760]
and faxing this show and calling this show with his rather ebillion, ebillion, the comments.

[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:23.400]
He's an asshole, this guy.

[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:29.380]
He may be the worst of them all when you come right down to it.

[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:30.740]
Crotic or stalker.

[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.340]
No, no, no. Just the worst asshole of them all.

[00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.280]
And then he's also got this other guy who must be his agent who was sending us the affections about,

[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:43.480]
oh, well, this guy moved down here and left his wife so we could come down here and meet you with the hockey game.

[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.280]
Oh, my God.

[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.880]
This must be the guy that had his kick kick in the back of my seat at the game the other night,

[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:49.760]
trying to get my attention.

[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.980]
Because that little kid was pretty ebillioned.

[00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:57.720]
I'd like to make him a little bit less ebillion, like with a 2x4 would be good.

[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:02.860]
But I'm not going to get started on that again because the room around town was that there's some heads rolling at the macaroon

[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:07.240]
and I'm after my tie-rate yesterday. I see it when I believe it and I'll believe it when I see it.

[00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.340]
Not too sure about that. Look at that. George W is moving into first place.

[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.860]
Oh, right. 26 votes for W.

[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.780]
Hey, listen, he wants to hold that baseball team and the Texas Rangers.

[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.780]
And Oprah's got not just hands again, 29 for W and 24 for Oprah.

[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.620]
Everybody else is sucking wind, man. Everybody else is way back in a pack.

[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.600]
Look at that. Larry King has got six Bill Gates and Eminem are tied with four.

[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.220]
Jerry Springer, three Madonna, a pair, sliced alone, two.

[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.320]
Regis Filman, a pair.

[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.960]
Everybody's got at least one vote except Tom Broke on now.

[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.600]
Tom Broke on.

[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.880]
Barbara Alder has won. That's just probably to pass if I your asked.

[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.980]
Thank you. Somebody voted for Barbara.

[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:52.980]
But Tom Broke, who also I think has a much worse speech defect than Barbara Walters has none.

[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.080]
See, at least she's not doing the timely news.

[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.660]
I mean, I know she's doing all those interviews.

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:01.720]
That does make a difference, but the fact is there doesn't have to be any credibility associated with that.

[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.780]
It's a positive guy who's like on one of the three major networks pretending to be a news anchor.

[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:09.600]
All of these are always replacing people like Chad Huntly, David Brickley and John Chancellor.

[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:10.680]
And here comes on.

[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.140]
Mark, who can't speak at all.

[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:16.560]
And he's a news anchor and only in a country like America with people say, oh yeah, I like NBC news.

[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.160]
I'm Mark.

[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.560]
And they've also got Brian Williams waiting in the wings to replace him who's 50,000 times the news casted on Mark.

[00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:23.200]
I will ever be.

[00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.480]
And yet America is just creatures of habit.

[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.460]
You know, it's like the comfort zone.

[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.420]
He's there every evening, you know, once in a great while when he's working.

[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.460]
And there he is. Oh, yeah, Tom Mark.

[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:34.960]
Maybe his lips is paralyzed.

[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:35.980]
I know the poll.

[00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:38.620]
He cannot speak.

[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.920]
I'm not exaggerating. It's not my imagination.

[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:43.780]
He cannot speak and he's anchoring the freaking news.

[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.200]
What does that tell you about America?

[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.540]
We got a few problems over here, especially since Ontario court strikes down law and medical parts.

[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:52.200]
Oh, yeah.

[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:57.960]
Which I have right here part of Canada's marijuana law has been blown away.

[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:03.360]
Superior court justice, Sydney Letterman says it's unfair to allow people to smoke medicinal marijuana

[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.540]
and then force them to buy it from a drug dealer.

[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.960]
The Ontario judge declared the rules for medical use of marijuana as unconstitutional.

[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.660]
In a 40-page ruling released yesterday, he gave Ottawa six months to fix the regulations,

[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:19.180]
which are supposed to give eligible people an exemption from the law that makes marijuana illegal.

[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:21.520]
How do you like that?

[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.860]
It says the ruling is the latest blow to marijuana laws in Canada.

[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.800]
Earlier this month, the judge throughout possession charges against the Windsor Ontario team,

[00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:32.100]
16-year-old kid, on a technicality arising from the regulations.

[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.300]
Lawyer and longtime cannabis crusader Alan Young says the latest ruling is another clear sign

[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:41.660]
that the law's prohibiting possession of small amounts of marijuana are crumbling in Canada, A.

[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.740]
It's another nail in the coffin and this is a big nail, he said,

[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.920]
and he laid it young said after learning of the ruling.

[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:49.480]
We feel it will be appealed, but it's the light at the end of the tunnel.

[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.800]
I can't really see the law maintaining any operation after this year.

[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.180]
It's sitting on a really precarious foundation.

[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.700]
How do you like that, huh?

[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.940]
Canada, right there, our neighbor to the north that everybody's always making fun of.

[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.980]
Because they're curling in all this other bull crab.

[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:11.740]
And here they're like socially a hundred years ahead of us and moving rapidly into the real, like a real place.

[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.300]
While we continue being stifled and moving backward with this right wing bunch of fascists that we got up there in Washington now,

[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.280]
from George W. and John Ascroff and this whole bunch of very little Nazis.

[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.500]
Sad, very, very sad.

[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.440]
And let me say it again, I don't want to get too political here because we don't want to piss off the right wingers.

[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.300]
Do we hear them?

[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:36.420]
The fact of the matter is that unless you're a multi-millionaire, just as you saw what his latest tax cut proposal is,

[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.100]
unless you're a multi-multi-millionaire, or you're a born-again, fanatical right wing, a Bible thumping abortion,

[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:50.140]
hating a fetus-squeezing Christian, or both of the above, there is no reason in the world why you should be on the side of this crap.

[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:51.600]
None.

[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.160]
Zero.

[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:52.620]
Zipity.

[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.420]
It's inconceivable that anybody with a brain-christ, there's the problem.

[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:04.400]
Unless you're one of those aliens, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, here's a call from a four-letter deal. Hello?

[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:05.500]
Hey, Neil.

[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.060]
Yes, sir.

[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.120]
Hey, oh, who found him?

[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:09.540]
Whatever. What happened to both?

[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:12.300]
Did Ken Block get in his buddy that up?

[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.000]
Ken Block wasn't on the pool.

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:15.300]
Why?

[00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:17.460]
Because nobody knows who that is anymore.

[00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.600]
He's been gone that long.

[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.140]
Oh, yeah.

[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:21.800]
What about that?

[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.640]
Who was that on the guy's dad?

[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.340]
In addition to what's that, that's yesterday's pool, okay?

[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.100]
Get with it.

[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:29.520]
What's this guy hucking me about yesterday's pool?

[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:30.680]
We got a new pool up here.

[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.980]
And this guy, did you know that President Lincoln got shot?

[00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:34.260]
He did?

[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:35.580]
Oh, my God.

[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:36.640]
Right in the head.

[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:38.500]
What is that?

[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.380]
Plus that guy had a crappy, sounding phone.

[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.760]
I don't want to start, you know, especially after the last three days,

[00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:45.700]
asking for like perfect phone calls, but that was bad.

[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.900]
The quality technically was horrendous, and the material was grotesque.

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.480]
And by the way, muff stop eating those damn brownies you lunatic.

[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:53.140]
Uh oh.

[00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.200]
Right outside the door.

[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.500]
I guess he wants to hang around a building all day.

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:01.380]
He will not be going, don't be going out to launch either if you're smart.

[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:04.960]
I guarantee you.

[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.560]
In fact, what you should do is get one of those from him and look on the label

[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:11.340]
and see whether I already did the second ingredient, multitall.

[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:11.980]
Mmm.

[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:12.700]
Fuck.

[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:16.860]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:17.140]
Hello.

[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:18.440]
Hello?

[00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.020]
Yes, sir.

[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:21.480]
Hey, how about you, that full of Patrick here?

[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:24.660]
How about Dennis Miller, Wayne Heizinger, and Rick Sanchez?

[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:25.200]
No.

[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.800]
Ferrell granted bond while appealing DUI.

[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.860]
I mean, Wayne, he's talking about talent.

[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.060]
He kidnapped me, a master manipulator.

[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.720]
I mean, a guy was in a garbage business.

[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.340]
He was smart.

[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.000]
He was in a garbage business.

[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.160]
Started with a truck.

[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.100]
Started with one little garbage truck.

[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.100]
And then, of course, he was in that music video business, blockbuster.

[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:53.440]
Who's going to build us that blockbuster park, big stadium, do all of these things?

[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.040]
And all he did was keep screwing a public over, screwing them over.

[00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:00.100]
You got to give somebody credit for that, whether you like them or not, which we don't.

[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:01.200]
Give him credit for that.

[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.500]
That's a talent, making millions while screwing others over.

[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.220]
In fact, maybe that's one reason that disqualifies his own president

[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:10.020]
even though he's pulling away like crazy now.

[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.620]
37 to 26 from Oprah.

[00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:13.400]
Every now and then, that is based on his own ability.

[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.540]
He's just going along.

[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.640]
I heard if he had the ability, he'd be like Alex Bennett.

[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:24.240]
The former FBI agent, this makes me sick even though most of you don't seem to give a crap.

[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.220]
The former FBI agent convicted of drunken reckless driving in a wrong way crashed.

[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.460]
The killed two brothers is not a danger to the community or likely to flee to avoid serving his jail time in Judge Roliers today.

[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:38.420]
Robert County Circuit Judge Mark Gold ordered David Ferrell released on $10,000 bond

[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:42.300]
while he appeals his misdemeanor convictions for drunken driving and reckless driving.

[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.560]
I have before me a man facing a misdemeanor charge and that's all I can consider Gold said,

[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.520]
I can't treat him different than anybody else.

[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.780]
Gold sentenced Ferrell yesterday to 90 days in jail for the reckless driving

[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:56.960]
with a sentence to be served concurrently with a 90-day drunk driving sentence imposed on Wednesday.

[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:04.520]
First time offenders convicted of those charges rarely serve any jail time prompting Ferrell's attorney to term the 90 days sentence vindictive.

[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.060]
Now see this is what I call Hutzpah.

[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.140]
If you were him or his attorney wouldn't you be kissing the ground at this point that he only got the 90 days say,

[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.820]
okay when do I start let's get it over with.

[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.780]
When do I start that's only 45 days per dead guy that he killed?

[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.100]
A bargain.

[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:21.860]
Yeah.

[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.900]
And twice the price.

[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.360]
He's not even going to have to go to Oz.

[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:30.760]
It's funny I should go into this after I mentioned Rick Sanchez's name, you know.

[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:36.380]
Anyway, well he you know he just had to go home and get a few things together and come back to the stadium.

[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:41.160]
Well if you get upset from hitting a guy don't you need a little drink to calm your nerves.

[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.560]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T of Ryzen Line.

[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.580]
Here's Miami hello.

[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:50.060]
Hello, Nail.

[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:50.540]
Yes sir.

[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:51.320]
Good morning.

[00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:51.920]
Wait a minute.

[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.500]
Don't have a computer like to give a bone float.

[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.320]
Okay.

[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:57.560]
I'm going for Jennifer Lopez.

[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.220]
Yeah, but he's got a great ass.

[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.840]
Well, have ass will travel I guess.

[00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:04.780]
Thanks Nail.

[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:05.820]
Thank you so much.

[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:06.920]
JLo he said.

[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:09.460]
I mean, you know, he's got a good point.

[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.760]
He sure gets a lot of notoriety.

[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:11.920]
She know the tabloids.

[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.060]
They got her ass on every goddamn street corner.

[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.560]
And then there's that video with Ben Affleck.

[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.320]
Anybody believe in that?

[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:18.500]
No.

[00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:19.800]
Well, that wedding's already postponed.

[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.980]
Matt Damon got very jealous.

[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:23.460]
He came between them.

[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.900]
He came between them.

[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.140]
Squared Squared is what we heard.

[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:30.600]
So anyway, the deal is we're not putting her on there.

[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:31.220]
I don't know.

[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.400]
Although if we can put Madonna on there, what do you think?

[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:34.860]
No.

[00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:37.320]
He gave me the wrinkled nose look.

[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:38.960]
He said forget about it.

[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.860]
I mean, I think just because she's got the big ass, I mean, that isn't a talent, but it's an attribute.

[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:44.800]
It's a trait.

[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:45.320]
Right.

[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.640]
It's like, how about Anna Nicole Smith?

[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:50.680]
What?

[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.360]
You don't think she belongs on that list?

[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:54.780]
Yeah.

[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.220]
She does.

[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.940]
She's got a wrong guy named TV show.

[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.120]
I don't know.

[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:57.560]
Stay tuned.

[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:58.660]
Let's put her on there, Eric.

[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.580]
Anna Nicole Smith.

[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.200]
I think she definitely belongs on there.

[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:06.740]
I mean, she's also got a big ass, but unlike JLo, she's just, uh, anxious and obnoxious

[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:07.800]
and despised by most.

[00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:08.920]
Anybody with a brain.

[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.040]
She is a real piece of turd.

[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.440]
Although her money didn't come so much from the TV show and all the other way.

[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:18.260]
It came from that old man that she, uh, off.

[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.460]
I mean, I'm Mary J Howard.

[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:19.980]
Right.

[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.260]
J Howard, uh, Marshall.

Oh, oh, oh, over and over again, so I would not be used for more夠, now, and I would not be ashamed

[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:20.560]
about a ginger and bogey union just bold and then stroking away

[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.060]
boy baby, can we you're not my type?

[00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.140]
you sound like a nine year old kid

[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.080]
only a macho melancholy guy

[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.220]
you don't know it

[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:36.920]
that makes me lift my wig

[00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:40.840]
if ginger was a lover of mine

[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:45.040]
I'd bury my oldest baby nose

[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:48.740]
inside his imply rear end

[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:49.360]
it's better

[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.000]
no I would not be a sport home

[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.440]
if I was not a closet of faith

[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.440]
that's why a ginger and bogey union

[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.540]
would make me feel dizzy and gay

[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.160]
everybody follow my thousand walls

[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.240]
yeah ginger and bogey union

[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.980]
would make my sorrows only a skill safe

[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:19.140]
if we had a ginger and bogey union

[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.600]
then he wouldn't have to get me raped

[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:25.660]
it's 9.44.560 WQM we got the man dog at one

[00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:27.660]
Hank Goldberg from the Bahamas again

[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.660]
I'm sure hope Hank's cold is a better day

[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.060]
and the phone line is better too

[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.340]
I started telling him before and I got interrupted

[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.480]
by my paycheck or something

[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.460]
thanks again clearance

[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.280]
it didn't even sound like him yesterday

[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:39.000]
I turned on the radio on the way to Flores

[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.400]
I mean to Pizza Lock

[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.960]
and well they're coming back on the ear with us

[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.060]
we got to get a plug in there somewhere

[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:46.880]
got only nose when the damn spot start PD

[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.720]
last night he can't hear me they're in that seminar

[00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.840]
when you think that when you look at the log today

[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.880]
that they should be spending a day

[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.580]
a whole day on a seminar

[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.560]
as opposed to be out selling

[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.740]
getting some anyway

[00:39:56.580 --> 00:39:58.340]
so it didn't sound like him did you think

[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.620]
I had listened for a couple of minutes

[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:01.600]
to make sure it was a hopper

[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:03.660]
because it between the cold and the bad phone line

[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.860]
anyway here's a fact that says

[00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:08.560]
see the writing

[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:09.820]
so you know where it was from

[00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.640]
the Wingman Paul

[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.000]
who's very upset that he wasn't on the chronic list

[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.560]
see the thing was chronic

[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.440]
not pusses

[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:18.280]
chronic you're just a puss the Wingman Paul

[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.260]
you're just like a pimple on the side of the universe

[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.660]
not even the same category with these other fine people

[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.400]
bad news

[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.200]
bad news for you

[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:29.060]
Wil McDonough that speaking of pimply faces

[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.140]
you know you guys don't know who that is

[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.960]
you've seen him on TV

[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.600]
George hasn't because he doesn't watch any sports

[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.220]
really really

[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.160]
he write his complexion

[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.160]
Boston sports writer for years and years

[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.600]
for for a long time

[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.200]
he used to be on all the time

[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.680]
I'm like the pregame shows and stuff like that

[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:46.580]
Wil McDonough died in Boston last night

[00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:47.400]
he was 67

[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.060]
he died?

[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:48.580]
yeah

[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:51.380]
off a lot of that going on lately you know what

[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:53.140]
off a lot of people dying

[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.020]
here's a fact that says

[00:40:58.980 --> 00:41:00.900]
Hank interviewed a guy of 345

[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:02.220]
yesterday named Harold Rose

[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:03.280]
oh that's a horse trainer

[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.160]
I think

[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.940]
is that Harold Rose the horse trainer

[00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:08.760]
who's about 400 years old from a call

[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.740]
to Gulfstream whatever

[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:12.760]
a dead ringer for an old Jewish guy named Isaac it says

[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.280]
please listen to the tape any minute I was waiting

[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.920]
from to say step away from my car you big MF

[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:20.880]
Harold Rose I'm pretty sure that's who that is

[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:23.620]
but I could be wrong what's all the wine on

[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.360]
not too much about the thoroughbreds

[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.280]
although it will not before you know it will be

[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:30.660]
time for the triple crown again

[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:33.520]
and our good close personal friend Dave Johnson be calling in again

[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.240]
our Jewish friend Dave here is Jennifer in Miramar

[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.900]

[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.340]
moment said trying to get your ass can he should have

[00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.420]
thank you for covering up his obnoxious stupidity

[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.860]
his knee one of yours and George says I didn't know a

[00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:53.500]
day was Jewish that was cute

[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:57.660]
Jennifer says unfortunately in this country we let clearly

[00:41:57.660 --> 00:42:00.400]
guilty FBI agents get off scoffery while poor old

[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.640]
men from Tamarack who punched an elderly man for telling his wife to

[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.900]
shut up is being charged with first degree man slaughter

[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.980]
after the elderly man fell and hit his head he later died

[00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.960]
I guess from head injuries his bail is ten thousand dollars

[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.180]
where's the fairness in our justice system well that's right Jennifer you

[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.240]
right there he can't complain about the fairness in the

[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.980]
American justice system because there isn't any

[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.940]

years conservative groups in president bush and support

[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:39.460]
base have declared war on condoms in a campaign that is

[00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.080]
downright weird but that if successful could lead to

[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:44.120]
millions of death from AIDS around the world

[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:48.380]

[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.300]
us

[00:53:06.300 --> 00:53:09.740]
hard to tell which one is for insane

[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:11.160]
when it was the

[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.020]
sardis who attacked

[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.060]
w asked to finish that

[00:53:18.060 --> 00:53:19.080]
i'd like

[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:20.280]
that is

[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.500]
who's in his

[00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:22.380]
patience

[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.720]
order the troops to go give up their lives

[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.160]
for the world's biggest castation

[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:32.740]
uh...

[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.180]
white

[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:33.400]
guy

[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.360]
forehand

[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.340]
you

[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.700]
which

[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:55.640]
Five white-collared cries, except for your buddies and mom.

[00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:03.800]
Fight line advice from Kanda Lisa Rice, because she works for Chibron.

[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.620]
That word would read you in that decaying.

[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:16.100]
Think more for a fight line as a good star, but theaters from all around the world agree.

[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.460]
You're a functioning retard.

[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.740]
The fight line at all costs white triad.

[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:29.540]
The life that we'll be lost can't buy it.

[00:54:29.900 --> 00:54:32.740]
There's more important things to do.

[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.840]
What the hell is wrong with you?

[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.980]
Double you. Double you wants to invade you day.

[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.160]
That's the decision is rich.

[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.440]
Double you just has it same as you say.

[00:54:50.600 --> 00:54:53.120]
Oh somebody in each.

[00:54:59.000 --> 00:54:59.880]
Oh right.

[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.940]
10-0-2-5-60-WQM.

[00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:03.740]
Welcome back to highly rated Neo-Rodger show.

[00:55:03.820 --> 00:55:04.480]
At least it used to be.

[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.380]
Now, a week from today, I got the paycheck today.

[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:08.340]
That's good. So the tenths turned out well.

[00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.500]
Regardless of anything else that happens.

[00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.760]
You still living at your check?

[00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:15.760]
Carlos is sitting there and he don't know what to do.

[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:16.040]
I don't know what to do.

[00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:17.600]
Why don't you spend it now anyway?

[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:18.660]
You'll get it maybe.

[00:55:19.740 --> 00:55:20.980]
And if not, we don't really care anyway.

[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.940]
But now a week from today is the book is coming out.

[00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.720]
The fall rating book.

[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.640]
Now this, I've been saying this for a while,

[00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:33.660]
but I really think this is going to be the definitive thing.

[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.100]
Do you know what I mean?

[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.200]
No, what do you mean?

[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:37.680]
I don't know.

[00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.620]
I just, I don't know. I just think it's going to be,

[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:41.600]
tell us something.

[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.160]
It will tell us something.

[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.520]
Of course it always tells us something.

[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.020]
So it's not exactly going out on the limb.

[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.660]
Oh, I guess what Al Goldstein got kicked off that flight.

[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.940]
When you people stopped faxing us this stupid story

[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.000]
it was in yesterday's paper.

[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:53.960]
I do read the papers.

[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:56.040]
We talked about it briefly here on the year as much.

[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.940]
Publicity as fat-al is going to get from us.

[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:58.640]
And that's it.

[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:01.000]
Coming this morning, there's a copy of the story

[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.040]
in the mailbox out there.

[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.020]
We know all about fat-al Goldstein.

[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:05.940]
Now, you have to have to play because he's got a big fact

[00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:06.700]
in his heart that's like a disgusting mouth

[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:07.940]
and nobody likes him, okay?

[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:08.720]
And what?

[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.900]
It's his birthday today.

[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:14.280]
Do you see what I mean about him?

[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:16.660]
We don't care.

[00:56:17.260 --> 00:56:18.260]
He's in New York anyway.

[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:20.080]
We don't care even if he wasn't in New York

[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:22.140]
if he was in Palpatau sitting on that big finger

[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.640]
that he's got to stick up and inter-coastle.

[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.640]
We still wouldn't care.

[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.800]
We were talking about him at the Pizza lot last night at length.

[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:30.460]
You know he was there a week ago?

[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:30.980]
No.

[00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:34.760]
Ponytale luckily wasn't there but he was in there a week ago.

[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:39.260]
with his gigantic size 92 shorts and his flag jacket.

[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:44.560]
Your friend, here's some really terrible news.

[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:46.120]
Jewelieberman to run from president.

[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.100]
Senator Joe Lieber, a Jewelieberman Democratic Connecticut,

[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.380]
reportedly intense announced next week he'll run for president in 2004.

[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:59.100]
Oh, I mean, I mean, I look at this in the same category as the Raylions.

[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:00.820]
Same, same category.

[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.220]
You people in the media will report anything as if it's serious.

[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.740]
I mean, okay, so he's got to run for president.

[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:07.820]
Does he have any chance?

[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:08.200]
No, no.

[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.560]
Any chance if they rig the election, if they brought the Bush families'

[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:12.560]
rigors in it.

[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:12.700]
No.

[00:57:12.820 --> 00:57:13.060]
No.

[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.100]
He couldn't win an election for dog catcher.

[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.900]
The former vice presidential candidate, an addition to which here's the guy that

[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:21.800]
cost-gore the election.

[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.060]
You can look at a lot of people, Nader, the people at Stolett, Catherine Harris,

[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.900]
what's your name up there in Palm Beach?

[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.440]
What was your name, that bitch in Palm Beach County?

[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:29.860]
Heather Harris.

[00:57:29.860 --> 00:57:32.360]
No, no, no, she's not a pilot board.

[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:33.680]
Teresa LaPore, very good.

[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.060]
You could blame those people, but it certainly was Jew leave or minute cost.

[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:41.880]
I mean, gore could have certainly won, maybe Arkansas, maybe his home state of Tennessee,

[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.480]
but having an orthodox Jew who even, a lot of us Jews find objectionable and obnoxious,

[00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:48.520]
and wears it on his sleeve, goody-tooth shoes.

[00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:51.240]
Who was doing that finger pointing at the president?

[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:52.260]
Yeah, that's right.

[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:55.000]
Who was doing that whole, holier than now business about Monica?

[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:59.600]
And that's staying on the dress that used to be there for my drudge gun to hold of it.

[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.340]
Wonder how he got it out, do you think he shouted it out?

[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.620]
Yeah, he said, went it out, shouted out.

[00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:06.380]
Okay, man.

[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:07.960]
I heard he's a screamer.

[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:09.220]
Oh, and that was bad.

[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.580]
Now you're gonna get Lynn all upset.

[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:12.180]
Are you upset, Lynn?

[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:13.220]
No, she's not upset.

[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.240]
One thing about her, she don't give her crap.

[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.540]
She's been around a block too long.

[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.600]
Nothing bothers her.

[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.700]
Lynn Samuels, we're talking about her close personal friend.

[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:21.660]
That's for you, sweetheart.

[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:22.760]
And by the way, asshole.

[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.500]
I don't mean, I don't mean you, but she likes hearing asshole on her,

[00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.120]
because she wishes she could say it.

[00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:30.580]
So when she fills in that summer on a show, she can say asshole else she wants.

[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.460]
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.140]
The former Vice President of the National Candidate made his plans

[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:37.780]
no money at a meeting with Connecticut Democrats.

[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:40.560]
The new haven registered reported on Wednesday.

[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.520]
Lieberman would join a growing list of Democrats, hoping to spur Republican President George W.

[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.040]
is expected re-election bid.

[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:46.920]
I got news for it.

[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.780]
Was this audience voting for the re-election?

[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.300]
And gonna happen, W. They hate you like poison.

[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.300]
Look at that pool, which I'll get to momentarily.

[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.160]
Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and on John Edwards in North Carolina,

[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.680]
Vermont Governor Howard Dean, a relation to Timmy Dean,

[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.440]
and former House Minority Leader Dick Gebhard of Missouri,

[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.380]
have announced they'll all work.

[00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:08.320]
Tom Dachel says, uh-uh, Al Gore says, no way Jose.

[00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:09.660]
And that's it.

[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:11.960]
I like John Kerry a lot.

[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:12.780]
I don't think he could win.

[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.100]
Do you think John Edwards can win?

[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:14.860]
I mean, I don't...

[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.220]
He's to me, very bland.

[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.300]
Full of crap.

[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.740]
He's got tons of money he talks about being like the Everyman.

[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:21.100]
We're talking about the psychic medium.

[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.320]
Oh yeah, right. Jonathan Edwards.

[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.800]
He said he has a will to win.

[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:31.200]
Ben Curtis is the actor who plays Steve the annoying Dave.

[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:34.780]
Oh, dude, you're gonna get a del guy.

[00:59:35.140 --> 00:59:35.280]
Yeah.

[00:59:35.820 --> 00:59:37.640]
Thank you very much to every semi-disinformation.

[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.060]
This is unsurprisingly not high enough.

[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.260]
Dude, you're gonna get it.

[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.120]
He's so annoying.

[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.860]
I had to take him off the spot, except for the one spot

[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.440]
they run where he's in the house at the end.

[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:48.100]
Oh, dude, we're getting another del.

[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:49.840]
He's all high and his brother likes to smash him in the head.

[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.400]
Boy, at least I'll say this much for the del people

[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:55.140]
in their ad agency.

[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.780]
They realized they had pushed America too far

[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.640]
with that piece of crap.

[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:01.560]
They pushed everybody a little bit too far with Steve

[01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:02.920]
who was in the beginning.

[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.000]
It was amusing, you know?

[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.180]
In the beginning.

[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:07.200]
After the first 40,000 times though,

[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.140]
since they do run in enormous amount of spots,

[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:11.720]
he started to wear a little bit thin, you know what I'm saying?

[01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:14.060]
Yeah, but now they have the almost as annoying interns.

[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:17.300]
Now, they're not the same category.

[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.620]
It says, I hope you won't hold us against me,

[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.020]
but I listened to the goddess yesterday.

[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.620]
And she played the F-word.

[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.720]
She has a few of the same bits and drops.

[01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.940]
Are these from a comedy service or just ripping you off?

[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:29.920]
Well, in that particular case, just ripping us off.

[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.000]
That's not from a...

[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.500]
Or was it from a comedy service?

[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:32.860]
It was.

[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:36.000]
PS, how about a poll about the best caller?

[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.720]
I.E. fraternity guy, the happy-poor-am-lady.

[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.520]
Didn't we do that?

[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.040]
You had best bits and best calls were on there,

[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:43.860]
like Bridgetender.

[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:47.260]
Yeah, there aren't that many memorable calls that you can take a poll on.

[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:48.140]
There's what, like, four?

[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:50.160]
And if Bridgetender won the best bits?

[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.360]
It's certainly going to win that.

[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:55.120]
In fact, the fraternity guy didn't even do all that great on the best bits,

[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.400]
even if that individual day.

[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.140]
Much less the overall...

[01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.940]
P-O or about favorite drops.

[01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:01.140]
We already did favorite drop.

[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.040]
Our favorite drop ends, like...

[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.400]
Okay, well, let's do...

[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:04.960]
How about this one?

[01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:06.100]
Number two.

[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.120]
Number three.

[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.100]
Number four.

[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:09.400]
And number five.

[01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:10.620]
Which one do you like best?

[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:11.660]
And then there's always...

[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.360]
Number one.

[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:12.360]

[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:13.940]
Or...

[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:15.620]
Number two.

[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.740]
And then, of course, for...

[01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:18.360]
N-2.

[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:19.880]
N-2.

[01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:20.520]
Nicole is number three.

[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:22.580]
And the well, too.

[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:25.000]
Let's see.

[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:25.600]
Here's what it says.

[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.600]
This is a very familiar who's this from.

[01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.360]
Or maybe this is W. L. Del Rey, what does that look like?

[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:34.280]
Does that Tim Posfax?

[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:35.540]
Yes.

[01:01:35.540 --> 01:01:36.140]
You should know why now.

[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:36.200]
Yes.

[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:37.180]
Is it...

[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.220]
Purphrosli chapped it off at the top so we wouldn't see his name.

[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:40.900]
I'm sure that.

[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:45.800]
We were on the attempt. I'm not a fan but Madonna and Eminem are both talented

[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:49.680]
whether you like them or not and whether spelled W-E-T-A-T-E-R is it snowing in

[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.640]
Toronto. Raya Kirin our city will honor the type of no-toucher she'd be on your

[01:01:53.640 --> 01:02:00.720]
list. Yeah we could have put her on there. I mean he's what is he doing now which

[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.460]
one of these stupid shows is he the hosting now? He's hosting a show. Oh yeah.

[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:09.280]
Star Search. Star Search that's right. Now we got Star Search we have all of these

[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.680]
reality show which is the laughing itself. None of which have anything to do with

[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.880]
reality and they all suck. You got the Joe millionaire billionaire you got

[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:23.860]
Star Search you got this is like I have a dozen these shows not. The bachelor

[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:29.920]
and the bachelor rat right. I mean oh just it just wears me out. I don't watch

[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.020]
any of them. It still wears me out. See they got away from the whole premise and I

[01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:38.320]
will say this at least MTV once upon a time understood what it was all about.

[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:41.460]
They put hot looking people on there then they started putting ugly looking

[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:44.160]
people on there. Nobody's nobody's ever even talked about those shows.

[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.800]
I mean bad world I don't know if you'd like any of the people on there but all

[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.780]
the girls are. What do you mean you don't know if I'd like any of the people on

[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:54.280]
there? Maybe one of them. Oh that's right no I pointed out the show and you said

[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.680]
that the guy that all the girls are going crazy about the gross was gross so

[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.220]
although I do like guy gross but he's you know it's another story. Bando

[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:05.920]
Denomen. I think I'm gonna play Bando Denomen until one o'clock just the same song

[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:09.540]
over and over what do you say in fact what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna segue it with

[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.960]
Moe and the ginger the reunion which I just played. Yeah let's do that. Bando

[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:20.340]
denomen segwayed with the ginger and Moe reunion. That was my idea by the way

[01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:24.260]
it's about time I took credit for something huh not that I could have ever done

[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:27.660]
what he did but all you gotta do is plant the little seed and that fertile mind

[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:31.660]
of Bokobrine and amazingly it sprouts it like an evil wild out of control thing.

[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.320]
It says I have a friend who did six months in Stark for a DIY man slaughter

[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:39.660]
too bad he had he a cop could have gotten if he would I see what he tried to say

[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.360]
Timmy we're illiterate what you're trying to say is if he would have been a

[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:48.340]
cop he could have gotten off right 90 days suspended a sentence there's two

[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:53.300]
people dead and nobody gives a crap but I'm not gonna get excited about it anymore

[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.220]
because it's obvious the fix is in here man you just they don't care they don't

[01:03:57.220 --> 01:04:01.220]
care they care not to care and they want you to know about it too it's always been

[01:04:01.220 --> 01:04:05.980]
that way I guess just not being here once in a while you forget about it look

[01:04:05.980 --> 01:04:12.160]
at a poll look at that poll that is just shocking who is the luckiest person on

four to nine if the Yankees didn't have a game or something that she's definitely got an opinion on things

[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:47.260]
but I want to tell you I saw our friend DeFo the other day out here in Howlanddale

[01:08:47.260 --> 01:08:54.160]
yeah and I mentioned to him that what we love is billboards and that no matter what he thinks about what they're saying over there

[01:08:54.160 --> 01:09:00.280]
where you are that a lot of people still stick up for him and the way things are going with this thing between you and Mo

[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:09.020]
who knows I mean because a lot of people talk about how wonderful it was with the first the worst team with Joe and DeFo and Guilty

[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:16.960]
and when the people call up and talk to other announcers on the radio like Hank they always refer to those guys

[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.080]
and they always refer to Goldie as you know but I mentioned today that Hank hates Mo like Poison I didn't mention that yet I'm sorry go ahead

[01:09:23.080 --> 01:09:28.020]
yeah no yeah you did I think that was yesterday I mentioned that I hadn't mentioned that yet today I want to be sure mentioned that every day

[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:39.280]

[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:47.700]
that Hank was in the hall the other day singing a song that goes yo yo yo let's rate pole that's what I heard that's the that's the report

[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:59.240]
hate you like Poison though I don't know why but there's something there that's what I call my friends and when I have just a moment to leave a message I just say that yo yo yo let's rate Mo

[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:04.480]
yo yo let's rate pole yeah it's kind of catchy I find myself singing it in the shower

[01:36:01.170 --> 01:36:05.310]
all the cockers in there it says the worst part about it is that she doesn't even physically rotate

[01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:09.350]
the letters anymore she just touches the screens ever so lightly with her index finger well she

[01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:13.670]
don't want to like get a hangmail the least that bitch could do is a little physical work by

[01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:18.850]
turning the letters the financial the financial success of that f-ing bitch pisses me off because

[01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:23.050]
I'm sipping hide the desk five days a week making one tenth of what she makes in a week no wonder

[01:36:23.050 --> 01:36:27.550]
every country hates us I'm moving to Canada tomorrow god bless america sign Justin oh Justin

[01:36:28.670 --> 01:36:33.270]
wrong Justin I guess hey Justin bye bye bye he's right vanna white goes on there immediately

[01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:38.030]
I guarantee you she'll do well I I I'm sorry but to me he's got the definitive answer

[01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:41.910]
Rosie was another glaring omission on my part but vanna white

[01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:49.070]
I mean at least Rosie is controversial I mean people hate her they she's disgusting whatever you know

[01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:55.610]
but vanna is just like air the air it's there you know what I mean yep

[01:36:56.350 --> 01:37:00.550]
Paul says happy new year I was flipping the channels last night on cable and came correct interview

[01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:03.910]
with Tom jicca what a bald headed little pussy looks like Truman Capote

[01:37:05.810 --> 01:37:09.890]
I want to what channel that was on must have been the pubic access channel

[01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:14.590]
and in addition to which I noticed the byline on his comments morning Hollywood so he must

[01:37:14.590 --> 01:37:19.470]
be out there again taking freebies in Hollywood because it's like in between seasons I guess now

[01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:23.670]
so he must be out there at california again suck on a ball of free food and booze from all those

[01:37:23.670 --> 01:37:27.310]
producers on new tv show as opposed to being here I think he's out of touch don't you

[01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:33.770]
yeah I think he's out of touch with the local scene I don't think he can feel the pulse of south Florida

[01:37:33.910 --> 01:37:37.690]
so he can write all those really great columns about local south Florida TV and radio

[01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:42.470]
that he was planning on writing some year here's today's facts from Greg

[01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:47.990]
you definitely have the wrong Greg as your program director we don't have any Greg as our

[01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:53.430]
program director we have clearances our program director I never really like Greg is our general manager

[01:37:55.770 --> 01:38:00.110]
I've never really listened to your newest version of the cursed team so I decided to give it a

[01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:04.370]
chance this morning for about 20 minutes let me just say this those moments you keep playing I

[01:38:04.370 --> 01:38:08.730]
thought you invented some funny voices some fictitious characters to make fun of but they were

[01:38:08.730 --> 01:38:16.450]
practically dead on no uh... most just abusing gold elox it was like an snm show uh... bossing her

[01:38:16.450 --> 01:38:21.250]
I mean bossing him around like he was a slave well other than that your morning show is the

[01:38:21.250 --> 01:38:24.890]
most boring piece of crap I believe I've ever heard in my life I would rather listen to the endless

[01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:28.430]
loop of brick sands says running out and over that guy outside the stadium several times

[01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:33.070]
seriously though you go all the way back to the first teams infant stages would they've

[01:38:33.070 --> 01:38:36.850]
allowed to grow was even any combination thereafter and any of that would be better than the

[01:38:37.630 --> 01:38:42.210]
sorry excuse for a show kick mow off and send Kelly to wait a testicle growing seminar then

[01:38:42.210 --> 01:38:45.910]
put dead air on for four hours so we can count the chuckle through our speakers

[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:51.090]
p.s without a doubt in my mind the best call ever representing south Florida in the history of

[01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:55.290]
your program is the lady wanting the free tickets when she didn't know what they were for they were

[01:38:55.290 --> 01:38:58.550]
just free and she wanted them I'm very happy you don't give any credit crap on

[01:38:58.550 --> 01:39:02.830]
here anymore so I grab a seat pretty good behavior great I think we finally got

[01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:06.410]
you in the right place we have that by the way I know we have that it's I'm not

[01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:12.210]
playing it but it is very it's a opportunity mentions that because I

[01:39:12.210 --> 01:39:15.950]
forget all about what you told me yesterday Woody Graber comes in here

[01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:20.230]
wearing his size 92 pants with his size 52 waist and the belt he's got the

[01:39:20.230 --> 01:39:26.150]
pants up to his armpits and trying to you know get the scammers again no

[01:39:26.150 --> 01:39:29.610]
don't you want to give away some tickets on here no and so I just mentioned

[01:39:29.610 --> 01:39:33.010]
something about that about free tickets and finally this morning George tells

[01:39:33.010 --> 01:39:36.750]
me immediately I barely got the words out of my mouth about free tickets and

[01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:41.290]
some bitch calls in on one of the lines I just heard Neil give it a sound

[01:39:41.290 --> 01:39:47.790]
in a way some free tickets so what's that about see what I mean you're right we

[01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:50.190]
do have a lot of women listening out there the problem is that I only wanted

[01:39:50.190 --> 01:39:56.010]
something for free here's something for free let's see why isn't the person's

[01:39:56.010 --> 01:39:59.510]
slug you just mentioned Tom Arnold isn't on the list he's very successful with

[01:39:59.510 --> 01:40:04.130]
no tell whatsoever what an ask us here Jeff who's becoming a chronic

[01:40:04.130 --> 01:40:09.210]
factor that's okay Jeff it's okay Tom Arnold small potatoes yeah very small

[01:40:09.210 --> 01:40:16.910]
people in Moscow don't know from Tom Arnold they know Wayne Arnold well that

[01:40:17.830 --> 01:40:21.550]
I don't say no word doesn't it sound good I blamed last time Carlos would like

[01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:25.790]
some of that yeah me too so get on the phone I bet you don't come over here I

[01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:29.390]
and I mean what's wrong with that what's wrong with a little white hot nothing

[01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:32.310]
that was really good last time it was excellent in fact it keeps getting better

[01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:37.830]
and better I'm I'm a game for it I'm gay for it five six seven oh five 60

[01:40:37.830 --> 01:40:41.830]
pound five 60 so thank you so much for some excellent additions today it was

[01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:45.570]
an oversight in my part and here I thought I had put together a pretty

[01:40:45.570 --> 01:40:50.970]
definitive list I wasn't even close leave it off and Nicole Smith oh who's

[01:40:50.970 --> 01:40:54.610]
moving up rapidly I don't think she's gonna catch W but she's a very strong

[01:40:54.610 --> 01:41:01.090]
second place leaving off who else did I leave off fat Rosie and Van

[01:41:01.090 --> 01:41:04.310]
away Van went on her just now she immediately got two votes she got a

[01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:09.690]
pair hard to find them but she's got a pair and again the media just like

[01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:15.230]
everything else is hype oh Van a white they want Van a white what she like he

[01:41:15.230 --> 01:41:19.190]
said that she touches the letter and it lights up which he has nothing to do

[01:41:19.190 --> 01:41:22.270]
with it let it up it's all you know it's all like everything else until

[01:41:22.270 --> 01:41:27.650]
it's all make believe I mean at least Pat when they are here that bell at the

[01:41:27.650 --> 01:41:30.370]
end of the running out of time at least he has to give that wheel a big spin

[01:41:30.370 --> 01:41:34.910]
that's more than she does the whole goddamn show right well she's got a

[01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:40.870]
pay attention in addition to which you think she can spell most of those words

[01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:46.510]
that are on there a couple of times I'm on our our injustice pet is about to say

[01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:51.510]
oh sorry no she's like she's starting to press you know letters that bitch

[01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:56.030]
Van a white she it isn't she's not the one that bugs me so much it's the people

[01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:59.230]
that make a big fuss about her that bother me because she's on television like

[01:41:59.230 --> 01:42:02.110]
Howard Beale like oh oh like Ned Bady told Howard Beale because you're on

[01:42:02.110 --> 01:42:09.610]
television dummy good good pretty frightening but it is a good show and see

[01:42:09.610 --> 01:42:12.790]
there's why more griffin's got a lot of money does he have any votes on this

[01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:52.910]
to be positive when i'm doing the show from any place else but when i'm here i

[01:50:52.910 --> 01:50:54.970]
get that field you know what like uh... oh yeah

you get the vibe

[01:50:58.510 --> 01:51:01.450]
and remember what i said about being polite about when you're in Toronto

[01:51:01.450 --> 01:51:04.710]

[01:53:26.650 --> 01:53:29.270]
forced during arrest is not been charged with the crime

[01:53:30.050 --> 01:53:33.590]
commander ralf goodby junior said only that internal affairs was investigating

[01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:36.510]
the officer's behavior during the incident which happened about two thirty a.m.

[01:53:36.570 --> 01:53:39.590]
sunday those that apartment does not issue knives many officers carry them

[01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:42.250]
for among other things cutting seatbelts to free accident victims

[01:53:43.410 --> 01:53:46.130]
johnson and two other officers writing in an unmarked car on a special

[01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:49.470]
burglary patrol in the notice gullas is van in a parking lot near the

[01:53:49.470 --> 01:53:51.650]
huddle lounge near eight-mile and grashit

[01:53:53.110 --> 01:53:56.070]
gullas said polo what a terrible city that's turned into oh

[01:53:56.690 --> 01:54:00.150]
but anyway gullas said she just left the barn was waiting for others to come

[01:54:00.150 --> 01:54:03.230]
out so they should go together to breakfast when a car pulled up and somebody

[01:54:03.230 --> 01:54:06.710]
shined a spotlight in her purse a man approached that he was the police

[01:54:06.710 --> 01:54:11.090]
and demanded a ID gullas said she could make out only a silhouette asked the

[01:54:11.090 --> 01:54:14.590]
man from police identification i just thought i was getting a hijacked right

[01:54:14.590 --> 01:54:18.290]
then there she said after some heated give and take between the two over ideas

[01:54:18.290 --> 01:54:22.190]
johnson approached the window demanded gullas's license he wrote in his report

[01:54:22.190 --> 01:54:25.410]
that gullas smelled of booze but refused to produce her license saying she

[01:54:25.410 --> 01:54:28.830]
wasn't doing anything wrong she shifted her car in a reversing began to back up he

[01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:30.510]
wrote gullas and i said she moved the car

[01:54:31.090 --> 01:54:34.210]
johnson wrote that he reached inside to open the door and gullas pinned his hand

[01:54:34.210 --> 01:54:37.670]
with her knee and began moving the car backward again johnson wrote that he

[01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:40.110]
hit her in the face opened the door and pulled her outside out of the pavement

[01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:43.910]
he said she was pulling and pushing away from him violently

[01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:48.330]
well i guess if you thought you were being car jack you'd be pushing into

[01:54:48.330 --> 01:54:52.010]
yanket and it's whatever he cuffed her right hand but couldn't get to her left hand

[01:54:52.010 --> 01:54:56.030]
which he had tucked under her body he pulled on her coat sleeves he pulled her hand inside he wrote

[01:54:56.030 --> 01:55:01.070]
gullas denied that denied that and said the sleeves on the coat normally hang over her hands

[01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:05.210]
concerns you might be reaching for a weapon johnson pulled out a pocket knife and cut the sleeve

[01:55:05.210 --> 01:55:09.750]
off to speed up the cuffing process he wrote he severed her left ring finger with the top knuckle

[01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:14.330]
and deeply cut her middle finger she said he said that his her fingers look worse than OJs

[01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:19.370]
police at the scene removed the fingertip but it couldn't be reattached she should have probably

[01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:21.950]
sliced off his johnson would have been a lot better

[01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:29.090]

[01:59:41.410 --> 01:59:49.950]
standing out any tapes okay yeah well i got i got a clue when i thought it was a joke they called

[01:59:49.950 --> 01:59:53.230]
me from the funeral home city was going to be gone for a couple of days want to know if i could fill in

[01:59:56.230 --> 02:00:01.890]
like the hero huh see that's how we got our story i'm not touching any of this i'm not really

[02:00:01.890 --> 02:00:06.330]
sure where this is going i'm just calling because i want to require a self-immolate on the

[02:00:06.330 --> 02:00:10.130]
ear again of course we're used to that Rick so what are you doing these days you're okay i'm having

[02:00:10.130 --> 02:00:15.710]
a great time doing what uh is your kid trying to calm yourself but is a pickup truck whatever i want

[02:00:15.710 --> 02:00:20.930]
and it doesn't involve radio yeah well that's good i like that i got the clear channel cure excellent

[02:00:20.930 --> 02:00:27.030]
yeah they'll do it yeah so anyway no i was i was startled to hear that uh that mike he died

[02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:33.370]
and it was shocking you know it was how old was he 60 who was about six months older than me

[02:00:33.930 --> 02:00:38.990]
you know well either he didn't wear it well or you wear it well because i thought he was older than

[02:00:39.090 --> 02:00:45.030]
no we all did but he just had you know uh that kind of a life but he was he was born like in

[02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:50.270]
June of 42 so it was six months older than me what did he die of um it wasn't really very specific

[02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:54.490]
but i think uh you know the life of smoking and the certain other things i think that kind of

[02:00:54.490 --> 02:00:58.450]
contributed i don't know if there was like throat cancer or something but i think that the smoking

[02:00:58.450 --> 02:01:03.010]
is really what it's all about he was ill for a while then not really i mean it came on fairly

[02:01:03.010 --> 02:01:06.750]
suddenly and i guess he was on the year almost right up until the end from what i'm hearing because

[02:01:06.750 --> 02:01:11.370]
when i was back down here in october november for a month and we had a call on the year back then

[02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:14.790]
saying see do you hear mike this morning he sounded like he was drunk or something and then come

[02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:19.190]
to find out that uh it was verified that the last few days that he was on the year he really

[02:01:19.190 --> 02:01:24.490]
sounded very bad and that was close to the end let's see and then uh when you when i got a call or

[02:01:24.490 --> 02:01:28.970]
you got a call instead of you sound like you were drunk and you had your stroke yeah all of these

[02:01:28.970 --> 02:01:34.050]
different things i still have that tape by the way of you having your stroke no of me calling you

[02:01:34.050 --> 02:01:38.910]
on the year from the hospital begging pleading for somebody to come and get me out all that's right

[02:01:38.910 --> 02:01:42.970]
i was positive that they were going to kill me amount signing and it can damn close yeah and that's

[02:01:42.970 --> 02:01:47.090]
the first thing i wanted to do is come down and take you out and then have you die in the way home uh

[02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.710]
huh that would have been great well you had probably gotten a better time slot

[02:01:52.450 --> 02:01:57.890]
so anyway i would have felt bad if i didn't call and uh and at least express my sympathy and

[02:01:57.890 --> 02:02:01.490]
that was a shame he was a good guy you know you and i have both worked a lot of people in this

[02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:05.370]
business and some of them real good guys a few of them and a lot of assholes you know as you said

[02:02:05.370 --> 02:02:09.530]
he never stole a phrase right he was just you know he was just playing old mike there was nothing

[02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:13.890]
complex about him he was just always the same i would come in in the morning and he would always

[02:02:13.890 --> 02:02:19.590]
be holding up the wall yeah you know i mean seriously just like standing next to it you know just

[02:02:19.590 --> 02:02:25.050]
hi how are you and uh you know never bother day right i always always had something clear to drink

[02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:32.850]
and uh you know your brutal man no i hate to live that was his life i know

[02:02:32.850 --> 02:02:38.510]
crying out loud so i and the villain saying i mean that you know he was gone on more vacation

[02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:42.350]
when you know something it's a good thing you didn't call with this material i'm Monday because

[02:02:42.350 --> 02:02:48.810]
not that a few days have passed it makes it it makes it you know amazing yeah um when we when we

[02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:54.610]
got our start there we had just left waxy and boy gary call instead mike was going on vacation

[02:02:55.070 --> 02:03:00.390]
and uh wanted to know if we could fill in and i was just heading out of town and i said you know i'll

[02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:05.110]
unpack the the family i'll be down there uh but is there any other time i can do it you said let me

[02:03:05.110 --> 02:03:10.150]
have the ability to do i take you out here right now take your god damn teeth in yeah so he said

[02:03:10.150 --> 02:03:14.510]
well let me check and he comes back he says yeah well when he comes back he'll begin going away

[02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:20.270]
again the following week so you can fill in then he was gone all the time yeah so that's what we

[02:03:20.270 --> 02:03:24.530]
did we thought and of course i simulated that i i got a better deal of that he had a

[02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:28.950]
hard to believe it could be done i like working one week taking off six or seven working a couple

[02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:32.770]
of days taking off ten or twelve that's the way to do it and adding the different country features

[02:03:32.770 --> 02:03:39.090]
in ice baths it as well right yeah so how are you i'm doing great good i mean i'm here for a couple

[02:03:39.090 --> 02:03:42.510]
of months which i'm not too happy about but you know who now wants to freeze their ass off well

[02:03:42.510 --> 02:03:46.830]
seeing i've been doing a lot of traveling good i haven't talked to anybody in radio i have no

[02:03:46.830 --> 02:03:53.070]
desire to um i'm just you know i'm see people think that i make these things up about like cheap

[02:03:53.070 --> 02:03:57.370]
channel i think i exaggerate and the way they destroy people's lives and where they have people over

[02:03:57.370 --> 02:04:01.570]
i mean they no matter who you're working for i mean these beesleys and Greg read they're not

[02:04:01.570 --> 02:04:05.570]
exactly a picnic but no matter who else you're working for if it isn't clear channel it's got to

[02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:09.570]
be an improvement because they just have to be the absolute worst the only problem is you can't work

[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:13.290]
for anybody with clear channel because they bought up everything exactly that's right there's

[02:04:13.290 --> 02:04:18.210]
three companies on every station now what they've done is just deplorable yeah yeah i don't want to

[02:04:18.210 --> 02:04:21.650]
get into it but but i will you can get into what when you fill in the summer

[02:04:22.610 --> 02:04:27.330]
you ask your church guy is knows a little out of joint about that whole thing no you're wrong about

[02:04:27.330 --> 02:04:32.870]
that he think is there's a little out of joint i was just way out of joint just to you know be a friendly

[02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:38.330]
guy have some fun we weren't on the radio it wasn't it i i think it's i think it's it but could

[02:04:38.330 --> 02:04:45.670]
you pull it off could you do it what the whole summer yeah sure okay i don't know if i'll be

[02:04:45.670 --> 02:04:49.890]
around this summer but if i am but you know he likes to do that i've heard him he's getting real

[02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:54.610]
right and he's getting real red in the face now he never loved George because he he destroys the

[02:04:54.610 --> 02:04:58.610]
numbers when he's on he just bury all i love and you know something i've been back for like two

[02:04:58.610 --> 02:05:02.870]
weeks now two weeks uh yesterday and it takes me about a month to get the audience back when i

[02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:07.950]
come back i mean you know how many eating ass shows can you really get away with seriously staying

[02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:13.870]
away yeah at least from that conversation okay i love George but i got the uh i got the hint

[02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:19.790]
and then they took the survey and they want George they don't want us they don't you took

[02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:25.050]
the poll he won by two votes i heard it yeah by two votes well if you would have had time to make

[02:05:25.050 --> 02:05:31.170]
more calls it would have been more you guys did tremendously well on that i was surprised in fact

[02:05:31.170 --> 02:05:35.210]
if you would have had as many people listening at the i and z as you had the voting for

[02:05:35.210 --> 02:05:40.070]
on our podium still be on a year i agree but that prove it goes to show you when you're on a station

[02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:45.770]
that has no audience like that it's uh listen i just got to get this just get this off my head

[02:05:57.150 --> 02:06:01.710]
shareholders think too happy because it's down about fifty percent since then but the fact is

[02:06:01.710 --> 02:06:05.710]

Love 25 at 560 W3M. She's got seven votes. She ought to have like 7,000 now. She is definitely but

[02:11:43.710 --> 02:11:48.690]
Every time I think we've got the definitive answer that I agree with another great facts comes in wait till you're this

[02:11:49.130 --> 02:11:54.590]
It says while your list is very provocative and grab some of the most anxious names and celebrities of recent years and

[02:11:54.590 --> 02:11:58.090]
Certainly your listeners have brought up some of the additional no talent assholes worthy of our division

[02:11:58.090 --> 02:12:02.830]
I think W definitely climbs to the top of the ladder built for a successful idiots IE the presidency

[02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:08.570]
But I don't think talent's involved in politics if we're to consider undeserving talents then the king of great on talent

[02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:10.290]
It has to be Wayne Newton

[02:12:12.230 --> 02:12:14.830]
Huh hard to argue with that they'll argue it here

[02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:19.090]
So let's put that on their air if you if you can handle it Wayne Newton the Wayne Meister

[02:12:19.650 --> 02:12:22.190]
He'll probably be very upset and throw a hissy fit

[02:12:24.590 --> 02:12:26.390]
This is for radio by city

[02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:31.790]
Back to Canada you do

[02:12:31.790 --> 02:12:35.650]
Rick Riley stole my briefcase

I like the park in his face

[02:12:41.790 --> 02:12:49.410]

[02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:51.930]
Rick Riley stole my

[02:12:54.590 --> 02:12:56.790]
This race to the human race

[02:12:59.310 --> 02:13:00.430]
Your smock

[02:13:01.730 --> 02:13:06.730]

[02:13:07.230 --> 02:13:08.310]

Like a part in his face

[02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:15.930]
Rick Riley you're an asshole

[02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:21.430]
All right, not over our great call from Rick better late than ever like I said 11 30 of 5 60 W to Q

[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:24.890]
Here's a facts a facts lixing lixing George's axe

[02:13:25.570 --> 02:13:30.130]
Leave George alone. I love George. He's great. Stop complaining. Go back to f in Canada you piece of crap

[02:13:30.130 --> 02:13:33.730]
Then it says I love you to Neil girl in Miami. Well, no, she's you know

[02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:38.570]
She's just kidding around okay, but she does love you. She wants it

[02:13:38.570 --> 02:13:43.390]
By the way the luckiest person in the face of the earth is anecdotal by far that slutty fat no talent

[02:13:43.390 --> 02:13:49.830]
Probably smelly bitch. I agree with you. I bet she smells like a vet of lard and smell her through the TV. Oh, man

[02:13:50.950 --> 02:13:52.470]

Five sick and in fact you have to they have these new things that they're gonna be handing out for people I watched that show

[02:13:59.070 --> 02:14:00.930]
What are that what would you call the a thing?

[02:14:02.050 --> 02:14:05.610]
They had a certain kind of thing you'd scrape like if you had chicken fat scratch and sniff

[02:14:05.610 --> 02:14:14.470]
No, no, if you had chicken fat in a bowl in the refrigerator and then the stuff goes to the top and it has that hard layer of fat on top the

[02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:16.210]
Reem you have to have a reamer

[02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:19.130]
Call up reamer and see if he can handle it

[02:14:19.130 --> 02:14:27.430]

[02:14:34.510 --> 02:14:42.350]
That's at 7 30 Eddie K from GA after the hockey game and an ESPN radio overnight and a very interesting point about that ESPN radio thing

[02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:44.270]
That George made yesterday and you were

[02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:46.810]
this time

[02:14:47.490 --> 02:14:48.410]
Right on it

[02:14:49.110 --> 02:14:53.830]
That is when Joe and Mark were on Friday nights. That was a chance for people to sample them people who are out late

[02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:57.770]
I mean like real late and water at home in the middle of the night three four in the morning and here Joe and Mark

[02:14:57.770 --> 02:15:01.570]
I know like a real live show on his station and then I say oh by the way, they're on every night and

[02:15:02.650 --> 02:15:05.050]
We actually know who they are and we'll like maybe put them down

[02:15:07.150 --> 02:15:10.890]
But because somebody on this radio station wanted to have a live lead at every morning

[02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:14.590]
Wow, we don't want to have them doing Friday nights overnight. We'll have them doing Sunday night

[02:15:14.590 --> 02:15:18.390]
Which nobody else does anywhere in the universe in history this business? Well, I'm just on it

[02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:20.630]
So he can have the honor of a live lead in it, right?

[02:15:20.810 --> 02:15:25.250]
So he's trying on both ends to like have somebody else goose up his number form

[02:15:25.670 --> 02:15:32.010]
Pillars looking. Yeah, that's right. And so what does he do now after claiming to be good buddies with the dirty boys

[02:15:32.010 --> 02:15:37.810]
Which he was talking about odd nauseam since they were the only people in the building would speak to him now he turns on them

[02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:42.910]
Wow, I'm sandwiched in between two non-sport shows. I'm doomed. Well, you're part right

The dead man. Oh, I miss I miss

[02:16:07.930 --> 02:16:12.290]
Yeah, but you know that's not true though. He's in his time. He's in a lot of good stuff

[02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:18.750]
Not in the last 50 years. Yeah, about a hundred years ago. Okay, thanks. No, I miss used to be very funny

[02:16:19.430 --> 02:16:21.810]
As a matter of fact a lot of people don't realize it

[02:16:21.810 --> 02:16:24.650]
But speaking of I miss one of the bits that we've been playing for a hundred years

[02:16:24.650 --> 02:16:30.370]
If I can find that anything it was done by I miss and his cohorts back when he used to be funny and we used to do like real ready

[02:18:52.770 --> 02:18:56.830]
5 6 7 we got 501 votes already and Wayne Newton just got his first vote

I heard that Rosie does get her licks. Yes, sir. They knew. Yeah. How you doing? Okay? Good. I got one for you

[02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:17.050]
She could jump in the fat ass contest too. How about this Monica Lewinsky?

[02:19:19.850 --> 02:19:25.450]
She's like a celebrity well, then since you read a book, you know, she gets famous for getting rubbed off by a cigar

[02:19:25.450 --> 02:19:29.150]
Yeah, she got rubbed off well, you know, it's gonna get rubbed out

[02:19:29.510 --> 02:19:35.390]
Okay, let's see. Let's pass it by the judges. Okay. They say no chance. I mean like she is well known

[02:19:35.390 --> 02:19:38.510]
She's famous, but she doesn't pretend to be a talent while she has some talent

[02:19:39.310 --> 02:19:41.170]
She designed those handbags

[02:19:43.970 --> 02:19:47.630]
See if you would have just gone to the dry cleaners. That's all set of going to Matt Dredges house

[02:19:47.630 --> 02:19:53.250]
Just go to the dry clears and I'll tell you another fat ass bitch who makes me nauseous speaking of Monica's that Lucy and Goldberg

[02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:54.370]
Who?

[02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:57.830]
See that I got like a oh

[02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:02.890]
Because of Lucian she just leaves a lump in my throat that bitch

[02:20:04.430 --> 02:20:06.330]
She's got like a female misgrudge

[02:20:06.330 --> 02:20:10.950]
And then again so is he here's Kendall. Hello

[02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:16.670]
Happy New Year, sir. All right. Yeah, I just got contacted to be a meal from family

[02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:26.150]
Absolutely, I'd like to tell you what I'm gonna put down ahead of time

[02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:29.870]
If you know my what were you say put down? Is that how it works?

[02:20:30.350 --> 02:20:34.610]
Wilson is a Nielsen or arbitrary on your talking about Nielsen. I believe it's TV. Oh

[02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:35.090]
Shoot

[02:20:35.830 --> 02:20:36.490]
Okay, well

[02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:44.310]
Eventually, hopefully I'll get the other one for you guys exactly anyways for us you know the only hours that I do not listen is

[02:20:44.310 --> 02:20:47.030]
Between six and nine in the morning really I can't stand it

[02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:51.590]
I put on Howard for a little bit and then I come back and you're there and the rest of the day

[02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:57.950]
I always have a radio on in the house, but I'm telling you I can't stand listening to the guys in the morning and it's a shame

[02:20:58.610 --> 02:21:05.690]
Really is the same, but I'm getting pounded. Yeah, I got it wish. How about Dr. Phil for the list? Oh

[02:21:05.690 --> 02:21:11.030]
Excellent. He is just outstanding. Sir, you just redeemed your life. Thank you Niel

[02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:15.270]
Thank you very much. I love you too. Bye doctor Phil get that on there immediately Eric or else

[02:21:16.130 --> 02:21:20.650]
Rose Carlos is ready to come up there and kick your ass. Oh, you lick your ass. I'm sorry. I misunderstood

[02:21:21.390 --> 02:21:25.910]
5 6 5 6 7 oh, well, you've been hanging around for George so long. I don't know

[02:21:26.730 --> 02:21:29.470]
That big brown crack that George is always pedaling to the world

[02:21:30.570 --> 02:21:35.910]
That's gonna be our pool. I think on Monday. What do you like better George talking about licking crack or a recon suds?

[02:21:36.650 --> 02:21:38.510]
How about cracking suds?

[02:21:39.670 --> 02:21:42.870]
We can put you were already on with suds. I didn't hear too much about it

[02:21:42.870 --> 02:21:47.630]
I didn't hear people over town saying oh god. You heard George on with suds that one day and here anybody said a couple calls

[02:21:47.630 --> 02:21:52.790]
Yeah, a couple of calls what are they saying? Oh, they loved it. Did they well? Let's not hear anybody talking about it today

[02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:56.690]
Of course, that's all your crowds so they're already gone how that I've been back so long. Oh, yeah, what?

[02:21:57.670 --> 02:22:04.430]
You don't think that there are people listen when you're on who as soon as I come back disappear. You're crazy maybe two well, that's people

[02:22:06.470 --> 02:22:09.250]
That's as many people as we're listening to Rick and suds on I and Z

[02:22:09.250 --> 02:22:12.490]
I actually they I'm not gonna say they had like a water one six

[02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:17.010]
I mean everything is relative they had like ones and the rest of the station had like point ones

[02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:19.050]
See it's because of that stock market business

[02:22:19.610 --> 02:22:24.010]
Yeah, that's right. Let's let's start ripping Rick so George will feel a little more secure over the weekend that we don't

[02:22:24.010 --> 02:22:29.030]
They're gonna bring Rick in here. He's so funny. Wow the future is a rough point. I'll see fair value is minus two

[02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:32.730]
Yeah, Rick if you would have stopped doing that that even sud said that you know, oh he didn't

[02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:35.390]
Didn't he say hold on here? Oh?

[02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:42.910]
But I stopped trying to be a stock maven okay Rick there are no stock mavens. It's all a big fat ripoff is what it is a big scam

[02:22:43.930 --> 02:22:49.050]
And I still say Ted David and all of our people in CNBC. They should all be in jail. Oh, you know who's on

[02:22:49.050 --> 02:22:54.610]
Fox now, which I never turned them on but my luck. I don't even know what his name is Jim something

[02:22:54.610 --> 02:22:59.050]
He used to be on MSNBC news guys pretty good neighbors. Yeah Jim neighbors

[02:23:00.050 --> 02:23:01.910]
He was I think he's doing Bill Riley

[02:23:02.350 --> 02:23:08.050]
Oh right Rick Riley or Bill O'Reilly, but anyway, so he was a gym. I can never think of this guy. I think it's Jim

[02:23:09.130 --> 02:23:15.770]
He used to do like daytime news on MSNBC then they put on at really great show. Um, you can impress. I still watch that show

[02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:18.030]
Hey, to break the news. Yeah, I like that show

[02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:23.970]
Have you ever seen it? Yeah, half a once and and yeah something happened to Pat

[02:23:25.390 --> 02:23:27.510]
Yeah exactly see the near death experience

[02:23:28.470 --> 02:23:32.530]
I mean, yeah, it's certain topics that will come up and his right wing leanings come back

[02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:33.990]
I mean really come surging back

[02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:39.750]
But generally speaking he's certainly a lot more reasonable. It used to be and the fact that Bill presses there and he got some interesting people on there

[02:23:39.750 --> 02:23:41.730]
I have no idea what kind of numbers they get

[02:23:42.470 --> 02:23:44.730]
But that's by far and away the best show on MSNBC

[02:23:44.730 --> 02:23:49.750]
And that if they would just give her that fat Jerry Nockman and get him out as the news editor was he hasn't got a clue

[02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:51.530]
What's all about get him off of there man?

[02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:56.190]
He's like a male Rosio Donald big tub of crap Jerry Nockman

[02:23:57.010 --> 02:24:02.570]
He's one of those people looks like every breath is gonna be like you know ever seen people like that who are so fat that it like like like the

[02:24:02.970 --> 02:24:05.710]
Clotaries are just clogged at the point where their face is always red

[02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:10.770]
And every breath sounds like it's gonna be the very last gas that's Jerry Nockman

[02:24:11.490 --> 02:24:13.310]
Can't imagine why he don't have a big number on her

[02:24:14.590 --> 02:24:15.770]
Especially in the dinner hour

[02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:23.110]

Larry King 27 M&M 25 Bill Gates 18 Rosie stuck on 15 and Vanna is on Rosie's ass with 11

[02:24:45.630 --> 02:24:48.330]
I bet you I bet you Rosio would like to have Van on her ass. Don't you think?

[02:24:50.730 --> 02:24:51.610]
Yes definitely

[02:24:51.610 --> 02:24:53.270]

[02:25:25.390 --> 02:25:28.510]
It was he was the one making it was the play calling not north turner

[02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:33.230]
What do you see if you people knew anything about football first of all maybe those sports yours might be a little more interesting

[02:25:33.870 --> 02:25:39.530]
But listening to these and well, what do you think about the dolphin schedule next year guys? What do you think about the teams are gonna be playing?

[02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:50.970]
This is the 10th of January and we've got morons calling this radio station asking for our experts and perverts to critique the dolphin schedule next year

[02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:58.510]

[02:26:34.110 --> 02:26:34.810]
Good guy

[02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:40.090]
And you know something if they lose another game next season the heracune's after that disaster at the festival

If they're winning the games they're great if they lose uh, you know if they choke a couple of games

Now what was I just starting to say about that guy?

[02:31:02.110 --> 02:31:05.630]
Well, yeah, it was giving me about wow, they say you're you're dwelling on negativity

[02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:08.150]
Let me tell you something sir if we take a poll

[02:31:08.950 --> 02:31:13.310]
On issue and ask for people to be positive about something as opposed to rip somebody and ask

[02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:18.590]
It's no contest the responses 50,000 times more rip in an ass. That's just the nature of the beast, okay?

[02:31:19.010 --> 02:31:22.150]
So we're not here like traveling to solve the problems of the world. I gave up on that

[02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:26.390]
We're here to like try to you know stimulate the audience get some numbers get people listen

[02:31:26.390 --> 02:31:29.430]
Get him whipped up into a frenzy about things that they can hang onto in squeeze

[02:31:30.110 --> 02:31:32.130]
And that's what they want to squeeze is negativity

[02:31:33.050 --> 02:31:35.730]
But blame me for it. I'm the one that made it like it. Right

[02:31:37.570 --> 02:31:40.850]
I'm glad he's entertained though. That's that way. Yeah, it's amazing. He admitted that

[02:31:40.850 --> 02:31:44.590]
He finds it very entertaining and what's wrong with ruffian people who deserve to be ripped?

[02:31:44.930 --> 02:31:48.990]
I mean the kind of money that they're making right don't they deserve it sure

[02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:57.610]
Let's see over extensions. See see what I mean about one dimensional rick's senses although he is on national TV

[02:31:57.610 --> 02:32:00.090]
The calls about him really yeah

[02:32:01.370 --> 02:32:03.330]
You have a rick's sense his fetish out there

I agree with you he makes my skin

[02:32:06.010 --> 02:32:11.170]
Roll up and my blood curtle but the fact of the matter is he's such small potatoes putting him in a list with

[02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:15.670]
George W and Oprah and Larry King and the Bill Gates and Rosio down

[02:32:16.210 --> 02:32:21.610]
Who now even knows who he is outside of this market even though he is on national TV nobody watches MSNBC anyway

[02:32:21.610 --> 02:32:26.190]
And you know something maybe that's part of the problem. I think they were doing pretty good till uh Sanchez got there

[02:32:27.390 --> 02:32:33.950]
I shouldn't say that will get Paul Castanova upset remember that when Rick went off to seek his fortune with MSNBC

Merve Griffin's got a pair and Wayne Newton's got only that one

[02:43:14.090 --> 02:43:16.370]
I thought that was a pretty good choice than you Wayne Newton

[02:43:16.830 --> 02:43:18.570]
He couldn't sing as wide of a paper sack

[02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:22.450]
Although he does have some red roses. He's got some of those for Blue Lady

[02:43:23.290 --> 02:43:26.450]
Anybody out there every day to Blue Lady so he didn't like Duncan Shane

[02:43:26.450 --> 02:43:27.730]
Thunky chain

[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:35.430]
No, I did not and I find it long I find him in every respect his the the entire ambiance and the whole routine with the mob

[02:43:35.430 --> 02:43:39.630]
And with the lawsuits and would then be see I find him to be absolutely unacceptable

[02:43:40.250 --> 02:43:43.570]
I thought that was a little girl singing that song for years it was

[02:43:44.430 --> 02:43:49.750]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T in Verizon wireless line

[02:43:51.250 --> 02:43:56.970]
Here's a call from Davie hello. Neil yes, sir first time car long time with okay first one

[02:43:57.650 --> 02:44:01.750]
White heterosexual redneck. Yes, good. We need a few of those

[02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:04.630]
I like to two people to you with please

[02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:06.650]
Michael Jackson and Camel Anderson

[02:44:07.450 --> 02:44:11.930]
Now Michael Jackson as much as we find him disturbing and pedophilia and all the other stuff

[02:44:11.930 --> 02:44:13.830]
You got to admit he did some pretty good stuff

[02:44:13.830 --> 02:44:16.710]
Now that guy's just down right nasty. He is down right nasty

[02:44:16.710 --> 02:44:18.510]
But in other words, you don't think he did any good music?

[02:44:19.250 --> 02:44:22.830]
No, okay, but Pamela Lee I think that you get some very good

[02:44:23.610 --> 02:44:27.490]
Support for that in here. There you go. Good choice. Thanks pal. Yep, good weekend. Thank you

[02:44:27.930 --> 02:44:33.590]
Yeah, Pamela Lee, let's put to her on air Eric poor Eric. Well, I'm proud of us. We're interrupting your branches today Eric

[02:44:33.590 --> 02:44:34.510]
I know the weekends coming

[02:44:36.250 --> 02:44:39.250]
But I think Pamela Lee definitely deserves to be on air because she's another

[02:44:40.430 --> 02:44:41.150]
Oh, although

[02:44:42.370 --> 02:44:44.370]
Well, I guess we'll put him on put her on air

[02:44:44.370 --> 02:44:46.170]
But the fact is when she was on Baywatch

[02:44:46.810 --> 02:44:49.930]
She at least served some purpose you follow what I'm saying

[02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:55.590]
Screen filler. No, no, she wasn't just a screen filler. Maybe the use she was a screen filler a lot of guys out there

[02:44:55.590 --> 02:44:57.670]
In fact, when she was dating Kelly Slater

[02:44:58.350 --> 02:45:00.070]
the surfer from Coco Beach

[02:45:01.310 --> 02:45:05.550]
Even I was somewhat aroused by that thought not so much because of her, but you know

[02:45:05.550 --> 02:45:05.750]
I

[02:45:07.350 --> 02:45:11.690]
Was wondering what he was bearing between those large make-believe silicone breasts

[02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:14.870]
You know what I mean? I'm sure you do

[02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:21.310]
Kelly Slater, you know, there's a series of surfer movies speaking of those corny channels

[02:45:21.310 --> 02:45:26.370]
I haven't Toronto on the digital cable. I guess they run driving TV driving classics

[02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:32.730]
Uh, and these are the faggiest things I've ever seen. I think Bruce Brown is the name of the guy. He's got his married

[02:45:32.730 --> 02:45:34.210]
He's got a son the whole day they were on there

[02:45:35.610 --> 02:45:38.710]
But the whole surfer thing there's something about that you know what I mean?

[02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:44.290]
But all those endless summer movies. Yeah, right. There's a whole bunch of those. Yeah. Am I am I wrong? No, you're not because I watched that

[02:45:44.290 --> 02:45:49.250]
I thought this is and not that I didn't enjoy some of it. There were some really hot guys surfers, hmm, but anyway

[02:45:50.390 --> 02:45:52.370]
But it just seemed to me like fag movies

[02:45:53.030 --> 02:45:57.570]
Indeed, okay. Thank you. Hey, we finally agreed on something. I've only been 11 years

[02:45:58.370 --> 02:46:03.350]
And I couldn't believe I guess you won't bring Rick and Sudson like app rules music. Yeah

[02:46:04.090 --> 02:46:06.910]
And Shakira right we agree on those right

[02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:11.810]
What else that's about it. I think we're not about father. Let's not get too carried away

[02:46:13.150 --> 02:46:21.410]
5 6 7 0 5 60 here's a call from pepper pines. Hello. Hey, mr. Nioh. How would you like to hear a perfect example of abusive police power? Yeah

[02:46:21.410 --> 02:46:27.230]
And in Halifax, Virginia the town has a public drunkenness ordinance

[02:46:27.870 --> 02:46:30.690]
The local police went into a bar up there

[02:46:31.450 --> 02:46:33.770]
Marched all the patrons that were in the bar

[02:46:34.850 --> 02:46:35.330]
Right

[02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:40.910]
Game of sobriety test and those that were drunk they arrested those that were drunk yet

[02:46:40.910 --> 02:46:46.630]
We're allowed to go back into the bar drink. How the hell can they do that? That's that's the the mayor said that

[02:46:46.630 --> 02:46:48.590]
That's the way it is because that's public drunkenness

[02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:53.030]
Because a public when they marched them out on the street. Yeah

[02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:57.910]
Some other words if they would have stayed in there for another couple hours and sobered up that would that would not be acceptable

[02:46:58.290 --> 02:47:03.650]
That would not be acceptable excellent. What what town was this Halifax, Virginia

[02:47:03.650 --> 02:47:08.670]
I think thanks for the good news. We'll mark it off our list. You're welcome. Thank you

[02:47:08.670 --> 02:47:13.130]
Stata Halifax, Virginia. Okay, folks Halifax Nova Scotia. You can go there. That's okay. You're safe

[02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.950]
They're real fascists in Virginia. No

[02:47:15.950 --> 02:47:21.710]
I mean above and beyond any of the other I want to tell you right now because I was discussing this with somebody yesterday

[02:47:23.730 --> 02:47:24.250]
The

[02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:25.150]
South

[02:47:26.570 --> 02:47:33.690]
The southern state the southern mentality nature of the US the Bible. They even when you look on the map states like for example

[02:47:33.690 --> 02:47:39.030]
Nebraska on the Bible Brett built Nebraska geographically Nebraska certainly not in the south but

[02:47:39.590 --> 02:47:42.250]
It's in the south problem saying Indiana

[02:47:43.010 --> 02:47:48.950]
Indiana is right next to Ohio in Illinois sandwiched in between you think oh, that's a northern amid western state wrong

[02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:50.250]
It says other southern state

[02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:57.410]
Especially southern Indiana. I told her that time that I went to do basketball broadcast in Indianapolis

[02:47:58.930 --> 02:48:03.510]
Attornament and we go into like a restaurant that talking could I'm saying we're never saying ever like y'all

[02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:05.170]
I y'all my mom

[02:48:06.210 --> 02:48:11.250]
I'm serious all of them you Indianapolis is the deep South, baby

[02:48:12.530 --> 02:48:17.190]
What's point my point being that the US as a mugwom country is what it's turned into

[02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:22.070]
Even like Virginia Virginia is not so far south on a map

[02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.950]
No, nope

[02:48:24.470 --> 02:48:27.850]
But it sure is in the nature of the people who live there at a whole mentality there

[02:48:27.850 --> 02:48:33.890]
It might as well be might might as well be one of that like between Mississippi and Louisiana and Alabama and of course Florida

[02:48:34.470 --> 02:48:34.790]
Florida

[02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:38.370]
That's a problem

[02:48:38.370 --> 02:48:40.350]
Our love on you

[02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:44.270]
One you don't like onions

[02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:46.150]
Why doesn't like chocolate

[02:48:53.430 --> 02:48:56.190]
Never in my life as I met someone who didn't like chocolate

[02:48:56.790 --> 02:48:59.790]
Good going this morning. That's probably after all you're talking about

[02:48:59.790 --> 02:49:04.190]
Eating ass not a way before that I probably turn them off on it. He used to love it

[02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:10.410]
You know what they have in Toronto like in any real city they have like all these vendors out on the streets

[02:49:11.410 --> 02:49:17.810]
And they have like hot dogs or sausages like bratwurst or a tenant. I love the Italian sausages and they have fried onions. They put on them. Oh

[02:49:19.310 --> 02:49:19.710]
man

[02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:24.190]
For a while or they made them stop doing that because the health department stepped in there was something about

[02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:29.530]
I don't know they were making a big fuss, but now the good news is the fried onions are back downtown Toronto boys and girls

[02:49:29.530 --> 02:49:32.850]
That's a good news. He sweeps the dice onions off the little burgers

[02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:38.830]
I'm gonna tell you right now ladies and gentlemen anybody who doesn't like onions is a communist piece of crap

[02:49:39.550 --> 02:49:41.210]
Something wrong with like good little carlos

[02:49:41.210 --> 02:49:47.290]
I don't know how can you not like onions do you know anybody else who doesn't like onions

[02:49:48.330 --> 02:49:53.250]
Like children maybe you know how they don't like onions and green peppers and things like that, but no adult

[02:49:54.830 --> 02:50:00.350]
Well, see I think you just touched on it. You look at him and you think of adult. That's an adult. I don't

[02:50:03.270 --> 02:50:06.830]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:11.550]

[02:50:12.930 --> 02:50:17.010]
He was shaking the envelope. I could hear the coins rattling all the way in here right to the glass

[02:50:18.770 --> 02:50:21.910]
We love that the what's his name. We love that clearance man

[02:50:22.530 --> 02:50:25.950]
Sure, we're pulling for him. He's pulling it too is what I'm hearing a lot, but

[02:50:26.650 --> 02:50:28.030]
We're pulling for him to get laid

[02:50:29.150 --> 02:50:31.230]
Maybe muff could get him fixed up

[02:50:31.850 --> 02:50:34.390]
Make it maybe he could take him off this weekend and get him

[02:50:34.910 --> 02:50:37.230]
laid. I think in Hawaii

[02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:44.990]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T now I was taking more like on the 21st in Biscayne

[02:50:47.430 --> 02:50:54.090]

[02:51:08.490 --> 02:51:12.310]
See what I mean that shrink guy that called before about negativity these people are hostile

[02:51:12.310 --> 02:51:15.170]
They're listening every single day, but let me take a shot come on

[02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:17.990]
Let's take a shot. We're meeting gonna bust his balls. I got news for you pal

[02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:20.090]
I got it. I got a fat one in my pocket right now

[02:51:20.090 --> 02:51:24.090]
That's more than you're going to make in the next five years put together, okay? That I'm taking right to the bank

[02:51:24.510 --> 02:51:26.190]
So blow it off your little spick ass

[02:51:27.090 --> 02:51:28.210]
Here's West Palm Beach hello

[02:51:29.310 --> 02:51:33.730]
Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I got one for you. Thanks. Mm-hmm. How about Miss Cleo?

[02:51:34.270 --> 02:51:36.890]
Oh come on. She's a great actress man

[02:51:37.930 --> 02:51:39.430]
She's no seriously. She's

[02:51:39.430 --> 02:51:43.350]
Yeah, mine because she don't know she didn't even really speak with that essence. She you are really put on

[02:51:43.350 --> 02:51:50.030]
How'd you like to have an interest bearing account in the bank all the money that she raked in with that act exactly exactly is right

[02:51:50.030 --> 02:51:52.930]
So cut it up. We like Miss Cleo on his show a lot

[02:51:54.710 --> 02:51:59.330]
We're not too crazy about Paul and old Ron, but we do like Miss Cleo. By the way, Paul you're not getting the morning show

[02:52:00.110 --> 02:52:04.890]
I just mentioned that again just in passing just to so you stop bugging PD Lenny and he stops bugging me

[02:52:05.570 --> 02:52:10.190]
Already passed it around the building. I passed it around a little bit. I said oh that smells like Paul

[02:52:11.030 --> 02:52:17.070]
No chance no chance in your pants your stuck with cheap channel and Rick Riley says he's be ecstatic

[02:52:17.070 --> 02:52:19.570]
He believes to be away from them. I don't blame you Rick

[02:52:20.490 --> 02:52:23.850]
See I always got along okay with Rick. It was George. I had a real serious problem

[02:52:23.850 --> 02:52:26.810]
And I was got a much bigger problem because he knows that they're hovering like vultures

[02:52:26.810 --> 02:52:30.250]
See suds was in here, but you know something he was just scoping the thing out

[02:52:31.350 --> 02:52:37.310]
He was he was laying the groundwork for um for the suds. I mean for Rick and now they're recalled here today

[02:52:37.310 --> 02:52:39.010]
See Rick didn't call about Mike

[02:52:39.910 --> 02:52:43.130]
He called about to be an honest sorrow filling him when I'm not here

[02:52:44.570 --> 02:52:47.870]
The Mike thing was just windowed resting at this point. I mean, you know, it's old news

[02:52:49.130 --> 02:52:54.630]
So Rick and suds are getting together. They're plotting you don't look on family feud the family would get together and of course kind of embarrassing too

[02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:55.750]
They were all done there underneath

[02:52:56.450 --> 02:52:59.410]
I think there's a different word for that, but I'm sure they used to call it plotting

[02:53:00.410 --> 02:53:04.530]
And that's what we're consented in their plotting after you're I don't want to say demise

[02:53:05.310 --> 02:53:11.570]
Hey listen guys somebody much much older than you guys put together tried that already this year their last year didn't work out

[02:53:11.570 --> 02:53:13.270]
I don't want to mention no names

[02:53:15.250 --> 02:53:16.550]
Here's West Palm Beach hello

[02:53:17.230 --> 02:53:21.830]
Neil yes sir all south Florida surfers are fags no doubt about that. Are they really?

[02:53:22.590 --> 02:53:25.310]
Absolutely, huh, but there's one thing about the sport

[02:53:26.250 --> 02:53:29.890]
No Schwarzer's will you ever see surfing ever? That's not true

[02:53:30.530 --> 02:53:34.430]
No, no, and he's maybe not anymore, but in these movies I was talking about there was one

[02:53:34.430 --> 02:53:39.370]
Maybe he was the token. I don't know, but they had one black guy. I was surfing well very small percentage

[02:53:39.990 --> 02:53:42.430]
And uh, well, I said black people can swim

[02:53:42.970 --> 02:53:47.450]
I'm sorry how many black swimmers do you ever see how many black divers when you watch they swim me

[02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:48.750]
You don't see anything they can't swim

[02:53:48.750 --> 02:53:51.910]
None I think that's part of the beauty of the sport that old means

[02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:56.250]
Those big feet no you don't mean to sound racist rating like that, but you know, I think you have a good point

[02:53:58.430 --> 02:54:03.510]
Black people can't swim white white men can't jump and black folks can't swim. That's what Greg Lucena said

[02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:10.350]
567 boy this launches so damn good, you know, I think this was a masterpiece on my

[02:54:11.390 --> 02:54:16.230]
My my my you don't like the other chicken drumettes. No, the best crispyest batch they've ever made there

[02:54:16.890 --> 02:54:18.390]
Well, I'm real happy for you. Okay

[02:54:20.010 --> 02:54:24.190]
592 votes on a pole shocking Pamela Lee is on there now. She don't have any votes

[02:54:24.890 --> 02:54:28.530]
What the hell's the black hidden kid which I can ever remember his name damn it. They used to be on Baywatch

[02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:36.470]
The short kid dark black here David Charvet. No, not David Charvet. That's like a little kind of fruity if you ask me

[02:54:36.470 --> 02:54:41.950]
No, the really the kid that's it was on another show now. He's on some one of those nighttime shows

[02:54:43.170 --> 02:54:48.290]
You know who I'm talking about we've been told yes you do he knows we've been through this 50 billion times

[02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:53.470]
You know, I never watched it episode. He played Billy either he's Billy on some other show where he was Billy on Baywatch

[02:54:53.930 --> 02:54:57.050]
We are nice looking little kid with this short black hair

[02:54:59.890 --> 02:55:04.330]
Somebody will call I apologize to the audience, but when you get his old as I am you forget like where you live

[02:55:04.830 --> 02:55:07.050]
I have to have somebody escort me to the house. So I remember where to go

[02:55:08.310 --> 02:55:11.630]
And it's it's a real Billy maybe that is his name

[02:55:13.590 --> 02:55:13.910]
Billy

[02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:18.330]
Squire Billy Billy Max Billy Bibbit might be it

[02:55:19.030 --> 02:55:23.050]
Somebody will fax it and it was immediately if not sooner. You'll see now. Why did I mention that?

[02:55:23.170 --> 02:55:27.250]
Oh, cause of Baywatch and Pamela Lee. I'll take another person out. I can't stand who also belongs on our list

[02:55:27.250 --> 02:55:30.390]
But we won't put him on there because Eric will be upset David Hasselhoff

[02:55:30.390 --> 02:55:36.770]
Speaking of Baywatch boy. He is he just and you talk about a guy with an ego man. He's got an ego bigger than Mo

[02:55:37.290 --> 02:55:43.890]
This guy thinks his stuff don't stink David Hasselhoff. Oh look remember that show I was in with a car. No. Yeah big deal

[02:55:45.430 --> 02:55:51.150]
Nothing like watching some old troll like David Hasselhoff running out there in a bathing suit pretend to be sexy. Oh

[02:55:51.150 --> 02:55:53.570]
Oh, well, you know something in this country and it sells

[02:55:54.690 --> 02:55:59.650]
Just like these damn shows you talking about these reality shows they bring on all these unbelievably ugly people

[02:56:00.110 --> 02:56:02.670]
And the really desperate like clearance their gathered around her said

[02:56:03.310 --> 02:56:07.190]
You know they're rubbing themselves raw just looking at these grow because they think it might be alive

[02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:10.450]
You know it's alive. It's on my TV. There's a little skin there, you know

[02:56:11.590 --> 02:56:12.310]
Very sad

[02:56:12.910 --> 02:56:19.310]
Billy Warlock. Thank you Billy Warlock. Was he one? Here's Hollywood. Hello general hospital. Thank you general hospital

[02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:26.310]
Hello Hollywood. Yes, sir. Hey Neil how you doing? How you doing? How you doing? How you doing? How about the Martha Stewart?

[02:56:27.550 --> 02:56:30.610]
Oh man, you know something she could be the winner. Thank you so much

[02:56:31.830 --> 02:56:35.590]
Thanks a lot pal. You got it. She's on her Martha Stewart. How do we leave her out?

[02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:38.470]
And you know what this what the moral of this story is

[02:56:39.370 --> 02:56:40.730]
That there's a zillion

[02:56:41.850 --> 02:56:46.450]
Untalented assholes running around out there who make it millions of dollars who can't do the squat. It's an inspiration

[02:56:46.450 --> 02:56:49.910]
I think she wants to concentrate on her salad though. This is what I'm hearing

[02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:52.690]
I love that that was the best

[02:56:52.690 --> 02:56:58.010]
Well listen Martha did you really do insider trading? You really repot the ball. I'm concentrating on my salad

[02:57:00.170 --> 02:57:04.850]
As she had her head buried in the bowl. She's enough to make me have my head buried in the bowl

[02:57:06.810 --> 02:57:09.130]
12 17 we're gonna talk on money about toilets

[02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:11.970]
All right, no seriously. Do you ever have a problem?

[02:57:12.190 --> 02:57:17.330]
Did you ever have a problem with the toilet that doesn't is it the water pressure that makes you sometimes have to flush two or three times?

[02:57:17.510 --> 02:57:20.670]
Yes, because they're all different kinds and in that bothers me

[02:57:20.670 --> 02:57:24.830]
I've got a really crappy toilet if I can say that in recent days they've tried to make water

[02:57:26.050 --> 02:57:28.610]
Conscious towards the cancer currents conservation

[02:57:28.610 --> 02:57:30.650]
So they don't use as much water as the old-style

[02:57:30.650 --> 02:57:33.390]
But I don't have one of those right well

[02:57:34.290 --> 02:57:37.870]
You don't know I mean if your house was built in this century it might have a newer toilet in it

[02:57:39.270 --> 02:57:40.290]
What it was that mean

[02:57:41.490 --> 02:57:48.430]
Like the old-style toilets flush great, but if your house is relatively new like I know you were in my house is 10 or 11 years old

[02:57:48.430 --> 02:57:52.210]
That's not that's new it is yeah, well my toilet stinks

[02:57:52.910 --> 02:57:56.430]
Of course, I'm gonna stop to sniff it twice 12 18 at 5

[02:59:48.530 --> 02:59:53.550]
Yeah, because I'll share an anger. It's not an everyday thing. It's maybe every other day

[02:59:53.550 --> 02:59:56.410]
I now pronounce you husband and wife

[03:00:00.750 --> 03:00:02.650]

[03:00:09.430 --> 03:00:14.110]
Your husband is controlling yeah turbulent. Yeah dangerous. Absolutely. Just leave

No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to go then. It's the life we live here. Yeah, because we're walking rollers now and this is forever

[03:00:21.370 --> 03:00:21.950]
That's the

[03:00:23.210 --> 03:00:28.170]
In other words, this is the life we have chosen as what worth of trying to say. I am so sick and tired of them

[03:00:28.590 --> 03:00:28.950]
Oh

[03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:32.890]

[03:00:51.370 --> 03:00:55.610]
Like an apple on her lunch break Utica free academy in New York 1953 to 57

[03:00:55.610 --> 03:00:57.330]
That's why nobody would talk to your mom

Somebody must have no you don't have to talk the thus true. Oh, and speaking of that

[03:01:03.810 --> 03:01:06.810]
Frank fax is this it says as far as Pamela Lee's concern

She definitely deserves on this list for lease talent even in her best performance co-starring Tommy Lee she sucked at sucking

[03:01:12.650 --> 03:01:14.370]
Couldn't get Tommy off of the life of her

How do you like that? So not only is she disgusting obnoxious and plastic, but she uh gives bad head

I mean once upon a time for about two or three minutes there

[03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:30.510]
She was very hot. That's when she was going with Kelly Slater then she's skanked out

[03:01:30.510 --> 03:01:33.550]

Or whoever that is

[03:02:39.010 --> 03:02:43.870]
I don't know and maybe it's just a bad picture she don't look all that great to me. She was a treasure round

[03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:50.430]
Mm-hmm she's a port star. So what is that prove so is Ron Jeremy? Oh so is Randy West. Oh yeah

So is Harry Reams

[03:02:57.490 --> 03:03:02.990]
Obviously the guys don't have to look like anything. Why is that I don't know you tell me I don't know

[03:03:03.910 --> 03:03:06.970]
In game porn movies uh well there's plenty of ugly guys near too

[03:03:06.970 --> 03:03:09.850]
But generally speaking they're a lot better looking than only Peter North

[03:03:10.650 --> 03:03:12.290]
And for a while what that was his name

[03:03:13.250 --> 03:03:16.230]
The one that got real Tom um what the hell is his name

[03:03:17.590 --> 03:03:21.910]

[03:03:21.910 --> 03:03:25.790]

[03:03:27.070 --> 03:03:27.870]
successor successor

[03:03:29.450 --> 03:03:31.510]

[03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:58.170]
Here's Hollywood. Hello. No, no, yes, sir. Hey, I was just wondering if that was really an old guy or if that was a young guy trying to act like a lady

[03:03:58.170 --> 03:04:00.390]
It's a chronic illunite. He's a crazy person

[03:04:00.390 --> 03:04:04.930]
Hey, I know that's unusual in South Florida, but he just happens to be one of the odd ones

[03:04:05.190 --> 03:04:07.930]
I got a couple guys and speaking about the problem

[03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:13.290]
I got the same problem and bug the living crop out of me so to speak

[03:04:13.290 --> 03:04:18.590]
Man, I feel really I flush it and then you sit there and it's back at you. They're coming back

[03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:23.790]
And you know wait, I mean my bones go down the tube you know, but the toilet paper stays up at the top

[03:04:23.790 --> 03:04:29.450]
Oh, I see maybe or maybe one gets left and you got to wait a floater. There's nothing worse than a floater or two

[03:04:29.450 --> 03:04:32.730]
Yeah, I have but I think what's worse than that is

[03:04:32.730 --> 03:04:39.610]
When your uncle comes over and you know, you know, those people that they go to use the toilet and they miss they hit everything

[03:04:39.610 --> 03:04:42.490]
Okay, great. Well, I'll do that on Monday. Okay. I'm right in the middle of my lunch

I mean this guy wants to give me like a blow-by blow a play-by play of exactly, you know

[03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:50.710]
Like a basketball game. You know, like he missed the rim

[03:04:53.130 --> 03:04:54.150]

Which is a pretty sorry ass reason for programming on this radio stage to show the way he's manipulated these suckers on his place

[03:05:28.090 --> 03:05:29.790]
Boy oh boy man

[03:06:34.370 --> 03:06:38.430]
That's something because it doesn't require like an opinion. It doesn't require much controversy

[03:06:39.010 --> 03:06:43.470]
And that's fine. So what we're gonna do is make the near-roads your show the list of the day every day

[03:06:43.470 --> 03:06:45.490]

Where it's on k.t. Isn't it like I said

[03:06:57.490 --> 03:06:58.270]
Kits the cat

[03:07:00.250 --> 03:07:06.030]
They would they were bus boards and build and the bus benches catch the cat when I went there we actually had promotion on that station

[03:07:06.610 --> 03:07:12.710]
How do you like that on a on a station with a terrible signal that had nothing but old Jews on the beach listening and we still had promotion

[03:07:13.270 --> 03:07:18.150]
Well, it might encourage you to know yes that doesn't clearance around with whoever else looking at

[03:07:18.150 --> 03:07:20.230]
At the cactus oh

A billboard's I thought we were talking about something else trying to get clearance some action. Oh

He won't get any there either

[03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:30.210]
567 there we're gonna have some billboards folks

[03:07:30.210 --> 03:07:34.730]
We're tired of belly-hicken about defos got billboards and time smith the schnitt whatever his name is

[03:07:34.730 --> 03:07:39.230]
He's got billboards and everybody else has got him while 100's got footing in that other obnoxious guy with a phony

[03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:45.510]
Pupac on there everybody's got billboards. We're finally getting some nice going air Greg you will lie in sack of crap god

[03:07:48.470 --> 03:07:50.590]
So what do you say we're convinced of summer one

[03:07:51.170 --> 03:07:51.950]
Sure five

[03:07:52.470 --> 03:07:57.670]
I'm not asking you I'm asking the audience out there you're not saying sure you'd be you'd be crestfallen

[03:07:58.110 --> 03:08:02.150]
You'd be depressed. Yeah, you would you can make a light of it if you like

[03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:09.370]
I need the money everybody who does one talk show whether it's Ernie Sochi and whether it's Mike Spindell no matter who it is

[03:08:09.370 --> 03:08:15.230]
They do one show and right away it gets in their blood. It's like a disease. Oh, it's it is a sickness gets in your blood

[03:08:15.230 --> 03:08:18.010]
And you say oh, man, this is this is where it's out and of course

[03:08:18.010 --> 03:08:24.070]
I'm really shocked because doing it in this town on this station. I would think you'd say oh not again. I got the comparative

[03:08:25.550 --> 03:08:26.690]
What does it what does that mean?

[03:08:27.490 --> 03:08:32.630]
How about an SNM session with somebody with a spiked whip? How about comparing it to that? Let me get back to you

[03:08:32.630 --> 03:08:36.750]
Yeah, oh is Doreen back in here again? I

[03:08:36.750 --> 03:08:39.050]
Think that was Doreen. I think you're making up listen

[03:08:39.050 --> 03:08:43.770]
Don't be sure when you go to Treasur Island when George is there when the girl is going on Wednesday's a next through

[03:08:43.770 --> 03:08:46.710]
There's going to be she's the feature. I had Doreen. Yeah

[03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:49.450]
Doreen the pain king a queen

[03:08:50.590 --> 03:08:56.030]
Snow and Miami that's right Tom lemon and Joe Prieto are buried the fact we have said how that so many cars

[03:08:56.030 --> 03:09:01.570]
There's no place to park them even Tom lemon had to park cars in his driveway so they need to place one in yours your driveway

[03:09:01.570 --> 03:09:07.970]
That is you following that good how is blowing out all the new vehicles regardless of profit including the Pontiac vibes starting

[03:09:07.970 --> 03:09:16.450]
It only 13,998 and up to five thousand dollars off on every GMC on Boenstock plus get 0% financing or up to three thousand dollar rebate

[03:09:16.450 --> 03:09:21.390]
They got all kinds of fantastic pre-owned cars trucks and SUVs. By the way speaking to SUVs

[03:09:21.390 --> 03:09:24.610]
You know these ads they're running now with area and huffington all these crazy people

[03:09:25.450 --> 03:09:29.490]
The fact of the matter is if you're driving any car it's according to their logic

[03:09:30.050 --> 03:09:36.670]
If you're driving any car you're helping terrorism because it's going to the same company the same countries that are providing a good chunk of the oil

[03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:42.050]
So that's the most bogus the most fallacious pilot crap if you're driving a Volkswagen Beetle

[03:09:42.510 --> 03:09:45.310]
You're still having out terrorism if you believe they're both crap which we don't

[03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:49.510]
And if any other car dealer out there said hey know you're a deadbeat you're not gonna buy a car here

[03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:53.610]
Tom layman and the people in how it will cut you a deal amazingly enough even if you once worked in radio

[03:09:54.010 --> 03:09:58.410]
It's a winter blizzard emergency clearance sale going on right now at howl at Pontiac GMC

Watch your guy

[03:10:41.930 --> 03:10:43.070]
Where you're hiding

[03:10:44.170 --> 03:10:46.470]

Tell your home. Yes, you're done. We'll find your bones

[03:10:56.210 --> 03:10:58.110]
Just a little bit. Who say

Did

[03:11:06.590 --> 03:11:07.790]
can

[03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:27.010]
That's why we

[03:11:29.770 --> 03:11:33.650]
and all is explained to all in due time.

[03:11:33.910 --> 03:11:36.010]
Just a different, just a different, just a different,

[03:11:36.530 --> 03:11:38.090]
we know your line.

[03:11:38.590 --> 03:11:40.010]
Just a different, yeah.

[03:11:40.550 --> 03:11:41.830]
Just a different, yeah.

[03:11:42.050 --> 03:11:43.890]
I am this B.C.T.

[03:11:44.170 --> 03:11:45.790]
Your country is history.

[03:11:46.390 --> 03:11:48.230]
I am this B.C.T.

[03:11:48.490 --> 03:11:49.310]
Watch out!

[03:11:49.470 --> 03:11:50.430]
I Rockies!

[03:11:51.210 --> 03:11:54.430]
Okay, oh man, those always get me the ones that are in like real abrupt.

[03:11:55.230 --> 03:11:58.690]
So Lynn Samil is another email who says she doesn't like onions because they give her

[03:11:58.690 --> 03:11:59.310]
gas.

[03:12:00.010 --> 03:12:01.010]
That's what she said.

[03:12:02.010 --> 03:12:04.210]
Maybe eat a whole bunch of onions the next time you're going to produce one of those

[03:12:04.590 --> 03:12:05.730]
misogrujios, it'll be a good idea.

[03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:10.150]
And given the gas, if anybody I know deserves it.

[03:12:10.530 --> 03:12:12.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,

[03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:15.570]
pound 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:12:15.890 --> 03:12:16.710]
A magnificent lunch.

[03:12:16.970 --> 03:12:20.110]
But you're right, they pack in about 15 pounds of food in there and you're witness to the fact.

[03:12:20.490 --> 03:12:21.630]
And I know people are like,

[03:12:21.630 --> 03:12:23.610]
but I never, you know, because you're like me.

[03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:24.450]
Well, look at that all the time.

[03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:27.930]
Because they're trying to be nice to me, which I appreciate, but it was like the whole

[03:12:27.930 --> 03:12:28.450]
pig's look.

[03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:30.810]
Two thirds of it is in the in the can.

[03:12:31.930 --> 03:12:34.610]
Thanks again, no Hudson, away in a food was delicious, it's sensational.

[03:12:34.970 --> 03:12:35.830]
Win Arles Royal Castle.

[03:12:36.330 --> 03:12:37.810]
Speaking of people with marginal talent.

[03:12:38.970 --> 03:12:41.210]
British TV to Christina, cover up or go home.

[03:12:43.170 --> 03:12:44.350]
Do you see the story?

[03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:45.370]
Yeah, I heard about it.

[03:12:45.790 --> 03:12:50.330]
Christina Aguilar has been told by TV execs in the United Kingdom that she needs to tone it down or else.

[03:12:50.330 --> 03:12:52.770]
They must be talking about that latest video for her.

[03:12:53.050 --> 03:12:53.850]
What of them?

[03:12:54.230 --> 03:12:57.950]
What's that one called dirty down and dirty in the middle of the university?

[03:12:58.610 --> 03:12:59.670]
The dirty, dirty, dirty.

[03:13:01.410 --> 03:13:06.030]
The last time Aguilar appeared on a British TV, she caused quite a stir in her outfit, a bikini top,

[03:13:06.310 --> 03:13:10.050]
chaps and teeny tiny bottoms, with the word nasty across the cheeks.

[03:13:10.450 --> 03:13:12.350]
And believe me, she is nasty.

[03:13:13.350 --> 03:13:17.470]
According to reports, hundreds of viewers complained causing an investigation by the ITC,

[03:13:17.570 --> 03:13:19.350]
the British Independent Television Commission.

[03:13:19.350 --> 03:13:20.090]
Woo!

[03:13:21.090 --> 03:13:25.570]
We're always keen to have Christina on the show, but the skipping knickers and bottom have been banned.

[03:13:26.370 --> 03:13:28.290]
On other words, she was shown too much of her bum.

[03:13:28.990 --> 03:13:31.490]
Says the source at the show, CDUK.

[03:13:32.330 --> 03:13:35.330]
Her last performance caused such an upward that we cannot risk it happening again.

[03:13:35.690 --> 03:13:40.330]
A report by the ITC ads, this is a show aimed at children and dance routines that are overly sexual

[03:13:40.330 --> 03:13:42.310]
or too suggestive are not suitable.

[03:13:43.710 --> 03:13:46.910]
After being warned that she would be banned from appearing on any children shows in the UK,

[03:13:46.910 --> 03:13:50.870]
Aguilar showed up for the taping of her performance in black pants, shirt and white tie.

[03:13:51.330 --> 03:13:54.010]
She also dumped the bump and grind routine, sitting on a stool.

[03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:57.450]
She was sitting on some stool while performing your song impossible.

[03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:58.510]
They ever sit on stool.

[03:13:59.450 --> 03:14:03.390]
Set a CDUK spokesman, Christina's life performance got the program into a lot of trouble.

[03:14:03.710 --> 03:14:06.150]
We were relieved you turned up and more closed this time.

[03:14:06.430 --> 03:14:08.110]
Oh, those poor, constipated brits.

[03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:13.310]
Which I find amazing, because if you look on the British MTV,

[03:14:13.950 --> 03:14:17.030]
or any of the other Brit and other European MTV and music channels,

[03:14:17.490 --> 03:14:20.330]
there's more flesh on it than you'll see a treasure island on Aguilar to you that.

[03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:21.190]
Shocking.

[03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:25.550]
Maybe it was just her that they found obscene because it was her.

[03:14:26.970 --> 03:14:27.990]
I think they thought it was a kitty.

[03:14:28.170 --> 03:14:31.230]
I mean, she wasn't invited to the Buckingham Palace.

[03:14:32.310 --> 03:14:34.810]
But when they had all the hors d'oeuvres out there, she sucked up all the cheese,

[03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:36.410]
and they were pretty pissed off about that.

[03:14:37.650 --> 03:14:40.210]
Seriously, if you put a trap out with cheese, you'd have Christina,

[03:14:40.210 --> 03:14:43.070]
anybody out there watching Christina just put a little cheese right there at the door.

[03:14:43.110 --> 03:14:44.130]
She'll be there in 15 minutes.

[03:14:45.690 --> 03:14:46.530]
Here's Sunny Isles.

[03:14:46.590 --> 03:14:46.710]
Hello.

[03:14:47.490 --> 03:14:47.810]
Neil.

[03:14:48.030 --> 03:14:48.450]
Yes, sir.

[03:14:48.650 --> 03:14:50.390]
Hey, I got one for your list.

[03:14:50.750 --> 03:14:54.250]
Well, I actually got a couple for your list, but one, I don't know if anyone mentioned it.

[03:14:54.310 --> 03:14:56.930]
He's dead though, but what about John John Kennedy?

[03:14:58.090 --> 03:14:58.930]
Yeah, he would have been good.

[03:14:59.110 --> 03:14:59.690]
He would have been good.

[03:14:59.850 --> 03:15:01.090]
That would be definitive.

[03:15:01.270 --> 03:15:02.270]
Yes, if he were still alive.

[03:15:02.490 --> 03:15:05.210]
The other one is Ray Martinez and Wolfram Lurk.

[03:15:05.250 --> 03:15:05.650]
No, okay.

[03:15:06.750 --> 03:15:11.270]
5,6705,60,0505,60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[03:15:11.450 --> 03:15:12.150]
Isn't it sad?

[03:15:13.050 --> 03:15:13.770]
You're people.

[03:15:14.970 --> 03:15:17.470]
You're a little clack, little circle jerk.

[03:15:18.230 --> 03:15:18.610]
Sit around.

[03:15:20.230 --> 03:15:20.990]
Five years.

[03:15:21.110 --> 03:15:22.910]
Only started at this radio station.

[03:15:23.550 --> 03:15:24.590]
The curse of QAM.

[03:15:24.970 --> 03:15:27.050]
The curse that we have to bear on the show.

[03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:28.470]
The Cuban curse.

[03:15:30.350 --> 03:15:31.650]
Here's a call from Boca.

[03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.910]
Hello.

[03:15:33.450 --> 03:15:34.010]
Hello.

[03:15:34.250 --> 03:15:34.590]
Yes, sir.

[03:15:34.590 --> 03:15:36.870]
Yeah, I can't date for your poll.

[03:15:37.050 --> 03:15:39.590]
How about the esteemed Al Sharpton?

[03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:42.650]
Hmm.

[03:15:43.530 --> 03:15:43.750]
Okay.

[03:15:44.890 --> 03:15:45.370]
What?

[03:15:45.970 --> 03:15:46.510]
It's nothing.

[03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:47.850]
They're getting off topic.

[03:15:47.850 --> 03:15:49.470]
Yeah, they're getting off topic, okay?

[03:15:50.350 --> 03:15:53.030]
Generally speaking, politicians aren't supposed to have talent.

[03:15:54.110 --> 03:15:58.530]
Which I, you know, that would be a good out for the president because he is leading by million votes.

[03:15:58.890 --> 03:16:00.410]
But in his case, we'll make an exception.

[03:16:00.650 --> 03:16:01.890]
He's a talented blowhard.

[03:16:03.470 --> 03:16:04.190]
Al Sharpton.

[03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:06.650]
He got to where he is under his own steam.

[03:16:07.610 --> 03:16:09.490]
Well, and so unlike the president.

[03:16:09.510 --> 03:16:09.910]
Oh, I see.

[03:16:10.110 --> 03:16:13.530]
It was just, I was eating and having like a bunch of rich relatives who propped him up.

[03:16:13.650 --> 03:16:15.550]
I made all kinds of shady business deals.

[03:16:15.710 --> 03:16:17.290]
Like with a baseball team on the world company.

[03:16:18.050 --> 03:16:18.570]
Five, I see.

[03:16:18.770 --> 03:16:21.710]
Five, six, seven, oh, for all in a bad news is Al Sharpton says he's running too.

[03:16:22.110 --> 03:16:22.510]
You see that?

[03:16:23.450 --> 03:16:24.790]
Oh, he's going to get off a winded.

[03:16:25.690 --> 03:16:26.290]
No, he is.

[03:16:26.670 --> 03:16:27.550]
He'd be running, man.

[03:16:28.390 --> 03:16:29.450]
I'm studying to say that every time.

[03:16:29.450 --> 03:16:30.430]
The curse of the Democrats.

[03:16:30.990 --> 03:16:32.730]
If it's not Jesse, it's Al Sharpton.

[03:16:32.890 --> 03:16:33.570]
He's running as a Democrat.

[03:16:35.230 --> 03:16:38.590]
He's running as a dark, complex Ojampra Vakertour is what he's running as.

[03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:41.070]
He said, I just want to be me.

[03:16:41.790 --> 03:16:42.430]
Here's Pompano.

[03:16:42.510 --> 03:16:42.710]
Hello.

[03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:43.790]
Hey, Neil.

[03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:44.410]
Happy and healthy.

[03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:45.250]
And same to you.

[03:16:45.690 --> 03:16:46.790]
I have one for your poll.

[03:16:47.410 --> 03:16:49.150]
The infamous Sylvester Stallone.

[03:16:49.410 --> 03:16:49.870]
He's on air.

[03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:51.010]
Oh, okay.

[03:16:51.130 --> 03:16:52.370]
Well, unfortunately I didn't hear that.

[03:16:52.490 --> 03:16:52.650]
Sorry.

[03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:55.210]
And if George was girl, he'd be all right.

[03:16:55.790 --> 03:16:56.490]
Yeah, girl, period.

[03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:58.210]
George, you'd be a lot better if he had some balls.

[03:16:58.770 --> 03:16:59.870]
I'm trying to have a good one.

[03:17:00.030 --> 03:17:00.290]
Thanks.

[03:17:00.490 --> 03:17:01.770]
He's got a good point, I got what?

[03:17:02.190 --> 03:17:03.010]
I'm germinating some.

[03:17:03.310 --> 03:17:03.830]
No, you're not.

[03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:08.710]
Because he's afraid for his job after he's once most started trying to get his ass canned.

[03:17:08.950 --> 03:17:10.870]
Well, not everybody has an ironclad contract, you know.

[03:17:11.010 --> 03:17:11.770]
Well, you do now.

[03:17:11.990 --> 03:17:12.610]
We hear it's coming.

[03:17:13.190 --> 03:17:14.330]
It's still that ironclad.

[03:17:14.490 --> 03:17:14.950]
It's in the thing.

[03:17:15.250 --> 03:17:20.350]
The red coming there just yesterday when a really good mood all of a sudden after I bitched in Mondeu a muff.

[03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:24.210]
It's still going to say about the average way the gray treats us here on his show.

[03:17:24.210 --> 03:17:30.470]
He's a piece of crap and a lion sack and Greg comes in here yesterday afternoon again long after I'm gone when the coast is clear, of course.

[03:17:31.930 --> 03:17:32.910]
You mark my words.

[03:17:33.070 --> 03:17:34.070]
I'm going to hide my car.

[03:17:34.170 --> 03:17:38.530]
I'm going to go down here one day, park my car over at cemetery village next door that place that are parking lot.

[03:17:38.530 --> 03:17:40.130]
And I'm going to sneak back in here again.

[03:17:40.790 --> 03:17:42.610]
And I'm going to sit right in that corner in there.

[03:17:43.170 --> 03:17:45.310]
And wait for him to come in here and start in with you.

[03:17:45.570 --> 03:17:46.210]
Sit and jump out and go.

[03:17:46.370 --> 03:17:46.630]
Go, go, go.

[03:17:46.770 --> 03:17:47.250]
I will.

[03:17:47.850 --> 03:17:50.830]
I'm going to open that door up fast and say, hey, Greg, you're full of it.

[03:17:53.450 --> 03:17:54.250]
Instant death.

[03:17:54.450 --> 03:17:55.450]
His heart will stop.

[03:17:57.710 --> 03:18:03.710]
So anyway, he was in there yesterday, given you a song to dance and sucking up and we got the billboards coming up and your contract is just about done.

[03:18:03.850 --> 03:18:05.330]
Well, what do you say about your contract?

[03:18:05.810 --> 03:18:06.730]
It's just about done.

[03:18:07.390 --> 03:18:09.110]
I don't think he said you're just about done.

[03:18:09.190 --> 03:18:09.830]
Yeah, I think you misunderstood.

[03:18:10.310 --> 03:18:11.430]
There's going to be a clause in there.

[03:18:11.850 --> 03:18:14.470]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60.

[03:18:14.530 --> 03:18:16.750]
So what do you think Rick and suds is coming summer or what?

[03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:18.110]
The filling on the show.

[03:18:18.650 --> 03:18:19.750]
Carlos says, eh.

[03:18:19.750 --> 03:18:20.910]
Well, what do you care?

[03:18:21.250 --> 03:18:21.850]
Well, that's right.

[03:18:21.910 --> 03:18:23.070]
If it's Rick and suds, he'd be in there.

[03:18:23.590 --> 03:18:24.890]
But if it's him, you're in there.

[03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:29.250]
Well, you don't think I'm going to sabotage the show if I'm in here?

[03:18:29.470 --> 03:18:30.870]
I think I threw away lunch too soon.

[03:18:30.950 --> 03:18:32.850]
You know what would be in bad taste if I went back into garbage?

[03:18:34.410 --> 03:18:35.570]
Have you ever done that?

[03:18:36.250 --> 03:18:37.330]
It's sealed up in the sealed box.

[03:18:37.510 --> 03:18:39.190]
Oh, yeah, it's in a sealed container here.

[03:18:39.330 --> 03:18:39.530]
Right.

[03:18:39.770 --> 03:18:41.030]
It didn't touch that really bad.

[03:18:41.210 --> 03:18:42.050]
I mean, nothing got in there.

[03:18:42.210 --> 03:18:42.810]
That's the rule.

[03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:44.090]
If it touches something else, it's just...

[03:18:44.090 --> 03:18:44.910]
See, I want the onion.

[03:18:45.090 --> 03:18:45.930]
Now, there is no more onions.

[03:18:46.030 --> 03:18:46.450]
It's bacon.

[03:18:47.010 --> 03:18:47.290]
Oh, here.

[03:18:47.290 --> 03:18:48.650]
Here's some onions hiding under the bacon.

[03:18:49.170 --> 03:18:49.330]
Mmm.

[03:18:49.750 --> 03:18:50.610]
That's the piss off, Carl.

[03:18:51.310 --> 03:18:53.690]
Look at how he came to look at it.

[03:18:54.390 --> 03:18:56.110]
How can anybody not like onions?

[03:18:56.910 --> 03:18:57.630]
Or chocolate?

[03:18:58.290 --> 03:18:58.990]
No, but I'm not...

[03:18:58.990 --> 03:19:00.090]
We're not eating chocolate right now.

[03:19:00.190 --> 03:19:01.250]
Chocolate is... will kill me.

[03:19:01.710 --> 03:19:02.650]
But onions are good for me.

[03:19:02.710 --> 03:19:03.430]
It's on these scackens.

[03:19:04.410 --> 03:19:05.030]
Throw it in.

[03:19:06.030 --> 03:19:06.430]
Mmm.

[03:19:07.450 --> 03:19:07.730]
Man.

[03:19:08.650 --> 03:19:10.230]
You see that fire breath and breath?

[03:19:11.270 --> 03:19:12.810]
How about getting some garlic in here too?

[03:19:13.830 --> 03:19:14.410]
Don't you love garlic?

[03:19:15.410 --> 03:19:16.570]
You're driving him out of here.

[03:19:16.570 --> 03:19:17.750]
You know how garlic?

[03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:19.390]
I'm not an asshole, man.

[03:19:20.230 --> 03:19:20.530]
God.

[03:19:23.650 --> 03:19:24.570]
What do you like?

[03:19:24.730 --> 03:19:25.150]
What do you eat?

[03:19:25.390 --> 03:19:26.550]
Oh, but I don't want to hear the answer.

[03:19:28.130 --> 03:19:31.470]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 8.

[03:19:31.690 --> 03:19:32.290]
Buy a carlos.

[03:19:32.730 --> 03:19:34.070]
Have a nice culinary weekend.

[03:19:34.990 --> 03:19:36.490]
Thanks for the great job as usual.

[03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:40.930]
Did you tell him when he started here that I would be the most...

[03:19:40.930 --> 03:19:42.530]
Besides the money, the most...

[03:19:42.530 --> 03:19:44.090]
He'd get most abuse, besides money.

[03:19:44.350 --> 03:19:46.550]
I told him for like a year that all he would ever do.

[03:19:46.550 --> 03:19:48.290]
He would get his abuse and he wanted to hear anyway.

[03:19:48.510 --> 03:19:49.270]
Well, he deserves it.

[03:19:49.610 --> 03:19:50.850]
Here's your best Palm Beach, hello.

[03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:51.790]
Hi, dear.

[03:19:51.990 --> 03:19:52.390]
Yes, sir.

[03:19:52.970 --> 03:19:53.730]
Hi, I got someone.

[03:19:53.950 --> 03:19:54.970]
I mean, you'll have to make an exception.

[03:19:54.970 --> 03:19:55.990]
What about Jeb?

[03:19:58.090 --> 03:19:58.970]
Yeah, you're right.

[03:19:59.110 --> 03:19:59.550]
But he's not an idiot, though.

[03:19:59.910 --> 03:20:00.930]
He's not an idiot.

[03:20:01.130 --> 03:20:01.530]
Wait, wait.

[03:20:01.710 --> 03:20:04.350]
When the idiot is not the pole, the pole didn't say it was the biggest idiot.

[03:20:04.350 --> 03:20:05.910]
We said least talented and most excited.

[03:20:06.810 --> 03:20:07.730]
That's how we got there.

[03:20:07.870 --> 03:20:08.190]
He's what?

[03:20:08.790 --> 03:20:09.070]
He's...

[03:20:09.770 --> 03:20:10.390]
He's lucky.

[03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.410]
What do you think?

[03:20:11.410 --> 03:20:12.530]
I think he said he's lucky.

[03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.230]
Yeah.

[03:20:14.270 --> 03:20:15.870]
He didn't say what you thought he was.

[03:20:15.870 --> 03:20:17.670]
Well, you're out your way off.

[03:20:17.810 --> 03:20:20.630]
Since Rick Riley called, I want the audience to know that since Rick Riley's called,

[03:20:20.990 --> 03:20:22.070]
George has been losing it.

[03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:23.310]
Losing it.

[03:20:24.390 --> 03:20:27.530]
Because he's so paranoid and nervous that we're going to have Rick and Sudden.

[03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:29.610]
There's one thing you should keep in mind.

[03:20:30.150 --> 03:20:32.830]
If Rick and Sudden are going to come here and fill in, what are they going to want?

[03:20:33.150 --> 03:20:33.350]
Money.

[03:20:33.510 --> 03:20:33.730]
Yeah.

[03:20:34.310 --> 03:20:35.170]
Does that settle out?

[03:20:35.270 --> 03:20:35.710]
No, I know.

[03:20:35.890 --> 03:20:36.110]
Okay.

[03:20:37.390 --> 03:20:38.870]
That takes you to that problem.

[03:20:40.510 --> 03:20:41.470]
Maybe they'll trade it out.

[03:20:41.970 --> 03:20:43.250]
Here's a call from Fort Lauderdale.

[03:20:43.330 --> 03:20:43.510]
Hello.

[03:20:44.050 --> 03:20:44.450]
Yes.

[03:20:45.150 --> 03:20:45.910]
Yes, sir.

[03:20:46.590 --> 03:20:48.250]
I'd like to nominate the king.

[03:20:49.770 --> 03:20:50.250]
Larry King.

[03:20:50.750 --> 03:20:51.410]
He's already on there.

[03:20:51.730 --> 03:20:52.090]
I'm sorry.

[03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:53.730]
He's got 35 votes you'll be pleased to know.

[03:20:53.890 --> 03:20:54.170]
Okay.

[03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:55.730]
He's in fourth place.

[03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:57.050]
Put your votes in for me.

[03:20:57.370 --> 03:20:58.070]
Long me 50 dollars.

[03:20:58.210 --> 03:20:58.850]
Okay, thank you.

[03:20:59.490 --> 03:21:00.970]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

[03:21:01.150 --> 03:21:04.590]
I better read the results again because we have people tuning in all the time.

[03:21:04.770 --> 03:21:07.990]
Who's the luckiest person on the face of the earth most success least talent?

[03:21:08.350 --> 03:21:10.830]
President George W. Bush is winning hands down your pants.

[03:21:11.510 --> 03:21:12.250]
261 votes.

[03:21:12.330 --> 03:21:13.010]
Nobody's even close.

[03:21:13.010 --> 03:21:18.270]
But, and in a call, Smith who was a late addition got 123 over the weekend since this

[03:21:18.270 --> 03:21:20.870]
pull, the up there all weekend long, she might give them a run for his money.

[03:21:21.750 --> 03:21:22.470]
Oprah 73.

[03:21:23.090 --> 03:21:24.230]
Larry King 35.

[03:21:24.410 --> 03:21:24.850]
Call me fast.

[03:21:25.010 --> 03:21:25.610]
You just said that.

[03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:26.410]
Eminem 32.

[03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:27.950]
Rosio Donald 24.

[03:21:28.410 --> 03:21:29.150]
Bill Gates 20.

[03:21:30.030 --> 03:21:30.990]
Van a white 19.

[03:21:31.410 --> 03:21:33.090]
Jerry Springer and Regis Philbottie each have 12.

[03:21:33.430 --> 03:21:34.010]
Slides to loan.

[03:21:34.130 --> 03:21:35.250]
Barbara Walters each have nine.

[03:21:36.190 --> 03:21:37.110]
Bruce Springsteen with eight.

[03:21:37.270 --> 03:21:37.870]
Madonna's got eight.

[03:21:38.150 --> 03:21:39.070]
Tom Broca's got five.

[03:21:39.370 --> 03:21:40.170]
Murf Griffin's got a pair.

[03:21:40.330 --> 03:21:41.350]
Pamela Lee's got a big pair.

[03:21:41.350 --> 03:21:43.730]
Martha Stewart two and Wayne Newton still only one.

[03:21:44.390 --> 03:21:45.750]
Aren't you surprised about that?

[03:21:46.030 --> 03:21:47.410]
Maybe the audience likes Wayne Newton.

[03:21:48.190 --> 03:21:50.730]
Or they just don't think he's in the same league with his other one.

[03:21:50.750 --> 03:21:54.070]
He's not in the same league with president.

[03:21:54.350 --> 03:21:54.730]
He's not?

[03:21:55.010 --> 03:21:55.210]
No.

[03:21:56.030 --> 03:21:57.270]
Like not with that in the call.

[03:21:58.270 --> 03:22:00.370]
I guarantee he's made a lot more money than any call.

[03:22:00.550 --> 03:22:02.950]
I'm not talking about how much he inherited in some old Coots will, huh?

[03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:04.850]
How many songs did she write?

[03:22:05.890 --> 03:22:06.630]
What did he write?

[03:22:06.910 --> 03:22:07.290]
Duncan Shane.

[03:22:07.470 --> 03:22:07.910]
He wrote that?

[03:22:08.070 --> 03:22:08.870]
Yeah, he wrote that.

[03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:09.290]
No.

[03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:11.150]
I read a, there was a saw.

[03:22:11.310 --> 03:22:12.730]
I'm going home and voting for him then.

[03:22:14.470 --> 03:22:17.390]
14, 14 to one at five sixty Q.A.M.

[03:22:17.530 --> 03:22:18.850]
Hey Wayne, Duncan Shane.

[03:22:19.090 --> 03:22:20.730]
Slide in local.

[03:22:21.290 --> 03:22:23.870]
Here's sports video five sixty Q.A.M.

[03:22:26.750 --> 03:22:28.690]
Friday you bastard.

[03:22:30.450 --> 03:22:31.270]
I'm going home.

[03:22:31.270 --> 03:22:31.630]
I'm going home.

[03:22:36.930 --> 03:22:37.690]
I'm going home.

[03:22:37.690 --> 03:22:39.650]
I'm going home.

[03:22:39.710 --> 03:22:40.090]
I'm going home.

[03:22:40.770 --> 03:22:41.170]
I'm going home.

[03:22:41.730 --> 03:22:42.770]
I'm going home.

[03:22:43.030 --> 03:22:43.150]
I'm going home.

[03:22:43.330 --> 03:22:44.270]
I'm going home.

[03:22:45.210 --> 03:22:45.970]
I'm going home.

[03:22:45.970 --> 03:22:45.970]

[03:22:46.330 --> 03:22:47.010]
I'm going home.

[03:22:47.010 --> 03:22:48.930]
I'm going home.

[03:22:48.990 --> 03:22:50.050]
I'm going home.

[03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:51.490]
I'm going home.

[03:22:55.890 --> 03:22:57.690]
I'm going home.

[03:22:57.790 --> 03:23:03.690]
I'm going home.

[03:23:08.390 --> 03:23:12.110]
I'm going home.

[03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:24.790]
Get more and think I heard sound.

[03:23:24.790 --> 03:23:27.610]
Now there ain't no more again

[03:23:29.350 --> 03:23:32.810]
Though I would not feel the most full

[03:23:32.810 --> 03:23:33.410]
Now

[03:23:33.410 --> 03:23:36.510]
And I would not be ashamed

[03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:40.730]
About a ginger and bogey union

[03:23:40.730 --> 03:23:44.610]
Just bold and then stroken away

[03:23:46.090 --> 03:23:49.030]
Boy, baby, kill me you're not my type

[03:23:49.950 --> 03:23:53.110]
Just sound like a nine year old kid

[03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:57.030]
Only a macho-meldigite

[03:23:57.030 --> 03:23:58.250]
You don't know this

[03:23:58.250 --> 03:24:02.030]
That makes me flip my wig

[03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:04.870]
If ginger was a lover of mine

[03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:08.990]
If I bury my bull this feigny nose

[03:24:10.030 --> 03:24:12.710]
Inside his pimply rear end

[03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:17.870]
Though I would not be a sport old

[03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:18.290]
Now

[03:24:18.290 --> 03:24:21.290]
If I was not the closet face

[03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:25.390]
That's why a ginger and bogey union

[03:24:25.390 --> 03:24:29.350]
Would make me feel to be a gay

[03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:32.130]
Everybody follow my thousand balls

[03:24:32.130 --> 03:24:35.250]
Yeah, a ginger and bogey union

[03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:39.130]
Would make my sorrows only as kill safe

[03:24:39.870 --> 03:24:43.150]
If we had a ginger and bogey union

[03:24:43.870 --> 03:24:46.510]
Then he wouldn't have to get me raped

[03:24:46.510 --> 03:24:48.190]
To 1250xH1 at 560

[03:24:48.190 --> 03:24:49.410]
That's number one with four bullets

[03:24:50.390 --> 03:24:51.130]
By the way

[03:24:53.330 --> 03:24:54.570]
Here's a call from Boker

[03:24:56.090 --> 03:24:56.570]
Meal

[03:24:58.730 --> 03:25:00.690]
And back to you

[03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:04.650]
I think he's a Screamer

[03:25:04.650 --> 03:25:05.170]
He doesn't sing

[03:25:05.170 --> 03:25:06.310]
He just shouts and screams

[03:25:06.310 --> 03:25:08.270]
I don't think he can sing

[03:25:08.270 --> 03:25:09.450]
For a paper bag

[03:25:09.450 --> 03:25:14.510]
He has a great voice

[03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:21.270]
Tell what he's got a what kind of a voice no, I said he doesn't have a great boy, but he's a great guitarist and he's a great lyric writer

[03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:26.090]
He's talking about Bruce Springsteen. They're George's puke

[03:25:27.050 --> 03:25:30.690]
Well, he's right blinded by the light. Mm-hmm like I said

[03:25:31.950 --> 03:25:36.650]
I'll pass even though his version of it sucked. Hey, he sucks. He just sucks. That's all

[03:25:36.650 --> 03:25:38.930]
Bruce I mean if you like a lot of screaming and pugen

[03:25:41.470 --> 03:25:43.410]
Great good luck to you. Okay Bruce you suck

[03:25:44.650 --> 03:25:47.870]
He's the kind of guy that people want to get stoned out of their minds and go to a concert

[03:25:47.870 --> 03:25:52.130]
They'll go and see regardless of what the music is. Do you want to follow what I'm saying like Jeff Cohen

[03:25:52.850 --> 03:25:57.650]
He went to see springsteen he goes to see anybody because it's a good excuse to get just just absolutely

[03:25:58.330 --> 03:26:01.410]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on a

[03:26:01.970 --> 03:26:04.250]
AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[03:26:04.950 --> 03:26:07.210]
Here's for a lottery. Oh, hello

[03:26:07.210 --> 03:26:12.010]
Deal. Yes, sir. Hey, I got a name to ask your list the first what it works for you

[03:26:12.010 --> 03:26:17.010]
I can only eat onions when they're cooked. I can't eat them at all on their raw. Yeah, well when they're raw they're like you know

[03:26:17.010 --> 03:26:20.710]
It's a required taste, but I don't mind it when they're raw as long as you don't go overboard

[03:26:21.210 --> 03:26:25.670]
Yeah, I can't eat them at all in their raw but you give them to me when they're cooked same with mushrooms and only them cooked

[03:26:25.670 --> 03:26:29.910]
Oh, yeah, I agree with that. I don't like raw mushrooms. Move. Yeah, look. It's like a fun guy

[03:26:29.910 --> 03:26:32.410]
You get you get exactly you feel like you're eating toad stools

[03:26:33.190 --> 03:26:38.090]
Anyway, here's the guy that I have been saying for years, but I think it's a man. I can't say toad stools

[03:26:38.670 --> 03:26:40.330]
Go ahead. I'm sorry. I can't say to

[03:26:41.090 --> 03:26:43.510]
Pretty good. In a long time, but in some others anyway

[03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:47.970]
The guy who I think is gotta be the luckiest guy in the world. It's gotta be Tom Arles

[03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:53.430]
Okay, yes, somebody else said that. I mean, he was a nobody. He married somebody famous now

[03:26:53.430 --> 03:26:56.950]
She's no longer around and he's still doing the movies all over TV

[03:26:57.930 --> 03:27:00.010]
Ah, just close me away. Okay, we'll put him on her

[03:27:00.690 --> 03:27:06.310]
I'll have a good day. Now let's put Tom Arnold on there. What do you say, Eric? No, yes, we're putting Tom Arnold on there. You know who else?

[03:27:07.270 --> 03:27:08.270]
Oh Drew Kerry

[03:27:11.070 --> 03:27:16.050]
What I forgot all about it you agree. I saw a stand-up routine and it was funny, but that was like 20 years ago

[03:27:16.050 --> 03:27:20.450]
Oh, well, I'm sorry if he's got a little bit of talent and let's not knock him. Let's not knock a fat goofy guy

[03:27:20.450 --> 03:27:25.590]
I guess he's making money. I don't know why I will find him even mildly. I mean you don't want to put Tom Arnold on there

[03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:30.090]
I just feel sorry for him because he had to put up with that for I don't know days wait a minute

[03:27:30.090 --> 03:27:32.870]
He had to put up with it. How about if he chose to put up with it?

[03:27:33.430 --> 03:27:38.290]
All right, that's a good point. He chose to put up with it. You know, he's a mediocre actor. I mean he's not like

[03:27:39.190 --> 03:27:43.150]
Atrocious or anything. He just Tom Arnold. Tom Arnold. He just shows up. Does his lines?

[03:27:44.070 --> 03:27:47.070]
That's spectacular or anything like put Tom Arnold on a list right away, Eric

[03:27:49.430 --> 03:27:52.790]
5670560 pounds like I said Rick and Sajas are certain sound real attractive

[03:27:53.850 --> 03:27:54.810]
Lake Park. Hello

[03:27:56.550 --> 03:27:57.210]
Lake Park

[03:27:57.910 --> 03:28:02.810]
Hello, Neil. How you doing? Long time first time. Yes, sir. Happy new year to you. Ah, you're talking about people

[03:28:02.810 --> 03:28:06.290]
How about your buddy that pedals all that flea market stuff Ron Popeel

[03:28:07.310 --> 03:28:13.190]
There's pasta machine and all like you think Ron Popeel doesn't have talent to be able to sell that crap to the public and make millions and dollars

[03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:15.730]
You got to be kidding man. Well, true. He paints his balls ball

[03:28:15.730 --> 03:28:21.150]
Now that was the best if you can sell although obviously you notice how well what a brief period of time that was on

[03:28:21.550 --> 03:28:27.750]
But if you can sell guys on spray and a hair out of a can you must have some kind of talent remember that the Ron Popeel

[03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:30.810]
Spray here and then of course he walk out and will be raining and

[03:28:31.330 --> 03:28:33.130]
And he there he looked like

[03:28:34.010 --> 03:28:34.730]
Al Jolson

[03:28:35.970 --> 03:28:39.030]
GLA look like he'd be doing his info commercial in blackface

[03:28:39.690 --> 03:28:42.730]
Like push paint your balls fuck because that's what the guy said

[03:28:43.130 --> 03:28:46.530]
But you weren't listening because you were huckin' a trinic 5670560

[03:28:46.530 --> 03:28:51.490]
Pine 568080 and Verizon line. I'd say this way in our old man. This guy's good

[03:28:52.370 --> 03:28:55.390]
He really has a good look at that. It's the new

[03:28:55.390 --> 03:28:59.250]
It still looks bad to me. It's the beast. Oh, that's only from the neck up

[03:28:59.250 --> 03:29:02.070]
Now see you know what you should do you should grow some hair

[03:29:03.270 --> 03:29:04.370]
What are you laughing about?

[03:29:06.230 --> 03:29:08.730]
Don't you think if he had here in fact listen

[03:29:10.130 --> 03:29:12.350]
Maybe you could borrow the one from Luis Miguel over there

[03:29:12.850 --> 03:29:16.910]
Wouldn't you would he be lovely with a muskrat on or what that's him

[03:29:18.070 --> 03:29:20.170]
The beast with a muskrat hairdo

[03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:24.170]
It's right over there on Luis Miguel's out there for head there

[03:29:24.950 --> 03:29:27.450]
Just lift that baby on and let's take a look

[03:29:29.670 --> 03:29:30.750]
Oh, is that Daniel

[03:29:33.790 --> 03:29:35.050]
It's Daniel Goon

[03:29:35.910 --> 03:29:39.370]
Man oh man if that isn't the beast or what it's too small for his fat head

[03:29:39.370 --> 03:29:41.770]
He's got the fatest head of anybody ever seen my enemy

[03:29:42.410 --> 03:29:47.770]
We got some that aren't all sealed up. Yeah, it's trying to find one that'll fit like a size 42 cap

[03:29:49.630 --> 03:29:53.490]
Here's Fort Lauderdale, huh? Hey Neil. Yes sir. Scott Mitchell and Ron Jeremy

[03:29:54.830 --> 03:29:58.210]
Yeah, those two guys are pretty lucky. I think I've ever seen the two of them together

[03:29:58.210 --> 03:30:02.910]
No, I think Scott Mitchell. What do you have one good quarter and they got like a 20 million dollar?

[03:30:02.970 --> 03:30:06.190]
Yeah, the interesting part of that is I've met both of them nothing I'm bragging about it

[03:30:06.190 --> 03:30:09.130]
But the Elle Goldstein brought slept around Jeremy in here that one day

[03:30:09.130 --> 03:30:10.830]
And then once when I was doing that awful

[03:30:11.590 --> 03:30:14.430]
Informershaw for Kendall Toyota. Yeah, remember those days

[03:30:14.850 --> 03:30:17.810]
Scott Mitchell was the guest on the other segment of the show so I met him too

[03:30:17.810 --> 03:30:23.630]
What a nice guy but like a big farmer kind of and they paid him 11 million dollars that year and they said well go away

[03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:26.030]
Yeah, he became a think a thirsty quarter back

[03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.430]
Exactly

[03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:32.870]
And you know what she could put in there the writer for the Sun set and a flabnic or something like that

[03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:38.710]
The guy has not made a one complete sentence if you ever read his stuff on the front page there. Okay

[03:30:39.230 --> 03:30:42.910]
Quit while you're ahead. Yeah, I think that's slobnic or whatever's name is

[03:30:44.270 --> 03:30:49.310]
See the question is who is the luckiest person on the face of the earth most success least talent

[03:30:49.310 --> 03:30:52.270]
I don't think oh the beast says that's me most success

[03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:57.770]
Now do you want it we got a couple of minutes here? Do you want to tell us if the real story the inside story about getting canned up at that morning show

[03:30:58.890 --> 03:31:00.410]
And where do you get your information

[03:31:02.890 --> 03:31:06.230]
Why see this is a good pair we got George and the beast in the other room together now man

[03:31:06.810 --> 03:31:11.770]
The pussy factory's just oozing for the guy said what do you mean what have I held back

[03:31:12.530 --> 03:31:16.850]
Oh come on are you kidding? It's something um, it's easy to say okay. We've only got three minutes left

[03:31:16.850 --> 03:31:20.110]
Yeah, you can't go a whole show over ten more seconds. Okay

[03:31:21.210 --> 03:31:23.630]
How about all the times in Toronto when you be playing that

[03:31:24.190 --> 03:31:30.030]
That the well because the inquisition was in progress. Oh, I see so nothing by it now that the inquisition is over with

[03:31:30.030 --> 03:31:32.690]
Let's wait till you get that contract sign. Okay, that's good. Oh

[03:31:33.490 --> 03:31:38.390]
Say see what I mean toxic good game. Oh, yeah, good point. It nothing. I won't say it

[03:31:38.390 --> 03:31:43.270]
I said it during the case of the beast. What's he got to lose here? Oh, that's right. It's keen stuff. Oh nice game by the way

[03:31:43.270 --> 03:31:47.790]
I don't mean your performance because I didn't hear it great game beast

[03:31:48.710 --> 03:31:50.810]
And don't be beliacin about a bad call list

[03:31:50.810 --> 03:31:54.490]
We got through it because the fact of the matter is they should have won by about 40 points. Oh, how does state blows?

[03:31:54.850 --> 03:31:56.430]
They're really like uh, they're not very good

[03:31:57.550 --> 03:32:02.630]
Yeah, they're not very good. They're not very good. You want to see what a kick their ass or you can me?

[03:32:02.870 --> 03:32:07.730]
Do you debate that? You want to see what a kick either one of those teams asked right out there to mop the field up with them

[03:32:07.730 --> 03:32:10.650]
The way they play that night. I'm talking about if they would have played the way they did

[03:32:10.650 --> 03:32:12.890]
Oh, I was state birding out by Cincinnati

[03:32:13.890 --> 03:32:16.910]
See you think that you're looking at some schmuck. We don't know what he's talking about. Okay

[03:32:16.910 --> 03:32:17.010]
I

[03:32:18.130 --> 03:32:22.370]
Know my sports better than some of these assholes in this building. Oh, I talk a big game the jets to me

[03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:23.530]
We don't know anything

[03:32:24.930 --> 03:32:27.890]
Except how to make people's lives miserable. I don't want to get too specific

[03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:31.390]
Or fool or really good right now

[03:32:31.390 --> 03:32:37.790]
man, well, I'm finishing up. I'm finishing up. I did I did reach back in a waste basket. That's bad

[03:32:38.230 --> 03:32:39.190]
No, it is bad

[03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:43.570]
But it's so good is such a shame to waste in fact if I know the beast was coming and we could have given some

[03:32:44.250 --> 03:32:48.970]
Atkins now are you getting the sack again or what? We're back on the sack

[03:32:51.890 --> 03:32:56.490]
