[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]
I make them off again with you.

[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.320]
He's an asshole

[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:48.600]
They're nostrils

[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.960]
He's an asshole

[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.480]
He's party party party

[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.800]
Boop and burst and said it up in the sleep

[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.480]
We timed and so the music had the drum on the beat

[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.220]
Everyone around me here is wearing a brand

[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.940]
The thing is that it's real funny when someone's freaking with

[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:16.460]
Oh

[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.200]
I just

[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.640]
I

[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.400]
was bringing here's my eyes

[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.280]
Holding grab just some party

[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.640]
Party party

[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.080]
Party party party

[00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.320]
I don't do it five sixty w.w. Kim Boy. It's a pressure pack Wednesday

[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.780]
I'll take it that I'm speaking of the pressure we were just hearing about I didn't realize we had so many heavy duty things going on

[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.020]
You know what but we did

[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.660]
But Clarence was in whose plan programmed I mean who's our program director

[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.520]
Now that month is a way of vacation this week

[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.500]
In fact, you hear what he said about duck he's an asshole I couldn't believe the things clearance was blurtin out this morning

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.720]
I guess he's a pent up you know because he can't get late

[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.200]
So we've got all this pen of frustration so we want to play butch boss now

[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.440]
I'll take it one thing all these rumors about Ferrell on the radio

[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.460]
He will be on at seven o'clock tonight by the way if he never heard Scott Ferrell he talks like this

[00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.280]
And I will say this much I give him credit for being able to talk like that more than five seconds

[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.920]
I can't do that but that supposedly his natural voice

[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.940]
I heard now people that have scranty voices like Lauren McCall right as a woman with a scranty voice

[00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.060]
Generally they say people develop real scranty voices over the years from too much smoking and too much

[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.060]
Boosing is the I just mentioned it. I'm not assuming you think I'm huh? Yes, that's what they say

[00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.940]
No, people always say yeah, but anyway

[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.160]
Yes, got for all to the Atlanta hockey games there for one season and they kind of like booted a mod of town on a rail

[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:56.060]
But he'll be on seven o'clock tonight and the rumor that we're seeing and hearing it's just amazing because Clarence almost verified it for us this morning

[00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.080]
He came within a little curly hair of

[00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.020]
Verifying the very Jackass rumor and of course any time does a very Jackass rumor?

[00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.780]
You know it was planted in the column because very is so tight with our good buddy. Yeah

[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.840]
So you know that's where it because that's who we quote in the our little blurb there

[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.980]
By the way, thanks very much

[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.600]
We already got the blurb from the hero which Clarence

[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.240]
Clarence Darrow facts to me this morning before he went running out of the studio and hit under his desk

[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.520]
You should have bit him on the arm. You know he might have got off on

[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.080]
Very Jackass writes

[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.460]
Forheld all and before we get to that

[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.560]
So yesterday at one o'clock shows over and I'm just about to walk out of here and go off to a nice lunch and

[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.080]
Here comes another facts that you forward to me morons play it again

[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.960]
Sam was never uttered in Casablanca now then we discussed that that wasn't the exact line we did

[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.320]
But but forgetting about that morons. Okay. Well, thank you so much

[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.540]
They get hostile even about something as important as the lines from movie

[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.940]
Which it was our poor yesterday and you'll be amazed by the way that I'm gonna be able to squeeze the movie pool for at least one more day

[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.260]
I got a good one the audience will be shocked and maybe dismayed by that

[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.980]
But it is Wednesday anyway. We got a big noon to one comedy of bits our every Wednesday. Thank God for that. Yeah. Thank the Lord

[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.760]
Let's see here's the facts before I get into these Scott for real thing because it's a sports thing and most of our audience

[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:18.300]
Don't give a flying crap about that anyway and we want to I noticed the most given him that big welcome on board

[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.280]
But a lot of cost the comments in there about the

[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.860]
Gregory the Gregory line about we'd like to add more humor to the morning show

[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.620]
Just when Mo and Gildey seem to make you bait making a little bit of it in road had a better book there to win a book

[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.240]
Of course we helped him a lot, but nonetheless

[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.620]
And all of a sudden we're gonna start dealing with it some more see I'm thinking to myself

[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.980]
What a great blending of voices that will be you know

[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.640]
You got Mo with his centaurion a bombastic voice and then you got tell me with a squeaky voice and a

[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.020]
Like that for well. Can you imagine that blending of voices to wake up to in the morning like a symphony?

[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.020]
I told clearance would probably be a lot cheaper just to get a cassette tape of

[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.320]
fingernails scratching on a blackboard and

[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.780]
Stick that in there in kind of place of a guilty and for real and just have the fingernails with Mo

[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.580]
You know, it's kind of like background sound

[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.320]
Anyway before we get into that thing you know, it's how I keep postponing the inevitable. No, that's called a teaser

[00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.100]
It's worth teasing it. That's what we're doing

[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.440]
Somewhere in there there on one of those mini-discs which you can't find there's some a play by play by for well

[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.900]
The money was doing Atlanta hockey games and if he's lucky you won't find it

[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.200]
I mean

[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.780]
Nadine factors this morning and says as usual you'll you were right on the button Ray a Requiem for Dream

[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.980]
Although we also have that other facts kind of caustic the one where he the guy gives me

[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.260]
We got who wants to date with you. What I do with it? Yeah, he wants to date Kevin and Hollywood wants to date with George

[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.300]
Faggot I mean I'm Kevin too

[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:45.220]
As usually right on a button with the Requiem for Dream says Nadine it should be requiring for most people all ages especially those who are

[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.280]
additive prone so who's not?

[00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.420]
Wow, that was possibly the most powerful unsettling movie and artsy movie. I've seen needed a Zana sure

[00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:00.780]
I was speaking a Zanax on then rather last night and then on wheel of fortune which follows on some channels like here

[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.620]
There must have been 75 spots for our prescription drugs on there. Yeah, they had planets

[00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:13.800]
Which I'm taking they had a prevesit and they had like a air be goddamn drug that talk about the drugging of America

[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:19.200]
So I think everybody should be watching Requiem for a dream also Nadine says smallville sure had it last night

[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.100]
Four stars from me and endeared me more to Clark and family

[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.360]
She says the episode covered a lot maybe too much cover for Tom Wellinger, which was our rated well

[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.640]
I'll be got to see was like a little kiss, you know

[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.880]
Well kiss in the beginning a kiss and again, maybe a little tongue in there

[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.560]
Now he does tell Lex Luthor that he went for it last night

[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.400]
You know what which usually when a guy says to his buddy I went for last night

[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.100]
We usually know what that means but in his case since we never even saw like a little peck on a cheek

[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.780]
Maybe that's Clark's idea of going for it if he cares my grip. He's a little packer. Yeah

[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.460]
Anyway, Nadine says I was down in Bokka for the mother's day weekend the brief visit reinforces why I'm a new Jersey

[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.520]
However, I love seeing the ocean well guess what Nadine there parts a new Jersey many parts where he can see the ocean

[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.260]
But you can almost smell it

[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.200]
Okay, thanks Nadine, but Kevin and Hollywood has a more

[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.060]
He's got one of these dictatorial faxes. He did one thing. I don't cut into real well

[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:14.600]
And that is people in the audience who tell me or tell us what we ought to think what we ought to say and give us like

[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.920]
Marching orders. We got enough of that from Washington now. We don't need that from the audience

[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.560]
Kevin and Hollywood who needs to butcher up several nights is oh and also before we even get into Kevin

[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.760]
I told you we had a full plate. No, seriously

[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.260]
We got to talk about the new sales guy Raymond. He's an asshole. Yeah, make your asshole

[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.680]
Speak at a dictatorial people Raymond. I don't even know who the hell you are

[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.180]
Maybe I met him once when I was down there. I'm not really sure because the salespeople are it's like a revolving door

[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.460]
So I don't even know who this putts is but he's already had one major

[00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.440]
Compton Thompson with Tommy in a hallway Tommy told him basically

[00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.100]
Nice god Tommy. You're okay. My book is always you've much better language than that though

[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.800]
Yeah, and the seramen comes in there what they was it yesterday yesterday

[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.960]
And given venerable instructions about how he's being bring in a client and so be on your best behavior

[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.980]
Yeah, be on your best behavior is as if first of all do we have any idea who Raymond even is?

[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.340]
No, the guy's been he's been in a building about five minutes and now we know be on a shadow without he'll fit in perfect with our sales department because he's an asshole right

[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.260]
So Raymond cut the crap. Okay, the last thing we did is another dictatorial sales guy running around giving orders

[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:21.820]
We already got too many chiefs and not enough Indians in that joint. We got 50,000 chiefs and no Indians

[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.320]
Everybody's got a goddamn title. Yeah, he's already got a mommy Raymond. So could be an asshole. Okay, and quick

[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:34.320]
Coming in there with the people that we don't even know who the LAR trying to impress your clients you idiot you scumbag you

[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.520]
Do we know who he is?

[00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:36.340]
who

[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:40.060]
Anyway, here's the thanks from Kevin who wants to date with you George

[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.300]
Says Neil. I think you're a terrific radio personality

[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:49.880]
But if you and George are gonna discuss film you need to at least in big capital letters at least take out a subscription to

[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:54.400]
Entertainment weekly both of you have such limited knowledge about movies. You don't do them justice

[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.840]
However, you hate Bush and fundamentalist anything so you're totally forgiven

[00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.240]
See again, we auto at least take out her

[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.440]
I don't want to take out a subscription to anything when I'm doing is watching a lot more movies and I admit

[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.360]
Unlike what Tom jickel would say. I'm an expert on nothing except times you can be in a jerk

[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.860]
So that makes it more fun it seems to me because we can soak on the audience's knowledge from all the different people

[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:19.460]
If anybody comes on here and pretends to be the expert. Where is the room for discussion?

[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.360]
Right and then he says keep promoting Dean

[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.880]
Exclamation point first of all. I'm not promoting Howard Dean

[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.760]
I've never seen a man once in my life. I saw about 10 seconds of the clip from the debate

[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.060]
So what the hell do I know from a Howard Dean except that I read a couple articles about him

[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:38.920]
I'm not promoting anybody except anybody against them then PS here's the real here's what you need to know about this

[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:45.180]
Facts from Kevin Hollywood PS is George cute. He sounds like he might be no, no, no, he's not cute

[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.440]
He's not gay and he's not to anybody you want to touch with anybody else's hand

[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.540]
Okay, Kevin

[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.000]
All of he would be delighted to send you a blow up dog

[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.640]
He could send me a subscription to entertain it weekly

[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.380]
He could send you a prescription to entertain it with like a centenary prescription for Xanax or maybe for Viagra

[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:07.580]
We had 1200 plus votes on a podium today pretty impressive when you consider we took that first pole of 448 votes

[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.760]
I believe on Clinton and Bush

[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.160]
Clinton won that one hands down by the way. They is state of the America

[00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:17.280]
Like 85 to 15 percent thought America was much better off under Bubba than under W

[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.440]
Under this fascist regime we have a Washington right now the bunch of goose stepping Nazis

[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:27.500]
But at any rate the most memorable line ever from a movie which is why I started to show it at this morning

[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.740]
I don't have time to dittle with all these

[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.400]
It'll be I want to make them an offering

[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.040]
103 votes it moved in the first place and pulled away from I'll be back from the Terminator with 94

[00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:39.860]
I'll just read a few of these okay

[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:45.600]
What we have here is a favor to communicate cool hand Luke 77 say hello to my little friend Scarface 63

[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.540]
Go ahead make my day dirty. Here you're 57 frankly my dear. I don't give a damn gone with the win 55 the best line ever from a movie

[00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.600]
I love the smell of napalm in a morning from apocalypse now 54 you can't handle the truth from a few good men 48

[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:07.080]
You talking to me taxi driver 47 may the force be with you star wars 46 I bet you a clearance like that one

[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.220]
I'll look for him's probably like candy shackle out better

[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.580]
Fat drunken stupid is no way to go through life of animal house 42 leave the gun

[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.820]
That this uh did a lot better than in the beginning probably because I boosted up there a little bit

[00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:20.480]
leaves it good

[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.400]
Take it only

[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.540]
Had 39 and last but not least of the ones I'm gonna read

[00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:35.380]
36 I lied played again Sam from kezoblaka 34 even though he didn't really say more on yeah

[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:39.360]
I want my cigarettes miss ratchet and i'm angry mall

[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.380]
Guess what the head seven which would have had a lot more if I wouldn't have waited to the end of the show to have it pop in my mind

[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:47.180]
Have you checked the children from one of stranger calls had seven votes

[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:53.620]
That was a chilling line have you checked I don't know how many people saw that movie at least seven I guess

[00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.600]
We all saw right right I saw Venus it

[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:58.180]
He was on the phone

[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.860]
It means on the phone he's on the phone with what calls ordering lunch

[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:05.380]
What do you mean taking calls from a home from my fair honor?

[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:09.300]
I don't know how we need to inject more humor in a morning show and he'll probably be starting on Monday with Mo and guilty

[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.700]
What a combination of voices that's gonna be

[00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:17.280]
Man I can just hit and of course don't be blaming clearance or muff. It's obviously a Greg deal okay

[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.740]
Greg read once again continuing to dittle and dittle and dittle

[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.680]
We're just finally starting to make a little bit of progress

[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:27.520]
Mo is finally starting to like warm up a little bit about a degree and a half where's that his hair piece at any

[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:28.620]
It's just a little tiny bit

[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.380]
But no just never stop screwing around with a guy damn line up screwing around with life

[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:39.720]

[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.820]
Readers choice neo-rodger so there you go

[00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.300]
Something for all of us even a nice comment about the Humper in here too

[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:02.060]
So it's basically a suck Q.A. M. uh thing in there which we appreciate very much we like it and suck by the immediate or anybody else

[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.340]

[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.720]
Talking on a sports show

China to be my show

[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.300]
Your voice sounds just like a 7 year old girl

[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.060]
A little sports whole show

[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.440]
What else are you there for

[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:34.400]
Delvie

[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:35.860]
Delvie

[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.000]
Talking like a baby

[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.860]
Who needs a little training

[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:43.960]
Why can't you understand

[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.000]
You don't sound like a man

[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.960]
We move the rubber bands

[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.120]
That show

[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.900]

[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.360]
Delvie

[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.740]
Your lucky management tells me

[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.500]
Cause Kelly

[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.660]
You don't feel long there on the head

[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.360]
And Kelly

[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.300]
The sports can wait till your voice cracks

[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:20.760]
Cause anyone who sounds like that should find another job

[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:26.420]
And they should only chase you back when both your babies drop

[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.620]
Delvie

[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.520]
Delvie

[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.880]
When you don't grow up

[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.800]
You make them want to grow up

[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.620]
You feel these sweet people

[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:40.720]
Go to work at big school

[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:43.500]
Your great new bass and voice

[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:47.620]
Makes you sound like a butt

[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:48.160]
Here

[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.520]
You're a butt

[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.360]
Uh huh

[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.220]
You're a butt

[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.360]
919 advice

[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]
This year W.2

[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:57.460]
But they have a lot of these programming changes

[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.420]
Come up on the station

[00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:00.060]
We'll tell you how to get some feedback on it

[00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.760]
Hopefully surprise when Scott Florella goes on 7 o'clock tonight

[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.580]
If his first collar is wine mic

[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.560]
My my my

[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:06.980]
Yeah

[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.940]
Cause I'm thinking about Gildy's voice

[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.860]
He sounds like about

[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.320]
On the ear

[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.700]
Yeah

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:12.460]
Yeah about 9

[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.880]
Then he's like a little kid

[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:14.960]
Oh I see H

[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:15.900]
Yeah

[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.280]
I'm not talking about inches

[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.440]
Although that's the room around the building

[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.600]
But at any rate in Scott Florella course

[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:20.840]
You know

[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.640]
Get in gravely really annoying voice

[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.900]
Like that

[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.540]
Although that does fit in with soft Florida

[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.060]
Because that's our motto in soft Florida

[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.900]
Is that we hate you

[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.640]
No matter what it is

[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:30.480]
Like that

[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.360]
So maybe he'll like be the voice of the community

[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.100]
So very jackass right

[00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:36.760]
And of course it comes right from Greg's mouth

[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.240]
Everytime anything is in very jackass

[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.580]
They don't even have a uh

[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.060]
They don't call each other on a phone

[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.140]
They have like a two way

[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:44.840]
Right like a next tell

[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.040]
Right exactly

[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.380]
They have one of those intercom things

[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.680]
So that can be an instant communication anywhere in the world

[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.080]
For well joins WQM in part time position

[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.760]
Former nationally syndicated host Scott

[00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.760]
Florella is joining QAM is a part time talk show

[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:00.500]
And management said it could lead to a full time position

[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.860]
Says very jackass

[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.740]
WQM general manager Greg Reid said he's considered using florella

[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.260]
Howard David's morning show

[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.900]
Whose ratings have improved recently

[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:11.380]
But Reid said nothing is imminent

[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.660]
We would like to add more humor to the morning show Reid said

[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.980]
For all 37 hosted an national radio show for Westwood one

[00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:20.540]
Between 95 and 99

[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.860]
The program was broadcast in more than 110 stations

[00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.280]
His first WQM shift will be at 7 o'clock tonight

[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:26.080]
How do you like that?

[00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:29.360]
Right on the box right on the hot and the hot plate

[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.980]
How to how come my phone is real

[00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.940]
That must be a package must be delivered downstairs

[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:34.580]
Right

[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.640]
Phone's really another one you think it can be important

[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.680]
Like poke a bride

[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.260]
Better go get it

[00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:38.880]
I'm just kidding

[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.980]
So anyway thanks again to new times to the another

[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.980]
That's screw new times

[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.060]
Like I said thanks to the readers of new times

[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.360]
For picking me as the best day in host

[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:47.640]
But they just stay you know

[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.580]
They mix in matches what they do

[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.420]
Little this little that

[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.280]
So the mad dog gets their pick because the readers pick me

[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.660]
And then best FM radio personalities

[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.640]
This is interesting

[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.160]
Paul Castronovo and young Ron Brewer

[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.240]
Because I know George is a big fan of their show

[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.940]
Absolutely is that the readers pick are theirs

[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:08.840]
No that's their pick

[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.100]
The readers choices a tie between Kenny and Fuddy and Wawin 100

[00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.120]
And Castronovo and young Ron

[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:14.960]
That's a tie

[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.560]
Where's Howard in all of that Howard sperm

[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:20.040]
That's a good point

[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.080]
Yeah I don't see him

[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.180]
Well I guess since he did this

[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:23.500]
Turn to the right

[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.600]
Maybe that has something to do with it

[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.060]
So there's the radio buzz

[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.460]
Let's think about calls because we got to get the pull on for today

[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:31.360]
We got to build it and shape it and form it

[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.500]
And the poll too

[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.340]
Here's Miami hello

[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:34.640]
Neil

[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.420]
Yes sir

[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:35.960]
Good morning

[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:37.040]
Good to see you

[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.320]
I've been listening for many many years

[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.320]
And I enjoy your show

[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.280]
But I have noticed one thing and it's not a critique

[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:46.540]
But I already got two butts in there

[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.820]
You seem to always want to trash a lot of people

[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:52.320]
I wanted to ask the question

[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.760]
Why not

[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.240]
Well but I mean whatever

[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.960]
But let me say that let me say this to you

[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.460]
I trash people I deem deserving of trashing

[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.100]
People who I think are good people

[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:03.200]
I'll be more unhappy to give them kudos and I do it all the time

[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:03.840]
That's fun

[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.220]
My question is

[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.980]
Why are you such an angry man

[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.860]
And why are you going to die lonely

[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.120]
First of all it's not an angry man

[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.460]
And secondly I'm not going to die lonely

[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.500]
What what does that mean

[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.040]
And then thirdly I'm so touched that you're so concerned about me

[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.260]
I owe Carlos a dollar

[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.120]
Yeah

[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.900]
Because that was the George Hader guy he usually rips me

[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.040]
Oh I see so now today he's to ripping me

[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.080]
I'm not angry and it's a radio show asshole

[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:28.820]
And you're an asshole

[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.380]
They did use it in a different voice today though

[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:32.760]
Right out of the box

[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:35.620]
That's why I'm an angry man because of assholes like you sir

[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:38.320]
My life is beautiful other than assholes like you

[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.340]
Who have nothing to say

[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.580]
Here's a call from Boka

[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.120]
Hello

[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.180]
Hey Neil how you doing

[00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.100]
That was probably Kevin and Hollywood once the date was yours

[00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:44.560]
Yes sir

[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.720]
I'm not ripping anybody

[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:46.920]
Well why not

[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.240]
Well I just got back from Amsterdam

[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:50.760]
All right

[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:51.420]
All right

[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:52.100]
How was it

[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.480]
It was great except that with the Euro exchange rate

[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:56.860]
I got 82 cents

[00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.140]
Yes

[00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:58.320]
That was great

[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.160]
Your cents for a dollar

[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.100]
Is that unbelievable the Canadian dollar which was 62 cents last year is 72

[00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.280]
And now it's the Euro is a buck 16

[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.720]
They get 56 cents the Canadian

[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.460]
Oh

[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:09.340]
Unbelievable

[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:10.520]
Anyway I got a funny story

[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.840]
You know that club paradise

[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:12.920]
No

[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.800]
It's it's just like a

[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.640]
A swing type club over there

[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.980]
And a guy and two women

[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.900]
Walk into the place and their cows

[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:24.140]
Just sitting and watching around like tourists and turns out they were Irish tourists

[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.900]
Who wanted to go dancing at the paradeza dance club

[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:27.720]
I see

[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:32.000]
Shocked their lives when they were given towels and pulled the strip when entering the club

[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:32.360]
Oh

[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:34.820]
But they were good sports and they laughed about it

[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.120]
I hope they used to my wrist spring

[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.460]
I hope so

[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.000]
Anyway it's good to be back but

[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:46.740]
I'm just telling everybody that if you get an Amsterdam expect to get beat on the dollar pretty bad

[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.460]
So is it their crowd are there?

[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:49.440]
No not at all

[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.660]
Not at all

[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.820]
I've been there six times and I'd say the least amount of people I've ever seen

[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.400]
Really

[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.960]
Really

[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.300]
People aren't traveling

[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.620]
I breathed through customs there wasn't

[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:03.300]
You know there's like 15 lines that Miami Airport

[00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:03.840]
Yeah

[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:04.900]
Not one line had

[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:05.740]
Oh not one

[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.820]
Customs officer had a line

[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.640]
Just one right through customs

[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.320]
Wow

[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:12.920]
Is it nobody's traveling?

[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:13.780]
Hmm

[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:15.920]
But

[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:19.600]
Anyway it's good to be back and good to hear you again

[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.260]
Okay thanks

[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.380]
I tried to pull you up over there on the internet but I couldn't get you

[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.020]
Couldn't pull me an Amsterdam

[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:25.480]
Yeah

[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.040]
I've been pulled an Amsterdam before

[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.620]
Okay I'm glad you're back pal I have a great thing

[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.800]
See I don't understand that because I could always hear it over there

[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.640]
First I was right over the uh thing

[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.760]
Well speaking of Amsterdam

[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.700]
Chong's bonds landed in the hot water

[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.760]
Tommy Chong and actor and comedian best known for teaching Chong movies

[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.800]
Since we've been movie intensive pleaded guilty of violating federal drug

[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.100]
Perfinity losses part of a federal crackdown

[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.920]
On the sales of water pipes and miniature scales reports Bloomberg news

[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.540]
Uh-huh

[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.540]
It makes you want to cry you know what

[00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:56.140]
Yeah

[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.720]
We've got people getting blown up all over the world

[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:04.020]
We've got every kind of lunatic terrorist group out there just waiting to do our ass

[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:07.260]
And they're worried about miniature scales and water pipes

[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.540]
The actors Chong Glass Company offered

[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.420]
and sold thousands of marijuana pipes with Chong's picture through its website

[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.200]
The US Justice Department said the company manufactured and distributed the products from its garden in California headquarters

[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.680]
In February the Justice Department announced similar charges against 55 people and companies

[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:27.380]
The arrest and seizures target a paraphernalia market that reaps as much as a billion dollars annual sales prosecutor said

[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:31.580]
Prosecutors said Chong invested more than 290 grand in his family's perfinity of business

[00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:37.980]
Nice dreams enterprises under the plea agreement Chong agreed to forfeit the Chong Glass.com domain name

[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.680]
All items of perfinity the US seized and any proceeds of the business

[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:48.260]
When he sentenced in Pittsburgh in September he faces as many as five years in prison and a quarter of a million dollar fine

[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:54.280]
Chong and his partner cheat Miran tried to family late 70s early 80s with a series of movies involving drug use

[00:22:54.280 --> 00:23:00.640]
And creative marijuana smuggling including up and smoke still smoking and nice dreams. Oh my god

[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.340]

I'm on a tune yet. Oh Kelly. He's known for his seductive style his suggested lyrics and for having relations with underage girls

[00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:39.140]
Which means now all of his songs are inappropriate. That's why jailbait records presents our Kelly's greatest inappropriate hits with inappropriate tunes like

Available wherever records still owners have no school for whatsoever

[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.580]
I'm pretty one to five sixty w. Qm here's a lady in somewhere in the Tampa. Hello

[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.340]
I know love you show. Thank you. Um, I have a question for you

[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.960]
I've been dating a scat for a little while and we're getting ready to consummate a relationship. Uh-huh

[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.460]
And he's on the circumcised so that I think differently. Yeah, don't possess

[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.180]
Okay, now speaking of that the hot couples contest tomorrow

[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.820]
And the little bit strange away the show is starting today. Have you noticed?

[00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.360]
Just a little bit on the strain side

[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:18.620]
Anyway, the hot couples contest deadline for your pictures is tomorrow Thursday May 15

[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:22.940]
I just mentioned that in passing because uh, uh, it kind of slowed down to a crawl. We got about a dozen

[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.720]
Doesn't that prince which is fine

[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.580]
But the point being that uh, what was your name's Aaron and Amy?

[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.120]
Right that everybody was ubleing and arguing getting all whipped up into a frenzy about Aaron and Amy

[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:38.300]
But the problem is they sent pictures separate and we're a little bit uh that ain't gonna count

[00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:46.040]
Because again the rules of the contest people can log on to our website nearrangers.com email a picture of themselves with their significant other

[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.420]
Not like separately not from some of photo shoot in a model magazine

[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.440]
But like with their significant other and of course if you don't do that you would don't qualify

[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.920]
And of our will be the deadline by 9 a.m. By the start of the show tomorrow's the deadline

[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:02.020]
Then we'll put the pictures up on our website for a week and next Thursday May 22

[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:07.140]
Couple of the most votes wins three days and two nights at uh for two at the Royal Oasis resort and casino in the Bahamas

[00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:11.580]
With round trip airfare on Lake or air and runner up kids dinner for two with the prestigious pizza loft

[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.480]
Aren't you a little bit suspicious about that whole ideal yes? I have

[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:21.060]
I mean anybody can take pictures out of a model now out of a fashion magazine and send in pictures of models

[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.380]
Hey, that's uh, that's me and then uh, you know

[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.580]
So we're just just matching that and passing plus of course if we pride them enough, maybe we'll get some more pictures

[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.240]
Now yesterday we thought out that JFK had a 19 year old mistress

[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.880]
Right an intern little uh mistress a little twinkie

[00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:42.120]
Thank God that we didn't have Miss Grudge and her blue dress back in those days in the Ted Olson and the Kenny star, you know

[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:49.240]
Now we got a new book that says JFK snorted cocaine with actor Peter Lawford they were snorting it

[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:56.200]
All the two stated Frank Sinatra's Palm Springs House in late 50s according to an excerpt from a tell-all book written by Sinatra's former valet

[00:27:57.580 --> 00:28:02.440]
Writing about the close friendship between Sinatra and future US president George Jacob said all of the

[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.020]
Ratpacks singing to a Kennedy's weakness for women and went so far through range liaisons for him

[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.680]
He would not have approved of his drug use

[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.680]
In the next episode from his forthcoming book Mr. S released in the June edition of Playboy Jacob said he was present on several occasions in Palm Springs

[00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.060]
When Peter Lawford and the future president did lines of cocaine together

[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.300]
It lawfords guestrooms

[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:29.500]
The first time it happened Jack must have seen the shock look on my face for my back George Kennedy said to me with his bad boy

[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.400]
Wink Jacob's wrote ending at lawford pleaded with them not to tell Sinatra

[00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:37.180]
Any audio? Yeah, where'd you go on to go on get that book right away? Won't you? No? Yes

[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.820]
And of course we know what S stands for

[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.060]
tonight tonight's a big night 10 o'clock on iFC independent film channel

[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.020]
Requiem for a dream. Where's that music?

[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.360]
Hello Sarah when you're gonna be on television Sarah Sarah Goldfarb. She's one of our favorites

[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.420]
She is the definitive soft-loaded junkie man perfect for us

[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:01.100]
10 o'clock tonight independent film channel if you don't have it

[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.860]
Get somebody else who does have it to tape it for you. That's your homework assignment

[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.640]
Here's our poll question today and we get around it with sooner or later

[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:10.560]
After these two stimulating calls that I took already

[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:15.320]
And let me ask you this how did you know who the first caller was when you're not the one answering the calls

[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.000]
Carlos was winking at me

[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.540]
I really well. I think that could mean something else

[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.340]
Maybe he's jealous over the guy in Hollywood that we're Kevin or whatever the guy's name was wanted to date

[00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:24.140]
Yeah

[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.940]
Because that's what clearance whisper to when you want to have to take a dump this morning

[00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.720]
Came in and said he's kind of wants to stand online too

[00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.820]
In fact clearance he'll stand online for anybody anything that's warm

[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.520]
Even like one of those things you put in the toaster there's little pop tarts

[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:43.640]
He'll he'll stand in line for one of those if he could just like kind of rub up against it. He'd enjoy it

[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.540]
Here's our poll question today. Who is your favorite?

[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:50.180]
Let me say it again do it where I can't even read my own damn poll

[00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:54.940]
Who is your all-time favorite character from the movies now this again as usual

[00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.140]
We'll take a little bit of explaining because the audience is a little

[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.120]
In case you haven't noticed over the years

[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:05.020]
Now who's your favorite actor we've done that or actress we've done that not who's what's your favorite movie?

[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:10.420]
We've done that not what your favorite lines are who is your favorite all-time character from the movies

[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.100]
Which doesn't require you in other words when we put it on the pool

[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:14.900]
We're not gonna put the actor actors

[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.420]
We're not gonna put the name of the movie because if you don't know the who the character is then obviously wouldn't know anyway

[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:20.240]
Right right

[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.760]
So I've got a short list

[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.240]
Howard Beale

How about John Wilkes Booth and Shirley Booth

[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.020]
So that's our short list with a Howard Beale Cyril Goldfarb Don Coyoney

[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.560]
Michael Coyoney Santino and Frank Booth

[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:55.880]
What are you faxing me this stuff cable I already I already sent this to you and you're sending it back to me

[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.640]
I'm supposed to be a cable provider to run ad critical a bush

[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:03.000]
I fasted it to you this morning. Okay, I thought it was a different one. I thought it was a more up-to-date way

[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.720]
Kevin believe me you don't want to date George okay, all of he is kind of desperate

[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:16.360]
I hear some facts that says I know this maybe bit likely had to write this as my facts software free trail periods about to run on

[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:20.780]
That goes you and the boys have the most entertaining and provocative show out there. Yes, we do

[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:25.600]
Anyway, some poor ideas. Well, I'll put that aside. I thought it was like something crucial

[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.040]
And then we got another piece of crap. Well, I take it a fax machine is humming

[00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.380]
The phone is starting to smoke a little bit

[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.380]
We had those two idiotic calls to get a start. What more could you want you? We got for real on the radio

[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:37.920]
He's gonna be on seven o'clock tonight

[00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.440]
We got the new times loves of me and the mad dog and the Humper as well

[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.920]
Well, everybody on a goddamn station gives us a nice suck job in the new times. Thank you so much

[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.340]
What what more can you want?

[00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:52.020]
I mean, of course in you guys in your case probably some money

[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.780]
But they can't afford to pay you guys any money because I'm taking all the big bucks

[00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:01.020]
Join George Booker Brian Beena Boy and Super Slacker McGellus have noon and they need to do this because of the fact

[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:06.060]
They're not making a big bucks five to seven for happy hour at Treasure Island located off the Palmetto

[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.000]
Just north of the 120 second street exit this week's feature is the super soaker

[00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:11.900]
Stephanie Evans

[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:17.320]
Scott fighter check her out enjoyed drink specials and win some prizes five to seven of Treasure Island. What did you drop in that?

[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:17.980]
I didn't hear it all

[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:23.580]
Scored squirt. Oh from five to seven of Treasure Island. He just can't control himself. Can he be an avoid

[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:29.680]
Just just like the people of insane cackling and dominating and dropping in all kinds of drop it

[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.460]
Yesterday, I'm doing a thing about the movie. He hasn't even seen yet

[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:38.420]
He's dropping that in when he doesn't even know the guy the movie the sent by a woman or whatever the hell was

[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:44.300]
You know what he said sent by a woman who horrible movie don't waste your time seeing it

[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.800]
So last night George was gonna watch the game right excellent movie

[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:50.980]
With the Michael Douglas in though I realized I already thought

[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.460]
Didn't see it though because of the fact it was storming and the power went out and it was like the end of the world

[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:01.660]
It's sunny and beautiful today here in Toronto. I should point out. It's a beautiful day. Gonna be 61 today 60ish

[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:03.520]
Nice crisp in the air

[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.740]
Not a cloud in the sky

[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:07.620]
And

[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:12.400]
And out of the room around here is that it's either 95 in a shade or it's raining and thundering and lightning and

[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.360]
No park and a real mess is what I'm here

[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:21.840]
So I'll stay here and I'm sure the people are saying all right. They're happy about that except the course for that first guy who wants to date with me

[00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:22.680]
I

[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.300]
City

[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:35.580]
Exit just tell me what your problem is. I'm sorry Mrs. Captain. I'm experiencing a mood

[00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:41.160]
Mrs. Bowel you're needed on the bridge Mrs. Spark is under attack by her um, you know

[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:53.940]
Like your boy that girl Mrs. Captain keep your hands to yourself mr. Oh, but report to my quarters in 15 minutes

[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.420]
Missoula chart of course for first and third

[00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.840]
Oh, why is the star trying coming to appear here you

[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.500]
Be up the aim of representative is a study was your eyes

[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:12.140]
I'm 44 560 wq. I am swimming with somebody says Darth Vader. That was the inspiration. I played that yeah

[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:18.120]
As if I need an excuse that was kind of cute that won the villain pole when I took it by the way Darth Vader yeah

[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.880]
What we do anyway? What do you mean a one the villain pull as opposed to like Dracula and Frankenstein and stuff like that Darth Vader?

[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.200]
Yeah, that's a generation thing. That's very unfortunate and anyway

[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:33.140]
Our P. Mc Murphy from once a little bit of cook is nested is a great choice. These are on a facts machine

[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:38.160]
I've already taken the liberty to and these because it's my show and Charlie Chan is a good choice

[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.860]
Don't you think Charlie Chan sure never saw a movie but yeah, you didn't never saw Charlie Chan movie

[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:48.700]
Well, why not? How not you tell me well? There's something out your list right after the first 600

[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:52.020]
Because George never got to see the game all he realizes after seeing the beginning

[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.420]
He already seen it a zillion years ago on cable right

[00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:01.540]
But then the power went out for hours and hours and hours. What a shame for a month. What a sad sad thing

[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:03.860]
By the way, Scott for all door unpack. Okay, sweetheart

[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.020]
He'll hate it in about five minutes especially after they call in the rip of an ass on here. He's probably used to that

[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.640]
Let's give that the gravity sounds cut

[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:17.240]
See I'm not gonna like jump all over him because I don't know he may be a really good guy. I'll love George said otherwise

[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.680]
Of course you're doing the same thing with him. He did with Moe. You know, you're poisoning the ear right?

[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.400]
Didn't you say all kinds of crap about him this morning? Well one in particular

[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:29.980]
And you have you met Scott for real? No, see there. There you go

[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:34.040]
Doesn't even know although I will say Scott. I got a little advice before you start tonight

[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.740]
Take off those checkered pants. Yeah, because otherwise you know

[00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:40.380]
You'd lump them with that bokeh crowd like Moe and that's not a good way to get started

[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.580]
Take off those checkered pants. Yeah, okay calm down Mo

[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.940]
Calm down and of course Moe you can just imagine his hyperventilating

[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:51.300]
He's probably driving about 400 miles an hour and his way back home up to a bokeh because you ask whole

[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:56.860]
Because all his countertops about how they have to may add Scott for all of the morning show to inject some humor in there

[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.980]
And of course, you know what happens once they slide somebody in like that then eventually

[00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:05.000]
Not too much further down the road. They slide somebody else out if you catch my drug

[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.900]
You know I'm getting that down what do you mean by that?

[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.800]
So maybe that's why they were like praying for that wonder book to be like a real bomb

[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.960]
And then the most shocked them all by throwing a good number in there nice going mo

[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.300]
Nice going in fact

[00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:17.640]
I think we're gonna start taking his side just to piss off Greg

[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.440]
Don't you think that's good? I want to get even with Greg for all the tourists. He's laid on us

[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:24.020]
It's quite of the great numbers we've given him for five years plus

[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.660]
And how little they've done in return other than my check how little they've done in return as in nothing

[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:33.380]
Yep, I love it a clock will put the uphole up there beener

[00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:37.020]
I'm just mentioning that for beener and uh Eric so they can get their signals together

[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:42.360]
Your all-time favorite character from the movies Howard Beale, silver gold farm

[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.260]
Don Corleone, Michael Corleone, sunny Corleone

[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:50.720]
Frank Booth, Charlie Chan, RP McPerphy and Darth Vader. This is gonna be great

[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:57.580]
This is an interesting start to list keep in mind separate in your mind the actor the actress the movie all of these things from the character

[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:00.220]
This is this is probably the toughest of them all when you say

[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:05.400]
No, you don't think so well not for you. It wasn't now because you voted for Frank Booth

[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:10.820]
But I voted for Howard Beale and I really would like to have voted for uh the gone Corleone

[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.500]
I mean how can you not love down Corleone?

[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:21.680]
See right and I do love him and I love grow up but uh Howard Beale there is only one Howard Beale

[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.120]
5670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line

It's enough about uh Cheat all about Chong man

[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.260]
I mean you're right, but it's enough to make you cry in that it's all it is it's pathetic

[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:50.360]
I mean and it's like yeah, I mean just go to show me there's nothing to stop these uh fascists who are in this country man

[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:55.840]
Not to not just that country, but now they're even twisting the Canadians arm are making an amount of they can't refuse here

[00:37:55.840 --> 00:38:01.220]
So that they're having like watered down their marijuana decolonization law to have like to pacify a U.S

[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.520]
Yeah, I know. I mean it's I mean there's none of this topos man. I mean and it's just uh

[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:08.800]
You know like you say man the whole American public is just

[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.400]
Uh, you know that's exactly it you did that very well

[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:13.140]
Yes

[00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:18.860]
That was that was it. I think that was the definitive description of the American public's the state of mind right now

[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:24.480]
Yeah, man. I mean shit, bro. I mean what are we what are we gonna do now? Yeah, okay have a great day pali

No, I don't want to time jicketer right another one of those things do you that's all we need is time jicker with his

[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.820]
uh, four letter word of the week column

[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:46.920]
Five say all a week is appropriate for his column. He's got all the new network shows on every day

[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:52.200]
That's like 75 columns in a row about that again time. You're so lame. It's embarrassing. It's humiliating man

[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.120]
You're a joke. You're an industry joke

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.960]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound and to the Sun Central have anything now could be wrong

[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.540]
I could have missed it. I scoured their website. They have anything on scoffer. Well no

[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:10.060]
Of course, they don't have the inside line like very jackass does to Greg's house or wherever Greg is hanging out these days

[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.260]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 now what others little what does that mean

[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:20.120]
What are like the little stars he's putting on is it like a new symbol your putters. That's just an accident

[00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.440]
No, that's so I know which ones they uh

[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:26.700]
Don't let on but that way they don't bother me bother and call me every five seconds

[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.620]
Wait, wait, wait, so I'm supposed to put them on but you're not going to is that it? Why would you put them on you can just keep doing what you're doing

[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:33.820]
Here's Miami. Hello

[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.640]
Oh brother, I told you I told you don't put that guy on did I tell you that he won't listen

[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.100]
Here's Miami Lakes. Hello

[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.140]
Hello. Yes sir. Hi. I'm sorry. Good morning. Yeah, and boy nice to you

[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.600]
Uh my old time favored uh movie characters been James Bond

[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:02.400]
Is that okay? Well, that's great. I mean there's been several James Bond, but I guess you know I

[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.860]
See that's a tough one because there've been so many different James Bond's there's only been one of each of these other characters

[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.620]
Uh, but there's only one James Bond. Well, which one is that Sean Connery?

[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.700]
That's all James Bond. It's the character

[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:18.720]
Not who I know. No, no, you're wrong. It's not the character that that's the point that kind of that's like saying Sherlock Holmes

[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:20.740]
Is a character

[00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.120]
Roger, I like the Roger Moore one. Okay. Well, that's what I'm gonna put down. Thanks a lot. Okay. See Roger Moore

[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.080]
No, yeah, in that case when there's been like uh, you know

[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.820]
Yeah, well, he can't just put that

[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:37.240]
Well, not no, not not to any extent. Oh, Rodgers. I thought that's what a character was

[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.360]
Independent of the actor

[00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.780]
How can you compare Sean Connery as James Bond with Roger Moore? I'm not

[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.120]
But we're talking the definition of a word

[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.200]
You know what you're doing is nitpicking is what you're doing. All right. What you're doing is being extraordinarily and unbelievably

[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.320]
Unacceptably annoying. Would you agree, be your boy?

[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:01.200]
What?

[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:10.660]
Who is your all-time favorite character from the movies now the character is defined by who plays it if there is several if there are a bunch of different ones

[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:14.640]
Okay, that would be like saying Batman

[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:23.720]
Right right. He's a character has his Batman been played by the same character in the same movie no no question ever

[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.560]
No, never well guess what it's my poll and that's the way I'm done. Okay

[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:32.060]
In fact, uh, you're right. I'm gonna cross it out

[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:38.660]
Just put James Bond because if we do that then we'll have to have James Bond with Sean Connery and who else played James

[00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:41.980]
The one who was one other one there was the one before him that only made one movie

[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:48.980]
Timmy Dalton no, whoever so we know we don't have the luxury of putting 75,000 choices on the poll especially for an audience that goes

[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.440]
Like that all the time

[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:53.240]
So forget about it

[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:59.820]
And speaking of forget about it should have had a whole lot more votes yesterday than it got yep five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a

[00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:02.800]
AT&T and Verizon line here's for a lot of deal hello

[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.540]
Good morning. No. Yes, sir. Yeah, it's really hard to pick one character over the years, you know

[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:12.160]
Yes, it is. That's why we did that. I mean for a simple what would be the point of doing it? While my vote would be for

[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:16.280]
Alex the large clockwork orange. Oh, I need to change my vote

[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.960]
We're Chornecy Gardner and being there

[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:26.580]
No, no, try one. All right, Alex the large Alex will do okay. Thanks. No Tom bring his own toothpicks. Okay. Thank you

[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.520]
That's a good choice

[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:33.200]
And it was only one guy that Malcolm McDowell was the only way to play that character

[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.300]
So we don't have to put down this one or that one

[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.260]
Not a whole bunch of Alex's it was Alex Bennett

[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.780]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty now is there something going on with these lines here?

[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:48.780]
Well, I guess not maybe they just don't like this poll question. Okay, because it certainly isn't

[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.380]
Simulating the way the other ones have been

[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:56.900]
And to me like I said, I think this is the most interesting one of all all the when you see when you do the James Bond you just say the character

[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:02.500]
I don't know they know who you're talking about everybody will pick it based on their favorite version of it

[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:06.380]
So in other words, we could put sure a lot of homes sure

[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.560]
I

[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.780]
Mean Darth Vader was three different guys. Yeah

[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:14.840]
How do you know

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:20.920]
That's a good point. Are you sure? Were you were you checking out of the outfit? Were you checking out of the head gear?

[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:25.180]
That's a good point. Yeah, so you better double check sir. I said he'll do it for you

[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.120]
five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line. Here's Miami. Hello

[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:33.640]
Neil yes, sir

[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:38.200]
Don't know his name, but Lee Irmy the drill sergeant from Full Metal Jacket

[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:40.400]
Stars his name

[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:48.200]
He doesn't know the name of the character so we can't do it yet sergeant something. Well somebody will know. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you

[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.900]
Okay, I know the actor's name

[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:53.180]
Well, we don't care about what the actor's name is and not the same pool right

[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.180]
But I'll just go into my book and look up full metal jacket. How do you like that? How's that strike you?

[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:58.780]
Hopefully right in the head

[00:43:58.780 --> 00:43:59.200]
Hmm

[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:03.860]
Full metal jacket. Here's a funeral parade of roses

[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:05.440]
Vato no Celetz

[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:08.000]
Serrezu. What the hell is your kind of language is that

[00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.820]
Well, that's a Japanese movie with Poshio Matsumoto

[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:15.080]
What am I looking for full metal jacket? There's full moddy

[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:21.360]
Let's see full metal jacket the first half of us Kubrick's movie steers clear southeast Asia yon yon yon

[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.400]
Uh, it's got name the character doesn't it? It must

[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.640]
Uh private joker uh

[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:33.640]
Private joker it's gonna be drill sergeant or uh master sergeant something like that

[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:35.400]
No

[00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:42.200]
Oh, and looking at the actually having that word in here town jicke better write a column about my time movie book

[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.860]
They have the s word in there. It doesn't have the name of the character. So somebody will know. Okay somebody will be

[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:54.060]
Sergeant somebody five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a AT&T and this is a tough one

[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.400]
That's that's one of the reasons gonna be sergeant Hartman. That's it

[00:44:59.220 --> 00:44:59.860]
Gunnery sergeant

[00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.080]
Does he have a first name that's all that it says here gunnery sergeant Hartman

[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.700]
I don't think they use this first name in the movie really yeah because he's a drill sergeant so

[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.840]
They're not allowed. He's a drill sergeant. That's the kind of clearance he's looking for

[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.060]
Five six ten oh and that's so good for pie too if you see pie at the end of the movie six the adrenaline is head

[00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:24.920]
Well, I mean it's a good movie to see but it's not gonna ruin it for it because I mean if you can't tell that washing that thing all the way through

[00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:30.220]
That's right if you had a thing like that growing on the side of your head you'd probably put a drill in a two direct try to make it go away

[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.040]
Here's a call from Hollywood. Hello

[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.620]
Hi, how you doing great

[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:43.180]
How about Randall Patrick from Murphy he's on there our our P. McMurphy. Oh he is. Yes, sir. He was one of the first ones

[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.400]
Then I have to go with Sean

[00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.060]
From the before

[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:49.320]
Go with who?

[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.840]
Uh, Chancy

[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:57.940]
Peter Sellers and then being there. Oh, okay, okay. Thanks. That's a great movie by the way. Shirley McLean

[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:03.260]
Chancy, Chelsea. Okay, Chelsea won Gardner. He was a gardener

[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:10.160]
Wasn't he yes he was while he was in our chance and he was a gardener but they

[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.480]
screwed his name up so they kept calling him Chancy Gardner all the way through the movie

[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:16.720]
Yeah, when you like that scene with Shirley McLean in bed, that's the new one

[00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:17.780]
Okay

[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.740]
Hey listen, you know she at least had the right part. Okay, they may have been a little old and moldy

[00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.520]
But yeah, Chancy Gardner's gonna research in Hartman Alex Delarge and see we're not gonna

[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:33.000]
We're purposely not gonna put down the name of the movie or the actor actress because if you don't know that then uh

[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.540]
Well, you know, what's your qualification to vote, huh? Right. What's your qualification to vote

[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.840]
Probably the same as like an at 2000 presidential election. Okay, you're breathing

[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.600]
I think they should only let just a small handful of us vote

[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.000]
Starting with nobody that likes bush that should be the first requirement

[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:50.720]
Or something that's a good start sure

[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.360]
So Georgian I will vote unless right George can't vote. He's a little alien. I can vote illegally

[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.980]
Well, it's Florida isn't right then stop anybody else

Like a fox and friends. I believe they're my friends and they really care about me

[00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:07.370]
I know it's true

[00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:09.850]
Convincing

[00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:15.170]
Cause I saw it on

[00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:25.370]

[00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:32.630]
I love my job my money's done. That's what I think they've been for

[00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:37.310]
They came for my family

[00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.290]
Oh, they did not agree

[00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:43.030]
But I have nothing to hide

[00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:45.010]
So I should be all right

[00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.410]
Until they come for me

[00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:52.010]
I know it's true

[00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:55.710]
Convincing to

[00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:00.370]
Gotta start it on baby

[00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:07.010]
I've got the fruit

[00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:10.890]
And the fake is true

[00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:11.270]
The other

[00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:30.810]
1003 at 560 WDQ am radio tofyo host to keep seat on brown diversity panel

[00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:34.650]

Thanks was good buddy Marty Rubenstein boy talk about incestors relationships talk about another ego trip talk about more bull crap about nothing

[00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:51.210]
Big Arnie chronic faster big Arnie says for our poll today inspector clues. So you know

[00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:55.110]
I'm thinking about this pool and usually I'm pretty comfortable and happy with the way I'm doing a poll

[00:50:55.110 --> 00:51:00.390]
I may not have done this right is that possible? No, I mean could I make a mistake?

[00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:07.250]
Because I don't know I think the premise is okay, but

[00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:10.130]
I think it's fine. Yeah, yeah

[00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:13.690]
Inspector Kluzav who is your I'm not talking about that one

[00:51:13.690 --> 00:51:18.290]
Who's your favorite all-time character from the movies? Well, for example Johnny Depp and how come since we were Johnny Depp

[00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:22.150]
And sensitive the other day nobody ever said fear and loathing in Las Vegas where he plays hunter rest Thompson

[00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:25.890]
It was discussed on one of the movie polls that we did

[00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:30.970]
I thought he did a great job in a good, but I never saw I even know he was in it

[00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:33.870]
Does it even look like him? Oh like I said

[00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:39.970]
Anyway, so hunter rest Thompson I'm putting them because that's the character he plays correct and somebody facts that and

[00:51:39.970 --> 00:51:44.590]
Well, hey, here's the list and maybe maybe it's okay. I'm just I'm just the James Bond thing is disturbing to me

[00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:50.290]
Because it would seem to me that if you're gonna do this and get any significance from how people feel about it

[00:51:50.290 --> 00:51:53.990]
You'd have to know which James Bond people like the best not just a character

[00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:02.030]
See, I think you're full of crap. I mean just in general principle. I think you're full of crap, but especially on this but if James

[00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:11.590]
Yeah, if James Bond was their favorite character because say Sean Connery's portrayal of it right then that's who they're referring to when they choose that

[00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.690]
Well, how do we know that we don't and we don't care

[00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.170]
Okay, why not be like ourselves department we don't care

[00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.090]
Did you just pass me that thing from pop it up Parker?

[00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:30.450]
Nothing. Oh, then that came either from the pomp and we were from Troy the boy. Let me take a look and see what because now his new deal is he just

[00:52:31.010 --> 00:52:35.430]
He just he just blank sheets of paper stuff scrolled out you talk about a sealed department

[00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:40.990]
It's just gone to hell in a hand basket not that they were any good in the first place. Let me see where this came from

[00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:42.970]
Uh

[00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:46.710]
What is that all about?

[00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.730]
No, it came from from you I

[00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:54.650]
Got you heard something you thanks me to my the reason you wouldn't know it's because it doesn't have anything on top

[00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:59.450]
It's just a sheet of paper Carlos facts. I facts. I see and you know this what I'm saying

[00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:03.430]
You wouldn't even know what that was unless you go through reading the Troy. I'm gonna tell you've been here long enough

[00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:09.850]
You've now joined officially the QM sales department. He doesn't give a crap. Troy used to be our one great hope our one great dark hope

[00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:14.730]
Troy Stratford a big improvement over his predecessor, but not anymore

[00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:20.610]
He's caved in he just doesn't give a crap. Everyone doesn't be caring off to send his very best. He's lately sending his very worst

[00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:25.210]
You suck Troy. You fit right in fact. He's probably is the one of the turnum

[00:53:26.850 --> 00:53:27.330]

[00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:28.570]

Tronsey Gardener hunter rest Thompson D Jones who the hell was D Jones that was the one of the facts is oh

[00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:14.610]
Raiders of the Lost Ark. I didn't see that. Oh Indian oh and that's gonna get the Kevin and Hollywood all up

[00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:18.190]
Said you guys have such a little I don't want to see Raiders of the Lost Ark, okay?

[00:54:19.230 --> 00:54:24.770]
Don't want to see any of those action Indiana Jones and a planet of the rapes or whatever that was

[00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:29.370]
I don't want to see those I don't care about those the planet of the rapes is funny. I

[00:54:29.370 --> 00:54:35.710]
Don't care. I don't care. What is it gang rape all through it? I see well

[00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:40.270]
It was on a receiving and then we find it most amusing and I have a decision that was called in during the break

[00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:45.210]
Well just a minute just relax. Okay. We got to know him before we start playing the comedy, but so thank God it's Wednesday

[00:54:46.090 --> 00:54:51.050]
Cuz this just we're not getting a response here today. We have any other ones. So maybe I'm looking to move you things Brian. Hello

[00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.230]
Yes, sir. Yes

[00:54:54.190 --> 00:55:02.030]
paraphrase you don't confuse the actor with the character and George is right. You're you're getting away from mature original premise was

[00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:04.750]
You want the actor do you want the

[00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.150]
characters like a party Superman do you want a Reeves?

[00:55:08.350 --> 00:55:13.710]
What the guy from the TV series back in the 50s or do you got want the Superman a broken neck whatever his name is?

[00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:19.530]
George he wants Christopher Reeves. Oh, okay. There was George Reeves and it was Christopher Reeves. How do you like that?

[00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:24.770]
Okay, well the thing is and then it was Jim Reeves. It doesn't matter like George says is the is the actual character like you said

[00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:28.510]
I'm very convinced you have me broke or something. I mean that's what that's what you want

[00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:31.150]
Right, I mean don't

[00:55:31.150 --> 00:55:36.870]
It's not your premise. The don't confuse the actor with the character see but there you see you're giving me directions again

[00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:41.590]
I'll see it like I've done one fact so you give me directions well, you know get your right and get your act together

[00:55:43.090 --> 00:55:43.490]
I

[00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.710]
Think of the other Neil get it. Okay. All right. Okay, come down. Come down

[00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:52.110]
Just a goddamn radio show. Okay, quit taking it so serious. You know what I'm saying? No, that's right. I forgot for a shoot

[00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:55.310]
It is life and death. This is our life and death pulled today

[00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:01.090]
5 6 7 0 5 60 not but I don't agree. I'm not convinced

[00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:05.130]
Well, it's two different questions. I'll do it this way because otherwise it makes it

[00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:11.470]
Although it doesn't make it that complicated. How many characters are there of any import who've been played to any degree by more than one

[00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:13.790]
Person if it's a big character a lot

[00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:22.450]
Dracula right like maybe 20 30 guys have played Dracula Superman likewise fat man

[00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:26.810]
Mm-hmm James Bond and some Sherlock Holmes right

[00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:33.470]
Does matter fact that's another poll or series of polls that you can take who did all right James Bond, you know

[00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:40.170]
Who's the best James Bond how long is that Paul Paul gonna last?

[00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:45.830]
Oh, we how many votes are we gonna get on that yeah, that's about good. That's perfect for your polls

[00:56:45.830 --> 00:56:47.590]
That's about how many votes you get anyway. Yeah

[00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:50.450]
Georgia's whole audience votes three times

[00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:55.750]
5 6 7 0 5 60 hey listen if you could just get the publicity mr. Egos getting there

[00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:58.110]
Oh, and you know, here's another interesting thing you remember that fact

[00:56:58.110 --> 00:57:01.330]
You let me rich why don't I put the Steve Cain on right fill in

[00:57:02.770 --> 00:57:05.250]
There was a Jewish fact she was talking about to fill in

[00:57:07.650 --> 00:57:08.010]
Is

[00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:13.170]
Isn't it interesting that in the 9 to 10 hour during the summer months and any other time that George feels in doing the show not that

[00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.570]
I want to go to bat for George because believe me that's its up assignment

[00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:22.370]
But you're up against him this mr. Ego make a dent does he have any number whether online George is on to make any difference

[00:57:22.370 --> 00:57:25.790]
We got the test pattern on okay. He still has got like fractions. So all right

[00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:31.250]
So trying to give me a sign an answer about how Georgia so ponderous and he's terminal and boring which you know all those things

[00:57:31.250 --> 00:57:34.550]
I got a point but I mean compared to mr. Ego he's like senate like a

[00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:37.110]
phenomenal like a Mexican jumping beam

[00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.930]
Compared to that old-style contrived right wing crap

[00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.930]
God, how about putting mr. Egos in addition to which I thought he had a job

[00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:51.370]
Right even though it's on a station that nobody knows what it is and nobody wants to hear it in the first place

[00:57:51.370 --> 00:57:53.650]
We already thought he was gainfully employed

[00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:58.690]
And certainly getting a hell lot more publicity than in Georgia will ever get

[00:57:59.550 --> 00:58:01.290]
Just wait for like join the diversity board

[00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:06.990]
Here is a fact from Glendus is I realized that a m format restricts the language out of the movie quotes you can put on a year

[00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:10.690]
Well, what do you mean a m format what about fm? Could we say this on fm? No, no

[00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:12.590]
It's the American f and way glenda

[00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:17.990]
But since the poll is really an internet situation perhaps you're gonna hit that or even bleep for midwards and quotes while I

[00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:21.590]
We're not doing quotes say that was yesterday and we don't we don't bleep them out on the internet

[00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:23.610]
We put the word on there. We had the f word on one

[00:58:23.610 --> 00:58:25.130]
You know, yes, we did

[00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:30.990]
For example my favorite quote from a blue velvet when Dennis hoppers says I'll f anything that moves

[00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:35.210]
I'll bet given the chance many of us would have given that well we could have put that on there

[00:58:35.210 --> 00:58:36.890]
We could have nobody called it in right

[00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:44.490]
Also, why are cartoons not part of the pool sure George will cover the comic book situation and excruciating detail over our long-hot summer

[00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:48.230]
You don't do comic books you do you want

[00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:52.050]
But cartoons are a valid movie art and do deserve to be included

[00:58:52.050 --> 00:58:57.350]
Well, how many cartoons can you name like what's your favorite cartoon character bugs bunny porcupig?

[00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:59.210]
Felix the cat superman Batman

[00:58:59.910 --> 00:59:05.110]
It says my pick for all time favorite character would be have to be bugs bunny my favorite quote. Hey, what's up?

[00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:07.910]
Okay, well, Brenda thank you so much

[00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:15.330]
10 13 and 5 60 they just keep on coming baby. Yeah, let's hear it

[00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:20.950]
The hits just keep on coming at the pizza lot with two locations in brown for you know

[00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:21.930]
What a great place

[00:59:23.130 --> 00:59:28.730]
Not one of these fancy schmancy places where you have to walk in dress to the hill to just a nice family a laid-back kind of atmosphere

[00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:34.970]
The food is fresh. It's delicious. It's cooked to order no lumpy mushy. A pasta everything is just like the fallen snow

[00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.790]
That's how fresh it is and Jeff Collins a pretty fresh guy too, okay?

[00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:43.350]
And the food just keeps getting better or better the pizza love the original power location is in Davie

[00:59:43.350 --> 00:59:48.310]
To show you what courage this man has got there on university drive between driven in 595 and a pizza lot

[00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:50.970]
Plasma right beyond pier one imports kitty corner the new armory low cafe

[00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:56.010]
Zillions and zillions of free parking spaces right in front and delicious and sational Italian goodies

[00:59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.590]
They got chicken dishes and veal and seafood three different kinds of great pizza including that Fugazi

[01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:05.990]
They got calzone super subs the best garlic rolls you've ever popped in your post and all your favorite pasta dishes too

[01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:09.710]
And the prices are so low you can take the whole family and a whole gang back over and over again

[01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:15.590]
Here's the a number for take-out delivery and whatever in Davie and for catering 954 916

[01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:22.370]
8880 954 916 8880 and now open also in plantation now by me where there's a dearth

[01:00:22.370 --> 01:00:27.130]
I mean a desperate need for restaurants like this and we got one now the pizza lock is in plantation

[01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:32.090]

[01:00:40.730 --> 01:00:47.810]
Nabahilland sunrise behind Walgreens called 954 382 1999 for the newest world-framing pizza laws

[01:00:55.730 --> 01:01:00.170]
I am Dr. Jutta I will be performing your hot surgery today

[01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:02.210]
Now how you doctor? What do you know? What do you say?

[01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.610]
How are you feeling Mr. David? Like I did it to a York government party

[01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:07.170]
What do you think I feel like over here?

[01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:11.790]
I feel it this simple heart-fouled procedure just means deeply into the basket you won't feel anything

[01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:15.610]
Say I went on the fast I can't move a nothing

[01:01:15.610 --> 01:01:18.450]
Look at that he's open to my chest now

[01:01:19.310 --> 01:01:24.230]
By the way son Dr. Cook is taking off his pants and now he's

[01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:26.610]
What the great thing my chest

[01:01:26.610 --> 01:01:27.650]
Tarmony

[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.090]
Do you know who I am?

[01:01:33.730 --> 01:01:36.010]
Oops, the dogs are going to die

[01:01:36.690 --> 01:01:38.010]
That's not something I can do

[01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:40.250]
Oops, the dog are there

[01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.690]
He's raising my chest

[01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:42.990]
Did I get more?

[01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.170]
Oops, the dog are there

[01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.270]
Oops, the dog are there

[01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:51.190]
Oh my, did you die?

[01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:54.470]
Oh my, did you die?

[01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:58.310]
It was a beautiful funeral mouth

[01:01:58.310 --> 01:02:00.530]
Even if I was the only one who showed up

[01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:01.970]
You were like a fine enemy

[01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:14.810]
Well, looks like it's time for me to do what I always wanted to do

[01:02:14.810 --> 01:02:25.290]
The dogs are the best to lay

[01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.810]
Why do you think you're throwing dancing on my grave?

[01:02:27.810 --> 01:02:30.050]
Ciao, I thought you were dead mo

[01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:31.530]
Of course I'm dead to them

[01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.490]
I'm a zombie or an...

[01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:35.130]
Ciao, you know what that means mo

[01:02:35.130 --> 01:02:36.590]
I got a kill you now

[01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:39.570]
And how do you propose to do that since I'm already dead

[01:02:39.570 --> 01:02:40.450]
To the day

[01:02:40.450 --> 01:02:42.510]
Well, just something I never told you mo

[01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:43.270]
Yeah what's that?

[01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.850]
I'm building the vampire's land

[01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:47.590]
Big deal

[01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:50.370]
Now I got to stand here with my robbing sand

[01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.490]
Like yourself a pumpkin

[01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:52.770]
I'm an avoidhold see

[01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.730]
Why are you looking?

[01:02:54.150 --> 01:02:56.510]
What's the power of price compel you?

[01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:57.410]
Oh I'm pissed!

[01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:57.690]

[01:02:57.970 --> 01:02:58.110]
I'm like

[01:02:58.110 --> 01:02:58.890]
I'm a monster!

[01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:59.050]
I'm a monster!

[01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.530]
I'm a monster!

[01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:00.510]
I'm a monster!

[01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:04.610]
10, 20, and 5, 60

[01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:05.770]
A lot of movie stuff in that bit

[01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.030]
I just noticed for the first time

[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:07.330]
Right?

[01:03:07.570 --> 01:03:08.810]
Anyway, we're not doing this right

[01:03:08.810 --> 01:03:12.770]
I told you I felt I had like a bad, sick, disgusting feeling in a pit of my stomach

[01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.890]
Because I'm looking at all these fangs which you sent me about 7,500 on

[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:21.310]
And you're gonna have to specify the movie on a lot of these

[01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:24.330]
We can't understand

[01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:24.690]
We could

[01:03:24.690 --> 01:03:27.850]
But again, because when we were discussing it before the show

[01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:30.210]
If they don't know the movie, if they don't know the name of the character

[01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:31.710]
Then how can it be their favorite character?

[01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:33.170]
Oh and Rich Pactors out of control

[01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:36.570]
Can we discuss this before the show today?

[01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:37.190]
Out of control

[01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:38.330]
Rich get a life, okay?

[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.490]
Yes we did discuss it

[01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:40.490]
You're the one I said it

[01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:43.170]
Carlos was a bitch and about somebody calling on an inside line

[01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.510]
He didn't tell me that that's who it was

[01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:45.630]
Rich Pactors?

[01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:46.010]
On an inside line

[01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.910]
No, the hotline

[01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:48.910]
I think that's who it was this morning calling on the hotline

[01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:49.710]
Saying what?

[01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:51.070]
We didn't get it

[01:03:51.070 --> 01:03:52.830]
Or I got it and it sounded like a lot of noise

[01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:54.190]
But how do you know who it was?

[01:03:54.890 --> 01:03:56.290]
Because he called yesterday on that hotline

[01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.510]
Rich Pactor?

[01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.570]
Yeah

[01:03:58.970 --> 01:03:59.890]
To say what?

[01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.310]
I don't recall

[01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:05.570]
Go away Rich, okay?

[01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:07.630]
You're a good guy but get lost just out of control

[01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:12.130]
See this is what happens when when the listener is decided to become a little bit too

[01:04:12.130 --> 01:04:12.910]
Too much and too important

[01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:14.130]
Even the fat man

[01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:16.650]
The fat Rich didn't call on the bad line. Yes, they did he

[01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:17.490]
No, we did not

[01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:19.570]
And he's got that number. He didn't call it that line

[01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:22.530]
Just to disgrace Rich Pactor

[01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:25.830]
He used to be a good guy but he's turned into a chronic. I mean I can't believe this guy

[01:04:25.830 --> 01:04:28.210]
Well, I'll give you the list. Okay, Harry Callahan

[01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:29.870]
Dirty Harry, okay, that's fine

[01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:32.490]
Carl Spackler from Cadyshack

[01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:35.030]
I know it would be too long before we have a Cadyshack one

[01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:37.810]
That's the QAM crowd

[01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:39.210]
Uh

[01:04:40.270 --> 01:04:40.990]
Hercule Paro

[01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:44.690]
Agatha Christie's Hercule Paro Pio IROT

[01:04:44.690 --> 01:04:45.090]
You got it?

[01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.350]
Yep

[01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:49.110]
Played by several actors so like I've been trying to tell you

[01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:51.270]
You can't put down which one you will like the best

[01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.670]
See that that takes away all the fun from this uh pole

[01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:55.550]
It leaves it good

[01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:57.490]
Take the can only

[01:04:57.490 --> 01:05:01.450]
I think you're I think that other guy that you paid the call before I think you're both full of crap

[01:05:01.450 --> 01:05:04.950]
Well, you could make it the other way but then just add a line to the question

[01:05:05.770 --> 01:05:11.170]
See no, no you don't need another line. Who's your favorite character? Uh Sean Connery's James Bond

[01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:11.790]
All right

[01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:13.270]
See okay

[01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:14.430]
What are you watching?

[01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:17.390]
I don't think it's that complicated

[01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:18.230]
Not complicated

[01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.490]
Can't now see the comic book character if you were to say Superman or Batman

[01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:22.230]
It's fine

[01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:24.270]
Because it's always the same

[01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:28.850]
But to try to compare Sean Connery's James Bond would Roger Moore for example

[01:05:28.850 --> 01:05:30.810]
Is that comparing apples with fruit case?

[01:05:31.070 --> 01:05:32.750]
There's no comparison there yes you are

[01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.310]
So it's Brabs Stoker's Dracula that we're putting on there?

[01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:36.290]
No, it's not

[01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:41.650]
See now that's the interesting part of it is that Brabs Stoker's Dracula

[01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:44.090]
I don't understand that it didn't make any sense to me

[01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:45.490]
Brabs Stoker wrote it okay

[01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:49.530]
Todd Browning directed the brilliant the great version the Bella Lagosi

[01:05:49.530 --> 01:05:51.090]
The definitive Dracula

[01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:53.590]
Like Harry Oldman

[01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.570]
Yeah, Gary Oldman

[01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.010]
I give up like I said you talk

[01:05:58.970 --> 01:06:03.090]
Now here's the list that says I have to represent the retards for the pull please put forest gump

[01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.910]
Yeah, we can put him down if you want

[01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:07.530]
But then you'll have to put the name of the movie

[01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:13.210]
Carl from Slings Blade

[01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:14.510]
See you can't just put Carl

[01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:18.250]
That's my point. I'm sure he had a last name in the movie

[01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.370]
Now well, nobody's gonna know what that is

[01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:21.570]
Just put Carl in parentheses

[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:25.490]
It's quick see now I have to fight not only the audience I gotta fight them too today

[01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:28.810]
If I would have known this I'd have called and sicked the next several days

[01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:33.290]
Carl from Slings Blade Charlie Flowers for Alginal, a haphagodorn

[01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:35.170]
We're not putting him on there

[01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:38.670]
Also for the for the drill sergeant in full metal jacket

[01:06:39.970 --> 01:06:41.890]
I'd like him a lot of the character and I didn't know his name

[01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:44.890]
So I think that's one that we should put drill sergeant from full metal jacket on there

[01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:46.850]
Or at least full metal jacket

[01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:51.710]
Sergeant Hartman right was it Mary Hartman or Phil Hartman

[01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:56.390]
I thought you said it was gonna research in Hartman with who didn't have a first name

[01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:59.430]
Right, but nobody's gonna know that that's the back from full metal jacket

[01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:03.390]
Even the people that like so put full metal straight jacket and parentheses on it

[01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:07.330]
That's what I'm trying to tell you lazy little spick. That's what I'm trying to uh, yeah get with it

[01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:13.130]
Anyway, this fax goes on it says how about that? He says I know the quality owns their most obvious from the godfather

[01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:15.450]
But what about flat fat Clemenza leaves it good

[01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:19.570]
Take it only sure I have no problem that he's a great character

[01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:25.550]
Just because you love the godfather doesn't mean necessarily. It's gotta be Marlon Brando or it's gotta be James Con or

[01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:31.730]
Or Al Pacino that was your favorite character could be any of those others. Who was your favorite character from the movies of all time

[01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:36.150]
That's all how about like a baby Jane how about Betty Davidson baby Jane

[01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:40.930]
Could be your favorite character right right? I don't just mention that nobody is voted for yet

[01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:43.170]
But this certainly should be on there baby Jane

[01:07:44.250 --> 01:07:47.670]
Baby Jane got it. I better put the name of the movie down

[01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:55.350]
Now here's another one. Could you please put Hank from me myself and Irene played by Jim Curie

[01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:59.650]
So Zanthony in with Miami. Well, see you're gonna have to put down the name of the movie because if you just put it put down Hank

[01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.030]
It could be any Hank

[01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:08.650]
That was probably could be time Hank could be Hank from passions, you know big tall goofy Hank that stands around and they just looks good

[01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:10.490]
Don't say nothing. You know Hank

[01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:16.430]
Why do I all forget we had a tremendous response on Scott for well being on the station

[01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:20.530]
How we had no calls huh? Well, they don't know who that is. We don't have the sports crowd

[01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:24.110]
Just wait just wait till the sports crowd. Here's that scratchy gravely voice

[01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:25.050]
You know

[01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:30.750]
So this is us this be us favorite characters Sparky Griswold and the vacation movies

[01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:32.810]
and

[01:08:32.810 --> 01:08:33.490]
Beetle juice

[01:08:36.330 --> 01:08:39.190]
Then you say I'm writing them down. Okay

[01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.390]
Favorite character the wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz there you go

[01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:46.570]
I see you gonna have to put the movie wicked witch Wizard of Oz got it

[01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:51.890]
I'm just I'm just putting information up you facts in long the Eric and then you can get into a big brawl with him

[01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:56.530]
Okay, however you want to do it because I still say I've done something very bad with this thing today

[01:08:56.530 --> 01:08:59.970]
They've been so good and yesterday we like almost 300,000 hits on the website

[01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:05.230]
We had a tumultuous response even during these dog days of post post-paisa haneester

[01:09:05.230 --> 01:09:09.890]
Which is almost impossible in South Florida, but I think we pushed you know, we pushed into the limit

[01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:11.330]
I think it's fine

[01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:16.230]
You do doesn't have to be complicated. They call they facts. They say a name. We write it down

[01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:20.370]
We put it on the pole. We vote. We listen to bitch. I think what you're basically trying to say is we don't give a crap

[01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.910]
Oh, and I would certainly second that emotion

[01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.630]
1026 and 560 w.d.c. I'll tell you where they give a crap

Coming up tonight on inside the behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story

[01:11:02.230 --> 01:11:07.990]
We take a good hard stiff look and to start him if only they had waited a few more years

[01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:13.610]
They could have ridden an unexpected way of a popularity surrounding the consumption of human flesh

[01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.410]
They were fine young animals

[01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:20.610]
Yeah

[01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:27.050]
Well we figured our name was pretty radicals that who'd ever identify with a cannibal yeah fine young cannibals lead singer

[01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:33.470]
Roland gift so what happens we tank in 1989 and two years later its silence at our

[01:11:34.030 --> 01:11:41.270]
Lams might 1991's Oscar winner silence of the lambs was about a man who whipped people's faces off and ate their

[01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:42.110]
Livers and brains

[01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:48.030]
Clearly he was that year's prestige picture it was made gay role in the idea

[01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:50.350]
Wuking up with Anthony Hopkins you know

[01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:54.790]
Anabulda cannibal fine young cannibals financially strapped managers slubby gold

[01:11:54.790 --> 01:12:00.530]
Was the inspiration behind a series of spoken word recordings featuring Hannibal Lector

[01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:05.230]
Interpreting the works of fine young cannibals. I can't stop

[01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:08.050]
The way I feel

[01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:11.470]
Things you do don't seem real

[01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:15.030]
She drives me crazy

[01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:16.130]
Oh

[01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:18.950]
Like no one else

[01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:19.570]
Oh

[01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:24.050]
She drives me crazy

[01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:25.830]
And I can't help myself

[01:12:28.150 --> 01:12:30.930]
Or you admit I made an error in judgment

[01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:37.410]
We paid so Anthony 15 million quid and we sold let me see here

[01:12:39.670 --> 01:12:40.770]
Nine copies

[01:12:41.370 --> 01:12:45.630]
Rumor has it that the rest of the band was so despondent they ate each other

[01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:49.010]
Of course they didn't make very good food

[01:12:49.530 --> 01:12:50.410]
They're British

[01:12:51.070 --> 01:12:55.830]
It's a big juicy sobbing went look at show business tonight an inside the vine

[01:12:56.990 --> 01:13:00.870]
Well, look at his here's an endorsement for Scott for L from Lynn Samuel

[01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:04.770]
She says in New York City before the huge blow up with OPEN Anthony made them change formats

[01:13:04.770 --> 01:13:09.870]
John main Nelly the guy who first hired me a wavc lens says so we all know he's got a good eye for talent

[01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:14.650]
Was consulting at the w any w and head feral on the uh in the morning show

[01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:18.470]
I really like some honey like that there's a little something

[01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:23.330]
I would grab any voice he'll be on at seven o'clock tonight on q amp see we're trying to give him a good send off are we?

[01:13:24.670 --> 01:13:29.210]
Yeah as opposed to like moment guilty this morning a lot of sarcasm and air dripping with sarcasm

[01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:33.390]
Because Greg again open up his mouth to very jackass and made a cost to comment

[01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:36.470]
We're trying to insert a little bit more comedy a little more humor on that morning show

[01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:38.230]
They must have said that a whole bunch of times

[01:13:38.970 --> 01:13:40.710]
This morning okay toward the end of the show

[01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:48.970]
And probably because they're both nervous when you think I would think when you be nervous knowing the way that Greg runs at place like it in sanus item

[01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:53.970]
Hannibal Lecter was just an advocate there. Why the hell isn't he on there yet? Well, he is now

[01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.410]
There you go and Clemens are we got right we got it?

[01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:58.270]
Spackler

[01:13:59.070 --> 01:14:02.630]
Vacula not Graham Stoker's Dracula either okay be nerve-race you idiot

[01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:06.270]
Right

[01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:08.790]
That would be like saying what's his name Peter Cushing

[01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:16.250]
Yeah, I have to say to that anybody would say Peter Cushing I say Cushing here in Tussles. How do you like that? He did do a

[01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:22.730]
job he did a what Gary oldman, but it was a totally different movie. Yeah, I was in a middle of similarity whatsoever except for the teeth

[01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:25.910]
Well see that that's why I'm like I'm stumped

[01:14:26.650 --> 01:14:30.030]
Because I don't know how you can compare I understand Dracula was a vampire okay

[01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:37.430]
He was a vampire in transphabetic explains it yeah, but but other than that there's no similarity between what you're talking about

[01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:41.030]
That's like Sherlock Holmes. Who's the other jerk to play Sherlock Holmes like then

[01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:42.710]
There have been a whole bunch of them

[01:14:42.710 --> 01:14:47.630]
But there was one in particular and may have even been Peter Cushing. I don't know. I mean he was uh there was only one

[01:14:48.590 --> 01:14:50.930]
Sherlock Holmes and I was a razzle bathbone

[01:14:51.970 --> 01:14:57.050]
We've been to this 50 million at least maybe not 50 million but 30 million times

[01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:03.290]
So I just feel that this whole thing is screwed up there. So I'm doing my disclaimer. Okay, I washed my hands of it

[01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.210]
Everybody else likes it. I hate it

[01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:11.210]
The audience still like it that much because I don't see like this you for a historic, but the lines are full the facts

[01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:14.310]
They are the lines are not full look at line five you see that

[01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:20.410]
For eight or a year of bastard. I'm picking up line nine cool. There could be that guy again Q.A.M. Hello

[01:15:21.090 --> 01:15:24.830]
Hey, you're living in the West I go on up it those West I that's the guy again

[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:29.290]
Wenders the winders this is the guy again. That's the same guy. That's his own private line

[01:15:29.290 --> 01:15:34.810]
We got rich pacta caught on a bat line. We got this guy. He's I'll tell you this is a great idea

[01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:41.870]
I just came up with a sensational idea. Well share will assign each line to an individual

[01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:47.190]
Not necessarily and then that way because you know each line actually does have a different phone number right right

[01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:50.750]
And then that way as soon as the line rings will know who it is

[01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:54.510]
I know oh like like like this guy and I like it like his name is

[01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:56.870]
Joe or whatever. Oh, there's Joe, you know

[01:15:58.550 --> 01:16:02.650]
And we'll know exactly who it is. Well, you know this computer program is set up to use caller ID

[01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:05.450]
Notice the little phone number with all the unknowns written down there

[01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:08.530]
We have a name come up when they call it if we activated

[01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.770]
Here's Pembroke Pines. Hello

[01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:15.750]
Yeah, hi, sir

[01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:22.630]
Rocky Balboa. How could we forget old Rocky? Okay. Thank you so much for people with an IQ lower than their appena size

[01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:23.930]
Rocky Balboa

[01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:26.270]
Yo Adrian

[01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.890]
So there you go. What's your start to make a little progress now?

[01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:33.110]
This was a little slow out of the box all because of that James Bond thing

[01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:36.550]
See if that guy wouldn't have called in James Bond so early on we could have proceeded here

[01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:40.150]
All the once we got to Dracula and little Boeena boy kept their pushing at Gary Oldman crap

[01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:44.870]
If you want to look to be an old man, I'll tell you right now you better cut the crap Mr. Alcater

[01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:46.110]
I'm gonna stick Raymond on you

[01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:48.810]
Because you know that everybody loves Raymond

[01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:53.510]
In our sales department except for Tommy except for Tommy and except for Boeena boy

[01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:56.470]
Except for us because Raymond is he's an asshole right we know that

[01:16:58.430 --> 01:17:01.730]
So Lynn says Scott Forell is of course. She's not a sports radio person

[01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:03.430]
So she probably has no opinion one way there

[01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:06.710]
But she's trying to like go do a nice thing to give a nice send off nice going Lynn

[01:17:07.330 --> 01:17:09.010]
I sure hope you don't know mad fudge

[01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:14.630]
Well, that brings a good point to mine and what is that I'd be really careful about uh, uh, Lynn Samuels endorsement

[01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:19.070]
Are you picking on my close friend Lynn now?

[01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:21.970]
By and by the way, I should point out she don't like you. I know

[01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:27.310]
I don't mean personally, but on the air she thinks you know, she wants my job

[01:17:27.870 --> 01:17:28.230]
I

[01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:30.530]
Think that's accurate

[01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:35.710]
And maybe she could do like a two-girl show with Miss Fudge

[01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:41.950]
5 6 7 0 5 6 now come here not paying that have you been fuck because I don't have that yet that drudge packing

[01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:44.050]
But oh, I don't have it in here either. It's in the vault

[01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:50.190]
It's in the vault in the bowels of the well. What is it that you guys are doing there in all your skirt time?

[01:17:50.290 --> 01:17:53.310]
You sending me a message to the back of the house

[01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:59.670]
Oh, that's the I couldn't even hear it. I can't find the other one. I need someone. Oh, that's the reason right

[01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:02.450]
That's the distorted screwed up bad one. Yeah, we can't find the good one

[01:18:04.570 --> 01:18:08.510]
We're working on it. Okay, we want to get the perfect fudge for Miss grudge

[01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.030]
Josie Wales

[01:18:11.650 --> 01:18:12.110]
Vito

[01:18:14.350 --> 01:18:17.890]
Now wait, I've got done Koliones that could enough. I mean his name was veto

[01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:19.950]
In fact actually, huh his name was

[01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:25.550]
His name was veto and the lini from Kolione wasn't that his correct name was that was his correct right

[01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:27.430]
Vito and the lini decolione

[01:18:28.110 --> 01:18:30.090]
That I say day decolione tie

[01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:31.950]
They summed it up

[01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:35.590]
Spanish well, I'm so sorry. Okay. I'm so sorry

[01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:37.670]
I

[01:18:38.850 --> 01:18:41.670]
Under a lot of stress a lot of pressure man a lot of pressure

[01:18:42.130 --> 01:18:46.570]
Do we have uh, I don't even know what we got rocky valve boa-handable electric lamenza

[01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:49.870]
Spackler Dracula of course that's a bram stoker

[01:18:50.410 --> 01:18:54.610]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 so you're absolutely wrong about this

[01:18:54.610 --> 01:18:56.890]
I don't care you can argue it from now until a cows come home

[01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:59.490]
But the fact that it matter is it's not the same character

[01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:02.910]
I generally speak generally speaking

[01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:06.410]
I would say the general thing would be all you need is the name of the character

[01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:09.810]
But in cases where they were played by multiple characters

[01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:13.050]
And it was like one that really stood out above the rest in your mind

[01:19:13.050 --> 01:19:18.670]
That would be the one you'd have to specify just like we're putting certain movies to show you about like the wicked witch

[01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:20.590]
I'm sure it was more than one wicked witch

[01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:23.810]
There was more than one hang hey stuff, right?

[01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:26.050]
Yeah

[01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:32.650]
So that's my point about I'll go along with you because it's a lot easier that way we don't want to overburden Carlos and the certainly not Eric

[01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:35.350]
God forbid he should burn out more than two three calories

[01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:38.150]

From the French connection. He said that was the character Gene Hagman play was Papa Doyle

[01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:14.050]
I thought it was Papa Doyle

[01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:18.510]
Maybe that's what he was saying. I don't know. He had he had like a kind of an affectation

[01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:20.150]
It was hard to understand what the lady was talking about

[01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:22.810]
He was talking like a you know soft lord of nerd. Now he was okay

[01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:24.250]
Papa Doyle

[01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:28.370]

[01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:51.590]
Because we don't know anything about movies or maybe he could bring an issue with him

[01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:53.450]
See if I was such an expert on movies

[01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:58.030]
I wouldn't have had these great last couple of weeks where I got to see the happiness and the game

[01:20:59.030 --> 01:21:02.690]

[01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:11.570]
Requiem for a dream. I mean if I was one of these movie intellectuals and new stuff inside and out if I was like a sysco and an ebert

But they don't stop ps Fargo still blows I

[01:24:20.050 --> 01:24:24.590]
Think Paul Harvey Jr. May head to point about rich practice that we weren't really aware of maybe it wasn't there on the surface

[01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:28.290]
But bubbling underneath the surfaces like a very uh chronic guy

[01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:33.030]
Inspector Klusso I thought we already had that under I see my hand writing on the sheets already in there

[01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:36.990]
Thank you so much. That's my fault for not reading the list and we're not really building this list very good. Are we

[01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:38.390]
What do you mean?

[01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:43.350]
Because we don't have that many names on it. Who's your there ought to be a zillion names on here. We don't know you think

[01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:46.630]
At least we had a zillion we don't

[01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:50.830]
At least I don't unless uh, well, that's I'm not ready to mow down. It's moving pretty fast

[01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:54.430]
What does that mean the list is building really quickly

[01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:58.710]

And Peter lawford I'd say to Peter lawford. There was a really strange dude

[01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:58.990]
He was he was kind of like clearance only at least he had some success before my time

[01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:03.790]

It's just you know like an assembly line because muff don't have much else to do anyway

[01:30:20.370 --> 01:30:24.150]
But with clearance because clearance is how it's heavily involved in sports

[01:30:25.010 --> 01:30:28.430]
And clearance of course is trying to make it seem like he had something new with a for real thing

[01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:30.930]
Keep that in mind audience because it was really Greg Reed

[01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:33.850]
That's obviously the one that brought that guy in there he interviewed him

[01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:36.810]
Who did clearest he interviewed Scott for real

[01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:43.550]
That's that's so sad. I mean, I don't want to pick on clearance because he's a good guy to guess my money on time every payday

[01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:48.210]
But I mean for a guy like for well who's 37 years old clearances about what 10

[01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:51.190]

To come in and be interviewed for a job by like our kid. It's uh, you're enough to be your son

[01:30:57.530 --> 01:31:04.970]
Right just above right almost and of course no matter how well clearances he seems like 10 years younger because he's so unwirly

[01:31:04.970 --> 01:31:07.470]
You know, he's like a little huh. Why do you say that?

[01:31:08.030 --> 01:31:10.270]
Because it's true. Oh, he doesn't

[01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:14.610]
Well, I don't know he's not a man of the world in other words. He doesn't command

[01:31:14.610 --> 01:31:18.330]
I'm not not gonna be doesn't command what you'd say a great presence yet

[01:31:18.330 --> 01:31:23.630]
He's working on it. He's moving his web to letter. He's sucking his way to the top, but he's not uh, you know

[01:31:23.630 --> 01:31:28.790]

This is really turning into a trying experience. I hate this place. I mean we are trying

[01:32:38.430 --> 01:32:43.850]
But it's showing you a really a trying experience 1056 at 560 q a.m. Your trying station

[01:32:49.410 --> 01:32:56.330]
Well, let me tell you something my crud Nick Ryan, Mr. President if you will

Come on, Senators

[01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:04.690]
Senator dole wouldn't it be better to have the deficit? That's not a bad idea

[01:33:04.690 --> 01:33:07.110]
It gives us $400 billion to believe

[01:33:07.650 --> 01:33:14.010]
Maybe even for the Clinton library perfect leadership is about bad economics and can you believe women's right?

[01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:20.770]
Because we're stronger. I hear you're looking for one look. Let's give up our Homeland Security Education Social Security and Medicare

[01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:33.470]
Yeah, that's true, and he don't even have a name, right?

[01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:36.570]
All right, well, we know his last name was easily, but we don't know his first name

Terrified of me scared schmittless of me, but they pick on a little people like been or boy guys who make it like

You know 250 an hour

[01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:23.850]
Anybody can do that just like the Humper back in his surly day

[01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:29.810]
Remember those days picking on the board ops picking on those little sports nerd kids, you know, and I cured him of that

He thought I think he like here you are

[01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:13.410]
He's a little late for the little while right now. He's in the South Pacific somewhere and he's got that thing around his neck

[01:36:13.410 --> 01:36:14.410]
He's got a little late

[01:36:15.910 --> 01:36:21.730]

[01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:30.670]
Joe Carrillo up into a point

[01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:37.050]

Turner to counterfeit so it's got like peach and peach and blue in the background

[01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:47.230]
Which you have to look really hard to see it, you know

[01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:52.110]
As peaches at the treasure island in this afternoon, if you'll tell you about it

Eric is right on top of it. He's so sick and tired of playing the

[01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:03.330]
Taking back seat to be an herb boy

[01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:06.710]
Even though be an herb is the one that put our website on a map

[01:37:07.330 --> 01:37:12.030]
Your all-time favorite character for movies but it was only a couple of votes on her so far. Tony Montana's got three

James Bond oh, now where did that come from?

[01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:21.590]
It says James Bond and in parentheses Sean Connery. I guess it's a holdover

[01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:25.250]
What do you mean when when they thought we were doing that?

[01:37:38.890 --> 01:37:40.870]

[01:37:52.850 --> 01:37:56.610]
You know all are you not happy with that because it's like splits it up. I don't care. I'm fine

[01:37:57.150 --> 01:38:00.430]

[01:38:01.290 --> 01:38:04.570]

A James Bonding session he feet apart with a wall in between us, but it was a

[01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:29.650]
Instead of the usual glare there was like a little nod like an acknowledgement of each other's existence like we're breaking through to cold war

[01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:30.910]
Don't do it again

[01:38:31.730 --> 01:38:36.790]

You know from midnight cowboy. I was gonna call you yesterday when we were doing lines

[01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:04.390]
On the movie we were doing lines yesterday

[01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:10.570]
I got good binoculars. I see you guys anyway

[01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:17.250]
Ratso you see all I'm watching here. I'm walking here remember we slammed us in on the taxi

[01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:23.390]
And that that was a pretty good line. I used to hear people come up with that and

[01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:32.550]
I just want to see guy have one more and it's just I draw for just a vanish. Well, thank god for that. Have a great day, pal. Thank you. Okay, you too

[01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:38.270]
I said ratchet original long time ago, but I don't think we ever put it down. See I'm not writing them all down

[01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:44.210]
So I'm depending on you guys. It's all there James Bond Sean Connery for now. Did we put James Connery Roger Moore?

[01:39:44.870 --> 01:39:46.790]
Did we give them that option James Connery

[01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:49.230]
James Connery Sean Moore

[01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:56.190]
See I don't see that on there. Well nobody's gonna vote for that anyway anybody thinks that Roger Moore is the best James Bond

[01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:59.830]
Go away. Okay. We don't like you. There's a lot of them go have a date with rich factor

[01:39:59.830 --> 01:40:02.110]
We still like rich factor. He don't want you to take it personal

[01:40:02.110 --> 01:40:05.590]
But you know don't act like so been out of shape rich you just getting a lot of control

[01:40:06.090 --> 01:40:10.790]
So like anything else every now and then when you get out of control you have to be slapped back into a shape a little bit

[01:40:11.830 --> 01:40:14.430]
Favorite character p-ro tool as Lawrence of Arabia

[01:40:26.910 --> 01:40:28.270]
How's Edie Gorm doing?

[01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:34.470]
It's actually somebody who wants to eat Gorm on television. I can't remember who it was. Oh, I didn't find Ed Wilber

[01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:36.550]
But I found Ed Sullivan at the movie place

[01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:40.550]
And it's true story they have the old Ed Sullivan TV shows

[01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:43.530]
Did I get it? No, but it was a really big shoe

[01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:48.170]
What there's a guy talk about a man with no talent. He that's a good pull. We've done that before

[01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:54.130]
Person dead or alive with the least talent who made it the biggest Ed Sullivan

[01:40:54.130 --> 01:40:58.030]
He was just a columnist just a flucky calmness for the near one of the York papers

[01:40:58.490 --> 01:41:01.090]
New York mirror one of those defunct the newspapers

[01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.990]
And all of a sudden he was on television

[01:41:05.970 --> 01:41:13.470]
Yeah, did you ever watch any of those old? I absolutely an idea someone to explain that I mean you talk about the amateur

[01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:16.530]
He was a stiff as a two by four. He was I mean

[01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.010]
He had the personality of a dead man

[01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:22.170]
He like even Al Gore is like a Mexican jumping being compared to Ed Sullivan

[01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:24.810]
And he's like grandma used to call him Ed Solomon. She thought he was Jewish

[01:41:26.250 --> 01:41:31.930]

[01:42:52.630 --> 01:42:57.250]
I'm only 59 years old but I can't believe somebody hasn't mentioned Rhett Butler

[01:42:58.270 --> 01:42:59.990]
Well they haven't

[01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:04.570]
Well you have to apologize for that he was a great one of the all-time most memorable characters

[01:43:05.170 --> 01:43:07.950]

[01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.710]

Well Rhett Butler will put on her he'll get one anyway. What's who's your favorite all-time character from the movies?

[01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:38.450]
Not your top 10 not your top five we're limiting you to just a few

[01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:40.630]
Your top 30 favorites

[01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:44.730]
That should take us to about seven o'clock Sunday morning

[01:43:46.430 --> 01:43:49.010]
660 pound man hoisted the hospital by crane

[01:43:50.050 --> 01:43:51.810]
Farman in Germany. This is from Berlin

[01:43:52.730 --> 01:43:57.230]
Farman in Germany had to use a 38 and a half ton crane to hoisted German man

[01:43:57.230 --> 01:44:01.850]
When 660 pounds out of his apartment and take him to hospital the fire brigade in the northern city

[01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:03.550]
Oh, this was in Hamburg said on Monday

[01:44:04.410 --> 01:44:07.090]
Because the man was so heavy we couldn't carry him on one of the normal stretches

[01:44:07.090 --> 01:44:10.450]
So we had to use the cranes at Hamburg fire brigade spokesman John Rolfs

[01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:14.790]
10 firemen were needed to lift a 60-year-old man out of a hospital

[01:44:14.790 --> 01:44:16.590]
They placed inside a large industrial container

[01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:19.730]
Which the crane and hoisted level in his first floor balcony

[01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:26.150]
The crane then lowered the container to the ground and the man was wheeled off and it jacked into an ambulance van and taken the hospital

[01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:31.710]
Is that is that and we wondered where fat boy was now we know I don't know he was in Hamburg

[01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:34.890]
And by the way you people in Hamburg change your name

[01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:38.570]
Because we don't want to get those people upset

[01:44:40.370 --> 01:44:42.370]
Change it to like a fine foot. Oh, that's not great

[01:44:43.530 --> 01:44:47.690]
Well, and I saw this thing about the world's first inflatable church. It was on CBS even in news last night

[01:44:47.690 --> 01:44:51.710]
Dan Rather was kind of chuckling and chircling in the smircling when he put it on there you see it no

[01:44:51.710 --> 01:44:55.830]
I heard it blows though and like all other churches it blows all religions it blows

[01:44:57.730 --> 01:45:00.210]
Too bad Peter Lockford and J. K. R here to work on it

[01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:08.270]
The world's first inflatable church opened its Gothic arches to worshipers on Tuesday and Escher England to reveal a blown up organ

[01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:09.290]
Oh, I see no

[01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:13.890]
A polyvinyl pulpit an airfield altar and a fake stained glass windows

[01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:18.310]
An airfield altar while wonder if they also have to blow up the altar boys

[01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:24.750]
The church is the brainchild of British entrepreneur Michael Gill. He's he's tortlin again

[01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:26.350]
Hope he never buy it. He's chucklin

[01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:32.750]
A priest could carry it around on the back of a truck and set it up on patches of grass or in village squares for impromptu services

[01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:37.050]
And he says it could breathe new life into Christianity by letting preachers take their message in their communities

[01:45:37.050 --> 01:45:40.250]
And blow whatever the hell they want blow as much as they want well. That's great

[01:45:41.950 --> 01:45:44.170]
I guess you never heard our good friend Terry Griffin, huh

[01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:50.450]
Whatever happened to Terry she still work over there. You know what she said if you blow too much you're in trouble

[01:45:51.070 --> 01:45:54.570]
She's still over there with the the Cox people far as I know I hope not for her say

Shocking off, shock, shock, shock,

[01:48:07.490 --> 01:48:09.310]
the Iraqi's don't like it.

[01:48:10.890 --> 01:48:14.390]
Shocking off, shock, shock, shock,

[01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:16.810]
by order of the presidents.

[01:48:18.070 --> 01:48:20.890]
We move our troops along the crowd

[01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:24.830]
and generate expo jobs.

[01:48:25.790 --> 01:48:28.290]
Confusing to confound

[01:48:29.830 --> 01:48:31.690]
the other side tactics

[01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:36.070]
to stop us with our human shields.

[01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:39.430]
But our mission will be finished and

[01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:42.610]
until we steal the royal fates.

[01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:46.810]
We're Iraqi's don't like it.

[01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:51.250]

[01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:01.810]
weapon, I paid at $5.60.

[01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:04.750]
This poll today is going over like Halafai in Bosnia.

[01:49:05.490 --> 01:49:07.550]
I just don't think that I told you right from the get-go.

[01:49:07.630 --> 01:49:09.270]
It was just something filled a little off.

[01:49:10.590 --> 01:49:12.730]
Corp, maybe that was when Clarence caught

[01:49:12.730 --> 01:49:14.230]
came in this morning and gave us the bad news

[01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:17.070]
that the Farellas were placing Mo on Monday in the morning show.

[01:49:18.610 --> 01:49:19.590]
Farell and Cali!

[01:49:21.450 --> 01:49:23.830]
Don't you think that there's a little something strange

[01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:25.410]
about that combination of voices?

[01:49:26.270 --> 01:49:27.730]
I wouldn't say strange.

[01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:29.730]
No, I call it harmony.

[01:49:30.390 --> 01:49:31.650]
Corian Miami says,

[01:49:31.890 --> 01:49:34.010]
Doc Holliday in Tombstone played by Val Kilmer.

[01:49:34.110 --> 01:49:35.070]
Should we put Doc Holliday?

[01:49:35.290 --> 01:49:35.690]
Sure, why not?

[01:49:36.210 --> 01:49:38.030]
Let's get it on there right away, okay?

[01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:41.990]
Somebody faxes this about the FCC June 2nd

[01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:44.190]
planning authorizing sweeping changes to the news media,

[01:49:44.190 --> 01:49:46.250]
which we've talked about at Ad infinitum.

[01:49:47.670 --> 01:49:49.910]
It says, join me in asking Congress and the FCC

[01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:52.310]
to support a diverse competitive media landscape.

[01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:59.290]
I'm going to this website, www.mov.noin1wardmoveon.org slash

[01:49:59.290 --> 01:50:00.330]
Stop the FCC.

[01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:04.390]
You can also automatically have your comments publicly filed at the FCC.

[01:50:04.970 --> 01:50:06.970]
Moveon.org. Got it.

[01:50:07.950 --> 01:50:12.370]
And also, two commissioners at the FCC as for a public hearing before the FCC votes

[01:50:12.370 --> 01:50:13.670]
on a controversial rule change.

[01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:17.130]
Commissioners Jonathan Adelstein and Michael Cops released a letter

[01:50:17.130 --> 01:50:20.550]
indicating they're seeking to postpone that key June 2nd meeting at the commission,

[01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:23.310]
at which the FCC is due to vote on media ownership caps.

[01:50:23.670 --> 01:50:27.250]
We believe a full notice and comment period on these specific proposals is warranted.

[01:50:27.490 --> 01:50:30.210]
Some policy making, perhaps even law requires no less,

[01:50:30.630 --> 01:50:33.490]
the two democratic appointed commissioners said in a joint statement.

[01:50:35.610 --> 01:50:39.210]
And the meantime, Michael Pals is, ah, you know, we're going ahead.

[01:50:39.770 --> 01:50:40.990]
There's three Republicans, two Democrats.

[01:50:41.210 --> 01:50:41.830]
You think they're going to wait?

[01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:42.050]
No.

[01:50:42.130 --> 01:50:43.570]
No, they want to get this through for their good buddies,

[01:50:43.570 --> 01:50:45.670]
Rupert Murdoch, Chief Channel, all of these people.

[01:50:46.510 --> 01:50:47.990]
All of the people that they're in bed on.

[01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:50.890]
So we have like two or three organizations that control all the radio,

[01:50:51.030 --> 01:50:54.670]
all the TV, all the newspapers, and they can pull whatever kind of fashions propaganda out

[01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:56.870]
that makes them a lot of money and makes the government happy.

[01:50:57.990 --> 01:51:00.730]
This unsigned facts from somebody obviously very psychotic.

[01:51:01.390 --> 01:51:03.750]
For the last few days, I wish you've been doing polls on all these movies,

[01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:06.950]
but no one has mentioned probably the most powerful movie made in recent history,

[01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:08.390]
and that is John Q.

[01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:10.270]
What?

[01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:11.330]
Never saw it.

[01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:12.550]
Never heard of it?

[01:51:12.930 --> 01:51:14.510]
Ah, yeah, I have heard of it.

[01:51:14.590 --> 01:51:16.750]
Says this movie had to made.

[01:51:18.430 --> 01:51:19.730]
This movie had to made.

[01:51:19.730 --> 01:51:21.050]
Oh, is that the Denzel Washington one?

[01:51:21.250 --> 01:51:21.890]
Yeah, I saw it.

[01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:25.250]
Well, you don't sound too enthusiastic about it.

[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.730]
It was fine.

[01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:28.130]
It was just okay.

[01:51:28.430 --> 01:51:28.590]
Yeah.

[01:51:29.730 --> 01:51:33.630]
It says if you haven't seen it, it's a must see so everyone can see how great our medical system is,

[01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:37.030]
and how much the country cares about kids, and how much they look out for people who aren't filthy rich.

[01:51:37.310 --> 01:51:38.890]
How about the hospital with George C. Scott?

[01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.950]
That should say everything you need.

[01:51:39.950 --> 01:51:41.090]
No, that's 100 years ago.

[01:51:41.250 --> 01:51:43.910]
That was also a Patty Chaefsky movie like Network, and very good.

[01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:46.390]
It says both these political parties suck.

[01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:47.890]
All they do is having this chasing car.

[01:51:48.070 --> 01:51:50.850]
I don't know whether that says tails or balls, but I think both would be accurate.

[01:51:51.110 --> 01:51:52.250]
Neither party cares about us.

[01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:55.770]
And like I tell you, they both suck, but one is much more malignant than the other one.

[01:51:56.250 --> 01:51:58.190]
That's why they look at the FCC right there.

[01:51:58.330 --> 01:51:59.410]
There's a classic example.

[01:52:01.290 --> 01:52:04.830]
Democratic party sucks, but they suck less, and they're much less dangerous than the Republicans.

[01:52:05.650 --> 01:52:08.770]
Three Republicans on the FCC, and you watch June 2nd.

[01:52:08.770 --> 01:52:13.070]
They'll pass through whatever they want for the benefit of their good buddies,

[01:52:13.170 --> 01:52:15.970]
and speaking of that, right in line with that, and another one of our bedtime stories today,

[01:52:16.410 --> 01:52:19.690]
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Upgraded His Food Your Earnings Forecasts

[01:52:19.690 --> 01:52:24.010]
after a strong film and television performance helped its third quarter results beat expectations.

[01:52:24.410 --> 01:52:24.950]
How do you like that?

[01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:29.430]
The global media also upgraded its Food Your Earnings expectations both to the group,

[01:52:29.570 --> 01:52:32.470]
and its 80.6% owned Fox Entertainment Group.

[01:52:33.670 --> 01:52:36.650]
And it goes on with the other, uh, this other not-seen numbers.

[01:52:36.650 --> 01:52:38.070]
Okay, obscene numbers.

[01:52:40.530 --> 01:52:43.430]
5.670560, pawn 5.60 on the AT&T.

[01:52:43.430 --> 01:52:44.490]
Somebody said, Lord Helmet.

[01:52:45.590 --> 01:52:46.570]
It's Dark Helmet.

[01:52:47.410 --> 01:52:48.070]
Rupert Murdoch.

[01:52:48.510 --> 01:52:49.930]
Dark Helmet from Spaceballs.

[01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.750]
Well, it says Lord Helmet, so let's put Dark Helmet.

[01:52:52.830 --> 01:52:53.610]
Let's put Dark Vader.

[01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:59.150]
Inspector Kusso is winning hands down, and that's an excellent choice, okay?

[01:52:59.730 --> 01:53:01.810]
All-time favorite character from the movies, right now.

[01:53:02.050 --> 01:53:04.850]
Is that the Peter Sellers' Wonders? That's the one played by Ed Jimmy Lee Curtis.

[01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:07.230]
It's the cartoon one from the Pink Panther Carchants.

[01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.450]
Oh!

[01:53:08.370 --> 01:53:16.350]
Inspector Kusso 24, James Bond, John Cottery, 12, Darth Vader 9, Tony Montana 8, Don Corleone 7, Michael Corleone 7.

[01:53:17.050 --> 01:53:29.670]
Gunnery Sargent Hartman from Full Metal Jacket 7, Forest Dump 6, Hannibal Lecter 5, Dirty Harry Callahan's got 5, Carl Spackler, Caddyshack 5, Josie Wales 4, Frank Booth has got 3,

[01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:32.850]
and you know who probably doesn't have any?

[01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:34.610]
Let me just look.

[01:53:35.090 --> 01:53:37.030]
James Bond, Roger Moore, he don't have any good.

[01:53:38.310 --> 01:53:39.670]
Bella, oh no!

[01:53:41.670 --> 01:53:43.790]
Bella, go see Dracula, has 0.

[01:53:47.930 --> 01:53:48.330]
Yeah.

[01:53:49.050 --> 01:53:51.010]
And I'm looking, and Gary Olben's got 1.

[01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:55.130]
You know what I think of that?

[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:56.690]
Makes me want to barf.

[01:53:56.750 --> 01:53:57.670]
Makes me want to barf.

[01:53:57.670 --> 01:53:58.630]
I think it's a generational thing.

[01:53:59.870 --> 01:54:03.210]
I think you think that everybody from the age of 3 all the way up to...

[01:54:03.210 --> 01:54:04.070]
Not third man!

[01:54:04.230 --> 01:54:09.410]
Hasn't seen Dracula, the original 1932 version, Todd Browning, a direct, a Bella, go see stars.

[01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:11.870]
What's about a time I would have thought everybody'd seen it, but lately?

[01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.410]
No.

[01:54:14.110 --> 01:54:14.950]
What do you mean by that?

[01:54:15.850 --> 01:54:18.470]
People aren't watching those old movies anymore, I'm finding out.

[01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:20.370]
How about Frank and Stein?

[01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:21.130]
Likewise.

[01:54:23.310 --> 01:54:25.570]
Oh, maybe that's part of the problem we got in America today.

[01:54:25.650 --> 01:54:27.050]
Nobody knows what the hell it's all about, right?

[01:54:27.050 --> 01:54:27.570]
It's very sad.

[01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:30.370]
If you haven't seen Dracula with Bella, go see...

[01:54:30.370 --> 01:54:32.230]
You think you're just going through life.

[01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:33.170]
You just go through the motions.

[01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:35.850]
Those old movies were boring.

[01:54:36.110 --> 01:54:37.590]
They don't look like the effects aren't very...

[01:54:37.590 --> 01:54:37.810]
Right.

[01:54:37.990 --> 01:54:38.970]
Black and white.

[01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:42.010]
In fact, that's what made the special effects right in there was the...

[01:54:42.010 --> 01:54:44.830]
The fact that the time of it and it was phenomenal.

[01:54:46.050 --> 01:54:48.550]
That's what it was known for was those amazing special effects.

[01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:50.270]
Way to help back there in the early 30s.

[01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:51.310]
For Christ's sakes.

[01:54:52.670 --> 01:54:54.610]
But hey, listen, like Boeena Boy keeps saying,

[01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:57.430]
Bran Stoker's Dracula with, you know, Gary Oldman.

[01:54:59.270 --> 01:55:00.410]
Here's a call from Melbourne.

[01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:00.750]
Hello.

[01:55:01.310 --> 01:55:02.110]
Yeah, I want to know.

[01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.790]
Yes, sir.

[01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:06.790]
Yeah, how about the effect of Danny Riggs from the lethal weapon theory?

[01:55:08.330 --> 01:55:09.230]
Detective what?

[01:55:09.970 --> 01:55:10.630]
Danny Riggs.

[01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:12.970]
Leaple weapon.

[01:55:14.850 --> 01:55:15.810]
Danny Riggs.

[01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:16.790]
Riggs.

[01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:20.330]
Was he related to Jack Riggs that caused the races in Detroit?

[01:55:20.950 --> 01:55:21.870]
I don't think so.

[01:55:22.130 --> 01:55:22.490]
Okay.

[01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:24.230]
Okay, got it down pal, thanks.

[01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:25.090]
Thanks, Uncle Neil.

[01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:27.270]
You got that down, Danny Riggs?

[01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.670]
We do.

[01:55:28.090 --> 01:55:28.710]
Never heard of it.

[01:55:29.230 --> 01:55:31.610]
See what we know about movies you've put in a Thimble Act as.

[01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.790]
Do that again.

[01:55:35.310 --> 01:55:37.290]
1127 at 560 WDQM.

[01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:41.370]
Balance for life is the way you want to do that again and again because you'll watch the way it pour off your body.

[01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:42.290]
You'll be fully satisfied.

[01:55:42.370 --> 01:55:43.550]
You'll have a smile on your foot.

[01:55:43.550 --> 01:55:48.810]
And maybe for the first time in your life you'll feel like you're succeeding where you failed on all the other diets, all the other crap.

[01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:52.890]
And I do mean crap because the programs where they have the little containers of stuff.

[01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:55.670]
I don't want to mention neutral systems by name or Ginny Craig.

[01:55:55.890 --> 01:55:57.530]
You know where they have the prefabricated food.

[01:55:57.770 --> 01:55:58.530]
Forget about it.

[01:55:58.650 --> 01:55:59.870]
As Donnie Brasco would say.

[01:56:00.570 --> 01:56:02.710]
Get yourself some real food from balance for life.

[01:56:02.850 --> 01:56:12.270]
Everything is fresh and delicious and they deliver it right to your door in a little black sack by six o'clock in the morning to your home, to your work, to your pup tent, to your massage parlour wherever you are at six o'clock in the morning.

[01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:14.530]
And inside your black sack there where it all is.

[01:56:14.710 --> 01:56:18.950]
Three gourmet meals, two delicious snacks, everything fresh and great tasting and good for you.

[01:56:19.270 --> 01:56:21.350]
And it's all balanced out on the zone diet principles.

[01:56:21.810 --> 01:56:22.590]
And you don't do anything.

[01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:23.530]
You don't count calories.

[01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:24.690]
You don't count the carbohydrates.

[01:56:25.190 --> 01:56:26.750]
Milk cooking, no shopping, no meal preparing.

[01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:31.930]
All you do is check off between two choices for each meal every day that you're on a program on the menu that they send you every week.

[01:56:31.930 --> 01:56:32.370]
And that's it.

[01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:34.750]
So get yourself with a real weight loss program.

[01:56:34.930 --> 01:56:36.950]
Not some crazy or aggressive diet regimen.

[01:56:37.490 --> 01:56:41.650]
Get yourself the weight pouring off your body and start feeling better and getting some real clothing once in a while too.

[01:56:41.650 --> 01:56:42.670]
Balance for life.

[01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:44.290]

560-W-Q-A-M presents the O.P. and Anthony Shaw with Mo Howard David.

[01:57:16.730 --> 01:57:17.670]
This is O.P.

[01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:18.470]
And I'm Anthony.

[01:57:18.810 --> 01:57:19.290]
Yeah, wait a minute.

[01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:20.710]
It's me with a low voice.

[01:57:20.910 --> 01:57:21.110]
Oh.

[01:57:21.290 --> 01:57:22.810]
Yeah, you got the effect at point.

[01:57:22.910 --> 01:57:23.190]
Okay.

[01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:24.590]
Hi Anthony.

[01:57:24.770 --> 01:57:27.750]
Yeah, hi, I hope you and let's not forget a old pal Mo Howard David.

[01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:31.190]
Yeah, I was wondering how long it would take for you to punch the girl around for me.

[01:57:31.410 --> 01:57:32.910]
I really hit the big time, huh?

[01:57:33.170 --> 01:57:34.810]
Here I am with the O.P. on Anthony.

[01:57:35.050 --> 01:57:35.390]
Am I?

[01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:35.870]
What?

[01:57:36.150 --> 01:57:36.850]
Take off your pants.

[01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:38.050]
Yeah, we're gonna rape you now.

[01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:39.910]
You cut a big cut in me.

[01:57:40.090 --> 01:57:41.150]
This is a family show.

[01:57:41.370 --> 01:57:42.110]
And wrong.

[01:57:42.530 --> 01:57:44.090]
This is the Gopian Anthony show.

[01:57:44.270 --> 01:57:44.750]
Now come on.

[01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:46.490]
I thought you guys only did that in touch.

[01:57:46.810 --> 01:57:48.090]
Hey, get your hands up.

[01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:49.330]
Get out of there.

[01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.750]
Get out of there.

[01:57:50.330 --> 01:57:51.070]
That's what you're doing.

[01:57:51.070 --> 01:57:53.690]
I'm gonna scratch my delegates on the tender.

[01:57:54.690 --> 01:57:56.270]
Why does everybody want a rapey?

[01:57:56.290 --> 01:57:56.430]
Why?

[01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:58.250]
Because we think it's funny, that's why.

[01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:59.830]
Yeah, you got a nice back.

[01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:01.370]
Oh, I got loose for you, Cully.

[01:58:01.730 --> 01:58:02.650]
I'm still sprying.

[01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:05.150]
Why, I oughta formalize you.

[01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.430]

[01:58:06.510 --> 01:58:08.230]
I got a sense tied, O.P.

[01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:09.690]
I want the red ball.

[01:58:09.850 --> 01:58:10.430]
I'm not for this.

[01:58:11.050 --> 01:58:12.730]
All right, my open wife, we're junkies.

[01:58:12.750 --> 01:58:14.290]
Let's sing that together now, shall we?

[01:58:14.590 --> 01:58:14.870]
Okay.

[01:58:15.330 --> 01:58:17.230]
Open my four junkies.

[01:58:17.670 --> 01:58:18.570]
All right.

[01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:19.750]
That's making it, Anthony.

[01:58:19.950 --> 01:58:20.230]
Okay.

[01:58:21.530 --> 01:58:22.570]
Yeah, that's...

[01:58:23.230 --> 01:58:24.530]
Yeah, use your lips.

[01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:26.370]
Don't you...

[01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:27.070]
Don't sit up.

[01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:28.350]
I said no, please.

[01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:30.290]
All right, ready for some spitty below.

[01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:30.990]
Yeah.

[01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:33.090]
You're not supposed to mean that.

[01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.750]
Yeah.

[01:58:34.170 --> 01:58:36.310]
I really saw that little bitchie right now.

[01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.570]
I don't know.

[01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:37.490]
I'm poor like him.

[01:58:37.690 --> 01:58:37.870]
Yeah.

[01:58:38.870 --> 01:58:39.590]
Not bad.

[01:58:42.210 --> 01:58:42.730]
Okay.

[01:58:43.410 --> 01:58:44.350]
Take that away, Mo.

[01:58:45.170 --> 01:58:45.690]
Yeah.

[01:58:46.650 --> 01:58:47.170]
Thanks.

[01:58:48.690 --> 01:58:49.050]
What?

[01:58:49.650 --> 01:58:50.930]
You're just going to leave me here.

[01:58:52.830 --> 01:58:53.830]
We'll be right back.

[01:58:55.610 --> 01:58:55.970]
Okay.

[01:58:56.250 --> 01:58:58.050]
See, I didn't forget to accept that off there, you notice?

[01:58:59.430 --> 01:58:59.890]
Yeah, I noticed.

[01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:03.150]
1134, 26, Tullo, 560, WDQM.

[01:59:03.230 --> 01:59:05.430]
Jack Nicholson's Jack Torrance in the Shining.

[01:59:06.710 --> 01:59:08.850]
Till this day, I never knew what the name of that character was.

[01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:10.010]
At least I'd forgotten it.

[01:59:10.450 --> 01:59:11.030]
Did you know the name?

[01:59:11.290 --> 01:59:11.470]
Sure.

[01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:13.930]
Okay, smart ass.

[01:59:14.230 --> 01:59:14.770]
Oh, my Jack.

[01:59:14.770 --> 01:59:15.190]
I liked the movie.

[01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:15.970]
I thought a bunch of times.

[01:59:16.730 --> 01:59:19.650]
My favorite movie says Hector, Tarzan, Wajani, Weissmutter.

[01:59:20.070 --> 01:59:22.390]
I think he just wants him to throw him to the loins.

[01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:25.570]
We're not putting that down.

[01:59:25.770 --> 01:59:26.150]
Tarzan.

[01:59:26.290 --> 01:59:27.670]
I put it down anyway, Tarzan.

[01:59:28.090 --> 01:59:30.690]
Probably got a lot of food cakes out there vote for that, including Hector.

[01:59:32.670 --> 01:59:36.590]
Inspector Clousseau, 31, Sean Connerty, James Bond, 23.

[01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:37.930]
In fact, just to prove a point.

[01:59:40.090 --> 01:59:41.310]
Let me go down the list.

[01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:42.350]
Let me just scroll.

[01:59:42.450 --> 01:59:43.810]
We got almost 200 votes on there already.

[01:59:43.810 --> 01:59:44.690]
What shocks the Hottomi.

[01:59:45.150 --> 01:59:46.290]
And Roger Moore's got two.

[01:59:46.570 --> 01:59:47.010]
You following?

[01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:48.130]
You see the difference?

[01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:49.770]
We're not arguing the same point.

[01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:52.750]
Sean Connerty, 23, and Roger Moore, two.

[01:59:53.210 --> 01:59:57.010]
Because when people think of the character James Bond, they think of Sean Connerty.

[01:59:57.370 --> 01:59:58.230]
Not Roger Moore.

[01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.630]
Right.

[01:59:58.970 --> 02:00:00.650]
Roger Moore, they think of he was the saint.

[02:00:01.630 --> 02:00:02.470]
Remember the saint?

[02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:04.550]
That's who he is.

[02:00:04.810 --> 02:00:04.970]
Yeah.

[02:00:05.810 --> 02:00:07.290]
John Corleone, 11.

[02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:11.590]
And the reason that John Corleone didn't do a better than that is because in the Godfather,

[02:00:11.590 --> 02:00:17.130]
there were so many great performances and great characters that it divides it up.

[02:00:17.130 --> 02:00:18.830]
For example, Michael Corleone, he's got eight.

[02:00:19.530 --> 02:00:19.810]
You see?

[02:00:19.990 --> 02:00:21.030]
See how it gets divided down?

[02:00:22.610 --> 02:00:23.470]
How about Frank Clemens'?

[02:00:23.630 --> 02:00:24.550]
Clemens, I have any votes?

[02:00:29.630 --> 02:00:30.150]
I'm looking.

[02:00:32.510 --> 02:00:33.630]
Is he even on there?

[02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:34.930]
Clemens?

[02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:35.190]
Yeah.

[02:00:36.170 --> 02:00:36.610]
He's got to see.

[02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:37.190]
He's got to appear.

[02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:39.730]
So you put those all together and he'd be right in the running Godfather.

[02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:42.050]
But there's just too many great characters in there.

[02:00:42.190 --> 02:00:43.010]
How about Howard Beale?

[02:00:43.090 --> 02:00:43.870]
How's Howard Beale doing?

[02:00:43.970 --> 02:00:44.590]
That's got my vote.

[02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:45.750]
He's probably got one.

[02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:51.030]
Dude, there's so damn many on here.

[02:00:51.130 --> 02:00:51.730]
There's like a million.

[02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:52.690]
But third man.

[02:00:52.910 --> 02:00:53.550]
I can't even get him there.

[02:00:54.110 --> 02:00:54.750]
He's got what?

[02:00:55.130 --> 02:00:55.610]
He got one.

[02:00:55.630 --> 02:00:57.490]
I need to bet considering this crowd.

[02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:00.810]
But Inspector Clousseau so far is leading the pack.

[02:01:02.130 --> 02:01:04.610]
He's at the head of this pack, which I think makes a lot of sense.

[02:01:04.610 --> 02:01:05.990]
That's what Rich Packter said.

[02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:10.130]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T line.

[02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:11.850]
Here's Paul Hokey.

[02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.990]
Hello?

[02:01:12.750 --> 02:01:13.490]
Yeah, Neil.

[02:01:13.730 --> 02:01:17.950]
How about the character that Bill Bothore and Blade and Swing Blade?

[02:01:21.650 --> 02:01:22.970]
And what character was that?

[02:01:23.590 --> 02:01:24.670]
I can't remember.

[02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:27.830]
What character was that, George?

[02:01:28.450 --> 02:01:28.650]
Carl.

[02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:31.850]
We were all personally put on there.

[02:01:32.130 --> 02:01:32.850]
He's got three votes.

[02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.970]
He's got three votes.

[02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:35.190]
Okay.

[02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:36.270]
He's on there, Polly.

[02:01:36.350 --> 02:01:37.830]
I'll see if that Diner and Poohke were there.

[02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:38.770]
Got that good sherry pie.

[02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:41.150]
56670.

[02:01:46.130 --> 02:01:48.370]
I don't know how Poohkey has grown over the years.

[02:01:48.450 --> 02:01:49.510]
You know, Poohke and Amokhaly.

[02:01:49.730 --> 02:01:50.010]
It grew.

[02:01:50.090 --> 02:01:50.830]
Not Amokhaly.

[02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.690]
What's the other one?

[02:01:52.170 --> 02:01:52.890]
Oh, Kichobi.

[02:01:53.590 --> 02:01:54.630]
They're side by each.

[02:01:55.770 --> 02:02:01.110]
When I was working at WJN-1975, 28 long, and I was almost at third man.

[02:02:01.110 --> 02:02:04.610]
I was broadcasting in the high school basketball.

[02:02:04.610 --> 02:02:07.170]
We had a game where I forget what school it was.

[02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:09.070]
Sunset, the high, something in West Palm.

[02:02:09.470 --> 02:02:11.730]
They were playing a football game, actually, it was.

[02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:14.310]
They were playing a team in Poohke.

[02:02:15.870 --> 02:02:19.310]
And we drove up to Poohkey and in the middle of town it was like a little Diner.

[02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:20.010]
That was it.

[02:02:20.110 --> 02:02:21.730]
That was the only restaurant in town in Poohkey.

[02:02:21.790 --> 02:02:22.570]
It was this Diner.

[02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:25.130]
And they had frozen-cherry pie.

[02:02:25.450 --> 02:02:28.470]
In fact, whenever there was like the first ice storm on a planet,

[02:02:29.690 --> 02:02:31.450]
that's when that pie was frozen.

[02:02:32.230 --> 02:02:33.590]
It was sure special.

[02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:36.150]
Even a lot more special than that corn and deliverance guarantee you that.

[02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:40.010]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a 18.

[02:02:40.190 --> 02:02:40.990]
It ever been to a Poohke?

[02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:43.090]
I've been a bi-line.

[02:02:43.690 --> 02:02:44.210]
Don't stop.

[02:02:44.590 --> 02:02:44.730]
Okay.

[02:02:44.950 --> 02:02:45.430]
Here's Miami.

[02:02:45.490 --> 02:02:45.750]
Hello.

[02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:47.650]
Yes, Neil.

[02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.390]
Yes, sir.

[02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:49.470]
How you doing?

[02:02:49.850 --> 02:02:50.410]
I'm doing good.

[02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:51.190]
Okay.

[02:02:51.550 --> 02:02:52.370]
I got one for you.

[02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:54.110]
I passed out to Gerald Patton.

[02:02:55.310 --> 02:02:56.330]
General Patton's good?

[02:02:56.430 --> 02:02:56.570]
Yes.

[02:02:57.430 --> 02:02:58.350]
George East Scott?

[02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:59.250]
George East Scott.

[02:02:59.930 --> 02:03:01.050]
Now, is that the one you like?

[02:03:01.190 --> 02:03:03.850]
Did you like George East Scott better than the one where Pinkie Lee played him?

[02:03:06.030 --> 02:03:07.490]
No, no, not exactly.

[02:03:07.890 --> 02:03:08.110]
Okay.

[02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:10.090]
He likes to be a George East Scott.

[02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:10.530]
Thank you.

[02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.390]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, see?

[02:03:12.490 --> 02:03:13.350]
You wouldn't know from Pinkie Lee.

[02:03:13.610 --> 02:03:15.270]
Boca-Briang got a charge out of that, though.

[02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:15.750]
That was cute.

[02:03:17.230 --> 02:03:18.610]
Pound 5, 60 on a 18.

[02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:19.930]
T and T and Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:03:20.590 --> 02:03:23.910]
Inspector Cluso 37, Sean Connery, James Bond, 26.

[02:03:24.110 --> 02:03:25.010]
Don Corleone, 13.

[02:03:26.030 --> 02:03:28.490]
Gunnery Sergeant Harman from Fullwell, Metal Jacket, 12.

[02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:30.050]
And 20 Montana's Got 10.

[02:03:32.170 --> 02:03:33.050]
Here's for a lot of deal.

[02:03:33.050 --> 02:03:33.290]
Hello.

[02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:35.190]
Neil, how you doing today?

[02:03:35.370 --> 02:03:35.530]
Great.

[02:03:36.090 --> 02:03:39.510]
First of all, don't stop making fun of Moe and that little easel.

[02:03:39.930 --> 02:03:40.230]
Anyway.

[02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:41.750]
Now, let me ask you this.

[02:03:41.890 --> 02:03:42.210]
What do you think?

[02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:43.650]
Do you know who Scott Forell is?

[02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:44.210]
Have you ever heard him?

[02:03:44.650 --> 02:03:44.810]
No.

[02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.330]
Who is it?

[02:03:45.370 --> 02:03:45.550]
Oh.

[02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:48.250]
So it could only be an improvement is what you're saying.

[02:03:48.850 --> 02:03:49.150]
Exactly.

[02:03:49.570 --> 02:03:51.170]
The room around here is that it starts Monday.

[02:03:52.670 --> 02:03:57.090]
Listen, how about Samuel Jackson and Paul Fiction, the gangster?

[02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:59.730]
No, it was character.

[02:04:00.110 --> 02:04:00.970]
Is it character have a name?

[02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.170]
Yeah.

[02:04:02.410 --> 02:04:02.530]
I know it.

[02:04:02.750 --> 02:04:02.750]

[02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:05.590]
I, George knows it.

[02:04:06.450 --> 02:04:07.330]
What is your favorite?

[02:04:07.790 --> 02:04:08.470]
He's just got a favorite.

[02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:09.130]
He doesn't know it.

[02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:09.770]
Yep.

[02:04:10.090 --> 02:04:11.090]
So we got to put that on.

[02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:13.150]
Well, that's the character's name, George.

[02:04:13.470 --> 02:04:14.350]
It's Jewels.

[02:04:14.930 --> 02:04:15.330]
Jewels.

[02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:16.150]
Jewels.

[02:04:16.810 --> 02:04:16.970]
Jewels.

[02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.910]
Jewels.

[02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.370]
Absolutely.

[02:04:18.370 --> 02:04:21.970]
I think that's going to get about 100 votes as soon as you put it on there.

[02:04:23.290 --> 02:04:26.370]
Now, is that J-U-L-E-S or J-E-W-L-E-S?

[02:04:26.370 --> 02:04:26.550]
J-U-L-E-S.

[02:04:26.710 --> 02:04:27.110]
Yeah, I'm Ellie.

[02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.850]
Just, okay.

[02:04:27.930 --> 02:04:28.510]
Thanks a lot, Polly.

[02:04:28.870 --> 02:04:29.130]
Thank you.

[02:04:29.850 --> 02:04:33.850]
John in Port St. Lucie says, I was thinking maybe it was as in family.

[02:04:35.210 --> 02:04:39.590]
When I opened Windows Media Play to listen to you, they're pushing a music video by a little moe any relation.

[02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.910]
What?

[02:04:43.170 --> 02:04:44.470]
Also, strange bedfellows.

[02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:48.790]
The NRA is also fighting the FCC changes because they're afraid of CBS and Disney.

[02:04:49.090 --> 02:04:53.430]
I guess Murdoch and Cheap Channel don't ponder enough to the NRA.

[02:04:53.590 --> 02:04:58.670]
They're not even happy with a bushmeister because we assault weapon band that he refuses.

[02:04:59.550 --> 02:05:04.030]
He says that he's going to like if they try to discontinue it, he's going to do everything in his power to like extend it.

[02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:10.030]
And the NRA said, oh no, and Tom Delay, who's chased all those Democrats out of the Texas legislature across the Oklahoma border.

[02:05:10.410 --> 02:05:12.130]
He's also the one that's screaming the older one.

[02:05:12.130 --> 02:05:14.090]
Oh no, oh no.

[02:05:14.790 --> 02:05:17.650]
I cannot believe that you sent me this fact.

[02:05:17.810 --> 02:05:18.070]
I can.

[02:05:19.190 --> 02:05:21.310]
And talk about my psychic powers.

[02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:24.850]
We were talking about Chronic's this morning before the show, George and I.

[02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:27.150]
And what did I say to you?

[02:05:27.190 --> 02:05:27.830]
Who did I mention?

[02:05:27.970 --> 02:05:30.950]
I used this person as the example.

[02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:33.430]
That's why I was sure to forward it without Delay.

[02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:36.690]
As the prime example of what Chronic's are all about.

[02:05:37.110 --> 02:05:39.430]
Chronic cars and Chronic faxes, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:42.530]
They are sick, sick, desperate people.

[02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:49.730]
I still say that each and every one of these people were going to tattoo it on their foreheads and sets it in an America right now.

[02:05:49.810 --> 02:05:50.370]
I have no life.

[02:05:50.490 --> 02:05:51.690]
That's it. That's all you need to know.

[02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:52.290]
I have no life.

[02:05:52.410 --> 02:05:56.370]
Right. Chronic's Chronic talk show callers, Chronic talk show faxers.

[02:05:56.850 --> 02:05:59.050]
And they're the death nail by the way of talk radio.

[02:05:59.210 --> 02:06:01.910]
That's one of the things that I mean why should they even have to say it?

[02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:06.030]
It would somebody says, how can surprise you didn't say that?

[02:06:06.610 --> 02:06:07.450]
Well, I already got my.

[02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:10.610]
This is our guy in Cleveland says it would Johnny Depp was great.

[02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:11.950]
Now, well, we shall let's put down it would.

[02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:14.690]
I was that Johnny Depp version was at the P.B. Herman one.

[02:06:17.150 --> 02:06:17.950]
19 till new.

[02:06:18.050 --> 02:06:19.990]
I'm delighted to see that Bella LaGrosse is moved ahead.

[02:06:20.130 --> 02:06:21.350]
That'll be where the battle will lie now.

[02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:22.730]
You know, just just for the hell of it.

[02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:26.190]
Because I said one thing and then Venus said the other.

[02:06:27.150 --> 02:06:28.730]
Dracula, Bella LaGrosse's got four.

[02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:31.930]
And I think the other one's got two.

[02:06:32.090 --> 02:06:33.470]
The Gary Oldman has got a pair.

[02:06:33.710 --> 02:06:34.470]
So I moved ahead of you.

[02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:35.010]
How do you like that?

[02:06:36.090 --> 02:06:37.550]
Just like I said in the facts.

[02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:38.210]
What?

[02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:41.010]
They don't know what they're talking about.

[02:06:42.130 --> 02:06:44.830]
You know, I think Raymond had a good point when he spoke to you yesterday.

[02:06:46.250 --> 02:06:47.550]
I think he made an excellent point.

[02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:50.770]
You better be on your best behavior if you know what's good for you.

[02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:52.050]
If you want that three and a quarter an hour.

[02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:56.170]
18 till noon at QAM if your ball spot is growing by the minute.

[02:06:56.450 --> 02:06:57.750]
A hell of a lot faster than your paycheck.

[02:06:58.190 --> 02:06:59.030]
Here's the answer for you.

[02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:02.990]
Get your hair back at a very reasonable price for my good buddy, check out the eerie.

[02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:05.690]
Even a millionaires go to Charlie, even though his price is very reasonable.

[02:07:05.790 --> 02:07:11.330]
Because no matter how much money they spend, they can't get a better looking head of hair than with Charlie's natural hairline system.

[02:07:11.570 --> 02:07:16.390]
It's using the latest technology to make you look better and younger than you guys ever dreamed you could again.

[02:07:16.470 --> 02:07:17.690]
That's why Charlie's been around damn near.

[02:07:17.990 --> 02:07:19.830]
You know how many years he's been in business by now?

[02:07:19.950 --> 02:07:20.990]
I would say close to it.

[02:07:21.550 --> 02:07:22.430]
Pretty close to it.

[02:07:22.950 --> 02:07:25.770]
And be sure to mention the arages when you call make your appointment with the Alphairry Studios.

[02:07:25.810 --> 02:07:29.110]
Because they'll knock an extra 200 bucks off the regular price when you mention my name.

[02:07:29.110 --> 02:07:30.050]
So the choices yours.

[02:07:30.710 --> 02:07:33.410]
They said you pills to get your hair to grow back and don't work.

[02:07:33.630 --> 02:07:36.010]
They said it was mostly looking muskrats like moewears.

[02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:36.830]
I mean forget about that.

[02:07:36.910 --> 02:07:37.290]
It's a joke.

[02:07:37.530 --> 02:07:40.250]
If you want a real great looking head of hair, there's only one guy can give it to you.

[02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:41.530]
And that's Chuck Alphairry.

[02:07:41.650 --> 02:07:42.310]
Call him tool free.

[02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.970]
There's no obligation.

[02:07:43.330 --> 02:07:44.370]
They give you a free consultation.

[02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:48.250]
They'll sit you down and actually show you how much better and younger they can help you guys look.

[02:07:48.450 --> 02:07:50.150]
Save it by to your ball spot once and for all.

[02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:53.110]
Call 1-800-321-2413.

[02:07:53.590 --> 02:07:56.070]
That's 1-800-321-2413.

[02:07:56.070 --> 02:07:59.550]
Or log onto their website at CharlesAlphairry.com.

[02:08:00.010 --> 02:08:01.690]
See you Monday and Law.

[02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:05.070]
This is sports 20 or faster than the QAM.

[02:08:07.110 --> 02:08:08.570]
They're dick in the White House.

[02:08:09.210 --> 02:08:11.890]
This old man dick Jamie.

[02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:14.890]
He had an G.O. Bastie.

[02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:15.930]
Had a heart attack.

[02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:16.730]
Had a whack.

[02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:17.850]
Got him a full stone.

[02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:20.850]
Next time he's not coming home.

[02:08:21.450 --> 02:08:22.870]
Hey, is the delight track?

[02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:25.750]
What's going on with this time with the president?

[02:08:26.170 --> 02:08:26.970]
Oh, yeah.

[02:08:27.930 --> 02:08:30.850]
This knit went his name's Bush.

[02:08:31.370 --> 02:08:33.770]
He's a hamproider in the Tush.

[02:08:34.010 --> 02:08:35.490]
He picked a guy who would die.

[02:08:35.670 --> 02:08:36.550]
So he'd be alone.

[02:08:36.610 --> 02:08:39.550]
There's nothing in his empty zone.

[02:08:39.810 --> 02:08:40.530]
All right.

[02:08:43.130 --> 02:08:44.170]
4K, 560.

[02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:46.610]
WMDQ on the Mad Dog coming up at 1 o'clock.

[02:08:46.810 --> 02:08:49.170]
Our big noon to 1 comedy bits are from 12 to 1.

[02:08:49.170 --> 02:08:50.310]
A fletch.

[02:08:51.150 --> 02:08:54.970]
Greatest movie character in the history of American film fletch says Richard Crenium.

[02:08:56.610 --> 02:08:57.130]
Got it?

[02:08:57.370 --> 02:08:59.170]
Got it.

[02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:00.870]
Mad Max.

[02:09:01.310 --> 02:09:01.790]
Mel Gibson.

[02:09:02.150 --> 02:09:03.430]
It says you have to love this guy.

[02:09:03.570 --> 02:09:04.430]
Lovely in the movie 2.

[02:09:04.530 --> 02:09:04.850]
Mel Gibson.

[02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.870]
Can't stand Mel Gibson but we'll put it on there.

[02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:07.410]
Mad Max.

[02:09:07.810 --> 02:09:07.950]
Right.

[02:09:08.690 --> 02:09:09.970]
And I'll give you this facts.

[02:09:10.230 --> 02:09:10.850]
Rhymes with Max.

[02:09:11.250 --> 02:09:11.690]
I don't even know.

[02:09:11.770 --> 02:09:13.570]
I don't know what to do with scream or peel my banana.

[02:09:14.650 --> 02:09:15.150]
You know?

[02:09:15.150 --> 02:09:17.770]
Because actually the facts make sense.

[02:09:19.110 --> 02:09:21.950]
But it's just such a classic example of what I tell you about there.

[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:24.130]
These people will never ever leave.

[02:09:24.290 --> 02:09:26.030]
They threaten you, piss us off.

[02:09:26.210 --> 02:09:27.490]
You hate us, you're your asshole.

[02:09:28.010 --> 02:09:29.750]
And they just never will leave.

[02:09:29.890 --> 02:09:31.570]
They will never ever ever.

[02:09:32.250 --> 02:09:33.710]
You know the crowd that I'm talking about.

[02:09:34.030 --> 02:09:34.390]
You know the ones?

[02:09:34.630 --> 02:09:34.790]
Yeah.

[02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:38.230]
Yeah.

[02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:40.310]
Well, he's the pivot man.

[02:09:40.750 --> 02:09:40.950]
Yeah.

[02:09:41.330 --> 02:09:42.190]
When they hold their meat.

[02:09:43.710 --> 02:09:44.390]
At Denny's.

[02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.850]
He's the pivot man.

[02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:47.710]
I'm not going to read it.

[02:09:47.850 --> 02:09:51.510]
I'm not going to read it because if I do it I'll encourage him and it'll be all over the place.

[02:09:51.650 --> 02:09:55.490]
So he encouraged me to watch a year ago or two years ago a Requiem for a Dream.

[02:09:55.750 --> 02:09:58.130]
But you see if I would have watched it then I wouldn't have watched it here recently.

[02:09:58.130 --> 02:09:59.290]
We wouldn't be talking about it now.

[02:09:59.510 --> 02:10:01.730]
I've talked about it a long time ago with you.

[02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:03.230]
I didn't bring it up again.

[02:10:04.170 --> 02:10:06.770]
Of course, why the hell would you since I hadn't seen it at that point?

[02:10:06.930 --> 02:10:06.930]

[02:10:07.170 --> 02:10:09.430]
Now that I've seen it now it's worth the talking about.

[02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:11.270]
And again, that's from my perspective.

[02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:14.030]
Because that's the only way I can see life is through my perspective.

[02:10:14.190 --> 02:10:14.930]
No, not through yours.

[02:10:15.170 --> 02:10:18.550]
Certainly not through a Bina Boy with his damn pony Dracula movie.

[02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:22.530]
See how anybody could say that and you know he's only doing that to aggravate.

[02:10:22.670 --> 02:10:23.210]
You know that.

[02:10:23.410 --> 02:10:23.530]
No.

[02:10:24.170 --> 02:10:28.070]
Because there's no way that anybody would say that Bram Stoker is Dracula.

[02:10:28.250 --> 02:10:30.970]
The Gary Olden version is better than the original.

[02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:32.410]
And what's the Gary Olden version?

[02:10:33.010 --> 02:10:33.890]
I wouldn't watch it.

[02:10:36.250 --> 02:10:37.750]
But it is in my story.

[02:10:37.790 --> 02:10:38.870]
It's in all the video stories.

[02:10:38.870 --> 02:10:41.190]
I could get the DVD but what I waste my time doing that.

[02:10:41.890 --> 02:10:44.310]
There's no way I could possibly like it.

[02:10:44.490 --> 02:10:45.470]
Don't you understand?

[02:10:48.570 --> 02:10:49.450]
Peter Cushing.

[02:10:50.970 --> 02:10:53.210]
There's like a Zid in different people that have played Dracula.

[02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:56.750]
There's only one Dracula to me and that's Bellagosi.

[02:10:57.490 --> 02:10:57.590]
Okay.

[02:10:57.990 --> 02:10:59.370]
That's why you have to look at wood.

[02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:01.110]
Okay fine.

[02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:02.410]
I'm delighted to watch it.

[02:11:02.490 --> 02:11:03.730]
Would if I give my hands on it.

[02:11:03.930 --> 02:11:04.450]
I'm Johnny Depp.

[02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:05.830]
I'm Johnny Depp's wood.

[02:11:07.130 --> 02:11:09.390]
But short of that I'm not going to be watching.

[02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:10.470]
I know more Dracula's.

[02:11:10.470 --> 02:11:11.270]
Okay that's it.

[02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:12.850]
But you enjoy it, Bener.

[02:11:12.930 --> 02:11:14.010]
You have a good time with it.

[02:11:15.090 --> 02:11:18.130]
5667-0560-0.560 on a AT&T line.

[02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:18.630]
Here's Kendall.

[02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:18.930]
Hello.

[02:11:19.490 --> 02:11:20.030]
Hey, yeah.

[02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.830]
Yes sir.

[02:11:20.890 --> 02:11:23.470]
Remember when we were kids, those old Joe Poluka movies?

[02:11:24.390 --> 02:11:24.710]
Yeah.

[02:11:25.070 --> 02:11:25.690]
Yeah, Joe.

[02:11:25.810 --> 02:11:27.430]
And his manager, Nabi Walsh.

[02:11:27.970 --> 02:11:28.190]
Yeah.

[02:11:28.610 --> 02:11:30.250]
Now do you remember who played those parts?

[02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:31.590]
I have no idea.

[02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:32.470]
Okay.

[02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:33.130]
I'll refresh you.

[02:11:33.170 --> 02:11:35.010]
Remember Joe Kirkwood, Jr.?

[02:11:35.010 --> 02:11:35.230]
No.

[02:11:35.230 --> 02:11:36.450]
I'm Leon Arrow.

[02:11:37.450 --> 02:11:38.430]
You can find it.

[02:11:38.890 --> 02:11:39.290]
Great.

[02:11:39.510 --> 02:11:42.230]
Okay well thanks for the news and put the pilot in back into glass.

[02:11:43.770 --> 02:11:44.830]
5667-0560-0.560.

[02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.390]
I mean there's a guy that makes me seem like a teenager.

[02:11:46.710 --> 02:11:46.770]
Okay.

[02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:48.230]
Of course I'm forgetting where the calls are coming from.

[02:11:48.530 --> 02:11:49.530]
How come what's your name?

[02:11:50.170 --> 02:11:51.970]
Sarah Goldfarb don't have any votes at last.

[02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:54.590]
When I peaked at this last time, they haven't seen it.

[02:11:55.450 --> 02:11:55.850]
Oh.

[02:11:56.770 --> 02:11:59.070]
And that's what your buddy Greg was fashing about.

[02:11:59.650 --> 02:11:59.950]
Right.

[02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:01.690]
About that movie, about Requiem for Dream.

[02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:05.110]
Don't forget 10 o'clock tonight on independent film channel.

[02:12:05.110 --> 02:12:05.570]
IFC.

[02:12:05.910 --> 02:12:07.090]
Does she have any votes?

[02:12:08.930 --> 02:12:10.650]
Ratsal Rizzo's only got a pair.

[02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:13.830]
Sarah Goldfarb has the big.

[02:12:14.210 --> 02:12:15.850]
Oh my god.

[02:12:16.590 --> 02:12:17.650]
But she's going to be on television.

[02:12:20.410 --> 02:12:21.470]
More reason than one.

[02:12:21.570 --> 02:12:21.950]
That's right.

[02:12:23.070 --> 02:12:24.310]
I'm going to be on television.

[02:12:25.090 --> 02:12:26.110]
We got a winner.

[02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.590]
I mean.

[02:12:27.950 --> 02:12:28.830]
I'm sorry.

[02:12:29.070 --> 02:12:30.710]
There's just something wrong with the world.

[02:12:30.850 --> 02:12:34.310]
In case you haven't noticed, in case somebody hasn't pointed you in that direction, there's

[02:12:34.310 --> 02:12:39.170]
something generally wrong, which is why so many people lead to McDonald's, so many even worse people

[02:12:39.170 --> 02:12:44.750]
lead at Burger King because they like the taste of rubber in their mouth, which I got a lot of good lines for that.

[02:12:46.290 --> 02:12:50.770]
So let's say we got general patent, we got jewels, we got detective Martin Riggs, dark helmet,

[02:12:52.450 --> 02:12:53.750]
uh, red butler.

[02:12:54.070 --> 02:12:55.770]
And those are the most reason ones that I wrote down.

[02:12:56.190 --> 02:12:58.550]
Josie Wales isn't Josie Wales also already on there?

[02:12:58.830 --> 02:12:58.970]
Yes.

[02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.650]
Amen.

[02:13:00.890 --> 02:13:01.250]
Goat.

[02:13:01.550 --> 02:13:01.990]
Amen.

[02:13:01.990 --> 02:13:02.370]
What is that?

[02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:03.710]
Amen get.

[02:13:04.130 --> 02:13:07.530]
He's the common dot from the concentration camp in Schindler's list.

[02:13:07.670 --> 02:13:08.270]
Oh, great.

[02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:08.990]
Oh, great.

[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:10.630]
Oh, great.

[02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:12.370]
I will not watch that.

[02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.630]
I will not watch that.

[02:13:12.630 --> 02:13:12.710]
I know.

[02:13:12.910 --> 02:13:12.990]
Okay.

[02:13:13.090 --> 02:13:14.130]
I'm not watching no more Jew movies.

[02:13:14.290 --> 02:13:14.650]
He was great.

[02:13:15.170 --> 02:13:16.070]
And Vito Corleone.

[02:13:16.350 --> 02:13:18.310]
You got Vito Corleone is under a dog.

[02:13:18.630 --> 02:13:19.350]
I'm the common on there.

[02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:20.370]
Sure.

[02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:21.230]
I'm going to get.

[02:13:23.170 --> 02:13:24.070]
What does that mean?

[02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:24.270]
Good.

[02:13:24.810 --> 02:13:26.410]
Anything he wants because he's the common dot.

[02:13:26.970 --> 02:13:30.630]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 0, 5, 60 on a AT and T.

[02:13:30.630 --> 02:13:33.770]
Don't forget that big thing of Tres Rhyl and 5, 7, 7, and 7, 0.

[02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:35.310]
You won't forget it.

[02:13:35.590 --> 02:13:36.730]
I'm getting there early.

[02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:38.410]
Here's a call from Miami.

[02:13:38.570 --> 02:13:38.710]
Hello.

[02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:40.190]
Yeah.

[02:13:40.530 --> 02:13:40.990]
Yes, sir.

[02:13:41.150 --> 02:13:41.670]
Hey, how you doing?

[02:13:41.770 --> 02:13:42.630]
I don't know if this will count.

[02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:44.830]
How about the Hanson Brothers from Slap Shop?

[02:13:48.150 --> 02:13:48.810]
No, you're right.

[02:13:48.970 --> 02:13:49.410]
It doesn't count.

[02:13:51.130 --> 02:13:51.770]
Thank you.

[02:13:52.530 --> 02:13:54.610]
Well, no, I mean, what would anybody put that down there?

[02:13:54.670 --> 02:13:58.310]
First of all, I mean that movie is just so grotesque and unacceptable.

[02:13:58.310 --> 02:14:01.570]
And even if the movie I hated, but it's like a bunch of goofballs.

[02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:03.510]
We're looking for one goofball, OK?

[02:14:05.110 --> 02:14:07.350]
Well, he said he didn't think it was going to count and he was right.

[02:14:07.510 --> 02:14:08.070]
Nice going, sir.

[02:14:08.370 --> 02:14:08.790]
Here's Tampa.

[02:14:08.930 --> 02:14:09.150]
Hello.

[02:14:09.770 --> 02:14:11.470]
Do you have Hannibal left or on your list?

[02:14:12.530 --> 02:14:13.070]
I do.

[02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:13.650]
We better have.

[02:14:13.810 --> 02:14:14.250]
Yes, we do.

[02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:16.430]
That's great because you remember his text phrase.

[02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:18.210]
What did I review to you, Neil?

[02:14:18.970 --> 02:14:21.170]
Oh, you should take it off the way.

[02:14:21.450 --> 02:14:25.650]
You see, all I have to do is mention Chronic and here they all come.

[02:14:25.650 --> 02:14:27.270]
Get this man some of hell.

[02:14:27.470 --> 02:14:28.170]
Get him a life.

[02:14:29.090 --> 02:14:30.870]
And you notice what line he was on?

[02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:31.130]
Right.

[02:14:31.310 --> 02:14:32.410]
Just mention it in passing, OK?

[02:14:32.610 --> 02:14:32.790]
Yeah.

[02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:39.510]
I mentioned that in case Benderboy was taking over that which I ducked because he's got so many other important tasks to attend to at the moment.

[02:14:39.850 --> 02:14:40.530]
He's multitasking.

[02:14:41.710 --> 02:14:46.250]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a gate TNT and Verizon line.

[02:14:46.630 --> 02:14:48.850]
You're all time favorite character from the movies.

[02:14:50.370 --> 02:14:52.610]
Oh, Bush is seeking newer and smaller nuclear bombs.

[02:14:52.730 --> 02:14:53.790]
I'm sure you're excited about that.

[02:14:53.790 --> 02:14:55.010]
I'm telling you.

[02:14:55.610 --> 02:15:06.050]
A dozen years after the Cold War's close, Ray thopes for an end of nuclear threat, the Bush administration is embarking on a quest for a new generation of nuclear bombs that are smaller, less powerful than the Pentagon might actually use in battle.

[02:15:06.710 --> 02:15:07.070]
All right.

[02:15:07.770 --> 02:15:08.790]
Let's nuke everybody.

[02:15:10.230 --> 02:15:16.030]
In the administration's view, the frightening size of Cold War strategic nuclear weapons, the ministers, they're different, they're deterrent value today.

[02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:19.590]
Nobody believes the U.S. would use them against the smaller foe as a result they argue.

[02:15:19.970 --> 02:15:26.810]
The U.S. needs the option of smaller nuclear weapons to deter the terrorist groups in rogue states, such as North Korea that are today's foremost dangers.

[02:15:28.010 --> 02:15:34.750]
And of course, when we have these terrorist acts going on in Chechnya and in Riyadh, I guess we just say, hey, all new Saudis over there, you better watch it.

[02:15:35.490 --> 02:15:37.150]
We're just going to use the small nukes.

[02:15:37.930 --> 02:15:39.770]
The only problem is where do we drop them?

[02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:40.830]
You know what I'm saying?

[02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:41.750]
Wherever we want.

[02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:43.070]
Wherever we want.

[02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:43.570]
That's right.

[02:15:43.810 --> 02:15:46.650]
We're going to show you a thing or two because you're either with us or against us.

[02:15:46.950 --> 02:15:48.510]
There's the good guys and the bad guys.

[02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:49.650]
The new can't appoint, baby.

[02:15:49.810 --> 02:15:52.110]
There's the good guys on the one side, which is us.

[02:15:52.890 --> 02:15:55.010]
And then there's the bad guys, which is everybody else.

[02:15:55.630 --> 02:15:56.090]
Got it?

[02:15:56.490 --> 02:15:56.890]
Got it.

[02:15:57.250 --> 02:16:03.150]
And this seems to be appealing very largely to the Macho mentality of America, especially the WASP audience out there.

[02:16:03.930 --> 02:16:04.790]
They like that.

[02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:06.150]
Makes them like swell.

[02:16:06.290 --> 02:16:08.630]
Makes their penis swell up to like even better than Viagra.

[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:15.510]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line.

[02:16:15.630 --> 02:16:16.410]
Here's Sunny Isles.

[02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.670]
Hello.

[02:16:18.010 --> 02:16:18.410]
Neil.

[02:16:18.810 --> 02:16:19.190]
Yes, sir.

[02:16:19.770 --> 02:16:21.190]
Anyone mentioned McCulley Copen?

[02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:22.010]
What's his name?

[02:16:22.050 --> 02:16:23.410]
McCulley Copen in Home Alone?

[02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:24.950]
I sure hope not.

[02:16:25.070 --> 02:16:26.210]
But that one I know he's a great character.

[02:16:26.650 --> 02:16:27.530]
Get out of here.

[02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:28.030]
Okay.

[02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.950]
That mic protection.

[02:16:29.090 --> 02:16:29.530]
Do you want to voice?

[02:16:30.210 --> 02:16:31.910]
Do not put McCulley Copen on there.

[02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:33.190]
What's your name in that movie?

[02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.630]
We don't know.

[02:16:33.750 --> 02:16:34.270]
We don't want to know.

[02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:35.150]
We don't want to know.

[02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:37.570]
Wasn't he also in happening?

[02:16:37.570 --> 02:16:38.150]
Happiness?

[02:16:38.810 --> 02:16:41.470]
Don't forget, by the way, you can't find happiness in South Florida.

[02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:42.770]
But you can order it online.

[02:16:43.130 --> 02:16:44.590]
But you can't order happiness online.

[02:16:44.770 --> 02:16:45.250]
Wouldn't that be great?

[02:16:46.170 --> 02:16:46.310]
Oh.

[02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:47.810]
Yeah.

[02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:52.190]
It shows up in the mail on the gigantic container and just open it up and big smile goes on your face.

[02:16:52.950 --> 02:16:53.270]
Happiness.

[02:16:54.330 --> 02:16:56.250]
They probably steal it at the post office.

[02:16:56.850 --> 02:16:57.930]
They probably go ballistic.

[02:16:59.390 --> 02:17:04.110]
56670560, pound 560 on the AT&T or did I say go postal and Verizon Wireless Line?

[02:17:04.510 --> 02:17:05.550]
Here's the lady in Voka.

[02:17:05.690 --> 02:17:05.830]
Hello.

[02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:06.830]
Yeah.

[02:17:06.850 --> 02:17:07.230]
Hi.

[02:17:07.470 --> 02:17:10.270]
What about Christopher Walken in the community?

[02:17:11.070 --> 02:17:12.510]
It's probably by the aliens.

[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:15.410]
Basically he's getting a high colonic in my view.

[02:17:18.690 --> 02:17:21.830]
That is to make it even a great movie.

[02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:23.970]
Catch me if you can.

[02:17:24.390 --> 02:17:24.710]
Back to.

[02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:26.950]
What was the name of the character?

[02:17:28.210 --> 02:17:30.410]
In the community.

[02:17:31.630 --> 02:17:33.030]
In whatever you said in the beginning.

[02:17:33.030 --> 02:17:34.270]
In the community.

[02:17:34.490 --> 02:17:35.030]
Christopher Walken.

[02:17:36.050 --> 02:17:37.290]
No, that's not the character.

[02:17:37.510 --> 02:17:38.090]
That's his name.

[02:17:38.610 --> 02:17:39.650]
Oh, I don't know his name.

[02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:40.990]
He's a writer in the movie.

[02:17:43.090 --> 02:17:43.770]
Okay, thanks.

[02:17:44.210 --> 02:17:44.450]
The writer.

[02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.390]
The writer.

[02:17:45.850 --> 02:17:47.090]
Okay, let's put down a writer showing.

[02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.510]
No.

[02:17:48.330 --> 02:17:48.330]

[02:17:48.750 --> 02:17:57.430]
Inspector Cluso 47, Sean Connery, James Bond 30, Don Coyote 15, Gunnery Sargent, Harman 14,

[02:17:57.670 --> 02:17:59.670]
Hannibal Lecter and Tony Montana, each have 13.

[02:17:59.670 --> 02:18:03.330]
Michael Corleone 12, Darth Vader 11, and after that it's like single digits.

[02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:05.490]
Carl Spackler, Caddyshack had nine.

[02:18:05.910 --> 02:18:06.810]
I just mentioned that in passing.

[02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:08.190]
And Forest Dump had eight.

[02:18:08.770 --> 02:18:12.750]
See, when Forest Dump kids eight votes at that point, I just say, forget about it.

[02:18:13.410 --> 02:18:13.530]
Right?

[02:18:14.710 --> 02:18:15.470]
Forget about it.

[02:18:15.510 --> 02:18:16.210]
I'd like to all use.

[02:18:16.570 --> 02:18:17.730]
I'd like to all use guys.

[02:18:17.850 --> 02:18:18.150]
You'll need it.

[02:18:18.250 --> 02:18:18.810]
Forest Dump.

[02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:21.790]
1157, because life is like that.

[02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:23.050]
Like that kind of.

[02:18:23.510 --> 02:18:25.650]
How I'll tell you if your carpets are kind of like that.

[02:18:25.850 --> 02:18:26.670]
Here's the answer for you.

[02:18:26.750 --> 02:18:30.090]
I've been using dry concepts for over 20 excruciating long years.

[02:18:30.150 --> 02:18:35.630]
I've been using dry concepts in my house and they do a spectacular job, especially the last 14 years of that period of time,

[02:18:35.670 --> 02:18:37.390]
because I had those dogs and man.

[02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.970]
Do they leave a mess?

[02:18:39.330 --> 02:18:39.830]
Or what?

[02:18:40.030 --> 02:18:42.490]
I mean, you know, they mean well or they meant well, past tense.

[02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:44.570]
But they didn't always do do well.

[02:18:45.010 --> 02:18:46.970]
And as a result, you have to have those carpets cleaned every now.

[02:18:46.990 --> 02:18:49.810]
And that's why every year I'd have dry concepts come in when they leave.

[02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:53.010]
The carpets look and smell and feel lemony, freshness like brand new.

[02:18:53.050 --> 02:18:53.930]
And they'll do the same for you.

[02:18:53.930 --> 02:18:59.890]
And not only your carpeting, but your drapes, your expensive area rugs, your oriental rugs, your leather furniture, your pulse free, all of these things.

[02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:06.430]
And also if you have problem with pet odors and milder odors, caused by water damage, it'll be no problem when they wave their magic wand and do this spectacular job.

[02:19:06.430 --> 02:19:09.750]
And they punk a magic twanger and make them all look just like brand new with dry concepts.

[02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:14.970]
Not BS, but they actually do a spectacular job and give you a written guaranteed price before they start to work.

[02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:18.450]
No rip offs, no tack ons, just a great job at a fair price every time.

[02:19:18.450 --> 02:19:24.490]

[02:19:31.630 --> 02:19:33.690]
You can clean today and you can entertain tonight.

[02:19:34.090 --> 02:19:39.790]
My, my and local, we're sports radio five-sixys, you and you AM.

[02:19:41.510 --> 02:19:42.510]
Well, how it ended, David?

[02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:46.510]
The only thing funny and then rape of it is that pipe smoke is 12 or 1 hour.

[02:19:46.510 --> 02:19:47.710]
The, the, the, the.

[02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:35.970]

[02:20:35.970 --> 02:21:04.870]
The, the, the, the, the, the, the, where the, the, where the, where the, the, where the, I, where the,

[02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:05.230]
Oh!

Well, make all your perverted caracters liberal these centers!

[02:21:10.890 --> 02:21:11.470]
Okay.

[02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:14.290]
Because, Mr. Henry, you're really a dummy.

[02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.670]
Alright.

[02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.190]

[02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:23.550]
We put a retarded girl in our old whom she'd be shated to show you how well it drives.

[02:21:24.010 --> 02:21:27.650]
We were in the woods.

[02:21:27.650 --> 02:21:28.930]
We were in the woods.

[02:21:28.930 --> 02:21:29.470]
We were in the woods.

[02:21:30.350 --> 02:21:32.310]
We were in the woods.

[02:21:32.310 --> 02:21:35.490]
Our agency thought this would move some product out of the showroom.

[02:21:39.330 --> 02:21:40.670]
Look at her go.

[02:21:42.430 --> 02:21:45.010]
This is funnier than watching retires at the park.

[02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:57.830]
If someone had severely retarded, you'd have that much fun in an empty place.

[02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:59.650]
Please, let's read more of this.

[02:21:59.730 --> 02:22:01.490]
She's having a double-edged beer!

[02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:03.110]
Okay, watch out for this.

[02:22:27.830 --> 02:22:28.070]
Oh!

[02:22:38.770 --> 02:22:39.690]

And it's time for me to go play with the man.

[02:24:21.970 --> 02:24:27.610]
With my driver I sent all and I play with my own board.

[02:24:28.050 --> 02:24:32.630]
And I won't go back to the LPGA again.

[02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:38.810]
Oh yes, I am good, so stop saying that I'm not.

[02:24:39.730 --> 02:24:41.790]
And bring contiguer wolves.

[02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:44.610]
I just hope I make the cut.

[02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:50.070]
I wear short pants and I can really swing.

[02:24:50.410 --> 02:24:52.890]
I'm not wrong, wrong.

[02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:57.810]
I am anico, she's anico, I am woman.

[02:25:01.090 --> 02:25:03.430]
She's anico, I am woman.

[02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:08.730]
I am anico, she don't must go.

[02:25:08.730 --> 02:25:13.970]
No war, says Cheryl Crow.

[02:25:15.170 --> 02:25:18.590]
Summer rikes will die, so we better not go.

[02:25:19.470 --> 02:25:22.750]
Shout out to the fish, because bad days will blow.

[02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:26.010]
Cheryl Crow is a stupid bitch.

[02:25:28.530 --> 02:25:30.670]
She's a burnt-up big mouth.

[02:25:31.350 --> 02:25:34.370]
Cheryl Crow is a worn-out hide.

[02:25:36.930 --> 02:25:39.510]
Just shake it in by the wall.

[02:25:40.050 --> 02:25:43.010]
Cheryl Crow is a white-headed hoe.

[02:25:43.370 --> 02:25:43.590]
Yeah.

[02:25:45.890 --> 02:25:52.030]
To the village loser, every day you can hear her whine.

[02:25:54.370 --> 02:25:57.650]
I wish somebody could show her.

[02:25:59.430 --> 02:26:00.470]
Uh-oh.

[02:26:01.610 --> 02:26:04.950]
We're larm and Jerry Paul will on the right hand of God.

[02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:09.130]
And when I woke up today, I put my TV on and instead of happily.

[02:26:09.550 --> 02:26:13.630]
Or CNN, I saw purple creature with a gay sign on his head.

[02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:16.950]
It wasn't upside down, try angle purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:17.130 --> 02:26:19.870]
Upside down, try angle purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:22.870]
Upside down, try angle purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:23.210 --> 02:26:24.530]
Hey, tell it, dubbing.

[02:26:25.050 --> 02:26:28.210]
Well, just when I thought things couldn't get work.

[02:26:28.210 --> 02:26:31.570]
I noticed he was carrying a little purse now.

[02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:34.170]
How can they call this a children's show?

[02:26:34.490 --> 02:26:37.090]
I'm gonna be purple, but I have a brown hole.

[02:26:37.130 --> 02:26:40.430]
He has an upside down, try angle purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:43.190]
Upside down, try angle purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:43.330 --> 02:26:44.830]
I'd love to drink your balls.

[02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:46.230]
Hey, purple, thinky-winky.

[02:26:46.650 --> 02:26:48.010]
Hey, tell it, tell it.

[02:26:48.570 --> 02:26:51.550]
We're almost about Christian punks as hard to believe.

[02:26:51.850 --> 02:26:54.490]
But on the tell it, tell it, tell it, he's tummy is a TV screen.

[02:26:54.850 --> 02:26:57.530]
It had a purple penis pointing straight at me.

[02:26:57.530 --> 02:27:00.570]
That was blowing an eye through the hole in the face.

[02:27:08.610 --> 02:27:14.210]
Oh, my thinking.

[02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:18.990]
All right, let's play who wants to be a millionaire.

[02:27:21.190 --> 02:27:24.870]
Puff Daddy, sitting in the chair, I'll call you Puffy.

[02:27:25.270 --> 02:27:26.430]
Yo, yo, man, yo, yo.

[02:27:26.430 --> 02:27:27.490]

[02:27:33.230 --> 02:27:33.570]
All right.

[02:27:33.970 --> 02:27:35.930]
Hickory, dickory, blank.

[02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:42.750]
Is it A-Doc, B-Pier, C-Marina, or D-Inlet?

[02:27:43.430 --> 02:27:44.490]
Whoa, man.

[02:27:45.010 --> 02:27:46.430]
Is this $100 question right here?

[02:27:46.690 --> 02:27:47.470]
You're kidding me, right?

[02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.770]
It's $100.

[02:27:49.330 --> 02:27:50.290]
For $100.

[02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:52.110]
This ain't the million dollar question.

[02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:53.890]
This is the first one.

[02:27:54.590 --> 02:27:54.790]
Hey.

[02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:55.730]
It's only for $100.

[02:27:56.250 --> 02:27:57.290]
Is this a black thing?

[02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:58.850]
Would you like to use a life line?

[02:27:59.210 --> 02:27:59.710]
Yeah, all right.

[02:27:59.810 --> 02:28:00.190]
What do I got?

[02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:00.750]

[02:28:07.430 --> 02:28:08.850]
They're $50.50 and they'll help me.

[02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:10.310]
Oh, you know, I'm going to phone a friend.

[02:28:10.650 --> 02:28:13.950]

A little bit of trouble here on the $100 question.

[02:28:55.210 --> 02:28:56.930]
Hey, the first time, man.

[02:28:57.090 --> 02:29:00.490]
First question and the next voice you hear will be his.

[02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:01.310]
He'll come on the line.

[02:29:01.430 --> 02:29:02.450]
He'll ask you the question.

[02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:04.510]
They'll give you four possible choices.

[02:29:04.850 --> 02:29:05.230]
Are you set?

[02:29:05.650 --> 02:29:06.270]
Hey, man.

[02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:10.510]
Next voice you hear will be his and 30 seconds begins now.

[02:29:11.330 --> 02:29:12.090]
What's up?

[02:29:13.310 --> 02:29:15.470]
Your dirty fish is all for me, all right?

[02:29:15.630 --> 02:29:16.170]
Hey, man.

[02:29:16.370 --> 02:29:18.450]
Hickory, dickory, blank.

[02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:20.530]
Is it A?

[02:29:20.530 --> 02:29:21.390]
Doc?

[02:29:22.290 --> 02:29:22.730]
B?

[02:29:23.570 --> 02:29:24.010]
Pia?

[02:29:24.870 --> 02:29:25.310]
C?

[02:29:26.090 --> 02:29:26.530]
Moreno?

[02:29:27.150 --> 02:29:28.030]
Or D?

[02:29:28.970 --> 02:29:29.410]
Italy.

[02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:31.510]
Oh, oh.

[02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:32.290]
Come on, man.

[02:29:32.450 --> 02:29:33.190]
I don't got much time.

[02:29:33.250 --> 02:29:33.910]
Man, I know this.

[02:29:34.090 --> 02:29:34.770]
Man, I know it.

[02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:35.930]
I see it's Pia.

[02:29:36.290 --> 02:29:36.990]
Pia, you sure?

[02:29:37.450 --> 02:29:38.810]
About 30, man.

[02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:40.010]
Listen, a lot of money, man.

[02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:41.010]
About 30.

[02:29:41.230 --> 02:29:41.690]
All right, man.

[02:29:41.830 --> 02:29:42.470]
Thank you very much.

[02:29:42.710 --> 02:29:43.410]
Hey, man.

[02:29:44.090 --> 02:29:46.810]
Times up, uh, old dirty said Pia.

[02:29:47.170 --> 02:29:47.530]
Whew.

[02:29:47.870 --> 02:29:49.370]
You still have two lifelines left.

[02:29:49.370 --> 02:29:51.310]
We are on the $100 question.

[02:29:51.570 --> 02:29:52.370]
You know what, Regis?

[02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:53.390]
Wanna pull the audience?

[02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:55.350]
No, I like to add a lifeline.

[02:29:56.010 --> 02:29:58.450]
I actually know there's only three lifelines

[02:29:58.450 --> 02:29:59.790]
of yours, one you have two left.

[02:29:59.970 --> 02:30:00.430]
No, no, no.

[02:30:00.730 --> 02:30:02.250]
I get another lifeline.

[02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:03.830]
It's a brand new one to the game.

[02:30:04.530 --> 02:30:05.790]
And, uh, what is that, Puffy?

[02:30:06.110 --> 02:30:07.150]
It's called Shoot the Host.

[02:30:07.750 --> 02:30:09.070]
Puffy, you can ask the audience.

[02:30:09.370 --> 02:30:10.530]
I call it Shoot the Host.

[02:30:10.690 --> 02:30:11.870]
Puffy, use the 50-50.

[02:30:12.030 --> 02:30:12.630]
What's the answer?

[02:30:12.850 --> 02:30:13.550]
Puffy, it's Doc.

[02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:14.190]
It's A.

[02:30:14.530 --> 02:30:15.050]
It's Doc.

[02:30:15.290 --> 02:30:16.290]
My final answer is Doc.

[02:30:16.430 --> 02:30:16.870]
It's Doc.

[02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:18.030]
And it's a good one.

[02:30:18.030 --> 02:30:18.750]
You got a $100.

[02:30:19.230 --> 02:30:20.510]
Run, you run, you run, you run!

[02:30:20.510 --> 02:30:22.430]
Run, shoot it, run, shoot it, run, shoot it!

[02:30:23.370 --> 02:30:25.170]
Good news, Sarah Goldfarb got a vote.

[02:30:25.330 --> 02:30:25.510]
Oh!

[02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:26.510]
Isn't that great?

[02:30:27.150 --> 02:30:27.850]
I feel better now.

[02:30:28.110 --> 02:30:29.650]
Especially since he's gonna be on television.

[02:30:30.210 --> 02:30:32.490]
Oh, and just so people know, I've unplugged the facts machine.

[02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:33.930]
Why is that?

[02:30:34.390 --> 02:30:35.730]
Oh, because it just isn't stopping.

[02:30:36.310 --> 02:30:40.570]
Multiple, multiple pages of things that we already have in editions that, uh, you know,

[02:30:40.930 --> 02:30:41.610]
I would take note of it.

[02:30:41.650 --> 02:30:42.790]
Yeah, leave us alone, okay?

[02:30:42.890 --> 02:30:44.610]
It's our Wednesday rest hour, all right?

[02:30:45.910 --> 02:30:46.590]
Leave us alone.

[02:30:47.210 --> 02:30:51.490]
All time favorite character from the movies Inspector Clousse O52, he's the way ahead of the

[02:30:51.490 --> 02:30:51.850]
pack.

[02:30:52.530 --> 02:30:58.050]
Sean Connery's James Bond 34, uh, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, Full Metal Jacket 17, Don Corleone,

[02:30:58.490 --> 02:30:58.810]
16.

[02:30:59.650 --> 02:31:06.070]
Dirty Harry Callahan, 15, 20 Montana, 14, Hannibal Lecter, 14, Michael Corleone, 14, Darth

[02:31:06.070 --> 02:31:07.850]
Vader, 13, how are you doing the ones in double digits?

[02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:12.170]
Uh, Darth Vader, 13, Carl Spackler, or Caddy Shack, 11 and 4, scumped 10.

[02:31:12.850 --> 02:31:15.870]
I lied, I gotta give you Roger Moore and, uh, James Bond 9.

[02:31:16.490 --> 02:31:17.870]
That's depressing, you know.

[02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:22.450]
I mean, Roger Moore's okay, but he, you know, all of, he is, uh, at least under 100.

[02:31:23.130 --> 02:31:25.870]
Okay, as opposed to Sean Connery, who's a little on the, uh, ancient side?

[02:31:26.270 --> 02:31:28.230]
From it, it's past, nobody is craggy, you know?

[02:31:28.910 --> 02:31:33.890]
He's that real great looking, sex symbol, Sean Connery, but all real men would like to

[02:31:33.890 --> 02:31:37.010]
be like Sean Connery, they'd like to look just like that, you know, be real virile.

[02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:38.690]
I'd rather be, uh, Tom Brady myself.

[02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:42.910]
You know, talk is cheap, it's easy to throw on a lot of really appealing low numbers,

[02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:46.370]
but when it comes right down to it and on it, what can you really get refinanced at?

[02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:52.270]
5%, 4%, how about 2.45% with financial group?

[02:31:52.390 --> 02:31:52.730]
That's right.

[02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:58.090]
With interest rates of only 2.45% it really is your best bet and it's rock solid too.

[02:31:58.530 --> 02:32:04.330]
So call financial group this moment at 1-800-940-Lend, 1-800-940-L-E-N-D,

[02:32:04.470 --> 02:32:05.630]
interest rates are at all time lows.

[02:32:05.910 --> 02:32:09.630]
So why not refinance your home or even buy a new home and take advantage of a sure thing?

[02:32:09.630 --> 02:32:15.630]
2.45% financing with financial group and what will 2.45% do to those monthly payments?

[02:32:15.630 --> 02:32:17.870]
Bring them down to like a jitter laughable amount.

[02:32:18.250 --> 02:32:21.130]
If you have a $200,000 loan, you pay only $786 a month.

[02:32:21.370 --> 02:32:25.370]
If you have a $100,000 loan, your payments are only $393 a month.

[02:32:25.650 --> 02:32:27.150]
Even George could afford that, maybe.

[02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:32.990]
You get 2.45% financing from financial group called 1-800-940-Lend.

[02:32:33.290 --> 02:32:38.470]
That's financial group 1-800-940-L-E-N-D, the Reniqual Housing Lender,

[02:32:38.470 --> 02:32:43.070]
Credit Restrictions Applying rates are subject to change monthly, 5.34 APR.

[02:32:43.230 --> 02:32:45.090]
Buy, Buy, And Look All.

[02:32:45.450 --> 02:32:48.310]
This is 4.2560-Lend.

[02:32:48.330 --> 02:32:49.550]
Wait, 2A-M.

[02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:52.070]
Stop smart!

[02:32:52.770 --> 02:32:54.070]
Stop like everybody says,

[02:32:54.590 --> 02:32:57.290]
Stop smart, and I want to spend!

[02:33:02.570 --> 02:33:07.050]
You turn back in the day when someone done us wrong.

[02:33:08.050 --> 02:33:10.450]
We didn't take their crap.

[02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:14.590]
Imperial Harbour, or when the jabs dropped their bombs,

[02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:20.870]
We bombed them back, and now the Saudis, they hit us hard.

[02:33:21.250 --> 02:33:23.830]
And on our cards, our little flags wave.

[02:33:24.670 --> 02:33:30.870]
As that Saudi-loving retard points the bombers the wrong way.

[02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:41.390]
The Americans, where they follow goals like cheese,

[02:33:42.050 --> 02:33:47.070]
The United States of Americans, led by Bush and his family,

[02:33:47.490 --> 02:33:54.650]
Revealing at this country, up, handling tors with our gestation, I used to be.

[02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:58.570]
I don't want to be a tax-american.

[02:33:59.870 --> 02:34:02.930]
In the goddamn USA.

[02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:11.650]
What's a few thousand innocent lives?

[02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:14.350]
Stop living at the best.

[02:34:15.210 --> 02:34:21.210]
If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas.

[02:34:22.170 --> 02:34:25.730]
It's the greatest country in the world.

[02:34:25.730 --> 02:34:27.890]
They train us to believe.

[02:34:28.730 --> 02:34:35.630]
And anyone who says that, obviously, ends up for to be.

[02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:44.910]
And I'm embarrassed to be an American, where we pay triologically.

[02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:52.030]
Wave a flag in one hand, with our head in the sand, and blindly follow the powers that be.

[02:34:52.030 --> 02:34:59.090]
Appathetic, fuck up, washing state for news on a 65-inch screen.

[02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:03.230]
Scratch your balls and find everything's okay.

[02:35:05.150 --> 02:35:07.290]
In the goddamn USA.

[02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:09.830]
We don't want America.

[02:35:19.930 --> 02:35:22.330]
Oh, we're fine.

[02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:33.830]
We're in the lab.

[02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:36.230]
We're in the lab.

[02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:33.390]
We're in the lab.

[02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:34.910]
I have this movie, okay.

[02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:38.170]
I smoke two joints.

[02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.630]
Alright.

[02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:43.770]
Its time to be astuminatime of war!

[02:36:46.290 --> 02:36:47.810]
Are you?

[02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:49.910]
Spare us a breakthrough.

[02:36:58.150 --> 02:37:02.830]
Vadeff, fuck us up.

[02:37:05.110 --> 02:37:07.170]
You call that a penis?

[02:37:08.050 --> 02:37:08.390]
Err.

[02:37:14.770 --> 02:37:21.070]
Oh my daddy was told me so you see all working man.

[02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:27.950]
And for my wife he was told me so you should be better than him.

[02:37:27.950 --> 02:37:33.290]
So then one day I met Emma scared to meet a day.

[02:37:33.650 --> 02:37:34.190]
All right.

[02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:37.290]
Hardwood food and hardwood fine.

[02:37:37.770 --> 02:37:39.810]
Just take care of him.

[02:37:40.050 --> 02:37:43.070]
That's why I hope to learn in the morning.

[02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:45.570]
I hope to learn tonight.

[02:37:46.970 --> 02:37:49.470]
I hope to learn in the afternoon.

[02:37:50.250 --> 02:37:51.850]
It makes me feel alright.

[02:37:52.850 --> 02:37:56.070]
I hope to learn in time of dreams.

[02:37:56.070 --> 02:37:58.270]
And doing time for.

[02:37:59.470 --> 02:38:02.030]
I hope to learn in time for the joy.

[02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:04.530]
And then I hope to most.

[02:38:04.990 --> 02:38:06.330]
All to joy.

[02:38:06.510 --> 02:38:07.330]
That's what I do.

[02:38:10.890 --> 02:38:12.590]
All to joy.

[02:38:12.750 --> 02:38:16.190]
So there's hope to learn with me every morning.

[02:38:17.290 --> 02:38:18.870]
All to joy.

[02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:22.530]
So there's hope to learn with me every afternoon.

[02:38:23.430 --> 02:38:25.070]
All to joy.

[02:38:25.170 --> 02:38:28.770]
And with his other clothes, he comes and will bother me a whole more.

[02:38:29.970 --> 02:38:31.330]
All to joy.

[02:38:31.350 --> 02:38:32.730]
And we were gonna say that.

[02:38:35.890 --> 02:38:37.770]
All to joy.

[02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:40.690]
All to joy.

[02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:43.810]
All to joy.

[02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:43.850]

[02:38:43.850 --> 02:38:44.850]
That's what I do.

[02:38:45.510 --> 02:38:46.930]
All to joy.

[02:38:47.370 --> 02:38:49.990]
All to joy.

[02:38:58.930 --> 02:39:01.050]
I want to give you a kiss.

[02:39:06.970 --> 02:39:07.530]
Okay.

[02:39:09.810 --> 02:39:13.170]
Well, I was driving down 995 the other night.

[02:39:14.130 --> 02:39:16.350]
Somebody nearly cuffed me right off the road.

[02:39:17.750 --> 02:39:20.450]
I decided wasn't gonna do any good to get mad.

[02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:22.510]
I wrote a song about it.

[02:39:22.510 --> 02:39:22.510]

[02:39:22.510 --> 02:39:22.970]
And I'm gonna stand.

[02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:25.670]
And those like this.

[02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:29.870]
Where she born an asshole.

[02:39:30.250 --> 02:39:33.750]
Or did you work in your whole life?

[02:39:34.750 --> 02:39:35.130]
Uh-huh.

[02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:37.890]
Either way it worked out fine.

[02:39:38.590 --> 02:39:41.610]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[02:39:44.310 --> 02:39:45.730]
Is your name?

[02:39:46.450 --> 02:39:48.090]
S-S-S-H-O-L-E.

[02:39:48.330 --> 02:39:48.710]
Okay.

[02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:52.510]
And don't you try to blame this on me.

[02:39:53.450 --> 02:39:56.030]
You deserve all the credit.

[02:39:57.170 --> 02:39:59.830]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:40:02.350 --> 02:40:06.450]
You were an asshole yesterday.

[02:40:07.510 --> 02:40:10.070]
You're an asshole tonight.

[02:40:11.930 --> 02:40:14.290]
I've got a feeling.

[02:40:14.290 --> 02:40:18.690]
You're an asshole the rest of your life.

[02:40:55.430 --> 02:40:59.090]
I was talking to your mother.

[02:41:00.370 --> 02:41:03.110]
Just the other night.

[02:41:04.350 --> 02:41:07.370]
I told her I parked you an asshole.

[02:41:08.190 --> 02:41:09.050]
She said yes.

[02:41:09.730 --> 02:41:10.970]
I think you're right.

[02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:17.510]
And all your friends are asshole.

[02:41:18.390 --> 02:41:21.270]
Because you know that you're whole life.

[02:41:22.470 --> 02:41:29.450]
And somebody told me you've got an asshole for a life.

[02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.970]
Yeah.

[02:41:32.450 --> 02:41:35.890]
Where you born an asshole.

[02:41:36.790 --> 02:41:39.710]
Or did you work in your whole life?

[02:41:41.430 --> 02:41:43.870]
Either way it worked out fine.

[02:41:44.770 --> 02:41:51.690]
Because you're an asshole tonight.

[02:41:55.610 --> 02:41:58.750]
I'm looking at an inspector, Klusso,

[02:41:58.910 --> 02:42:00.170]
which is number one on our thing.

[02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.810]
Yeah.

[02:42:01.310 --> 02:42:02.450]
Did we have that spelled right?

[02:42:05.310 --> 02:42:05.750]
No.

[02:42:06.330 --> 02:42:06.490]
No.

[02:42:06.670 --> 02:42:07.850]
It's CLOU.

[02:42:08.050 --> 02:42:10.370]
I mean, when you consider it's the number one choice on the pool.

[02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:11.730]
I've got to get you a bunch of botanists.

[02:42:16.070 --> 02:42:17.870]
It's CLOU, S-E-A-U.

[02:42:18.090 --> 02:42:18.750]
Well, whatever it is.

[02:42:18.750 --> 02:42:19.050]
Okay.

[02:42:19.290 --> 02:42:19.930]
Get it right.

[02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:21.030]
Get it right, Eric.

[02:42:21.250 --> 02:42:22.470]
I'm going to be in a poor way with that.

[02:42:22.550 --> 02:42:22.990]
Did you do that?

[02:42:24.850 --> 02:42:25.170]
Probably.

[02:42:25.390 --> 02:42:26.430]
That sounds like the way I spelled it.

[02:42:26.570 --> 02:42:27.530]
Yeah, that's where you was born.

[02:42:27.770 --> 02:42:28.670]
Because you wanted to why?

[02:42:28.770 --> 02:42:29.510]
Because you're clueless.

[02:42:31.350 --> 02:42:32.070]
26th pass noon.

[02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.950]
How's that pool coming?

[02:42:32.990 --> 02:42:33.990]
We got a whole bunch of votes.

[02:42:33.990 --> 02:42:34.950]
300 and some odd.

[02:42:35.050 --> 02:42:36.390]
Inspector Klusso got 55.

[02:42:37.330 --> 02:42:38.490]
Favorite character all the time from the movies.

[02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:40.470]
James Bond, John Carrey 40.

[02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:44.370]
He's the definitive 30 Harry Callahan 15.

[02:42:44.810 --> 02:42:45.430]

I'm Hanel Vlector 18.

[02:42:50.430 --> 02:42:52.290]
Nobody can touch Inspector Klusso.

[02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:56.610]
My favorite one was the one where he was in the toilet on the airplane.

[02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:59.050]
Yeah, broken with a broken leg.

[02:43:00.910 --> 02:43:02.430]

Start a who sings a mother f***er.

[02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:30.150]
I racked the crappy little contract.

[02:44:31.150 --> 02:44:33.670]
I was like the mustache on a space.

[02:44:34.510 --> 02:44:36.070]
Just get rid of that.

[02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:40.710]
Go ahead and grab your ice and jump off, and blow up the whole God damn place.

[02:44:41.750 --> 02:44:44.910]

[02:45:25.970 --> 02:45:29.150]
Look at jeans that won't stay on

[02:45:29.150 --> 02:45:35.130]
Hair is blonde, shake my fun and I turn guys off

[02:45:35.130 --> 02:45:43.050]
But there's a place where all the guys can hide it

[02:45:43.630 --> 02:45:48.450]
I can make guys grow right behind their stairs

[02:45:49.570 --> 02:45:55.030]
I can make guys grow with my mind and booty

[02:45:55.030 --> 02:45:58.190]

[02:46:03.230 --> 02:46:09.850]
Be it such a beggar or I can make you grow

[02:46:09.850 --> 02:46:15.030]
With my mind and booty, that's where they are done

[02:46:15.730 --> 02:46:20.590]
Cause I'm such a beauty, it's one of the things I worry for

[02:46:20.590 --> 02:46:27.050]
Be it such a beggar or be it such a beggar

[02:46:34.970 --> 02:46:39.070]
You love Shakira's tongue, she isn't but you're neat, you're close

[02:46:39.070 --> 02:46:44.030]
Oh, the middle is dark love, that's near in my story

[02:46:44.750 --> 02:46:47.210]
There's a middle, I'm strong

[02:46:47.210 --> 02:46:51.370]
And now you'll love her new album Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:46:51.370 --> 02:46:54.850]
I can't cover you, I'm more than you

[02:46:54.850 --> 02:46:56.790]
Oh, I'm more than you

[02:46:56.790 --> 02:47:00.690]
She already made music history by recording her first English language album

[02:47:00.690 --> 02:47:03.730]
And now she's taking her art form to the next level

[02:47:03.730 --> 02:47:06.430]
By re-recording songs that were already hits in English

[02:47:06.430 --> 02:47:08.730]
Only this time they're in English again

[02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:16.930]
Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:47:21.970 --> 02:47:27.070]
Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:32.770]
If you really, really like Shakira's CD, laundry service

[02:47:32.770 --> 02:47:35.930]
Then you'll really, really, really like her new CD

[02:47:35.930 --> 02:47:38.350]
Shakira sings other people's hits

[02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:40.570]
No denemos en español en estos momentos

[02:47:40.570 --> 02:47:44.430]
Olympic ice cupades, man, it's such a dirty trait

[02:47:44.430 --> 02:47:46.610]
Tonja tries to win

[02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:52.030]
She was second best and it hurt her

[02:47:52.030 --> 02:47:54.870]
So, uh-oh, oh, oh

[02:47:54.870 --> 02:47:58.910]
Nancy Carrigan, the bitch was gonna win again

[02:47:58.910 --> 02:48:01.050]
Tonja blocks revenge

[02:48:02.770 --> 02:48:05.250]
Highest out a henchman

[02:48:05.770 --> 02:48:08.770]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:48:09.650 --> 02:48:12.950]
That's Nancy K was leaving ring

[02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:16.270]
She's knocked up from behind

[02:48:16.270 --> 02:48:23.250]
Bang, bang, tonja silver hammer came down upon her knee

[02:48:23.770 --> 02:48:28.610]
Bang, bang, tonja silver hammer made sure

[02:48:28.610 --> 02:48:30.610]
Oh, a victory

[02:48:38.830 --> 02:48:42.830]
Olympic middle round Tonja is an ugly ground

[02:48:42.830 --> 02:48:45.250]
Pull her every move

[02:48:45.250 --> 02:48:48.630]
She can't find her groove

[02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:49.790]
She's off balance

[02:48:50.610 --> 02:48:52.610]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:48:53.170 --> 02:48:55.610]
She foregoes the plan

[02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:59.750]
Makes her way into the stand murder on her mind

[02:49:00.610 --> 02:49:04.350]
She has never minded a challenge

[02:49:04.350 --> 02:49:07.830]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:49:07.830 --> 02:49:11.430]
The crowd they make a break for the door

[02:49:11.430 --> 02:49:14.870]
But it's too late to run

[02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:18.870]
Bang, bang, tonja silver hammer

[02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:22.170]
You're smashing in the head

[02:49:22.170 --> 02:49:28.570]
She will not leave Lil' amateur level on Wednesday

[02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:41.030]
Tonja's at the Polygate

[02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:43.670]
St. Pete checks his book

[02:49:43.670 --> 02:49:48.230]
He gives her a look and he tells her

[02:49:48.230 --> 02:49:52.130]
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:53.790]
She claims she's in a zone

[02:49:53.790 --> 02:49:57.890]
Laces up and throws a 50 turnity on the line

[02:49:58.910 --> 02:50:01.450]
This guy's out of line

[02:50:01.450 --> 02:50:06.630]
And he's got to go, oh, oh, oh

[02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:09.870]
As St. Pete was turning a page

[02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:12.690]
Tonja took her hand

[02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:17.570]
Bang, bang, tonja silver hammer rang

[02:50:17.570 --> 02:50:20.130]
And St. Pete's bell

[02:50:20.130 --> 02:50:23.690]
But space can't kill no saints

[02:50:23.690 --> 02:50:27.010]
Who never meant she would sleep to hell

[02:50:27.010 --> 02:50:27.770]
Oh, right

[02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:35.550]
Bang, bang, bang

[02:50:35.550 --> 02:50:38.150]
What's the matter with Lesby and golfers?

[02:50:38.230 --> 02:50:40.850]
Can't you tell we really love hit new malls?

[02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:45.030]
The only thing that separates us from the men

[02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:47.870]
Is the country clubs bathroom stalls

[02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:52.370]
And when my girlfriend is all so claddy

[02:50:52.370 --> 02:50:54.050]
She's the fair one on the books

[02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:55.610]
She called me dirty

[02:50:55.610 --> 02:50:58.590]
Must die that five-tuney taco

[02:50:58.590 --> 02:51:01.450]
Oh, right, it's still ladies golf to me

[02:51:04.470 --> 02:51:07.850]
My favorite whole it doesn't have any number

[02:51:07.850 --> 02:51:10.510]
A green or a fairway

[02:51:11.430 --> 02:51:14.830]
Don't threaten me cause I'm a snapper lapper

[02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:17.170]
I play golf and I'm gay

[02:51:18.510 --> 02:51:21.970]
I'm a skinny Tom got caught in clubhouse

[02:51:21.970 --> 02:51:25.470]
Let me go, fit the only time we dug out

[02:51:25.470 --> 02:51:28.510]
I'm gay, let's play LPG

[02:51:28.510 --> 02:51:31.030]
And still ladies golf to me

[02:51:32.230 --> 02:51:35.890]
And right as this grey chick sit on my face

[02:51:35.890 --> 02:51:38.050]
And still ladies golf to me

[02:51:38.050 --> 02:51:38.390]
Welcome

[02:51:40.110 --> 02:51:42.370]
21-1 at 560 WQM

[02:51:42.370 --> 02:51:43.850]
It's our big Wednesday extravagant

[02:51:43.850 --> 02:51:46.810]
You know this is one of the best ideas I ever fell into

[02:51:47.290 --> 02:51:47.650]
Yeah

[02:51:47.650 --> 02:51:48.570]
No two thing?

[02:51:48.770 --> 02:51:49.510]
Are you kidding me?

[02:51:49.630 --> 02:51:50.710]
I mean just a great buffer

[02:51:50.710 --> 02:51:52.050]
You know everybody needs a buffer

[02:51:52.050 --> 02:51:53.490]
Like a good break in the middle of the week

[02:51:53.490 --> 02:51:55.290]
Anyway we've got 75 million votes

[02:51:55.290 --> 02:51:56.710]
So it's your favorite all-time character

[02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:58.430]
We still have it spelled wrong I should point out

[02:51:59.470 --> 02:52:00.490]
Don't fight here too much

Finds it for flying down

[02:54:21.230 --> 02:54:23.910]
So I can get my picks up

[02:54:23.910 --> 02:54:26.890]
When the game is over tight

[02:54:26.890 --> 02:54:29.850]

Since everybody is understead the same

[02:54:37.390 --> 02:54:38.670]

They call it VD Park

[02:55:35.890 --> 02:55:37.990]
They call it VD Park

[02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:39.430]

[02:55:57.390 --> 02:55:59.070]
She said I was too old days

[02:55:59.070 --> 02:56:00.190]
And for a week

[02:56:00.190 --> 02:56:03.210]
Now she's got the hooked on these

[02:56:03.210 --> 02:56:05.050]

[02:56:05.050 --> 02:56:07.170]
And her cheeks were gulped up

[02:56:07.170 --> 02:56:07.870]
Down

[02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:10.790]

You know that my heart's been going wild

[02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:36.130]
It seems like I want it now

[02:56:36.130 --> 02:56:38.830]

And that was the total eclipse of her career

[02:58:46.990 --> 02:58:49.490]
She was Bonnie Tyler

[02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:50.970]
Nothing I can do

[02:58:50.970 --> 02:58:53.890]
A totally eclipse of the heart

[02:58:53.890 --> 02:58:56.130]
I remember as a child growing up in Wales

[02:58:56.130 --> 02:58:57.850]
You couldn't keep me away from the piano

[02:58:57.850 --> 02:58:58.930]
Did you say Wales?

[02:58:59.490 --> 02:59:01.290]
Isn't Catherine Zita Jones from Wales?

[02:59:01.290 --> 02:59:02.690]
I think so

[02:59:02.690 --> 02:59:03.630]
But I...

[02:59:03.630 --> 02:59:05.230]
God Lord that woman is hot

[02:59:05.230 --> 02:59:07.830]

[02:59:07.830 --> 02:59:09.030]
Yes, that's fine

[02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.850]
No good thing

[02:59:09.850 --> 02:59:12.230]
Michael Douglas could ever have a bagger if he wasn't famous

[02:59:26.290 --> 02:59:29.890]

I'm not interested in Catherine Zita Jones

[02:59:46.270 --> 02:59:49.050]
Oh come on, I bet even women went a piece of her

[02:59:49.050 --> 02:59:51.890]

[02:59:52.450 --> 02:59:54.270]
