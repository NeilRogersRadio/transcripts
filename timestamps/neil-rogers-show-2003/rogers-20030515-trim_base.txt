Dining on human flesh once he was subtle, but now he's not feeding around the bush

[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.560]
Let's carry universal pictures presents

[00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.540]

Following the big. Oh, you know, I'm beginning to realize we got some holes in the line up here. You know what?

[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.820]
There's some definite holes in the QAM lineup

[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.380]
I love those Latin ladies what I don't like is the cap on this microphone my god. It's from like 1986

[00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.380]
Hank was busting awesome whip chunk

[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.740]
Jesus

[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.440]

[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.680]

[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.200]
Special K for the moment

[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.500]
Anyway, here's the facts to get us started. I do want to mention that Raymond and sales is not only an asshole. He's also a liar

[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.820]
Don't we want to say that beater?

[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.540]
Yeah, yeah, he's a asshole and a liar like most salespeople

[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.640]
Also Bob Eisenberg thanks for the new copy Bob

[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.580]
But you got like this white stripe down the middle of it on your printer and fax machine. It's all screwed up

[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.200]
But you're a hell of a guy Bob kind of like the white stripe. He's got down the middle of that red piece. He wears

[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.680]
Anyway before we get into a Raymond who's a liar in our sales department. Hey, we know you weren't talking about

[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.680]
This the client being on the best behavior. We know you were talking about

[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.900]
Little beater boy bring it beyond your best behavior. I'm bringing in a client

[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.800]
He tries to turn it around like he was telling the client beyond your best behavior and a client was out in the hallway

[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.400]
Looked him in the eye look him right in the eye and said hey beater boy be on your best behavior

[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.880]
I'm bringing a client in here and when I outed him on the area yesterday and of course it's all over the building because they're all glued

[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.160]
They are glued to their videos during these four hours make no mistake about it

[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.820]
And anybody who gets ripped on his show and of course there's a lot of people

[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440]
Well, they hear about it all day long. They hear it from the crowd

[00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.620]
Don't you hate that expression that was a marvoured alportism

[00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.920]
He's hearing it from the crowd and then everybody started picking up on it because those sports nerds

[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.380]
Like a bunch of copycats

[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.140]
He is so sick and so

[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.080]
Grotesque he really is grotesque

[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.340]
Scott for real

[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.480]
But he might fit right in on his show since I'm going on vacation starting tomorrow

[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.380]
He might do a great job here on this show during vacation. We'll find out who the audience wants. That's our poll today

[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.800]
We're getting off this movie thing

[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.180]
We've milked the movie thing very very well. Thank you very much

[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.320]
And speaking of milking things the Dracula very oldman phony votes. They didn't escape my very very uh

[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.000]
very uh sharp eye

[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.320]
39 votes at which 30 of them are phony and I'll start pouring in here this morning just to try to piss me off as if I really give a crap

[00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:00.600]
Maybe there are they want to be boyfriends with boy. Yeah, he's guy. Yeah with him. He's got to follow it. Is that it does he? Yeah, yeah, mostly predators

[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.980]
Here's the facts from see he's doing it again

[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.940]
You're doing the making the same sounds that beast was making with the Pharrell last night

[00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.980]
I won't do it again and then the mole is right far from Mia for me to ever agree with mole, but he he has got his tongue right on this morning

[00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:23.440]
I have seldom heard anybody suck such hard ass as beast was doing with Pharrell last night just sucking and you know something beast

[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.580]
You're still awful

[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.200]
We go baseball. It's 30. Oh, we go baseball

[00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.020]
See, but this is what happened when you put a bunch of children on here and that's QAM generally speaking

[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.420]
They pay a few of us the big bucks and the rest of the people. I can't afford to pay anybody and they so we have a bunch of kids

[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.920]
And then we got George who's kind of in limbo who's neither a kid nor a while you know

[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.460]
Nor a professional broadcast or somewhere luck in between

[00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.040]
But he needs the money

[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:55.160]
When you think that's an apt expression sure he needs the cash right anyway the fashion Todd and Hollywood says watch

[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.060]
Requiem for a dream last not an independent film channel. Thank you

[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.720]
In George for telling me about it only problem is now my arm hurts and the refrigerators attacking me

[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.360]
Oh

[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.780]
Yet a beast had his tongue inserted so deep in Pharrell's ass last night

[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.220]
That it took four paramedics to get it to slide it out of there and about a pound of a Vaseline

[00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.820]

From Caddy Shack was tied with Michael Collione with 58 you know you asked me an interesting question and the only thing I can think of

[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.360]
Why Michael had more votes than Don Corleone is because Michael was in three of the movies

[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.420]
And Don Corleone he was a croaked in the first one

[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.380]
I mean, that's pretty bad

[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.800]
Exactly Michael had 58 20 Montana 54 Darth Vader 53 Don Corleone only had 44

[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.140]
And to be very honest with you. I don't think there's any comparison do you know

[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.620]
But you know the audience had very oldman's got 39 votes 30 of them phony so stick him way down the bottom of the list of Dracula

We'll probably get some calls about Scott for all what a fantastic job he did last night

[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:31.920]
From all those of professional sports lickers the see first of all anybody who would listen to ESPN radio in the first place

[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.420]
Has got to be a sports nerd

[00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.800]
Nobody with the maturity of more than a 5-year-old listens to ESPN sports ever

[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:42.620]
So the fact he used to be on overnight sign ESPN radio and the fact that some of these people maybe from New York

Terrorists act such as mouth noise

Perpping and fighting could be annoying to others. So under Patriot Act 2

[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:57.960]
Eating will no longer be permitted in restaurants. Anyone eating outside the designated eating area will also be shot

Don't help me remember the name. Requiem for a dream was the name PR Ralph

[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.020]
What an awesome movie but I have one question

[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.460]
How can those guys schlep a TV on the boardwalk and Kone Allen that cheap TV card and it not fall down

[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:05.420]
They're when you're as white and when you're as wired as they were and you've got the when you're as determined as they are no problem

[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.420]
Never miss the beat

[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.180]
But you are correct. It was an awesome very awesome movie. We'll watch it again Friday at 9 p.m. on the independent film channel

It'll be on again tomorrow night at 9 on independent film channel the iFC

That's your buddy. It is two a's in a row right out of the box

[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.040]

[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:53.740]
And he did 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 on the AT&T and for eyes on wireless line. Here's Miami again. Hello

[00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:57.100]
Miami, Ola

[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.040]
Nobody under a peanut boy. Here's Miami online 7 hello

[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.580]
Hey, okay

[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:12.420]
Listen a couple things first of all I didn't watch that movie Requiem for a dream. Yeah, didn't get into it

[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:17.200]
I mean, I really thought it was a very slow starting very ponderous movie, but thank god

[00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:22.040]
Godfather 2 was on at 3 30. Oh, and that helped

[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:22.940]
Ah

[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.540]
I didn't you didn't get into us. No, it was slow starting

[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:34.180]
Just I didn't think it made much sense. I had to turn it off and thank god godfather was on

[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:40.220]
I mean how many times much as I like the godfather how many times can you watch the same thing? Oh, you got lucky and at regute

[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:41.620]
Regus spaghetti sauce

[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:44.740]
You got to try new things man. This is godfather 2

[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:52.560]
Yeah, man. So anyways, I did try to watch it. I took your advice, but I can't say I really fell for it

[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.820]
Um, the second thing is who do you think is gonna get the boot with mr. Ferrell?

[00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.740]
they go

[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:04.600]
Who's getting the boot? Well, it's me taking somebody's place. I mean he's not gonna be part time. Oh, I have no idea who the hell knows

[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:09.360]
Well, at least you have one more person to put on the QAM school of broadcasting

[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.880]
Yeah, well, I was thinking of a new morning lineup. I was thinking of guilty

[00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:14.420]
Ferrell and

[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.300]
Lenny Martezza be good

[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:21.160]
Have a great day pali. Yeah, he didn't like the movie. How do you like that? I thought we'd be

[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.820]
I saw for a second or two phones were all that up like a Christmas tree

[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:27.340]
I thought those were all people who watched the flick last night and wanted to call it and say thank you

[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:31.020]
It was really sensational or maybe it sucked. I don't know, but this guy couldn't even get into it

[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:38.640]
I mean, I'm sorry. I don't need to be seen godfather one two or three anytime again soon. Okay. I've seen him all about 500 times each

[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:44.940]
And my whole concept now and the reason we talked about movies the last couple of witches because I'm being turned out

[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.860]
A whole bunch of great new movies that I never saw before they may not be brand new as far as the theater right now

[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.060]
But wouldn't it last you know a couple of years right?

[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.120]
And they're all great

[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:55.940]
The game was great

[00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:58.720]
Merican psycho was great

[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.160]
Requiem for a dream out of care. What this guy says. I'll take Requiem for a dream any day of the week over godfather two

[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.600]
Godfather one no godfather one still up there my top five

[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.720]
I and Requiem for dreams my top five

[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:11.640]
slow starting

[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:21.140]
I just I don't understand it. I think maybe this guy's had too many bad trips through sunrise lakes

[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:28.000]
He's just he's got his aversion to people like Sarah and her neighbors. I think maybe that's what the problem is

[00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.280]
Here's a call from Miami. Hello

[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.200]
Good morning you. Yes, sir. Can you play the for all paper?

[00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:37.620]

[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.940]
You know, huh? See what I mean. What I tell you

[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.020]
No

[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.220]
First of all, let me say this to you as much as I like sud suds doesn't do a show

[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:17.400]
Well that that show with suds and George was pretty good. How about suds and George with the strippers and all that

[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.040]
That was a great show. That's the possibility George and suds. We'll put that on there

[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.020]
Also, I wanted to just take a moment to mention one of my memorable characters

[00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.120]
Because I didn't get through yesterday Marifa to me and my cousin Vinnie

[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.520]
Okay, anybody

[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.980]
Is that standout? Didn't see it anybody see it. I saw it. It was all right

[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.900]
My cousin Vinnie is a great movie. Also anything Marissa Tomeda's is really good

[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.280]
Okay, like a untamed heart. Do you ever see that? We'll think your word for it. Thanks. Okay, get out of here

[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.800]
Here's the fact that says when you're gone this summer

[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.020]
I think Joseph Geckierner's hurricane game partner Don Bailey Jr. should fill your time slot

[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.880]
It could just scream and orgasm about football because as you know, that's all this time cares about

[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.640]
They could scream and like orgasm together is what he said

[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.220]
Oh my

[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:08.980]
If these two are busy mocha just pull them eight hours shift every day

[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.620]
He'd be so exhausted by the time you came back

[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:14.160]
He'd have to be tired and that would benefit all parties involved get the honey juniors

[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.920]
That's what the fact says. Okay. That's what it says Joe

[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.540]
Should we put Joseph Geckier on there just for last term?

[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.600]
Joe Z get him on there

[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.000]
Okay, list is going like toxic. We can put that new pull up there anytime we want Carlos

[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.980]
So just mention that in case you interact and air see working on the on the hot couples thing and the polls

[00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.920]
So I'm typing out the poll and sending it to him so he does have to do that. All right. Don't not don't start getting all defensive on his behalf

[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.800]
Okay, he can handle it. He's a big boy. I mean really big. Are we gonna put Georgian suds on there? Yeah, I just said yes

[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.520]

Did you see some of the hose they got on a wall dribbin in there?

[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.540]

[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.880]
Oh, it wants to see some of the hose dripping on the wall

[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.340]
Farts and burps. There you go

[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.140]
We got it like love that guy

[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.000]
Well, we don't I don't know in person. I've never met the guy

[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.640]
But I've said it consistently from before he was on a state. Well, he was on from ESPN

[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.580]
It wasn't really on the station

[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:32.020]
He just doesn't have a voice radio and it is his pretty much his real voice what being a boy told me yep

[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.580]
You're in there and like bonded with him in between and the thoughts like that

[00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:41.360]
See nobody could fake that because if you try affecting that sound within about 20 seconds your vocal chords will start hurting

[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:43.720]
And you'll never be able to speak again. You know I'm saying

[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.560]
So that's his voice in fact here's a fact from Anthony by the way Anthony don't tell me how to react to good pull Anthony

[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.960]
Anthony 22 male listeners since May of 1998 excellent. That's our demographic Anthony sent us some naked pictures

[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.020]
Scott for all sounds like he's doing a bad impression of Tom Arnold also you read your pull results wrong

[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:03.480]
I don't want to instruct you how to do your show then don't Anthony

[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:07.720]
We should read the winner of the pull last read from the bottom of the top like in Hebrew I guess

[00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.900]
Isn't how you do in the Hebrew you read from the bottom of the top or backwards something like that

[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:15.320]
Well anyway, thanks Anthony. That's for you sweetheart

[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.280]
Okay, we're gonna get that new pull up. I don't want to be pushy, but it seems to me

[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:19.960]
I could be wrong

[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.060]
But it seems to me that if he puts the new pull up there then he'll get his leisure

[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.040]
He can do the thing with the pictures for our contest. He said the people can start voting on that

[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.800]
You see what I'm saying. Yeah, I'm sure it's what he's doing

[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:34.440]
Are you

[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:41.500]
Let me call him make who should fill in for Neil this summer George Rick and suds for all and

[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:45.840]
just belches and the best thing I told I told this guy

[00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:52.320]
The other day I said literally the favorite thing I hear when that guy does that is back third man

[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:59.460]
Who should fill in for Neil this summer George Rick and suds for all linse amules Steve Kane the beast

[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:00.140]
oh

[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.660]
Carlos aka beener boy

[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.200]
Georgian suds or joezy joezy gacking

[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.100]
Geozy gacking sucks okay, okay, that's the choice is so far

[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:15.940]
And I'm we aren't you bitterly disappointed recommend for dream we had the one one or two faxes two I guess

[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.920]
And we had a one guy more call so far who saw it last night try to watch it and could get into it

[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:24.980]
It was too slow and you want to watch and godfather to again. I've never met anyone

[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.940]
That wasn't blown away by that movie

[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.900]
I mean, that's one of the okay. I'll say ten. I'll stretch it

[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.680]
It's one of the ten best movies ever made that's not my opinion. That's a fact right

[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.840]
It's a non-debitable. It's like saying today is Thursday where we are right here. It's it's Thursday. Okay

[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.400]
There was it was flawless. There was nothing wrong with it

[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:47.800]
And as far as it's starting slowly what does that mean it started slowly? It's just it in fact

[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.680]
If it would have started any faster you never would have lived to it right

[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:56.300]
Because that's the idea the whole movie it starts a little slower than it can like speeds up and it can

[00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:01.180]
Lwamed up and water for the point we like you know like you feel like you just dropped acid

[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:07.560]
I don't know I'm bitterly disappointed, but not surprised not surprised. That's this crowd

[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:14.220]
There's the watching caddy check here's homestead hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir

[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.020]
Question coming into summer vacation season you used to talk about Amsterdam a lot

[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.860]
You don't seem to really talk about it

[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:27.260]
Your opinion changed it's just from within there versus going there on the great place to visit

[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.860]
But it's not a place to live. That's the problem

[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:34.000]
Okay, it's too backward to live there. It's too difficult to do everything. It's tough

[00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.420]
Okay, good provocations still there. Oh, sure

[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.460]
Okay, appreciate it in it. You going

[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.600]
I'm going to try to have a great time in. Thanks. I'll see you on the damn rack

[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.460]
I'll see you by the old church

[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.580]
I'll see you on new and dyke

[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:56.060]
I'll see in on the prison craft

[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.020]
Let's see. I'm warning you if you put Joe Ziggie's sucks on I will vote for the dick and bush

[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.480]
That is that's quite a threat. They're going to vote for a trainee in the awmeister. Yes, what is that thing on

[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.420]
Moe's head and that ghastly picture on qm? It's that dead muskrat

[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:19.160]
In fact, you know who's really upset with Moe? I know a lot of people are, but you know who's really pissed off with him

[00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:23.980]
Hope I don't know if I should talk about this on here, but I heard rumors that the

[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.720]
Peta people really pissed

[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:31.800]
That he's walking around with that animal because it appeared to be still moving around a little bit if you if you look at that picture

[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.020]
closely you'll see that every time you click out of it it's in a different position

[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:41.920]
So the pita people are really pissed off with Moe. It says can you play these super Moe bit? What what is the super Moe bit?

[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.640]
I don't know

[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.500]
Do do do do do

[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.840]
I see that's what they wanted to hear

[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:56.180]
I see well they know that this is my last day before vacation so they're gonna really be pushy today

[00:29:56.180 --> 00:30:02.300]
They want to get to me just like that thing with a pole Gary Oldman's Dracula, but that's your fake. That's I didn't know even

[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.920]
Beenerboy was under that he knew it. He knew your full of crap

[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:13.720]
5 6 7 0 5 60 pond there must be somebody out there who watched that on the iFC last night and enjoyed the movie who's armed to tell us that

[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:20.700]
Huh your Ralph Sellefax this I'm talking about who's willing to verbalize it discuss it. Okay critique say something

[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:24.060]
Here's dear field hello

[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.180]
Hello, yes sir

[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.280]
Yes

[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:33.480]
Meal you remember the movie from the mind they all who called you and

[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.060]
start dealing the back and let's try to

[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.760]
The best you over for dinner. What was that name

[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.580]
Trying to have me over for dinner

[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:50.140]
Yeah, she she started doing the fact and I think the dad and tried and right you for a party and then you cussed around real good

[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:50.920]
What's in it?

[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.000]
You don't mean Ellie Brecker do you

[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.320]
Yeah, I hear that did you edit on tape a couple years ago. That was so funny

[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:01.400]
I don't I have no idea what he's talking about she invited me to what to dinner

[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:05.700]
I don't know do you have any ideas she first of all Ellie Brecker never stabbed me in the back there was Pat Curry

[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.640]
That's a real old bit but Pat Curry never invited me to eat remember Pat Curry. She was the radio

[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:14.900]
See this is the thing at the local newspapers to show you what experts they got

[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:20.860]
A Kevin Baxter he was the radio TV guy when he first came to town at the hair when he came in at the bus station

[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:26.620]
And all of a sudden he's a sports guy Michael Mayo used to be a sports guy at the Harold now

[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:31.320]
He's a columnist guy like general a crap no more sports

[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:38.800]
Tom Zika used to be the used to head to cat the dog racing now. He's the radio TV expert. I mean the TV expert you know on a radio

[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:44.820]
And the same with Pat Curry she was the radio TV writer then she became the religion editor for the Harold

[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:50.180]
Well, she had religion which give you an idea why she wasn't too fond of me. She was the religion pervert. I expert

[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.600]
Let's see who should fill in for Neil this summer. I just voted on here. Okay. Oh, he did not vote for beena boy

[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.820]
sorry to pray to that

[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.600]
Why why isn't this working?

[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.880]
Is this the pull is not and let me say oh the votes are on her already

[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.660]
Look at that. Rick and suds have four Georgian suds have four. Georgians got two out of the first ten votes

[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:19.480]
So there you go the pull is up and then a little bit like after ten o'clock will have the pictures up over the hot couples and you can vote on that

[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.960]
And this is a very important one because whoever the winner is gets that nice trip to the Bahamas three days and two nights

[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.740]
And maybe we'll have to take some pictures while they're there

[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.700]
The urge would like to take some pictures, right? Especially if one with couples wins

[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.020]
I think Carbels would like to take some of those pictures too. Here's a deer field. Hello

[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:41.300]
I'm gonna hear field. Yes, sir. How's going to the uncle Neil great? Hey, did you

[00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:45.420]
Happen to catch in the for all show? Was he saying that man? Did he despise you or was that just a joke?

[00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.800]
I didn't hear him say that I thought I just played the cart where he said the the bit where he said he loves me

[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:54.920]
Oh, okay, I wasn't sure hey, did you what's he the announced? Probably landed rashes?

[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.300]
Yes for one season and they blew his ass out of town

[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:02.300]
If you heard what he said when they were down nine nothing now he said boy, we're really taking it up the ass tonight

[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.480]
Well, I thought it was kind of funny

[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:11.320]
Well great addition to the dysfunctional family. Okay, thanks. He thought it was kind of funny. We're taking it up the ass tonight

[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:16.700]
Yeah, he's he's so raw he makes that he makes everybody else including me look very tame by comparison

[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:20.280]
Which is kind of interesting clearance because at a time when we're under the

[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.060]
gigantic Palomar microscope

[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:27.320]
Not just a telescope, but the microscope to see the microbes to make sure that they're all clean and liby white

[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:33.160]
I mean I did hear the f-word last night, but again, I'm sure must have been dumped because I'm hearing the predile here

[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.160]
Right sure must have been dumped when you think otherwise time jick had a column about that today and he doesn't well. He might

[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:44.900]
Yeah, he was I did the trashers game for one season and they blew my I somewhere I told you I got that on

[00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:48.340]
On the mini disc in there somewhere believe me. You don't want to find it

[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.560]
I mean who wants to hockey game the little camera. It's just I don't understand it

[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:54.600]
See it's it's a maybe I'm an old funny dutty

[00:33:54.600 --> 00:34:00.540]
Maybe I'm just out of touch with what's in and what's hip now, but that that sound to me is like you know

[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:07.600]
It's like the taking a razor not fingernails, but like a razor a straight razor and scraping it on a blackboard

[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.800]
And believe me. I think we're safe

[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.540]
I think the moment I don't have to worry too much about them sticking him inserting him in the morning show

[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.740]
Because I mean, it's enough tolerating your first mole with his arrogant bombastic sound

[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:22.500]
That's that's a little bit somebody preaching at you when you get up out of bed in the morning

[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.960]
But also guilty with that squeak, you know that little squeak

[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.780]
But combining that with that with that

[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:35.760]
Boy a little bit a little over the top when you think a little bit. I don't know where that guy came from

[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.320]
940 20 till 10

[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.620]
At 560 wqa I'm speaking of muskrats on ahead

[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:47.860]
There are some guys who think that the way to cover up their oozing bald spot is with like a dead animal or something

[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.800]
It looks like a dead animal

[00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:52.460]
Bob Eisenberg used to have that he used to have that awful nasty thing

[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.760]
It looked like a twin of the one that mow wears and then we said hey Bob how about going over to Chuck Alphiery

[00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.420]
You know a guy like you a big shot like you

[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:00.580]
Can't afford to be walking around looking like that

[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:06.540]
And he went over to Chuck Alphiery and we all were amazed and how almost human Bob Eisenberg looked and he'll make you guys

[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.720]
Look even better than Bob because you probably got a better head start

[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.680]
You know what I said a better head start. I got it. That's exactly what I meant

[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:18.000]
Be sure I mentioned the arranges when you call Chuck Alphiery of gonna extra two or bucks off the already reasonable price of his natural

[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:44.860]
Give him my phone number and it's red

[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.900]
Ted and let him come over

[00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.920]
Man you are let you're gonna elect the thought police

[00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:53.560]
Ted

[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.280]
Ted this wasn't a presidential election. This is a primary, okay?

[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.160]
I didn't have a chance to vote for the other side. Give me the chance to vote for the other side

[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.000]
What my pal rick voted for a Nazi? I knew this would be

[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.540]
I didn't vote for a Nazi

[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.100]
Okay, what happened to Lorenzo and Pamela

[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.340]
On our on our high couples

[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.760]
He's on the phone so he can't answer

[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.760]
I see because we now see an all fairness we put them on here. There's about 18 of them or 20 whatever it is

[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.880]
Uh, we put the photos on in alphabetical order. So it's not to skew it anyway

[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.740]
But Lorenzo and Pamela the names are there, but there's a big slot. There's a big empty slot

[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.800]
As a matter of fact if you look a few up you'll also see a big slot. I mean

[00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:38.100]
I don't realize we had like a pornographic picture on there

[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:40.420]
George and Susan

[00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:43.100]
Have you seen that?

[00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.180]
Have I seen it?

[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:50.160]
More than a hundred times? I think we had to cover up parts

[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.600]
Yeah, let's get Lorenzo and Pamela on her we have to have like an even playing field here

[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.760]
Okay, we don't want to have like a

[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.040]
Everybody on her sent one in the beginning

[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:04.020]
And then like we're discriminating against them. So I guess before you vote we have to get that straight now little technical grids there for Eric

[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.500]
Okay, I don't want to be picking on the political glitch that might be on your side because I'm seeing Lorenzo and Pamela fine

[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.540]
Well, they're not on my side sweetheart

[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:17.680]
I don't especially see the man that comes back. What try refreshing and see if it comes back. Okay. Here. I'm refreshing. Okay

[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.360]
Oh, is that refreshing or what?

[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.700]
I just popped the certs into my back dome and was real refreshing

[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.920]
I guess that comment about the thrashers are taking it up the ass tonight

[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:31.600]
That wasn't good enough to keep the furrow on the

[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.920]
Francher games. Okay, I'm refreshing, but it's not doing anything. Okay. It's doing this real slow

[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.240]
You know what I mean like the slow crawl yeah

[00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.360]
And it's not refreshing so there's obviously some kind of a glitch

[00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.520]
Eric is still resizing the pictures. That's why I haven't put the link up to it

[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.600]
That's just why I wasn't finding it either. Yeah. Oh really

[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.240]
That's just another incident. It's only on my page right well

[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.280]
I better like postpone after a second because I already thought I voted. I don't want to see who I voted for

[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:59.300]
Although I think you probably go to yeah, I got a clip now. I can't even get to my home pages

[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:04.100]
He's got the whole thing screwed up. Okay Eric you have a good time up there. Okay. Have a few sandwiches. It'll boost up your

[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:05.380]
ego

[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.460]
I can't get anything on here now

[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:13.760]
I wanted to give the results on the fillin in because looked like Rick and suds were like one of the thing and that's not good

[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:16.420]
Is it? No

[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.480]
Let's see Jim says on the facts here. I think George and Fox News Heather should fillin

[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.860]
Well, George said he'd like to fill her in, but that's about it

[00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:29.280]
I don't think that's gonna happen either now. They're times soon. Oh here comes my home page. Maybe there's the uh

[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.300]
Thing at the top the big oh, but I don't I don't see nothing. Okay. Obviously he's having some difficulties up there

[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:36.540]
See you put too much pressure on him all on one day, you know

[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:43.120]
Sorry between the pool and then all these pictures manage it a little bit too much pressure for fat man up there to handle it or land though

[00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:46.460]
You know he's got a lot of important branches to eat up there

[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.940]
And he just can't look at that. I've got all kinds of stuff on here except my home page and except for those damn pictures

[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:53.060]
I wanted to see

[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:59.920]
5 6 7 0 5 if we don't get one call from somebody who saw a record we have for a dream last night and liked it

[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:04.360]
I'm gonna be so it's gonna ruin my whole vacation. Anybody believe it? Oh no, it sounds good though

[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.620]
I might play at what I'm gonna do with just out of protest. I'm gonna play different rel tape

[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.860]
I can't be proud

[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:13.700]
Yeah over and over again is what I'm gonna do. Just gonna play it all day

[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.980]
Wow, what just to aggregate everybody. Oh, he was getting a few votes in there last time. I was able to

[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.140]
Can you see the pull result?

[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.300]
No, no

[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.240]
No, I try to go back

[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:29.620]
I try to go back to the secret page where we got you know our backdoor

[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.120]
Yeah, I can't get in it. Can't even get in the back door, huh?

[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:38.620]
I guess they're gonna Fox News other none of us can get into it. Well, I guess Eric's pissed off now. He's gonna show us

[00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:43.600]
He's gonna show us you start picking on him and since he's got the master control up there in Orlando

[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.620]
He's got us locked out of everything. Okay

[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:48.840]
I guess we got a little bit too carried away for his lincoln

[00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:50.400]
Here's Naples. Hello

[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:52.620]
Hello, yes sir

[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:56.600]
Hey, I think it's no brainer Neil got to have Scott for Elle

[00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.440]
If you guys don't put Scott for Elle on you put George. He sounds like a funeral home director

[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:07.020]
Yeah, I have to switch over to the Tony Bruno show. I see some other words you want to go with a real gravely voice on there

[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:08.740]
That sounds enough to make you work on nuts

[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.420]
Hey, he's a world-class talent

[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.780]
One of the top stations in the country

[00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:19.640]
I see okay. Thank you very much. He's a world-class talent

[00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.020]
You know something that that could be the greatest call we've ever had on this show all years

[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.320]
I've been on the market that could be

[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.780]
That could be the greatest call I've ever had in my life

[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:32.420]
A world-class talent. That was the greatest endorsement I ever got well

[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:36.440]
He didn't necessarily say world-class broadcaster. Maybe there's some other talent. He's got the win or oh about yet

[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:39.820]
I think he was over there on the 441s. Yeah, maybe that's where he was

[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:45.360]
5 6 7 0 5. Oh look at that. We already got I got my thing back. Thank God

[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.800]
Who should fill in for Neil this summer 92 votes

[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:49.800]
Rick and suds 34

[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.500]
George and suds 21. Our suds will come in a couple of times right?

[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:58.620]
All as much as I can though drag his ass in here if you feed him he'll come in right

[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.220]
George by himself 17

[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:06.460]
Forrell's got eight world-class talent for Wells got eight

[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:12.080]
Lynn Samuel's three Steve Cain three the beast appear and you know who you know who loaded those two

[00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.060]
beast and zack

[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:16.900]
Is there something going on with those two by the way?

[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.640]
Something going on with the poll apparently it's getting attacked the George haters. I think girl coming out in force

[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.720]
Why is that?

[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.520]
Because Eric says that the CPU uses is going nuts

[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.600]
That somebody's definitely trying to do something to our server

[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:35.240]
Wouldn't mean they're trying to do something to our server. What does that mean?

[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:40.700]
Or there's way too many people trying to access apart that they normally don't access all at once

[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.040]
Would you just see the two of you just you you fight about this between yourself

[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:49.200]
I myself think that we're getting a great response here. Okay. We're gonna find response and whatever it is

[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:53.640]
We're gonna do what we want anyway. They know that it's it's already a done deal. So what the misses?

[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:58.860]
No, I meant the glitching that was going on that we could when we couldn't put your bitch in about the glitching okay?

[00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:00.500]
We're gonna stick your ass in the kitchen

[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.300]
With Duff

[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:06.980]
So he let's drag you up to the guy damn wall and therefore when he gets back

[00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:10.860]
Beater boys got appeared. That's what he's upset about. He's only got two votes

[00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:16.520]
And Josie's got to your time with Joseph Gaki for last and the beast how do you like that? That's the category you're in I got three

[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:21.560]
You're in dead line. Oh, yeah, he's got no they don't want to hear that crap. You got three not on my thing

[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:24.980]
You don't have three. Well, let me refresh it and just make sure while you hold it again

[00:43:26.900 --> 00:43:30.440]
Okay, he probably just voted again to get out of the tie with a beast and Joseph Gaki

[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.300]
See now I'm trying to refresh it and I can't do it. I just thought of something what's that?

[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.540]
Carlos does have the technical ability to make this poll already poll do whatever he wants

[00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:41.720]
That's right any result he wants sure

[00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:44.660]
Why do you think why do you think that Dracula that brown stoker's Dracula?

[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:48.900]
We don't like what was what he was going to do in the morning why he was here late right?

[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.620]
That's why we don't have any bedtime stories up. Oh, we got Carlos doing 600 votes

[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:57.500]
That's who's doing it by the way Eric Carlos is dickin with it. I'm doomed. He's dickin with our pool

[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.120]
Wait didn't he hear this about just he been through this is so sad

[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:07.820]
I mean MSNBC why don't they just give it up. Okay, give it up boys give it up. Give it up boys come on give it up

[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.880]
Ventura will ease in the TV host job tonight

[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:16.240]
Did you read this? I skimmed it. Oh

[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:20.900]
Ventura's introduction to the MSNBC audience will be low key

[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.540]
I'm tonight's edition of Leicester Holt Live which airs from 8 to 9 p.m

[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.260]
He'll present a five minute segment from save Paul

[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:28.880]
hahaha

[00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.340]
Called hero of the week

[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.900]
Ventura will gradually fill longer segments during that hour in the coming weeks until the network thinks he's ready to take over the entire hour

[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.180]
That's expected to happen during the summer, but sorenson would not speculate on the date

[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:44.800]
Sorenson being

[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.160]
Whoever does program Eric Sorenson MSNBC president

[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:55.660]
The plan will also help MSNBC get experience in airing a live show based in the midwest something no cable news network has ever attempted

[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:03.860]
Can you imagine the technical difficulties of doing that?

[00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:16.300]
So in other words, he's so bad that they're just going to start him off for five minutes and then like maybe six minutes and then maybe a week or two, seven minutes and eventually work him up to three

[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:29.000]
a minute and an hour and then maybe by the end of the summer he can fill a whole hour up. See the problem with Jesse Ventura, even though we like certain things about him, is the fact that he has a very, very affected, strange way of speaking.

[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:36.300]
He reminds me of Bob Woodward, you know, from Woodward and Bernstein, okay, that very pedantic slow way to do that.

[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:41.780]
Yeah, and it's just telling. No, not like you're doing, you're like doing Brian Murray. By the way, how about those mighty ducks?

[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:49.540]
There's nothing like that. They beat the goddamn vile. Looks like the mighty ducks in the Stanley Cup finals. Maybe Tom Jek is onto something, but I sure doubt it.

[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:57.520]
CBN, he dismantled a team that he brought his brother into coach, which everybody hated him. So don't give me some dance about Brian Murray. We should never let him go. Right. Sure.

[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:12.580]
Who should fill in for Neil this summer? There's a hundred. Look at this. It's just, it's your right. It's just out of control. 157 votes. Rick and suds 57. George, 33. George and suds 32.

[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:31.500]
For all 15 15 votes for for all. That's it man. Her story, not history, her story soon to be released. The enigma continues. No exception to this is Michael's latest single of the album screen with a sister Janet.

[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:43.180]
Amidst the usual chaotic lyrics and thriving beat. Our producers here at Unseld mystery scoured no less than 33. Worse in more than 15 groaning noises.

[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:59.520]
The millions of fans of Michael Jackson might ask themselves, what does it all mean? Could it be Michael has some sort of medical problem? Perhaps it's an offshoot of Tourette syndrome or just the annoying whalings of a confused and gender questioning man show.

[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:10.240]
And yet another question does Michael write these distracting hard sounds in everyday life, just one singing. For example, might this happen in a restaurant?

[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:21.940]
Is it like I have the prime rib? And I think the title with sour cream and for dessert the custard pie?

[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:35.940]
The real tragedy is that some of his finer songs about helping poor children worldwide are greatly spoiled with those distracting.

[00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:42.350]
Who? Have the children make the world a better place to live?

[00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:44.830]
Who? Teeny? Ah!

[00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:54.330]
Anybody has a clue as to why Michael continues to make these god-of-all noises? Why this man is so annoying? Please call and solve mysteries.

[00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.290]
Who? Ah!

[00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:58.130]
I apologize.

[00:47:58.810 --> 00:48:05.330]
He started sounding a little like a feral. You know what? Well, we got some bad news for it. The reason I played that. Robert Stack, one of my very favorite actors,

[00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:15.250]
whose granite-eyed stare and menacing baritones spelled trouble for fictional criminals and TV's, the untouchables and real ones that unsolved mysteries, died at his home he was 84.

[00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.210]
And that depressing? That's about to happen.

[00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:28.890]
Stacks wife Rosemary found him slumped over the couple's LA home about 5 p.m. yesterday. The actor underwent radiation treatment per prostate cancer in October with his wife's city died of heart failure.

[00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:36.550]
He was feeling so good, she said today. He had a bout with a tumor but that was gone. It wasn't that it was his heart. He was too weak. He wouldn't have lived through a bypass.

[00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:38.770]
Robert Stack is dead. Oh!

[00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:47.850]
One of the good guys liked him a lot. He was out effing standing. Robert Stack. And so was that show speaking to the untouchables.

[00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:50.910]
Right. And so was unsolved mysteries. That's one of my favorite shows.

[00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:56.550]
Here's the fact that we got a battle going on. It's a hot couples thing.

[00:48:58.410 --> 00:49:03.190]
George and Susan, 61, Aaron and Amy, 60.

[00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:10.630]
And then after that, it's like Lidian and Robert have 10 and it's, you know, right now at the moment. I mean, it is a whole week to go.

[00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:17.210]
But George and Susan and Aaron and Amy are kind of like what's your name? What Jennifer Conley asked to ask.

[00:49:18.370 --> 00:49:22.630]
When you say cheek to cheek. Cheek to cheek. Man, they're doing it.

[00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:30.470]
Bracket. Something like that. It is tight. Here's a fact that says with your logic, Neil, suds, wait a minute before I get to that one.

[00:49:32.050 --> 00:49:42.290]
Oh, this is a great fact from Rich and Miami Springs. Great facts. I had to go to the station last week to get some tickets at when I was amazed at what I saw sitting in the receptionist's seat.

[00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:48.950]
Absolutely correct. I've heard you talk about freaky carlos before, but never in my wildest imagination thought it looked like that.

[00:49:49.610 --> 00:49:56.390]
If Mohawar David had ever needs a new piece, he need not look any further than that scary black Rapunzel looking thing hanging on freaky's chin.

[00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:04.350]
Also, don't forget to find the blurb from Gildi two days ago when he and Mohawar talking about dick stocked in the basketball guy and Gildi said, I like dick a lot.

[00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:12.050]
Yeah. God, I worked. Thank you very much. I like dick a lot is what he said. He says a lot of interesting things. Don't you, Gildi? Up the butt.

[00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:18.690]
We have drop-ins up the butt from Gildi. And then of course we got drop-ins up the butt from I hate New Yorkers for all on the radio.

[00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:25.430]
I mean, he's he has set a new standard for drop-ins, you know. He raised the bar problem without doing anything.

[00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:32.730]
I mean, he didn't even do anything. He shares the facts from Wally and Deerfield. Who's got a chronic? He says I wonder if the hero does analyze the photos in a couple session yet.

[00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:43.830]
They might check out the Robin Tanny photo closely. Rob has a very suspicious wet spot in a strategic location. Very controversially says.

[00:50:45.110 --> 00:50:51.530]
Good point, Wally. We'll have to get right on it. You first. And then this one, see they don't understand it.

[00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:55.770]
And it puts me in a position where I have to like make a little bit of a criticism about our good friend, Sud.

[00:50:55.910 --> 00:51:04.350]
But it is true. It says with your logic, Neil, Suds either with George or Rick is blowing Joe Joe out of the water by 80 plus votes, 280 to 200.

[00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:09.250]
Perhaps you should have just had Suds on the pool. The problem being that Suds doesn't do a show alone.

[00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:16.570]
Well, that makes us feel like duty. Well, don't blame me, but he just whatever it is. He's a great sidekick. He's a funny guy. We love him to pieces.

[00:51:16.570 --> 00:51:21.730]
But he just remember those days when Rick would be sick and he doesn't want to.

[00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:30.570]
But isn't it a little bit strange? Go to hell. No, it is. He just he can't do a show alone. In other words, if Rick was sick,

[00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:34.710]
there would be no Rick in such a show that they'd play a tape or they'd have somebody fill in. Right.

[00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:41.010]
As opposed to when I was out sick around vacation, the bird would do the show. Now you hated it and all of that.

[00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:47.870]
But he did. He was capable to do in the show in his own in his own fashion. Well, I can't help it if you don't like it. Well, that's where it goes.

[00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:58.290]
He doesn't like to drive. He doesn't like to drive. To drive the show to be the hosting. He doesn't like to drive to see no John Levin.

[00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:05.990]
So what's he been doing all these months? He's been off. I got him to squatting. Okay. Well, so anyway, Suds is doing very well.

[00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:12.450]
But like I said, he hasn't do solo. At least shows anyway. God only knows when Pam is at work all day.

[00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:18.330]
What he's doing in that house watching old Beverly Hill believes in months to reruns. What any do it? Probably watching flipper even.

[00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:24.830]
Let's see how we doing on the other pull 577 votes. I thought we'd be up to 600 by now. We're smoking on this pull man.

[00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:31.970]
Heavy duty response. Nobody in that audience believed that I could go from finally getting off that movie thing that we milk for days and days.

[00:52:31.970 --> 00:52:38.550]
I know when we get a phenomenal response like this. You know what? Nobody believed it. They always sell us a little bit short.

[00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:43.470]
Does everybody from Miami is a New Yorker swirled all of you? There you go.

[00:52:44.770 --> 00:52:56.250]
Who should fill in for Neil this summer? Rick and Suds 186 George one 16 George and Suds one 11 to that 227. The beast 38 now that that's bogus. Anybody buying that?

[00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:02.530]
Yeah, he's got his mommy at work. Well, that's what I'm saying. That's called bogus is what that's called. Yeah.

[00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:10.110]
All of a sudden he made this big move. You got about as much chance to be in on this show again. Okay. Beast is you got about way in 125 tomorrow morning.

[00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:16.750]
Soaking wet. The beast in addition to which how we wouldn't be able to get him on the show anyway. Still got his tongue up for all's ass.

[00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:25.750]
Kind of embarrassing for all last night when the ball games started to walk out of their very gingerly with the beast hopping around behind him like a big boofo toad.

[00:53:27.850 --> 00:53:32.530]
Beast 38 for Ralph 36 George doing for Ralph's voice 26.

[00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:38.410]
Vener boy. Oh, you're talking about phony votes. Vener boy is a time with Steve Kane with 20 with Mr. Ego.

[00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:43.610]
Lynn Samuels with 14 and Joseph Gecky finally breaks double digits with 10.

[00:53:44.310 --> 00:53:46.830]
God only knows the sky's the limit for old Joe.

[00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:51.810]
Oh my. Oh my. Since I started talking about his penis face, you know, she's a lot more popular with this crap.

[00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:55.930]
Here's a call from sunrise. Hello.

[00:53:57.430 --> 00:54:03.450]
Yes, sir. Neil. Yes. I've been trying for days to get through. I'm sorry to keep going back to this movie thing.

[00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:10.290]
Anything you like, man. But after this and there's a great funniest movie I ever saw from the mid 60s. Robert Downey.

[00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:12.810]
Senior man, a movie called Putney Swope.

[00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:19.190]
Call one. He heard of it. Putney Swope. Yes. PUT. Any why.

[00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:26.490]
Never heard of it. Well, in a nutshell, one black guy works at an advertising agency.

[00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:33.490]
The boss dies and his last dying words. He makes him president. Then there's a complete reversal and the blacks take over.

[00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:39.730]
The right becomes subservient, including the help in the home. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.

[00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:43.770]
As a matter of fact, talking about one mind is a great line for the film.

[00:54:43.950 --> 00:54:47.330]
There's when my Johnson gets hard. It knows no discrimination.

[00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.050]
Putney Swope here. It is. I just found it in my book.

[00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:54.330]
I don't know how you'll ever find it, but it's so rare. But don't miss it.

[00:54:55.070 --> 00:54:57.610]
Okay. Thanks. Thanks. I got it down. You'll love it.

[00:54:58.130 --> 00:54:59.590]
You'll love it. You'll love it. You'll love it.

[00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:03.510]
He says, I love it. The book says, well, he wasn't going to let me read the books. I read him. So I could read it.

[00:55:04.050 --> 00:55:07.150]
A sat here on the American way of life written and directed by Robert Downey.

[00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:10.210]
And misfiring on most cylinders. Uh oh.

[00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:14.750]
The idea is promising enough the token black member of a big business board of directors has elected chairman.

[00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:17.550]
Because everybody votes for him on the assumption nobody else will.

[00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:28.070]
Actors some good lines in the opening scene. However, it all fizzles out in a series of damp squibs aimed at indiscriminately aimed at indiscriminately a capitalism black power TV commercials, etc.

[00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.390]
So the people in the book didn't like it. That's all I can tell you.

[00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.590]
Nothing is perfect. But I want to watch the Yankee game get done on the beast.

[00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:40.670]
27 after see what I mean. The beast was like he was like his lackey. He was just like his like he was lackey and licky.

[00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:42.070]
Licky, licky.

[00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:46.090]
Didn't say didn't have once tell us that Joseph Jackie had good head on the shoulders.

[00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:51.810]
27 past 11 at 560 WQ. I'll tell you where they got some good head on the shoulders.

[00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:57.290]
Nets are good friends at Halop Pontiac GMC Tom Laman Joe Prado. All of those blamed on it. A great folks.

[00:55:57.990 --> 00:56:01.850]
And they got some special Neil deals rolled off that assembly line. I just don't stop. Neil deal.

[00:56:01.850 --> 00:56:08.470]
Number one waiting for you right now at Halop. Get yourself 0% financing for 60 months on every 2003 Pontiac or GMC and stuff.

[00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:12.630]
By the way, a little known fact that Halop Pontiac was named after the great the trainer at Pompo Park.

[00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:15.890]
Bo Halop, did you know that? No, true story. No.

[00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:21.050]
Neil deal number two. Get up to a $4,000 rebate on every 2003 GMC and Pontiac and stock.

[00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:27.890]
Let me see it again because it's sensational. Get yourself up to a $4,000 rebate on every 2003 car truck and stock.

[00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:34.150]
And attention on your current and former military personnel. Get yourself an additional $750 rebate from your friends at Halop.

[00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:40.170]
Can't beat that. And as always, Halop's got a gigantic humongous almost never ending selection of dependable pre-owned cars,

[00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:46.070]
truck's SUVs on a lot of amazingly low prices. You don't have to worry about applying for credit at Halop because even if you want new Jeff DeForest,

[00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:54.850]
even if you knew the what's his name for all. They'll still cut to deal somehow at Halop. Don't forget to stop by and why did their test drive the all new and powerful Pontiac Grand Prix as well.

[00:56:54.850 --> 00:57:00.510]
Halop Pontiac GMC and their legendary location were they've been doing deals great for over 35 years,

[00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:06.010]
134.01 South Dixie Highway that's on US 1 across from the falls open every day, seven days a week.

[00:57:06.330 --> 00:57:12.970]
If you want more info on the Neil deals, it just makes sense to call the Neil Deal hotline sounds good to me at 1.885-344-211.

[00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:17.990]
1.885-344-211, and don't forget all Neil deals into the credit of Provelec,

[00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:21.610]
Deterford details at Halop Pontiac GMC where Tom Lehman always says,

[00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:23.330]
We are professional grade.

[00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:29.810]
My, and local, six is sports radio 560, you weigh QA-M.

[00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:34.190]
You get a lot of baby,

[00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:35.510]
R!

[00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:41.010]
The Neil Rogers on sports hall radio, WQ-A-M.

[00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:46.530]
The Neil Rogers on sports hall radio, WQ-A-M.

[00:57:47.810 --> 00:57:49.230]
Previously on the West Way.

[00:57:49.350 --> 00:57:59.850]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[00:57:59.850 --> 00:58:04.970]
Okay, sorry, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we try and just say no, I don't think it's going to work.

[00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:06.210]
Okay, sure.

[00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.650]
Is that how to do it?

[00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:12.450]
Oh!

[00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:16.330]
133, test show to Manon Finland who claimed that he got SARS and Toronto,

[00:58:16.330 --> 00:58:21.230]
he don't have SARS in the first place, and the WH yesterday declared the SARS crisis over in Toronto.

[00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.630]
It's safe.

[00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:22.530]
Costa is clear,

[00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:25.130]
some are shining, it's a beautiful day about 60ish.

[00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:28.930]
I just mentioned that in passing to make Merl happy and everybody else.

[00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:32.970]
After they screwed this place over something fierce, we've got a real battle going on.

[00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:38.810]
Oh, this guy will be really pleased to know, he says, did anyone but Misi Ron Popeel hitting his new rotisserie with a hammer on his new infomercial?

[00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:41.310]
That's not new, he's been doing that for a long time, right, Bener?

[00:58:42.250 --> 00:58:42.850]
Jesus, years.

[00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:46.870]
Yeah, he's been banging it with a hammer and the rotisserie too.

[00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:52.190]
And it's so fake the way he does it because he picks up the hammer and everybody knows what he's going to do.

[00:58:52.350 --> 00:58:56.250]
And then the, oh, you know, of course that audience, they're all getting paid like about 20 cent or whatever.

[00:58:56.730 --> 00:58:57.610]
They get a free one.

[00:58:58.850 --> 00:58:59.570]
30 cent.

[00:59:00.050 --> 00:59:03.070]
Yeah, they get a free rotisserie, but I do like that infomercial.

[00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.150]
And George will be amazed to know that there are, if there's nothing else on,

[00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:09.150]
and I see the Ron Popeel rotisserie infomercial, I'll watch it.

[00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:09.610]
Me too.

[00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:11.670]
See, there you go. It's entertaining.

[00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:14.710]
I mean, it's no pocket fisherman.

[00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.710]
No, but anyway, this fax is my vote is for George and Suds.

[00:59:18.730 --> 00:59:20.650]
Rick Rally should say unemployed and off our streets.

[00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:21.770]
That's a good point.

[00:59:21.850 --> 00:59:22.610]
I forgot about that.

[00:59:23.070 --> 00:59:24.110]
Keep them off the streets.

[00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:26.450]
We've got a battle going on, man.

[00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:29.130]
We have got a great battle on the Hot Couples contest.

[00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:31.450]
Aaron and Amy have edged into first place.

[00:59:31.470 --> 00:59:32.470]
Look at how many votes they got.

[00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:34.750]
That says 71 online.

[00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.150]
Oh, I haven't refried since 69 online.

[00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:39.250]
Well, I better refresh it, huh?

[00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:43.850]
Before I start reading the thing, well, by the time you do, George and Suds might have 69.

[00:59:45.150 --> 00:59:45.670]
Oh, do they?

[00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:49.150]
Well, you know, something now that I'm refreshed, maybe they both got more than that.

[00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:50.410]
How do you like that, Mr. Hot Shot?

[00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.950]
Could they?

[00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:52.090]
They're not though.

[00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:53.190]
Aaron and Amy 71.

[00:59:54.270 --> 00:59:54.930]
Naked George.

[00:59:55.110 --> 00:59:58.990]
I mean, George and Suds and 66 online might have.

[00:59:59.450 --> 00:59:59.810]
Oh.

[01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:02.630]
And then after that, it's like downhill.

[01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:03.990]
Lidie and Robert have 12.

[01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:05.850]
The good news is everybody's got at least one.

[01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:07.310]
Oh, of course a lot of them.

[01:00:07.610 --> 01:00:08.630]
The ones that have just one.

[01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.410]
We can only imagine who cast a vote, you know.

[01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:12.430]
But everybody's got at least one.

[01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:13.690]
And it's only the first day.

[01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:14.830]
You got a whole week to last Thursday.

[01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:16.930]
But this, and I think there's some people on here.

[01:00:17.010 --> 01:00:19.230]
I don't want to like show any favoritism because that would be bad.

[01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:21.930]
But I think Mel and Billy should have more than 11, don't you?

[01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:22.950]
Absolutely.

[01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:24.770]
And then there's some that I think ought to have fewer.

[01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:25.810]
But maybe they got a lot of friends.

[01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:28.610]
I think Mr. and Mrs. Anita, they're a really good looking couple.

[01:00:28.690 --> 01:00:29.410]
They only got six.

[01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.890]
You see them?

[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:32.410]
Mm-hmm.

[01:00:32.970 --> 01:00:34.330]
Don't you think they should have more than six?

[01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:34.890]
Absolutely.

[01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:36.690]
And there was another couple on here.

[01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:36.870]
Yeah.

[01:00:37.310 --> 01:00:38.970]
Chris and Odie have only a pair.

[01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.830]
That's bad.

[01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:48.690]
I think you see, I think that before you just start voting because you see a nipple or a breast or a ass or, you know, a.

[01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:51.410]
The penis, the penis one's Joseph Gack.

[01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:52.610]
He's picture by the way on our staff.

[01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:53.390]
Forget about that.

[01:00:53.690 --> 01:00:54.250]
He's a can.

[01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.910]
He's not eligible.

[01:00:56.350 --> 01:01:00.150]
But before you see like a body part, scroll the whole list up and down.

[01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:04.190]
Look back and forth and up and down and, you know, check who's being audited.

[01:01:04.350 --> 01:01:05.270]
And then cast your vote.

[01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:06.250]
This is something very serious.

[01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:08.830]
There's a good prize waiting for the winning couple three days in two nights.

[01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:12.690]
Stay at the Royal Oasis resort in Cassino and Bahamas and round trip airfare on Lake Error.

[01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:15.450]
Runner up gets dinner for two with the world famous pizza lot.

[01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:21.450]
And even though there might not be quite as sexy as going to the Bahamas, you'll hear a lot of great sex stories from Jeff Cohen at the pizza lot.

[01:01:21.850 --> 01:01:22.890]
But he won't or not.

[01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:25.730]
Church fires minister.

[01:01:25.730 --> 01:01:28.150]
But there's a lot of these priest things back in the news again.

[01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:29.410]
Ministers and priest and stuff.

[01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:31.690]
I guess now that we're not invading any new country today.

[01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.530]
There's time for some of these stories to sneak in on the wires.

[01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:36.850]
Con over where?

[01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.570]
Oh, a North Carolina.

[01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.610]
This must be because it's from the Charlotte observer.

[01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:40.110]
Mm hmm.

[01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:42.910]
A church in Christian school is dismissed.

[01:01:43.110 --> 01:01:43.910]
It's dismissed.

[01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.310]
It's the youth director who was charged Tuesday with a felony sexual offense with a student.

[01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:50.810]
Cliff Ryan Stokes.

[01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.350]
Is he kind of brown stoker?

[01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:57.970]
28 of Con over was arrested to do and it turned himself into police after returning from Alabama.

[01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.730]
Con over.

[01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:59.830]
Oh, brother.

[01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:01.230]
I wonder if he had a banjo on his knee.

[01:02:02.450 --> 01:02:05.310]
Stokes released Wednesday on $10,000 unsecured bond.

[01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:12.710]
Police chief Gary LaFone said he especially is department to complete his investigation by next week and turned info over to the DA's office for a grand jury review.

[01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:21.130]
Stokes was athletic director, girls volleyball coach and youth pastor for six years at Tabernacle Baptist Church and Christian schools.

[01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.270]
He said he's married with two children's.

[01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:29.650]
Church official said a 17 year old female student at the school was involved in that so-told school officials about the incident made the tooth.

[01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:32.470]
He did not return phone calls and we can't imagine why.

[01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:33.390]
Wow, there you go.

[01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:42.690]
Our church and school ministries are grieved and continue to be in prayer for God's grace and wisdom as we try to minister the families of young people.

[01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:49.390]
Effected by this terrible sin so the associate administrator of the school Gordon Finneason or whatever the hell his name is.

[01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.830]
Another one.

[01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:55.310]
Robert Chofel, the jovial former priest everybody called father Bob.

[01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:56.250]
Robert Chofel.

[01:02:56.590 --> 01:02:57.310]
Robert Chofel.

[01:02:57.330 --> 01:02:57.330]

[01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:58.750]
Robert Chofel.

[01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:00.210]
Yeah, who's that?

[01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:03.030]
We have his salesman from power 96 of that name.

[01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:08.390]
We do.

[01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:08.930]
We do.

[01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:16.430]
Anyway, the joke probably not to sin guy or it could be.

[01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:16.730]
You never know.

[01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:17.990]
We got a lot of proverts in that crowd.

[01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:19.450]
The jovial former priest.

[01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.330]
This is in Largo so it's not that far away.

[01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.650]
This is from the same P 10s.

[01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:24.670]
Sat Kama is the 20 year old man testified.

[01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:28.850]
The man said the priest sexually abused and nearly 20 years ago doing things unbefitting a man of God.

[01:03:30.270 --> 01:03:33.170]
Robert Chofel appeared to shake his head slightly at the worst of the allegations.

[01:03:33.170 --> 01:03:41.010]
His priests collar and robe long since taken from him latest to before a jury in sneakers and an oversized blue suit and sword of God to tell the truth.

[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:44.010]
He spoke words he hasn't said publicly in a year.

[01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:44.590]
It didn't happen.

[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:46.830]
I don't even remember him much less doing anything like that.

[01:03:46.830 --> 01:03:47.370]
It didn't happen.

[01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:48.870]
He said and the jury will decide.

[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:56.350]
The man who's not being identified because of the nature of the allegations said he kept the sexual abuse to himself partly out of embarrassment and fear he'd get into trouble.

[01:03:56.770 --> 01:03:57.710]
He wasn't a Catholic.

[01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.210]
He lived in Braydenton, visited the church with a friend.

[01:04:00.450 --> 01:04:02.210]
I thought I had done something wrong a man said.

[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.910]
How do you like that?

[01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:03.770]
Always reverse it.

[01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:04.790]
You know, maybe guilt should follow.

[01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:06.090]
Well, they tempted him.

[01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:10.110]
But the Yankees and this dumb bag is a red socks fan.

[01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:14.290]
See, he's not getting in and even the diabetes is licking and licking all over.

[01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.310]
He's not fooled.

[01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:16.830]
He's been around the block too many times.

[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:22.310]
He gets fooled by a little lackey, a little lackey like the beast with his red socks cap on.

[01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.490]
198 votes for Rick and Suds.

[01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:27.570]
That's kind of embarrassing.

[01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:28.030]
You know what?

[01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.090]
The Georgia's got 127.

[01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:29.990]
Georgia and Suds.

[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:30.330]
19.

[01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:31.630]
So that's 246.

[01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:35.530]
Yeah, you're leaving Rick into the, you know, the beast 48.

[01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:38.150]
How many of those do you think are phony?

[01:04:38.190 --> 01:04:39.110]
About 30, man.

[01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:39.570]
At least.

[01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:42.230]
Pharrell's got 40.

[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.310]
George's doing Pharrell's voice.

[01:04:44.550 --> 01:04:44.990]
27.

[01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:47.750]
Little Beena Boy has got 22.

[01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.310]
And he only voted 10 times.

[01:04:49.830 --> 01:04:55.690]
Mr. Ego, Steve Cain, 21, Lynn Samuels, 14, and Josie out of 626 votes is still stuck there with 10.

[01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.330]
Only 10 votes for old penis face.

[01:04:59.350 --> 01:05:00.570]
I guess the thrill is worn on.

[01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:02.330]
Oh, my, oh, my.

[01:05:03.010 --> 01:05:05.490]
What an embarrassing job he did on those UM football games.

[01:05:05.590 --> 01:05:07.290]
Him and my girlfriend Don Bailey Jr., you know what?

[01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.230]
Embarrassing.

[01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:09.030]
The understatement.

[01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:12.830]
See, this is what happens when Dave Lamont helped him put Sonny Hersh in an early grave.

[01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.350]
We never forgive you Dave, okay?

[01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:15.390]
You're not a bad guy.

[01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:16.190]
All you're farted.

[01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:18.070]
Don't be real bad during those UM baseball games.

[01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:18.790]
Real, real bad.

[01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:22.230]
But we'll never forget the fact that you put Sonny in an early grave.

[01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.690]
Don't you think?

[01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:24.510]
Oh, no question.

[01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:28.550]
Hey, let me tell you what I think and that his brandy shoes is like a miracle in town.

[01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:33.510]
Over 25 years they've been putting great shoes on people's feet and they're still going stronger than ever.

[01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.570]
Any independent family shoe store that lasts that long, especially in a picky town like South Florida,

[01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:39.450]
has got to be doing many, many things right.

[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:43.730]
For example, like offering you an unbeatable slice of men's and women's famous brand shoes like Rock Ports,

[01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:47.630]
Ecos, Mephisto, Timberland, Tarts, S.A.S. Floreshime, and lots more.

[01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.570]
They have a humongous range of sizes, men's 6 to 15, women's 5 to 12,

[01:05:51.570 --> 01:05:55.590]
and wits from the very little teeny tiny narrow to the big, big fat and wide ones.

[01:05:56.170 --> 01:06:00.750]
And don't forget their professional sales staff make sure you get a perfect fit every time to give you the best service going.

[01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:04.510]
And with over 40,000 pairs in stock and their 8,000 square foot megastore,

[01:06:04.930 --> 01:06:08.670]
you can bet Georgia's life and even Carlos too that they got exactly what you're looking for in stock.

[01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:12.810]
Brandy shoes as always you'll find them at 1290, North Federal Highway in Poppano Beach,

[01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:15.270]
they're open daily, 9 to 9, Sundays 10 to 5.

[01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:18.650]
Let's see our little paws there so you can put on the right tag next week.

[01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.790]
Thanks.

[01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:23.230]
It's a great time right now though to buy sabatos at Brandy's,

[01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:27.050]
all men's and women's styles 20% off, come and visit him or check him out on the web if you'd like it.

[01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:32.030]
Brandy's shoes that's what like two S's in there in the middle, Brandy's shoes.com.

[01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:37.150]
I got the local C650's, the radio's all yours now.

[01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:39.050]
You win!

[01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:44.310]
Meal, yeah!

[01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:52.790]
I'm sorry, man.

[01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:59.270]
You've got a freeze to what the hell's this all about?

[01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:04.750]
All of a sudden the Iraqis want a thought.

[01:07:05.430 --> 01:07:08.750]
It's like they've got not dead names on their brains.

[01:07:09.450 --> 01:07:14.470]
What the hell ain't feeling we were to bring back to Don Houthay?

[01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:20.650]
Why not just say thanks to the bridge and the yanks?

[01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.590]
Why not just say thanks?

[01:07:23.830 --> 01:07:25.570]
And stop robbing your own banks?

[01:07:26.070 --> 01:07:28.010]
Why not just say thanks?

[01:07:28.290 --> 01:07:28.430]
No.

[01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:31.290]
Oh, reload our tanks.

[01:07:33.310 --> 01:07:37.150]
He's been a lot of money, why are they so mad?

[01:07:38.050 --> 01:07:43.030]
Telling a month they'll have a Starbucks in back then.

[01:07:43.030 --> 01:07:46.530]
We'll give them Xbox games and can't see.

[01:07:47.070 --> 01:07:47.470]
Bleh!

[01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:52.070]
You could be wearing GameCog, old pants and watching Direct TV.

[01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:58.330]
Why not just say thanks to the bridge and the yanks?

[01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:01.110]
Why not just say thanks?

[01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.270]
And stop robbing your own banks?

[01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:06.290]
Why not just say thanks?

[01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:09.010]
No, reload our tanks.

[01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:16.290]
First guy I need when I walk into this place, this is the ad dude on the red section.

[01:08:16.410 --> 01:08:18.070]
I go, Fenway's for Pussies.

[01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:21.670]
Love him 46, 14 till noon at 5.60 W.D.C.Y.M.

[01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:27.030]
Speaking of whatever he just said, take a look at that poll.

[01:08:28.530 --> 01:08:29.990]
Aaron and Amy 81.

[01:08:32.050 --> 01:08:33.530]
Georgians Susan 74.

[01:08:34.190 --> 01:08:36.970]
And after that it's like, you know, I mean, I don't want to dismiss the other people.

[01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:39.310]
Mr and Mrs. Mark T. I've got 15.

[01:08:40.990 --> 01:08:42.030]
Everybody's got at least one.

[01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.210]
Some people I think probably should do a little bit better.

[01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:48.950]
But there's Aaron and Amy in first place and Georgians Susan are right underneath them.

[01:08:50.230 --> 01:08:51.090]
Or they like it.

[01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:52.530]
81 to 74.

[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:55.510]
I wonder if Aaron would let me flex his muscle.

[01:08:57.070 --> 01:09:00.150]
Anyway, see I don't want to get too much into it because then, you know, we'll start.

[01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:03.610]
They'll accuse us of favoritism and you'll start saying one thing and I'll start saying another.

[01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:05.470]
And then Beenerborg will throw in his two cents.

[01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:06.890]
Bola.

[01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:11.950]
Yeah, if I read that message again from the other day, I don't know if you would be in hot water, man, but probably deported.

[01:09:13.690 --> 01:09:17.350]
Here's a fact that says, I already heard about Robert Stackey who's one of the great ones.

[01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:25.190]
And Republican who was friends in college roommates with JFK and not a typical sour bitter GOP crow like so many other conservatives celebrities.

[01:09:26.490 --> 01:09:30.190]
Like Chuck Chakhton, for example, because Robert Stackey died.

[01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:37.610]
I know you're off the movie stuff for a little while, but I just saw written on the wind on DVD with Robert Stackey, Lauren McCall, Ra Kutsen and Dorothy Malone.

[01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.850]
It's a great flick and Stackey is excellent.

[01:09:40.650 --> 01:09:43.830]
And Dorothy Malone, it's great. He was always in everything.

[01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:48.670]
He's from serious drama to comedy. That's right. Airplane. How can we forget? He was so phenomenal in airplane.

[01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:50.210]
It was great.

[01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:55.330]
Well, the original to be or not to be with Jack Benny, our IP Robert Stackey.

[01:09:55.370 --> 01:09:59.730]
Thank you. Somebody acknowledges a famous person that we liked a lot actually dying, which really happens.

[01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:04.650]
Rarely, rarely happens. Like when a local radio person, a like Jerry Williams dies.

[01:10:05.730 --> 01:10:08.670]
Does Tom Zicker write about it? Does he even know who Jerry Williams was? No.

[01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:14.230]
In the old bit in the newspaper and the local paper, do they put that he worked at WNWS for a whole year in 1980? Was program director? No.

[01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:20.170]
See, Tom, you can make all the shots you want about Brian Murray and the mighty duck Shanishan at nil.

[01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:26.410]
But the fact of the matter is when it comes to covering the local scene, you're pathetic, man. You're a tragic.

[01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:33.170]
You could make an encyclopedia out of the important stuff that you missed just in six months in South Florida.

[01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:36.950]
And I'm not just talking about me or this station. I'm talking about all of these things.

[01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:42.350]
But don't confuse little Tommy with the fact that, you know, that sounds too much like work.

[01:10:42.790 --> 01:10:47.970]
I happen to do a little bit of research about people and things that happened before. He's ass-landed in the town from New York.

[01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:52.490]
You know what I mean? What do you mean? Screw him. That's what I mean.

[01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:58.330]
Dear Neil, my vote is for anyone other than George. If I had to listen him during the summer, I'd rather not wait a minute.

[01:10:58.330 --> 01:11:02.010]
Maybe ABK whoever this is didn't hear you doing the for all voice.

[01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:04.690]
I'll go tomorrow. I'll be fine.

[01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:09.070]
Says, if I have to listen him during the summer, I'll stab myself repeatedly with a rusty steak knife.

[01:11:09.330 --> 01:11:13.590]
I'll get him the knife. George might be good behind the glass, but as a host, he said,

[01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:16.370]
well, who's the house that he was good behind the glass? Cutless.

[01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:18.430]
What was that?

[01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:24.050]
But as a host, he sucks ass. How about the crow? And you know what they say rhymes with the crow?

[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:26.050]
No. Yeah, that's a rhymes of no chance.

[01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:30.410]
There'd be a cold day in hell before the crow gets on issue. I'll go and damn tea at that.

[01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:32.130]
I got your crow bodice right here, homeboy.

[01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.930]
Good. Keep it.

[01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:37.650]
Just just the aroma alone from that cashmere bouquet that he takes a shower and everything.

[01:11:38.370 --> 01:11:41.910]
Seriously, whoever met a guy that takes a bath and a tub of cashmere bouquet.

[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.730]
Man.

[01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.210]
This poll is just, and this is only the first day.

[01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:50.790]
Do you have any idea how intense this is going to be? Oh, yeah.

[01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:53.850]
Wow. It is amazing.

[01:11:54.930 --> 01:11:59.250]
And keep in mind that we can't put the modeling pictures on here from certain people, which would have probably,

[01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:01.270]
let's see, 83 to 81.

[01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:04.550]
George and Susan 81, Aaron and Amy 83.

[01:12:04.810 --> 01:12:08.230]
It is a battle runs mech and neck nose to hold a to nose.

[01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:10.730]
Right? Oh, yeah.

[01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:13.630]
I would be surprised if it goes all the way to the next Thursday night AM.

[01:12:13.730 --> 01:12:18.930]
I might have to like call in from out of town long distance just to get the blow down how things are going.

[01:12:19.950 --> 01:12:20.850]
Here's Miami. Hello.

[01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:23.010]
Neil. Yes, sir.

[01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:26.810]
I don't know what the topic is. Maybe it's just all over the place.

[01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:32.070]
But I like to get your take on the Cubans in the water and how much.

[01:12:32.090 --> 01:12:34.570]
They're the Cubans in the water? Yeah, and how much time?

[01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:37.070]
Well, it depends on what they look like. I like some of the Cubans in the water.

[01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.090]
Sometimes a drive back into bed either.

[01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:41.850]
A bear back, drive back. What does that mean?

[01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:47.410]
Well, it's been a money again on these people circling around them so they don't touch the people you're in.

[01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:51.430]
Right? And I'm thinking why are we wasting the time and money to do that when we're in the water?

[01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.710]
Because of Ilyana Rosanna, Rosanna Dan, that's why.

[01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:57.030]
But we're just going to pick them up and let them stay anyway.

[01:12:57.230 --> 01:12:59.070]
So why don't we just let them get on the boat and come on in?

[01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:02.330]
Well, because we got some people like you there,

[01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:03.710]
they're fivously trying to keep them off shore.

[01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:05.490]
So I don't mind when we're together.

[01:13:05.490 --> 01:13:09.730]
I just think it's kind of ridiculous for us to waste the time and the money to go through it.

[01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.970]
I got a great idea. Let's let Ilyana swim out there and rescue him. What do you think of that?

[01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:20.170]
That's pretty bad, but you know, I think it's pretty good.

[01:13:20.170 --> 01:13:22.650]
Yeah, well, I mean, I'm just saying we don't want to give her a handicap,

[01:13:22.650 --> 01:13:25.170]
but like I let weight on each foot would be a good start.

[01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:28.270]
That's 20,000.

[01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:29.570]
Have a great day, Pali.

[01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.390]
Sorry, man. See you.

[01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:33.550]
See you, Pali.

[01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.710]
That's what we're going to be doing to push up the station a little bit.

[01:13:36.770 --> 01:13:40.070]
We've got too many limperasted characters around the station including me.

[01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:44.090]
So this summer what we're going to do is have Jasmine Kay and Ferrell on together.

[01:13:44.290 --> 01:13:46.350]
Got bubblegum stick on my shoe.

[01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:49.070]
Yeah. See that's what they like. They can relate to that.

[01:13:49.810 --> 01:13:53.010]
5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60.

[01:13:53.550 --> 01:13:55.650]
See, I mean, this is it's just all accidental.

[01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:58.810]
You just you just run the cassette and everything is is a line.

[01:14:00.810 --> 01:14:04.970]
I knew that there was some tremendous talent in their summer when a guy said this is a world class talent.

[01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:07.270]
You can't just get it from listening right on through.

[01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:11.210]
But if you just listen in little little snippets, you know what I mean?

[01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:13.630]
Like snippet. It's like whiskey. You got to sip it.

[01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:15.610]
And then you snip it.

[01:14:16.670 --> 01:14:17.890]
Which is what you should have done.

[01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:18.750]
Don't cut!

[01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:21.510]
668 votes on a other pool.

[01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:23.490]
But we got votes up the ass today, you know what?

[01:14:24.490 --> 01:14:27.530]
Rick and Suds who should fill in for Neil this summer. Rick and Suds 2-11.

[01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:31.910]
George 132. George and Suds 129. That's 261 put together.

[01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:34.730]
The beast 54.

[01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.230]
Oh my god.

[01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:41.910]
The beast is 54 votes.

[01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:45.870]
Forl 41. George is doing Forl's voice 29.

[01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:48.150]
See, they like that. They are obsessed with that.

[01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:48.990]
I'm going to practice it on.

[01:14:49.290 --> 01:14:52.830]
How much even people that hit you like poison or nearly, they like it.

[01:14:52.930 --> 01:14:55.730]
Because it makes them subliminally. I forget that it's you.

[01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:56.810]
I'm going to pretend it's not me.

[01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.510]
Okay.

[01:14:58.230 --> 01:14:58.870]
I'm going to talk to sports.

[01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.810]
You know something that's a good idea for people who weren't listening to this since I'm leaving after the show today.

[01:15:03.370 --> 01:15:05.930]
And you'll be on tomorrow for six shows by the way.

[01:15:05.970 --> 01:15:06.810]
I'll be back a week from Monday.

[01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:08.350]
No, I'll be back a week from Tuesday.

[01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:09.670]
Week from Monday is Memorial Day.

[01:15:09.690 --> 01:15:10.750]
It's an active vacation day.

[01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:12.370]
Oh, look great at scheduling these.

[01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:12.610]
Oh!

[01:15:12.910 --> 01:15:13.410]
Look great planning.

[01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.090]
We're going to run for L tapes on that day.

[01:15:16.210 --> 01:15:17.550]
Beener Boy 23.

[01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:19.250]
Steve Cain 23.

[01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:20.350]
Lynn Sammills 14.

[01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:22.450]
And Josie is moving on Lynn's ass 12.

[01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:28.190]
Old penis post is moving in on Lynn's behind 14 to 12 out of 668 votes.

[01:15:29.810 --> 01:15:38.530]
See, I don't have time to do the show because I'm obsessed with no, no, seriously, I'm obsessed with going back and looking at the hot couples contest because it's so damn.

[01:15:38.610 --> 01:15:39.330]
Oh, look at that.

[01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:40.530]
It is so tight.

[01:15:40.930 --> 01:15:42.170]
George and Susan are better.

[01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:43.050]
No, it's a tie.

[01:15:43.350 --> 01:15:44.810]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

[01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:45.670]
So what you got on yours?

[01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:46.630]
Oh, my God.

[01:15:46.770 --> 01:15:47.970]
We just got a call from Amy.

[01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:49.130]
Yeah.

[01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.650]
She wanted to know if she can send another risk a picture and we could change it.

[01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.650]
I'm like, no, no, no, no, no.

[01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:55.410]
Well, she can say that.

[01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:56.510]
I will say.

[01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.930]
Yeah.

[01:15:56.930 --> 01:15:58.690]
I saw it.

[01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:59.330]
You can say that.

[01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:03.510]
That doesn't mean it will be on a website, but you can say that in George and Carlos would be like, ooh, and all over it.

[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:03.930]
All the problems.

[01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:05.330]
Bring it.

[01:16:05.630 --> 01:16:06.070]
Bring it.

[01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:06.790]
Bring it on, honey.

[01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:11.010]
No, but taking the end of it again, we never like had a limitation on how many times you could enter.

[01:16:11.190 --> 01:16:14.090]
See, if you said that they could have, they would have what?

[01:16:14.430 --> 01:16:16.250]
And then we wouldn't put it on, but we would have had it.

[01:16:16.450 --> 01:16:17.230]
See, you see how he is?

[01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:19.050]
That's what I just got through.

[01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:23.430]
If you were, if you would have been so busy looking at your chops, you would have heard what I just said.

[01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.390]
Anyway, it's a dead even tie 84.

[01:16:26.530 --> 01:16:30.370]
Now, I will say this because as you can't enter, you were doing this for three months, they could enter again.

[01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:38.870]
And if they would be creative enough, Amy and Erin, to be like, stark naked, like George and Susan are, and that picture out of their tied with, I think would be like a runaway.

[01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.470]
Of course, we don't really know what George looks like.

[01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.990]
Or Susan.

[01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:46.690]
We know what Susan looks like from the chin down because she's got the thing across the eye, the blackout on the eyes.

[01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:50.470]
Why did they do that?

[01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:51.690]
Why is there a blackout?

[01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.650]
This is the sky's their identity, her identity.

[01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:55.330]
That disguised her identity?

[01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.270]
But you remember all those magazines you're old enough?

[01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:59.830]
Yeah, but I mean, why was she want to do that?

[01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:01.630]
I guess, maybe this was someplace else.

[01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:04.250]
Maybe this was like in TV Guide. Maybe her daddy's a listener.

[01:17:05.290 --> 01:17:08.130]
George and Susan 84 and Erin and Amy 84.

[01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:11.970]
I don't want to like shortchange the other people because they, Mr. and Mrs. Mark T have 16.

[01:17:12.190 --> 01:17:13.590]
Mr. and Mrs. Juan have 13.

[01:17:14.370 --> 01:17:15.770]
John and Rebar are those queens.

[01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:17.050]
I mean, those guys have 13.

[01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:22.410]
Lydia and Robert 12, the dirty dozen, Diane and Nancy.

[01:17:22.610 --> 01:17:25.030]
A dayna, whatever the name is, dayna Nancy of 12.

[01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:28.430]
Brad and Paul have a dozen, which is shocking.

[01:17:28.910 --> 01:17:30.010]
Mel and Billy have 11.

[01:17:31.230 --> 01:17:33.050]
Mark and Marcy have 10.

[01:17:34.450 --> 01:17:35.830]
Mr. and Mrs. Anita have 9.

[01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:36.670]
They should be doing better.

[01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:38.650]
Now that's John and Susie 8.

[01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:41.230]
Mr. and Mrs. have 6.

[01:17:42.050 --> 01:17:42.810]
Is that how you say it?

[01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:28.570]
I'm listening to the near roe cake, I'm gonna eat the hour.

[01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:29.910]

When Cheryl backed me up but now what the hell?

[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:55.550]

[01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:31.490]
on the Georgian Susan picture it's not just her eyes that are blacked up but there's also

[01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:36.290]
another that's shaded out there a little gray the original picture we got was not but for because

[01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:42.510]
it's a family show and a family website we did that yeah I learned the show area well that's

[01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:47.610]
probably a pretty good idea yeah because we already got one farm animal on the website you know

[01:19:47.610 --> 01:19:52.790]
the one that's on Moe's head I mean muskrats beavers we don't want to have those all over the place

[01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:57.110]
oh no seriously no because then we'll start getting complaints from right

[01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:08.050]
yeah from those animal people anyway uh it's tight Georgian Susan 91 Aaron and Amy 89 it's so

[01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:11.510]
damn tight I don't even dare look anymore I can't handle it you know the pressure is building

[01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:20.150]
to a fever pitch 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 only AT&T and Verizon wireless line

[01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:26.850]
is it called from Kendall hello yes sir the poll is it a legitimate poll or just a straw poll

[01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:33.450]
see just a player of people's emotions what do you mean by that yeah not the uh the one with

[01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:39.730]
Rick and Sud in other words is it a possibility that we actually occur the Rick and Suds would do

[01:20:39.730 --> 01:20:44.550]
the show yeah sure it's possible because it's still two months away okay all right okay I already

[01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:51.170]
want one and a half okay I guess Suds is actually revolving factor with or without Rick so but yeah

[01:20:51.170 --> 01:20:56.930]
it's really without Rick and we would live in the show if he was with uh George there a bit so

[01:20:56.930 --> 01:21:03.330]
right but uh okay good I voted on I'm happy then what do you vote I'm sorry I did vote for Rick and

[01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:10.490]
Suds only for a change but if it was Rick and Suds and George I would have no problem with that I okay I could go with that either way

[01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:22.090]
uh you uh need to have thrilled to uh remake of the gaki thing oh my oh my okay all right man you got it

[01:21:22.090 --> 01:21:28.090]
thanks that's a good idea you know what I got everybody's wicked hard all those guys in the S&S with

[01:21:28.090 --> 01:21:37.530]
their fancy hey it's no my gossip time Kevin Miller 7105 votes who should have been feeling for

[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:45.960]
this summer starting the 4th of july Rick and Suds 221 George alone 141 George and suds 134 that's

[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:53.200]
275 combined the beast 55 we don't believe it for all 45 George doing for all's voice 34

[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.800]
being her boy little Carlos 24 Steve came 23 Lynn Samuel 15 and Joseph Gaki very surreptitiously

[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:06.440]
is moving up from behind with 13 and with somebody with a face like that starts moving up from

[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.380]
behind like that I'd step on it you know what I mean step on a gas put the pedal to the metal get

[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:21.300]
with it shut up okay 56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T see they probably think that this is like pre-planned

[01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:25.600]
or like I got these droppings it it's just a continuous cassette tape that I just ran you know

[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:32.420]
a freaking nut oh my god yeah but you see now you're you're like I don't know your credibility really

[01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:38.140]
took a serious puncture wound this morning and that's because that's because you came in your last

[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.120]
night to suck up to this guy the whatever area's the beast didn't do lucky around you you finished

[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:47.900]
off the rest and just sucked out heavy duty maybe you want to produce this guy shows that with the

[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:52.520]
deal is there was nothing left after the beast was looking around I'm sure that the room where I'm

[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.020]
here and is he's going to be moving to that morning slot real soon hey moe it's been nice no

[01:22:56.020 --> 01:23:01.360]
yes sweetheart but you know get the other get that extra piece out of the cleaners and have a great

[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:11.940]
life 56705 60 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line here's a key lago hello

[01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:18.800]
Neil yes sir hey first I want to vote for George and such okay secondly I want to definitely

[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:22.580]
second you're a thing about having he and he on a scum out and rescue all these people

[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:30.380]
uh this guy's got through now sounds like a Bob Goldberg want to be with that voice yeah doesn't he

[01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.440]
no no actually I want to ask you when you guys cut spots for somebody right yeah I assume they get

[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:40.320]
paid for it right no I don't I don't cut spots well I mean like go he does he's here more

[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:47.160]
good right smile and all this sure okay why would any advertiser want to have him do it spot as soon

[01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:51.620]
as I hear his voice I have to switch the station I don't even listen to the spot you know that's

[01:23:51.620 --> 01:23:55.880]
an excellent poem I first came to QA and the very first day that I was on the year and he had a spot

[01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.220]
what was that restaurant George it's out of business now that's fake house London royal or something

[01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:06.360]
no no began with a P there was a cigar joint and a stake house but Drenos no now that might have been it

[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:12.220]
so that's like nails on a blackboard yeah and Gellie was doing the recorded spot and I sat there and I

[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:16.640]
said to George off the ear I said how can people be paying for this voice to be doing her commercial

[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:20.980]
and I still don't understand it yeah I mean I don't either I mean one state you know I just

[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:28.420]
say once his voice comes on I'm out of here okay palying well I'll see you all right bye bye I don't get

[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:33.360]
it it's not a shot of Kelly's got a high squeaky voice he can't help it you know but I don't

[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:43.600]
I that wasn't the name of the place what was it not a squally is not the I don't know what was it see

[01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:47.280]
this is and this is my theory like with Neil Rogers also it's the kind of thing like if you throw a

[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:51.040]
ball at him he runs the other way if you shot a hockey puck in Neil Rogers he'd be running now

[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:56.360]
441 the other way now you've got a tools of ignorance and he was a catcher in minor league baseball

[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.440]
and he could have gone pro he decided he was the radio actually it's probably been more profitable

[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:06.600]
yeah has been Gellie who should fill in pernealous summer Rick and suds 228 George 145 George

[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:12.820]
and suds 141 the B56 of which about a whole bunch of phony for L 45 I just got to read this

[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:18.480]
we'll see I'm afraid to go back to the other one yellow no I'm afraid because I don't I want to see

[01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.040]
it like a real contest they're all week long I want to see it really tight oh look at that

[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:30.720]
Aaron and Amy are back on top oh 104 and now how's that possible George and suds and

[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:38.960]
have 92 they just opened up a big lead there is that amazing no you got a big flurry and it's not

[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:48.620]
even furry Aaron and Amy 104 George and suds and 92 mr and mr. mark t 20 that's so in other

[01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:51.880]
words that would just be wasted my time reading the other ones I mean the other contestants

[01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:56.260]
signal go on there for their own like ego purposes and take a look but obviously the winner is

[01:25:56.260 --> 01:26:00.980]
highly unlikely I wonder you never know there's a whole week to go right right still a long way

[01:26:00.980 --> 01:26:04.240]
to go we don't want to declare any winner on the first day of a seven day contest that would be

[01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:10.580]
really bad although here's a call from West Palm Beach hello hey I was young yes sir

[01:26:10.580 --> 01:26:16.600]
we're about to jaguar nobody's calling in about the duck about the ducks in her four-nuffin

[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:20.420]
winning John Sebastian Jiguerre another shutout last night who was allowed what about two goals

[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:24.100]
in seven years now yeah I think a while they're helping a little bit but still far before

[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.640]
you're right I agree with you well you see no they have no hockey fans in suffer they wouldn't

[01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:33.000]
know John Sebastian Jiguerre from my John Paul Jones yeah my kids are just now getting in the hockey

[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:37.400]
and that's because they will remember this for a long time it's a phenomenal thing the only problem

[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:42.060]
being of course that around a country other than the the Disney connection other than that nobody

[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:49.980]
cares about the ducks yeah once once the wings and the stars all I think a lot of people dropped out

[01:26:49.980 --> 01:26:55.220]
but I'm I'm still good there I don't know what they'll think well I sure hope auto beats Jersey

[01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:59.560]
because if jerseys in a final man you probably have to take you guys take note the notos to watch

[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:04.140]
that I did I despised the way they play I can't stand a whole ambiance of that team it's a

[01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:08.080]
phony franchise nobody goes to the devil's games they're out there in the middle of Jersey nobody

[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:12.380]
cares about them and please go out of the way you know can you imagine what the score is going to be

[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.520]
with jiggy playing in the modern or there's going to be zero zero games you know triple overtime zero

[01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:22.100]
for 14 over times you're right they'll have to have oxygen hey Neil call you back thanks bye he's

[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:26.640]
going to call me back and a hind there only one going away from the stand to cup finals and like

[01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:30.840]
Tom jikka says you chased by a mario de ta you should you should let them hear he's the best

[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:37.100]
did you know that Thomas is such a big hockey fan nope I don't think he is he's just desperately

[01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:40.800]
flailing around for some way to try to respond to the fact that I've outed him for like being a

[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.340]
boza when it comes to the coverage of the local market and then even here I am 1200 miles away

[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.740]
and still have my thumb on exactly the pulse or what's going on there which isn't too much

[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.460]
in fact every time I click back over to the hot couples pictures I have my thumb on the pulse

[01:27:54.860 --> 01:28:01.580]
for on something and of course like I said now this this uh George and Susan we don't really

[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:08.160]
know what George looks like you follow apparently it ain't hurting him well most of our people don't

[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:12.840]
give a crap about what George looks like right including you and in your case that's lucky

[01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:18.580]
Aaron named me 106 and George and Susan 96 I think it's going to swing back and forth all week you

[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:22.840]
know what I mean I think George and Susan are going to swing I think it's going to swing back

[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.260]
and forth and up and down and sideways and in and out and all over the goddamn place that's just

[01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:32.040]
which is good that's great and then you never know maybe somebody else will come racing up from

[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:40.400]
behind that hop right under the fray 10 minutes passed known at 560 WQA and hey I'll think about

[01:53:10.670 --> 01:53:15.590]
He's worse. He's terrible. No offense, but he's not a DJ. You know, I don't know.

[01:53:15.610 --> 01:53:18.150]
And by the way, for the guy before the crank, I don't pay Canadian taxes.

[01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:20.430]
God, I don't Canadian income asshole. But anyway, what?

[01:53:20.490 --> 01:53:23.690]
You know what I was going to ask you. Did you ever see Pi, which is the first film

[01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:25.630]
that the guy that Aaron Aske did?

[01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:27.810]
You mean the moment he put the guy on the set at the end?

[01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:32.150]
Yes. Yeah, that was cool. And also welcome to the dollhouse, the thing Todd Solen.

[01:53:32.430 --> 01:53:35.470]
Yeah, I got to get to it. Yeah, those movies I saw there years ago.

[01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:37.770]
Anyway, I love you. Okay, thanks.

[01:53:37.770 --> 01:53:39.790]
Listen to your voices really sexy. You know that?

[01:53:40.130 --> 01:53:42.430]
It sure is. It really is. Okay, man. I have a great day.

[01:53:42.450 --> 01:53:44.630]
Bye, Vanessa. Bye. Bye.

[01:53:44.670 --> 01:53:44.910]
Bye.

[01:53:46.210 --> 01:53:47.750]
She said she hates you, George. Yeah.

[01:53:49.150 --> 01:53:51.870]
Who should fill in for Neil during this summer? I'm not going to read the whole thing

[01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:52.750]
because it's too embarrassing.

[01:53:53.650 --> 01:53:56.850]
851 votes. So when Joseph Gekki still in last place, that's all you need to know.

[01:53:57.630 --> 01:53:59.350]
And the beast has got a bunch of phony votes.

[01:54:00.070 --> 01:54:03.070]
And George doing for else voices, only seven behind for real himself.

[01:54:04.010 --> 01:54:06.130]
Maybe that's some of some for our clients to think about.

[01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:10.670]
Because if they're going to put him on full time, they might have to pay him some serious bucks.

[01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:11.250]
I can tell you.

[01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:13.270]
You know, the number is right. 570560.

[01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:16.730]
Pound that 560 special on AT&T and Verizon Wireless.

[01:54:17.290 --> 01:54:18.650]
I'm going to get some cash going tonight.

[01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:24.070]
Incoherent, I think is the word that comes to mind.

[01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:26.470]
Incoherent. Here's Palm City. Hello.

[01:54:27.690 --> 01:54:28.930]
Hello. This is me. Yes, sir.

[01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:30.050]
Oh, Neil.

[01:54:30.790 --> 01:54:33.230]
I got a vote on the poll.

[01:54:33.230 --> 01:54:35.950]
And I also have a shameless request. Can I get both?

[01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.670]
Go ahead.

[01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:42.150]
Okay. I kind of liked last summer when you had your tapes on.

[01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:44.770]
I know you don't like the tapes, but you had the tapes and George.

[01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:46.690]
It was to me. That was good.

[01:54:47.010 --> 01:54:47.790]
I didn't hear it.

[01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:49.470]
We were waiting to hear the tapes on last summer.

[01:54:49.870 --> 01:54:50.930]
I didn't hear the tapes.

[01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:53.010]
Oh, I'm sorry. You were live for two days. That's right.

[01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:54.090]
That's what I liked.

[01:54:54.210 --> 01:54:55.550]
Oh, well, we're still doing that.

[01:54:55.710 --> 01:54:56.370]
I'm still going to two days.

[01:54:56.370 --> 01:54:56.990]
Three days. Three days.

[01:54:57.210 --> 01:54:57.290]
Yeah.

[01:54:59.410 --> 01:55:01.210]
I like the end of your energy chooses.

[01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:03.110]
I like to have George on.

[01:55:03.170 --> 01:55:05.250]
I like to listen to him on the other days.

[01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:06.590]
I don't personally.

[01:55:06.730 --> 01:55:07.930]
I don't like him five days a week.

[01:55:08.310 --> 01:55:09.710]
But if you're going to be on there, two days.

[01:55:09.710 --> 01:55:11.490]
And third days, I just didn't have George the rest of the time.

[01:55:11.490 --> 01:55:12.230]
I pray you know something.

[01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:13.870]
I'm thinking that's really the way to go.

[01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:15.250]
George Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

[01:55:15.370 --> 01:55:16.230]
Neil, two days and third days.

[01:55:16.270 --> 01:55:17.090]
And I'm just doing the summertime.

[01:55:17.090 --> 01:55:18.630]
I'm thinking all year long would be good.

[01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:21.390]
Well, I wouldn't want that all year long.

[01:55:21.610 --> 01:55:23.410]
I would. I wouldn't.

[01:55:23.450 --> 01:55:24.410]
I mean, no. I would.

[01:55:26.030 --> 01:55:27.230]
And what's the request, Kelly?

[01:55:27.230 --> 01:55:27.850]
Three quests.

[01:55:28.710 --> 01:55:29.970]
My I've been telling my brother,

[01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.810]
who lives in New Hampshire all about nobody speak English anymore.

[01:55:32.810 --> 01:55:33.610]
I need to. Okay.

[01:55:35.730 --> 01:55:36.270]
I'll okay.

[01:55:36.270 --> 01:55:36.630]
I'll sneak it in.

[01:55:36.650 --> 01:55:36.930]
Okay.

[01:55:37.290 --> 01:55:38.590]
Oh, you're a wonderful man.

[01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:39.910]
I have to say.

[01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:40.170]
I have to say,

[01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.450]
birthday.

[01:55:40.450 --> 01:55:41.050]
Thank you, Neil.

[01:55:41.490 --> 01:55:42.270]
Happy birthday, Palli.

[01:55:43.190 --> 01:55:43.750]
In November.

[01:55:44.150 --> 01:55:44.270]
I'll see you.

[01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:44.590]
Okay.

[01:55:45.210 --> 01:55:46.350]
Both more on November 5th.

[01:55:46.350 --> 01:55:48.370]
Well, I'm going to have to play that now because if I don't do it now,

[01:55:48.430 --> 01:55:50.130]
because you know what, what I got to play at the end of the slide,

[01:55:50.130 --> 01:55:52.410]
I mean, I don't have to, but I feel like it.

[01:55:52.450 --> 01:55:53.330]
And it's supposed it's already in there.

[01:55:53.450 --> 01:55:53.810]
Cued up.

[01:55:54.010 --> 01:55:54.830]
It would be a criminal thing.

[01:55:54.970 --> 01:55:55.210]
Not to.

[01:55:55.210 --> 01:55:56.530]
It would be bad not to play.

[01:55:56.830 --> 01:55:58.090]
Bad at the end of the show.

[01:55:58.290 --> 01:55:59.470]
So now we'll play this.

[01:56:00.450 --> 01:56:02.330]
John Pierre McCaxie,

[01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:03.650]
Carburet Driver,

[01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:04.730]
Central Park.

[01:56:05.610 --> 01:56:08.030]
You look at me so quissically.

[01:56:08.530 --> 01:56:09.970]
I could tell she was in a dog.

[01:56:10.710 --> 01:56:13.990]
So I acted out my puncture in

[01:56:13.990 --> 01:56:16.650]
and with my arms the trees I made.

[01:56:17.070 --> 01:56:17.690]
There's no bug.

[01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:19.390]
He speaks English anymore.

[01:56:19.390 --> 01:56:19.650]
Oh.

[01:56:23.570 --> 01:56:25.210]
I went down to my, yeah,

[01:56:25.330 --> 01:56:27.910]
I made a bridge where the weather business and so many.

[01:56:28.790 --> 01:56:31.070]
I walked into a liquor store

[01:56:31.070 --> 01:56:33.050]
for the guy that talks real fun.

[01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:35.390]
I asked him for a pint of

[01:56:35.390 --> 01:56:36.510]
whole gym beamies.

[01:56:36.570 --> 01:56:38.850]
It's just now at the end of what doesn't mean.

[01:56:39.370 --> 01:56:40.990]
The bus is English.

[01:56:41.550 --> 01:56:42.210]
I got a mall.

[01:56:43.770 --> 01:56:45.650]
That cornered the alley.

[01:56:46.730 --> 01:56:48.350]
Hell, I think I'm in Pakistan.

[01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:50.850]
Speaking with smelly.

[01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:53.470]
Are you can go back to the Lair?

[01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:04.550]
I came here many years ago

[01:57:05.630 --> 01:57:06.510]
learned my ABC.

[01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:09.930]
I don't say much is grossiest.

[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:11.670]
I said pretty pretty.

[01:57:12.690 --> 01:57:14.810]
So get yourself to a classroom

[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:16.390]
quicker in America now.

[01:57:16.570 --> 01:57:17.910]
Stop making me sick.

[01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:19.950]
You know, but I should be English.

[01:57:20.190 --> 01:57:24.150]
I'm going to be like 11 to 1 at 5.

[01:57:24.150 --> 01:57:25.050]
60 WDQ.

[01:57:25.050 --> 01:57:27.230]
I mean, I'm looking at this very jackass article

[01:57:27.230 --> 01:57:28.770]
the other day about the forrel thing.

[01:57:30.070 --> 01:57:31.630]
And I think, you know, as usual,

[01:57:31.730 --> 01:57:34.490]
because Greg uses very jackass as his mouthpiece

[01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:36.250]
to rip people and the spread rumors

[01:57:36.250 --> 01:57:39.430]
and the spread paranoia and and whatever to plant the seeds, you know.

[01:57:40.210 --> 01:57:42.030]
There is a great seed planter.

[01:57:43.010 --> 01:57:45.810]
And where he says he's considered using

[01:57:45.810 --> 01:57:47.530]
forrel on Howard David's morning show.

[01:57:48.150 --> 01:57:49.150]
But nothing is imminent.

[01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:51.630]
He says we'd like to add more humor to the morning show.

[01:57:52.030 --> 01:57:53.390]
So can you read between lines on that?

[01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:57.170]
In other words, the question is who's going to be with him

[01:57:57.170 --> 01:57:57.770]
on a morning show?

[01:57:57.850 --> 01:57:59.490]
Not a question of if it's just a question of when.

[01:57:59.730 --> 01:58:01.310]
Who's going to be with forrel in a morning show

[01:58:01.310 --> 01:58:02.430]
and who's going to be out?

[01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:05.450]
And who's going to be on top and who's going to be on a bottom?

[01:58:05.710 --> 01:58:06.570]
That's the only question.

[01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:07.590]
Why does somebody have to be out?

[01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:10.090]
Now, who is this can't possibly be our chronic friend

[01:58:10.090 --> 01:58:10.950]
from New York, can it?

[01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:13.510]
The epitome guy or whatever that word was?

[01:58:13.590 --> 01:58:13.770]
Hello.

[01:58:14.270 --> 01:58:15.310]
No, Neil. That's not him.

[01:58:15.310 --> 01:58:16.210]
Oh, thank God.

[01:58:16.330 --> 01:58:17.090]
How are you doing today, sir?

[01:58:17.290 --> 01:58:17.630]
Pretty good.

[01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:20.430]
Hey, just want to talk a little hockey before the end of your show.

[01:58:20.830 --> 01:58:21.050]
Okay.

[01:58:21.250 --> 01:58:23.310]
Isn't it amazing that Babcock got robbed

[01:58:23.310 --> 01:58:24.990]
in the United of May or finally played like a hockey player?

[01:58:25.550 --> 01:58:27.730]
Well, you know, people have been questioning about

[01:58:27.730 --> 01:58:29.990]
if people said, wow, you know, you were ripping him Neil

[01:58:29.990 --> 01:58:31.350]
and the Panthers gave up too early.

[01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:33.010]
There were some guys they could have played here

[01:58:33.010 --> 01:58:34.030]
till they were 100 years old.

[01:58:34.090 --> 01:58:35.130]
They never would have been good.

[01:58:35.330 --> 01:58:37.270]
They went to Calgary and he stuck the joint out.

[01:58:37.530 --> 01:58:39.150]
You've got to get a guy in a certain situation

[01:58:39.150 --> 01:58:40.670]
playing with a certain chemistry.

[01:58:40.830 --> 01:58:41.670]
And for whatever the reason,

[01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.530]
he fit right in there and he's playing great.

[01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:45.210]
And he had to sweep break away the other night.

[01:58:45.490 --> 01:58:46.070]
I saw that.

[01:58:46.210 --> 01:58:46.650]
It's the same place.

[01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:47.410]
I saw that. It's your hand.

[01:58:47.790 --> 01:58:48.890]
And you know the funny thing too,

[01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:50.490]
about Shigerr, the people don't talk about

[01:58:50.490 --> 01:58:52.470]
is the reason Calgary gave up on him

[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:54.010]
is because he dehydrated.

[01:58:54.750 --> 01:58:54.950]
Yeah.

[01:58:55.090 --> 01:58:56.870]
You notice his water bottle in the back of the net.

[01:58:57.170 --> 01:58:58.110]
He drinks out of a straw.

[01:58:58.770 --> 01:58:59.450]
And that's not the best way.

[01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.310]
Less air to get out of it.

[01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:02.110]
I hear for a little drink out of a straw too,

[01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:02.590]
is what I heard.

[01:59:03.110 --> 01:59:04.230]
I wouldn't doubt that either.

[01:59:04.610 --> 01:59:07.230]
Hey, and parting, the worst thing about hockey on the SPN,

[01:59:07.810 --> 01:59:08.250]
Gary Thorn.

[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.970]
He's an asshole.

[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:10.890]
Which is why my CBCA.

[01:59:11.150 --> 01:59:11.530]
Love you, Neil.

[01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:12.430]
See you, Pallie.

[01:59:12.890 --> 01:59:14.570]
Little hockey talk from a guy from New York

[01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:15.870]
where they really appreciate their hockey.

[01:59:16.010 --> 01:59:17.670]
And of course, they don't have any plant with the Rangers

[01:59:17.670 --> 01:59:18.410]
or the outlanders.

[01:59:18.570 --> 01:59:20.490]
They're done just like the make-believes.

[01:59:20.650 --> 01:59:22.270]
Hey, listen, it's down to Anaheim

[01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:23.870]
and forget about the wild.

[01:59:23.970 --> 01:59:25.010]
They had a nice run, but they're done.

[01:59:25.410 --> 01:59:26.550]
And then of course, Ottawa, New Jersey.

[01:59:26.730 --> 01:59:27.290]
Pray for Ottawa.

[01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:28.010]
Okay, please.

[01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:30.110]
Because New Jersey is his boring

[01:59:30.110 --> 01:59:31.690]
is listening to a Gilbert Land.

[01:59:32.130 --> 01:59:33.710]
Oh, I mean, just coma inducing.

[01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:35.010]
Nobody wants to hear that.

[01:59:35.850 --> 01:59:38.030]
Okay, here's the so far, at least during the show,

[01:59:38.090 --> 01:59:38.710]
the final result.

[01:59:38.830 --> 01:59:40.490]
Who would fill in the should fill in for Neil this summer?

[01:59:40.490 --> 01:59:42.470]
Rick and SUDs 270.

[01:59:43.190 --> 01:59:44.890]
George and SUDs 171.

[01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:46.970]
George solo 167.

[01:59:47.290 --> 01:59:48.270]
The B62.

[01:59:48.870 --> 01:59:49.810]
You buying it, Beanorboy?

[01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:51.570]
No.

[01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.350]
No.

[01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:53.230]
No way.

[01:59:53.610 --> 01:59:54.270]
For all 53.

[01:59:54.950 --> 01:59:56.390]
George, New Ferrell's voice 46.

[01:59:56.810 --> 01:59:57.530]
Steve Cain 30.

[01:59:58.330 --> 01:59:59.290]
Beanorboy 27.

[01:59:59.690 --> 02:00:00.530]
Lynn Samuel's 20.

[02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:01.450]
And Josie.

[02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:02.650]
Joe may not be good on here.

[02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:04.230]
He may not be exciting, but at least he's consistent.

[02:00:04.630 --> 02:00:07.470]
He's been sucking wind in last place from the get-go.

[02:00:08.010 --> 02:00:09.970]
Out of 862 votes, he's only got

[02:00:09.970 --> 02:00:11.250]
16, he's in last place.

[02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:12.670]
He's still sucking a big one.

[02:00:12.770 --> 02:00:13.130]
Poor Joe.

[02:00:13.650 --> 02:00:16.570]
Good guy, but we don't want to hear money here.

[02:00:16.830 --> 02:00:17.770]
There's a lot of nice people.

[02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:18.650]
We don't want to hear money here.

[02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:20.450]
And let me take one.

[02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:21.430]
Can I take a quick peek?

[02:00:23.230 --> 02:00:25.370]
At a hot couple sky, I guess I can do whatever I want.

[02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:26.570]
Aaron and Amy 180.

[02:00:27.550 --> 02:00:29.390]
George and SUDs 138.

[02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:32.310]
As Aaron and Amy, all of a sudden have pulled into a lead.

[02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:34.210]
Okay, still got a long way to go though.

[02:00:34.850 --> 02:00:35.950]
So get to that website.

[02:00:36.130 --> 02:00:37.150]
Take a long hard look.

[02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.950]
Squeeze it.

[02:00:38.030 --> 02:00:38.510]
Peruse it.

[02:00:38.630 --> 02:00:39.190]
Examine it.

[02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:39.970]
Think about it.

[02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:41.770]
My life and locals.

[02:00:42.150 --> 02:00:43.950]
This is 430516.

[02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:46.030]
Way to go, yeah.

[02:00:47.650 --> 02:00:48.890]
Well, congratulations.

[02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:49.750]
Get a life.

[02:00:50.970 --> 02:00:52.370]
Have a great time, boys.

[02:00:53.770 --> 02:00:55.370]
I'm the little leader of the world.

[02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:59.550]
I will be exploded to dumb and people killed.

[02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:02.090]
With the gas that we sold him.

[02:01:02.370 --> 02:01:04.130]
First time aggressor nation and

[02:01:04.130 --> 02:01:05.990]
the only one that's going.

[02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:08.130]
Now more blood will be spilled.

[02:01:08.130 --> 02:01:10.370]
To get that oil flowing.

[02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:12.210]
Forget about Korea.

[02:01:13.210 --> 02:01:15.190]
The nooks there, Tosinamba.

[02:01:15.670 --> 02:01:21.810]
For right wing is drilling it over and over and to our hip.

[02:01:22.930 --> 02:01:24.950]
Daddy, ride past the sun.

[02:01:25.690 --> 02:01:28.150]
Weapons of master structure.

[02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:41.390]
3000 people killed.

[02:01:41.770 --> 02:01:43.110]
Are now forgotten.

[02:01:43.710 --> 02:01:44.990]
Let's exploit them instead.

[02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:47.470]
Aint there's oil to be gotten.

[02:01:47.970 --> 02:01:49.670]
Going after Saddam too.

[02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.470]
Plankato Sama.

[02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:53.870]
There's no longer mention of.

[02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:55.630]
The name is laudate.

[02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:58.010]
But no one seems concerned all.

[02:01:58.470 --> 02:02:00.070]
I'll be in complacent.

[02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:01.470]
Believe in every word.

[02:02:01.850 --> 02:02:03.750]
Of this cartel administration.

[02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:05.870]
That control this by fear.

[02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:10.130]
Through media manipulation and the right wing.

[02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:15.030]
Is drilling it over and over and to our hip.

[02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:18.230]
You turn at our aggressor.

[02:02:18.930 --> 02:02:21.490]
Weapons of master structure.

[02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:35.470]
The loss of civil rights is the right

[02:02:35.470 --> 02:02:36.410]
that we're paying.

[02:02:36.850 --> 02:02:38.390]
We're all suspects now.

[02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:40.390]
Not the ass crop is being.

[02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:41.370]
I have.
